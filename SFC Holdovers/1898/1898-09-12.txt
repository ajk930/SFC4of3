"JStigltiess^l/Srtriiii' of* 'New"'"West minster
was totally destroyed by fire this
tnorning, entailing a loss of $2,500,000.
Despair and suffering are the lot of
hundreds of homeless people. Food,
clothing and aid of all kinds are being
hurriedly dispatched from Vancouver
to the ill-fated "Royal City." :
It is not known how many people lost
their lives, but It is feared several hava
been burned to death. Campbell, a fire
man, fell from the roof of a burning
building and was killed. A woman
dropped dead from fright. Another
who was ill died while rescuers were
removing hfr from a burning house,
while a third suffering from typhoid
fever, who had been twice removed
from residences which were In the
burning zone, did not survive the shock.
So fierce were the flames that apples
on the trees on the side of the street
opposite the burning houses were
roasted.
Three river steamers were destroyed
âthe Edgar, the Gladys and Bona Con
cord. Every industry save the big
Royal City Planing Mills and Cleve
land Canning Company plant has been
destroyed. The Canadian Pacific Rail
way station and the bridge across Fra
zer River were burned.
The fire started at about midnight on
the river front and was causad by a
spark from a steamer. Fanned by a
fierce gale, the flames spread at such a
rapid rate that within three hours ten
streets were ablaze.
The fire was first noticed at Brack
man & Kerr's wharf, on Front street.
From there it spread down to the Ca

MANILA, Sept. 11.â The Irritation induced by the aggressive at
titude of certain irresponsible native leaders acting in defiance of
Aeuinaldo'B orders, not to mention the secret efforts of the ecclesias
tical party to promote disturbances with the intention of leading the
revolutionary government to certain ruin, has become so serious
that American troops are now kept in barracks under arms ready for
action at a moment's notice. â¢
A feeling of insecurity and unrest exists. Many native workmen
are daily leaving their employers with the open Intention of Joining
the rebels. Hundreds who are now on strike in cigar factories and
other establishments are recruiting Aguinuldo's ranks.
The "dictator" made a triumphal entry into Malols Saturday,
formally taking posseesion of the new capital in the Saopaloc district.
Frklay night the insurgent band of Juan Blanco created consider
able disturbance by attempting to disarm recruits considered too
youthful to bear arms. One captain was mortally wounded.
Juan Blanco is a man who deserts from one party to another as
occasion serves. It has been persistently reported that he is the
agent of the Spanish clerical party to spoil Aguinaldo's game. I
have not been able to verify these reportÃ.

Front street and Columbia street, the
business thoroughfare of the city.
Block after block caught fire and in a
â¢few minutes there was nothing left of
what had been the business portion of
New Westminster.
From Columbia street the conflagra
tion spread up the hill to a huge build
ing built upon piles in a gully bridged
by Carnavon street. There was a great
space under this building filled with
dry seasoned lumber. The air got in
with the fire and gave it jreat play.
There was a whirlwind of flame v. hich
belched forth destruction.
From this point the fire spread. The
English cathedral was qu'ckly at
tacked. The Baptist church followed
and the Central Methodist also. All
were destroyed, together with a large
number of residences. The inhabitants
had to flee for their lives.
The fire swept down Carnovon street,
and quickly enveloped the big brick
courthouse and the wooden City Hall.
Fortunately there was a bie open space
here and the flames were not able to
leap far enough to take in the big Cen
tral School. Agnes street, however,
had got alight and on one side of Royal
avenue. All the houses on that street
were completely burned. The wind was
blowing furiously down Frazer River
toward the north. If it had been blow

Catholic church buildings, convent and
hospital and other structures would
have been burned.

PnESCOTT, \t\z., Sept. 11.â Th*
town of Jerome, near here, was com
pletely destroyed this morning by fire,
with a loss of over $1,000,000 in prop
erty. Eleven bodies have so far been
recovered from the ruins, while a score
or more persons are missing.
The fire originated from a gasoline
stove In a cabin and spread so furious
ly and fiercely that it was Impossible
to save even clothing.
The fire was confined exclusively to
the business portion of the town and
the open ground intervening between
it and the mammoth works of the
United Verde Company saved the lat
ter's plant, otherwise the loss and suf
fering would have been terrible.
Many people from Jerome ~-~ arriv

remaining are being cared for by the
company.
The area of the fire was confined to
a narrow gulch and ravines leading to
it, in which were located substantial
wooden and stone buildings, the latter
melting as rapidly before the flames as
pasteboard. Over 150 residences, aver
aging in value $2000, twenty-five gen
eral merchandise and other stores, sa
loons and stands of all kinds are in
ashes â in short, not a single business
house remains. The only building to
escape was the Methodist Church.

citizens. There was not a single
butcher, baker or provision shop that
was not destroyed, and there was only
one small hotel saved. Some of the
burned-out people retired in the early
hours this morning in the open air in
front of the school house. They cover
ed themselves with blankets and lay
down to sleep under the sky.
The loss is roughly estimated at $2,
500,000; Insurance, $1,500,000. Bank

FLAMES RACED FROM
STREbT TO STREET
Residents Given but Time to Escape
Alive Without Attempting to
Save Their Belongings.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Sept. 11.â New
Westminster from 11:15 on Saturday
night until 5 o'clock this morning was
a sea of flames and now the town Is a
mass of ruins. The business portion
has been completely destroyedâ in Jact,
the city has been practically swept off
the face of the earth.
The conflagration began In the hay
on Brackman & Ker's wharf at about
11:15 o'clock. The crowd which was
promenading up and down Columbia
street on Saturday, as is usual at the
close of the week, had thinned out. All
were at home or on the way home, save
little gatherings of men, who lingered
on the corners. These groups were sud
denly startled by the dull boom from
the flrebell, and a shower of sparks was

of the ' disaster, carrying ; tents and

many.' The loss is complete,' little In
surance being written In that camp,
owing to the gerat risk and the inade
quate water, supply." The .United Verde
management is now kindly caring for
the sufferers, until other arrangements
are made.
The building the fire originated In
was the scene of a drunken carousal
last night, and while no demonstrations
are being made against the men who
are responsible for it, attention will
be given to them later.
Various parties are now endeavoring
to extricate the remains from the ruins
and until the ground cools sufficiently
to permit rescuers to approach the de
bris, it will be impossible to ascertain
definitely the names of the victims.
Several prominent mining men in the
West are said to have been in the town
at the time and are unaccounted for.
The fire started at 7 o'clock in the
morning and spread with such rapidity
tfcat In less than two hours not a house
the city market building. The clatter
of hose carts along the almost deserted
thoroughfares and the ringing of fire
gongs caused the streets to fill rapidly
again and the size of the blaze to the
southward indicated to the hurrying
crowds that the firemen had a large
contract on their hands.
The firemen had located the blaze In
a huge pile of hay â about 200 tons â
stored on Brackman & Ker's wharf.
The hay had been there since early in
the season and the sultry summer had
thoroughly prepared it as fit food for
the greedy flames. Hose lines were
speedily attached to the nearest hy
drants, but even while this was being
done the roof of the Brackman & Ker
building burst into flames and fell in.
The stern-wheeler Edgar, which had
tied up to the wharf shortly before 10
o'clock was by this time enveloped in
flames. Her cables parted and she
drifted down the river on the outgoing
tide, a grand but awe-inspiring sight.
To the Edgar many ascribe the out
break of the terrible conflagration. It
is said that sparks from her furnaces
set fire to the hay, but it Is said by
others that her flies had been banked
an hour before the alarm was given.
Still others attribute the disaster to
some man who threw a match on the
wharf after lighting his pipe. A half
dozen different theories for the origin
of the fire are advanced; nor is this to
be wondered at, for there were at least
six distinct conflagrations blazing
within fifteen minutes after the first
alarm.
The Edgar dropped rapldlydown the
stream, but the set of the current car
ried her Inshore and she fouled the
steamer Gladys, which was tied up to
the Canadian Paci.Lc Navigation wharf.
Despite the strenuous efforts of the crew
and many volunteers, the Gladys took
fire almost Immediately. The timbers
and buildings of the Canadian Pacific
Navigation Company, dried by the heat
of the summer, were ignited and the
men on the wharf were forced to re
treat or meet an awful death.
tt^ two boats broke clear of the up
per end of the wharf together, and In
a short space of tim^ had struck the
Btemwheeler Bonacord. She, too, be
!n p.t area that would cover five bloi-Ks
was left standing.
On the other side of the gulch hun
dreds of pounds of giant powder was
used in the attempt to arrest the
flames by demolishing buildings, but
eye-witnesses state that" as soon as a
gap was made the scattered buildings
were licked up as if by suction and
thrown hundreds of feet in every di
rection, only to ignite and increase the
fury of the fire.
It is said that the entire family of a
man and wife and three children, who
endeavored to save what they had been
years In accumulating, have been
found in the ruins. As the arrivals
from the scene reach the city the de
vastation reported is found to be only
the more pitiable and sad.
Dr. Woods, the company physician,
narrowly escaped losing all the patients
in the hospital, but by good judgment
a score of inmates were saved by him
by being removed early and hastily.
The reservoir which supplies the
town with water, was undergoing re
pairs at the time, but eye-witnesses
state that had the water been abund
ant after the fire had gained headway,
the result would have been the same.
So complete is the disaster that refu
gees in this city to-night are not only
penniless, but are without necessary
clothing as well.
came ablaze. Her cables parted and
away she went j ith the other two in
this carnival of destruction.
By strange ill-luck the waters, as
though in league with the fiery element,
carried the ships close along the
wharves which line the Frazer River.
All were ripe for the blaze, and wher
ever the vessels touched fires started.
All the canneries and sheds on the
water front were Ignited. The Gladys
and Edgar soon foundered and sank.
The Bonacord was scuttled to prevent
her setting fire to the Royal City Plan
ing mills.
At midnight the citizens saw that the
city was in imminent danger. There
was only a puny stream of water to
fight the fire. Chief Ackerman was
away on a holiday and Foreman Wat
son was in his place. The Mayor tele
phoned to Vancouver that the city was
on fire. In an hour and a quarter the
entire fire brigade of Vancouver was on
the scene, and the two brigades pumped
water from the river, abandoning the
reservoirs. The Vancouver boys did
noble work, actually checking the fire
westward at the Queen's Hotel block,
and again several blocks back from
there In the residence portion.
At the Brackman & Ker wharf, where
the fire had its origin, two firemen were
driven from their hose by the heat.
The people in the Columbia Hotel,
Just across from Brackman & Ker, soon
recognized the danger of their position
and desperate efforts were made to save
their effects. Lytton square, upon
which the east side of the hotel faces,
was lumbered with all sorts of per
sonal property.
The fire spread V> the Market build
ing. This was food for the flames, and
in an instant Chinatown, which is on
Front street, east of Lytton square,
was blazing from one end to the other.
Frenzied Chinamen rushed up and
down in despair. Acting Chief Watson
soon recognized the futility of trying to
save any of the wharves or property In
that vicinity.
The fire having obtained the majstery
on Front street made its first attack
on Columbia avenue by a diagonal
move. Soon the Columbia Hotel was a

MANY EUROPEAN
COUNTRIES MOURN
There Is Universal Grief Over the
Assassinatior) of Austria's Be
loved Empress.
VIENNA, Sept. 11.â The plans for the
funeral of the late Empress Elisabeth,
who was assassinated by an anarchist
yesterday at Geneva, contemplate
bringing the remains to Vienna next
Thursday, a lying in state on Friday
and the obsequies of Interment on Sat
urday.
Every flag in the city is at half-mast
to-day and the theaters, races and
other amusements are suspended in
definitely. All the Archdukes and the
Archduchess Marie Valeric have ar
rived at Schoenbrunn. It was reported
last evening that Emperor Francis Jo
seph had gone to Geneva by a special
train, but this was an error. At noon
to-day he had not yet left Schoen
brunn. Crown Princess Stephanie, who
has been staying at Darmstadt, has
been summoned.
The Emperor's fortitude Is the topic
of universal admiration. He is bear
ing 1 up manfully, despite the terrible
shock, which in view of his age, had in
spired the gravest apprehension. Al
though at flrat stunned and then slight
ly hysterical, he soon regained his self
control and displayed remarkable calm
ness. Occasionally, however, complete
ly overpowered by his grief, he moaned
piteously, repeatedly sobbing the name
of the Empress.
Addressing Prince yon Liechten
stein, Chief Marshal of the imperial
household, he exclaimed last evening:
"It is inconceivable how a man could
lift his hand against one who never in
her life injured any, who did nothing
but good. Nothing is spared to me In
this world."
He managed to sleep several hours
last night, and said this morning hÂ«
felt comparatively well, discouraging
the attempts of his attendants to dis
play solicitude for his health.

Dispatches of condolence are arriving

European sovereigns. The court will
go into mourning for six months.
DEMONSTRATION OF
SWISS OFFICIALS TO
SHOW THEIR SORROW
BERNE. Switzerland, Sept. 11.â The
Federal Council met this morning and
sent the following telegram to Em
peror Francis Joseph:
"The Swiss Federal Council has the
honor to express to -our Majesty its
prqfoundest grief and deepest indigna
tion at the horrible crime to which her
Ma^sty Empress Elizabeth has fallen
a victim. Our pain and indignation are
all the greater owin to the foul crime
havi-~ been committed on Swiss ter
ritory. The Council hastens to assure
your Majesty at the same time of its
warmest sympathy and that of the
whole Swiss people in the great loss
your Majesty, the imperial house and
people of Austria and Hungary have
suffered through your exalted lady's
death."
The flag on the Federal building is
at half mast. 1 'ie Council reassembled
this afternoon to consider the steps to
be taken. It is expected that the ju
dicial authorities of the Canton of
Vaud will conduct the inquiry and the
trial.
The Geneva Canton met to-day and

pressing the horror of the Government2
and the people of Geneva and a decree.
directing a popular demonstration to
morrow. All the civil officials will
march past the Hotel Beaurivage, fol
lowed by the citizens, all of whom are
Invited to participate. During the pro
cession, the great bell of the cathedral,
associated with all Swiss national dem
onstrations of grief and Joy, will be
tolled.
Emperor Francis Joseph telegraphed
the Austrian Minister, Count Yon Kuef-
Bteln, to consent to a post mortem ex
amination. Dr. Reveruin, Dr. Mege
vaus and M. Golday, Mayor of Geneva,
were entrusted with the examination
of the wound on behalf of the judicial
authorities, and accordingly proceeded
to the Hotel Bepurivage, where they
carried out their Instructions. At the
close of the examination they announc
â¢d that death was caused by "internal
hemorrhage from a triangular incised
wound." They decided that the in-
Jury was of a character to leave no
grounds for the theory which had been
advanced that he Empress, who suf-
fered from weakness of the heart,
might have succumbed simply to the
shock of the blow. The autopsy show
ed that the lung as well as the heart
was pierced.
The General Council will place upon
the coffin wreaths intertwined with the
Austrian-Genevan colors and bearing
the inscription: "A token of sorrow
ful sympathy from the people of
Geneva."
Throughout yesterday's examination
of the assassin, his demeanor was one
of revolting cynicism.
Empress Elizabeth was about re
turning to Caux, France, when she was
murdered. Her suite had preceded her
by train, leaving with her only her
maid of honor, Baroness Yon Roths
child, and a man servant. The officials
who visited the hotel to affix the seals
upon the baggage according to the
strict law in force, found that the
suite's luggage had accompanied the
suite.
The last words of the Empress were
addressed to the attendant. Recover-
ing consciousness for a moment, she
feebly asked what had happened.
As yet the authorities have found no
confirmation of the report that the
murder was part of an anarchist con
spiracy, but a dozen persons with whom
the assassin associated have been ar
rested for examination.
DASTARDLY DEED CAUSES
BITTER INDIGNATION
LONDON, Sept. 12.â The terrible
news has thrilled Europe from end to
end and everywhere but one question
is asked: "How can society protect
itself against anarchism?"
Special dispatches from every capital
describe the effect produced and news
paper comments that palpitate with
bitter indignation that a defenseless
woman, who shunned politics and did
nothing but good, should be selected,
at the moment of the approaching
jubilee, for an assassin's knife. Per
haps the most poignant grief is dis
played in Italy, because the public
mind there Is touched with shame that
so many political crimes have been
committed by Italians.
King Humbert, with his own hands,
wrote a telegram expressing the deep
est sympathy. The Pope wired Em
peror Francis Joseph as follows:
"May God give the strength^tf resig
nation to our dear son Joseph, who in
so short a period has been tried by so
many misfortunes. We pray that God
may bestow upon the house of Haps
burg that peace and tranquillity which
It merits by reason of its sentiments
toward the church and the papacy."
The Pope ordered solemn mass in the
churches of Rome for the repose of the
soul of the deceased.
It is understood that the Prince of
Naples and Emperor William, with
Empress Augusta and Victoria, will
attend the funeral.
Another feature is the intense sor
row and sympathy evoked in Hun
gary- It is hoped that the sad event
T .vill tend to compose the politcial
troubles between the two parties of the
dual monarchy.
Emperor Francis Joseph, it is paid,
has been troubled from the beginning
of the year with gloomy forebodings,
and was often heard to express a fer
vent wish that the jubilee would soon
be safely over. His brother. Archduke
Ludwig Victor, was dining at a res
taurant in the Jubilee exhibition at
Vienna when the news of the assassina
tion reached him. He hastened to
Schoenbrunn, where, on meeting .the
Emperor, a deeply affecting scene en
sued.
The Emperor is much agitated. Twice
he has started for Vienna, each time
changing his mind. He is unable to
ent anything. His daughter, Archduch
ess Valeric, remains constantly at his
side. A number of Italian workmen
were severely mobbed and ill-treated
in a Vienna restaurant Saturday, and
wrre only saved by the police from a
worse fate.
It appears that last Thursday Em
press Elizabeth had read to her pas
sages from one of Marion Crawford's
novels describing the Sicilian vendetta
murders. She was much horrified at
the details, which resemble those of her
own death. It is understood the book
had been chosen for her with the idoa
of dissuading her from visiting Sicily.
GREAT SORROW OF THE
PEOPLE OF HUNGARY
BUDAPESTH, Hungary, Sept. 11.â
Both houses of the Diet met to-day in
extraordinary session. Long before the
magnates and Deputies arrived the
legislative palace was surrounded by
an Immense concourse of sorrowing
people.
A band of 500 students, carrying
craped banners, lined the road leading
to the entrance of the Unterhaus.
The president of the chambers, ex
pressed the nation's sorrow and condo
lence, and in both houses motions be
fitting the occasion were adopted. The
Diet then adjourned.
A royal decree issued to-day suspends

VICTORIA MOURNS THE
LOSS_OF ELIZABETH
LONDON, Sept. 11.â Queen Victoria
and the Prince and Princea* of Wales
telegraphed their condolence to Em
peror Francis Joseph last night.
The Court Circular says: "The Queen
received last evening with feelings of
tht utmost consternation the startling
news of the terrible crime. The Queen
mourns profoundly the loss of her Im
perial Majesty, with whom ehd had
been on terms of friendship for many
years. She feelÃ likewise most deeply
for the honored and bereaved Emperor,
who has experienced so many trials

THE FIEND GLORIES
IN HIS FOUL CRIME
GENEVA, Sept. 11.â No strangers
are allowed to approach the coffin of
the murdered Empress Elizabeth. The
body has been embalmed and is dressed
in white.
The doctors phptographed the wound,
but the plate will be destroyed. It is
understood Emperor ...Francis Joseph
will not leave Austria, but will send
high court officials to take the body to
Vienna, Flowers are arriving in pro
fusion.
The assassin of Empress Elizabeth is
calm in demeanor and frankly congrat
ulates himself upon the success of his
crime. He says: "I am an anarchist,
but I belong to no committee. I acted
on my own initiative. Let them do as
they like with me. That is my
strength."
â¢
STORY TOLD BY THE
LADY IN WAITING
GENEVA, Sept. 11.â The lady in
waiting who was with the Empress at
the moment of the attack says:
"After the Empress rose, I asked her
if she felt any pain. She replied: 'I
don't know. I think I feel a pain In
my chest.' *
"I said: 'It must be fright. Take
my arm.' The Empress declined,
straightened herself up and walked
calmly on board the steamer. Even
when she lost consciousness I thought
it only fright or an attack of nervous
ness. I am positive she never knew
she had been struck by an assassin."
WEAPON OF MURDERER
FOUND AND IDENTIFIED
GENEVA, Sept. 11.â MidnightâA file
found late this evening in the passage
of a house on the Rue dcs Alpes has
been identified by the assassin as the
weapon used.
His name, though heretofore various
ly given and published here as Luc
cheni, Luccesi and Lucchesi, is now
said to be Luigini.
The Italian records show that Lui
gini was an illegitimate child and took
his mother's name. He has been twice
arrested as a defaulter of the military
service.
TEN FRIENDS OF THE
ASSASSIN ARRESTED
LAUSANNE, Switzerland, Sept. 11.â
Ten friends and acquaintances of the
assassin of the Empress Elizabeth were
arrested here to-day. He has been
working as a stonemason in this vicin
ity, and last month he took the prelim
inary steps to become a naturalized
Swiss. His application papers, how
ever, he withdrew last Monday.
INTERNATIONAL ACTION
AGAINST ANARCHISTS
London, Sept. 12. â Many of the prom
inent European journals are urging in
ternational action against anarchists.
They recall that both the late M. Car

and the late Senor Canovas del Castillo,
the Spanish Prime Minister, were the
victims of Italian anarchists.

The Chinese store of Kwong Wing

incident of the flrt occurred. Mun Lee,
the head of the firm and one of the
wealthiest Chinese merchants in the

of the Fraser. Front street, as the
name suggests, is along the water
front. Running parallel with Front
and in succession are Columbia, Clark
son, Carnarvon, Victoria, Agness, Cun
ningham and First or Royal avenue.
Each of these streets is on a consider- !
ably higher level than that preceding â â 
in fact between Columbia and Clark
son streets, the grade is so steep as to j
make descent almost dangerous for
horses.
Columbia avenue was the principal
business thoroughfare. All along both |
sides it was built with imposing brick !
and stone buildings of which any city j
might have been proud. The Bank of
British Columbia occupied the finest j
of these bricks. Opposite was the
postoffice, and the roof of this was
ablaze almost as soon as was the bank.
All the events here described had
transpired so quickly that the crowd
which rushed aimlessly up and down
Columbia avenue had really no idea of
the extent of the conflagration. From
the wharves, which were blazing for
the full length of the city front, the
fire Immediately communicated with
buildings ' standing cityward. Along
McKenzie, Lome, Begbie, Alexander and
Eighth streets the flames rushed in a
mad chase. It seemed to the panlc-
Btricken citizens as though each sep
arate street had its * own particular
demon and that all were working in
fiendish rivalry to be the first to reach
the business center of the city.
Thus it was that the whole south side
of Columbia avenue burst into flames
practically at the same time. Mer
chants who had made desperate efforts
to save such private papers as had not
been put into safes or vaults were
drawn from their stores in the rush for
life. Hotel Douglas, on the corner of
which the Bank of Montreal was lo
cated, became a volcano of flame a few
minutes after it was first noticed to be
on fire. The guests had ample warning
and all escaped from the building, ;
though few had more belongings than
what they stood in.

ments were made for a special train
to leave for Nanaimo whence a relief
party will go to New Westminster by
boat. The Premier, the Finance Min
ister and the Mayor will accompany the
party. Two carloads of tents and
blankets were taken along. The depot

FIRE RAZES RED
BLUFF BUILDINGS
Hundred Thousand Dollar
Blaze in the Tehama
Metropolis.
Conflagration Starts in a Lodging
House and Lays Waste the
City's Business Center.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
RED BLUFF, Sept. 11.â One of the
most disastrous fires which has swept
this city for years started this morning
at about 2:30 o'clock in the rooms erf a
lodging-house above Kestener's restau
rant. When discovered it had gained
so much headway that hope of saving
the Kestener building and that adjoin
ing it was abandoned, and the firemen
turned their attention to saving the
rest of the block. They were unsuc
cessful, for the fire burned rapidly
southward, and by 6 o'clock this morn
ing the whole of the finest business
block in this city was in ruins.
The block was composed of brick
buildings, including the Bank of Te
hama County, Wells, Fargo & Co.,
Fickert's furniture store, Darrough's
drug store, Prince's clothing and dry
goods store and the Western Union
Telegraph ofilce.
The progress of the fire northward
was stopped by the high brick wails
of Hoffman's saloon, else the whole of
eastern Main street would have been
destroyed. The firemen did everytmng
in their power to keep the flames con
fined to the Corrigan building, occu
pied by Kestener and Prince, but the
supply of water was inadequate and
the flames soon found their way
through the top of Fickert's building
and Darrough's drug store, and, once
started here, the Bank of Tehama
County could not be saved. Together
with the Wells-Forgo and Western
Union Telegraph buildings is was soon
a mass of flames. Fortunately no wind
was blowing at the time of the tire.
The buildings were all of brick, but
finished in wood, and the flames
ed from building to building by means
Jumped from building to building
by means of, the connecting rafters,
igniting the stocks of the various
stores, all of which was highly inflam
mable and made a hot fire.
Mr. Kestener, in whose building the
fire started, was badly burned about
the face and body in trying to save
household property. Mrs. Kestener es
caped through the heroic efforts of the
firemen.
At 5 o'clock the fire seemed to be un
der control, but at 8 o'clock an alarm
was turned in again. The flames had
Jumped to the north, and were in the
urcer part of the building: occupied by
A. H. Hoffman as a saloon. However,
they were soon got under control.
The buildings will probably soon be
rebuilt by their owners. The following
Is a list of the \r -s, the amounts lost
and the probable insurance:-
Corrigan estate, loss $15,000, insurance
about $8000; E. Fish, building, loss $10,000,
insurance about $8000; store fixtures, loss
$SOOO, Insurance about $5000; A. H. Hoff
man, loss $1000, Insurance about the same;
D. A. Prince, loss $20,000. insurance small;
P. R. Kestener. Joss $2500, insurance un
known; G. C. Williams, loss $7500, insur
ance about $2200; C. H. Darrough, losa
$15,000, insurance about $Soi/v: Bank of Te
hama County, loss $2000; insurance the
same; Wells. Fargo & Co., loss $1000, in
surance the same; Dr. G. W. Westlake,
loss $1500, insurance about $600; Coffman
Bros., loss $1800, insurance about $700; A.
H. Hoffman, saloon, loss $1000, Insurance
small; A. L. Hunter, loss $500, fully cov
ered.
It will be seen from this that the loss
will be considerable over $100,000 and
covered by a small Insurance.
WAS THE WORK
OF A FIREBUG
Destruction of Property at
Sacramento Due to
Incendiarism.
Police Arrest an Ex-Convict Who
Recently Served Time In
Folsom Prison.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 11.â Chief of
Police Dwyer this evening granted The
Call an interview with George H. Bitt
ner, arrested on suspicion of having
started the fires which at 2 o'clock this
morning threatened to destroy the val
uable block bounded by Fifth and
Sixth, X and L streets. At .the time
the dispatch published in this morn
ing's Call was being sent the flames
were having a mad race over a large
section of the block, and the entire Fire
Department was at work, suffering
great disadvantage through lack of
water. At 2:30 o'cloc!" the rear part of
the Sixth-street Methodist Church was
ablaze, and it seemed that the splen
did edifice would meet the fate of Schad
Bros.' wagon and hay barn and Fra
zer's branch lumber-yard. However,
the church war saved, although before
the fire was subdued about $30,000
worth of property on the block had
been destroyed.
Blttner, the suspected firebug, was
arrested during the fire by Chief Dwyer
and Detective Maley while he was in
Schad's barn taking great interest in
the conflagration. His account of him
self differs from that which the police
have traced, and they believe they have
the right man.
"Yes, it is true," said Bittner to The
Call correspondent, "that I have been
out of Folsom prison only a short time,
and that I have served two years for
arson, in having set fire to a restaurant
on J street, between Third and Fourth,
this city, where I was employed as
cook. They accused me of having
tried to set the fire thirteen different
times. But that was a lie. I only tried
to set the restaurant afire ten times."
"Why did I do it?" repeating the
question asked him.
"Oh, I don't know," said Blttner, ner
viously twitching his fingers alon? his
face and coloring up. "I did it; just
did it, that's all, and I don't deny it.
But I didn't set fire to the lumber-yard
or barn this morning. I can prove an
alibi."
But whatever else Blttner may be
able to prove he cannot establish an
alibi. Many witnesses will swear that
he was in the neighborhood of the fire
soon after the discovery of the flames,
and there are witnesses, too, who will
testify that they saw him at another
equally as mysterious fire occurring
earlier in the night about half a block
away from the location of the b'.g
blaze.
Firemen say that when they got into
Frazer'a lumber-yard, whence the blaze
communicated to Schad's stable, they
Fmelled coal oil as it ascended in fiery
vapor from the stacks of lumber. There
can be no question that the fire was of
incendiary origin.
Bittner says he has been cooking for
a crew of Western Union linemen for
some months. He is boyish in appear
ance and aged 24 yrfars.
Schad Bros.' loss will be: Barn, $1000;
hay, $1200; rigs, not belonging to s;able,
but kept there, uninsured, for v/hlch
owners are responsible, $3000; insur
ance, $750 on building, $750 on hay. The
main loss was that sustained by W. F.
Frazer, the branch yard containing
picked lumber. It amounts to $15,000;
insurance $8000. A brick tenement
house and other losses of smaller pro
portions make up the balance of the
estimated total. Smaller buildings,
three in number, were insured.
Big Fire at Washington Courthouse.
COLUMBUS, Sept. 11.â A dispatch to
the State Journal from Washington
Courthouse says that the Masonic Temple
there was destroyed by fire this morn
ing. The Springfield (Ohio) Fire Depart
ment rendered timely assistance. The loss
on the building is about $40,000. Frank L.
Stutson, who had a largo department
store in the building, lost his entire
stock, valued at $60,000. The losses are
considerable.

PRINCETON, Ky., Sept. 11.â The block

BUILDINGS RAZED
BY AN EXPLOSION
Occupants Crushed in
r the Ruins.
DISASTER â¢ IN PHILADELPHIA
FOUR CORPSES FOUND -IN THE
: DES_*IS.
/
Forty Tons of Gasoline in the Cellar
of : a â Grocery Store Blows Up, .
--Wracking the Building
and Two Others.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 11.â By the
explosion of forty gallons of gasoline
in the cellar of a grocery store at 1444
South street to-night, four, and pos
sibly a dozen lives were lost. As an
immediate consequence of the explo
sion, the buildinsr wherein it occurred
and those adjoining it on either side
collapsed, and up to 10 o'clock, four
hours after the occurrence, four bodies
have been recovered from the ruins.
Three of these identified are as fol
lows :
Samuel Schattenstein, keeper of the
grocery store.
His ten-year-old son Abraham.
A ten-months-old child named Gold
berg.
The fourth body was that of a girl
about ten years old.
How the explosion occurred Is yet un
known. The front of No. 1444 was
blown out, and this was followed by
the collapse of that structure and No.
1442, occupied by Morris Goldberg's
furniture store, and No. 1446, Louis
Sallinose's shoe store. The west wall
of 1440, occupied by L. Wagner's cloth
ing store, was blown out. Because of
confusion and excitement following the
disaster, it is as yet impossible to se
cure anything 111- - an accurate census
of the occupants, but it is generally
stated that the upper stories were
crowded with families, huddled to
gether in tenement fashion. Coming
as it did at the supper hour it is feared
that the loss of life was heavy. The
list of injured will be long. They were
taken to all the hospitals within a
radius of a mile.
After the recovery of the four bodies,
the authorities decided to postpone the
search for additional victims unui to
morrow morning, thus obviating the
dangers and delays of working upon
the mass of debris and wreckage in the
darkness.
The corpses of Shattenstein and his
son were picked up on the steps of No.
"1444. The unidentified ten-year-old girl
was found pinioned by a mass of tim
bers in the rear of the same building,
and the Goldberg child died while being
taken to the hospital.
The injured at the Howard Hospital
are: L. Shattenstein, aged 12, broken
nose and laceration of scalp; Alexan
der Shattenstein, aged 6, lacerated
scalp, condition serious; Mary Healy,
age 65, fractured leg; Annie McPhil
omy, aged 40, contusion of ankle;
Harry Rothmel, 12 years, lacerated
scalp; Maggie Goldberg, 12 years, lac
erated scalp; Sarah Goldberg, 14 years,
lacerated scalp and contusion of ankle.
At the Jefferson Hospital are A. F.
Fish, 39 years, foreman of Truck Com
pany D, lacerated wound of scalp, and
Yetta Goldberg, 9 years, contusion of
leg and back, and lacerated wound of
scalp.
At the Polyclinic is Rose Schatten
stein, 8 years, lacerated finger.
The ten-months-old child was Max
Goldberg, son of the furniture-store
keeper. Estimates of the number cf
missing vary from eighteen to six.
The accepted theory of the accident
Is that Shattenstein went into the cel
lar with a lighted lamp, which ignited
the fumes of the gasoline. From the
position of his body and that of his son
on the front steps it is thought they
were emerging from the house when
caught by falling walls. The collapse
of the buildings occurred within two
minutes of the explosion, and the oc
cupants had little time or chance to
escape. Mrs. Goldberg snatched up her
ten-months-old child in her arms and
rushed for an exit, but the child was
so badly injured that it died while being
borne to a hospital. Strangel- enough
the mother escaped with only trifling
injuries.
At 6:46 o'clock to-night a sergeant
of police was talking with one of his
men on the opposite side of the street
when, without a moment's warning,
there was a terrific explosion, which,
almost before they could turn their
heads, was followed by a thunderous
crash. Mingled with this was the cries
of human beings. Without loss of time
one of the policemen struck the fire
alarm at a box near by, while the
other rang for ambulances.
The engines and six of the hospital
wagons were there within twenty min
utes and a large force of policemen,
also summoned to the scene, had the
streets roped off from corner to corner.
The work of rescue was begun forth
with, but was temporarily abandoned
later when the twilight had deepened
into night. All the dead and injured
were in buildings at the time of the
disaster, and as the walls collapsed al
most in a perpendicular direction, no
passers-by were Injured by flying de
bris.
The force of the explosion was co
great, however, that all the windows in
the houses across the street were
broken by the concussion. The search
for more dead will be resumed at day
break. None of the Injured are ex
pected to die.
PORT ROYAL DRYDOCK
DAMAGED BY A GALE
Cannot Be Used by the Navy De
partment Until Repairs Have
Been Made.
NEW YORK. Sept. 11.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: As the result
of the hurricane which struck Port Royal,
S. C, on August 30, the drydock at that
point haa been very badly damaged and
considerable injury has been done some
of the buildings of the Naval station. A
mail report of the injury sustained by the
station has been received by the Navy
Department from Commander C. H.
Rockwell, its commander, who was un
able to telegraph the facts because all the
wires were blown down. Ten and a half
inches of water fell during the twenty
hours of the storm and the wind was a
hurricane. Commander Rockwell ex
pressed the opinion that it would be in
judicious to try to use the dock for dock
ing a ship until the full extent of the
damage was known. Some of the altars
are pried out of position.
CERVERA SOON WILL BE
EN ROUTE TO SPAIN
Steamship City of Rome Arrives at
Camp Long to Take Aboard
the Prisoners.
PORTSMObTH, Sept. 11.â The Anchor
Llna steamer City of Rome, fully equip
ped to transport the Spanish prisoners to
Spain, arrived In the lower harbor this
Afternoon. Tbd big liner brought from
New York Admiral Cervera, with his full
staff of officers and ninety-four other
prisoners.
The men at Seavys Island, when they
caught sight of the City of Borne, danced
for joy and to-night there is great excite
ment at the camp.
Everything is in readiness on board the
steamer. Each of the 1688 men will have
a bunk for himself throughout the voy
age of about eight days.
It js expected that the last prisoner will
leave Camp Long at 10 o'clock and that
the City of Rome will pass . out of the
harbor not later than to-moorow noon.
The steamer will be headed straight for
Santander, Spain.
There is scarcely a sick man among the
entire crew of the late Cape Verde fleet,
while every one looks fat and healthy
and is in strong contrast to their ap
pearance of two months ago.
WHAT THE LATE WAR
HAS COST THE ENEMY
Nearly Four Hundred Millions Ex
pended on the Army, but Only
a Trifle on the Navy.
NEW YORK, Sept. 11.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Aside from the loss of her colo
nies and ships destroyed in battle, the
late war has cost Spain In the neighbor
hood of $374,500,000. Information to this
effect has been received at the Navy De
partment from naval attaches of this
Government abroad. According to in
formation in possession of the depart
ment, all the money obtained has been
expended on expeditions sent to the colo
nies, whose total amounted to 180,431 sol
diers, 6,222 officers and about 700 generals.
Of the millions expended but $5,600,000
was spent by the Spanish government to
increase its naval force.
El Nundo of Spain, commenting upon
this small appropriation for the navy
when such a large sum was expended for
the army, points out that this sum was
only sufficient to have bought and main
tained a battleship of 10,000 tons. "With
the entire appropriation," it continues,
"sixty battleships could have been se
cured."
According to reports received here, it is
appreciated by the Madrid government
that, in view of the condition of her
treasury and the further fact that her
naval force is now greatly inferior, it
would be useless to attempt to continue
the struggle, especially as there is no
nation of Europe willing to support her
in case she should again resort to the ar
bitrament of arms. In view of this fact,
the authorities here have no reason to
believe there will be any serious hitch
in the result of the negotiations of the
peace commission, and while they expect
the Spaniards will do evxerything pos
sible to delay the completion of the
treaty, believing that they" may bring up
complications advantageous to their gov
ernment, the American representatives
will be in a position at any time to bring
them to terms by a single threat to with
draw.

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Sent. 11.â
Sunday was observed for the first time
since the war terminated as a day of
rest and worship. All the military and
civil offices were closed, as were also
the shops, and the city's appearance
was unusually quiet. Religious serv
ices were held at the palace, and Gene
ral Lawton, General Wood and other
American officers attended.
This afternoon the correspondent of
the Associated Press visited the wrecks
of the Spanish cruisers. The work of
floating the Infanta Maria Teresa is
nearly completed, but the Almirante
Oquendo is not worth the cost of sav
ing.
Colonel Ray, who returned from
Guantanamo yesterday, reports the
embarkation of all the Spaniards save
about eighty under General Pareja.
The American authorities are awaiting
the arrival of the San Juan with about
2000 Spanish troops from Sapua de
Tanamo and Baracoa. The steamer is
expected Wednesday. The Spaniards
will be re-embarked here on the San
Augustin and the San Francisco for
Spain.
To-morrow the Bessie and two oth^r
vessels will leave for Baracoa and Sa
gua de Tanamo, carrying supplies for
the Americans, Cubans and Spanieids
there. The condition of the S^anisn at
Guantanamo prior to their departure
for Spain was, Colonel Ray say 3, most
distressing. The death rate was over
eighty per day and Colonel Ray be
lieves that more than half will die on
the oassage.
Seventy died on the wharf the day
the San Ignacio was loaded, and there
is yellow fever among those who re
main behind. Colonel Ray had two
mules killed for fresh meat supplies
to the Spaniards. No fresh beef was
to be had and the Spaniards were glad
to get the mule meat. Indeed, there
has been no meat of any kind in Guan
tanamo for three weeks. The first bat
talion of Colonel Ray's Company con
tracted yellow fever from a Spaniard.
Sixty cases have broken out-
Four hundred Cubans have laid down
their arms at Guantanamo and gone
to work on the plantations near the
town. No rations are supplied to
armed Cubans.
Santiago is now filled with Cuban
soldiers from General Castillo's com
mand. One result is a large numker of
gala parties at the various clubs.

SAD ACCIDENT AT SAN JOSE
YOUNG LADY GROUND UNDER
A DERAILED CAR.
Shocking Occurrence Causes a Panic
Among the Meny-Makers, Who
Were Unable to Render
Assistance.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FAX JOSE, Sept. 11.â Clams were the
principal diet of about 5000 Native
Sons and Daughters and their friends
to-day â clams and corn â with a few
accessories â and it is doubtful if one
of those in attendance ever enjoyed a
feast more than they did that served
under the trees :it Alum Rock.
The affair wajs marred by an acci
dent in the afternoon by which a young
lady was fatally injured. Miss Emily
Blanchar/i, a beautiful girl of 19 years,
whose parents reside in this city, was
the victim. The steam cars running
between the terminus of the electric
cars and Alum Rock were crowded
with humanity on every trip. All the
rolling stock owned by the company
was called into use, each train being
made up of four or five cars drawn by
a steam dummy. Miss Blanchard, with
some friends, was on board the train,
arriving at the scene of the festivities
at 3 p. m. She was standing on the
platform, being unable to get a seat.
Wh.-n Hearing the depot and running
at high speed, the car on which Miss
Blanehard was riding was derailed by
a defective switch, dragging the fol
lowing car with it and both being
thrown almost at right angles with the
rails.
The unfortunate girl either jumped
or was thrown from the carâ those who
were with her and others who saw the
accident differ on that pointâ as It left
the track. At tho same time her dress
caught in the car and she was thrown
under the wheels. She was rolled and
dragged for several feet and was terri
bly crushed in thÂ» lower part of the
body, while her right arm was nearly
severed above the elbow.
Many hundreds witnessed the acci
dent, and there was a panic among the
women. The track was lined with peo
ple on both sides waiting to take the
train back to San Jose, and when the
derailed cars swung around they nar
rowly missed a number of persons.
Miss Blanchard was so tightly wedged
under the truck that it was necessary
to lift the car up bodily in order to
rescue her. She was given such aid as
it was possible to render under the cir
cumstances while a carriage was being
prepared to convey her to thecity, but a
glanro was sufficient to show that she i
was beyond all human assistance. She
was unconscious, and there were but
faint signs of respiration. As rapidly
as possible she was driven to the Mc-
Mahon Hospital. She never rallied from
the shock and at 10:30 to-night ehe
died,
The aTldp-nt pet an end to further
merrymaking, but the derailed cars
blocked tin- road so that it was several
hours before trains could resume th<Mr
trips, and it was long after dark before
the last of the throng could get away
from tho park.
Another, and happily, less serious ac
cident occurred earlier In the day. J.
P. Bubb of San Jose, was driving out
to the clam-bake when his team be
came unmanageable, throwing him
from the carriage and dislocating his
shoulder.
The clam-bake Itself was a grand
success and fittingly closed the three
days' celebration. The guests began to
arrive at the park before 9 a. m., but
it was two hours later when the first
attack was made on the provender.
Tables were spread for SOO people and
the first relay was composed exclu
sively of ladies, the men being obliged
to take a back seat for a time. After
that all were on equal terms.
All the trains for San Francisco to
day were packed and to-morrow
morning the last of San Jose's guests
will take their departure. The lelebra
tlon has beÂ»n a great suroess through
out, the citizens and the Native Sons
nnd Daughters being equally well
pleased with the affair.

PHOENIX, Sept. 11.-W. B. Casey, a
rancher, was killed this morning at Mar

John Mander. Witnesses say the killing
was In self-denfense, but Mander ran
away. The Sheriff returned late this
evening and said that when he left the
posse Mander was about ten miles ahead,
going toward Hassayampa. The rest of
the posse is In pursuit and probably will
capture him to-morrow morning at Box
Canyon, whither he must go for water.
Casey was well known all over the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1898.
REBELS CONTROL
LUZON ISLAND
Its Conquest Is Nearly
Complete.
ALL BUT MANILA AND CAVITE
SPANIARDS DRIVEN OUT OF
EVERY POSITION.
General Otis Notifies Aguinaldo to
Withdraw From the Suburbs of
Manila or Take the Con
sequences.
Bpfcial Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Sept. 12.â The Manila cor
respondent of the Times, telegraphing
September 9, says:
The insurgent conquest of the island
of Luzon is rapidly approaching com
pletion. Recent authentic reports an
:irunce the capture of successive Span
ish positions and at present the rebels
control every foot of the island except
Manila, Cavite and a small portion of
the province of Albay.
They hold over 9000 Spanish prison
ers and have recently captured several
thousand rifles, some cannon, a large
quantity of ammunition and several
armed stands. The Spaniards held out
valorously, but were fighting against
the Inevitable.
It is undeniable that the action of the
insurgents In pursuing the campaign
after an armistice was declared has
caused much useless suffering and de
struction of property and has annihil
ated their every claim to be considered
In any respect as the allies of the
Americans. Their motive has been
twofold â first, an implacable hatred of
the Spanish, with an Innate racial
thirst for revenge, and secondly, their
wish to place themselves on record be
fore the world as a successful revolu
tionary government and as complete
masters of the Luzon provinces and as
many adjacent Islands as they may
have to occupy before the Philippine
question has been settled by the Paris
commission.
They are now free to with draw thete
troops to make an expedition against
Panay and to capture Hollo. B*- con
tinuing the campaign now, regardless
of the armistice, they put themselves
in the wrong with everybody. Just as
by crowding Into the suburbs of Ma
nila, and refusing to vacate the same
unless compelled by superior force, they
have put themselves in the wrong with
the Americans.
Their action is doubtless due partly
to the disorganization of their force,
which, by their own confession, con
sists of an aggregation of Independent
units, with chiefs, each ambitious of
power and distinction and all strug
gling for positions which will secure
for everybody booty or otherwise pri
vate fortune. This disorganization,
which naturally affects the Irresponsi
ble individuals, has been constantly
fomenting the irritation resulting from
the dual occupation of the suburbs of
Manila. The situation has been Im
possible from the beginning, and con
flicts have been avoided only by the
great tact and extraordinary patience
of the American troops, who loyally ob
serve their duty of preserving the peace
of the town.
The policy of permitting the Insur
gents to occupy the Spanish positions
has been fruitful In many difficulties,
not the least of which Is the stimulus
given to the conceit of the natives, who
consider themselves the conquerors of
Manila, although they captured not a
single position when the town was
taken.
General Otis has attacked the com
plicated question left by General Mer
ritt, his predecessor, with remarkable
energy and decision, and is rapidly es
tablishing order in every department
where comparative chaos ruled before.
He has been fully occupied with mat
ters more intimately concerning the
military government of Manila, and
only recently has he been able to study
exhaustively the insurgent question and
to satisfy himself regarding the equity
of the insurgent claims so as to solve
a problem practically unapproached
heretofore.
Aguinaldo has persistently demand
ed, in terms not too polite, various im
possible concessions, for example, an
occupation of the Governor General's
palace and other palaces; a written as
surance that the insurgents will be
permitted to occupy permanently their
military positions around Manila, and
protection for the Insurgent vessels by
the American fleet, with many other
claims, including an innocent demand
for a share of the booty captured by
The Americans at Manila.
After a careful review of the situa
tion, General Otis arrived at the logi
cal conclusion that the insurgents have
no right to occupy the suburbs of Ma
nila, and that Aguinaldo's claims have
the support of neither equity nor rea
son. He has. therefore, categorically
refused to consider Aguinaldo's de
mands and to-day sent him an ulti
matum In terms plainly comprehensi
ble and authoritative, that he must
withdraw his troops from the suburbs
bpfore to-morrow afternoon or suffer
the consequences of refusal.
The answer will probably be that
AÂ«ruinaldo himself is only too willing to
obey the order, but cannot explain to
his troops the reasons why they cannot
remain at Manila. This temporizing
excuse, although now stale from too
frequent use, conceals much truth. It
is an undoubted fact that Aguinaldo
has but a feeble hold on the organiza
tion. His ower is fast waning, and
the insurgents are threatened with dis
integration into opposing factions un
less some leaders are soon discovered
who are able to harmonize these con
flicting personal interests.
It is reported the Presidency of the
revolutionary Government will be of
fered to Cajetano Arellano at a Con
gress at Malolos on September 15. Arel
lano is a lawyer of excellent repute â
the one man among the Filipinos who
is universally resnected.

and the fear of a general epidemic is
growing less. Nearly half the population
has left the city. The streets have been
iilled with vehicles all day, and the high
ways leading to tho country are lined
with wagons lilled with household goods
and provisions. Most of those who are
fleeing from the infection have gone only
a short distance into the country to await
developments. The Board of Health
firmly believes that tho disease was
brought from New Orleans. To-nighfs
report from Taylors shows no new cases
at Orwood, and two at Taylors.

TRADE TAME, BUT SATISFACTORY.
HOT weather interfered with trade all over the
country last week, except on the Pacific Coast,
where the temperature was below the normal.
- probably the direct cause of the shrinkage in
the country's bank clearings, ten important cities
showing a falling off as compared with the same week
in 1897. Hut weather means much more in the East
n this coast, owing to the humidity of the East
ern climate, which renders the transaction of busi
ness a burden and keeps the mercantile element
longer than usual at the summer resorts. Still, com
mercial reports abound wit.i rosy accounts of the state
of trade throughout the land.
The situation in general was about the same as for
the preceding week. Western cities all reported -narked
activity in merchandise, and Chicago could not ship
<!ry (..icds fast enough to satisfy the demand. The
distributive trade of the Northwest, which has been
phenomenal for several months, was fully up to its
previous volume. The staples showed no change
whatever, wool and cotton being quiet, wheat un
settled and iron remarkably active. The failures of
the country numbered 142. against 173 for the same
week in 1897 and 308 in 1896. Wall street labored
under the reaction previously noted, an advance in
money rates having checked the buying demand.
The stringency was not serious, however, and will
ly disappear with the resumption of gold im
ports and anticipated action by the Government to
check the accumulation of its funds. Less favorable
â¢ ports from abroad tend to give the wheat mar
ket more tomi. though the improvement is thus far
insignificant Railway earnings continue to show a
gratifying gain, and prices for the leading lines of
merchandise are said to be the Â» T hest for five years.
These points about cover the condition of trade
throughout the country east of the Rockies.
The local situation is in fair shape. Fall trade is
opening up well as a rule, and while values for most
of the staples are stationary, there is no particular
change in any description. The fruit trade leads all
others in point of interest, and the growers are real
izing prices fully up to the anticipations of the most
sanguine. The canners have had to scramble for
choice fruit this year, to the infinite gratification of
the orchardists, and with the exception of a period of
ten days or so when the market was choked with
peaches and pears scarcity has been the rule since last
spring. It will probably be some years ere the fruit
growers of California again sell apricots at $60 per
ton, pears at $50 and peaches at $65. Nor is dried
fruit a whit behind the fresh article, the only difference
being that it is scarcer, as the fancy figures paid for
the fresh fruit cut down the usual output of dried fruit
considerably.
The grain trade of the State 5s languishing. Prices
are fair as a rule, and for several cereals they are
good. But the light output diminishes the gross
revenue materially. Wheat exports will be small this
year, and, indeed, much of the grain will come in
from the north. Provisions are moving off fairly, and
tome dealers report an increased demand. The wool,
hop and hide markets are very dull, with apparently
no desire to take hold on the part of buyers. The
animal wine question is again coming to the front, as
the grape crop in the northern part of the State, at
least, will be short, owing to the dry season, and
this may have a hardening effect on wine, which is
low at present.
Jobbers of merchandise continue to report a sat
isfactory outward movement, accompanied with com
paratively easy collections. There is a large supply of
money in the usual channels, readily available at the
regular rates of interest Failures are no more
numerous than usual at this time of the year, and are
generally small.
The bank clearings of San Francisco continue to
fall behind those of 1897, a loss in business directly
traceable to the dry winter. There is less grain to
change hands, less fruit to can and dry, less of every
thing, in fact, that the farmer produces. Consequently
there is less movement in all lines of trade, and the
result is immediately shown in decreased bank clear
ings. Still, the falling off is not serious, and, in
deed, is not as pronounced as might have been ex
pected.
Mr. William E. Costley should not be left to fight
alone the battle for the rights of the people against
Wells, Fargo & Co. Every shipper should resist the
imposition of the holy tax-shirkers. The newspapers
of the city by combining defeated the attempt of the
mrporation to rob them, and other shippers will
achieve the same result by pursuing the same policy.
It is not wholly to be regretted that under Swiss
(aw the assassin of the Empress Elizabeth cannot be
put to death. It is worth while preserving one of that
fpecies to see what can be done toward making him
repent before he dies.

THE PANAMA CANAL.
WHILE the project for constructing a ship
canal across Nicaragua remains in a condition
that may be best described as "open for dis
cussion," the Panama enterprise is moving ahead,
slowly indeed, but with sufficient momentum to jus
tify a fear that if something is not speedily done on
our part it may be completed while we are yet talk
ing, and the great waterway will be under European
instead of American control.
According to a special correspondent of the Lon
don Chronicle, whose name is not given, but who is
described by the Chronicle as a British resident of
Colon and a thoroughly experienced and competent
engineer, the outlook for the successful accomplish
ment of the great undertaking of De Lesseps is by
no means discouraging.
In his report he says the work at present is going
on but slowly and the progress is small. The enter
prise is hampered by the intrigues of the impecunious
Government of the republic and the opposition of the
Panama railway, but nevertheless something is being
done, and the labor on the canal is never wholly
stopped.
It is estimated there have been expended upon the
canal about 53,000,000 pounds sterling, and that about
Â£16,000,000 of this sum represents work actually done,
while about ii 0.000,000 more represents "experience
bought and paid for," shop machinery, buildings and
appurtenances which are necessary, and therefore of
value to those who may undertake to complete the
work within the next ten years. It is added, however,
that if the work were, to be begun over again with the
knowledge and experience now possessed, all that haÃ
been attained thus far could be duplicated for about
fifteen millions of pounds, and this sum is regarded
as a not unreasonable estimate to put upon the prop
erty of the canal company upon the isthmus.
Regarding the possibilities of the work from an
engineering point of view the correspondent says:
"I favor a sea-level canal, which I believe to be more
feasible here than a lock system canal, and quite as
economical of construction. Either can be built;
but the sea-level canal will undoubtedly give the
greater degree of satisfaction. Under competent di
rection the Panama canal can, in my opinion, be com
pleted as a sea-level canal for twenty-five or thirty
millions of pounds sterling, and the work, if taken in
hand vigorously, would be completed in ten years â
maximum."
From this showing, made upon what is presumably
a competent and impartial authority, it appears that
the French enterprise is by no means dead. Whether
it will revive to full life and draw from European cap
italists enough money to complete it will depend
upon the course taken by the United States with re
spect to the Nicaragua canal. There will be no need
of two waterways, and if our project is pushed for
ward the French scheme will be abandoned as un
profitable. If we continue to delay, however, the
Panama enterprise may be carried out. We shall
then see the consequences of hesitating in a great
movement of this kind. The waterway will be
opened, but not by American energy, nor will it be
operated in American interests.
THE CRETAN PROBLEM.
BY the outbreak of fanatic violence in Crete, re
sulting in the killing of a number of British
soldiers as well as the looting of the British and
the German consulates at Candia, the reported al
liance between Great Britain and Germany will be put
to a test that will soon make knovn to the public the
extent to which the two powers have agreed to co
operate in international affairs.
It is true the treaty as reported does not directly
refer to the Cretan question or to any other problem
growing out of the rapid degeneration of the Turk
ish empire. Such issues, however, appear to be neces
sarily involved in it by reason of their close relation
to the affairs of Egypt and Syria that are the main
and essential features of the agreement. It is clear
that if Great Britain is to be assured a quiet posses
sion of Egypt, and German interests in Syria are to be
guaranteed a peaceful development, the two powers
will have to act with a united force in maintaining
order in Crete and in all adjacent parts of the empi*e
of the Sultan.
Whatever motives of selfish gain may have moved
the British and the Germans to arrange their re
ported alliance, it is clear that joint action on their
part in Crete would be in the interests of humanity
and the welfare of the oppressed people of the island.
Events have proven that the Sultan is incapable of
fulfilling his treaty obligations and protecting Chris
tians iri his dominions. Nor, since the disastrous re
sult of the war with Turkey, can Greece be expected
to do anything to prevent the anarchy and slaughter
arising out of the antagonism between the hostile
races and religions among the inhabitants. As it
was necessary for us to intervene in Cuba, so now it
Is necessary for some power of first-class strength to
intervene in Crete.
Experience has shown that little reliance can be
placed upon the much vaunted "concert of Europe."
That institution is as yet too inchoate and confused
to act with vigor upon any issue. The reported al
liance between Great Britain and Germany, however,
furnishes exactly the power that the time and the
occasion call for. A combination controlling the
greatest fleet and the greatest army in the world, pos
sessing unlimited wealth and made up of the two most
masterful and vigorous races in Europe, could easily
settle the Cretan problem â and such is their prestige
among nations they would hardly risk a war in do
ing it, for rt is not likely that any power or combina
tion of powers would interfere with them.
This situation of affairs gives a new interest to the
old problem. The world has heard so much of Cretan
insurrections for three generations past it would pay
but little attention to the present one were it not for
the possibility that it may bring to light the terms of
the new coalition and cause the allies to make a joint
demonstration of their power in the Levant. The
crisis is like that of the suspense in a theater when
for a long time ordinary actors have gone on devel
oping a plot and the climax has been reached and the
audience waits for the stars to appear in their dom
inant roles. In the Cretan tragedy the scene is all
set, the supreme issue is reached. What will Britan
nia and Germania do when they step forth upon the
stage?
Now that arrangements have been made for ex
tending the Valley Road southward so as to have con
nection with a transcontinental system, the railroad
monopoly in the State will soon cease to exist, and
not a single agitator or yellow journal will be able
to point to the collapse of the octopus and say "I
did it" or "I helped to do it."
Along with the appointment of a committee to
investigate the conduct of the war there should be
another to investigate the conduct of the yellow jour
nals that have slandered everything connected with
the army from quartermasters to the War Depart
ment.
Several cases of wife-beating have been notable in
that the beaten wife failed to appear and beg mercy
for the brute in the dock.
THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1898.
SOMETHING of an old story is that of the
wonderful rush of the Oregon around the
Horn and her arrival at the Floridan coast in
fit condition to go at once to the fighting line of the
fleet off Santiago. It has been recounted many times
and explained in many ways. Credit for the great
performance has been given to the naval architects
who designed her, to the men who constructed her,
to her gallant commander, Captain Clark, and to her
skillful engineers. Now, however, a new explanation
of the feat has been put forth, and as it comes from
Chief Engineer Milligan himself it is of interest, not
withstanding that the story is a more than twice-told
tale.
The New York Commercial Advertiser quotes the
chief engineer as having said in a recent speech: "At
one port Captain Clark told me he wanted to make
the next port in ten hours, at fourteen knots an hour.
I told him I didn't think the men could stand the
strain. Soon afterward I found there was a meeting
among the assistant engineers, they insisting that they
could make the port in ten hours; and so we did.
The men stood three watches at the engines and two
in the fireroom. Most of our men are Pacific Slope
men."
That incident deserves commemoration among the
records of the war. There are thousands of brave
men in the armies and navies who follow
wherever their leaders go, and obey without hesita
tion every word of command. The engineers of the
Oregon, however, showed a courage and ardor of
patriotism above that. After their officers had de
cided that a certain work desirable in itself would
impose too great a strain upon them they held a
council of their own and insisted upon undertaking
the task. Their enthusiasm had its way, and their
physical manhood as the results showed proved equal
to the strenuous task their valiant souls had
prompted.
Due attention must also be given to the statement
of the chief engineer, "Most of our men are Pacific
Slope men." Among the people of the East there is
a vague theory that the mildness of the Pacific climate
and the absence of what they call "the bracing rigors
of winter" tend to weaken the muscular and the ner
vous strength of the white race â producing a sort of
low vitality like that of the inhabitants of tropic
countries.
A multitude of victories by Californian champions
in all forms of athletic contests has demonstrated time
and again the falseness of the theory, but it still sur
vives. It is fitting, therefore, to impress upon the
public the fact that the heroes of the engine-room
who carried the Oregon through that record-breaking
feat were Pacific Slope men, and that they endured
the terrific strain without breaking down at any point
from the time they steamed away from California un
til they forged ahead of other warships at Santiago
and won the honors of the battle that destroyed the
fleet of Spain.
BY reason of the large supply of gold and the
comparatively scant amount of paper currency
in the East a curious illustration of the force
of habit has been furnished by that section of the
Union. It appears the people there have become so
addicted to the use of paper money by long usage
that they are unwilling to employ gold for general
circulation, notwithstanding their appreciation of it
as a standard of value.
This preference for the accustomed form of money
appears from all reports to amount to a serious evil
in the financial world. The Boston Herald says:
"The short supply of paper money is causing a good
deal of inconvenience to business and obstructing the
movement of the crops." After pointing out that
there is no real scarcity of currency, it goes on to
say: "The only trouble is that paper money cannot
be readily obtained to satisfy the demands of the
harvesting section, and that gold coin does not meet
the popular demand."
It is not in Boston and New England only that
thi.i demand for paper exist 6. The Philadelphia
Ledger says: "The United States treasury now
holds more than $206,000,000 in gold. It holds this
vast amount largely because it cannot get rid of it.
The people do not care to be burdened with gold
.or pocket money, when paper is so much more con
venient to carry." The Philadelphia Record con
cedes that this statement is in the main correct, but
maintains that the preference for paper money is con
fined to the cities, while it will have been noted that
the Boston Herald asserts the demand for paper
comes from the harvesting districts.
As a matter of fact, it appears the whole Eastern
section of the country, cities and rural districts alike,
den.ands the familiar paper; and so annoying to
financiers has this demand become that the treasury
officials at Washington are quoted as having ex
pressed the opinion that the people should be com
pelled to use gold so as to correct wTiat one of them
has called "their vicious preference for paper."
This statement has roused the wrath of Boston and
the Herald of that city, after referring to it as an
'assumption characteristic of the official mind," re
torts with some indignation: "Uncfe Sam does not
take kindly to the idea of using either gold or silver
coin in circulation. He likes paper money. He
want? it kept as good as gold, but he does not want
to carry the latter about in his pockets. His choice
should be respected, and, in point of fact, it will have
to be."
The whole controversy is a striking proof of the
domination of habit over the human mind. It will
be news to Californians that Uncle Sam does not
take kindly to the idea of using either gold or silver
coin in circulation. In this State our honored uncle
has never used anything else. The Philadelphia
Record speaks of bank notes as being "almost always
foul smelling and filthy from constant handling," and
thiÂ« being so it would appear that the Washington
official was correct in describing the Eastern fond
ness for paper as a "vicious preference."
Altogether the situation is amusing. A thirsty
Kentuckian, crying "Water, water everywhere and
not a drop to drink." has no quandary equal to the
perplexity of financiers with gold, gold everywhere
and no money to meet the popular demand.
Up to this time more wealth has come from the
Klondike than has been caried in, but matters are
rapidly taking an opposite turn, and before lonjj a
statement of the balance of trade will make an
EBkimo smile.
In the confusion camp some are Democrats, some
are Populists and some are Silver Republicans, but
the sandlotters lead them all.
Whenever the campaign becomes too hot for him
Maguire can console himself with the reflection that
a cold day is coming.
It is not certain whether John J. Valentine prayed
or swore when he heard of the Costley suit, but his
language was Biblical.
There is reason to believe the Maguire boom would
run better if Gallagher would let her go.

THE PAPER MONEY HABIT.
DEVELOPMENT OF THE SUN SPOT.
The general large sun spot Is composed of many sections more or less
scattered, but that of September 2 was one enormous single spot, about
51,000 miles In diameter. Adjacent to Its eastern side were two almost Im
perceptible markings which began to develop on September 7, and have
since become three penumbral tracts, thus forming In all a group extending
over an area about 140,000 miles In length. One* of these tracts spread into
connection with the large spot, which is otherwise little changed except
from the effects of a less foreshortened view.
At the time of writing It shows some symptoms of scattering, but will
probably remain visible for some days yet. Having kept a record of solar
disturbances for eleht years past, I find that It has been equaled in size
and conspicuousness by only three or four groups during that period.
September 10, 1898. ROSE O'HALLORAN.
WHITE MEN IN THE TROPICS.
As It Is With the Englishman, So Will It Be With
the American,
From the London Speaker, August 27.
There is a mural inscription In the old church on the Chelsea embank
ment which describes France as our inveterate enemy, and though we have
been for eighty-three years at peace with the French people there are
doubtless some Englishmen who still think of France as the worst enemy
of Anglo-Saxon expansion. We venture to think they are mistaken.
France is not our worst enemy, nor Germany, nor Russia. Malarial fever is
the most deadly of all. The question whether Englishmen or Americans
can exercise with advantage permanent dominion in the tropics depends
mainly on whether they can succeed in mastering tropical disease. The
question arises in India, in Africa, in Cuba and Manila; it may arise be
fore long in Southern China; in all essentials it is the same question every
where. The waste of life and of vital energy in the tropics is the gravest
difficulty of empire. Let us see roughly what it means. We have ruled India
for more than a century. The native people are, with few exceptions,
peaceful and docile and industrious beyond compare. They produce a large
proportion of men of ability who can be trusted in all but the very highest
places of government. The small military population of the north produces
some excellent soldiers. The Government has been organized so as to re
quire the services of aa few Europeans as possible, and private traders pro
ceed on the same system. India is therefore run by a white population of
150.000, of whom half are soldiers. Yet the difficulty of maintaining that
force is enormous. The average Indian life c-f the Staff Corps officer or civil
lan is between twenty-five and thirty years, if his health lasts, as against
forty-five years at home. Yet the term cannot be extended. To get men to
stay so long, the pension has to be enormously increased as a reward for
the last few years of service, and the pension is earned at the risk of phys
ical or mental collapse. The Britisher in India, is past his best at forty-five,
when he would only just have reached full intellectual maturity at home.
The rank and file of the soldiers do not stay on the average more than
four or five years in India, but it is quite enough for most of them. Making
all allowances for the vicious habits of a few stigmatized by the Comman
der-in-Chlef, the main cause of the decrepitude or industrial inefficiency of
so many who have returned from India is the climate. The climate of In
dia threatens to destroy our system of voluntary military service.
India has been so long governed by England that care can be taken,
except on the frontier, to locate troops and other "whites in comparatively
healthy settlements. A considerable part of Northern India is not technic
ally wtthin the tropics, and there are plenty of hill stations. Thus there
are advantages in Tndia as compared with many other hot countries. A few
years ago some enthusiasts told us that Africa was to be quite a different
place; that In the high lands of the center white men would be able to live,
and breed and rear their children â become colonists, in fact, and not merely
administrators. Sir John Pope Hennessy, who had not stewed in Lagos
for five years without learning to see the worst side of things, always dis
counted these optimistic prophecies. He told us that tropical Africa could
never become a white man's country. It may be he was wrong, but he has
not yet been proved wrong. The enthusiast's idea was that altitude was
more important than latitude. Get away from the marsh lands by the sea
and malaria would be left behind. We never felt much confidence in thrrse
promises of good health for Britons if they got away from the sea.. Even
in the tropics the sea gives health. The best hope for the fever-stricken man
is to get him on shipboard. In the Interior he has a slightly less chance of
catching fever, but he is more likely to die if he catches it. These high
lying health resorts somehow belle their first promise. Uganda is very high
up, but only exceptionally tough men can stand its climate. The country
on the way to it is so pestiferous that Sir Arthur Hardinge recommends
that no more workmen should be sent there from Northern India: they
cannot live in this terrible land. There is a poor chance for the English
man where the Hindoo cannot survive. Nyassaland is also turning out badly.
The death rate among the whites has gene up to 100 per thousand. The
last report from the Governor shows the climate to be the real difficutly.
Fever extends much farther south. Black-water fever has been known in the
Bechuanaland Protectorate at an altitude of over SOOO feet, and on the 20th
parallel of latitude, and that in a great thirst land where there is scarcely
a spring, much less a marsh. The Americans in Cuba are already finding
malaria worse than the Spaniard.
It is said that Mr. Chamberlain Intends to tackle the problem by ap
pointing a small commission of eminent medical men, who are to visit the
Gold Coast in the healthy season. We cannot hope very much from this
#troke of statecraft. British troops have stewed in that "little military hot
house," Malta, for a century, but no doctor has discovered a specific for
the type of recurrent malaria known as Maltese fever. So far the only
medical discovery which was thought to have made European life in the
tropics less deadly was the use of quinine. But the merciless Dr. Koch has
recently produced strong reasons for believing that quinine does more
harm than good. He has discovered that since quinine came into use, ma
laria has been much less common among women than among men. For
well-known reasons, women cannot take as much quinine as men. and do
not. In fact, dose themselves with it as men do. Hence he argues that qui
nine may, in its reaction, predispose to fever. We are not quite convinced,
and would, indeed, put to him another question. Why is it that Spaniards
and Portuguese can live and thrive after a fashion where Englishmen can
not? It may be partly because they nre bred in a warmer climate. It
may be partly because they have less objection to miscegenation, and there
fore live In different relations toward no five women. It may be partly bÂ«
mOBt they drink less spirits. But we venture to believe that the main rea
pon If because, like English women, they work less than do Englishmen. The
vrry vigor which we bring with us from our island home, and which has
enab>d us to piok up the ri^r.^Ft bits of the world for our race, is, In a
sense, our undoing. A white man can live In the South, but he must be
content to vegetate there. Englishmen prefer to work and die rather than
vegetate, and somehow we cannot wish it otherwise.
We have no wish to see a new race of English-speaking men who could
live but could not work any better than Spaniards can work. E\ r ery race has
its suitable environment: ours is in the temperate zone. Of course, it may be
worth our while to sacrifice a moderate number of lives year by year in order
to keep open tropical markets and govern and civilize tropical peo
ples. But there must be no foolish misapprehension about the meaning of
these acquisitions. So long as the tropics are fatal to full vigor, conquests
in the tropics cannot be spoken of as an expansion of England, like settle
ments In North America or in Australia. They may be markets but they
cannot be homes. It Is, perhaps, just as well that the Americans likewise
should have had to face this fundamental difficulty at so early a stage of
their colonial conquests. They may perhaps face it in a different way from
us. The bodily frame of the Yankee Is not a bit more Immune from mala
ria than ours, though it may be that the inhabitants of the Gulf States
have acquired a certain immunity on the principle of the survival of the
fittest. But the American, owing to his more mixed origin, has a power of
absorbing and utilizing other races which the Englishman has not Possibly
the Americans will be able, in Cuba and Porto Riro, at least to evolve out
of the . Spaniards, who can stand the climate, a race with powers of gov
ernance. But we fancy that for many years, at least, their new possessions
will mean to them, as India and Africa mean to us. a heavy if necessary
sacrifice. What statistician has ever been able to figure un the mat n * â¢ o

WARSHIPSâ W. S., Lemoore, Cal. In
times of peace the war ships of the Uni
ted States are painted either white, ligtet
yellow or some other light color. In tiro*
of war they are painted black for tttÂ«
reason that a black ship is not so prom

as one painted of a light color.
EVENING SCHOOLâ C. T., City. The
evening school known as the Humboldt
Evening School, located in the school
building on Golden Gate avenue, near
Hyde street, is a free public school. This
is no reason why young ladies who at
tend there cannot take the course in ar
chitectural drawing.
FOREIGN CARRYING TRADEâ J. M ,
City. The statistics on commerce and
navigation are silent as to the amount
that is paid yearly in the United States
to foreign ships, but the statistics show
that the value of the foreign carrying
trade for several years past will average
$1,500,000,000.
TO CLEAN SATINâ Mrs. X., City.
The following is given as a method to
clean satin: "Four ounces of soft boo?,
four ounces of honey the whitevof an egg
and a wineglassful of gin, mixed well
together. With this mixture scour tha
article (which must be unpicked and laid
in widths on a table; a kitchen table win
do) with a rather hard brush, thorough
ly; afterward rinse it in cold water, loave
to drain and iron while quite damp with
a piece of thin muslin between it an-1 tha
iron, or it will be marked on tae ironed
side. Tne satin, when laid on the table,
must be kept quite smooth, so that every
part may come under the brush."
MOTHSâ E.. Lone Pine, Cal. Motha
deposit their eggs in early spring. If al
lowed to remain in the dark, the articles
in which such deposits are made facili
tate the breeding of the worms which
come from these eggs, and it is the worm
that does the mischief. The articles
should, before being put away for any
length of time, be aired, well shaken,
and, if clothing, be beaten with a light
rattan, then wrapped in freshly printed
newspaper, as printing ink is something
that will prevent the approach of motha.
Camphor is also an excellent article for
keeping away moths, but is not desirable
to use with fur, as It has a tendency to
turn the color of the fur a lighter shade.
Articles that are put away should be ta
ken out and aired in the sun at least once
a month. If that is done and newspapers
or camphor is used there will not be any
ravages by moths.
MINING LAWâ Miner, Coulterville, Cal.
This department is unable to find any
law of California that requires that work
to the extent of $50 shall be done on a
mining claim before notice can be record

in 1891 which says: Whenever any mine
owner, company or corporation shall have
performed the labor and made the im
provements required by law for the loca
tion and ownership or mining claims or
lodes, such owner, company or corpora
tion shall file or cause to be filed, within
thirty days after the time limited for per
forming such labor or making such im
provements with the Recorder of Deeds
in the county in which the mine or claim
is situated an affidavit as to the labor
performed and Improvements made and

Miss Bouton Buoys
Up Her Baron.
HAS HAD ANOTHER RELAPSE
WASTED TO SKELETON ON HER
BED OF PAIN.
Nevertheless She Only Postpones
Her Marriage to Yon Nimptsch
Until After Her Re
covery.
Serious and prolonged illness has post
; ; the happiest wont of Madeline
i ma lifeâ her marriage to Baron
Guhlo yon Ximptsch. The charming and
popular actress still lies impatiently in a
.at ie McNutt Hospital, where
she went on August 1 to undergo a sur
gical operation. Soon after the operation
and while she was apparently on the road
to recovery she suffered a relapse, and
for some time her life hung tremblingly
in the balance. Her condition, however,
in a few days took a turn for the better,
end one uay last week she got out of bed
and dressed and wrote several letters, one
tich was to Baron yon Nimptsch.
She over-exerted herself, and the result
a Becond relapse, and she is again a
â > erj sick woman. She has wasted away
mere sk-'ieton, but nevertheless her
Jan has no doubt of her ultimate
cry, although it will necessarily be
very slow, which will be very trying in
deed to Miss Bouton. who expected to g<>
Kast at the end of this month.
Jt was the intention of Baron yon
Nimptsch to come to San Francisco ami
marry Miss Kuuton here, Cut it has now
been decided that the wedding shall take
jilace either in New York or Germany
when circumstances shall permit. The
report that Huron yon Nimptsch is at
\t in this country is denied by Miss
n, who says that he is in German}
and in proof of this fact she exhibits a
letter from him dated August 21, at
nbof, his sister's residence. Sho
eta another letter from him this

"If he were in this country," said Miss
Bouton, "lie would now be at my bed

A KLONDIKER`S
GRUBSTAKE
Charles Lamb Declares
It Was a Loan.
TROUBLE OVER A STAKE
WILL OPPOSE THE MEN WHO
WANT A DIVISION.
The Los Angeles Miner Denies the
Allegations of His Friends
Who Loaned Him
Money.
Charles Lamb, one of the successful
miners of the Klondike, has returned to
this city to enjoy his hard-earned wealth.
His advent here will not be altogether a
tour of comfort and enjoyment, if the ad
vices recelvc-d from Los Angeles are cor
rect. There are several men in that city
who will contest in court the right of
Lamb to retain the vast amount of money
which he is reported to have taken out of
his mine. They claim that it In part be
longs to them, as they grub-staked the
successful Lflmh previous to his departure
for the Northwest In ISS6.
The men who assert that they are enti
tled to a portion of the earnings of Lamb
are N. P. Prince, George W. Verger,
Charles A. Peterson, L. H. Smith and A.
L. Holloway. Lamb returned on the Port
land, which arrived in this city not many
days ago, bringing down a batch of min
ers from the Klondike. He is now stop
ping in a lodging-house on Pine street,
where he was seen yesterday in regard to
the allegations made against him by the
Los Angeles claimants.
"Not a word of it Is true," he said. "I
did not enter into any contract with those
men at all. At the time I was not in very
rood circumstances and I solicited Â« loan
from Peterson. Verger, Smith, Holloway
and Prince. They were to give me $10
apiece and for it I was to furnish them in
formation of vie country. If the country
up there proved to be such as to afford
an opprotunity for them I was to let them
know. That is why they agreed to give
me $10 apiece so that I could get off, and
if I struck anything at all to inform them,
so that they might also have a chance
at it.
"I left the city in the early part of I)>S6
and went to Forty Mile. From that place
I branched out until I struck Hunker
Creek and there located a claim which is
a pretty pood one. The reports that I
have brought down $300,000 are fabu
lous. A lot of division would be neces
sary to get at the correct sum. I earned
every cent I have and these men are not
going to get any of it. They did not even
give me at the beginning the $50 they
promised. 1 got $25 of it and some time
nfter they gave the rest to my wife. It
was a loan merely and not a grub-stake.
"I notified these men about the wealth
of the country and they went up there.
Why. they did not even ask for any divi
sion in the Klondike. They did not want
me to give them any share of what the
claim was producing, but they did ask
for favors. I helped all of them out and
on many occasions, particularly Prince
and Holloway. When they were up in the
territory they did not want anything and
now that they are here they think that
they can get a divvy."
Lamb was very reticent about the value
of his claims and the amount of money
he cleaned up. He is inclined to put a
wet blanket over the reports of his
strike on Huriker, but the returning Klon
dikers all say that Lamb has some very
valuable mining property, and that he
brought a good big pile of dust and bills
with him.
MILITARY MATTERS.
Troops at the Presidio Are Awaiting
the Return of General Merriam.
It is the general opinion of those who
are in a position to know that the troops
will certainly be kept at the Presidio until
General Merriam returns and makes his
report as to what disposition he thinks
should be made of the forces now here.
The question has assumed the propor
tions of a long weary wait, but even' one
is hopeful that when the general arrives
the regiments will get away to Honolulu.
The First Washington and Twentieth
Kansas regiments will be paid to-day ;ind
the Firnt Tennessee to-morrow. Orders
for a mounted escort to the paymasters
were issued yesterday by General Miller.

injured his leg and has never fully re
covered.
The report of the Board of Officers ap
pointed to assess the damages done thÂ»
property of Zero Thomas by the soldiers
of the Tennesseee Regiment, has been
submitted to Colonel Smith by General
Miller to find out what action he pro
pose? to take. The damages assessed are
comparatively small nnd will no doubt
be paid by the regiment, as Colonel Smith
has said that he intended to see that all
reparation be made to the family.
First Lieutenant Floyd W. Harris,

land upon a two weeks' leave of absence,
returned to the Presidio yesterday morn
ing and resumed his duties as Adjutant
of the Post.

Crouch, vice-president; Joseph P. Tuohey, j
secretary; Joseph Heck, treasurer, and |
John Hansen, sergeant at arms. The
ma of $35 was collected toward con- i
structing a meeting hall. The club will :
send a petition to the Board of Super- i
visors demanding that the board rescind
the extension of time granted Messrs.
Flinn & Treacy on their contract to â 
sewer Chenery street. The sewer on
Chenery street waa ordered done as a
sanitary measure over two years ago, and
Messrs. Flinn & Treacy have failed to
fulfill their contract. Their failure to do
the work has stopped building and created
a nuisance on Chenery street, therefore

to do their duty in the matter.

TIIE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1898.
A THICK SKULL
HIS SALVATION
J. M. Shaughnessy Shot
in the Forehead.
THE BULLET FLATTENED OUT
TWO BOYS FIRE AT HIM AND
THEN JUMP ON HIM.
The Young Culprits Are Arrested
Later and Booked on the Charge
of Assault to Commit
Murder.
James M. Shaughnessy, a school Janitor
living at 521^2 .Lombard street, has to
thank his thick skull lor not being on a
slab in the Morgue.
Yesterday afternoon Shaughnessy took
a ride on the cars to the Potrero. While
passing Third and Townsend streets he
tsaw Tom Canavan, engineer of Knijine
3, and his wife, and jumped off to have |
a talk with them. Then he boarded an
other car, and hearing shois In the neigh
borhood of Kentucky and Mernmac
streets he jumped ort to investigate.
When he readied the water's edge he
saw several boys bathing, and it occurred
to him that he would take off his shoes
and socks and wade in the water. Just !
then two boys about lh years of age came j
up to him and one of them said "You , |
we have got you now."
Before Shaughnessy could say or do
anything they each fired a shot at him
send he fell. Then they jumped on him
â Ad struck him on the face, cutting his
lip and ear. He yelled for help and the
two boys fled in the direction of a lum
ber yard. Policemen Mullin and McOor
mlck were notified that there was a ;
shooting racket and they hurried to the
scene. They met Shaughnessy with his :
face covered with blood, and on ques- |
tioning him he told them he did not know I
the boys and could not recognize them, j
They must have mistaken him for some j
one else, he thought.
Shaughnessy was; sent to the Receiving
Hospital in the ambulance, and Dr. Pren-
Uce found a bullet in his forehead over ]
the left eye. He soon extracted it and I
was surprised to rind it had been flattened
against the skull. It was a 32 caliber bul
let, and as the shot was fired at close ;
range the wonder is that the bullet did I
not penetrate the skull and cause death. ,
The doctors could only account for it by
the thickness of Shaughnessy's skull.
Detective Dillon was detailed on the j
case and when he Interrogated Shaugh- |
nessy he gave him a false name and re- [
peatert his story that he had done noth- i
ing when the two boys fired the shots at i
him The detective did not believe the
story, and further investigation proved
that he was right.
T.ato yesterday afternoon Sergeants
Brophy and Conboy arrested two young
men giving their names as John Thomp
son and Patrick Kelly on suspicion of
having shot Shaughnessy. They were ;
1, . ked up in the tanks pending an inves- |
tigation. Both men wore subsequently j
identified as the asallants of Shaugh- i
nossy. According to several witnesses of
the shooting. Kelly and Thompson, who
were under tho Influence of liquor, whip- â 
ped out their revolvers and commenced !
shooting over the heads of the bathers,
Shaughnessy, fearing that they would in-
Jute somebody, ordered them to cease â 
shooting. mmm\
Kelly replied that if Shaughnessy did
Dot mind his own business he would
"blow his head off." Thompson, at this
juncture, stepped up to Shaughnessy :
and attempted to strrke htm over the ,
head with his revolver.
Thinking that the drunken ruffians were
trying" to "run a bluff." as he expressed
It. Shaughneasy determined to show
them that they could not intimidate him.
Walking up to Thompson ho proceeded
to chastise him, when Kelly aimed his re
volver at his head and fired.
Afi he fell wounded to the ground, both
the men struck him over the head with \
their weapons, inflicting several scalp i
They then repeatedly kicked him and,
had It not been for several citizens who ;
interfered they wound have killed him.
Shortly afterward the two men ran
down Kentucky street and made their i
Sergeants Conbov and Brophy, assisted
by a number of police officers, started out
to find them. After considerable trouble
they located them in a house on Shipley
street near Fifth. They offered no re
pistance when told that they wore under
arrest, and were at once taken to the
Receiving Hospital to be identified by
1 They were afterward taken before Cap
tain Spillane and closely questioned.
The prisoners dented that they shot
Shaughnessy, but admitted that they
wore in the vicinity at the time of the
was still suffering from the
effects of an overindulgence in liquor, and
in a boisterous manner he defied Cap
tain Spillane to lock him up.
"Wove got a pull, declared Kelly,
"you know better than to throw us In
your duty, gentlemen," replied
Captain Spillane to his two sergeants as
they seized Thompson and Kelly and
hustled them across the yard and into
the City Prison.

Troops From Porto Rico
to Be Reviewed.
BY ORDER OF GENERAL MILES
NEXT SATURDAY NIGHT fHE
TIME SET.
The Home-Comers Will Prjbably Be
Concentrated at Seag-irt, an
Excellent New Jersey-
Camp.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 11.â Deputy Quar
termaster Kimball to-day received an
order from General Miles, setting forth
that a parade of the returning Porto
Rican troops will take place in this city
on Saturday night. Colonel Kimball
was instructed to propose a suitable
camp for the men who are on their
way from Ponce in the Government
transports.
As soon as Colonel Kimball received
the order he communicated with Gov
ernor Voorhees of New Jersey to con
sult as to- the establishment of a tem
porary camp at Seagirt. Early in the
war Governor Voorhees offered to the
War Department the use of the camp
at Seagirt, and the site was inspected
by the surgeon general's assistants.
The mess halls and the kitchens erected
and the accommodations for the troops
are said to be excellent. There is plenty
of water and the camp is in a healthy
location. Colonel Kimball desires to
know if the camp is still available. No
agreement was reached to-day, though
it is probable that the camp at Seagirt
will be used.
The transports Concho and Alamo are
on their way from Ponce and they are
expected to arrive this week. Though
none of the arrangements have been
decided upon it is mo-re than probable
that the event Will be made the occa
sion of a grand review of all troops
that are able to take part, whether
they have taken part in the Porto Ri
can campaign or not. The troops that
arrived In the city on the Mississippi
Will take part in the parade. These in
clude Troops A and C, as well as the
Pennsylvania troops that returned with
them.

Army Corps and staff of the Sixth
Army Corps; detachment of United
States Engineers, Company C, unat
tached artillery, battery, field and staff;
Battery A, Missouri Volunteers; Bat

REWAPOS FOR OFFICERS
AND ENLISTED MEN
Rules Under Which Promotions and
Medals Will Be Awarded
in the Army.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 11.â War De
partment has issued an order directing the
commanding officers of military depart
ments, army corps and detached com
mands to send to the adjutant general as
soon as practicable the names of such offi
cers In the regular and volunteer service
as may be considered entitled to brevet
commands for "distinguished conduct and
public service in the presence of thÂ©
enemy."
Rules have also been issued governing
the award of medals to officers and en
listed men as follows: Medals of honor
will not be awarded to officers or en
listed men except fur distinguished brav
ery or conspicuous gallantry which shall
have been manifested :In action -by con
duct that distinguishes a soldier above
his comrades, and that involves risk of
life, or the performance of more than
ordinarily hazardous duty. Recommenda
tions for the award will be governed by
this interpretation of extraordinary
merit.
Recommendations should be. made only
by the officer In command at the time of
the "action," or by an officer having per
sonal cognizance of the specific act for
which the medal Is granted. The recom
mendation must be accompanied by a
detailed recital of the circumstances *r
by certificates of officers or affidavits of
enlisted men who were eye-witnesses of
the act.
The testimony must, when practicable,
embrace that of a least two witnesses
and must describe especially the act or
acts by which the person In whose behalf
the recommendation is made "most dis
tinguished" himself, and the facts In the
case must be furnished by the official re
ports of the action/record of events, mus
ter rolls and returns and descriptive lists.
WAITING ORDERS FOR
FURLOUGHFD OFFICERS
War Department Announcement
That Will Facilitate Making
of Changes.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 11.â General order
139, published from the War Department,
directs that all commissioned officers be
longing to regiments furloughed for sixty
days be placed upon waiting orders in
stead of being furloughed like their
troops. This will facilitate the making
of any changes In the orders to regiments,
will give the officers better pay and af
ford the department a closer hold upon
them In case of need.
Another paragraph of the order places
upon the commanding officers at hospitals
the responsibility for deciding whether or
not soldiers sent home on sick furlough
shall have sleeping car accommodations,
and requires the quartermaster who Is to
be stationed at every general hospital to
honor any such requisitions.
BIG CONTRACTS FOR
SMOKELESS POWDER
Dupont and California Powder Works
Will Each Supply Half a
Million Pounds.
NEW YORK, Sept. It.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Upon the
recommendation of Captain O'Xetll, the
Navy Department, has awarded con
tracts for the manufacture of a million
pounds of smokeless powder to the Du
pont Powder Works and the California
Powder Works. Each firm will manu
facture half a million pounds. Cost will
be about $.800,000. As a result of the bat
tles of Slanlla and Santiago It is extreme
ly doubtful If the one-pounder pun will
be retained In the naval service as a feat
ure of the rapid-firinK batteries of men
of-war. The ranpre of this weapon Is not
Kreat enough, to satisfy ordnance experts
and Captain O'Neill proposes to replace,
it with three and six pounders, operated
by a semi-automatic system.

CAMP WIKOFF, Montauk Point,
Sept. 11. â A fall of ten degrees In the
temperature was experienced last
night. The cold wave was accompanied
by a high wind, which for several hours
threatened to blow down the tents.
The storm moderated toward morning.
The three trains that arrived to-day
brought from New York a large num
ber of Sunday visitors, who spent sev
eral hours inspecting the camp.
The transport Saratoga arrived from
Santiago to-day with about sixty
members of the Signal Corps, in com
mand of Lieutenant Colonel Frank
Green. The Saratoga also brought 250
negro laborers, who were sent to San
tiago several months ago to act as
teamsters, drivers, stevedores, etc. Two
of the negroes died of malarial fever
on the voyage. Twelve men were sick
when the steamer reached here, and
were taken to the detention hospital.
None of the cases are considered se
rious. The members of the Signal
Corps aboard were taken to the de
tention camp. The Saratoga will be
fumigated and will then go to New
York, where the negroes will land.
Colonel Roosevelt expects to have his
regiment of Rough Riders mustered out
on Thursday, when the men will go to
their homes. The officers and men of
the regiments are preparing to present
to Colonel Roosevelt a testimonial of
their regard in the form of a small
bronze statue designed by Frederick
Remington, the artist.
The general belief in Camp Wikoff to
day is that great changes will be seen
here before the present week is over.
Reports are circulated freely that Gen
eral Miles has assumed the active di
rection of the affairs of the camp and
that he intends to have all regular
troops removed from here as aoon as
possible and sent to regular army
posts.
General Bates, who is now in com
mand of Camp Wikoff. admitted to-day
that new orders had been received
from Washington in regard to the dis
position of the snlrliers here, and the
general understanding is that they will
be moved away as rapidly as possible.

FOR FREEDOM
THE CHAMPION
Wins the Stake at Union
Coursing Park.
RESULT NEVER IN DOUBT
WAIT A LITTLE CAPTURES THE
PRODUCE PRIZE.
Defeats Billy Gladstone for One of
the Classic Events of the Year.
Morning Glory Also
"*â¢ Wins.
For Freedom, the Invincible, all-con
quering representative of J. H. Rosseter,
romped away with the champion stake at
Union Coursing Park yesterday. He was
drawn against Curtis & Son's great bitch,
Rosette, in the first round and an un
usually large- crowd of leashmen went to
the park to see the crack daughter of
Emm Pasha make the English dog ex
tend himself.
Unfortunately, her kennel mate, Vanity
Fair, bit her and she was not fit to go to
the slips. For Freedom, In consequence
ran a bye In the first round. In the next
he met Theron, and, although he ran
sluggishly, he yon handily. However,
this served as a pipe-open and he retired
Maud S to her kennel without difficulty.
This brought him into the final, where
he met Lord Byron. He was made a pro
hibitive favorite, the odds ruling ten to
one. He led across the field scoring re
peatedly. The hare favored Lord Byron
for a while, but he could not overcome
the lead of For Freedom, who was re
turned the winner by Judge Bell.
The Produce stake, one of the classic
events of the year among coursing men,
being a companion race to the futurity
among horsemen, was won by T. Barre's
Walt a Little. The earlier rounds were
disposed of on Friday and Saturday, leav
ing only the crack dogs to contest yester
day. Walt a Little led up from Blips,
turned the hare and scored a number or
points before Gladstone was placed. The
latter could not even up the score before
the hare disappeared through the escape.
The selling stake was won by Morning
Glory, a two to fivo favorite. White Lily
was the runner uu. The former was bid
in for the owner at $230 and the latter for
HBS. Â ,
The attendance was unusually large
yesterday and In fact for the three days.
* A meeting of the committee appointed
by the Inter-State Coursing Club to ar
range for an open meeting at Merced,
was held during the afternoon, Neither
the date nor the location was definitely
Bdected. Several places were offered. The
meeting will probably be held late in >.o
vember at which time the early rains
will have prepared the Holds for the dogs.
The patrons of the park were afforded
miserable service by the Southern Pacific
Company. With the exception of one
car the" two afternoon trains were made
up 'of old-fashioned emigrant cars, with
iron Beats. Three extra cars were at
tached to the evening trainâ or these

MIAXMO IS CHAMPION.
She Captured the Stake at Ingleside
Yesterday in Handy Fashion.
The attendance at the Ingrleslde Cours
ing Park was unusually large yesterday,
owing, no doubt, to fine weather. The
sport was good and everybody seemed to
go away satisfied. In the maiden stake.
Master Mat won first money and Lanky
Bob, who was primed for the occasion
on stimulant, secured the place. He would
undoubtedly have won the stake but in
the bye he ran before the finals he was
up against a hare that was a regular
"nail driver" and simply wore him out,
spoiling his chance as a stake winner.
D. Shannon's young dog Safeguard also
ran a very severe course with Mystic and
was consequently withdrawn on account
of the severe grilling the dog had under
gone.
In the Champion stake, Mialmo was de
clared winner and Flying Buck, of lurch
er fame, was runner up. Koolawn ran in
good form until the third round, when
he became very wild and was off his
game during most of the course.
The betting public broke about even.
At the commencement of the day a num
ber of short bidders won, but toward trie
close of the racing the hounds were run
ning more to form and long shot and
short enders were conspicuous by their
absence. The results follow:

RATHER BE DEAD THAN ALIVE.
Willard D. Baker, ex-Secretary to the United States
Minister in Japan, Attempts to Commit Suicide.
Wlllard D. Baker, who until six weeks ago occupied the position of
secretary of the United States legation at Toklo, Japan, and private sec
retary to Hon. A. E. Buck, the United States Minister, attempted to com
mit suicide yesterday morning: in
the Clifford House, 204 Ellis street,
where he roomed.
Baker arrived In the city on Au
gust 17 from Japan and registered
at the Occidental Hotel. He re
mained there a week and then
took a room In the Clifford House.
Yesterday morning: about 10
o'clock the Japanese servant's at
tention was attracted by a strong
smell of gas In the corridor of
the second floor. He Investigated
every room but could not locate
the leak. As a last resort he
tried the toilet room, but found
the door locked. This aroused his
suspicion, and entering the room
adjoining: he crawled out of the
window and made his way into
the room. He found Baker lying
unconscious on the floor and the
gas escaping from the burner.
The tip had been taken off by
Baker so as to allow the fullest
possible escape of gas. The ser
vant Immediately ran outside and
notified Policemen Burns and
Hightower, who rang for the am
bulance and carried Baker out
Into the street. He was taken to
the Receiving Hospital where the
usual remedies were applied and
he quickly revived.
Baker was very reticent and refused to talk. He admitted, however,
that he had "fallen all to pieces." as he expressed it, from drink, and
would rather be dead than alive. His money was all gone and he had
been forced to pawn his watch.
From papers in his possession It appears that he resigned his position
In Japan about the end of July to start in the oil business in Chicago.
He had been in correspondence with Swain's Lubricator Company In Chi
cago with that object in view. There was a letter from Minister Buck
to the Collector of Customs, Tacoma, dated July 28, requesting that the
usual courtesies be extended to Baker on his arrival there. He had also
a letter of introduction to H. J. McCoy, of the Young Men's Christian
Association, which he had apparently not delivered, and several cards of
saloonkeepers and pawnbrokers.
His family live in Augusta, Me., and one of his sister 9 is now In Japan

HUNTER FIRES INTO
A RANCH HOUSE
Mistakes a Lamp for a Deer's Eye
and Fatally Wounds a Little
Girl.
SAN RAFAEI,, Sept 11.â News reached
this city to-night of an accident at In
verness, near Point Reyes, last night,
which may cost the life of the 14-year-old
daughter of a prosperous farmer, named
Berry. Mr. and Mrs. Berry and their
two children, a boy and a girl, were sit
ting: around the supper table shortly after
dark, eating their evening meal, when the
crack of a rifle was heard In the distance
and simultaneously with the report a
rifle ball crashed through the window.
The bullet first struck the little boy, who
was seated near the window, in the
shoulder and glancing from a bone entered
the abdomen of the daughter.
The cries of the wounded children,
drove the poor wife nearly frantic, and
Berry bad considerable trouble calming
her sufficiently to leave her in charge of
the children while he ran for a doctor.
Ab soon as the physician arrived he per
ceived that the boy's wound was super
ficial, but that the girl was perhaps fatal
ly wounded. All the medical assistance
possible was rendered her, but protlng
failed to find the bullet and to-day she
was taken to San Francisco for skillful
treatment.
It was learned to-day that the bullet
was fired by a hunter named Scribes. lie
said that he had been looking for deer.
and in the gloom thought he perceived
a gleaming eye a short distance away and
fired. The eye could have been nothing
more nor less than the lamp In the farm
er's dining-room. Scribes' carelessness is
censured and if the girl dies he may be
arrested.
HOLDS TWO THOUSAND
SHEEP FOR TRESPASS
Arrowhead Reservoir Company Be
gins the Fight Against Illegal
Foraging.
SAN BERNARDINO, Sept. 11.â The
first steps toward suppressing Illegal for
aging on the San Bernardino forest reser
vation by sheep owners was taken yester
day when the Arrowhead Reservoir Com
pany eorraied 2000 sheep atier warning
the herder off Its raluable l!tt!e Bear Val
ley tract, and are holding them for tres-
pass. The condition Is becoming serious
on the reserve, threatening theÂ» water
supply of the valley. Last spring the
Government decided to put patrolmen on
the reserve and grant the sheepmen the
privilege of drivlii" across under Govern
ment guides to leased grazing ground on
the other side; but It added the proviso
that the sheep men pay the guides Jl CO
a day each, hence it wants the guides'
Interest, as well as to the sheep men's, to
go slow. Thus immense tracts have been
grazed over. The sheep eat everything
grown, even young trees, standing oh
their hind legs to strip the bark and
â¢branches as high up as they can reach.
The ground is left unprotected and is
washed away easily by rains and water
not retained by the soil.
The number of sheep on the reserve Is
enormous.

AN ALL-COMERS' MATCH.
Utschig, Bremer, Rodgers and Mason
Well to the Front â Inde
pendent Rifles' Prize
Contests.
One of the principal events of yester
day's shoot at the Shell Mound rifle range
was a record-breaking string by Fred P.
Schuster of the Germania Schuetzen Club.
In a ten shot run in the |75 diamond
medal match he made 24, 2H, 23, 25, 24. 21.
22, 24, 25, 21â234, German twenty-five ring
target count. This is without doubt the
highest score ever made on this coast on
the target named in a regular program
med match. Schuster's new mark
will give the Eastern shots something to
think of for some time.
To the ordinary observer the day for
rifle shooting was perfect, but It was not
all satisfactory to the riflemen. A little
wind to carry off the heated air that
arose from the range would have been
acceptable, and with one or two excep
tions the murksmen voted to call It a
"hoodoo" day. Following on the lead of
Schuster, and In the same match, came
John Utschig, who made a creditable score
of 228 In ten shots. O. A. Bremer of the
Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club carried
off the honors, by making 51, Columbia
target count, on his medal string, in the
same club, D. W. McLaughlln pulled
ahead In the ten score all-comers rllle
match, his total now standing Â«0 points.
On* of the principal events n tne park
and range was the twenty-first annual
picnic and prize shooting of the Independ
ent Ritters. All of the members and their
families were In attendance and the ladies
and their escorts enjoyed dancing and the
other amusements that go with auch

the day on the range shooting for a largÂ«
number of cash and merchandise prizes.

Chosen Men Reluctant
to Serve.
M'KINLEY IS DISAPPOINTED
GORDON, LINCOLN AND LAMONT
DECLINE.
Dr. Keene and Generals Schofield,
Manderson and Saxton Have
Accepted Places on the
Commission.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 11.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Presi
dent McKlnley is experienceing diffi
culty in procuring men of prominence
to serve on the committee to Investi
gate the conduct of the war. Of nine
members selected, and whose names
were published In the Herald this
morning, three have declined to serve,
and several others have asked for time
to consider the matter. Up to this
time only four of the nine are likely to
be sure to serve â Dr. W. H. Keene of
Philadelphia, Lieutenant General Scho
field, General Manderson and General
James Saxton.
General J. B. Gordon and former Sec
retaries of War Lincoln and Lamont
have declined to serve â all on account
of ill-health.
The President, I understand, is great
ly disa^- olnted by the letters of decli
nation he has received. He takes the
ground that the duty is an important
one â as important in a certain sense
as a call to arms. He Is particularly
anxious to make the committee a
strong one, and the list which he made
un comprises men of such high char
acter as to leave no doubt as to his
sincerity of purpose in making the in
vestigation thorough and effective.
Tho War Department had a compar
atively r-ulet day, although the ad
jutant general's office was open
throughout the day, expediting the
mustering out and furlouerhing of
troops in various sections. General
Corbin made his usual call on the
President to-night to sum up the de
velopments of the day, but he said
there was nothing of an important
character. No word had come from
Manila.
There are no more volunteer troops
at Montauk Point, eleven regiments of
regulurs beln" the only troops remain
ing, except those detained in hospitals.
General Corbin says Camp Wlkoff has
practically completed the service for
which It was established, but that no
final conclusion has been reached yet
as to the ordering away the remaining
regiments and disposing of the camp.
ALGER PLEASED WITH
M'KINLEY'S SELECTIONS
DETROIT, Sept. 11.â Secretary Alger
this afternoon expressed himself as well
pleased at the President's selection of
members of the commlslon to Investi
gate the condition of the commissary,
quartermaster and medical depart
ments of the War Department during
the war. On the subject of sickness
among the soldiers, General Alger
said:
"The whole trouble has been in the
volunteer troops not knowing how to
care for themselves and carelessness in
warding off disease. The regular men
have not been troubled as the volun
teers have. They have had yellow
fever and fevers from exposure in the
trenches before Santiago, but their gen
eral health has been good and the pro
portion of sickness and deaths from
sickness Is very small.
"The most stringent orders have been
issued In regard to keeping the camps
clean. After my tour of inspection, I
will go over the whole situation care
fully and it is possible that a new set
of regulations that will be better, may
be Issued.
"The day before I left Washington,"
said General Alger, "I called Surgeon
General Sternberg Into my office and
told him I wanted to build winter hos
pitals for six thousand men. We will
have our hospitals if we have to raise
the six thousand to sixty thousand.
They will be located at points where
they can be reached by transports, al
though just where, it is not yet deter
mined. One of the hospitals, however,
will be at Havana. It will be built just
as soon as our troops are sent to the
island. I do not know what they have
in the city in the shape of hospitals
now, but I very much doubt if we
would want to take any of their in
fected buildings for hospitals for our
soldiers."
Brigadier General Duffield arrived
home to-day from the coast of Maine,
where he has been recuperating from
illness contracted during the Santiago
campaign. Secretary Alger visited him
this evening.
CHILE GATHERING DVTA
REGARPING OUR WAR
Making Use of the Lessons It Taught
in Preparation for a Clash
With Argentina.
NEW YORK, Sept. 11.â A Washington
npeclal to the Herald says: In anticipa
tion of a conflict with Argentina, agents
of Chile are scouring all available data
from American officers regarding their ex
periences in the late war with Spain, in
order that the navy of their Government
may be heneflted by tha lessons which
it taught.
This statement Is made on the best au
thority and Is an indication of the strain
ed relations existing between the two
countries. It is violating no Confidence
to say that the representatives of Chile,
who have been collecting the information,
have not waited for the mails to carry
what they learned to Santiago, ijut tli'e
cable has been freely used in order that
their Government may have all the tlmo
possible to take advantage of the lessons
whicii the recent war taught. It has been
the aim of Amerlcfin officers to impress
upon the Chileans the value of gunnery,
and while the officials do not positively
know it, they believe the Chileans are
engaged in target practice for the pur
pose of being prepared in the prospective
struggle with Argentina.
RIDDLED WITH BULLETS
AND SUNK IN A RIVER
Fate of a Negro Who Assaulted a
White Woman â Armed Mob
Vows Vengeance.

Tho news has reached here that two or
three hundred negroes are marching to
Dlgrby armed with guns and rifles, swear-
Ing vengeance. Every white man in town

REVOLT IN
THE CAROL INE
ISLANDS
Spanish Garrison Said
to Be Wiped Out.
NATIVES COMBINE AGAINST IT
A VIGOBOT7S AND SUCCESSFUL
ATTACK ON PONAPE.
Gunboat Quioros Thought to Have
Been Captured by the Ladrone
Garrison of Ameri
cans.
Private advices have been received
In this city to the effect that the Caro
line group of Islands, which this coun
try contemplated seizing, had war with
Spain been prolonged, Is probably by
this time in the hands of the natives of
the group and that the Spanish garri
son is wiped out. The story comes
from Honolulu whither it was brought
by a small trading schooner which had
touched at the Carolines.
Two native kings of the group who
had long been at war with each other
some months ago declared a truce,
combined their forces and began war
against the Spanish authorities.
The Spaniards were concentrated at
Ponape, and it was here that the na
tives made their attack. The blacks
attacked with such vigor ar..l in such
numbers that the Spanish were com
pelled to retreat and take shelter in
their barracks, which they held.
The gunboat Quioros was then dis
patched to Guam for aid. But on ar
riving there she found the American
flag floating and the only gunboat on
duty at that port missing. The Quioros
did not return to Tap In the Caroline
group, and it was thought that she was
lost. The supposition was that she had
gone to "join Dewey" and that the La
drone garrison of Americans have pos
session of her.
There were 200 soldiers in Ponape,
but they were poorly supplied with am
munition and in no position to resist
a prolonged attack. The supposition
is that the place was captured and the
Spanish garrison wiped out.
The entire group, unless the Span
iards made an unexpected stand, must
be by this time in the possession of
the natives.
The American missionaries are prob
ably safe, as they stand well with the
natives, who, though they may not love
missionaries particularly, love the
Americans.
The story is confirmed by James
Wilder of Honolulu, who reccntlv re
turned to Hawaii from a tour in the
Carolines. He said that at that time
the natives were much discontented
and were preparing: for a revolt. He
also said that Americans were wel
comed by the natives.
RESTORING ORDER IN CRETE.

CANDIA, Island of Creto, Sept. 11.â The

telegram to their respective Governments
requesting the expulsion from Crete of

eral is desired by the Cretans.
Coming Out of Her Hiding Place.
ASCTNCION, Paraguay, Sept. 11.â The
Spanish torpedo gunboat Temerarlo,
which sought refuge here during the
Spanish-American war, is about to sail.
She will go first to Buenos Ayres.
Famous New York Divine Dead.
NEW YORK, Sept. 11.â Rev. Dr. Albert
S. Hull, aged 72 years, for twenty years
secretary of the American Bible Society

LAKE MERRITT
NOW A BONE
OF CONTENTION
Opinions Differ as to
the Money.
ITS EFFECT ON TAXATION
M. J. LAYMANCE DECLARES IT
WILL SCARE CAPITAL.
A. Schilling Says That to Neglect
It Any Longer Would Amoun*:
to a Heinous
Crime.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. U.
Now that the evident purpose of the
City Council to pass a high tax levy Is
thoroughly recognized by the taxpayers
there Is a general desire to discuss the
measure.
M. J. Laymance made a statement this
afternoon Which he declares expresses
the sentiment of ninety-nine out of every
IK) taxpayer* in the city. His statement
is as !'"1 lows:
"1 heartily approve of the carrying out
of the object for which this great tax
levy is to be made, but there is reason in
hastily. The improve
ments contemplated are necessary, but
there is no possibility of them being car
ried out during this fiscal year, and it is
absurd to raine a lot of money and let
it be kept idle. The tax levy of $1 37 is
Blmply outrageous. It means a great deal
more than appears on its face. Not only
will taxpayers have to pay this amount
of tax, but on every mortgage held by
the bank the interest will be proportion
ately raised because the mortgagor will
most certainly be called upon to pay the
anal interest. This means that a
tax of $1 a 7, whii h is 25 cents more than
last rear, will in reality be a tax of (1 60
to ail those who have property mort
gaged.
"This is not a time to increase taxes
Indiscriminately. Lake Merritt should be
improved and I want It improved, but
:;iprovement can judiciously be dis
tributed over four or five years as well
as In .>ne year. Many of the people who
are now agitating this great tax were
amor.g those who a few years ago fought
the issue of bonds to complete the boule
vard around the lake and dredge it at
that time. Eighty thousand dollars is a
large sum of money to be expended at this
time- for a proposition, the necessity of
which is doubtful. 1 do not say the lake
not need improving, for it" does, but
to make it a uniform depth of four feet
'ply guesswork, because there is no
ttce that it is to any extent shallower
than it was forty years ago. Again, $38,500
: I building Bewerfl on either side of the
lake is. in my opinion, purely a district
measure and should be paid for by those
Immediately interested and not by the
whole city. "What benefit is it ?o a man
In West Oakland or Twenty-third avenue
or Temesea! to have a sewer built for the
accommodation of a few property owners
around the lake?
"During the past year $75,000 has been
Bpent on making' a splendid thoroughfare
tfirguph a large section of East Oakland,
ana next year this should be finished. I
think this would be better than dumping
|yÂ»,O)0 into a lake. These contemplated
additional taxes cannot fail to drive cap
ital away, and there Is too little capital
here now. If the lake Improvements be
a. necessity, I think it should certainly be
paid for an issuance of bonds spreading
over twenty years or longer, as the ac
cruing benefit will certainly be as much
for the next generation as this. I am
not pure that the contemplated sewers
to cost $^.r>rpo should not be paid for by
the property owners, and if I understand
Auditor Snow rightly, there are many
legalities to be settled regarding the
Sredging of the lake as a sanitary meas
ure In the light of the park and boule
raro" net. Under these circumstances the
Council should surely take legal advice
before making any such ornamental tax
levy, and I know that the great mass of

ifrs. Beatrice Priest-Fine, Oakland's Best Known Singer, to Say Farewell to
Her Western Home This Week.
OAKLAND, Bept. 11.â Mr*. Reatrice Priest-Fine, who for five years has
been one of the foremost singers of the State, is to leave hor home and to
take up her resMtonce in the East for some time. During her last trip to
ESttrope Mrs. Fine met the leading musicians on t.ie Continent, and on
th<-lr advice she is returning: to further prepare herself for the profes

Mrs. Fine Is an Oakland woman, and has resided here nearly all
her life, where she started her musical career as a church soloist. Next
Friday night she will give h<Â»r farewell recital at the Unitarian Church,
She will render selections from Mozart, Chopin, Brahms, Benburg, Hen
schel, Thomas and Well.
the voters agree with these Bentiments."
On the other hand A. Schilling,
who is one of the most enthusiastic mem
bers of the Lakeside Improvement Club,
says the work is an absolute necessity.
"Any effort to delay this work," said
Mr. A. Schilling, "might almost be termed
criminal, fur we must remedy these
: unsanitary conditions for the sake of our
families, as well for the general welfare
lof the city. Oakland too long has been
! hampered by the cry that it is unhealthy.
, Now, fur instance, when we were looking
about the bay for a suitable place for our
home, 1 considered San Rafael, Sausallto
and other places. I liked Oakland, but
friends of mine said, 'Don't go there, it
jis unhealthy.' This is a very bad adver-
I tisement for any place.
"We located here and I am satisfied
| that the residents of the city join with
: our club in desiring to eradicate these
blots from the city's fair name. In or
der to do this we must strike while the
iron is hot. A united effort has been
made to purify the city, therefore it
would be folly to hold back now that
we have our path cleared in front of us
"This talk of the impossibility of the
work being done within the year is all
wrong. It can be completed within six
months easily and maybe sooner.
Would any business man make a con
tract to have his important work done
inserting a clause that it could be com
pleted whenever the contractor was
ready? No, Indeed, he would insist on
carrying matters to the finish as early
as possible.
"This work is to be done some time
and why hold back now? I say, go
ahead by all means, and do It at once.
Let us make a clean breast of the mat
ter and remove from Oakland these
black spots. We will save money, too,
In- having the work all done at once
If, for Instance, the dredging contract
is let. with the understanding that a
cortain portion of the work is to be
done this year and the rest the next,
the contractor will be obliged to add'
a sum to his figures for the Idleness of
his dredger, or Its removal, whereas
if he kept his crew at work contin
uously, he could well afford to take a
little less. This Idea of Inaction is
what is hurting the progress and pros
perity of Oakland.
"The members of the Lake Side Im
provement Club are not working from
any selfish motives. They want Oak
land elevated to the station Nature In
tended it to be, and thpy want the health
of their families protected. There is
nothing unreasonable demanded â this
every one will admit. Now. as long as it
is proven that this work can all be done
within this fiscal year. In fact, within half
of it let us take the bull by the horns
and face the issue.

A Once Wealthy Berkeley Widow
Broods Over the Loss of Her bon
and Money and Attempts
Suicide.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 11.
"The next chance I get I will surely
succeed In ending my troubles." These
words were uttered by Mrs. N. W. Spen
cer, the once wealthy widow of Berkeley,
as she was placed in the care of Dr.
Keating, keeper of the insane at the Re
ceivlne Hospital, this afternoon. She was
arrested on complaint of her sister, Mrs.
Lorin Sharp, also of Berkeley, and will
be examined by the Lunacy Commission
ers to-morrow.
According to the sister's story, Mrs.
Spencer has on two occasions very nearly
succeeded in committing suicide, choosing
the gas route each time. Only about three
morths ago, at her home on Ashbury
avenue and Wheeler street. Berkeley, her
rash attempt resulted in her being para
lyzed for ncarlv a month. Of late she
has been worrying those about her with
threats of repeating the act.
Mrs. Spencer's husband died some ypnrs
arro, leaving her well provided with an fs
tatc of between $30,000 and $50,>H)0. Pome
time ago, one^Pierson. so it is cja.imofl,
induced her f6" invest in some wildcat
scheme. In which she lost $19,'J00 at one

A few years ago her only son went to
sea and ehe has never heard from Mm
since. Brooding ovt-r the loss ot hfr
wealth and son affected her mind, nil til

which will handicap all efforts to save
her.

THE SAN FRAN CISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBRE 12, 1898.
THE TAXPAYERS'
ANNUAL CRIME
Not a Single Effort to
Protect Their Coin.
JOCULAR, IF NOT SERIOUS
SECOND AMENDMENT NOW OF
SPECIAL INTEREST.
A Few Details Which New Charter-
Makers Â»or Oakland Would
Have to Strenuously
Avoid.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 11.
After many years of Intimate experience
with the manner In which OaK-and City
and Alameda County are governed I feel
constrained to say that the taxpayers of
both deserve to be cinched. Not one in a
thousand takes the slightest interest In
the vast expenditures of public money
that comes out of their pockets. Hun
dreds of business men who exercise the
most scrupulous supervision over their
own concerns pay their taxes, grumble
that they are so heavy and put It all
down to "politics." The city spends about
a million yearly, the county nearly three
millions of dollars, yet when the annual
business of fixing ti.e tax levy comes
around the men who are to supply these
vast incomes leave it to the whims and
caprices of the councilmen or the Super
visors and do not soem to think they are
guilty of the grossest breach of civic duty
and disloyal to their own interests by so
doing. If there be a time when it Is
reasonable to suppose the taxpayers
would meet the lawmakers It is surely
on the occasion of fixing a tax levy,
which is the moat arbitrary debt imposed
on anybody.
Yet what do we see? Outside of a few
men who are desirous of some special
thing in which they are personally inter
ested, who has been near the City Council
during the past week when struggling
with the tax levy? Not more than a dozen
people In all and not one-half of that
dozen were taxpayers. Hints dropped by
Mr. Hfitmann, by Mr. Brosoahan and Mr.
Snow show clsarly that tens of thousands
of dollars are being wasted annually and
not a taxpayer says a word. The effect
of this indifference In the Councilmen Is
very apparentâ the people don't care, why
should they? Although It is known to
the people of Oakland that It Is in con
templation to put large amounts in the
estimates that will necessitate the fixing
of a very high tax levy, yet not a soli
tary citizen was present to protest when
the initial vote was taken, although on
the street everybody's voice, with few
exceptions, Is raised against high taxes.
One of the most valuable books of Its
kind ever compiled Is the annual report
of County Clerk Jordan. It shows wheTe
every cent of the county's money has
gone during the past year, and was ready
for the public several months ago, yet
not one-twentieth of the taxpayers took
the trouble to procure one, although it
was advertised for and wide that It
had been printed for free distribution.
Finally, Clerk Jordan, in an effort to try
to force the people to take an interest
in their own government, mulled thou
sands of copies to those for whose bene
fit the Supervisors very properly had it
printed. This report is a revelation. Even
the untrained eye can see where thou
sands of dollars have been squandered in
several departments of the county gov
ernment. Although many of the sub-re
ports are very cleverly manipulated,
there Is hardly a page where some mate
rial curtailment could not be made. Yet,
I venture to say that these mines of
Information, which should in reason guide
those who will elect the next county offi
cers, will not exercise one particle of In
fluence over the result.
If Alameda County be sincere In seek
ing a remedy for many manifest evils
that now exist and which drain her
treasury, she should return a large vote
in favor of the second constitutional
amendment to be voted In November.
Although published many days I have not
yet found a single voter who has read it.
There is in It one clause which should
interest this county when such vast sums
are annually wasted on Justices of the
Peace and Constables. This clause is:
It shall be competent in all county govern
ment acts framed under the authority given by
this pectlon, to provide for the manner in
which, the times at which, and the terms for
which the several township anil county officers
other than Judgps of the Superior Court, fhnll
be elected or appointed; for their compensa
tion; for the number of such officers, for the
consolidation or segregation of offices, for the
number of deputies that each officer shall have,
and for the compensation payable to each of
puih deputies, for the manner in which, the
times at which, and the terms for which the
members of all hoards of election shall be
elected or appointed and for the constitution,
regulation, compensation and government of
such boards, and of their clerks and attaches;
also, to prescribe the manner and method by
which all elections by the people shall be con
ducted; and may In addition determine the
tests and conditions upon which electorÃ, po
litical parties and organizations may partici
pate In any primary election.
Only a few weeks ago one of the Jus
tices of the Peace of trie city of Oakland
wrote an open letter showing how his
office was useless and tho salary was be
ing thrown away. Although it was very
evident that the statement was made
partly for political effect, It undoubtedly
told the truth. Alameda County has al
together too many politicians on her pay
roll, and not until she Is able to take
advantage of just such a law as the one
quoted can any relief br> found; It will
be Interesting to watch Alameda County's
vote on the second amendment.
As things are now shaping, it may not
be long before Oakland will have the
chance of accepting a new charter. It is
badly needed. In no othor municipal gov
ernment on earth is there such a mass of
Inconsistency and such glaring stupidity
as In the amended monstrosity that now
passes for a charter and under which
Oakland is misgoverned. Is there any
other city in the world where a man pre
pares plans for city work, adopts the
plane, supervises the work, passes upon
it and accepts it and then votes to pay
his own bill? Yet this is what Oakland
tolerates in her City Engineer, who is
also a member of the Board of Works and
a Police and Fire Commissioner. Is there
another city where all the contracts are
let In June and all salaries fixed, ami
where the tax levy to pay for them all is
not fixed till October and one-fourth of
the income is expended? Oakland does it
under her charter. Is ..here another School
Department so deeply in politics because
of the fact that every teacher and janitor
Is elected every year, thus forcing them
to do politics to hold their jobs? Yet Oak
land struggles along under such a disad
vantage. These are Just a few of the Ideas
that come to the surface when any one
mentions a new charter for this city.
Councilman Woodward should know by
thls time that he is not an authority on
figures. He Is the youngest Councilman,
but not the least known. He is very ener
getic now in furthering schemes in the
City Council calling for large expendit
ures of public money and because Messrs.
Cuvellior and Girard expresppd a hint that
perhaps the sober second thought might
change their opinions, Mr. "Woodward ad
vised them to "stand by themselves." Mr.
Woodward may have improved in his
mathematics since he did the lightning
trick with the celebrated water-rate ordi
nance, and it is to be hoped that he has.
He should remember, however, that on
that occasion his vote differed very mate
rially from those of Messrs. Girard and
Cuvellier, and it is not recollected that
there was any desire shown by betrayed
citizens to mob the latter two gentlemen.
In this connection It should be borne in
mind that there will be a city election ajid
a new Council next March and the man
has not yet been found erratic enough to
guess at the possibilities of an Oakland
Council six months ahead.
There 1b one question I would like to
submit to the voters of Oakland. Under
the present water-rate ordinance how
much would It cost to keep Adams' Point
green during the summer should It be
come a public park? The expense of irri
gating the City Hall lawn is so enormous
that the question is now being specially
investigated by the Board of Works.
There is less than half an acre of lawn
at the City Hall. There are sixty acres
at Adams' Point.
STUART W. BOOTH.
FORTY-FIFTH AJfNIVERSARY.
Celebrated Dy the First Methodist
Episcopal Church â Close of Rev.
Dr. Bovard's Pastorate.
ALAMEDA, Sept. 11.â To-night the ser
vices at the First M. E. Church were with
special reference to the anniversary of
the founding of that church, which took
place 45 years ago to-day, under the lead
ership of Rev. James McGowan. From
the most modest beginning the church
has grown until It is to-day the largest
and most prosperous In the city. In his
prelude this evening Rev, Mr. Bovard
briefly sketched the history of the church
and also spoke in farewell to the large
congregation that was present.
Coincident with the anniversary was
the close of the pastorate of Rev. F. D.
Bovard, who has been In charge of the
church for the full term of five years.
At the coming conference on the 15th, at
Pacific Grove, a new pastor will be ap
pointed and Mr. Bovard will be sent to
some other church, greatly to the regret
of his parishioners, with whom he has
been very popular.
BERKELEY NEEDS
A POLICE COURT
SO THE GOOD GOVERNMENT
CLUB SAYS.
Factions Getting Into Line for a
Struggle Over the Question of
a Local Judiciary.
BERKELEY, Sept. 11. âThe question of
a local Judiciary, which promises soon to
be the absorbing topic in Berkeley's poli
tics, is rapidly developing in interest as
the time for decision draws near. In
many ways the approaching contest pre-
sente strange complications, which may
Involve the measure very seriously, and
possibly. In the end, prevent its success.
The university town has at present no
means of enforcing Its municipal ordi
nances. Although a municipal govern
ment in name, the arm of the law is per
fectly powerless to carry out its decrees,
or to have its regulations respected.
Many of the licenses are sadly in arrears;
nor is there any way of bringing the de
linquents to time. In the face of this, the
greater part of the residents of the town
regard the establishment of a local court
as a matter of pressing necessity.
Acting upon this the Board of Trustees
has prepared an amendment to the free
holders' charter, establishing a police
court having jurisdiction over petty mis
demeanors, and with power to enforce all
the municipal ordinances. The measure
will be voted upon at a special election
set for that purpose on the 15th of next
month. The measure, however, embodies
one important provision, which has al
ready antagonized a large section of vot
ers. Opposition, more or less pronounced,
was expected from a few, as a loose ad
ministration of the law is always wel
comed by the lawless element. But now
the natural opponents of the amendment
have only a divided camp to face, and
they are thus hoping that the measure
will kill itself.
The point over which dispute has arisen
concerns the method by which the new
judge Is to hold office. As it now stands,
the amendment provides that the official
shall be appointed by the Board of Trus
tees, to hold office for two years. To this
method of holding office by appointment
a large portion of the community objects,
and their opposition is becoming a mat
ter of serious moment. If the amendment
goes before the people in Kb present state,
ft is safe to say that it will meet with a
decided opposition at the polls from peo
ple who would otherwise indorse it.
Notwithstanding this an effort will be
made to carry the measure through just
as it stands, and the different, factions are
getting into line for the struggle. As pre
dicted in last Sunday's Call, the Good
Government Club held a meeting at which
resolutions wera adopted favoring the
charter amendment and the system of
appointed judges. They will give the
measure active support.
Professor Carl C. Plehn of the de
partment of history and economics in the
University of California, and one of the
leading authorities upon questions of mu
nicipal government, is known to be
strongly in favor of having judges ap
pointed, and as president of the Good
Government Club his opinion is likely to
carry some weight.

Daily Arrests of In

PARK TO REPLACE THE DENS
PLANS OF ST. MARY'S SQUARE
ASSOCIATION.
Will Petition the Board of Super
visors to Condemn the Property
and Appropriate Money
for the Changes.
"A vigorous movement will be Inaugu
rated at once against localized vice.
Steps will be taken looking to the speedy
removal of the gates across Bacon place
ami for wholesale daily arrests of disso
lute women there and in the immediate
rtdnlty."
Such were the emphatic statements
made by Rev. Father Otis yesterday.
"There will be no let up in the move
ment to dense that district of vice until
the full purpose is accomplished. The St.
Mary's Square Association, which was or
ganized last Saturday evening in St.
Mary's Church will have its committee
before the Board of Supervisors on Mon
fternoon and will petition that body
tn order condemnation proceedings to be
brought by the city to secure the property
In the district bounded by Dupont street,
S' Mary's place, California and Pine
streets, where dens of infamy have flour
ished for many years. While we are
about it the authorities will be asked to
... the gates across Bacon place. If
there is necessity for it. in order to run
the inmates out of Bacon place, as now
seems highly probable, daily arrests of
all the womenâ say ISO all toldâ will be
made by the officers of the Society for
Rev. Father Otis and His Co-workers Determined to Change This Hotbed
of Vice into a Beautiful Park.
' â  Prevention of Vice, acting: In conjunc
tion with tlÂ»e St. Hary'a Square Associa
tion. This policy has not heretofore 1 n
announced, but it la the one that will be
followed. We fully b slieve that the Su
pervisors will act in conformity with our
petition to rid the city of this evil', so
ong permitted to flourish unmolested in
the heart of Sari Francisco.
'The Supervisors will be asked to make
provision i:. the tax levy for an appropri
ation of $75,000 to go toward paying for
Ihe property to be condemned, the under
ttanding being that the additional amount
necesary .... vi (26,000 â will be raised by
private subscription. There Will be no
JifÃculty in securing this $25,000. There
Eire scores of well-to-do citizens in the

meeting held Saturday night in 'the

something like $12,000. I know of no per

I am inclined to think that the letter was

cal commendation from all sides. This new effort will be of a differ
ent character, and not a spare moment is being wasted by the latest
acquisition to the footjight ranks in her presentation of Desdemona.
The performance of "Othello" will be for charity. A cast of
well known amateurs will present the other characters.
the Supervisors are against us 1n the
proposed cleaning out of the dives, nor
will they, in my opinion, object to the
park project. That some property-owners
will object seems certain, but their pro
test ought not to avail.
"This movement is not sectarian by any
means. The vestry of Grace Episcopal
Church has passed resolutions formally
Indorsing the park as planned and these
resolutions were read at the Saturday
evening meeting. Men of all creeds are
behind it."
"We will have to move against Bacon
place, while we are about the good
work," said Attorney Shadburne, who is
taking a prominent part In the move
ment. "It would never do to leave that
pest hole right up against the side of the
proposed park. The bad element has all
been ejected from the neighborhood.
Bacon place being the only spot where
the women are still permitted to remain.
For some reason it has been deemed diffi
cult in the past to attack the dens in Ba
con place. Under various city adminis
trations the owners of property there
seemed to have a pull with the existing
powers. Now. however, that the gooa
work has so far progressed, there Is no
reason why the attack should not be car
ried into the last place of refuge.
"Within the last few days I have con
sulted with many leading- citizens and
without exception they are in favor of
the movement to create a park on the
proposed site. There will be no trouble
in raising the $25,000 required from private
subscriptions, if the city will contribute
the $75,000 asked. It is useless to say
that the buildings recently vacated in
this locality will long remain so, unless
rased to the ground. The dissolute white
women will undoubtedly be kept out, but
a worse class of Chinese will certainly
take possession in the near future and
make the spot even worse than it has
been In the past. The buildings must be
condemned and torn down and a park
placed there if San Francisco would be
permanently rid of one of the foulest
places on Its surface.."
DAN GREEN MEETS TEFEAT.
Bested by Sid Cavill at Sutro's
Baths â A Fireman's Fast Horse.
Dan Green, fonsidered a champion
swimmer in local sporting circles, was de
feated yesterday at Sutro Baths by Sid
Oavill, champion of Australia, and if, in
the near future, some man is not pro
duced from the East capable of leaving
Cavil] in his wake, the Australian's cards
will bc-ar the fact that he is champion
of America as well as the land of his
birth. The race between Cavill and Green
was close, Cavill crossing the line at the
220 yard mark, but a few feet ahead of
his opponent. The time was 2:33.
L. Maare won the fifty yard juvenile
race, G. Dodgrey second; C. Dastick won
the seventy-five yard juvenile race, G.
Wlllard second: A. Schultf ag-a.ln took
the prize in the springboard contest, and
A. J. Baker was declared winner in the
trapeze diving contest.
The bf-autlful weather of yesterday
called out unusually large crowds. The
park and beach were thronged with pleas-
ure seekers, a great majority of whom
did not turn toward their homes until
late in the evening. No accidents occurred
to mar the enjoyment of the day, and
but ('lie incident worthy of notice came
to pass. Dennis Maloy. a fireman on the
United States transport City of Sydney,
was trying out a spirited horse when he
was overhauled by one of the mounted
police and taken to the Park Station,
where the officer intended to book him on
a charge of fa.st driving. Captain Thomp
son, when the prisoner explained that he
was just off the transport and was en
joying an outing, ordered the fireman's re
lease, and he continued on his drive, but
with less speed.

Another young society
woman has taken to the foot
lights. On September 30 Miss
Eleanor Sanford, the daughter
of the Treasurer of Alameda
County, will make her debut
as Desdemona In a perform
ance of "Othello," at the Cali
fornia Theater. Miss Sanford
is well known in the society
circles of both this city and
Oakland. She is a tall, hand
some girl of the demi-bionde
type. The "sweet Desdemona"
will not be her first histrionic
venture, for she has appeared
in many amateur perform
ances, and the success that she
attained therein assures an
other feather in her theatric
hat. Miss Sanford is studying
the part of the much wronged
woman night and day. She
does not hope to introduce
anything new in her interpre
tation of the character, but
will try and follow the crea
tions of some of those who
have gone before.

Russell Does Splendid
Twirling.

LANGE PERFORMS WONDERS
WITH ONE HAND.
Stultz Does Some Wild Throwing,
and His Blunders Give the
Oaklanders Their
Rons.
By Joe Corbett.
A very close and exciting game was the
programme yesterday afternoon at Rec
reation Park, in which the Oaklands,
through the splendid twirling of Russell,
and the great support accorded him by
his club mates, defeated, or rather shut
out, the Athletics by the score of 4 to 0.
One-handed stops by Lange, which are
seldom seen at this extreme of base
balldom, together with the all-around
clever work of the Oaklands, are quite
worthy of mention, as Is also the poor
throwing of Stultz, who by his mistakes
pave the winners nearly all their runs.
A big crowd was in attendance. Tho
came was interesting and exciting
throughout, and the good work of the
Oaklands was appreciated: The score

CYCLER BOZIO LOWERS
THE TEN-MILE RECORD
CLIPS TWO MINUTES FROM THE
PREVIOUS TIME.
Successful Race of Olympic Club
Wheelmen Over the San Leandro
Road.
The ten mile road record of the Pacific
Coast was broken yesterday afternoon by
E. A. Eozlo of the Olympic Wheelmen,
who established a new mark of 22:04.
The most remarkable feature of the
ride was the fact that Bozlo had ridden
to San Leandro in the morning with the
men of his club and had participated in
the club race from that point to Hay
wards, finishing fourth and making sec
ond fastest time.
It had been announced that after the
race J. E. Wing would attempt to lower
the ten mile record, but Wing, finding the
course In poor condition, refused to make
the attempt. Bozio thereupon decided to
try for the record himself, and took the
train to Fruitvale, accompanied by pace
makers and timers. Curtis and Bean, on
a tandem, furnished the pace for the first
three mile 6. Fuller and Russ on singles
then paced Bozlo, each going a mile with
him. A triyilet manned by Wing, Kroetz
and Kragness took the record breaker
from San Leandro to the junction of the
county and San Lorenzo roads.
Here a bad quarter of a mile was found,
the road having been covered for that dis
tance with fresh gravel, as yet unrolled.
Anthony and Naee. on a tandem, took
Bozio from this point to the finish, though
they were in poor condition. Bozio passed
them out in the sprint for the tape.
When the timers consulted their watches
it was found that the coast record had
been lowered over two minutes, and had
the road been in better condition the
world's record for ten miles on the road
would doubtless have been secured. Bozlo
has made frequent attacks upon the rec
ord, but never went through without an
accident.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen's five mile
road race was started at 11:30 from San
Leandro. Ten riders entered and all fin
ished, though Bean and "Young" Bozio
were thrown at the gravel-covered por
tion of the course. Bean being severely
bruised.
L. H. Smith won the prize offered for
the first place, riding from the 1:25 mark,
and O. E. Bozio finished a close second.
Then came the four scratch men. Wing,
A. E. Bozio, Russ and Fuller, riding In
the order named and paced by one an
other.
Eddie Adams, the club's mascot, rode
his first race, and, considering the lad's
fifteen years, he made a commendable
ride.
Wing captured first time prize In addi
tion to that offered for third place, but
declined to go over the road again that
day.

PACIFICS WIN A GAME.
Champion Alameda Cricket Team Was
Beaten Yesterday at Golden
Gate by Nine Huns.
The fifth match of the season between
the Alameda and Pacific elevens, the
llrst innings of which was played on Sep
tember 4, was continued yesterday at the
Golden Gate ground. The Pacifies, being
81 runs behind on the first Innings, fol
lowed on. C. P. Colts and J. J. Theobald
made so good a stand, the former scoring
72 runs, and the latter 51, that the Pacific
total for the innings reached 2590. Th#i,
added to the 76 made in the first Innings,
produced a grand total of 335 for both
Innings, leaving Alameda 179 runs to score
in order to win. When the fifth wicket
fell Alameda had scored 142 runs, and vic
tory seemed almost within their grasp.
But the eighth wicket fell for 169 runs,
and, as they played two men short, the
innings was closed. The Alameda total
for both Innings was thus 32G, or 9 short
of the Pacific total. F. Croll was the
most successful of the Alameda bowlers;
taking 4 wickets for 07 runs. For the Pa
cifies F. Sewell took 3 wickets, but at the
rather high cost of 70 runs. The full
ecore Is appended:

A SEVERED ARM
AND GRIM HEAD
TELL OF MURDER
Grewsome Find of Two Young
Ladies on the Shore of
Oakland's Estuary.
A Mystery of the Bay That Recalls the
Frightful Butchery of Addie
Gilmour.
OAKLAND, Sept. 11.â The finding
of the arm and hand of a female near
the Eighth-street bridge this evening
and the sighting of a -woman's head
off the beach at Berkeley a week ago
point to a tragedy similar to that of
a few years ago in which Miss Addie
Gilmour was the victim and Dr. West
a central figure.
The arm and hand found this after
noon are in a state of fair preservation,
and do not appear to have been in the
â¢water more than a few days. The limb
Is said to be apparently that of a young
woman perhaps 20 to 25 years of age.
The fingers and linger nails are per
fect, but there is not a single mark
that might lead to identification.
The limb was found by two young
girls who were walkUig along the edge
of the entrance to Lake Merritt, be
tween the Seventh-street trestle and
the Eighth-street bridge. These girls
are Miss Irene Monroe of 920 Sixth
street and Miss Bertha Waller of 208
East Twenty-eighth street.
Their attention was attracted by
something that looked unusual, and on
examining* it they found it to be a de
tached arm of a human beine\ Miss
Monroe secured it, and realizing that
It was a very unusual Incident for hu
man arms to be on the beach, she took
It home to show to her parents. She
Bays she knew nothiper of the Coroner's
duty In such oases, but she was told
to take it back to the place where she
found it and tell Constable "Jack" Rob
inson of her discoverj-. This she did,
and Robinson notified the police. The
Coroner eventually sent for the limb,
and now has it in his possession. To
morrow he will take measures trying
to trace Its origin.
SILT WATER
ON THE STREETS
No Longer an Experi
ment in Sprinkling.
IS ECONOMIC AND SANITARY
MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION AD
VOCATES ITS USE.
Original Costyls Less Than That of
Fresh Water and It Has
Many Other Ad
vantages.
The practice of sprinkling 1 the streets
of cities on the Atlantic sea coast with
Bait watÂ«r has long been recognized as
both an economic and sanitary measure.
The progressive members on the direct
orate of the Merchants' Association, quick
to grasp any idea that would result in
benefit to this city, hit upon this as be
ing something that could readily and'ad
vantageously bo applied here, as salt
water can be obtained so readily.
Their engineer made an exhaustive
study of the subject a year ago. Hlb re
port was used as a leverage with which to
move the Supervisors to adopt that sys
tem of street sprinkling. There was
eomc obstacle in the way and the matter
â was dropped for the time being. A prac
tical trial was made, however, with won
derful results.
Van Ness avenue, Kearny street and
other downtown thoroughfares were se
lected for the experiment. The outcome
was the same as In every locality where
salt water has been used. It was found
that the quantity of water required was
much less than when fresh water was
used, two cartloads of the former being
equal to three or four of the latter. The
merchants were quick to appreciate Its
other merits.
The salt formed a slight crust on the
surface of the street, thus retaining much
of the dust that would otherwise have
been whirled Into the stores and houses
by the wind.
The officers of the Merchants' Associa
tion did' not press the matter then, but
within the past month they have re
newed their battle for the substitution of
salt water for fresh water. The matter
Is no longer in the experimental stage.
Water from the ocean is already piped
through the city to the Lurline Baths
and other bathing establishments. It is
expected that the question of the use of
salt water will be presented to the Park
Commissioners, with the request that
they use it on the park drives under their
control.
The Harbor Commissioners use it on
Kast street and are so enamored of it
that they would not willingly go back
to the old system, and Its adoption by the
Supervisors would be but another step In
the direction of placing this city abreast
of the times.
"OLD TOC" IS DEAD.
The Famous Buck of the Lagunitas
Is Brought to Grass.
"Old Toe," the famous three-pronged
buck that half of sporting San Francisco
has at one time or another chased over
the hills back of Lagunitaa, has at last
been brought to grass, and the body of
the magnificent animal arrived In this
city last night.
"Old Toe" has been the avowed prey of
a coterie of San Francisco sportsmen for
some weeks past, and on Saturday last
Dan Siebert, Jack Oswald, Claus Witt
and Fred Sanderson left for the Lagu
nitas hills with the fixed intention of not
returning without their quarry. As luck
would have it the second buck that Mr.
Sanderson's dog Paddy forced from cover
was the object of the hunt, and he was
promptly brought down by a shot in the
hip from the rifle of Mr. Siebert. Two
more shots were necessary before the
grand old buck gave up the fight.
When dressed he tipped the beam at 160
pounds, and his captors won the heartiest
congratulations of the season from the
big crowd of envious sportsmen who were
attracted by the news of the kill.
A Lesson on the Botkin Case.
At the Hamilton Square Baptist Church
last night Key. W. C. Jenkins, the pastor,
delivered a sermon on the Botkln-Dun
nlng poloon mystery. HÂ« prefaced hiÃ
remarks by asserting that ha did not un
The arm is severed at the elbow, and
the operation appears to have been a
clumsy one. According to the Coroner's
deputy it seems to have been broken
apart, rather than severed by cutting.
There is nothing to suggest that the
arm wus dlsescted ' a medical stu
dent and thrown away.
When Constable Robinson was mak
ing Inquiries of some boys in the neigh
borhood he was told that a lad named
Willie Duncan had first seen the arm a
week ago, but had not taken It away.
Eight days ago Mrs. Mary A. Co
burn, who lives near the water front at
Berkeley saw from a window in the
rear of her home an object in the bay
and sent her two sons John and Charles
to bring it ashore. The boys waded out
to the object and were greatly horri
fied to find the head of a woman. The
younger son, Charles, managed to get
within reach of the head, but could not
brinr himself to take hold of it. These
boys say that the head was that of a
girl with long, loose black hair, and
that it had evidently been in the water
for some time, as part of the face had
been eaten away and decomposition
was far advanced. The wound caused
by decapitation was plainly visible.
Nothing has been seen of it since, al
though the boys are positive that what
they saw was the head of a woman.
The discovery to-dÂ»y in connection
with the head seen off Berkeley has
created great public interest, owing to
the similarity in details with the Addle
Gilmour case.
The head of Addle Gilmour was first
found off the Marin County shore, and
after a few days a limb was found In
the estuary not a great ways from
to-day,
where the arm and hand were found
Sergeant Morrison and the Coroner's
office are of the opinion that there Is
a story of horror to be unfolded, of
which the head off Berkeley Is the first
chapter and the arm found to-day, the
eecond.
dertake to dpclare Mrs. Botkin either
guilty or innocent of one of the most
hideous crimes of the century; but he
ascribed to her personal conduct as ac
knowledged by her own lips and portray
ed in the columns of the dally news
papers, much of the cause for the sus
picion with which she is regarded in the
community.
There are three reasons for this sus
picion, the minister said, and they will
lie in her path and confront her, he de
clared, at every turn in her endeavor to
free herself from an awful charge. First,
the race track habit, and he condemned
this in unmeasured terms; second, the
frequenting of saloons and the excessive
use of strong drink; and, third, un
faithfulness to marriage vows.
To these three causes. Mr. Jenkins said,
Mrs. Botkin would be justified, if she is
Innocent, In accounting for her miserable
plight; and, if she Is guilty, then these
Indulgences of the past will only add to
the dreadful burden which she must carry
when she faces the courts of law and
eventually her Maker.
ADVISED TO STAY HO MR
A. F. Benara Jr. Writes an Interest-
ing Letter From Dawson.
A. F. Benard Jr., the son of the well
known Larktn street saloon keeper, has
written a lengthy letter from Dawson to
a friend In this city. After describing the
gold fields and giving an idea of the
amount of provisions It requires to make
the trip, he writes: "Do not believe th*
reports of the finding of Immense wealth
on the surface of the ground. It is the
hardest country in the world to prospect,
as can be testified to by old ana experi
enced miners. It requires considerable
labor and energy to even carry a pack
containing food, blankets, tools, etc. By
the time one reaches his destination there
is very little food left, and it becomes nec
essary to go back for another supply,
without having done anything In the
line of prospecting. There la some gold
here, but not near the amount that some
people have represented to be. I would
advise those who are not acquainted here
and who are contemplating a trip to this
wild country, to stay at home, as a stran
ger is not In It, figuratively speaking."
PICKPOCKETS CAUGHT.
Discovered Working a Crowd Near
the Cliff House.
A gang: of pickpockets proceeded to
work the crowd at the terminus of the
Sutro car line yesterday afternoon when
they were discovered by the superintend
ent of txie road, who telephoned to the
O'Farrell-street Police Station. Several
officers were Bent to the scene and after
a short struggle succeeded In arresting
six of the gang.
At the City Prison they gave fictitious
names and were locked up pending an In
vestigation. A number of people were
robbed of their purses in the vicinity of
the Cliff House yesterday, and it is
thought that the prisoners are the cul
prits. Nothing of an incriminating na
ture was, however, found on them.

THE SAX" FRAKCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1898.
UNCLE GEORGE'S CLOSE CALL
Bohemia's High Priest Almost Asphyx-
iated by Accident.
The countless friends of "Uncle George" Bromley, bon vlvant, wit,
ante and post prandial speaker and raconteur, the patriarch of the uncon
ventional and delightful realm
of Bohemia, are rejoicing that an
accident last Wednesday night in
their high priest's household has
had' no serious result.
Mr. Bromley, upon retiring for
the night, evidently failed to
turn the gas cock com
pletely off; and in the course of
a few hours a member of his fam
ily who sleeps in an adjoining
room was aroused by his labored
breathing. Entering his room at
once she found Mr. Bromley un
conscious and the chamber flood
ed with the deadly vapor. The
windows were thrown open, a
physician sent for, and vigorous
efforts to revive "Uncle George"
soon resulted in his being restored
to consciousness.
Two things had rendered the
Incident less serious than it might
have been. The flow of gas, owing
to the orifice being: small, was
restricted, and an open fireplace
leading directly into the air
through a chimney carried off
considerable of the poison.
With the exception of the fact
that Mr. Bromley has been
obliged to remain indoors for the
last four days he has suffered
only slight inconvenience from
the gas, and he declares that he
will be more careful in the future.
"Why shouldn't I be?" he said
yesterday. "I have only one fault
to find with the world. It Is too
good to me. Dear me! Indeed!"

BOTKIN CASE
IS READY FOR
THE GOVERNOR
Waits Only on the Del
aware Affidavits.
LEES ON THE ANXIOUS SEAT
SENATOB FRANK McGOWAN'S
STARTLING THEORY.
He Makes a Statement That May
Foreshadow the Line of De
fense in the Coming
Trial.
Though the law of the land requires the
prosecution to produce before the com
mitting magistrate only enough of the
evidence that has been adduced to es
tablish a prima facie case against the
prisoner charged. Chief Lees proposes to
establish an exception and a precedent
when he brings the case of Mrs. Cordelia
Botkin under the official eye of Governor
Budd to-morrow morning.
Not a fractional part, but the whole
sum of his evidence will be thrown into
the scale to balance against the powerful
points of law upon which alone the de
fense will base its fight. It Is in the
bulk rather than the value of his evi
dence, the rotundity of his many affidavits
and the sheer weight of their verbiage
in Nvhich lies Chief Lees' one hope of
outweighing his prisoner's case and ef
fecting her extradition into Delaware.
"Whether 01 not the weight of the prose
cution's case is sufficient to its ends must
wait upon the decision of Governor Budd
for its answer.
In so far as it connects Mrs. Botkln with
the murders alleged against her, the case
as it will go before Governor Budd con-
Bists of no moro than the original four
characterizing features, with only one of
which is Mrs. Botkin connected, and with
that only by the slenderest thread of
probability. This feature tha-t the prose
cution will -set up as Its one substantial
fact is that on June 1, two months prior
to the murder of Mrs. Dunning, Mrs.
Botkin purchased of the Owl Drug Com
pany two ounces of powdered arsenic.
To prove this they will have the testi
mony of Frank S. Grey, who knew Mrs.
Botkin and who, as manager of the drug
store, sold her the arsenic. To sever this
one link that connects Its client with the
crime the defense will show that at the
time of the purchase the defendant did
not try to conceal her identity, but, on
the contrary, had written upon the poison
register her right name and the use to
which she intended putting the poison.
They will further produce two witnesses
who claim to have been with Mrs. Bot
kin in her room at the Hotel Victoria
when she used the drug to blf>ach a white
straw hat, the use to which she told
Grey she Intended putting It.
The second count In the prosecution's
case will veal with the handwriting of the
anonoymous letters and that of the wrap
per round thp candy box. By comparison
with h*Â»r known writings Chief Leps will
attempt to prove that Mrs. Botkin indited
both. Numerous photographic enlarg
ments of the scripts have been prepared
by Expert Kytka and It Is principally
upon his testimony as an expert that It is
hoped to prove a similarity.
The tracing of the candy and box to
the store of George W. Haas, and the evi
dence of Miss Dittmer and Miss Heney,
who remember the salf>, will also be feat
ures to which the Chief will give much
prominence.
The purchase at the City of Paris of tho
handkerchief that accompanied the deadly
bonbons will be fully set forth In num
erous affidavits, though among the clerks
of the store none has been found who
can recall when, or to whom, It was
sold.
The affidavits of John P. Dunning, setting
forth* his relations with Mrs. Botkin and
also relating to the anonymous letters
are reckoned upon as evidence of heavy
weight and will be a feature of the case.
Another bit of evidence that has been
given much prominence Is an affidavit
maue by Miss Lizzie Llvernash, a report
er of the Examiner.
The statement is considered of little
valup to Chief Lees. The defense has
not considered It of sufficient Importance
to make provision against it.
Before the Governor the defense will
call no witnesses, but will rest Its case
on the numerous law points involved. Th
case Governor Budd sees fit to gTant the
requisition as prayed for, an appeal will
at once be taken to the Supreme Court
and. If necesary, carried to the Supreme
Court of the United States. The attor
neys for the defense have decided to
finally establish a precedent for cases of
the peculiar nature of the present one.
Chief Lees said yesterday that his case
before Governor Budd intent be weakened
by the non-arrival of certain supplement
ary affidavits made by John P. Dunning.
Ho has received word that the fresh evi
dence of Dunning is not among the affi
davits that will arrive this evening from
Dover and is much worried at the pros
pect of proceeding without it.
ONE THEORY OF MRS.
BOTKIN'S DEFENSE
Attorney McGowan Is Seeking to
Bring Another Woman Into
the Case.
Attorney Frank MoGowan, fox the de-
fensa, is confident that upon law points
alone, and without the introduction of a
kine of evidence, Governor Budd will be
induced to deny the requisition for Mrs.
Botkin.
"We are going to fight it out," said he,
"upon the point that Airs. Botkin is not a
fugitive from justice, as set forth in the
arresting warrant. It is certainly to our
client's interest that her trial shall be
held in this State. In a case of this kind
environment is everything, and conse
quently we shall try to keep her right
here where her friends are around her
and where, at a moment's notice, we can
find even the least important of our wit
nesses.
"We will bring none of our witnesses
before the Governor, for as I understand
the proposition it is only necessary that
the prosecution bring such evidence as
will prove that extradition is legal, and I
think that we can prove in a very few
minutes that in this case extradition will
be anything but that.
"No; Mr. Knight certainly will not be
the 'whole thing. Both Mr. Wheeler and
myself will have equal representation and
equal opportunity with him. The little
friction that necessarily occurred at the
opening of the case has been entirely
done away with, and we now have our
work so apportioned that there can be no
further hitch."
Asked if he had yet formulated a theory
looking to the true solution of the Dun
ning mystery Senator McGowan reluc
tantly admitted that he had, and then in
a few words he gave credence to a rumor
that for weeks past has been carefully
kept in mind by Chief Lees and his ue
tectives.
"I have ne\'er felt for a moment that
our client has the stain of this horrid
crime upon her," said Senator McGowan.
"The utter failure of all attempts to con
nect her with the mass of evidence that
has been uncovered has greatly strength
ened this f&ith in her, and though I am
not for a moment neglecting the require
ments of the present case, there is not a
moment that I am not looking for the
woman who actually did the murder.
"And I am looking, too. for the evidence
that will connect John P. Dunning with
It. It Is known that Dunning was, to say
the least, promiscuous in his attentions
to women, and I have heard it said that
there was a woman here to whom he was
more warmly attached than to Mrs. Bot
kn, and for this woman I am looking.
This and other rumors of equal persis
tency have inuueed me to lend more than
cursory attention to the matter.
"I do not say thai I believe Dunning an
accessory, but I think that the theory is
sufficiently plausible to warrant investi
gation."
It has become apparent to every one
who has kept in touch with The Call's re
ports of the evidence as it has been dis
covered that the facts adduced might do
as well to convict some other suspect
as Mrs. Botkin. The connecting link
twixt evidence and prisoner has not yet
been found, and prisoner and evidence,
so far as the facts nave been made known,
remain two separate and distinct propo
sitions in the case.
The repeated failure to absolutely con
nect the two have Induced Chief Lees to
keep a watchful eye for anything that
would tend to corroborate McGowan's
theory.
Will Give an Entertainment.
St. Alban's (Episcopal Mission) Church
will give an entertainment at Golden
Gate Hall, on Friday evening, September
23, consisting of a laughable farce en
titled, "Never Reckon Your Chickens be
fore They are Hatched." The programme

DEATH SAVED
HER FROM A
FELON'S CELL
Sad Ending of a Once
Handsome Woman.
WAS KNOWN TO THE POLICE
JOSIE EVANS, A BOBN THIEF,
DEFEATS JUSTICE.
Wantwd for Grand Larceny She Goes
to the County Hospital to
Pass Her Few Bemain
ing Days.
Occupying an unmarked grave In the
City Cemetery is the body of Josie Evans,
a once handsome woman, whose criminal
career forme an interesting chapter in the
police annals of this city. Possessed of
many gifts, this woman might have had
an enviable place in society had it not
been for her criminal instincts and her
weakness for taking the property of
others.
"Josie," as she was familiarly known to
the police, started on her criminal career
about four years ago. She was then a
mere girl, but in a brief space of time she
developed into one of the most daring fe
male thieves that ever operated in tnis
city. Her scheme was to live out as a
servant and while her employer was ab
sent she would steal as much property
as she could conveniently carry. About a
year ago she visited a friend, who lived
on Mason street, and when she left sev
eral silk dresses and some jewelry be
longing to the lady of the house were
gone. The police were notified and after
considerable trouble they found Josie
In a lodging-house on Kearny street.
In her trunk were the missing articles,
together with a miscellaneous assortment
of stolen property. She was tried for the
offense, and on conviction was sent to the
House of Correction for six months. Af
ter her release she met a confiding woman
who after listening to her story of poverty
and hunger allowed her to occupy a room
in her house.
In reward for her kindness Josie during
the absence of her benefactress selected
the most suitable articles she could find
in the house and, packing them in a
trunk, sent for an express wagon. The
trunk containing the stolen articles was
then placed in the wagon, and the driver
ordered to take It to the woman's room
on Mission street.
While the police were scouring the city
for the young woman word reached them
that she was In the City and County Hos
pital, a victim of rapid consumption. On
account of her condition they allowed her
to remain there, knowing that her death
would be hastened by removing' her to
prison. Her last appeal to the detective
who visited her a short time afterward
was that she be allowed to remain at the
hospital, as she did not want to die in
prison.
"It is all over with me," she remarked,
as tears coursed down her sunken cheeks.
"For God's sake don't let them take me
away. I know I have been a bad girl, but
please let me die away from the gloomy
surroundings of the jail."
The detective assured her that she
would not be removed, and vainly endeav
ored to cheer her up up by telling her
that her last victim had forgiven her.
Thursday night the unfortunate woman
breathed her last, and her emaciated
body was interred in potters' field.
THEY DRESSED IN
HASTE AND BOLTED
FIRE AT THE HAMMAM BATHS
ON SUTTER STREET.
Mayor Phelan and His Friends Were
There as Spectators â Abbre
viated Costumes and a
Happy Crowd.
A flre started in Lenstrom & Johnson's
Hammam Baths, 415 Sutter street, yes
terday afternoon at 4:15, and occupied tho
attention of the Fire Department for
about three-quarters of an hour. The
resulting damage amounted to $3000â
$2000 to the building and ; JO to the fur
nishings. The cause, as recorded in the
annals of the Fire Department, was over
heating and hot air In the "drop," a
technical term which applies alone to
Hammam apparatus.
It was a warm time all round at the
Hammam Baths during the day. Tiie
steam never seemed hotter to the epi
demic Sunday bathers. W. P. Wolfe and
M. Blum were cooling off when the flre
warned them that there was a kind 'of
heat for which they were not yet pre
pared. They had been steamed to a
nicety, but they did not wish to expose
themselves to any foreign and unexpected
heat, so they fled when they discovered
that valor would end in a roast. Wolfe
ran to his clothes and dressed hurriedly;
he even waited to get his valuables out of
the treasure box, but Blum was not so
successful. Somehow his clothes did not
go on as readily as under ordinary cir
cumstances, so that, when the Fire De
partment arrived it was forced to conduct
the aforesaid Mr. Blum to a safe retreat.
He was taken to one of the dressing
rooms far removed from the area of flre,
but within easy shot of the nozzle brigade.
To quiet Blum's nerves the hose players
would now and them spatter the room a
bit, all of which made the undressed but
much washed Blum happy.
A woman who was indulging in the
shocking delights of an electric bath
heard some one on the inside cry "fire."
She jumped at conclusions and almost
out of the window, but was held back
from the latter by the hand of the lady
masseur. They both began to dress at
the same time, but the lady masseur had
her bangs crimped before her subject had
donned enough clothes to prevent the
police from making an arrest If she had
appeared on the street at that moment.
The masseur assisted the lady with a
skirt and a cape and away they both went
flying into the street. The crowd on the
outside thought it was funny, but the
lady looked otherwise as she rushed into
Druid's Hall to make additions to her
abbreviated costume.
When the crowd began to gather Mayor
Phelan and "Whispering" Gavin McNab,
who were in the neighborhood, rushed to
the scene. Tom Riordan and Captain
Wittman soon joined them, and the quar
tet watched the flre with consuming in
terest. The Mayor said that he was once
at a Hammam bath, and then suddenly
ceased talking. He had once been em
barrassed by a similar experience.
The flre commenced in the rear of the
building, which is owned by F. Bogan.
It seemed to take its origin from a de
fect in the casing over the furnace Wolfe
discovered it first and gave the alarm.
The flre ran up the air shaft in the back
of the building and then spread through
the top floor, from which ft descended.
SAILS FLAPPED IDLY.
Corinthian Small Yacht Begatta at
El Campo Postponed for Want
of Wind.
At 10 o'clock yesterday morning 1 there
â¢was little breeze at Tlburon, and the
chances for a successful small yacht re
gatta began to look slim. But toward
noon a light wind sprang up, and carried
many of the Corinthian fleet through the
straits up to, or a little beyond, California
City. But then a flat calm stopped all
further progress and sails flapped idly,
and the yachtsmen had nothing left to
do but to "josh" each other. The Corin
thians are past masters at this art, and
gave themselves plenty of scope.

Christianity and the Schools.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 11.â Rev. Charles
R. Brown preached on "Christianity and
the Public Schools" at the First Congre
gational Church to-night. He discerned
at length the practicability of instructing
the Bchool children In the rudiments of
religion, based on these four truths, as
fundamental principles. The existence of
a Supreme Being; obedience to the moral
law bringing us into the expression of fa
vor with God; conscious communion with
God that is the habit of prayer; and last
ly, there lies beyond this life a future,
and that our conduct here affects our
happiness there.
He said the prisoners at San Quentin
are there not from the fact that they did
not know the capital of Dakota, but be
cause of a lack of moral power, which
might have been started through teach
ing the simple truths of natural religion,
totally stripped of all sectarian dif
ferences.
