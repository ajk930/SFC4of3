SENSATIONAL TRIAL OF
EMILE ZOLA, THE BOLD
DEFENDER OF DREYFUS
SUPREME COUNCIL OF WAR OF FRANCE.
For Denouncing the Methods of This Body and Its Action In the
Esterhazy Case Emile Zola Is Placed on Trial.
PARIS, Feb. 7. â " Whatever be the decision ot the jury
I shall be satisfied. My conscience is easy, for it alone dictated
my conduct, and 1 hold its sentence higher than any other
sentence. lam absolutely confident of the final success of my
efforts to clear Dreyfus, whose innocence, in my eyes, is as
clear as the light of the sun." This was Emile Zola's con
fession of faith made this morning before he left his house in
Rue de Bruxelles for the Palais de Justice, where he was to
stand upon his trial in one of the most remarkable of causes
celebres known to the present generation.
PARIS, Feb. T.â The trial of M. Emtle
Zola and M. Perreux, manager of the
Aurore, who are being prosecuted by
the Government as the result of a letter
which the novelist caused to be pub
lishel in the Aurore in December last, j
strongly reflecting upon high officials \
counected with the Dreyfus case, ',
opened to-day in the Assizes Court of !
the Seine M. Zola was- represented by!
M. Laborie and M. Perrieux was de
fended by M. Clemenceau.
The most keen public Interest was j
manifested in the case. Hundreds of
people surrounded the court anxious
to grain admittance. The crowds in
creased in number all the morning.
The arrival of Henri Rochefort was I
the signal for shouts of "Vive Roche- |
fort," and counter-cries of "A bas i
Rochefort." Turning in the direction
of the hostile cries, M. Rochefort j
nhouted: "It would seem that with '
four of you at five francs apiece the i
Dreyfus syndicate will not be ruined." '
M. Zola, who arrived in a carriage '
shortly afterward, was greeted with ye- :
* hement shouts of "Conspuez Zola" j
(spit upon Zola). An individual who
shouted "Vive Zola" was promptly
hustled and suppressed.
The proceedings commenced at 1 p.
m., under the presidency of M. de La [
Gorgue, who announced that the a. art j
would be cleared if there was any dem- j
onstration.
Although the court was thronged, j
quiet was maintained, owing to the |
knowledge that a company of repub- j
lican guards had been placed at the I
disposal of the judge to preserve order, j
While tta jury was being selected M. j
Zola entered the dock. He was pale. J
A few cries of "Vive Zola' were
promptly suppressed by the vigorous
protests of the majority nf f audi
ence.
After the reading of th"> indictment
the advocate-general explained that
the charge was strictly limited to the
passage in M. Zola's letter denouncing
the Esterhaiy court-martial.
Continuing, the advocate-general said
it was Imperative to prevent the pro
ceedings from wandering and "thus
playing into the hands of the accused,
whose aim it is to get a revision of the
Dreyfus affair by a circuitous route."
The court decided to allow the ac
cused to call evidence in support of the
other charges contained in his letter,
including the accusations which he
made against Colonel Paty dv Clam
and, Generals Mercier, Boisdeffre
Eliot and Pellieux. M. de La Gorgue
<r-ad a number of letters of excuse, in
cluding one from the Minister of jus
tice. M. Darlan, announcing that the
Minister for War, General Billot, had
not received the authority of the Cabi
net to testify. General de La Gorgue
tlso read a letter from ex-President
Cftsimir-Perier, Baying he could not
The San Francisco Call
! testify except as to facts subsequent to
his Presidency.
Colonel Paty dv Clam was then called
and refused to testify. If. Laborie
urged the importance of his testimony,
adding that unless the court ordered
I the witness to testify he might be com
\ pelled to demand an adjournment until
'. the next session. Counsel also said he
was not prepared to oppose a secret
! trial, If it was absolutely necessary,
"But," continued M. Laborie, "the alle
gation that the matter they discussed
: was connected with state secrets and
national defense was a mere joke."
The Advocate-General then protest^'!
! against the national defense belnar
I called a joke, to which M. Laborie hot!;.
i replied that he would not permit any
| one, not even the Advocate-General, to
j cast suspicion on hia patriotism.
I [Cheers.]
Addressing the Jury, M. Laborie
| said: "The proof we wish to show you
j Is so striking that our own opponents
| are making efforts to prevent its be
! coming known. Nevertheless, if It is
j necessary, I will declare it alone, with
i out witnesses. If I fail, Dreyfus will
1 remain in the galleys, where he was
placed by a law expressly made for
j him." [Violent protests.]
M. Laborie insisted that the judges of
â¢ Dreyfus should give evidence, and that
Mme. Boulancy, whom Zola had sum
j moned, but who has declined to appear
j on the ground of ill health, should also
I testify, urpinp that she be ordered to
i appear if necessary. Counsel added that
; Mme. Buulancy. in addition to the noto
: rious I'hlan letter, possessed others
from Major Esterhazy, outrageously in
sulting the French aimy, which had not
been published. M. Laborie further
contended that Major Esterhazy was
persecuting Mme. Boulancy in order to
prevent her from surrendering the let
ters.
Counsel for the Aurnre supported M.
Laborie's request for the appearance of
Mme. Boulancy, and urged the court to
obtain a verification of her alleged ill
health.
Later on M. Laborie insisted that the
depositions made before the examining
magistrate be read in court. This was
opposed by the Advocate-General on the
ground that the examination was not
concluded.
M. Laborie then violently protested
against the absence of the subpenaed
witnesses, and, referring to the non
appearance of General Mercier, said:
"When he was Minister of War he sub
mitted to the judges of Dreyfus, behind
the backs of the prisoner and his coun
sel, a secret document, which, how
ever, he said, was unimportant. If this
document, as he declared, was unim
portant, then the Incident is ended and
there is no further need for General
Mercier's testimony, but if, as alleged,
the scret document did not exist, let
General Mercier come and tell the court
so, and our side will ba satisfied."
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1898.
This attempt to drag: the former Min
1 ister of War into the witness stand
i caused much commotion in court,
which was increased when on several
' members of the Dreyfus court-martial
! refusing to testify M. Zola rose up in
I the dock and indignantly cried, "We
' must know if these persons are acting
under the orders of the Minister of
i War or their own volition."
General Boisdeffre was then called
i and claimed exemption on the ground
I of professional secrecy, whereupon M.
I Laborie shouted, "One would really
i think all these officers imagined they
I form a separate caste, above all rights,
I and that they are totally exempt from
i the laws and the respect due to Jus
j tice."
The court then ordered a short ad
journment until 4:30 p. m., in order to
allow M. Laborie to draft his argument.
On the resumption of the hearing M.
Laborie made a speech demanding that
the witnesses be ordered to attend and
testify. Counsel for M. Zola deposited
with the court written applications re
questing the court to order the sub
penaed wi tresses to appear.
Regarding Colonel Paty dv Clam, the
application charges him with illegal
acts in the Dreyfus and Esterhazy af
! fair, claiming that if these acts are
proved in court the good faith of the
accused will be demonstrated. There
fore, Colonel Paty dv Clam should be
I compelled to testify, or without pre
judice to the right of the appellants,
counsel would demand the postpone
ment of the trial to later sessions, if
necessary.
M. Laborie further affirmed that he
is prepared to show that the letters
which Colonel Paty dv Clam alleges
"the veiled lady" sent him, prejudicing

NEW YORK, Feb. 7.â There Is at
least one man in Greater New York to
day who holds the happiness, honor
and fortune of a great many people in
the hollow of his hand. This man is
W. E. D. Stokes. Mr. Stokes came into
possession of all the private papers of
William M. Tweed several years ago.
He has made a thorough study of them
with the idea of writing a book on the
subject.
According to his story more than
$11,000,000 was paid out by the "boss"
for bribes and buying up individuals
that other people to this day know
nothing about. Evidences of these pay
ments are still in existence with the in
dorsements of the parties directly con
cerned. The surrender of Tweed by
the Spanish Government after his es
cape from Ludlmv-street Jail is de
scribed by the papers in possession of
Mr. Stokes as a political stroke to se
cure the election of a Republican Presi
dent.
Mr. Stokes says also that there Is a
real confession of Tweed in existence
which is likely to be published and
which is bound to create the liveliest
kind of a stir. He says Tweed's diary
is the most Interesting of all the pa
pers. It contained references to every
one that called on him and his busi
ness, showing" thai nearly every one
could be treated with on a cash basis.
The papers were delivered to Mr.
Stokes by a man whom he had be
friended.

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 7.â The
Common Council has spoken,
and the water company is beat
en In its fight for delay. To-day
the Council adopted a resolution
giving the monopoly two weeks
in which to file a complete in
ventory of the property it took
from the city under lease thirty
years ago, together with all im
provements that have been made
since that time. If, at the end of
two weeks, the water company
has failed to comply, the city
will consider itself released from
any obligation to arbitrate as to
the value of the improvements,
and will take a default. This
action means that the Los An
geles lawmakers, after the mo
nopoly's proposed steal has been
laid bare to them by The Call,
intend to prevent the robbery of
the people who placed them in
power.
! LOS ANGELES. Feb. 7.â Tha pÂ»oplfe
of , Los Angeles, .thanks to the San
Franciso ' Call; have at last ' obtained
evidence In substantial shape that three
syndicated dallies and the water com
pany do not control -absolutely the
Common Council of , this city. That
body to-day took a most important for
ward step in the negotiations to bring
about municipal operation of the city's
water plant, now held under lease by
the City Water Company. The for
â¢ ward movement was in the nature of a
resolution adopted upon the advice of
City Attorney W. E. Dunn, demanding
of the water compnay officials that they
give to the city within two weeks an in
ventory of the property they took over |
from the city under lease thirty years |
ago, and an inventory of their improve- |
ments and the value they place upon '
them. 1 The water company was further
notified that if within a reasonable time |
l It failed to respond to this resolution j
the city would consider itself released i
from any obligation under the so-celled
1 contract between the city and the com
! pany.' ;'â¢'-:! *.-.â '
When the Council convened this
! morning it was apparent that some
! thing was about to be done to reassure j
! the people of this city and to allay the ;
j feeling that has been aroused by the j
1 exposures made in The Call of the man
j ncr in which the people's interests were
being trifled with in the negotiations
j with the water company. The Call had j
clearly shown that not a single for- j
ward step was being taken and that j
| owing to a nefarious newspaper com- i
bination made between the Times, Her- j
aid and Express, the people were being
deceived as to the real facts of the case.
But when a full exposition was made ;
by The Call, the aroused public senti
ment was so great that it became abso- i
lutely necessary for the easy going pub
lic officials to do something.
- The storm of indignation as to the
Times, Herald and Express for the pol- i
icy of deceit they had pursued toward
their readers and the protection of the '
! water company, was . manifested on i
every side. The papers were universally
condemned and denounced.
Toward the Council the wrath of the
people who felt that their interests in j
the water contest were not receiving
the attention they should, was directed.
On the other hand, Councilmen , Grider
and Hutchison and Mayor Snyder, who i
had made a consistent and honorable
struggle on behalf of the people, were ;
everywhere being received with ac- I
claim.
On all sides . The Call's effort to in- |
form the people of Los Angeles of the j
manner in which they were being be- |
trayed in the water negotiations met
with indorsement and commendation;
Resolutions were passed by the Demo-
I cratic City Central Committee, by the I
J Populist City Central Committee and i
I by the Los Angeles County Council of !
! Labor, representing 5000 organized toil
i ers, thanking The Call for the fight it
I was making" against the . : syndicated !
\ press of Los Angeles to save the tax- j
j payers of the municipality j from j being i

NEW YORK. Feb. 7.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: There is
no change in our relations with Spain.
There is nothing concealed under the
surface as to the President's policy. No
coup is meditated at present or in the
immediate future. Pessimistic press
dispatches from Madrid and Havana
show this is the exact condition of af
fairs.
President McKinley and his Cabinet
are serene. They are neither seeking
nor fearing trouble. At present there
is not the slightest cause for anxiety
on the part of any citizen. This morn
ing's dispatches from Madrid speak of
a new note delivered to the Spanish
Government on Saturday by Minister
Woodford and also replied to "in vigor
ous fashion" by the -Minister of For
eign Affairs. As a matter of fact Min
ister Woodford presented no new note
on Saturday. Six or seven weeks ago
this Government did send to Madrid
an answer ;to â  a note . which had been
received ;â  from | Spain in response
to .the communication delivered by
General Woodford earlier in the year,
or shortly after his arrival at his post.
If the Spanish v Government 'JiatK Just
mad? & r&ply t N any note of ours ft -tÂ»
to this one of last December, but the
reply cannot be of a serious or critical â¢
nature, for up to to-night the State De
partment had received no word con
cerning it from General Woodford.
It was officially announced 'at the
Navy Department to-day that the sec
ond-class battle-ship Maine would re
main at Havana. It â  was generally
expected that the vessel would join the
Texas during the present week and
proceed to New Orleans to represent
the navy at the Mardi Gras festival to
be held on January 21 and 22. In fact
it was stated at the department on Sat
urday last that orders directing the
execution of this programme would be
issued in a few days.
Communication between the Presi
dent and State and Navy departments
has caused the change in the pro
gramme, and the Maine will now stay
in Havana harbor for an "indefinite
period." It is stated that all is quiet
at Havana, but now that an American
ship is there it is desired to keep her
at that port to protect American Inter
ests should they be endangered.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.â The
Star, the chief organ of the an
nexationists, admits to-night
that the Japs will have the right
of naturalization, when it says:
"The fact is that they would
have the same opportunity after
annexation to become citizens
that they have now, and that all
Japanese now have, to become
citizens. The laws now probably
admit of any citizen or subject of
Japan coming to this country,
as do the subjects of other coun
tries, and becoming a citizen of
this country under the naturali
zation laws. The annexation of
Hawaii will not affect this ques
tion."
Call Office, Rlergs House,
Washington, Feb. 27.
Speaker Reed denies emphat
ically that he now favors Ha
waiian annexation and 1b ready
to put the Morgan annexation
bill through the House prompt
ly if the Senate fails to ratify
the treaty. He says the story
to that effect is an invention of
the annexationists and with
malice aforethought. He has not
changed his position, but is still
opposed to Hawaiian annexation
in any form.
It is evident that the treaty
is not likely to be ratified and
that it will be difficult, if not im
possible, to get annexation by
legislation. The Senate will hold
the matter up, at least until
President Dole leaves San Fran
cisco for Honolulu, so as to en
able him to be in Hawaii before
the news of the adverse action
can reach there, lest there should
be disturbances there.
It is understood that our representa
tives at Honolulu have been given dis
cretion to raise the American flag and
declare a protectorate if disturbances
occur, and if the annexation scheme
fails the islands may be seized in this
way.
The alleged change of attitude on the
part of the Speaker toward the Ha
waiian question is the chief subject of
gossip in Washington to-day. As cur
rent report has it Reed has undergone
a change of heart on the question of
annexation generally. There is no
good reason to believe this. What has
been interpreted as a reversal of opin
ion is probably only a change of ad
ministrative tactics. For months the
Speaker has been holding the House
in check to keep it from running away
with itself. All this time he has been
hoping against hope for a change of
sentiment, believing tnat the House
was simply smitten now as it has been
smitten before with a madness, epi
demic among the masses of the people.
But he has become convinced that the
check-rein is no longer a self-depend
ence. The administration having com
mitted itself to Hawaiian annexation
and the rank and file of their constit
uents having either actively espoused
the idea or at least assented to it, re
ports from parts of the country which
seemed least likely to favor any ac
quisition of outside territory have an
nounced to the Speaker that they
would certainly have to vote to annex
Hawaii if the question should ever
come before the House. So the proba
bility is that if the Senate fails to rat
ify the treaty and the Morgan Joint
resolution is pressed in its place, the
Speaker will permit the House to reach
a speedy vote. In other words, he will
bow to the inevitable and get a trouble
some subject permanently out of the
track of the necessary appropriation
bills, and thus further his plan of early
adjournment and a long and hot cam
paign for control of the next House.
The opponents of annexation still
cherish the hope that if the Morgan
resolution is substituted for the treaty,
the House may insist upon amending
it out of shape. They think that am
bitious members will try to improve
the phraseology or introduce new ele
ments for the sake of having their
names figure in history as Wilmofs and
Gadsden's and others have figured, and
that if the Morgan resolution should
go back to the Senate seriously disfig
ured it might be lost in the wrangle
between the two houses which would
follow.
This is a frail fabric of hope, how
ever. The more imminent danger is
that the news of the Speaker's morÂ»
moderate attitude will produce an ef
fect upon the Senate in favor of ratify
ing the treaty. Some of the Senator*2
who have been standing out a.erainst
the treaty are not absolutely wedded to
their present position, and when it
comes to their knowledge that Hawaii
is to be annexed anyway by resolution
if not by treaty, they may succumb
on the ground that nothing can be
gained by further resistance, and vote
to â  atify.
Referring to the statement that he
personally favored annexation, Reed is
quoted as saying: "Of course, it is a
fake." The Speaker declined to discuss
the matter further.
Inquiry among leaders of the House,
Dingley, Dalzell. lliit and others, dis
closed the fact that so far as they knew
the Speaker's attitude toward the mat
ter had nut been < banged.
ADVOCATES NOW
ADMIT WEAKNESS.
Senators May Soon Have to Abandon
the Treaty of Annexa
tion.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.â Just before
the Senate went into executive session
y Morgan of Alabama proposed
the following amendment to the resolu
tion of "White of California concerning
the country's attitude toward Hawaii:
That tht republic of Hawaii, estal

And said Government of the republic of

tit in the manni r provided i:i its
constitution that the Hawaiian Islands,
with all the territory appurtenant thereto,
which said Government now claims
to â¢ xercise sovereign jurisdiction, shall be
annexed to and become a part of the
territory of th* United States of
and shall be subject to

the rational and sovereign juris
n thereof, it Is hereby en
acted and declared that such concession
is accepted, ratified and confirmed, and
that said Hawaiian Islands are annexed
rritory of the United
- of America and are subject to the
sovereign dominion th<
Davis of Minnesota, chairman of the â 
Committee on Foreign Relations,
moved that the resolution of "White and j
the amendment thereto proposed by
Morgan be referred to the Foreign Re- !
lations Committee, and after a brief i
en White and Morgan j
tfc resolution and amendment were so i
referred. On motion of Davis the Sen- j
ate then went into executive pension.
Teller of I Colorado occupii <i the entire j
four hours of the executive session in !
discussing the Hawaiian annexation
treaty. During the course of his speech I
Teller took occasion to say that he
Should have been glad to discuss the j
treaty in open session and to the re
mark he added the opinion that the
time- had almost come when the ques- ;
tlon of annexation should be debated j
on .-i bill looking to legislation by both ;
bouses of Coi - rather than 'on the
basis of the treaty. While he thought
there might he a bare possibility of se
curing the sixty votes necessary to
ratify the treaty, he conceded that un
<;â¢â¢;â  the present circumstances this was
lingly doubtful, and he thought
the sooner the fact be recognized and
a change of front made the better it
I be from all points of view.
There were some interruptions at this
point ami it was suggested by some
Senators, after the close of the execu
tive session, that the Committee on
- m Relations would consider the
advisability of making this change of
policy at its next meeting, to be' held
on Wednesday of this week.
The statement was. however, made
by Senator Davis, chairman of the
nittee on Foreign Relations, that
there had been no Intention of attach
ing the treaty to one of the appropria
tion bills as an amendment as had
been stated was the case in some of
the newspapers. He made this state
ment in reply to a question put by
Senator White of California.
Senator Teller advocated the ratifica
tion of the treaty, basing his reasons
for this position upon the ground that
the annexation of the islands was in
the Interest of our commerce and in line
with our national policy f or t h e past
half century. He devoted himself very
largely to replying to the objection that
had been raised to acquiring the islands
because of the domination of the native
race. He undertook to show that there
was- no found.,; ion for this criticism,
or if there was sifMi foundation now
it need not, he said, Ion? continue to be
sential factor of the situation. He

Which he produced to show that the na
. or kanakas, were rapidly dying
off as a result of theireomminglingwith
outside races. He contended that the
islanders could not long remain to dis
pute the supremacy of some other race,
and what race that would be depended
largely upon the present action of the
United States Senate. If we shouid
elect to make the islands a part of the
United States the American people
.would at once become the counseling
element in Hawaii, but if we should fail
i to take advantage of the opportunity
! now offered, some other people would
in all probability assume the position of
control, which naturally and tradition
' ally belongs to the United States.
Taking up this line of argument.^ he
said that ever since the days of Web
' ster and Marcy a majority of the peo
! pie of this country had believed that
'â  the Hawaiian Islands should be and
would some day become an integral
part of the United States. With the
struggle that was about to begin in the
Orient for the possession of new terri
tory among the European powers, it
j was indeed a short-sighted man, he
stated, who would contend that Ha
waii occupying so important a location
; as it does, in the middle of the Pacific
Ocean could be left untouched oy
some of the land-grabbing nations of
the Old World. Under the present eir
1 cumstances it was absurd for this Gov
ernment to try to maintain a system or
control without taking actual posses
ile controverted the position of Sen
rs Pettigrew and White that the
leric&n could not labor in the Ha
lian Islands. He quoted weather
tistics to show that the temperature
the islands' coasts ranged froms6de
es to 8S degrees during the year,
ich, he said, was far from being an
oppressively hot climate. Farther in
land it was still cooler, and on the
mountains frosts were not infrequent.
If the white naÂ«n of this country were
not impressed with the islands. Teller
thought they would make an excellent
tion for" the colored people of the
United Stales who might desire to
leave this country, and would find con
genial employment in the sugar plan
tations and coffee fields of Hawaii.
ler also discussed the contention
that the Hawaiian group was not on
the most direct line of travel between
the Western Hemisphere and China
or Japan. Any vessel which might
â¢ around the Horn or cross the
[sthmus of Panama in the case of the
I ruction of a canal, would almost
inly take these islands in on its
way to Yokohama, Shanghai or any
other far eastern port. Furthermore,
the islands were a great convenience as
a coaling and good supply point to ves
seis plying the Pacific Ocean.
Taking up the question of the neces
sity for the defense of the islands and
. t the maintenance of the large fleet in
their waters in case of annexation, he
said that this was a mere bugaboo, and
Ks without foundation in fact. All
t would be necessary would b<? to
ify Pearl 1-arbor for the protec
tion of coal and military stores in times
of hostility. With all our stores of this
character located at one spot, as they
could easily be, and that particular
-; t strongly entrenched and well
armed, there could be no need to guard
other portions of the islands, for it was
not to be supposed that any hostile na
tion would for mere sentiment send a
fleet thousands of miles across the wa
ters in order to attack and destroy any
defenseless communities there simply
because they were subject to the Gov
tment of "the United States,
eller went extensively into the his
y of the islands from IS3O to 1850 to
show that both Englishmen and
Frenchmen had forced treaties of ces-
Xi out of the rulers of the islands,

ted during the delivery of his speech
Senators White, Pettigrew, Gear
. others.
NO ONE SPOKE
FOR ANNEXATION.
But Mr. Shearman and Dr. Abbott
Told of the Great Wrong
Contemplated.
NEW YORK, Feb. 7.â Of nearly five
hundred persons assembled in Ply
mouth Church lecture room to-night
not one arose to voice opposition to the
statements of Thomas G. Shearman,
well known in Brooklyn, and Dr. Ly
man Abbott, that to annex Hawaii to
the United States would, be a great
wrong. The meeting had been called
for the purpose of discussing "Our
Duty as a Christian Nation Toward
Hawaii."
It was to have been a free discussion,
but as nobody took issue with Mr.
Shearman, who was the first speaker,
Dr. Abbott, who was to have rendered
a judicial derision, merely closed the
proceedings with his opinion. Mr.
Shearman referred first to the settle
ment of American missionaries and
their families in Hawaii, and said that
eventually the children of the mission
aries acquired most of the wealth of
the Islands.
"I don't object to their getting
wealth," said Mr. Shearman, "but they
were wrong to plan It so that the
United States was made to start the
revolution-"
Mr. Shearman spoke of the concen
tration of wealth and capital, and what
it might do if wrongfully inclined. He
said there were corrupt men and
bodies in this country who are not
satisfied with a republic, they cor
j rupted legislatures and bought Sena
t tors.
"These men are looking for a man on
horseback," he said, "and they expect
him to come some day and they will
own him. They want to take away our
liberties and establish an empire."
Dr. Abbott said he disagreed with
1 Mr. Shearman as to the wrong of the
': revolution, but he agreed with him as
i to the wrong of annexing the islands.
"I do not think wo ought to annex
them," he said. "They seem able to
properly govern themselves. We don't
want to say to these 34.000 people that
they must be forced into our union.
I Our country is quite large enough and
i all that we can 'ake care of. It is not
j wise to Increase our population, but it
I is to make it stronger."

visited by a heavy hailstorm at 4
o'clock this afternoon. None so severe
had been known here before. The
ground was covered with hailstones
measuring from one to one and a half
Inches in diameter, making a solid
layer more than two Inches in thick
ness throughout the town. The ditches
and crevasses are filled. The storm
came from the east, and there is hardly
a window pane on the east sides of the
buildings left in the town. Consider
able damage has been done to the
buildings by displacing shingles from
the roofs. To what extent this storm
reached and what damage has been
done in the country cannot be told at
this time.
STOCKTON, Feb. 7.â Wheat-raisers
and fruit-growers in this section are

have been brightened greatly by the
rain which began Saturday, and which
continued with slight intermissions up
to 1 o'clock to-day. Since the begin
ning of the storm there has fallen .65
of an inch. This is sufficient to give
grain a good start, and unless a long
dry spell follows there will be an im
mense harvest.
MERCED, Feb. 7.â The long-looked
for rain came as a shower of blessings
to the farming community on Satur
day evening and the farmers are ac
cordingly happy. On Saturday evening
the rainfall amounted to .27 of an inch
and on Monday it amounted to .49 of
an inch. The wind is blowing a gale
from the south, and the prospects are
good for more rain to-night.
MONTEREY, Feb. 7.â A pouring rain
began here about midnight last night,
continuing until 'J o'clock this morning.
The entire precipitation was .72 of an
inch._ Advices from outlying districts
state' that this breaking of the drought
was a boon to ranchmen and cattlemen,
coming just in time to save the hay
and other crops. Grass was especially
benefited by the rain, and many hun
dreds of cattle saved.
BAKERS FIELD, Feb. 7.â lt began
raining here at 4 o'clock this afternoon
and by 5 o'clock .26 of an inch had
fallen. It was just the kind of rain
that was needed â warm and gentle. In
dications are that more rain will fall
to-night. This makes 3.04 inches for
the season. The grass on the plains
and foothills had just started. This
shower wll cause it to shoot up rap-
idly.
SALINAS, Feb. 7.â The long-looked
for rain has come at last and every one
is happy. The precipitation has been
general all over the county and enough

.52; Chualar, .60; San Miguel, .78; Pa
jaro, .90. The indications are good for
more rain.
POMONA, Feb. 7.â lt has been rain
ing in Pomona Valley and throughout
this region all this day. The indica
tions are that it will rain through to
night and to-morrow. The farmers, or
chardlsts and sugar-beet growers who
have been somewhat blue are happy.
HOLLISTER, Feb. 7.â The rainfall
for the storm here was a half-inch.
It greatly benefits feed and crops. The
weather is warm and threatens more
rain.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 7.â A gentle
rain commenced shortly after midnight
last night and has been falling steadily
slnce. It is hardly more than a heavy
mist, but the clouds are becoming more
threatening and the expectation is that
Southern California is to have a gen
eral copious downpour, which is
greatly needed.
TEMPLETON, Feb. 7.â Much-needed
rain commenced last night and contin
ued all day. Farmers feel better. Much
more is needed to assure a crop. The
total for the season is 3.40 inches. Last
season to date it was 11.13.
VISALIA, Feb. 7.â Rain commenced
falling on Saturday night and the fall
up to this evening was .76 of an inch,
making 3.58 inches for the season. Rain
was badly needed and will make the

SANDBAGGED BY
HIS PRISONERS
Two Culprits Make a Murder
ous Attack Upon a
Jailer.
With thÂ« Assistance of a Trusty He
Succeeds in Preventing
an Escape.
Special DlFratch to The Call.
OROVILLE, Feb. 7.â Two prisoners in
the local prison made a desperateattempt
to escape last night, and in the attendant
struggle one of them struck Jailer John
Boyles on the head with a bludgeon.
Boyles at 7:45 o'clock entered the depart
ment where John Valllore and Fred Gar
rity were confined. Valliere had made a
sandbag by saving all the salt he could
obtain, wetting it so as to make it hard
as a rock. ITo tied a string around the
stocking and lay in wait for the jailer.
When Boyles entered Valliere struck
him a terrific blow across the face and
knocked him down. Luckily the blow was
across the cheek instead of on the tem
ple, so Boyles was not badly injured. He
was then attacked by Valliere and Gar
rity, and would have fared badly had not
a "trusty rushed to his assistance and
succeeded in pulling off one of his oppo
nents. Boyles had a severe struggle be
fore he could overpower Valliere, who
struck at him a number of times with
the sandbag. The jailer used a heavy
umbrt-lla handle with such effect as to
floor the convict finally, and he then put
him In iron?.
Valliere had recently been convicted of
burglary, and will be sentenced to State
prison to-morrow.

SPEECH OF
THE QUEEN
To Be More Remarkable
for Omissions Than
Contents.
No Settlement Arrived At Re
specting Affairs in
China.
Public Curiosity as to Events in the
Soudan Not Likely to Be
Gratified.
Special Dispatch '- The Call.
LONDON, Feb. 7.â The Queen's
speech to Parliament to-morrow is ex
pected to be long, but rather more re
markable for its omissions than its
contents. It is quite evident that no
settlement has yet been arrived at re
specting China which will admit of
more than a bare mention. The same
applies to the "West African difficulty
with France and the troublesome Cre
tan negotiations, which are again in a
state of collapse.
The public is anxious to learn more
about the Soudan advance, but it is not
likely to be gratified to any extent. It
Is said, however, that there will be a
long reference to the West Indies and
the sugar commission. No proposal
will be made to relieve the Indian ex
chequer of the costs of -the campaign
on the northwest frontier.
The message addressed specially to
the House of Commons will deal large
ly with the intended Increase In the
army estimates, with a view of
strengthening the army and amending
the conditions of the service. Some
fourteen new bills are mentioned, most
ly of local interest.
The Marquis of Salisbury and the
other leaders gave the customary par
liamentary dinners this evening. Lord
Rosebery returned to town to-day from
Naples.

der the contract in writing purported to
have been made between the Mayor and
Common Council of the city of Los An

Griffin, Beaudry and Lazard, parties of
the second part, bearing date of July 20,
IS6S, and recorded in the office of the
County Recorder of the county of Los
Angeles, State of California, in book 1, of
miscellaneous records, pages 428 et seq.,
be and they are hereby requested to fur
nish, as soon as practicable, to this Coun
cil, an itemized list or inventory with a
particular description of all the water
works purported to be leased to said
Griffin, Beaudry ;iiid Lazard in and by
said contract.' and also of the Improve
ments made In, about and upon said wai
ter works in pursuance of said contract,
(the value of which improvements the
municipal corporation, the city of Los
Angeles, is, according to the terms of the
said contract, obligated to pay said Grif
fln, Beaudry and Lazard or their assigns
at the expiration of thirty years from
the execution of said contract), together
with the name or names of the corpora
tion or corporations, person or persons,
entitled to receive payment of the value
of each and every parcel of said improve
ments under and by virtue of the terms
of said contract.
Resolved, further, That in case said
successors in interests of said Griffin,
Beaudry and Lazard fail or refuse to
furnish, within a reasonable time, to this
Council, such list or Inventory, the city
of Los Angeles will consider itself re
leased from any obligation of endeavor
ing to agree upon the value of said im-
provements with said successors, or of
arbitrating with them concerning such
value.
Resolved, further, That the City Attor
ney be and he is hereby directed to trans
mit a copy of these resolutions to the Los
Angeles City Water Company and to the
Crystal Springs Land and Water Com
pany, and to demand from each of said
companies compliance therewith.
Mr. Hutchison offered to amend so
as to require an answer from the wa
ter company within two weeks. Messrs.
Nickell and Toll argued that the rec-
ommendation of the city's legal advis
ers should be adopted literally and
without change. Mr. Grider supported
the amendment and the roll was called.
In explaining his motion Mr. Toll in
sisted that no matter what action
might afterward be taken In regard to
the matter by the Council, there was no
question that the resolution should be
adopted as offered. The amendment
was lost and the motion for the adop
tion of the resolution carried.
Later Mr. Hutchison Introduced the
motion which unanimously carried
that two weeks be fixed as the time
within which the water company shall
file its inventory.
This is the first resolution that the
present Council has adopted which has
had about it anything to indicate that
the city meant business In its dealings
with the water company. It will be
noted that the corporation Is this time
informed that the city will take a de
fault in the event of its failure to re
spond within two weeks. If this policy
is continued and this corporation is
given to understand that the Council is
not to be trifled with, municipal con
trol will be an assured fact within six
months, and the syndicated local press
will have met with a complete rout.
The Council also adopted the follow
ing resolution this afternoon:
Resolved, That the Water Supply Com
mittee be hereby instructed to reopen ne
gotiations with the Westside Water Com
pany with reference to a possible pur
chase of that portion of their plant used
in furnishing water to the inhabitants of
the city.
The Westside "Water Company is a
minor corporation and until an investi
gation is made no one knows what it
has to sell to the city, if anything.
There will be strenuous objections
made to unloading on tne municipality
a lot of valueless stuff in the shape of
rusty water mains and inadequate wa
ter rights, whether owned by the West
side Water Company or any other cor
poration.

WINEMAKERS
HEAVILY FINED
Penalty Imposed Upon
the Barton Estate
Vineyard.
Found Guilty of Having Vio
lated Laws Governing
Distilling.
Ordered, to Pay Over Fifteen Thou
sand Dollars Into the Govern
ment Coffers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Feb. 7.â A sensation has
just come to light in connection with
the Barton estate vineyard, one of the
largest in the county. It has become
known that the vineyard has been very
heavily assessed by the United States
Government for irregularities' in the
matter of distilling, the penalty fixed
being the unusually heavy fine of $15,
240. The report upon which the big as
sessment w r as based was made by Rev
enue Agent B. M. Thomas, who visited
the vineyard last November in com
pany with Al Griffin, the local revenue
officer. In addition to the heavy pen
alty imposed on the owners of the prop
erty, the United States Gauger sta
tioned there, Mr. Lampkin, was sus
pended, and about a week ago he re
ceived word of his dismissal from the
service.
Revenue Agent Thomas received in
formation that the vineyard was not
being conducted in conformity with the
United States revenue regulations, and
last November he and Griffith made an
inspection. They verified the report by
questioning the gauger and Colonel
Trevelyan, the manager of the place.
The still was not surveyed accurately,
and It produced more than it was
gauged to do in a given time. In order
to make the still appear to produce the
proper amount the books were doc
tored, false entries being made of the<
number of days in which it was run, a
greater number of days being marked
in the books of the gauger than the still
was actually in operation. When ques
tioned in regard to doctoring the books,
Gauger Lampkin admitted it, but when
Colonel Trevelyan was asked in refer
ence to the days in which the still was
operated he declared that it was run
on all the days that the books showed
it to have run.
The revenue agent made his report to
the commissioner at Washington, who
fixed the amount of the penalty at the
heavy figure stated. The news of the
action of the commissioner was soon
whispered about among the vineyard
ists and wine-makers and it created a
big sensation, as the fine is regarded
as particularly heavy, and, if it is col
lected, it will seriously cripple the es
tate.
Ex-Deputy Collector of Internal Rev
enue Toungberg arrived here to-day
from San Francisco, and has been re
tained by the Barton estate to en
deavor to procure a reduction of the as
sessment or an abatement. He In
quired into the facts and will present a
petition to the commissioner at Wash
ington, asking for an abatement. It is
believed here, however, that it will be
extremely difficult to prevail upon the
commissioner to even reduce the pen
alty.
TRIAL OF ZOLA.
Continued from First Page.
Colonel Picquart, emanated from one
of Colonel Paty dv Clam's own friends
and not from Colonel Picquart. Coun
sel is willing that Colonel Paty dv
Clam's evidence be given behind closed
doors if necessary.
There is another application calling
for the appearance of Generals Mercier
and Boisdeffre and others. It declares
that they have no right to absent them
selves on the plea that their evidence
is not necessary, as that is for the court
and not for them to decide.
The court postponed decision until
to-morrow and the case was ad
journed.
Rain prevented a large crowd from
assembling around the court, but the
corridors of the courthouse were
packed with people warmly discussing
the trial.
On the conclusion of the proceedings
as General Genz, who was present in
the courtroom in full uniform emerged,
accompanied by an orderly, he was
greeted with shouts of "Vive l'armee,"
and a number of people followed him,
cheering until the police dispersed
them.
M. Zola conferred with his counsel,
M. Laborie, for half an hour in a pri
vate room and then left by a private
staircase and emerged through the por
ter's lodge, but he was recognized as
he drove away. The crowd was divided,
some cheering the novelist and others
denouncing him.
WAS THE WILL SIGNED
AFTER CREEDE'S DEMISE?
Contestants Introduce Testimony to
Prove Their Remarkable
Contention.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 7.â The raking of
testimony in the Creede will case was re
sumed to-day before Judge Clark. The
contestants introduced Ben Goodrich, an
attorney, who testified that John T.
Jones, the attorney for the proponents of
the will, had told him several days after
Creede's death that the will was not
signed. William Phlefer, a brother-in-law
of Creede. swore that he was at the
house during the entire week prior to
July 7, 1807. the date of the alleged sign
ing of the will, and Creode was not there
during that period of time. Max Gumpel,
the San Francisco expert, testified that
the name of N. C. â¢ Creede had lirst been
stamepd upon the paper with a glycerine
stamped upon the paper with a glycerine
over with a pen.
After argument by the attorneys for
both sides of the case was taken under
advisement by the court.

Proposals.
And England Will Prevent the

Troubled Empire.
Meanwhile an imperial Decree
Authorizes the Issuance of
Five Per Cent Bonds.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Feb. 7.â The Peking corre
spondent of the Times, telegraphing
yesterday, Bays: I have reasons to be
lieve that China will be induced to de
cline the British proposals in conse
quence of Russia's opposition, and sim
ilarly that she will be unable to accept
the Russian proposals owing to Eng
land's opposition. The country is help
less and unable to pay the indemnity
except by installments; but, China
nurses the hope that Japan will agree
to an extension of time.
Meanwhile, an imperial decree au
thorizes an issue of treasury bonds at
5 per cent to the amount of one hundred
million taels (about $78,000,000). It ap
peals to the officials, the gentry and
merchants to assist the issue in the re
mote possibility of raising enough to
meet the installment due next May.
The method proposed increases the
growing distrust In the Government.
Similar bonds issued at the time of the
war of 1859 were -repudiated in 1862. The
unsatisfactory and evasive nature of
the royal edict exacted by Germany in
condemnation of the Shan-Tung mur
ders affords Germany the desired pre
text for remaining in military occupa
tion of the territory, including the town
of Kioachau, beyond the area leased.
China still maintains that the murder
of the German sailor was justifiable
homicide and due to the sailor's mis
conduct, but she is powerless to refuse
Germany's exactions.
NEW FAST TRAINS
MAKE GOOD RUNS
Union Pacific Specials Enter Chicago
and Denver Ahead of Schedule
Time.
DENVER, Feb. 7.â The Colorado spe
cial, the new fast train of the Union
Pacific and Northwestern line, pulled into
the Union station here to-day at 1:20, ten
minutes ahead of scheduled time, having
accomplished the run from Chicago, 1062
miles, in twenty-eight and one-half hours.
A large crowd was present at the station
to greet this innovation in rapid train
service. The efficiency of the new ser
vice had been conclusively proven, and its
success seems only a matter of time
enough for patrons to accustom them
selves to the new schedule.
The run from Omaha to Denver was
enlivened by an exciting race between the
Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, which
left Chicago simultaneously with the
Northwestern. The latter reached the
switch a few minutes ahead of the Bur
lington. General Manager Edward Dick
inson, Assistant General Passenger Agent
Alfred Darlow and other officials of the |
Union Pacific boarded the special at '
Omaha and made the run into Denver.
CHICAGO, Feb. 7.â The "Chicago Spe- !
cial," the new fast train from Denver,
over the Union Pacific, Denver and Gulf,
the Union Pacific and the Chicago and
Northwestern railways, finished its first
trip two minutes ahead of schedule time. \
When it pulled into the Northwestern
station at 8:43 this evening all the engines
in the yard tooted a loud greeting. The :
run of 1062 miles from Denver to Chicago
was made in twenty-eight hours and thir
teen minues, and officials of the three
lines over which the train is routed, say
the running time can be cut from one to
two hours if desired. No serious hitch
occurred anywhere on the road during
the first run, but at several points the
train was detained from ten to fifteen
minutes, and while the time thus lost was
being made up it ran in some places faster
than a mile a minute. The run of 490
miles from Council Bluffs to Chicago,
over the Northwestern's fine roadway,
protected by block signals, was made in
thirteen hours and eighteen minutes.

PITTSBURG, Feb. 7.â Because at the
last moment she refused to marry him,
You Fos, a Chinese laundryman, will sue
Amanda Johnston of Altoona for breach
of promise. You recently came from Al
toona, where he had attended a Chris
tian Sunday-school. Miss Johnston was
the teacher and You fell in love with her.
He says his affection was reciprocated.
The Chinaman made frequent trips to
Altoona. On Saturday, when he returned.
Miss Johnston accompanied him.
The bringing home of his bride had a
different ending from that which You Fos
had pictured. Yesterday he called upon
Rev. J. H. Tarbell, pastor of the Congre
gational church, and asked the pastor to
perform the marriage ceremony. Rev
Mr. Tarbell refused. Instead of carrying
the couple the minister advised the young
womannot to wed the Chinaman. He
induced her to change her "J^nd. and sn
remained at his house as Mrs. Tarbell a
â,,,,â she left for her home to-aay.
Tn addition to Suing Miss Johnston foj
breach of promise You says he will Â»v*

SMUGGLING
WHISKY IN
FIR LUMBER
Revenue Officer at Skaguay Finds
Liquor in Hollow Timbers
Received There.
PORTLAND, Or., Feb. 7.â The latest thing in Alaska whisky
smuggling devices is an eight-foot stick of 12x12 fir, containing a tube
filled with two gallons of "forty-rod whisky," which was,just captured
in Skaguay. Luke Smith of Portland, Deputy Under Collector of Cus
toms, has written to his father here an account of the capture.
When one of the Seattle steamers arrived three weeks ago she
brought among other freight a quantity of timber which was uncon
signed. It was thrown loosely on the dock and remained for several
days. Then two half-breeds who sweep out a saloon were seen to
come down the wharf and start to carry it away piece by piece. The
way they acted led young Smith, who was detailed to keep an eye on
the wharf, to suspect that something was wrong and he suddenly
stepped toward them, whereupon each dropped the stick he was car
rying and ran away. Smith examined the planks and found nothing
suspicious, but on overhauling the pile he found that one of the heavy
pieces of timber was bored, the end being plugged up with dirt, which,
when scraped out, revealed the presence of a long tube, lightly sol
dered up.
None of the other timbers were "loaded," but it Is believed that
severa' t-ontaining whisky had been carried away. The half-breeds
have not been seen in Skaguay since the flight, but â¢ the saloon where
they were employed is being carefully watched, although a search
failed to bring to light any evidence of smuggled goods in it.
class space was sold to adventurers,
notwithstanding the fact that the Gov
ernment had given notice that it want
ed space for fifty-one men. The army
officers were given the best staterooms
on the ship, but the men were left un
til the last, and when it came time to
allot them quarters it was found there
were none for them._ The only thing
that could be done was to swing bunks
for them in the small space below decks
in the prow of the ship, 25x20 feet, and
separated from fifty horses and twenty
dogs only by a few bales of hay, and
where the air was foul and unbearable.
The men complained to their sergeant,
who explained the situation to the cap
tain, who in turn laid the matter be
fore the captain of the ship. That offi
cer said he could do nothing.
Upon receiving this reply the soldiers
held a meeting. Much excitement pre
vailed, as by this time other passen
gers learned the facts and a committee
examined the quarters, pronouncing
them unfit for any human habitation,
much less for Uncle Sam's troops. On
the last trip of the Elder two dogs were
smothered to death in the same place
and many horses were in such condition
that they were unfit for work. The
army surgeon condemned the quarters
as unhealthy. The men then passed a
resolution to abandon the ship on ar
rival at Astoria and so notified Captain
Eldridge, stating that their action must
not be taken as a desertion from the
i army. The army officers held a con
j sultation, but saw no way out of the
! difficulty. One of the passengers offered
his services, backed by all the cabin
passengers, and called on Captain Hin
kle, proposing that the soldiers be per
mitted to sleep on the floor of the main
saloon. Captain Hinkle was equal to
the emergency, and while exceeding his
authority in associating second-class
passengers with first class consented to
the arrangement and thus a disastrous
delay to the Government's relief expe
dition was averted.
Just before the Elder left Portland a
number of passengers presented tickets
for passage which were dishonored by
the steamer. They had been purchased
iin Chicago of the Chicago Ice and
j Transportation Company at a cost of
j $200 each and bore coupons reading
I "From Portland to Dyea." The steam
i ship people said they had not been con
i suited by the Chicago company and had
j made no arrangements to carry its pas-
I sengers. The people are very indig
| nant and believe they have been de
frauded by Chicago sharpers. Many of
| them have no means to buy other
i tickets. __

RETALIATION
IS IN ORDER
Trade War May Soon Be
Inaugurated Against
Germany.
Congress May Counteract the
Recent Decrees of Dis
crimination.
There Is a Disposition In Prussia to
Cinch Importers of Ameri
can Products.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 7.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: There is a
decided sentiment in Congress in favor
of retaliation against Germany if offi
cial information should confirm the re
ports that have been cabled as to the
recent action of the German Govern
ment in excluding American fruits and
horses from German markets.
With a view to obtaining official in
formation, William Alden Smith of
Michigan, one of the members of the
Committee on Foreign Affairs, to-day
introduced In the House a resolution
asking the President to send to the
House the correspondence between the
State Department and the American
Embassador at Berlin regarding the
alleged adulteration dof German wines
and regarding the discrimination by
the German Government against Amer
ican exports of beef, fruits and horses.
Should any retaliatory legislation be
brought forward it would come through
the Committee on Ways and Means,
and the subject has been occupying the
attention of the members of that com
mittee. Members of the committee have
been talking the situation over infor
mally and exchanging views as to the
action which ought to be taken. Some
of them favor leaving the whole subject
to the executive branch of the Govern
ment and trust to the President to
take suitable action under the provision
of the law of 1890, which authorizes him
to retaliate against any country which
discriminates against American pro
ducts by excluding any products of
that country from the United States.
Other members of the committee favor
legislation to meet this particular case
in the way of imposition of higher du
ties on articles coming from countries
which discriminate against the United
States or refuse to admit American
products, either directly or indirectly,
by the establishment of decrees and
regulations intended to exclude such
products.
American lumber is now subject to
discrimination at the hands of the
Prussian Government, according to the
report of the United States Consul at
Bremen, Mr. Keenan. The Consul
transmits the complaints of a number
of lumber dealers against what they
regard as discriminating charges
against the carriage of American pitch
pine by Prussian railways. This pitch
pine is listed as class 1 at higher rate
than class 2, on which is listed similar
wood from Sweden, Norway and other
countries. It is also said that Ameri
can pitch pine is allowed to go at a
lower rate if the officials do not know
where it originates. The trad-? is con
siderable, and this Prussian railway is
the only means by which wood can be
taken into the interior, so the discrim
ination is keenly felt, says the Consul.

Thomas Belew Visits the Prison to
See the Fiend for the
Lust Time.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SUISUN, Feb. 7.â Frank Belew went
to pieces this morning, in spite of the
fact that he had apparently been grow
ing stronger ever since his confession.
He said to-day that he had been im
posed upon by those who induced him
to tell the story of his crime, as they
had led him to believe all his friends
had deserted him and that his attor
neys had given up the case as hopeless.
When seen at the Jail, the prisoner
was pale and nervous, trembling as if
he had a chill.
At 1 o'clock he was led, accompanied
by several deputy sheriffs, to the jus
tice's office, where the complaint
against him was read. He was advised
that he was not obliged to make any
statements and that he had a legal
right to be aided by an attorney. He
accepted the information meekly, stat
ing that he was aware of his rights and
that he had no objection if the pre
liminary examination were set for to
morrow. He was of the opinion that he
ought to plead guilty and ask the mer
cy of the court. It would simplify the
work of the District Attorney if this
course were pursued. He will, how
ever, plead not guilty and rely upon a
technical defense.
Belew was seen several times this af
ternoon and to-night. He was far more
cheerful than he had been before since
his arrest, and he refused to discuss his
crime.
By far the most pathetic scene of
the day was when Thomas Belew vis
ited the jail this afternoon.
"Did you kill dear Susie and Louis?"
he asked amid sobs soon after he
visited the cell.
"I did it and I cannot tell why I did
it," was the reply.
"Then good by, brother," was the
dramatic answer, as he grasped the
trembling prisoner by the hand. Sud
denly throwing out the palms of both
hands, as if to wave Frank away,
Thomas finally exclaimed In the very
storm of grief and despair:
"Good by, for I'll never see you
again."
Sheriff Rush met him at the door of
the jail and said:
"I hope you will recall this and come
again, for the poor devil needs some
one to brace him up."
Thomas nurrled away, making no
response.
Belew is afraid to be alone. Though
he seems firm to-night in the deter
mination to plead not guilty and abide
by the result, there is no certainty that
he will stand by the determination.
CHRIS VON DER
AHE KIDNAPED
Stolen Bodily in St. Louis by
an Officer Sent From
Pittsburg.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PITTSBURG, Feb. ".-The Pittsburg
Dispatch this morning contains the fol
lowing telegram from a staff correspond
ent, dated St. Louis, Mo.: Chris yon der
Ahe, the baseball magnate, was taken
into custody here last evening by a Pitts
burg detective. The most unique char
acter in the sporting world was really
kidnaped and is now on his way to the
Smoky City, where his body may be held
for an indefinite period on a judgment
given by the courts in the suit brought
by Mark E. Baldwin, the baseball pitcher.
The kidnaping of Mr. yon der Ahe,
for it is such in the true meaning of the
word, will no doubt create a big sensa
tion. He was decoyed to the St. Nicholas
Hotel by means of strategy, where he
was hustled into a carriage, after being
shown the bail piece carried by Detective
Nichols Bendel. The carriage was driven
around aimlessly until it was fime to
board a train for the East. Then he was
shoved into it and is now on his way to
Pittsburg, where he will either have to
make good the judgment of $2500 rendered
against him in the Baldwin case or re
main in jail until such time as William
A. Nlmlck, who was on his bond when
the first arrest on the charge preferred
by Pitcher Baldwin was made, is satis
fied.
The kidnaping party has been heard
from, and is well on Its way to Pittsburg.

WILKESBARRE, PA., Feb. 7.âHun
dreds of persons anxious to hear what
action Judge Woodward would take in
reference to the sensational outbreak
on Saturday between Attorneys Gar
man and Lenahan, opposing counsel in
the Lattimer shooting case, thronged
the courtroom to-day.
Judge Woodward spoke of the inci
dent of Saturday, saying that after he
had left the bench, and before the court
adjourned, an altercation had arisen
between two lawyers engaged in the
trial which the court did not fully hear
nor realize until he had read of it in
the newspapers.
"Had we heard," said the Judge,
"what was we should have dealt
with the lawyers in a nummary man
ner, as the affair so deserved, and if
there is a repetition of it we shall pun
ish the guilty parties for contempt of
court."
Then came a severe denunciation of
the sensational action of certain news
papers in endeavoring, as the Judge
said, to prevent justice by an exag
geration of the facts and incidents of
the trial. He would, he said, not men
tion any names at present, "but if the
astounding falsehoods and misrepre
sentations continue the representatives
of the paper will find the door of this
court closed to them."
The first witness to-day was Silas
Jones, Justice of the Peace of West
Hazleton. He stated that he had seen
the meeting of the deputies and strik
ers at West Hazleton, and had followed
them into Lattimer. He saw Sheriff
Martin advance toward them with a
paper in his hand. Some of them sur
rounded him and an altercation oc
curred, but the witness could not see
exactly how the altercation took place,
or how it terminated. He heard a cou

pie of shots, and then a volley, and saw
several men fall. Two who fell near
him were dead. He was asked what the
spectators said after the shooting, but
the defense objected.
After listening to all the arguments
the court sustained the objection, thus
shutting out the evidence. This is re
garded as an important point gained
for the defense.
Counsel for the defense asked the
witness if he was not frightened when
he saw the Sheriff surrounded by the
strikers, and he replied that he was,
and that owing to this fact he could
not tell clearly just what happened at
the moment.
John Yeager, a Slav, who required an
interpreter, said he had seen the depu
ties on their way to Lattimer on the
day of the shoe-ting. All were armed
with rifles, but he could not see
whether the Sheriff had any weapons.
Just before the noon adjournment
the court accepted bail for all he ac
cused deputies and the Sheriff in the
amount of $6000 each, making $420,000
in all. Bail was furnished by the Phil
adelphia Surety Company.
When court met again in the after
noon George Yeager resumed his testi
mony. He joined the strikers and
marched with them to Lattimer. He
described the meeting with the Sheriff,
and said the Sheriff drew his revolver
and pointed it at the strikers. He
grabbed one of them and pulled him
out from among the others, ail the
time holding the pistol at his breast.
Then some one shouted to shoot and
the deputies fired.
"After the first few shots," said the
witness, "there was a volley and then
a number of single shots, and eleven
men were killed in five minutes and
lots wounded."
Upon cross-examination the witness
stated that he could point out any
deputy who was present at the shoot
ing, and the defendant immediately
called before the witness John Hamp
ton, chief of the coal and oil police.
Yeager was asked if he had seen
Hampton with the deputies.
"Yes," he exclaimed, "he was in the
line, and was holding his rifle this
way," and he illustrated the position.
The defense will prove that Hamp
ton was not on the scene at all, but
was in Hazleton at the time.
Thomas Hall, clerk of the Valley Ho
tel in Hazleton at the time, testified to
a conversation he had heard on the
Sunday following the shooting from
the Ups of Deputy John Turner. Tur
ner was in the hotel, and he said,
speaking of the shooting:
"We all marched out to Lattimer, and
as the strikers came up I heard a shot.
It seemed to come from the ranks of
the strikers, and then we opened up.
I shot nine of them and killed five."
The next witness was Christopher
Bechen, a miner of Cranberry. Bechen
said he was at West Hazleton when
the strikers arrived, and that he talked
with Bernheiser, one of the deputies,
who wanted him to join the deputies.
Bernheiser said: "Every one of those
d d strikers ought to be shot."
A few days before the shooting the
witness, had a talk with a deputy
named Dodson, who said: "We ought
to get so much a head for shooting
down such strikers. I would do it for
a cent a head to make money at it."
FAY WAS NOT LYNCHED.
Skaguay Murderer Saved by the
Action of His Friends.
VICTORIA, B. C. Feb. 7.â Ed Fay,
the murderer of Rowan and McGrath at
Skaguay, was not hanged. His friends,
headed by "Soapy" Smith, a gambler,
organized and threatened to use their
revolvers if Fay was hanged. Fay was,
therefore, sent to Sitka. The steamer
Tees, which brought this news, arrived
last night, as did also the Willapa.
The report that Mrs. Rowan, wife of
one of the murdered men, had died
proves untrue. The news of the shoot
ing has thus far been kept from her.

SAN JUAN DEL, SUR. Nicaragua,
Feb. 7. â Conservative refugees, who
have been threatening an attack on the
Government since their failure last
September, rushed through the village
yesterday afternoon without the slight
est warning and surprised the bar'
racks. There was one fatality on each
side. The Rivas authorities were una
ware of the refugees' entry into Nlca
raguan territory until 6 o'clock. A de
tachment of about 200 men was started
at 7 o'clock with the hope of intercept
ing an attack in San Juan or retaking
the place. They advanced to the top of
the divide, about a league from here,
whe^e they encamped with the inten
tion of attacking at daylight, scouts
having reported that the revolutionists'
outposts were at the foot of the hill.
There were slight skirmishes yester
day, but no serious attack was made.
The revolutionists, about 500 strong,
are entrenched in a good position out
side of town.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.â lt appears
from af more careful scrutiny of the
news cabled to the State Department
from San Jose, Costa Rica, last Satur
day that a revolution is in progress in
Nicaragua and not in Costa Rica, as
was at first understood. The advice
came from United States Minister Mer
ry, who is now at his post in Costa
Rica, where he has been received with
out difficulty, notwithstanding his re
jection i>y Nicaragua. The navy Is un
usually well prepared to protect Ameri
can interests in Nicaragua, as well as
the canal commission, having a war
ship on each coast of the country or
near by. The gunboat Newport ar
rived at Port Limon yesterday, where
she can be readily communicated with
by cable, and the gunboat Marietta
touched at Llbertad, Salvador, to-day,
on her way north, which will bring her
on the Nicaraguan coast in the course
of a day or two.

the Money Question and Im
proved Conditions.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 7.
The House passed the Military Acad
emy bill to-day with only one import
ant amendment. The debate on the
measure was desultory and touched a
variety of political topics. As passed
the bill carried $453,540, being $260,032
less than the amount carried by the
current law. The bill to limit the pe
riod for the refunding of the certifi
cates of deposits of 1579 to December
SI, 1899, was passed. To-morrow the
House will take up the Aldrich-Plow- ;
man contested election case.
The attendance in the House to-day :
was small. A bill was passed to ratify j
the act of the Territorial Legislature of :
Arizona authorizing the erection of a
capltol building.
without further preliminary the House
went Into committee of the whole and :
took up the consideration of the Military
Academy appropriation bill. The bill car-i
ried $453,540. being $186,769 less than the >
estimatos, and $260,032 less than is carried
In the current law. It was arranged that |
general debate should run for two hours, j
Most of that time was consumed in the
discussion of extraneous matters.
Samuel Smith (R.) of Michigan submit- '
ted some remarks relative to the need:)
of the postal service.
Clark (R.) of lowa spoke on the Loud j
bill Increasing the rates on second-class
mail matter, and Greene (Pop.), of Ne
braska made some observations on the :
much-mooted subject of returning pros- i
perity. He read a dispatch from â¢Wheel
ing. VT. Va., giving an account of the al
leged tearing down of McKinley's picture
by worklngmen. "Gentlemen may cry
'Prosperity! Prosperity!' " said he, "but
there is no prosperity."
"And others may howl 'Calamity! Ca- :
lamity," c-ried Perkins, amid shouts of
laughter from the Republicans.
Olmstead (.R.) of Pennsylvania pro- j
duced clippings from newspapers in all i
parts of the country showing a great re- i
vival of business and trade.
Olmstead said that the continued agita- ,
tion of the silver question was the only '
thing that retarded the full measure of ,
prosperity that would naturally flow :
from the Dingley law. The threat con
tained in the Teller resolution had driven ,
$40,000,000 to investment in foreign securi
ties.
' "Do we want a cowardly money that
runs away?" asked Bland (D.) of Mis- :
Bourl.
"Money Is always timid." replied Olm
stead. "It goes to places where it Is saf
est and the security is best."
"You don't hear of sliver running
away," reiterated Bland.
"No," interposed Landis (R.)of Indiana,
"you don't hear of silver running away
from Mexico."
"Mexico 1s prosperous." shouted a
voice on the Democratic side.
Landisâ You don't hear of silver money
running away trbm China.
Ogden (D.) of Louisianaâ Are you a
Chinaman or an American?
Miers (D.) of Indiana and De Armond
(D.) of Missouri both denounced the ac
tion of the House on the Teller bond
resolution. The whole purpose of the Re
publican party In the defeat of that reso
lution, De Armond declared, was to com
mit the country irretrievably to the gold
standard. It had at last thrown oft all
Bubterfuges and shams and now had the
shameless effrontery to boldly proclaim
the robbery which it always secretly con
nived at but never before had the hardi
hood to avow.
Low (R.) of New York said it was no
etrong marvel that the Democrats were
howling down the evidences of prosperity
â which confronted them on all sides. When
a Democrat was brought face to face
with prosperity he shook like an aspen
leaf.
Perkins (R.) of lowa said that in the
matter of wheat and wool the high prices
prevailing had been charged to blind
chance. It was said that the Republican
party was the party of good luck. If â 
that were true, it follows that there must
be a party of bad luck. For himself he
preferred to affiliate himself with the i
party which was identified, present and ;
future, with the prosperity and happinesa
of the country. After some further re
marks by Williams (D.) of Mississippi
and Games CD.) of Tennessee the general
debate closed and the bill was read for
amendment under the five-minute rule.
"With only one unimportant amendment
the committee rose and the bill was
passed.
Dlngley asked unanimous consent for
the consideration of a bill unanimously
reported by the Committee on Ways and
Means, limiting the time in which the
outstanding refunding certificates of de
posit of 1579 can be refunded into bonds
of 1907 to December 31, 1800. About $30 -
000,000 of these certificates were issued In
furtherance of ' the redemption act. and
but $42,000 of them remain now outstand
ing. There was no objection and the bill
was paasfd.
The Senate amendments to the legisla
tive, executive and judicial appropriation
bill were disagreed to and the bill sent
to conference.
At 3:45 p. m. the House adjourned.
SESSION OF THE SENATE.
An Attempt to Secure Aid for Sur-
viving Members of Admiral
Worden's Family.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.-A communica
tion was received at to-day"s session by
the Senate from the Secretary of War,
representing the urgent necessity for im- â 
mediate action to control the disorderly ;
elements that are assembled In A' ska.
Chandler of New Hampshire ;hen pre- :
â ented a memorial which callfcd the at
tention of the Senate to one of the most
thrilling events of the Civil War. The
memorial was prepared in 1874 by the late j
Admiral Wordcn, who, as a lieutenant in I
the navy, commanded the Monitor in the ;
historic fight in Hampton Roads between |
that vessel and the Merrimae. Chandler '
Â«aid that Admiral Worden conceived the !
idea that it would be proper for the Gov
einment of the United States to pay the
officers and crew of the Monitor the sum '
of $2"0 each in the nature of prize money, !
but, after having prepared the memorial, ;
ronciuded not to present it to Congress, *
lest his motives might be misconstrued.
Chandler said lie now took occasion to .
present thf memorial himself, and he â¢
poped Congress would see its way clear, :
in view of the wonderful victory achieved
Djr Lieutenant Worden, to do something
substantial for the surviving members of
his family, who are not in good financial j
circumstances. He asked that the me- j
moriai lie referred to the Naval Affairs
Committee.

COUNCIL MADE
TO DO ITS DUTY
San Jose's New Charter
Club Scores a
Victory.
City Lawmakers Forced to Pass
the Readjustment Or
dinance.
Lashed on by the Court They Balk
Until the Last Minute and
Then Obey.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, Feb. ".âThe New Charter
Club to-day scored its first victory over
the City Council. It was won in Judge
Kittredge's court, where Mayor Koch
and Councllmen Nolting, Dlttus and
Krleg were In attendance to show cause
why they should not obey the writ of
mandate issued by Judge Kittredge yes
terday to compel them to pass an ordi
nance looking to the readjustment of the
collection of city taxes.
President Smith of the New Charter
Club yesterday morning procured a writ
of mandate ordering the Council to meet
and pass the ordinance now before thai
body, providing for a readjustment of thu
city government as regards the assess
ment of city property and the cqllection
of city taxes by city officials, and mak
ing the work a portion of the duties of
the County Assessor and Tax Collector.
By this ordinance the taxpayers of the
city would be saved several thousand
dollars yearly, but on the other hand a
number of clerks who stand in with the
gang would lose several months' work
each yearâ and here is where the opposi
tion to its passage arose.
As soon as Judge Kittredge issued the
writ yesterday Mayor Koch and Council
men ' Nolting, Kneg and Dittus were
served with copies, which commanded
them to meet and pass the ordinance be
fore 1 o'clock to-day or to appear before
Judge Kittredge at 2 o'clock this after
noon and show cause why they should
not. Mayor Koch at once called a meetr
ing of the Council for 10 o'clock thl3
morning. The members were notified,
but at that hour only Councilmen Nolt
ing and Dittus and Mayor Koch were
present. This was not a quorum, and
after waiting some time for the recreant
members to appear an adjournment was
taken until 2 o'clock this afternoon.
At 2 o'clock the Mayor and Councilmen,
with the exception of Fay, who is in San
Francisco, appeared before Judge Kitt
redge. They were represented by Attor
ney F. E. Spencer, and S. E. Smith was
represented by Attorney W. B. Hardy.
The matter was argued at length, Attor
ney Spencer contending that the provi
sion of the charter providing for the re
adjustment of city affairs was unconsti
tutional. Judge Kittredge failed to take
this view and ordered that the writ
stand, and informed the council that it
must pass the ordinance. Attorney Spen
cer also advised the Councilmen to pro
ceed with the matter.
The placing of the assessment of prop
erty and the collection of the taxes in
the hands of county officials will do away
with clerks in the offices of the City
Treasurer and City Clerk. A number of
other clerks who have had work each
summer in City Clerk Cook's office will
not be needed. The work of the County
Assessor and Tax Collector will not be
materially increased. It will be neces
sary to employ a couple of clerks in the
County Auditor's office for a few months
in figuring up the taxes, and another man
may be necessary in the Tax Collector's
office. It will, anyhow, save the tax
payers of the city several thousand dol
lars yearly.
After copies of the writ had been
served upon the Mayor and Council
men the officials started for the City
Hall for the purpose of passing the
ordinance. On arrival it was found
that Councilman Krieg was not pres
ent, but after some time he was
brought in by an officer.
The meeting was then called to or
der and proved a warm one. Krelg re
fused to sign the report of the ordi
nance committee, which embodied the
ordinance ever which the trouble
arose. An attempt was then made to
pass the ordinance, but Krieg voted
no, and it was defeated. It looked as
though the ordinance would not be
passed, and that the Mayor and Com
mon Council would be jailed for con
tempt of court.
Reconsideration of the matter went
over until later in the meeting, and
Councilman Nolting aired his opinions.
He seemed very "sore," and his spite
found vent on ex-City Attorney Hardy,
counsel for President Smith of the
New Charter Club. Nolting said:
During the past days we have been
kept busy receiving court summons that
were Instigated by men who are anxious
to serve in the near future as Mayor,
City Attorney, Councllmen and in other
capacities. I have in mind now a matter
that should also be a subject for an in
junction proceeding. I refer to the Jul
ian-street sewer. Some time ago, after
much hesitation, I voted for a $3200 claim
for that work. I believed at the time
the claim should not have been allowed
for more than $2000, but after assurances
by Colonel Hardy and others that the
whole amount of $3200 was due for ser
vices rendered to the city In that sewer,
I consented to give my vote for the
claim. Within the past fe-v days I have
learned that when $160fl of the claim was
paid, Mr. Hardy demanded $800 from
Mabury & Farrell as his share of it. I
do not blame the attorney for getting
$SOO or any other amount that was obtain
able, by him, but I do object to having
the city pay an $800 attorney fee for that
contractor.
I voted for the $3200 claim under the
assurance and representation that ser
vices to that amount had been rendered
to the city, but It now seems the city
got only about $2400 of value received,
and the remaining $800 was used by the
contractor In feeing his attorney. I now
move that all action in regard to that
claim be rescinded.
"I know there Is something rotten In
connection with the Mabury and Far
rell claim," said Nolting, "and I shall
inform Treasurer Ewing immediately
that if he pays out a dollar on that
claim he will do so at the risk of mak
ing good the amount out of his own
pocket."
City Attorney "Welch addressed the
Council on the seriousness of Its ac
tion in refusintr vi pu^s the ordinance
in relation to the levying of assessment
and collection of city taxes. He said
the refusal of the Council to act
would make the members liable to con
tempt of court and subject to impris
onment. The vote on the ordinance
was then reconsidered and the ordi
nance passed unanimously.
After adjournment the ordinance
was signed by the Mayor and Council
rnen and filed at once with the City
Clerk and County Auditor.

custom the Imperieuse displayed no

over the historic Custom House as soon
as she was sighted. This omission was
especially fell by the townspeople, for

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAT, FEBRUARY 8, 1898.
OLD SAN PEDRO
WAS A RINGER
Fraud Detected in the
Coursing at Los
Angeles.
Imp. Chit Chat Entered and
Raced Under Another
Name.
Dr. Van Hummell and His Dogs Ruled
Off the Agricultural Park
.Grounds.
Bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 7.â The first
clear case of the running In of a ringer
In the coursing matches at Agricul
tural Park occurred Sunday. Several
weeks ago a rather pompous individ
ual came to the city with a string of
ten good greyhounds. The gentleman
introduced himself as Dr. Van Hura
mell of Indianapolis, the "father of
coursing," and said that he was on his
way to San Francisco to take part In
the coursing events at Ingleside and
the new park to be established near
that place, but would stop over for
a week or two to get his dogs into con
dition and would race them here. The
doctor entered several of his dags in
the matches last week and they failed
to make a good showing.
Among the entries for yesterday's
courses was also one by Dr. R. S.
"Withers, the veterinary surgeon, who
entered a brindle dog under the name
of San Pedro. Dr. Withers claims to
be the owner of the dog, and, as the
doctor is a reputable man, the entry
was taken without question. When
the dog passed through the gate yes
terday morning Bob Hackney's sus
picions were aroused. He thought that
San Pedro looked very much like Imp.
Chit Chat, but somewhat lighter, and
did not feel authorized to stop him.
Later Dr. Withers asked Colonel Black
to introduce him to Dr. Van Hummell,
and this had much to do with allaying
suspicion.
As the dng showed up pretty well
Dr. Van Hummell could not restrain
himself, and let drop several remarks
which led those who heard them to be
lieve that all was not as it should bo
and inquiries were instituted. This
morning Dr. Withers was called upon
and after some talk he finally con
fessed the whole thing, giving all the
inside facts, 'with the result that Dr.
Van Hummell's dogs will not be again
seen on the coursing field at Agricul
tural Park.
San Pedro was the famous Imp. Chit
Chat.
TWO CONSTABLES
SCENT DANGER
Professor Dudley Appears Be
fore the Santa Cruz
Grand Jury.
Officers Who Arrested Him Without
Cause Likely to Be
Punished.
i Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ, Feb. 7.â Professor "Wil
liam Russell Dudley of Stanford Univer
sity was arrested at Watsonville on the
6th of last month by Acting Constable
Pratt of Soquel and Constable Kittredge
of Watsonville while he was on a botan
izing trip down the coast. He was brought
to Soquel and held to answer to the
charge of passing counterfeit money and
was brought to Santa Cruz handcuffed.
In charge of a constable, and placed in
the County Jail over night. The case of
mistaken identity was soon proved and
the professor was released.
Professor Dudley and his attorney,
Professor Brun, arrived yesterday from
Stanford University and this morning
â were In consultation with the officers.
The object of this visit was soon sur
mised, as the Grand Jury was in session
at the courthouse, having resumed Its
session this mornUig. It is known that
' Professor Dudley was before this body,
but as the proceedings are all secret the
exact occurrences are not known. With
out a doubt his visit is in regard to the
manner he was treated. The charge, If
any, which is being made against Pratt
will probably be misdemeanor for arrest
ing a man without having a legal ap
pointment. Pratt was subpenacd to-day
to appear before the Grand Jury to-mor
row. Pratt claims Constable Ord ap
pointed him a Deputy Constable, but he
now sees that the appointment could not
have, been legal, as it had never been
filed before the proper authorities. Pie
claims that ho did not make the actual
arrest, as that was done by Constabk
Kittredge of Watsonville. He has no fear
of the result of the investigation by the
Grand Jury. Constable George M. Ord
under whom Pratt claims to have re
ceived his appointment, claims that Pratt
was in no way connected with his office
and was not authorized to make this or
I any other arrest.

ON A CHARGE
OF FALSEHOOD
Pay Director Billings to
Be Tried by a Court-
Martial.
Accused of Telling an Untruth
to the Secretary of the
Navy.
All the Trouble Grows Out of the
Incorporation of a Compressed
Food Company.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 7.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Pay Di
rector L. G. Billings, general inspector
of the pay corps of the Navy Depart
ment, will be tried by court-martial,
commencing on Wednesday, on a
charge of falsehood. Pay Director Bil
lings has always been considered one
of the sterling paymasters of the serv
ice, and his friends insist that he will
be able to clear himself. His trouble
commenced when he Invented and pat
ented an emergency ration. The Amer
ican Compressed Food Company was
formed and the secretary of the com
pany placed before him some papers to
sign. Mr. Billings did as requested
without, he asserts, reading the papers.
He was recently asked by Secretary
Long if he was an incorporator of the
American Compressed Food Company,
and said he was not and had no con
nection with it. The department then
obtained a copy of the incorporation
papers, which bore the name of L. G.
Billings as an incorporator. The de
partment also obtained information, I
am told, that Mr. Billings was also a
shareholder. When it was again
brought to the attention of the pay di
rector he reiterated that he was not an
incorporator of the company. His
friends say they named him as an in
corporator and that he did not know of
it until the matter was brought to his
notice. Mr. Billings requested that Sec
retary Long appoint a court-martial to*
make a thorough investigation and the
court -was appointed to-day.
Mr. Billings is No, 11 on the list of
pay directors and has the relative rank
of captain. His court consists of Com
modore F. V. McNair, president: Com
modore H. L. Howison. commandant of
Boston Navy-yard; Commodore G. C.
Remy, commandant of the Portsmouth
Navy-yard; Commodore X. H. Fnrque
har, commandant of thf Norfolk Navy
yard; Captain Silas Casey, command
ant of the Leaguo Island Navy-yard;
Pay Director C. 11. Eldredsre. Pay Di
rector Edward May and Pay Director
T. T. CaswelL Lieutenant C. H.
Laucheimer on duty as principal as
sistant to Captain P. C, Lemly. Judge
advocate-general, will be the judge ad
vosate of the court.

STEAMSHIP NOYO
PUTS INTO PORT
Delayed Because She Had
Taken a Sailing Craft
in Tow.
Reports That the Position of the
Wrecked Corona Has Become
More Dangerous.
Special DlFi>atch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, Feb. 7.-A special
from Nanalmo states that the steamer
Noyo arrived there yesterday afternoon
from SkaÃxiay. She had been delayed
by towing the schooner Louis J. Kennedy,
which had been engaged to take a party
of sixteen gold hunters bound for the
Klondike.
The Noyo had twenty-five disgusted
passengers aboard, tired of the country
after their first experience, and severely
denouncing the Klondike rush. The
treasure on board was $10,000. One of the
passengers sa^a that 2<X> men could do all
the work offered at Skaguay, and that
there were at least SUO men there who had
nothing to do but drink and gamble.
When the Noyo passed, the position of
the Corona was more critical than here
tofore reported. The stern was sub
merged, while the bow was completely
out of the water, bringing the vessel to
such a position that it was feared she
would slip off the rock and sink In deep
water. The Noyo had no communication
with the wrecked passengers on Lewis
Island.
WAS JEALOUS OF
HER STEPDAUGHTER
Why Mrs. Place Attempted to
Commit Murder and
Suicide.
Assailed Her Husband and His Child
With an Ax, and Turned on
the Gas.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 7.â lnsane Jealousy
prompted the wife of William W. Place,
an insurance adjuster of Brooklyn,, to kill
her 17-year-old stepdaughter to-night and
almost to take her own life and that of
her husband. Mr. Place is 47 years old,
and his family consisted of his wife, Mar
tha, 37 years old, and a daughter by his
first wife, Ida M. Place, aged 17. Mr.
Place returned home from business about
6 o'clock to-night, and upon opening the
front door was confronted by his wife.
The woman appeared to be in a frenzied
condition and was armed with a small
ax.
Before Mr. Place could recover from
his astonishment, Mrs. Place dealt faim
a blow with the weapon on the forehead
and another which inflicted a terrible
gash in his left cheek. Mrs. Place then
ned to her room, locked the door and
turned on two Jets of gas. Place secured
help and the door was broken open. Mrs.
.PJace was found imconseiouÃ.
The door of a back room on the s^mc
floor was found to be locked, and was
broken open. Here, on the bed, was
found the daughter, Ida. Her head had
been split open with the ax and there
was also an ugly wound on the mouth.
The g'lrl had been dead about three hours.
Place, although seriously injured, will
probably survive. Mrs. Place is already
out of danger. The father's preference
for his daughter's society is said to have
been the cause of frequent quarrels be
tween husband and wife.

NEW YORK, Feb. 7.â James R. Keen*

OF DISTRESS
Pilot Boats Called in a
Hurry by the Sharp
shooter.
The Captains Mad When It
Turned Out to Be Only a
Stowaway.
Charles S. Woods of Winters Search
ing the Front for His Run
away Wife.
The American barkentlne Sharp
shooter grave the pilot boats America
and Lady Mine a short race outside
last Sunday. She was towed to sea
early in the morning and in the after
noon Captain "Little" Jordan of the
American and Captain "Big" Jordan on
the Lady Mine both sighted the
barkentine with her ensign flying at
half-mast. Both the pilots thought
that some serious accident had hap
pened so in spite of the strong wind
and heavy st-a they ran down to the
vessel. The America was the first to
reach her and as she came up under
the barkentine's counter a big wave
broke on board which almost sub
merged the smart little schooner. Cap
tain Jordan was equal to the occasion,
however, and soon had the Sharp-
Ehooter within hailing distance. The
captain of the barkentine told the pilot
that he had a stowaway on board
whom he was unwilling to take to
Honolulu.
According to the laws of Hawaii cap
tains of vessels are liable for any des
titute person they may bring to the
islands. As the stowaway had not a
cent nor even a change of clothing the
captain could not listen to his appeal
to be allowed to work his way down
rip he knew if the man succeeded in
landing the ship would be libeled
and if he didn't land he would have to
bring him back to San Francisco. Even
then the immigration officer here might
refuse to land the man because he is
not a United States citizen so that the
Sharpshooter might have been saddled
with him for an indefinite period.
A boat was lowered and the stow
away was taken on board the America,
afti.'r which both the pilot boats went
back t.i their stations. A little while
later Captain Harry Marshall of the
tugboat Active came along and Cap
tain Jordan signaled him. The situa
tion was explained to Captain Mar
shall and the stowaway was trans
ferred to the tug. Later he was land
. i at Folsom-street wharf. To the
crew of the Active he said that his
name was Harry Edwards and that
not being in good health he wanted to
reach his friends in Honolulu. He gave
his ring, $3 (all the money he had) and
his best suit of clothes to one of the
sailors to stow him away. The sailor
performed his part of the contract, but
in an unfortunate moment he put his
head out of his place of concealment to
pet a last look at California and the
first mate saw him. It was then that
the signal was flown from the Sharp
shoott-r. Edwards was fairly well
dressed, but did not have the appear
ance of ever having done any hard
work. He felt very sore over the re
fusal of the captain of the barkentine
to allow him to work his way down.
He is now stranded in San Francisco
with only one suit of clothes and 15
cents in his pocket.
Charles S. Woods was round the wa
ter front all day yesterday looking for
his wife, Gertrude, who has deserted
him. Woods is a pruner by profession
and earns big wages in the orchards
and vineyards in Yolo County. Lately,
however, he has been drinking consid
erably, and his wife of two summers,
getting tired of it, said she was going
to leave him. She got together all the
money that was in the house, ; acked
all her clothes and left for San Fran
cisco last Thursday. The next day
Woods began to realize his loss, and,
not having any money and being un
able to borrow any, he walked all the
way to San Francisco. On his arrival
here ho searched the town all over and
th~n enlisted the services of Sergeant
Turn Muhoney of the harbor police.
The two of them tried diligently to find
the missing woman but failed, so last i
night Woods borrowed twenty-five
cents to pay his way to Benicia and
s;u<l hf was going to walk the rest of
the way back to Winters. Woods de- |
scribes his wife as a handsome bru- j
ncftte, a little above the medium size 'â 
and dressed in a brown suit and a I
brown hat. She is a country girl, never !
having been in San Francisco but once !
in her life, and then only for a couple |
of hours. If Woods does not hear from
her In the meantime he is going to put
his affairs in order at Winters and
come back to San Francisco to con
tinue the search.
The steamer City of Pueb'a had an
exceedingly rough trip of it from Puget

nearly twelve hours late in getting in.
Part of the railing was carried away
and some of the windows in the pilot

The pilot-boats America and Lady Mine were called to the barkentine Sharpshooter last Sunday in a hurry by a flag at half mast in the

ADOLPH SUTRO
INCOMPETENT
His Daughter Appointed
His Guardian by Judge
Belcher.
Is Now Afflicted With Senile
Dementia, for Which There
Is No Remedy.
Collapse of the Master Mind That
Planned the Great Comstock
Tunnel.
Adolph Sutro, the millionaire, philan
thropist and ex-Mayor, was adjudged
mentally incompetent by Judge Belcher
last Saturday. His daughter. Dr. Emma
L. Merritt, who has been attending her
.. father since he began to manifest signs
lof a failing Intellect, was appointed
> guardian of his person and estate, and
j she gave bonds In the sum of $100,000
as a guarantee that the duties Imposed
upon her would be faithfully per
formed.
It has been known for some time that
Mi. Sutro was nearing the end of a use-
ful business career; that his mind was
failing and that a guardian must be
appointed to attend to him and his vast
estate. In the hope, however, that
something would Intervene at an unex
pected time to render the proceedings
for the appointment for a guardian un
necessary his friends and relatives did
all in their power to prevent the world
from knowing his true condition.
Last September Mr. Sutro began to
grow worse, and finally his case was
pronounced by three eminent physi
cians, W. W. Kerr, William H. Mays
and W. A. Whltwell, to be senile de
mentia, for which there is no relief.
This precipitated matters and the ap
plication that he be declared incompe
tent and a guardian appointed was filed
with Judge Belcher.
Last Saturday the millionaire's four
children, accompanied by the physi
cians and Colonel Little, appeared in
Judge Belcher's chambers. All were ex
amined and the Judge signed the order
declaring Adolph Sutro mentally in
competent. Dr. Emma L. Merritt was
then appointed guardian, her bonds be
ing fixed by the court at $100,000. Her
brothers and sisters went sureties on
the bond and, this completed, the estate
was forever removed from the hands of
its owner.
Adolph Sutro was born in Germany
eighty-one years ago, of humble pa
rentage. When a young man he came to
America and to this city, where he
i opened a little tobacco store. He re
i mained here a short time and then
j went to Virginia City, Nev., and a
j short time after his arrival there he
1 evolved the scheme of running a tunnel
! from the base of Mount Davidson into
the Comstock lode that the water from
the lower level's of the mines might be
drained. After a long struggle, he
finally succeeded in getting the enter
prise under way, and In 1878 the tunnel
was completed, at a cost of over $5,
000.000. A year later Mr. Sutro resigned
his position as superintendent of the
tunnel and returned to this city.
He immediately invested in real es
tate, and to-day owns one-eighth of the
whole taxable area of the city. Al
though he pays assessments on but $1,
500,000, It is estimated by experts that
his estate is worth over $5,000,000. Ow
ing to his speculation, however, In the
enterprises known as the Sutro Rail
road and the Rutro Baths he was com
pelled to raise large sums of money,
and in consequence his estate is heavily
encumbered.
He ran for Mayor in 1894, and owing
to his popularity and reputation for in
tegrity he was-: elected by a large ma
jority. This was the beginning and
Ihe end of his public career, and now
hf> i? as a child, his mind shattered by
overwork, and he must be cared for
until the end of his days.

From the Local Talent.
Sketches at the Great Confectionery Contest at the
Miners' Fair.
Great was the Cake Walk at the Min
ing Fair last night, and now all the col
ored folks of San Francisco are sad,
for the judges decided that Oaklapd
was the winner by five small but effect
ive points.
Fully 10,000 people paid to see the con
test. The galleries and main floor of
the Pavilion were crowded almost to
suffocation. For nearly an hour be
fore the performance seats were at a
premium, and standing room was diff
cult to find.
San Francisco was represented by the
following three couples: Charles
O'Brien and wife, F. H. Worth and Car
rie Leslie and John Stewart and sister.
The Oakland contingent consisted of
Milt Johnson and Rosy Stewart, Major
Waters and Bell Brown and John Duke
and sister.
After a grand parade the couples
walked as teams, San Francisco start
ing off first and being followed by the
three couples from Oakland. Some ex
ceedingly funny and amusing walking
was done, and especially that by a di
minutive pair of walkers, who were
given an extra cake all to themselevs.
The razor element was eliminated from
the (ontest and no blood was shed, but
there were suggestive looks and hints
of a settlement of differences else
where. Side steps, back steps and any
old kind of step, with a pigeon-wing
cut and a double-kneed twist, were
b; ought into play by the smiling and
perspiring aspirants. The audience was
in a hish slate of amusement, and when
th- 1 famous and only Milt Johnson lrÂ»i
his beaming partner out for the lait
walk, and this dusky damsel caress
ingly laid her head upon his shoulder,
the crowd went wild, and gave vent to
their approval by loud and prolonged
applause.
The judges decided that on ability,
grace and style Oakland was entitled
to 270 out of a possible 300. while San
Francisco received 265 points. Johnson
and his partner were awarded the cake,
a large affair of icing and ornaments,
and when it was presented Johnson of
fered to walk any contestant for cake
walk honors that desired to meet him.
The Oakland contingent also won the
JSO wager that they had posted against
a similar amount put up by the San
Francisco walkers.
To-night the Klondike wedding takes

This afternoon there will bo a ladies'

Has Now to Answer a Charge of
Obtaining Goods by False
Pretenses.
Ira N. Tooke was booked at the City
Prison yesterday by Detectives Cody
and Silvey on a charge of obtaining
goods by false pretenses.
Tooke arrived in the city recently
from Denver with "Lucky" Baldwin
and registered at the Baldwin Hotel.
He represented himself as a mining en
gineer and promoter of bituminized
rock for pavements. He frequently vis
ited the Palace Hotel and got ac
quainted with the firm of Schumacher
& Co., jewelers, In the Palace Hotel
building. There he told them he was a
wealthy engineer and capitalist in Den
ver, and before he came here he had
presented his wife with $20,000 worth of
Jewels and his daughter with a dia
mond worth $3000.
He showed a ruby that he wore on his
finger which Schumacher examined and
found to be a valuable stone. He won
Schumacher's confidence, and on Jan
uary 27, when he admired a topaz and
with its rich Champagne Flavor is far
and away the best chewing tobacco on
the market.

diamond, which he said he would like
to show to his wife and daughter at the
Baldwin, with the view of purchasing
them, they were handed to him on his
promise to return them that afternoon,
if they were not approved.
Tooke did not return with the jewels,
and when Schumacher made inquiries
he ascertained that he had left tho
Baldwin the same day, and that neither
his wife nor his daughter had been
staying there. Schumacher notified the
police and Captain Bohen detailed Di
rectives Cody and Silvey on the case.
Sunday they found Tooke in a house on
Franklin street, and placed him under
arrest. He said he had got drunk and
the jewels had been stolen from him.
Chief Lees wrote to Denver for infor
mation about Tooke and received a re
ply that he was a fraud of the worst
description. He was an ex-railroad en
gineer and blossomed out as a religious
reformer. The money he procured in
this way he spent on drink and de
bauchery. He was arrested for a crim
inal assault upon a young girl, but he
pretended to be so penitent that he was
not punished. His wife is being sup
ported by charity, and altogether he
j was looked upon in Denver as a most
j depraved man.
TAILORS ARE PROSPERING.
The New Union Coining Boldly to
the Front.
A meeting of the new Tailors' Union,
which will be known as Local No. 2.
Journeymen Tailors of America, was
held in Union Hall last night. The new
organization, while not yet fairly started,
is progressing finely, and promises soon
to become one of the foremost trade or
ganizations of the city. As the employers
are, in the main, heart and soul with the
principles of the organization, no trouble
Is expected from that source when the
work of introducing the label is started,
and many of them have already expressed
their willingness to use the label as soon
as the organization of the new body is
far enough advanced to warrant them in
muking a light for its use. As the char
ter from the international body has not
yet arrived no delegates have been elect
ed to the Labor Council, but the tailors
will be fully represented in that body as
soon as they are entitled to the privilege.
The following officers have been elected
for the ensuing year: J. T. Ellsworth,
president; Thomas Lund, vice-president;
George Nesbit, secretary; George L.
Holmes, treasurer; Henry Steiglitz, ser
ge;int-at-arms. In the future the union
will meet on the first and third Mondays
at 102 O'Farrell street.

Robbing the Mails.
Arthur Wilson pleaded guilty In the
United States District Court yesterday
of attempting to rob the United States
mails in Sacramento. He will be sen-
Unced to-morrow. Wilson cut open a

CHALLENGED BY THE MORMONS.
CONGRESSMAN KING of Utah is a Mor
mon, and proud of it. On behalf of his faith
he has thrown down the gauntlet to the ortho
dox churches and thus won the approval of his own
and the chance of re-election.
There is no other church which so thoroughly
i lixes business, politics and religion as does the
.Mormon. While it has much good in its creed, and
much which according to generally accepted tenets
is bad. it cannot be denied that it is perfect in organ
ization. The head of the Mormon church is more
respected in Utah than the head of the National Gov
ernment. The hat of the land is of less weight than
the officially expressed wish of the man who holds
the place once held by Brigham Young. When the
church tells an adherent to do a certain thing he does
it. There is no thought of questioning the wisdom
of the decree. Yet it could be desired that the Mor
mon church, like other churches, might attend to
its business. It has no right to be a dictator in poli
tics. It has no warrant for obeying laws under pro
test, and teaching that its own laws are more to be
respected than those enacted for the whole people.
Congressman King must not overlook the fact that
he was elected for other purposes than to glorify the
church, albeit therein he is an ornament and a shin
ing light.
THE SCHOOL SCANDAL.
IF it be true, as charged, that certain members' of
the Board of Education have engaged in the busi
ness of selling places in the department, no pun
ishment prescribed by the law is sufficiently severe
for them. Hanging is too good for a man who will
accept the sacred trust of School Director and betray
it. Such a man, in order that he may pocket a few
filthy dollars, would corrupt the morals of a genera
tion of youth and sow the seeds of dishonesty where
the rank resultant growth may never be extermin
ated.
In advance of an investigation or a public trial,
perhaps an opinion cannot be properly expressed as
to the truth or falsity of the charges which have been
preferred against two School Directors in this city.
But it must be said that the allegations of the ac
cusers bear all the marks of circumstantiality, and
are in strict accord with the probabilities. In a gen
eral way the public will believe that a man who as
School Director will make places for all his relatives
in the department will also sell positions when he
gets a chance. Foisting one's ignorant and disquali
fied relations upon the schools is not any more cred
itable than selling the places they fill to qualified
persons. In both cases it is a boodle proposition,
and in each case the result is to degrade the service
and drag the schools through the political mire.
Probably a determined attempt will be made in the
Grand Jury to whitewash these accused School Di
rectors. This will be the case whether they are guilty
or not. But even if probable cause is found against
them by the Grand Jury the difficulty of proving
such charges in court nearly always enables the cul
prits to escape with everything except their reputa
tions. The great problem that confronts the people,
therefore, in connection with this affair, is not how
to get rid of dishonest School Directors, but how to
provide a remedy for their corruption. To convict
and to send to prison the entire present Board of
Education would not prevent a repetition of the of
fenses charged. In November next another board is
to be elected, which, under the present system, will
probably contain more boodlers anxious to gather
a profit out of their trust. Even if the people should
make a special effort to get honest Directors next
time, at some subsequent election the boodlers will
again appear on the scene.
Evidently corruption in the School Department
has its root in machine politics. So long as the men
chosen to conduct the schools are selected by politi
cal conventions from the ignorant and selfish mem
bers of the community, so long will they be dragged
in the mud and continue to be the football of corrupt
politicians. What should be done with the School
Department is to take it out of politics. This might
be done by conferring the appointment of three or
five Directors for long terms upon the Mayor and
paying them n moderate salary for their work. Ex
perience has proved that Boards of Education should
not be elected in this city. If the Freeholders now in
session do not adopt a provision which will take the
schools out of politics, they may anticipate the dis
graceful defeat of the instrument they are framing.
Somebody thoughtlessly accused this paper of get
ting after the corruption of school boards in other
cities and overlooking the corruption in its own.
Well, if there is any corruption it is overlooking near
home it is because local experts have been success
ful in concealing it.
If, as stated in the daily news, Uncle Sam holds the
key to the situation in the East, he would better hang
on to it. Somebody with less qualification as a cus
todian might secure it and monkey with the lock.
IS ANNEXATION REPUBLICAN IN
PRINCIPLE?
THERE is something more than the alliance
with Gorman to put Republicans to think
ing on the relation of annexation to the prin
ciples of their party. Under the Government which
was overthrown, for Dole's benefit, by the United
States in 1893, there were about 16,000 qualified voters
in Hawaii. They were by its constitution the makers
of the Government. They elected its legislative body
and its judiciary. We had recognized them in their
capacity as electors by entering into treaties ratified
by the Senate which they elected, and by diplomatic
relations with the Government which their votes in
stituted and maintained. Under the Government of
the oligarchy which we made possible, these electors
are disfranchised. Their places have been taken by
about 2500 men. a considerable number of them be
ing adventurers new to the islands who went there
since 1893, attracted by the opportunities for plun
der and piracy always to be found where government
is subject to revolutionary changes. Conniving with
this limited number of electors, and with a Govern
ment upon the form and functions of which even
they have not been permitted to vote, we propose by
annexation to force a people resistant and unwilling
into our system in spite of their protests. Members
of the Republican party are told that this is a party
measure and their allegiance binds them therefore
to its support.
Now no measure can be a party measure that is
not justified by party principles. Every political
party has certain fixed principles. These are its rea
sons for being. The Republican platform came into
existence on a platform of principles every one of
which is antagonized by Hawaiian annexation.
After the admission of California to the Union as
a free State, there was a struggle to maintain the
sectional balance in the Senate by dragging Kansas
in as a slave State. War broke out in that territory.
Federal power was on the side of the slaveholders,
but a majority of the people of Kansas were for a
free State. In this situation it became necessary to
suppress the expression of the majority and force the
State into the Union in defiance of the popular will.
This was attempted by the Lecompton constitution,
and then the Republican party, loosely organized in
1856, suddenly advanced to a first position as a de
fender of human rights.
No better statement of the issue was made than
that by James G. Blame in his speech in Farmington,
Me., in iB6O. After describing the issue made in
1856, he concentrated the entire contention in this
sentence:
"The contest goes on and has been deepened by
the atrocious effort to compel Kansas to enter the
Union under the fraudulent constitution made at
Lecompton against the will and wish of her people."
Has the old spirit died out? Remembering the
early principles of his party, what Republican can
reconcile with them the forcing of Hawaii into the
Union against the will and wish of her people?
When considered as a violation of national policy
and of party principles and with a train of evils fol-
lowing it, it is no overstatement of the case to de
clare that annexation is the most repulsive proposi
tion ever made to the people of this country.
THE CORRUPTION OF YOUTH
AMONG the offenses known to Athenian law
and punishable by death was that of corrupting
the morals of the young. Against no class of
offenders was the public sentiment of Athens more
resolute and determined. It was under that law
Socrates was put to death. Neither his splendid in
tellect, his personal virtues, nor the potent influence
of powerful friends could save the philosopher when
once his enemies had succeeded in convincing the
people that by his teachings and his example he was
''a corrupter of youth."
Under our law we have no such specific offense as
that of corrupting youth. There is no penalty
against it as such. Even when carried on by prac
tices which violate statutes and ordinances we allow
it a large toleration. It seems at times, so indifferent
is public opinion on the subject, as if the youth of the
city were regarded as of no value. A thousand cor
rupting influences are permitted to be spread about
the streets to entice the young, and so careless are
the public officials in respect to it that it requires
persistent and vehement urging to induce them to ar
iest an offender even when in his viciousness he has
openly defied the law.
A striking illustration of the extent to which the
corruption of youth is permitted in San Francisco by
practices in violation of law is to be seen in the mul
titude of downtown pool rooms where young men
and boys, and occasionally even young women, are
enticed to gamble away their earnings, and tempted
to steal in order to gamble more. A city ordinance
forbids the running of such places. To maintain one
is to violate the law even if none but grown men re
sorted to it. Nevertheless they are more than
tolerated by the community and its officers. The ne
farious trade is carried on without a pretense at con
cealment, with insolence as well as with infamy.
It is gratifying to note that the pastors of our
churches are not among those who regard the cor
ruption of youth in these pool rooms with toleration
or indifference. More than once the churches have
spoken in earnest warning and indignant protest
against the evil. At one time in cordial co-operation
with The Call they took up the issue with such force
and vigor that a public sentiment was aroused which
compelled the closing of the pool shops. . As soon as
the storm blew over, however, the trade began again
and proceeded until now it is conducted as openly
and notoriously as ever.
One more a concerted and combined effort must
be made to put an end to the evil. If there be any
defects in the law let it be remedied. If any lack of
zeal on the part of the police let that be seen to. The
wrong is one of the most pernicious which affects
our civil life. As was well said by the Rev. William
Kader on Sunday:
"It is time that the ministers of the gospel should
rise up and assist the authorities in their fight for
purity and right. Women are forced to remove their
hats in theaters. Chinamen are forced to quit gam
bling and stray dogs are caught and put to death, but
the pool-room evil lives on. And murderers, drunk
ards, broken homes, blighted hopes, ruined young
men and women and poverty are its children."
Certain contemporaries seem to be not pleased
with the language employed in describing the cap
ture of the Dixon murderer. Their disapproval is not
unnatural, and yet the burden of their displeasure is
not grievous to be borne. We scan their columns
vainly for a description of the affair in language
either good, bad or indifferent. Perhaps this fact is
the basis of their sorrow.
Evidently the vigilantes of the far north have not
been educated up to the '49 standard. The report
that they have permitted a murderer to be rescued by
"Soapy" Smith is a surprise. Vigilantes really keyed
to the proper pitch would have hailed the interfer
ence as a glorious opportunity to hang Soapy.
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBHITARY 8, 1898.
THROUGHOUT the East in nearly all the
States where the result of coming Congres
sional elections is regarded as at all doubtful,
the Republicans are making ready for the campaign.
The preliminary work of organization has begun,
clubs are being formed, workers are being enrolled
in all counties, and steps taken to awaken the spirit
of the rank and file so that when the contest opens
the party will be ready to enter upon the fight at
once with vim and vigor.
This wisely directed action in the East should be
imitated in California. This State, though reasonably
safe for protection and sound money, is by no means
assured. Of our seven members of the present Con
gress only three are Republicans. When it is remem
bered that these Congressmen were elected in the
year of a Presidential campaign, when the full party
vote was brought out in almost every section of the
State, it will be seen the result does not incline to
overconfidence. To carry districts that were lost in
'96 and to elect at least five out of seven Congress
men this fall will require a long contest fought ar
duously from first to last.
The Democratic State Central Committee has al
ready held a meeting and started the ball rolling in
that party. In several Congressional districts one or
more Democratic campaign clubs have been formed
in the interest of popular candidate's. The silver men,
who in this issue are virtually all Democrats, though
some of them still style themselves Silver Republi
cans, have perfected a strong organization in the
southern part of the State and are actively at work
increasing the membership of their clubs and win
ning converts where they can. The enemy, in fact,
is alert along the whole line.
It is time for Republicans to be at least as active as
their opponents. It will be folly to wait for the cam
paign to open before we prepare for it. In every Con
gressional district and every county the work of or
ganizing clubs should begin forthwith. As the domin
ant party in the nation the Republicans will be expect
ed to take the initiative in the contest of the fall, and
for that reason they should begin now to arrange for
a State convention at a comparatively early date, so
that full time will be given afterward for carrying
vigorous war into the Democratic Congressional dis
tricts and electing Republicans there.
REPORTS from Hawaii are to the effect that a
syndicate in Japan is arranging to transport
about 5000 Japanese laborers to the Klondike
gold diggings this summer. Most of the laborers are
to be taken, it is said, from coolies now employed in
the Hawaiian Islands, but considerable numbers will,
of course, be carried direct from Japan itself; and it
is equally a matter of course that if the venture
prove profitable this year, there will be a large in
crease in the number sent to the diggings in the
following season.
As the coolies are to be taken to Canadian terri
tory, and as the syndicate, it is said, will arrange to
transport them without landing on American soil, the
matter is one with which we cannot directly interfere.
It is for the Canadian Government to decide whether
or no the proposed Asiatic invasion of the gold fields
will be permitted. If Canada consents to admit the
coolies to free competition with her white miners,
then the United States will have to watch the Alas
kan mining districts carefully, for once established
on the Klondike it will be easy for the Japanese to
spread over the whole Yukon Valley.
European aggression on the Chinese coast makes
much noise and attracts the attention of the whole
world. A thousand diplomatists and ten thousand
newspapers are kept busy in giving warnings of the
disasters likely to result from that invasion. Never
theless it b doubtful if the accomplishment of all
that Russia and Germany aim at on the coast of
China would so seriously affect civilization as would
a free admission of coolies to any part of the Pacific
Coast of America. The one invasion goes forward
with a beating of drums and the roar of guns of
mighty warships, while the other is as silent as the
spreading of a pestilence, but the pestilence is more
terrible than the battle.
The white man and the yellow man are face to
face in a struggle for supremacy on both sides of the
Pacific. While the white man of Europe aims at
political domination in Asia, the yellow man aims at
industrial domination on the American coast. The
Chinese and the Japanese are hereditary foes, but in
this issue they work together with a common will,
and the exclusion of the one will be futile if the other
be admitted.
The people of the United States have therefore a
great, though indirect, interest in the proposed in
troduction of coolie labor into the Klondike. The
home of no man is safe when pestilence has found
its way to the house of his next-door neighbor.
Coolie labor in the upper Yukon Valley will sooner
or later affect the white miner who develops the pla
cers in the United States territory lower down.
The issue is one of growing importance, because
the danger of an Asiatic industrial invasion of the
American coast increases with the years. Even un
dtr present conditions it has been found impossible
to wholly exclude Chinese from the country. It is
easy to see that the difficulty of guarding the white
labor of the Union will be much greater if Hawaii
is annexed, or if coolie labor gets a footing in Alaska.
The issue at present is in the hands of Canada, but
so far as the Government or the people of the United
States can do so, they should exert every influence to
prevent the consummation of the Japanese scheme.
The German Government invited us to make a dis
play of our fruit at the Hamburg Exposition, which
we did with such success that the German people de
manded large quantities of it. Now the Government
proposes to shut it out on the ground that it is un
sanitary. This is what we get for sending abroad such
fine fruit as to make the foreign growers feel sick at
the very sight of it.
According to the view taken by himself the latest
man to shoot his wife in Oakland is crazy. Possibly
he is an expert in the matter, and yet the probability
that he is prejudiced is too reasonable to be over
looked. In either case any interference with his
scheme of starving to death seems to be immaterial
and irrelevant.
Prisoners in the City Jail complain that they do
not get enough to eat, and if they do not, they have
good right to make a fuss about it. They cannot
reasonably expect to be fed on pie nor furnished with
napkins, but bread is inexpensive.
"What conflict with Spain actually means," is the
recent theme of a diplomat. He devoted to its con
sideration an unnecessary amount of words. Every
body knows it means that Spain would get a worse
lickirfg than it has ever experienced.
A Board of Education should have something
more to do than furnish citizens an opportunity to
be ashamed, and the Grand Jury a subject to investi
gate.
ATTENTION, REPUBLICANS.
A JAPANESE INVASION.
ON THE MERRY MADNESS OF GENTLEMEN
WHO MALTREAT THEIR WIVES.
The latest fad among husbands is not wholly original. It's a variation upon
the old doctrine that a good wife is all the better for a good beating. The rule is
nowadays, catch your wife, administer the beating or the murderâ according to the
degree of provocationâ and then promptly become insane.
John Lynn of Oakland casually called his wife's attention to something occur
ring out in the street. Then he carefully emptied the contents of his revolver into
her body.
"The Lord told me to do it," he said, and then subsided into wordless insanity.
L\ C. Vanier of 1113 Jones street in this city brutally beat his little wife, and when
she complained and made trouble for him, he beat her again for objecting to being
beaten. Vanier, too, followed the Scriptural injunction about casting all one's bur
dens upon the Lord. And then he became garrulously insane.
Steiva, an Italian over in Berkeley, is a follower of the prevailing mode. He had
long abused his wife. A week ago she complained to one of her neighbors that her
husband was trying to kill her. If that were true, he succeeded: for she died Mon
day last after struggling in convulsions for forty-eight hours.
I don't know whether Steiva will claim divine instigation, but as surely as he's
arrested and accused of the crime, he'll become insane, too.
These are only a few cases happening in so many days. But they are the Paris
fashions in murders, the advanvce sheets, so to speak, of the new spring designs.
It therefore behooves the up-to-date husband to study with care these artistic
productions, in order to work out appropriately the special kind of wife-beating or
wife-murdering that may suit the degree of his ferocity and of her offense.
As to this last, gentlemen will be glad to know that much patience is not re
quired on the part of the husband in the very latest marital code. A comparatively
small sin on the part of the wife is all that is necessary.
Husbands will readily understand that the new fad is merely a survival of the
beautiful old idea that wives are property, like ones furniture or one's horse. If.
my dear sir, your old arm chair, in which you have sat and smoked so comfortably
and so long, were to rise against you and decline longer to bear your weight, you
would be justly incensed, and if the concoction of wood and springs could feel, youâ
if you would follow the latest style in husbandsâ would certainry administer cor
poreal punishment. Just as you do when your horse tries your temper.
It is treason, then, against the most sacred rights of husbands for wives to
object to punishment. * For to question the justice of the husband's decree is to
question his supremacy. And where can you find bloodier treason than that?
It is high treason, punishable by death, for a wife to leave her husband. The
petty excuses she may proffer are irrelevant, immaterial and incompetent. If she
weary of non-support, if she tire of wrangling and bickering, if she be fastidious
about intemperance or any other of the manly vices, she presumes to be human.
And to be human and a wife at the same time is utterly out of the question, if the
new decree of fashion is to be followed.
I would recommend to diligent students, anxious to qualify in the new school of
nuptial ethics, the. case of Mr. John W. Lynn of Oakland. Mr. Vanier, unfortun
ately, has no diploma, Judge Low having sentenced him to six months in the House
of Correctionâ for the awkwardness with which he simulated insanity, presumably,
bignor Steiva is not yet a graduate, as the Coroner is only now investigating Sig
nora Steiva's death. But Mr. Lynn is an adept, having had unequaled opportunities
m the insane asylums at Utica and at Agnews for studying just this most im
portant branch of a husband's educationâ how to feign insanity.
Of course, it may be possible that Mr. Lynn's mastery of the subject is not that
of the amateur, but of the professional. But if his insanity be not feigned, it must
be real, wherefore it is more and more worthy of study.
I saw John Lynn in the jail at Oakland Saturday. Since his arrest he has
spoken no word. His lips move continually, and if one listens closely he can hear
disjointed sentences and numberless repetitions of phrases. "O Lord! O Lord!" he
whispers. I remembere a lunatic of my acquaintance who punctuated the babel of
sound that came up from the yard in which the Insane were kept, with this same
O Lord! O Lord!" spoken in as many different tones as there were moods to this
poorâ bona fideâ madman's despair. But to the everlasting repetition of Lynn's
words there is not the slightest tinge of expression. The physicians have tested his
nerves and his endurance. They have subjected him to what would cause a normal
man acute physical pain. But Lynn did not wince. Yet his jailer, who has watched
him closely, believes him to be sane, and he has the testimony of the two men who
never leave Lynn.
Lynn was lying upon a cot. He had been sleeping, or pretending to sleep all
morning. To rouse him, the jailer had to shout in his ear and literally drag him to
a sitting posture. This sort of collapse is the latest stage of Lynn's insanity He
appears to be an inert bundle of flesh, a little man, growing bald, with Â«canty
brown hair and a face that looks absurdly immature. His hands lie feebly in each
other. His head was bent and from his rapidly moving lips only the faintest whis
pers fell.
No spoken word seems to penetrate to this man's consciousness. He leans
heavily upon those who support him, falling back limply as soon as the support is
withdrawn. It was only when his wife's name was mentioned that one could tell
that he was not wholly unconscious of the presence of those who for a few minutes
filled the little cell.
"Your wife will live. Are you glad of it?"
"Yesâ yesâ yes-s-sâ " and a nodding of the sessile head.
â B^} nn>S 3aUerS Wl " tell you that !t wasn 't an answer, that from this man's
lips the hissing "yes-s-s" falls continually, and that the head bobs weakly just as
the body appears to be on the verge of disintegration.
But Lynn did answer, though perhaps not in words. When the words "your
wife were spoken there was a quick start of the arm the jailer held. Lynn hears
whichever of his other senses have left him. '
Once the jailer helped him to raise his heavy head which hung animal-like from
his short neck And then the weak face with its additional weaknesT of an utte?
lack of expression, with its wandering pale blue eyes, uncontrolled by the muscles
rolling gently as an infant's eyes do. seemed that of an idiot
But John Lynn, despite the excellent opportunities he has had for studying- the
vagaries of insanity cannot continue his role-if it be a role-for any length o 'time
The fearful strain which such an impersonation must necessitate wi 1 culminate in
making of the actor that which he pretends to be. If this would-be rrurd eâ¢ â¢l not
insane now he will become so if he continue to act the part so well Ind if he be al
ready unbalanced, his present weakness, bodily and mental his utter collaose will
be transformed into the violence and insane vigor of the raving man^c
In either case he is recommended to the patient study of husbands of the Lynn
MIRIAM MICHELSON.'

When the re
cent scandals
connected with
the Board of Su
pervisors and the
School Directors
were first pub
lished by The Call
A YELLOW
JOURNAL
SCOOP.
the effect of the news was to cause every
office In the City Hall to swarm with re
porters from the scooped papers the next
day. In the forlorn hope that something
might possibly be found that had been
overlooked by their hustling rival.
As District Attorney Barnes was away
on a trip in the southern part of the State
the supreme authority of the office was
represented by his assistant, Mr.
Hosmer. That gentleman had hardly
seated himself in his chair on the morn
ing spoken of when his office boy entered
with the announcement that waiting
without was a representative of a Mission
street publication devoted to fiction, who
said he must see the Assistant District
Attorney, as he had a very important
question to put to him which his paper
Intended publishing exclusively the next
day. The scribe was admitted, when the
following conversation ensued:
"Good morning, Mr. Hosmer. I have
come to tell you that a red-hot story has
been dug up In the Board of Supervis
ors."
"So I see," said Hosmer.
"What do you think they will do about
It?"
"I have not the slightest idea."
"Well, what I .called to particularly
ask was, What will you do if the matter
Is taken before the Grand Jury?"
"Why, I will do what I would in any
other caseâ perform my duty to the best
of my ability," replied the Assistant
District Attorney.
"Would you mind putting that on
paper?" again queried the visitor. "You
see, my editor told me this time he
wanted a story based on facts."
"I have not the slightest objection to
putting my name to such a statement,"
replied Mr. Hosmer. Whereupon he did
so, and the reporter hurried away with
the happy glow oÂ£ anticipated triumph
mantling his features and the light of an
exclusive story beaming from his shrewd
eyes.
Captain J. L. Coster, manager of the
SpreokelS refinery at Watsonville, is reg
istered at the Grand from that place.
T. G. Johnson, a well-known mining
man and vineyardist of San Jose, ia at
the Lick for a short stay in the city.
Colonel J. F. Gaynor, "W. F. Gaynor and
Eugene Hughes constitute a party of
well-known New York society men on a
visit to- the coast who axe at tha Palace..
Dr. W. H. Davis, formerly a weil
known physician of New York, l>nt now
heavily interested in Klondike business
Bchemes, is at the California. His pres
ent visit to the city is for the purpose of
securing, if possible, ships for the Alaska
Skaguay Gold Mining- and Transportation
Company, of which he is the organiser.
S. T. St. George Cany, a wealthy En
glishman on a sightseeing tour of the
United States, is one of yesterday's ar
rivals at the Palace.
There is in this
city a gentleman
whose many ac
complish m c ntn t s
make him one of
the leading men
of the place. He
stands high in
A STORY OF (
WOUNDED <
VANITY. <
i
professional and financial circles, while
his mentality and education cause him to
be a welcome guest wherever literary and
artistic people congregate. Yet, with all
these attributes, he has one weakness
which overshadows all else and which he
can never resist indulging. That weakness
is to be considered the model of all that
is proper and conventional, according to
the standard of our English cousins. If
the Prince of Wales had his hair cut to
day this gentleman would be found in the
barber's to-morrow; while the Informa
tion that his footwear did not conform to
the latest thing in Piccadilly would send
him walking on his hands until the terri
ble defect had been remedied.
Not long ago he had a carriage built
after a pattern of his own, which he de
clared was the only thing fit for a gentle
man to drive in, and which was being
used by the aristocracy abroad, to the ex
clusion of all other styles of turnout for
road work. When the vehicle was re
ceived it proved to be an affair that
looked like a cross between a roller-coast
er and a spider threshing-machine, paint
ed in colors vivid enough to cause any
passing dog a bad attack of nervous pros
tration.
The first day he used it he drove down to
the Palace Hotel to make a call, and left
the rig In charge of a friend while he
went inside. When he returned he found
two unmistakable English swells gazing
with rapt admiration on his new acqui
sition. Motionless, with gratified vanity
he stood on one side, not wishing to dis
turb them, when suddenly they turned
toward him, and one said: "Tell me me
good fellow, is that curious-looking thing
what you Westerners call a buckboard?"
The answer that was received left an
odor of sulphur in the air, while the team
departed at a gait that awoke the police
man quietly slumbering on the corner and
set him trying to remember if there was
not some sort of an ordinance against
fast driving.
E. S. Barnly, a mining man of Amador
is at the Palace. '
F. G. Baker, a capitalist of San Jose, is
a guest at the California.
James O'Neill, ex-Sheriff of Sacra
mento, is staying at the Grand.
Lieutenant J. H. Holcome, U. S. N., reg
istered at the Occidental last evening.
Thomas Flint, State Senator from San
Juan, was one of those to register at the
Palace yesterday.
W. S. Bethen, a well-known mining man
and politician of Denver, was one of last
night's arrivals at the California.
J. H. Rearman of Los Angeles and A. B.
Rodman of Woodland arrived in the city
last evening and went to the Occidental.
Jacob H. Neff, president of the State
Miners' Association, arrived in the city
on a business trip yesterday and went to
the Palace.
J. Friday, a large distiller of Pitts
burg, is at tbe Palace, with his wife..
They are making a tour of pleasure
through the State.
M. Reis, one of the largest theatrical
men in New York and probably the most
widely known man in the business in the
United States, is at the Baldwin on a
pleasure trip. Mr. P.eis, who has been
shown everything by the theatrical people
of the city and who has been largely en
tertained by the foremost Hebrew fami
lies 01 this place, will return to his home
in a day or two, carrying with him the
impression that the hospitality of Cali
fornia cannot be surpassed.
Albert W. Wishard, United States Dis
trict Attorney for Indiana, and L. P.
Newby, a Senator from the same State,
who have been at the Grand for the past
week, will leave on Thursday next for
their home by the way of Salt Lake
City and Denver. During their stay here
they have been largely entertained. On
Monday evening they were the gnests of
Mr. and Mrs. S. B. Carlton at the Hotel
Savoy and participated in a theater
party, which wound up the evening.
DISTRICT IRRIGATION
To the Editor of The Call: The great
est need of the State to-day is an intelli
gent development of her agricultural re
sources. These resources are practically
unlimited. The State can be made to fur
nish food and clothing in great abun
dance for the entire present population
of the United States, with enough to sell
to bring in all tho foreign luxuries the
wildest fancy could desire. I have Known
Chinamen to grow vegetables for sale to
farmers and realize $10u0 an acre. Theso
Chinamen used both irrigation and fer
tilizationâin other words, intelligence.
The State is nearly all arid or semi-arid,
and needs an intelligent use of water for
irrigation. We have no system of irriga
tion, and that fact is a libel on our in
telligence as a people.
when water was first diverted from
streams for this purpose there were those
who applied to the courts for the enforce
ment of what is known as riparian
rightsâ which means that the man at the
mouth of the river has a right to see all
the water go by him undiminished in
quantity and unpolluted in quality. This
conflict went on for years, and millions
of property rights were built on no bet
ter foundation than the sufferance of tho
man down the stream, or at best on
shotgun law. Men from one end of the
State to the other worried over this con
dition and met in conventions to devise
a way out of the difficulty, and finally
it was agreed to ask the Legislature to
create districts with the powers of a pub
lic corporation, so as to bring every
claimant of every kind into court and
have his damages assessed. From 1884
to ISS7 this phase of the problem was dis
cussed more ihan all other questions
combined. In 1885 a committee appointed
by a convention held in Fresno prepared
with great care a district bill that passed
the Assembly, but it was defeated by the
use of money in the Senate. Other con
ventions were held and an extra session
of the Legislature was called, but the
proper amount of intelligence or pa
triotism or honesty was lacking and it
came to naught. Public opinion, how
ever, had crystallized in favor of the dis
trict system, and at the session of 1887
there was no opposition to a district bill.
It was most unfortunate that the same
bill was not passed, but one was passed
which, though very crude, was correct in
principle. But it was not destined to go
into operation without the old enemy ap
pearing against it. The large land
owners, who wanted to own the water aa
well, had the ear of the banks and the
money power. The bonds were attacked
before issued and thoughtless men every
where were urged to oppose it. Tho
courts at first sustained the system, but
finally, on the most flimsy pretexts,
knocked it all over.
Now the first great, crying need of Cal
ifornia Is a system of irrigation. Wa
have great valleys of magnificent land,
with climate unexcelled in the world, and
these valleys are bordered around with
mountains adown whose sides flow
the life-giving water. An insignificant
amount of labor will put the land and
the water together, with a result more
astounding than any Arabian tale; and
all that is wanted is intelligence enough
to make a system. Is it in California?

OLYMPIC CLUB
Supervisors Create aPrac-
tical Monopoly of Box
ing Permits.
One Kntertainment Allowed
the Club for Each Month
in the Year.
Spring VÂ«lley Company Wants Its
Rates 10 Householders
Increased.
The Board of Supervisors created
â what is practically a monopoly In box
ing contests by action taken at yester
day's meeting. The Olympic Club is
the fortunate organization that receiv
ed the board's bounty, and unless the
members change their mind about al
lowing more than one contest a month
other organizations will be entirely
shut out.
The Olympic Club was granted a per
mit for a contest to take place between
March 21 and April 4, and the roport of
the committee was also in favor of al
lowing the organization to hold a con
test monthly for the balance of this
year. In response to a question from
Supervisor Clinton Chairman Delany
of the Health and Police Committee
stated that the Olympic Club was the
only organization in San Francisco of
financial and permanent standing that
is promoting contests and assigned this
as a reason for giving it the right of
way in the matter of fistic entertain
ments.
An ordinance was introduced and
passed to print requiring all house
holders- to have proper and legible
numbers placed over the doors of their
residences or over the gates of the
same in such manner that they can be
plainly seen from the street.
Supervisor Rottanzi presented an
ordinance that was referred to the
Health and Police Committee making
it unlawful for any person to represent
himself or to wear any badge or device
that will induce the public to believe
that he is a special officer unless regu
larly appointed by the Police Commis
sion of the city and county. The ordi
nance also makes it unlawful for any
person to demand consideration for the
guarding of personal property under
the guise that he is a special officer,
unless so appointed by the Commis
sioners.
On motion of Supervisor Britt the
question of awarding the lease of the
Sailors' Home was laid over for three
months.
Supervisor Clinton introduced an or
der which if carried out will restrict
eracing in San Francisco to forty
eight days in each year and will pre
vent such institutions as ladies' days
being given at any time. The ordinance
recites that while horseracing was for
merly conducted in the interests of the
breeding of blooded stock, it is now de
veloped into a men? pool-selling propo-
Bltion, resulting in the disruption of
homes, dissipation of savings, immor
ality and crirnf.
The order says that such Institutions
as ladies' days should and must be re
stricted and it provides that pool-sell
n races shall be confined to forty
eight days in the year; also that no
:i shall be allowed free on a race
track.
The extreme penalty for violation of
the ordinance Is made a fine of $500,
six months in the County Jail or both.
A resolution was passed to provide
for the care of the Insane in a building
to be leased for that purpose, the mon
ey necessary to be taken out of the
Wgei ssity fund. The matter of
providing more revenue for the city
out of boxing contests was arranged
for in i new license order. By this
sure the License Collector Is em
â 'l r<ml instructed to collect $400
for each boxing entertainment carried
<">n. and no license must be granted un
less under a permit from the board. It
Is provided, however, that the Super
visors may grant a gratuitous license
once in three months. By the ordinance
the Chief of police is instructed to re
port on the character of all boxing con
tests given as a bos:? <m which to con
sider future applications for permits.
Anticipating the annual fixine: of
water rates the Spring Valley Water
Company put in a.n application to have
rates restored to thÂ» schedule in force
during the year commencing July 1,
1895. The company gives as a reason
for the application that the present
year has been a very dry one, the sup
ply in the reservoirs of the company
has not been increased and in conse
quence of this state of affairs the com
pany has been compelled to expand
large sums of money for pumping
plants and for extra works necessary
to keep up a water supply for San
Francisco.
The extra expenditure is given as
over one million dollars and the state
ment is made that to allow present ex
isting rates to stand would be an in
justire to the company and render it
unable to pay interest on its large in
vestments.

MONDAY NIGHT
AT MOROSCO'S
Harry Mainhall as the De
mented Hero of "The
Unknown."
Pnulding Scores a Surprising Hit in
"Charley's Aunt"â New Or
pheum Turns.
As a usual thing all plays look alike
I to me at Morosco's, but I must confess
I that "The Unknown" does not seem
j like the same old smile. It is written
i in the customary five acts and twelve
or more scenes, employs nearly all of
the veteran situations and characters
and Is of the usual high moral tone
that marks flfty-two Morosco melo
dramas in the year, but it takes violent
liberties with that most honored insti
tution, the hero.
A sailor lad is the hero in "The Un
known." Upon the death of his
father he discovers that he has a half
sister living in the world. So, loaded
down with wills and wedding and birth
certificates he sets sail for home, in

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1898.
HE WAS A TYPICAL CITIZEN.
Death of a Man Who Was Honored and
Widely Beloved.
Hon, John Staude.
Death has claimed another of San Francisco's prominent citizens in the per
son of ex-Asserablyman John Staude. Few if any of the Gorman-Americans in
this city were better or more generally known and respected than John Staude,
the grocer, who kept a store on Pacific street, above Stockton, for the past
thirty years. His popularity was not confined to those of his own nationality.
On the contrary, he was as popular with his American acquaintances as he was
with those to whom he was allied by blood and country. Generous to a fault,
a kind friend, a most devoted husband and loving father, his heirs have noth
ing to regret in bearing his good name.
The history of John Staude is not unlike that of thousands of his country
men who have made the United States their home. Arriving in New York at the
age of 13 years, he went to work at his. trade, that of an upholsterer; but when
this country demanded his services at the time of the civil war, he shouldered
his musket and went to the front, where he remained until the close of the
rebellion. '.
He was among the first to volunteer for the defense of his adopted country.
He entered for the three months' service, joining the Fifth Regiment, New
York State Militia, Colonel Schwartzweller. In IS6I he left with his regiment
for the front. The Fifth went South to Maryland and Virginia, and took gal
lant part in several actions. It was at Harpers Ferry, etc.. and formed part of
the corps of General Banks that repelled General Stuart. Upon the expiration
of his time, Mr. Staude returned 10 New York, and for a time did guard duty
for the Government over the Government property, Fulton and Gold streets.
Following this, he again joined the army, and served with the Sixty-second New
York Volunteers, the Anderson Zouaves, as they were popularly called, Colonel
Wilson commanding. He was in action with them at different places under
General McClellan.
Returning to New York, he met and married his schoolmate, Miss Elizabeth
Goede, then only 16 years of age. This estimable lady remained his devoted
partner through life, and there were born of the marriage Fred, Henry A., John
and Charles, and Mrs. Louis Wiseman, all of whom were natives of this city ex
cept Fred, who first saw the light of day in New York.
On March 9, 1864, Mr. Staude arrived in this city with his wife, having come
by way of the Isthmus. After his arrival he soon was engaged at his trade.
He was with the firm of Goodwin & Co. for a time, then with Joseph Piers, and
for some five years with Horstman, Huf Schmidt & Co. Leaving this business,
he started for himself, and accumulated quite an Independence in real property
in the northern portion of the city.
In politics he was a pronounced Democrat, and for a number of years was
among the leaders of his party. Various offices in the city government were
at his disposal, but in every case he refused to accept a nomination from his
friends at a time when his election was an assured fact. Eventually he was
nominated for the Assembly for the Twenty-eighth session of that body, and
was elected by a handsome majority. His record while' in Sacramento was good,
and with it he retired to private life.
He was a member of the German Benevolent Society, Harmonic Lodge, I. O.
O. F., High Arch Chapter of Druids, Knights of Honor, Independent Rifles, the
Leidercranz, Walhalla Singing Society and Hermann's Sons.
His funeral will take place from Odd Fellows' Hall, Seventh and Market
streets, to-day, at 2 o'clock. Interment at Odd Fellows' Cemetery.
His death was due to dropsy, followed by a stroke of apoplexy.
letter to the sister foretelling his com
ing is intercepted by her villainous
guardian who, together with a hench
man of his, sets out in a small boat
and boards the hero's ship as it sails
into New York harbor. The hero is
easily duped into entering the boat,
where he is speedily shot and dropped
into the bay to makeâ as the villain
grimly remarksâ an item for the m&rn
ing papers.
All this is normally melodramatic,
matic, and so is the scene which fol
lows, in which trusty Jack Salt, who
has followed the boat, pulls the young
master out of the water into the warm,
dry calcium.
But this is only one act, and the
other fourâ or three and a half of them
âfind this hero, who had started out to
be more than averagely capable, in a
pitiable state of insanity. When sister
finds him he has lost his coat and vest,
his shirt is torn in shreds and his hair
and beard are long and tangled. And
as he cannot even remember his name
or address she has no idea who he is
and calls him the "Unknown." But
there is some unseen bond between
them, for she cuts his hair with her
own little scissors and has the butler
shave him and buys him a nice new
sailor shirt and flopping sailor trousers
and three yards of flowing necktie. But
even these attentions do not restore
his reason, and he wanders incoherent
ly through act after act, bracing up in
the finales for just long enough to
punch the villain but never becoming
the man he should be until act five is
well under way and all his chances are
gone.
I am sorry that this fantastic varia
tion of the hero should be indulged dur
ing the first week of Harry Mainhall's
engagement as leading man at Morps
co's. If any one is capable of playing
an indestructible hero, a hero who goes
through red fire and real water and
all the goose-fleshly terrors of melo
drama without turning a hair, it is Mr.
Mainhall. He has shown ub before this
that he is an actor of fine melodramatic
accomplishment; and during the few
sane moments allotted him last night
he played with most human poise and
exploited a lithe, sophisticated person
ality that is just what has been needed
in the Morofeco heroes for as long a
time as I can remember.
Miss Maud Edna Hall, who is always
happiest in a happy part, gives a spir
ited identity to the heroine; Mortimer
Snow is less fortunate in the lighter
moments of the sub-hero, but does well
in the strenuous passages, and Leslie
Morosco farces easily through a comic
character bit. Really excellent melo
dramatic work is done by Fred Butler
as the old salt and Landers Stevens as
the villain. These parts were made to
stand out last night by reason of good
make-ups and acting that had brains
in it.

Alcazar.
If there was anything needed to add
humor to "Charley's Aunt" it was fur
nished last night when Wright Hunting
ton and William EL Pascoe took the parts
of schoolboys and the erstwhile tragic
Romeo, Paulding, played the title role.
"Charley's Aunt" Is a roaring farce to
be sure, but as It Is done at the Alcazar
It becomes more than a farceâ it reaches
the sublime heights of comic tragedy.

the main attraction at the Orpheum last
night notwithstanding the fact that sev

INDICTED
Grand Jury Acts Sum
marily Against the
School Director.
Hears Evidence That Co
nvinces the Inquisitorial
Body of His Guilt.
A Letter Which Contained
Almost Positive Proof of
Malfeasance.
PAPERS TO BE PREPARED.
Board of Education Scandals Have
Reached a Boiling
Pitch.
The current school scandal, Imputing
the custom of place-selling by the Di
rectors, has developed to such a de
gree that the courts are likely to be
invoked to sift the matter to the bot
tom. The charges have gone beyond
the province of vague rumor. Names
are freely mentioned, sums of money
are exactly stated and surrounding
circumstances are jlainly related.
The Grand Jury has taken up the
matter in earnest, and last night de
termined upon action. Facts were
brought before it in such a way that
the majority of the members were con
vinced that at least one member of
the School Board might be indicted
and thereby convicted of betrayal of a
public trust.
It was stated that the director fall
ing under the condemnation of the in
vestigating body is Samuel L. Walter.
A letter, it is understood, was produced
and read before the panel and the
terms of the document apparently con
vinced the members that there was
reasonable expectation for bringing
home to the accused the charge of mal
feasance in office. A vote was taken
and it was decided to have the neces
sary papers prepared and the indict
ment presented at the earliest possible
opportunity.
It is stated that this action is only the
beginning. Since the ventilation of the
scandal independent parties, relying
upon the secrecy guaranteed by the
Grand Jury, have been proffering evi
dence against the Directors of the most
circumstantial nature. It is expected
that other Indictments may follow.
The Grand Jury evidently intends to
follow the Hall of Justice matter closely
and endeavor to Bee that the structure
is pushed to completion at the earliest
possible moment. In pursuance of this
determination the following communica
tion has been prepared and sent to the
Board of Supervisors:
TO THE HONORABLE THE BOARD OP
SUPERVISORS OF THE CITY AND COUN
TY OF SAN FRANCISCOâ Be
lieving- that there is unwarranted delay in the
construction of the Hall of Justice, we re
spectfully ask from you the reasons therefor.
We discover:
Firstâ That the corner stone was laid on the
19th day of December, 1896.
Secondâ That the contract was executed in
January, 1897, providing- for completion by the
Ist day of October, I?S7.
Thirdâ That only about one-tenth â¢of the
work has been done. .-. â 
Fourthâ That no contracts for the pressed
brick work, terra cotta work and fireproof
floors have been let, and that, after the let
ting of these contracts, it will, with all pos
sible dispatch, require at least six months to
complete the building.
Fifthâ That as early as July 13, 1597, your
architects, Messrs. Shea & Shea, called your
attention to the fact that it was necessary
that these contracts be let ,at once. (
Sixthâ That a large body of respectable and
influential citizens, firms and corporations rep
resenting over $100,000,000 of the wealth of
this city, have earnestly requested your Honor
able Board to summon before you the con
tractors for said building and deal with them
according to law, etc.
Seventhâ That a delegation of earnest work
ers of the north end of this city, represented
by their attorney, George D. Shadburne, have,
since the early part of the year 1897, persist
ently and indefatigably urged upon you the
necessity of an early completion of this build
ing.
That the contractors were not complying
with the contract; that $375 per month was
being expended for superintendent and brick
inspector, while but little or no work was
being done; that property in that vicinity was
greatly depreciated and business languished,
which would be greatly relieved by the com
pletion of this structure.
In fact, they have never lost an opportunity
to present this matter to you In the most
urgent manner, and have persistently shown
you that fully 50,000 people are looking anx
iously to the speedy completion of this build-
n Eiehthâ That these contractors have for a
long time refused, and still refuse, to carry
out the directions of your architect. _
Ninthâ That, notwithstanding your Resolu
tion of July 19. 1897, directing your architects
to proceed according to the contract, and giv
ing them full power so to do, yet these con
tractors persistently refuse to obey the direc
tions of the architects, and the work lan-
X1 T>nthâ That by the last report of your Com
mittee on Public Buildings you charge these
citizens above mentioned with desiring "to
induce your committee to interfere with the ar
rangements provided in the contract and spe
cifications and commit your committee to make
some statement In reference to this work, so
that the responsibility for delays # may . . be
credited to your committee"; â¢",â¢;â¢â  "that
your committee are not In favor of holding
meetings to entrap the .committee Into any
Sosit on hostile to the faithful and energetic
SE ormanc! of the work." That from this
statement you deem these citizens are trying

to "entrap" you and not the contractors into
some invidious position.
Lastlyâ From the foregoing we discover
that this disgraceful muddle into which the
building of the Hall of Justice Is thrown is a
matter of public ridicule, from which the peo
ple should be speedily relieved.
Wherefore we respectfully ask your views In
the premises.
Respectfully,
February S. IS9S.

The Mysterious Trouble That Has Assailed
So Many and the Only Way
It Can Be Met.
There can be little doubt that the "grip,"
which has played such sad havoc lor
years, has not only left its effects upon
a great many, but seems to be returning
in various localities. All physic. ans re-
port that there is an alarming prevalence
of heavy colds, accompanied by all grip
symptoms. Many people take colds easier
than before; others are troubled with
weak eyes, headaches, etc. 'inese things
not only come to those who were laid low
Liy the grip last year, but are also visiting
many who escaped. Pains, neuralgia, las-
situde, all the symptoms are present.
Every leadingphysieian who treated the
grip last season prescribed stimulants.
The weakened, depressed state of the
body demanded this, and there are nu-
merous eases on record where pure
whiskey saved the lives of men and women
who were fast drifting toward the grave.
As in all other things, however, the purity
of an article determines its value, and to
say that ordinary whiskey will assist is ab-
surd. It is only pure whiskey of a medical
quality, which can be made available, and
it is In this respect that Duffy's Pure
Malt "Whiskey has shown itself to be im-
measurably superior to any other known
stimulant. The attention of the best
physicians has been drawn to this truth,
and the fact that they are prescribing
this whiskey constantly is the highest
praise they could bestow. Professor
Joseph Parrish says: "We know mat
whiskey will steady the heart, slow the
pulse, calm excitement, and we ought to
use it." Be very careful, however, that
y6u secure only the genuine, and such as
has, by years of popularity, been proven
purest and best. In other words, use only
Duffy's.

hour was about .50 of an Inch la the San Joa

where it ranged from 1.80 to 2.50. It quieted
things djjwn conslderab 1 -- on the Produce fc.x
change, though there wns no decline in any
thing as the fatÂ« In the great valleys was
not heavy enough. It was considered a good
starter, however, an.l a possible precursor or
more copious showers later on, and as such
brightened up the cereal situation considerably.

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig- ;
ures at station Indicate maximum temperature
for the days; those underneath It, if any, the
amount of rainfall, of melted snow In inches
and hundredths during tho past twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lln^s, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied â 
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and Is usually preceded and accompanied '
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure Is high In th*> Interior and low
along the coast, and the Isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is lm
probable. With a "hlgrh" in the vicinity of i
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Call- ;
fornla coest, warmer weather may bÂ« expected â 
Jr. summer and colder weather In winter. The '
reverse of these conditions will produce an i
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Feb. 7.â To-day's market for
â tocks suffered â  the burden of realizing sales
and from the bear pressure to the recrudes
cence of the Cuban scare. â¢ There were special
elements of weakness In addition.- The "Union
Pacific securities were heavy on account of
the announced determination of â  the govern
ment to operate the Kansas Pacing under a
receivership and .to postpone the sale of that
property. The Kansas Pacific .consols opened
off 3% per cent on the strength .of this, but
the buying at the decline was very heavy and
iggrespive, and reassuring reports were given
out that this security was not . likely to be
deprived of its right of . exchange with the
reorganized Union Pacific securities. This ap
parently failed to rally the stocks of the com
pany and they were heavy all day, the pre
ferred going oft at one time l%c and the
common a point. Missouri Pacific showed a re
currence of its recent weakness and declined
at one time a point below Saturday's close.
Lake Shore, New York Central, Northern Pa
cific preferred, and other recent favorites
showed the effects of a continuation of profit
taking. The coalers and the grangers were
In 'the main heavy, Northwest being an ex
ception. Northwest preferred showed a gain
of 3^i over the last transaction. Quite a
number ol stocks were conspicuous for very
vigorous movements.' ; This was notably the
cane with Metropolitan Street Hallway, which
was' at one time h%, above Saturday's close;
but which reacted Isi. Norfolk and Western
preferred was quite strong all . day, and ad
vanced at one time 3%, reacting a fraction on
profit-taking. Michigan Central also renewed
its Interrupted advance, and Is 1% higher for
the day. .
There were some sharp ] gains also in the
usually Inactive high-priced .securities. The
feverish and unsettled condition of the local
corporations was noticeable in the closing deal
ings.
Although the . stock â¢ market was â  not lack-
Ing In activity and Interest,, the bond depart
ment continued to absorb - a large share of
attention and to. show, great strength. " There
were some five .' separate single transactions
In blocks of a par value of â  $100,000 or over.
Three of these were In the ' Atchison â  adjust
ment fours, the total dealings In which footed
up for . the day $1,097,000. The recovery In
Kansas ; Pacific consols to 110:4 brought out a
block .of JIOO.OOO, â¢ which - was ; taken - by -,'. one
dealer. There was a $125, CCO block of the new
' Union Pacific fours sold during the day.
Numerous sharp gains are recorded all
through the bond list. Total sales, $6,660,000.

Prices closed under the best, but Grand Trunks
were better. Copper shares were weak on re
ports that an Important mine Is to be floated
soon.
The trade returns for January are unsatis
factory. The imports are only up 140,000
pounds. Raw materials imported decreased
3.275,000 pounds, largely due to decreased cot

â¢ CHICAGO GRAIX MARKET.
CHICAGO,. Feb. 7.â Chiefly on account of an
early-display of strength at Liverpool, open
ing bids for May Wheat . were at figures a
shade above Saturday's /closing: prices. May
starting at 95@:t5\4c. Liverpool showed HQ'iÂ«d
advance at 1:30 p. m. â  Besides this, world's
shipments showed a considerable falling off,
the total for last -week being 5,513,000 bushels,
compared with 7,346,000 bushels the week' pre
vious. : Another feature which . helped "In the
opening firmness was the strong cargo market
at London, ft sale of Oregon Wheat being re
ported at the equivalent of $1 lj'4 a bushel.
Liverpool warehouse stocks also showed a re
duction of 160,000 bushels for the week. News
bearing on the future crops here and In for
eign countries wan so favorable, however, that
a sealing movement started almost Immediately
after the opening, and the pressure finally be
came so hard that, the market for some time
lout all appearance of strength. May dropped
to 94% cln a few minutes,' and though sea
board reports of a good foreign Inquiry caused
a few of the more timid shorts to cover, which
seat the May- price back â â¢ to S^iJjfSaHc, the

was satisfied to 9tV4c. California reported an
abundance of much-needed rain. Indian crop

It was said, would have more Wheat for Sl
port than expected. Rosarl* cable* stated that
both receipts arid shipments of Argentina.
Wheat were ' increasing. , Northwest receipts
were heavy. For two hours the May price hung
about the bottom, the dullness being varied
rationally by some buying â  against "pui.a."
.Then ; the Letter brokers appeared and com
menced buying at : around S4VÂ£c. They had
made ft show of supporting the market around

THE SITUATION IN CUBA.
We have it on excellent authority,
and from the Insurgent side, that the
Spaniards are now carrying on civil
ized warfare in Cuba. Nevertheless,
autonomy has not been accepted, and
the armies of Gomez and Garcia are
still unconquerable, and there is no
Bign whatever that Captain-General
Blanco will meet with any more suc
cess in the field than did his two pre
decessors. On the other hand, there
Is no reason to believe that the insur
gents can possibly drive the Spaniards
on the island. They can hold on and
they can prevent Cuba from again be
â  coming a producer of Spanish revenue,
while Spain is evidently becoming
tired. The Spanish friends of Weyler
have broken out in riots in Havana,
which have made war seem very near
:to this country. Under the circum
| stances it is not strange that Ameri
cans engaged in the Cuban insurrec
tion should believe that Spain will
quietly drop the island in a few months.
But a good deal still depends on us.-
Harper's Weekly.
MARK TWAIN AND HIS DEBTS.
The Publishers' Weekly learns that
; Mark Twain has paid off three-fourths
: of the indebtedness of C. L. Webster
j & Co., the publishing firm of which he
j was a member. The creditors offered
to settle on a flfty-per cent basis.
Twenty-eight per cent was realized
from the assets. Presently Mr. Clem
ens brought the payments up to 50 per
cent, and not long ago he paid 25 per
cent more. He is quoted as saying that
it will be three years before he can
publish another book, and possibly the
remnants of his debts will hang on un
til then. Meanwhile, however, the
books he has already written are work
ing for him, some of them to very good
purpose. â Harper's Weekly.

DAVIS' CAMP
NOT WILTING
Very Little Prospect of
Unity in Alameda
County.
No Use for a Conference That
Cannot End in a
Result.
The County Campaign Is Now Allied
With the Fight for State
Favc rs.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Feb. 7.
The recent action of the forces of
Dr. George Pardee has not so far
struck terror in the Davis camps. At
the present time both factions are cry
ing "No surrender!" and the average
man Is comparing the political situa
tion to the commercial traveler's hack
neyed story of the immovable rock
and the irresistible locomotive.
While all the rest of the State, if tho
utterances of its newspapers is cor
rectly representing public opinion, is
unanimous that Alameda County has
quarreled so long that it has lost its
chance of securing the Republican
nomination of Governor, it is now
more plain than ever that the local
politicians do not believe that any such
calamity has happened.
The suggestion made Saturday that
It would be desirable to bring the two
camps together for a conference has
not met with any favor from the Davis
side of the divided house. A member
of Mr. Davis' general committee said
this morning: "If they can propose
any plan that will be more effective
or satisfactory than the new primary
law we will give it our consideration.'
This remark was not a random ut
terance. It is at once a notice of de
termination to keep in the field and a
covert expression of confidence in vic
tory at the primary. It also makes
matters very interesting and guaran
tees increasing warmth as the cam
paign develops.
The personnel of the various camps
Js interesting and shows how thor
oughly the spirit of opposition has
been aroused. In Mr. Davis' co-mmit
tee are Senator Stratton, Theo Gier,
Murk Webber, John A. Britton, Valen
tine Hush, John E. Farnum, W. V.
Witcher, George R. Morrow, G. W.
Arpei , Socrate Huff, G. L. Langan, Joe
Henscher, Rube Hunter, M. W. Upton,
W. D. Rowe, George Chase, George D.
Metcalf, H. A. Powell and W. R.

In Dr. Pardee's camp are G. B. Dan

It is daily becoming more evident
that there will be some State and
county combinations, and the delicate
problem is now causing grave anxiety
to candidates. The campaign will be
the hottest known in Alameda County
because of the certainty that it will
mean four years of office. There was
a doubt in 1894 as to whether the act
â¢wus constitutional, but this has been
dissipated and office-holders, chronic
and spasmodic, are all desperate for
fc.-ur years of a good thing.
The Assembly fight is also figuring
largely. Hart H. North having se
cured the Immigration Commissioner-
Bhip, leaves a vacancy in his district,
and should Frank Leavitt enter the
race for the Senate there will be an
other place to be filled.

GIVING THE PRINCE A NAME.
Baptism hy Archbishop Riordan of the Heir of the
House of Poniatowski.
The heir apparent and the future possessor of the royal diadem of Prince Andre Poniatowskl was baptized at
St. Mary's Cathedral last Sunday afternoon in the Roman Catholic faith by His Grace Archbishop Riordan* The
ceremony was without the usual ostentation, being participated in by a limited number of invited friends of the
happy father. The principal objected strenuously to the ceremony, plain and unassuming though it was.
Immediately after the arrival of the carriages bearing the Prince, the candidate, the two sponsors, and the few
friends invited, the party was ushered into the baptismal room adjoining the main vestibule of the church, where
Archbishop Rlordan was in readiness to perform the ceremony. The sacrament was concluded without much mis
hap to his highness, and Archbishop Riordan, after pronouncing the words which had for their object the cleansing
of his soul from the sin of our first parents, bestowed upon him the more than dignified name of Charles Caslmlr
Ponlatowski.
WEDDED HER
STEPFATHER
Mrs. Jennie Culver Now
the Wife of Alex
McÃean.
Her Mother Fatally Injured
In a Runaway Two
Years Ago.
Mr. and Mrs. MeÃean Will Make
Their Residence in
Oakland.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
C<oÃ Broadway, Feb. 7.
Alexander McÃean of the Lakeside
district has surprised his friends by
marrying his stepdaughter. The cere
mony was performed at Los Angeles
last week and was a very! quiet affair.
Oakland society was not even apprised
THIS TIME THE GUN WAS LOADED.
OAKLAND, Feb. 7.â Randolph Thayer was being shown a pisfol In C. M.
Verrill's hardware store this morning, preliminary to making a purchase.
Mrs. M. Altendorf, who was showing the pistol, pointed it toward the floor
and pulled the trigger to show Thayer that its action was perfect. As she
pressed the hammer Thayer saw there was a bullet in it and he cried: "Don't
pull that â the gun is loaded." It was too late to avoid the accident, and the
bullet entered Thayer's abdomen. He was taken to the Receiving Hospital,
but, although an operation was performed, the course of the bullet could not
be traced. Thayer is resting easily, but his condition is regarded as extreme
ly critical.
Mrs. Altendorf cannot explain how the bullet got Into the gun. The
weapon was a new one and only contained the one cartridge. Thayer is a
son of Ned Thayer, the saloon-keeper.
that such an event was contemplated,
it having made up its mind that the
wealthy San Francisco lumber dealer
would not marry again.
Mr. McÃean was made a widower
about two years ago by an unfotunate
accident that ended fatally. Mrs. Mc-
Bean was preparing for a drive, and
had Just entered her carriage when the
horses shied and ran off. They rushed
against a brick wall and Mrs. Carolina
V. McÃean was so severely Injured that
she died shortly after.
Her daughter, Mrs. Jennie B. Culver,
was a frequent visitor to the McÃean
residence on Durant street and was
very popular. She was a daughter of
Mrs. McÃean by a former marriage,
and received a substantial share of
her late mother's estate. Since the
death of Mrs. Caroline McÃean her
daughter has been a frequent visitor
at the residence, but no one surmised
that she contemplated marrying her
stepfather.
Last Tuesday Mr. McÃean met Mrs.
Culver at Los Angeles and they were
quietly married by Rev. J. B. Cantine.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1898.
They will make their residence in this
city.
Mrs. Jennie McÃean has been mar
ried three times, but neither of her for
mer ventures was happy. She was first
the wife of Mr. Hewlett, and after se
curing a divorce from him she mar
ried Mr. Culver. This marriage was
also an unhappy one and Mrs. Culver
again sought the divorce court with
success.
Alexander McÃean Is a well-known
lumber man of San Francisco, but has
made his home in Oakland for many
years. The family has always been
very prominent in society, and it was
mainly because of alleged discrimina
tion against Mrs. McÃean's turn-out
in favor of P. E. Bowles, the banker,
at the Fabiola fete, that the annual
horse meet was discarded.
Mrs. Jennie McÃean is a lady of
charming personality and is well
known in local social circles.
WHAT THE COMPANY CAN DO.
Opinion of the District Attorney on
the Powers of Water Corporations.
OAKLAND, Feb. 7. â City Attorney
Dow handed his opinion to the Water
Committee of the City Council to-day.
The opinion is based upon and quotes ex
tensively from the San Diego water case,
decided by the Supreme Court last year.
The most significant sections of the City
Attorney's opinion are the following:
Mr. Justice Temple also said: "There Is no
11, said: "The service is worth no more
when rendered by ten companies than when
one company furnishes nil the water." and
that the presence of competing companies
should "not call for increased rates."
Mr. Justice Temple said: "There Is no
obligat! n to remunerate water companies for
Investments made cither upon first cost or
present value. The object is to compensate
for services rendered."
In view of the foregoing:, I advise that you
take into consideration the original cost sim
ply as a circumstance or element In deter
mining present value.
Under tho head of operating expenses, the
company Is entitled to charge for keeping
the plant In Its normal condition; and the
sinking of new wells, the building of new
reservoirs, the erection of additional buildings
and the substitution of larger and better pipe
(to the extent of the difference) do not come
undÂ»>r the head of operating expenses, but
should be charged to construction account. If
th!s were not so, a. water plant Inferior in all
thlng3 In a few years could be transformed
Into a water plant superior in everything, at
the expense of the consumer. This would be
an advantage to the owner and a burden to the
rate payer neither contemplated nor juÃtlflej
by the law.
The Water Committee met this after
noon and heard more of the costs of the
plants from the two companies' repre
sentative, but no steps were taken, and
the committee meet again to-morrow.
Councilman Brosnahan introduced a reso
lution to-night that Is Intended to prevent
any mistake in the printing of the ordi
nance such as occurred last year, when
the ordinance was inadvertently left out
one of the ten legal days.
SLADE WILL
NOT EXPOSE
HIS BOOKS
He Violates a Stipula
tion Made in
Court.
Dundon's Partner Proves
to Be a Strict, Jealous
Sabbatarian.
Stratton Explains Himself as
Counselor for the Har
bor Board.
HIS PROFESSIONAL ETHICS.
Another Shady Transaction in Which
the Slade Lumber Company
Was Favored.
The case of the Parafflne Paint Com
pany against the State Board of Har
bor Commissioners will be resumed this
morning in Judge Belcher's court. At
the outset of the proceedings the court
will have to consider the gross manner
in which Slade and his attorney, G. T.
Wright, have violated the stipulation
entered into respecting the privilege of
counsel for the Parafflne Paint Com
pany to examine Slade's books during
the court interim. It was expressly
understood that the attorneys for the
Parafflne Company should have access
to Slade's books, which he was allowed
to take back to his office pending the
conclusion of his testimony. The ad
journment was taken last Friday after
the many disclosures showing a sys
tematic defacement of check stubs and
accounts of the San Francisco Timber
Preservinff Company, plainly of recent
date. It was the motive of Slade's In
vestigation to demonstrate that the fa
voritism enjoyed by the Dundon-Slade
creosoting scheme was paid for secret
ly to the Harbor Board; that certain
sums of money passed from Dundon
and Slade to some member or agent of
the board. Although this fact was not
determined, the raw erasures and al
terations in what were manifestly pri
vate money transactions with some
person or persons whose identity it had
become necessary to conceal, held out
the hope that a closer investigation of
Slade's mysterious bookkeeping meth
ods would establish the fact sought.
Consequently, on Saturday, the first
day after adjournment, counsel for the
Parafflne Company made an attempt to
prosecute their inquiries into the Dun
don-Slade accounts, but were plausibly
urged to give Siade that day to post
his books, the work on which, ft was
said, had fallen behind because of their
retention in court so many days.
The following day, Sunday, counsel
again applied to have the books sub
mitted to them, but on this occasion
they were gravely Informed by Slade's
attorney that his client was too good a
Christian to engage in any sort of la
bor on the Sabbath, and that therefore
the examination would have to be de
ferred until Monday. Yesterday, when
the third trial was made to carry out
the purpose of the stipulation, the
Paramne Company attorneys were no
tified point blank by Slade's attorney,
Mr. Wright, that they would be allow
ed to see the books only while Slade
had them with him on the witness
stand. From all of which it will ap
pear that Judge Belcher may have
something interesting to say about
Slade's books that Mr. Wright did not
anticipate.
Air. Stratton,' special counsel for the
Ha'bor Commission, who finds himself
severely criticized because of the fact
that he advised Slade and the board at
the same time, in the actions of the Pa
cific Pine Lumber Company, which
were compromised, Is preparing to de
fend himself elaborately. He will take
the witness-stand, and besides fortify
his testimony with that of other wit
nesses. "Ordinarily," said he yester
day, "I would not make any statement
with reference to myself In the Harbor
Commission suit, while it Is being tried
in court, and yet, since you have sug
gested the propriety of my explaining
my position, I will avail myself of that
privilege.
"In the first place, I am not, and
never have been, on both sides of any
case. I am not the regular attorney
for the Harbor Commissioners, and act
under employment in special cases
only.
"The fact that the Slade Lumber
Company at one time consulted me
with reference to a particular matter
is no reason for contending that my
opinion given to the Harbor Commis
sioners long after that employment had
ceased should be viewed with suspicion.
I was the attorney for Darby Laydon
& Co. in 1894 and in the early part of
1895 In two suits brought, one against
the Sacramento Bank and one against
the city of Benicia. I have not been
the attorney of Darby Laydon & Co. in
any matter for between three and four
years. I have never been the attor
ney of P. F. Dundon, who was one of
the partners of Darby Laydon & Co.,
but my business relations were almost
exclusively with Darby Laydon. These
matters had nothing whatever to do
with the Harbor Commissioners, even
remotely.
"After my resignation as attorney for
the board, and upon returning from a
trip to Europe, I was employed by the
Commissioners in litigation from time
to time by special engagement. I was
employed In the two injunction suits
brought by the Pacific Pine Lumber
Company against the Harbor Commis
sioners. Tuese suits were originally
brought to restrain the Commissioners
from paying any sum of money in ex
cess of $7 40 per foot to the S. E. Slade
Lumber Company.
"Subsequently the scope of those
suits was somewhat enlarged and went
to the validity of the contract of the
Slade Lumber Company with the Har
bor Commissioners. After being re
tained by the board In those cases Mr.
Slade came to me and wanted to ask
my professional opinion as to his gen
eral rights in his lumber transactions
with the board and with the Pacific
Pine Lumber Co. I accepted this em
ployment, which was temporary and
special in its nature, because under all
ethics of the profession I had the right
so to do. I at once and at that very
time, however, advised Mr. Ford, the
regular attorney of the board, with
whom I was associated In the Pacific
The facsimile " . j~ff y/*rrrT~ *â  on ever I wrapper
: â igaature of : ; Xm^ZT&CgZ^ Â« CASTOEIA.
Pine Lumber suits, of that fact and
even asked his opinion.
"His opinion was that there was per
fect propriety in the matter. I further
at the same time advised the Harbor
Commissioners of the fact that Mr.
Slade had consulted me. This was
done in an open meeting at which were
present the secretary, Mr. Keegan,
Colonel Chadbourne, Mr. Colnon and
Mr. Harney. All these gentlemen re
member the circumstances perfectly. I
further informed them that I would not
advise them thereafter as to any mat
ter in which Mr. Slade might assert
any claim or right as against the
board. I never had advised them in
any matters affecting the Slade Lum
ber Company contract other than what
I had already advised them prior to the
time when Mr. Slade came to mÂ«. Mr.
Slade was not a party to those suits.
His interests and those of the board
were on the same side at that time.
That is, the board had audited his bills
and were seeking to pay him the
money.
"Furthermore, I never advised the
Slade to settle with the Pacific Pine
Lumber Company, and, on the other
hand, I advised the Harbor Commis
sioners against making any settlement
with the Pacific Pine Lumber Com
pany. In fact, I advised against in
any way being a party to any com
promise, directly or indirectly, prefer
ring that the entire matter should be
litigated in the ccurts.
"I think, however, it was to Mr.
Slade's Interest that he made an ar
rangement with the Pacific Pine Lum
ber Company, for the reason that while
the litigation was pending he was de
prived of the interest on his money,
and the same might be tied up from
two to five years.
"Furthermore, I never advised the
board in any way with reference to
entering into a contract with the S. E.
Slade Lumber Company, nor as to the
construction of that contract. The lat
ter was a matter which was prior
thereto passed upon by Mr. Ford, the
regular attorney of the board, in a
written opinion, which is on record and
which has been produced at the trial.
"I never had anything to do- what
ever with the settlement between the
Pacific Pine Lumber Company and the
S. E. Slade Lumber Company. This
was carried on by Mr. Slade personally
without any advice from me, although
he knew what his legal rights were.
The settlement which he made with
the lumber company was unknown to
me, and was first intimated by a let
ter written by Mr. Jordan, the attor
ney of the Pacific Pine Lumber Com
pany, to Mr. Ford, who thereupon ad
vised the board of the dismissal of the
suits, and the S. E. Slade Lumber
Company warrants were thereupon de
livered.
"My connection with the S. E. Slade
Lumber Company ceased on November
1, 1897, and existed for a period of from
four to six weeks only. Mr. Slade
stated at the time that he came to me
for advice that he did so because
Garret McEnerney, whom he desired to
consult, had informed him that he was
bo busy in the Fair estate and other
litigation that he could give him no
time.
"I have never heard it suggested that
because an attorney had been consulted
or advised any individual that there
after his opinions would be tainted in
all independent matters in which that
individual might be connected.
'I never was an attorney for the San
Francisco Timber Preserving Company.
On December 15, 1897, I was called upon
to advise the board aa to what action
they should take with certain bids
which had been presented to them for
creosoting piles. The Slade Lumber
Company was not a party to any of
those bids. The San Francisco Timber
Preserving Company was, however, one
of the bidders, and Mr. Slade was part
owner in this company. This, however,
I do not think I knew until vefy, re
cently. I gave the board certain ad
vice, which advice had been determined
upon, as can be shfnvn conclusively by
witnesses, prior to the time when I had
any knowledge whatever as to who the
lowest bidder for creoaotlng piles might
be.
"I further advised the board with ref
erence to the preparation of new speci
fications. What motives actuated me,
or the Commissioners, in framing these
specifications will be absolutely demon
strated at the trial. lam only speaking
of the matter of professional ethics in
the attempt to construe my conduct in
at one time representing the Slade
Lumber Company as not being proper.
"In so far as changes may have been
made in the entries of any books of the
Timber Preserving Company, which
have been produced in court, I have no
suggestion to make at the present time.
That is a matter which does not con
cern me in the least.
"I have only contended in court that
the hearing should be had under the
ordinary rules of evidence. If the repu
tations of men are to be determined by
what is found In books as to entries in
which they have nothing whatever to
do, then all the rules of evidence must
be revolutionized. I am not criticising
the trial court, for the reason that as I
take it he agrees with me in my inter
pretation of the law, and has stated
that unless the connection between the
Commissioners and the books is shown
in a legal way, the testimony must be
disregarded and stricken out."
Not all the truth respecting the deal
ings of the Slade Lumber Company
with the fiarbor Board has come out.
In the latter part of February, 1897,
Slade's contract to furnish lumber to
the commission expired and new bids
were called for. Just previous to that
time Slade had been receiving about
$13 per thousand feet for lumber, as
called for in his contract. According
to tha books in the office of the secre
tary of the commission the orders for
lumber had been in quantities from
two to five thousand feet, as the re
pairs and construction of buildings de
manded.
Only a day or so before the opening
of the bids for furnishing this material
for the ensuing year Superintendent
Patterson put in an order with Slade
for the enormous quantity of 150,000
feet of 4x6 pine lumber at the old price
of $13 per thousand feet. The excuse
given at the time was that the lumber
was for "urgent repairs." The urgency
of the case may be inferred from the
fact that when the lumber arrived from
the mills it remained stacked up on the
water front for many a long day with
out a saw or a nail being stuck Into It.
The nigger in this pile of Washington
pine turned out to be of huge dimen
sions. It is a fact that several months
prior to the giving of the order men
tioned the lumber combine of the coast
had gone to pieces, in consequence of
which the people were enabled to pur
chase building material at low prices
never reached before in the history of
the lumber trade in the West. Of course
the State could not take advantage of
this cut in prices for the Harbor Com
missioners had a contract with the
Slade Lumber Company at $13 per
thousand feet. The market quotations
at that time were from $6 60 to $8 for
No. 1, or the first class, and about $2
lower for No. 2, or second-class.
The order given by Superintendent
Patterson to the Slade Lumber Com
pany was made only a day or two be
fore the bids for the new contract were
to be let. By waiting a few hours the
Commissioners could have saved ebout
$1000 to the State, if No. 1 lumber was
wanted, or nearly $1600 if No. 2 lumber
was called for. This was spoken of as
"raw work" on the water front. At the
time the transaction attracted some lit
tle attention and those who watched
proceedings laughed when the Commis
sioners made a second explanation,
that the order had been placed "some
time before the meeting" at which the
bids for the contracts were opened, for
his statement was an untruth. That
the market was at a very low ebb was
demonstrated by the fact that one of
the bidders, Byxbee & Clark, offered to
furnish the Commissioners with all the
lumber, No. 1 grade, at $7 40 per thou
sand.
It is anticipated that Slade will be
kept on the witness-stand the better
part of the day. Chief Engineer
Holmes will be recalled also.
It is understood that W. H. Healy,
who was prominently connected with
some of the injunction litigation which
was brought against the board, and
which was afterward compromised, is
out of town. Should he return, he will
be subpenaed, and may be called on to
testify as to his experience as an un
successful lowest bidder when compet
ing with the combine. One of the
things to which he would be called
upon to testify would be in regard to
the rotten and second-hand piles which
he openly charged in the board had
been delivered to him by Darby Lay
don & Co., and which he used in some
repair work.

â  An elderly lady living at Fordham Heights, a part of New York City, and who
was known, to be a warm advocate of Ripans Tabules for any case of liver trouble or
indigestion, said toa reporter whr- visited her for the purpose of learning the particu-
l ars of her ease: f- " I had always employed a phyti^ian and did so on the last occasion
I had for one, but at that timÂ« obtained no beneficial result*. I had never had any r
faith in patent medicines, but having seen Ripans Tabules recommended very highly
' in the New York Herald, I concluded to cive them a trial, and I found they were just
what my case- demanded. : I have sever employed 6, physician since, and that means a
saYlacofSiaeaJL A dollta's w*ta of .; .: , . .;â¢. '
Ripans Tabules
lasts me a month, and I would not be without them now If it were my last dollar."
, At the time of this interview there were present two daughters who specially objected .-
to tLÂ«lr mother giving a testimonial which should parade her name. in the news-:- :
: papers, but to this tho elder lady argued : ; ''There may be other cases just like miCA, : â 
and I am sure I take great pleasure in recommending the tabules to anyone affected
as I was." If the telling about my rase in the papers enables some other person similarly
aflteoted to be as greatly benefited as I have; been, I see \no objection." And the
I daughters, familiar with her case and knowing how earnestly she felt about the bene- â 
fltshe had received from Ripana Tabules, decided that their mother was quite right. â¢â :< 'Â

AN UPSET OR
SO AT OAKLAND
George Miller Ran Away
With the Follansbee
Handicap.
Traverser Could Not Untrack
Himself in the Slippery
Going.
Four Successful Favorites â Harry
Thoburn, a Warm Choice,
Turned Down.
The card for the opening day of the
meeting had a lop-sided look, and only
a moderate-sized crowd viewed the
racing at Emeryville track yesterday.
The condition of several of the racers
seemed to have the handicraft
of Trainer â  Jimmy McCormick
stamped thereon, and horses of the
Burns & Waterhouse string did an
nex three purses. Six events were de
cided. They were all headstrong
choices in the betting. With Judge
Denny taking the handicap, favorites
had a pleasurable day or it.
The downpour of rain left the track
in a slippery condition and no doubt
altered the complexion of things In one
or two instances. The downfall of the
Burns & Waterhouse entries, Trav
erser and Colonel Dan, in the Follans
bee handicap at seven furlongs, was
the most surprising effect of the after
noon's sport. The duo were top-heavy
favorites and both failed to get inside
the money. George Miller, the oldtime
idol, a 4 to 1 chance, ridden by Spencer,
sallied out in front and fairly romped
home the winner, three lengths before
The Schreiber entry. Imperious, with
Johnny Woods up. Buck Massie land
ed Conley and his 12* pounds in the
show.
The opening scramble for two-year
olds was gathered in by Gold Scratch,
the half brother to Braw Scot. Ruling
a slight favorite in the betting over
Claranda and Buena Ventura, he
quickly shot to the front, and in the
hardest kind of a drive won by a neck
from Clarando. E. Come, a "good
thing," played from 10 down to 4*4 to 1,
was a close third.
The six-furlong sprint that followed
looked such a sure thing for the Burns
& Waterhoiise entry, Sybaris, that he
ruled a 3-to-10 chance in the ring. He
made all the running, and, with noth
ing to spare at the end, led the second
choice, Catawba, out a scant length.
Midian, showing improvement, was
third.
The free handicap over one and a
quarter simmered down to a field of
four starters. The black horse Judge
Denny was an odds-on favorite in the
ring, and Thorpe had only to hold his
head up to win galloping from Collins.
Marplot, inclined to run out with Mas
ter Woods, was an indifferent third.
Looking one of the pet things of the
programme, Harry Thoburn, the 7-to
10 favorite for the mile and a sixteenth
run, was raced to a standstill and
beaten by Mereutio, a 9-to-l chance,
piloted by Conley. The pair raced head
and head to the stretch, where Tho
burn began to falter. Mercutio then
took the lead, and, stalling off the
late challenge of Oaric 11, downed that
horse less than a length in a hard
drive.
After the betting on the final five
and-a-half-furlong spin, with a field
of nine lining up, had progressed some
minutes, the. announcement was made
that Napamax, the favorite, would
run with bar plates, and her price
gradually lengthened from 7 to 10 to
2 to 1. She headed her field from the
Jump, winning eased up from the
heavily plunged on Highland Ball.
Hermc-so made a good showing with
his US pounds up, finishing a good
third.
TRACK ITEMS.
The stewards of the Pacific Coast Jorkey
Club will hold a meeting to-night. The cases
of W. J. Spiers. J. D. Lewis, the owner of the
mare Trance, and Jockey Snider, who piloted
her In her races, ami Nolan & Thall. the own
ers of Also Ran. will be given a rehearing.
E. Come, the Ir.vorness two-year- old in the
opening, was a supposed good thing. The
youngster started with a rush when the barrier
went up. l>ut was cut off by Thorjie on Gold
Scratch. Without this interference he might
have taken the purse.
With more luck Buck Massie would have

THEY OBJECT TO
A LAY CATECHISM
An Effort to Amend a Form of
the University of
California.
Interesting Developments Expected
at a Meeting of the Regents
This Evening.
As is generally understood by those .
who are at all posted as to the working
methods of the University of California,
that excellent institution embraces \
among the numerous blanks used by it a
"teachers' registry form," providing for
the report of data regarding the qualifi
cations of its graduates for teachers' po- I
sitions. All teachers from the university
are requested to fill out and return this :
form to the appointment secretaryâ
"whether they desire new positions or
not."
As a matter of course, a great majority
of the questions to be answered bear up
on the applicant's ability a 6 a teacher
and his or her mental and physical fit- â¢
ness for such avocation, but there are a
few interrogatories to which certain
members of the Board of Regents take
exception on the ground that they more
properly belong to the church than the
schoolroom.
"Are you a church member?"
"Of what denomination?"
"If not, what church do you attend?"
These are the questions in the teachers' :
registry form which have fomented !
! something of discord among the regents, '
| and they are to form the subject of an
I interesting discussion at to-night's meet- !
' ing. It is understood that certain mem
j bers of the board are determined to ef- ;
| feet the elimination from the above men- i
I tioned form of these features in the cate
chlsm to be answered by teachers who
would enlist the offices of their alma ma
ter in getting them a job.

that prayer, as an institu- J

REV. FRANK S. FORD, pastor
of the First Christian Church,
advanced a startling theory at
the meeting of the Christian
Church ministers yesterday at
.the Y. M. C. A. building. It was
lat the Y. M. C. A. building. It was
{none other than that prayer as an in
ietitution is dying out in America.
The ministers of the Christian
ichurches meet every Monday to dis
cuss the interests of their denomina-
Father Prendergast does not
agTee with Rev. F. S. Ford in his
statements. He says: "There is
no change in the number of
prayers said at the present time
from that said in the past. In
fact, if there is any change it is
for the better. There is as much
vitality in prayer to-day if not
more. Probably the best evi
dence of this is the attendance
of Catholics of all ages at the
meetings of the various religious
associations to which they belong.
These associations are nearly all
based upon the principle of
prayer.
"So I have no hesitation at all
in asserting that there is no de
terioration among Catholics, but
rather the contrary. As to the
various non-Catholic denomina
tions, I am not sufficiently famil
iar with them to give an intelli
gent opinion. However, from
the multitude of people I am con
stantly meeting who are children
in the first generation of ardent
Protestants, yet who are in
many instances without relig
ious convictions and religious
practices, I am inclined to be
lieve that in the churches, at
least in the United States, there
is considerable falling away
among our Protestant brethren
from their ancient standard."
tion, and at the gatherings papers are
read expressing the views of the clergy.
Rev. Mr. Ford chose for his theme at
yesterday's meeting "Successful
Prayer Meeting," and spoke as follows:
The essentials of a successful "prayer
and praise service" are "too numerous
to mention." Definitions of a successful
prayer and praise meeting would be as
numerous as definers. Who has ever at
tained to an approximate of his own defi
nition of "the best prayer meeting"? How
much less to the sum of all of the ex<*<Â»l
lent of all the definitions of "the best
prayer meeting."
The best prayer meeting is devotional.
It is wholly devotional. It does not mere
ly appeal to the devotional in "the old
etand-bys." but also to the babes in
Christ. If Christianity were head re
ligion a great many meetings composed
almost entirely of dry Intellectual dis
sertations would be eminent successes.
If I were to define a Christian as any one
organ I would call him a heart. We
know that knowledge puffeth up, but
love edilleth. Can we call that a success
ful meeting of which sentiment Is not an
Integral part? Where the eye is never
dimmed by godly sorrow or where the
blossom of joy Is never brightened by an
angel dewdrop? Where the sin of the
â world, our own sins, the sorrows of God's

REV. FRANK S. FORD, Who Believes That Prayer, as an
Institution, Is Dying Out in America.
Rev. E. B. Pond also has views
on the prayers of to-day. He
stated: "I record my decided
opinion that there Is more prayer
In the churches now than ever
before. I am speaking for all
Christian people as I meet them.
I speak for the tone of prayer
meetings. I would say in public
prayer there is greater brevity
and less formality, more depth,
more apparent faith and more
prayer, a great many more,
which means a great many more
Individuals praying."
children (Christian or wandering'), never
cause the heart to voice its sorrow? In
love all men are kindred and the bond of
common devotion is this common tie. I
believe the harshest criticism I ever
heard about a prayer meeting was an in
tended encomium: "I attend prayer
meetings all over the city. I like yours
best of all. Everything seems to be solid.
There's none of that sentiment so com
mon in other churches." I love to go to

odist sister on Mission street. She doesn't

ard Joe Mogan took her in and turned
her over to Matron Keane.
"Take care of little "Willie," she
begged, "he has been without nourish

Mrs. Keane took the child, and, after
wrapping It up snugly, gave him a
bottle of warm milk. The unfortunate
mother was also given something to
eat, which she claimed was the first
to pass her lips In twelve hours. To
Mrs. Keane the woman said her name
was Mary Haynes. Her husband is
John Haynes, a laborer. Two weeks
ago she was delivered of the child she
carried in her arms in the City and
County Hospital. Yesterday morning
she was told by the hospital authori
ties that she would have to seek other
quarters, as the time for caring for
women in her condition was up.
"When I left the hospital with my
baby," she said, "I did r i have even
a nickel. I walked into the city, and,
becoming fatigued, sat down in a park
south of Market street. My baby com

I went to 532 Mission street, where we
had lived, and was surprised to find
that he was not there.

unable to pay his room rent. Tired and
hungry, I again set out to find him, and
when about exhausted I met him. He

The best prayer meeting will call forth
the best of each one from the babe to the

I believe that the most serious proposi
tion with which the church is confronted
is the fact based on statistics that prayer
as an institution is dying out in America.
Rev. Dr. George C. Adams of
the First Congregational Church
thinks that the ministers who
make such assertions have been
dealing with the wrong kind of
people. He said: "Why, in my
church there has been a greater
increase in prayer than ever be
fore. People are not so showy in
their prayers, but there is the
genuine ring to them and there
is the sincerity. No fuss is made
about them as of old, but still
they are there and more of them.
I think that the world is getting
better day by day. I know that
there are many who do not agree
with me, but still I am firm in
that regard. The prayer meet
ings even prove the religious in
clinations of the people."
PURCHASED
LAND FOR
MRS. BARRON
Sale of Valuable Real
Estate on Market
and Eddy.
Purchased by William
Ede and Transferred
to the Widow.
Many Futile Efforts of the Late
Edward Barron to Get
the Reilly Lot.
Comment much beyond the ordinary
was caused yesterday by the announce
ment that William Ede, who recently
purchased of the Reilly estate a valu
able lot with frontage on Market and
Eddy, had conveyed the same to Eva
Rose Barron, widow of Edward Bar
ren. It is said that Mrs. Barron paid
$140,000 for the lot and Improvements
thereon. Before this purchase was
made the Barron estate owned the ad
joining gore or triangle of Market and
Eddy streets and property adjoining
the Reilly lot toward Mason street.
This valuable real estate, fronting
the principal business thoroughfare of
the city, was purchased by Edward
Barron in the palmy bonanza days,
about the time that he cleverly hood
winked Flood, Mackay, O'Brien and
Fair. Barron cleaned up a vast sum
of money, but knowing that the bo
nanza crowd ''had it in" for him, never
risked any further transactions in min
ing stock. To keep out of temptation
he went to France and Ireland, and in
the latter country marched for the
third time to the marriage altar.
There is an interesting story of Bar
ron's efforts to get the lot which his
widow has just obtained. Reilly
bought the strip In the latter "fifties,"
We are to hasten the coming of the day
of the Lord. In connection with the
thought of his second coming Christ
"spoke a parable unto them to the end
that they ought always to pray and not
to faint," and ir the assertion is true we
have reached the time when we can con
clusively answer the query with which
Christ closed this parable, "Nevertheless
when the Son of man cometh will he
find faith on the earth?" There is no use
Rev. â William Hall Moreland,
rector of St. Luke's Episcopal
Church, said: "In my opinion,
frc-m my experience and obser
vations as a minister of the
Gospel, there is at the present
day just as much, if not more,
belief in prayer and the effi
cacy of prayer as there ever
was. There are great numbers
of devout people who pray and
pray fervently, and derive un
told consolation therefrom and
are the better for it. Of course,
on the other hand, there are
some worldly people who do not
pray, just as there are excep
tions to every good rule.
"I take it that the practice .of
prayer, far from dying out, is
very much alive, and there is no
doubt in my mind that new peo
ple every day recognise the
spiritual benefits to be obtained
from that manner of communi
cating with the Creator."
In a prayer meeting unless prayer means
something, and if it means something It
should to us mean something. If prayer
has (I quote from a quotation in "Alone
"With God," p. 47), and God has deter
mined that it should have a. positive and
appreciable influence in directing the
course of human life; If It is, and God
has purposed that it should be. a link of
connection between human mind and di
vine mind by which, through his infinite
condescension, we may actually move his
will: If It is, and God has decreed that
it should be, a power In the universe as
distinct, as natural and as uniform as
the power of gravitation, of light or of
electricity; if man may use It as trust
ingly, as soberly as any of these â I say
It Is the most serious fact with which we
are confronted If the use of this power is
dying out. The best prayer meeting will
be one In which this power is best ap
plied. It will also be im lined to cause
the attendants to do up a little bit of
this power and take it home with them
It will be a meeting. One of the promi
nent among serious problems concerning
the best prayer meetinps Is. How to get
the people out. A show nieht? Eccentric
ity night? An entertainment night?
Christ will. "And I, If I I.- lifted up, will
draw." The people hopf-il they might see
him. One of the prominent reasons for
empty prayer meetir.es is Christless
meetings. There is just this about itâ
that If Christ Is there, the church mem
bers whose desires do not take them there
will, when they arp sure of just what
heaven Is. have a ]>teoe of land to see
about or something- else more desirable
than heaven. You ask how Is this all to
be accomplished? We are trying this, in
debted to C, H. Yatman:
The chairman of our devotional com
mittee called topethor in the lecture-room
of the church sixteen of the members of
the church who were possesssed of gifts
enough to take part unto edification.
She gave them a happy social hour,
after which Â«he nssembled them around
the table, which was tastefully decorated,
and, after a few minutes spent in devo
tional exercises, in which all took part

After lunch she explained to them that
she wished to makf of the prayer-meet
ing: a miffhty pnn-er, one of our best
services, filled with the spirit and with
people, and pledged them to a number of
rules.
A large number of priests and minis
ters who were interviewed yesterday
were unanimous in the belief that the
Rev. F. S. Ford had made a mistake
in his assertions, and that prayer Is on
the increase rather than the decrease.
Their ideas are based on observations
from their own pulpits.
paying for the land the sum of $2800.
Many years later, when big money was
offered for the lot, he discovered. that
Edward ' Barron had bought the land
running through to Eddy from Market
on both sides of his lot. For some rea
son or caprice he refused to sell his
own land so that Barron could have a
frontage of 180 feet on Market street.
More money, than the land was worth
was offered, but still Reilly refused to
sell At length the sum of $110,000 was
proffered, but still Reilly was resolute
in his purpose to hold on. It never ap
peared that he was holding for a higher
price, for the reason that he refused to
discuss ' the question of parting with
the property. By and by he came to
regard It as an insult for any one to
speak to him about selling.

his fathers and Barron went : also to
join the great majority .of the bonanza
crowd. The Widow Barron had her

Barron by his first wife made it so

FIGEL ON TRIAL
FOR HIS LIFE
The Accused Murderer of
Isaac Hoffman Ap
pears in Court
Opening Statements Made try
Attorneys for Prosecution
and Defense.
Alleged That the Deceased Was Seen
With a Revolver by His
Brother Charles.
The opening addresses In the Figel
case regarding the supposed murder of
Isaac Hoffman were made yesterday
morning.
The defendant entered the courtroom
with his attorneys, General Barnes and
Judge Louderback. Judge Murphy and
Assistant District Attorney Hosmer
acted as prosecutors, and at the same
table sat Detectives Ross Whittaker
and Harry Reynolds, who gathered evi
dence in the case.
The courtroom was crowded with the
usual hangers-on, although there were
a few ladies drawn to the scene through
curiosity. They were seated in the gal
lery.
The case has evidently not created
general Interest as yet. Four witnesses
were called during the day, and when
the name of Mrs. Hoffman was called
for the purpose of having the widow
testify as to the family relations exist
ing prior to the death of her husband a
sign of expectancy was seen on all
faces in the court. They were doomed
to disappointment, however, as the wit
ness is not obliged to appear until to
day during the morning session.
Attorney Ach, who was the principal
prosecutor during the preliminary ex
amination, was not to be seen except
for a moment when the trial opened,
but during the afternoon he joined
hands in the prosecution. Judge Mur
phy made the opening statement for
the people. An explanation was made
of the drawing of the interior of the
store formerly occupied by the deceased
and the surroundings and arrangement
of the offices prior to and at the time
of the death of Isaac Hoffman.
"Here is a double door," he said, "and
another one on the south side, and a
platform here, which is before the door
leading to what was Isaac Hoffman's
room; and a partition here divides the
first room and that occupied by Mr.
Rothchilds." The pointer in the hands
of Judge Murphy passed from place to
place on the diagram, and finally rested
on what seemed to be a black speck,
afterward designated as the desk of
Theodore Figel, then chief bookkeeper
and now a defendant in a tragedy. The
location of the safe, the partitions and
desks, as well as the bloody telephone
room door, which will soon be placed in
evidence, were explained.
The stairs leading into the basement
were spoken of and the fact that the
deceased had been seen writing a letter
which was addressed to "Dear Ed" on
the evening of the shooting was talked
of. During the address which carried
a strain of accusations against Theo
dore Figel from beginning to end the
man being tried for his life sat smil
ingly and chewed a small roll of gum
with evident satisfaction.
Then Judge Murphy entered into the
finding of the body and accused Theo
dore Figel erf the crime of murder. The
movements of the dead man were gone
into, and it was stated in the address
that Hoffman had been seen at 6
o'clock talking with a drayman. In the
end that was the last seen of him until
he was found in a wounded and dying
condition. The cries of agony and the
groans heard by the watchman who
found Hoffman writhing on the floor
were described to the jury, and then
the address for the people was closed
with a remark that if possible the de
fendant should be found guilty and
that the verdict would be asked for
by the prosecution if the evidence bore
out the idea at present prevalent in
the minds of the people.
The sensation of the day, however,
was sprung when General Barnes for
the defense stated that he would do
away with the general customs and
fully stated the case of the defendant.
He stated that he had received infor
mation that Charles Hoffman had de
clared and would so testify that he had
seen the revolver found in the store
the night of the tragedy in the posses
sion of the deceased within two days
prior to the time of the shooting.
The case was gone over by the de
fense, and it was declared that even
if Figel had been guilty of embezzle
ment he would not have committed
a murder, as it would have been a det
riment instead of an aid, for the true
state of affairs would all the sooner
come to the attention of the partner,
Rothchild, who. General Barnes said,
was a bitter enemy of the defendant.
Barnes promised to show that Isaac
Hoffman had been troubled about
money matters and family affairs and
that he had sufficient motive for taking
his own life, and that the defendant
in the case had no motive for commit
ting the crime with which he is
charged. He then explained the move
ments of Figel on the fatal night to
show that it would have been Impos
sible for a man to have committed such
a murder and then to cross the bay
and eat dinner, as alleged, with the
cashier of the Nevada Bank, without
showing some effects of the encounter.
Judge Murphy's statements were con
tradicted and then a recess was held,
after which witnesses for the prosecu
tion were examined.
Officer George W. Russell was the
first witness called for the prosecu
tion. He testified that he had been de
tailed by Chief Lees to draw a dia
gram of the building occupied by the
firm of Hoffman & Co. prior to and af
ter the death of Isaac Hoffman, and
that he had been so detailed as he was
the official draughtsman of the police
department. In detail he explained
the position of the various offices in the
building and the arrangement of the
double doors both on the Bush-street
side and the Battery-street entrance.
His testimony bore out the statements
given at the preliminary examination of
the defendant. Following the testi
mony, the diagrams drawn by the wit
ness were placed in evidence and
marked exhibits 1 and 2.
He was followed by witness Stewart
Merrill, who stated that he was a pho
tographer, and that he had, at the sug
gestion of the Chief of Police, taken
photographs of the body of Isaac Hoff
man while in the Morgue, after it had
been removed from his late residence.
The ghastly pictures were admitted as
evidence and were marked people's ex
hibit 3. 4. 6, 6. 7. 8 and 9. W. S. Jones,
another photographer, introduced more
pictures of the scene of the shooting,
and the people's exhibits numbered fif
teen.
Harry Hoffman, the brother of the
deceased, then took the stand. In his
testimony he reviewed the affairs of
his brother up to the time of his death,
his business and social relations and
general physical condition. It was
stated by the witness that his brother
had been right handed and that the

story to the contrary had no founda
tion. He was asked whether or not
the deceased had carried a revolver
during his life time, but the question
was objected to and finally withdrawn.
The witness was excused and the
chair occupied by J. F. Shutte, the
entry clerk for the firm. His answers
bore out the testimony of Harry Hoff
man regarding the business relations
and health of the victim of the bullet
wounds. Objections were made fre
quently by the defense to the ques
tions asked the witness. At length the
prosecution entered into the actions of
the deceased on the evening of the
shooting, but very little information
was gleaned despite the efforts of the
attorneys. The testimony taken at the
preliminary examination seems to have
covered the ground, but an effort was
made to draw out points material to
the prosecution but without avail.
The case will be continued to-day.

The National Athletic Club has matched
Choynski and Sharkey to box twenty
rounds at Woodward's Pavilion on March

Sharkey, who is now In Vallejo. was
telegraphed for last night by Judson
Gibbs. manager of the National Club,
and, although ho reply has been received
from him, It is expected that he will be
here to-day to sign articles, for there is
no doubt of his willingness to enter the
ring.
Choynski Is in the city, and has al
ready commenced his training In the
company of Green, who is getting ready
for his go with Ryan at the Olympic
Club.
Choynski Is in tolerably fine fettle, and
will not take long to get himself in good
condition.
The terms of the match, of course, will
not be agreed upon until Sharkey's ar
rival, but it is understood that no hitting
will be allowed In the clinches, and noth
ing will be left undone to make the con
test strictly "on the square. 11 Sharkey, as
already stated, informed Ed Graney, who
is the matchmaker for Choynski, on last
Friday that he would fight any man,
and when Chovnskfs name was men
