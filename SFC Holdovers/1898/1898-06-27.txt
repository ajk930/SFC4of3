Camara's fleet is not Manila, but Hawaii and finally
San Francisco.

PORT SAID, Egypt, June 26. â A Spanish squadron, con
sisting of the battle-ship Pelayo, as flagship, leading, followed
by the armored cruiser Carlos V, the armed cruiser Patriota,
late the Xormania, carrying twelve guns and a few troops and
marines; the Buenos Ayres, with two guns and a few troops;
the torpedo boat destroyer Audaz; the armed cruiser Isla Panay,
of two guns, carrying stores and a few troops; the Rapido, late
Columbia, of twelve guns, carrying a few troops; the Colon,
<pvhich has no guns or troops and looks like a store ship; the
torpedo boat destroyers Proserpina and Osada, the transport
Covadonga, which has no guns, and the coal ship * San Fran-
cisco. entered the harbor this morning. Except the Carlos V,
Patriota, Audaz and Proserpina, all have very foul bottoms and
apparently are in an untidy condition. They will coal forthwith
from a supply belonging to Cory Brothers.
The following is a list of the ships, commanders, crews and
cargoes: Pelayo, Rear Admiral Camara, Captain Fernandez
Jose, crew 565 men; Carlos V, Captain Jose Jurez, 561 men;
Audaz, Captain Guilletino de Avila. 73 men; Proserpina, Cap
tain Sances, J2 men; Osado, Captain Shimera, 72 men; Rapido,
Captain Compagon, crew 238, troops 200; Patriota. Captain
Barrier, crew 250, troops 200; Buenos Ayres, Captain Grau, crew
198, troops 1044; Isla de Panay, Captain Baste, crew 103,
troops 703; Covadonga, Captain Prestely, crew 117, cargo coal;
Colon. Captain Louis Campos, crew 120. cargo stores; San Fran
cisco, Captain Morrosig, crew 68, cargo ammunition.
A rumor is current that four more warships are expected.
LONDON, June 26. â A dis
patch from Alexandria, Egypt,
says the Spanish squadron, with
transports, has arrived at Port
*Said. Port Said is at the Med
iterranean entrance of the Suez
Canal.
CAIRO, June 26. â Admiral
Camara has not yet asked per
mission to coal at Port Said.
MADRID, June 26.â The ar
rival of the Spanish fleet at Port
Said caused no surprise here, Ad
miral Camara having announced
that he was going to the Philip
pines.
The threat of the American
Government to attack the Span
ish coast has had no effect. A
third squadron is preparing for
the defense of the coast.
A member of the Cabinet in an
interview to-day said: "Let them

they deserve."
REAL CRISIS OF THE WAR IS NEAR AT HAND.
NEW YORK, June 26.â The Herald's Washington correspondent telegraphs: All official Washington consid
ers the real crisis of the war is near at hand, and the present week has been the most important in the history of
the pending strife. Santiago is sure to fall at an early date, and with it must come the destruction or capture of
Admiral Cervera's fleet. The exact date when all of this will happen cannot, of course, be safely predicted, but
the joint work of Admiral Sampson's fleet and General Shafter's army during the present week will, if not entirely
complete, show progress toward the finish. The result, whether it comes this week or next, the officials generally
agree, will have an important bearing upon the future of the war, both as to the duration and plans of operation. It
may work a revolution in Spain, resulting in foreign intervention for peace, or Spain may voluntarily sue for peace.
There are some who believe in the possibility of early peace.
On the other hand, the scope of the general war situation may be enlarged. "V^th Admiral Cervera's fleet
disposed of our fast and formidable battleships and cruisers will be available for organization into a flying squad-

CAMERA'S SHIPS
MAY NOT PASS
THROUGH THE CANAL
NEW YORK, June 26.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: In some
circles a doubt still exists that the
Spanish vessels are going to the Philip
pines.
"It is my belief," said a prominent
naval officer with whom I talked, "that
the canal commissioners will refuse to
permit the Pelayo and Carlos V to go
through the Suez canal on the ground
that their draft is too great. Then these
vessels will return to Spain, and the
people will be told that it is impossible
to go to the relief of the Spanish army
in the Philippines because the water
way is closed to them. Or it may be
that Spain hopes that before the fleet
reaches the Philippines that peace will
be declared. This means that she will
save the only two iron-clar]s she has.
She doubtless appreciated that the dis
patch of the vessels to the West Indias
would mean their prompt destruction
or capture. Public opinion requires
that they leave Spain, and therefore
she sends them to the far East for the
reason that before their arrival at their
destination peace may be secured."
WASHINGTON, June 26.â The notice
from Spain that the Government of
that country has succeeded in purchas
ing three powerful armored cruisers
gains not the slightest credence here.
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, JUNE 27, 1898.
SCENES AND INCIDENTS OF THE VOYAGE OF THE CALIFORNIA AND OREGON VOLUNTEERS AND THEIR RECEPTION BY THE
HOSPITABLE PEOPLE OF HONOLULU. DRAWN BY PIERRE N. BOERiNGER, SPECIAL ARTIST FOR THE CALL WITH THE
FIRST MANILA EXPEDITION.
Although Admiral Camara's squadron
j is at Port Said, there is still doubt that
the vessels are bound for the Philip
pines. Rumors reach here that the only
| ironclads in the squadron, the Pelayo
and Carlos V, have left the squadron
and have returned to Spain, so that
| Camara no longer possesses a force
j that would threaten Dewey. If this be
! so, either the Spanish have realized the
i folly of leaving their home ports un
protected or they have received infor
mation from the British Government
, that the navigation of the Suez canal
i cannot be jeopardized by allowing such
! deep draft, unwieldy ironclads to at
j tempt the passage.
Some attention has been attracted by
i a special from Madrid to a British
! paper saying that Camara's purpose is
J not to attack Dewey, but to seize and
j hold with ships and troops another
| island in the Philippine group. It is
; suspected if this be so that the object
j is purely diplimatic, the Spanish Gov
ernment being anxious to truthfully
assert in the event that peace negotia
tions are forced upon it that the United
States is not in such complete occu
| pancy of the Philippines as would jus
' tify a demand for their retention a3

DEWEY WILL SOON BE
AT HEAD OF NAVY
Coming Retirements That Will Cause
the Manila Hero to Take
First Place.
NEW YORK. June 26.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: By far
the most Important naval register is
sued since the civil war is the forth
coming midsummer volume which is
now in proof. The register is being
prepared under the direction of Cap
tain A. S: Crowninshield, chief of the
Bureau of Navigation. It announces
the active list of the navy, and has a
grand total of 1776 officers, of whom 781
are line officers (Including 65 cadets at
sea), 161 medical officers. 111 pay offi
cers, 200 engineers (including 21 cadets
at sea), 24 chaplains, 11 professors, 37
constructors, lo civil engineers, li>o
warrant officers, sailmakers and mates
and 216 cadets at the Naval Academy,
about half of whom are temporarily at
sea. There have been 2S retirements
since January 1, 1898, among which
â were those of Rear Admirals L. A.
Beardsiee and T. O. Selfridge Jr., and
22 deaths.
Rear Admiral W. A. Kirkland is still
senior officer of the service, but he will
hold this position only three days after
July 1, when he will be relegated to the
retired list, being succeeded by Rear
Admiral J. N. Millor, now commander
lo-cfalef of the Pacific station. Rear
Admiral Miller will only hold the posi
tion of senior officer until November
22, when he will be retired and Rear
Admiral F. N. Bunce, commandant of
the Brooklyn Navy Yard, will succeed
him.
Rear Admiral Bunce's retirement
takes place a month later, and then
Rear Admiral George Dewey, com
mander-in-chief of the Asiatic squad
ron, will assume the coveted office of
the ranking officer of the service, which
he will hold for one year. Commodore
F. V. McNair is the senior officer on the
list of commodores, and he will be pro
moted to the vacancy which will be
caused by the retirement of Rear Ad
miral Kirkland. His promotion will
advance Captain W. T. Sampson to the
grade of commodore. Although Cap
tain Sampson now ranks as rear ad
miral by reason of the gunboat com
mission given him by the President,
he receives only the pay of captain,
which is his actual rank.
Two hundred and ten naval vessels
are in commission, according to the
new register, the greatest number in
active service since the war.
JAPAN'S PREMIER RESIGNS.
Marquis Ito Requests the Mikado to
Form a New Ministry.
LONDON, June 25.â The Tokio corre
spondent of the Times says: "Marquis
Ito, the Premier, has resigned. In ten
dering his resignation, he advised the
Mikado to accept the principle or party
government ami to instruct Count Okuma
Shigenabou and Mitamaki to form a
Ministry. The Emperor will probably act
on Count Ito's advice."
The Ito Cabinet was formed last Janu

Ron for attack upon Spain's home ports. This, in turn, may result in Spain recalling Admiral Camara's fleet now
headed for the Philippines for the protection of her own coast. So, any way you look at it. many important con
tingencies hinge on developments at Santiago within the next few days. Admiral Cervera's ships may yet be the
prey of American ironclads. It developed to-day that the plan under which General Shafter and Rear Admiral
Sampson are operating contemplates the bombardment of the batteries protecting the harbor, so later on as the
American troops are in a fltosition to storm the fortifications and wrest them from the Spaniards the latter will be
demoralized by the navy's fire. The mines in the outer harbor will then be removed and the American ships will
thus be enabled to get into a position where they can discharge their guns at the Spanish vessels, which will assist
the batteries by lying broadside on just back of Cayo Smith. It is positively asserted by naval officials that Rear
Admiral Sampson will not attempt to force the entrance of the harbor as it is not desired to risk a single armored

LIFE ON
BOARD THE
TRANSPORTS
ON BOARD THE TROOPSHIP CITY
OF PEKING, at Honolulu, June 16.â
The day we sailed from San Francisco
the quays were lined, from the Potrero
to Meiggs Wharf, with thousands upon
thousands of weeping mothers and
wives, who had gathered to bid god
speed to their dear ones, and who.
when the transports had passed be
yond their immediate range of vision,
returned to their lonely homes over
looking the Western seas and contin
ued their sorrowful vigil until the dark
mantle of niarht descended upon the
ocean and hid from view the three slen
der columns of smoke ascending to
mingle with the shadows of the distant
horizon.
I suppose ever since our departure
those same mothers, sisters and sweet
hearts have been anxiously awaiting
some word from the boys in blue. Let
thorn know that, as far as the First
is concerned, they need have no anxiety.
All's well â more than well, in the civil
ian's acceptation of that term. There
is not a man in the entire regiment,
from the exceedingly common private
to the magnificent officer and the still
grander member of the staff, who is
not physically perfect from the bottom
of his regulation-clad feet to the top
of his closely cropped head.
'Twas not thus from the very incep
tion of our trip, however. Hardly had
the bar been reached before half the
regiment â officers and all â were leaning
over the side casting their. bread upon
the waters and not caring a cuss
whether it should be returned to them
after many days or not.
Gold braid and shoulder straps will
do a good dea,l toward making life on
a transport bearable, but in the case
of seasickness it availeth not whether
a man is a cook or a colonel.
Our colonel, adjutant and medicaj
corps vied with line officers in their
efforts to make a clean breast at It,
and the non-com, for once in his life
forgot the tremendous importance of
his three stripes and groveled on the
deck with an abjectness that could not
be surpassed by the most timorous re
cruit among us all. â¦
The limit, however, was reached
within thirty-six hours or so, and then
came a change which showed we were
not out on a summer holiday. The reins
of discipline were gradually tightened
until they reached a tension that was
never dreamed of in our camp life at
the Presidirr. They were hauled so taut
that even old regulars among us opened
their eyes In amazement and wondered
what it all meant. But the boys were
made of good stuff and as yet I have
to hear tho first complaint against a
general order. True, there have been
some murmurs, but they have orig
inated in only a few cases where it was
thought that undeserved favors were
granted and an unjust discrimination
shown.
Let this not be misconstrued as
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
against our colonel. Both he and nine
tenths of his officers are as "square"
a lot of men as were ever placed in
command of a body of troops.
At the commencement of the trip
considerable trouble was occasioned by
the manner in which the men were fed.
The rations were good enough and
plentiful enough as they were served
out, but from some cause or other they
wasted away in passing through the
galley until a man hardly got enough
to fill the smallest corner of his
stomach, and that little was so badly
cooked that, in many cases, it was
thrown overboard and the men went

died. The colonel insisted on having
the cocrk brought up with a round turn,
and now everything is lovely and the
goose hangs high.
The majority of the enlisted men in
the regiment come from homes where
the environment was one of cleanliness
and carry with them habits which
make the labors of the sanitary corps
comparatively easy, inasmuch as all
orders looking toward neatness are
cheerfully and intelligently carried out.
But with such a large body of men con
fined in so small a space unusual pre
cautions have to be taken and conse
quently as soon as the men rise in the
morning blankets are taken on deck,
triced up in the rigging and allowed to
air nearly all day. Details from each
section are sent below and, stripped to
the skin, go through the entire length
of the berth deck and thoroughly scrub
each bunk with soap, water and dis
infectants. Later each man, after a
good bath, at the end of an hour, is
lined up while both his clothing and
person are thoroughly inspected. At
stated times the colonel himself goes
along the line, and woe to the unfortu
nate whose clothing, arms and accou
trements are not up to the standard.
Equally strict are the precautions
taken to prevent accidents. Nearly
twenty-five guards are constantly on
watch, and the punishment for any in
fringement of the regulations looking
toward the safety of the ship are very
severe. Fire, the greatest danger the
sailor has to fear, is especially provided
against. Smoking is allowed only in
certain quarters of the vessel, and the
loss of a month's pay, together with
thirty days in the brig, is the penalty
for smoking or carrying a light of any
sort in proscribed parts of the ship.
Two unfortunates have already been
caught and are getting their medicine.
"While at sea the three vessels are
continually in sight of one another, of
ten approaching so close that the men
can recognize their friends on the other
transports and are able to hear the
cheer that invariably answers their
own. The signal corps is continually
at work sending messages of one kind
or another from ship to ship and have
now become so proficient in the use of
the little flag with the red square in its
center that a conversation can be
maintained with hardly any interrup
tion. It may be of interest to the signal
corps of San Francisco to know that
one of its old members, J. Westley
"White, has been detailed for signal
duty from Company L and has shown
up in such fine shape both as a signal
man and a soldier as to win commen
dation from both men and officers.
Rev. Father McKinnon, the regi
mental chaplain, has won the hearts of
the boys hy his kindness and liberality
and when the word goes forth that he
is to hold some sort of service the only
fellows who are absent are those who
are on duty and those unable to get
into the saloon owing to the crowd
gathered there before them.
Last Sunday services were held, and
an eloquent sermon, such a one as
could be listened to with profit by one
of any denomination, was delivered.
At the conclusion of the services it was
evidently decided by those, in authority
that, inasmuch as our souls had just
received a thorough overhauling, it
would be the proper thing to renovate
their earthly tenements. Consequently
all hands were assembled and marched
aft by companies while the doctors
went along the line with their little
sharpened ivories and vaccinated
every mother's son of us, officers and
all. The hoys took the proceeding as
a huge joke, and the loudest laughter
came from the fellows with the sorest
arms.
Our food, consisting for the most
part of bacon, beans and hardtack, has
been varied occasionally by a ration of
fresh beef obtained fro"m the steers we
took with us when we left The kill
ing of a beef is always an occasion of
great interest. When one is about to
die the crowd that gathers to witness
the execution would make one think
that the unfortunate animal must have
committed some terrible crime while
under the influence of too many horns;
or that possibly he was a sort of bo
vine Durrant.
On Monday (Decoration day) oxer
rjsfs wp]-p held on board, and all hands
were given liberty to attend. A plat
form was erected over the engine room
hatch, and there, under a canopy of
American flags. Colonel Smith, together
with Commander Gibson of the navy,
Lieutenant-Colonel Duboce, Chaplain
McKinnon and Captain Smith of the
vessel, took their seats, while the rest
of the officers and men gathered on
deck, or perched on davits, boats or in
the rigging made in their uniforms a
fitting setting for patriotic gems that
flashed forth in a fine programme.
At the conclusion of the set pro
gramme the band struck up "Glory,
Glory, Hallelujah." Some fellow in the
ranks with a magnificent tenor voice
commenced to sing, and in an instant
all hands joined. The effect was im
pressive to the verge of sublimity.
There we were over a thousand miles

TO CAPTURE
SANTIAGO
Forces of Shafterand Gar

Special Cable to The Call nnd the Xew York Herald. Copyrighted, 1808,
l>y Jameo Gordon Bennett.
WITH THE ARMY, Saturday, June 25 (by The Call-
Herald dispatch boat Golden Rod to Port Antonio, Jamaica,
Sunday, June 26). â As a result of to-day's operations 20,000
troops, representing the combined forces of General Shafter and
General Garcia, are ready to strike Santiago a crushing blow.
General Wheeler's division of the army is within ten miles of the
city. General Shafter arrived on the scene to-day and hurried
troops forward in the direction of Santiago.
The last of the army transports -was unloaded at noon and
three hours later an army of 8000 men stretched out to the west
ward of Siboney for a distance of eight miles. An engineering
corps had been sent on ahead to build a military road. The work
of pulling the heavy siege guns through the mountain passes is
slow and tedious, but all will be in readiness for an attack on the
city by the time General Shafter's command comes up from Bai
quiri.
The progress of the army has been retarded by lack of pack
mules. It is extremely difficult to move guns and supplies, and
for this reason attention is centered at the moment upon the work
of the engineers.
Our forces this morning were in full possession of the ad
vanced points they had taken yesterday, and the Spaniards now
must continue their retreat into Sevilla. They cannot long with
stand the advance of the American-Cuban forces. The 2000 Cubans
brought out from Key WWestW r est in transports were landed to-day at
Baiquiri and at once joined Shafter's army.
Our men complained bitterly of the clothing provided by the
Government, which is unsuited for this climate. For seven miles
along the road the troops have left a trail of discarded uniforms
and blankets. T|hey cannot wear woolens in Cuba at this season,
and have embraced the first opportunity to lighten their burden.
There is no longer any question that the cavalry forces al
lowed their enthusiasm to carry them into the ambush in which
they were caught by the Spaniards yesterday morning. Their
daring exploit in dashing into the mountains almost immediately
after landing is now said to have been undertaken without the
knowledge of the commanding general. There is talk of court
marshaling the responsible officers, but so far as I can learn this
proposition has no official status.

singing the old refrain. It was a scene
long to be remembered, and, if it be
my lot to be one of those who return, in
years to come there will often rise be
fore me a picture of the past, and I
will see, floating in the misty vision of
my twilight retrospection, a ship steam

on her decks are gathered the flower of
California's chivalry singing together,
while far away on the edges of the

the flag of Spain, is gradually disap

The run was as smooth as a trip on
an Oakland lake and twice as pleasant.
It would have been made in much
shorter time were it not for the fact
that the Peking and Australia were

sent out by the United States sighted
a foreign shore, and a few hours later
we were steaming around Diamond
Head and into the harbor of Honolulu.
We expected some slight reception. We
received an ovation. The city is ours
from end to end, and each boy in blue
is the owner of all he sees. Hospitality
is a faint word to express the kindness
which, both publicly and privately, is
showered upon us. The master of every

for the relatives of heroes who were killed near Santiago on Friday "
Secretary Alger said in this dispatch: "In burying the dead take
every precaution to exactly locate each grave, so that in some future
time the last resting place of the soldiers can be visited by beloved ones
that are now at home."

GREAT HOSPITALITY
AT FAIR HONOLULU
First Manila Expedition Given a
Generous Reception by the
Hawaiians.
OX BOARD U. S. S. CHARLESTON
AT HONOLULU, June 3.â 1 do not
know whether it is the purpose of the
Hawaiian powers that be and of the
American diplomatic representatives
here to make the Manila expedition an
agency for the annexation by implica
tion of these beautiful islands. Neither
do I know whether it is true, although
I shrewdly suspect it is, that Minister
Sewall has orders to raise the flag in
certain contingencies. I do know, from
what has occurred since the Charleston
came here, that it will be impossible,
nay, farcical, for the island government
to issue that neutrality proclamation
of which there was so much talk be
fore we came. Every tenet of interna
tional law has been violated since the
arrival of the Charleston with the most
cheerful alacrity by all hands. It was
all right, possibly, for the Charleston
to coal here. At all events, she coaled.
Then she proceeded to wait for the
troop ships, while the town and all it
contained were thrown open to us.
The troopships were sighted off Dia
mond Head on Wednesday afternoon.
Then the town literally went wild.
Every Hawaiian resident became a
host, and there was nothing too good
for the boys in blue. They could not
have been welcomed more cordially in
any town in America.
I went down the bay to board the
Australia. The water was black with
boats, the wharves were lined with
shouting thousands, the air was a
flutter with American flags, and on the
soft trade wind breezes there came
floating the strains of sensuous music
â and all night long small boats loaded
down with gayly-clad women floated
around the transports, singing to the
soldier boys the sweet refrain of
"Mauna Loa," and the more stirring
measure "Hawaii Ponoii."
This was the reception to the pri
vates. Up town the Government, the
citizens, the diplomatic corps received
the officers with Hawaiian hospitality.
On Thursday the boys were allowed
on shore and took the town, by bat
talion. The impression they made was
evident in the admiring comment heard
on every side.
This morning the troops were landed
In force, marched to the executive
grounds, headed by their bands, and
were banqueted by the hospit
able citizens. Afterward, or on
Thursday, they found the town, its
beautiful resorts and its public institu
tions thrown open to them.
California should be proud of her sol
dier sons so far away â and Oregon, too,
has reason for pride in her boys.
There was one more incident on
Thursday, a significant incident in view
of what had gone before. This was the
presentation, on the Charleston's deck,
of a silk flag made by the Dowager

Brooke to the Troops at Camp
Thomas.
CHICKAMAUGA NATIONAL MILI
TARY PARK, Gteu, June 26.â 1t is no
lung r v question that a large force
of troops is about to be ordered from
Camp Thomas to the front. An order
was issued by command of Major Gen
eral Brooke to-day, which virtually
amounts to an order, for the move
ment of fifteen regiments to Cuba.
In accordance with this order, the
first division of the First Corps and
two brigades of the second division of
the same corps will form an expedi
tionary for \ and are o"dered to be

igan, 160 th Indiana and First Georgia;
Second Brigade, commanded by Gen
eral McKee and composed of the First
West Virginia. Fifteenth Indiana and

they will ero to Tampa for direct de
parture for Cuba.
That the order means almost an Im
mediate move was signified hy the
general rush t!iis afternoon. The ord

the fitting out of twenty regiments.
As soon as the stores arrived they
were rushed to the various regiments
for which they were Intended. The
order was received with enthusiasm

HEADQUARTERS OF GENERAL
CHAFFEE, two miles beyond Sevilla,
June 26 (by Associated Press dispatch,
boat, Port Antonio, Jamaica, June 27,
12:30 a. m.). â The American troops are
now within four miles of Santiago de
Cuba. Two brigades of Brigadier-Gen
eral Lawton's division, in command of
General Chaffee and Colonel R. H. Hall
of the Second Massaclwsetts Volun
teers, last night and to-day moved for
ward past the village of Sevilla, where
the Spaniards were expected to make
a stand, and occupied the hills to the
right and left.
Two miles beyond, far out in front of
the American forces and occupying the
roads leading to Santiago, is a force of
1500 Cubans under General Carlos Gon
zales.
The entire Cuban army, under direc
tion of General Calixto Garcia, is
marching for a co-operative attack on
Santiago. Garcia, with 5000 Cubans, is
expected from the interior before night
fall, while from Aserradero, twenty
miles to the west of Santiago, 2000 Cu
bans arrived to-day.
There are no Spaniards in the entire
country between Baiquiri, where most
of the American troops were landed,
and Santiago. The retreat' of the ene
my, after yesterday's battle, apparent
ly became a rout, which did not end
until the fortifications around the city
were reached.
The transport Leona to-day brought
to Juragua from Aserradero nearly
2000 insurgents, thoroughly armed and
plentifully supplied with ammunition.
They are part of the army of General
Garcia and have been sent to the front
to join the insurgents already occupy
ing the roads to Santiago.
HEROES OF CARDENAS
TO RECEIVE REWARDS
Three of the Winslow Survivors Who
Displayed Great Gallantry
in Action.
NEW YORK, June 26.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Secretary
Long will reward to-morrow three en
listed men who displayed great gal
lantry in action at Cardenas on May
11, when Ensign W r orth Bagley and five
of the crew of the Winslow were killed.
The men to receive rewards are G. P.
Brady, chief gunner's mate of the tor
pedo boat, P. Cooney and H. Johnson,
both of whom were machinists on the
vessel. The performance of these men
under fire was such as to cause them
to be especially mentioned in the offi
cial report of Lieutenant John Ber
nardou, commanding. I understand
Captain Crowninshield has recom
mended that Brady and Johnson be
promoted to the warrant rank of gun
ner and that Cooney be made car
penter.
Naval officers here hope that the de
partment will reward Lieutenant John
Bernardou for his bravery at Cardenas.
Although he behaved with great gal
lantry he was not recommended to the
consideration of the department by his
superior, and this fact is a barrier In
the way of his promotion. It is under
stood the department officials are con
sidering his case and something may
be done for him.
HARVARD TAKES MORE

NEWPORT NEWS, Va., June 26.â The
auxiliary cruiser Harvard sailed at 2
o'clock this afternoon for Santiago with
the Ninth Massachusetts and two bat
talions of the Thirty-fourth Michigan.
Thousands of people gathered along the
shore and gave vent to their patriotic
ardor by continued cheering as the stately
cruiser moved slowly down the stream.
The cheers were answered with enthusi
asm by the troops who crowded the side

CRIMINAL CARELESSNESS OF
AN ENGINEER.
Runs Into the Train Ahead of Him
and Disappears After the
Wreck to Escape Being
Lynched.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TUPELO, Miss., June 26.â A railway
accident occurred at this place at 3:40
o'clock this afternoon, in w"hich four
members of Colonel Torrey's regiment
of Rough Riders, from Cheyenne, Wyo.,
lost their lives, and others received fa
tal injuries.
The accident occurred on the Kansas
City, Memphis and Birmingham Rail
way. The first section had stopped to
take water, and whistled to start on,
when the second section rounded the
sharp curve in the track just before the
town is reached and dashed into it. In
the rear of the first section was the
sleeper Seville, containing Colonel Tor
rey and his regimental staff. This car
was completely demolished, yet,
strange to say, every inmate escaped
unscathed except the colonel, who is
injured, though not seriously.
The chief fatalities occurred in a
coach which stood in the center of the
first section, which carried Troop C,
from Laramie, Wvo, This coach was
completely telescoped, and the soldiers
within were jammed and bruised be
neath timbers, broken car seats and
other debris. In the second section one
baggage-car was thrown into the ditch,
but in this train few were hurt and
none seriously.
Immediate ao^on was taken by the
soldiers to save their imprisoned com
rades, and with axes, ropes and buck
ets of water the- worked like demons,
tearing away the wreckage to get at
the wounded and dead and quench the
fire which had started in the sleeper
Seville, which was a mass of broken
wreckage, covering a steaming, hiss
ing engine. The wounded were remov
ed to" a vacant building in the town.
The sections contained Troops A, C,
E, L, G and M, forming part of a regi
ment being transported to Jacksonville,
Fla. It is the second United States
Volunteer Cavalry, and was raised by
Colonel Torrey, its commander, in the
Rocky Mountain region, including the
States of Wyoming, Colorado, Idaho,
Nevada and Utah. Those soldiers kill
ed and mortally injured are from the
first named State.
The fault of the accident probably
lies with Engineer Rawls of the second
section, who has disappeared. The sol
diers have threatened to lynch him.
Not a horse was injured, although
several of the stock cars were badly
smashed.
The killed: Willie B. Wallace, Troop
C; Sam Johnson, Troop C; Gordon,
colored porter; Cornelius Lenihan,
Troop C: Private Gimmer, Troop L.
Fatally injured: Henry C. Mapes,
Troop C, both legs cut off; punctured
In the abdomen.
Injured: R. D. Staley, Troop M, el
bow dislocated; E. Perkins, Troop L,
both hips jammed; Wallace Hodge,
Troop G, ankle broken; George Gardi
ner, Troop C, hip hurt; Rudolph Wid
mar, officers' mess cook, back sprained;
Hiram F. Davis, Troop C, ankle sprain
ed; Henry Steltz, Troop C, leg broken;
Will Grovener, Troop C, leg bruised;
Joseph Aaron, Troop C, back sprained;
W. H. Robins. Troop A, ankle dislo
cated; Arthur Evans, Troop E. hip dis
located; Joseph Wilkinson. Troop L,
slightly injured; Schenck, Troop C,
leg badly crushed.
Colonel Torrey was in the stateroom
of the sleeping-car, which was sepa
rated from the engine of the second
section by a short caboose. The force
of the impact carried the first section
forward 300 yards. When the train
stopped Colonel Torrey found himself
outside beneath the wreckage, and al
though his feet were badly bruised he
managed to clamber up the embank
ment. His other injuries are several
bruises about the head. The Injured
are receiving all possible attention.
The engineer was seen late to-night,
but was unable to talk. He received
internal injuries that have caused sev
eral hemorrhages.

VALENCIA, Spain, June 26.â 0n1y
three weeks ago none who regarded his
personal safety could publicly advocate
peace here. Now, however, the subject â¢
is admitted everywhere as debatable.
Platonic aspirations after peace find an
echo from every corner of the land.
Still, when conditions are discussed and
jit is realized that American terms in
volve the loss of nearly all Spain's col
onial possessions, the peace party is at
once placed in a hopeless minority.
With the exception of Pi y Margall, the
veteran federate Republican who has
consistently opposed war from the be
ginning, the Republicans and Carlists
are dead against a peace treaty.
"Peace with America could only be
written on the torn shreds of Spanish A
honor," says a leading Republican or- X
gan here. "The issue,'" it continues,
"is not simply one of victory or defeat.
The question with Spain is. To be vi
not to be? The greatest obstacle to
peace Is the dense ignorance in this
country regarding the strength and re
sources of the United States. At the
last census Spain's population slightly
exceeded 17,000,000, of whom lI,OOOJWO
could neither read nor write. Those
who can read are compelled to gather
information from a press that has trav
estied the "var history from the begin
ning. According to these Spanish au
thorities every American naval vessel
has been disabled at one time or an
other by Spanish guns and towed in a
hopelessly disabled condition from the
scene, while the American dead are se
cretly buried by hundreds. The Amer
ican army is represented day after day
by these journals as a motley rabble of
drunken mercenaries, devoid of all
military grit, led by incompetent, ama
teur officers and directed by a war de
partment, where confusion and divided
counsels reign supreme."
Wheeler's Seat in Congress Vacant.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala.. June 26.âAttor
ney General Fitts has rendered a decision
declaring vacant the seat of Representa

Eighth Alabama District, owing to the
fact that General Wheeler has absented
himself from Washington, having ac
cepted a commission as major general in
the army and being at present with Gen

eral Wheeler failed to resign his seat be
fore going to Cuba.

Murat Halstead Bound for Manila.
Murat Halstead, whose journalistic rep
utation has made him a national figure,
arrived last night from the East. He
will go to Manila with General Merritt,
from whom he received a personal Invi
tation to accompany him to the Philip-|
pines. Halstead first began his news* '
paper career in the late fifties, and dur
ing the war of the rebellion represented
one of the big papers in the front. He
also dabbled in politics and, were it not
for the bitter opposition of his antagon
ists, he would have been the Minister to
Germany in ISS9. Soon after the Civil Wnr
he bought an interest in the Cincinnati
Commercial, which he managed for some
years. In 1890, Halstead moved to Brook
lyn and took charge of the Standard-
Union. Recently he visited Cuba, and
after a careful study of the conditions of
the island he wrote a book on the Cuban
struggle for independence. The visit to.
Manila will be for purely literary pur
poses. He will send letters to a syndi
cate of newspapers.

JPRAGUA. Cuba. June 25 (per Asso- '
elated Press iii>i>atch boat Dandy,
via Kingston, Jamaica, June 26)â The !
initial fight of Colonel Wood's Rough
Riders and the troopers of the First <
and Tenth Regular Cavalry will be |
known in history as the battle of La
Quasina. That it did not end in the
complete slaughter of the Americans
was not due to any miscalculation in j
the plan of the Spanish, for as perfect \
an ambuscade as ever was formed in
the brain of an Apache Indian was pre- j
par. d and Lieutenant Colonel Roose- I
velt and his men walked squarely into
it. For an hour and a half they held
their ground under a storm of bullets
from th.- front and side, and then Colo
nel Wood at the right and Colonel j
velt at the left led a charge :
which turned the tide of battle and
ly flying over the hills
toward Santiago.
It is now definitely known that six
teen nun on the American side were
I, while sixty were wounded or are
reported missing. It is impossible to
calculate the Spanish losses, but it Is j
known th.-y were far heavier than!
those of the Americans, at least as re- j
actual l"ss of life. Already
thirty-seven dead Spanish Boldiers
have been found and buried, while
others art undoubtedly lying in
the thick sh on the side of the i
gully and on th of the hill.
â¢ the main body of the army was
locat.d. The wounded were all re- |
moved.

Captain McCormlck and Captain Lu
na of the First Volunteer Cavalry, who
were reported yesterday as among the ;
dead or wounded, were unharmed, as j
was Colonel Wood, whom Adjutant
Hall reported mortally wounded.
That the Spaniards were thoroughly
I-oste'l us to the route to be taken by
the Americans in their movements to
ward Sevllla was evident, ;is shown by
the careful preparations they hail
made. The main body of the Spaniards
was posted on a hill, on the heavily
wooded slopes of which had been erec
ted two' blockhouses, flanked by irreg
ular intrenehments of stone and fallen
trees. At the bottom of these hills run
two roads, along which Lieutenant Col
onel Roosevelt's men and eight troops
of the First and Tenth Cavalry, with a
battery ot four Howitzers, advanced.
These roads are but little more than
gullies, rough and narrow and at places
almost impassable. In these trails the
fight occurred. Nearly a half mile sep
arated Roosevelt's men from the reg
ulars and between them and on both
of the road in the thick under- I
brush was concealed a force of Span
lards that must have been large, judg
[ng from the terrific and constant fire
they poured in on the Americans.
The fight was opened by the First
and Tenth Cavalry under General
Young. A force of Spaniards was J
known to be in the vicinity of La Qua-
Bina and early in the morning Lieu- j
tenant Colonel Roosevelt's men started
off up the precipitous bluff back of Si
boney to attack the Spaniards on their
right flank. General Young at the same
time taking the road at the foot of the
hill.
About two and a half miles out from
Siboney some Cubans, breathless and
excited, rushed into the camp with the
announcement that the Spaniards were
bul a little way in front and were
strongly entrenched. Quickly the
Hotchkiss guns out in the front were
brought to the rear, while a strong
scouting line was thrown out. Then,
cautiously and in silence, the troops
â  1 forward until a bend in the road
disclosed a hill where the Spaniards
were located. The guns were again
brought to the front and placed in po
sition while the. men crouched in the
road, waiting impatiently to give Roose
velt'B men, who were toiling over the
little trail along the crest of the ridge,
time to get up.
At 7:30 a. m. General Young gave
the command to the men at the Hotch
kiss guns to open fire. The command
was the beginning of a fight that for
stubbornness has seldom been equaled.
The instant the Hotchkiss guns were
fired the hillsides commanding the road
gave forth volley after volley from the
Uausers of the Spanish.
"Don't shoot until you see something
to shoot atl" veiled General Young,
and the men with set jaws and gleam
ing eyes obeyed the order.
Crawling along the edge of the road,
and protecting themselves as much as
possible from the fearful fire of the
Spaniards, the troops, some of them
stripped to the waist, watched the base
of the hill, and when any part of a
Spaniard became visible fired. Never
for an instant did they falter.
One husky warrior of the Tenth Cav
alry, with a ragged wound in his
thigh, coolly knelt behind a rock load
ing and firing, and when told by one
of his comrades that he was wounded
laughed and said:
"Oh, that's all right; that's been
there for some time."
In the meantime, away off to the left,
was heard the crack of the rifles of
Colonel Wood's men and the regular,
deep-toned volley firing of the Spanish.
Over there the American losses were
the greatest.
Colonel Wood's men. with an advance

guard well out in front and two Cuban
guides before them, but apparently
with no flankers, went squarely into
the trap set for them by the Spaniards,
and only the unfaltering courage of
the men in the face of a fire that would
make even a veteran quail prevented
what might have been a disaster. As
it was Troop L, the advance guard, un
der the unfortunate Capron, was sur
roundei, and but for the re-enforce
ments hurriedly sent forward every
man probably would have been killed
or wounded.
"There must have been nearly 1500
Spaniards in front and to the sides of
us." said Lieutenant Roosevelt to-day,
when discussing the fight. "They held
the ridges with rifle pits and machine
guns and had a body of men in ambush
in the thick jungle at the sides of the
road over which we were advancing.
Our advance forward struck the men
in ambush and drove them out. But
they left Captain Capron, Lieutenant
Thomas and about fifteen men killed or
wounded. The Spanish firing was ac
curate â so accurate, indeed, that it
surprised me, and their firing was fear
fully heavy.
"I want to say a word for our own
men," continued Lieutenant Colonel
Roosevelt. "Every officer and man did
his duty up to the handle. Not a man
flinched."
From another officer who took a
prominent part in the fighting more de
tails were obtained.
"When the firing began." said he,
"Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt took the
right wing with Troops G and X under
Captains Llewellyn and Jenkins and
went to the support of Captain Capron,
who was getting it hard. At the same
time Colonel Wood and Major Brodie
took the left wing and advanced in
open order on the Spanish right wing.
Major Brodie was wounded before the
troops had advanced 100 yards. Colonel
Wood then took the right wing and
shifted Colonel Roosevelt to the left.
"In the meantime the fire of the
Spaniards had increased in volume, but,
notwithstanding, an order for a general
charge was given and with a yell the
men sprang forward. Colonel Roose
velt, in front of his men, snatched a
rifle and ammunition belt from a
wounded soldier, and, cheering and
yelling with his men, led the advance.
For a moment the bullets were singing
like a swarm of beees all around them
and every instant some poor fellow
went down. On the right wing Captain
McClintock had his leg broken by a
bullet from a machine gnn, while four
of his men went down. At the same
time Captain Luna of Troop F lost
nine of his men. Then the reserves.
Troops X and E, were ordered up. Col
onel Wood, with the right wing,
charged straight at a blockhouse, 800
yards away, and Colonel Roosevelt, on
the left, charged at the same time. Up
the men went, yelling like fiends and
never stopping to return the fire of the
Spaniards, but keeping on with grim
determination to capture that block
house.
"That charge was the end. \\ hen
within 500 yards of the coveted point
the Spaniards broke and ran and for
the first time we had the pleasure
which the Spaniards had been experi
encing all through the engagement, of
shooting with the enemy in sight."
DYING CAPTAIN CAPRON
HIS OWN AVENGER
Brought Down Two of the Enemy Be
fore Yielding to His Death
Wound.
JURAGUA, Cuba, June 25, per As
sociated Press Dispatch Boat Dandy
(via Kingston, Jamaica, June 26).â 1n
the two hours' fighting, during which
the volunteers battled against their
concealed enemies, enough deeds of
heroism were done to fill a volume.
One of the men of Troop E, desperate
ly wounded, was lying squarely be
tween the lines of fire. Surgeon
Church hurried to his side, and, with
bullets pelting all around him, calmly
dressed the man's wound, bandaged it
and walked unconcernedly back, soon
returning with two men and a litter.
The wounded man was placed on the
litter and brought into our lines.
Another soldier of Troop I, conceal
ing himself as best he could behind a
tree, gave up his place to a wounded
companion and a moment or two later
was himself wounded.
Sergeant Bell stood by the side of
Captain Capron when the latter was
mortally hit. He had seen that he was
fighting against terrible odds, but
never flinched.
"Give me your arm a minute," he
said to the sergeant, and kneeling
down he deliberately aimed and fired
two shots in quick succession. At each
a Spaniard was seen to fall. Bell, in
the meantime, had seized a dead com
rade's gun and knelt beside his cap
tain and fired steadily.
When Captain Capron fell, he gave
the sergeant a parting message to his
wife and father, and bade the ser
geant good-by in a cheerful voice, and
was then borne away dying.
Sergeant Hamilton Fish was the first
man killed by the Spanish fire. He was
near the head of the column as it
turned from the wood road into the
range of the Spanish ambuscade. He
shot one Spaniard who was firing from
the cover of a dense patch of under
brush. When a bullet struck his
breast he sank at the foot of a tree
with his back against it. Captain Cap
ron stood over him shooting and oth
ers rallied around him, covering the
wounded man. The ground this af
ternoon was thick with empty shells
where Fiah .lay.
He lived twenty minutes. He gave
a sm.ill lady's huntlngcase watch from
his belt to a messmate as a last sou
venir.
With the exception of Captain Cap
ron Jill the Rough Riders killed in yes
terday's fight were buried this morn
ing: on the field of action. Their bod
ios were laid in one long trench, each
wrapped in a blanket. Palm leaves
lined the trench and were heaped in
profusion over the dead heroes. Chap
lain Brown read the beautiful Episco
pal burial service for the dead, and as
he knelt in prayer, every trooper, with
bared head, knelt around the trench.
"When the chaplain announced the
hymn "Nearer, My God, to Thee," the
deep bass voices of the men gave a
most impressive rendition of the
music.
The dead Rough Riders rest on the
summit of the hill where they fell.
The siph* is most beautiful. Flowers
and praspps cover the slopes and from
the top a far-reaching view 1b had over
the tropical forest. Chaplain Brown
has marked each srave and has com
plete records for the benefit of friends
of the dead soldiers.
Captain Capron's body was brought
Into Jurasrua this afternoon, but it was
deemed inadvisable to send the re
mains north at this season and the In
terment took plnce on a hillside near
the ponshore, back of the provisional
hospital.
After n brief service a parttnp volley
wns fired over tho prave of the dead
captain, and the hucle sounded "taps"
as the sun sank over the mountain
tops beyond Pnntiafro.

FINAL BATTLE
CANNOT LONG
BE DELAYED
The Armies of Shafter and
Linares Almost Face
to Face.
Forward Movement to Be Ordered
as Soon as Sufficient Sup
plies Are Landed.
ON BOARD THE ASSOCIATED
PRESS DISPATCH BOAT DANDY,
off Jaragua, June 25 (via Kingston, Ja
maica, June 26). â The troops of the
United States and Spain are almost
face to face, and less than four miles
apart. To-night the picket lines at
certain points are within hailing dis
tance of the enemy. It seems certain
the battle of Santiago must come
within a week.
The troops are all ashore, here and
at Baiquiri. with the exception of a
few scattered companies that have
gone forward. The supplies are suffi
cient to enable the army to sustain a
week's campaign at both landing
points, and it is believed the required
supplies will all be ashore by Tuesday.
General Shatter said to a correspond
ent to-day:
"I am well satisfied with the progress
that is being made. The debarka
tion is slow, but considering the limited
facilities and exposed nature of the
landing places, the men have done well.
I only await the landing of sufficient
supplies to begin the movement on
Santiago. I am unable to say when it
will take place. I am much pleased
with the gallant conduct of our men in
the action at Sevilla yesterday, and
with their cool and veteran-like work.
The victory was complete."
General Wheeler, in his official re
port, places the number of dead in the
engagement at Sevilla at 22, and the
wounded between 70 and 80.
The majority of the American troops
are now here, or at the front in the
vicinity of Sevilla. The force at the
latter place, which is about nine miles
from Santiago, numbers 6000 Ameri
cans and lf>oo Cubans. General Wheel
er is in command there, with Generals
Young, Lawton and Chaffee. General

KEY WEST, Fla., June 26.â The
sloop Isabel came Into port this morn
ing flying the Cuban flag. On her were
Captain Rafael Mora, Lieutenant Fe
lix de los Rios and four others of the
f'uban army, carrying concealed dis
patches from the Cuban Government to
Senor T. Estrada Palma of the New
York junta. These dispatches will be
forwarded by the local junta.
The Isabel left Cayo Romano, an is
land off the north coast of Cuba, last
Sunday, and had a smooth passage.
The capital is at La Speranza. twenty
one miles from Cubitas, twenty-eight
miles from the coast and twenty
leagues from Nuevltas. All the mem
bers of the Government are there ex
cept Vice President Capote, who is in
the United States.
The Government's mall system has
been perfected so that full information
from all parts of the island is received
daily. Captain Mora says that two
days before he left Cayo Romano the
Cubans sighted the fleet of American
vessels carrying Shafter's army and
the news caused great rejoicing.
On June 9 a heavy battle was
fought in the Camaguey Province by
General Lopez Recios of the Cuban
army, with a force of 1000 men and 5000
Spaniards. The Spaniards were de
feated and retreated. They buried
their dead in seventeen graves which
the Cubans opened. Some of the
graves contained eleven bodies, others
ten, nine, six, two and so on. In all
the Cubans counted 150 bodies and their
scouts reported that 107 Spaniards were
carried away on litters. The Cubans
had nine men killed and thirty-two
wounded.
General Menocal, with 2000 men,
armed with rifles landed by the Florida
expedition at Fort Banes, is on his way
from Santiago Province to reinforce
General Gomez near San Espiritu. Last
Sunday General Menocal was in Cama
guey Province. He had two field pieces,
one throwing dynamite, and expected
to cross the Moron trocha without any
trouble.
A second army of 3000 men is march
ing east to join General Gomez.
Nuevitas has been badly off for food,
but recently a steamer arrived and
landed a large cargo of provisions. Sub
sequently a big launch from the Ba
hamas landed a cargo of food.
CASTORIA
For Infants and Children.
Wheeler will remain at Sevllla, which
will be made a rendezvous for the
troops landing at Baiquiri, and to this
point the artillery and cavalry is be
ing sent forward from Baiquiri. The
cavalry has been sent ahead to cut a
way through the underbrush.
From the American position at 9e
villa, Santiago is plainly visible and the
fortifications can be seen. The follow
ing reports to General Shafter from
generals at the front show these con
ditions:
"To General Shafter: I have just
seen two negro boys who left Santiago
this morning (Saturday). They report
that soldiers and citizens are very short
of food. The soldiers and officers have
seized all the food in the shops. They
are killing young horses for food and
in the hospitals are subsisting on bread
made of rice flour.
"Three Spanish generals took part in
the fight at Sevilla yesterday. Five
wagonloads of wounded were carried
into Santiago and many other wounded
got there on foot. We can see Morro
Castle and the flag very distinctly from
our position. The Cubans confirm the
reports as to the fine character of the
fortifications around the city. Seven
lines of barbed wire are stretched about
the trenches. The Spaniards have re
cently dug deep trenches around the
entire city, connecting a series of small
forts. WHEELER."
(Dated Saturday afternoon.)
"To Cxoneral Shafter: We can plainly
see Santiago, less than seven miles
away. The country is level for six
miles this side of the city, except for
hills on the south, which extend to
within a mile of Santiago. These hills
appear deserted. Thr> country is fairly
open and it will not be difficult to move
troops over It. General Chaffee occu
pies Sevilla to-day. YOUNG."
(DatÂ£d Saturday evening.)
INTERVENTION MUST
NOT BE TOLERATED
Spanish Journals Say It Would Be
Better to Deal Directly
With the Enemy.
MADRID, June 2Câ The Cabinet held a
long session to-day for the purpose of
devising: national defenses, Senor Sagasta
endeavoring to persuade his colleagues to
defer the consideration of domestic ques
tions. Changes in the Ministry were dis
cussed. The tone of the press is despond
ent and many journals bemoan the fact
that tho powers have abandoned Spain
while she is defending their cause. They
say that France, having 'received com
mercial concession from Washington, re
mains indifferent, while Germany keeps
in the background and Russia uses Spain
as a cat's paw in her diplomacy. Spain
murt in no case, the papers declare, ac
cept the intervention of Europe. It
would be better to treat directly with the
enemy.
It is hoped in official circles that the
Spanish forces will be able to defend San
tiago until General Pando's re-enforce
ments arrive there by forced marches.

You know that our minister used to be a practicing
physician. He was a graduate of the College of Physi-
cians and Surgeons, New York, and he says of Ripans
Tabules that the formula has long been in favor with
medical men, but the method of preparation in the pres-
ent form is modern and a very great convenience. He
lately spoke of them to me in these very words : "I
always keep a vial of the Tabules upon my dressing-
table and use them with confidence whenever occasion
arises. ? For a disturbed condition of the digestive or-
gans I know of nothing so good, and for an 'all round*
family remedy I do not believe there is anything better
to be had'

OUR DOLLARS AND GUNS.
THE United States is to-day the most conspicuous
nation in the world. Europe is regarding us
with an astonished and askant eye. The Orient
does not know what to make of us. Within a twelve
month the Yankee nation, which had hitherto been
ugaided as a rich and progressve republic engrossed
in raising hogs and wheat away off in one corner of
tl'e planet, has suddenly loomed up on the horizon
as the coming dominant power of the world, just as
Rome rose, several thousand years ago. Its fields
are feeding Europe, its fleets are sinking and battering
down everything that stands against them, its armies
are sailing across seas to invade foreign countries,
and its bankers are getting rid of some of their sur
plus gold by loaning it to Europe. This same Yankee
nation has suddenly become an enormous factor to be
considered in all future calculations of diplomacy,
and the question is now being freely asked, Where
will America stop?
The foregoing is suggested by a significant para
graph in the weekly commercial report of R. G. Dun
& Co., as follow?: "Very little of the new business
seen, in proportion to the aggregate, has been caused
by the war. Not any, discoverable by ordinary tests,
has been prevented by the war. Neither has the col
lapse of the wheat speculation caused the excessive
relative decrease of shipments, for exports continue
remarkably large. Gold comes or does not come, as
we want it, the world's markets being evidently at
our command. An offering of bonds by the Govern
ment brings out at the start bids for more than three
times the amount offered, while the popular subscrip
tion already for three-quarters of the amount exhibits
in strong light the confidence of the people."
This paragraph tells the story of our marvelous
commercial rise. There is probably no other nation
in the world which could carry on a foreign war with
so little internal disturbance. In fact, there is no dis
turbance. As far as the humdrum stability of trade is
concerned, there is no war. The industries are main
taining their production with surprising continuity.
The great agricultural regions are calling upon the
factories for enormous quantities of implements,
fencing, cars, building material and railway equip
ment. The seaports are exporting vast quantities of
â wheat, corn and provisions. The railways are re
porting earnings considerably in excess of any pre
vious year. Gold is being sent into the country from
Europe faster than we want it, and we are glad to
loan it back to keep down the surplus. And so it
goes, all along the line.
The great staples show no particular change from
last week. Wool continues quiet, with a steady under
tone, however, which presages a possible revival
later on. Cotton manufacturing has considerably
improved, but the iron trade is quieter. The country's
bank clearings show a gain of 17.4 per cent over the
same week last year. The failures exhibit an increase,
being 285 for the week, against 216 for the same week
in 1897, this being the only unfavorable feature in
sight. The exports of wheat from Atlantic ports for
the week were 3,246,000 bushels, against 1,446.000 last
year, and of corn 2,575.000 bushels, against 1,661.000.
The world still needs our grain, and the exports thus
far this year amount to 213.820.000 bushels of wheat
and 207.317,000 bushels of corn, far more than was
ever before exported in one year. Against this flat
tering exhibit, however, is noted the increase in fail
ures before remarked and a quieting down of the
distributive trade in some parts of the country. But
then it must be remembered that this distributive
trade has lately been abnormally large. The crop
prospects continue fine, but previous extravagant es
timates of the -size of the grain crop are not main
tained.
The local situation is bright. San Francisco mer
chants generally look forward to a fine fall trade,
basing their expectations upon the relative condition
of crops and prices. The fruit-growers, as already
remarked, are doing well, fresh fruit bringing better
returns than for some years, and the dried fruit out
look being brilliant. Even at this early day Europe
is cabling for our views as to possible prices for
apricots and prunes, but the growers, confident of a
good year, decline to name any quotations. The can
ners are scouring the interior for peaches and apri
cots, and are paying good prices with refreshing
cheerfulness. Prices for hay and grain are above the
normal for some years back, and though wheat has
been very depressed of late, a reaction is confidently
expected by the shrewd ones in the trade. Cattle,
sheep and hogs are bringing good prices, and hogs
have risen to a figure where local dealers are impelled
to import dressed hogs from the West. Provisions
are in steady demand at profitable quotations, and the
inquiry for hides is brisk. In short, almost every
thing produced by the farmer is selling well at prices
which enable him to make a good living off his land,
nnd as long as this condition of affairs continues the
State will be prosperous.
CRITICISM THAT HURTS.
AS a rule Republicans can regard with compara
tive indifference the criticisms made upon the
policies and performances of their party by
Democratic opponents. These policies have proven
so advantageous to the nation, and the performances
have so far fulfilled all platform promises, that in the
main the Republican position is unassailable. In the
lack of legislation for the purpose of promoting an
American merchant marine, however, one point of
weakness is found, and that point has been so ex
posed of late through the difficulty experienced by the
Government in obtaining transport ships that an at
tack upon it is extremely harassing.
The abler and more aggressive organs of the Dem
ocrats have been quick to spy out Oils weakness in
the Republican position and turn their batteries upon
it. All along the line the great free trade journals of
the East are harping upon the .lack of transports,
charging the Republican party with responsibility for
our deficient merchant marine and vigorously de
nouncing the majority in Congress for not providing
a remedy for the evil.
The attacks of course are unfair. Like all Demo
cratic criticisms upon Republican administrations,
they are largely made up of misrepresentations, and
not infrequently they so distort the facts as to vir
tually amount to falsehoods. Nevertheless there is
a sufficient element of truth in them to make them
effective weapons in political discussion.
The New York Times is right in saying: "Th*
most urgent need of the Government now is trans
port ships. Our military operations are delayed, our
brave men are endangered and perishing daily because
re-enforcements of troops and material are held back
for want of transports." Equally right is the Phila
delphia Record in the statement: "It is a very slip
shod and shortsighted beginning in a policy of colo
nization and imperialism to be seizing islands â near
and remote, in the Atlantic and Pacific â and to be
hammering down forts, while at the same time we
are unable to find the means of transporting our sol
diers to occupy the territory we have seized or to
fight for its retention."
It is no effective answer to these charges to say
that the Democrats when in power did no more for
American shipping than the Republicans have done.
It would be a sad state of affairs indeed if Republican
performances were to be measured by Democratic
standards. The party of protection to all American
industries can never justify itself for neglecting one
of them by asserting that the opposition party has
done no better.
The Republican platform of 1896 declared: "We
favor restoring the early American policy of discrim
inating duties for the upbuilding of our merchant
marine and the protection of our shipping in the
foreign carrying trade, so that American ships â the
product of American labor employed in American
shipyards, sailing under the stars and stripes and
manned, officered and owned by Americans â may
regain the cam-ing of our foreign commerce."
On that platform and upon that pledge the people
elected a Republican President and a Republican Con
gress. Up to this time, however, not a single step
has been taken to foster and promote our merchant
marine. Now the nation needs transports, and be
hold it has none. We have been compelled to grant
American registry to foreign vessels in order to
embark our troops to Manila and to Cuba. It is not
to be wondered that astute Democrats have chosen
this point for attack upon the Republican record, and
it is safe to pay they will continue it until they are
silenced by legislation in fulfillment of the pledge.
THE ELECTIONS IN EUROPE.
WE have been so much engaged with war
matters of late that we have given but little
attention to affairs in Europe outside of reports
of possible European interference with our control
of Manila. Much, however, has been going on there
that is worthy of notice and even of study. This is
particularly true of the recent elections in France and
Germany, where the results have been widely different
from what might have been expected by persons who
have thought only of wars and international compli
cations.
In both countries the elections have shown that the
people are thinking a great deal more of home affairs
than of any territorial or military expansion. They
show, moreover, that the drift of public sentiment in
both countries is toward economic and social re
forms. The Radicals virtually triumphed in France
and the Socialists made larger gains than any other
party in Germany. There is of course a wide differ
ence between French radicalism and German social
ism, so far as their political programmes go, but the
spirit among the people which animates the move
ment in the two countries is essentially the same â
that of discontent with the existing order of things
and revolt against its authority.
The election results in Germany have been, it is
said, highly irritating to the Emperor. His aggres
sive foreign policy carried out in China and his ap
peal to the warlike spirit of his people through the in
crease of the navy has apparently not affected the
popular mind in the least. They voted on local issues
without regard to imperial policies, and elected so
many Socialists that the Emperor is quoted as hav
ing said, "It is time to stop persuasion and try more
drastic measures, or these fellows will destroy all."
It is clear that both in France and in Germany the
people are at this time more intent on providing a
remedy for wrongs at home than upon acquiring
glory abroad. In neither country are the majority
of citizens so devoted to the army as reports would
sometimes incline us to believe. This attitude of the
public mind in two such powerful nations may be an
augury of a long peace, but it may also be the oppo
site. Governments have been known in times past
to go to war simply to distract the attention of their
people from local affairs. If the Germans persist in
talking of socialism despite the Kaiser's bluff at war
in the Orient, he may some day be induced to try the
effect of a real war. That would probably seem to
many of his counselors a safer means of checking
the home revolt than his suggested drastic measures
of suppression.
Some of those rioting women up in Wisconsir
ought to be drafted for service in Cuba. Then the
Spaniards would never stop running until they had
jumped into the bay.
Apparently every man under arms who gets the
least chance to show that he is a hero straightway
takes advantage of the chance.
While there is every likelihood that Havana lacks
both ammunition and food, Blanco's typewriter
hasn't acknowledged it yet.
No apology has appeared in the Examiner for the
bogus Hobson letter. But then, the apology would
have been a fake, too.
It is now too late to talk of any compromise peace
conditions. The Spaniards must simply pack up and
get out.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 27, 1898.
THE PROGRESS Op THE WAR.
DURING the past week the land fighting in
Cuba began vigorously on the part of our
troops and was met by a guerrilla resistance on
the part of the Spaniards. A contest resulted of suf
ficient importance to be heralded as the first land
battle of the war, though when measured by the
mighty conflicts of our civil strife it would hardly
have been noted as a skirmish. The advance of our
troops was checked for hardly more than an hour
and we now have Santiago invested on the land side
as well as blockaded by sea.
According to the reports, the advance of our|roops
was largely aided by the forces of the Cubans. They
co-operated with considerable effect and managed
to hold the attention of a large number of Spaniards,
thus preventing a consolidation of the entire Spanish
force against our advance guard. These reports of
Cuban activity are encouraging, for however ineffi
cient the insurgents might be in an open pitched bat
tle, it is unquestionable they can be of vast service in
watching and harassing any Spanish movements of
a bushwhacking or guerrilla character.
From the events of the week it seems clear the
Spanish generals do not intend to risk anything on a
battle in the open. The resistance made to ouradvance
could hardly have been designed to stop it. The aim of
the Spaniards seems to have been to take advantage
of the ground to ambuscade our troops wherever pos
sible, to kill as many as they could without great risk
to themselves, and then fall back the moment their
positions became subject to our attack. This means
of course that they will hold all their troops for the
defense of Santiago, and make their sole determined
fight behind the entrenchments of that city.
It is announced that General Shafter, after driving
the Spaniards into Santiago, will not make a deter
mined effort to capture the place until the arrival of
his artillery, which has been delayed. In the mean
time there may be severe skirmishing almost every
day with the Spanish forces in the suburbs. It has
ceased to be wholly a one-sided contest. We no
longer get reports of conflicts ending with the an-
nouncement "No loss on our side." Mourning and
grief are now to be heard in American homes as well
as in those of Spain, and the war is on in earnest.
Reports from Madrid are encouraging to the hopes
of an early return of peace. The Ministry is going
to pieces. The war party is said to have lost prestige
and the prediction is made that even if Sagasta main
tains his position as Premier he will within a week
make every effort possible to put an end to a conflict
in which Spain has no hope of gaining anything.
Too much confidence, however, should not be placed
in these reports. The Spaniards are a stubborn peo
ple. The war is not costing them very much. Their
fleets are resting quietly in port. Their troops are
already in Cuba. It entails no great expenditure to
maintain them there, and the chances are they will not
surrender to us either Santiago or Havana until we
have compelled them by fore; of arms.
A BOOK FOR LOVERS.
SENATOR STEWART, as is well known, has
long been in the habit of loading his speeches
on financial questions with quotations from
what lie calls "eminent authorities." They are now
telling a story in Washington to the effect that at the
close of a lengthy extract read by Stewart in a recent
speech Senator Hoar inquired from what book the
Senator from Nevada had been reading. "It is an
analysis of the functions of money, by William M.
Stewart, United States Senator," was the reply.
This book, which places Senator Stewart himself
among the eminent authorities who have written on
financial subjects in a manner agreeable to the fiat
money theorists, has now been received at this office,
and since it comes to us direct with "the compliments
of the author" it is entitled to something more than
a mere book notice. It is a small volume of only
ninety-four pages and affords a proof that the Sen
ator, although unwearying in speech, is not so ex
haustless with the pen. Compared with his usual
financial utterances, what he has written might be de
scribed as a booklet rather than a work.
The volume is dedicated to "the young men and
women of the United States who are contemplating
matrimony with its inevitable responsibilities." It
may be regarded, therefore, as a book for lovers, to
be read in dimly lighted parlors where the gas is
turned low, rather than for statesmen or politicians
to study in the full blaze of fierce political con
troversies.
The reason why the volume is dedicated to those
who contemplate matrimony is explained by the
author. He says: "The families and friends of
yjsung women oppose their marriage with young men
otherwise worthy on account of the fear that it will
be impossible for the united efforts of both to save
them from poverty and want. The author believes
that a careful study of this book will enable the people
through the intelligent exercise of the elective
franchise to restore the conditions enjoyed by former
generations when happy homes were established
throughout our vast domain."
The volume is in effect a campaign document di
rected to those voters who are contemplating matri
mony and desire good times as well as a honeymoon.
It opens with a long quotation from Aristotle con
cerning the functions of money and proceeds to argue
from the Aristotelian dictum that money is not a
commodity but a creation of law. The fact that the
number of men in high official station and of pro
fessors of political economy in American colleges who
hold the opposite view is increasing does not affect
the Senator in the slightest. He says: "The conten
tion maintained by the fading intellectual capacity of
economists, or by the selfish cunning of money get
ters, that gold is money must be regarded in the
same light as the contention that the world is flat, or
that witchcratt was a well-known device of the devil."
The chief end and object of the book is to show
that a? money is a creation of law, it will be as easy
for Congress to make it out of silver as out of gold.
This contention has been argued over so much in this
country in recent years it is not worth while to go
over it again. We would be glad if Senator Stewart's
book should encourage matrimony, for marriage is
a good thing, but we advise nobody to marry on a
fiat basis and hope to support a family by voting for
free silver.
When Roosevelt's Rough Riders get into action
there seems to be no distinction between the cowboy
and the rich young man supposed to be of the kid
glove brand.
Announcement is made that Madrid does not "like
the signs" to be read in the vicinity of Santiago.
Occasionally even Madrid can display indications of
temporary sanity.
French statesmen seem coy about going into a Cab
inet where their one effective act would be that of
resigning to avoid being kicked out. .
Sometimes an unworthy suspicion arisej that
Sampson's reduction of Spanish forts is the reductio
ad absurdum we read about.
EDITORIAL COMMENTS ON THE WAR.
NO MACHINE-MADE WARRIORS.
So with machine-made armies and navies. They can be built up Into
splendid masses, they can be taught bravery as a mechanical habit, and
even heroism as a matter of obedience. But no magnificence of manufac
ture can equal the creation animated by its own spirit. Intelligenceâ the
mastery of mind over matterâ is bound to be a controlling factor in the
world's destinies, and the soldier who feels while he fightsâ who knows that
he is part and not a tool of the wholeâ who willingly makes himself a ma
chine for another to work with, because he understands the causes and aims
of such subordinationâ such a warrior is bound in the end to overcome all
foes. The American idea is that of many in one, as opposed to the foreign
principle of one in many. A high standard can be set and kept in the me
chanical limit. Its strength without the hold of its creator is like the speed
of an engine whose engineer is not at the throttleâ great, but wild, danger
ous, full of mischievous possibilitiesâ following blindly what is to its dark
ened powers of perception, a blind fate. But where the human element is
recognized and fostered, this blind submission of matter is not possible. As
perfect a system of discipline as rigid and stern in its requirements as any
in use in Europe, is possible under our institutions. But it can never be so
machine-made, for in each man, it is enlightened by intelligence, fostered
by sympathy, and its vital springs of action lie in appeals to both head and
heart. â Baltimore American.
MAY STIMULATE POETS.
That our literary sense may be greatly stimulated before we get through
Is surely possible. Our poets may mature with the war. But we should
not expect the benefit to be confined to one only of the belligerents. Spain
has a literary tradition that casts ours into the shade; she has a large body
of respectable contemporary writers. They should certainly feel the quick
ening and fructifying influence of war, if Sir Walter Besant is right. But
Senora Emilia Pardo Bazan, speaking for them in the last number of the
Revue dcs Revues, says that the war has brought them to a kind of sterile
despair. "When a nation finds itself at the edge of a precipice," she writes,
"it is forced to withdraw its attention from its writers. Letters require a
tranquil spirit." We are bound to believe that the Spaniard, tasting the
bitterness of war, is nearer the truth than the Englishman, knowing it
only as a spectacle. â New York Evening Post.
ENLISTED MEN OF THE NAVY.
The splendid behavior of the enlisted men of the navy in this war Is in
perfect harmony with the most cherished traditions of the service. It may
not be possible to excel the devotion, the patriotism, the heroism of the
sailors of the Union in former wars, but it settled beyond doubt that the
crews of our modern ships are equal to any emergency, are unsurpassed in
bravery and efficiency by the best of their predecessors in the United States
service, or any of their contemporaries under other flags. The men of
Dewey's squadron, the men with Sampson and Schley, the crew of the Ore
gon, all display those great qualities without which the best ships, the
finest equipment and the most capable commanders would be less likely to
win victories than to encounter defeats; those qualities with which good
ships, under capable commanders, are practically invincible in any' fight in
which they have a possibility of victory. Congress and the country used
to be officially informed annually that the crews of our warships were chiefly
composed of "the refuse of foreign navies." It was, perhaps, an exaggera
tion, yet there was too much truth in it. But "we have changed all that."
The sailors of foreign birth are as reliable, capable and patriotic as their
messmates who are native born. In the navy, as in the army and in civil
life, native and adopted citizens display equal loyalty to the Government,
equal zeal in defense of the flag, equal and unsurpassable heroism when vol
unteers for daring, dangerous or even desperate deeds are called for. â
Washington Post.
GENUINE AMERICAN UNITY.
Now the interests of the country are one. The division is only history.
No power of guns can keep the Supreme Court from making any decisions
it pleases, within the constitution and laws, as to States' rights, and such
decisions must affect all the States equally. There is absolutely no division
now, nor is any division on the lines possible in the future. There is no more
reason why Grant and Lee may not be considered, without prejudice, as
great characters in American history, than why Cromwell and Prince
Rupert may not be so considered in English history. The supporters of the
King were expected to submit, not resent, while Cromwell was Protector.
The supporters of Parliament were expected to submit, not resent, when the
Stuarts returned to the throne. There is room for genuine American unity
on the same basis now, and the proposition to return the Confederate flags
is an invitation to union on this basis. There can be no doubt of the result,
for the invitation has been accepted long ago, and American pride in the
achievements of Dewey, once of Vermont, and Hobson, once of Alabama
both now of Americaâ will cement the unity of feeling that community of
interest has long demanded and banish all present feeling of hostility from
the recollection of the antagonism of the past.â Florida Times-Union and
Citizen.
ENTANGLING ALLIANCES.
Twelve ?-ears after the father of his country admonished us against "en
tangling alliances," Robert Fulton first practically demonstrated the propo
sition of the propulsion of ships by steam. Eight years later James Steph
enson built the first steam locomotive with a speed of rix miles an hour.
Fifteen years later a speed of thirty-five miles an hour was attained by the
builder of the first locomotive. Not until 1841 was the pratical application
of the screw propeller to steamships demonstrated. This, too, was done by
an American. Wedged in between these developments is the subjugation
of the subtle electric force to the uses of mankind. This>, again, was done
by an American. All of these marvelous inventions that have wrought such
changes in the physical, political and social world have been made since
Washington wrote that "at this great distance from the northern parts of
Europe we hear of wars and rumors of wars as if they were the events or
reports of another planet." We had a full account of the battle of Manila a
few hours after it occurred four thousand miles further from our shores
than are the northern parts of Europe. The father of his country might
have modified his advice to his beloved nation against "entangling alli
ances" had he known that so soon after his death we were to stretch our
domain across the continent; that we were to make the most distant parts
of the earth next door neighbors; that we wore to store up here in the nat
ural process of development a national energy, intelligence alnd wealth such
as the world has never seen. â St. Louis Republic.
HEROES OF THE STOKEHOLE.
At Manila, off Havana, before Santiago, in storm or in quiet seas, the
true heroes are those in the stokehole. With hatches battened, far down
below the .water line, knowing nothing of what is going on, it may be to
go down with the boat without hope of escape, with death in horrible
forms threatening on all sides, the men in the fire and engine rooms serve
their country and serve it well. On the deck, behind the guns, the compar
ative freedom and openness of the conflict stimulate; down below it is the
grimness of duty with nothing to relieve the tension and the surround
ings that make for physical depression if not mental despair. Here is a bit
of the log of the Oregon:
"On the morning of April 30 weather was scorching hot; down in the fire
and engine rooms the temperature reached 150 degrees Fahrenheit. The
Oregon plunged ahead at a speed of fourteen and a half knots, with only
natural draught. For ten hours she ran at this speed. In this run James
McGaragle, first fireman, was prostrated by heat, !>ut in a few minutes re
covered, and insisted on being taken back to his post. At no time, it is said
during the fntire voyage was the temperature in the engine room ever be
low 125 degrees."
This but fairly pictures the facts. They can with difficulty be realized
by those who fin<l a temperature of 98 in the free air, and with the breeze in
their face, oppressive and maddening. And yet the heroes of the stoke
hole stand this and more; even when the body gives way the mind still re
mains steadfast to its indomitable purpose to do and dare all. With the
names of those who, on deck or in turret, on a fair field, riding rough
charging with set face, meet glnry, should be set on high, above them, the
heroes of the stokehole. â Philadelphia Press.

The French battleship Charlemagne has
passed through a. number of steam trials,
which were apparently satisfactory. With
14,300 horsepower she made 17.7 knots in
a run of four hours, and with only one
of her three screws in operation she de

Rear Admiral Arthur Khyvet Wilson,
controller in the British admiralty, won
his Victoria Cross in the following man
ner: In 1884 he was in the Soudan cam

at El Teb. At the most critical moment
of the action a gap was made in the
British square, and half a dozen Der
vlahcs rushed at it to break in. Cap
tain Wilson, who was near the spot,
moved out alone to moet them. His
sword broke in cutting one man down,
but Wilson held his ground, knocking the
Dervishes down one after the other with
his fist. He escaped practically un
harmed and the square closed up and
rescued the gallant officer.

speed. Then for three days she was
plunging into a heavy head sea. so that
all things d, the warship made
good time. With her bottom cleaned and
painted the Bennlnffton could easily cover
the Bame distance in six days.
Owing to the Peru being long overdue
at Honolulu tha Hawaiian Government

mail that was intended for that steamer.
In consequence the Bennington brought

CONVERTS TO THE FAITH.
Eighty Adults Are Confirmed by
Archbishop Riordan at the
Paulist Church.
Over 150 children and adults knelt be
fore the altar at the Paulist Church yes
terday to receive the sacrament of con
firmation. The ceremony, conducted by
Archbishop Riordan, was made unusually
impressive by the presence of nearly 100
men and women, ranging all the way
from the years of mature manhood anu
womanhood to the decrepitude of old age.
The children, numbering seventy boys and
girls, -were dressed in the usual confirma
tion dn ss. th<- boys wearing the silken
ribbon affixed to the left arm and the
Kiris robed in white with their features
hidden by the veil which custom has dic
tated. Imnu-diutely after the confirma
tion ceremony an address was delivered
by Archbishop Riordan, in which he out
lined the object of confirmation, touch
ing upon the new faith of those who had
lately embraced Catholicism and accepted
n'trines by their baptism and con
firmation in the faith.
The church was crowded with friends
and relatives of those confirmed, and hy
people from all parts of the city. Repre
tlve priests from the various par
were present and occupied seats in
Xhf sanctuary. Row Fathers Younan and
Wyman assisted the Archbishop in ad
ministering the sacrament.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 27, 1898.
KILLED IN A
DRUNKEN ROW
Thos. Grady Was Beaten
to Death.
HIS COMPANIONS SUSPECTED
A BROTHER OF THE DEAD MAN
MAY BE THE SLAYER.
Three Men Went on a Spree and
One of Them Was Injured
So Severely That He
Died.
As a result of a drunken brawl, the
body of Thomas Grady, a teamster, who
lived at 351 Dolores street, is lying at thu
Morgue, and his brother, Patrick Grady ,
and Andrew Sherbridge, companions on
the spree, are detained at the Central
Police Station on suspicion of having
caused the teamster's death.
The three men were arrested early yes
terday morning near the corner of Dolores
and Nineteenth streets and booked at thu
Seventeenth-street Station for drunk.
Soon after the arrest Thomas Grady com
plained of being ill, and was removed to
the City and County Hospital, where he
died within a short time. Dr. Treuholt/,
of the hospital, informed the Coroner that
he thought the death due to unnatural
i :u:s t -s and asked permission to hold au
autopsy. His request was granted, anu
t<> his surprise he found that two or
Grady's ribs were broken and his Hvei
ruptured. The body was removed to the
Mcryue and the police notified that thert.
had probably been foul play.
Patrick Grady and Shtrbridge were
botft placed undrr arrest in the morning
vhen it was kurned that Thomas Grady
hud 'lied an<l were looked in the "tanks'"
at the central station. They will not be
charged until an investigation can be
held. When Patrick Grady was taken to
the station on the charge of drunk he
had in his possession a picket from a
fence and the police are working on the
theory that this was the implement which
inflicted the injuries resulting in the
death of the mau's brother. Officer Slat
tery has been detailed on the case and it
is believed that the investigation will
prove that the man was injured by his
brother during a drunken quarrel.
Mrs. Kate Silvey, a sister of the Grady
brothers, called at the Coroner's office
before the death had been reported and
Inquired if her brother was there. She
told the officials that Grady had been on
a sprr-e for over a week and that she
thought something might have happened
to him. After the body had been taken
to the morgue Mrs. Silvey paid a second
visit and then told that on Saturday
night her two brothers had been to her
home at 531 Dolores to visit her. A can
of beer was brought in and while drink
ing this the brothers became engaged In
a quarrel. They left the house together
and it was some time afterward that they
were arrested for being drunk. The quar
rel started at the home or Mrs. Silvey
was probably continued on the street and
ended in th-- blows which caused Thomas
Grady'a death.

THE MISFITS
FROM STOCKTON
They Play Miserably and
Lose.
SUPERB PLAY OF FRISCOS
PERINE'S PITCHING WAS THE
FEATURE.
The Stocktons by Their Snail-Like
Movements Make the Game
Very Uninteresting to
the Spectators.
BY JOE CORBETT.
The San Franclscos unmercifully wal
loped Manager Campbell's collection of
iilsflts at Recreation Park yesterday by
Ihe score of 10 to 8. The game, owing to
the fact that Mr. Whalen, who has been j
pitching such good ball of late was |
scheduled to do the twirling, was ex
pected to be a good one, yet developed
Into about the poorest exhibition of the
national game that haa taken place this
in in the vicinity of Eighth and Har
rison streets. It was one of those long,
uninteresting affairs which start badly
and end in the same manner. About the
only redeeming feature noticeable was
the excellent playing of the home team.
They, as usual, presented a patched-up
appearance, yet ihf change improved I
rather than demoralized them, Mr. Collins !
particularly distinguishing himself by his \
clever all-around work, as did also Mr.
Sheenan. However, the team continues
to show lack of management, anu no j
doubt will very shortly he patched up in
Bthat department, for rumor has It that
Mr. Coffroth is going to resign, which
means that Hunker will take complete
control. There is not the semblance of a
doubt but that the club under one Indi
vidual will gradually fight its way to the |
tnp. especially when this gentleman is
popular and liked by his players. Out-
Eide of Mr. Shea's twirling not a fault
could V-e found in the whole make-up,
and this gentleman cannot be expected [
to pitch good ball all the time. He did |
equally a.- well as his opponent during his
brief stay, and no doubt would have Im
proved if permitted to continue. Mr. Ham
mond's judgment, however, was perfectly
correct when he retired Mr. Shea for his
successor, a Mr. Perlne, who acted his
part nobly. But one hit was made off
him during the eight innings he labored,
v. r.-.(ird any pitcher should feel proud of.
There was Quite a contrast between his
efforts and those of Mr. Whalen's. The
latter phenom was hammered all over the
lot, and the support accorded him was
vile. Really, I hardy believe a team could i
do worse- if it tried. They are also a j
lazy collection of players and move about I
Just as they play. It took one hour and â 
fifty minutes to finish the contest, and
the loss of time was due principally to the j
snail-like movements or those misfits, i
Among them but one man seemed to en- |
tertain the fact that life was not extinct, !
yet he could hardly cover up the defects i
of the others. Certainly these boys will
have to do better, as the game they put '
up yesterday would not draw a corporal's |
guard. Whoever told Mr. Starkey he
could cover third base must have been
dreaming. Such a tiresome, miserable
game as he put up has not been seen since
the Friscos had their parade, and it would '
be well for him to seek a position in the ;
outfield. The story of how the game was
won is told in a few words. The Friscos j
hit Mr. Whalen almost when they pleased, I
ran bases and made but two errors. The
misfits acted as though every move hurt j
them, and played in the same unsatisfac- |
tory manner. Only one safÂ»- hit did they j
is* cure during the entire game, and this
fact, coupled with their niisplays, easily i
lost the game. The score follows:

OAKLAND WHITEWASHED
San Jose's Great Playing De-
feats the Visitors in a
Desperate Contest.
SAN JOSE, June 26. â To-day's game
with Oakland was one of the prettiest
and most exciting ever played In this
city. It was a pitchers' contest in which
honors were evenly divided between
]burK and Russell. San Jose scored In the
lirst and aprain in the third, while Oak
land made nine futile attempts to press a
m;m across the rubber. The game was
replete with brilliant plays, Schmeer's
shortstop work never being equaled here.
Donavan also made several star catches.
San Jose played a phenomenal game
and would have beaten anything on the
map. Oakland made a desperate effort
to score in the ninth. Sullivan was given
a base on balls. Schmeer singled and
Moekiman also walked. With mree men
on bases Donavan came to the bat and
hit for what looked like a three-.bagger,
but McGucken made a sensational catch
and saved the game for San Jose. Com
pany B, United States Volunteers, was
present, it being their last apearance in
public before going away. The proceeds
of the game gn to th*Â» Hod Cross benefit
fund. Two thousand people were in at
attendance. Score:

WIND SPOILS THE
OARSMEN'S SPORT
ONLY TWO RACES SAILED AT EL
CAMPO.
In the First Heat of the Junior Out
rigged Skiffs Two Boats Were
Swamped â Wind and Waves
Were High.
A gusty gale and rough water were the
cause of sore disappointment to a large
number of the admirers of aquatic sports
who attended the Bculling regatta at El
C'ampo yesterday. Notwithstanding the
bad conditions the first heat In the junior
cmrigged skiffs was finally started at
12:50. It had been intended to put four
men Into this heat, but J. Lewis of the
Alameda. Boat Club having scratched in
the second heat. W. Kansen of the same
club was transferred to the second heat,
leaving in the first heat Victor Caglierl
of the Dolphins. 11. Wilder of the Pion
eers and J. Lyons of the South Ends.
Lyons had the outside station, but found
the wind so strong that he came close in
to shore. After the three scullers had
rounded the stake-boat, and were on the
way home, H. Wilder sind J. Lyons
swamped, leaving V. Caglieri to scull
home alone. Time, 19:9.
In the second heat of the junior out
rigged skiffs Conrad Ochs of the Pion
<.''â :>. William Howe of the Ariels and W.
Hansen of the Alamedas started. The
wind was constantly freshening and
swept down upon the water in strong
punts, making it impossible for the scull
ers to steer even moderately straight
courses. With tnuch labor all three men
managed to cross the winning line, the
order being as follows: W. Howe, Ariel
Rowing Club, tirst; Conrad Ochs, Pion
eers, second; W. Hansen, Alnmeda Boat
Cub. third. Time. 18:00. Hansen had the
outside station. The course was one and
a half miles with a turn.
After these two heats It was seen that
it would be practically Impossible to con
tinue the programme, and the races were
postponed until a later date. The first
two men In each preliminary heat are en
titled to row in the iinal heat, but as only
one contestant got over the course in the
first h<Â»at the second place in that heat
remains undecided.
ThÂ« rppratta was held under the auspices of
the Pacific Athletic Association and was In
chare of the regatta committee, consisting of
A. P. Rnthkopf of the Dolphin*. B. ,7. Pem
broke of the Alamedas, J. 1). Mahoney of the
South Ends, J. R. Bookman of the Artels and
William C. Espy of the Pioneers. The acting
officials were as follows: Referee. Al Fritz of
the South Ends; starter. P. J. Enrlght of the
Ariels; marshal, M. J. Calnan of the Pioneers;
assistant marshal, Titus Brown of the Ala
medaÃ; â  timekeepersâ J. Keenan of th.<" Dol
phin?. Al Greenleaf of the Alamcdas, J. El
liott of the Olympics: Judgesâ D. Batteaux
and A. Taylor of the Ariels. A. McGeorse and
John Foley of the South Ends, J. Laib and
Joseph Sullivan of the Dolphins. D. Leahy
Â»nd E. Shea of the Pioneers. G. Miller and

MUNYON'S VIEWS.
He Claim* There Is a Care lor Every
Disease).
Professor Munyon. says that good health
Is essential to the accomplishment of good
â¢work. No matter how ambitious or how
pure or lofty one's, ideas may be, if dis-
ease is sapping our vitality and attracting
the thoughts to bodily aliments, we shall
not be able to render our loved ones and
eoelety that great sympathy and assistance
they have a right to expect of us. If you
are ailing your first duty Is to get -well.
I believe there is a cure for erery disease.
I have fifty-seven different cures for flfty-
seven different ailments. Science will some
day discover the others.
Munyon guarantees that his Rheumatism
Cure will cure nearly all cases of rheuma-
tism In a few hour's: that his Dyspepsia
Cure will cure Indigestion and oil stomach
troubles; .that bis Kidney Cure Will oure
90 per cent, of all cases of kidney trouble;
that his Catarrh Cure will cure catarrh, no
matter how long standing; that his Head-
ache Cure will cure any kind of headache
In a few minutes; that his Cold Cure will
quickly break up any form of cold, and
so on through the entire list of his reme-
dies.

SUPERVISORS ON TRIAL
GOOD NAME OF A COUNTY RESTS
WITH THEM.
Commercial Men Have Solved a Prob
lem, but Theatrical Managers
Are a Long Way Behind
the Times.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 26.
It has always seemed to give pleasure
to some peoplo to represent Oakland as a
hive in which all the bees were always
quarreling and where no honey was made.
"While in a measure this idea may not be
altogether misleading, there are occa
sions upon which every one in this city
can unite. Such an evasion Is the Fourth
of July. No matter what business, social
or religious rivalries may exist in this
city, and they do exist generously, they
are all burled for twenty-four hours once
a year. At this time there is more energy
being shown by truly representative men
In preparing for a great patriotic demon
stration than has ever been known. These
men have taken hold of the project in
such a manner as to guarantee its suc
cess. They are men of pride, personally
and commercially, and they realize that
on this occasion they have to fulfill every
promise and every anticipation or else
Join the big majority of those who have
attempted such affairs and failed.
So far as it is possible to Judge, there Is
no lack of public support for these men
who Intend to prove that Oakland can
unite when the occasion is something that
strikes deeper than bolts of cloth or the
tenets of any particular creed. In a word,
Oakland is really patriotic. Her many
cliques may fight over all manner of
trifles, and they do fight over the most
trifling of trifles, but the red and white
Ftripes and the little white stars on the
blue ground produce the same feeling and
the same effect on all, and consequently
the railers at Oakland's occasional bick
erings must be quiet at this time and
must admit that there Is hope for the
future, for where real earnest patriotism
is manifest other qualities, though per
haps clouded, are certainly not far away.
This city has undertaken a new kind
of contract which it will be expected to
carry out within the next few months.
It has pledged itself to the United States
army officials that a military camp lo
cated here will find a more healthful
moral atmosphere than is to be found in
military reservations across the bay.
When Colonel Carrington was asked yes
terday if he thought the Oakland camp
would be better for the boys because of
their freedom from temptation, he re
plied: "That is the great reason which
brought us here."
This implies a great deal. It has long
been Oakland's boast that she has been
free from the pernicious temptations that
openly assail the youth in San Fran
cisco. Whether this character has been
deserved or not, has long been debatable,
because it is well known that although
much Is hidden in this city, vices .exist
under cover with as large a capacity to
demoralize as though thny were In the
open. There !s no doubt that with a few
thousand soldiers camped at Sather there
will be an attempt made to surround the
boys with Just those dens which have so
rapidly grown up around the camp at the
Bay District. Sather is outside the limits
of the city of Oakland, but it is In the
power of the Supervisors to grant as
many permits for liquor licenses as they
please, and owing to the few residents in
the neighborhood, it would be impossible
to obtain a requisite number of signers
to a protest. In consequence, the whole
matter is left to the discretion of the Su
pervisors, and with them Oakland must
perforce trust Its good name in this mat
ter.
There are generally supposed to be bfc
twpen seventy and a hundred thousand
people living along thia side of the bay
shore. Those who undertake to supply
this large amount of people wl*h the ne
cessities of life and amusement are al
ways complaining that there is but llt
tle Inducement to show enterprise on this
side while AlanifHlans persist in patroniz
ing San Francisco. This argument is as
Filly as it is false. After several years'
experience I am forcfil to believe that
the people of this county do their busi
ness on this side the bay to just such an
extent as they are encouraged to do so.
Some years ago the dry goods merchants
undertook to keep trade at home. They
enlarged their stores, took on new lines
of goods, brought everything thoroughly
up to date, sent their own agents East
and to Europe, and for a long time Oak
land" has hnu dry goods stnreF fully equal
to the finest across the bay and quite as
capable of supplying goods at the same
favorable prices. There have even been
Instances in which San Francisans have
done their purchasing In this line in Oak
land.
This enterprise was followed recently
by the hardware men, and it Is generally
believed that in the course of five years
at the farthest no trade will cross the
bay from this side.
It Is a generally accepted theory that
purchasers will spend their money where
they obtain their amusement. If this be
,-. [.plied to Oakland, It forecasts a dark
filture, for If ever a city was woefully
larking in enterprise regarding the estab

lishment of permanent amusements, this
is that city.
A few years ago Oakland built a beau
tiful playhouse. Ten thousand dollars
was contributed by the public as a bonus
to start the enterprise. The. Macdonough
is justly credited with being one of the
best appointed theaters in the country.
But it Is only on an average of once a
week throughout the year that its doors
are open. During the past month it has
been practically closed all the time. This
Is probably the fault of both the theater
management and the public. Theater
going is largely a habit and it is impossi
ble to cultivate a habit sufficient to make
it profitable by opening a theater once or
twice a month. The management com
plains that when a good attraction is
presented there is no audience and the
people complain that the theater is not
open and presenting good attractions all
the time. It surely is not unreasonable
to suppose that Oakland and all the sur
! rounding towns can support at least
i one good theater, but either the habit
must be encouraged to stay here, or the
play-goers will patronize San Francisco.
There is no other first-class amusement
1 house on this side of the bay. and only
i one cheap theater, which Is also closed.
This leaves absolutely no place for any
! body to go who seeks amusement. As a
result, after becoming tired of trying to
find their amusement in Oakland, they
are actually driven to San Francisco for
lack of anything Â£*Â»sÂ£Â»â  gere.^

SONS OF TEMPERANCE MEET.
A Stirring Address by the Rev. J. W.
Webb of Fresno.
BERKELEY. June 26.â The Berkeley
division of the Sons of Temperance held
a mass meeting this afternoon in the First
Baptist Church on Allston way. The oc
casion was a welcome to the Rev. J. W.
Webb, the temperance orator of Fresno.
Mr. Webb'is en route to Canada to take
part In the Prohibition campaign there. In
the course of an interesting address he
said temperance work was now being
done under Gladstone's maxim â that it is
the duty of government to make It as
ea&y as possible for its subjects to do
right and hard as possible to do wrong.
He advocated active political campaign
work and thf organization of temperance
clubs, which he declared accomplish more
for the cause than the churches.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 27, 1898.
HE HEALS
BY PRAYER
Dr. Francis, Oakland's
New Sensation.
THE LAME ROSE AND WALKED
W. TAYLOR THREW AWAY HIS
STICK AND DANCED.
Rarely Are Heard Such Players
as Those Offered by
the Patriarchal
Healer.
OAKLAND, June 26.â Dr. F. W. Fran
cis, the divine healer who figured at the
healing of Mrs. Carrie Judd Montgomery,
opened a. mission in a large tent at Four
teenth street and Broadway to-night.
The Unt was crowded, but the results
were somewhat of a disappointment. The
healer is a forceful, magnetic speaker of
great power, highly educated and of Eng
lish descent.
There is mystery surrounding "Dr.
Francis." He declares that this is not his
right distinction, but that he is descend
ed from the French and English aristoc
racy. He has long articles from Eastern
newspapers applauding his wonderful
qualities and he frequently asserts, dur
ing his powerful addresses, that he de
sires not to be known, as it would ham
per him in his work, "which is solely that
of God."
The healer frequently aroused the fer
â \or of his audience and some of the most
enthusiastic yelled 'Hallelujah" and
"Amen." He has certainly started a new
sensation that bids fair to equal the no
torious excitement of the Woodworth
mission years ago.
After the address the maimed and halt,
deaf and blind were Invited to the front
and a few were treated. A well known
broom maker, W. Taylor, walked on the
platform with the aid of a stick and after
a fervent prayer jumped up and twisted
himself around and ran off the stage
while the crowd murmured approval.
A woman took a lad about 10 years of
age on the platform and told the healer
that he had been subject to epileptic fits,
some times as many as a dozen a day,
for years. As the patriarchal healer, with
fiu wing white beard, embraced the lad ana
called on the Almighty in a loud voice,
to heed his prayer, and on every parent
to join his petition, the large audience
was spell bound. The scene was inspir
ing and really grand. Rarely are suon
prayers heard, and the weeping mother
took her boy away with the healer's as
surance that he would certainly be
cured. A few cases of total deafness in
women were declared to be relieved and
the patients testified that they coulu
hear. Â»
"Dr. Francis* said that to-night was
merely a beginning and that he can curs
200 cases a night. He refuses any kind
of consideration and says he is fed by the
hand of God;

SUES FOR PEACE
WARRING CHURCH MEN HAVE
SHAKEN HANDS.
The Actor Parson Asked His Late
Congregation for Their Good
Wishes and the Holy Kiss
Was Exchanged.
OAKLAND, June 26.â The olive branch
of peace again waves over the Central
Christian Church. Rev. Edwards Davis
and the oflioers and congregation and
Rev. Dr. Sawyer have all shaken hands,
exchanged the holy kiss and are now
friends. At the regular service to-night
Rev. Davis read the following letter and
when he had finished the Incident that
commenced at Durrant's execution when
the pastor's name was coupled with red
wine, was declared to be closed.
OAKLAND. June 22. IS9B.
To the Officers of the Central Christian
Churchâ : Your solicitous request has
after due consideration occasioned my d?sir>
to meet with you the first Lord's day service of

sistent â¢with the teachings of the New Testa
ment to the end that a full fellowship may
he perfected. At the time of the action of the
officers the existing circumstances were such
as to make their decision wholly Justifiable, but
now It would be inconsistent with the compre
hensive lev: of any one pretending to be a dis
ciple of Jesus Christ to withhold forgiveness
when pardon is asked. With absolute honest y
I confess I hold no ill-will toward any officer
or member of the church, and pray that am
nesty anil charity may characterize all ou>
lives to the result that our own souls may be
beautified and thnt the souls of others may be
constrained to yield to the omnipotent love of
Jesus. It is my ardent hope that a spirit of
love will be a balm to every severed Action
and that the "Central" may bring forth rich

The Nineteenth Century David.
Rev. W. E. Dugan, pastor of the Stew
art Presbyterian Church, took for the
subject of his address at last night's ser
1 vices, "Dewey the Ninetenth Century
David." He paid In part:
A glance at the victory of Dewey and
his relation to this Government and the
times reveals some analogies between
him and David. The threatening attitude
of the PhiliÃtlnes resembles the haughty
daring of the Spaniards, and the signal
victory of Dewey reminds us of David's
victory over the giant of Goth. David
was chosen to fight the battle because
no one else was available. Perhaps If
Dewey had not been at Hongkong ho
would not have been chosen to meet thÂ«
enemy at Manila. But as God raised up
David to deliver Israel of the Philistines,
bo he named Dewey from a child for
the battle of Manila, and his Providence
sent him to the Far East long before man
dreamed of war with Spain. Dewey and
David alike represented the armies of the
Lord, and were brought to their respec
tive places by the plan of God for the
extension of the Lord's kingdom. Dewey's
victory in the East has done more for
missions and civilization than the com
bined efforts of missions could do. His
victory has broken the Jaw of the Red
Dragon and sent him reeling to his den
of slime. Dewey's victory, like David's,
broke the backbone of the war. The one*
bold, haughty Madrid Is now about to
gxop on her knees to plead In humble
petition for peace. She does not like the
taste of her bread buttered with Ameri
can bullets. American dynamite In her
erownj makes her head reel In frenzy.
Her cron sword has slajn her in the hand
of the nineteenth century David.

Water.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, June 26.â Two more
steamships intended for the Yukon
River trade have been almost totally
disabled. They are the Staghound and
the Gamecock, which left Portland on
Friday for the north, in tow of the
steamer Elihu Thompson. "When eight
hours out at sea both small steamships
foundered and became waterlogged,
with two feet of water on their main
decks and the upter works badly bat
tered by the action of the waves. These
steamships are now practically worth
less.
On the decks of the vessels were
loads of cordwood and Oregon fir. These
acted as a life buoy, keeping the water
logged steamships from sinking to the
bottom. There was also on the yes-
sels $10,000 worth of merchandise and
stores, which are almost a total loss.
On board were seventy-five persons,
members of the crews and employes
of the Yukon Transportation and Com
mercial Company, which owend the
craft. No lives were lost, as the men
were all transferred to the Thompson
and taken to Astoria,
The steamships had just been com
pleted at Portland, coating about $45,000
each, and when laden drew about 33
inches of water. They were Bplendidly
equipped and had a capacity of six
teen knots an hour. William A. Rich
ardson of San Francisco, general man
ager of the company, of which E. E.
Shotwell is president, says the Game
cock and Staghound were insured for
$50,000. The vessels were to have been
operated on the Yukon in connection
with the ocean steamship Humboldt,
which is booked to sail from Seattle
to-morrow for St. Michael.
ASTORIA. June 26.â The wrecking of
the Staghound and the Gamecock is
thus described by Chief Engineer Kelly
of the Elihu Thompson:
"We left the Columbia on Friday
evening with fair weather and a fair
sea. At 10 o'clock Friday night the
Gamecock displayed a red light, as also
did the Staghound, which was the pre
concerted signal of danger. The
Thompsr-n slowed down and waited
for daylight. At break of day they
awakened me, and Captain Garlick told
me to take the small boats and see
what was the trouble. With the sec
ond mate and three men of our crew
I put out for the Gamecock. On ap
proaching her I saw she was In a bad
condition, the oakum streaming out
from her seams. I asked Captain
Fisher what was the trouble, and was
informed that when they struck the
first swell off the Columbia the passen
gers were frightened beyond reason
and the boat commenced to work badly.
"I went on to the Staghound and
found the condition of affairs worse.
The passengers and some of the crew
were Imploring me to take them off.
I told them to keep quiet, as there was
no immediate da.nger. The passengers
were running about the decks like de
mented persons, with their life-pre
servers on and their possessions piled
up in promiscuous heaps. I went back
to the Thompson, and, securing more
boats, returned to the wrecks.
"At this time we were about thirty
miles at soa. Reaching the Gamecock,
we commenced transferring passengers
and crew. Captain Fisher and two or
three men refused to leave their boat.
He had a crew of thirty men and four
teen passengers. The Staghound, in
charge of Captain Lane, had about the
same number of people aboard, and a
few of her men stood by him. refusing
to leave the boat. The others behaved
well, but the passengers on both boats
were like crazy people.
"About this time the pilot schooner
San Jose came up and took the Game
cock in tow, while I took care of the
other boat. All who wanted to be
transferred were safely taken care of
and a few o-f their personal effects were
taken aboard the Thompson. The tow
line and chains remained Intact, and I
attribute the fact of the breaking up
of the boats to their extreme length,
which was 175 feet."
Captain Fisher of the Gamecock had
a trying experience on Friday night.
Even before he signaled us many of
the passengers, most of thpm from Mis
souri and Kansas, who had never be
fore seen the ocean, came to him with
revolvers and threatened to shoot him
if he did not put back to port. Fisher
kept his head and coolly told them to
go to bed and he would take them to
safety, but many of them bothered him
all night. -

YACHTS IN A PIPING BREEZE.
Ihe ,4501 us With Shortened Sail Led the
San Francisco's Fleet Around the Course.
There was a piping breeze off the Sausalito shore yesterday when the pre
paratory signal pun was fired at the San Francisco Yacht Club house at 12:50 p.
m. At 1 p. m. the yachts of Clara i were signaled to start, but there was only
one entry in the doss, G. B. Edgar's sloop Sapho, which crossed the starting
line 8 minutes and 28 seconds after 1 o'clock. At 1:10 p. m. the signal gun for
yachts of Class " was fired, and nearly three minutes afterward A. D. Naylor's
sloop Twilight .rossci ;h.- line. E. N. Walter's sloop Embla and Frank Bartlett's
Jueen, though entered in this class, did not start. Just before the strating
gun at 1:20 p. m., tor yachts .it" (".ass .'!. Ooniniodore Dr. T. L. Hill's sloop Cygnus
carried away her jib halyard and failed to cross the starting line; however, she
und t lie course. Nine seconds after the starting pun Commodore
Carl Westerfeld'a Aeolus crossed the line, followed by A. Sutherland's sloop
Catherine. Aeolus came in first, making the best time over the course and fin
ishing ahead of all boats in the rirst three classes. Her time for the two rounds
was 2 hours 0 minutes and 42 seconds.
In Class -i there wore eight entries, but only five crossed the line. J. A. Breitz
mann's sloop Cupid winning the class flag and G. turn gilden's sloop Regina the set

STATE TROOPS
DECIMATED
Small Remnant of the
Old Guard Left.
3RDER FOR PARADE JULY 4
FUTURE OF THE ARMED FORCE
OF CALIFORNIA.
Captain D. A. Smith, After a Disap
pointment, Obtains a Commis
sion in the New Volun
teer Regiment.
The National Guard of the State of
California is now but a very small rep
resentation of what it was before the
Drenking out of the war with Spain. The
Irawing from it of the companies of the
First Infantry, a portion of the Seoond,
Fifth and Sixth Infantry and the entire
Seventh Infantry, together with part of
;he Naval Militia, has decimated its
ranks so that now there remains very
lew men who can claim the name of Na
.lonal Guardsmen. One of the officers at
jivision headquarters said a few days
llnce, in talking of the guard: "A man
Rrho belongs to the armed force of the
Btate of California at this time should
feel proud. There are plenty of volun
teers, but there are only a few of the old
fuard. '
In San Francisco there remains but
Troop A, Cavalry, the greater portion ot
the Signal Corps of the Second Brigade,
j. portion of the Naval Militia and the
Lowell High School Cadets.
Throughout the State, outside of San
Francisco, there are two companies 01
the Second Infantry, two companies of
the Fifth Infantry and one of the Sixth
Infantry, part of the Slernal f'nrps of the
First Brigade at Sacramento, part of the
Third Sipnal <'<>n>s located at Los An
reles, Troop B at Sacramento, Troop C at
Salinas and part of the Naval Militia at
Ban Diego, Santa Cruz and at Eureka.
ORDERS TO PARADE.
The following was issued from division
nvnlquarters on Saturday:
Pursuant to orders from superior headquar
ters, dated Sacramento, June 24, 1808, the Na
tional Guard of the State of California will
jarade In their respective localities on Mnn
lay. July 4 I&9S. in celebration of the one
nundred and twenty-second anniversary of
American Independence.
Parade reports of the respective commands.
Â»o parading, will be forwarded to division
jeadquarterÃ, in duplicate, not later than
ruly 15.
FUTURE OF THE GUARD.
The future of the National Guard of
this State Is still problematic and will
remain so for some time to come, as it Is
probable that no action will be taken
until after the mustering in of the new
regiment of volunteers from the guard.
One of the most serious obstacles at this
time in the matter of reorganization Is
the lack of material with which to equip
organizations if it were decided to re-es
tablish all or some of the regiments.
Each of the regiments and battalions
that have been mustered in have taken
with them the property of the State, for
which the United States Government has
given due credit, and it leaves the State
without arms or uniforms. And then
there is no fund upon which to draw,
with which to re-habilitate the skeleton
regiments which remain. It is thought
that the whole matter will rest in abey
ance until the meeting of the next Legis
lature when steps will then be taken to
have an almost entirely new guard. At
I >f vision Headquarters applications are
still coming in from individuals who are
anxious to become part of the armed
force of the State. There are enough of
these applications on hand now to fill
nearly all the vacancies in the rank and
file but the applicants will have to wait
for' some ttme until it is determined what
will ultimately bo done with them.
PERSONAL NOTES.
Captain D. A. Smith, for a number of
years regimental adjutant of the Fifth
Regiment Infantry, after waiting a long
time for a commission and having met
with one disappointment, has bad his
ambition satisfied at !nst. At the time
the First California Volunteers were in
camp at the Presidio it was understood
that the First Regiment of the National
Guard would be accepted as it was of
ficered. When it went into, camp com
missions were issued to all officers except
two. One of these was inspector of rifle
practice, but some time before the regl
ment received orders to form part of the
first expedition to Manila. Captain Smith
was named to fill that vacancy and his
name was forwarded to Washington Be
fore many hours passed a telegram came
from the War Department directing that
the nomination be "hung up," which was
equal to an announcement that the com
mission would not be issued. Now the
captain has been selected to retain, in the
new formation of volunteers, the position
of regimental adjutant, which he oc
cupied in the Fifth Infantry. On Satur
day he donned his uniform and entered
at once upon the discharge of his duties
The appointment of Sergeant Major
Honlgsberger and Sergeant Major F. E
Hawley have, by general orders No. 4,
been revoked.
THE NAVAL MILITIA.
Last Friday a detachment of twenty
men under command of Lieutenant Gunn
went to Mare Island to renort for duty
on one of the scouting tugs, and a de
tachment under command of Lieutenant
Shaw will report from San Diego at the
same point. Captain Turner, command
ing the militia, is arranging still another de
tachment, which will report at the island.
There are a great many men in the
militia who are much disappointed at the
turn matters have taken in that organi
zation, and they are not slow In declaring
that they have been slighted. It scorns
at this time as If a number of officers
will take steps to sever their connection
with the organization, and quite a num
ber of the f -nlist<vl men have volunteered
In the infantry and artillery In the hope
that they will be sent to the front
John T. McMillan, for many years con
nected with the hydrographlc branch of
fice in the Merchants" Exchange and for
several months instructor of navigation
to the officers of the naval militia, is now
absent from his post, having been or
dered by the- Navy Depnrtment to report
at Mare Tsland for active duty, with rank
of lieutenant, junior grade
The Marion Is still at her berth in
charge of a corporal's guard, but at this
time there Is but little activity on board

LAW OR CUSTOM.
Test Case to Be Made in the Arrest of
M. Reznik, a Butcher.
M. Reznik, who has a butcher shop at
105 C Howard street, was arrested yester
day by Meat Inspector Davis and Police
man Butterworth and booked at the city
prison on a charge of violating one of the
Board of H.-alth ordinances.
Reznik is a killer for Kosher meat and
he is charged with killing a calf only
eight days old. The ordinance makes it
a misdemeanor to kill a calf less than
four weeks old. Reznik was following
the Jewish custom and the Meat Inspec
tor says that the arrest has been made to
test the question as to whether law or
custom will predominate here.

STRANGE
DEATH OF
GEO. READ
Drank Some Steam
Beer and Died.
TWO COMPANIONS SUFFER
NO SOLUTION OF THE MYSTERY
YET OBTAINED.
Dr. Fitzgibbon Says the Symptoms
Indicated Poisoning â Barkeeper
M. W. Morgan in the Tanks
Awaiting Developments.
A panic may be expected along the va
rious steam beer routes of the city to-day
by reason of the strange experience of
three men who indulged freely in the
amber beverage, with the result that one
of them died a rather sudden and violent
death. The other two. Victor Bergdahl
and E. C. Pearce, were very ill for sev
eral hours. The facts of tae fatal affair
make it a strange one, and the actual
cause of Read's death will probably not
be known until an analysis of his stomach
has been made.
Read left his home at 1531 Howard
street after dinner on Saturday evening
and in company with his two friends went
down town, where he purchased some
clothing and the three then went to the
Young Men's Christian Association build-
Ing about 8:30 o'clock and took a swim,
remaining in the tank an hour, actively
exercising.
On leaving the place the men leisurely
walked homeward. Pearce says they did
not stop on the way either to drink or eat
until they arrived at the New York
Saloon on the northeast corner of How
nrd and Eleventh streets. They entered
and began shaking dice for beer. After
imbibing seven or eight glasses Read was
taken with sudden nausea. Bergdahl and
Pearce were soon attacked in the same
manner, and the trio finally started for
their homes, which are in that section of
thf> city. They were deathly sick and
made slow progress, but managed to
reach Read's residence, where they sat
down on the steps, hoping to gradually re
cover. The illness continued and the un
fortunate young man at last left his com
panions and went upstairs, saying he
must go to bed. His mother met him
when Be came in and remarked upon his
being out so late. He acknowledged the
fact and retired after taking some pills
calculated to settle his stomach.
Later in the night his parents were
aroused by in the young man's
room and* found him unconscious and
apparently in great distress. In less than
an hour the unfortunate man died with
out regaining consciousness.
Pearce accompanied Bergdahl to his
home at 17i! Thirteenth street, and suc
ceeded in dragging himself to his own
aljode, where he was again attacked with
severe nausea. About 3 o'clock he was
notified of Read's death, and after call
ing at the house of the deceased went to
the Receiving Hospital for treatment. He
was a very sick man for a number of
hours, but was able to go home later In
the day, after making a statement of
facts to the police. Bergdahl also went
tn the hospital for treatment and told the
Fame story.
M. W. Morgan, the barkeeper who
served tin 2 b^er. was arrested and identi
fied by Pearce and Bergdahl, after which
he was placed in the tanks.
Morgan says he knows nothing of thÂ«
queer case except that he drew several
rounds of beer for the men. drank some
himself, and served it to others. A sam
ple of the beer was taken for analysis.
Notwithstanding the suspicious circum
stances, the assistant barkeeper. J. P.
Enright, was drinking be^r from the
same keg yesterday afternoon to con
vince customers and" others that there was
no poison in It.
John Read, father of the deceased says
he was not addicted to drink, was a man
of exemplary habits and excellent healtn.
He could offer no explanation of the
mystery, but thought his son's death
might have been caused by the buTStlnn
of a blood vessel through violent exercise
In the bath. Read was 22 years old and
had been employed from boyhood in Gar
ratt's foundry as a molder.
For some unexplained reason Bergdahj
gave the fictitious name of "Henry Wli-
Bon," and deceived the police as to inn
residence. He is an employe of the Aux
iliary Fire Alarm Company. Pearce is
employed by the Pacific Can Company.
Dr. Fitzgfbbon. of the Receiving Hos
pital, who attended the two men, says
the symptoms indicated poison, but of
what nature could not be determined until
an analysis of the beer and the stomach
of Read had been made.
WILL LECTURE IN
HUMANITY'S NAME
SERIES TO BE GIVEN BY THE
RED CROSS SOCIETY.
Rev. William Rader Speaks on the
Subject of "Women and Their
Influence on War."
Under the direction of Mrs. Wendell
Enpton, chairman of the Nurses' Com
mittee of the Red Cross Society, a series
of Important and practical lectures is be
ing arranged for the purpose of instruc
tion in practical work In the field. The
lending physicians of San Francisco are
co-operating fully in the work and will
aid the movement in every, way.
Dr. R. Beverly Cole, the oldest member
of the International Red Cross Society
on the Coast, has been of special aid to
the ladies In organizing this extensive
plan and through his efforts the courte
sies of the different medical institutions
of the city will be tendered to the society,
among them the medical department of
the University of California, the Cooper
Medical College, City Receiving Hospital
and the personal pervlce and time of
many of the physicians.
Applications for the course should be
sent at once to Mrs. Wendell Easton,
chairman of the Committee of Nurses,
Red Cross Society, Spreckels building.
General Merritt and the medical de
partment of the Manila expedition fully
indorse the movement, realizing the im
portance of the work in preparing a
strong corps of skilled nurses for the
emergencies which will arise at Manila,
as in addition to the results of actual war
fare will be the ravages of disease from
the transfer of thousands of our troops
to a tropical climate.
An interesting and Instructive lecture
was delivered to the ladies of the Red
Cross Society last evening by Rev. Wil
liam Rader at the Third Congregational
church. In the course of his remarks on
woman's influence in times of war, the
speaker said:
"There are several distinct types of wo
men. First, the women we can only speak
of in shame â the vultures of the war.
These women, who are lost, a shame to
their sex and a blast of calumny to their
country, do more harm in time of wir
than the deadly shot and shell. The sen
timentalist without sense Is another class
which the soldier laughs at, yet craves
sympathy, and another is the woman
who does earnest religious work in camp
without regarding the soldiers as pagans.
The last and best Is the self-sacrificing,
devoted mother."
Found Dead in Bed.
J. T. Taylor, a telegraph operator, was
found dead in his bed at 501 Post street
yesterday morning. Consumption was the
cause of his death. The body was re
moved to the Morgue.
The body of a man named Corcoran was
found dead in bed in the Linden House
at the corner of Howard and Sixth
streets yesterday morning; The Coroner
was notified and removed the body to the
Morgue. Nothing is known of the cause
of his death. An autopsy will be held.

never before was there such uncertainty
as during the running off of the two
stakes. Money flowed in and out of the
six betting stands like water from a
sieve. Everyone wanted to bet and only
succeeded after forcing himself to the
front.
Although a biting cold day the popular
park was crowded with followers of the
popular sport. The odds offered during
the day were large and inviting. When
Rosette went out she was a 16 to 1 favor
ite over Jesse Moore and the "Bookies"
Dearly had heart disease when the short
ender set the pace for her more speedy
rival and began to turn the hare
In all directions. Rosette, however,
.showed her mettle by jumping to the
front and scored enough points to land
the flag. Theron also had a narrow escape.
She was an 8 to 1 favorite over Tessie
Fair and only managed to win out by a
narrow margin. False Flatterer whs
picked as the winner of the all-age stake
and might have landed it but for the lung
courses .she experienced. She received
her setback in the semi-final round.
Thornhill was fresh and strong and did
the trick after a grueling course.
The decision of Judge Bull was ques
tioned by many when he gave False Flat
terer a victory over Bendalong. The lat
ter dog showed improved form and gave
the English dog a hard rub. It looked
very much like Bendalong's race, as he
set the pace and did most of the work.
False Flatterer's fast finish may have
decided the judge in his favor.
Commodore and Thornhill competed in
the final round of the stake and the bet
ting favored the former dog, owing to the
easy courses she ran. Thornhill, how- !
ever, downed her In a long run and landed i
the purse.
In the puppy stake Wait a Little and i
Liberty Bell keeled over every dog they i
met and competed in the final." A speedy
hare was let louse and both does tore
after it in full tilt. First one led then
the other, making a grand race. The
prey was quickly overtaken and began to !
turn in an effort to escape with Wait a I
Little close up. She held the lead un- I
til the hare was killed and won the stake.
Following is the way the dogs ran:

TROOPS MARCH TO THE SHIPS.
FLEET AWAITS SIGNAL TO SAIL
MAY SAIL AT NOON TO=DAY.
Three transports of the third Manila expedition â Indiana, Mor
gan City and Ohio â are in the stream ready to sail, and they will be
joined to-day by the City of Para and the Valencia. No orders
were issued up to a late hour last night changing the time of the
sailing of the fleet, which was set for to-day, and it is probable the
vessels will get under way about noon.
The Newport will sail on Wednesday.
AGAIX have the streets of San I
Francisco echoed with the tramp I
of armed hosts moving to the
front, and again the populace
has been called upon to bid fare
well to eons, brothers or sweethearts,
for union- the men who went forth to
battle yesterday were hundreds of the
youth of the Golden City who have
Joined the regular organizations.
While thf scenes that marked the de
parture of the first flotilla bearing to
the < ']d World the first offering <>f San
Francisco to the nation were not du
plicated, the manifestations were far
more fervent than those which gTeeted
the members of the second expedition
as they marched to their transports.
Then there was shown merely that
patriotic fervor untinctured with that
Btronger feeling of kinship which made
the cheers of yest> rday tremble in the
throats of the multitudes and tug at
the heartstrings.
The glow of the new born Sabbath
was still struggling to pierce the thick
pray canopy that swept in from the
ocean when the vanguard of the army
of sightseers invaded Camp Merritt.
But early as it was all was bustle in
the quarters Â« f the Idaho, the Wyom
ing, the Minnesota and the regular
troops. Tn some of the latter, notably
the Eighteenth and Twenty-third In
fantry, the wall tents of those corn-
SOLDIERS SAID FAREWELL, THEN MARCHED ABOARD THE TRANSPORTS
panics selected for the third expedi
tion had been taken down and packed
the night before, and in their stead
Btood the tiny shelter tents â looking for i
all the world like a fairy ramp. In ;
the others the canvas still remained In
place, but all other camp equipage i
was packed and ready for transporta- I
tion. The men had breakfasted long â ,
before, and aside from puttinar the fin- |
ishing touches to their knapsacks and
haversacks, were ready for the signal
which would send the fragile homesj
lettering to the ground.
Thicker grew the fog with the aging
of the morning, and each minute added
to the crowds. The spirits of the ones
who deemed themselves fortunate in
being selected for the expedition grew
in proportion while a corresponding de
pression seized those who were to re
main behind, which was not lightened
perceptibly by the half-taunting Jests
of the others. Guard mount at 9 o'clock
furnished ' -'ef diversion f thecrcwds,
but that was soon over, and then came
a dreary, shivering wait of two hours.
Now and then the noteÃ of a bugle
would penetrate the somber canopy,
and the cry would go up that tin
troops were moving, but they con
tinued in their places until the appoint
ed hour. When, finally, they did start
there was a rush of soldiers and civil
ians. The boys in blue who must wait
yet awhile before ihey can hope for
deeds of valor forgot their envy and
led the cheering as each battalion
Bwung out of First avenue into Point
Lobos, and cast a most regretful fare
veil glance at Camp Merritt.
The bands ' -Â°& their liveliest quick
steps, the soldiers stepped proudly and
Jubilantly, and accompanied by a
shouting mob of people, reeled off block
after block without sign of fatigue un
til the heart of the city was reached.
Van Ness and Golden Gate avenues
and Market street were filled as they
seldom have been filled before. Flags
waved in countless thousands, while the
cheering was as continuous as the
roar of battlr\
Each command had its following
â which trudged patriotically on to the
Mail dock, to Pacific-street wharf or
Lombard street, according to the desti
nation* of the troops, and not content
choked East street for hours, and only
abstained from overflowing 1 the docks
through the efforts of the police.
With the exception of the Valencia,
all the transports were ready to receive
their passengers, and the troops em
barked with little delay as compared
with previous embarkations, though
ample tim* was given the men to par
take of the farewell hospitality of the
Red Cross Society.
FOLDED THEIR TENTS
AND MARCHED AWAY
The Third Detachment of Troops
Leaves Camp and Embarks
on the Transports.
In accordance with the orders Issued
on Saturday afternoon by Major ileneral
Otis the third expedition to Manila
marched from Camp Blerritt at 11 o'clock
yesterday morning. In the blue column
that so proudly tramped away to the
cheers of their comrades and the music
of the bands were nearly 4-Â»>" brave men.
The scenes of the departure of the troops
yesterday were the same as those attend
ant upon the leaving of the second ex
pedition, with the exception that all of
the baggage was gotten away from camp
in advance of the men, and that the
camps were policed and put in good con
dition by the soldiers before they left.
It was exactly 8 o'clock when the troops
to leave, began to break camp, and a
half an hour later the tents were all
down, rolled up and loaded on the wagons
along with the other baggago.
Just a quarter of an hour before the
time set for the troops to march the as
sembly began to sound and the men
quickly fell into ranks. The two bat
talions of the Idlaho troops were the first
to get away. At their head rode their
white-haired chief Colonel Jones. Be
hind the colonel rode Major Met lonville,
commanding the second battalion.
The Thirteenth Minnesota Regiment,
with Colonel Reeve and his stan; at its
head, and with its band awakening the
echoes of the crowd by its martial strains
and its colors waving proudly in the
morning breeze, was the next to file from
its camp and take up the line of march.
I 'own First avenue they went amid a
thunder of good bys and farewells. They
marched iike veterans. They looked like
veterans. No wonder those "boys are the
pride of their State.
Major Foote was next to lead that
brave but little band of warriors that
hails from Wyoming. They followed the
Thirteenth Minnesota, and there was
something about the way they marched
and in the look upon their faces that
seemed to say that they would be in at
th<- tinisb. Brigadier General Otis and
Governor Richards of Wyoming also ac
companied the battalion. They rode with
Major Foote at the head of the men.
The battalion of the Twenty-third In
fantry, under Colonel Ovenstnne, came
down Third avenue and then turned into
Point Ix>bos. They were warmly cheered
all along the line as they marched from
camp, and time and time again Colonel
Ovenshine was forced tosaiute the crowd,
so true and genuine were the manifesta
tions of high r< gard for the ofllcers and
men of the Twenty-third. The Signal
Corps and the Corps of Engineers were
the last to leave <'amp Merritt, but they
were accorded as enthusiastic a send-off
as any of the troops that had preceeded
them.
Along Point L,obos avenue they marched
'tween lines of cheering thousands, colors
flashing and kerchiefs waving from every
window and housetop, a rain of blossoma
and a wealth of heartfelt Kood-bys.
Across by Centrnl Rvenue to the hard,
smooth pavement of Post street, down to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 27, 1898.
Webster, across town and out to Market
by Golden Gate avenue they found their
way, each step taking them farther from
the shales aaid uneasy sands of Rich
mond aril nearer to the boats in the seaâ
their hope by day and their dreams by
night through all the weeks that they
have spent in camp.
From Golden Gate avenue to Third
street Market Btreet traffic was at a
standstill. The dense crowd 'that had
gathered blocked the roadway and side
walks save the narrow strip down whicn
the soldiers marched. It was a big-heart
ed and spontaneous farewell; a piedge.
that these boys who had come into
Western hospitality, strangers, were go
ing beyond its reach as friends, and thai
they will be watched and waited for with
ail the fervor of the fresher ties.
At Third and Market the different com
mands separated and marched to their
respective boats, the Mlnnesotans filed
dr.'.vn Third street to the Mail dock, and
the Idaho, Wyoming and regular detarn
ments continued on to the ferry, where
they wheeled to the right or to the left to
the boats that had been de-signaled to
carry them.
FILED QUIETLY ABOARD.
Idaho's Volunteers and Two
Battalions of Regulars on
the Transports.
The first troops of the third Manila ex
pedition t<> reach the Pacific-street whan
-lay to go on board the transports
Morgan City and Indiana were the two
battalions of the First Idaho Volunteers.
It was about 12:30 p. in. when they
reached the grates of the dock, and it was
with some difficulty that the police cleared
the way through the dense crowd for
thrm to enter the building. Forming
into singie Hie each company passed up
the Morgan City's gangway, and soon all
of the Idaho men were on board. In the
course of an hour every man was as
signed to his bunk, and releasing them
selves from the sixty-pound knapsacks
they scattered about the vessel to take
a r.pr after their hard walk from Camp
MÂ» rritt over the rough stone pavements.
Thej were soon followed by a detach
ment of recruits for the First Nebraska
Regiment, now on the way to Manila with
the second expedition. This made up the
complement of the Morgan City. All the
men were marched on board promptly
and systematically, and in good order.
The same methods were pursued with
equal su< cess In embarking the men on
the [ndiana, to which w< re assigned one
battalion of the Eighteenth United state;,
Infantry, one battalion of the Twenty
third United States Infantry, the signal
corps and .1 detachment of engineers.
The quarters of the men are very con
itly arranged, anil in all probability,
barring some little seasickness, they will
have a pleasant voyage. All the troops
assigned to the Morgan City and the ln
dlana were on board by 2 o'clock.
The signal corps, consisting of iifty-fivÂ«
men, presented a line appearance as they
went on shipboard, and it was evident
that Major Thompson, who is in com
mand and was closely observing them,
was very proud of the showing that they
made. They are well equipped, and are
armed with the best carbines. After
reaching Manila they are to be provided
with horse?. This signal corps is mostly
made up of expert telegraph operators
and electricians, and arc all young ana
with intelligence far above the aver
age.
The ladies of the Red Cross were 011
hand well prepared for their work, al
though they did not learn until quite late
in the morning that the men were to em
bark on Sunday. When this fact be
came known, however, there was a lively
hustling along the llnf-. and detachments
of the Red Cross reached the docks in
time to serve the men with lunches and
coffee, which were greatly appreciated.
Those lunches were all home made, and
were put up in separate paper packagi s,
and consisted of two meat sandwiches,
a hard-boiled egg, cheese, cakes ana
doughnuts, and an orange or an appln.
St. Luke's Episcopal Church sent 1200
sandwiches; the First Presbyterian, 1000;
Temple Emanu-El, 1200, and San Rafael,
500. Mrs. Robert McKenzie arid assist
ants had charge of the Morgan City, and
Mrs. George Buckingham and Mrs. L. F.
Monteagle and assistants attended to the
wants of the troops on the Indiana.
The ladies of the Red Cross presented
to each soldier a pencil and a postal card
with which to write a farewell message.
Each soldier was also handed a fan, and
a useful little folder giving hints in the
caro of the health in the tropics.
Brigadier General Mac Arthur, com
manding this expedition, sails on the In
diana, which, therefore, is the flagship
of the fleet. This morning General vac-
Arthur will call on Major General Merriti
to receive his final instructions and sail
ing orders.
It is the intention to have the fleet sail
to-day.
ABOARD THE PARA.
Minnesota Soldiers File Aboard
the Transport and Make
Themselves at Home.
At the Mail dock the City of Para waa
not ready to go Into the stream when the
soldiers marched aboard. Saturday night
orders were given to Captain Zeeder to
have steam up and be ready to drop into
the stream at noon on Monday. Yester
day orders were given to get steam up at
once, and the firemen were promptly set
to work. It takes from fourteen to eight
een hours to get steam on the City of
Para, so it would be late last night or
early to-day before she could move from
her dock.
An enormous crowd followed the Min
nesota boys to the Mail Company's
wharf. At the gate, however, they met
with disappointment. The troops nmrch
ed in on the wharf, but a line of police
barred the people out. There was some
hooting, but the. crowd soon settled down
to a patient wait, hoping that when the
soldiers were aboard the transport they
would be allowed down the wharf to get
a last look at them. In this they were
again disappointed, as it was fen red that
a croud on the wharf would cause
trouble.
It was a jolly crowd withal, and many
of them got into rowboats and small
launches and thus made their way by
water to the wharf and gained one more
chance of calling "goud-by" to their
friends on the troop ship. There were no
heart breaking partings as there were on
the occasion of the sailing of the City of
Peking, and the only tears that were
shed were by .^irls who saw the last of
their week-old lovers.
When the soldiers pot down to the
wharf they found that the ship's galleys
were in the same condition as the en
gine rooms. The men were not expected,
and In consequence there were no fires
in the ranges and r.o dinner ready. The
camp cooks got to work, however, and
it did not take them long to prepare a
makeshift meal for the hungry soldiers.
A GAP IN THE CAMP.
The Departure of the Troops
Leaves Several Vacant
Squares in the
Tented Field.
The departure of the third expedition
to Manila from Camp Merritt yesterday
left quite a gap in the fleld of tents. The

the most persistent patriot that has ap
plied for enlistment. When his present
company left Leak, S. Dak., he followed
them either on foot or per box car to
Sioux Falls, where he arrived too late for
enlistment. The troops came West, and
wandering Barr, not having anything
but a strong inclination to enlist, again
took the cellar berth of a freight train,
and after many vicissitudes made his
way to the coast.
He arrived just in time to fill the place
in South Dakota's already full ranks of
one of the privates who was detailed for
hospital duty in the regular service.

Last evening George Knmrumpel, of
Company C, Twenty-third .Infantry, was
taken off the Indiana, as it was discovered
thut he was sick with the measles. He
was conveyed to the Harbor Hospital.
DEATH IS SIMPLY
AS ONE VIEWS IT
THE TEACHINGS OF TRUE ODD
FELLOWSHIP.
Friday Night Lodges Eulogize the
Departed â Veteran Association
at the Ceremonies.
Under the auspices of the San Fran
cisco, Apollo and Sargent Lodges, known
as the "Friday Night Lodges," and the
Veteran Odd Fellows' Association, a me
morial service was held in the main hall
of the Odd Fellows' building yesterday
afternoon. There was a fair attendance,
but two unlocked for events diminished
the attendance â the funeral of a member
of the Patriarchs Militant, Cnnton No. 5,
and the absence of more than one hun
dred soldier Odd Fellows who were or
dered to embark on transport ships yes
terday.
After an organ prelude, James Linforth.
P. G., of San Francisco Lodge, opened
the exercises with a brief address in
which he said that the services to be
held were not in the nature of a funeral
event over those who had passed away
in the preceding year, but rather a ser
vice of praise.
After a prayer by Rev. J. N. Beard,
D. D., "Come Ye Disconsolate" was ren
dered by a quartet, after which Past
Grand Master George H. Morrison ad
dressed the assemblage.
He said that for seventy-nine years the
order of Odd Fellowship has been en
gaged in a great work which included
not only the offering of relief, the minis
tration to the sick and the burial of the
dead, but that it had engaged in the
building up of character not only in this
country, but over the entire civilized
world, for wherever there is civilization
Odd Fellowship is known. Shakespeare,
he said, had declared that whatever there
is of good or of ill, Is that wnich you
make it, and so it is with Death, it is
how you view it. The order, said the
speaker teaches that there is no death,
but that it is a sleep, a rest and all shall
rise again, and under that teaching Odd
Fellowship does not look upon death In
a somber light. He then asked why there
should bo sadness because one in this
world, after a long struggle in which he
accomplished good, had. in the fullness
of his days, gone to rest. He thought
that instead there should be rejoicing in
the thought that that one had gone to
sleep, and, as the order teaches, to awak
en and live again in a better world.
This was followed by the singing of
"Angels Ever Bright and Fair," after
which F. A. Jennings, noble grand of No.
3 delivered the eulogies on Robert G.
Kelly, Baldwin Gardner, P. G. ; Oliver B.
Oakley and James Rogers; George Wal
com, P. G. of the lodge, delivered those
on John Haman and J. w. Dodge; James
Linforth. P. G.. those on John A. Smith
and John Ed Cline. P. G.; A. P. Black,
P. G.. on A. F. Knorp. P. G., and Will
iam Davis on Shelah C. "Walker, P. G.
The Knickerbocker quartet then ren
dered "Oh. Where Shall Rest Be Found."
H. W. Patrick of No. 123 being the musical
director.
\y. l-\ Noreross. P. G., then spoke the
eulogies on the following nam^d deceased
members of Apollo Lodge; Joseph Getz,
V G.: William Elliott Miller. Frederick
W. Myer, P. G. ; Henry Lewis King. P. G. ;
William George Gaskins. Fred H. Stanle,
P G â¢ Raymond Ashley Diver, Thomas B.
Holt Edward Fanning Clark. Peter Eric
Schu'ltzberg.
The quartet sang "Rock of Ages, after
which George W. Dixon, P. G., delivered
the eulogy on J. W. Smith of Sargent
Lodge which was followed by the sing
ing of "Shall We Meet Beyond the River"
by the four voices. George H. Morrison,
vice-president of the Veteran Odd Fel
lows, spoke of the deceased members of
that organisation, who were T. J. Robi
<?on W. H. Gardner. Joseph Peirce, John
S Souther. Max Wolfer. J. Henry Apple
gate Fred K. Krauth. Frank Perkins.
The exercises closed with the singing
of "Good Night. I Am Going Home" by
the quartet, the chanting of the hymn
"Abide With Me" by the audience and the
pronouncing of the benediction by Rev.
J. N. Beard. D.D.
SOLDIERS AT SUTSO BATHS.
Aquatic Sports Witnessed by Thou
sands â Chilly Bay at the Park.
Owing to the wind and tog vcstcr-lay
the crowds at the park and on the beach
were not as large as usual. Sheltered
pleasure resorts were unusually popular
in consequence and the attendance at the
Chutes, the Cliff House and Sutra's Baths
was much larger than was expected. The
fact that the weather was inclement was
deplored by the lovers of music and those
who enjoy a day out in the open, but con
ditions could not be altered.
The largest crowd of spectators of the
season visited the baths to witness the
aquatic sports of the soldiers. The races
were very close and exciting and the high
diving made a great hit with the crowd.
â Washington and California volunteers'
races were the most Interesting and fin
ally when they had reached the highest
point of the baths the referee decided to
call it a dead heat between George Wink
ler of Washington and D. le Rue of the
Beventh Regiment of California.
In the fifty-yard race H. Bain of the
Nevada Volunteers was first and C. E.
Stewart second. In the long diving or
undcr-water swimming contest G. Bandy
of the Washington Volunteers was first
and Lee Quint of the same regiment was
second. In the seventy-five-yard race N.
Griffin was first and < . Gord second. In
the 100-yard race of the Fourteenth In
fantry L. Thompson was first and Joe
Lawler second.

Monteith Was Misquoted.
Editor Call: I am quoted In your papei
as saying that the two planks in the
Populist platform should be "smash the
Railroad Commission" and "direct l^Kis

say to your representative was: "Smash
the railroad machine and secure direct
legislation." In other words, I meant that
the issue should be localized and relate
solely to State and not national Issues,
and that by destroying the political ma
chine of the railroad and securing to
the people the power to exercise direct
