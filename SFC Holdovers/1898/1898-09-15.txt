VOLUME LXXXIV.^NO 107.
The San Francisco Call
ON THIS EVIDENCE MRS. BOTKIN WILL BE TRIED
FOR many days Chief Lees has
thrown about the B.r.kin case all the
mystery possible. When people have
ventured to wonder on what he
based the assumption that the pris
oner was guilty he has Intimated that all
would be made plain when the affidavits
he had been securing were made public.
These affidavits are now given out.
It can hardly be said, although, or
course the court ia the proper tribunal for
deciding the matter, that the affidavits
are convincing. On the contrary, some of
them are Irrelevant, others vague. The
statements of the girls supposed to be
concerned In the sale of the candy. are
wavering and uncertain, and neither of
the â¢'salesladies" makes mere than a dis
tant approach to an attempt at Identifi
cation. The statement of Dunning him
self is brief and indefinite, setting forth
some facts about Mrs. Botkin, but not
affirming, as expected, that she wrote the
superscription on the box containing the
poisoned sweets.
There is a showing that Mrs. Botkin
bought arsenic at an earlier date then the
purchase of the drug at the Owl Drug
Store, but this could be construed in her
favor rather than against her, tending as
it does to establish that she had a habit
of purchasing this poison. Chief Lees
puts In a lengthy affidavit of his own
tending to make clear the relations be
tween Dunning and Mrs. Botkin, concern
ing which there has been no contention.
Altogether, considering what had been
promised, the affidavits will be regarded
as a disappointment. To the lay mind, at
1 least, they do not seem to have made clear
' the guilt of Mrs. Botkin or even to have
so strongly suggested it as to explain why
she should be held a prisoner. The most
; explicit in the lot is the affidavit of Mrs.
Botkin in which she accounts for her
every movement during the time the po
l lice "suppose her to have been carrying
out the plan of murder. However, the va
: riouÃ affidavits or the substance of them
may be found In print, and in each reader
there inheres the right to weigh them ac
cording to unbiased judgment.
To an unprejudiced mind the most dam
i aging evidence against Mrs. Botkin is the
I similarity in the exemplars of her known
I handwriting with that of the anonymous
letters ar.c superscriptions on the box.
Kxpert K>tka has attained remarkable
succeu in" preparing for the prosecution
the many photographic exhibits that the
case has "required.

JOSEPHINE BATEMAN.
State of Delaware, Kent County.
John B. Pennington deposes and says:
That he Is a resident of the town of Dover,
county and State aforesaid, and has been for 44
years. That his family formerly consisted of
himself and wife, Joshua D. Deane and Ida H.
Deane, his wife, and Leila Deane, their daugh
ter, and for two years last past Mrs. John P.
Dunning and her daughter, Mary E. Dunning,
and since June 30, IS9S. Harry Q. Pennington,
his grandson. That on the evening of August
9. 1898, about 6:30 o'clock, as he was passing
out the front door of his dwelling;, his two
daughters, Mrs. Joshua D. Deane and Mrs.
John P. Dunning, were sitting on the front
pÂ«rch with Leila Deane, Harry C. Pennincton
and little Mary E. Dunning with some others
whom he did not particularly notice standing
around. Mrs. Dunning had 1n her hand a box
of candy open and said to him, "Oh. papa, see
what a present I have got and I don't know
who It came from," at the same time aÃking
him to take a piece of the candy, which for
aim' 1 cause, he does not now remember, he de
clined. He passed over to the county building
and did not return until about 9 o'clock,, and
saw nor heard no more in reference to the
candy up to that time. The family all re
tired and some time between 12 and 2 o'clock
In the night he heard his daughter,
Mrs. Joshua D. Deane, In the hnll
way near his bedroom wretchlng and
vomiting and her husband. Joshua D.
Deane, talking to her. He went to sleep and
heard no more until next morning. He aro=e
about 7 o'clock and learned from his wife that
Mrs. John P. Dunning had also been wretchlng
and vomiting the latter part of the nlpht. He
then visited his daughters' rooms and found
both of them very sick. In the meantime Mr.
Deane had called in the family physician. Dr.
Bishop. The physician remained In attendance
upon both of them almost continually, but
they continued to grow worse and at about 5
o'clock In the afternoon of the 11th of August
Mrs. Deane died, and on the evening of the
12th of August Mrs. Dunning also died. Some
time In the morning of the 12th of August he
inquired of Mrs. Dunning where the box of
candy and the wrapper which she had received
from Harry were and from information ob
tained from her he went to the secretary in
the back parlor and took the box and wrapper
from off the secretary. fpon seeing the ad
dress on wrapper he thought he recognized It
as belnÂ«r similar to the address on a letter
addressed to Mrs. John P. Dunnlnsr. Dover,
Delaware, and postmarked San Francisco,
which he had In his office, and which he had
taken from his private box in the Postofflce
about one year ago, and which he had not de
livered to Mrs. Dunning because of her special
request, she having received anonymous let
ters addressed to her and postmarked San
Francisco, which she had shown and read to
him. and requested that if others came that
he should not deliver them to her. but do with
them as he thought best; hence It was that
he had this letter in his office. The address on
the wrapper around the box of candy made
such an impression on his mind of Its simil
arity to the address on the letter In his office
that he folded up the wrapper and went with
It Immediately to his office and compared it
with the address on the letter. He was sat
isfied that both addresses were written by the
same person. He took the wrapper back to his
house and wrapped It around the box contain
ing the candy and locked it In the bureau
drawer, from which place they were not taken
except*: a permit Dr. Bishop to take therefrom
a few pieces to take to the State chemist. Dr.
Wolf at Newark. Delaware, for analysis, and
again while the jury of inquisition was consid
ering the case the Coroner and Walter Morris,
one of the Jurors of Inquest, received from him
the box and contents and wrapper, which they
returned In about one hour thereafter, when he
locked them up again In the bureau drawer,
whÂ»re they remained until he took them out
on the 22d day of August and handed them to
Bernard J. McVey. State detective.

State of Delaware. Kent County.
Lemuel A H. Bishop deposes and says: That
he Is a practicing physician, 45 years of age,
and has practiced medicine in the town of Do
ver and State of Delaware for 22 years past;
that on the morning of the 10th of August last
about 8 o'clock he was called by Joshua D.
Deane to see his wife, Ida H. Deane, and her
daughter Leila Deane, Mrs. John P. Dunning
and Harry Pennington. all of them residing in
the same house: when he arrived he found the
aforesaid partlos all 111; he learned that Mrs.
Deane had been ill all night vomiting and
purging, and with slight pains though not se
vere ones In the stomach; Leila Deane and
Harry C. Pennington were not taken 111 till
the early morning; he was Informed by Mrs.
Dunn'ng and Mrs. Deane that they had eaten
corn fritters and fish for their supper the pre
vious evening, which made them sick; he
treated them for cholera, morbus for several
hours using the usual remedle* for cholera,
morbus, but they did not yield to the treat
ment: Just before noon of the same day he
was informed that they had all eaten candy
from a box which was received by Mrs. Dun
ning the previous evening: he also learned by
inquiry that all those who ate of the candy
PRICE FIVE CENTS.2
were ill. while all those who ate the same sup
per and did not eat the candy were not ill,
and he concluded from that circumstance that
there was some noxious principle In the candy.
Mrs. Dunning would not retain any medicine
given her during that day longer than five or
ten minutes. In the afternoon, seeing that
they already had gastro-enteritls, I began the
use *f demulcent drinks, white of the egg,
acacia water with ice, etc., but could not re
lieve vomiting until after m/dnight of the same
day. After that time they both continued to
take nourishment, all of which was retained
until they died.. Mrs. Deane died at about 4:30
I>. m. August 11 anil Mrs. Dunning at about
5:45 p. m. August 12. As soon as I discovered
ili.tt there was gastroenteritis set up, I knew
there was some local pOtCOD that had produced
such a condition. From the .symptoms and
condition of the two patents 1 know they
rame to their death by poison. On the morn
ing of August I,', John B. i'ei.nington gave me
five pieces of chocolate covered candy, which
he took from a box which h<Â» had locked in a
bureau drawer In his residence; that he saw
him unlock a drawer and take therefrom a box
and that he (this affiant) took the five pieces
from the box; that this affiant placed the five
pieces of candy in another box and delivered
the box and candy to Dr. T. R. Wolf, State
Chemist at Newark, Del., on the same day.

him to make an analysis of the same for the
purpose of determining whether It contained
poison of any character, but more particularly
as to whether it contained arsenic; that he re
ceived the candy and upon making the usual

Extradition Is asked for Adelaide C. Bot
kln. otherwise called Ada Botkin, otherwise
called Cordelia Botkln, and the proposed agent
for this State is Bernard J. McVey. In my
opinion the ends of public justice require that
the alleged criminal be brought to this State
for trial at the public expense.
I believe we have sufficient evidence to secure
the conviction of the fugitive. The person
named as agent Is the proper person and has
no private Interest in the arrest of the fugi
tive. The fugitive is now under criminal ar
rest in the State of California and city of
Pan Francisco. This application Is not made
for the purpose of enforcing the collection of
a debt or for any private prurpose whatever
and if the requisition applied for be granted
the criminal proceeding shall not be used for
any of said objects. The crime with which
she is charged of having here committed is
murder of Elizabeth Dunning, and our statute
fixing the punishment for the same is chap
ter IS7. page 823. revised code of the State
of Delaware, punishmentâ death. The crime
charged to have been committed In this State
was on the 9th day of August, IR9<*

MRS. BOTKIN'S
STATEMENT
The Story Told Chief Lees by
the Prisoner at the Time
of Her Arrest.
In the affidavits of Chief Lees is incor
porated the .statement made to him by
Mrs. Botkln, in which she detailed her
movements at about the time the poisoned
candy was sent from this city up to the
time of her arrest. The statement of the
prisoner is' as follows:
I left San Francisco on the evening of the
17th of July by boat for Stockton and arrived
the next morning early, July 28. I remained
in Stockton until the 3Cth of July, having had
a doctor attending me all the time. I was
there from having taken cold and going on the
boat. (To Chief Lees) : You can get the doc
tor's address in Stockton. I arrived here in
San Francisco the night of the 30th of July.
After I arrived here I called in Dr. Tyrrell and
I was sick Sunday and Monday. I wo* ill on
the 31et of July and on the Ist and 2d of Au
fust, Monday and Tuesday, respectively. On
ueeday. August 2, I packed up at the Hotel
Victoria and placed my things in the large
corridor, that fc the 2d of August. On thl> 3d
I rested In the forenoon and In the afternoon
I visited a friend, a Mrs. Carter, at the Went
worth on BuÃh street, between Powell and
Stockton, and spent the afternoon there. I re
turned home and had my dinner. This was
\Vednesday, the 3d. In the forenoon of the 4th
of August, I think, I finished up some little
; things and packed my small portmanteau, be
; cause I was nut going to have my trunk at St.
I Helena, but It was going on to Healdsburg,
after stopping at the sanitarium, as I told you.
I did not go out until I packed my portmanteau
and took the train fur St. Helena. I left here
on the afternoon train, the time, I think, was
S^ somethingâ went out at the invitation of M.
C. McClure, my brother-in-law, and remained
there the balance of the 4th of August and
then left there, St. Helena, on Sunday, the 7th
of August, and went to my sister's and drove
across country thirty-five miles In her car
riage to my plster's in Healdsburg. I
arrived at Healdsburg at 3 o'clock on
Sunday afternoon, the 7th of August, then the
following Sunday, the 14th, I picked up the
Examiner and found an hcrount of the deadly
tragedy, the death of Mre. Deane and Mrs.
Dunning.
Q. (To the Chief by Mrs. Botkin). Shall I
say of having read the article to my stster?
A. Yes, If you wish. I read the article to my
sister In absolute consternation (to Mrs. Mo
'"lure); that was Sunday afternoon, August 4.
Q. (By Mrs. Botkin to the Chief). Shall I
say to you how I passed the remainder of the
afternoon?
The Chiefâ Answer just as you please.
A. We went through the afternoon In the
regular routine household work. On Tuesday,
August 16, Miss Llvtrrnush, sent by the Ex
aminer to interview me, asked me what I knew
about the death of these people at Dover (Mrs.
Deane and Mrs. Dunning). I said I knew noth
ing, as I never knew Mrs. Dunning nor Mrs.
Deane. On the morning of Wednesday, the
17th, she came again to my sister's at Healds
burg and informed me that the Examiner said
that I was very strongly suspected of this
crime. After pulling myself up from the shock
I took the next morning's train to my husband
in Stockton. This Examiner reporter insisted
upon accompanying me. She did accompany
me and said she was doing so out of the must
extreme heartfeii sympathy, thereby leaving
my sister in a more comfortable frame of mind
than if I had gone alene. I wired my husband
to meet me at the train, which he did. We
went to the hotel with my husband and re
mained there until to-day (Wednesday) .or
rather until last night, but remained In Stock
ton up to the 24th (to-day). I was arrested on
the night of the 23d of August, and came to
San Francisco on the morning of the 24th, ac
companied by my husband and officers. (To
the Chief)â And you know where I am now.
Q. (By Chief Lees). When was the last time
you purchased candy? A. The last time I pur
chased candy Was about the Ist of last June,
at 1 o'clock, when I bought some lemon drops
for my nephew, who was visiting me.
Q. Where did you buy It? A. I bought it as
we were taking the car to go to Camp Merritt
from a man with a box who sold chewing
gum. I bought 10 cents' wonh of lemon drops
and save them to Charlie.
Q. Have you read a description of this bnx
that was sa!d to have been sent to Dover,
Delaware, to Mrs. Dunning? A. I have read
what the papers say.
Q. That It was a 'white-glazed one-pound box
tied with a Pinkish ribbon? A. I do not re
member the description the paper gave.
<J. That there was a handkerchief Inside, a
white cambric one with a price mark, 25 cents,
containing three kinds of candles. I will read
from the paper (reading): The box Is a stock
box (one held in stock) and contains the words
"bon bons" printed on top. i lnterrupting) I
see. The chief (continuing). The candy was
of three kinds: "Chocolate caramels. "whl<>h
were evidently purchased at the store, choco
late bonbons, which were evidently purchased
the same way, and cream chocolates, which
might have been home-made. The candy was
of a medium grade."
Q. Did you ever purchase such a box or
manufacture such a box? A. Never
Q. Did you ever mail to Mrs. J. p. Dunning
of Dover, Del., such a box containing the can
dies heretofore named? A. I never did.
Q. Did you direct in your handwriting the
box or the note which was placed Inside of it?
A. I never did.
Q. Did you place a cheap pocket handkerchief
Inside the box? A. I never did.
(Chief reading from paper: "The postmark
on the package containing the candy may be
San Francisco. That the poisoning" was the
work of a woman there Is no doubt, and friends
uf the family who are in a "nMtion to knew
the suspicion say the authorities had better
look for the woman in the case. The writing
on the Inside of the box and the wrapper to
the box Is the writing of a woman, but whether
they were written by the same person cannot
be decided. The appearances indicate that
they were. The note on the Inside looks like
a stupid attempt to disguise the handwriting,
while the writing on the outside of the box ap
pears like a natural hand.
Q. Henrlng the above read to you, did you
prepare and mall a box such as I have read to
you? A. So help me God, no.
Q. You know that Mrs. Dunning and Mrs.
Deane are dead, don't you? A. From what the
papers say.
Q. You know that they died at Dover, Del.?
A. Prom what the papers say.
Q. Do you know that the package was re
ceived at Dover, Del., on the 9th of August,
18S*S? A. As the Dajiers say.
Q. Are you aware that that package must
have been mailed upon the 4th day of August
BELIEVES HE SOLD THE POISON.
David Green, in an Affidavit, Gives the Police
Some New Testimony..
State of California-
City and County of San Francisco.
David Green, being first duly sworn, on his oath deposes and pays: My
name is David Green. I reside at 722 Franklin street in the city and coun
ty of San Francisco, State of California. My occupation is that of drug
clerk for Mr. Gleason on the southeast corner of Clay and Kearny streets
In this city and county. During the months of May and June, 189S, I was
employed at the Star Drug Store at 1002 Market street, this city and coun
ty. In the latter part of May, or the first or second week in June, a woman
came to the Star Drug Store, where 1 was employed, and asked me' for
arsenic. I sold her about 25 cents' worth in crystals and lumps, some large
and some small. When I sold it to her I asked her what she wanted it for.
She said she wanted it for bleaching straw and the fact that she wartted
it for the purpose she mentioned brought the occasion back to my memory.
I asked her how she used it, and she said she would dissolve the arsenic in
water and soak the straw in It. She was in the store about five minutes
walking up and down, talking all the time. She said something about the
Owl Drug Store, which I do not remember. She either said they would not
sell it to her there, or she had been in the habit of getting it there I
made no entry of the sale of the arsenic. When I sold it there was no
sale-book of poisons kept in the store. It was kept on tagrs in the rear of
the store whenever there was a record kept.
I have seen Mrs. Cordelia Botkln, the woman under arrest charged
with the murders of Mrs. Elizabeth Dunning and Mrs. Ida H. Deane, and
in build and general bearing she resembles the woman to whom I sold the
arsenic at the time mentioned and to the best of my impression and recol
lection she is the same woman. DAVID GREEN
to have reached Dover when it did? A. Not
without calculating.
(By the Chief). It would tako five and one
half days.
Q. A package from here to Dover, Del.,
would have to be mailed at least on the 4th
of August to reach Dover, Del., on the after
noon of August 9? A. I suppose bo.
Q. That was the day, August 4, 'you left the
city? A. I left the city August 4; I was in
the city four or five daye previous' to this. I
left on the afternoon train for St. Helena,
3 something, I think.
Q. Up to that time you had been In San
Francisco four or five dayo previous? A. I re
mained from the 30th of July, or rather I re
turned from Stockton the evening of the SOth
of July and remained here until the 4th of
August. I took my things on the 2d of Au
gust out at the Hotel Victoria, California and
Hyde streets. Having had Â«â¢. doctor I rested
the 3d of August and left the 4th. I visited Mrs.
Carter on the afternoon of the 3d on Bush
street, between Stockton and Powell.
Q. Have you said all you wanted to in rela
tion to the receipt of this box or package at
Dover, this package of candy, containing a
cheap handkerchief, containing a note signed
Mrs. C. ? I will read a better description of it.
(Mrs. Botkln. Interrupting) Tou asked me
these questions preceding this article, and I
can assure you I have said all I possibly can
on the subject. I know no more. Please read
that last answer to me (turning to Heyne
man). Reads. Mrs. Botkln: Thank you,
that Is correct.
The Chief treading)â The box le of white
glazed variety, Is oblong In shape (designat
ing) and made to hold a pound of candy.
Around the ends are narrow pink satin rib
bons tied in a bow knot, and on the top In
gold letters are the words "bonbons." The
wrapper Is of the common light-brown kind
and is in no way of the variety usually in use
by confectioners. There are four or five cent
stamps and one 2-cent stamp on the wrapper,
on but one of which Is the cancellation mark
legible. The address is evidently written with
a cramped hand or with an effort at disguise.
Within the box was a common plain white
handkerchief, with the price mark, 25 cents,
still In one corner. The note written Mrs. C.
is written on ruled white paper in lead pen
cil and the words "with love to yourself and
baby" are written jerkily and in an entirely
different hand from the superscription, very
like a woman's hand. There are three kinds
of chocolate candy in the box, one hard and
similar to a confectioner's make, the other
soft, with every appearance of being home
made. The impression of Dr. Bishop is that
thej?olson will be found in the latter kind.
Q. Now this Mrs. Botkln, I want to ask
you, after having read the above description,
if you purchased. If you packed, if you ad
dressed or if you placed the handkerchief and
note In that package and if you placed four
6-cent stamps and one 2-cent stamp and if
you mailed that package In San Francisco or
any other point in this Ptate to Mrs. J. P.
Dunning at Dover, Del., the wife of J. P.

DUNNING'S NOTES
TO MRS. BOTKIN
Chief Lees Incorporates "My
Dear Ada" Letters With
His Deposition.
The "My Dear Ada" letters written by
John P. DunnlnK to Mrs. Botkin while
he was at the seat of war, are Incorpora
ted In the deposition of Chief of Police
I. W. Lees. In the deposition Chief Leea
gives a list of all the evidence which has
come into his possession.
The Dunning letters were found In Mrs.
Botkln's trunk. The letters follow:
KEY WEST, Fla.. April 14. 1898.
My Dear Ada: I suppose you have Judged
by the papers that I have left Havana: we
had to get out. I arrived here three days ago.
The town Is full of correspondents and navai
officers and tho only thing one hears Is war.
I don't ses how war can be avoided now, and
all that is worrying nic is how I am suing to
ace It. I am doing my best to set on the flag
ship New York, but it looks as if the Navy
Department would not allow any one to accom
pany the fleet when it leaves here. It has beÂ«n
my ambition for years to be on a man-of-war
In action and I am willing to risk everything
to get there this time. So far as the - â
Spaniards are concerned I don't think it will
take us long to settle them. I hope you have
sent me a letter addressed to Key West. If
any of your recent letters have gone to Ha
vana I don't know when, I will get them. You
had better send everything to the Hotel Key
West, Key West, Fla. If I leave here I will
?;lve orders about having mall forwarded. This
b going to be a very short letter, but It Is the
best 1 can do now and it is sent to let you
know I am alive and well and want to hear
from you, and I hope with all my heart that
everything Is well with you. "J."
PORT ANTONIO. Jamaica,, May 30, 189g.
Dear Ada: I have been on the high seas in
a tugboat chasing Spaniards and American
fleets for ten days paat, having left Key West
suddenly. We put Into thie place, which is
a British possession, for coal two days ago, in
tending to leave right away und return to the
American fleet off the southern coast of Cuba,
but we tell up against the British Government
and a British man-of-war here good and hard.
They would not let us buy any coal here,
claiming they would be violating the neutrality
laws in doing so, as they claimed we were con
nected with the United States navy. They tied
us up here for two days without coal, during
which time we made very vigorous kicks,
finally the Governor General of the island re
lented and told us we could have all the coal
we wanted. We are taking it aboard now and
me piling it all over the deck, so that we will
have enough to last a week or so. We are go
ing to leave here In an hour or two and try
and find the fleet again off Cuba, ac there
seems every possibility of a fight with the
Spanish fleet any minute, provided the Ameri
cans can find the Spaniards, which they
have not be*n able to do up to date. 1 have
got the war fever bad and am out for gore.
The name of the b.nt I am on is the Dandy,
and Khe is one of the A. S. S. V. Press boats.
so that If you see anything in the papers about
her you will know 1 am there. I have no idea
when I will get back to Key West. I sup
poEe there are one or two letters waiting there
I'nr me from you. I am very well and have
gained over ten pounds since I started into
this war racket. With my love. "J."
MARCH 16.
Dear Ada: I have been too much rushed for
the last few days to send you evÂ»n a line. I
am now on my way by train from New York
t<> Key West, and will take the steamer from
the latter place for Cuba. I will reach Ha
vana Saturday morning, March 19. My ad
dress will be Hotel Ingeltarra, Havana, Cuba.
You must understand that the chances are
ninety-nine in a hundred that all incoming
letters to Havana are opened by the Spanish
authorities there, so please be very careful
ami do not write anything relating to the
l T nlted State-Spain controversy or I will prob
ably never get them. I learned this in New
V <rk. I have been treated most kindly by the
New York papers which I represent and they
have practically assured me that I shall have
a nice position when I return to New York;
that will probably be my permanent home
when I get back. I am going to try with all
my power to live down the past with all its
sorrows and if anything arises in Cuba to give
me a chance to do something I believe that
my future Is assured. God grant that every
thing is well with you. I want to hear from
you. â  "J."
POUT ANTONIO, June 16.
Dean Ada: . Please excuae the typewriter,
but l ,4iave one handy and urin use it to let
you know that up to date I anl all right. 1
hate not 'written Â»'yt>u for a week or two for
I have been ashore- very little In that time
and had no opportunity to mall letters. I
have not had a letter from a soul for a month
and don't know how I am going to get one,
for I can't tell whether I will be In this part
of the world a week or four or five months,
though it Is beginning to look like the latter.
When you get tfils I wish you would address
a line to me and let me know if you are all
right. Send It to me as follows: On steamer
Dandy, care of Tlchfleld Hotel, Port Antonio,
Jamaica. I may get it or I may not. Anyhow
I will like to hear from you. I have spent
most of the last week over at Guantanamo,
Cuba, forty miles east of Santiago, on the
southeastern coast of the Island. There are
600 American marines there and there has been
a small fight nearly every day. I have slept
in trenches and rifle pits at the American
camp and have had a glorious time listening
to bullets whistling over my. head. These
Spaniards cannot hit the side of a house. We
are expecting the troops from the United
States dally and when they come I may follow
them into Cuba or remain on the boat to see
the naval end of the fight. I can't tell you
Just yet what will be my plan.', I never felt
better in my life and I think' I am In my
element, though I get as dirty as a pig on
the old boat and knocking about around camp.
I had nil my hair taken off yesterday and
look like a singed cat. I have not been able
to do as much for my paper as I would like,
as the nrltlsh" cable facilities in this country
are the worst that can be Imagined and it Is
almost impossible to get anything through.
However, I send what I can and also send
something by mall. I suppose you have seen
some of It if you still get the papers. It Is
hotter than blue blazes and I can't wear any
thing but linen clothes. Don't feel any alarm
about me at nil. I will pull out of this all
right. With my love. "J."
KINGSTON, Jamaica, July 24.
My Dear Ada: I am leaving here to-day for
Porto Rleo, as the campaign at Southeastern
Cuba Is practically closed. As you know by
the papers we have taken Santiago and smash
ed the Spanish fleet, so there Is nothing more
there to conquer. Five of us are going to
Porto Rloo on our yacht "'Wanda." I do not
believe the campaign there will last long and
there v may not be much fighting. After we
take vne place I Buppose the next thing will
be Havana, but we will hardly attack that
before October on account of the climate. I
have ordered my mall forwarded in care of the
United States Consul at St. Thomas, Danish
West Indies, but 1 can't say whether I will
get any there or not, as my movements for
the present are too uncertain. But please ad
dress me there for the present, as it is the only
address I can give now. I know that my let
ters must sÂ»em very few and far between and
very' unsatisfactory, but living In the rush and
excitement that I am la now it If almost im
possible for â me to settle myself at any time
to write any letters. I have not understood
quite onef or two of your recent letters. You
spoke of having come into some kind of a
windfall financially, but did not give any par
ticulars, but God knows If any good fortune
of that kind has befallen you, no one Is any
more glad of It than I am; for myself I can
say that everything seems to be working out
all right. I have seen nearly nil the big
events of the war, Including the destruction or
Cervera's fleet, and the account of the great
affair which you read In the papers was mine.
I am simply Imbued with the war fever and I
can barely put my mind on anything else. I
have gone through all kinds of experiences, sea
fights and land fights,' and have also lived In
that yellow fever camp near Santiago, and I
haven't a scar or a blemish on me yet and
never felt better than I do now. It Is more
healthy In Porto Rico than it is In Cuba and
there Is no danger of oontaglon there. Do not
feel any alarm about me, for I am bound to
come out all right. I do not think I will be on
our dispatch boat much from now on; will prob
ably bo on shore in Porto Rico with the army.
If you could see my make-up you would think
me a dream â tan top boots and riding
breeches, with a broad sombrero and belt and
revolver and all the other paraphernalia of war.
It is a dead hard life I can assure you, with
little to eat beside* hard biscuits and bacon,
but I" am getting fat on it and am enjoying it.
I find myself getting very cold blooded with
constant contact with all kinds of scenes of
war. As a sample of some of my recent ex
ploits I will tell you that a few days ago I
went aboard the wreck of the Vlscaya, one of
the Spanish war vessels that we destroyed on
July S, and cut oft part of the skull of a dead
Spaniard I found on the deck. I wanted It as
a souvenir, but I afterward threw it away, as
it was anything but attar of roses.
God bless you and don't be alarmed If my
letters are infrequent. With my love. "j."

' PONCE, Porto Rico, Saturday, Aug 13 â 
Dear Ada: I have been here about dead to the
world for about two or three weeks, without
any means of getting any mall and very little
chance of sending any away. Just befora I left
Kingston I wrote to you asking you to ad
drees me at St. Thomar but I have never been
there yet, having come here direct and I have
received no mall. We got the news to-day
that peace had been declared and I suppose I
will be going to New YorK soon, but I know
nothing positive about it. I will have to send
you an address when I get to New York, and
you had better not send any more mall to St.

CANDY GIRLS
ARE NOT SURE
Recognize Mrs. BotKin Chiefly
Through \\zr General
Appearance.
Neither Miss Heney nor Miss Dettmer,
the candy girls, recognize Mrs. Botkin
positively as the woman who bought the
candy. Miss Heney says:
I am employed as saleslady at the candy
store of George Haas & Son, 810 Market street.
On Sunday afternoon, the 31st of July. IS9B,
I was on duty In said store and I remember a
ludy coming In about 4 o'clock In the after
noon. She was a lady about 5 feet 1 inch in
height, stout full round build, full round
fleshy face; her complexion was not very light
nor very dark; age about 42 or 43. I think she
wore elthe/ a tan or gray street dress. 1 would
not be sure, but I beleive Fhe wore a dotted
light veil. .She bought a box similar to the 1
box shown me by Chief Lees. It was the
same size and shape, but I cannot remember
as to the shade.
When this lady came In she called for a
fancy box. She said she wanted to see prime
fancy boxes, and I brought her over to the
fancy candy boxes and asked her what size
box, and she told me she wanted a box that
would hold about a pound of candy. I do not
remember whether she had much trouble in
picking one out or not, but she selected and
bought a box similar to the one shown me and
above described. I took it over to the candy
counter to fill It with candy, and she told me
she did not care for any other candies except
chocolate creams. While I was filling up the
box she told me not to fill it (juite full, because
she wanted to put something else Into the box.
I forgot whether she said a present.
Several times she told me to hury up. There
was another young saleslady behind the counter
at the same tirrte, Mlbb Kitty Dettmer, -amd I
called to her to get the tissue paper out for me*
â fci wrap the- fancy tjox In, and &l#o Xhe, ribbon
to tie it up, which she did. 1 remember re
marking to Miss Dettmer at the time that I
had charged only 40 cents for the candy In
stead of 50 cents because the ludy did not want
the box full.
I have examined the candy shown me by
Chief I^ees contained in the box shown me as
aforesaid, which I recognize as chocolate can
dies of the size, shape and manufacture and
sold by George Haas & Son and sold over 4ilÂ»
counter at his store on Market street on Jpty
31, 1898, and they are the Bame style, size and
shape of candles that were put up by me for
the lady, above described, in the box sold to
her on the 31st of July, IX9S. While I was fill
ing it this lady appeared to be in haste, and
several times requested me to hurry up, and
finally when she left the store "she walked
hastily tn the door. She was very active in
her manner and movements.
Being shown the wrapper containing the ad
dress "Mrs. John P. Dunning, Dover, Dela
ware," with four 5 cent and one 2 cent post-,
age stamps thereon canceled, I recognize the
wrapper now shown me as the same character
of paper that was used as an outside wrapper
of a box of candy purchased by the lady as I
have herein stated. It corresponds in color,
texture and lines of folding with that in which
the package was wrapped by me at the time
of sale and delivery.
I have seen Mrs. Botkin now under arrest
on the charge of murdering Mrs. J. P. Dun
ning. Her height, bulk! and manner of car
riage, walking and bodily movement are the
same as the woman who bought the candy of
me on July 31, 1898. I have not had a full view
of her face as to enable me to know whether
I recognize her features, and do not know as I
have sufficient recollection of It to know it if
fully oeen. I have been shown what I recog
nize to be a part of a seal of light color and
printing an was used in the store of George
Haas & Son, and which have been used dur
ing the five or six months last past continuous
ly and was used on the 31st day of July, 1898.
Such seal, to the best of my recollection, be
ing placed on sold box of candy as sold July
31 1?98.
Kitty Dettmer Bald: I am employed as sales
lady in the candy store of George HaaÂ« & Son at
810 Market street. On Sunday afternoon, the 31st
of July, IK9B, I was on duty as saleslady In
said store, and Sylvia Henejr, another sales
lady In the store, was also on duty that after
noon. Betwpen 3 and 4:30 o'clock of the after
noon of that day I rvmember a lady coming
in and Sylvia waiting on her. I did not give
particular attention to the lady, but noticed
that she was shorter and stouter in build than
Sylvia Heney, and as I was waiting on differ
ent customers 1 paid very little attention to
the lady until Sylvia Heney. who had nearly
finished filling a box of candy, turned to me
and asked ma to get the tissue paper for her
for the first wrapper of the box. I had, how
ever, noticed that when Sylvia Heney com
menced the filling of the box she selected can
dles from the rows ot chocolate candles. When
she requested me to get the tissue paper I com
piled with her request and paid no more at
tention to the matter until the woman went
out Sylvia Heney then asked me my opinion
about charging 40 cents for the chocolates, as
the woman did not get the box full, and I said
she did perfectly right. Ac long as the
woman did not get the full pound of choco
late she charged 40 cents. To the best' of my
recollection I heard a remark passed that she
did not want the box filled, as she wanted to
put a amall present In It. I did not see the top
at that time. I have seen Mrs. Botkin, now
under arr*it on the charge of murdering Mrs.
J. P. Dunning. I have no recollection of her
face, but In height, build and walk she re~
sembles the woman who bought the candy
from Sylvia Heney on July 31. 1S98; her move
ment of body and the way in which she car
ries her head are the same as the woman who
bought the candy.
DUNNING KNOWS
HER HANDWRITING
Detective McVey Tells of an
Interview With Him on
the Subject.
Detective Bernard J. McVey, who came
from Delaware as the representative of
that State to take Mrs. Botkln back, if
the request for extradition be granted,
tells of Dunnihg's Identification of Mrs.
Botkln"8 handwriting. The salient points
of his affidavit follow:
On Monday, the 23d day of August, 189S, I
received at the town of Dover from Hon. John
B. Pennlngton, father of Mrs. Elizabeth Dun
ning, deceased, a package containing a box
Inclosing chocolate candies, handkerchtef and
the wrapper. I also received from the Hon. R.
C. White, Attorney General of the State of
Delaware, a note and the writing known as
the anonymous letter and envelope inclosing
the same.
The box and candy and contents were repre
sented to me by Mr. Fenntngton as being the
box and contents received by Mrs. Dunning
through the mall at Dover, Delaware, on the
9th day of August, 1898, and the wrapper was
also represented to me as being the wrapper
containing the stamps and postmark which
surrounded the box, candy and contents re
ceived by Mrs. Dunning on said August ?, 1898.
I am acquainted with John P. Dunning, the
husband of Elizabeth Dunning, deceased. Be
fore starting; for California I saw him in the
town of Dover. At the time of my interview
with Mr. Dunning I had present the note and
the letter known as the anonymous letter, and
the envelope supposed to have Inclosed the
anonymous letter. All of the letters were shown
to John P. Dunning. The Attorney General
said: "Those are the anonymous letters re
ceived by your wife." Dunning then read the
letters, making the remark: "She deceived
me. She led me to believe that Mrs. Seely
had written those letters. I did not receive the
original letter. It was a copy of this letter I
received from my wife at Salt Lake City,
which I forwarded to Mrs. Botkin at Ban
Francisco, and she wrote me stating that It
was Mrs. Seely's writing."
Then the Attorney General asked him If he
could Identify the writing. Dunning replied
he knew It as Mrs. Botkln's, as he had re
ceived over 300 letters from her and had also
seen her write. Then the Attorney General
handed Dunning the not" which was stated
to have been the note Inclosed In the box of
candy received by Mrs. Dunning from San
Francisco, and asked him If he could identify
that writing. His answer was "That Is con
sistent with the rest." Dunning said that he
had written a letter to Mrs. Botkin. telling
her that he was going East to live with hlB
wire as soon as the war was over, which
would be In a few weeks. ' -""ig the reasons
I have for thinking this case should be tried
in the State of Delaware le tne fact that Hon.
John B. Pennlngton. who would be one of the
principal witnesses for the State, is a resident
of Dover. Del., and Is a man 80 years of age
or thereabouts and is in a feeble bodily condl-'
Hon. I know he would not be physically able
to stand the trip from Delaware to California
to attend the trial of the case. There are also
doctors who have been called in and by reason
of their knowledge become witnesses In this
case, and I do not believe they would be will
ing to leave their business In Dover, Del., for
the time that would necessarily be consumed
In the trial of the case here, they not being
amenable to the process of this State.
MRS. BOTKIN'S
PREMONITIONS
Miss Livernash and Mrs.
Rauof Deal With Y\er Con
fessions and pears.
Through the columns of The Call the
evidence of Miss Lizzie Livernash has
been previously given. Miss Livernash
was the constant companion of Mrs. Bot
kin during the trip from Healdsburg to
Stockton by way of San Francisco, and
in her affidavit deals solely with the
hysterical condition of Mrs. Botkin at
that time, as well as with her admissions
of intimacy with Dunning. The orgies at
927 Geary street are described at length,
as is the scene in Stockton upon the first
meeting of Mrs. Botkin with her husband
after she had learned that suspicion
haa rested upon her.
Of this Miss Livernash says:
"At Stockton we were met at the train by
Mr. Botkin; he conducted us to the Imperial
Hotel; as soon as Mr. Botkin appeared Mrs.
Dotkin was again visibly affected to such an
extent that it required both of us to assist
her to the hotel; arriving there Mr. Botkin
requested to be left alone with his wife for
a few moments and standing in the corridor,
right near the door, the transom being open,
I could distinctly hear every word Mrs. Botkin
said to her husband. She beseeched and im
plored and begged him to give me a statement
for publication In the Examiner saying that
the fault was his that they lived apart. Bhe
said, 'You must do Itâ you must do It; you
must shield me for you have the power to
save my life; you must save my life; you
must say that the fault is yours that we live
apart; if you do not help me, If you do not
save my life I will hound that woman to the
very ends of hell.' "
Speaking of the quarrel with her dis
polute son, Beverly Botkin, which was an
episode of the same meeting, Miss Liver
nash says:
"When I stepped Into the room Mrs. Botkin
was on her knees before her son crying and
carrying on In a very hysterical manner; her
son was also prying. He exclaimed, "Why,
Jack Dunning loves my mother.' Mrs. Botkin
exclaimed, 'Beverly, Beverly, you will ruin
me.'
"Alone In our own rooms after we had left
the son and husband. Mrs. Botkin exclaimed to
me that her son had the power to damn her.
The knowledge that Mrs. Almlra Raouf
of Healdsburg might have of the case
has been much speculated upon, but her
affidavit develops that what she knows
can be used only as corroborative evi
dence. It rambles through many mat
ters of utter insignificance, and is only
saved from valuelessness by two or three
points.
Of these her ready Identification of Mrs.
Botkln's handwriting with that of the
anonymous letters Is most remarkable.
Concerning that point Mrs. Raouf says:
"I am acquainted with Mrs. Cordelia Botkin
and have known her betwÂ«*en seven and eight
years. I have .received, many ivttÂ«iÂ» (mm her
wri.tten by herself, having been In eorreÂ«pond
enee with her for two years and upward?. I
have been shown the anonymous letters, also
the original envelope a'Mresaed to 'Mrs. John
P. Dunning, Dover. Delaware'; also the orig
inal paper used as a wrapper and containing
two addresses. 'Mrs. John P. Dunning, Dover,
Delaware,' also the note, 'With love to your
self and baby. Mre. C' and in my opinion
and Judgment all the writings contained in
these several originals are in the handwriting
of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin."
Relative to the handkerchief alleged to
have been bought at the City of Paris,
Mrs. Raouf says:
" I have been shown the handkerchief of
which exhibit 6 Is a photographic copy. I saw
one similar to that when I was in company
with Mrs. JJotkln in the City of Paris, marked
'Z5 cents.' I was there with her and she asked
me if I did not think they were handsome. She
did not purehn.Be any at that time.
"On the Ist day of June I called to see Mrs.
Botkin at the Hotel Victoria, on California
and Hyde streets, in this city and county, hav
ing Just come from Stockton. It was about 11
o'clock In the forenoon. She asked me, when
I was in the miiilnery businees what I used
for WJeaehing hate I told her 1 never did that
sort of work, but always sent It out. She asked

Among the depositions taken here are
those of James W. Erwin, United States
Postofflce Inspector; John D. Dunnigan, a
mailing clerk, and Oscar A. Forster, a

kin, having handled her mail while she
resided at Victoria Hotel. He identifies
certain orders regarding change of ad
dress as having been received by him
from Mrs. Botkin in person.
Mr. Erwln traced the fateful box of
bonbons from the time they left this city
on August 4 until they were delivered to
Mrs. Dunning in Dover on August 9. The
times of their arrival at the principal
points en route were all carefully noted
to the minute. He identifies the cancel
ing mark on the package as having been
made at Station D, in this city.
Mailing Clerk Dunnigan tells of hand
ling- a package aaaressed to John P. Dun

MANILA, Sept. 14.â Agutnaldo and
five of his subchiefs have concluded not
to provoke a conflict with Americans
at this time, and, obedient to General
Otis' orders, the insurgents -ire to-day
moving out of Malate, Eroita and
Santa Ana, General Pio Pilar is
throwing up strong works at Las Pinas
to protect Bakoor and the rebels' sup
ply depot at Imus.
The insurgent soldiers said the Amer
icans are to be attacked on October 5.
Their feeling is deeply aggravated by
the attitude of certain sensational
American newspapers. Aguinaldo is
preparing and will soon issue a state
ment to the American people. San
Francisco newspaper of August 2 con
tained a story of treachery, headed
"Perfildious Aguinaldo Hampers Amer
ican Troops." To this story the dicta
tor takes strong exceptions. Copies of
the paper, which were generally circu
lated here, finally reached the rebel
leader, and it was the last straw. Agui
naldo resolved to appeal to Americans,
cabling his own statement to the As-
Bociated Press. He will deny the
charges of treachery, or that he ever
Bought to hamper American operations,
and he will declare openly his willing
ness to accept an American protector
ate or annexation of the islands. He
will also disclaim any ambition for dic
tatorship or the presidency.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MADRID, Sept. 14. â General Prlmo
de Rivera has demanded an inquiry in
to his administration of the Philippine
Inlands, and in doing so he said the at
tacks of Count d'Alraenas were only
"fit for the mouth of a miserable Blan-
derer."
Count d'Almenas was endeavoring to
reply when Senor Sagasta read the de
cree proroguing the Cortes.
Count d'Almenas and General Rivera
separated, approached the President in
a hostile manner, and a duel is ex-
pected.
Premier Sagasta afterward read the
decree in the Chamber of Deputies.
It is expected that the Spanish peace
commissioners will be appointed with-
out delay.
A painful impression has been caused
here by a statement made by the Pals
saying the United States intends to de
mand $20,000,000 Indemnity in behalf of
American citizens who have suffered
through tthe insurrection in Cuba. The
Spanish peace commissioners will
strongly oppose this, it is claimed, but
fears prevail that the United States
will become pitiless and press itÃ ad
vantage to the utmost.
The Queen Regent signed the protocol I
bill this evening. The Government had
intended the Cortes to sit until an in
demnity for the suspension of the con
stitutional guarantees had been passed,
but the threatened agitation on the
part of General Weyler and others, to
gether with the evidence of divisions in
both the Liberal and the Conservative
parties, convinced Senor Sagasta of the
advisability of closing down debates
which would have hindered the free
progress of the peace negotiations.
The Cortes will be next convoked to
ratify the final treaty of peace. It is
rumored that Senor Perio, Senor Crespo
and Senor Lara, members of the Cham
ber of Deputies, started for the French
frontier this evening.
LONDON, Sept. 16.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Daily Mail says: The
politicians for the most part favor an
entire renunciation of the Philippines
k in exchange for economic advantages.
W The Government closed the Cortes to- |
day (Wednesday) because It feared
complications through" the publicity a
continuance of the session would give
to the acts of the Spanish generals.
The Standard says editorially this
morning, after congratulating Senor
Sagasta and the Government upon
and tact of General Otis have produced
an excellent result. The Governor of
Iloilo is facilitating commerce, accord
ing to his agreement, and tru^e with
the southern ports Increases daily.
IOWA AND OREGON
WILL JOIN DEWEY
NEW YORK. Sept. 14.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Secretary Long Informed me to-day
that the battleships lowa and Oregon
are under orders to proceed to Manila
via Honolulu for the purpose of rein
forcing Admiral Dewey's command.
The Secretary's statement is a con-
firmation of the announcement made
by the Herald on Tuesday last that the
battleships would proceed to Manila.
In directing them to touch at Honolulu
the authorities were actuated by two
motives â first, by putting them in a
central position, where they could be
available for any duty in Pacific wa
ters which might be considered desir
able: and second, because they did not
care to . send reinforcements to Rear
Admiral Dewey before the armistice
now in force between the United States
and Spain expired. It Is expected in
official circles that the battleships and
five colliers which will accompany
them will be ready to sail for the Pa
cific by Monday next.
While believing there will be no In
ternational developments to change the
programme, the authorities do not pro
pose to be in such a position that they
cannot modify instructions to vessels in
case of necessity. And It Is for this
reason that they desire them to touch
at certain points, report their arrival
and receive any orders the department
may find it advisable to send them.
So far as Germany is concerned the au
thorities say there is nothing in the at
titude of that Government to cause a
belief that it proposes to interfere with
any disposition of the Philippine? that
this Government may see fit to make.
It Is appreciated, however, that it will
be the part of wisdom, for the United
States to put in the Pacific a force
which will be so formidable as to dis
courage even a suggestion of interfer
ence. It fs ror this reason that the Ore
gon and lowa have been sent to Join
Rear Admiral Dewey rather than be
cause of any pressing emergency.
"having survived a difficult period suc
cessfully," that the danger is now over.
Spain, it continues, appears reconciled,
knowing that whatever differences may
arise in the peace negotiations she is
bound to yield. As to reports that in
demnity will be demanded the United
States knows that no money can be got
out of Spain and is therefore unlikely
to make such a demand seriously. If
the United States secures Luzon it is
most probable that Spain will give up
the remainder of the islands as a use
less incumbrance.
ELIZABETH'S BODY IS
SENT FROM SWITZERLAND
Casket Containing the Remains of
Austria's Late Empress Buried
in Floral Offerings.
GENEVA, Switzerland, Sept. 14.â The
casket containing the remains of the late
Empress of Austria, borne on a four-horse
car and followed by two other cars almost
burled In floral offerings, was conveyed to
the railroad station here at 8:30 o'clock
this morning. An enormous concourse of
people witnessed the ceremony. The cor
tege was led by the representatives of the
Imperial Court, followed by the Federal
Council, headed by the President and thÂ«
Geneva Council. The firemen lined the
streets. The brilliant sunshine made a
striking contrast to the gloomy aspect of
the mourners. The funeral train left here
at 9 o'clock.
The funeral car was ornamented with
silver wreaths, surmounted by a silver
cross and had white plumes at each cor
ner. The caHket was of polished oak, with
silver mountings. It was almost hidden
beneath floral tributes^ On the arrival of
the hearse at the railroad station, which
was hung with black drapery, the coffin
was removed, the remains of the Empress
were ceremoniously blessed and the casket
was placed in the railroad car, which was
then sealed. After this the Austrian offi
cials embarked on the train and it de
parted from this city.
VIENNA, Sept. 14.â 1n accordance with
the Emperor's wishes, the remains of his
wife, the late Empress Elizabeth, will be
Interred beside those of Crown PrincÂ©
Rudolph. Interment on Saturday, there
fore, will be only temporary.
TRIESTE, Austria, Sept. 14.â The anti-
Italian demonstrations here were renewed
last evening. An attack upon the Italian

he would be more serviceable to the coun

ACCEPTS TERMS
OF THE PROTOCOL
Bill Passed by the Span
ish Parliament.
BOTH HOUSES HAVE ACTED
WASHINGTON OFFICIALS NOW
FEEL EASIER.
It Is Stated That the United States
May Find It Necessary to
Retain All the Phil
ippines,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"WASHINGTON, Sept. 14.â Much sat
isfaction was expressed to-day over the
reports from Madrid that the lower
house of Parliament had passed the
Government bill accepting the terms of
the protocol.
The upper house already has passed
this measure, so that the last fear of
the legislative opposition of the trans
fer of Cuba, the Ladrones and. Porto
Rico is over. The authorities here feel
that this carries them by a danger
point, as it has been feared for some
time that the animosities in the Span
ish Cortes would lead to the defeat of
the Sagasta Ministry on the question
of evacuating the Spanish islands,
either in one branch or the other.
It is not doubted that the commis
sion will start the. negotiations at Paris
with the assertion that we have con
quered Spain in the Philippines, and
that Spanish sovereignty has already
been forfeited there. This will not,
however, necessarily signify that it is
the purpose of the administration to re
tain possession of the entire group of
islands, or to permanently deprive
Spain of all her possessions in the Pa
cific.
It is not believed that the adminis
tration has gone beyond the determina
tion to retain the whole of the island
of Luzon, but it is understood to be the
intention of the President to establish
at the outset the right of this Govern
ment to determine the fate of the is
lands.
The matter of relinquishing posses
sion of the rest of the islands Is in
volved with so many conditions to be
considered that it is realized that it
may by force of circumstances become
necessary to deprive Spain permanent
ly of all her possessions in that quar
ter. It is understood not to be a mat
ter of policy to acquire all this terri
tory, but it may become a necessity.
The commercial and trade side of the
question, as involving the development
and expansion of our commerce in the
Pacific, is occupying chief attention in
connection with determining our
policy. ___^ _
WASHINGTON COAL
FOR SAN FRANCISCO
Fairfax Mines East of Tacoma to Be
Developed on a Largo
Scale.
TACOMA, Sept. 14.â Increased demand
for coal on the Pacific Coast, particularly
at Ban Francisco, has led to the open
ing of the Fairfax mines, forty miles
eaat of Tacoma. They are owned by
the American Development Company, of
which H. W. McNeil, formerly general
manager of the Oregon Improvement
Company, is president. The product of
the veins now being opened, consisting
of domestic and steam coals, will be
shipped to San Francisco, beginning in
October. The mines will produce 1000 tons
daily at first, which will later be in
creased to 1500 tons. Other veins pro
duce blacksmithing and coking coal, and
will be opened next year, when an Im
mense coke-making plant is to be built.
A one-eighth mile branch of the Northern
Pacific Railway is being constructed
from Carbonado to the Fairfax mines,
where the new town of Fairfax has been
laid out.
Everything Is being done on a large
scale, funds for development being fur
nished by British capitalists, who are.
part-owners with President McNeil of the
British Columbia anthracite mines at
Banff. McNeil is one of the most prom
inent coal men on the Pacific Coast. In
shipping and mining circles It is predict
ed that his operation will result in lessen
ing shipments of British Columbia and
Australian coals to San Francisco.
It Is understood in shipping circles
that the company Is considering the ad
visability of using barges for carrying
coal down the coast.

GREAT SORROW
OF MRS. BOTKIN
Overwhelmed With Grief Over
Dunning's Departure for
the Seat of War.
Mrs. Loretta Simpson, landlady of the
Victoria Hotel preceding Airs. Price, who
succeeded her in last April, swears that
Mrs. Botkin applied for rooms at that
house two or three months before the
transfer, and was given a room on the
third floor, opposite that of J. P. Dun
ning. Mrs. Botkin Introduced Dunning aa
her cousin. They only breakfasted at the
hotel. Mrs. Botkin represented herself
as a newspaper woman. Inquiry was
made of Mrs. Nye, a lodging-house keeper
on California street, as to the reputation
of Mrs. Botkin, who had had a room In
her house. Mrs. Nye spoke very highly
of Mrs. Botkin.
Mrs. Botkin and Dunning came up to
gether to the Victoria, after having se
lected their rooms, and paid a month s
rent in advance. Dunning was In the
house only a week when he received a
telegram to go to Cuba, The next morn-
Ing Mrs. Botkin was very much excited,
crying and going on at a great rate, say-
Ing she thought that would be the last of
Dunning, that he surely would be killed.
She seemed very much worried and wu
almost crazy about his going away.
Mrs. Montgomery, who was Introduced
as a cousin of Mrs. Botkin, came to con
sole her. She remarked that she "did not
see what Mrs. Botkin could see In Dun
ning." Mrs. Botkin went on hysterically
before Dunning's departure and seemed
very much infatuated with him. Dunning
came to Mrs. Simpson with tears In his
eyes and asked her to be good and kind
to Mrs. Botkin. After he left Mrs. Simp
son heard of nothing but the war and
Cuba from Mrs. Botkin.

REPORTS ON THE
CUBAN CAMPAIGN
General Shafter Gives
the Details.
PREPARATIONS INCOMPLETE
BUT CONDITIONS DID NOT AD
MIT OF ANY DELAY.
Supplies Had to Be Taken Over a
Narrow Wagon Road, and Fear
Was Entertained of Ships
Being Driven to bee.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 14.â General
Shafter's report of the campaign which
terminated in the fall of Santiago has
been made public. He briefly recounts
the organization of the expedition and
Its embarkation, and then devotes the
main body of the report to the active
operations about Santiago. General
Shafter says the expedition was under
taken in compliance with telegrahpic
Instructions of May 30 from headquar
ters of the army, In which It was
stated: "Admiral Schley reports that
two cruisers and two torpedo-boats
have been seen In the harbor of San
tiago. Go with your force to capture
garrison at Santiago and assist in cap
turing harbor and fleet."
After reciting the delay at Tampa,
due to inadequate facilities. General
Bhafter says that on June 1 he received
orders to sail without delay, but not
with less than 10,000 men. After some
transports had already reached the
lower bay, telegraphic instructions
were received from the Secretary of
War directing that the sailing of the
expedition be delayed awaiting further
orders This delay was occasioned by
the navy reporting that a Spantsa wac
vessel had been sighted in the Nicholas
channel. The ships In the lower bay
wÂ«re immediately recalled. The expe
dition sailed on June 14 with 815 officers
and 15,072 men.
. General Shatter briefly covers the
trip and landing and his first meeting
â with General Garcia, adding: "Dur
ing the interview General Garcia of
fered the services of his troops, com
prising about 4000 men, in the vicinity
of Aserradores, and about 5000 under
General Castillo at the little town of
Cujababa, a few miles east of Baiquiri.
I accepted his offer, impressing it upon
him that I could exercise no military
control over him except such as he
would concede, and as long as he served
under me I could furnish him rations
and ammunition."
After conferring with Admiral Samp
son and General Garcia, the plan of
campaign was outlined by General
Shatter. The disembarkation was to
commence on the 22d at Baiquiri, with
feints by the Cubans on Cabanas and
by the navy at various shore points In
order to mislead the enemy as to the
place of landing.
General Shatter says: "These move
ments permitted me to approach San
tiago from the east over a narrow road,
at first in some places no better than
a trail, running from Baiquiri through
Siboney and Sevllla, and making at
tack from that quarter. This, in my
opinion, was the only feasible plan and
subsequent information and results
confirmed my judgment."
Of the early operations and the skir
mish, in which the Rough Riders par
ticipated, he says:
General Young's brigade passed beyond
Lawton in the night of the 23d and 24th,
thus taking the advance, and on the
morning of the latter date became engag
ed with a Spanish force entrenched in a
strong position at La Guasima, a point
on the Santiago road about thirty miles
from Siboney. General Young's force
consisted of one squadron of tfie First
Cavalry, one of the Tenth Cavalry and
two of the First T'nited States Volunteer
Cavalry, in all 964 officers and men. The
enemy made an obstinate resistance, but
were driven from the field with consid
erable loss. Our own loss was one offi
cer ami fifteen men killed, six officers
and fifty-six men wounded. The report
ed losses of the Spaniards were nine
killed and twenty-seven wounded. The
engagement had an inspiring effect on
our men. and, doubtless, correspondingly
depressed the enemy, as it was plainly
demonstrated to them that they had to
face a foe who would advance upon them
under a heavy fire delivered from en
trenchments. General Wheeler, division
commander, was present during the en
gagement, and reports that our troops,
officers and men. fought with the great
est gallantry. This engagement gave us
a well-watered country farther, to the
front on which to encamp our troops
It was not until nearly two weekÃ after
the army landed that It was possible to
place on shore three days' supplies in '
excess of those required for the daily i
consumption. On June 30 I reconnoitered
the country about Santiago and made
my plan of attack. From a high hill
from which the city was in plain view'
I could see the San Juan hill and coun
try about El Caney. . The roada were
very poor, and, in fact, little better than
bridle paths until the San Juan River
and El Caney were reached.
General Shafter explained at a meet
ir.g of generals his plan of battle, which
follows: . ,
Lawton's division, assisted by Capron's
light battery, was ordered to move out
during the afternoon toward El Ca

PROMOTION FOR BLACK.
State Superintendent Elected President
of the San Diego Normal School.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 14.â State Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion Samuel T. Black was to-day elected president of the State Nor
mal School at San Diego at the joint meeting of the State Normal
Boards, which assembled at the Governor's office.
After a long consultation by the boafd Mr. Black was elected by ac
clamation and received the congratulations of his many friends. Mr.
Black considers the presidency of the Normal as a promotion for
past labors creditably performed. His salary will be $3400 per year
and will begin October 1.
Mr. Black announced to-night that he would resign his office as
Superintendent of Public Instruction on October 1, when he would
remove to Ban Diego. It is quite well understood that his succes
sor will be C. E. Meredith, principal of the High School at Azusa,
Los Angeles County, and one of the applicants for the place for
which Mr. Black was chosen.
road, the head of the column resting
near El Poso, toward which heights
Grimes' battery moved on the afternoon
of the 30th, with orders to take position
there early on the next morning, and at
the proper time prepare the way for the
advance of Wheeler and Kent on San
Juan hill. The attack at this point was
to be delayed until Law ton's guns were
heard at El Caney and his infantry firing
showed he had become well engaged. The
preparations were far from what I de
sired them to be, but we were in a sickly
climate, our supplies had to be brougnt
forward by a narrow wagon road which
the rains might at any time render im
passable; fear was entertained that a
storm might drive the vessels containing
our supplies to sea, thus parting us from
our base of supplies, and, lastly it was
reported that General Pando, with 8000
reinforcements for the enemy, was en
route from Manzanillo and might be ex
pected in a few days. Under these con
ditions I determined to give battle with
out delay.
The report goes on to give in detail
an account of the fighting that led up
to the surrender of Santiago by the
Spaniards. Gallantry of division, bri
gade and regimental commanders and
officers of lesser rank is duly praised.
General Shatter then gives the de
tails of the final surrender, his entry
into the city of Santiago and the rais
ing of the American flag. In closing he
says:
Before closing my report I wish to
dwell upon the natural obstacles I had to
encounter and which no foresight could
have overcome or obviated. The rocky
and precipitous coast afforded no shelter
for landing places, the roads were mere
bridle paths, the effect of the tropical
sun and rains upon unaccllmated troops
was deadly, and a dread of strange and
unknown diseases had its effect on the
army.
At Baiquiri the landing of the troops
and stores was made at a small wooden
wharf, which the Spaniards tried to burn,
but unsuccessfully, and the animals were
pushed into the water and guided to a
sandy beach about 200 yards in extent.
At Siboney the landing- was made on the
beach and at a small wharf erected by
the engineers. I had neither the time nor
the men to spare to construct permanent
wharves. In spite of the fact, that 1 had
nearly 1000 men continuously at work- on
the roads, they were at times impassable
for wagons.
The Ban Juan and Aguadores rivers
would often suddenly rise so as to- pre
vent the passage or wagons, and then
the eight pack trains with the command
had to be depended upon for the victual
ing of my army as well as the 20,000
refugees who could not In the Interests of
humanity be left to starve vufclle we had
rations. Often for days nothing could be
moved except on pack trains.
After the great physical strain and ex
posure of July 1 and 2 the malarial atfd
other fevers began to rapidly advance
throughout the command, and on July 4
the yellow fever appeared at Siboney.
Though efforts were made to keep this
fact from . the army it soon became
known. The supply of quartermaster and
commissary stores during the campaign
was abundant, and notwitnstanding the
difficulties in landing the rations, the
troops on the firing lines were at all
times supplied with its coarse compo
nents, namely, oat bread, meat, sugar and
coffee. . There was no lack of transporta
tion, for at no time up to the surrender
could all the wagons I had be used.
In reference to the sick and woun-ded, I
have to say that they received every at
tention that it was possible to give them.
The medical officers without exception
worked night and day to alleviate the
suffering, which was no greater than in
variably accompanies a campaign. ft
would have been better If we had more
ambulances, but as many were taken as
was necessary, judging from previous
campaigns.
The discipline of the command was su
perb, and I wish to Invite attention to
the fact that not an officer was brought
to trial by court-martial, and, as far as
I know, no enlisted man. This speaks vol
umes for an army of this size and in a
campaign of such duration. In conclu
sion I desire to express to the members
of my staff my thanks for their efficient
performance of all the duties required of
them, and the good Judgment and bravery
displayed on all occasions when de
manded.

BLACK MEASLES
AMONG INDIANS
1
Dread Disease Epidemic
Near Sumner.
FOUR VICTIMS HAVE DIED
BALANCE QUARANTINED ON A
HOP RANCH.
Qnlllayutea Afflicted With a Conta
gious Plague Work in the
Field With Whites
for Days.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Sept. 14.â One hundred
Quillayute Indians are quarantined on
Gardella's hop ranch, near Sumner,
suffering from an epidemic of highly
contagious black measles. The county
officials put quarantine regulations in
force this morning after an investi
gation. Guards were posted, two to
watch by day and two by night. None
of the Indians are permitted to leave
the camp. Plenty of water and wood
is provided for them.
These Indians are from Quillayute
reservation, on the Pacific Ocean,
north of Grays Harbor. They arrived
here in canoes two weeks ago, ex
pecting to earn their winter spending
money picking hops. They were first
employed on a hop ranch near the
County Poor Farm, between Puyallup
and Sumner. It was while there the
dreaded black measles broke out, and
within a few days four Indians had
died.
The Indians then became panic
stricken. The disease was spreading
rapidly among them and they deter
mined to leave. In the darkness, a few
nights ago, they broke camp and si
lently stole away. Concealing the fact
that the disease had broken out among
them with fatal effects, they applied
for and obtained work picking hops at
Gardella's ranch.
There were white pickers there, how
ever, and they were not long in learn
ing what had happened. Dr. Corliss
of Sumner was notified and visited the
Indians. He found them suffering
from black measles in its most virulent
form, several of the Indians being
nearly dead. Absolutely nothing had
been done to check its progress, the In
dians attributing its presence to anger
on the part of evil spirits. Corliss
promptly recommended quarantining
the entire band, and lent his assist
ance.
It will probably be weeks before the
disease can be stamped out and the
quarantine removed. When the Indians
are released hop picking will be over.
They w4ll go home empty-handed, and
there will be mourning in the lodges of
the Quillayute braves this winter when
the chill winds howl down their reserv
ation shores.
Before the sick Indians were quaran
tined hundreds of white pickers were
exposed to the black measles. Con
sternation prevails among them in fear
of a general epidemic. It is certain the
Quillayutes brought the disease from
their reservation.

OMAHA, Sept. 14.â 1n taking the chair
to preside for the "silver day" at the
monetary conference, Senator Allen of
Nebraska voiced a hearty welcome on be
half of his State to the champions of all
sides of the money question who had met
to discuss the merits of their respective
claims.
At the morning session of the confer
ence, Mr. Crawford, who was to have

he had finished, Chairman Towne of the
Silver Republican National Committee de
livered his address upon "The Coinage
and Use of Silver as Standard Money Co
ordinately With Gold."
Former Senator Carey of Wyoming re
plied to Mr. Towne.
The principal speakers at the afternoon
session were George Fred Williams of
Boston and Congressman C. N. Fowler of
Elizabeth, N. J. Mr. Williams was the
first to speak. His conversion to the silver
theory he attributed to a philanthropic
reason Involved In what was to him a
great Question.
He was followed by Anson Wolcott of
Indiana, who reviewed financial legisla
tion with a purpose to show that It had
been destructive of the circulating med
ium; Judge Joseph Sheldon ofConnectlcut,
who upheld the quantitative theory of
money; President Thomas E. WUls of the
Kansas Agricultural College, who dis
counted the value of academic opinions
on economic questions generally. Wealth
dominated, he said. Institutions of learn
ing, and he cited the case of Professor
Andrews of Brown University to show
that college professors dai*e not teach

COLOMBIA AND ITALY END
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS
Close of Intercourse Has Been An
nounced Briefly, but Not
Explained.
ROMB, Sept 14.â Italy, it Is announced,
declares that her diplomatic relations with
the Republlo ol Colombia are ended, Col
ombia refusing to recognise the British
minister as the Italian representative dur
ing the latter's absence.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 14.â A dispatch
bearing on the diplomatic relations of
Italy and Colombia has been received by
9enor Rengifo, the Charge d'Affaires of
the latter country here. It is rather brief,
simply containing the statement by the
Minister of Foreign Affairs Paul, that
"diplomatic relations with Italy have been
declared interrupted."
It is pointed out that there is a slight
difference In the wording of the dispatch
from Colombia and that from Rome, the
former saying that the relations were
"interrupted/ while the latter says that
they have been "ended."
Senor Rengifo has no reason to suggest
for the interruption of relations between
the two countries, and, in the absence of
fuller information, he declines to make
any comment upon the reports. He haw
asked his Government for more specific
news on the subject The suggestion is
made here in well-informed quarters that
In all probability Colombia has taken the
initiative In this matter and not Italy,
as stated in the Rome d) ~^atch.

friends of Dr. Rethers were too late in urging his candidacy, and so
the choice fell to Dr. Bazet.
Mr. HUNGTINGTON`S
BIG INVESTMENT
Sale of Los Angeles
Street Railways.
BOUGHT BY A SYNDICATE
SOUTHERN PACIFIC MAGNATE
AT ITS HEAD,
Deal Includes Practically the Entire
Electric System in the South
ern California Me
tropolis.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 14.â The Los
Angeles Railway. Company's property,
which includes a system of electric
street railways practically covering
the entire city of Los Angeles, has
passed into the hands of a syndicate
of Southern Pacific capitalists, of
which 11. E. Huntington is the head.
The details of the transaction involve
| the issue, of $5,000,000 in bonds by the
i new corporation. Of this amount
! $4,000,000 is to be devoted to cancelling
the $3,000,000 bond issue of the old cor
poration, to the discharge of a float
ing indebtedness of $400,000 and to cer
tain improvements to be made in the
property. The bonds of the new com
pany are to bear 5 per cent interest.
The price paid for the property of the
old company is said to have been
$3,900,000.
The officials of the Los Angeles Rail
way in this city decline to discuss the
question of this transfer, but the in
formation obtained comes from an in
side source, and the attempt to sup
press it proved futile. The deal was
consummated by General M. H. Sher
man, who organized the Los Angeles
Railway Company. In 1891 he came to
Los Angeles from Phoenix, Ariz. He
had been a school teacher there, but by
shrewd speculation had accumulated a
fortune of 4500,000.
General Sherman proceeded to In
vest his entire fortune 1n the construc
tion of a system of electric street rail
ways, which Covered the city as it then
was. It was the first electric system in
Los Angeles. There was at that time
a system of cable street railways here,
owned by Chicago capitalists. It
passed into the hands of a receiver, and
later was consolidated with General
Sherman's company. The cable was
abandoned and the lines eleetricized.
The Chicago people lost $2,000,000 by
their investment.
Among other corporations that aa
sieted General Sherman in financing
his scheme was the Pacific Bank.
"When it went to the wall the Los An
geles Railway followed, and it was for
some time operated by a receiver. San
Francisco capitalists, including the
Bank of California, took the property
in and reorganized the company, mak
ing F. W; Wood gem-nil manager. For
three years the road has been operated
under his management.
With no desire to cast any reflec
tions upon Mr. Wood's management, it
may be stated that the Los Angeles
Railway has never paid a dividend to
its stockholders. The het income has
been devoted to extending and improv
ing the property. The city has exper
ienced a wonderful growth and numer
ous extensions have been made.
Ten weeks ago General Sherman
went to San Francisco and the result is
the consummation of this deal, by
which, it is understood, he will net
about $1,500,000. He held between 40
and 45 per cent of the stock of the old
company. It is understood that Gen
eral Sherman has purchased numer
ous securities of the old company held
in San Francisco at a very low figure.
These securities will now have a very
healthy value and General Sherman
will profit materially thereby.
The general was seen at the West
minster Hotel, but declined to talk.
Manager F. W. Wood likewise was si
lent.
Investments in Los Angeles street
car properties have not for ten years
been profitable. Something like $4,000,
000 has been lost by original investors
in that character of property in Los
Angeles since 1888. The experience of
others never stopped continued devel
opment in this line. An electric road
was constructed to Pasadena and one
to Santa Monica. Both of these vÂ»et =
built by General Sherman, who ob
tained the investment of the money ne
cessary to construct the lines. They
are not, however, included in the deal
which has been made. In the city an
other line has been built, known as the
Traction Company. It is a cross-town
road and the money which built it
came from New York City. The Trac
tion Company is still in the hands of
its original owners and apparently has
been a money-making proposition. The
new company will have many new im
provements, for the reason that the
streets of this city are being paved
with asphaltum and the expense of
paving about half of the highway falls
on the company.

REDDING, Sept. 14.â Frank Bartlett, a
young law student, was found In his

PROVISIONAL
GOVERNMENT'S
NEW MANIFESTO
It preely flckpwledges Cuba's
Gratitude to tfye United
States.
But tbÂ« Present Council, Headed by Masso,
Wants to Hold on as a Nucleus for
Future Government.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA. Sept. 14.â The
Council of the so-called provisional
Government of the republic of Cuba.
represented by Senor Bartolome Masso.
President; Cisnero Capote, Vice Presi
dent, and Senor Fonte, Senor Aleman
and Senor Moreno de la Torre, Secreta
ries, met at Santa Cruz on September
1 and formulated a manifesto to the
Cuban people with an order to the
military commanders of the Cuban
army, both of which have been promul
gated.
The manifesto, which la an elaborate
document, touching on the history of,
the movement for Cuban independence
and the principles upon which the Cu
ban people have fought for their lib- ;
erty, proceeds, in part, as follows:
The peace preliminaries have been
Signed, ami the Government of the United
States has Imposed upon Spain an obli- ;
gation to renounce all the rights of sov
ereignty over the island of Cuba and to
evacuate the territory immediately. The
cessation of hostilities has also been
agreed upon.
Though the principal object of our revo
lution has been obtained, that is, the de
struction of Spanish domination, the work
of this council is not yet at an. end, for '
the Cuban republicâ the idea for which
we have foughtâ has not yet been consti
tuted. Now that hostilities have ceased
and Spain has renounced her sovereignty,
It is the duty of this council to set be
fore the Cuban people the feelings and
purposes of the men who made the revo
lution.
We always felt confident that through
our own perseverence we would in the
long run destroy Spanish domination; but
we must acknowledge that an indefinite
prolongation of the struggle would have
â¢ annihilated the little that was left of our
wealth and population. The entrance up
on the field of a powerful and decisive
factor, upon which we have always relied
and toward which the hearts of all Cu
bans have always turned, has put an end
to the horrors of war, to the benefit of all
concerned.
This prompt solution we must acknowl
edge we could never have obtained. It
is proper to acknowledge the evident
truth. That is the best title the United
States has to our gratitude. We were
abandoned by the world, some nations ig
noring us in selfishness; others ignorant
of our real condition, considering us an
obstinate and an undeservable people be
cause we did not accept the cajoleries and
flatteries with which Spain tried to
soothe our just anger.
This was our situation when the peo
ple of the United States, their Govern
ment and Congress came to our rescue
and took upon their shoulders the task
of delivering us at once from an un
bearable yoke, as our sufferings could
not be endured or permitted longer.
They have accomplished their pro
gramme brilliantly; what is more, they
Dave liberated, in- one way or another,
from the rule of Spain, all peoples op
pressed by her. The liberation is definite
and irrevocable. Spain has been expelled
from this hemisphere.
We are grateful. In nations as well as
in Individuals gratitude is ennobling. As
we begin now our national life we, more
than any. other people, must be jealous
of our national honor. It is. therefore,
the duty of this council to explain to the
people of Cuba what in its opinion are our
duties toward the United States and
toward ourselves and what the rules that
ought to direct our conduct. When, af
ter a long struggle the United States Con
gress recognized the right of the people
of Cuba to be free and independent and
ordered the Spanish forces to withdraw
from the Island, no Cuban Government !
was recognized; but the one we had con
stituted, though not recognized, was not
opposed and has not been opposed. â  No
steps have been taken to dislodge it from
the place where it exercised its functions,
nor has it been considered an illegitimate
authority which events have dissolved or
destroyed for the good of the people of
Cuba.
It' could not be .otherwise. The United
States could not interfere in the struggle j
for the sake of what our enemies might j
consider a political faction. The. Ameri
can Government could intervene for the
benefitof the whole people of Cuba, a
part of whom, being under Spanish rule,
was not free to express a purpose or a ]
preference. The Intention of the United
States was that as soon as the obstacle ,
of Spanish rule had been removed the !
whole Cuban people should choose a gov- i
ernment that . would shape the destinies !
of the island.
Th<> people of the United States have all j
along appreciated the fact that the ma- I
jority of the people of Cuba are In agree
ment with our principles, for the motto
of the United States Government has
been the same as . oursâ absolute Inde
pendence for Cuba. Under these condi
tions the Americans could not take a hos
tile attitude toward us or. consider our.
authority illegitimate and harmful to the
welfare of the Cuban. people. ...
These considerations have convinced, us
that we should not dissolve and that the
power, we : have received from ;an assem
bly elected by the " people under arms
shotild never -, vanish. ; On ' the - contrary,
wo feel that we should remain as a nu
cleus and guide for. those who have vest
ed such a power In us. We have, there
fore, decided- to call together another as
sembly, 1 , which will: determine our future
course. ..
IT conclusion' the manifesto gives a
! number of reasons why the proposed
i assembly should be convened and some
; government or another chosen "not
with the character of a government as
j yet, but as an official representation of
those Cubans who fought against Spain
and those who, in the cities under
Spain's control and In the foreign coun
tries, have helped and supported them."
AMNESTY IS NOW
DULY DECLARED
WASHINGTON, Sept. 14.â The Cu
ban Junta has received the following
proclamation of amnesty Issued by the
Cuban authorities at Camaguey:
The Government Council in to-day's ses
sion ordered:
Whereas, Hostilities have been sus
pended any orders Â«whk:h hinder the
movements of those charged with bring
ing about peace should not be enforced
when the Independence of Cuba has al
ready been recognized by Spain and the
United States.
Whereas, In such circumstances It Is
useless to deprive the Spanish army of
news and guides, which, in some cases,
it may even be a duty to provide, so that
it may evacuate the territory as agreed
upon with the United States.
Whereas, The war being ended, all en
mity and hatred due to the struggle
i should cease, thus bringing about the
union of all the Cubans under our flag,
which is the symbol of liberty and not
of revenge.
Whereas, The leaders of the army
should do all in their power to punish any
attempt against personal security, that
no private vengeance shall be visited
upon those who have served Spain; there
; fore be it
Resolved. First, to suspend until fur
ther orders paragraph 2 in its last part.
; and paragraphs 9, 10, 13, 14 and 15 of arti
cle XLVIII of the penal law.
Second, to grant amnesty to all those
guilty of the crimes enumerated In article
XLVIII of the penal law; and
Third, that these resolutions be circu
lated among the army and authorities of
the republic, calling their attention to the
evils which may occur if a policy of for
giveness nnd pardon Is not observed.

Secretary of War Pro. Tern.
Camaguey. Sept. 14. IR9K.
Another proclamation received by
Mr. Quesada was issued by Colonel Mo
rales, second in command of the Cu
bans in Havana province. It says:
A great and prosperous nation, our sis
ter in republican ideals, has come to the
help of Cuba as Franco gave her generous
support to that democracy during its
struggle for Independence. Let us salute
i under our flag of the I,one Star the flag
of the Stars and Stripes, and let us de
spise these reports circulated against all
I truth and reason by our conquered enemy
| that the great republic is trying to take
possession shamelessly of our free and
independent Cuba. Let us not falter in
these movements in which our star begins
to shine brightly. Let us cheer, soldiers
I of the army of liberation, lor free and in
dependent Cuba and for the great Ameri
; can republic.
Mr. Quesada says the amnesty proc
: lamation shows how fully the Cuban
authorities accept the suspension of
â¢ military operations and the proclama
| tion of Colonel Morales indicates that
i the Cuban commanders look forward
I to a free and independent Cuba, with-
I out crediting the Spanish reports of
i American designs for annexing Cuba,

WORK OF THE LOS
ANGELES CONVENTION
Republicans Name Legislative Can
didates and Almost Complete
the County Ticket.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 14.â The busi
ness of the Republican County Conven
tion was resumed this morning. The
first work was the selection of a Coun
ty Central Committee of 170 members.
Then came the nomination of a Coun
ty Clerk. Charles W. Bell of Pasadena
was chosen by a majority of 220 votes
over his sole opponent, T. E. Newlln,
the incumbent. When the announce
ment of the result was made, the Pasa
dena delegates, amid ringing of bells,
seized the nominee and carried him on
their shoulders to the platform, where
he delivered an appropriate address,
thanking the convention for the honor
bestowed upon him.
The other county nominees are: T.
JE. Nichols, for Auditor; D. W. Wade,
for Recorder; John H. Gish, for Tax
Collector; James C. Reeves, for District
Attorney; E. S. Field, for Supervisor in
the Third District.
After balloting four times for Asses
sor and there being no choice, the con
vention adjourned until to-morrow.
The convention to-day subdivided
into Senatorial and Assembly Districts,
and nominations were as follows:
In the Thirty-sixth Senatorial Dis
trict Captain C. M. Simpson of Pasa
dena was renominated. Captain Simp
son was elected to the Senate four
years ago, and he received a handsome
indorsement of his record, for he had
twenty-six votes to spare in the Sena
torial convention. His opponent was
George P. Phlpps, a well-known law
yer of this city.
In the Thirty-eighth Senatorial Dis
trict A. T. Currier was nominated by
acclamation. This district is at pres
ent represented by S. N. Androus, but
he was not a candidate foT renomina
tion. Mr. Currier was elected Sheriff
of this county on the Republican ticket
in 1879, when the county was over
whelmingly Democratic. Mr. Currier
resides at Spadra. He is a pioneer of
the county and is a large landowner.
In the Seventy-fourth Assembly Dis
trict L. H. Valentine was renominated.
Mr. Valentine, to The Call correspond
ent, announced that, if elected â and he
will beâ he would be a candidate for
Speaker of the Assembly. He is a well
known practicing attorney and his
nomination can be regarded as a full
indorsement of his record in the As
sembly in 1896. In 1895 he received 850
majority in his district, running 400
votes ahead of his ticket.
In the Seventieth Assembly District
W. S. Mellck was renominated by ac
clamation. He Is at present editor of
the Pasadena News. His district is
overwhelmingly Republican, as It in
cludes the Soldiers' Home precinct and
Pasadena.
In the Seventy-first District O. H.
Huber was nominated. He is a ranch
er and is the present Assemblyman
from the district.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 14.â Governor's
day at the races attracted one of the
largest crowds of the meeting, the fair
sex predominating. His Excellency, Gov
ernor Budd, and staff, in full uniform,
were present, and were enthusiastically
received by the big throng. Governor
Budd left the course early, leaving to the
members of his staff the knotty problem
of solving the winners.
The day seemed created for racing pur
poses, and the racing brigade appeared
at its best. The menu served the public
consisted with one exception of harness
events, and five of the six favorites were
laid to rest with all honors. The odds
offered by the bookmakers were tight
enough to command respect from the
paddler of a bass drum in some country
band, and this In a measure accounted
for the dullness in trade.
Dr. J, over which "Jimmy" Sullivan
clutched the ribbons, was the forerunnei
of evil. He was a 3 to 5 choice for the
2:22 class mile dash, and, breaking at the
first turn, was never in it afterward.
The regular nominee, Ned Thorn, against
which 8 to 1 was once laid, rambled in
at leisure, with Shelby and Lynall follow

ion laid 1 to 2 against Montgomery, and a
break at the turn in the opening neat
saw him get the flag later. Prince Gift,
handled in handy fashion by Kent, took
the heat in 2:12%, with Osito a good sec
one. The second and deciding heat was
a repetition of the first. Prince Gift win
ning with something to loan in 2:13.
The McKinney mare Mamie Ri ley was
a sizzling tip for the 2:27 class mile dash,
but she ran for her paternal parent. Sne
was led past the Judges by Shelby, a 6 to
1 chance, in one of the prettiest drives or
the meeting, with Phoebe Childers and
Aggregate as close attendants.
The Diablo horse Diawood was consid
ered a certainty for the 2:20 pace, and at
the short price of 3 to 5 wiggled off a heat
as he pleased, chased out by Don and
Charles David in the order named.
Charles David, driven by the veteran
Donathan, was a hot tip in this race, but
scored up lame for the word and was
never a factor, a break at the turn put
ting him out of business.
Four to five and take your pick was
the price quoted against Much Better and
Rex Alto to win the 2:14 pace, also a mile
dash. Much Better did not get any the
best of the send off, and Rex Alto was
unsteady. Garnsey went out in the lead
with Floricita. a 25 to 1 shot, when the
word was given, and was never caught,
leading Beachwood past the wire a scant
P Tne sport terminated with a six furlong
selling dash for the runners. Hermanita
ruled favorite in the betting, with Hlmera
a stoutly touted second choice. Before a
quarter had been covered Himera was
cut oft, and Fig Leaf took the lead. Bull
man, on the latter, found no difficulty in
eventually winning handily from Losette.
Snider on Hermanita, got up in time to
finish third. _

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 14.âGovern
or's night at the pavilion was some
thing like "Hamlet" without Hamlet,
the Governor having found it neces
sary to return to San Francisco on the
afternoon train. Most of his staff, who
were guests of the Board of Agricul
ture for the day, accompanied him.
To-night the attendance at the pa
vilion was splendid and, since to-mor
row will be Sacramento day, and all
the city will take a half holiday, there
will doubtless be' a crush at the pa-
A'ilion in the evening.
The committee on awards was out to
night, and the medals will be distrib
uted in a day or two.
SAYS HIS SON WAS STOLEN.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 14.â This even-
Ing Colonel J. E. Depue of 1013 Broad
way, Oakland, and two detectives
arrived here in search of Depue's son
Clare who, he alleges, was kidnaped
about February 5 of this year. Depue
believes that the boy has been located
at the house of a rancher on the Shat
ter estate near Point Reyes and will
try to take him away to-morrow. The
father openly asserts that the boy is
being kept a prisoner under threats of
violence at the instigation of his step
mother, whose anger he says was in
curred by defeat in a suit at law.

LOOK OUT FOR Hl/W.
THE Republican County Convention of Los
Angeles, which met on Tuesday, adopted reso
lutions declaring for a United States Senator to
come from south of Tehachapi, and recommended
R.. i)J. Bulla for the place. As Mr. De Young does
not live south of Tehachapi and as, by no combina
tion of circumstances, can he be taken for Mr. Bulla,
this means that the Republicans of Los Angele?
County do not want the San Franciscan for Senator.
It is 'well that these resolutions have been adopted.
Every other Republican County Convention in the
State should imitate the example of the Los Angeles
convention in bringing Senatorial candidates upon
the track and grooming them for the race. It will
never do to leave the contest open for De Young.
He says he is not a candidate; he has, in fact, writ
ten a letter to that effect which he considers a flat
withdrawal. But this epistle is mere food for the
gudgeons. It is designed to throw the people off
their guardâ to take them in, as it were, and do for
them.
De Young is a candidate for Senator. His plan is
to sneak up on the blind side of the office and sand
bag it. The people should be on their guard. Eter
nal vigilance is the price of keeping this cunning
Southern Pacific retainer out of the Federal Senate.
We think the best method of preventing the con
summation of De Young's confidence operation is to
smoke out legislative candidates all over the State.
The duty of Republicans should be to make these
aspirants declare their preference for Senator prior to
nomination. In this way the people may be apprised
in advance of the schemes of the journalistic candi
date. The Republicans of California do not want
De Young for Senator, and if he get the office it
will be in opposition to the wishes of 95 per cent of
the party. The people have a right to know how
their candidates for the Legislature, in the event of
their election, are going to vote for Senator, and the
way to find out is to make them declare themselves
in advance. If they are for De Young they should
be repudiated. If they are non-committal they may
be set down for De Young and defeated. Every as
pirant should be put on record. That is the only
way in which the safety of the State can be assured.
In this city the people may be trusted to take care
of De Young's absurd ambition. They know him
and are able to recognize his work. They will dis
cwer-the legislators who are proposed in his interest
and will see that they do not get to Sacramento. The
stomach of the Republican party of San Francisco
will assimilate almost anything, but it never can di
gest De Young. No whale that ever existed would
be able to keep him down. He is absolutely in
digestible.
THE MEN FROM TENNESSEE.
OWING to wanton murder committed by a
soldier of the Tennessee Regiment, following
a series of episodes not creditable, there is a
tendency to condemn as a body the men from the
South. That good men have to bear any share of the
blame earned by the scamps among them is unfor
tunate. The regiment is made up for the most part
of gentlemen./ It is officered by representatives of the
best blood and most substantial citizenship of the
Star.c from .which it comes.
Fof the Tennesseeans who have disgraced them
selves, and especially for the one who without cause
committed murder, there is no impulse to frame ex
cuse. Neither the officers nor the worthy class of
privates attempt -to palliate the offenses, but on the
other hand deplore them more acutely than if they
did not themselves feel that a portion of the disgrace
fell over the entire camp. Their State pride has been
wounded, and they. feel the. sting of a growing preju
dice which the unruly privates created and seem to
desire to keep alive.
It is to be regretted deeply that the stay of the
Tennessee men here should have resulted so un
happily. They were warmly welcomed, and made to
feel that though far from home they were with
friends. Most of them appreciated this, and do still.
A number have proved to have a- hoodlum instinct,
resulting in many encounters and one assassination.'
Even since this tragedy some of them have been
about the streets in such humor as to cause fear that
there is not yet an end to violence. Certainly no
soldier can reasonably find fault with California be
cause the Government failed to send him to the
front.
Perhaps the 'riction, through the counsel and exec
utive ability of Colonel Smith and his staff, will wear
away. If such prove not to be the case the sooner
the Tennessee men shall be returned to their homes
the better. There is an untamed element which
crnses uneasiness and mars the fraternity which has
existed between the volunteers and the citizens.
.A pablic official at Sacramento paid $60 for the
fun of fast driving. Not only had his speeding been
in violation of the law, but he had run over an editor.
Brigadier General Otis seems still to have influence
similar to that of a man who dies and leaves his es
tate entailed.
OUR TROPICAL COLONIES.
IF the people of the American and Asiatic tropics,
whom it is proposed to take in as colonists, are
not fit for self-government, we don't want them.
If they are, let them govern themselves.
The United States has other business than opening
a kindergarten in the tropics to train eighteen mil
lions of mongrels, Malays, pirates and .cutthroats in
the ways of self-government.
One reads the several propositions made by the
imperialists with amazement.
It is proposed that we take all these tropical
islands and either trade them off or hold them as de
pendencies. This raises the question of what sort of
government we have, what are its powers and whence
their derivation?
The constitution creates this government, and
only one kind of government, and grants all of the
powers and functions it can exercise. Our govern
ment cannot govern anywhere except in the exercise
of the granted powers given to it by the constitution.
It has no power given it to administer dependencies,
to send civil and military Governors to conquered
provinces, to hold them indefinitely subject to our
government and without voice or representation. The
constitution gives our government power to admit
new States into the Union. It grants no other power
to enlarge our borders, to hold distant dependencies
or to trade them off to other countries regardless of
the cries of the people. This is a republican govern
ment, which derives its powers, and all of its powers,
from the consent of the governed, for which the con
stitution provides by giving the people the franchise.
It cannot govern democratically at home and auto
cratically abroad. It cannot exercise over seventy
eight millions of people the powers granted to it by
the constitution, and over fifteen or twenty millions
of people in the tropics powers not granted to it by
the constitution. It cannot be a constitutional gov
ernment in one place and an unconstitutional govern
ment in another place.
We are aware that a derivation of the powers pro
posed to be exercised is asserted in what is known as
the "general welfare" clause of the constitution,
which recites that Congress shall provide for paying
the debts of the United States, dispose of its prop
erty and provide for the general welfare. But up to
this time no latitudinarian in construction has ever
pretended that these things may be done in any'
manner repugnant to the powers granted in the sub
sequent clauses. For instance, Congress can only
pay .ne debts of the United States by levying taxes
on the people in the manner granted to it. It can
not pay them by confiscation, by seizure of the pub
lic property of â¢ the States, nor by levying unequal
taxes.
As for the general welfare, suppose, under this new
construction. Congress should decide that the gen
eral welfare required the erection of a monarchy, or
annexation to Russia, or the division of the country
into two or more nations, why can it not be done
if that clause give to Congress powers not limited by
the constitution itself?
The men who made the constitution had recently
revolted against the exercise over them by the Eng
lish Government of powers not given to it by the
unwritten constitution of England. That constitution
consists of principles with their radix in Magna
Charta, in the habeas corpus act and the other na
tional expressions which entrench the rights of man
and limit the powers of government. Because the
application of these principles to the American colo
nies was refused they took up arms and founded a
nation based on the consent of the governed. Hav
ing endured the evils of colonial government, hav
ing been taxed without representation, they did not
confer upon the government they made the power
to inflict the same wrongs upon others against which
they had revolted. They avoided conferring upon
the United States any power to hold dependencies
under extraconstitutional authority. They limited
the powers of this government by grant, not by de
nial; by affirmation, not by negation. Having in
detail recited in the constitution the powers to be ex
ercised by the government, they made the system
perfectly plain by the clause: "All powers not herein
granted to the United States are reserved to the
States or the people thereof."
These reserved powers in the possession of the
States are then defined by negation, by prohibition.
The constitution recites specifically what the States
shall not do; so a system was created in which the
United States shall not do what is not granted to it,
and the States shall not do what is prohibited to
them. Nowhere in it is there a line on which to base
the proposed imperial colonial policy.
Men are in the habit of pointing to the success of
Great Britain in governing the crown colonies, con
sisting of many races. She can do this without viola
tion of the principles which compose her unwritten
constitution. Our forefathers were born subjects of
Great Britain, with a birthright in- the English con
stitution, upon which they based their demand for
extension of its principles to them. The alien popula
tion of most of the crown colonies had not that birth
right, and the Dominion of Canada and the Australian
and New Zealand colonies make no contribution to
the imperial budget. The difference between the
English constitution and ours is organic, funda
mental, in that ours derives its principles from the
Declaration of Independence and grants, specifically,
the powers necessary to carry them into effect.
This statement of the principles of our constitution
will be tolerated by our readers, since they are in
terested in government according to the constitu
tion, which is the only security of their rights of per
son and property.
The application of this statement will follow, de
veloping the only way in which this government can
govern in the proposed tropical colonies.
SENTENCES HIMSELF TO DEFEAT.
AN ambition to be a member of the Assembly
may be altogether worthy. No fault will be
found with any gentleman who may entertain
it and make modest declaration of his hopes. F. R.
Porter of Oakland aspires to represent the Fiftieth
District. He is frank in saying so and in giving his
reasons for soliciting support.
Mr. Porter affirms that if elected he will favor the
candidacy of M. H. de Young for the Senate. For
him to say anything more is superfluous. The most
respected individual in California could not be elected
on this platform. Whatever his qualifications, let him
declare in favor of the candidate mentioned
and he kills any chance he might otherwise possess.
This State will not tolerate the idea of De Young
as Senator. It does not propose to have the editor
who declares himself not in the fight carrying off a
prize which is perhaps the highest gift California has
to bestow. It does not propose to be made a laugh
ing stock, nor to select the most unpopular man
within its borders to represent it at Washington.
Editor de Young will stay at horne â not that his
presence here is particularly desired, but that it is
better than his presence at the capital. Candidates
for the Assembly, hoping for election for the reason
that they will support this man for a place for which
his yearning is a distinct impertinence, might as well

retire. We condole with Mr. Porter. He has sen
tenced himself to defeat. For him to do so was use
less. Having declared himself for De Young, he may
as well consider himself out of the race now as later.
OUR FORTUNATE UNIVERSITY.
THAT splendid good fortune which presided
over the destinies of the University of Califor
nia at the hour of its birth, and which has at
tended every step in its progress from small begin
nings to great accomplishments, was never more con
spicuous, more bountiful or more active than at this
time. The institution, already dowered with a thou
sand gifts, sees before it prospects of greater gifts to
come, and faces a future more brilliant with glorious
promise than any other seat of learning in the world.
The increased endowments of the university
within recent years have been in themselves sufficient
to establish a great institution of arts and letters and
sciences, even had there been no foundation already
laid for them to build upon. Without counting
smaller benefactions, which have been numerous,
there have been lately given to the university the
Hopkins Art Gallery and School of Arts, the Wil
merding School of Mechanic Arts, munificent gifts
from Mrs. Phebe Hearst, and now the rich dona
tion from Miss Cora Jane Flood of lands, buildings
and water stock whose aggregate value is estimated
at $3,000,000.
Vast as these gifts from private citizens have been,
the advancing wealth and prestige of the university
have not depended on them alone. The University
of California was ordained by the people for the ben
efit of the people, and the people have never lost in
terest in it, nor have they ever been willing that its
maintenance and growth should be dependent upon
the liberality of the rich, no matter how generous the
rich might be. Therefore at the last session of the
Legislature there was enacted with the cordial ap
proval of all citizens a statute raising the revenues
provided by taxation for the university from one cent
to two cents on every $100 of assessed property in
the State. Under that act the income of the institu
tion contributed by the people was doubled, and will
increase as the commonwealth increases in population
and in wealth.
The development of the popular ideal of what the
university should be has been as notable as the in
crease in benefactions from private hands and in
revenues from the State. The time has gone by when
the public had no further ambition for the university
than that of housing it in buildings that would be
fairly commodious and weather proof. The aspira
tion at present is for a group of edifices whose ar
chitectural dignity and beauty will give the university
the most superb home ever possessed by any institu
tion of learning. That aspiration, seconded and sup
ported by the noble generosity of Mrs. Hearst, has
found in the regents a sympathy whose ardor has
prompted them to undertake its fulfillment. The ar
chitects of the world are now competing with one
another in devising plans for the stately structures
and the gardens that are to surround them amid the
hills of Berkeley, and ere long the foundations of a
part at least of the magnificent work may be laid.
It is at this juncture and amid these circumstances
of good fortune that the announced retirement of
President Kellogg next March imposes upon the re
gents the task of selecting a new executive for the
institution. It is not necessary to say that upon the
character of the man chosen for the office much of
the growing good of the university will depend. For
the advancement of knowledge and for the attain
ment of art there is more in the teacher than in the
building. That fact is well known to all Americans.
There will be, therefore, a widespread public inter
est in the choice of the new president.
The aspiration of Californians is to have the most
inspiring and influential as well as the most stately
and richly adorned university in the world. The
taxpayers have voted money liberally and private
generosity has been munificent, to accomplish that
aspiration, and now if the right man be chosen as
president the aspiration may be realized within the
lives of men of this generation.
ALTHOUGH it is not likely that the Board of
Education as now constituted will continue to
exist for a longer period than one year after
the ist of January next, it is important that the moral
forces of the city should get to work and rescue it
from the hands of the Democratic politicians.
The administration of the School Department by
these gentlemen for many years past has been simply
disgraceful. In fact, during a period of over twenty
years we have scarcely had two School Boards
which retired from office free from the taint of job
bery and scandal. The present aggregation of po
litical patriots has been more than usually offensive.
Not only have they loaded the department down with
useless school-teachers, appointed for no other pur
pose than to make places for political favorites, but
they have actually engaged in transactions which have
brought down upon them the wrath of grand juries
and called for the services of the law officers of the
city.
One Grand Jury was recently dismissed because it
got into a wrangle over jobbery in the School De
partment. Several of its members attempted to in
dict two School Directors guilty of malfeasance in
office, but they were thwarted in their efforts by the
friends of the men on the jury. Being unable to
indict anybody, the jury was dismissed by the pre
siding Judge of the Superior Court. But the affair
disclosed plainly the method by which School Di
rectors who serve without salary are enabled to make
money.
All this should be stopped. It is more than dis
graceful that a department of the municipal govern
ment which is devoted to instructing the young in
the ways of learning and morality should be made
the football of a lot of unscrupulous individuals in
tent only upon creating places for their favorites or
promoting their own personal or political interests.
It ought to be easy enough to form an organization
which will take the School Department for one year
at least out of politics. The municipal conventions of
none of the local political parties would care to re
fuse to nominate candidates selected by an organi
zation of this kind. If they did so their candidates
would be certain of defeat.
Friends of the School Department should consider
this subject without delay. Even though the time
during which the present system will continue to
exist is short, the end to be attained will justify the
effort. Under the new charter there will probably
be an improvement in the management of the depart
ment, the system having been entirely changed, but
its friends need not wait for that. A year of clean
administration would be worth striving for at the
present time.

THE CALUMNY AGAINST VAN FLEET.
It has been understood for some little time that the Demo-Pops pro
posed to "whisper to death" Justice Van Fleet. An attack made in the
open may be met and repelled, but "bushwhacking" and "Injun fighting-"
present difficulties which an honorable enemy is not s^ ready to meet. Just
this difficulty was felt in the case of Justice Van Fleet. Every intelligent
man knew that the insidious whisperings which were passed from ear to
ear aid him a great wrong, but how to meet, stop, and silence them was
the question.
That stalwart Republican paper the San Francisco Call met the ques
tion in its own way and answered it fully and finally. We will have no
more of the calumnies against Justice Van Fleet anent the Fox case dur
ing the rest of this campaign.â Oakland Tribune.

Joe Jerry hoed in a stony "field,
Under a sweltering sun.
The boy and the rock and the native

Fought for the life in a battered seed,
And the struggle was just begun.
"Get out of the mud and follow me,"
Said the man with the better clothes,
"Against you are vermin and drouth and
frost;
You will anger nature with labor lost-
Come where a fair wind blows."
But the boy digged on In the stony. field,
With the struggle barely begun.
"I put the seed in this ground," said he;
"I think I had better stay and see
Whatever may be. done."

And fitted the timbers true.

"War! On to war"â Â«ind the cry came

"There is honor, or fame, for alii"
"I have a dying wife and these , ..
I shall stay with them if God so please."
But he went at the second call.
"Come on!" they cried; "It's death to
wait!"
Hif face was bleeding and grim!
He picked a rifle out of the dirt
And answered simply, "The captain's
hurt;
I think I'll stay with him."

street between Mission- and Howard is an
open public thoroughfare, "and Â©either the
police nor any one else has riWht to
obstruct the same â¢ and prevent teams
from passing or repassing, except on the
occasion of a public parade, public funer
al, or the like, or when closed for re
pairs. The fact that the police use that
block for practicing tue goose step does
not give them the right to prevent team
sters who may have business on that
block from transacting such business.
CONTINENTSâ A. S., City. The ques
tion of the number of continents that
there are is one that has never been set
tled. There are those who hold that there
are five great masses or divisions of land
us contmentÃâ Europe, Asia, Africa,
America and Australia. Modern (isage
recognizes four continents: Eurasia
(Europe and Asia as one), Africa, North
and South America, and is divided as to
Australia, which Is variously styled a con
tinent and a continental island. The title
Antarctic continent is given to a great
body of land supposed to occupy the south
polar region.
TO BECOME A CITIZEN-F. M., Oak
land, Cal. There Is only one way for an
alien to become a citizen of the United
States and that is to follow the provisions
of the naturalization laws. The answer to
the question, "Can an alien minor who
Uas been in this country more than five
J^ars, speaks and writes the English lan
guage, draw up citizenship papers, if the
parents are willing, and he is likely to
leave the country for an indefinite period?
If not, is there any way that he can place
himself under the protection of the stars
and stripes with a view of becoming a
citizen when he becomes of age?" Is that
no alien minor can enter into any such ar
rangement with the United States or
State authorities.
PRESIDENT McKINLEYâ Q. M,. City.
William McKlnley, President of the
United States, is descended of Irish- .
Scotch stock. According to family tradi
tions James and William McKinley, who
founded the two branches of the McKin
ley family in this country, one' in the
South and the other in the North, came
direct from the northern part of Ireland.
They were predominantly of Scotch de
scent as the family originally came from
the west of Scotland.
WOOLLY APHISâ W. H. D., Coulter
ville, CaL From the description given in
your communication it is apparent that
the pest complained of is the woolly
aphis. Many remedies have been tried
with more or less success. It is said that
the most successful Is to graft on resist
ant stock. It Is said that the following
mixture has been found of value: "To
one gallon of quicklime add a pound Of
flour of sulphur and a quarter of a pound
df Limp black. Mix to the consistency of
whitewash with boiling water. Lay on the
branches when about blood warm. This
should be used when the winged insects
spread from tree to tree."
POSTAGE STAMPSâ W. R.. City. The
number of ideas that may be expressed
by the peculiar placing of postage stamps
on an envelope is unlimited. There is no
fixed rule as to what stamps shall sig
nify, as that, like a cryptogram, is ar
ranged between the parties who intend
to use the same. Some years ago an in
dividual in the East gave out that a
stamp inverted on the rlghthand upper
corner of the envelope means that the per
son written to shall write no more; if in
verted on the upper lefthand corner then
the writer declares affection for the re
ceiver of the letter (and the mail clerK
declares that the party who Placed the
stamp on the wrong corner is an idiot); 11
the stamp if in the center at the toR it
means yes, and when at the bottom it
moans no; if at a right an~le on the
right hand corner it means 'does the re
ceiver love the sender?" similarly located
on the upper lefthand corner it means
that the writer hates the other; the
stamp placed on the line with the sur
name means "Is my love accepted? It

Governor Stephens is not reposing on a
bed of roses since the declaration of war.
Missouri has raised six regiments of
troops up to date, and there is quite a cor

"For the last ninety days I have. been,
receiving at the rate of 1000 letters "a

colonels, brigadier generals, etc., and thÂ»-y

COUNTRIES MAY FIGHT
Boundary Dispute Between Chile and Argentina
Likely to Develop Into a Clash
of Arms.
Special Cable to Tlie Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1808,
by James Gordon Bennett.
VALPARAISO, Chile, Sept. 14.â The boundary dispute between
Chile and Argentina seems likely to develop into a great South
American conflagration. It is believed that Bolivia has signed a se
cret treaty with Argentina to make common cause against Chile.
In case of war, however, Peru, I am informed, would checkmate
Bolivia, leaving Argentina to the care of Chile. This attitude of
Peru is said to be due to the fact that Chile has wiped off $10,000,000
from the ransom for the provinces returned by the protocol.
Chile is now completing her naval and military preparations for
a hostile climax to the negotiations with Argentina.

DECISION OF MR. BROWN
BTTLES AGAINST THE FUSION
ELEMENT.
Declares It Lost Its Identity When
It Joined Issues With Demo
crats and Silver Re
publicans.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 14.â Secretary
of State Brown to-day handed down
his decision in the matter of the con
test between the straight-out Populists
and the fusion element of that organi
sation. Secretary Brown, in referring
to the certificates presented to him for
filing by Edward L. Hutchinson, chair
man, and H. J. Gregory, secretary, and
refusing to file the same, says:
"The People's party convention, as
originally convened on July 12, 1898,
ceased to be a convention of said party
by reason of its abandonment of the
distinctive party name of the People's
party (accomplished by fusion with the
Democratic party) in failing to exer
cise its risht to name a State ticket,
but instead delegating to the Demo
cratic party and Silver Republican or
ganization the power to name all but
three of its nominees for State and two
district officers."
Secretary Brown says that while the
call for the convention said that
twenty-six candidates were to be nomi
nated, only seven nominations were
made.
The decision of Secretary of State
Hmwn. which is quite a lengthy one,
gives to the "middle-of-the-road" Pop
ulists the right to a place on the ticket
with Shanahan as their nominee, in
stead of conferring the privilege upon

Strong Legislative Ticket Nominated
by the Anti-Gang Combine in
Santa Clara.
SAN T JOSE. Sept. 14.â The conference
committees of Democrats and Populists
met this afternoon and nominated a legis
lative ticket for Santa Clara County. The
Populists were given the Senator in the
Thirtieth District and Assemblyman in
the Fifty-fourth district, while the Demo
crats filled the Fifty-fifth and Fifty-slltth
Assembly districts. The meeting was har
monious and the agreement was -quickly
reached by the commltteemen. The Pop
ulists wanted the privilege of naming the
Assemblyman in the Fifty-fifth District,
but the Democratic nominee was accept
able and no wrangling ensued.
F. B. Brown, a Populist, was nominated
for Senator in the Thirtieth District.
Brown is a lawyer and one of the most
prominent Populists in the county. He
was at one time a member of the Kansas
Legislature.
Those named for Assemblymen are:
Fifty-fourth District, W. W. Turney (Sil
ver Republican) of Campbell; Fifty-fifth
District, O. D. Richardson (D.) of this
city; Fifty-sixth District, A. A. Martin
(D.) of Gtlroy.
The nomination of Brown for Senator
strengthens the fusion of the Populists,
Democrats and Good Government League
materially. The Populists had named
Brown for District Attorney and the
Democrats James H. Campbell for the
same office. Both parties could not agTee
upon a man, but Brown's nomination to
day settled this point in dispute.

Hurst, the president, called the body of

ham, of Oakland.
Bishop Hurst addressed the conference
briefly, expressing great pleasure at re
turning after sixieen years to the Pacific
Coast and at presiding for the first time
at a Pacific Grove conference. He was,
he said, delighted at the advance Method-
Ism had made on this coast since his pre
vious visit, and In this connection spoke
glowingly of the great strides of Metnod
ism throughout ihe world in the past
decade. While telling of a Chinaman in
Burmah who gave 4000 Mexican dollars to
found a Christian school in Singapore he
said:
"When we enter the Philippines, which
we must, for God and American valor
have said so, the new field must be en
tered from Singapore."
He paid a fine tribute to the magnificent
work of Bishop Taylor, who sat besiue
him, both in Africa and India, and fin
ished with a compliment to the present
conference and its members, saying there
was no more popular territory in Meth
odist America than that of the California
conference.

received with hearty applause. They were

of Africa; Dr. J. H. Lozier of Chicago,
Drs. J. A. B. Wilson, C. J. Chase, W. C.

NEW YORK, Sept. 14.â A Wash lngton special to the Herald says:
Secretary of the Navy Long is collecting data for incorporation in his
annual report, which is expected to be one of the most interesting
documents ever submitted to Congress. Secretary Long is expected
to make some special reference to the operations of the Asiatic squad
ron and particularly to the conduct of Rear Admiral Dewey. The de
partment officials generally believe the best is none too good for that
officer, and no surprise would be expressed if the Secretary were to
recommend that the grade of vice admiral be created in order that
it might be filled by the appointment of Rear Admiral Dewey.

A special committee on conference his
tory, consisting of H. B. Heacock, E. R.
; Dille, J. W. Buxton, Wesley Dennett, H.
i B. Sheldon, E. P. Dennett, was also
! elected for the purpose of preparing a
history of the California Conference.
A general discussion regarding commlt
i tees occupied some time, and was followed
â  by the presiding elder's report. Dr. John
Kirby, presiding elder of Oakland district,
i was called upon by Bishop Hurst, and
in opening stated that this was his fourth
: annual report as presiding elder of Oak
land, and he was delighted to be able to
: mfike it better than that of any < receding
j year. In regard to the condition of his
district, he reported three new churches
i built during the year, all without debt.
I More than half the churches in the dis
trict were free of debt and others had
greatly reduced their debts during the
year. As an illustration he cited the First
Church of Oakland, of which Dr. E. R.
Dille was pastor. That church in the
fiast year raised about $25,000 and canceled
ts debt. Other encouraging points were
noted.
The members of his district then stated
the financial condition of their charges
and finished the report of Oakland dis
trict.
Resolutions of friendship and farewell
to Dr. Chappell, who is about to return
to his work in Japan, were presented by
Dr. M. C. Harris, and were adopted, and
after the presentation of J. A. Potter,
chaplain of the United States army, to
the conference the session adjourned.
The conference anniversary of the
Woman's Home Missionary Society was
held this afternoon, Mrs. Robert Bentley
presiding. The principal department of
work discussed was that by the deacon
esses, Mesdames Lake, Holbrook and
Harvey representing that order. The
principal address of the programme was
delivered by Rev. C. E. Locke, D.D., of
San Francisco, his theme being "Needs
of Woman's Home Missionary Work."
The evening was devoted to an inter
esting session of the Conference Ladies'
Aid Society, followed by a formal recep
tion tendered by the society to bishop C.
H. Hurst and his daughter. The pro
gramme consisted of introductory re
marks by the president, Mrs. H. Z. Jones,
reports by the secretary and treasurer,
papers on "Problems of Society" by
Misses Davis and Robertson and Mrs.
Grant, and vocal solos by Miss Grace Da
vis of San Francisco.
Assembly Hall was decorated with
flowers, and the ladies on the reception
committee were prettily downed. A
pretty ceremony of the" evening was the
presentation of small American flags to
the guests by this committee.
When Bishop Hurst appeared on the
platform the entire assemblage waved
handkerchiefs, and when immediately af
terward the people, led by Miss Davis,
sang "The Star Spangled Banner." to the
accompaniment of waving flags, the patri
otism of all was aroused.
To Mrs. George D. Kellogg of Newcastle
had been assigned the duty of formally
welcoming the Bishop and most gracefully
did she fulllll it. making her distinguished
guest feel that he was indeed welcome.
The. bishop's response was graceful and
happy. He said he had not words to ex
press his feeling of gratitude to the ladies
for welcoming him so delightfully to their
conference, and he could only remember
California most gratefully always. The
beauty of his reception to-night showed
him how pleasant It was to have women's
societies in the conference, and he spoke
approvingly of their effective work In
their various departments. His talk was
I brimful of patriotic and religious optim
ism and was a fitting finale to the flag
waving ceremony which preceded It.
After this address the evening was de
voted to social conversation.
Matrimonial Ties Severed.

JUDGE MAGUIRE
OPENS HIS
CAMPAIGN
Silver Pops and Democrats in
Numbers Rally to Do Him
Honor.
He Scores De Young, Advocates Single Tax
and Casts Reflections on the Army
and Administration.
James G. Magutre, the Popullst-Sll
ver Republican -Democratic nominee
for Governor, opened his campaign last
evening at Metropolitan Temple.
. To assist him In making the occa
sion worthy of the cause his mana
gers assembled as many of the pinto
nominees on the State ticket as could
be gathered together. These were as
sembled on the platform, together with
a miscellaneous lot of Populists and
Democrats who are more or less known
to political fame.
When the meeting was called to order
the body of the hall and the gallery
were packed to suffocation by persons
of both sexes, whose presence was due
to their desire to welcome or witness
the welcome of the Democratic stand
ard-bearer. Five minutes after Judge
Maguire began to speak members of
the audience began to file out by twos
and threes and by the time he had con
cluded his address fully two-thirds of
the seats in the hall were vacant.
The greater portion of the time occu
pied by Judge Maguire's address was
devoted to a demonstration and de
fense of his acts as Congressman.
Each plank of the Democratic State
platform, which was taken up by him
In turn, was made the excuse for a
lengthy recitation* of his position on
various matters that came to the at
tention of Congress, as well as a de
tailed explanation of some of his acts
In connection therewith.
â  After having gone through the list
of planks in the platform and suffering
the loss of one-half his audience Ma
guire said that he wished to refer
briefly to the question of single tax.
He contended that single tax is not an
issue in this campaign, and then devot
ed half an hour to telling his auditors
why he believes the theory of single
tax to be the cure for all social and po
litical evils. Having left no doubt as to
his views on this subject, as well as his
desire to have every one else become
as ardent a single-tax advocate as him
self, he dropped the subject and pro
ceeded to pay his compliments to M.
H. de Young and the San Francisco
Chronicle. He declared that he had
been vilified by the newspaper and its
proprietor. He scored the would-be
United States Senator, greatly to the
delight of his auditors as well as to his
own apparent satisfaction.
In his opening remarks Judge Ma
guire made reference to the war Just
closed, and by lnsinuationattempted to
cast discredit on the administration,
and, inferentially, on the army and its
commanding officers. He declared that
"deplorable mistakes had been made in
the conduct of the war," and that these
mistakes were "due to negligence and
incompetence." He also said that
"we," meaning the Democratic party,
"are not in a position to place the
blame and we do not charge it against
any one in particular." With mock
resignation he asserted that the Demo
crats were "willing to treat it as a
common sorrow." He referred to the
details of the military operations that
resulted in so much glory to the ' Amer
ican forces in Cuba as "dark and inex
cusable chapters of incompetency."
The meeting was called to order by
Seth Mann, chairman of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee. He ad
dressed the meeting at some length on
what he conceived to be the issues of
the campaign and closed by declaring
that the Democrats have the Republi
cans "on the run now and we propose
to keep them in that condition." He
then introduced Mayor Phelan as the
chairman of the evening.
The Mayor was well received and
showed his appreciation by speaking
for almost an hour. of the things the
Democrats proposed to do and telling
why they propose to do them. He eu
logized Judge Maguire and in his de
fense of that gentleman declared that
Maguire's utterances in the past had
nothing to do with the issues of the
present campaign. He said that if San
Francisco can give Maguire even as
large a majority as it gave Governor
Budd he will be elected. At the close
of his remarks he introduced Senator
Stephen M. White.
Senator White prefaced his remarks
by declaring that it was not his inten
tion to make a speech, but he forgot
his promise. He asserted that the Re
publican ticket is the ticket of the
Southern Pacific Company, threshed
over the old wheat of the San Pedro
and Santa Monica affair, referred to the
stand taken by the Los Angeles Times,
eulogized Maguire and solemnly de
clared that while Henry T. Gage was
an estimable gentleman and his per
sonal friend he (Gage) has no experi
ence in statecraft. He closed by assert
ing that single tax is not the issue of
the campaign.
Mayor Phelan then did the honors of
the evening by introducing to the audi
ence James H. Barry, Democratic nom
inee for Congress in the Fourth Dis
trict; Edward L. Hutchinson, Populist
nominee for Democratic Lieutenant
Governor; H. P. Andrews, nominee for
Attorney General; W. S. Green, nomi
nee for Treasurer; "William M. Hinton,
nominee for Railroad Commissioner,
Second District, and Henry A. McCra
ney, Silver Republican nominee for
Democratic Clerk of the Supreme
Court. After each of these gentlemen
had made his bow Maguire took the
platform and the exodus began.
MAGUIRE'S ADDRESS.
Mr. Chairman and fellow Democrats,
ladles and gentlemen: To say that I am
pleased with the splendid gathering of
my fellow citizens to aid in the opening
of the campaign, and the inspiring enthu
siasm which you have manifested, would
be but to feebly express the feeling which
it brings to me.
We are entering upon a campaign
fraught with much importance to the in
terests of the people, under auspices that
give us the brightest hopes or victory
We come to this campaign asking for a
continuance of power in the hands of
those who have been put forward as the
representatives of the three great reform
parties in California to-day, with splen
did records of State and municipal ad
ministration behind them; with a State
administration which has fairly and hon
orably redeemed its every pledge to the
people; with a municipal administration
under the leadership of our distinguished
chairman to-night, which has more than
verified, more than realized, all the hopes
of the people who with high expectations
placed him in t^" honorable office which
he now nils. We come into this contest
with a fair and honorable and satisfac
tory union of the Democratic, People's
and Silver Republican parties for Urn
great purposes a\<J principles for which
you stand. We were placed before the
people by untrammeled conventions, rep
resenting and speaking the sentiments of
the common peopie of the State on the
occasion of the meeting of each State
convention.
The speaker then nrmed in succession
the nominees on the ticket, saying a com
plimentary word for each.
"On the other side," he said, "we have a
ticket that certainly was not happy in its
presentation to the people of California,
of which I took occasion to say what
Senator White haa more emphatically
said to-night, that it was nominated by
a convention dominated wholly by South
ern Pacific Railroad Influences. Its dom
ination by railroad influences was a mat*
ter of common repute from all sections
of the State from which delegates went
to attend the convention.
"Its platform is a railroad platform,
giving all that the Southern Pacific Com
pany could have demanded had the con
vention turned the writing of the plat
form over to the company. It was turned
over to some of the company's represent
atives very largely, and is very largely
the product of their hands and m_nds.
Every known railroad candidate tnat was
supported in advance of the nomination
by the Southern Pacific Company was
duly nominated by the convention. Be
fore the convention named a man for any
office on the Republican State ticket thÂ»
San Francisco Call procured from some
source the entire ticket that was to be
nominated and published it, from Gover
ned down to the last candidate on the
ticket, exactly as the convention after
ward nominated it."
The speaker then took up what he
termed the issues of the campaign, dis
cussing them in great detail, speaking
successively of each plank and section
of the platform.
Speaking of the plank in the platform
referring to the war he said: The plat
form commends and glorifli-s the noble
services of our soldiers and sailors in the
war. They have added luster to our
country's fame and glorified her flag fend
made it respected throughout the world.
And to them all honor. In the admin
istration of the affairs of the war certain
deplorable mistakes were made, mistakes
resulting from incompetency somewhere,
from negligence somewhere, from negli
gence and incompetency that can have
had no good excuse, let we are not in
a position to place the blame, and we do
not charge it upon anybody in particu
lar. The failure to supply our soldiers
properly with food and clothing and med
ical attendance and proper care is a
scandal that must and will be investi
gated and the responsibility placed where
it belongs. But until that is done, until
after due Investigation, we may say or
know who was responsible and compel
him, or them, to answer for that respon
sibility, we are willing to treat that scan
dal as a common sorrow of the American
people and pass it thus in silence â no, not
in silence; out of even that dark and in
excusable chapter, written by this- 'ncom
petency, written by this neglect t fur
nish needed supplies and care to i -r sol
diers, there has come even fro n that
dark and unpromising source a glory to
our nation that will live in history with
the brightest memories of the war itself.
Out of all that dark and humiliating scan
dal has come the glory won by the vol
unteers of the Red Cros=s Society. (Ap
plause.)
Into every breach left open, by official
negligence, to every suffering soldier, suf
fering not because Congress had failed to
provide money for ail his necessitiesâbe
cause Congress provided ample means
and infinitely more â to the bedside of
every suffering and neglected soldier, to
every camp where privation resulting
from lack of sufficient clothing, lack of
sufficient or proper food, lack of medicine,
lack of medical attendance, lack of nurs
ing, went the glorious women of the Red
Cross Society and of other religious and
benevolent orders devoted to that noble
work. Their history must be written in
connection with the brightest work of the
Deweys and the Schleys and the leaders
on land and sea of ail the military and
naval forces.
I know of no Incident of the war more
touching, more glorious, than was the
case of Annie Wheeler's trip to Santiago.
Annie Wheeler, daughter or General Joe
Wheeler, lived in Washington during the
whole period of my residence there as
your representative. I knew her as a
gentle, genial and popular society lady,
who would be expected to shrink from
the hardships of the camp and the hor
rors of the nospltal, yet at her country's
call she volunteered and went imme
diately to the shore of Florida, eager to
go on the scenes of war and strife, and
she went- bearing the love and pity of our
great nation's heart down to the hospitals
of the fever-haunted shores of Southern
Cuba, bearing those blessings and
tributes even to the smoking hell
of battle in which her gallant
father led tbe fighting and in
which her brave brother followed the
flag. [Applause.] What she did every
sister of the Red Cross Society stood pre
pared to do. What she did many others
who went forth but whose names are not
yet recorded upon the scroll of fame did
and did bravely. Honor to them! And
out of the darkness of the darkest chap
ter of the war's history comes the glory
of the record made by those noble and
self-sacrificing American women. [Ap
plause.]
The speaker here took up the plat
form and Bpoke at length on each part.
Judge Maguire took up the subject of
the Democratic State, platform and dis
cussed Its various planks at length. He
also made lengthy reference to his rec
ord In Congress on legislation affecting
the interests of this State.
The platform declares for an amend
ment, No. 10, now pending to the con
stitution of California, giving the people
of the counties in the State the right to
a voice in determining by what rules
and in what manner their county govern
ment shall be administered. It declares
in favor of the principle of direct legis
lation, In favor of its immediate appli
cation to the municipal affairs. Much
denunciation has been heaped by the op
position press and by opposition speakers
upon this plank In the platformâ direct
legislation, the control of their laws by
the people; that is what it means.
It does not mean, as they contend, that
all laws shall necessarily be adopted by
that method. The Democratic system of
government involves It in its very essence
the Republican system Is a government by
agency, by agents selected by the people.
Ine Republican system which has been
acquiesced in in this country from the be
ginning has given to such agents absolute
power, power not to be controlled by the
people through their terms of office. That
has been found to work badly. It has
been found that combinations of people
interested in special privileges have inter
fered in elections, have sought by corrupt
combinations and Influences to control
elections, and have succeeded in doing so
that they have bribed legislative repre
sentatives in State, county and municipal
government, particularly in municipal
government, in the great scramble and
struggle for the riches that come to spec
ial privilege under the favors of municipal
legislatures.
Now, if special privileges are to be- con
tinued at all and popular government is
to be continued you must in some way
make correction effective; you must re
store to the people and retake to the peo
ple a power that they never should have
abandoned; the power that whenever a
flagrant violation of their rights is com
mitted corruptly by their representatives
in any legislative body, great or small
pie can bring about a review of that ac
a reasonable percentage of the peo
tion by calling for a vote of the people
upon it. That is the meaning and pur
pose of that provision. The referendum
is the reference of constitutional amend
ments to the people for consideration and
action. I cay Jt has not worked badly.
THE SA^ FBAIN CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 1898.
I say that If the people should abandon
their right to pass upon constitutional
amendments it would be a death blow to
their liberties, to their most sacred
rights; that it would be the almost im
mediate destruction of all that is Â«reat
and gloriouÃ in^ their free institutions.
That the people must abandon their
rights in order to secure good laws for
themselves is a fallacy that finds support
only among advocates of special privi
leges. The needs of the people to-day is
not that they shall get power out of their
hands, but that they shall get power back
Into their hands. (Applause.) Not one law
in a hundred would ever be submitted
to the people for their action under the

principle of direct legislation. No; nine-,
ty-nlne out of every hundred laws, when
the legislative representatives knew that
the people could override their action,
would be all right But there would be a
tremendous popular advantage In hav
ing the right and the means of overrid
ing the hundredth bad measure by an
appeal to the people directly. Some gen
tleman called this method undemocratic.
I would like to know In what school
of Democracy that man was educated or
trained who says that any proposition to
lodge greater power In the people 1b un
democratic He waÂ« not trained In my
school of Democracy, and I repudiate his
Democracy.
Now, my friends, I have gone substan
tially through the platform. I Intended
to say a few words on two other ques
tions, and I shall do so very briefly. In
order to escape all of the propositions
contained in the Democratic platform, in
order to avoid their discussion. In order
to shelter the special privileges against
which those propositions are aimed, they
cry out that the Democratic candidate for
Governor believes In the single tax. (Ap
plause.) And that, therefore, the State
would be likely to become a single tax
State right away if he should be elected.
They flatter me overmuch in that sug
festion. They are attempting to fill your
tate with terror as to the tremendous
power that I would wield as Governor of
the State. They are told that the con-
I stitution of California, as it stands at
| present, prevents the adoption of the sin
gle tax. Oh, but they say, with a man
like the Democratic candidate for Gov
ernor a change in the constitution would
be a very simple matter to secure; that
if he should be elected Governor some
how he would at once convince a major
ity of the people of California that they
ought immediately to adopt the single
tax. I wish I could feel that I would
have that influence over the people of
California, (Renewed applause.)
Now let me tell you, my friends, why
It is that the single tax is not and can
not be an issue in the present campaign.
First, because it cannot be adopted until
the people adopt a constitutional amend
ment; and when the people are ready
to adopt such a constitutional amend
ment the man who says that they should
be prevented from doing it is hot an
American. (Applause.) Not only is he
not a Democrat but he is not aa Ameri
can. The people of this State have a right
to adopt such constitutional amendments
as a majority of the people may desire to
adopt. But no such change in our sys
tem of taxation can be made until the
people do adopt a constitutional amend
ment providing for or authorizing it.
But they forget another obstacle that
I would run up against in trying to sub
mit such a constitutional amendment to
the people. I do not want to discredit
my own power as they have conceded it
to me.- It rather flatters me to think
that they are so much afraid of me, but
I must out of deference to the truth
state what the situation is. I would en
counter the obstruction that would re
sult from the fact that my own party
has not declared in favor of the propo
sition.
So that you see the dangerâ the bogie
manâ that the gentlemen ot the platform
committee of the Republican State Con
vention present to the people has very
little substantial existence, and that the
reason why single tax men are not press
ing for such an amendment to the con
stitution or to make their proposition an
issue in the campaign is that in the pres
ent state of education on the subject it
would be a waste of effort to do any
| thing of the kind. Do the Republicans
really believe that the single tax would
be likely to be adopted if I were elected?
Do they really fear that? Or are they
doing as they did in the Tilden campaign,
when they went over the country with
their hands raised in holy horror and their
faces draton in imitation of piety and
patriotism, declaring that if Tilden were
elected the Confederate debt would be as
sumed by the Federal Government, and
they actually secured the electoral votes
of some of the States upon that ridiculous
assurance. Are they doing as they did
in the last campaign, trying to frighten
and bully people Into supporting the
ticket by presenting fictitious issues and
I claiming that the horrors of flnajicial ruin
and various evils would fall upon tne
i poorer classes of the country if they
should support their own interests and
not support the monopoly interests rep
resented by that party? They can fool
the people that way sometimes, but they
can't fool them that way twice, or in two
successive elections.
The Republican Convention did not
know what the single tax was, and most
of those who adopted that platform don't
know yet. They say that it is socialistic
I and anarchistic. Now. it cannot be both.
| Anarchy is the abolition of government.
Socialism is the concentration ot all
power in the Government, of all indus
tries, of all enterprises In the Govern
ment. (Applause.) The one is the oppo
site of the other. Yet they declare in
their platform solemnly that the single
tax is both. Both! They didn't know
what it was at all. They thought it was
something nasty, but they did not know
what it was. The San Francisco Chron
icle comes to their relief in the matter
and attempts to save them from public
ridicule. It says that it is true that in
the Republican platform a grave mistake
was made in this matter; that the single
tax Is not socialistic, is not anarchistic;
that it could not be both. But It says that
the Republican platform didn't mean that
it was. They just put in those two words
| because they were words; just words.
(Laughter.) And they seem to have
made up their platform pretty generally
in the same way. They liked certain
I words and put them In in connection with
what they proposed to do, and they dis
liked other words, and they put them in
in condemnation of their opponents. "Why,
in their declaration on the money ques
tion they declare for the gold standard,
and then they declare for an interna
tional monetary agreement. Now what
is an international monetary agreement?
Why it is an agreement about money,
they say. But what kind of an agree
ment about money? What is it to be for?
Not for bimetallism. They have dropped
that out. They were abandoning the bi
metallic theory in sections; they were i
withdrawing from it; they were clipping
off the tail of the animal by inches so as j
not to cause the animal too much pain;
clipped it off an inch at a time, and so
they retained the old International bi
metallic agreement plank in their plat
form and clipped off the words "for bi
metallism"; they clipped off those two
words and left the thing absolutely
without meaningâ Just words.
Now, my friends, although the single
tax is not and cannot be an issue in this
campaign, for the Republican party by
declaring negatively against a principle !
cannot commit the other party to the I
principleâ it can only act for itseH; yet I |
am not willing that my personal opinions !
on the question of taxation should be
misrepresented In this campaign for the
purpose of creating prejudice. They say
that the single tax is intended to shift the
burden of taxation from the wealthy peo
ple to the farmers. Their sympathy for
the farmers may be questioned, but I
shall not stop to question it now. I
shall attribute the statement to Ignor
ance. Let us see about that. The farm
ers of this State now pay more than 50
per cant of the taxes for the support of
the State in their direct taxes upon their
homes and personal property, and indi
rectly upon the commodities on which the
taxes paid by merchants and others are
passed to them. If the farmers could have
their share of the State taxes reduced to
25 per cent of the whole they would be
doing well. Let us see how they would
fare under the single tax system. Land
values are now assessed separately from â¢

improvements in this State, and the to*
tal amount of the land values assessmentyj
for 1897 was, I believe, $654,000,000â the flg-t^
ures will be found in the reports of the }
State Controller. Of that amount of land
values assessed the city of San Francisco
alone contains nearly one-third. Seven,
cities of the State contain more than 65
per cent of all the land values in the
State. The other cities and towns cer
tainly contain another 20 per cent, making .
75 per cent.
Of the remaining 25 per cent, not half,
nor nearly half, is owned by occupying
farmers; more than half Is owned by spec
ulators, by others, domestic and alien,
who farm the farmers. (Applause.) Under
the single tax system the farmer would
gay not exceeding 12% per cent of the
tate taxes as against 50 per cent that hÂ«
now bears. His proportion of the tax
would not be more than 10 per cent, be
cause his exemptions would amount to
vastly more than the increased tax upon
the land value, and to the farmer the sin- â â¢
gle tax would be a beneficence (applause),
and it can be demonstrated from the'offi
cial records and tax rolls. I am not how
advocating the expediency of adopting the
single ta!x because I will not be drawn
aside from the Issues of the present cam
paign to discuss questions that are not
in Issue. But I do say that the statement
which I have just controverted is glar
ingly untrue.
Leading Republican organs are declaring
and have repeatedly declared that the sin
gle tax would drive capital from the
State Let us see about that. What is
capital? Capital is movable property ap
plied to the production of new wealth.
Now all such property would be exempt
from taxation under the singe tax system.
Would exemption from taxation drive
capital out of the State? Is there any
man who thinks so outside of the editorial
room of a railroad paper, or outside of
the platform committee of a Repub
lican railroad convention? It would
not drive capital out of the State. It
would bring capital into the State;
whether it is gooa or bad it would bring
capital into the State instead of driving
it out. Would it drive other forms of
movable wealth out? No, they would be
exempt, and they would flow into the
State upon the same principle.
Exemption from taxation never drives
wealth out of a State. But they say â
they don't say it, but they intimate it â
oh, It would drive the Jand out. Well, if
it would not drive the land out there i 3
nothing else that is useful to be driven
out. So the utter fallacy of that state
ment becomes perfectly apparent. Tho
trouble with all these people is that they
are ignorant of the subject -they are dis
cussing, utterly ignorant of It; bo ignor
ant that men who understand 4t dislike
the simple task of answering them.
But they say it is a measure for the
confiscation of land. Not at all. It is
not a proposition to confiscate land. The
confiscation of land would put an.- end to
the Bingle tax. Can the single tax ap
ply to land belonging to the State? Cer
tainly not. If it is to be taxed it must
be In private occupation, and It must be
in private occupation under a tenure that
will admit of taxation. If the single tax
Is to be continued the seggrepation of
land into private holdings, with exclusive
right of control of the private holdings
such as gives the basis and foundation
for taxation, must continue to exist. And
that is the purpose; that is the purpose.
But I will tell you what it would stop.
It womld stop two men like Miller & Lux
from holding 14,000,000 acres of the land of
these three or four Pacific Coast States
and Territories in comparative idleness
for speculative purposes, while barring
hundreds and thousands of American
families from the opportunity to make
homes upon the land. (Applause.)
It would distribute the burdens that
are now borne by the farmers and by the
manufacturers and by the merchants
and by the laborers upon their horn. 3
and business and industries over all theso
holdings, including the holdings of the
speculators, and it would Impose less
taxes upon the homestead owner, be he
farmer or the owner of an urban home,
than falls upon him now. . Have you
thought what a princely possession Mil
ler & Lux haye â one of them is dead, but
the firm goes on â have you thought what
a princely possession they are barring the
people of this country away from for
the mere purpose of speculation?âl4,ooo,
000 acres of land, 23,000 square miles of
land nearly; 23,000 square miles of land
extending around the earth at the equa
tor would form a belt around the earih,
or within a thousand miles of reaching
around the earth, a strip a mile wide.
Now, if the Single Tax were in Issue
in this campaign I would point you to
that kind of land monopoly on the one
hand, and to the degradation of the peo
ple excluded, from the land by this mo
nopoly as one of the things that the Sin
gle Tax Is intended to extirpate. But
the Single Tax is not an issue in the
campaign, and I shall therefore p.ass It. â¢
Now, there is one other thing to whith
I desire to refer a moment, and that is
personal. The San Francisco Chronicle
has been assailing me with vilifications
ever since the opening of the campaign.
Its editor, we are told, has assurances, 'aye,
long before the opening of the campaign,
that if the Republican legislative ticket
shall be elected he will become United
States Senator, and he is trying to earn
the place by vilifying his opponents.
Those of you who remember the Chronicle
of twenty years ago will recognize in, us
columns of to-day the old style of black
guardism from which no decent man was
exempt in those days. (Great applause.)
And no decent man will be exempt from
its blackguardism now if by blackguard
ing 'him Mr. de Young can get anything
that he wants. Whenever you see the
columns of that paper reeking with
blackguardism you- may know ihat Mr.
de Young is after something. (Great
laughter and applause.) He is after the
United States Senatorship now.
A voice â He â¢will never get it.
Well, I don't know about that. He will
fet it if the railroad ticket wins. Mr.
c Young has been obliged to state that
he is not a candidate for United States
Senator. It would defeat the possibility
of his being Senator if he did not deny
it. (Laughter and applause.) But those
of you who have studied Republican pol
itics as now managed by the Southern
Pacific Company will understand that Mr.
de Young's denial don't amount to much.
It is not necessary for a Republican to
be a candidate now. in order to get officefrom his party. In fact, a man would
be foolish in that party to be a candidate
for anything. What he wants to do, If
he wants a place, is to go down to the
yellow building on the corner of Mont
gomery and Market and make his ar
rangements and perform his part of the
bargain and he will get the jobâ when the
party succeeds.
IMd any of the fellows who were can
didates before the Republican State con
vention get nominations? No! The fel
lows that were not candidates got them.
They arranged for them down here. Mr.
de \oung wants something. You ask me
how 1 know?
(A voice, "He has got his lightning rod
He has got his mud volcano In action.
How do I know? 1 know just as the lit
tle girl knew that somebody was dead.
In a country town there was a poor un
dertaker. One day the little girl went
Into her house and she says, â¢'Mamma,
somebody is dead," and the' mother said,
"well, who is dead, my child?" "I don't
know, mamma." Then how do you know
that somebody is dead?" "Why. the un
dertaker's children are eating candy."
tL;iughter.)
It is not necessary for one to actually
Observe or to be witness to the contracts
by which Mr. de Young's political or
other ambitions are to be promoted to
know when he has some such movement
on foot, some such enterprise or some
Buch ambition to be gratified. It is only
necessary to see when he smiles and
starts his mud volcano. He never does
that for nothing.
Now I dislike In a campaign to be
drawn Into personal controversy.. I dis
like to feel obliged to answer black
guard newspapers when they print false
hoods concerning me. I prefer to discuss
the isHuos <if the campaign and to lea\'e
Buch creatures unnoticed. Mr. de Young,
however, is perhaps is entitled to the
credit of one thing, one admission: He is
a magnanimous man. He never attacks
or vilifies any man who Is inferior to
himself in point of moral character.
(Laughter and applause.) Why he never
does I need not g-uess. Certain It is it
has been thought proper not to do it. And
for that reason for very many years in
this community denunciation in the San
Francisco Chronicle was considered a
certificate that the character of the per
son denounced was better than that of
the man who denounced him.
For reasons which I need not explain
the certificate did not amount to much.
(.I-.iuphter. ) But there is some satisfac
tion in the knowledge that It was regard
ed .is such a certificate.
Tliu Chronicle has been publishing false
hood after falsehood concerning me for
weeks. It has had in its editorial col
umns and Its news day after day a false
statement concerning mv name. That
n't amount to much, but it is a false
hood. The thing that does amount to
something is that the editor of the Chron
icle knows it to be false; that the man
who writes editorials knows It to be
false; that the man who writes the mat
ter m the news columns knows it to be
false; and yet. that they publish It day
sr'iei day is true. And It Is tfuout as
truthful as anything else that they say.
For what purpose I need only surmise
they call me from day to day "James
Gallagher Ma-quire." (Great laughter.)
Now "Gallagher" Is a good name (Re
newed laughter), although they don't
seem to to regard It. They seem to think
that it implies something that they would
like to fasten upon me for some purpose
of injury to me. What their motive is
is quite Immaterial.
The fact is that with knowledge that
It is false they do from day to day pub
lish it as the truth. The editor has on his
desk before him as he writes and has had
copies of the Congressional Directory ex
tending back over the last Bix years in
which the name in full is given. He has
had at least my registration, if he could
not Jind the full name anywhere else,
Covering the period of over twenty years
in whli h he could find the full name at
uny time if he desired. But he desires
to publish falsehoods. (A voice â Conse
quently he Is a liar and. a coward.)
(.Laughter and applause.)
â¢ â¢ he proceeds to give from day to
day a list of the things that he says I
have done. He says that I was a member
of the sandlot party. That doesn't amount
to much. 1 have known, and I know to
day, many of the best men- in this
State who were leaders in that party
movement, men whose careers are hon
orable above the conception of the under
standing of the men who print those
Statements. The fact is that I never was
a member of the sandlot party, and I
state it rather to show the disposition of
the Chronicle to falsehood than for any
other reason. That in what waa known
as the tandlot year I was vice-chairman
ot tbe .Democratic municipal conven
tion ii .minuting a ticket that opposed the
sand]..: ticket; that in IW>O. after Mr.
ney had withdrawn from the so-
Bandlot party, it is true that some
..stic friends submitted my
B candidate for Judge to a con
n that was called, and was per
haps a remnant of that party organiza
tion.
9 not nominated by that convention
Uid when- the Chronicle came to state the
fa ts in support of its previous charge
that was the only fact that it could find
In support of it, and It made a page and a
half statement about it. The Chronicle
that 1 was a Republican office-holder
â ;-TT. I would not consider it dis
creditable to have been such, if it were
true. It was not true. The circumstances
upon which they base that statement is
that in 1870-77 I was a law student in the
office of Cowdery & Preston; that Mr
Preston had charge of the street assess
ment business, then in the law required
to be carried on In the name of the city
and county. I received a salary of $75 a
!, the work being under the super
vision of the City and County Attorney's
ofh< c. Mr. Burnett, who was elected as
ft taxpayer, controlled the certificates and
the warrants and otherwise exercised a
supervision over that work. During those
years, or one of them at least. I was â¢sec
retary of the "ioung Men's Democratic
of San Francisco and supported the
Democratic ticket from Tilden down in
that campaign.
There is another falsehood. They say
that I supported a non-partisan ticket in
ISBB. That is also false. That I did be
come dissatisfied with the course of the
Democratic party in ISS7, and that I did
ao declare in terms that are at least clear
and plain, is qulto -true, and they may
make the most of the truth concerning it
1 say these things because I think that
falsehoods such as these ought to be at
least denied. I do not intend to have any
thing further to say of them during the
campaign. What they are printing against
me is fither false, absolutely false or la
misrepresentation equal to falsehood.
They purport to be extracts from state
ments made from time to time by me.
You will notice that when they try to be
overtruthful in these matters they put
Btars In to indicate that they have left
out parts of the statement; and when
they are not feeling so scrupulous they
leave the stars out and change the mean

man living read the speeches, the docu
ments, the letters to which they refer,
and I stand by their meaning and effect.
I once 'heard of a man who charged that
the Bible taught atheism, and he copied
an extract from the Bible to prove that
it was bo. He quoted from the Bible the
words, "There Is no God." Now that was
In the Bible; it is there yet, I guess. It
was a perfectly true extract, perfectly
true quotation. Yet If you will go back
to tho Bible and read the context you will
find th.it it says, "The fool In his heart
hath said there is no God." That is the
port of perversion In which they are in
dulging.
Now. I say to them and all other libel
â f nio In this campaign, against their
assaults I place my word (applause);
fipninst their assaults I place the record
of my life in the public service; against
their assaults at this time I plare their
own reports mado from day to day as the
transactions occurred, when they were
not hired to assail me.

BASEBALL IS
AGAIN A FAD
The Great Game Catch
ing On Rapidly.
ROOTING NOW VERY PROPER
COACHING SHOULD ALWAYS BE
INDULGED IN.
â¢
Becreation Park Is the Active Scene
of Real Baseball and Its At
tendant Peculiar
ities.
By Joe Corbett.
A decided improvement is noticeable
these days in the attendance at Recrea
tion Park. While I cannot say that the
park and its performances are in the zen
ith of their glory, still the improvement
both In the attendance and the article of
I ball being played is a fact. In conjunc-
I tion with this much-sought improvement,
comes the reality that the game is slowly,
yet surely, catching on with a vengeance;
and It would not surprise many If the
grand old days, when the Halght Street
Park nourished, would soon be repeated
at Recreation grounds.
Many things indicate such a possibility,
and among them Is the very material
point that, while the crowds improve, the
enthusiam becomes intense. When a
collection of baseball patrons stand up
and howl for this thing and that thing;
when they become so Interested as to
hoot, hiss and humiliate a player, simply
because he drops his bat when an umpire
calls a poor strike; these little occurrences
carry much more weight than the simple
â  assurance of some bombastic promoter.
I am of the opinion that the games at
Recreation Park are attracting the atten
tion of many, among them those who
said, when the contests were transferred
from Central Park to their present loca
tion, that they would never go so far to
see a game. Still, I have Been a large
number of those who so rashly committed
themselves perched in grand-stand seats,
and I never heard such rooting and en
thusiasm flnce the Baltlmores lost the
pennant as I did on Saturday and Sunday
at Recreation Park.
When spectators at a ball game for
get that they are human and howl them
selves into a frenzy, it is high time to ac
quaint ones self with the news that base
ball is itself once again on the coast.
This, surely, is a Tact. As I mentioned,
it is not impossible to discover an empty
seat during the time set aside for games,
but they are scarce when compared with
the nakedness of some portions of the
stands and bleachers as seen without the
assistance of opera glasses but a month
ago.
At this same period I have sat through
a game, and owing to the lack of Inter
est and enthusiasm on the part of both
Slayers and fanatics my task seemed, me
ed, a tedious one.
There Is no enjoyment to be derived
from a game of baseball when those who
patronize it, together with those who par
ticipate in the contest, entertain that
wearied feeling of "don't care a snap who
wins." It was this style a month or so ago.
There was no howling for a team to win;
no humiliating a player who dare Imagine
himself having any right In the field.
There was. In fact- nothing outside of the
game itself that had the appearance of
baseball.
Go to Recreation Park on a Saturday or
Sunday now, however. Why. they simply
stand up and shriek! Sitting down when
a play is close is out of the question en
tirely. Even the players have done away
with that indifferent spirit. You can see
them now out on the coaching line tolling
their troubles to any one foolish enough
to listen; and if the opposition turns a
deaf ear to this compliment It Is not un
usual or even out of place for them to go
through antics in moat cases not becom
ing, but interesting.
Another thing that convinces me of the
hold our gTeat national game is securing
on the populace of this city is the manner
in which Mr. Donovan was treated last
Sunday In the game between the Athletics
and Oaklands. Mr. Donovan, it seems,
went to bat, and before he unbosomed
himself of the pleasing reveries he was in
dulging in, and which, I have no doubt,
pertained to the base hit he -s accustomed
to getting, two strikes were called on
him by Umpire Smith. After hearing the
second strike called the chances of secur
ing a base hit and thereby receiving the
applause attending such a feat became
rather slim, and in consequence Mr. Dono
van dropped his bat, his visage bearing
that disgusted look so common with an
earnest player, and for his pains Umpire
Smith reprimanded him. A second later
the spectators expressed their displeasure
at his action/and they did so In a manner
not to be forgotten. Hisses, hoots and
groans such as are hurled at the villain
during a melodrama at Morosco's per
meated the atmosphere, and Donovan was
but thirty feet away. This outburst real
ly startled me, and It was this display on
the part of those patrons present that
suggested the Idea that the game was
being appreciated at last.
And so It is. The games are full of life
and are being played acceptably. The
contests on Saturday and Sunday, while
not perfect, contained the right spirit. This
in itself pleases the public, for I have said
on a former occasion that baseball
patrons delight in seeing a game where
both sides manifest an interest In the re
sult. This seems to have been the pro
gramme of late, if the games of Saturday
and Sunday are any criterion, and I have
reason to believe that they are. I have
been told by many who a month ago were
dissatisfied that the games of the past
month have been Superior in every par
ticular to those of Â£ays past.
The poor showing of the Athletics on
Saturday and Sunday in a measure dis
credits these reports of a great change,
but, as I said before, while these two
(smes were not perfect there were, nev
ertheless, dash ; and lively action visible
during the contests. This alone is an
improvement quite worthy of commenda
tion. ,
When the players get out on the lines
and coach the people themselves will fol
low with their harangues in the stands,
and in consequence a general Interest in
the outcome of the game is engendered.
Let that dashing, out-to-win spirit pre
vail during all the games from now to
the end. Without it a contest is dead â
devoid of life and excitement â and neces
sarily displeasing to all who patronize
the games with the Intention of spending
a few happy moments.
Continue to coach and be spirited at all
times. The game has caught on to a
great extent, and it would be poor policy
nnt to keep up the good work. Coach,
coach. The people like It.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 1898.
HE ACCUSES
WILKINSON
OF COWARDICE
Kennedy Causes a
Sensation.
HIS LIFE WAS THREATENED
EXCITING TIMES IN THE PO
LICE COMMISSION.
Was Told That if He Took the Stand
Against His Companion
He Would Se
Killed. .
A sensation was created at the meet-
Ing of th<* Police Commissioners last
night when Officer Kennedy took the
stand and testified that Patrolman Wil
kinson had threatened to kill him
if he gave evidence against the men
who deserted Lieutenant Burke when he
was Bhot and killed by Theodore Park
Haynes.
Kennedy is one of the policemen who
is accused of cowardice in allowing
Burke to be shot down In cold blood. He
testified that he and Wilkinson were in
formed that there was trouble at Haynes'
cabin. They went to the place and were
met by the murderous tinker. He was
armed with two revolvers, one of which
he held in his right hand. As Kennedy
approached him Haynes pointed a re
volver and ordered him away un
der penalty of being made a subject for
the Coroner. Kennedy drew his revolver,
but not wanting to shoot Haynes ho re
treated several paces.
"Could you have shot him?" Inquired
Chief Lees, evidently for the purpose of
testing the marksmanship of the officer.
"I could have riddled him with bullets,"
replied the witness, "but I was not anx
ious to have his blood on my hands. I
retreated along with the other officers.
Burke then appeared on the scene and
was shot down by the infuriated tinker."
Seeing his superior officer fall Kenne
dy emptied his revolver at Haynes, and
went for more ammunition. Meeting a
man named Waters, who had a revolver
in his hand, Kennedy recognized it as be
longing to Wilkinson, and taking it from
him continued firing at Haynes.
At this Juncture Wilkinson, who was
pale and trembling, begged ttee witness
to empty it, as he feared that somebody
might examine it.
"For God's sake, fire it off!" he ex
claimed. "Captain Gillen might come
along and finding a loaded cartridge in
the gun might accuse me of cowardice."
"During the examination In the Police
Court," continued the witness, "Wilkin
son accosted me while I was standing In
the corridor of the City Hall, and in a
threatening manner said he would kill
anybody who testified against him.
"The following day we met in the
stables where we keep our horses, and,
taking out his revolver, proceeded to wipe
the dust off It with a handkerchief.
" 'I am determined to kill the man who
testifies against me," he remarked, tak
ing 1 a firm hold on his revolver and bran
dishing it in the air.
Kennedy assured him that he would
tell the truth before the Commissioners,
no matter what it cost.
"Then look out for yourself," threaten
ingly remarked Wilkinson. "The man
who takes the bread and butter out of the
mouths of my wife and children must
die."
."I paid no attention to his threats,"
continued the witness, "until several of
my friends told me that he would shoot
me if I told the truth before the Com
missioners. At the Ocean View station
some time ago he told a fellow-officer
that if I took the stand against him he
would kill me. Evidently for the purpose
of creating trouble between myself and
Captain Gillen, Wilkinson a short time
ago informed him that I had referred to
him as a â  I did not use the
language attributed to me, and so con
vinced Captain Gillen. I was told that
Wilkinson, Marlowe and Merchant were
holding secret meetings for the purpose
of agreeing on the testimony they were
to give, and incidentally to give me the
worst of it.
"They vainly endeavored to have me
attend their meetings, but as I was deter
mined to tell the truth, no matter what
it cost, they frequently referred to me as
a coward and a cur. I admit that I ran
away after my ammunition was ex
hausted. So did the others. Wilkinson,
after the first shot was fired, excitedly
exclaimed:
" 'Oh, my God; we will all be killed.' "
Kennedy further said that he had vis
ited the Seventeenth street station with
the Intention of resigning a short time
after the shooting, as he believed that the
other officers were bent on combining
against him in the hope of forcing him
out of the department in order that he
might not testify against them.
Kennedy told his story in a straightfor
ward manner, and it was listened to with
rapt attention by the Commissioners.
There were several other witnesses, but
their testimony was similar to that given
in the Police Court.

CHINESE STILL
SNEAKING IN
Another Letter Seized
by Inspectors.
COOLIE SMUGGLERS AT WORK
OFFICIALS AROUSED BY THE
CALL EXPOSURES.
Heretofore the Bureau System Had
Been Lax to the Point
of Absolute Crim
inality.
Chinese Bureau Inspector Latham
seized last Tuesday a letter in Chinese
characters, which, like the letter found
recently by Inspector Lynch, reveals the
methods by which the coolie brokers and
their hired tools work to Insure the land
ing of Chinese laborers In defiance of the
laws of the United States.
Up to the time of The Call's recent ex
posure of the lax system under which the
bureau was conducted access to Chinese
on board the steamers at the Mall dock
was easy. In fact, there was practically
no hindrance. Agents of the Highbind
ers' Bureau in Chinatown visited the Im
migrants without difficulty and coached
them as to the stories which they were to
tell when they should come before the
Federal Bureau.
After The Call published the letter of
Chan Tal Tsung, In which he advised an
immigrant that the transcript of testi
mony given by him to the inspectors
would be handed to his brokers by some
white man, the Federal officials aroused
from their lethargy and Customs Sur
veyor Spear issued an order that no per
son should be allowed to visit the immi
grants without an order countersigned by
him.
The following letter was written by a
Chinese on one of the steamers, the Low
Kow mentioned being an immigrant on
the same steamer:
Dear Brother: Sit Tow: The things you
sent for Low Kow to Low Kow and myself
were all claimed and obtained by the passen
gers on the boat that came In Just before* our
own. Upon being told about this by certain
other passengers we made diligent inquiries to
ascertain who the guilty parties were, but all
In vain. We did not care about the provisions.
What we very much feared was that In the
provisions might be important communications,
and if bo, kindly be sure to set forth what you
wish to communicate. Come In person to the
entrance of the stairway and then when you
have seen the parties intended hand in your
provisions.
The old California Chinese who are only wait
ing to be landed act like so many starving
devils and don't have a particle of feeling for
the other fellows.
The two reports showing respectively Lee
Kow and Lee Wo's testimony were sent to you
on the eighth day and we hope that you have
received them. If you have be sure to send
word to that effect Immediately, co that those
two people may not remain In anxiety. Send
word any way, whether you received them or
not.
So much for the present; better news by and
by. Yours, etc., TOW.
P. S. The provisions sent formerly all came
safely to hand. It was only the lot sent to-day
that got miscarried through parties laying false
claim to them.
Fifth month, ninth day, 8 p. m.
CHANGE IN FREIGHT RATE.
A Restoration to the Old Tariff on
Bags Will Soon Be Made.
For some time past a freight-rate â  war
on bags has been engaging the attention
of the freight traffic officials of the vari
ous railroads. A compromise and settle
ment have been effected and the reductions
which have been made will be swept aside.
The present rate of 52.2 cents from San
Francisco to Denver and Colorado points
will be advanced to 65 cents. From New
Orleans the rate will be 60 cents. The new
rates will be of great benefit to San Fran
cisco shippers, as the difference in rates
from New Orleans to Denver and from
this city to that point will be 5 cents upon
the restoration to the former tariff, whilj
It is now 30 cents In favor of the New Or
leans shipper.
Continental Republican League.
A meeting of the Continental Republi
can League was held last night at Sara
toga Hall. The attendance was good.
Addresses were made by H. S. Millzner,
T. H. McCarthy, B. T. McKlnley, Amos
Currier and the chairman, Frank D.
Worth. Millzner was, however, the prin
cipal speaker of the evening, he being
specially invited for that purpose. His
remarks were strong and forcible in the
Interest of the Republican nominees, all
of whom, he said, were men of untar
nished character and standing in the
community, and should and would be as
suredly elected In next November. After
adjournment the members marched in a
body to attend the meeting of the Cen
tral Republican League at the Alcazar
building.
Sanford Will Contest Abandoned.
The contest over the probating of the
will of Miss Josephine D. Sanford, who
died about eighteen months ago, was dis
missed yesterday in Judge Coffey's court.
It is denied that any compromise was
made. On the other hand it Is asserted
that the contesting heirs decided to aban
don the legal battle, believing it to be a
costly but hopeless struggle. The estate
is approximately valued at $500,000.
The .will executed by Miss Sanford was
a peculiar one, inasmuch as it disinherited
her relatives and left the bulk of the prop
erty to Thomas I. Bergin, Andrew S.
Moseley, Professor George Davidson and
Dr. Ellenwood. A ranch of 15,000 acres in
Contra Costa County is the most valuable
piece of the realty.
â¢ DOGS OF HIGH DEGREE.
The Interstate Coursing Club â a
name which the Â« Union Coursing
Park management can now use, according
to a late decision of the courtâ held a very
large meeting last evening in Pythian
Castle. The drawings for Saturday and
Sunday's coursing were watched with in
terest.
The Open stake, with sixty-four nomi
nations, includes a large number of im
ported dogs and some youngsters that will
run for the first time in the All-aged
stake. The Puppy stake has sixteen en

Oregon Educator Dead.
EUGENE, Or., Sept. 14.â Professor J.
W. Johnson, who for seventeen years
prior to. 1893 was president of the Ore
gon State University, died to-day.
Swallowed a Needle and Died.
A tailor in Chicago accidentally swallowed
a needle and died as a result of the Inflam
mation set up by the small needle. Little
things frequently have great power, as is seen
In a few small doses of the famous Hostetter's
Stomach Bitters, which, however, has an en
tirely different effect from the needle In this
'notice. The Bitters make nervous, weak and
sickly persons strong and well again. They are
also good for dyspepsia and constipation.
CowDtfCTO* : I don't know how I would get along if it wasn't fof
Ripans Tabules. We men here on the road are
always in such a "hustle," and get so little timÂ«
to eat and have to 6wallow our food so quickly,
no wonder we have dyspepsia. I know I suffered
with it for nearly two years before I got "onto"
tfye Tabules, and 1 was in misery all the time. I
constantly had pains in my stomach and chest, and
a dizsy feeling about my head. My bowels didn't
work regularly, and I felt " mean " all the time. I
saw Ripans Tabules advertised so much I bought
â ome, and after taking them for a month felt like
t new man. I have a boy who was troubled with
indigestion, and gave some to him. They proved
to be just what Re needed*

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Sept. 14.â The unsettled tone of
the speculative mind over the money market
outlook was relieved to-day by the announce
ment of further gold Imports. Actual engage
ments were announced of $1,600,000 and ru
mors were rife of very heavy additional sums
which are to come this week. Rates for call
loans on the exchange broke sharply to 2*
pÂ«r cent from a high point In the morning on
small transactions of 4* per cent. A very
active buying movement developed which was
In large part from professional traders who had
gone short on the market on a conviction that
money rates wnuld hold firm for a time and
that call money would be subject to occasional
flurries from the calling of loans that would
shake out large liquidation of stocks. The
course of the exchange market gave warning
early In the day that relief was at hand for
the money market in the form of gold imports.
Posted rates were marked down * and actual
rates fell Vi. the price for demand sterling
reaching Ji 34, which la easily within the gold
Import point. The market during the earlier
part of the day was largely confined to the
specialties. Sugar, tobacco and the constit
uent companies of the new Federal Steel Com
pany were all markedly weak. The railroads
tallied early In the day, but were weakened
by the decline In the specialties. They offered
strong resistance to decline, however, and ad
vanced easily and quickly all through the list
after midday. The local traction stocks, in
cluding Brooklyn Rapid Transit, Manhattan
and Metropolitan, were also strong. The In
dustrial specialties recovered nearly all their
losses In the afternoon on covering of shorts.
Su<tar was an exception. This stock opened
off 24 per cent, allowing for the 8 per cent
dividend. It rallied 2 per cent but In the late
dealings It fell an extreme 4VÂ» iÂ«?r cent. There
â was very determined support at and below 12T
and the bears deslrted from their attack. This
gave time for the general market to rally apa:n
to about the best, the closing being active and
firm at net gains reaching a point or over In
many stocks. The grangers and Pac'flcs were
conspicuous in the railroad list. The effect of
the easier money market was in large part
sentimental, as the stock market depression
has been due to apprehension of future strin
gency, rather thnn to actual conditions. The
conviction had gained force for several days
thnt the scarcity of money Is apparent rather
than real and the fact that the payments on
the Government loan are almost completed
gives promise of early relief from the drain
on that account. The Government disburse
ments In the form of expenditures and the
distribution of the new bonds are certain to
result In a plentiful supply of easy money at
an early date. There was a growth of de
mand for bonds and prices rallied In sympathy
with stocks in the latter part of the day. To

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, ' Sept. 14.â Some weakness - was
created In wheat at the opening on account of
Liverpool showing from %Â®94d decline In face
of yesterday's strength on' this side. The
slight reduction at which first transactions
were effected soon gave place to firmness and
%c advance when it was seen how small. the
offerings were and how much was . wanted.
Several items of news telegraphed Immediately
alter were of a bullish' character and wen re
sponsible for the Increased demand that â¢ put
up the price.
New York reported liberal Continental ac
ceptances of last night's offers and also buy-
Ing orders for futures from abroad. Foreigners
likewise bought here. A small cargo of No. 2
spring wheat was worked here direct to Lon
don by a firm that handled a good deal of the
wheat shipped abroad by Lelter during the cur- !
rency of the latter*s operations, and It was I
considered significant that this direct demand i
showed signs of revival. Minneapolis . wired
that 2*c over the December price - was \\<X
there to-day for wheat -to arrive any time In
October. Demand here â  for prompt , shipment
opened up strong, with heavy sales reported
the first hour of the session. . The â  movement
of the domestic crop - was bearish ' as . regards
the spring and bullish concerning winter wheat.
The close was at a gain of %c for September
and %c for December. ,
Corn was fairly firm for a short time and
then became uncompromisingly heavy, with
longs selling out disgustedly and shorts rub
bing in the agony without offering â to cover
much until late in the session. December de
clined %c. â 
The general trade In oats was stimulated by
a good demand and small receipts. May closed
unchanged to He up.
Provisions averaged firmer and closed steady
at substantially the same prices they did yes
terday. Packers were â¢ friendly :to the . market
and commission houses with English connec
tions bought heavily 'of lard. . Pork lost 2%c,
lard Improved 2%c and ribs closed unchanged.

DRIED FRUITS, NUTS. RAISINS, ETC.
It is the man with nerve and backbone that
makes the success In life, and the remark ap
plies as well to farmers and fruit-growers as
to others. The Raisin Association made public
its prices for new raisins In New York on Tues
day, and though they were considerably higher
than buyers had expected, several hundred cars
were sold for September delivery. It never
hurts a seller to be firm.
The Santa Clara County Fruit Exchange has
issued a circular on the situation of the dried
fruit market. Growers are advised to hold
their fruit for the present, as there is a short
age In the crop all over the country and higher
prices are certain.

CONFESSION
OF A MAN
WHO FLED
Ernest Jones Tells of
Many Plots.
COULD NOT RESIST LOVE
MET HIS WIFE WHILE SHE WAS
A CHURCH SINGER.
The Disbarment Proceedings Against
Attorney Hutchinson Are
Dismissed by Judge
Hall.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 14.
The disbarment proceedings brought
against Attorney Joseph Hutchinson pro
duced a sensation this morning such as is
rarely heard in a court of law. The pro
ceedings arise out of the alleged murder
of Annie Johnson a year ago, the divorce
proceedings brought by Gertrude Jones
against her husband, Ernest Jones, and
the subsequent scandal revealed in a suit
over a note In which several attorneys
axe interested.
Ernest Jones would have been the most
Important witness in the case could he
be reached, but he fled East, and has sent
a full confession and life history to Attor
ney HutchJnson. Jones is facetious, and
he headed his peculiar story. "A Short
History of Some Deeds, Wise and Un
wise."' He proceeds to tell of his early
education and his attendance at cnurch
and Sunday-school, but says he inherited
the habit of lying and has always told
the most absuru falsehoods without the
least cause. Regarding- his engagement
to Gertrude Jones, he says:
I saw Gertrude singing In the choir and Im
mediately made up my mind that if I ever
married she was to â bo the one. I knew my
weakness and fought against it, and many
were the struggles I had , with myself, as 1
knew I ought not to- marry any one until I
had conquered my habit. But my love for her
finally got the best of me, and we became en
gaged under false j colors, for I had magnified
my own position most wonderfully. 1 always
was what people dolled queer and did not care
for company. Finally - one â  day I coold not
stand .the false colors under which I was sail-
Ing and! told Gertrude all the truth about my
self and, family, and she helping me I made
a desperate effort to reform.
We were .married. '.I was absolutely correct
when I was married and remained so for ten
years.. At that time we had moved' to Frank
lin street, and I had' taken up with ' a former
friendâ a certain . Harry . Beatty, who was ' a
past master in the ways of the world. I com
menced to emulate his deeds and he abetted
my efforts. Up to this time I had absolutely
tried to do right in every way, but from about
September, 1596, I commenced to go down hill
rapidly, and as 1 drank more I had less and
less conscience, until I was no better than
the lowest.
I never knew to a certainty whether I was
responsible 't or the Annie Johnson affair. Tour
Inquiries have probably made this point clear;
at any rate I happened to be one picked out
as a victim, whether by the lawyers that de
fended me or not I could never tell, but they
were all unprincipled robbers and stooped to
any. means to get money out of me.
From that time my many troubles com
menced, and I had to borrow from whom I
could. I became more and more careless un
til finally -I met this Mrs. "leary-For
â â¢stei combination, a frTend of Franco<rur, a i
running mate to another girl who Is companion
to the older Beatty. Then my troubles were
terrible: but this Cabrerra business Is absolute
ly false. I just hated the sight of that girl,
and how she got mixed up In this affair as a
co-respondent I cannot tell, unless It was be
cause H. M. F. got mad at me when I left
her and got her chum, this Cabrerra.
Qlrls like that demand money, and I was
weak Cool enough not to see the end and kept
borrowing until the amount I owed just ap
palled me. The subterfuges and means em
ployed to ralso the money you are aware of.
I find that since January, 1897, I have bor
rowed about $3700, and I expect It will take
me 'at least ten â¢ years to pay It back, for I
mean to turn over a new leaf and try and do
right and return these men their money.
Accompanying the letter was a confes
sion going Into the details of his friend
ship with Annie Johnson and Attorney
Beatty, who Is one of those now attempt-
Ing to disbar Hutchinson. Regarding his
dealings with Annie Johnson, who was at
that time but 13 years old, he says:
It Is ' sufficient to say that I had become
well acquainted with Annie Johnson and that
about the same time I took up and became very
â¢chummy with Henry Beatty. He was what I !
learned to call a sport. In a quiet way. and we
began to run together. This was between t. .
and three months before Gertrude went to the
sanitarium. I told him about Annie Johnson â ,
and he asked me to let him see her, or I
asked himâ at any rate we met her several
times. - -V. -â¢â¢
I said. "Harry Beatty. I do not think I am !
the guilty party, but 1 cannot have my name '
connected with- this case on Gertrude's ac- !
count, so. fix it up to the best of your ability." ]
So he said- all right, he knew a man in Oak
land who could help us, but that 1 It was all
nonsense about my not being guilty, and I had i
given her the money, any way. and that would
put me In Jail for life. â  I said, 'Harry Beatty, j
guilty- or not guilty, I must keep this from my !
family He said. "It will cost lots of dough;
have you any?" I said, not very much. He ,
said: "Can you get any from Gertrude?"
I said I could If it was absolutely necessary.
I was Just- crazy with excitement, as they ;
made me believe that If It was nut for them '
I should go to Jail Immediately. I paid them
down, all to Harry Beatty tor retainer; Beat
ty is. Beatty. $150; Franooeu \ $150; man In Oak
land whose name I forget, {100; and all their
dally expenses, for which I had an itemized
account from 'Harry Beotty. which Included all i
their car fare, meals, money claimed to have i
been spent, money to' Hulda for clothes and ex
penses and b^nds to get her. out of Jail; same
for Howard.: all the court expenses, copies of I
testrmÂ«ny. buying Jurors, etc., â  etc. They,
through Harry Beatty, charged me every cent
any one of the three spent during the time
Harry Beatty employed them. (I paid In odd
â urns from' 325 up to. $200 'or ' 1300 . every - few
days.) iiy recollection is that it was about
$40 a day on an average.
I am under the impression that they gouged
Dr. Sharp, "an they knew about his treatment
of Hulda, AnnlÂ« Johnson, having told Harry

After some argument by counsel, Judge

SHE DID NOT
LOVE BENEDICT
Corsets and Hypnotics
Cause a Row.
DISCOVERY OF A MEDIUM
MRS. VEF-MILYEA BELIEVES
SHE IS LUCKY.
Warned in Time Not to Let Her
Money Pass Into the Hands
of Her Late
Partner.
Oakland Office Son Francisco Call.
908 Broadway. Sept. 14.
In the Police Court this morning Mrs.
Vermilyea, the manufacturer of a patent
corset, won a victory over, her late part
ner, J. Benedict. Mrs. X Vermilyea was
j accompanied by Miss J. Dwyer, a spirit
! ualistic medium through whom Mrs. Ver
\ milyea says she learned of vie treachery
of her late partner.
Mrs. Vermilyea tells a most romantic
i story, which is rendered the more interest
! ing because of the fact that Mr. Benedict,
j who attempted to pose as her lover, is a
! married man, and a lady, alleged to be
' his wife, is now traveling from Nebraska
to Join him.
"Benedict," said Mrs. Vermilyea,
"thinks I am in love with him, but that
jis not true. We were business partners,
i and while thus engaged he went to Miss
| Dwyer and asked her to hypnotize me by
i holding his thoughts over me so that he
' would be enabled to obtain a financial ad
â¢ vantage over me. Miss Dwyer refused 10
'â  do any such thing, and very properly con
fided to me the little scheme which Mr.
i Benedict had put up. I have not a par^
i tide of love for him and never did have:
' Our relations have been purely financial
: and he appropriated much material when
' we parted, for which I am now suing him.
i He has expressed a willingness to return
everything and if he brings back what I
j demand the proceedings will be stopped.
"Some time ago," said Miss Dwyer, to-
I day "Mr. Benedict came to me and told
me that Mrs. Vermilyea had money and
: that if he could induce her to put It into
the business she could reap a substantial
! benefit. He told me he had tried In vain
ito hypnotize Mrs. Vermilyea and asked
:me if I would undertake the task. He
tried to obtain from me a pledge that I
' would not mention his visit to me to Mrs.
Vermilyea, but I gave him no satisfaction.
' I later told Mrs. Vermilyea o. his plan.
! He told me he was trying to make her
! believe that he would marry her, and that
she believed him. He also confided to me
i the fact that he had a wife and that his
j sole purpose in going into the corset busi-
I ness was to make money. He confided to
i me a great deal more than I dare tell.
The search warrant proceedings will be
disposed of in the Police Court to-morrow
morning. Although Benedict is willing to
give Mrs. Vermilyea all the satisfaction
she desires he does not admit the truth
of the story about his attempts to exer
j cisc hypnotic powers over his late part-
I ner.

VALUE OF ATTENTION.
Professor James' Lecture Before the
Teachers' Institute.
OAKLAND, Sept. 14.â The subject of
Professor William James' lecture before I
the Alameda County Teachers' Institute \
to-day was "Attention," as applied to i
pupils, and the ability of teachers to
ox'-ite this quality In school children. |
He said in part: "Voluntary attention j
is not logically continuous. Showers of j
irrelevant ideas are constantly c.oss-
Ing the center of the field of conscious
ness. The field should produce Its own
associates. Some minds are focalized.
Others cannot be concentrated upon the
idea in the center of the field, but are
occupied with meteoric showers ef no
tions which make them forget the main
pub.iect. They are scatter brained.
"if rtally interested in a subject the
mind will always return to It and finally
learn It. When a pupil's interest is ex
cited by a previous interest it does not
follow that he gives his attention with
out effort. It requires a great deal of
voluntary action. Get the pupil to think
it worth while to conquer a subject and
you have his attention. The teacher
should watch the occasions when the pu
pil lacks interest and then cause him to
lix his attention."

Martin Welch, the young husband who
was divorced yesterday from Miss Lena
Palmtag, the young wealthy lady with
whom he eloped a year ago, is not satis
fled with. the statement of the case as It
appeared in the court. The young ex
husband says that in spite of his up h f !l
flght to make hl6 way in the world !t
v.oulc have been all right but for Jsie
mother-in-law in the case.
Mr. Welch has prepared the following
statement of the romance which is now
ended '
An article appeared in The Call this morn
ing stating that Lena Welch had secured a dt
vorce from Martin Welch on the ground of
failure to provide. As 1 had not appeared In
the court to answer the charge on account of
the pleadings of my wife to remain away my
side of the story has not appeared In print.
When we returned home a few days after
our marriage on the 27th of May, 18J7, a woman
came to my residence In Hn.ywa.rcls named
Mrs. Butte and requested my wife to go to her
mother at once, as she was nulte ill. My wife
agreed to go If I would accompany her, as
she feared the WTath of her folks If she went
alone. That evening I went to her home and
was greeted in a friendly manner, her people
wishing me the blessings of a happy life.
We were Invited to ea.ll the next evening,
and my wife's mother requested me to let her
stay a few days with her as she was quite
111. I agreed and she remained at her parents'
home several weeks. During that time her
folks had endeavored to Influence her to leave
me and had endeavored to poison her mind
with ghastly stories of ill will which would be
brought to bear on her future happiness. How
ever, she returned to me and we went to San
Francisco and were living haTpllv together till
we were visited by her mother, who Influenced
h<r to return home again never to return to
me.
The article In this morning's paper stated
that Mrs. Welch, tired of â¢ââ¢ing; to Induce her
husband to support her, had finally brought
suit for divorce.
I deslr" to announce that I would have en
deaveored to do my best for her and my child
but never had the opportunity, as I could not
Orercome the Influence of her folks, who are
directly the cause of this separation.
I do not desire to make amends for myself,
but being blessed with good health, I am fully
capable of earning a livelihood, and would have
d^ne so for my wife arv' child were I given
the opportunity. MARTIN WELCH.

THE SHOCK KILLED HER.
Another Death Due to the Fuse Works
Explosion at Melrose.
ALAMEDA, Sept. 14.â Another death
took place at Melrose last evening, which

recent powder explosion at Melrose. It
was that of Mrs. Elizabeth Stevenson,
mother of Stanley Btevenson of this city.
One of her sons lives with hiÃ family at
Melrose, and his house was badly dam
aged by the explosion. Mrs. Stevenson
was visiting in Alameda when the explo
sion (occurred, and as soon as she heard
it she was Impressed with the idea that
her son and his family had been killed
or seriously injured. This so preyed upon
her mind that, although the truth was
Boon communicated to her, she did not
recover 'from the- shock of fear, and
passed away last evening. She was aged
*3 years, and her funeral will take place
Friday. Interment will be at Mountain

series of interclass baseball contests In
the University of California was played
upon the college campus this afternoon.

members of the freshmen and senior

their more experienced upper-classmen,
although their work, on the whole, was
very creditable for men who had had no
team practice before. Smith, the fresh

A GLANCE AT
REAL ESTATE
Condition of the Market
the Past Week. "
RESULT OF THE TAX LEVY
BROKERS FEAR THAT IT WILL
RETARD PROGRESS.
A Review of the Records, Recent
Sales, New Building Contracts
and General Realty
Notes.
Real estate showed little tendency to
ward improvement during the past week.
The explanation advanced by the various
brokers for the deplorable want of activ
ity is that there have been too many holi
days crowded into the week.
Although there was practically no ad
vancement made, the market still main
tains an even course; and the indicated
prosperity which began to mature at the
close of the summer months still con
tinues to manifest Itself.
Considerable adverse comment is being
Indulged in against the proposed increased
tax rate of $2 on a $100 valuation. Brokers
are of the opinion that such a burden Im
posed upon property-holders will have a
marked tendency to undo the present en
couraging condition of the market by pre
cipitating it into that state of stagnation
which characterized the "World of Real
ty" for nearly a year. Although no imme
diate evil effect would be felt by the adop
tion of this system of taxation It would
undoubtedly work a gradual change for
the worse and undo what little prosperity
is now existent in real estate.
According to Umbsen's Real Estate Record
there was decidedly more prosperity In real
estate during the month of August than that
felt for the preceding thirty daye. The follow
ing passage taken frum the record indicates
the advancement made: "August made a bet
ter showing than the preceding month, when
the number of sales was 183. The chief Im
provement has been in the 50-vara and the
Western Addition districts. Almost all of the
present demand is in those two sections. The
best class of income producing property Is al
ways considered most desirable when there Is
an absence of speculation from the market, and
this feature is very noticeable Just now. Buy
ers are, however, extremely conservative in
the values which they place on this kind of
realty, and are unwilling to discount the fu
ture. For their own residences in the more
fashionable parts of the town, they are, how
ever, more disposed to meet the views of the
holder*."

During the week there were fifty mort

PRESIDENT
KELLOGG'S
SUCCESSOR
Aspirations of William
Carey Jones.
PROFESSOR MOSES' CHANCE
WILLIAM JAMES SPOKEN OF AS
A CANDIDATE.
Friends of the University Hope
That No Poor Selection Will
xJe Made by the
Regents.
The friends of the University of Cali
fornia are eager to ascertain the name
of President Martin Kellogg's successor.
The resignation of the venerable and
faithful president was not a surprise to
some of the regents. In fact, the latter,
In tendering the resignation, clearly
states that the writer's intention to re
sign was known to several members of
the board. In the selection of a man to
direct the affairs of the great institution
of learning the regents will be called upon
to perform the most Important official
duty that ever devolved upon them. Men
who take a deep interest in the fortunes
of the university freely express the opin
ion that a mistake or blunder committed
now in the choice of a president might
work irreparable injury to the institu
tion.
All men familiar with educational af- !
fairs in California recognize that a broad
gauged man of character, Intelligence
and influence is 1.- Mcd at the head of the
university. There Is a demand for a pro
gressive, up-to-date presidentâ not a man
of the world In the sense commonly used,
but nevertheless a man that understands
the world of men. Any -imber of agree
able and harmless little professors will
uspirp to the presidency. The prestige. In
a society way, of little cliques at Berke
ley will be brought to bear in the hope of
Influencing the judement of the regents,
but there Is no indication that the board
will be swerved from the line of duty by
euch efforts.
One of the regents remarked yesterday:
"The successor of President Kellogg
should be a man eminent for his ability
as an educator. He should possess exec
utive power to compel the respect of all
the professors, so that his leadership
would not be questioned more than once
by any one of the faculty. The man
needed can be found, and the university
Is able to pay a salary commensurate
with the responsibilities of the petition.
It would be a great misfortune to the
cause of higher education in this State |
If the regents should select a man simply j
because he could 111 1 the office to the sat
isfaction of the faculty anu a few of the
friends of the faculty in the board."
Another regent said: "I understand j
that the new president has been slated.
There has been talk for some time that
President Kellogg would resign when re- I
quested. I cannot say that a majority
of the regents have been pledged to the I
support of any candidate. 1 am not aware j
that any pledges have been sought. I
Common report leads me to the opinion |
the the regents who were first advls-d
of Mr. Kellogg's resignation have a man |
In view for the place."
Outside gossip is to the effect that the j
regents have been Importuned in many
forms to vote for Professor William
Carey Jones to fill the office of presi
dent. The argument is advanced in
Jones" favor that he will be able to ce
ment the friendly feeling which Mrs.
Hearst entertains for the Institution and
that if he shall be chosen to direct the
destinies of the university she will en
dow the institution with the bulk of her
fortune. It is npt asserted that Professor j
Jones is a man of exceptional ability, but i
It is claimed that he is capable of filling
the position in a creditable manner.
Furthermore It is said in his cause that
he would be acceptable to the professors 'â¢â 
at the university. They hold him in high I
regard and would accept his promotion
In a spirit of profound satisfaction.
The intellect of Professor Moses is not
overlooked by the regents. Mr. Moses is
said to be a candidate for the presidency
of the university, but his aspirations do
not invite the favor of his fellow-teachers i
at the institution. Years ago there was !
some objection to Mosrs because he In- j
Bisted on exalting the doctrines of free
trade, when the leading men and the
toiling masses of the United States were
Bet king to convince the country that a
protective tariff would bring prosperity. '
Events have demonstrated that i.loses j
Was wrong and the people were right, but
this chapter is closed. Throughout the
t'nited States and in Europe Professor
Moses Is rate** as an able man, a pro
gressive n an and a teacher of force and
character. It is readily admitted that he ;
Is large enough to invite the jealousy and
enmity of several of his brother workers j
at Berkeley. Common report is to the |
effect that his promotion would not be !
accepted with any considerable cegree of I
good feeling by the faculty.
It Is to be hoped that the Harvard
graduates residing In San Francisco will
not be shocked if The Call intimates that
Professor William James of Cambridge
came out here some weeks ago with a I
lightning rod. The attractive metal is In I
position and the lightning may strike in I
nls direction. As one regent expressed It,
"He was brought here from the East to
be tried out." Professor James is said to
possess many of the high-grade quali
fications of the modern university presi
dent. His ability commands the respect
of educators and his ways of meeting men
Inspire confidence. His merits as a pos
eible president of the T'nlversity of Cali
fornia have been discussed.
HOWARD P. TAYLOR EXPLAINS.
Writes From New York a Letter
Which States His Side.
Howard P. Taylor, now in "New York
City, writes an explanation of his rela
tions, with the Valentine Publishing Com
pany, and shows great surprise at the
charges made against him. His 'side of
the story Is as follows:
. ' â¢ â¢ â¢ Shortly after the late fire, which de
stroyed the establishment and almost ruined
the valuable machinery, Mr. Valentine met
me on the street, and knowing that ; I
was desirous of entering business pro
posed that I put up $10,000 against
the debris and good will. I tacitly
consented, and without the formality of a con
tract entered upon- my duties as secretary and
business manager until 1 could familiarize my
Â»elf with the details of the business, assuming
the position made vacant by the forced with
drawal of D. B. Francis. After a brief experi
ence, and according to the statements of an ex
pert bookkeeper, I found the firm to be In debt
Borne $40,000. Included In which were the pecu
lations of Mr. Goggln, a former partner, and
other equally mystical methods of others In
controlling the funds of the house. My direct
Understanding with Mr. Valentine was that If
[I thought well of the business I would produce
â  the coveted JIO.OOO. My few months' experi
ence did not warrant me in investing. I found
the establishment heavily lncumbered, with but
â¢light prospect of future enfranchisement from
its debts, and became discouraged though I
retained my position, drawing an average. sal
ary of |200 per month, to which Mr. Valentine
made no opposition. It Is true that I purchased
on credit stock necessary for the prosecution
of the business, but always with the cognizance
&nd consent of Mr. Valentine, and In order to
lighten the burdens of the establishment I
made a habit of discounting current monthly
bills, as many of the creditors will bear me
out. In many other ways I worked â  faithfully
for the interests of. the house and brought It
custom â¢ It would otherwise never have had and
which Is . now assisting materially In keeping
the business afloatâ many of my contracts be-
Ing yearly - ones. This much for the irrepar
able Injury Mr. Valentine * says 2 have done
his establishment. .-â â¢ . ..: v
"I, was surprised at his statement that I came
East In the interest of theatrical . enterprises
though I â¢ have heretofore : been more or less
identified ' with the profession, â  chiefly as a
tcrlbe. iMy visit here, as Mr. Valentine knows
la -In the interests â¢of the .Francis- Valentine
Company - and' Incidentally on a few - other I less
Important : matters, and I; was not aware that
my connection with' the company , had" termi
nated until I read It this morning In the San
Francisco ' papers. I shall ; continue tto exert
tnyself in its behalf until . I am- officially, de
posed. â¢ â  â Â . â ' \ ,_Â£-, ,- :â  .'â  .

MORE TEACHERS
ELECTED THAN
ARE NEEDED
Derham Accuses the
School Board.
HE MAKES SPECIFIC CHARGES
DECLARES THAT SALARIES
HAVE BEEN JUGGLED.
The Board Listens, Then Appoints
â¢More Educators and Considers
a Noe Valley School
House Site.
At the meeting of the Board of Educa
tion yesterday, Director Derham flourish
ed his hatchet. '
"There are too many new teachers al
ready!" he exclaimed. "Still members of
this board want to appoint more. There
has been a decrease In the attendance at
the night schools, and yet the number of
teachers' for these sohools continues to
rapidly increase. The board has appointed
over 200 teachers since It came into exist
ence â the present board, I mean. Where is
this thing going to stop? The taxpayers
will want to know. What's more, I
charge the committee on salaries with in
creasing the pay of the second vice-princi
pals in the grammar schools from $100 to
$125, without the knowledge of the board.
The committee told this board that sal
aries this year were unchanged. That's a
job!"
Chairman Waller denied the charge
against the committee and declared that
Derham was laboring under a misappre
hension. The salaries of certain vice-prin
cipals had been raised to $125, but there
was no deception about it.
After this breezy little one-act curtain
raiser, the board settled down to its er
dlnary vaudeville turns, and proceeded to
further Increase the corps of teachers.
The following bids for furnishing a site
for Noe Valley School were received:
John Collins, northeast corner of
Twenty-fourth street and Hoffman ave
nue, 12.1x114 feet, $8000; A. J.
Rich & Co. Douglass and Twenty-second

Gallagher, Burns and Derham were ap
pointed a committee to consider the bids.
Residents of the Sunnyslde District peti
tioned the board to erect a school build-
Ing on a lot to be donated by the Sunny
side Land Company. The same was
placed on file.
A high school certificate was granted
to Miss Irene Miller and grammar
grade certificates to Miss Maud Moore and
Miss M. Helle Marion.
The Committee on Finance reported that
It had secured the two-story frame build
ing on the northeast corner of Point
Lobos and Forty-third avenues for school
purposes and recommended that a lease
be made from the owner, Mrs. Rose V.
Morbio, for one year at $25 per month.

HOODLUMS AT A PICNIC.
Three of Them Arrested on a Charge
of Malicious Mischief.
John O'Brien. George Smith and Hans
Christiansen. Mission toughs, were hand
ed over hy the police yesterday to Dep
uty Sheriff Butts of Redwood City, whore
they will havf to answer a charge of ma
licious mischief.
The defendants were at the Butchers'
picnic at Sun Jose Inst Sunday, and on
the way home they left the train at Mill
brae for a minute or so and broke all
â¢ the windows in the station house, drove
the agent out of the place, and stoned
a Chinese who happened to be at the
station. After returning to the train they
shoved their feet through the windows
of the car and created a disturbance gen
erally.
On the arrival of the train at the Va
lencia street station they were arrested
by Policeman Connell, who was on the
train, and were booked on the charge of
malicious mischief. The cases were call
ed in Judge Mogan's court yesterday, but
as the offense was committed in San lla
teo County they were handed over to
Deputy Sheriff Butts, who had warrants
for their arrest. The Southern Pacific
Company and the police are determined
to make an example of the Mission
toughs, who on every occasion raise a dis
turbance and destroy property.

THE SAN FRANCISCO vQALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER If, 1898.
CHINESE WILL
EIGHT NO MORE
Peace Was Declared by
See Yup Company.
AT WAR OVER FOUR YEARS
WITH PEACE BOYCOTT WILL BE
DECLARED OFF.
Ho Vow of the Chinese Consul's Of
fice Is Credited With Having
Brought the Fight to an
Abrupt End.
The war between the two rival factions
of Chineseâ the See Tups and Sam Yups â
that has existed in Chinatown for the
past four years, terminated yesterday.
The hatchet has been buried, and in the
future the Chinese will know no rival
companies, but will mingle together in
one grand reign of peace.
Early yesterday morning a notice was
posted all over Chinatown, signed by the
See Y-ips, which stated that they were all
countrymen, hailing from one land, and
that in unity there was strength and that
in this constant strife they were injuring
each other and were only making them
selves in more disfavor with the Ameri
cans. Vhe notice closed by stating that
in future the boycott which was up to this
date in operation and which prohibited
the See Yups from trading or working for
the Earn Yups, was declared off.
The uotice caused great excitement in
Chinatown, and at every signboard on
wh.ch the notice was posted groups of
Mongolians gathered and discussed the
situation. Everywhere the notice seemed
to meet with approval, and it is safe to
say that there will be no more faction
fights in the Chinese quarter.
Although the trouble originated here,
Chinese in New York. Chicago and other
Eastern cities took this feud up as a
common and personal cause; but Ho Vow,
a consular attache, who conducted the
peace negotiations, said he was sure that
that peace would extend all over
America. How Vow deserves a great
amount of credit, as it was undoubtedly
through him that the peace negotiations
wore instituted. He also published a
proclamation yesterday, in which he in- Â¥
dorsed the action of the See Yups and ex
pressed a hope that the Chinese of tnls
city would in the future live in a harmo
nious manner.
The See Yup proclamation reads as fol
lows:
"Noticeâ ln compliance with the wish of
our American Minister, we will not here
after make any distinction as to whom or
as to what district one belongs in our
business and trade. We hereby abolish
all former obnoxious rules and regula
tions, and hereafter we must keep our
clansmen and relatives from disturbing
the peace or renewing the boycott. We
appreciate with gratitude his Excellency's
act, and wish every one good will.
"SEE. YUP COMPANY.

HOW PRISONERS
EVADE THE LAW
TWO BONDS FORFEITED IN THE
POLICE COURTS.
Guiseppi Giorso and Frank Wall Fail
to Appear and Bench Warrants
Issued for Their Arrest.
Two bonds . were , declared i forfeited in
the Police Courts yesterday, and it Is
doubtful If in either â¢ case the bondsmen
will be called upon to make the bonds

Gulseppl Giorso - was arrested on- July
30 -for an assault with a deadly weapon.
He fired three shots at his son-in-law,
Gulseppi Uccelll; who has a vegetable
garden at Ocean View, and It was not the

to get . rid of him. : He was released â on
$1000 bonds, the sureties being L,. J. Hoey,
935 Folsom street, who qualified on a half
Interest in 110 acres In Calaveras County,
and Michael Hayes, who qualified on a
house and lot at 16 Lapldge- street.
The case was called in -Judge Low's
court yesterday < morning, but Giorso
failed to appear, and the Judge declared
his bonds forfeited and ordered a bench

The other case was that of Frank "Wall,

front by Policeman Ellis on a charge of
vagrancy. He was working the crowd at

A CURIO FROM SANTIAGO.
The Times of Cuba, the First Ameri
can Daily Published in That
City.
A copy of the first American dally
newspaper printed in Santiago, The
Times of Cuba as it is called, has been
received in San Francisco by Mrs. Helen
Holcombe. It is a four-page sheet, with
four columns to the page, and is a curio
In every way. It is printed partly in
Spanish and partly in English. The ty
pography is miserable, Its orthography
horrid, and its English wretched. In the
advertising columns appears the follow
ing: "Le Favorita is the elegant saloon
of Santiago de Cuba, the club of distin
guished youth and all others who want
good service. Please do not carry away
our silver spoons." Among the news
items, as an offset to this, it is stated
that an American who bought some pho
tographic views went out of the shop
with his purchase to get change for a $20
bill, saying he would return and make
payment, but he failed to come back.
In commenting on this item the Times
says: "We can only say to the shop
keepers that there are Americans as well
as other people who are dishonest, and
consequently they cannot all be trusted."

THE SOLDIER
MURDERER IS
UNCONCERNED
Rosser Arraigned in
the Police Court.
SAYS THAT HE IS NOT GUILTY*
HIS CASE CONTINUED UNTIL
TO-DAY.
Tennessee's Regiment Swells the
Day's Occupants of tho
Prison and tho
Dock.
Walter Rosser, the young Tennessee
volunteer who wantonly murdered Hen-
ry Hllderbrand in the Spreckels Market
Tuesday afternoon. Is appearently un
moved at the fearful predicament In
which he 1b placed. If a sober apprecia
tion of the gravity of the crime charged
against him on the City Prison's blotter,
together with its probable consequences,
has not sufficed to bring him to a full
realization of his position, then surely
It would seem that the ruthless, unpro
voked slaying of a fellow being, the be
reaving of a young wife, the brand of
Cain which must accompany him through
life â If he Is fortunate enough to escape
the gallows â would overwhelm him with
the agony of remorse.
But yesterday, with the awakening
from a drunken stupor, and through the
long day and evening, Rosser appeared
but little disconcerted. He slept during
the major portion of the night, fitfully
and uneasily the prison guards Bay, but
before the sun had risen he chatted
freely with the attendants and officials
in whose custody he is about the shoot
ing of Hllderbrand.
To them he asserted that he had no
recollection of the slightest detail of the
tragedy, but his only expressed regret
was for his own welfare and concern.
Indeed, so absolutely lacking in emotion
did he seem in discussing his awful
crime that it may eventually appear that
he is a proper subject for a study by a
Lombroso or some other alienist.
The formation of his head is peculiar,
even abnormal. The cranium is large
and bulging, the lower part of the face
and Jaws pointed, the eyes restleas and
retreating; and while his general cast of
countenance is neither disagreeable nor
repulsive, the expression Is far from re
assuring, lie occupies a cell with two
Other prisoners, but was released at fre
quent intervals yesterday in order to con
sult with frienas and members of his
regiment who had called to see him.
i.Arly In the forenoon ha was visited by
ex-Juuge James H. Guerry, formerly of
the Georgia Supreme Court bench and a
recent comer to this city, and George k\
Curtis, ex-law librarian of the Congres
sional Library, Washington, L>. C. also
a. new comer here. These two gentlemen
consulted for some time with Robber, and
then he was iiandeutfed and taken by an
officer to Judge Joai-himsen'a court. He
sat in the deck, wearing the clothes In
wnich he had been arrested, and after
two potty cases had been quickly diÂ»
potst-u of the clerk called from his list,
"Waiter Kosser, murder." The hangers
on, who niied Uie court room to the
doors, stretched their necks In anticipa
tion, and the prisoner stood up at once
in response to his name.
Roaeer paled a Uuie as the warrant was
reau, but displayed no other evidence of
interest in a scene wherein he was the
central figure, ills attorneys asked for a
continuance, first entering a formal plea
of not. guilty 111 behalf of their client, and
Juage joaciiimden at once lixed the hear
ing for this morning. This was done in
order that the testimony of two witnesses
for the defense, members of the Tennes
see Regiment who are about to leave the
city, may be taken. It is not likely, how
ever, that further evidence will be heard
until after the iii Quest.
Rosser was immediately returned to the
City Prison, wnere he spent the balance
of the day in talking with members of
his command. Lieutenant Colonel Child
ers. Major Maguire and two other officers
called upon him shortly before 5 o'clock
and held an earnest conversation with
him. None of th<- party would vouch
safe any Information aÂ« to the object of
the visit. Ac Colonel W. C. Smith, who
commands the Tennessee Volunteers, Is
a very Intimate friend of General W. H.
L. Barnes, It is not Improbable that the
latter may be retained to defend Rosser.
Autopsy Surgeon Gallagher made a
post-mortem examination of Hllder
brand's body yesterday. He found that
the missile, a 32-caliber bullet, had en
tered the left side two Inches above and
to the left of the nipple. It ranged down
ward, passed through the left lung and
the left ventricle of the heart, severed
th^ aorta, and then plowed Its way
through the right lung, lodging between
the sixth and seventh ribs. The bullet's
tortuous course showed that Hllder
brand was in a stooping position when ho
was struck, and It was also made clear
that he died almost instantly.
A Tennessee private soldier. Polk, who
is said to be a grandson of the President
of that name, stated yesterday that he
ADVERTISEMENTS.
CULtMA BABY
Whole Body a Mass of Sores,
Doctor Could Not Cure.
Tried CUTICURA.
Speedily Cured. Now Fine Hair
And Clear Skin.
Our baby at the age of four months ma
sickly, and broke out with Eczema on his face
and body. He was a mass of scabs. The doc-
tor could not cure him. One day I saw your
advertisement in the newspaper, and I got
CmcuKA Remedies at once. I used one box
of CcncDÃAf ointment), one bottle of Ctrri-
CCBA Resolyf-vt. and three cakes of Cun-
critA Soap, and he tea* cured. He is now
seventeen months old, weighs 46 pounds, and
has the finest head of hair and clearest skin
you would want to see. LOUIS BENZINGER,
Feb. 3, 1898. 2750 Bth Aye., New York City.
ECZEMA OIiLEG CURED
BY CUTICURA
I had a sore on the upper part of my leg that
three doctors called Eczema. Such pain I
never experienced in all my life. I read in
the papers of Ccticura Remedies, and I
bought the Crncriu Resolvent, Cuticuba
Soap, and Cuticcba (ointment).*
The first time I used them was before I went
to bed, and I slept more that night than I had
for two weeks before, and from that time on
it got better, and to-day it is entirely gone.

left the Presidio with Rosser during the
afternoon and visited Robert Davis, at
. St. Luke's Hospital. Then they came
downtown, he said, and together they
had a few drinks. â¢'While Rosser was
with me," Polk asserted, "he drank only
Rhine wine, but he may have taken
something stronger after we separated,
at about 5 o'clock. I was with him an
hour before that when he bought a re
volver at a second-hand store. 1 think
1 can locate It."
The Police Courts had a large quota of
soldiers to deal with, and as a result of
Rosser's deed the Judges were not dis
posed to show them much leniency, ex
cept in cases where drunkenness only was
charged. A dozen of the latter descrip
tion were freed early in the morning, but
thoy were at once arrested by a detach
ment from Company A, First Tennessee,
under First Lieutenant Whitthorne, and
carted off to their camp in patrol wagons.
Captain Gillan and Lieutenant Pitcher,
with another squad of Tennesseeans,
also took nine of their regiment into
- custody after their dismissal in court,
and these followed their comrades.
James Timmons of Compajiy C, First
Tennessee Volunteers, was charged be
fore Judge Conlan with discharging his
revolver within the city limits at the cor
ner of Bush and Montgomery streets, and
hÂ« was awarded six months In the County
Jail for his recklessness. Judge Conlan
took occasion to remark that many of
the soldiers had taken advantage of the
kindness of our citizens to insult and per
secute them, and he characterized them
as a pest and a nuisance to the commu
nity. "I do not, of course," said Judge
Conlan, "include all the members of the
Tennessee Regiment, but there are cer
tainly a great many rowdies and black
legs in their ranks."
G. W. Hughes, Company F, of the same
command, was arrested on Pacific street
with a revolver in hand. He was con
victed by Judge Conlan and ordered to
appear for sentence this morning. T.
J. Keefe, a member of Hughes' company,
at an early hour yesterday morning
thrust a revolver into tne stomach of a
comrade, J. C. Green, and was about to
pull the trigger when it was knocked
from his grasp. He faced Judge Mogan
on a charge of assault with a deadly
weapon ana promptly pleaded guilty. The
court, however, advised him to secure
counsel, informing him tnat me charge
was a grave one, and granted him a con
tinuance until the 19th inst.
Ea Slater and James Snyder of Com
pany L, Tennessee Regiment, were ar
rested yesterday morning in a saloon at
406 Dupont street by Ofncera Owens and
| Nelson. The two soldiers, with about
. fifty others, all Tennesseeans, attempted
to wreck the place. The policemen were
obliged to club the men into submission
before they landed them in the patrol
wagon. Judge Joachimsen continued their
cases until this morning.
Charles Goad, also a Tennessee Volun
j teer, tried to stab Policeman Colen In
I Abbott's saloon. The officer was endeav
j orlng to quell a brawl, when the soldier
! drew a knife and made for him. Colen
i used hie club. Goad's head was treated
lat the Receiving Hospital and he was
then locked up. Judge Conlan granted
him a continuance until this morning .
Albert S. Emmett. a member ot tho
Fifty-first lowa Regiment, tried to wreck
the Klondike saloon at 506 Dupont street.
A provost guard under command of Cap
j tain Beyer attempted to arrest him. Em
mett at once assaulted Beyer, but was
finally secured. He was convicted of dis
turbing the peace before Judge Joachim-
I sen and remanded until this morning for
I sentence.
Johnson, the proprietor of a creamerie
on Market street, adjacent to the Spreck-
I els Market, put up a sign yesterday over
the entrance to his place which boVe the
I legend: "The patronage of Tennessee
J soldiers is not desired here. Don't offer
i it." A large crowd assembled and John
; son removed the sign at the request of
the police, who considered the challenge
for trouble too Inviting. Charles Forrest,
a window cleaner employed by Johnson,
while at work in front of the 'creamerie,
was attacked by four Tennessee somiers
and brutally beaten before the police res
cued him. The quartet of the "first fam
ilies" of Tennessee were lugged off to the
City Prison. They will appear in court
this morning.
The killing of Hllderbrand by Hospital
Steward Rosser of the Tennessee Regi
ment was the sole topic of conversation
among the soldiers at the Presidio yes
terday. In the murderer's own regiment
only words of regret at the affair were to
! be heard among the men and the officers
Every man deplores the tragedy and at
tributes Roeser's act to the fact that at
the time he was under the influence of
liquor.
The civil authorities will have, entire
jurisdiction in the matter. General Miller
said yesterday that the military authori
ties would in no way attempt to
interfere, and this was confirmed
by Colonel Smith. The tragedy will
have the effect of curtailing tne
liberties of the Tennessee men. Colonel
Smith said that he had the matter under
consideration but that he was not pre
pared to state just how this would be
done. Only eight passes from each com
pany are allowed a day, and it is thought
that some method will be adopted so as
to prevent these men from going into the
city with the same frequency as hereto
fore.
I On Tuesday night a number of the Ten
nessee men who were rounded up by the
patrol sent out by Colonel Smith "were
! confined in the pnardhouse at the Pre
' sidio. Yesterday morning they were
: searched before being sent back to their
' regiment, and a bowie-knife, a box of pls
â  tol cartridges and a flask of whisky were
found upon them.
It hn.s been ascertained that i-opspr is
I not a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity,
as has been stated. He is, however, a

speeches, which won the applause of all.
He refuted all the arguments of the anti

WHERE IS THE
G. F. MANSON?

Given Up as Lost.
CHANCES IN REINSURANCE
THE OVERDUE F9RTHBANK HAS
ARRIVED AT PORTLAND.
The Naval Reserve Men Who Re
signed to Enlist Are Not
Given the Positions
They Left.
Another overdue vessel has been heard
from, and the gamblers in reinsurance are
correspondingly elated, rhe British bark
Officers of the Geo. F. Manson.
Forthbank from Sicily for Portland, Or.,
has been 211 days out and 50 per cent re-
Insurance was being paid on her. Yes
terday she arrived off the mouth of the
Columbia River, so all doubts as to her
safety were set at rest.
The arrival of the Forthbank will offset
the probable loss of the American bark
George F. Manson, now out 134 days from
Sydney, N. S. W., for this port. Ship
owners and underwriters are now pretty
well satisfied that she went down in the
great Btorm that wrought such havoc on
the coast of Australia a little over four
months ago. So sure are the underwrit
ers that she is gone that they are offering
80 per cent to reinsure the vessel and
cargo, with no takers.
Captain Peter Crack of the Manson and
his son, Peter Crack Jr., first mate of the
bark, are well known in San Francisco.
Ever since the vessel came from the Kast
A VERY SUSPICIOUS NEIGHBOR.
The Charles E. Moody left Philadelphia for San Francisco two days after the declaration of war and
her crew lived in constant fear of being captured by a Spanish cruiser during the voyage. A warship crept up
on the ship one night and the crew made sure it was r. Spanish man-of-war. After taking a look at the
American the warshiD disam>eared, much to the joy of everybody on the Moody.
to this coast Captain Crack has been in
command of her, being the principal own
er. Before he took charge of the Manson
Captain Crack was with the schooner Al
calde and other coasters for years. His
family live in the Mission, and they have
not given up hope of the Manson turning
up all right. One thing in favor of. their
views is the long passages the sugar fleet
is making from Honolulu. , ,
The barkentine Morrfing Star, which
arrived. Tuesday night, was 3S days com
ing up. In his report Captain Bray says:
"It has been a slow and persistent
struggle to work to the eastward. The
yards have been to the backstays most
of the trip. The dead calms of the lias
sage have run up to 10 days 18 hours. The
sea nas been calm throughout, and we
never had a fresh breeze or squall."
The crew of the Morning Star say they
sympathized with the Ancient Mariner
when he talked about his craft being
"a3 idle as a painted ship upon a paint
ed ocean," that being their predicament
to a nicety.
If then the Manson escaped the great
Australian storm and has reached the vi
cinity of Hawaii, ht>r long voyage may
be due to the weather described by Cap
tain Bray.
Captain C. Miner Goodall returned from
Coos Bay yesterday on the steamer Em
pire. The torpedo "boat destroyer Farra
gut will consequently have her final trials
the early part of next week.
The boys of the Naval Battalion are to
give an exhibition gun drill in the Me
chanics' Pavilion Saturday night week.
The proceeds are to be given to the fam
ily of the late Captain Richter, who was
killed while so gallantly leading his men
into battle at Manila.
The battalion, as a whole, has a griev
ance. When the call for volunteers was
made many of the members left their
work and manned the purchased steam
ers Irocjuois, Vigilant and Active. A
number of these were from the Union
Iron Works, and they as well as the oth
ers say they were promised their old
places as soon as the war was over.
When the volunteers on the Iroquols,
Vigilant and Active were mustered out of
Unrie Sam's service a few weeks ago
they at once applied for their former
positions. Nearly all of them are back
at work again, but the Union Iron Works
has Informed Its late employes that there
are ro vacancies at present.
Thebarkentine Morning Star, which ar
rived from Honolulu Tuesday night,
brought up four stowaways. One of these
was a Japanese and the others deserting
volunteers. They refused to give their
names to Captain Bray, and got ashore
as soon as possible after the barkentine
dropped anchor.
REFUSED FIRE ALARM
BOXES AT HIGH PRICES
SULLIVAN NIPPED A FAT JOB
IN THE BUD.
Contractors Planned to Charge the
City Almost Double the
Market Prices for Ap
pliances.
"You may count on me to wppose you
at every turn," was the suggestive re
mark that Fire Chief Sullivan made yes
terday to R. A. Rose, representative of
the Gamewell FTTe Alarm Telegraph Com
pany.
"That is Just what I said to him," re
marked the Cnief. "His company is try
ing to make the city pay what I con
sider an excessive price for new fire
alarm boxes. Tne Supervisors recently
received bids for 100 boxes and two bids
came inâ one from the Gamewell people
and the other from the United States
Company. Both were for keyless boxes,
and the same figure was namedâ sl2s
apiece. I told Mr. Rose that it had come
to my knowledge that the Gamewell con
cern was selling the same box to other
parties for $100. He admitted the fact,
but said that he thought 1 was his friend.
I told him that 1 was on tho basis of $100
per box to the city, but not on the $125
schedule. He then declared that the
company could not see its way clear to
cell to San Francisco at $100 per box. The
interview broKe off with the statement
from me that I should oppose the letting
of the contract. It is my understanding
that the United States Company and the
Gamewell are practically one and the
came, although they bid under two dif
ferent names. I do not see any reason
why the city should give v -.500 for iOO
boxes when they are not worth over haJf
that sum. In the past, but at different
times, the city has purchased 260 of these
boxes at the high price demanded by the
company. That was before I learned that
a cheaper rate was quoted to other cus
tomers. It isn't fair to San Francisco to
charge the top price."
Superintendent W. R. Hewitt of the
Police and Fire Alarm Telegraph coincid
ed with Chief Sullivan. "We can get
along without the 100 boxes rather than
pay the fancy price demanded by the
Gamewell people," he saia. "In fact, I
am thinking of making all of the fire
alarm boxes needed in future in the city
Fhops. It can be done without infringing
any patent. We can make a good keyless
box for $65, the same as the bidders want
to sell us for $i 25."

tle chance that it will be changed.
When the committee of the whole met
yesterday Supervisor Rottanzi, as chair
man of the Finance Committee, occupied
the chair. Supervisor Clinton, in accord
ance with his previous announcement,
presented a resolution that the local tax
rate be limited to $1.15. He stated that the
sum derived would be ample to conduct
the affairs of the city upon an honest and
Intelligent basis.
"1 do not believe," said Clinton, "that
there was any basis for the recent charge
that this board intended to foist a $2.10
tax rate upon the citizens. The statement
was calculated to damage business inter
ests. The members of tnis board have a
chance to go on record and disprove the
assertion, and I think they will do it."
Supervisor Dodge stated that in his opin
ion it was Impossible to keep the pledges
that had been made by the Supervisors to
conduct the city's affairs on a one-dollar
basis. He thought that the citizens would
be satlniigd wltn fair taxation, due econ
omy being exercised.
Supervisor liritt wanted the Clinton res
olution to go over until the committee had
listened to the petitions of the various
Improvement Clubs and the heads of the
city departments, concerning needed ap
propriations.
Supervisor Clinton offered no objection
to tne passing of his resolution for the
time being and it was laid over.
Horace Davis and Collin M. Boyd ad
dressed the Supervisors concerning the
needs of the Free Public Library. They
urged that the appropriation be fixed at
$ub,200. Davis stated that 600,000 books
had been circulated last year, and that in
order to keep me institution on its feet
$46,000 was needed for salaries, $2000 for
skylights and $7750 for books. Incidentals
would bring the amount up to the figure
asked.
Chief Sullivan of the Fire Department
asked for fSZLbuU. and finally said that,
although this was a cut of JiiOOO as com
pared with the previous year, he would
manage to cut still further, down to $600,
000, if the board thought it was absolutely
necessary, In order to keen down taxes.
"How about the recent statement in
The Call that there are too many expen
sive hydrants?" demanded Supervisor
Britt.
"There is use for ail of them," respond
ed the Chief. "In case of a second or
third alarm of fire we would need all the
water that could be had."
"The trouble isn't that there are too
many hydrants uowntown," remarked
Auditor Broderick, "but that they crown
every hilltop out in the suburbs. That is
where the waste money comes in.
Every fellow who moves out on a rocky
knob in the far distance immediately pe
titions for the city to supply him with
firo protection and he gets it, regardless
of cost. Wh v there Is any number of
hydrants stuck around in the gullies out
back of town."
Mr. Britt concluded the cateshism of
the Chief by asking: "Then you don't
think that the Fire Committee of the
Supervisors has stolen much from the
city?"
"1 don't think it uas had a chance," re
sponded the head of the Fire Department.
The next subject for consideration was
the appropriation for the City and County
Hospital, and here the doctors on the
board combined for an energetic attack
on the health officials. Dr. Dodge said:
"The patients in the hospital must oe
better cared for. It is not for me to criti
cize the way in which the Board of
Health spends its money, but I do know i
that there is no city In the country where
the hospital Is so sadly neglected. In 1891
the salaries In the City and County Hos
pital amounted to $29,989, while in 1898 tne
sum total is $34,692. This is an increase of
$4073. In IS9I the total number of Inmates
was 358, as against 522 In 1898. The amount
of money used for maintenance, outside
of salaries, in 1&91 was $145 20 yearly per
capita. In IS9B this per capita was re
duced to $95 40, a reduction of 33 per cent
In other words, while the salaries have
been increased, the money spent for the
food of patients and internes has been
reduced in amount. There has been cur
tailment in the expenditures for delica
cies for the sick. I object to this sort
of thing, and insist that the hospital pa
tients ought not to be stinted in their
food. If the present salaries must be
maintained, the Supervisors will have to
grant a larger appropriation, so as to
have something left for the sick "
This arraignment started Dr. Clinton
and he made a few allegations about the
mismanagement of the Board of Hean.h
and its alleged extravagance in appoint
ing food and other inspectors and a lone
list of bacteriologists, mlcroscopists etc
At the afternoon session of the com
mittee the Health Office came in for a
general scoring by Rottanzi and Clinton
and the non-medical members of me
board listened with evident interest
There was apparently very little left of
the Board of Health when Clinton and
Rottanzi finished, and the indications are
that there will be a cut in the appropria
tion of money for the health officials
A recess was taken until Saturday at 10
a. m., when _ the Finance Committee will
be expected to fix the figure.

WITH THE
PLAYERS
The Shakespearian performance given
at the Baldwin Theater last evening
would better be entitled "Lady Mac
beth," for Macbeth himself, as played
by Mr. Herman, was a subsidiary
and indefinite figure. The honors of the
night were entirely Modjeska's. Lady
Macbeth is not one of her greatest roles.
It would seem beyond nature for an
actress to embody such a Mary Stuart
as Modjeska's and yet attain to the he
roic severity of Lady Macbeth. And still
there are moments of repressed intensity
(in the dagger and sleep-walking scenes,
for example; in which she gives tht
part a most poignant reality; and in spite
of the differences between her tempera
ment and the heavy obligations of the
character, there is never a moment in
which she is not an artist and entirely
consistent in her interpretation. The
portrayal is intensely imaginative and
tnrillingâ but it is as though Patti should
essay lirunhllde.
With the exception of Mr. Herman,
who was really not of this earth in his
ranting and turning, the company did
very well; especially Mr. Lonergan in
Macduff, which was even better given
than during the last engagement. "Mary
Stuart" will be played again to-morrow
night, "Camille" Friday night, and "As
You Like It" at the Saturday matinee.
"Macbeth" will be repeated Saturday
night. "Adrienne" will open the new
week, but the big event is "Antony and
Cleopatra," commencing Wednesday
night, in which production Modjeska
maites her nrst appearance as the Egyp
tian seductress.
A young daughter of California who
is now known to the stage a* Nance
O'Nell, and who has met with prodigious
favor from the Eastern critics during this
and last season, will appear at the Co
lumbia Monday night in "Leah the For
saken." McKee Kankin, Herbert, Carr,
Henry Weaver Jr., Lionel Barry more and
other well-known players are of the com
pany. In the meantime "A Milk White
Flag" is proving a still prosperous card.
At the New Comedy Theater "Woman's
Wit" was retired from the bill last night
in favjr of "The Leading Man," another
and a better comedy 01 .Airs. Pacheco,
which will finish out the week. Marry
Corson Clarke comes to thia theater on
Monday in the admirable farce, "vVhat
Happened to Jones."
"The First Born," preceded by the para
doxically named farce, "The Tragedy,"
still holds Its interest for the patrons at
the Alcazar. The Chinese play will be
given its final performances next week,
in conjunction with "Liend Ale Your
Wife."
"Traviata" will be repeated at the Tivoll
to-night and given again at the Saturday
matinee and the Sunday evening perform
ance. "Carmen," with De Vries as the
toreador, Is the bill for Friday and Satur
day nights. "The Queen of Sheba" will
be given next week for the nrst time here.
Morosco's is doing the usual big busi
ness with "The Land of the Living," a
melodrama of huge sensation.
Felix Morris, Bessie Bonehill and other
stars offer a splendid vaudeville entertain
ment at the Orpheum. The cake walk is
but one of many novel acts at the Al
hambra, where Mr. and Mrs. Sydney
Drew are still a strong card. Animals,
reptiles, the American Anna Held and the
bull fight are part of the bill at the
Chutes. The Olympia, too, offers vaude
ville In large variety.
A concert that promises to be of ppecial
interest will be given at the Sherman-Clay
Hall to-night, when Kathleen Parlow a
young miss of 7 years, and locally re
puted to be a genius, will play the violin
The vocal music will be furnished by tne
Press Club quartet.
CRICKET MATCHES PLANNED.
An Alphabetical Game May Be
Played Next Month for
Charity.
At a meeting of the California Cricket
Association held yesterday It was decided
that, in making up the the batting and
bowling averages for the Burnell prizes,
all matches held "under the auspices" of
the association during the season of 1898
be taken into consideration; but that, In
order to be eligible^ as a competitor, a
member of one of "the city clubs must
have batted or bowled in not fewer than
eight Innings, and a member of a coun
try club In not fewer than five innings.
On September 18 and 25 a match will
be played on the Alameda ground be
tween teams representing the cities of
San Francisco and Alameda, the former
to be selected by R. B. Hogue, and the
latter by H. Ward. The match will be
under the auspices of the association.
Cecil Gardner, a well-known cricketfr
of Santa Clara County, has suggested
that a game, to be called the "Alpha
betical Cricket Match," should be played
before the end of the season on an in
closed ground, admission to be charged
and the proceeds given to the British
Benevolent Association or some other
deserving charity. Invitations to take
part In the game to be sent to all well
known cricketers in the State, and the
teams to be selected by a committee ap
pointed by the association; players whose
names begin with any letter from A to
L. to constitute one team, and the bear
ers of names commencing with any letter
fom M to Z to form the other ejeven. Be
fore definitely accepting this suggestion
It was decided to ascertain whether o*
not the cricketers of Placer County pro
pose to visit San Francisco before the I
end of the present season. In making up j
the schedule of the association for 189S ;
the month of October was left open for
engagements with country cricketing
teams visiting San Francisco.
"\tfieger Buried aa a Pauper.
Charles Wieger, the dry-goods clerk
from Sacramento who poisoned himself
In Golden Gate Park a few days ago, was
burled in the potters 1 field by the city
authorities last Tuesday afternoon. It
was not practicable to hold the body any
longer, and up to yesterday afternoon no
inquiry had been made at the Coroner's
office. Yesterday Charles M. Coghlan,
clerk of the State Board of Equalization
at Sacramento, telegraphed an inquiry aa
to the disposition of the body.
A Baby Suffocated.
The body of Francis O'Neil, the three
months'-did babe of Mr. and Mrs. Frank
O'Nell of 1909 McAllister street, was
brought to the Morgue yesterday morn
ing, the infant having been accidentally
suffocated during the night while sleeping
between the parents.
