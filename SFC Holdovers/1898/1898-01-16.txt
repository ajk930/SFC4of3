WEYLER CONSPIRES
WITH THE CARLISTS.
MADRID, Jan. lo.â lt has come to light that the recent riots In
Cuba are the outcome of a preconceived conspiracy worked from here,
the object beinjr t>> show that autonomy 1Â« unpopular, to turn out the
Liberal Government, and to restore General TVeyler to Cuba, with Ro-
Etobledo as Prime Minister. In case of intervention, which wag
counted upon as a possibility, the conspirators looked with equa
nimity on a disastrous national rising and the fall of the dynasty, with
the ("arlists arriving to restore order.
Senor Robledo, foiled, is now preparing an address to the Queen
Repent, to which he will attach his name, asking that the present
B hf called and giving as a reason the discontent evinced In
against autonomy and probably suggesting 1 a reactionary regime
and Genernl Wevler's return to Cuba.
In Governmental circled here, much h'>pe is based upon the United
States being favorable toward influencing the insurgents to pause in
their activity and give the Cubans a chance of saying whether or not
they wish for autonomy. The Government has staked its exi?'
iip^n the id^a that autonomy means peace and hopes that recent reve
lations of the opponents of autonomy will show they are the enemies
of America, as of the Liberal Spanish policy.
This evening thousands of cards are being circulated wherever peo
ple gather. The front picture shows General Weyler, covered with dec
orations and In full uniform, bearing the flag of Spain and an olive
branch, on which is inscribed the words, "Viva Weyler; retrato con sor
presa." The back Is apparently blank, but when held to the light it
shows the figure of Don Carlos on a magnificent charger, with the
words, "Dios Patria y Rey." This tells the whole tale.
NEW YORK. Jan. 15.â Count
de Pen&losa was a passenger on
board the steamer La Gascogne
when she sailed to-day for
Havre. The Count, who came to
this country about two months
ago a* thf avowed ajrc-nt of Don
Carlos, pretender to the Spanish
throne, has spent the most of his
time while here in visiting arms
manufactories in the East. He
has frequently put forward the
prediction that within the year
Don Carlos will be the acknow
ledged King of Spain.
HAVANA, Jan. 15. â Havana to-day is
at least outwardly calm, after three
days of tumult and threatened conflict
between the populace, backed by the
suppressed sympathy of volunteers,
and Governor-General Blanco. At no
time during these trying days has
there been any indication of immediate
danger to the lives of Americans. Al
though I have been present at every
collision between the troops and the
people, I have not heard a single anti-
American outcry.
While the disorder has been persist
ent, the rioting has not been of a very
, violent type, as evidenced by the fact
-that no liven have beeÃ lost and but
â¢ few persons wounded, an* the destrvc
tion of proptrty has been trifling. It
te truÂ« that the significance of the sit
uation lies In the fact that the violence
of the mob, unarmed as it has been,

and at no time numerically formidable,
is beyond visible expression a protest
against General Blanco's rule and the
newly implanted autonomical regime,
which is prevalent not only among the
populace and the volunteers, but in the
army itself.
Although quiet now reigns, there is
only too great reason to fear that the
end has not yet come. What the Gov
ernment fully realizes is that the mob,
which could at any time have been dis
persed by a handful of police, by no
means represents the strength of the
movement. This is proved by the fact
that it has been deemed necessary to
draft fully 6000 regulars into the city
from the country, in addition to strong
bodies of Guardia Civlles and Order
PuMicos. and that since Wednesday
night Havana has been an armed
camp.
That the threatened conflict with the
volunteers has been averted is due, in
a great measure, to the firm attitude
and diplomacy of General Parrado, as
sistant captain-general ex offlcio, in
command of the volunteers.
Throughout the disturbances the ani
mating spirit of the mob has been en
thusiasm for General Weyler and a de
i mand for the vigorous prosecution of
: the war. Ott General IManco and thf
new government the foulest abuse and
the bitterest iniprecatlona have been
{ poured out. Officers of the volunteers

cret of their determination to proceed
to .any length to force the resignation
or recall of General Blanco.
Bo fnr the army has remained loyal,
but there in no question that discon
tent with General Blanco is prevalent
In all ranks. The fact that the
eminent has released all the officers
concerned in th<* outbreak is r*>irrird"d
as an evidence of weakness. It is ru
mored to-day that an understanding
exists between the army and th<- volun
teers, and the latter are planning an
armed demonstration to-morrow with
the intention of compelling General
Blanco to take refuge on the cruiser
Alfonso XII.
La Lucha yesterday published a tele
gram, censored at the palace, statin*
i that General Lee had informed his
' Government that tranquility reljuned in
! Havana. I showed this to Genera]
j Lee. and he said he had never sent any
, such telegram. *
General Lee said that, while he did
not think the situation at present de
manded the presence of a warship, yet
he thought it was bo serious that he
dispatched three or four telegrams
daily to Washington describing the sit
uation.
General Lee Is also highly Indignant

purporting to come from Washington,
and stating that General Lee direct
ly offered the services of an American
warship for the protectirm of Spanish
lives and property, and that General
Blanco had said such aid was not re
quired. This telegram General Lee de
nounced as absolutely perverted.
â¢What 1 did do," said General Lee,
"was to send a message to the palace
that unless they gave me assurance
they were able to guarantee the lives
and property of Americans here during
the riots, I would cable for a warship,
and have one here pretty quick, too."
General Lee said he did not think the
disturbances were at an end.
AM ERIC AN INTERESTS
TO BE PROTECTED
BY THE PRESIDENT.
// Spain Cannot Hold Cuba Then McKinley
Will See Whether He Can Buy
the Island.
NEW YORK. Jan. 15â A Washing,
ton special to the Herald says: The
report received from Consul-General
Lee to-day was of the most reassuring
character as to the present condition
of affairs, as were also the cablegrams
received by Minister De Lome. But
notwithstanding the pacific character
of these reports, there is no denying
that thf authorities view the situation
with more or less concern. They do
ndt wish to do anything: tending to
hamper the Spanish authorities in their
efforts to push their autonomous pol
icy, but being doubtful of its success,
the President and his department
chiefs are doing everything which pru
dence dictates for a crisis if it comes.
The protection of Americans and
American interests is the keynote of
the general plan so far as interference
by the United Stm^s is concerned. Tf
war vessels are s -nt to Havana, the
authorities all declare that it will be
solely for the purpose of protecting
American interests. If conditions arise
showing the loss of Spain's control over
Cuba, it is the purpose of the President
to use peaceful m^ans of intervention
rather than forcible ones. An effort will
be made by diplomatic negotiations to
Induce Spain to i rant Independence to
the island through the means of pur
chase.
Assistant Secretary Roosevelt hns
been in consultation with Major Gen
eral Miles and Acting Secretary of War
Meiklejohn concerning plans for unity
of action by the army and navy in case
of emergency. Miles said to-day that
the War Department is neither asleep
nor unduly active The army is con
stantly kept in a high state of efficien
cy, and the troops at various posts are
ready for active service at an hour's
notice.
The battleship Texas sailed from New
York at 2 o'clock this afternoon to Join
the North Atlantic squadron. Admiral
Sicard has been granted permission by
Secretary Long to delay the sailing of
the squadron from Hampton Roads
until to-morrow in order that the
Texas may Join It off the Chesapeake
Capes.
AN INSURGENT GENERAL
KILLED BY HIS MEN
IN PINAR DEL RIO.
It /s Said Also That His Chief of Staff Has
Surrendered to the Spanish
Authorities.
HAVANA. Jan- 15.â A dispatch re
ceived from Spanish sources In Pinar
' del Rio says the insurgent Brigadier
General Perico Delgado has been kill
ed by his followers, and that his chief
, of staff, Louis Lopez Marlin, has sur
rendered to the Spanish authorities.
Senor Antonio Govin. the Cuban law
yer, who has been appointed Minister
of the Interior in the autonomous Cab
inet, arrived here to-day.
Captain General Blanco has issued a
circular ordering that each battalion of
infantry be strengthened by 125 men, to
be recruited in their respective locali
ties by the generals of divisions. These
; recruits will be obliged to serve nix
months, and will receive the same pay
ap the regular soldiers. The circular
also orders that the local guerrillas are
to double their numbers under the
same conditions us when organized.
A dippatch from San Juan de las

FIERCE FIGHT
WAGED AGAINST
JUDGE McKENNA
It Is Not Believed the Opposition
Can Muster Sufficient Strength
to Compass His Defeat.
NEW YORK, Jan. 15.â A special to
the Commercial Advertiser from
Washington says: A stout fight is
being made against the confirmation of
the nomination of Attorney-General
McKenna to be. Associate Justice of
the United States Supreme Court, but
It does not appear that the opponents
of the confirmation will be able to
muater a majority in the Senate. By
agreement reached yesterday a vote
will be taken next Friday and Mc-
Kenna's friends are confident that on
the ballot he will be confirmed easily.
The strongest opposition omes from
Western Senators. Mr. Allen of Neb
raska thus far has done almost all the
talking in executive session, and while
denouncing the assault on McKenna
because of his religion, has based his
criticism on the frequency with which
Mr. McKenna's decisions while he was
United States Circuit Judge were set
aside.
Attacks on McKenna because he
happens to be a Roman Catholic cut

icism which has any weight is that

other Senators who have been Inform

were not regarded highly. It is said
that when Senator Morgan was In Cal
ifornia on hia way back from Hawaii
a few months ago he was informed
that three of the Pacific Slope Judges
were opposed to Mr. McKenna's con
firmation and that he has laid this be
fore the Senate.
The two California Senators are
giving McKenna earnest support, al
though Senator White differs from him
in politics. Senator Hoar, chairman of
the Judiciary Committee, also seems to

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Mass., Jan. 15.â The Call
correspondent to-day secured advance
proofs of Lilluokalani's new book,
"Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen,"
to be published heve in Boston this sea
son. The following extracts are char
acteristic: "Many whose names might
be mentioned have been perfectly will
ing to wear the uniform of the crown,
to display their gilt lace and brass but
tons on state occasions, and to ride
richly caparisoned horses with shining
accouterments through our streets, and
as long as the missionary party chose
the men that were to be thus decked
r>ut, honored and exhibited, it was nev
er alleged that the Hawaiian kings lov
ed display, and sought pomp and fuss
and feathers. Yet what had nur earlier
monarchs ever dcme for the public
good? Individually, nothing. They
had acquiesced in the course laid down
for them by the missionaries.
"The government established by these
pious adventurers was the government
of the day. Those of their number who
were able to get into government serv
ice drew their salaries faithfully, and
spent or saved as they saw fit, but ob
served a truiy religious silence as to the
folly of spending money on public dis
plays. This is the more remarkable be
cause there were other ways, even
then, of securing treasury deficiencies.
I remember that when G. P. Judd, W
Richards and R. Armstrong were Cab
inet Ministers, a deficiency so inex
plicable occurred that the Cabinet was
required to resign immediately and to
one of the retiring members the popu
lar appellation, 'Kauka-Kcrpe-Kala â¢
subsequently adhered pretty tenacious
ly. I refrain from translating, as the
title is not of honor, but it still clings
to the family as an heirloom."
She mildly recalls the friendship
and favor extended by Paki, her ad
opted father, to Mr. Gilman, and her
sorrow that he should have explicit
belief in all the absurd and wicked
statements circulated by the mission
ary party against her own character
and that of her people. "Papers were
sent to me," she writes, "wherein Mr.
Gilman had repeated and vouched for
the truth of these abominable politi
cal scandals, and at first I could
scarcely credit it, for this man was
often at the house of my adoption and
showed great partiality for my society
when I was a young girl and he a
young man. He knew Paki and Konl,
a couple of the strictest mcrality,
whose household was organized on the
basis of the most regular family
habits and the most pious Christian
customs, and these had taken me from
my very birth under their parental
care.
"He further knew me as the foster
sister and daily compp-nion of Mrs.
Bernice Pauahl Bishop, where I was
ever under the kind care of her hus
band, ,Hon. Charles R. Bishop, a
couple whose principles of exalted
piety, whose love for all that Is good
and honorable and pure are too well
known to need at this moment tha
least praise from me, and whose pro
tection was ever and always surround
ing my earlier life. From their house
when I married I went directly to
that of my husband's mother, with
whom I lived to the day of her death,
not so very long ago."
She speaks with pleasure of the "gal
lant gentlemen, beautiful ladies and
fair young girls" who graced the re
ception given in her honor by Mrs.
LÂ«e in Boston, but she sadly says:
"Although since my earliest remem
brance, I have been accustomed to cer
emonies and receptions, yet, even after
a winter's experience in Washington, it
is not easy for me to get over that
shrinking ga*e of strangers acquired
by years of retirement, eight months of
experience as a prisoner, and the hu
miliations of the time when I was un
der the supervision of Government
spies or custodians.
"It should be remembered in reading
this that nations newly converted to
; Christianity have an unpleasantly lit
j eral way of applying it, and when in
\ jured by a Christian suffer in their re
i ligious sensibilities. Also, they believe
I their Bibles,"

MADERA, Jan. 15.â W. F. P.aird, who

A peculiar feature of thp rrime Im

Salem to-day when Albert S. CofÃn, a
very prominent and wealthy young: blood,
was arrested on charges which shocked
the two cities. He is accused of main
taining a nuisance at his summer home
at Wheelers Point, a fashionable sum
mer resort near Gloucester.
For some time there have been well
defined rumors regarding the perform
ances held there, and a Salem newspaper
demanded that Coffin be prosecuted, but
nobody thought that this brilliant young
society leader would actually be arrest
ed. Acting upon the Information forced
upon him. however. District Atttorney
White brought the evidence to the Grand
Jury, and as a result c.'tnn was to-day
arrested on a capias. He will be ar

MANY LYNCHERS
Douglas County's Grand
Jury Will Return
Indictments.
Threats of the Mob Leaders
Believed to Have Fallen
on Deaf Ears.
It Is Certain That Relatives of Ãber
Will Not Assist in thÂ©
Prosecution.
Special Dlsratoh to The Call.
CARSON, Jan. 15.â Before the close
of another week it will be known
whether the members of the mob that
lynched Murderer iber are to be
brought to trial for their participation
in the brutal tragedy. The feeling
throughout the Carson valley is that,
despite the whispered warnings of pos
sible trouble for the jurors, they will
attempt to bring each of the lynchers
to justice, and they undoubtedly have
the names of most of the party.
It requires twelve votes out of the
seventeen of the jury to indict the
lynchers cf Ãber. There is every lndi
catton that the grand jurors are not in
sympathy with the lynchers, and are
making a full investigation of the case.
There is .no doubt that every possible
pressure is being brought to bear on
the jury to prevent an indictment. If
the lynch. -is can get six men to vote
against the indictment they are safe.
Tin re is only one man on the jury who
is regarded as a sympathizer with the
lynch<
Ev< rything is being closely watched
by the people of Genoa, ami as lung as
the jury Bends for important witness
es ami keeps investigating it will be
regarded as evidence that It means
business. It has now the name of an
other wurnan who helped make the
masks, and she will be called to tell
for whom she made them. Already the
jury knows the balnea of nearly ev
ery participant in the lynching.
The argument the friends crt the
lynchers are now making is that the
trial of s<- many people l"<>r a criminal
offense will be a great source of ex
pense to the county and bankrupt It.
This talk la having considerable weight
with a certain class of people.
There has been considerable talk ol
a suit against the county of Douglas
by the relative! of TJber, but it is nÂ«*w
quite certain there wijl be nothing of
the sort. When Ãber was lynched his
v.>s in the East wrote to Alf.
Charts, h:s attorney, for full particu
lars. The attorney busied himself in
the case a good deal, and, &a Ãber's
unrle was quite wealthy, it was sup
i that momy would be spent lav
ishly to bring the offenders to justice
in criminal suits and civil suits for
damages. As soon as the relatives as-
Ined that civil suits would enst
money they concluded that they
in no hurry to bring them. Here
are pome extracts from the letter rÂ»Â»
eelved from Otter's sister by his attor
ney, mention of which was made in
The Call to-day:
"The Lord has's'oved me from all
feeling against them. There â â¢ is no
thought in my â¢'heart of that kind. The
Lord has filled Jmy soul with love and
good will to everybody, and I can pray
for these fellows" who murdered my
brother. Please read Matt. 5: 44, Ro
mans. 1. 19. 20, 21. I will admit that I
do not know very much. See Ist Co

In another letter the attorney Is ad
vised to read the tracts sent him by
I hers slater, and look for his reward
in heaven for the legal services already
done for Vber.

an unusual state of affairs in that sec

their product for higher prices, and they
would not sell when they had an oppor

when they would be induced to consign
it to Eastern markets to have it given
away regardless of values and to the
detriment of jobbers here who were car
rying stock they had given up their good

of competition that they have had to
meet, as this class of shipments art- sold
to any one regardless of quantity, and at
prices that were less than market value.
Hut this cannot be continued now, and
the Jobbers need not have any fear from
that source, for the Simple reason, ns
stated above, that the Western market

ever since December 1 the Pacific â¢

PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 13.â The
tw.-nty mile paced race between
Edouard Taylore. the French middle
distance champion, and J. Frank Star
buck of this city, at Saengcr Hall to
night, was spoiled by an unfortunate
accident to Taylore. The accident oc
curred on the sixth mile, Taylore at
that time having gained a lead of a lap.
which, at Saensc-r Hal!, is one-tenth of
a mile. On the next lap the tandem
team took him at a terrific clip around
the tureen-shaped course.
As the foreigner turned into the home
stretch the spill took place. Taj
wheel dashed up the incline toward the
outside of the track, and the machine
and rider brought up against a post,
the win-el being smashed completely,
and Taylore rebounding and falling c-n
the track. He mana.K- ij to get out of
the road just as Starbuck and his pac
ers cam.- tearing around the turn, or
otherwise more men might have been
hurt. Taylor., was not seriously injur
ed. His right shoulder was thrown out
of place, and his left knee was wrench
ed.
While the rare lasted Taylore im
pressed the 8600 spectators with his
ability. many comparing him with
Jimmy Michael. Starbuck, too, rode
in splendid form, as his time of 10:28 1-2
for five miles shows.
Taylor.- pot the lead at the start and
for the first mile it was a regular pro
ceseton. Then the foreigner began to
draw away. At the end ,f the>-seeond
mile Taylore was almost a lap to the
good, and when the mishap occurred
he was over ;t lap ahead. After that
Starbuck reeled off mile .-ifter mile at
a steady clip, merely covering the
twenty miles necessary to secure first
money.
The one mile international pursuit
race was won by Lamberjack and Gou

Its Mission to Antagonize the

GANG RULE ITS POLICY.
Membership Hns Fallen From Four
Thousand to Lees Than Two
Hundred.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
cloak of a l.ame which appeals strong
ly to every fair-minded and patriotic
citizen, the League for Better City
Government in Los Angeles has und
ertaken to do things that would have
brought down the severest condemna
tion upon any organization that had
not succeeded in deluding the general
public as this has done. Organized
ostensibly for the purpose of bringing
about better conditions in Los An
geles, its name is now used for the
self-advancement of certain individ
uals in the interest of a few corpora
tions and as a means of splitting the
Republican party in the interests of the
local Democracy.
The movement for better city govern
ment was instituted under the aus
pices of the league about eighteen
months ago. Its membership increased
rapidly, and Just before the munici
pal election hfld in December of 1896
there were more than 4000 names on
â  mbership roll
The manner in which the league con
ducted its campaign in this election and
the manner in which the league affairs
were handled by a certain small clique
which represents corporation interests,
the â¢ newspaper combination
of Lop Angeles and the concentrated
antagonism to the regular Republican
party has caused the membership to
fall off to such an extent that there are
not to-day more than 200 members in
good standing, and possibly less than
half that number.
Under the bylaws adopted by the
league's affairs are controlled by a
board of directors, consisting of twen
ty-three members. This board is now
constituted as follows: S. A. Butler,
Harry Chandler. O. P. Clark. H. J.
Fleishman. T. E. Gibbon, J. M. Grif
fith, Bttrt Eates Howard, Lee A. Mc-
Connell, D. M. McGarry, Robert Mc-
Ciarvin. Octavius Morgan. M. H. New
, . William Pridman, Ferd. K. Rule,
â Alfred Stern, W. L. Valentine, J. V.
Warhtel. G. 11. Wadleigh, T. S. Wads
worth. I. A. Weid, M. Welsh, J. R.
N< wberry and W. D. Woolwine.
Because The Call, in connection with
its investigations regarding the School
B"ard scandal, has been giving all the
facts and giving them fairly as they
develop, it has aroused the league to
a childish and impotent antagonism of
this journal. It was not so much that
The Call published unprejudiced re
ports of the sessions of the Hoard of
Education which was hearing the
Webb case, but the fact that this paper
called attention to the felonious action
of another member of the Hoard of Ed
ucation, who is also a member of the
league, that caused the league by for
mal resolutions to pet up a howl
against The Call in unison with the
yelping and barking of the three news
papers â the Times, the Herald and the
Express â that run the paper, or are
run by the league's inner clique.
At a cowardly secret session a hand
ful of men â a bare quorum of the board
of directors of the league â passed a
pet of resolutions which has not one
fair or truthful statement in it, and
which smacks strongly of the charac
teristic whinings of a hypocrite ex
posed. These resolutions are as fol
lows:
Resolved, That we call the attention of
the business m. â  . of this
city to the treatment which the E
B^urd scandal is receiving in thi
Francisco Call, a newspaper which pro
fesses to be friendly to this section, and
which has some circulation in this city,
but which has persistently misrepresent
ed th< dvantage of the
forces at work for municipal inform and
to the detriment of this city.
Re= .â¢ the League for Better
City Government, an organization which
has for its object a business administra
tion of the city';- affairs, without .regard
to party, hereby emphatically condemns
the San Francisco Call for Its impudent
<1 baseless attacks on respectable citi
i us and its attempted defense of boo
dlers.
At the meeting at which these reso
lutions were passed there were present
cut of the twenty-ihree-dlrectors here
tofore named only eight, as follows: S.
A- Butler, Lee A. Connell, Robert Mc-
Garvin, W. L. Valentine, J. V. Wachtel,
G. EL Wadleigrh, T. S. Wadsworth and
W. D. Woolwine. These men repre
sented in spirit if not in fact- those
persons and interests which have been
forcing the prosecution against Walter
L. Webb, against whom no adverse tes-
timony has been brought out except
that given by two self-confessed per
jurers. These same persons and inter
ests have Bet th-ir forces to the work
to shield and protect J. H. Braly, a
member of the Board of Education, a
member of the League for Better City
Government and the president of the
Southern California Savings Bank.
This attitude of defense on behalf of
Braly has been assumed in the face of
documentary evidence of an incontro
vertible character that has been shown
t" >-xist against Braly, and which
shows him to have been guilts' of a.
felonious act and to have involved his
ba:;k in transactions frbidden by law
in order to protect savings bank de
positors.
Among the eight members present
and participating in the star chamber
proceedings of last Tuesday night will
be noticed the name of W. I). Wool
wine Mr. Woolwine is the ca-hier of
the Southern California Savings Bank,
of which Mr. Braiy is president.
A brief history of the League for
Better City O.jvprnmoin throws con
siderable light upon the ulterior ends
for which it was organized and in
interests it is and has been used.
â¢ It. was incubated and hatched in the
\Lx>s Angelas Chamber of Commerce by
C. D. Willard. then secretary of that
body and now manager of "the Los
Angeles Express. WiUard was also a
member of the first board of directors
elected aftf-r the league was inr.. r j>M
rated, in May of last year. Among the
other directors elected at this time
was L. E. Mosher. who is the first lieu
tenant of H. d. Otis in the manage
ment of the Times. "While Mr. Wil
lard's name does not aopear in the
present board of directors of the
league, he is still one of its most ac
tive spirits. In tho existing: board o f ,
directors the Times Is represented by
Harry Chandler a son-in-lay.- of H. O.
â¢ Mis. and the superintendent of the cir
culation of the Times, whilf the Her
ald newspaper is represented by T. K.
Gibbon.
In both the o-ld board and in the new
the three corporations which are look
ed upon by the taxpayers of this city
as being m"st Inimical to thoir Inter
ests are well and numerously repre
sented. Th^e corporations are the Loa
Angeles City Water Company, the Loa
Angeles Lighting Company and the Los
Angeles Electric Company. Incidental
ly, th<- significant fact may be noted
that nearly every officer of the water
company was a vice-president at the
mass meeting held in this city under
the auspices of the Leapue for i
city Government in reference to the
School Hoard scandal.
Another significant fact in reference
to the league is that four of its leading
spiritsâ T. EL Gibbon. (". D. Wiliard,
Henry W. O'Melveny and Charles For
man â are Democrats, while most of the
other prominent men in the leapue are
what are known as "Otis Republicans."
The Otis wing of the Republican
party of this sectjon of the State is but
a very small minority. What local
strength it has lies in this city. In
the interior Otis men are nearly as
scarce as hen's teeth. It is the unquali
fied opinion of the Republicans allied
with the regular organization of that
party that the league Is nothing more
than an instrument to be used by this
unholy alliance of Democrats and
pseudo Republicans to disintegrate the
local Republican party and to bring
victory to the local Democratic ticket.
It is asserted that with the city pnv
ernment in control of Democrats it
would be a comparatively easy thing
to secure control of the cÂ«unty offices.
Among the best citizens of the city
the opinion is freely expressed that if
a league ticket is elected and such a
tit k< t would be energetically supported
by the syndicated press, consisting of
the Times, Herald and Expressâ the
people would be delivered over to the
mercies of the three corporations pre
viously named.
There is no question but that there
are still a large number of disinterest
ed and well meaning citizen? who are
members of the league, but this class !
of people has been withdrawing more
and more rapidly as it became more \
and more apparent that the league was j
a delusion and a snare, and that the
good people In It were simply being
used as figureheads to subserve the
vicious ends of the conspirators who
instituted, who have shaped the course
of and now absolutely control the mis
named league for better city gov
ernment.

FRESNO. Jan. 15.â F. C. Cretser, while
drunk early yesterday morning, proceed
ed to shoot his house to- pieces. With a
No. 10 shotgun he fired seven shots
through the dwelling, tearing big holes in
portions of the house and shooting the
doors down. The tiring attracted all thÂ«
neighbors in the vicinity of his home, at
3320 Fresno street. When the shooting
had ceased they gathered around the
house, thinking that a tragedy had been
committed, as Cretser was known to have
had trouble with his wife at different
times. Finally several men ventured in
and found Cretser, his brother and a
third man named Erigelbretson lying in a
room in a half-drunken stupor.
It was almost a miracle that the freak
of the drunken man had not resulted in
the loss of several lives, as a charge of
the shot entered the home of William
Shepp. across the street. Some of the
shot fell on the roof, while one charge
entered through a window of a room, but
had spent its force.
All three of the men In the house were
arrested this morning by Constable Shaw.
It was learned that i Creston had been
deserted by his wife a few days ago. and
he proceeded to drown his sorrow. While
under the influence of whisky he deter
mined to shoot their home full of holes.
He succeeded well in his undertaking.
The three men were charged with disturb

DEATH FOR
THE SLAYER
OF ANDREWS
Winters Found Guilty
by a Redwood
City Jury.
First Degree Murder With
No Recommendation
Â©f Clemency.
Unanimous Verdict Reached
on the Taking of the
First Ballot.
FORSAKEN BY HIS NERVE.
The Convicted Man Checked In an
Excited Attempt to Revile His
Ex posers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY. Jan. 15.â "Guilty
of murder In the first degree."
Such whs the verdict rendered this
afternoon by the Jury impaneled tn
try Harry Winters for the murder of
Charles A. Andrews in the Grand
Hotel at Baden last November.
When the case was given to the Jury
it was evident to every one present in
the courtroom that the twelve men
would certainly convict the prisoner,
but it was thought, after the Jury had
retired, that imprisonment for life
would be the punishment, instead
of death.
During the short time the Jury were
deliberating the defendant appeared
nervous and excited, and a Deputy
Sheriff was at his side continually.
When the foreman announced the ver
dict Winters Jumped to his feet and
began to address the Jury, but was
silenced by the court and Sheriff. He ,
looked pale and haggard.
When court adjourned yesterday af
ternoon Winters was on the stand.
This morning Attorney Nagle further
questioned him with respect to the
clothes he wore on the 16th and 17th
<j{ November. A number of people at
Baden who identified him said he wore
a black Fedora hat. He denied this
morning that he ever wore such a hat,
and denied that the hat found in the
hall of the Grand Hotel was his. He
said that on the 16th he wore a stiff
Derby hat and on the morning of the
17th he changed it for a light slouch
hat given to him by James L.. Xagle,
the brother of his attorney. He did
not have a blue Melton overcoat on
the day he was in Baden, as testified
to by Witness Hi ley.
Upon cross-examination it was
Shown clearly that his whole story
given In direct examination was fabri
cation. He made many contradictory
statements, which greatly prejudiced
his case. He admitted that he knew
Raymond and knew him well, but that
he was acquainted with him under the
name of Samuel Moore.
His acquaintance with Raymond
dated back a number of years, and as
Raymond has been confined in State's
Prison for a long period and until very
recently, it must be that the acquaint
anceship was formed there. He ad
tnitted that he had been convicted of a
felony, but of what felony the court
would not permit to be shown. His
appearance and every action betoken the
criminal. Especially was this notice
able yesterday, when he was shown th~
revolver taken from him in the Grand
Hotel and the one taken from Ray
mond on the morning of the 17th. when
he was captured. He took them and
handled them as no one could who was
iv*t very familiar with such weapons.
He gave it as his opinion that pistols
â uch as those could be purchased for
$1 90 each.
James L. Xagle was called as a wit
ness for defendant. He identified a
hat shown him, and testified that he
gave it to Winters on the 17th of No
vember. He had given the defendant
the suit of clothes he was wearing.
Winters, he Bald, had been doing odd
Jobs about the office for him for some
time past, and he had seen him every
day from the 17th to the 24th of No
vember, on which latter date he was
arrested. On the 17th he noticed noth
ing unusual in the appearance of Win
ters. He bore no marks of a confUd of
any kind such as would have attract
ed his attention.
This completed the defendant's case,
and in rebuttal District AtUrrney
Walker called John Nelson, who testi
fied that he was night watchman at
the Salvation Army quarters on New
Montgomery street in San Francisco.
Tic said ho know Winters, and had seen
him at the Salvation Army pla;e on
several occasions, thus contradicting
Winters, who said he was never there
! before the nipht of the 16th of Novem
â  ber. He further testified that he had
pÂ°en him there with Raymond, alias
Moore,, and also with a man by the
name of Willett. Willett is wanted for
: this same murder, and for his arrest a
reward of ?2~>Q has been offered.
Constable PescteUo was called In re
! buttai and testified that soon after the
crime had been committed he went to
San Francisro and stationed himself
!at the entrance to the building in
which Mr. Hagle had his office. He
; took this position about 7:30 o'clock la
the morninp and remained there all
; day, with the exception of about an
hour fur lunch, for four or five days
watching for Winters, but saw him
: only one- in all that time.
At U:M the District Attorney began
his opening argument to the Jury, fin
ishing at noon. At 1 o'clock Attorney
Nagle spoke in behalf of the defendant
and was followed by the closing argu
ment from the District Attorney. The
court then instructed th^ Jury and at
2:90 o'clock it retired. While' the jury
was out the defendant tried to appear
unconcerned, but tailed utterly. And
when the Jury returned he half started
from his scat, seeming to expect the
worst. The Jury was out only about
twenty-flve minutes before it reached
Its verdict. But two ballots were cast,
and each of these was unanimous The
first ballot was as to whether the de
f. odant was guilty or not guilty, and
the second was as to the punishment
to be inflicted. The result was mur
der in the first degree, without fixing
the punishment. This means that un
less the Supreme Court grants a new
trial Winters will be hanged for the
murder of C. A. Andrews.
When the foreman had announced
the verdict Winters Jumped to his feet
and addressed the Jurors. He said:
"Gentlemen of the Jury. T don't blame
you for what you have done, but T do
blame these liars, perjurers, bribers
and murderers."

Great Good Will Result From the
Visit of the Chief of the Sal

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
,NKW YORK. Jan. IK.â General
Booth, the hond of the Salvation Army,
reached this city to-day on board the
steamer St. Paul from Southampton.
In honor of his visit to America twelve
new shelters for the homeless poor and
three new rescue homes for women will
be simultaneously opened In the coun
try. The general, now in his sixty
ninth year, made his first trip to this
country in 1894, holding 200 meetings
within three months. Since then the
army shows an increase of member
ship of 2438. The colonization scheme,
the pet project of General Booth, will
be pushed during his stay.
The general was met down the bay
by Commander Booth-Tucker. On the
pier a large delegation of headquarters
Salvationists were awaiting their
chief, and he was given a warm re
ception.
"The general." said Commander
Booth-Tucker, "will stay at my house
in Pordham until Monday, when he
will leave for Canada, where he will be
met by his daughter, Miss Eva Booth,
who Is in charge of the Salvation Army
there. He will remain three weeks in
Canada, inspecting the work of the
army, and will then return to the
United States. He will begin his Amer
ican tour <>n February 1" In Washing
ton. After that he will visit Pittsburg,
<'<.lumbus. Cincinnati. St. Louis, Kan
sas city, Denver, LÂ»s Angeles. San
Francisco, Portland, Seattle and Spo
kane at which last place he will be on
March 17. The general then will cross
again over into Canada and visit Vic
toria Vancouver and Winnipeg. On
March 19 he will be in Minneapolis and
Bl Paul. From March 20 to 21 he will
be in Chicago. From then until April
14 he will visit successively Cleveland,
Buffalo. Boston and Philadelphia. Gen
eral Booth will conclude his American
visit with a series of meetings and
! demonstrations in New York from
April 14 to 19. On April 20 he will sail
for England.
"General Booth's idea is not alone to
look over the work and progress of the
Salvation Army in the United States
and Canada, but in traveling through
these countries he will confer with a
number of the citizens of thÂ» leading
cities concerning his schemes fcr the
assistance of the poor. He will inspect
ami sugest Improvement* in tho social
institutions which we have established
in this country, which now have ac
commodation for 4000 persons."
I Miring the day General Booth made
a >l>'tailed statement of his plans to the
newspaper reporters. Incidentally, he
si.<-k.> of his relations with his son. Bal
' llngton Booth. Upon this subject he
Bald that full explanations of the cause
of separation were given at the time
of the disagreement, and to these he
was unable to add anything.
"As to the present condition rrf my
daughter-in-law," he went on, "I have
I already expressed n.y deep sympathy
with my son, both by cable and by let
' ter. With respect to the causes that
have led up to this illness. I am to
tally in the dark. Commander Booth-
Tucker and my daughter, the Consul.
', have, I believe, already denied all
i blameworthiness on thÂ«> part of the
leaders of the Salvation Army here for
this painful affliction
"Of my daughter, who is known to
every Christian throughout the length
and breadth of the world, I net-<l not
s.iy anything, while my long and inti
, mate acquaintance with Commander
Booth-Tucker and personal knowledge
' of th^ honorable career he has sacri
ficed in the Indian service to become a
worker with mo. gave me the highest
confidence in th<* wisdom of his admin
istration and the oorrect&ess of all
' statements he may have made on this
i or any other phase of the subject.
"A great deal of curiosity has been
' manifested, I am Informed, as to
\ whether I am going to have an inter
â  view with my son. To that I reply
that I have already asked for an inter
view on thÂ» occasion of my present
â  visit. Whether it will be granted to
me in the form I have asked forâ that
! is, without the Interference of any
other person â remain" to be seen."
Commander Balllngton Booth, of the
i Volunteers of America, was asked If he
would be willing to meet his father. H
said: "Most assuredly. I will meet
my father under the following condi
tions* which have been drawn by the
\ Rev. Josiah Strong:
"Firstâ That there shall he arranged
an interview between General William
Booth and Commander Ralllngt.m
Booth at as early a date as possible.
"Secondâ That thÂ»>y meet not In
their official capacity but as father and
. son.
'â Thirdâ That Rev. Joslah Strong of

STARTLING FACTS STATED.
Only OnÂ« Dry-Dock on the Pacific
Coast Which Would Hold a
Largo Battleship.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Jan. lo.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: In the event of war ope
rations the United States navy would
be seriously hampered by a lack of
docks; this is particularly true of
the North Atlantic squadron. Secre
tary Long- declares that the most urg
ent need of the navy is an increase of
docking facilities. Of eleven Govern
ment docks â nine on the Atlantic and
two on the Pacific Coast â three were
designed to accommodate battle-ships
of the first class, one at New York, one
at Port Royal, S. C, and one at Brem
erton, Washington, on Puget Sound.
Civil Engineer M. T. Endicott, who
returned to-day from the Brooklyn
navy-yard, where he has been in con
sultation with Naval Constructor
Bowles in regard to making repairs to
dry dock No. 3, informed Secretary
LK>ng that there is grave danger that
the key wall will give way. It is not
believed that the dock will be ready
for service until the entrance has been
rebuilt, and at least six months and
probably longer will be required to do
this. There is not only an insufficiency
of water at the entrance to Port Royal
dry dock, but the cross section of the
dock is too small to admit battle-ships
with bilge keels.
There is only one dock on the Pacific
Coast of sufficient size to dock modern
battle-ships. This is on Puget Sound,
900 miles from San Francisco. Ac
oesa to it is through a narrow channel
twenty miles long, onf side of which is
in possession of a foreign Government.
The battle-ships Indiana and Massa
chusetts were docked some months ago,
the former at Halifax and the latter
in dry dock No. 3, just before the
Brooklyn structure developed the de
fects. It is recognized by Naval au
thorities that Great Britain in
case of war would not per
mit United States men-of-war to
Use Canadian or English docks, and
this Government would consequently he
thrown on its own resources. At the
present time the department has been ;
Informed that the hulls of the battle- ; (
ships lowa. Indiana and Massachusetts j ,
art- foul and their speed has been ma- ; '.
terially decreased. Even should Xaval }
Constriu-tor liowles be successful in '
makinp repairs, some of the officials of
the department say that the dry dock
might be found to he too weak to ac
commodate a ship of 11,000 tons dis
plae.-nvnt. One of thÂ» se pentlemen
pointed out to-day that the dry dock is
built on soil of a quicksand character, j
"Constant driving of sheet piling." he
said, "has undoubtedly resulted in
loosening the soil. You will recall that
â¢>n January 7 the earth back of the
winp wall on the easterly side of the '.
dock settled, carrying; with it the crane
tracks. Water and fine sand entered j
the pit between the caisson and the
tarn, and the flow finally resulted in a
cave-in. That illustrates the weakness
of the dock. The department will not
trust one of its costly battleships in a
structure of this character until small
er vessels sufficiently strong to stand
tumblinK about have tested its
strenpth."
When T saw Mr. Kndicott to-day he
declined to discuss the Brooklyn dry
dock question, but from another official
who knows what Mr. Kndicott did
while at the navy yard. I learned that
his Investigation shows that there is
; prave danger of the collapse of the en
tire entrance to the dock.
In his reports to the Senate and
House Naval Committee, Secretary
i Lone urped that docks be constructed
at Boston, Portsmouth, N. H.. and
Marc Island. Cat.; that dry-dock No.
i 2 at the New York navy-yard be fitted
with a concrete entrance ami widened
sufficiently to accommodate our larpest
battleships; that the present timber
dry-dock at Leneu* 1 Island be widened
and provided with a concrete entrance.
and that at Norfolk dry-dock be j
1 lengthened 150 feet, which will enable
j it to accommodate all except the very \
'â â  largest ships. A sub-committee of the I
i House Nnval Committee iÂ«s considering ;
the naval appropriation Mil, and the
! Recretciry believes that the sub-com
mittee nnd committee, recognizing the
Imperative needs of docks, will make
provision for their construction, as he
I recommended.

DR. SCHENK'S
DISCOVERY
DISCUSSED
Attention Given Laws
Regulating the
Sexes.
Professors Speak of Some
Experiments Made
With. Insects.
Food an Important Factor
in Determining the
Problem.
CASE OF THE BEES CITED.
Starvation Known to Have Produced
Males and Good Feeding
Females.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Jan. 15.â Dr. Schenk's re
cently announced discovery of the law
regulating the sexos has been received
with a great deal of attention at Har
vard, especially among the biologists,
who lo<,-k upon the theory with kindly
eyes, being of the opinion that the doc
tor is possibly right. In the meantime,
the professors are discussing the sub
ject with much interest.
Professor C. B. Davenport of the de
partment says on the subject: "It is
probably possible to control the sexes.
Experiments have been made with in
sects, butterflies and even other groups,
with more or less success. There haa
been a theory prevalent for some time
that the sex can be determined by the
amount of nutrition taken by the moth
er during the embryonic stage. The
idea that excessive feeding may fix the
sex is in consequence nothing new,
Hnd the idea was the foundation of
(ieddes and Thomson's 'Evolution of
Sex.'
"The problem of sex revolves about
the idea as to whether the sex is deter
mined before fertilization, during it or
after fertilization. The general belief
hns been that it was determined subse
quently, and that the food of the moth
er had some influence in the deter
mination. Dr. Schenk's theory then is
new only in regard to the method he
employed, and, as he does not say what
that method is, I cannot be expected to
make any extended remarks upon it.
But he may be on the right trark. It
is quite possible that he has solved the
question."
Professor Parker has the following to
say: "The trouble about this whole
matter of the determination of the sex
is that very little is authoritatively
known on the subject. There have been
many experiments upon insects in
which starvation brought on males, and
feeding resulted in females. Undoubt
edly food has much to do with sex, but
it is not the only thing, and any the
ory depending upon that alÂ«me is one
sided and does not answer every case.
The case of bees which is so often cit
ed, it must be remembered, is a fer
tilization. The difficulty with this the
ory of Dr. Schenk is it explains a cer
tain number of cases, but not all of
them. A good theory of sex will in
clude every kind of stimulus which is
known to- influence sex at all. By stim
ulus I mean natural cause. This stim
ulus may be made up of factors, in
some cases it may be fertilization, in
others it may be fond. In short. I
think that feeding is one of the factors,
but not the only one."
Dr. Henry P. Bowditoh of the Har
vard Medical School said: "I have
made this prcblem of ?ex a study at
one time, and Dr. Schenk has at dif
ferent times sent me copies of some of
his papers. From what has been pub
lished of the solution which Dr. Schenk
has found I am able to say very little,
still I see no reason why some law
should not be found which will deter
mine the sex of a child. It is a great
problem, and the man who- solves it
will gain everlasting fame."

Many a man who seemed to be dying of
consumption, and whom the doctors pro-

and strong and hearty again by usip_- or.
Pierces Golden Medical Discovery. This
wonderful medicine has shown the doctors
that consumption isn't always a fatal dis-
ease. It can be cured if you get at the
germs of it in the blood and clear them out
â¦ u -..ouÂ£hly. That is what this " Discovery"
does. It makes new blood, â healthy blood.
The germs of consumption can't exist in
healthy blood. They simply let go their
hold and are carried out of the system ;
then the new blood builds up new tissue,
new flesh, new power, new life. It carries
vitality to the lungs, the bronchial tubes and
every other part of the body.
It cures people after cod liver oil has
failed, because their digestive organs are
too weak to digest fat-foods. The " Discov-
ery " makes the digestion strong.
For thin and pale and emaciated people
there is no flesh-builder in the world to
compare with it. It doesn't make flabby
fat, but hard, healthy flesh. It builds nerve-
power and force and endurance. It is never
safe to pronounce any one " dying of con-
sumption," or any other wasting disease,
until this marvelous "Discovery" has been
given a fair trial.

As the cases had not been quarantined
the disease had spread. He ordered
that tonsilitis cases be quarantined,

This statement was made to me to

Mr. Mieklejohn states that there is no

the Fourth Cavalry telegraphed yes
terday that miners coming from Daw

ample food there, and this information
is in line with the statements these
miners have made upon their arrival
at cities on the Pacific Coast."
Mr. Mieklejohn is making an earnest
effort to pet an official statement in re
pa rd to the condition of miners in the
Yukon region. He telegraphed to
day to the Canadian authorities ask
ing them if they had any official In
formation, receiving this reply from
Minister Seftou to-night:

danger of starvation at Dawson, t>ut
there is a great necessity for provi

HIS BETROTHED
WAITS IN VAIN
Strange Disappearance of John
Sweetnam, Late of
Novato.
Departed Without Having o-cupied
a House Which He Had Just
Purchased.
Special Plspatrh to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. .lan. 15.â Tn a little
homo in Boston. Mass., there Is a heart
broken maiden who Is anxiously await
ing tidings of John Sweetnam of Novato,
a dairying town thirteen miles from here.
In Bedford. Mass, there is a brother,
George EL Sweetnam, who also is await
ing knowledge of whether his brother is
living or not. Sweetnam's disapt>earance
Is one of the mysteries of the little town
of Novato, and interest has been revived
by developments which leaked out to
day.
In August of last year John Sweetnam
purchased some land in Novato with the
purpose of making the place his home.
Sweetnam then drove to Petaluma, where
he mortgaged his property for $450 and
proceeded with the money to buy lumber
for a boose. Tin- lumber was paid for
and delivered and Sweetnam had money
lejtâ about $100, it is suld. Soon after he
returned he hitched his horse to his cart
and without a word to any one drove
away. From that day the people of
Novato have not set eyes upon him.
Constable Devoto took the. east* in
charge, and has been energetic Jn his ef
forts to trace Sweetnam. Devotq learned
that Sweetnam, after leaving Novato, had
gone to Angel Island, where he has â 
trunk. Letters were found there that led
to the discovery of his sweetheart ami
brother in the East. Sweetnam had left
Angel Island and from there dropped out
of sight. It is possible that he may have
become deranged and was sent to an
asylum. Constable Devoto will ascertain
by inquiry if such is the case, but the
prospects of finding him in any of the
State's institution is slight.
George H. Sweetnam. the brother of the
missing man. has written t.Â» Devoto ask
ing for information and appealing tr> thf
authorities to locate his brother, if he still
lives. His address is Bedford, Mass., or
246 Devonshire street. Boston.
in th<- letter from the jrotmg â¢woman
she pleads that something may be done
on the part of the authorities or others to
learn the whereabouts of her betrothed.
Estate of M- F Wlndel.
The estate of Henri Frederick Wlndel
has been appraised at 558,589 49. The es
tat" consists of personal property solely.
The last â will of George Scharetg was
filed for probate yesterday. The estate,
consisting of personal property, the value
of whirh is unknown, is bequeathed to
the widow of the decedent.

Repeal of a Statute Mak

Andrew Furuseth's Mission to

Imprisonment of a Sailor for Viola
tion of a Civil Contract a Relic
of Barbarism.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 15.
Captain Thomas Wallace of San
Francisco is at thÂ»- Kljcks House. He
is here to attend the convention of
masters and pilots, which meets n^xt
week. Andrew Furuseth of San Fran
cisco is also here and will urge the re
peal of the T'nited States statute
which provides the penalty of imprison
ment for seamen who leave their ships
In harbor and refuse to carry out their
sailing contracts.
It will he recalled that the United
States Supreihq r<>urt in the Arago
i-'d that this statute (passed
in 1790t is sril] in force and Is constitu
tional. Therefore, the only remedy for
â¢ is to have this odious stat
ute repealed. Mr. Furuseth contends,
with reason, that the imprisonment of
a sallt r for violation of a civil contract
Is ;i species of slave lab^r and is a
relic of barbarism.
He says the fugitive slave law of
R*aS based <>n this same statute,
which was never repealed, but should
be He justly contends that there is
no more reason for imprisoning a
sailor who violates a civil contract
than a land-lubber laborer who does
likewise.
A bill for its repeal will be urjfed by
Maguire in the House and Perkins in
the Senate. The seamen will also urpe
the passage of a bill requiring the
"bridge officers" of vessels, first.

A HOME RULE
CHARTER ONLY
Dr. J. H. Stallard Gives His
Views on Organic
Law Making.
No One Man Power, No Civil Serlvce
System, but a Constructive Non-
Administratiyo Document
Dr. J. 11. Stallard lectured in the Me
chanics' Institute last night on a "Home
Rule Charter.' He prefaced his remarks
by giving his experience of twenty-five
years In London, where he had been con
nected win the great problem of muni
cipal government. The English system of
conducting city affairs was contrasted
with that of the American as he found it.
Statistics from the various leading
American cities were referred to, which
went to show that v. , are far behind
our English cousins in the manner of
running large municipalities. Figures
from the Auditor's reports of this city
were quoted to show the woeful extrav
agance of our system.
In 1889 and 181*0 the total in salaries
alone was $2,274,293. This was increased
during the seven following years, until
In 1896 and 1897 it had grown to $3,173.391â a
difference of $$99,0'.i8, or at the rate of
$128,444 a year. The various Commission
ers' departments were shown up to be
nothing but places especially created for
political time-servers who owe their al
legiance to the political bosses. The
greatest of all of the many evils was
pointed out to be the License Ofnee.
where the salaries had Increased from
$2* .729 in â¢â '.< and 1"." to $40,721 in 1596 and
1597, without any perceptible increase in
the revenues; yet there was $11,992 ex
pended for salaries alone. Other offices
were cited also to show the rottenness of
our present system of city government.
He advocated the idea that a charter
for the people should be framed and
adopted upon the principle of a railroad
board of directors.

RAIN WELCOMED
BY THE FARMER
Light Showers Fall in
Several Sections of
the State.
More Are Needed to Give, an
Impetus to Grain and
Fruit Crops.
Extent of the Damage by the Recent
Froats in Los Angeled
County.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 15.â Rain began
falling in San Jose and vicinity this
morning and continued at intervals
until evening. In all .10 of an inch
fell. The farmers are pleased because
the indications point to another down
pour. Several inches more of rain is
needed to meet the demands of the
soil. A few more rains, and the Santa
t'ktra Valley will be assured of large
crops, both of fruit and grain.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 15.â There was
a short shower of light rain here this
afternoon, which probably pleased the
farmers. The continued frosts and
cold weather, it is said, are keeping
back the grain, which will not make
much headway until a warmer speil
comes on. No complaints of a lack of
moisture are heard here. The crops
are in a state of statu quo, so to speak.
The grain is all In the ground, awaiting
only warm weather, with occasional
rains, to show rapid growth. There
are no reports of injury to crops in
this section from drought or other
causes, but they are retarded and held
back by cold weather. As soon as the
conditions change, the growing crops
will come right along.
The County Horticultural Commis
sioners report the chief damage of the
week's frost to have occurred in the
neighborhood of Downey and Rivera.
Many of thr- orchards there suffered se
verely, fruit and young trees being
frozen in many instances. The da:
occurred in streaks, following the ex
treme lowlands and gulches. Lemons
were also injured. Fruit insp
have condemned a quantity of frosted
oranges offered in open market in this
city. The damage to trees and fruit oc
curred only on lands unfit for citrus
cultivation. The high foothill orchards
.â â¢!â¢â  not affected by the touch of low
temperature.
STOCKTON. Jan. 15.â The rainfall
to-day was very light, and had no ef
p outlo -k. The farmers
have generally finished plowing and
are awaiting heavy falls of rain, hut
no damage is feared from the delayed
downpours, and tlvre is no present fear
of a dry season, for it is remembered
that last year there was very little
rain until February and then it came
too fast and crops suffered for late
rains In the spring. It is the late rains
that make crops, and farmers feel no
anxiety until the spring opens. While
the winter rains hold off the indications
are good for late spring rains, and
these make the farmers glad. The acre
age in this county will be larger than
for many ypars. and from the present
outl<-..,k the crops will be abundant.
The rainfall in Southern California
during the week was sufficient in most
cases for general farm work. Plowing
and seeding has started afresh and
there is general confidence of a full
crop. Early sown grain is doing well
and pasturage has revived. The total
rainfall for the season is 3.77 inches.
The indications are for more rain dur
ing the next twenty-four hours. The
maximum temperature to-day was 62
degrees, minimum temperature 40 de
-
BAN DTEOO, Jan. 15.â The late rain
has removed all present danger of the
grain prop failing. The acreage is much
r than last year. Early in the sea
son immense tracts were sown to grain,
which is already well advanced. This
is notably tho case in the Santa Maria.
Xl Cajon, Poway, Kscondido and D?l
Mar districts, in all of which an in
â ed acreage has been planted.
Since the last storm farmers have been
busy sowing more grain. The weather
is clear here to-night.
WHEAT MEN ARE

Watching for the Storm Which

ward.
More Rain Will Fall Throughout the
Coast According to Pre
dictions.
The wh*at men throughout San Joa
qutn Valley are watching anxiously for
the storm which Is traveling in that di
rection according to the reports of Fore
cast Official Hammon. It will mean con
siderable to the growers there if a heavy
rain should fall within the next few days.
The storm is slowly advancing toward
the Interior, and in the mean time more
rain is expected to fall along the coast
during the next twenty-four hours! The
forecast during to-day states that South
ern California will have rain as well as
the northern portions. The summary
states that the storm that was hovering
over Vancouver Island has divided, a por
tion advancing eastward and the other
traveling toward Oregon, thence south
through Nevada,
Cloudy weather still continues in San
I.vis Obispo County, accompanied by
southerly winds, as far south as Bakers
rl-ii). The Sacramento Valley has been
visited by the recent downpour, and snow
has been reported at Imnsmuir. It is re
ported that the temperature has risen all
o\er the coast, especially noticeable in
portions of Nevada.
The peculiar shape and wide area of the
storm movement accounts to a certain
extent for its slow progress.

Salvation Colony at

Returning to New York He Is
Enthusiastic Over the
Project.
Unstinted in His Praise for the Many
Kindnesses or Landlord
C. F. Romie.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 15.â Commander
Booth-Tucker has just returned from
a visit to his newly founded colony at
Soledad. Cal., of which he speaks en
thusiastically. It is a poor man's par
adise, he declares.
"To Northern and Eastern people,"
he said to-day, "the idea of opening our
homestead colony on January 5 might
not have seemed wise, but out there It
appeared quite a natural thing. The
people of the valley declare that the
clouds have been held up by the pray
ers of Salvationists till they could get
the roofs on thirty neat cottages that
dot their 500-acre tract of land. And,
curiously enough, just as we took the
i train to leave, the clouds spread them
| selves over the valley. Mr. C. F. Ro
| mie Is a fine type of the hospitable
California^, and he has placed at our
disposal what is generally admitted to
be one of the choicest spots in the val
ley. Innumerable have been the kind
nesses of our sympathetic landlord.
More than 2000 trees for ornament and
shade await transplanting. An irri
gation plant is to be purchased for our
use and paid for in easy installments.
The land itself is sold at a ' reduced
price and in time payments. "
"And the colonists, what sort of peo
ple are they?"
"Well, they were the pick of 400 fam
ilies numbering 2000 persons, who had
applied, mostly living in San Francis
co. Ninety per cent of the applicants
had had more or less experience, hav
ing drifted to the city, and being anx
ious for an opportunity of getting bark
into the country. All of the selected
families were able-bodied agricultu
rists. For three months past they had
been attending weekly colonist meet
ings, at which Professors Hilgard and
Jaffa and a Salvationist graduate of
the Agricultural College had been giv
ing lectures on a variety of farming
I'subjects."

Heart Trouble Responsible for the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 15.â Charles M.
Shortridge, editor and proprietor of the
San Jose Mercury, is critically ill at
Gilroy Hot Spring* and his physicians
have little hope of his recovery. Mr.
Shortridge has had several severe at
tacks of heart trouble recently, and in
the latter part of December was taken
to the springs in the hope that the
mountain air and mineral baths would
benefit him. Some improvement re
sulted and he was contemplating re
turning to San Jose, but new compli
cations set in and yesterday his con
dition became alarming. There has
been no Improvement since.
Charles M. Shortridge became much
worse yesterday, and is now dangerous-
ly ill. " His physicians expect the end
to come within the next twenty-four
hours. Mrs. Shortridge and daughter,
accompanied by Dr. Curnow, the fam
ily physician, of San Jose, arrived at
Gilroy to-day. >
PROPOSED ANNEXATION
OF JAMAICA TO CANADA.
MONTREAL, Quebec, Jan. 15.â W. Bi
Chapman, a well-known capitalist of Ja
maica, In an interview to-day, stated
that the party in favor of the annexa
tion of the island to Canada has grown
to great strength and that definite meas<
ures are on foot to secure the union. It
is the intention to unite all the British
possessions in the Western Hemisphere
into one dominion, and Chapman says
definite encouragement has been offered
by the British Government.
'While this may bo to the advantage of
the empire, Canadian politicians are pro
testing vigorously against boing har
nessed with such incompatible int.
The differences, they say. b.-tween prov
inces now in the confederation are suf
ficiently rampant to justify opposition.
Some years ago a delegation from Ja
maica broached the subject of union to
the Canadian Parliament, but the pro
lect was overwhelmingly defeated. The
present party intends to appeal to the
British Government and is sanguine of
success. The leaders here claim that if
the scheme goes through all the strength
will be taken from the confederation and
stilt-- that Canada will resist it by all
possible means.

C. B. Mast, a keeper In the Sheriff's
ofno\ looked upon the Tine when It
vas carmiro in the ouo last Brlday,
and in consequence has been "laid off"
for a week. Ordinarily not much at
tention would have been paid to so
common an occurrence, but on this
particular occasion Mast was under
the influence while taktnjc a Chinese
under sentence of death by hanging to
San Quentin and ran grave risks of the
escape Of his char.cc.
Mast was s^nt t>> San Quentin with
Wee Tung:, the Chinese who murdered
his uncle because he "talkee too
muchee." in his care, on Friday morn
inp. On his way from the Sheriff's of
flcp to the County Jail he m"t a friend
and the two had several drinks. The
liquor had taken no perceptible c-ffect
when he reached thÂ° jail, otherwise
Chief Jailer Sattler would not have in
trusted the condemned Chinese to his
custody. But when the keeper and the
condemned man got aboard the ferry
boat the fact that Mast had been
drinking too much was clearly in evi
dence.
It is asserted that Mast went to sleep
on the train and left the Chinese to
amuse himself as best he might, and
that at Green Brae station he was
awakened by ML Herzoer. a San Rafael
merchant. Anyway, the sight of a
drunken man taking a prisoner to the
State Prison, handcuffed though he
was, attracted considerable attention
and a deal of unfavorable comment.
Warden Hale happened to be on the
same boat and train that conveyed
Mast and Wee Tung to their destina
tion, and kept an eye on their actions.
As soon ns he reached Pan Quentin he
immediate ly ti lephoned Sheriff Whelan
that Mast was intoxicated, but that the
prisoner had been safely jailed. When
Mast came back to make his report he
for a month.
Deputy Sheriff Clack stated last
x that Mast has the reputation
ng a sober, reliable man, and that
he himself believed the keeper would
not have drunk anything at all if he
had not met a particular friend whom
he had not seen for a long time. This,
st, la what the suspended keeper
told ("'lack. Mast also denied that he
had gone to sleep on the train.
Tung was placed in the "hoodoo cell"
in Murderers' Row, and will expiate his
crime on the same gallows as did Dur
rant. on March 8. It is said that
every man confined in the "hoodoo cell"
has met his death on the gallows â there
being not a single rase to be quoted
where the courts or the Governor have
ped in to interfere with the ukase
of the law. p

The first brace were loosed after the
elusive hare shortly after 1 p. m. The
rain was descending in solid columns

velvet. But there was no lack of en
thusiasm. Crowded beneath the sh>i

present gave vent to their opinions and
backed them with a vivacity that no
rain could dampen. With two excep
tions all the dogs nominated were sent

was due to accident Incurred in train

slips he lost sight of the hare, and al
though he regained It within perhaps
two seconds, he was thereafter a sub

Fleetwood next put out the slight fa
vorite Wayfarer (who should not have
ruled a favorite), and Carlotta sent j

THE PORTABLE STOMACH
THE report that some doctor abroad had de
prived a patient of a troublesome stomach has
begun to have the inevitable elTect. Every
doctor seems t<- want to do the same thing and is
in quest of a stomach for which the owner has no
strongly marked alTcction. Twice has the opera
tion been essayed in this country, and twice has the
patient died, but in each instance, it is gratifying to
note, not until admiring science had pronounced the
operation successful. Here arises a point of some
delicacy. What constitutes success? The mere re
moval of an internal organ can scarcely be thus
characterized, for Jack the Ripper never fell short
of accomplishing this when he set out to do it, and
any butcher could take a cleaver and achieve the
same feat. If the purpose of eliminating the stom
ach from the human economy is to cure the ache of
it without regard to the longevity of the original

way of the mortal frame is sufficient token that suc
cess has crowned the efforts of the operator, and
whether the frame collapse is a collateral consider

due to a difrerence in the point of view. The first

SOLDIERS' HOMES.
REPORTS from Washington are to the effect
that strong prepare has been brought to bear
upon Congress to transfer the management of
national homes lor disabled volunteer soldiers from
the present control to that of the War Department.
It is asserted by the advocates of the change that the
present management of the homes is expensive and
cumbersome and that there would be a gain of both
efficiency and economy by the transfer.
The effect of the proposed movement would be
to take the homes for disabled volunteer soldiers
from the control of officers who, like the inmates,
were volunteers, and place them under that of a
bureau created fur the purpose in the War Depart
ment, where the management would be in the hands
of officers of the regular army. It would revive the
old strife between the volunteer and the West Point
graduate, and it is by no means certain the expected
benefits would accrue.
According to statistics compiled by Andrew J.
Smith, governor of the Pacific Coast national homes
for disabled volunteer soldiers, the argument for
economy is on the side of the present management
r?ther than on that of the reformers. Figures taken
for the three fiscal years ending June 30, tÃq6, show
the average cost of maintenance per capita in the
soldicr=' homes to have been $118 2R. while the re
ports of the inspector-general, U. S. A., show the
average cost of maintenance per cap!ta at the regu
lar army soldiers' home at Washington to have
been ?2ni 11.
While the comparison with the Soldiers' Home
at Washington is hardly a fair test of the compara
tive merits of volunteer and regular army adminis
tration, inasmuch as the home and its grounds at
the capital are show place? and are kept like a park
and a summer home for the President, nevertheless
the showing made for the management of the vol
unteer homes is sufficiently excellent to throw the
burden 6i proof upon those who maintain there
would be greater economy under the control of a
War Department bureau.
On general principles the management of the na
tional homes f<>r disabled volunteer soldiers should
be left as it is in the hands of their former comrades
in arms. The War Department has enough to do with
out creating a new bureau of service for it to per
form. There may be reforms needed in the exist
ing management, for no management is perfect, but
such as are requisite can be obtained just as well
without making the radical change proposed.
Investigation of the reason that trolley cars are
fenderless may win for members of the Grand Jury
the approval of their own conscience?, but it will
not equip a single car with a fender. The Southern
Pacific does not care whether or not it kills people,
nor does it wince under the occasional rebuke of the
Coroner. The only way to reform it will be to make
it pay roundly for a few of its homicides, or if by
chance the trolley were to catch a Vining or two
the effect would be salutary.

WHY ?
CERTAIN members of the Prison Board
seem to be punishing themselves with the de
lusion that The Call has a malicious or polit
ic. il grievance against them; that its exposure of the
glaring and inexcusable subversion of the Ostrom
law has a sinister and shrouded motive to injure, to
blemish willfully, their individual good name.
Nothing in intent could be further removed from
the purpose of the inquiries made as to the manage
ment of the San Quentin jutemill and the disposal
of its product.
Let there be no plausible misunderstanding of the
interest of The Call in this matter. It was privately
informed of illegal transactions which received the
approval of the board, and urgently requested to de
fend the law. The informant of The Call is a reput
able citizen of the State; indeed an officer of the lnw
himself, to whom the conspiracy of violations of the
Ostrom act was brought home in his capacity as a
public servitor.
After a painstaking investigation covering a pe
riod of two weeks, the mismanagement of the prison
iuiebag product, and the reckless juggling with the
statutory restrictions supposed to govern its sale,
were so plainly proved that The Call felt in duty
bound to place the subject, in its various phases, be
fore the people. It has been prompted by no desire
to create sensation or defame public officials.
Evidently the Prison Directors have a mistaken
notion as to their duties and powers. It is no suffi
cient apology for their actions that they, and not
Senator Ostrom, devised the statute of 1893. This
they assert. Why they should have drafted a law
and urged its enactment only to violate its provi
- in detail and condemn it in their report of iÃg6
is not explained.
Selling sacks to middlemen and favored commis
sion houses might have been a prudent expedient in
1897 ii the process of such sales inured to the benefit
of those whom the law should forefend.
An unprejudiced review of the situation will sat
isfy any tyro in business affairs thai the boar.!
conscious in the early spring of 1897 that a prosper
ous year was promised to the farmers, that grain
sacks would be in full demand and that the Calcutta
"Big Five" were particularly and peculiarly inter
ested in advancing the prices.
The speedy exhaustion of the San Quentin sur
plus for future delivery and the subsequent fixation
of price by the board at a higher point than was
pegged for the surplus sales facilitated the upward
movement. As if this were not going far enough in the
wrong direction, the board on March 20, before the
sack surplusage had been delivered and paid for,
and while the Calcutta middlemen were dealing ac
tively in future deliveries, raised the price to $5 40
per hundred, a rate in excess of reigning Calcutta
quotations.
If any sound business principle actuated the
Prison Board in this course it has not been pre
sented to the attention of The Call. The inflated
price into which the board seem to have blown a
goodly quantity of what the epigrammatic Emory
Storrs described as "east wind" was fixed by them
in the current products of the mill. Their own ex
pert accountant shows that the average cost of that
product was $4 24 per hundred. The law distinctly
restrains the board from fixing a price in excess of
1 cent per bag above cost. They marked bags up 16
cents per hundred above cost figures.
Why?
AN INTERESTING DEBATE.
RARELY does the Congressional Record con
tain anything of interest to the general
reader. Even when debates are liveliest in
Congress the Record manages by eliminations to
make them appear of that kind of decorum which is
always dull. Sometimes, however, it has the good
luck to get out a live issue, and that luck attended
it in the publication of the number containing the
discussion in the House on the civil service law on
January 7.
Mr. Gillett of Massachusetts, a warm supporter of
the mugwump system of civil service, cited the ad
ministration of the House of Representatives it
self as an evidence of the evil results of leaving the
selection of officials to party patronage. "We have,"
he said, "more employes, we pay them higher sal
aries, we have poorer service than under any other
system." Dropping into poetry, he described the
way to success iv getting on the payroll of the
House as follows:
"It lies through two swing doors, swung to.
The attendance is always full.
Some by the door marked 'Push' get through,
And the rest by the door marked 'Pull.' "
That scored one for the civil service examination
side, but the other party got their innings when Mr.
Paris pointed out thai ability to pass an examination
does not imply ability to perform good executive
service. Robert Ingersoll, he said, could pass an
examination in theology, but that would not fit him
to serve as pastor in an orthodox church. On the
other hand, a man who could not pass an examina
tion in the simplest matters might have the exact
capacity for the work required of him. To prove that
he told the story of a man in his city who had suc
cessfully managed a large mercantile business and
acquired therein a fortune, but who, being
selected to take an inventory of a stock of goods,
wrote "sox" for socks, and when his attention was
called to it as an error changed it by writing
"soxes."
Mr. Mahany made a good speech and won ap
plause in maintenance of the theory that ability to
get an office is a sufficient evidence of ability to fill
it, and that examinations are a waste of time. He
laid it down as an axiom that "any man is capable
of administering any job he can get." Carrying his
argument to its logical and supreme conclusion, he
declared, "It is the greatest glory of our Govern
ment that almost any man you meet on the street
is capable of being Chief Magistrate of the United
Stales, and if capable of wielding that high power
is certainly capable of administering a subordinate
office."
Mr. Kerr showed the absurdity of the examina
tion system by citing some of the questions candi
dates had to answer. Two of these are as follows:
Two-thirds of seven-ninths of what number is a half
of eight and two-fifths divided by fourteen and
seven-tenths less fourteen and two-sevenths? A
man weighing seventy-two pounds runs with a ve
locity of six against a standing but not resisting man
whose weight is ninety-six pounds. What is the re
sult?
Taken altogether it was a good debate, and even
if not instructive to future generations was at any
rate calculated to add to the gayety of nations.

THE SAX FKAXCTSCO CALL, SUXDAT, JAXTJAIIY 10, 1898,
THE OPPOSITION TO McKENNA.
BY the discussion in the Senate on Friday the
public is made aware of the nature and extent
of the opposition to the confirmation of At
torney-General McKenna as Justice of the Supreme
Court, and his friends may congratulate him on the
showing. During the debate he had the support of
the strong men of the Senate, and Tiis opponents
could do no more than postpone the confirmation
for a week.
Senator Allen, who spoke for the opponents of
Mr. McKenna, disclaimed any knowledge of the
truth of such charges as have been made against
him. He, however, read over all the protests that
have been sent to Washington from this coast and
asked time to investigate them. He laid stress upon
the assertion made in some of these that the At
torney-General lacks the legal attainments necessary
to an aspirant for the Supreme bench, and also em
phasized the report that large corporations have
been instrumental in procuring the nomination.
Such being the sum and substance of the charges
of the opposition, it did not take the friends of Mr.
McKenna long to dispose of them. Senator Hoar,
speaking as chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
stated that the committee has investigated all the
charges and found there is no truth in them. The
greater number of the charges, he said, had been
made for the American Protective Association, and
as they had been founded solely upon the fact that
Mr. McKenna is a Catholic by religion, they had
not been deemed worthy of serious consideration.
From the tone of the discussion which followed it
is evident a large majority of the Senators took the
same view as the Judiciary Committee. No Senator
undertook to maintain the truth or even the ap
proximate accuracy of the charges. Senator Allen
himself disavowed the championship ot them. They
were treated as unworthy of consideration and
served no purpose other than that of giving to the
friends of Mr. McKenna a welcome opportunity to
refute them in open Senate and dispose of them once
and for all.
It is gratifying that both the Senators from Cali
fornia cordially supported the candidacy of their
follow Californian. Senator White, though a Dem
ocrat and opposed in politics to Mr. McKenna, bore
witness to the fact that he is an honorable man, a
competent lawyer, a just jurist, and declared he
would vote fur his confirmation. Senator Perkins
was equally vigorous in refuting the charges of the
opposition and very pertinently pointed out that
Judge McKcnna's record on the circuit bench suffi
ciently attests his fitness for promotion to the higher
ofiice to which he has been nominated.
The whole course of the fight against McKenna
has been a new illustration of the old spirit of an
tagonism and jealousy that in the past has defeated
the aspirations of so many Californians and kept
the State from holding a rightful prestige at Wash
ington. Fortunately this case has not resulted as
those of the past. A new era has dawned for the
people of this coast. Mean and unfounded charges
urged by petty spite to prevent the advancement of
honorable men are now treated here as in Washing
ton as unworthy of serious consideration.
A SUMMARY OF CURRENGY REFORM
THERE are ten different kinds of currency cir
culating in this country and authorized by its
laws. These are gold coins, silver dollars, sub
sidiary silver coins, gold certificates, silver certifi
cates, United States notes, currency certificates,
treasury notes of 1890 and national bank notes.
It will be seen that al! of these originate in Fed
eial authority, and there seems room for question
ing the necessity for so many kinds of money com
ing from the same source. Putting all metallic
money in one group and placing with it such paper
currency as is merely representative of metal like
the silver certificate, the tendency of legislation
would seem to be wise when it aims at one single
kind of paper currency, safeguarded In its issue, se
cure in its redemption and uniform In its value in
all parts of the country.
The report of the Volunteer Monetary Commis
sion aims at this simplifying of the currency. Its de
liberations were directed to the presentation of a
plai> that will:
1. Remove all doubts about our standard of value.
2. Give the United States the best credit of any
nation.
y Purge our currency system of features shown
1 y experience to be weak and dangerous.
4. Provide a paper currency convertible into gold
and therefore equal to gold at all times and in all
places adequate in volume to the needs of business,
with a quality of growth and elasticity enabling its
automatic adjustment to variations in demand and
capable of distribution throughout the country as
want and use may demand.
5. To so utilize existing silver dollars as to main
tain their parity with gold without imposing undue
burdens on the treasury.
6. To avoid injurious contraction of the cur
rency.
7. To avoid issue of interest bearing bonds except
in case of unlooked-for emergency, but to author
ize their issue when necessary to preserve the na
tional credit.
8. To so separate public and private credit that
weakness in the former may not destroy the latter.
It is expected that if the system recommended t>y
the commission be enacted into law we will secure
stability of standard, two kinds of currency, metal
lic and paper, of equal value and each good a3 gold.
The paper will be a bank issue, as well secured as the
present national bank note, and its permanence will
not be affected by the final payment of the national
debt, and, therefore, the disappearance of United
States bonds now required as security for the bank
notes. The greenbacks and treasury notes will grad
ually disappear without perceptible increase in the
bonded debt and without contracting the volume of
currency. The new national banking system will be
unrestricted and banks with $25,000 capital may be
formed.
In this feature the West has a special interest.
The function of a bank is to distribute the surplus
capital of the country and put it as a loan fund with
in reach of men who must use their credit in their
business. A proper distribution of this loan fund
will avert frequently the necessity of mortgaging
land and will give a readier and cheaper use of credit
than now.
In this State it will be found especially useful to
organize banks on $25,000 capital in the sections
where money is needed in handling the fruit crop,
and the new law, if properly made use of, would in
terpose protection between the producer and the
commission man in a form very useful to the pro
ducer.
The courts have given a notorious pickpocket the
privilege of "leaving town," but if the police have

of reeking with goodness rind hanging

It is impossible to regard the un

favor. The manner in which it darts
upon the Innocent citizen and sends
him in irregular sections to the Morgue
is bound to create hostile prejudice.
Even the pedestrian has a sort of right
to live, provided he is agile enough to
dodge. Yet it is with a thrill of ad
miration I learn that the trolley has
run down a beer wagon. Heretofore
the beer wagon has been regarded as
Invincible. It has been conceded the
kingship of v the thoroughfare, and the
multitude has either scurried from it
or been sorry. But the beer wagon
has met its master. It has often puz
zled people who happened to think of
it why the beer wagon has not been
adopted as an engine of war. No char
lot with glittering blades protruding Im
politely from the hub has ever pursued
the tenor of its way or mowed down the
populace with a more cheerful Best.
Now it has lost its prentige. Instead of
being a thing of terror it is a vulgar
vehicle for the transference of kegs,
and instead of being the boss of the
road would on meeting a trolley-ear
take Its axle between its wheels and
run.
It la not surprising to observe that
another "model" young man has gone
away and that a large sum of his em
ployer's money is keeping him com
pany. When a young man gets this
adjective fastened to him he must
either do something like this or violate
precedent. There is no young man who
deserves so ill of the world as to be re
garded as a "model." In fact, there is
no line of conduct he may pursue that
can Justify the placing upon him of
the handicap constituted by the ridi
ulous title. The youth unfortunate

it. If the natural Impulse to be honest,

better. When one has been taught to
look up to and emulate the example of
a certain "mod"l" and the model sud
denly lights out for Canada, embarrass
ment is certain to rise. The exact point
at which a "model" ceases to be this
and becomes a horrible example is dif-
Iflcult to define. If the rising genera

the fortune to die without being found

that I venture to speak of Parson Da
vis. As there may be more than one
Parson Davis, it is necessary to speci
fy that these few remarks apply to him
of Oakland. This Davis is a source of
endless pleasure. His presence causes
a smile to flit across the face of nature.
If it were possible to imagine a fat
beam of sunshine wearing a plug hat
he would be it. Some have found fault
because Davis occasionally thinks he is
a circus, they affirming that he is only
a clown, which is clearly an under es
timate He is the circus, ringmaster,
bandwagon, dog under the same, case
of performing monkeys, and all the side
shows, as well as the concert-now
about-to-take-place. In other words,
and to abandon figurative speech, Da
vis is a daisy. Erring persons prone
to rudeness might call him a nilu. He
can sing, dance, lecture, act, strike
more poses than a contortionist, has
good taste in ties, gives first class spir
itual advice, wears his hair wide and
long, entertains his friends and an ex
alted opinion of Davis. That's enough
for any Oakland salary. I am unable
to credit the rumor that at San Quen
tin he was observed to swing a bottle
above his head, a rumor which has
â  1 him a high grade of mental an
guish. Nor do I believe that if he did
swing a bottle it contained a liquid
more exhilarating than ginger ale. He
was over there with a gang known as
the Examiner push. When he went to
the condemned cell to snatch a brand
from the burnine, what if he was
merely a disguised reporter under con
tract to describe the process at space
rates? It is not for the worldly to lay
down a course for the professionally
righteous. He may have had a laud
able purpose. The gang by which he
was surrounded was godless to a de
gree. No finer material ever fired evan
gelistic zeal. The Examiner prize fight
era were fierce and clamorous. When
he found them not amenable to exhor
tation, perhaps he felt an impulse to
bring them by carnal means to a state
of grace. In this way the swinging of
a bottle could easily be excused, and
had he brought it down upon the pate
of the unregenerate could even be
praised, though the ginger ale had been
sacrificed. Whether the Rev. Mr. Davis
acquired $50,000 worth of the high grade
mental anguish hereinbefore men
tioned, is of course a matter not to be
passed upon by me, but at any rate he
has the satisfaction of knowing that
he emerged from the scrimmage with
his halo polished to a new luster, hi?
dazzling hat only subtly askew, and
his self esteem without spot nr blemish.
Now that his conerreeation have seen
fit to uphold him, far be it from me to
call attention to the fact that the con
gregation had the joy of being absent
while their pastor was on exhibition
with a rabble of co-Avorkers at the
prison.
When an attorney named Terry, per
forming the sacred rites of his calling
before Judge Daingerfield. dashed a
glass of water Into the face of the op

bench that he was in contempt. So
far as Is learned this closed the epi
sode. Simply to be told that one is
in contempt, one knowing this in ad
vance, does not seem to constitute a
strong restraining influence. If Terry
had been sent to jail the effort of spec
tators to avoid sharing in the contempt
would have been less arduous.

Money has been lavished on the fam

happy way to carrion feast. Re
porters capable of doing pood work
have been trained to be maudlin, tear
ful, slobbery. Tn vain the public re
volted against indecency long drawn
out. To so much as to make known
in general terms the protracted and
disgusting programme adhered to
would be offensive to morals. But
there was a purpose behind it all. The
giant Intelligence which pilots the Ex
aminer thought that at the last it
would get a confession from the mur
derer. With this end in view it scat
tered money freely, hired men and
women to camp by the condemned,
ever hoping for a startling climax. At
the end its emissaries swarmed,,
buzzed, flew in eccentric circles. They
indulged in pugilism, hysteria, rant,
rot. They brought a minister of the
gospel to the scene and at their be
hest he disgraced his high calling.
And the result of it all was that they
did not get a particle of information
which representatives of any other pa
per failed to get, though the Examiner
did publish much no respectable jour
nal would have given room. In brief,
It started out to cover Itself with tbe
peculiar glory it love* and succeeded
in covering itself with odium. The Ex

paperdom, its nose for news a snout

He had a faithful wife.
Who eaid they couldn't buy him,
You bet (quoth she) your life:
So then arose with noise renewed
The sound of party strife.
But Griffiths nf Ohio,
Judged by the thins? you did,
I reach the sad conclusion
That Hanna raised his bid;
Tet trust to your discretion
To keep the figure hid.
I cannot refrain from saying that
some of the best writing in connection
with the Durrant case was from the
pen of Miriam Michelson. Yet Miss
Michelson was at no time required to
dance attendance on the assassin nor
any of his tribe. She did not deal with
the terrible scenes of which he was the
central figure, nor indulge In tearful
exclamations. Her work was In the
nature of a study of the broader ques
tions involved, and she brought to
their treatment keen perception, a fine
faculty of analysis and a broad men
tal grasp. In addition to all these she
possesses a most happy and incisive
faculty of expression.
Far to the Klondike's frozen wilds, where
roams the polar bear,
Rich nuggets hide deep under ground and frost
rides in the air;
One day there went an aged bard to write him
â what he saw,
And getting chilled he quick made haste be
side a stove to thaw.
Alas'. Alack! when he got thawed, oh! awful
thing to hear.
He realized with pang most keen that he had
sloughed an ear.
Yet this is not the worst to tell; the bard Is
coming home;
All chances are when he arrives he'll straight
wuy slough a pome.
Last -week I felt an impulse to write
something harsh about the Durrants.
Thiit the editor drew a long mark
through it did not seem to me then the
part of wisdom. I am willing to con
cede now that he was right, and to
wager that this statement will receive
his smiling approval. That the father
and mother both had done much to for
feit sympathy nobody who was at San
Quentin during the last hours of the
son would think of denying, and yet
human judgment is apt to be unduly
harsh. I came back from the scene of
the murderer's death, with its sordid
preliminaries and its ghastly after
math, certain that the fatal rope would
be for sale and the body go to the high
est bidder. It did not occur to me that
the Durrants would rise to the height
of trying to respect the last wishes of
the law's victim. They seem to have
done this, and their efforts met an op
position hard to understand, brutal I
am sure and senseless I am inclined to
believe. The idea that a body, inert,
lifeless, the malign spirit that had ani
mated it gone, could not be reduced
to innocuous ash without desecrating
the place of flame, strikes me as silly
to a point almost grotesque. The con
sideration shown the assassin while he
was living was too great by far. The
shame heaped upon the broken and
empty shell of clay taken from the
scaffold of justice was equally without
excuse. The crude old plan of leav
ing the bones of the hanged clanking
Ih chains at the roadside is shocking,
but it is the same idea that denied to
Theodore Durrant's body the embrace
of the grave, tho embrace in which all
lie equal, and would have kept it from
the purifying fire, where secrets defy
the prying eyes of science.
"ITALIAN MISSSION."
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: Under
this heading there appeared in your paper
of Friday, Jan. 7. an article which was
calculated to mislead. The burden of the
article was that it was intended to estab
lish an Italian mission in connection with
St. P.eter's Protestant Episcopal Church,
on the corner of Stockton and Filbert
streets.
While it is true that the matter has
been talked of at various times, it is en
tirely untrue that any definite plans are
now being formed for undertaking this
work; and. furthermore, no definite plan
could ever be formulated without the ac
tive co-operation of the rector and vestry
of the parish with the Bishop of the dio
cese. I desire, therefore, to say that the
Bishop' the Woman's Auxiliary and tho (
rector and vestry of St. Peters have ab
solutely no idea now of doing- any such
thing. MARPON D. WILSON,
Rector of St. Peter's Church.

evident relish and confined the fight to
the stanch old parent of all the classesâ
the Fortnightlyâ and to Its latest off- :
I spring, the Terpslchoreans. Like a gro
j tesque Bhadow, the portly form of Green
| way hovered in the background, with an ;
"I neither palliate nor deny" air, sort of
casting oil upon the troubled waters. The
I ancient tale retold has, however, one
atoning feature. Mrs. Wells, mother of
Marie Wells, debutante, has come to the
front, makes the fight a more or less
personal one between herself and Mrs.
Monroe Salisbury, the organizer of the
Fortnightly, and offers much spicy matter
In evidence.
According to Mrs. Wells, Miss Marie
has, previous to this seasonâ the season
that has witnessed her u-nfold her dainty
petals and bloom from a shrinking hud
to a full-blown belleâ been a prominent
member of the Fortnightlys, and always
j attended their dances. But this season
: all that has been changeu; and thereby
hangs a not uninteresting tale of "cash
ambrosial cash."
Said Mrs. Wells: "Wo have always been
i good friends of Mrs. Salisbury. My hus
, band and she were boy and girl friends,
i and they have always called each other
'Kate' and 'George.'
"Mrs. Salisbury knew Marie was to
come out this season, and she said all
sorts of nice things about the child to
Mr. Wells. She said Marie would get on
wonderfully in society if she could only
i be brought out under proper auspicesâ
I that because I am not a society woman.
Mr. Wells' only reply was that he had no
ambition to see his daughter a belle, but
was quite Batisfled that she should be
Just such a care-free, happy, good little
I girl as she is.
"Mrs. Salisbury, however. Insisted so
I that Mr. Wells spoke to me rather won
: derlngly of her persistence. But finally
j there came from the lady a request for
I a loan.
"Mrs. Salisbury wanted $3000 very badly,
! and she asked Mr. Wells for it. Mr.
| Wells told her he really couldn't spare
j the money, as he expected a call from
| his Mexican mines that would take all
! his ready cash. Mrs. Salisbury s;<id if
j Mr. Wells wanted to he could* get the
I money for her from a certain capitalist,
; and when Mr. Wells declined she was
very angry.
"We thought no more about the mat
j ter. Marif signed nway all her germans
[ for the season, never once dreaming that
sho was to Tff; left out of the Fortnightly.
"But her invitation never camp. At
first the child thought it an oversight,
but when our friend Mr. Colin Smith,
1 who knows Mrs. Salisbury very well,
asked her about Marie. Mrs. Salisbury
said that Marie had been very rude to
! her.
"Mr. Smith said he doubted Marie being
' that sort of girl, and Mrs. Salisbury said
: she had been so rude as not to calf upon
j her for a year.
"Now, none of us care at all about
| this. I've been a very happy woman and
I never in society! Mario stems to enjoy
\ it, though, but she has any amount of
I beaus and attentions and Invitations, and
| she is as gay and busy and happy as any
girl could find time to be."
And Mrs. Salisburyâ the center round
: which all goseip revolves, the organizer
I and mainstay of the Fortnightlys. has
i not one word to fs;iy. She treats the mat
! ter with a dignified, silent contempt, evi
dently assuming that her position needs
i no explanation.

Fresno County is preparing to make
an exhibit of her products at the Gold
en Jubilee which will be highly cred
itable to that county. A splendid dis
play of raisins and dri^rl and citrus
fruit will be made, and the matter of
] collecting the exhibit is now being en
ergetically pushed. Messrs. Nourse,
Butler and Hermann of the Chamber
of Commerce of Fresno, who were ap
pointed to get up the exhibit, appeared
before the Board of Supervisors of that
county yesterday, and asked that Horti
cultural Commissioner Marshall be per
! mitted to visit Pan Francisco and re
main in charge of the Fresno County
exhibit during the five w^eks of the
, Golden Jubilee. The Chamber of Com
merce will bear all the expense of his
stay. The Hoard of Supervisors grant
ed the request unanimously.
Mr. Marshall will call" upon the
growers throughout Fresno County and
i collect exhibits, in addition to "those
which hnvp already l.wn pnrmisc<L The
intention is to make the Fresno County
display a striking one at the Jubilee,
and Mr. Marshall will work with that
j end in view. The Chamber of Com-
I merce Is enthusiastic In the matt* r of
i making a notable exhibit, and is work
ing hard to have the county well rep
resented.
One of the most elaborate floats
which will appear in the parade will be
that which will be presented in the
Celtic Division. A committee con
sisting of Colonel T. H. Barry, Frank
I Conklin and P. H. McOinney "have se
lected a design which will picture the
history of Ireland. The float will rep
resent one of the famous round towers
of the ancient isle. This will be pre
f^nt.-d In glistening granite covered
with moss and ivy from Ireland. A wolf
dog. indigenous to that country, will be
a prominent figure. Th.> four prov
inces. Ulster. Munster, Connaught and
Leinster, will ),.â¢ presented by four liv
ing figures. In addition to this thirty
two young ladies borne in the float will
represent the counties of that country.
On the sides th* r.> will be twelve shields
on which will be depleted the charac
teiifttlcs of the most noted heroes in
Irish history. Tn addition to this an
Irish harpist will be sented on the
f the mountain In the r^ar of the
tower, and will play national selections
during th>- parade. Several waterfalls
realistically arranged will add color to
the whole scene.
An invitation was extended last
night to Rrigadfer-Oeneral If. W. Mul
ler, commanding the S. rond Brigade.
X. O. C, of Fresno, asking him and
his staff and command to parade in
this city on Jubilee day. Tf it is Im

General Muller and the officers con
nected with his personal staff will prob
ably be present.

A FINE POINT
OF DIPLOMACY
Vice - President Hobart
Takes Precedence
of Pauncefote.
Thus the Comity of Nations Is
Preserved and All Js
Harmony.
British Government Does Not Hesi
tatÂ» to Come to the Rescue of
Washington Society.
Epec'.al Dlscatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, d. C, Jan. 15.
Washington society is tranquil again,
having settled a momentous question of
social precedence. The British Gov
ernment has decided that the Vice-
President of the United States takes
precedence over the British Embassa
dor, and Sir Julian Pauncefote has, un
der Its instructions, made the first call
on Vice-President Hobart, which the
latter has returned.
The question was raised by Sir Ju- i
Han, under the last administration,
when Vice-President Stevenson good '
naturedly waived his claim of preced
ence, but Vice-President Hobart did not
feel that it was right for him to do so i
and so refused to call upon Sir Julian
Pauncefote until the latter should call !
upon him.
As the dispute, although compara
tively unimportant, was liable to make
some friction at official functions. Pres
ident McKinley wrote, unofficially, to
Embassador Hay, with the approval of
Vice-President Hobart, asking him to
sound the British foreign office on the
subject, with the understanding that
whatever it decided would be accepted
by the United States.
Colonel Hay did so and replied that
the British Government accorded the
precedence to the Vice-President, and
that was quickly followed last week
by Sir Julian's formal call on Vice-
President Hobart.
Thus ends a controversy which has
made infinite talk in official and social
circles, although it has not figured
much in the newspapers.

PEKING, Jan 15.â Germany has de

It is reported that a railroad from
Kiaochau to Binan Fu has been agreed

rights for a mile on each Bide of the
line and the Chinese to be admitted as

EMPEROR WILLIAM
TWICE INTERVIEWS THE
RUSSIAN EMBASSADOR
There Is Yet Uncertainty and Uneasiness as
to Japan's Future Steps Regard
ing China and Korea.
BERLIN, Jan. 15.â Twice during the
past week Emperor William called
unannounced at the Russian Embassy
and had long conversations with
Count yon Osten-Sacken, the Russian
Embassador. It Is learned on good
authority that the conversations were,
solely on the far Eastern question. The
Emperor La uncertain as to Japan's
future steps in regard to China and
Korea, and Count yon Osten-Sacken,
on the strength of recent St. Peters
burg information, was able to en
lighten his Majesty fully on the sub
ject.
The entente with Russia, continues
undisturbed. The Czar in a lengthy
personal letter explained to Emperor
William Bhartly after the seizure of
Port Arthur Russia's Intentions and
plans regarding Manchuria and North
China.
' A correspondent learns that the
â whole of Trane-Caucasia, including
the big province of Turkestan, will
shortly be placed under thÂ« control of
to Governor-General, probably a lius-
Eian Grand Duke, who will have prac
tically unlimited military administra
tive power. It is believed that by such
a measure the welfare of the popula
tion of 25.000,000 eouls, inhabiting a
territory separated from the central
Government by thousands of miles,
can better be assured. The changed
relations between China and Germany
are strikincly shown in the fact that
the new Chinese Ambassador, who has
just arrived, is accredited to Berlin
only, and not to several courts as
heretofore, and his corps of secretaries
and attaches has been increased from
six to thirty.
Tho existing commercial treaty with
China will be retained, although in an
interview with a correspondent the
Embassador, Guehlnan, said: "By the
desire of both countries some modifi
cations will be negotiated. Generally
Breaking-, Germany is satisfied with
the old treaty, but she desires certain
improvements in regard to the admis
sion of German iron ware, lamps, no
tions, etc., while China wishes better
terms in regard to the duty on teas."
The Embassador is delighted with
hi? reception by Baron yon Bulow, the
Minister for Foreign Affairs, which
has confirmed the statement that the
relations between China and Germany
are excellent. notwithstanding the
seizure of Kiauch.-iu Bay.
The Colonial Office is preparing a
civil administration for Kiaochau, and
the German Consul, Stebel, at Shang
hai, is organizing a provisional ad
ministration. The. first reports are
anxiously awaited. It is intended that
the customs and internal service offi
cials at Kiaochau â¢ shall be Germans
versed in both Chinese and English, so
that the commercial interests of the
port may be better protected.
The bill asking for appropriations
for the expenses of the Chinese expe
dition cannot be presented until the
next Reichstag meets.

FRENCH FORCES
PENETRATE TO
BAHR-GHAZAL
Fear of War Will Not Stop Great
Britain prom Attempting to
Drive Out Invaders.
LONDON. Jn..15. â Temporarily overshadowed, the movements of the
French on the upper Nile are again becoming unpleasantly prominent
to those who Imagined that' England had undisputed claims upon
those regions. It is immaterial to discuss the exact whereabouts of
the French expeditions. It suffices that, according to the bulk of evi
dence, they have penetrated to Bahr-Ghazal, the most fertile province
of the Egyptian Soudan, with the distinct mandate of their Govern
ment.
If this is true and the declarations of successive British Cabinets
mean anything, M. Hanotaux has brought about a casus belli. Thus
far M. Hanotaux seems to have the advantage; but the game is dan
gerous. Fear of war with France will not stop Great Britain from re
covering the whole Egyptian Soudan and driving out any French ex
peditions which may be found there when, in the opinio-n of Marquis
of Salisbury, the proper time has arrived.
In th<^ meantime. Prince Henry of Orleans Is fitting out at Marseilles
and evidently with the approval of the Government an armed expedi
tion to subdue the Equatorial provinces which the Negus presented,
claiming they had belonged to Abyssinia In prehistoric times; but in
reality these provinces are identical with those Great Britain is Reek
ing to restore to Egypt. So, perhaps, there is some truth in the story
that the activity of the British is due to the Egyptian intelligence de
partment learning that the French Abyssinian troops have reached
Fashoda; that King Menelik is preparing reinforcements with the in
tention of following up this success, and that a common policy, which
is morally supported by Russia, unites France and Abyssinia.
There are persistent repoTts of grave troubles threatening Persia.
The Shah's sovereignty has always been shaky, and it la now affirmed
to be rapidly slipping away from his grasp. Indeed, the situation at
Teheran is described as being so precarious that a crfup d'etat may
be precipitated at any moment. Probably the murder of Greaves, the
English telegraph operator, and the outbreak at Mekran are connect
ed with the tendency to revolt in Persia.
It is believed in well-informed circles that the dispatch of Indian
troops to the Persian Gulf is due to general unrest.
The news that Sir William Lockhart, the commander of the British
forces on the Indian frontier, has postponed his journey homeward. In
the expectation of a settlement with the Afridls, who are seemingly de-
F-irous o-f submitting, points to the early conclusion of the most serious
of the quartet of "little wars" in which Great Britain is engaged, and
which will probably absorb the whole of the budget surplus.
MR. MENOCAL`S
EXPLANATION
Tells of the Construction
of the Big Brooklyn
Drydock.
Was Not Present When the
Faulty Work Was
Done.
Upon Bec-elpt of the Order the Civil
Engineer Will ReUirn to Face
Charges.
rlgtot MW. by Jam*s Gordon Bennett.
PANAMA, Jan. 15.â The Herald's cor
respondent with the Nicaraguan Canal
Commission cables from the Granada:
The first knowledge of the order to Civ
il En^'in-f-r Menocal to return to the
United States in connection with the
faulty construction of dry-dock No. 3 at
the Brooklyn Navy Yard was given to
the commission and Mr. Menocal by the
Herald correspondent this morning, and
caused much surprise. Pending the re
ceipt of orders Mr. Menocal will con
tinue with the commission, and will re
turn at once on their receipt. His
place will be taken by some engineer
familiar -with the canal line, probably
H. C. Miller, now between Greytown
and Ochoa. Mr. Menocal said to me:
"I have no doubt as to the outcome.
I was the supervisor, but had several
assistants, and could not personally
s;h ervise all the work day and ntght.
The drilling was done in very treach
erous land, and the leak resulted prob
ably from this work. It could not
have been foreseen. The contractor is
an honest man. After the work was
completed and successfully tested, and
he had been paid and the contract can
celed and the leak occurred, he wrote
to the Navy Department offering to
repair the damage."
Mr. Menocal's explanation â¢will ho
that he was inspecting the work at Key
West when the work was done which
resulted in the leak.

INDIA AND THE
GOLD STANDARD
A Speech on Finances
Made by Sir James
Westland.
Great Advance In Prosperity
Makes the Prospects Far
Brighter.
LJi-i.^ters of the Past "Year Have Been
Followed by a Most Bountiful
Harvest.
Epe-lal Dispatch to The Call.
CALCUTTA, Jan. 15.â Sir Jamea
"Westland, the Finance Minister of the
Council, at yesterday:* meeting of that
body, made a speech in which he said
he was unable to give a final reply to
the question of the Introduction of a
gold standard. One thing was clear,
he continued â a gre"at advance had
been made in the direction contemplat
ed by the authors of the policy of 1593,
namely, the gold standard would be
come possible. Many obscure points
had been determined by actual experi
ence. The disasters of 1597 had been
followed by a bountiful harvest, and
lh" renewal of the trade discussions of
last autumn had prepared the public
and official opinion in England for the
possible necessity of the. gold standard,
which might involve the actual diver
sion for Indian purposes of a certain
amount of gold fro-m the general avail
able stock.
The speaker said also that he was
fully alive to the grave commercial
bearings of the subject, adding that if
the legislation of ]S'.*3 had not been in
troduced exchange might have dropped
to nine pence, and the present situa
tion might have been far worse.
NEW WAGE SCHEDULES IN
NEW ENGLAND COTTON-MILLS.
More Than Fifty Large Corporations Put
the Proposed Reductions Into
Effect.
BOSTON. Jan. 15.â The operatives In
over half a huldred cotton mills in the
New England States ceased to be paid
under the old schedule of prlds when
they left their work to-day. On Monday
morning the general policy of the manu
facturers to reduce wages will be in ef
fect in nearly every mill center in the
vix States. The reduction will then be
come operative in tho cotton mills of
New Bedford. Lawell, Pawtucket and
Blackstono Valley, in Rhode Island and
in the States of Maine and New Hamp
shire.
Ths Fall River Mills, with the excep
tion of three corporations, rut wages
earlier In the month, as did also the
Amoskeng Company of Manchester and
the mills in Salem and a number of
smaller plnces.
N<w Be.lford continues to be the storm
center. The Indications to-night aro that
all tho cotton mills in that city will be
silent for some tlmo to come, the em
ployes having decided almost unanimous
ly not to go X<) work under the lower
wage schedule. The attempts of the
State Board of Arbitration to bring
about a compromise have failed and
there is little chance that the request of
the City Council of New Bedford that
the reduction be postponed one wetk
will have tho desired effect.

LONDON, Jan. 15.â The new phase
Into which the Dreyfus case has en
tered is a distinct advance. The era
of secret courts-martial Is over and a
civil and public court will have to in
vestigate Emile Zola's charges of per
sistent distortion of Justice. The be
havior of military authorities in "burk
ing" the inquiry casts the gravest re
flections upon the oft-asserted honor of
the French army, which has shown an
Obstinate determination to stick to
gether, right or wrong. Outside of
France all Europe believes Dreyfus is
the victim of a conspiracy and the
prosecution of Zola has broadened the
question, for the whole French army is
now virtually placed on trial.
The gravity of the situation is en
hanced because the wh tie i t France is
in a staie of growing hysterical ex
citement. Temporarily the republic is
generally supported throughout the
country, but history shows that simi
lar hysteria has frequently led to vio
lence and chaos. When Trance is able
to analyze the situation and should the
suspicious prove that th-- honor of the
army is really affected, the conse
quences to the republic might bo of the
most seri >us description. The Panama
scandals have litical life and
the law courts have been discredited;
therefore, if respect for the army must
also be - red, the desire to
Chang* ti, ;nent may be lrre
ble, in which case the temptation
for the leaders to divert the attention
of the country to a foreign war will be
well nigh Irresistible. Hence, the deep
E ranÂ© 'a neighbors.
For the moment the intense excite
ment will probably find an outlet in the
renewal of the presented dur

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN, Jan. 25.â Owing to the slow
recovery of the Empress, whose physi

programme of the season's court fes
tivities has not been drawn up. The
great court, usually held in the middle
of January, In the hall of the Knights,
in the castle, has been abandoned. It is
hoped the Empress will be strong
enough to attend the fete upon the oc
casion of the Emperor's birthday, Jan

balls and receptions will follow, finish

Saxon princes, the King of Wurtem

Duchess of Hesse, the hereditary
Prince and Princess of Baden will be
among the guests at the Emperor's
birthday fete.
Austria and Germany have intimated
their willingness to attend the proposed
conference at Brussels to discuss the
abolition of sugar bounties. France is
also showing an inclination to join, so
an early meeting is probable.
The export of sugar to the United
States has suffered enormously through
the Dingley tariff. In fact, it has al
most stopped. During the last quar
ter of 1597 only $27,000 worth of sugar
was. shipped from Hamburg, the prin
cipal sugar port of Germany.
The first social function attended by
Prince Hohenlohe. the Imperial Chan
cellor, since the death of his wife, was
the reception of United States Embas
sador Andrew D. White on Tuesday.
The Prince was among the first arriv
als, and remained in conversation with
his host and hostess for half an hour,
although his physicians advised him
not to go; but the Chancellor said he
felt it to be his duty to go. The fact
has excited general comment in diplo
matic and official circles. ':_ (

ZOLA'S TURN COMES NEXT
Famous Letter of the Novelist FÂ«nÂ»Â»
the Flames of the Celebraed *
Army Scandal.
Copyright. IS?S, by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, Jan. 15.â Naturally enough, M.
Zola's letter and the Esterhazy case
that made him write it form the roast
beef o-f the papers just now. The
sweeping nature of Zola's accusations
has, if anything, caused them to be re
ceived with rather less belief than they
might have been expected to command.
In the army of a country where every
man has been, is, or will be a soldier
there must necessarily be some black
sheep, but from that to the wholesale
discrediting of officers who have form
ed two co-urt-martials is a long step.
At the same time much satisfaction
has been expressed that with Zola's
prosecution the affair must be dragged
into full daylight. This, however, is by
no means certain. The code specially
permits the trial in camera of cases
that may be prejudicial to public mor
als or safety. The question is, will the
trial of Zola for writing his now fa
mous letter and of Clemenceau's new
journal, Aurore, for publishing it, come
under the head of such cases?- I have
talked with individuals in very varying
â â¢s of life about this point, and the
consensus of opinion is that, although
the Government would probably prefer
to judge cases in camera, it will not
dare to- do it.
Public opinion which in a large meas
ure is uneasily concerned with the pos
sibility of justice having miscarried in
the Dreyfus matter, would be danger
ously excited should the popular nov
elist be tried behind closed doors for
what is after v.l only a bieach of the
press law. F.ven the conservative and
semi-official Temps admits that what is
troubling and scandalizing the public^
is the methoa uf investigation revealed byÂ»
recent cases. The people, it says, recol-r
U'ct under what strange conditions the
domiciliary visit was made to the
apartment of Colonel Picquart; they
have seen Major Eaterhazy accuse this
same Colonel Plcquart with having
broken into the house like a burglar.
These things have been said and relat
ed as quite simple and natural, as
though such things were still done by
other hands and with the same liber
ty. That is what ought to- appear enor
mous to the public conscience, and
which, in fact, will appear as such
upon the day when, meditating after
the emotion of a moment, it takes ac
count of the methods employed in cer
tain administration â methods which
are immediately covered by the sacred
mantle of national defenses.
The Figaro, which has adopted a
more conservative attitude of late, this
morning: devotes its leading- article to
what it calls, in semi-humorous vein,
"the new inquisition." This has been
re-established, it says gayly, in a
modified form, though the decree will
not appear in the official gazette, as
the Government wishes to wasi: its
hands of it. Nevertheless, it goes on.
the inquisition, banished by law, has
taken refuge in our customsand to spy
on one another is one of the first arti
cles in the French catheclist. Even in
th^ smallest hamlet of Prance, says the
writer, A. Claveau, there is mutual sur
veillance, which is one of the most del
icate forms of modern solidarity. Tl.Â»w
ever. the new inquisition has this su
periority over the old one. It d*>es not
burn its victims: it dishonors them.
The now regulation of the United
States for the importation of sealskin
garments bids fair to- utterly ruin that
Industry both upon this side of the At
lantic as well as in America, here be
cause a larger part of the trade is done
with American customers, and In Amer
ica, because Paris imposes its styie^
and fashions 1n this as in most othe^
departments of dress upon the whole
w-irld. It is consequently claimed here
that when Americans can no longer
have sealskin garments made in Paris
they will then do without them alto
gether, and will turn their patronage
toward other kinds of furs.A DAY ON THE WATER FRONT.

Far backâ l believe the water front re

come over on the Beigic and have b. en
detained because of Uncle Sam's insistent
fussiness about certificates. If their cases
ere not decided by Saturday they will be
transferred to some other vessel.
"And who pays for their board in the

v.iis surrounded by a chattering crowd of
â !als.
"The Chinese themselves," he an
sw'-red. "More than that, they put up a
horid to pay their passage back should
they be refused admittance to this glo
rious land of ours."
Think of what it mÂ«>ans to a Chinese
laborer to earn enough money to pay
his passage both ways from China here
and back; of what the contingent fund
must be to pay his expenses should he be
detained. Think of the voyage in the

they nlttiÃ hammocks and cook and eat.

The Alameda sailed In serene and
splendid. Her entrance -was like a stage
entrance that has been fittingly led up to.
For just nn hour In the history of Ban
Frnncisco's shipping she was to be lead- i

and pennant flying, gray-bearded cap- !
tain and pilot aloft, passengers on deck
and an Interested crowd on shore.
And just at the critical moment a
â tupld :'at-br>ttnmed scow swung
her broad nÂ«se np.iinst the ocean steam
er's side, and the glory of that striking
entrance was forever marred. The Ala
meda had to stop and wait while the
fussy little tup. the Governor M.irkham,
blushing cardinal red with vexation,
and stage fright threw a mpe to the
scow and tugged and pulled and towed
her out of the way. Then the Alameda
really docked.

PERPLEXITY OVER
THE CITY'S DEAD
The Closing of the Cemetery
Brings About Its Dis
advantages.
The Chinese Will Purchase a Tract
of Land In San Mateo County for
a Temporary Resting-Placo.
Notwithstanding the loner notice given
by the Supervisors that the City Cexne
would be closed for all interments
on and after the tirst of the present rear,
nothing has been dona by those societies
and the undertakers having the responsi
bility of providing a final resting place
for the indigent dead. The same condi
tion of affairs has existed with the Chi
nese. They, as well as the other?, per
mitted tiSM to slip by without making
any provisions for the future, until th<>y
found themselves in the rapacity of beg
gars, so to speak, asking f.>r an exten
sion of time, which the Supervisors gra
ciously granted them.
The time now being extended to the
first of April, steps will be taken by the
Chinese to procure a tract of fifteen acre*
in San Mateo County for a temporary
resting place for their dead.
Within a few days a meeting of the
six Chinese companies will be held and
a lawyer will be deputed to proceed to
San Mateo and make the necessary ar
rangements with the County Board of
Supervisors for the privilege of locating
a cemetery in that county. This step has
been decided on by the Chinese who are
fully cognizant of the popular prejudice
evinced against them as a race. Of this
prejudice they have had experience in the
]>;ist. as the superintendent of the City
Cemetery, while admitting all other
corpses to a grave in the city's burying
ground at $1. has charged the Chinese
?L> El, and the undertaker who has the
contract for the burying of the city's in
digent dead had a wholesale contract at
$3u a month, irrespective of the number
of interments. A similar figure has been
charged the Chinese for exhuming the
bodies of their dead. This the Mongolians
characterize as discrimination against
their race even unto death, and resur
rection. To avoid this it is proposed to
own a cemetery of theft" own where they '
â will not- be subject to this discrimination
ami extra charge. v:
The number of deaths and exhumations
average fifty every month of the Chinese,
which, to -the superlntendpnt, la quite an i
Item, together with his other perquisites,
all of which will be lost to the favored
politician who pot this job as a reward ;
for services rendered to the political boss.
The condition of the Western Addition
Undertakers who fipured ho low on the â 
contract as to bury all the indigent dead
at M each Is rot so favorablo from a
financial point of view, as no conditions
were made with the city about a place |
for the Interments: this was their lookout ]
when they made their bid. They pave a
bond of $COOO for the faithful performance
of their contract and they must live up '
to it. It is their duty to rind a place for :
the city's dead irrespective of price.
The other societies having the privilege
of the City Cemetery will be likewise
compelled to find interment ground on
and after the first of next April, as the !
Supervisors are determined to grant no
further extensions.
THE RUSH HAS BEGUN.
No Spare Birtbs or) steamers
Bound for the Yukon.
The move of Alaska prospectors to the
north has already set In. Not only do the
merchants of the city report that they
are feeling substantial benefits from the
purchase of outfits and supplies for the
Alaska trip, but the transportation corn
ponies are already forced to admit that
carrying capacity of freight and
passengers i- c being taxed to the utmost,
t the problem That confronts them
next summer becomes more and more
IS. The "Walla Walla will sail this
morning, with every berth taken, and
nearly all of her passengers are bound
for Dyea and Skaguay. At least one
half of this number have been frequent
visitors at the Alaska Trade Bureau and
have made a close study of the facts and
Object lessons which were presented to
them at the ferry building. It Is report
it the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company has enpntred a large part of its
accommrvd.itions fur some time ahead
and iÂ« daily receiving requests by tele
graph to hold berths. The Pacific Steam
ng Company's vessel Excelsior will
sail on Monday for Dyea, Skaguay and
Orca, Tt Is reported that she had offers
for more freight and passengers than
her capacity allowed.
Inquiries by mall were more numerous
yesterday than on any other day. As
an indication of the amount of mail
which the Alaska Trade Committee Is
sending: out every day it is Interesting- to
note that its bill for postago stamps
alone averages Jfi a day. "Word was re
ceived from a man who has been travel
ing through Arizona for the last few
weeks who says that parties of miners
are being organized in nearly every camp
In the Territory, and for the most part
prospective Klondikers will leave early
for thÂ« north, so as to take advantage of
the trail over the ice which has been
broken by the miners who are cominsr
out to the coast. Other requests by mail
ar.d personal applications for specit'.c in
formation and general literature is re
ceived dally from almost every Ptate In
the Union, and shows n steady increase
from week to week. The record of the
bureau shows that the inquiries from
outside the city are assuming a relative
ly greater Importance as contrasted with
the local demand.
Civil Service Examination.
On January 29 a civil service examina
tion for the position of stenographer In

A GREAT RUN
Defeated Colonel Wheeler
for the McLaughlin
Selling Stake.
Clayton's Stirrups Broke and
Caspar Easily Downed
Rubicon.
Gray's Poor Ride Astride Buck Masste
Gavo the Owners' Handicap
to May W.
The inclemency of the weather did
not keep people away from the races
yesterday. The card was a gilt-edged
one. and almost as many turf patrons
Journeyed over the bay to Oakland
track as have been seen there under |
more propitious circumstances. An
owners' handicap and two stake events j
were the special attractions. Dr. Row
ell's more than useful chestnut horse.
Satsuma, took the McLaughlin selling
stake in very fast time, and Caspar, the j
fast son of St. Andrew, defeated Kubi- ;
con for the Reliance Club Handicap.;
A broken stirrup possibly contributed I
to the latter's downfall. The owners' j
handicap wont to the fast Montana
mare. May W, with the Eastern crack, j
Buck Massie. at her heels. Three fa- !
vorites reached the wire in front.
Of the six starters for the McLaugh
lin selling stake, at one mile and a six
teenth, Colonel Wheeler, with 104
pounds, and Thorpe in the saddle, was
considered the most eligible, and was
a consistent 3-to-2 choice throughout j
the betting. Just before post time
there was a stiff play on Satsuma,
against which throes were obtainable.
Garland Barr. King William. Tom
Cromwell and Buckwa were considered
outclassed in the going. Oarland Barr j
undoubtedly worked the defeat of the
favorite. Chasing out in front with
him he had the Colonel a trit'.e groggy
something over a furlong from the
wire. Jones then made his ride with
Satsuma, and Conley. astride Garland
Barr, very condescendingly let him r-x
tricate himself from the pocket he was'
in. and. although Thorpe made a dcs- j
perate effort to hold the lead, was beat
en somewhat handily by a npck. in the j
f.ipt time of 1:48%. The value of the:
stake to th>- winner was 1950.
It was a very slim fiVM that went to :
the post in the Reliance Club Handi- i
cap. over seven furlongs, worth $700 to
the first horse. Rubicon was asked to j
pick up 1-4 pounds, and everybody was ,
congratulating Tommy Griffin on hit- j
ting up with such soft company. The
big chestnut horse, with Lonny Clay
ton in the saddle, was backed down 6 to !
R to 4 to r>. Caspar and Colonel Dan,
the Burrs <ft Waterhouse pair, receded !
in the hettinpr from 3 to 5 to evens. It
was a two-horse race to the head of the
stretch, Caspar and Rubicon running;
head and head. Turning the her.d for j
home, Rubicon made a very wide turn, j
loÃir.s: several lentrths, and, hugging the
rail, Caspar won as he pleased. Col. |
Dan even came along, beating the fa
vorite for the place.
The cause of the first choice's miser
able ending was quickly made appar- !
ent. At the h<=>ad of the stretch nnc of
Clayton's stirrups hroke. and as h<> was
pulling up the other one served him
likewise.
J. X. Murphy's Buck Massie opened
an 8 to 5 favorite for the owners' hand
icap with his 88 pounds up. but the
supply was more than adequate to the
demand and 11 to 5 was procurable
later on. ThÂ« big play was madÂ» on
May W, forcing her odds down from
threes to 9 to n. The Montana mare
took a commanding load at the first
turn and though Buck was coming fast
at the end, ho was beaten a scant
length. Double Quick ran wÂ«=ll to the
etreteh, where he tired badly.
The 2 to 1 favorite, Colonial Dame. In i
the opening five and a half furlong ;
scramble was pounds the best of the
eleven starters, and though O'Connor
could not assist her much, she came on i
In the stretch and led out El Morn and |
Elldad at the wire. The former made '
most of the running and appears to |
fancy the heavy going. La Maroma '

artery to Richmond, and will soon have
an electric railroad. The property be

the heights lately occupied as> a vegeta
ble garden is being graded, streets laid
out. "macadamized, etc. This is one of
the most beautiful building sites in th-Â»
district. Preparation* for building a |
block of residences on Sixth avenue, be- I
tween California and Lake streets, are,
completed, and work begun. On Second, i
Third and all avenues parallel new '
houses are to be built immediately, as !
the contracts have been let. As the dts
trict Is well lighted good fire and police |
protection has been furnished. Its fu- j
ture is assured, and the coming boom in j
property is already being felt. The open- j
in? up "of California street and its fine!
grrade and location will make it the great
business street of Richmond.
The following resolutions were passed: '
Whereas. The Board of Supervisors of this
city and county did. on June S. ISS7. by reso
lution declare that as the City Cemetery
burials were dangerous to life and detrimental
to the public health, that the same be pro
hibited, and notice was given through the pub
lic press, and that from and after Jan. 1. IS9R.
all burials in that cemetery should cease; and.
Whereas. Ample time for procuring new sites
has been given to the Chinese and others,
who now ask for a continuance In the matter
of rinsing: the same, that they may still lonirer
on public property 'â¢ontlnue their bone-scraping
and dlsease-spreadlner rites to the detriment
of improvements and Imperiling the health of
our citizens; be it
Resolved, That we petition the Honorable
the Board of Supervisors to refuse any con
tinuance, as under the law they have the
power, and ask them to assist us in this matter
and discontinue the buryine In said cemetery
and abate this nuisance. "That the pretense
of the Chinese and others ar<Â» frivolous," and
done merely to further use thfs city property
for gain, and to the menace of our citizens.
A TEST CASE.
Can a Chlrjese Merchant Turn La

Country?
Kg Pak Tan fame to this port from
China a short time ago on a "merchant's
certificate" and wns allowed to land. He
has been gathered in again and â will run
the risk of being deported, for he has been
found by Federal officers performing
manual labor as a fisherman at a Chi
nese fishinp camp on the bay shore be
tween MHlbrae and Burlingame. Thmc
other Chinese were found without regis
tration certificates, but they said that the
papers were in their rooms in this city.
They were detained ponding an investi
gation.
There Is a question whether a Chinese
merchant admitted to this country aa
such, who afterward becomes a laborer,
is er.titlr-d to remain here, and It is tho
intention of the Federal officials to test
the matter in the courts.

HIGH SCHOOL
EDUCATION
Professor Brown Speaks
of Its History and
Problems.
The First of a Series of Studies
in Secondary Educa
tion.
Will Be the Field of a Great Ed
ucational Reorgani
zation.
BERKELEY, Jan. 15.â Professor El
mer E. Brown of the department of
pedagogy of the State University be
gan to-day a series of "Studies in Sec
ondary Education," which will be given
on Saturday mornings during the com
ing term. Two regular recitation pe
riods, from 10:20 to 11:15, and from 11:15
to 12:10 will be devoted to the course.
Professor Brown proposes to devote the i
first hour to the history of secondary j
education and the closing hour to the '
study of practical problems. In his
opening remarks this morning Profes- j
Bor Brown Baid:
B ndary education occupies a some
what critical position in education in:
â  il. The difficulties that are se.-:i
in California are difficulties which have \
appeared before and elsewhere, but we
have in California ;i comparatively
â  educational systemâ a respon
body of teachers and a public
which la perfectly willing to give edu
nal experiments a fair trial.
re are narrow views on secondary
education and there are broad viewsâ
there are narrow views which nrn
broad and there are broad views which
are superficial, a reorganisation is
coming in secondary education, and in
this reorganisation the university must
take a prominent part.
When we have in California a truly
ted form of secondary education
we will have, l think, a perfected form
ication In general, bo closely does
education come in contact
with primary education "ii thÂ»- one hand
and university education <>n the other.
A study of the Bubjeci of secondary
ition should Include, broadly, two
tsâ a history iry educa
tion in America and a Study of hi^h
school curricula ami discussion of
the more important questions sup.
od. As a basis of study of the latter
subject the famous "Report of the Com
mittee of Ten." mad- in 1893, will be
â¢â ' ith sonn- carÂ»'.
hist< ry of secondary education
divides naturally Into three j.. riods:
The "grammar sch ;. h.-gin
ning with the early days of colonisation
and earning down to the R I nary
War; the academy period, lasting from
the tlmÂ«' of the Revolution down to
about 1840; in this period come the plo
reformers, Horace
. Edward Barnard and t li â¢ - i r eon
id lastly the high school
1, which extends from !M-i down
â¢ â  lent Tim.-. The names applted
â ed upon the
iary schools which
then flourished- the old "grammar
the academy and the pr-
high schools.
Th- - I the Atlantic seaboard
alone witnessed the rise and develop
"f tt..- "grammar" school; th.>
my flourished in that part of
the United Bts of the Missis
sippi >R1 vex; w.-st of the Mississippi the
hlph school h;is i.. . n the prevailing
type. The "grammar school" is now
forever gone. The academy, while no
ir the prevailing type, holds s
and will hoid a permanent p
in education: th.- high school, however,
a( present occupies by far the most Im
portant pla
"grammar schools" of England
mate successors of the
la of the monasteries and
drals. The grammar schools ..f
the Tudor period had the medieval
.Mic characteristics plus the im
: t Influence of the te
st. Paul's School in London, Â« stab
lished by Collet, is of especial Interest
type of th- early English "gram
mar" school. "Charge the malsters
that they teach always that is best,"
< oiiot's instruction In regard to
the curriculum of the school, and if in
the srand plan for the new University
Hfornia provision Is mad- f.,r the
â¢-tment of pedagogy, T would have
words of Collet graven above the
entrance.
Passing to a consideration of modern
questions of secondary education. Pro
fessor Brown dwelt ui>r.:i the various
views taken of the Â«ulijeot of educa
tion. "The modern educational or ped
apoeical view," he said, "is comins to
he. In addition to a psychological view,
a social view as weU. It adapts edu
cation not to the mere requirements of
the various branches of study, but to
the needs of the student of many and
various subjects."

THRE MOON DOES IT.
The Chinese New Year a Day
Fixed by an Unerring
Time Keeper.
According to the Chinese calendar,
which is regulated by the moon, there
is no such thing as a difference of opin
ion by the Mongolians regarding the
date of the first of the year, save and
except what is now thrown in by the
newly appointed Consul who has taken
it upon himself to change the date. At
this interference with time and tide the
wis- ones in Chinatown simply laugh.
They point to the fact that the new
moon, which governs their months,
comes on the 21st of this month, and
nothing that the Consul or any other
man may say or do can change that
event. Consequently the New Year
will be celebrated on that day. By
the Chinese way of computing time
they have, as we have, sixty-two moons
every five years. This gives them an
extra month every three years and a
little over which they divide to suit
their new years, always making it a
point to have the year commence on
the birth of the moon. This year the
birth of the twelfth moon is down on
the calendar for the 21st, and that set
tles It. Next year, however, will be
a long one with them and their n> -w
year will run into the middle of Feb
ruary.
The Chinese months vary from
twenty-nine to thirty days, hut never
more or less.
They laugh at the Consul's way of
reckoning dates, and Pimply say that
If he be correct th<- Chinese New Year
In China commences by right on the
2fHh. Inasmuch as the Eastern time is
ahead of the San Francisco time by at
least one day. Consequently Friday.
the 21st, will see Chinatown painted
red, unless the Chief of Police wills it
otherwise.

SPECIAL SESSION HELD.
Future of the University Discussed.
Governor Budd and Judge
Waymire Attend.
Repents In special session at the
Mark Hopkins Institute yesterday dis
cussed the future of the university, di
gressing from the main subject at In
tervals to discuss David Starr Jordan,
president of Stanford University. The
Governor was present and enlivened
the session with a few original re
marks. Judge "Waymire was on hand,
but as he did not get there in time to
answer to the roll call his activity
cnuld not be ciassfd as pernicious.
Major Harney, Harbor Commissioner,
Professor Moses and Attorney Mhoon
were interested listeners. The regents
attending were: Phelps (presiding),
Rodgers, Hallidi^, Martin, Denicke,
"Wallace, Mrs. Hearst, Slack, President
Kellogg, John E. Budd, Governor
Budd, Reinstein, Marye, Chase, Foote
and Waymire.
Regent Arthur Rodgers presented a
report from the committee appointed
to consider a resolution providing for
the establishment of a college of com
merce in the university. The report Is
signed by Messis. Rodgers, Hallidie
and Marye. It is an elaborate paper,
reviewing the success of commercial
colleges in Europe and setting forth
the great gains achieved by commer
cial instruction in Germany. Concern-
Ing colleges of this character the re
port says:
There are probably sixty commercial
high schools In the German empire, ten
in France and JBtlgium and fifteen in the
Austrian empire and Italy- Some of tntst
were founded over a hundred years age
Lut most of them since our university
opened.
The/ have grown according to the en
lightened commercial spirit of their re
spective communities. It is said that not
one of over a thousand graduates of these
schools in Franco has abandoned his
chosen career and that about 18 per cent
of these graduates are devotiner them
selves to foreign commerce. The growth
of German internal commerce, and
especially of German foreign commerce,
during the last decade or two has been
unparalleled, probably, in the history of
commerce. During that time her ad
vanced commercial schools have been the
most numerous and have taught more
pupils than those of the rest of the world.
They have learned every language, and
have gone forth as successful mission
aries of German trade into all countries.
The success oi the advanced commercial
education in Germany has excited alarm
in Great Britain, and various methods of
ring like training have been under
outUned very recently. Japan
has established a successful school alter
the general plan of the European schools
mentioned. In the United States there
are a ff-w similar schools of recent estab
lishment. About fifteen years ago the
Wharton School of Finance and Economy
was established in the University of
Pennsylvania. The president of the Uni
versity of Chicago has recently announced
a prospective department in that institu
tion, with aims and methods similar to
those of the "Wharton School, to be cai.ed
a College of Commerce and Politics.
To Bum up the experience of other com
THERE is many a good story told
of poor Charley Reed, flan Fran
clpcos "plain comedian," who
from the time he commenced to
Play minor parts at the old Bella
onion until the day of his death,
when his name had become fa
mous throughout the length and
breadth of the United States, hold the
affection of tho people of thlÃ city a no
other actor, man or woman, over pos
sessed it.
Millie Collier, who is now playing nt
one of the local theaters, wns Reed's
side - partner in the old days, and
tney constituted a pair that were
hard to beat, whether you found
t..em on the stage or off. Reed wns
always filled with the ambition to Rhine
in some occupation other than that of
acting, and the one dream of his life
was to become a barkeeper and to be
known as a mixer of drinks who had no
equal. He often spoke to his chum Col
lier of the happiness the realization of
this dream would bring to him. and when
he coud get Willie into some quiet cor
ner he would hold forth for hours
on his peculiar ability to distinguish
himself as a dispenser of the fragrant
iulep and the seductive cocktail. So one
Fourth of July night, after the show at
which they were then playing at the
California Theater had concluded, the
pair of them floated into a saloon on
Koarny street, and Reed, addressing the
proprietor of the place, said: "Levy, Col
lier and myself have been discussing
your place and have come to the <â¢â¢ in
clusion that if we threw all the poor
drinks you have piven us into th<
there wouldn't be shrimp sober enough
In the city to go into a respectable salad.
Now, suppose you and your brother get
out from behind the bar and let <
and myself get In and show you how to
run things. We have some pretty loud
cats on, so all we need in order to make
our appearance all risht is a couple of
aprons and your diamond studs."
Levy and his brother accordingly got
out. while Collier and Reed installed
themselves between the mahogany and
the glass and waited for customers to
come in.
The first to appear was an old gentle
man, who came in and. Laying down a
dollar on the bar, asked Collier to plve
him some green chartreuse. "Th
not in my department," .said Collier; "my
boy here." pointing to Re^d. "will at
tend to you." The customer accordingly
moved to the other end of the bar and re
peated his request to Charley.
"Green chartreuse?" said Charley.
"This is the Fourth of Julyâ not St.
Patrick's day. What you want is fire
water." The stranger mildly protested,
but on being told that he would either
munlties: Advanced commercial training
corresponding to our college work has
been developed independently of univers
ity work. It has developed upon the de
mands of practical men. It has made
successful business men and has kept
them at their career.
An outline of the course of study,
embracing- forty-eight subjects, is con
tained in the report of 'the committee.
It is recommended that one professor of
commerce should be chosen. It is
further reoommei.ded: "And the great
est care should be exercised to secure
a vigorous, practical, tactful and dis
tinguished professor, whose success in
similar work elsewhere would assure
the most favorable organization and
beginning of the new college."
The prospective advantages of the
proposed college are set forth in these
terms:
Aside from this duty and the general
policy which require the organisation of
a college of commerce our situation and
our development urgently demand it.
Hitherto California has been la
by mountain, desert and sea- and with a
climate and valuable resourcesâ from the
rest of the world, and specially from
the great markets of the Atlantic; and
our people have been engrossed with ox
plotting and experimenting upon the re
sources of this new ami strange terri
tory. We have reached that point in
knowledge and improved methods where
our production Is far beyond the con
sumption of our own people, and capable
of vast expansion even under present
conditions. Speaking broadly we have
the population of Paris with the avail
able natural resources of France.
Wo must reach the markets of the
world with the least cost and lessen the
expenses of Internal trade.
Hitherto our chief markets have b^en
in the West, the Atlantic States ami
Europe, and we have been virtually ob
livious to the Pacific Ocean, which in
vites us to the greatest commercial con
quest of all time. The events occurring
In the Northwestern and Norhtea<u<rn
Pacific portend marvelous commercial
expansion. In the prospective struggle
for this commerce we of this coast and
country have opportunities through geo
graphy and resource more favorable than
any other people of our civilization.
In this connection we doem it proper to
quote from the letter of Regent Edward
Tompkins in 1*72. donating property to
this board to support the Agasslz pro
fessorship of Oriental languages and lit
erature: "The business between Califor
nia and Asia is already very great. Its
future is beyond any estimate that thr>
most sanguine would daro to makf>. The
child is now born that will see the com
merce of the Pacific greater than that
of the Atlantic."
It is therefore of the utmost conse
quence for California, that the means
shall be provided to instruct our young
men preparing for lives of business ar
tivity in the. languages and literature of
Hasten) Asia.
In conclusion, the committee recom
mends:
First â The adoption of the reso
lution that a college of commerce
be established in the University
of California.
Second â That fhs president of
the university be authorized to
recommend to the board a nomi
nee as professor in this college
with such titles as may hereafter
be adopted.
The report was ordered printed.
Regent Reinstein read a carefully
prepared and able address in which he
reviewed the university of the past
and sketched a future for the institu
tion, full of honorable achievement. At
tention wan called to some remarks re
cently made by David Starr Jordan,
; president of Stanford University. In
this style Mr. Reinstein commented on
the language ascribed to Dr. Jordan:
"And, here, too, where sit other cx
i offjcio regents, whose duties are con
nected with the spread of knowledge
through the State, should be resented
and answered such false and slander
! ous charges against the State as those
! recently made by President David Starr
j Jordan. Speaking of California, he
I publicly proclaimed that 'no other
! State on receiving a gift proceeds at
j once to tax it out of existence' â mean
i Ing thereby that California does â an
I absolute untruth â and the more repre
1 hensible in the hint that the State was
not only an ingrate, but stabbed its
| donors in the back.
" "Other civilized States,' Dr. Jordan
i said, 'meet the generous giver half way
i and double his gifts. California plun
j ders his donation as soon as his back
!is turned.' These charges are the less
' Justifiable from one in his position,
1 from one whose few years in this State
j have brought him more notoriety and
' profit than he had obtained before in
all the years of his life, and who has
not sojourned sufficiently in this State
to appreciate the character of her
people.
" 'No man,' said Burke, 'can frame an
indictment against a people;' and it is
high time that at least so prominent
a citizen should cease to charge that
all of the people of the State plunder,
where he would not dream of saying
TITE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SFXDAY, JAXUAEY IG, 189 S.
get that or a bounce he decided to accept
the straight drink which Reed had set
before him. He waited some time for hlÂ«
change and then paid to Reed: "I think
you must have made a mistake. I laid
down a dollar here and feu have given
me nothing back."
"It would have been a mistake If T had
given you anything back," paid Reed.
"What do you take this place forâ a
bank? Get out nf here!" The Btranger
daggered hack and then turning quickly
fled into the night.
Then a man came In who wanted pom*
Iron bitters, and was told he had better
go to Dunham, Carrlgan Co., where ho
would find hardware of all kinds.
A Mexican, who demanded a cocktail
of Collier, was provided with a glass of
Fte.am beer, and upon protesting wan In
formed that he waÂ« color blind and did
not know what he was drinking, and the
Oermun who wanted a pousso cafe was
directed to a barber sign in the alley
around the corner.
By this time the tip had gone quietly
along the street that there was some
thing doing in the Mirror, and customers
began to flock in by the score. They de
manded everything, from Ice water to
champagne and from pony brandy to a
demi tasse, but they never found the
gentlemen behind the bar at a loss. Reed
attended to the straight drinks and re
ferred all those who called for some
thing in the mixed line to his partner,
With the remark that he was a poor,
plain young man, trying to get on in the
world and that he did not want to be
come acquainted with all the Intricacies
of sin at so early an age, but that Col
lier was lost to all hope and could mix
anything from mortar to his lines.
Col Her, with an afTable smile, would at
tend to all those who were thus passed
Op tn him. and the price of a drink was
whatever the man laid on the counter.
The run of business continued way into
the sma' wee hours of the morning, when
the two actors, becoming tired (if their
fun, took off their aprons and went home.
A couple of days afterward Levy,
meeting Collier on the street, said. "Wil
lie, what did you do with those people
that came into my place the other night?
I have had two fights, and it has cost
me $20 worth of drinks to square myself
with the number of people who have
come in looking for trouble since you and
Reed tei Sed liar."
"Oh, nothing." said Collier. "You see,
when I went in there that night I had a
large package of assafetida in my
porket that I was taking home to doc
tor my dog with, and fearing that your
customers might think that they were
not getting the worth of their money I
Just threw a little of it Into each drink
that I mixed."
under similar circumstances that one
of them steals. And such a criticism
is made by such a man of such a
State. California needs no defense;
but for the benefit of those who, like
President Jordan, are not 'native and to
the manner born' let us say that oft
told as is the story of her greatness it
cannot be too often reiterated."
Judge Wallace admired the noble
sentiments and lofty eloquence of Re
gent Reinstein's paper, but he feared
that its force would be weakened by
retaining the allusion to President Jor
dan. He hoped that all reference to
President Jordan would be excluded be
fore the document was printed.
Arthur Kodgers maintained the samo
opinion. He remarked: "I regret
that any citizen of the Rtat^ should
be referred to as President Jordan was
in this paper."
Regent Foote regretted that so dis
tinguished an address should go out
nith this one blemish. H*> trusted that
Mr. Reinstein would eliminate the per
sonalitiesâthesp flings at a distinguish
ed gentleman at the head of a rival in
stitution.
Oovernor Budd. who had b<*en a quiet
listener until this stage of the proceed
ings. Joined in the discussion. He re
marked:
"I did not hear the particular lan
guage in Mr. Reinstein's address to
which reference is made, but if it is
true it should not be excluded from the
printed document. If it is true it
should stand and not be excluded be
cause it applies to the president of the
Stanford University. It strikes me
that regents are becoming exquisitely
sensitive all at once. I am president
of this Board of Regents and Governor
of this State, yet a communication was
sent to a professor in th<Â» university
and read here by the president of that
institution, in which my conduct as
chief executive was criticized because I
vetoed a forestry appropriation. I saw
no regent rise to reprimand the presi
dent of the nniversity for reflecting on
the Governor of the State and the pre
sident of the board. 1 think the Gov
ernor of California Is entitled to as
much respect as the -resident of Stan
ford University. Criticism made by
strangers on the constitution, laws and
people of the Slate may be properly re
sented."
Regent Foote mentioned that tho at
tack which Professor Hayne made on
the Governor at a recent session of the
board was Immediately resented by the
regents.
The Governor replied: "I do not re
fer to Professor Hayne. He apolo
gized in manly fashion. I refer to a
communication addressed to Professor
Hilgard which was sent here and read.
Now as regards President Jordan, I
have a very high opinion of his ability.
In my judgment ho is a great educator
who has done much for this State, and
by reflex action a great deal for our
State university."
The silence which followed thÂ«Â» last
suggestion was prolonged and oppres
sive. "When it was broken the board
decided to recommend that Mr. Rein
stein revise his address. Then it was
agreed that 5000 copies should be print
ed at the expense of the printing com
mittee, which consists of Governor
P.udd and Regents Rodgers and Den
icke. Regent Hallidie offered to chip
In his share of the expense, but the
committee did not accept his offer.
During the special session Rogont
Phelps, without leaving his post of
duty as presiding officer, got a. resolu
tion adopted which fixes th^ compen
sation of Professor Schaeberlo. acting
dlr.otor of Lick Observatory from Jan
uary 1 the same as that allowed to the
director.
At the suggestion of Judge Wallace
the board invited the Chief of the Fire
! Department to inspect the Mark Hop
kins Institute and report on the dan
gers of fire.
Steps were taken to Increase the
amount of insurance on the building.
Attorney Mhonn will inform the bnard
if insurance can be legally effect â¢<!.
Regent John K. TJudd is anxious that
some of the professors in the service
of the State should remain at Berk
eley during the vacation period in ordfÂ»r
to gratify rural school teachers who ;iro
craving higher education. He fancied
that some of the professors could stay
there during the summer months and
impart knowledge to the teachers. The
subject was referred to the Academic
Council.

The Matter Brought Up Before the

The question of the quality of gas fur

of the Board of Supervisors again yester-

President Crockett of the gas company
objected to certain statements made in
the public prints regarding the quality of
gas furnished by his concern, and said
that while London gas. as had been
stated, was made from coal. it was not
nearly no powerful as the gas furnished
to San Francisco, and that the ratepayers

minant.
It was decided to take the matter up
again next week, and in the meantime

THE SAy FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANITABY 16, 1898.
EVERY PROMISE
WAS FULFILLED
The New Era Edition of
The Call Failed in No
Particular.
I Affidavits Proving That Good
Faith Was Kept With
All.
â â â _ ___ __ /
There Was Nothing Yellow About
Either the Paper or Its
Circulation.
In these days when yellow fakers
flourish In the fields of Journalism and
contest with legitimate newspapers the
right to live there Is so much fraud
committed in the name of Journalistic
: enterprise that the public is often skep
tical and Incredulous of the honesty of
any newspaper that undertakes the ac
j complishment of an enterprise of more
I than ordinary, magnitude.
So many newspapers have at one
time or another announced the publi
cation of some enormous edition, and
SUPREME COURT
ON SHARP DEALS
A Very Pointed 'Decision Ren
dered in a Los Angeles
Land Case.
It Places a Well - Known Real
Estate Agent In a Bad
Box.
The Supreme Court has laid down a lit
the law which Is likely to have a good
effect upon a certain kind of land job
then defaulted either in the issue of the
stated number of copies, or else in the
circulation of them, that all such edi
tions are now watched with suspicion.
Even when the edition Is issued hy a
paper of such high repute for honesty
that no one doubts the fulfillment of
every promise made in the prospectus,
there is always some faker or enemy
in journalism ready to suggest the
doubt. It has therefore become neces
sary for even the most worthy and
honorable newspapers to give proof to
the public of the absolute performance
of every promise made in the issuing
of editions of that kind.
The Call rejoices that but few per
sons or papers have ever <-xpressed a
doubt that th^- New Era Edition of 3",0.

the charge of obtaining money by false

To the Indictment Bryant demurred,
and wus sustained by the Superior Court,
contending that the fraudulent represen

solely to the property, and did not come
under the statute, as the mortgage was
only a security for the payment of the

WILL CORBETT
CONQUER FITZ ?
What Will Happen if These
Fistic Exponents Meet
Again ?â 
Good Reason to Believe That Our
Jim Will Be Champion
Once More.
The lovers of fistic art are now bus
ily engaged in discussing the prospective
meeting of the two heavy fellows, for
that event would appear to be an as
sured fact judging from late develop
ments in that controversy. Although
Fitz is somewhat dilatory about entang
ling himself in another conflict with a
man whom ho has once defeated. still
he no doubt will finally succumb to the
matures of C'orbett if for no other rea
son than that he will soon "need the
money." and he can make more by this
match than any other. It is more than
probable that their war of words. In
which they are now forcibly indulging, is
but a preliminary to the more important
battle that is to come. Who knows but
this agitation between them is carried on
for the purpose of creating interest in the
affair and to assure its financial success?
Both men have their devoted admirers,
but it seems to be the consensus of opin
ion that our Jim will be the victor in
the return engagement and thus redeem
hi- lost prestige.
Professor Walter "Watson, who Is com
petent to talk on the subject, is ni^st
emphatic lp his expression of opin
ion that Corbett will win the next time
and advnnces the theory that this should
be the outcome because experience is the
best teacher, and the defeated gladiator
has thoroughly learned his sa<l lesson. In
his ('arson light with Fitzsimmons t 'orbett
was trained entirely too Ane on account
of too much hard work on the last two
days of his training. He is Inclined to
be somewhat vain of his physical accom
plishments, and the day before the great
struggle he aired them for the edification
of some Eastern friends connected with
the New York Athletic < - luh, and thus
over-exertM himself to nn alarming ex
tent. Again hfÂ» overdid his outdoor exÂ«Â»r
i isÂ»Â» and tn that way left his strength
on the road Instead of taking it In the
ring with him. In his fight with Sharkey
he made the grave mistake of not train
ing at all. and with Fitzslmmons he com
mitted the opposite â¢â rr'>r of training too
much. It wr\s a fatal proceeding in the
second case and came very near being so
In the first The consequence was that
his blows lacked steam and he was un
able to finish VUz in the sixth round,
as he wotiid have done had he used bet
ter judgment in his training prepara
tions.
Another reason for his defeat can be
ascribed to <'orhett not sizing: Kifz up
-My. He labored under the Impres
sion that the latter was a hard hitter
hut not particularly clever in the boxing
line, and he. therefore, was exceedingly
wnrv and cautious in the opening rounds.
He f"unÂ«i <>ut. however, very shortly, thai
he should have pin ss.'.l again and lust
the other way. for he discovered that his
antagonist developed extranrdli ary fistic
ability as the rounds proceeded but his
bl iwi were not very powerful ones, and
all but the one that did the business were
Ineffective, as Corbett's appearance after
the contest Indicated.
Th- â â¢ seems to he abundant reason for
bellevine now that Corbett Is aware of his
rival's deficiencies that he will, with the
wisdom born of experience, take advant
age of the bitter lesson he has learned.
and It Is plausible to suppose that he wfil

A YOUNG WOMAN'S RIGHTS
An Interesting Supreme Court De-
cision in the Dittrich-
Gobey Case.
Mrs. Mary E. Dlttrich was formerly the
wife of Frank Gobey. he of Welsh rare
bit and cocktail fame on Sutter street.
In 1880 the couple were divorced and the
custody of their minor child, Camille,
was vested in the maternal parent. In
1893 the divorced parties entered into a
contract, under which Gobey was to
have charge of the child's education and
bear all of the expenses of traveling,
clothing, etc., until she should have,
reached her eighteenth year. At the ex
piration of that time Gobey agreed to
restore Camille to her mother, free of
expense, and for any failure to do so
should be, under the contract, liable for
$1000 as liquidated damages.
The child became IS years of age in
September. 1532. Her father offered to
aliow her to return to her mother, but
the young lady had a mind of her own
and expressly refused to go. The mother
mad" a formal demand, but Gobey
failed to comply and afterward died.
The executor of the estate is Jess*
bey, and against him Mrs. Dittrich, the
mother, began an action to recover the
SlmiO as penalty for a breach of contract.
The executor won.
Justice Garoutte sustains the judg
ment of the lower court. He holds the
contract was that the father should af
ford the facilities for the daughter to re
turn to her mother at the time stated
and could not be construed as uncondi
tional, for to attempt to force the young
lady to return to her mother would be \o
infringe upon the former's rights, she
having attained her majority. There was
no reason to suppose that the contract
was alternativeâ to return the girl to her
mother at the time specified or pay $1000.

WHERE GO THE

Consideration of Scientific Phases of
a Question Which Appeals to
the Intellectual Stomach.
_
The chicken is not a particular sort of
bird as to its diet. It Will eat anything
of a size to find room in its elastic crop.
! This circumstance, however, gets a little
ahead of the story.
1 It is a recognized fact in science that
the same element enters into the composi
tion of many different organisms. For in
stance, that which is a portion of a cow
| one season might be recognized some oth
er season as a blade of grass, a flower, a
mushroom, a toad, or be traced to a posi
tion in some human body. On second
i thought, these commonplace reflections
! are ahead of the story, too.
To get down to stern realities, there
was a curiosity to know what became of
dead horses. In the natural course of
events more or less dead horses are cer
tain to accumulate, unless there be steps
taken to remove them. There was a time
when the deceased equine was incinerat
ed. He was reduced to ashes along with
the other evidences of civilization. Sud
denly he ceased to appear. Either tho
horse had quit dying, or a new use had
been found for him. â¢ It was learned that
the dogs out at the coursing track had
been induced to regard him as edible, and
that properly cooked he answered the
purpose of soup, entree, roast and des
sert. But the owners of the dogs did not
indorse this view, and one market for
dead horse became stagnant. Yet the
horse that had laid down the burden of
life failed to appear at the .old haunts.
The experts of the dumps were puzzled.
Among those whose love for investiga
tion led them to look into this matter was
a veterinary surgeon. Others might be
deluded, but he knew that horses occa
sionally rested from their labors. He as
certained a few things: When a horse has
ceased to be useful to the extent of giv
ing up the ghost, it is Idle to suppose that
he vanishes into thin air. He couldn't do
it. No; the custom is to ship n!m to Pet
1 aluma or some other point at which the
chicken Is the staff of life, and utilize him
as feed. Before shipment he la cut to
convenient size. After shipment he is cut
\ to bits, and by the subtile scheme of na
i ture converted into eggs and broilers.
The question arises, and here there shall
I be no attempt to answer it. whether an
egg composed of the constituent parts of
what was dead horse is worthy the public
confidence. Perhaps the spavined, swee
nied. wind-broken horse, the horse that
lies down In harness and expires, may
appear again in the form of eggs and bo
wholesome. Possibly the secret processes
of nature may enable the tender chicken
to burst from Its shell untainted of thÂ«
dead horse from which it sprang. Human
judgment is weak and the human stom
ach is subject to qualms. Yet when hu
| man Judgment declares that horse meat,
i the same havinÂ»r become horse meat by
, malady, is not fit to form the nucleus n'f
generations of chickens yet unborn, tho
human stomach Indorses The verdict, and
: seems to have some excuse for being pos
'â  itive about it.

Rev. Marshall Law, the Rector-Editor, Uses
Some Critical Vitriol.
OAKLAND, Jan. I",.â The question of whether girls should sing In Epis
copal churches has long been a debatable point among Episcopal clergynu-n.
Rev. Marshal I>aw. rector of the Church of the Advent. Issued to-day a crit
icism of the festival of the San Francisco and Oakland Vested Choir Asso
ciation, and incidentally he said much to stir up his brother rectors. Rev
Floyd J. Mynard, rector of St. Johns, where the festival was held, was asked
for an opinion regarding: the criticism published In Choir and Nave, and
readily gave it.
The ideas of the two rectors are subjoined:
Key. J-loyd J. Mynard says:
The excellent work of the five choirs of
vested -men and boys in the festival held
on "Wednesday evening last 1 has. received
most enthusiastic commendation from
many who composed the congregation of
"800" In the "little church" of.. St. John's.
Oakland. There are. in fact, no evidences
Of anything but complete satisfaction, **-
cept on the part of the Choir ami N
critic at large. But" even its strictures
may be -accounted for on the ground -of
"offensive partisanship."
Perhaps the excellent work, was more
distracting to the critic than was the
director's baton to the boys /whose- eyes
were so "glued to the scores'.' as to make
them "utterly oblivious" of the director's
presence. But quite as likely the Choir
and Nave failed to appreciate the fact
that the 200 men and boys were singing
as men arÂ«d boys, and not as men and
women. This fact Influenced the choice
of music and the rendering of it. The
"tuneful" jingle of lighter music' was
lacking from deliberate choice. For it
was substituted the less operatic but
more sober and worshipful music' es
pecially adapted to choirs composed of
men and boys. From that standpoint the
selections were most admirable, and "all
the singing was true to pitch and excel
lent in time where the time moved
straight ahead." which was continuously.
We are sorry that in future we must
qualify our hitherto high opinion of the
musical ability back of. the ' Choir and
Nave, since it advises remedying defects
in boy sopranos by adding women so
pranos. That any musician should at
tempt to combine two things so utterly
different is past understanding.
The management sympathized with the
Choir and Nave In its reverence ,for "the
Cross of Christâ the flag of heaven"â as
was shown by their care that not a sin
gle cross should have a ribbon upon It.
The colors of the different choirs were
tied to the standards upon which the
crosses were borne.

sample of a service rendered by men, and.

ana worehlpfulneas
all the efforts that have heretofore
been made to obtain clemency from
Governor Budd will be renewed, and
all the pressure possible will be bnmght
to bear to save the murderer's life.
Attorneys Chapman and Bradley, as
sisted by W. W. Poote, have already
done much work, and have stated their
determination to go ahead and not
cease till a reprieve or the gallows
makes further efforts useless.
Every few days Hill writes to sime
of the prisoners in the County Jail
with whom he is acquainted, and his
letters are all in the nature of sermons.
The murderer expresses perfect indif
ference regarding his fate, and says
that he has no desire to live, except to
convert others. There will be some
monster petition presented to the Gov
ernor as soon as Hill has been resen
tenced.

: were good, strong, true to pitch and
lusty lunged. The, alto was indifferent
and with the soprano needed a few good
lady choristers to make the musical ren
derings measure up to the possibilities of
the poorly chosen music. We say poorly
chosen, for the selections were not good:
They were not tuneful, and were sung
with no satisfactory shading of time ana
power, as a good mixed choir could have
executed them, notwithstanding the baton
of. the director waved and gyrated before
the eyes of boys glued to the scores and
utterly oblivious of his presence. This
association of choirs, or any choir, can
be taught to depend upon the organ for
all these things far better than upon a
distracting and distracted leader's baton.
The processional crosses,' some of them,
were tied with ribbons suggestive of foot
ball colors, which were a blemish to the
procession and the sacred reverence due
the cross of. Christâ the "Flag/ of Heav
en." All of the singing was true to pitch

th<- county almost pays the salary of
the Sheriff.
In Alameda County things are dif
ferent. The tramps are merely ordered
into confinement and Sheriff White has
to care for them, and has no authority
t<> Bet them to work. The amount of
money required to arrest and convict
them provides salaries for a small
army of deputy constables and Sheriffs,
and the Grand Juries have ceased to
take notice of the matter. A few days
ago the Grand Jury did express an
opinion on the amount of money given
annually by the Supervisors to lndi
gents without much investigation and
with no return.
In this county there arÂ« several
tramps who call at the jail and stay
awhile just bo often. One of these ho
bos, G. Harris "Williams, an artist, is a
"regular," and each time he does come
he leaves some souvenirs of his visit.
He once drew a series of pictures show
ing what n. good time a tramp has 'n
this neighborhood compared with the
rest of the Union, and his annual tour
always includes an engagement in Ala
meda County.
Contra Costa's example Js to be
brought to the attention of the Grand
Jury now in session in this county.

NEW POSTMASTER.
Information prom Washington
That T. W. Leydecker Is to
Be Appointed.
ALAMEDA, Jan. Positive informa
tion was received here to-day from
Washington that the appointment of
Postmaster at Alameda was to be given
to T. V>\ Leydecker, and that the nomi
nation would be made by the President
in a few days. The information comes
from such a source that its authenticity
cannot be doubted.
The contest for thla position has been
a warm and prolonged one. Originally
wen eight candidates, Including
Mr. ! i: T> Randlett, Dr. J. T.
McLean, M. L. Culver, M. 8. Taylor, <;.
Bew, J. W. Jackson and T. G. Danlells.
The real contest, however, has been 1>Â»-
tween Mr. Leydecker and Mr. Randlett.
]t was understood that Mr. llilborn had
promised Leydrcker the position in re
turn for political servii ra rendered, and
!-,â¢â  made the recommendation some time
ago. As soon as he did this tho temper
organizations of this city formu
lated a protest against tho appointment
on th>> ground that ho had been a saloon
keeper in the city und was still believed
t" be interested in the sale of liquor.
This protest was numerously signed, and
was forwarded to Washington. It 1* be
lieved that this wa-Â» the reason for the
lonK delay in making the selection, ns it
been several months since Hilborn
re. .immended Leydecker for the ;
tly Leydecker's friends circula!><! a
counter protest, in which they recited
the business abUlt] of their candidate,
his life-long service as a Republican and
his good record as a member of the
Hoard of Trustees of this city. It was
only a week ago that this wascirculated,
and received the signatures of a good
number of business men.
Mr. Leydecker is ih years nM, and was
born in Hanover, Germany, in 1543. Ho
came to this country when he was 14
years of age. and remained In New York
City for three years. Then he came to
California, where he has remained since.
He was for years a resident of this city,
and in 1893 was elected City Trustee,
holding that position for four years and
making a good record. For many years
he waa one of the proprietors of a saloon
at the corner of Clay and East streets
hi San Francisco, but sold out his inter
est somÂ» time ago. Mr. Leydecker is
well-known as a pigeon-fancier and
breeder of homing pigeons. It is prob
able that Charles Marston will be ap
pointed by him as dt-puty.

They Refuse to Serve.
OAKLAND, Jan. 15.â Several of the
physicians who have qualified as ex
aminers for the Insane patients for the

TRIED THE GAS ROUTE.
Mrs. May Miller of Liverrr>orc Tries
to Corr>rr)it Suicide and pails. \
AL.AMEDA, Jan. i.ate last night
two police officers found a woman in the
narrow-gauge depot at Park street. She
had closed the door and then turned on
the gas,. manifestly with suicidal intent.
The officers turned her out of the place,
pave her a warning and let her go. She
left, but soon after went to the Park
Hotel and applied for ft. room, which was
given her. There she gave her name as
Mrs. Mary Miller of Livermore. Eany
this morning a young man who lives at
the- hotel smelled gas, and at once gave
the alarm. An investigation showed that
It came from the room occupied by Mrs.
Miller. The door was forced" open and
she was discovered lying on the bed in
an unconscious condition, and with a
handkerchief tied tightly about her neck,
almost strangling her. A physician was
at once summoned, and after working
some time over her, consciousness was
restored and she was declared out of dan
ger. It was found that she had tried to
mop up the crack under the door with
a heavy shawl, but had not succeeded in
doing so completely, which allowed the gas
to escape and thus frustrated her design.
After she recovered she was questioned,
but would give no explanation of the rea
son for her attempt at self-murder. She
said she lived in Livermore and came up
yesterday to visit some friends in San
Francisco. She had some business at an
Oakland bank to-day, she said', and that
caused her to remain on this side of the
bay. â¢ Further than this she would say
nothing. _',â â :
A message from T.ivermore received late
this afternoon says that no such person
is known there .and that if she belongs
in that town she must have given a.
wrong name.

REGULAR ARMY NOTES
How Lieutenant-Colonel A. E.
Bates Became a Military
Attache.
A Reason Why the Light Bsttter'ies of
Artillery Did Not Make
Better Scores.
Major Edward B. Moseley of the med
iral department has been granted leave
Of absence for fifteen days.
Two of the officers of the Department
of California have been selected as mil
itary attache, one to go to the United
States Embassy at London, England,
and the other to go to the United
States Embassy at Paris, France. One
of the fortunate individuals is Lieuten
ant Colonel Alfred "E. Bates, deputy
paymasler general, chief paymaster on
the staff of Brigadier General Shafter,
v.lm has been selected for the embassy
in London. Lieutenant Colonel Bates,
while still a youth in Monroe, Mich.,
was the companion of the late George
A. < 'aster, who in after years became
distinguished as an Indian fighter, and
of George Spalding, whose father's
farm adjoined that of Bates, Sr. One
day young Bates fell into the Basin
Paver and was rescued by young Spald
ing. When the war of the rebellion
broke out young Spalding, who had
grown to manhood, organized the old
Smith Guard to- go to the front with
the Fourth Michigan Volunteers, and
one of the first to answer the call was
young Bates. After he had served as
a private a few months he was appoint
ed a cadet to the United States Mili
tary Academy at West Point. He grad
uated, and in 1565 just as the war was
closing he was commissioned a second
lieutenant of cavalry and served on the
frontier until 1569. During that time
he gained an enviable reputation for
his conduct in fighting Indians. In 1875
he was assigned to the paymaster's de
partment, and on January 7 of last year
he assumed the duties of paymaster
genera] In the Department of Califor
nia. Some time ago he was granted
leave of absence and went to Wash
ington. D. C where he waited on Gen
eral George Ppaldmsr. his old command
er in the Fourth Michigan, now a Rep
resentative fmm Michigan, and told
him that he wanted t<r go to the em
bassy at London as military attache.
Congressman Spalding told him he
would do whnt he could for him, and
in a short time he secured the appoint
ment for him. notwithstanding that
there wore a number of other army of
ficers who were well recommended and
desired the billet. The wife of Lieuten
ant Colonel Bates was a niece and thÂ»
adopted daughter of the late Edwin D.
Morgan, the New York banker, and she
inherited a good portion of his millions.
Mrs. Bates and her two daughters will
accompany the lieutenant colonel to
his new station, and as the family has
large means It is more than likely that
they will entertain on an extensive
scale.
Captain Alexander Rodgers of Trnnp
X, Fourth Cavalry, stationed at the
Presidio, ia the other fortunate soldier
who will go to Paris. He has held his
commission as captain since February,
1887, Is a man of fine education, speaks
the French language fluently and Is
well qualified for the position he has
been chosen to fill. The captain will
remain with his company until the Ist
of February, when he will make ar
rangements to take his departure for
his future home.
The recent target practice by the
heavy batteries of the Third Regiment
of Artillery developed seventy-three
first-class gunners, thirty-two of the
second class and twenty-three of the
third class, besides nineteen specialists,
one at communication and eighteen at
instruments and range tables. This is
a total of 147 out of 192 competitors.
The results of the target practice by
the light batteries of the Third Artil
lery at Redwood City some time ago
was not up to the standard that the
department expected, but that was not
the fault of the men, but of the ammu
nition. The shells that were used as

When writing the Doctor, plÂ»Â»8Â« mention this paper
ransre-flnders were pood, and good
work was done with them, but it was
with the shrapnel, that with which the
most execution is done, that the fault
was found. The shrapnel were issued
in 1894, but the walls were so thin that
they could not stand the force of the
discharge and exploded between the
point of discharge and the object aim
ed at, which was a number of dummies
representing a company of forty-five
men in columns of four in line. Taking
as a criterion the number of hits made
and the number of dummies disabled
with the shrapnel that proved effective,
it Is probable that the batteries would
have doubled their scores. The prac
tice developed the fact that the kind
of ammunition furnished in that year
cannot b*j depended upon, but it is
claimed that since then better shrap
nels have been issued.
It is announced that there will be
a grand field day at the Presidio on
either the 26th or 2Sth inst. and that on
one of those days there will be a grand
review.

Papers.
Mrs. Elise Kohler, the sole surviv
ing- partner in the copartnership firm
of Kohler & Frohling, wine merchants,
has been declared insolvent by Judge
Belcher. Mrs. Kohler, in her voluntary
application to be declared insolvent,
scheduled her liabilities at $333,173 41,
but to offset this vast indebtedness she
has in her possession property valued
at $323, 12, and a judgment of $34,
891 20 against the Southern Pacific
Company for damages to the Nadeau
Winery, near Los Angeles, which be
longed to Kohler & Frohling, the dam
age having resulted from alleged neg
ligent construction of a railroad bridge
near the winery. The case is now on
appeal to the Supreme Court, and in
the event of that tribunal sustaining
the judgment of the lower court it will
be placed among the assets. This will
allow a complete settlement of the in
solvent's liabilities and leave a margin
of $25,452 91.
In her application to be declared in
solvent Mrs. Kohier states that for
some time prior to the Jst of January,
1895, the - . . ol Kohler
a.- Frohling Ing of Elise Kohler,
Charies Kohler and Hans li. Kohler,
carried on business In this city and
here. On the Ist of January, 1895,
Charles Kohler died, and the tirm was
thereupon dissolved. The liquidation
of the affairs of the partnership were
tnitted to Elise Kohler, and on the
13th of August, 1895, she purchased
from Hans H. Kohler his interest In
the firm, and in consequence is the
sole surviving partner. As the surviv
ing parti -imed the liabilities
of the firm, and now surrenders all her

Mrs. Koh'iPr is the widow of Charles
Kohler, who in life was the senior part
ner of the old firm of Kohler. Frohling

and her sons, Charles and Hans, tried
to carry on the business, but it did not

from poison, and it was sa.i at th-- time
that, he committed suicide, but this
theory was scouted by the young man's
frier, dp.
Max TWtheun. thÂ» son-in-law of Mrs.
K<rhler. who is acting as her advisor in
the affair, pave an explanation as to
the cause of her insolvency yesterday
afternoon. He said that the entire
trouble was due to a large debt that
her husband I^ft at his death, and
which she was compelled to assume.
"At the death of the elder Kohler,"
said Mr. Bertheun. "who was the chW
partner in the firm of Kohler & Froh
llng, his wife assumed th^ management
of the firm. At hi? death the entire in
debtedness of Mr. Kohler amounted to
the erttirmnus sum â¢ which Mrs.
Kohler was obligated to ray when she
assumed the management.
"Shortly aft or she took charge of the
business affairs of the wine establish
ment the California Wine Association
offered to buy the business, being of
fered as payment for the entire stock
rrf the Kohler & Frnhling wine vaults
4OQ,orii shares in that corporation. She
readily accepted the offer and transfer
red her entire stock over to the asso
ciation, receiving as before agreed up
on. 400,000 shares of stock In ex
chanjre.
"At the time this transfer was made
the California Wine Association was
paying- large dividends on its stock, and
it was through the hope of paying her
husband's debts with these dividends
that Mrs. Kohler was prompted into
Joining' the then lucrative concern.
"Business affairs in the new house,"
said Mr. Bertheun, "prospered extra
ordinarily well for many years, and
Mrs. Kohler received large dividends on
her stock, which she devoted to the
payment of her creditors. During the
past year, however, business has been
on the decline, and in consequence the
cessation of dividends was declared
necessary to the existence of the as
sociation.
"With this decline in business came
disappointment to the hopes of Mrs.
Kohler, and also the Increased demsind
for money on the part of her creditors,
who-, seeing ih;ii she v.-is unable to pay
them th*-- dividend money, demanded
immediate payment, urn!, threatening
the unfortunate woman with suit un

them for the amount of their respective
bills against the old iirm of Kohler &

pressed by the creditors for money, she
took the last step in her business ca
reer and applied for papers of insolv
ency. In all these years, from the
first day Mrs. Kohler joined the asso
ciation until she applied for Insolvency
papers," said her son-in-law, "she has
done her utmost to pay the indebted
ness, even going so far as to sacrifice
her personal property and everything,
in fact, of any value that she poss
in order to satisfy the demands of her
unreasonable creditors. She, in fact,
parted with everything but her inter
est in the wine association, and this
she clung to as long as she could. The
time for the payment of her debts,
however, was drawing near and the
dividends in the wine association were
already discontinued thereby compell
ing Mrs. Kohler to make her last sacri
fice in the interest of the creditors.
"She, however, hesitated long before
doing so, but at last, under advise
ment, she applied to Judge Helcher for
the necessary Insolvency papers, stat
ins that she was financially bankrupt
and turning her interest in the wine as
sociation over to the courts to be sold
in the Interest of her creditors. This
stock is valued at $1 a share and if its
disposal realizes this sum the total
amount of money received for th<
tire stock will amount to $400. 000. which
will more than pay the claims against
her."
The discontinuance of dividends which
compelled Mrs. Kohler to dispose of her
stock in the wine association was
caused by a disagreement between th<
wine producers and the makers and the
uncertainty of the prices that this trou
ble caused in the market.
WILL BE KINGS
OF PURGATORY
A New Side Degree That Will
Be Given by the Pythians
in February.
The New Organization Will Meet
but Once a Year for
Business.
A new organization, with the abbre
viated name of I. O. K. of 1., which
means Infernal Order of Kings of Pur
gatory, was brought into life last night
in Pythian Castle.
The moetlng for the institution of this
new auxiliary degree of the Knights of
Pythias was presi<?<-<] ovrr by George W.
Momeith, who stated to the n^r
tlves of the several local lodges of Pyth
ians that the idea of such a body had its
origin in Golden City Lodge, The Idea
was fully explained and discussed, and
the organization was effected by the
choice of a committee that will r-jnirt
the names of officers at the next meeting.
It is proposed that I. O. K. of I. Bhail
hold a session on the 19th of February
of each year, the anniversary of the
foundation of the order of Pythlans. N*<>
one shall be eligible to membership but
members of the Order of Knights of
Pythias, but the degrees <>f the new or
der, which will be several in number, may
be conferred on any member of non-Pyth
lans, who will be permitted to apply for
the privilege of becoming Inducted into
the several mysteries, on the recommen
dation of members.
The ritual that has been prepared with
great care is. It Is said by those who have
perused it, one of the most Interesting of
any side degree that han ever been pre
sented. The candidates will be given an
Insight into the workings of some secret
societies, which will make th<*m feel at
times somewhat startled, but the les
sons they will learn will b" most in
structive. The paraphernalia necessary
for the carrying out of the degrees and
tho uniforms to be worn by the kings of
purgatory, namely, the sublime king and
his four imps, it is said will be very fine.
At the meeting held last night commit
tees were appointed to carry out the ob
jects of the organization and to make
preliminary arrangements for the con
ferring of the degrees on the 19th of next
month.
Another feature will be the selection of
a queen fr.r the day of the celebration.
Each lodge will be permitted to BUKKesi
one lady; then a vote will be taken. The
one receiving the highest will be the.
queen, and the four next highest will be
her mauls.
Champagne.
Moet & Chandnn has the proud dis
tinction of occupying the second place
in our Champagne table for the first
time in the annals of the trade. The
brand has not only moved up in posi
tion, but the importations have in
creased in 1897, as compared with the
previous year, over 12Vs per cent, which
is a larger ratio of increase than that
made by any of the other prominent
brands. In addition to this. Moet &
Chandnn was selected during the year
as the only wine served ;.t some of the
ultra-fashionable entertainments given
in this city. The fame of the win- has
traveled from coast to coast, and its
quality has endeared It alike to the

from the southeast, while at 3 p. m. it
was "thick" and blowing twelve miles

den change in the wind was against
the anxiously expected ntrwnynr Peru
and the watchers at Melggg wharf were
correspondingly disappointed. Among
those who waited all day for the
steamer were United States Marshal

A COAI FAMINE
IS THREATENED
There Is Now a Scarcity
of Fuel in the Local
Market.
Every Coal-Laden Vessel Ar
riving in Port Met With a
Long Line of Carts.
Prospects Not Very Encouraging fcÂ£
an Immediate Increase in
the Supply.
There is a scarcity of coal in the
market, and coal dealers are far behind
in filling the orders for their customers.
Early yesterday morning the steamer
Empire arrived in the port with a cargo
of about COO tons, and she was met at
the wharf with a string of coal carts
that reached nearly six blocks. The
coal dealers were notified the day be
fore that the vessel was to arrive dur
ing the night, and that she would com
mence discharging at daylight. Al
most as soon as the notices were re
ceived carts were sent to the dock to
wait the arrival of the vessel. The first
of trie string of carts was at the bunk
ers fully twelve hours before it was
known the vessel would commence to
discharge, and all night long the line
grew. The coal was hauled away as
soon as it came out of the hatches, and
by dark last night the market was, as
far as the big bunkers at the wharves
are concerned, as bare as before the
Empire came into port.
The recent bad weather along the
coast has held coal-laden vessels back,
and the supplies for the past month
have not been as great as desired, and
then the recent cool spell greatly In
creased the consumption of the supply
then on hand, until now there is little
coal of any kind to be had. The pros
pects for a supply for Immediate uses
are not very encouraging. The total
amount of foreign and Eastern coal
that can possibly arrive here in the
next sixty days from all sources foots
up less than 47.000 tons. The consump
tion of the city and vicinity depending
on this port for its fuel supply will be
fully 240.000 tons. It means that a big
draft will have to be made on the out
put of Seattle, British Columbia and

upon George M. Sti
psychology of the urlveraity at Berke
ley, who has lately subjected himself
to such an experience.
The professor â  . [ Jn this â 
experiment for the pun testing
a theory of the science hioh
holds that in order for Th mind to
graep the posith n <.f an object as an
upright it is n Bsary | mina
to Invert the Image of !'; when the
Image is projected from the eye the
mind gets the idea of it being in the
position in which it actually is, but in
order t-> gel thai Idea, a. [.art of the
process of the eye's operations is to
turn the object upside down, so that
the Image j n the retina is Inverted.
The purpose <>f Professor Strattnn's
investigation was to combat this the
ory of science and to show that the
mind's acceptance of the positions of
things depends upon relations of
space, touch and the locations of other
objects. That it Is entirely possible to
perceive upright positions and accord
our movements to their locations In
space by going through the world with
all objects appearing in exactly the
position that their images stand in the
retina of the eye. It was to prove this,
to show that one could come to accom
modate himself to an upside down
world, could live in it, work through it
and not suffer Inconvenience from the
topsyturvyy turvy aspect of things, that Pro
fessor Stratton endured his curious or
deal.
Throughout he carefully noted his
sensations, analyzed his own conduct,
the tendency of his will, the sugges
tions of his mind ai a copious
diary of his f-xj which he
transmitted to an Eastern specialist
mapazine devoted to psychological sci
ence. Advance sheets of the contribu
tion showing it to be forty-five napes
long have reached the professor at his
home in Berkeley.
The professor arranged a mask to
wear over his face, with a set of
lenses fitting both eyes. It was found,
however, that this contrivance could
not be used. At a short distance from
the unobEtructc-d eyes their lines of
sight converge and both eyes receive
the same impression of the one object.
But the professor's tubes were about
four inches long:, and their projection
Interfered with this coalescence of the
retinal lines, so that there were set up
distlncr. imapes of the . objects seen.
Headache supervened after these dual
tubes had been worn but a few min
utes, and thfs increased in severity as
the hours wore on, until it ultimately
became unedurable and the left tube
with its lens was taken out of the
mask, leaving only the right one re
maining.

is 110 degrees. This limit of' his field
of observation precluded the professor
from seeing any part of his body ex
cept the lower portion of the trunk and
limbs, 'and the lower halves of his
arms. These members, as soon as the
mask was justed, became strnngoly
inverted.. The left hand, seemed the
right hand and vice versa; the feel
were reversed and the legs, instead of
leading upward and toward him, were
directed downward and out of the field
of his vision. His chest seemed to be

STRANGE EXPERIENCE OF PROFESSOR STRATTON OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA
For the purpose of ascertaining a few scientific facts, Professor Stratton, curator of the department of psychology at the State University, subjected himself to
an ordeal such as few men would be willing to pass through. With a lens fastened in front of his eyes he tried to live his usual life for eight days. This lens
turned the world upside down as far as appearances went, and with these strange, uncanny surroundings Professor Stratton had his being for over a week. His
experience was a most trying one, but he lived through it and found out a few things of great scientific importance.

that what disturbed him was not the I
things he saw, but the things he re- j
membered. The visual arrangement of j
objects clashed with the Images in his j
mind of their arrangement Impressed
by past experience. He tried to feel]
that as soon as he could banish his j
mental adjustment of objects, supplant j
them with the new order Of things, he i
would no longer suffer those qualms â 
and surprises which now visited him. j
T us composed, he arose to seek the !
It* .n which surrounds the house. All {
movements of his limbs were exceed
ing awkward. Only when the action
was regardless of what he saw, and un- :
der the guidance of touch or memory,
as when one moves in the dark. could
his walking or movements of the hand
be performed with reasonable security
and directness. Otherwise the process
was a series of attempts and correc
tions. The limbs started In the oppo
site direction from the one really de
sired. "When I saw an object r;.-ar one
of my hands," he says, "and wis!
grasp it with that hand, the other hand
was the one I moved. The mistake was
then seen, and by trial, observation
and correction, the desired movement
at last brought about."
Finally reaching the lawn, the pro
r surveyed th*- trees growing out
of the sky, noted that the firmament
h.'id become ceiled with cement In long
sidewalk Btreaks, and observed, I
he looked ahead of him that I

:l stone and threw it. The pr^"
saw it leave the thrower's hand, re
marked the direction it was bring sent
and anticipated the sound of its falling
on his left. Whack! It struck the Bide
of the house on his right; the proi
quickly looked around and then
the Btructure, stuck against the g
sky, its contents held within it by a
massive peaked nnd shingled bottom.
During the early (lays i t the â¢ â â

Hut after the second day the situa
tion began to improve. Much of the
confusion which attended the early
stages of tii<> experiment had pnnscd
away and the condition was no longer
a strain upon the nerves. The pr
sor was even able to walk abroad and
enjoy the physical delights presented
In this strange aspect of thr scenery.
Commensurate with this change,
or images of adjustment In the normal
faded away, and were replaced by th>
inverted order. When places or objects
were recalled, they did not recur in the
old adjustments, but in the new. If a

imagination did not fancy jt in n Mor

found upside down: the memory took

With all this came Internal peace

of biblical prophecies leads dl

thirteen different lines of prophecies al

Among these are the increase of riches,

of faith in things spiritual, and th<*

CURIOUS TELEGRAPHIC
MISUNDERSTANDING
As long as privnte telegrams can
only be transmitted from one person
to another at the rate of halfpenny

same time risk misunderstandings,
some serious, some laughable.
A couple of friends were staying re
cently at Ballator. in Scotland, and
were to bo joined on a particular Sun
day afternoon, fur th^ afternoon onJy,
by two others from Aberdeen. In t lie
the afternoon, however, tho rain
poured down plteously at Rallater and
a wire was sent to Aberdeen Informing
the pleasure-seekers of the state (<t af
fairs and asking if they int. tided to
come. The reply sent was: "Certainly
not. Raining cats and dogs here."
Unfortunately this was read. "Cer
tainly. Not raining cats and dogs
hÂ« re," and the result was that two
miserable beings, drenched to the skin,
sauntered wearily about Ballator sta
tion for hours and hours till there
were no more trains that nipht, when
home was sought and temper freely
exhibited.
Another story told of Aberdeen is
that there was a gentleman, well
known there of the name of Saint.
Any telegrams addressed "Saint. Aber
deen," would have found him. But on>
time the name of another Scottish
town was substituted for Aberdeen in
this brief address, and tho telegraphic
authorities at the receiving end were
puzzled. They at once returned the
message over the wires with the inti
mation and instruction, "No Saints
here. Try Aberdeen."

It i- well known that press tele
prams are sent to newspapers at
groatly reduced rates nd are deliv
ered on large sheets of tissue paper,
technically called "flimsy," about 100
words appearing on each sheet. Tele
graph operators, knowing the skill of
sub-editors, abbreviate freely, such
contractions as "biz" (business , "rhg"
(right hon. gentleman), and others of
a like kind being regularly used, while
new ones are Invented as necessity
arises. On one occasion the late John
Bright was making a speech on an ed
ucational topic, which was being tele
graphed to the press, and found it nec
essary to frequently make use of the
word "children." "Chn" being the un
derstood abbreviation for "chairman,"
the telegraph clerk could discover no
means of shortening the word, but at
length became tired of writing it in
full and put "kids" instead, trusting
to the sub-editor to make it right. Un
accountably, however, the sub-editor
passed it, and when the paper came
out Mr. Bright, to the astonishment of
his admirers, was represented as hav
ing spoken of "the dear little kids."
A pupil was on one occasion intro

wasocoaslonally intrusted with the fill

official dit-patch from the commanding
officer of a British expedition, which
was being carried out at that time, la
which it was announced among the
casualties that a private soldier had
been killed. When official Information
of this character is comunicated the
regimental number of the victim is pre
fixed to his name, and so the news in
this case would be sent something like
this: "Casualties. Killed. MB7, Pr

lieving that news of alarming import

it, knocking out Prtrate Bouthi name

ROMANTIC COURTSHIP

Japan is a long way off, and this
charming story of how courtships are
carried on among the elite of the so
ciety of the land of the rising sun has
not been confirmed by travelers, yet it
is pretty enough to lie true.
In certain districts in houses wherein

an ornamental character is encircled
by a ring and suspended from the win

and therefore we feel sure that the
time of Jesus' Becond coming Is very
near, "even at the doors."
The coming 1 of Christ Is to be an no
tual and literal coming in the flesh, as
he was caught up into heaven after his
resurrection. He will appear in the
clouds accompanied by his angels, and
the righteous, both the living and
dead, will go with him to heaven, while
the wicked will perish at the sight of
his glory and brightness. The heaven
which we look forward to is not sim
ply a state or condition, but is a re
ality, a blessed abode wherein the elect
will live and reign with our Redeemer
for 1000 years before their return to
earth. It may be on one of the pla
nets, or perhaps â and this seems to
some of us more likely â on the glorious
sun itself, the center of our solar sys
tem. Wherever it Is, however, it is
a certainty, a place of "many man
sion?," where the righteous shall be
especially blessed by the personal pres
ence of him through whom they are
redeemed.
For 1000 years the earth will lie des
olate and forsaken, and the wicked,
who rejected the Saviour while thoy
had the opportunity to obtain his
grace, will wait in a dreamless sleep
their final judgment At the exnira
ti"n of this period of the Lord and his
people will descend to earth and the
doomed shall be summoned to their ac
counting, after which they are to be ut
terly consumed by fire from heaven,
which is also to burn and purify this
whole earth, and make it fit for the oc
cupancy of the great family of God
which is to live in happiness and glory
inexpressible forever.
We do not believe Jn an everlasting:
hell of fire and brimstone, but we do
believe in an utter blotting out and de-
Btructlon of the wicked. Every chance

If You Cannot Sleep
at Night Read This
THE necessity of regular sleep for
the maintenance of good health
h;is long been recognized by ob
servant minds. The Impossibility of
sleep at Will, however determined one
may be, brings on ii state Of painful
n< rvinisn â  ss. Physical and moral sen

is very little energy in him. He is
particularly accessible to morbid in
fluences and predisposed to adynamic
forms of sickness, according to the
New York Herald.
This summary of the evil effects of
insomnia holds good whatever the form
It may take â whether deep comes only

But if apyretic Insomnia baa i>ad ef

sleep is infinitely more painful in the
case of patients stricken with fever.
H< nee the physician called in must de
vote all his energies to find a remedy,
v. ich must in each' case be preceded
by a study of the original cause of the
trouble.
It is correct to say that besides the
insomnia Cue to abuse of coffee, tea or
alcohol, the sleeplessness due to chlor
osis, anaemia, arteri-sclerosis or ex
treme pain, there is a whole category
of essential insomnia, so called be

these varieties of sleeplessness, and
more particularly for the one last

drugs to cure a case of persistent in
somnia following upon a carriage ac

sheer despair, to the following rather
complicated treatment, which had the
desired effects:
The principle of this method is to
tire out the muscular system by a ser

patient first of all stiffens himself out
on his bed, then raises his head half

rejection of God's mercy is concerned.
There can bo no repentance or forgive

Our people do not set a precise date

true and wo are told therein that "the
day and the hour knoweth no man."
The definite prophecy made by William
Miller was based on a miscalculation
and a misconstruction of certain scrip
tural terms. He expected that the
world was to come to an end in 1844.
but that was in reality only the end
of definite prophetic time â the end of
Christ's priestly ministrations In hea
ven, and the beginning or the work of
investigative judgment. "While we do
not attempt to even approximate the
"great and terrible day of the L,ord,"

coming, and will go with him. with

our duty to be prepared and to help
to prepare others, and to do what good
we can to the poor and suffering. Hav

an inch, breathing slowly and deeply,
ab.Â»ut eight times a minute, and counts
his breaths.
At about the twentieth inspiration
the li. ooing fatigued, is allowed
to fall inch, and the patient, still re
maining stiff, raises his right leg and
lets it fall when tired, alternating with
the left leg.
When the muscles are not employed
for these exercises, they must be tensed
in stiffening out the body. The patient
also must raise his body, supporting
himself on the back of his head and
his heels.
Then turning on the right side, the
sufferer begins the whole series above
mentioned and does the same on his
left side.
It will thus be seen that eight suc
cessive positions are taken, involving
constant muscular exertion. The
author adds: "If sleep does not come
after the first cycle of movements,
then they must be repated till it
does."
Mr. Learned must be congratulated
on having codified and scientifically
regulated the time and movements of
what we may call "the art of turning
in bed." But I must admit that I have
no great confidence in the soporific
value of his process.
The retort may be that it succeeded
in his case. At any rate, it is harm
less, and that is in itself a reason for
trying it.

Narrow Escape of
a Young Hunter
From a Vicious
"Tusker."
FOR years past a select lot of i
knowing- hunters have been hav
ing exciting Bport knocking wild
hogs in certain sections of the
Ban Joaquin River bottoms. It
Isn't every day though that the ven
turesome hunters are almost killed by
the cornered hogs. Thnt fate, however,
nearly befell William Douglass last
week. If .Tim Pope, with a trusty Win-
Chester, hadn't been standing near by ;
Douglass wouldn't be telling the exclt- \
ing story he dors about the old "tusk- .
er" that' had him down in a rush.
The country they hunted in is wild
and densely covered with an almost
Impenetrable tangle of vines, low brush
and occasional trees. All old residents
tilong the lower San Joaquin valley
know just such territory along the
bottom lands where the water over
flows In the spring. Hundreds of wild
hogs inhabit some of them.
It was in just such a jungle, near
Lathrop, where young Douglass went
to bag some wild hogs, and it was in
"thin same jungle that "Old Man" Ty-
Bon hid after killing Deputy Sheriff
Buzzfll on Thanksgiving eve, 1595. To
this wilderness of willows and under
brush Williams and Schlagel fled last
September after attempting to wreck
and rob the south-bound New Orleans
express.
Nearly every traveler in California
knows of Lathrop, in the banner wheat
county of this State, but very few of
the passengers who dine at the station
dally know that less than five miles
away there is this wild spot where boar
hunting can be followed that is every
bit as exciting as the famous hunts in
India, There can be no "pig sticking,"
to be sure, for the hunter who wishes
to. bay a wild porker in the San Joa
quin underbrush must rely on his rifle
and enough nerve and strength to
carry him on hands and knees beneath
the network of vines and buches.
The land thereabout abounds in
coons, and coon-hunting is a favorite
pastime with the sportsmen of San
Joaquin County. Occasionally when
running down one of these ring-tailed
despoilers of hen roosts the hunters
run across one of the droves of wild
hogs that sometimes venture out into
the open places on the river bottom.
The hunters, however, rarely venture
into the thickets on the old Trahern
ranch and in the underbrush, where
the wild hogs root out a living. It is a
dangerous venture unless one is pre
1 to meet a roving vicious old
"Tusker." Williams, the train-wrecker,
now serving a life sentence in the Fol
som State Prison, knew this wild sec
tion well, and told the authorities that
he crawled all night long through this
: on the evening of the Morano
hold-up. He was looking for a hiding
place where it would take the officers
him, and he was in just
the right ttmtry to find such a
place. HÂ« might still be at large had
not hunger and curiosity forced him to
leave the haunts of the wild lmgs.

<*"T"\ HEODORE F. REWARD of New
York is the man who is trying to
bring about the banishment of

are five "Don't Worry" circles in
this city, to say nothing of others
throughout the country, and more are
being formed.
So now all you have to do is to buy
a copy of Mr. Seward's little book,

your patrons forget to pay their bills,

patrons, you are unable to meet your

BONES OF A MASTODON
FOUND IN TULARE COUNTY.
AT VARIOUS times in the history of California the
fOBSfI remains of extinct mammals have been ex
humed by the farmer's plow or the miner's )ii<k.
but probably the most satisfactory specimens that
have ever been found on \J\>- Pacific Coast are those
recently brought to light by some ranchers in Kings
County.

the Tule River, some three miles cast from the waters <>f

BIG PRICES PAID FOR BOOKS.
The question as to the highest price
ever paid for a single book is one which
has long interested bibliomaniacsâ people
who are not in any way to be con
founded with bibliophiles. The biblio
maniac is merely a collectorâ somewould
rail him a prankâ who looks upon a book
as, he would upon a piece of blue china,
a thins to be valued only for its rarity,
and not for its contents. The bibliophile,
on the other hand, is a reader, a man
who looks between the covers, but is
not, as a rule, rich, and therefore the
records of phenomenal prices have little
to say of him. In the world of biblio
maniacs the prince is Bernard Quaritch
of Piccadilly, the famous London book
seller, who for years has bought and
Bold the highest priced editions. Time
was when Quaritch. starting as a re
tail bookseller on his own account, was
willing to sell a volume for the humble
sum of 8 cents, but to-day, nous avons
change tout cela. Quaritch's catalogue,
just issued, is in itself an expensive af
fair, ranging in price from $1 25 to $5,
according to the style of printing and
pet-up. A glance at the volume shows
that Quaritch nowadays does not deal in
cheap editions. The lowest priced book
on his list is a folio copy of Cicero,
printed in Venice, for which he asks
only $70. From this sum the prices range
up to 526.250 for a copy of the Psalter
ium Latinum, on vellum. This is said to
be the second book ever printed with a
date. The year is that of 1459, and the
magnificent typography of the work,
combined with its age, gives it this al
most fictitious value. But Quaritch, ac
customed to handling big figures, does
not think the sum at all excessive. Next
on his list, at a price of $25,000, comes a
still older Bible, the famous Bihlia Lat
ina, or Mazarin Bible, dated 1454-66, the
first book ever produced by typog-
raphy.

about to get a little nearer. I went to
the left and Jim to the right.
"The old rascal must have scented us
for he lifted his snout and started for
the brush directly in front of where I
was standing. I stepped out and
in the excitement shot too soon, for he
was over seventy-five yards off. The
shot never touched him and he made
straight for me.
"I did not think there was any dan
ger, for I knew all I had to do to get
another and a better shot was to pump
another cartridge into the magazine.
I tried to work the gun. The cartridge
stuck. I pumped it for all it was worth
but it would not budge.
"I was on one kneee using every
muscle to dislodge the shell and the
boar was coming head on like a lim
ited express.
"I saw he'd reach me before I could
Jump anywhere for safety, so I
clubbed the gun and made a
pmash at him. But I slipped on the
soggy ground and he was at me when
I heard Jim's Winchester crack. The
boar looked as big as an elephant to
me for an instant. I'm sure his tusks
looked larger than a mastodon's.
"He was right over me, and one of
his tusks grazed my duck coat as Jim
caught him between the shoulders. I
laid flat on the ground, reaching for
my knife, as the boar toppled over.
"That's the closest shave I ever had.
Catch me fooling with those magazine
shotguns any more. 'Trombone,' that's
what the crack Reliance man calls
himself, may break biuerocks with
them, but I'll take a rifle and a 44
caliber Colt's besides when I go after
wild hogs again.
"What we should have had waÃ a
lot of good dogs. Then there would
have been a pretty fight. I'll bet that
old boar would have made it warm for
the best dogs in the country.
"When Jim fired the boar fell directly
across my body, and I couldn't get out
from under him till Jim ran up and
helped to roll the big brute over. He
did not look quite so big when he was
stretched out as he did when standing
over me with his head ready for a
gouge, but he was a vicious looking
rascal just the same. We each have
one of the big tusks as souvenirs of
that fight.
"On the way home we bowled over
another. An old sow and two pigs
were rooting acorns under an oak.
This time we had a 'cinch,' for we were
right on them, and while I put a load
of buckshot into one of the pigs Jim
caught the sow right under the left
shoulder. Then o\ir troubles began
again. How to get them out through
the brush was the next question. We
finally decided to take the pig and let
the old woodchopper take the sow out
if he wanted her.
"That night we had a feast In his
cabin. He dressed the pis, difl the
cooking and w<=> d'd the rest. I tell you
we were hungry."
Several other hunters are contem
plating a trip into the bottoms for a
boar hunt, but they intend to take
along several good coon dogs to see
what sort of a fight one of the big
boars will make.
Oscar Marshall of the Stockton po
lice force is an old~time market hunter,
ITe declares that there are hundreds
of wild hogs along that portion of the
San Joaquin west and south of the rail
road bridge. He hunted there over
twenty years rigo, and at that time it
was a common thing for the market
hunters to knock over a wild hog when
they wanted fresh pork.
It Is estimated that 400,000 larks arÂ«
sold yearly for food at the Leadenhall
Market, London.
6. Attack it definitely as something: to
be overcome.
7. Realize that it never has done and
never can do the least good. It wastes
vitality and impairs the mental facul
ties.
8. Help and comfort your neighbors.
9. Forgive your enemies and conquer
your aversions.
10. Induce others to join the Don't
Worry movement.
Mr. Seward's earnestness is shown in
a later work on the subject, which haa
not yet appeared. "A don't worry cir
cle," he says, "may be large or small.
Any family may agree to resolve itself
into a don't worry circle, and many arÂ«
doing so. On the other hand, mem
bers need not even live in the same
place. There is one circle of three
members, two of whom live In New
York and the third in Michigan. They
study the scientific principles of the
subject and help each other by corre
spondence. Usually members live in
the same town and have regular meet-
ings."
It has been suggested that school

justifies the enormous price Quarltoh
sets upon it. It was among the earliest
products of Guttenberg, who Is one of
the persons credited with the Invention
of the art of printing from movable
types. This is a vexed question, but the
Bible itself is undoubtedly authentic, it
having obtained its name through the
accidental discovery of a copy by De
Beere in Cardinal Mazarih's library at
Paris. Probably this is the Syston Park
copy which Quaritch purchased some
years ago. At the famous Brayton Ives
sale, held in New York in immense
excitement was created by the purchase
of another specimen of this rare work
for $14,800. A contemporaneous ac
count of the sale says: "The circum
stances under which this copy was pur
chased, its acknowledged rarity, the
various surmises -concerning its value
and the report that it was about to re
turn to England, gave special import
ance to the sale. Although it has six
teen leaves in fac-simile, its condition,
height, purity of vellum, its illuminated
letters, have given it a world-wide repu
tation. The story of it is brief. Mr.
Brindiy bought it in Europe. At his sale
in :w the late Mr. Hamilton Cole pur
chased it for JSOOO, Mr. Ives at that
time being the next highest bidder.
When the Syston Park copy, badly
cropped, was purchased by Air. Quar
itch for $17,500 and offered to Mr. Ives at
a small advance he immediately decided
to purchase Mr. Cole's copy."
Whether even this enormous sum was
the highest ever paid for a book is ques
tionable, for a French authority claims
that $50,000 was given by the German
Government for a missal presented by
Pope Leo X to King Henry VIII of Eng

Edward Stuart, commonly known as the
young Prei i â 
Late In the afternoon of September 22,
1750, I received the following letter:
"Dear Friendâ By the time this is
placed in your hands 1 shall be at sea
on my way to Antwerp. It is all over.
Under the name of John Douglas the
Prince has been In London for nearly a
week and nothing has come of It. There
is no prospect of a rising. Gentlemen of
quality and influence, however devoted to
the Prince, have no mind to risk their
lives and estates by marching on London
unless supported by a strong body of
regular troops, believing that exile, or
more probably the scaffold, would be the
sure and certain end of any such rash
undertaking. To speak the plain truth,
1 am much of that way of thinking my
self, and. having wife and child, will not
draw my sword until 1 perceive some fair
prospect of success.
"I write to warn you of that which con
cerns you nearly. The other day the
Prince came unexpectedly to a party at
Lady Primrose's, great!} to 'the conster
nation of her ladyship and of most of her
guests. Indeed, he met with but a cold
reception from any but your betrothed.
Miss Kate Gordon, and her cousin, An
drew Macintyre, who were both present.
"Miss Gordon went down on her knee
before them .-ill and kissed his hand. It
was very bravely done and moved him
greatly, but. indeed, it was scarcely pru
dent. Macintyre followed her example
and I heard him whisper to th*> Prince
that if his royal highness would deign to
honor his poor house with a visit this
evening (ye 22d) he would meet with a
very different kind of welcome. Learn
ing that Miss Gordon would be present
the Prince consented.
"Now, a word in your ear. This Macin
tyre is not to be trusted. I have Infor
mation from a sure source that he is a
spy in the pay of the Government, and
that the man with one eye, the odious
creature, Donald Fraser, who follows
him about like a shadow, is. if possible,
a more Infamous wretch than him*
"The house Is in a lonely situation and
I am convinced that these scoundrels aro
concocting some plot to betray the Prince
and are making use of Miss Gordon's
grace and beauty and well-known devo*
tlon to the Jacobite cause to entice him
Into a trap. I tried to give the Prince a
hint of this, but ho listened to me coldly,
and indeed of late he has become noto
riously Impatient of advice from his best
and truest friends.
"That Miss Gordon should be made an
accomplice in this. villainous scheme will
I know, be hateful to you, and I doubt
not you will do what lies in your power
to prevent it. Yours most faithfully
"MATTHEW FIELDING."
My Hood boiled as I road his letter.
I was no friend to the Stuarts, and, In
d little whether the Pretender
was taken or not; but that Kate should
he involved i n this infamous plot was In
describably painful to me, and i -
lutr-iy determined that Bhe never should
be if word or act of mine could prevent
Yet it was no very pleasant task for
me to Interfere In tho matter, for there
had already been a sharp quarrel be
tween Kate and myself with regard to
this Macintyre and her passionate de
votion to the cause of the unhappy
Stuarts. She was an orphan and Mac
lntyre. being her cousin, had undertaken
to act as her guardian, a piece, of pre
sumption which I bitterly resented, for
I had good reason to believe that he
hated me and meant, by fair means or
foul, to supplant me In Kate's affections,
and win her and her small fortune for
himself. But he had been out with the
Highlanders in 45, and . the courage be
had then displayed and his hypocritical
professions of attachment to the prince
cast a glamor about him In the eyes of
a young and romantic girl. Nothing I
could say would induce her to put an
end to their friendship, and we had
finally parted with bitter words on both
sides.
But Fielding's letter drove my anger
to the winds. Come of it what Would I
was resolved to go boldly to Macintyre'a
house, and insist upon her leaving it at
once. I would escort her to the lodgings
of my aunt, Lady Chester, who would, I
knew, receive her gladly.
So I buckled on my sword, procured a
coach and drove quickly to Macintyri 'c
house, which lay some distance from the
city. Within 200 or 300 yards of the gate
I alighted, and, leaving the coach hidden
in a lane near the road, walked forward
by myself.
In spite of my antipathy to Macintyre.
â¢ I confess there had been moments when
I could scarcely believe him capable of
the infamy of which Fielding had ac
cused him; but. when in the gathering
dusk I reached the gate in a high stone
wall which encircled the spacious gar
den, all my doubts vanished at tho sight
of the isolated house, the lighted win
dows of which were hardly Visible
through the thick foliage of the trees
that surrounded It on all sides. No cry
for help would be heard beyond the
walls. The victim once Inside that lone
ly building, and sword or bullet might
do its work and none be the wiser.
. My heart beat quickly as l passed
through the gate. Such a man as Mac
lntyre was not unlikely to clutch at any
means of getting rid of a dangerous
rival, and I knew well that I carried
my life in my hands. I thought I
might be refused admittance, but the
gate Stood wide open, and no one ap
peared or challenged me. But that
brought me- little comfort. It Is ever
an easy matter to enter a trap. It Is
when you seek to leave it that the dif
ficulties begin.
Still I went doggedly on, though, as I
.approached the house. I was confident
that I could hear a faint rustling In the
bushes to right and left, as though in
visible spies were stealthily dogging my
footsteps. Then a thing happened that
confirmed my worst suspicions. The door
suddenly opened and was swiftly shut
again, but not before I caught a glimpse
of two or three figures slipping hurriedly
Inside. hat could these things mean if
they did not Indicate treachery and foul

I am not ashamed to say that my limbs
trembled and the cold sweat stood on my
forehead, as. after a moment's hesita

ly forward, knocked at the door. It was

and Forbidding countenance and but one
eye. He was no other than Donald Fra
s=er, the detestable parasite of Andrew
Macintyre, against whom my good friend
Fielding had particularly warned me. It
might have been fancy, but it seemed to
me that his greenish gray eye sparkled
with a kind of malignant triumph at the
sight of me I think a spider might so
regard the fly that ventured innocently
among the meshes of bis web.
Yet he readily made way for me to en
ter, and went at my request to tell Kate
that I wished to speak to her. He was
gone some time, and I was sure that he
was informing Maclntyre of my presence
before carrying the message. to Kate. It
would have surprised me little had I been
refused speech with her; but presently I
could hear her fresh, girlish voice, high
and sweet and clear, singing "The White

The ratcroseepte size of such a lot as
this can best be shown by comparison.

of his voice. "I thought I heard you

who would not live or die with Charlie?"
His eyes dwelt on her with a look that
made me grind my teeth and grip the
hilt of my sword. I would have given
all I possessed to spring forward and
settle the matter with the cold steel,
but I knew that with a shout he could
bring his cutthroats upon me. and my
death would leave Kate defenseless in
his hands.
Kate was ever quick witted and ready
of speech, but the sure knowledge of hla
treachery, and the tragic situation in
which she was placed, seemed to freeze
the words on her lips. She bent her
white face over the harpsichord and I
paw her fingers trembling as they wan
dered over the keys. I think 'twas the
bitterest moment of my life. I could
neither get her away from the house nor

YOUNGEST ACROBAT IN AMERICA.
The youngest acrobat In the world is in San Francisco. His name Is
Philip Paulinetti, and his age a little less than 4 years. He is the son of
Peter Paulinetti, of Paulinetti and Piquo, the team of acrobats recently
at the Orpheum. With this fact in mind, it is not to be wondered at that
Philip is a trained athlete, for his father is one of the best in his line that
have ever appeared before an Orpheum audience- Some day Peter will
go the way of all athletes, and Philip bids fair to become a worthy suc
cessor.
When only 2 years of age, Philip could perform a surprising number
of tricks, in fact he could at that early age puzzle many of his elders in
the same line of business. He now performs with ease and grace "hand
stands," "plaunches." -"trapeze swings." "head balances," "hand bal
ances," and no end of tricks on the horizontal bars and r'ngs. One would
hardly suspect, at first glance, that Philip possessed the physical develop
ment beyond his years, fo*r he only looks the rosy, healthy youngster that
he is. nothing more.> But see him stripped and ready for work and he is
another sort of a "man." His muscular development is something won
derful for one so young. He is fond of showing what he can do and
takes particular delight in displaying his agility on the bars or in'doine
hand stands and balances. He has a muscular development or the arm,
unusual in a child of his age. Moreover, he is proud of it and when bid!
den will double up his tiny fists and harden his biceps with the pride of a

ÃBrouchtU Broucht face to face with the man he
had betrayed even Macintyre lost his
nerve7though he tried to brazen it out.
"You may understandâ" he began,
and then his eyes fell and he looked
moodily at the floor. "I think the situa
tion explains itself." he said gloomily.
The Prince drew himself up and looked
at Macintyre with unutterable scorn and
"%*s& indeed," said he. "I have had
to do with spies and traitors before but
never with one who invited me to his
house as a guest in order to betray me.
But this time, thank God, you have
overestimated your cunning and my
simplicity. You fool, do you suppose
that I have walked blindfolded into your
?lumsv trap? Look around you.
Almost before I realized what had
taken place 1 saw Macintyre turn wn te
and heard the sword drop clattering
from his nerveless fingers, while his ac
complices glanced round about seeking
a way of escape. All eyes had been
fixed on the Prince, so that the men
who now stood sword in hand at every
door and at the head of every passage
had come upon us unheard and unseen.
At a glance I recognized the races 01
several well-known Jacobite gentlemen
both Englishmen and Highlanders, and
I saw at once that Macintyre had been
cleverly caught in his own trap, en
tangled in the very meshes of the web
he had spun to entrap the Prince.
These were the men who had lurked In
the garden, who had stealthily entered
the house, and the author of this plot
within a plotâ Donald Fraserâ who had
betrayed the betrayer, was now leering
triumphantly at Macintyre from his
post behind the door. Macintyre caught
a glimpse of his grinning face, and his
eyes gleamed with diabolical fury.
"You hound," he exclaimed, this is
your work."
"Yes." said the Prince coolly, "you for
get what most of your kind would do -â 
well to remember, that it is as easy to set ;
a spy upon a spy as upon an honest man,
and much easier to tlnd those who will
betray him. I pretended to fall into your
trap in order to trap you, lest good
friends of mine should suffer in future
by your treachery. It would be but bare
justice to hang every man of you, but
your lives shall be spared for the present
if you instantly lay down your arms.
Take their weapons, gentlemen."
The conspirators were so thoroughly
cowed that they gave up their arms with
out a struggle. In the meantime Kate
had whispered a few words to the Prince,
and he beckoned me toward him.
"I find that I owe you a debt of grati
tude for your conduct this night," he
said graciously, "and I sincerely trust
that at some future time it may lie with
in my power to repay you."
Then he turned to Kate.
"As for such loyalty as yours, Miss
Gordon," he said, "a poor exile has no
fitting reward. Nay v I think the only re
ward I can give you is to release you
from further service to a race so unfor
tunate as mine. Pardon me."
He took the white cockade from her
breast and handed It to me.
"See." he continued, "I give it into the
keeping of your future husband, and I
pray that you will not wear it again un
less he himself pins it upon your breast.
My errand here is accomplished, and to
night I leave London. Sloth and avarice
have eaten away the loyalty of those
who should have nocked to my standard.
They wish to save their estates and will
not thrust their own heads into danger,
though they would be willing enough
that the poor Highland lads should leave
their bones on another Culloden moor.
But I will have no more useless blood
shed, please God, and so sail for France
till better times. Farewell."
Kate could not speak for the sobs that
choked her, and Iâ well. I feel no shame
at the confessionâ knelt and kissed his
hand with tears in my eyes. 'Twas the
last we ever saw of Prince Charlie, the

IN the skirmish which took place
last month between the Germans
and Chinese at Kiaochau the dis
3 patches state that among: the kill
_Â£_ ed was a scarred Chinese who sub
sequently turned out to be a for
mer pirate chief, one of the lead
ers of the terrible band that* was wiped
out by the British in l>>f>o. He was
known as Lun Tai. Although he was
most notorious and has had a price set
on his head for years he managed to
elude the European coast guards until
his accidental death in the recent skir
mish that ended in the German marines
seizing the important post.
Captain George E. Jackson, who
served in the campaign that wiped out
the last famous stronghold of the pi
rates, remembers Lun Tai well and the
prominent figure he cut In the Inces
sant assaults on English commerce in
the China seas. It was one of Lun
Tai's bold raids that led to a combina
tion the English war vessels
and the Chinese regular soldiers for a
i action against the murderous
pirates. Efforts were made at the

known to be the head, front and brains
of the most tricky, most daring and
most heartless gang of pirates that

the Chinese main. After the famous
engagement of the pirates' stronghold
the dead were all carefully examined,
but Lun Tai, the fox, was not among
Months afterward it transpired
that Just before the trap was sprung
that penned the pirates within the
small bay before their mud forts Lun
Tai had received warning from som<> of
the very Chinese that the British had
sent forward as snies.
Of that three days' stubborn fight
with the cornered pirates, of their d^s
struggles to escape when
hummed in and of the execution of
about 400 survivors afterward by the
Chinese authorities, Captain Jackson
tells as follows:
"Lun Tai was the cleverest and blg

devils. They killed and plundered from
sheer delight in such work. Many's the

We lowered the ropes. The sick man
appeared at first Bight to be dead, h

worked over him for hours that he
could tell us the Btrange circumstances
that had thrown him into the hands of
the Chinese fishermen.
"Emaciated and changed through his
sufferings we hardly recognized him
as a Mr. Moss, who but a few days be

for Japan. The brig was manned with
sixteen as good sailors as ever climbed
the ropes, and we knew that it was a
case <>f 'pirates.'
"The cunning devils, as usual, had
waited until the brig waa well out of
Hongkong and Just off Ninepin Rocks.
On the mastheads of the Junks the pi
rates had stationed men with baskets
filled with stinkpots, a chemical com
position of suffocating properties
which they put into bags, light with a
fuse and throw on the decks of th<
sels they are attacking. The chemical
gases that arise kill any one who in
hales them.
"< )ne by one the sailors fell as the
pirates rained the stinkpots on th>
deck of the brig. Moss, the supercargo,
was the only one who had not f
He seemed to be protected by ume
special providence. With a last look
at his dead companions, he leaped Into
the water, preferring death in that
way. In an instant the pirates saw
him. Yelling with rage, they thn-w
their spears at him. Just then a v.
hove in sight, and without waiting to
loot the brig the pirates hoisted sail
and disappeared as suddenly as they
had come.
'Moss was a strong swimmer, and
though he was badly wounded, by
â  human efforts he managed to
make th<=> seven miles to Ninepin Rocks.
Near there he was picked up by the
Chinese fisherman. He fell uncon
scious as soon as they laid hands on
him.
'When Mosb told his story our com- i
mander, with a mighty thump on the !

'At br.-ak of day we wore at it again.
FT"w the rascals fought! They hurled
their spears and gurgals with the
strength of demons. v>'V a time it
! a bit ticklish for us. They
bt so stubbornly I began to think
would'nt quit till every man Jack
of them was cut to i - Twice men
standing n^xt to me f>-l! wounded.
Once I heard some one say "My God!'
and I saw the man back of me trying
awkwardly to pull the trigger of his
gun. and for the first tirr.e he noticed
that three of his fingers were shot
away.
"\re realized that defeat meant some
horrible death, and we fought desper
ately to escape it.
"According to my log book we finally
drove those pirates who escaped from
the disabled junks onto the shore. We
lost ten men and several more were
mortally wounded. As near as we could
make out not more than 500 pirates
ever reached the shore.
"On the third morning, under cover
of constant firing from the gunboats,
we lowered launches armed with ma
rines and made for the shore on the
right, thus flanking the pirates, who
expecting us to land in front
where they had strewn 'crowsfeet' for
our hem-lit. These 'crowsfeet' consist
of six pointed highly seasoned pieces of
bamb >o, sharper than a needle's point,
capable of penetrating the toughest
leather arid inflicting torturous wounds
on thÂ»> feet. Had wÂ« not escaped this
trap the day would undoubtedly have
gone against us.
â¢ We were now about evenly matched
in numbers, and the pirates were still
as determined to win as we were, but
their smail swords and iron headed
spears were their only weapons.
"It was now a hand to hand fight.
The pirates called into play every cun
ning trick at their command. I jumped
over a seemingly dead pirate only to
reel -with a sharp thrust from his spear
in my side. Undoubtedly he would
have killed me before I could have
turned, for I never suspected the trick,
but a marine several paces behind us
saw his act and bayoneted the wily
fellow before he could jab me again.
"When neither cunning tricks nor the
absolute disregard of death could keep
them they began to give way in
bunches and, well nigh exhausted our
selves, we drove them from their stock
ade and up the hills. That was shov
ing them out of the frying pan into the
fire, for on the brow of the hill the Chi
nese regulars were drawn up waiting
for them.
"But our own â¢work was not over. Our
wounded had to be carried to the gun
boats and then every vestige of the
stronghold of the pirates had to be de
stroyed. In razing their fortifications
our first lieutenant set fire to a house.
He did not know gunpowder was stored
in it. He was blown clear over seve
ral houses. He landed in a pond of
water and except for a bad burning es
caped all right. We took all the flags
and gongs in sight and then sank all
the junks.
"A big reward had been offered for
Lun Tai, dead or alive, but as I said
before, we did not catch him. When
we boarded our own vessels we had
hopes that the Chinese regulars would
capture him. Under orders of their
major they- were specially anxious to
catch the cunning villain.
"We got back to the harbor of Swa
tow in time to see the captured pirate?
marched in, all dragging heavy chains;
they were battered, ragged and covered
with blood, they looked the fighting
devils they were.
"Tas Tai, the Mayor, summoned all
the inhabitants of his district on the
plain before the town and all the cap
tured pirates, about 450. were beheaded
as a warning to all sea robbers.
"I never expect to see such a scene
again.
"Men chosen for the purpose gath
ered up the severed heads of the pi
rates, and placed them at equal dis
tances around the walls of Swatow,
where they hung for three days. It
was horrible, but from that time pi
rates ceased their depredations in that
locality.
"Tas Tai ought to have been satisfied,
but he was not. After looking at the
long rows of heads upon the walls he
declared that he would rather have
L:in Tai's head than all the others put
together. He was fearful that that
scheming marauder would raid Swa
tow and take a terrible vengeance, and
he begged our officers to give him the
protection of the gunboats for some
weeks. But Lun Tai kept away.
I guess the quick and clean
work we made of that pirate strong
hold was a wholesome lesson to him,
as it certainly was to the migratory
pirates who before that used to period
ically raid that region. We never saw
his ugly face again anywhere near
Hongkong, and T guess the rumor was
true that he and his junk full of dare
devils drifted Tonquinward in search
of booty.
"Tf the Germans nailed him by acci
dent or otherwise in Kiaochau they
hr.ye done a work that every merchant
on tho coast of China wanted to see
dune many years ago."
GREAT LONDON FIRES.
Ever since the "Great Fire" of 1666
London has been the scene of many
terrible conflagrations, and It is not
going too far to state that it is owing
to her well-equipped and efficient fire
brigade, with its sixty-one stations
spread over the Metropolitan area, that
she has not been visited with a similar
catastrophe. That historic fire de
stroyed some eighty-eight churches
and 13.200 houses, burning old St.
Paul's, the Royal Exchange, the custom
house, and other notable buildings.
A glance from that period down
ward till the last great fire which has
Just occurred in the neighborhood of
Aldersgate street, many memorable
HOW LUN TAI,
THE WILY ONE,
ESCAPED,
outbreaks are recorded. The great
Tooley street fire probably stands pre
eminent. It broke out at Cotton's
Wharf on June 22, IS6I, and continued
burning for a month. Mr. Braidwood,
the then chief of the Metropolitan Fire
Brigade, was killed by some falling
debris, and some other twenty persons
lost their lives. The damage was es
timated at more than Â£2,000,000.
On New Year's Day, 186$, another
riverside fire broke out at St. Kathar
ine's docks. This was not got under
control without much difficulty, though,
fortunately, no lives were lost. Her
Majesty's Theater was burned on De
cember 6, 1867, and the Oxford Music
Hall suffered the same fate some two
months later.
The year 1882 has been described as
"the year of fires." During this period
the flre brigade had their hands full,
and they had to tackle no fewer than
seven conflagrations which threatened
to be of a serious nature. The Wood
street fire which broke out on Decem
ber 18 was probably the biggest of all.
It burned for torty-eight hours, in
which time property to the value of
more than two million pounds sterling
was destroyed. Whiteley's in West
bourne Grove was the scene of two
fires, one occurring on November 17,
involving a destruction of Â£100,000
worth of property, and the other,
which broke out on Boxing Day, also
did great havoc. Two theaters were
destroyed in this year, the Philhar
monic Theater at Islington in Septem
ber, and the Alhambra Theater on De
cember 11, at which latter three per
sons lost their lives. On the 17th of
the same month St. John's Church,
Forest Hill, was totally destroyed.
Others could be mentioned, but the
foregoing show what the fire brigade
had to face in that "year of fires."
The next great outbreak was the
famous Paternoster Row fire, which oc
curred on April 2, 1884. The fire spread
with great rapidity, and those who wit
nessed it will remember how the dome
of St. Paul's was brilliantly illumin
ated. More than a dozen warehouses
were destroyed, including the extensive
premises of Faudel and Phillip, Wil
liams, and Smith Brothers.
A fire which occurred in the early
morning of April 24. 1885. at 194 Union
street, Borough, and known as the
"'Borough fire," is rendered memorable
through the heroic conduct of a serv
ant girl. This brave young woman
saved the lives of her master's three
children, but was dreadfully burned
in doing so. She died three days later.
She was literally besieged with letter
and telegrams of inquiry and condol
ence from all parts of the United
Kingdom, one coming from the Queen
and another from the Princess of
Wales. It is believed she received more
than 3000 such letters.
Three memorable outbreaks occurred
in 1889; the Milton street fire, on May 6,
doing damage to the extent of Â£250,
000; the Charterhouse Square fire; and
the Forest Gate Industrial School sad
catastrophe, at which twenty lads lost
their lives.
The Queen Victoria street fire, which
broke out on December 30. 1890, differed
from all those that preceded it. The
weather was of Arctic severity, and
the firemen became incased from hel
mets to boots in coats of glass-like
mail, the sprays from the nozzles
quick' y turning to ice. Captain Shaw
looked like a veritable Santa Claus go
ing about with thousands of icicles
clinging to his hair and beard. Next
morning the ruins presented a most
picturesque appearance, being coated
with millions of icicles. Following
close on this fire was the St. Mary
Axe outbreak of July, 1893. when dam
age was done to the extent of a quar
ter of a million sterling.
Nickel is a modern metal. It was not
in use nor known of till 1715. It has
now largely taken the place of silver
in plated ware, and as an alloy with

AN AMERICAN POET.
THE POEMS AND PROSE SKETCHES
JAMES WHITCOMB ill LEVâVol
ume I. Neighborly Poems and Dialect
Sketches. Bcrlbners. New York.
t*m t MERICAX readers need no lntro
f I ductlon to James Whltcomb Rlley,
f I recognized on both sides of the At
y^ I iantic as the foremost writer of
X that dialect verse which in the
United States embodies the hu
mor, pathos and tragedy of rural Hfe.
In the final article of the volume
before us the author, in strong, terse
English, vindicates the new school of
literature and insists on the necessity
for a reverent, scholarly treatment of
dialect. But the best vindication is to be
found in his own poems, which appeal to
universal humanity while expressing the
yearnings of those suns of the evil who
cry with himâ
I want plane facts and I want plane
words,
Of the good â¢ M-fashlor-ed ways.
When speech runs free as the songs of
birds
Way back in the early days.
In those early days speech must have
been not only as free but as musical as
bird song, if we are to Judge by Mr. Ri
ley, who sings like another Burns the
poetry and grace of farm life. Could
anything be nrnre enticing than the pic
ture brought before us in '"Wortermelon
Time"? Has the glory of the field ever
been sung more sweetly than in "The
Clover"â
And T pray to Him still for the strength
when I die.
To go out in the clover and tell It good
by.
And lovingly nestle my face in its bloom
"While my soul slips away on a breath of
perfume.
Or, again, ha? the pens* of loss ever
been more :'â ;:â :â¢ r'' - expressed than in the
dirge for "Little Haly"â
"There's sorrow in the wavin' leaves of
all the apple t-
And sorrow in the harvest sheaves, and
sorrow in the br<
And sorrow in the twitter of the swal
lers 'round the shed :
And all the song hrr redblrd sings Is
'Little Haly's dead.' "
But Mr. Riley's humor lies very close
to his pathos; he has a fellow-feeling for
the fiddler whose "playln's only mld
dlin'," but who loves his instrument with
the passion of a born artist, for
From her strings across her middle to
the screechin' keys above â
From her "apern." over "bridge," and to
the ribbon round her throat.
She's a wooin*, cooin' pigeon, singing
"Love me," ev'ry note.
And there is a sly touch worthy of old
Lafontalne in the parable of the Tree
Toad, who has been "hollerin' " all day
for rain:
But I fetched herâ O I fetched her
Cause a little while ago.
As I kind o' set.
With one eye .shet.
And a singin' soft and low,
A voice drapped down on my fevered
brain.
A-sayin*. "Ef you'll Jest hush I'll rain."
Perhaps Mr. Riley's refined mastery of
dialect Is most fully shown in his prose,
and the one sketch in this volume, "An
Old Settler's Story," is, in its way, an
admirable piece of literary workman
ship. Led on by unaffected style, homely
language and illustrative detail, the
reader unexpectedly lives through a vil
lage tragedy, while the accompanying
undercurrent of unsatisfied romance is
Indicated in a few subtle touches. In this,
the first complete edition of the author's
works, Messrs. Scribner will include, the
contents of the two volumes formerly
published under the titles of "An Old
Sweetheart of Mine" and "Old-fashioned
Roses." The present volume opens v.iih
a quaintly graceful salutation to Benja
min F. Johnson, the "Hoosier author,"
in whose personality Mr. Rlley at first
merged his own. A life-like portrait
also deserves mention.
POETRY WORTH READING.
THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHTâ By
Edwin Arlington Koblnson. Boston:
Richard G. Badger & Co. Price $1 20.
Mr. Robinson's poetry is far superior
to much that is foisted upon the public
to-day. His verse is not the whining of a
sickly poetaster, neither is it so full of
egoism as to be merely a rhymed record
of his own moods, a word picture of an
unpleasing personality. The trouble with
the majority of our minor poets is that
they chirrup about themselves and their
little sorrows instead of singing about
God's sunshine, the world nnd the joy?
and griefs of their fellows. Mr. Robinson
appears to be an exception to this rule,
as his verse is decidedly healthy, and,
except in a few places, metrical and
even. The sonnets are particularly good
pieces of workmanship, and the thought
contained in them is on a far higher
plane than that of the average I
writer. One of the best of these is worth
reprinting:
Oh for a poetâ for a beacon bright
To rift this changeless glimmer of
dead gray;
To spirit back the muses, long astray,
And flush Parnassus with a newer light;
To put these little sonnet men to flight
Who fashion, In a shrewd, mechanic
way,
Songs without soul?, that flicker for a
day,
To vanish in irrevocable night.
What does it mean, this barren age of
ours?
Here art- the men, the women and the
flowers.
The seasons, and the sunsets, as be
fore.
What does it mean? Shall not one bard
arise
To wrench one banner from the western
skies.
And mark it with his name for ever
more?

MARK TWAIN'S LATEST.
FOLLOWING Tin: EQUATORâ By Mark
Twain. Hartford Conn.: The American
Company. John J. NV-whegin, agent for
the Pacific Coast. Price, doth-, $4.
That wit, like pood wine, improves with
ape, is made dearfy manifest by Mark
Twain's latest story, "Following the
Equator." The humor in this new vol
ume is, if anything:, even k- ener than
that which appeared in this popular
writer's books when he was a quarter
of a century younger. The writer's style
Is also decidedly more even.
Mark Twain is as much an American
institution as the cin -us and the peanut
vender. Two generations have laughed
with him, and others will continue to do
so as long as the English language is
spoken. His humor is spontaneous and
<lean; its quality, like that of mercy, is
never strained.
To those who cannot afford the luxury
of traveling nround the globe, this book
can safely be recommended as a substi
tute. Moreover, by taking this route, the
globe-trotter will see all the sights and
will not have to put up with' the insults
of overbearing custom-house officials.
The i.n sent work consists of over 700
pag< i and is profusely illustrated by such
well-known artists as Frost, Dan Beard,
T. Fogarty and F. K. Seinur.

sory survey of a country. He spent, for

Miss BtckneU's "Life in the Tullerles

out hs a writer capable of retelling in
popular form the pathf-tic story of M.iri<-

characters In history. The daughter of

woman. Yet history records no sadder
or more tragic fate than that which lay
in store for her. The happiness ot the

ery, humiliation and physical Buffering,
followed by violent death. The lights and
shadows of thin unhappy life are vividly
brought out in Mis.s Bicknell's fluent nar

the feeling that he hns been an eye
witness of the gayeties and griefs of the

It is a happy circumstance that Mme.

ously with Marie-Antoinette, for h.r

It is the aim of the author In this essay
t" shew that no good can come of the
numerous socialistic schemes for improv
ine the present condition of the poor. He
considers the existing method of distrih
| uting the products of human activity by
moans of the wages system, and seeks to
demonstrate that it tends to establish
â¢working people in a state of Independence
rather than subjection; to promote "in
dustrial freedom" and not to produce "in
dustrial slavery." lie shows how inti
mately the welfare of workmen is con
nected with that of their employers, and
how the attempts to diminish the wealth
of corporations may diminish the fund
of capital out of which the wages of
workmen are paid. Change may be
brought about by compulsory measures,
but such methods are seldom beneficial
or lasting and hence the failure of social
ism.

SMALL TALK A LA MODE.
It is permissible to wonder who reads
the guidebooks to conversation and eti
quette which arc turned out by arbiters
of fashion every year. Then must be a
demand on the part of people who are
seriously in quest of enlightenment; for.
although these works are occasionally
amusing to the general reader, they can
not depend mainly on his patronage.
Moreover, they are not written by the
practltionera of "comic copy"; they have
â a gravity of tone which bfeflts the social
importance of the theme; and they are
distinguished, as a rule, by Intimate
knowledge of the usages of "society." It
is this knowledge which produces the ef
fect of unconscious satire. A new volume
called "The Art of Conversing" has no
literary merit; the author does not pos
sess even an elementary sense of humor;
and yet we have a picture of life which
might almost be described as more subtle
and searching in its irony than the "Book
of Snobs." The vapid Inanity of what
passes for conversation in polite circles.
the small subterfuges of the social mis
cellany which Is "at home," gives dinners
anddances and runsdownlntothecountry
for a couple of days, could not be better
portrayed by a consummate artist. In one
of Mr. Pinoro's farces some of the dra
matis pirsonae are driven by a tire in
the dead of the night to the house of a
neighbor; and la the morning one of the

tho whole scheme of Intercourse depends
upon the exchange of the smallest Ideas
in the thinnest of verbal artifices.
Lack of intelligence, says our author
blandly, Is the chief reason why "society*'
finds conversaton so difficult. Apparently
there are people who need to be told
that a certain kind of address should be
met with "Really!" "Indeed!" and "Oh,,
yes!" You might suppose that any talk
ing animal above the intelligence of a
parrot would make these valuable ob
servations spontaneously; but it is clear
that, without a course of study, many
ladies "in society" will find them-
speechless. Take the case of a hostess
in a new house receiving a ceremonious
call from a neighbor. You might think
that she would start upon the tempera
ture by Instinct. People have discussed
the heat and cold for so many genera
tions that even a baby lisping its first
syllable ought not to be considered a
prodigy if it were to hazard this entranc
ing subject to another baby at their first
meeting. But the hostess will probably
be dumb unless she has pondered the
text-book, which gives her this inspir
ing lead: "I am afraid you find it rather
warm here; perhaps you would like to
sit a little way from the fire?" Why
should not every visitor and every lady
"at home" be openly armed with copies
of "The Art of Conversing,'" like tour
ists with Baedeker, and begin the con
versation with. "Let me see; what is the
dialogue for this act? Oh, here we areâ
page 33"? This frankness would rub off
the edges of strangeness and kindle any
spark of humor that by rare chance
happened to be handy and combustible.
But this would never do "in society."
that wilderness where the natives dwell
In shuddering dread of "vulgarity."
There may be confidences in the drawing
room about the milliner, though the
hostess may not say, "Whore did you
get that hat?" because the phrase might
be reminiscent to somebody of a comic
song. But no self-respecting woman
could confess that her innocent commen
taries on the weather were laboriously
modeled on "^The Art of Conversing."
A certain 'sprinkling of science may
season your small talk. The oracle has
thoughtfully recognized the X rays. "I
am very much interested in hearing
about the rays. I had my hand put under
: them. The bones appeared to be enor
! mously large. Why was that, do you
! think?" This question is said to "put
an almost ready reply into the
mouth of the companion of the moment."
The bewildering student may wonder
] what it is. If the "bones" are feminine
he ought to reply that the X rays are ev
| idently capable of malicious exaggera
tion. But even if this obvious compli
ment came to hand "ready-made" would
it not be regarded by the lady as a trans
gression of the rules of the game? She
might be tempted to retort, "You are for
| getting the copy-book!"

MO longer neefl the round faced

out at the sid^s and adapt a coif
fure that makes her countenance
assume the proportions of a full
moon Just because It is the prevailing
fashion. For many seasons past this was
â what she was expected to do. Now a
change has taken place. There are coif
fures this season of IS9S for almost every
type of woman. And each one bears the
Ftamp of tho latest fashion. Of course,
they all have a few characteristics in
common, but never before in the history
of hairdres?inp bus t'.i^re been bo many
varied styles in vogue at the same time.
Just when the pompadour -was at the
height of Its dignified glory Cleo Merode
came to town and ears were suddenly
hidden from the vulgar view. For a time
the Merode coifure was the rage. But
Bow the fashionable girl is threatened
with a greater calamity. It is rumored
that the old-fashioned waterfall Is com
ing back. Daguerreotypes are being stud
ied and false hair has suddenly gone up In
price. In London the waterfall of forty
years ago Is the acknowledged coiffure of
the season. It is here, too, in New York,
but so far in a somewhat idealised fash
ion. In the new waterfall there Is an ab
sence of the Btralght, severe parting. The
entire head is covered with a mass of un
tfulatlnc waves. They ripple over the
forehead and fall carelessly over the
ears. The chignon at the back is not so
large as it was when the fashionable
girl's grandmother wore it. But It's Just
the same shape and it's covered with a
net, and there are curls to add to Its
Quaintness. YearÃ ago the waterfall was
always accompanied by two rather long

II of Narbonne. The Roentgen
x â y * rays enable us to see through
wood and flesh, but they are
powerless against metals. Yet this wo
man of Narbonne, we are told, can not
only read a letter wrapped in a me tall
wrapper, but can read it when It Is at
â  a great distance away from her.
Dr. Ferroul discovered this marvelous
woman. The doctor, who was some
years ago a socialist Deputy In Paris,
recently settled down at Narbonne and
determined to devote all his leisure to
the study of occultism. So* he tried his
hand at turning tables and, like bo
jnany others, strove to obtain messages
ftrom the dead by means of Planchette
and spirit rapping. His success was not
marked in any direction until one day
he became acquainted with a woman
, who possessed the strange faculty of
â¢ "reading letters through opaque
â¢bodies.''
The doctor was amazed. He tested
the woman several times, and in no In
stance did she fail to read the letter
correctly.
Then he sat down and sent word of
his wonderful discovery to a friend of
I his, Dr. Grasset, professor of medicine
at the University of Montpellier. The
latter, who is well known in Paris as a
eavant of great merit, was at first
wholly incredulous, but finally prom
ised to test the woman's power in his
own way. First, however, he went to
Narbonne and had a long conference
â¢with Ferroul, after which he returned
to Montpellier and wrote the folowlng
4 words on a half sheet of paper:
"The deep sky reflects our tears in
its stars, for we weep this evening at
. Reeling that we live too much."
Over these words he wrote in one line
three words, one in Russian, another in
[GÂ«rman and the third in tne Greek lan
romantic looking curls. They were worn
at the left side, or one was allowed to
fall over each shoulder, according to the
caprice of the fair wearer. The new
curls are shorter. They are bobbing, ap
parently energetic, curls and do not sug
gest the sentimental curl of the
fashioned waterfall in the least. They
are worn tucked under the new chignon.
Just at the left side. With this new wat
t-rfall the hair is either brushed back in
pompadour fashion or it is parted at the
left side and a ourl or two is allowed to
fall over the forehead. This parting the
hair on the left side is one of the chief
novelties in the coiffures for IS9B. It lookÂ«
particularly well when worn with the
fashionable hats of the season, which
have Invariably a flarine brim at the left
side. The best hairdressers par that
women with low foreheads will wear the
hair a la pompadour throughout the win
ter. The pompadour Is made high or low,
â¢waved or plain, according to the way It
is most becoming to the individual wear
er. On the other hand, the fashionable
girl whose forehead Is broad and high
may feel she Is equally up to date if she
allows a curl or two to rest upon her in
tellectual brow. But here are a few im
portant facts they must both bear In
mind: Plain straight locks are out of
fashion. No matter the arrangement of
the coiffure every hair must be waved.
Ears at least must be partially hidden.
Broad effects are greatly in vogue and
puffs and curls are everywhere.
The hair Is arranged very low on the
neck for street wear, and the chignon

guage, and then he added a final line I
containing the word "Montpelller" and j
the date of the month. This paper he j
folded in two, with the writing- on the i
inside, and then he covered it entirely
with a sheet of tinfoil, such as is used
for chocolate. This he turned down
at the edges and he then slipped the
whole into an ordinary envelope, which
he tightly fastened with gum. Finally,
as Dr. Ferroul had warned him that ,
string sometimes interfered with his I
subject's reading powers, he fastened j
the envelope with a safety pin, which j
pierced in such a manner that it formed
a sort of padlock, and, this being done,
the pin was embedded in a ma.<^s of
black sealing wax, which was stamped
with Dr. Grasset's coat of arms.
To this sealed envelope Dr. Grasset
attached his card, with a few words,
and then he placed the document in a
large envelope and sent it by mail to
Dr. Ferroul at Narbonne. Two days
later he received the following letter
from Dr. Ferroul:
"Mon cher maitre: â
"When your letter reached me this j
morning my subject was not at hand, j
I opened the first cover containing the ;

Is the pronounced fashion. Nets are
much worn. For evening wear all the
coiffures are extremely high. Puffs are
used In great profusion, and the hair is
twisted and colled in many curious up
standing loops. The simple coiffure for
oither street or evening wear has gone
entirely out of fasl'>n. Not only are the
coiffures themselves elaborate, but the
my subject's house Is distant at least '
300 meters from mine.
"As we leaned against a table I
passed my hands over my subject's
eyes and this Is what she told me with- ;
out having seen your envelope:
" 'You have torn the envelope.'
" 'Yes, but the letter to be read Is In

" 'The one with the large black seal?'
" 'YÂ«>s; read.'
" 'There la some silver paper. â¢ â¢ â¢

" "Then there is a short name that I i

to take this?)
"Then she read the word Montpelller
and the date on your letter.
"There, cher maitre, is the report of i
the experiment, which lasted at most !
a minute and a half. lam returning
you your envelope with my letter.
Yours, DR. FERROUL."
Dr. Grasset was exceedingly sur
prised when he received this letter. To
him. indeed, the story savored of the
supernatural. The sealed envelope was
once more in his possession; there was
not the slightest evidence that it had
been tampered with, and yet this
strange woman had read the entire
contents with the exception of the few
words in Greek, Russian and German.

ment that reading through opaque bod

les belongs to the domain of possibility?
Wonderful, if true, and yet not as won
derful as the fact that the reading in
this instnnce was done at a considera
ble distance. The subject not merely
read the words that were inside the
closed and sealed envelope, but she did
so at a time when the envelope was 300 |
meters away from her and when there i
were between her and It such solid ob
jects as her own house and Dr. Ferroul's
house.
Clear, however, as the facts were. Dr.
Grassot was still half afraid of being
mystified and therefore he submitted
the sealed envelope to the members of
the Academy of Sciences and Letters of
Montpellier, and, by opening it in their
presence, satisfied them that the en
velope had not been tampered with.
The members were as puzzled as Dr.
Grasset, and at once decided to make
a new experiment. Consequently a
committee was appointed for this "pur
pose, and it was agreed that the "mem
bers thereof should not know thf con
tents of the envelope and, while on
their way to Narbonne should not let it
for a moment out of their possession.
As to the result of this last experiment,
nothing has yet been made public.
ICELAND EIDER DUCKS.
Good "Words: All accounts I have
read about elder ducks say that nests
are robbed of their down twice, the
duck supplying it each time from her
ornaments which decorate them are
many and wondrous to behold. So many
ornaments are worn in the neweÃt even
ing coiftures that there is danger of this
hairdressing becoming a rival of the
much-talked-of theater hat. Aigrettes
are all the fashion. Some of them match
in color the costume with which they are
worn; others are combined with a tiny
own body, and the third time the
drake gives hia white down, and this
is allowed to remain; but I was told
by farmers In Iceland that now they
never take the down until the little
ones are hatched. It has been found
that the birds thrive better and In
crease faster when they are allowed
to live as nature meant them to do.
So now the poor mothers are no long
er obliged to strip themselves of all
their down to refurnish their de
i spoiled nests. Some times if the
; quantity is very great a little may be
â  taken, but enough must be left to
cover the eggs when the duck leaves
her nest foor food.
A writer upon Iceland, in speaking
of a visit to one of the Isafjord farms,
write:
"On the coast was a wall, built of
large stones Just above high-water
level, about three feet high and of
considerable thickness at the bottom.
On both sides of it alternate stones
had been left out, so as to form a
series of square compartments for
the ducks to make their nests in. Al
most every compartment was occu
pied, and as we walked along the
shore a line of ducks flew out, one
after another. The house was a mar
vel. The earthen walls that surround
it and the window embrasures were
occupied with ducks. On the ground
ostrich tip, and then there are the very
costly hair ornaments of aigrette and
diamond pin together. One of these lat
ter ornaments seen recently showed a
small gold comb gleaming with diamonds,
while towering above the glistening gems
was a feathery black aigrette, powdered
with bits of rhinestones, which looked
like dewdrops in the sun. But the
aigrette is by no means the only orna
ment of the hour. My lady of fashion
strings her hair with jewels if she can
afford it. Jeweled chains encircle her
groups of dainty puffs. Jeweled pins
hold her willful locks of hair at the back
in place and Jeweled combs of all sizes
add to the beauty of her coiffure. For
hair decoration mock jewels produce just
as pleasing an effect as gems of the first
water. Borne of the latest coiffures, when
ready for the dance or the opera, are
decorated with four side combs, a strinsr
of Jewels, a Jeweled pin and a jeweled
pompadour comb. The airy gauze butter
fly is another favorite ornament for the
hair, and Mercury wings are still in
fashion. Pert lltlo bows of accordion
pleated ribbon may now be bought at the
shops with a hairpin attached. They
give a pretty touch to a girlish coiffure.
Tiaras of velvet are another fad of the
hour. They are generally studded with
mock gems, and to a tall, regal-looking
girl they are apt to be most becoming.
The coquettish girl always finds room to
tuck a rose In her hair, and she does
not need to be told how to do it. Both
coarse and fine nets are worn with the
new chignon, and a few which are sell-
Ing at an exorbitantly high price have
bits of Jewels caught here and there in
their meshes. The woman whose crown-
the house was fringed with ducks. On
the turf slopes of the roof we could
see duck 3, and ducks sat on the
scraper."
About 10,000 pounds of elder down
are gathered annually in Iceland, 7000
pounds being exported to foreign
countries. Formerly the peasants
used to receive over 21 shillings a
pound, but the price has now fallen
to half that amount. The peasants
seldom receive money, and are obliged
to barter their down for merchandise,
at the little settlements at the fjords.
A pound and a half of down is enough
to fill an ordinary bed puff. These
very comfortable articles are found in
the guest room of every Icelandic
farm, however poor and small it may
be. After a long, hard day in the sad
dle the traveler longs for warmth and
shelter. These little guest rooms have
never had a fire in them, and, built as
they are on the ground, there is a
dreadful chill in them. Once tucked
away in bed, however, and well cov
ered with the down puff, a delightful
sense of comfort follows, and tired
bones lose their pains and stiffness.
HER MEMORY SYSTEM.
"Talking of memory sytems," said
the suburbanite on the accommodation
train, "I can't for the life of me see
Ing glory Is not as thick and luxuriant as
she might wish need not be discouraged
â when she reads of these elaborate coif
fures, for she may buy a chignon ready
made which no 0110 could possibly detect
from hor own. and in these days of mod
ern civilization there are even bargain
days in puffs and curls.
It behooves every woman to give spe
cial attention to the care of her hair In
these days of waved and decorated coif
fures. If the hair is to be kept strong
and healthy the effect of the curling
iron must be counteracted. A daily mas
sage of the scalp will do much toward
strengthening and beautifying the ap
pearance of the hair. Brushing every
night and morning is a good stimulant.
As many as a hundred strokes a day
should be given. In case the hair is fall
ing out, rub the scalp twice a week with
a solution of brandy and salt; once every
three weeks at least the hair should be
shampooed. For this purpose nothing is
better than an egg shampoo, using both
yelk and white. This will strengthen
the growth of the hair ' and. If used
faithfully, free the scalp of dandruff. The
egg shampoo is to be highly recommend
ed. The yelk of the egg acts like a tonic
to the scalp. It supplies it with the
necessary Iron and sulphur to keep it in
a. healthy condition. The white of the
egg furnishes an alkali, and this, com-
blned -with the oil of the hair, makes a
soapy substance better for cleaning pur
poses than any soap in the market. After
the shampoo special care must be given
to the drying of the hair if neuralgia is
to be avoided. The hair should be rubbed
thoroughly with a warm towel and then
given a sun bath if possible.
how a man who Is unable to remem
ber one thing Is helped by having to
remember two. If I tie a string around
my finger I must recall the purpose of
wearing It â which I never can do. If
I must always think of rain when I
want to carry an umbrella, I have dou
ble work. Now, my wife wanted me to
remember something to-day and she
gave me a word to say over to myself.
And I've forgotten the word."
"Pooh. It's easy enough to remem
ber things if you give your mind to it,"
said another suburbanite. "My wife
told me to be sure to order some â now
what the mischief was it? Soap?
Blueing? Well, that's funny. I thought
I would be sure to remember!"
He plunged his hands into his over
coat pockets to cover his chagrin, and
pulled out of one a rough bit of scant
ling, with a memorandum in lead pen
cil attached.
"Well, I vow! My wife must have
stuck that thing in there. Oh yes, I
see. It was a load of kindling she
wanted me to order. But one could
hardly be expected to remember a
thing like that."
"I wish I could find a reminder of
what I am to get as easy as you did,
but my wTfe doesn't believe in giving a
sample to help out a poor memory.
Hello, old fellow, how's that?"
He had pulled a little rubber shoe
out of his pocket and was regarding it
with loving eyes.
"Sammy's overshoe, by all that's
queer! And here is something inside.
'Length, five inches.' Bless her little
heart, I'd have forgotten all about
them if it hadn't been for this mem
ory lesson. There's something In Uia

not only has Mrs. Drayton's mother be
lieved in her, but she has from the first
thunder-clap of disclosure been deter
mined to re-establish her daughter on
an enviable social footing.
John Jacob Astor has also stood by
his sister loyally. When her father cut
her off in his will her brother came for
ward at once and generously bo?; I
a million upon Mrs. Draytim. Fr. T.i
start to finish of this remarkable story
young Mr. Astor has apparently been
the only man amons the lot who takes
toward women that attitude of chiv-
airy and devotion for -which Americans
are noted.
For several years Mrs. Dray ton has
lived abroad, quietly and unostenta
tiously, biding: her time. She has
known what was her mother's dearest
ambition, and comprehending perfect
ly the amazing tact, patience and dip
lomacy back of it, has been quite con
tent to leave her future in Mrs. Astor's
hands.
Last summer Mrs. Astor made the
first attempt to carry society by storm
for her daughter. Mrs. Drayton visit
ed her mother at Newport and was
seen constantly driving with Mrs. As
tor.
It was well understood in Newport
society that any one who tabooed Mrs.
Drayton would be persona non grata
to the lady who has so long wielded
the scepter of leadership.
But Bociety was shy.
Mrs. Drayton was not received with
open arms in Newport. Mrs. Astor
gave a superb luncheon, to which the
"howling swells" were invited. Seve
ral people went, not knowing they were
to meet Mrs. Drayton.
It Ifl said that many were very In
dignant when they discovered that the
lady was receiving with her mother. In
deed it is even whispered that one or
air is full of frost. Fine specimens of
mallard and teal and a few canvasbacks
have been brought in during the week by
the enthusiastic sportsmen.
Thursday mnrniiiÃ & coaching party

Misses Davis of Oakland, 11. C. Perkins
and Miss G. W. Perkins of Morristown.
New Jersey, Miss Claire Whitmoyer ot
Pasadena find L. R Waller ot Blooms

drive to the old Carmel Mission. The.
day was tine and bracingly cold, and the.
entire drive was greatly enjoyed by all.
This was the first coaching party of the
Dew year. _
The Raymond excursion from Boston
that is expected to arrive here about the
2>th will mark the real beginning of the
annual inllux of Eastern winter tourists,
although there have been many Eastern
people here for the pnst two months.
The orchestra will probably come down
from San Francisco before the close of
January to remain permanently.
Some of the past week's arrivals are:
Howard W. Bray, John Hammom

- E. Faw, Mrs. Samuel Bess
Miss Smith. San Francisco; B. J. Thomp
son and wife, New Westminster, B. C;
two very Important people left sudden
ly and in great anger.
Mrs. Astor was manifestly convinced
that the hour had not struck for her
gr.-at cefup. So this modern feminine'
Napoleon accepted tho repulse grace
fully and fell back with small loss.
But she was not conquered. Invin
cible and skillful, she at once set about
her plans for another campaign. Never
did she falter In her determination;
never did she lay down her weapons.
On December 17, 1897. Mrs. Astor's
forces were strengthened. Mrs. Cole-
man Drayton was married in St. Co
lumbia's Church, London, to George
Haig, a wealthy whisky merchant
Not more than thirty people were
present, but all fashionable and fam
ous. After a wedding trip to Paris
and Nice Mr. *and Mrs. Haig came to
New York.
Mrs. Astor decided that it was now
time to move on the enemy's works.
With masterly generalship she planned
a superb dinner for her daughter and
her new son-in-law.
To this dinner were bidden the most
exclusive of the inner circle of that so
ciety over which Mrs. Astor holds
sway.
P.ut it remained for Mrs. Astor to
forever settle her daughter's place in
her world through the tacit indorse
ment which unquestionably was given
to Mrs. Ha!g*B rentree, not alone by
the presence of the Bishop of the Dio
cese of New York, but also by that
of his wife.
So last week with music and flowers
and golden plate and glittering crystal,
wiU ripples of melodious laughter ami
soft murmurs of congratulation, with
all the gentle arts of peace, and with
out the sound of a single gun, Mrs.
Astor captured society for her daugh
ter, Mrs. Augusta Haig of London.

The Woman Bull Fighter of Spain Is Now
Thrilling the People of Venezuela,.
SENORITA LAURA LOPEZhas
left Seville, Spain, to kill the
great, fierce bulls of Venezuela,
officiated the other day at
the Circo, before a tremendous
crowd, and the grace and fin
ish of her performance put to
shame the efforts of her male rivals.
Such an exhibition of woman's pluck
and skill Caracas had never before -wit
nessed. She is the idol of the hour.
Arriving: shortly after 3 o'clock, -we
had found ourselves among the first
who were clamorously anxious to gain
admission. Frantic efforts to reach the
box office, in which we were finally suc
cessful, secured us seats upon the
shady side of the arena at a cost of
bolivares each (about SO cents).
"We were seated at the left of the box
of the President and of the stand of
the National Military Band, which is
situated just above and in the rear of
the President's box. As fast as human
ity could crush Itself into a given space,
"the all" of Caracas Beemed beehiving
Into this palace of pastime. The grand
circle, which I learned stated 7000, was
quickly filled, and soon a surging mass
of humanity was struggling for the

passages in the rear of the auditorium.
Our early arrival enabled us to thor
oughly appreciate the costumes of the
'. ere now rapidly filling
the boxes, and whose somber robes in
the early portion of the day had chal
lenged our more serious admiration.
The military band, which had now
arrived, saluted the assembled multi
tude with the national hymn. The ar
rival of each woman, attired in a rich
Parisian robe, as she took her seat In
a box, was greeted with rounds of ap
plause and approbation by the other
spectators, who by this time were thor
oughly in the amusement spirit. The
arrival of the Governor and party, who
occupied the box of the President, was
hailed with a salute from the band.
Promptly at 4 o'clock, at a signal
from the Governor, the trumpets of the
herald sounded. Two massive â¢
leading Into the arena were thrown
open as by magic, and the famous band
of Spanish bull fighters made a i
entrance, amid the deafening applause
of more than 8000 admirers, which com
\- drowned the salute of the mili
tary band.

RED CROSS FOUNDER
DYING IN POVERTY.
In Heiden workhouse, In the canton of
Appenzell, Switzerland, Henry Dunnant,
the founder of the International Red
Cross Society, Is passing the closing
hours of his useful life. His mind Is
impaired, and symptoms of insanity
have appeared, so that It Js doubtful
whether he will ever know that it was
to him that the International Medical
Congress, held at Moscow a few weeks
ago, unanimously awarded Its prize as
to "the man who has done the greatest
service to humanity and medicine In
the present age."
Some years ago an announcement of
Dunnant's destitute condition aroused
universal astonishment and painful
surprise, which were only set â¢â <â '
when a statement was published to the
that the Dowager Empress of j
Russia had settled upon him an annu
ity sufficiently large to enable him to
end his days in comfort and peace, j
Unfortunately these good intentions of i
the <"/-arina do not appear to have ma- j
tefialixed, or else the money which sh<*
intended for the founder of the .Red i
Cross has been diverted and misappro- J
priated by those intrusted with Its
transmission. This often happens in
Russia, and it is the exception rather
than the rule when a gift from any
member of the imperial house reaches j
its destination. â New York Tribune.

To some women the chemise is the

while others never wear it. The latter
substitute the corset cover and short

The newest styles are called the Dl

HINTS FOR BUSY HOUSEWIVES
THE wise housekeeper Is the one who
is ever on the alert for the I
tions which shall help t.. make the
wheels of her house run smoothly.
To wash a glass from which milk has
been poured plunge first into cold
water before putting it into warm. The
same rule holds good with egg cups
or spoons from which eggs have been
eaten.
The quality of water may be tested |
by putting about a pint into a clear
glass bottle with a stopper. Add to
it a few grains of white lump sugar,
and expose the bottle in a light, warm
room for ten days. If the water then
has a thick or discolored appearance
it is impure and not fit for drinking
purposes. It is unwise to allow drink
ing water to run through lead pipes.
When fastening a glove always but
ton the second button first. This re
moves the strain from the wrist button.
Never pull at the finger ends when re
moving gloves. Draw them wrong side
out from, the wrist, and allow them to
remain until thoroughly cooled before
turning them again. Do not roll gloves
into a ball; always spread them out flat j
and draw the fingers into shape. Dark
gloves have the effect of diminishing
while light ones increase the apparent
size of the hand.
Coffee stains may be removed from
table linen by pouring boiling water
over the stained portions. Subsequent

pointed. She advanced to the center
of the arena. A hush â till as death
fell over the multitude. All expected
that somi violent action was to take
place and many feared that her abil- !
ity to kill was wanting. I glanced at
her just as the crowd commenced to
call her name, and I noticed her face
blanched before the ordeal. Neverthe
less she showed no signs of fear as she
walked to the center of the arena and !
calmly awaited the first charge -* the
calmly awaited the flirst charge of the
bull. Armed only with a bright col- ;
ored cloak she advanced toward him
with a firm step. He charged the rag j
and she dexterously dodged his on- |
slaught.
This action brought forth a round of
applause and a call for the banderillas.
A male admirer handed down two
beautiful ones. They were taken to her
by Potoco, who, bowing to her as he
presented them, had just time to get a
short distance away before the bull
charged again, and received both ban- i
derillas well back in the neck, delivered
with great coolness and precision from
the hands of the woman.
Then the bull tore about the arena,
scattering the picadorea like partridges.
Running to the side, Laura Lopez re
ceived her sword and scarlet mantle
and was again on the aggressive. There
was a short space of silence as she
slowly raised her sword, the bull charg
ing as she did so straight for the cloth.
Her aim was true, but her strength
lacking. Although the flesh was pierc
ed the sword was wrenched from her
hands and carried several feet by the
bull in the wound she had inflicted be
fore it fell to the ground and was re
covered. Wild with delight at this sec
ond act the crowd fairly rained hats '

The density of eggs decreases as they
grow old. If a new-laid egg is placed
in a pint of water into which two
ounces of salt are dissolved it will im
mediately fall to the bottom. One laid
the previous day will float a short dis
tanco from the bottom. An egg three
days old will remain half way down the
vessel containing the liquid, and a still
older one will float on top. The surface
of fresh eggs is like lime, that of stale
eggs has a glossy appearance.
If you have a Btrip of fine fur and
know not what else to do with it, work
it in as a vest to your best street gown,
or a pair of cuffs, as fur cuffs and
vests are counted as very smart. It
takes a long purse to afford a whole
fur Jacket, but a smart little vest, col
lars and cuffs are luxuries within
reach of the many.
A subdued shade of peacock blue,
plum color and olive green, with black,
of course, are announced as the colors
under which flesh seems least ostenta
tious, while WedgAvood blue, pale
gray and almost any shade of red are
to be avoided sedulously. Mauve and
the higher tints of green are the two
colors that, in decoration about the
throat and shoulders are especially
helpful in diminishing the effect of
flesh.
There Is perhaps no other city in the
world which spends as much money
on little, useless frivolities as Paris.
There are no women in the world who
surround, smother and burden them
selves with the amount or number of
toilet accessories as the French
women. A stranger walking through
one of the big department stores like
the Bon Marche will be struck forcibly
with this fact. They will see there a
thousand gaudyâ l nearly said tawdry
â things, the use of half of which they
cannot even divine. They are all color
and paste and feathers and rags, silks
and fringe and linen and lace, mock
jewels and brushes and combs and po
mades, perfumes and savons and pow
ders "and braids, until the head turns
giddy and the heart sick with the
sights and the sounds.
If a woman undertook to make prac- I
tlcal use of all these devices, from her |
bath out to the putting on of the last j
scrap of lace or knot of ribbon, she !
would be obliged to give up all her
time to it and would need several
maids besides. She would have no time
left for the cultivation of her mind,
or for earning a living:, par example,
say nothing of having Christmas days
and other days to give to making j
others happy.
To begin with the morning ablu
tions. There are at least a aozen sorts
of washrags of different web and
weave, for various times of day and
for the separate members of the body.
Then the decoctions to be put Auto the
water are practically limitless â chemi
cals to make it soft, antiseptics, bags
of medicinal herbs, powders and per
fumes. Afterward come a line of po
made? and perfumes and rice powders,
etc. For the hair, for the teeth, for
the feet and for the hands there are
special and branch treatments, each
a master treatise in itself and requir
ing a kit of tools and an expert work
man.
The French woman has more kinds
of combs and crimpers and hair orna
ments for her hair than her American
cousin has ever dreamed of. These
things form a display in the big shops
worthy of space at the exposition of
1900.
Under the general head of collars
and neck ornaments comes a list of
articles long enough to fill a catalogue.
It is, in fact, in her neck ornaments
especially that the French woman can
always be distinguished wherever she
is. And if a man here were in doubt
what to buy a woman for a Christmas
present he could safely buy some one
of the thousand concoctions of ribbons
and silk and lace and not make a mis
take, that Is, if the woman was
French. The American woman doesn't
take so kindly, especially at first, to
.Marie Antoinette fichus, collarettes of
accordion-plaited silk and fluffy af
fairs of ribbon and lace. She wears her
street gowns plain, with perhaps a
brocade at the throat or a plain linen
collar and a bow. And her matinee
gowns are made with fancy collars, so
she has no need for these extra chemi
zettes of lace which slip and slide from
place to place.
A French woman always wears a bit
of lace linked about her throat some
where. If it is not in her dress she
will put it inside the collar of her
cloak or cape, with a bright piece of
ribbon or velvet. Just now feather
boas of all colors, real or imaginary,
are being much worn. A color to
match the dress or the hat is consid
ered chic. They are worn long or
short, generally in accordance with
the pocketbook of the owner.

CRUISE OF THE CALIFORNIA.
XSynopsls of rr<Tf-<l,nK chapters: Binnie has
been carried off, a captive, by the chief of
the Skull Hunters. Kemona, the Austra
lian "bashman," who was one of the crew
of the yacht California, is following Bin
nie, at a safe distance, hoping to rescue
him. At the same time the California, hav
ing on board a native enemy of the chief
- of the Skull Hunters as a guide. Is on the
â¢way to carry war into the country of the
Skull Hunters, which lies along the banks
. of the Marwise River and in the Skull
- Mountains.]
CHAPTER XII.
"Faster," said the chief of the Skull
Hunters.
At the v.-ord his black followers
quickened their pace into a dog trot,
â¢dragging their captive with them.
31nnie was fastened by a stout thong
(to a native chief, who had been treach
erously made a prisoner by Grhoor
â Ghee-Tee. Th<--Â«.- two were at the head
of a long line of prisoners who were
tied together tun by two. Slaves of
Ghoor-Ghee-Tee beat them with rods
to hasten their steps.
All night they had marched through
a dease forest, wading thr>'Ugh streams,
climbing over the trunks of fallen
and o-ver bouldt-rs, falling often in the
darkness, but ever urged on by the
voice of Ghoor-Ghee-Tee and by the
Mows dealt by the slaves. Tmringit all
not a cry was uttered by any of the
eavage captives. PJinnie was as brave
and stoical as they and gained the
favor of the native chi^f, to whom he
"was tied, by helping him to rise when
he had fallen and one of his feet was
fast between r<-<'ks. For this Binnie
Teceived several blows because he
stopped, but he bore them without
flinching.
Often, as they crossed streams, they
â wakened crocodiles that were Bleeping
in the mud. once a crocodile snapped
Its Jaws close to Binnie, but the spear
of a slave was thrust into the monster's
throat with the speed of a flash. Pois
onous Berpents were surprised in the
forest and crawler] away hissing. Still
â¢the march was kept on. Now the Skull
Hunters and the prisoners reached the
Fummit of a hill and the slaves beat,
the prisoners until they ran at the top
of their speed. The night was almost
gone. Ahead was an open, rolling
plain. Ghoor-Ghee-Tee wished to cross
this and enter the forest that lay be
yond before day, for he feared that the
â white men might be pursuing and see
his party in the open.
There was no white man near. But
as Ghoor-Ghee-Tee came into the open
a blaok man nimbly climbed a tall tree
that stood beside the newly made trail
and. screened by the branches, looked
â with keen eyes, in silence, across the
plain. Kemona was counting the sav
ages. There were between fifty and
sixty, including the savage prisoners
and Binnie. The captors and captives
â¢were about evenly divided.
"Good." said Kemona, "it will not be
a desperate chance to rescue Binnie if
the other prisoners will fight. Let me
Bee how my arsenal gets along."
He drew to view a big war club,
â with which, on the cruise of the Cali
fornia, he had amused himself, hollow
ing It out in places and neatly fitting
hack the outside, so- that the club seem
od to be solid. From the secret places
he drew forth four revolvers, which he
carefully examined.
"They are all ricrht," he said, "and
so is the ammunition. Two pistols for
Binnie and two for Kemona and plenty
of cartridges for that party. But how
is my knife?" Kemona gave another
BOYS` AND GIRLS` PAGE
proof of his Ingenuity by unscrewing
the small end of the club and pulling
out a long knife that had a blade like
a razor's edge.
"It Is all right," said Kemona, "the
knife will cut the ropes and may come
handy for other use. We are not as
helpless as we seem, although there are
only two of us. Now, I will just take a
little nap in this tree and not show my-
S'-lf." i^i saying, the Australian fas
tened his precious club to a "branch,
picked out two limbs to lie upon and
slept until the sun was far toward the
close of the day.
\\'h*-n Kemona again started to fol
low the trail he ran across the open
plain like a deer. Plunging into the
f<-r< st on the other side, he still made
rapid headway. No Mohawk Indian
could have traced his game more cer
tainly, when chasing bears or wolves,
than Kemona now showed. He was
never at a loss. Mile after mile he ran,
and he looked pleased, for he knew that
while (;hnor-i;hee-Tee might run all
one night and the next day, he must
stop that nieht somewhere.
"So to-night." he said. "I will save
Binnie or all will be lost."
Just at dark Kemrma came to a
broad, swift stream, which Ghoor-Ghee-
T"e and his slaves and captives had
crossed.
"This ptrpnm," said Kemona, "flows
to the ICarwise. I will take my chance
floating down with it."
With his sharp knife he vigorously
attacked a log- which lay near the edge
nf thr> Btream and soon hollowed out
the middle (ft it so that It would se
curely h<ild his war dub and its con
tents. Then he Found some bet'i lei
and ground nuts, which he ate eager
ly, fur he was very hungry. He finish
ed his meal with a drink of water from
the stream and then lay down and
waited until darkness came. He th^n
pushed his log- out from the bank and
drifted down with the stream.
Faster and faster ran the water Rnd
Kemona thouerht that he was ap
proaching rapids. Another stream
joined with the one on which he was
floating and the two made quite a
river. The roar of rushing water? came
to Kemona's ears.
"Not rapids, but a waterfall," he
muttered to himself.
"With great difficulty he managed to
reach one bank of the river, where the
stream sharply turned. At once he
hauled his log up on the bank and be
iran to look about. The dull sound of
the falling water told him that the
waterfall was high. He could feel the
earth trembl<- under his feet.
"Through the forest then," he paid.
He found out that the foresi could
not be penetrated. Thorn bushes of
great size, armed with spikes as dan
gerous as bayonets, stood close to
gether up and down thÂ« river banks
for miles and made a barrier through
which nothing but a snake could pass.
To leap an unknown waterfall in the
dark! Possibly to be torn to pieces on
sharp jagged stones, amid the rushing
Und strangling waters! Perhaps, after
all, to be able to safely pass over the
waterfall and the dizzy whirlpool be
low, only to be disabled in sight if the
camp where Binnie was, and so unable
to rescue him after all! Be it to the
credit of Kemona that this thought
troubled him more than the danger.
('limbing a tree close to the edge of
the river Kemona saw that which de
cided him to go on, whatever the peril
might be.
THE BUMPKINS RIDING TO A HOT FINISH ON THE BACKS OF THE PARK DONKEYS.
THE SAN FBAJNCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, J A .XT' ART 16, 1899.
Far below gleamed the light of a
camp fire. Around it were dancing
dusky savages, waving clubs and a<t-
Ing ferociously. Had Ghoor-Ghee-Tee
brought his captives here to kill them
and take possession of their skulls":
Was Blnnie In immediate danger? Be
low was the roaring river, breaking
â¢white and threatening on the bowlders
in its course. Above the sound of the
river was the booming of the waterfall,
rising like the noise of a great battle
( f artillery. Hut not one instant more
Kemona hesitated.
The river waves raced by Kemona
like white-maned war horses as he
once more plunged in with his log. The
dusky forest trees on the river banks
looked like huge, black giants and
seemed to rush madly by as the water
bore him on faster and faster. The
log struck v with terrific force against
bowlders, whirled dizzily around and
around, and then swept on again like
a doomed ship going into the breakers.
Such shocks nearly stunned the Aus
tralian, but he held on. Other logs
i by him. grazing his feet and
hands and threatening to strike him off
ititn the water; the bowlders tore his
lirsh. Faithful through all he held on
and disdained to try to swim ashore
and save himself. He -would get to
; Binnie or die.
The thundor of the waterfall grew
deafening. The log glided ov<
stretch of smooth, glistening water
and th^n gave a fearful, sickening
leap down, down, down, surrounded
by flying, blindine foam, down â seem
ingly to the middle of the earth. A
black Bpot ir the whirlpool below th*>
mierhty fall darted here and there, was
raised on hi- ' waves and sank below
them. Finally, throutrh a channel
strewn with rocks, the black spot was
floated Into smooth water below. It
drifted rapidly down past the camp
of the savages. It was the lop with
Kemona, weak and half drowned,
clinging desperately to it.
An hour's rest on shore and Kemo
na was himself again. Taking in hand
his war club he walked carefully to
ward the camp
"Now to rescue Binnie," he said to
himself. It must be done to-night.

SURPRISED
BY A BABY.
Jehnnie Is a dear little boy who has
\ t'.ir rf his four short years of
life out on a big ranch with his father
and mother. There has always been a
Chinese servant in the kitchen to help
his mother, and one or two men about
to help h:s father, but there have never
been any neighbors to come in and be
sociable evenings, and Johnnie has bad
no little boys and girls to play with
at all. When he was three years old
one of the men who worked for his
father before, came back, and brought
With him a pretty puppy with black,
curly hair and big bro-wn eyes, and
gave him to the lonely littl" boy, and
from that moment Johnnie and Star â
for that was the name that he gave
his pct â became almost inseparable.
Star grew much faster than his small
master did, and was soon so- large that
lUld not manage him at all except
by coaxing (which is really the best
way to manage anyone when you come
to think of it), but the two were the
very best of friends, and were together
almost every moment of the time that
Johnnie was awake. Indeed, when, in
the long, hot summer days the little
boy, tired with play and with running
about, would fall asleep in the shade
of the porch, he was pretty sun- to
have Star's shaggy side for a pillow,
and Star's eyes would come open with
a snap, and he would growl most sav
agely, if anyone came near to disturb
their mutual slumbers.
The big dog had been Johnnies con
stant companion and playmate and
faithful friend for a whole long twelve
month when some news came from the
Fast that made the grown people of
the family very happy indeed. John
nies aunt, Annie, wrote to them say
ing that her husband and she had de
cided to come to California and take
up a near-by claim which Johnnies
father had written them about. John

not understand, for her sister said that
she was going to bring a "surprise"
Â«l<>ng with her which she was sure
would delight them all; and what that
surprise was to be kept them busy
guessing, until the time actually came
for Johnnies father to take the big
ranch wagon and go down to the near
est town after the new-comers.
It took him a whole day to po and
another to come back. and. because of
the load that he broupht, the coming-

UPON A LOG.
back day was a very long one indeed,
so long that although Johnnie tried his
bent to keep awake, ha fell asleep and
never knew a thing about his visitors
until the next morning. Then, when
he came in from his usual morning run
with Star, the door of the Fitting-room,
which had been turned into a bedroom
for the time being* was open and a
strange young man and woman called
him inside and kissed him and praised
Star until Johnnie thought that an
uncle and aunt were very nice things
to have indeed.
Presently his mother and father came
In, too, and then as Johnnie sat in his
aunt's lap it occurred to him to ask
about that wonderful something about
which he had been puzzling his curly
head for weeks.
Everybody laughed when he asked
the timid question, but his aunt put
him down and went over to the bed.
She took a bundle out of it and came
and sat down again and began to un
wrap it, while Star and Johnnie stood
and watched her with silent curiosity.
And such a queer thing as it was which
she uncovered! Johnnie was a pretty
brave little boy for his size, but he had
never in his life seen anything which
looked to him quite so mysteriously
dreadful.
It was a queer, shapeless, alive thing,
with a lumpy body and bits of short
arms, and a long white skirt which
apparently covered long, limp legs
which reached clear to the floor. It
had a big, white, bald head and flaring
ears, and black eyes, and no neck at
all, and instead of teeth it had a terri
fying show of empty red gums. It was
a "surprise" in truth, for poor Johnnie
had never seen anything of the kind in
all his lifp, and he had not the slight
est idea that it was a baby â and a very
nice little baby, too â which his aunt
was showing him.
He was so frightened that he Just
stood and stared until the strange
creature suddenly wrinkled up its face,
shut its eyes tight and turning a deep
crimson opened its empty mnuth wide
and began to scream with all its might.
And then what do you suppose John
nit- and Star did? Star growled and
put his tall between his legs, and then
he and Johnnie, who was too alarmed
to think of anything but hiding, went
under the bed together and stayed
there, too. until the baby stopped cry
ing and Johnnies mamma made him
understand that it was a dear fittle
ctmsin that his aunt had brought him,
and that everybody looked like that
when they were tiny babies.
BERKELEY BOYS A'GYPSYING.
Over In Berkeley are three or four
small boys, the oldest of whom is 10,
who have actually built a house and
are attempting to cook their own
meals, or some of them. Their menu
takes in steaks, mushes, rice and per

they prepare in good style, at a brick

and their meals are eaten in the house
with genuine relish.
The house is provided with only one

TALE OF THREE BROTHERS.
Robert, Richard and Ray were three
brothers. One day they found them
selves in a great garden, passing
through a gateway of flowers, with
laughter such as belongs only to youth*
to reach the garden. Just within the
shadow of the gateway they met a
lady, who said that her name was Des
tiny, and that she had come to direct
them upon their paths through the gar
den.
"Only a little way on," said the lady,
"you will find the gifts that I have
placed there for you. Take them and
go upon your ways as bravely as you
can."
*he lady then told the brothers to
stand side by side, Ray in the middle
and Robert and Richard on either side.
"March!" she said.
The three brothers found that their
paths led farther and farther apart.
They called aloud, from time to time,
words of brotherly love and good cheer
until their voices were lost by distance.
Then, separately, they went their ways
in silence.
Robert found his prize first â an ap
ple of solid gold. He plucked it gladly.
Richard next found his prize â a scar
let plume, to lead him to fame. With
this Richard marched on with swelling
pride. Ray's pathway soon grew poor
and mean. The trees shriveled up, the
flowers dried and sparkling springs of
water ceased to flow. He came to a
wretched little house. In it was a
package upon which was his name and
the inscription. "The Solace of Want."
He opened the package and found in
it only a poor, ragged coat. Ray put
on the coat with a sigh and moved on.
Robert's path soon led him into a !
great and wealthy city. There he was \
welcomed. There, after a time, he en
tered into a rich mansion, which con
tained many pictures, which was car
peted with satin and in which were
dishes and vessels of pure gold. Here
Robert lived many years, and he mar
ried the daughter of a great prince, j
who brought him much money. But
he was never happy, for the apple of
gold always urged him on, and naught
of peace or rest had he.
A CLOCK PUZZLE.
The clock struck one! A mouse ana a rat
Were playing under an old straw hat.
They heard the machinery clucking: and wheezing:,
And the dust from the clock case set both of them sneezing.
In the clock they ran, aid the old clock door
Shut with a slam that Joggled the floor.
Then the springs, cogs and hammers, as if In mad spite.
Hit the rat and the mouse from the left and the right.
Little boy, little girl, now please guess â Just for fun â
Ifvthe crazy old clock then struck two, or struck one!
Richard placed his plume in his hat.
His pathway led up a steep mountain,
above which eagles screamed, as they
wheeled in dizzy circles. On the sum
mit of the mounatin Richard looked
around. He saw sunny valleys below
him. in which were growing crops, vil
lages and cities, schoolhouses and
churches, and the people in the valleys
all seemed to be friendly and happy.
Richard paused not, but placed a
trumpet to his lips and blew a long,
resounding blast. The sound was heard
in the valleys and the effect was magi
cal. People dropped their rakes and
pruning knives in the fields and or
chards. Those in the cities gathered
into armies and soon, upon a wide
plain, a glittering host was assembled.
Bands of music were there; squadrons
of horsemen, with shining swords in
their hands: hundreds of cannons and
thousands of men with guns in their
hands.
Over the multitude waved flags. The
soldiers cheered as Richard, riding a
black horse and wearing a gay uniform,
came among them. He was known al
ready as the great general who had
called the soldiers together and at his
command great battles were to be
fought and won, that he might gain
fame.
At the head of his army Richard
drove in a whirlwind of dust, through
towns and cities which had been set
on fire by the torches of his soldiery;
and he heard, on all sides, the shrieks
and curses of those who had been
brought to woe and ruin by him.
In his greatest battle there rode up
toward Richard, from the ranks of the
enemy, a gray-haired horseman, who
looked so like Richard that the soldiers
murmured as they saw him. RoTTert
and the gray-haired horseman fought.
At last Richard struck down his an
tagonist, who rolled in the dust and
was trampled under the iron hoofs of
his own horse.
Then and there, in sight of his
own soldiers, while cheers were in the
air and artillery thundered, Richard
broke his sword in two and rode from
the field of battle, with bowed head,
and sobbing, for the gray-haired
horseman whom he had struck down
was his father.
Ray wandered along ways that were
strewn with thorns. Rich men and
rich women and even the children of
the rich laughed at the ragged coat
and at the wearer, but Ray would not
take It off. Poor men and â women and
poor children heard with joy of his
coming. He found gold, only to scat
ter it, with generous hands, among the
needy. He sat by the bedside of the
sick. He spoke gentle words of com
fort to those in sorrow.
Every day he prized his rapped coat.
He had found a writing in one of the
pockets and so had learned the secret
of it. Every day he grew braver, more
patient and more loving. "While he was
very sorry for all who were in trouble,
he was still happy, for destiny had
given him the coat of love to wear as
a garment.
He envied no one. And, as for fight
ing any one for the sake of fame, that
was impossible for him.
After very many days the three
brothers met once more. Robert and
Richard had anxious looks and often
sighed. Only Ray could smile as joy
ously as they had all smiled when
they began their journey together.
Robert still clung to his apple of gold
and Richard valued his plume. But
Ray tore his coat Into three pieces,
gave each of his brothers one, saving
the poorest piece for himself. He had
grown into the habit of loving so that
he could spare a part of the coat.
Of course this is a fable. The gar
den is the world. They who journey
through it loving their fellows can
smile in poverty, while the envious
and the ambitious are never satisfied,
even when they have much.
An old beggar, who used to frequent
the doors of one of the principal
churches of Rome, died lately. He was
found to be possessed of Â£37,000. which

MAN FROM MEXICO,
AND OTHER PERSONS.
The man who will not laugh at Wil

thing to think about in the fact that

weeks, and will !><> for weeks more, giv

ing playgoer to this siege of farce it is

fuch as. we have now at the Baldwin.
I put my admiration of "The Man from
Mexico" to the testâ l went to see him
twice within the week; and the second
time, as the first, I laughed myself al
most into tears. There are some comic
Shows that drive the critics to kind
words. He laughs, realizing that he
Who laughs leaves criticism behind, and
then he sits him dr-wn at his desk and
apologizes for having had a good time â
says he hasn't much idea what It was
all about, but it was certainly quick
and funny, and he and everybody else
laughed, and if you have any taste for
this sort of entertainment, and are not
too exacting, it will divert you, too,
maybe.
The beauty of Willie Collier and this
farce is that a man may enjoy them
till he aches, build panegyrics columns
high to their comic charms, and still
preserve unsoiled conscience and un
humbled pride.
â¢ â¢ â¢
I would not belittle the Importance
of Farce, which is one of the immor
tal parts of the theater, but nowadays
most which passes for that is entirely
something less. "The Man from Mex
ico." I should say, is a farce. It does
rot ele\ate its class, as Oscar Wilde's
elegant exaggerations do; nor devote
Jtself as industriously to a deliberate
scheme of action as do some of the
pieces that are made in France. It is a
very difficult piece to place. You might
Bay its p^h^mr" Is more conversational
than Bituatlonai. because the actual in
cident is limited, and the most of the
time taken up with vagrom dialogue.
There are to be reckoned with, on the
ether hand, those verbal situations
which are the direct outcome of the
seemingly irrespective dialogue, and
which play such an important part in
the comic interest. It is difficult even
to place the authorship of the piece. I
have the word of several playgoers
that the basis of the plot has long since
terved in French and in English farces,
and an honest man, who knows, tells
me that the ludicrous climax r r f the
prison scene is not written by Dv
S'.uchet at all, but is solely the inven
tion of Collier. I said last week that
it would be a hard matter to determine
where Dv Pouchet's work ends and
Collier's begins. Still, I cannot see Mr.
Collier to the point where he even ef
faces Dv Souchet's name from the pro
gramme.
â¢ â¢ â¢
However, the parentage of "The Man
from -Mexico" is not a vital question.
It is the piece in performance that we
pure applauding, and Mr. Collier attends
ito it that he is all of that, and the
/world is gayer because of him. I doubt
if there is any one, even among his
associate actors, whrr grudges him a
single line, or a single moment of the
center of the stage. The part of Ben
ba Fitzhugh is so written that he
must be the play. There is no alter
nativeâit is Collier or nothing. The
star is not unconscious of his central
ization, and, moreover, he knows how
to get the fullest value from his back
ground. His scheme of acting his own
part is the best and the only one feasi-
ble to this fareÂ». He la seemingly un
aware of his audience and his own com
icality, or as n^-ar it as a man can be,
while throwing off gags and puns and
catch lines at the rate of a dozen to
the minutn. In more legitimate farce,
â¢where there are no gag lines, an actor,
to be funny, has only to present a se
rious countenance to the circum
stances which overwhelm him; but the
backbone of this piece is verbal play
and a touch too much c-f unconscious-
ness would Buggest a comedian in a
trance. What Mr. Collier does is to
give to the part as much legitimacy
as it will stand for, and not a bit more,
lie is deliberately quiet and repressed;
he presents fin the first act) the ap
pearance of a respectable, red-headed,
suburban person, with an arch taste in
clothes: he has an anxious, worried
look accented by spectacles â and out of
this modest picture and gentle demean
or whirls a perpetual cyclone of Amer
ican gags. The lncongruousness of it
points the fun. And then he makes a
tremendous effect of the contrast be
tween himself and the rest of the com-
pany. He is all earnestness and repose;
Hey Hey play in the loud, hustling key of
conventional farce-comedy. He never
goes into the painful details of any
j .k>\ or anything else; he relies on the
subtleness of suggestion; he is perfect

in the act, he gives the suspense to.

the Yankee camp. The hero's life is
spared only on condition that during
the father's life he and the heroine
shall neither see nor communicate
with one another. The gallant captain

All the Morocco favorites are in the

and Petruchio," knowing that West End
audiences had had no chance of seeing
Miss Ada Rehan and being desirous of
making his production as artistically
notable ns possible, Mr. Tree invited the
charming American actress to appear
with him at Her Majesty's. The terms
have not been hitherto divulged, bvit I
believe I am betraying no confidence In
Raying that Miss Rehan was offered a
salary of Â£ioo a week for a play lasting
some fifty minutes.
His offer was declined, ostensibly on
the ground that other arrangements had
been entered into which would preclude
Miss Rehan from appearing in London
after the conclusion of her engagement
at Islington. To the ordinary unohser
vant playgoer the attitude of Mr. Tree
would suggest chivalry and an unselfish
love of artistic excellence; but how false
that conclusion would be is seen from Mr.
Daly's expression of opinion, reserved
until he is once more in America.
"I could not have considered it pos
sible." says Mr. Daly, "that Mr. Tree
would send me such an unmanagerial,
coolly insulting proposition as to separate
Miss Rehan from her companions and
ask her to descend to play in an emascu
lated version of Shakespeare's play, af
ter she had established her renown in
the production in which she is dlntin
guished."
It is indeed news that an offer to star
at the finest theater in London at a very
remunerative salary, and backed by a
singularly efficient company, is to be
construed into a "coolly insulting propo-
Bition."
\\ hen Sir Henry Irving placed the
Lyceum, with himself, Miss Terry and
the whole resources of the theater at the
command of Edwin Booth, after the lat
ter had failed at the Princess with his
own company, we all applaudedâ and
rightly soâ the generosity of the pro
ceeding.
Must we then be instructed on these
matters by a gentleman whose principle
in "William Archer's words, is that
"Shakespeare may think himself hick?
if he gets his words spoken at all, and
must not be too particular as to who
happens to speak them"; who tacked or
the epilogue from '-Henry VIII" to "The
Two Gentlemen of Verona"; who threat
ened us with a production of the two
parts of "Henry IV" jumbled into one
and whose version of "The School for
Scandal" was bowdlerised to the point of
the ridiculous.

"Sherlock Holmes" Is being dramatized

Those Interminable croakers who are

Brahms was once in his favorite bier
haus in Vienna with a friend. He said
to the landlord, "Bring me a bottle of
your best." The landlord returned,
"Here is wine, as much better than other
wine as Brahms' music is than other
music." Brahms looked at the label with
his near-sighted eyes, and said "Put it
away; give us a bottle of Bach."
San Francisco is included in this year's

The reports that come from Rome
about the poet, novelist, dramatist and
industrious self-advertiser, Annunzio, are
bewildering. With the help of "capital"
and royalty, he is about to realize a
poet's dream and build a temple of dra
matic art. with which trade and commero
shall have nothing to do. He has lus
had one new play, "A Spring Mornini
Dream," acted, and another, "The Dear!
City," is in rehearsal In Paris and Rome.
Two other new plays, "Iron" and
"Laura," are finished in manuscript. He
is writing, simultaneously, five new nov-
I els, each one taking the name of a flower.
At the same time his genius is devoting
I itself to the composition of three mys
teriesâ "Persephone," "Adonis" and "Or-
I pheus."
In Boston the Ammergauan Passion
Play is being: projected by the cinemato
graph. It will be exhibited in Augustin
Daly's New York Theater during the
Lenten season.
The new Sardou play, which is about
to be produced in Paris, deals with the
history of Louis XVII, and is called
"Pamela la Marchande de Frivolites."
Both Napoleon and Josephine are of the
characters, and Mme. Rejane and a little
12-year-old actress are prominent in the
cast.
The latest and wildest enterprise in the
show business is credited to Henry B.
Clifford, a Chicago manager, wno is
going to send an dpera company of 125
around the v.-orld. giving performances
in a large canvas tent.
A new role for Miss Rehan will be Gil
berte in "Frou-Frou," which play Mr.
Daly is soon to present.

THE Tompkins Observation School
of Oakland has been so desig
nated because some three years
ago it was given over by the
Board of Education to the direc
tion of the Pedagogical Department of
the State University. Of this depart
ment Dr. Elmer E. Brown is head, and
Professors Bailey and Dresalar are as
sociates.
The purpose of this change vu to
revise from time to time the course of
Btudy In the Tompkins School, and to
make from month to month a personal
study of the child in his home and
school relations. This Echool is graded,
the ages of the pupils range from
sto 15. Moreover, it is the only public
school in Oakland which contains a
kindergai I
Dr. Bailey has at present the most
immediate connection with the insti
. and In conjunction with the
principal, Edwin Markham, is direct
ing the curriculum and work in the
i as far as the University interest
: With the aid of all the
teachers Dr. Bailey has just completed
a revision of the course of study which
will be put In operation this month.
This will differ from the general work
in the i of Oakland in pos
sessing a more systematic outline of
nature study and a more carefully ar
1 course in literature.
The latti the introduction
of the myth, the fairy tale and the
Bible story into the first, second and
third grades. These r.:v- followed in the
A-fourth with the relation by the
teacher of the story of the "Iliad." In
the B-fourth grade the story of the
"Odyssey" Is told, while in the A-fifth
the pupils read in class the "Iliad."
In the B-fifth they also read the
"Odyssey" in class and then the stories
of chivalry and the Arthurian legends.
Illustrating tho Christian ideal of the
h^ro, are taken up in the A and
B sixth grades. The aim of all this
study is to produce ethical results by
way of comparison. Tn the seventh
grade there follows American litera
ture â the poems of "Hiawatha" and
"Evaner^line" and Hawthorne tales.
For the t-iehth grade The course of
?t -.:â !>- will probably include some suit
able play of Shakespeare, such as "The
Tempest," or "As You Like Tt," or
"Shylock." This gives the pupils a
taste of the great masters of thought
rind feeling in the world.
The work of the past three years in
the Tompkins School, thanks to the
careful supervision of Dr. Bailey and
Principal Markhara. has produced
highly beneficial results. The effect of
this literature study on the characters
of the children has proven exceedingly
ring in every way.

The Installation of the officer* of King Solo

most charming of the several ceremonies of the

who performed the entire work without book,
the only officer who has done so this term In i
this city, and that added much to the lm
pressiveness of the ceremony. She was assisted
by Grand Secretary Kate S. Willats as grand
marshal and James Bestor Merrltt, P. O. P.,
as chaplain, each of whom performed the part
assigned In a most admirable manner, par
ticularly the grand marshal. The music for
the evening was furnished by the King Solo

and assisted by Miss A. W. Hobe. who ren- ]

WHAT PRESIDENT CHILDS THINKS OF INCREASING OUR
NORMAL SCHOOLS.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 1, 1898.
Editor San Francisco Call : Your recent editorial, "A Plethora cf Normal Schools," will,
[ think, receive the indorsement of all who have given this subject much attention. California
loes not need at present more than three rormal schools. The one about to be established in San
Okgo is uncal ed for, and w:ll be, to a censiderab'e extent, a waste of public money. Three
r.ormal schools, well supported by the State, wi I do all the work needed in the training of
'eachers, and very much better work than five or six poorly equipped schools can possibly do.
In the three 1 -rge towns of Los Angeles, San Jose and Chico, in which the three State
Normal schools are located, :ivi g is comparatively cheap â much cheaper than in smalkr towns
isking for normal schools. Parents will not gain iinancially, then, by establishing mor^ scho:ls
irarer home. Students in these large towns have educational advantages outside cf the normal
>chcols that are invaluable.
No other State in proportion to its population is expending so much money for State insti
tutions ani commissions. Aboish some of these commissions, consolidate some cf the State
institutions and enlarge existing State buildings instead of building new ones in ether places.
Taxpayers are justly demanding that our State expenses be greatly reduced.

FIRST AMERICAN PUBLIC SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA.
In December, 1848, the first American public school in California, which had been originally opened In the previous
April by Mr. Marsten, but was closed during the gold excitement of the summer and autumn, reopened and flourished In
the first public school building in the State. This was situated on Portsmouth Square, fronting on Clay street, and was
called the Public Institute. In the same building also, there being as yet no church, Protestant religious worship was con
ducted regularly every Sunday by a minister named T. D. Hunt, whose salary was paid by general subscription.
This old building was also the assembly-room of all the early gatherings of the OJd Fellows, and served as a hall
for all social, political and military meetings. Some years later it became a Court House under Judge Almond, then
degraded to a police station, and was finally demolished In the early fifties.

The speaker then said: "Notwithstanding the

until the Legislature of 1595. that authorized

sixty-two old firemen who are receivine a

out of this but twelve are members of the Ex-
Mnpt Fir" Company.
"The averapf ;i(tf of those who are receiving
alii Is Â«9 v.-ars. The pittance alluded to has,
however, been the means of keeping a num
ber of old firemen out of the Almshouse an.l
saving many of them from a pauper's grave."
Calling attention to the banquet he said: "The
cost of this and other banquets the Exempts
have given of late years has n.>t come out of

At the last annual meeting Joseph
O'Connor was elected president, Miss
Cleveland vice-president, L. A. Jordan
re-elected secretary and Mr. McCarty

The following is a quotation from re
cent circulars sent out to members of
the society:
â¢'The present law provides that 25 per
cent of all contributions shall be set
apart as a permanent fund, and that
these payments into this fund shall
continue until they amount to $50,000,
after which time the earnings of the
permanent fund shali go to swell the
annuity fund proper.
"It has been evident from the incep
tion that the contributions from teach
ers and the share of absence money
allowed by the law will ultimately
prove insufneent to pay the specified
$50 per month to annuitants.
"In order to increase the annuity and
retirement fund it has been decided to
hold a monster festival and bazaar,
such as has been done in other cities,
about Thanksgiving of the present
year, in which the teachers and public
school children will be asked to take
part.
"It has been thought that many ex
cellent features of a bazaar might be
secured through the sewing, cooking
and manual training departments. In
the way of keeping down expenses, it
was proposed to have a children's or
chestra.
This bazaar will probably be held in
the Mechanics' Pavilion. Of the com
mittee on ways and means Joseph
O'Connor is chairman and Miss A. B.
Gavigan of the Clement Grammar
School is secretary. A second commit
tee, composed of Miss Jessie Smith,
Miss Gavigan and Mrs. Pray, was re

I thÂ« nobla arch of tno grove,HERE IS A MEW METHOD OF DISPOSING OF THE DEAD.
AT last science has awakened
need of a more m
and li
disposing of the dead th
burial in the ground. F
the question of this di
of humanity's mortal remains has at
tracted the attention 1 of learned men of
all countries, but without a bo
any more I iry than cremation.
Now, however, a body of scientists
have invented a plan that, it is
claimed, will dissipate much of the
gloom of death and abolish the bar
baric custom of interment. They pro
pose to build huge mausoleums in the
suburban districts of New York that
will, be "homes for the dead" â build
ings fashioned after the pattern of
great palaces, and as artistically and
commodiously arranged inside as any
library. To these sumptuous quarters
the future dead of New York will be
taken and placed in handsome private
rooms, where they will be subjected
to a simple yet effective process that
will preserve or "mummify" them for
all time to come. Years after a per
son is dead his or her friends may
drive up to the magnificent building,
through it.Â« flowered lawns, and by
simp!;, entering one of Its scores of pri
vate apartments gaze upon the life
like form and features of the departed,
whose remains lie there as if in sleep.
Reese Carpenter, an official of a large
nearby cemetery, pronounces the new
method an admirable one. He says
that by it the bodies of the dead can
be preserved intact for an Indefinite
period of time â forever if desired â
that it will take from future funerals
and last ceremonies all their most har
rowing features, and will enable rela
tives and friends to participate in the
rites without detriment to their own
health, as is now so often the case. It
will make it impossible, he says, for a
person to be buried alive.
When a body is taken to the pro
posed mausoleum it will Immediately

New Jersey, to catch a glimpse of
the Bachelor Maids' Club, an associa
tion of twelve charming marriageable
young women, who have banded to
gether to protect themselves from the
wiles of unworthy members of the other
ccx.
The members of the club are the
Misses Lillian Miller, . Marion Hand.
Harriet Hall, Louisa Bush, Edna
Bailey, Beble Uoak, Emma Ewing, Lot
tie Hughes, Ethel Kennedy, Louisa
Whitney, Louisa Miller and Florence
Whitney. The organization has only
three officers â Miss Lillian Miller, pres
ident; Miss Marlon Hand, vice-presi
dent, and Miss Harriet Hall, secretary
and treasurer.
While the duties of the president are
somewhat exacting, in consequence of
the grave responsibilities imposed upon
her, the functions of the treasurer are
not especially burdensome. The presi
dent ia supposed to know the inward
life and yearning of each member of
the fraternity, and to give kindly ad
vfee in all matters affecting the dig
nity, character and loyalty of the or
ganization.
The perpetuation of celibacy Is not
contemplated, as every member is in
favor of marriage, but it must be a
marrlntre of the idea! standard Bet by
the club. Accordingly the twelve young
mÂ«n somewhere In "this broad world
who would willingly marry these
twelve winsome misses must throw
away their vices and prepare them-
Belves to answer some questions like
these:
Do you drink, or smoke, or chew, or
wear a silk hat in summer with a blue
serge *uit, or lie in bed in the morn-
Ing while your father shovels coal into
the heater, or give expression to wicked
words when y<ni strike your thumb
with a hammer?
Do you earn enough to support a
wife? Can you see a flower store with
out being directed to it. Do you write
lov* letters with a pÂ«n<-il? How many
cousins of the feminine gender have
you. What becomes of your temper
when you lose your collar "button ? Do
you ride a iast year's wheel? Are you
fond of ice cream and soda water and
poetry? Above all, do you sympathize
with the members of the Bachelor
Maids' Club in their efforts to promote
happy marriages?

be placed in a specially prepared sep
ulchre, made ready to receive it This
sepulchre is a little larger than an or
dinary coffin, and the body is placed
in It prone. At the head of the sepul
chre is a small hole to which is at
tached a tube, through which by
means of a fan wheel a current of dry
chemicalized air is gently driven over
the remains, escaping through a sim
ilar hole near the feet. Prior to enter
ing the sepulchre the air passes
through an i pen vat of sulphuric acid.
The chemical action of the acid upon
the air removes all moisture from it.
After leaving the coffin or sepulchre
the air passes through a hot furnace
and returns to the outer world through
a tall chimney. The furnace kills any
infectious germs which the air might
have .aught up in passing through the
coffin. The body is subjected to the
dry air process for thirty days. Then
the current is stopped, the tubes are
removed and the body is in a state of
preservation in which, it is claimed, it
will remain for centuries. The features
do not alter in the least, nor does the
skin discolor. The latter, it la said, at
tains a white, marble!;: appearance,
and the flesh becomes hard and firm.
While the process reduces the weight
of the body, it does not seem to re
duce its bulk.

The entire cost of desiccating a body

in this masoleum will be but $70. Pri

just as do suites of rooms in a hotel,
and the rich man who desires such an
expensive apartment for the sepulcher
of himself and his entire family will be
charged accordingly, and he may lav

rearrangement as he desires.

sterner sex.
Articles of confederation were drawn
up forbidding any of the members to
marry within five years. There were
eight charter members, and Miss Olson
was the leading spirit in drafting the
bylaws and bringing about a perma
nent organization. The other members
of the club say the ideals of the club
will now be scoffed at to such an ex
tent that it will go to pieces.
The "coming-out" event of the club
was celebrated at Kinsley's in Septem

before her marriage. c- ,;.:;â

BOSTON, Jan. â Three enthusias

and the strangest rules against mar

by the charter members.
Miss Beatrice Chase, president of the
biggest and most enthusiastic club, the
Miles Standish Anti-Marriage Club, on
being asked about the cause of this
new movement among the sex, replied
frankly:
"Haven't you noticed yet that girls
who get up these anti-marriage clubs
and are the most enthusiastic in sup

want to be at the very head of this pro

EASTERN MARKETS.
NKW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW TORK. Jan. IS.â stock market was i
subjected to a rather drastic liquidation of
speculative holdings to-day In continuation of
the movement of yesterday. The selling was ,
due to a feeling that it was safer to take
profits at the present level than to retain I
holdings over Sunday. The situation at Ha
vana was the motive of the selling. There is
no assurance felt that there mi.; not be a sud- '
den development of a dangerous situation there
which would necessitate the Immediate meas
ures by the United States naval forces to pro
tect the Interests of American residents in Ha
vana. Reports on this score were somewhat
aggravated by the persistent selling of houses
with Washington connections. This was
taken to reflect a feeling of apprehension in
official circles. Of course the professional |
traders were ready to turn sellers without ,
further inducement on the general principle ;
that 'prices so down much more easily an.l
quietly than they go p. The bear attack
was vigorous and effective and margins being
wiped out In many case* holdings were thrown
over to save loss* - thus adding to the weak
en of short lines put out earlier Indicated the |
bear selling. Nearly every active stock on the ,
list was at one time a point or over below last
night's close. To-day's and yesterday's re
actions in the stock market put an end to a
period of strength an.l activity earlier in the
week which was regarded as giving good
promis-e of the usually expected old January
boom in prices. Only those stock* which
peered extreme advances early In the week
have thing leu to show for it. the general
level of th- market being decidedly lower than
at last Saturday's close. The llrmness with
! whit h the mark' withstood the effect of the
. first news of the Havana rioting of Thursday
led to the hope in the minus of the bulls
that the power for evil of the Cuban question
: had been tested to the full. But the mar- ;
ket was sustained on Thursday only by the j
striking strength displayed by the Vandw
bllts. New York Central and Lake Shore ris
i ing about four points each on reports that new
plans were In contemplation for operations
looking to reduced cost and increased dividends â 
on the stocks. The amount of the trading on
a practical stationary market <>n Thursday
might have served .is a warning of what would
have happened had the sustaining force been j
I withdrawn. It was soon an obvious fact that
heavy realising was In prog-reâ all the Wees
side by side with the active strength <>: special
! slock*. The special points ot vantage which
i the strength of the market held early In the
j week were Northern Pacific stocks and Union
Pacific and Its various affiliated and connect
ing lines, the source of strength being the
assurance of the continuance of Union Pacific's
old outlet to the Pacific Coast. Northern Pa
cilic and the Union Pavlflc group also enjoyed
the benefit of anticipations or a large Klon
dike business in the spring. Another source .it
strength to Northern Pacific was the decision
of the Interstate Commerce committee to con
tinue the suspension of the long and short
haul clause in cases where rales Were i:. com
petition with Canadian lines.
Sugar Was persistently weak. Its decline
I has been attributed to the declared purposes of
the directors to retain the surplus for con
; tlnpency, and professional traders have taken
! a gloomy but uniform view of what these con
| tingencles might be. The pendency of the
I Hawaiian annexation treaty In the Senate is
i unfavorable to Sugar, as annexation would
! allow Hawaiian refined sugar to come in free.
| The industrial list generally has been heavy
! during the week. A feature has been the large
I buying for investment account of gilt-edged
] stocks. To-day's bank statement indicates
j that the expected replenishment of the money
market has been accomplished, and insignifi
cant weakening of foreign exchange indicates
that the seasonable outgo of gold
is likely not to occur on account
of . the heavy trade balance in our
j favor. The item of loan expansion does not
| indicate a very active demand for money, but
In the last few days offerings of commercial
I paper were reported to be in large volume
Bidding for choice grades has also been suffi
ciently active to affect a lowering of rates.
, The market for railway bonds has been very
active all week and record prices have been
; reached for many high graOe Issues. The Is
sues of the Union Pacific group have been
; conspicuous and strong, showing advances
ranging up to 6 points. Seattle. Lake Shore
and Eastern firsts trust receipts rose at one
time -" per cent, but lost a part of the gain.

CHICAGJ GRAIN MARKET
I CHICAGO, Jan. Wheat was surprisingly
, strong when contrasted with the weak feeling
that prevailed at }he close yesterday. First
transactions In May were at from 90%$}90>&c.
I against 9O@9QV4c the previous afternoon, and
in about half an hour It was able to be sold
; or a second or two at >\ Calls for tike
day had been sold at M^fcC, but It was said
most of these privileges had been bought up
by people who were short as a safeguard
against the possible eccentricities of an er
ratic market. The Liverpool market closed
from %i\ to %d higher than It did yesterday.
This was somewhat of a surprise to traders,
many of whom had sold short yesterday in
anticipation of a decline here to-day, and
caused considerable covering. Liverpool re
ported spot wheat wen 1 , and 2d lower for Cali
fornia, with sellers of Argentine wheat at 3d
per quarter lower than it was offered Friday.
The closing cables showed some recovery from
the previous day's heavy decline, and that
j tended to strengthen the hands of the bulls.
I Paris showed a rise of 60 centimes in January
! flour and 20 centimes In March-June. Bus!
' ness was at no time very heavy. While trad
ing still continues to be done chiefly for May
I delivery, there is a general disposition to work
! clear of it and transfer speculative dealing's
i into July, the proportion of trade in which Is
I growing daily. After the early advance In May
to 90fiC the offerings somewhat exceeded the
I demand, and the price sagged to between 90V*
i and 90^ic, but I it good support at that and
closed SO'ic bid.
! Business in corn was exceptionally dull, and
! merely of a scalping character. May closed
, He lower.
Of.ts were duller. If possible, than corn. May
dosed a shade lower.
Provisions were dull and easier. At the clos*
May pork was .",i lower and May lard and
ribs each -'_â¢â â  lower.

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK. Jan. 15.â The Financier earn:
The New York banks have made a new record
In the matter of loan*, the total of $810 992 600
at the close of the week being: the highest ever
reported. Dep sits also are above any figure
jsly made. Turing the first tWi
of the present year the gain In deposits has
b?en ri6,600,000, while I'uns have expanded only
â¢ . 00. In view of this fact the eaae in
money rates does not apt ear strange, arkl if
the banks- cont<r.ue to gain Jrom the Interior
.v.-r <tu< taflons will follow.
The wlthdra mt deposits, how
ever, may steady the situation, The banks
irained during the pe*t week J.*.2ii9.30j in cash.
?. . - â¢ â¢ < lold is now
coming in this direction from Canada, the past
ten days' rceipts having approximated $Â«:.(>.
000. The increase In deposits was $C,"20.400.
while loans are unly J1.21j.700 lieavier. The ex
reserve in consequence expanded $3,074,000
and stands at $25,968,771 This is only half
as large as reported one year ajro. but in view
of the fact that remittances are now becom
ln>? larger, an Increase Bay be expected from
week to week. In the changes made during
the week the operations seem to have been con
â¢ thÂ«> iarK-r Imnks. Th>- deposits of the
Hr.nover, the National Park and the National
City Hanks are i7.rÂ«K'.ooo larger than the pre
vln'.is week. Whether this Is due to special
tlons carir.ot be definitely stated, but it
shows that the r^malnirg banks have less
in lmnd than at the close of January
S. The factors that led to the g-aln in cash,
however, are rather well defined and they may
â¢her institutions having
larije country connections from this time on. As
it week the enormous interior
m< v.-ment at this season forces down m i,-y
Lad compels csnitsl to seek better rates
abroad- In other words. It leads to gold -x-
But the anomaly Is now presented of
our Idle Money being Invested In foreign ex
change on this Bide of the water. Europe is
n..w usin*; at le.-^t $".0,000,000 American money
la Urn foreign < ! r deferred oredlts, and unless
rates abroad â¢ r >' '""' level there r<>
no prosper t of this sum being immediately
reducwi. S.i sensitive, li< wever. Is the situa
nce tlie United States became the dom
inant power In the international market that
: .dit can be expanded or reduced at will.
<â lea.rini.-s Indicate that a much larger vol
ume of money than usual will be needed t his

done.

A New York commercial paper of the 10th
Â«ays: The steady advance in hides and the
lightness of the supply give MM ground to
thÂ« predictions of importers that prices this
yeor will rival th"so of 1895. The present high
prices are accounted for by the fact that the
supply of raw material in every mart of the
world Is unprecedented!? small. The stock of
dry hides in Oral hands here aggregates 13.000.
It consists of 1.i.000 Orinocns. 2300 Cordova.

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been six arrivals of coal from Brit
ish Columbia, with 20.523 tons; three from
Washington, 9000 tons; one from Australia. 3772
tons; one from Oregon, 1142 tons; total. 34.743
tons. Notwithstanding the generous deliveries
this week, yet there is an exceptional scarcity
of all grades suitable for domestic uses; Well
ington, Seattle and Coo* Hay shipments have
all been taken out of first hands into the re
taller? yards. Our protracted spell of frosty
weather baa largely Increased the consump
tion for house purposes. If our Coast coal pro
ducers should see tit to take advantage of the
preeent condition of our fuel market they couid
very readily mark up prices, and housekeepers
would be the sufferers. Steam coals arc in fair
supply, and no change of values new! be feared
for the present, as large consumers are so
licited to make contracts nt current rates, mi.i
do not appear to be very anxious buyers. if
â we do not have some general rains shortly, to
induce grain carriers to seek this port for the
next season's crop, there will assuredly be a
stiffening in coal freights. The total amount
of foreign and Eastern coals that can possibly
arrive hÂ«-re in the next sixty days from all
sources, foots up less than 47.000 tons: as our
ronsumption within that time will be fully
210.CC0 tons. It can readily be computed what
n draft we will make on the output of Seattle
and British Columbia. With four firms con
trolling 90 per cent of our local fuel supplies
from' â¢ mi. Coast, It can be seen how easily a
coalition could be effected to establish uniform

WANTED A SECOND CATCH.
There once lived a man and his wife
at St. Ann's, the only town of the isl
and of Alderney, and the pair were
not on the best of terms.
One fine morning the man was miss
ing and nothing was heard of him for
a fortnight. The wife pretended to be
in great distress, so much so that when
his body was found in a small bay sur
rounded by rocks at low water no one
liked to tell her â more especially as the
finding was accompanied with what
they thought would shock her dread
fully, for when the poor fellow was
pulled out of the water a great quan
tity of small conger eels fell on the
sands from his body; the fact was, he
was full of them!
At last a friend undertook to break
the intelligence and receive the widow's
instructions.
This he did, not omitting to men
tlon the eels.
The story told, he asked what were
her wishes, as he was anxious, to- ;
gether with the rest of her friends, to
obey her orders.
The widow removed her handker
chief from her eyes and murmured out
in the Channel Island Anglo-Norman
tongue:
"Send home the eels and set him
again; I am very fond of eels!" â Spare
Moments.

BRISK TRADE
IN BIG DOGS
Men Who Are Going to
the Klondike Are the
Purchasers.
Ranchers and Residents on
the Mission Road Are the
Victims.
â Warrants Out for the Arrest of John
Hlggins and James Flynn for
Stealing the Canines.
John Hlgrgins and James Flynn, two
young men living near the Five-mile
House, Mission road, have developed
a new industry, which has so far
proved very profitable.
Mo6t of the ranchers and residents
In the surrounding districts own or
rather owned valuable dugs, principally
of the St. Bernard and Newfoundland
breeds. Recently the .1"- T s have been
disappearing, until now there is
scarcely a large dog in the neighbor
hood.
The police were notified, and the
mounted squad were instructed by Cap
tain Glllen to find nut the mystery of
the disappearance of the canines. Cor
poral Shanahan was not long in solv
ing the problem, and yesterday he
took one of the victims. A. Schuts, 42
Palmer street, to Judge Joachimsen's
court, to swear to a complaint charging
Higgins and Flynn with grand larceny.
Shanahan found that all the dogs had
been stolen by Higglna and Flynn
and sold to men who intend to leave
for the Klondike gold fields. The prin
cipal purchasers were, according to
Shanahan, James Brownlle, a barten
der on Larkin and Fulton streets, and
James B. Wingate, a druggist now em
ployed in a store on Market street. It
is said that Brownlie and Wingate have
between them bought between twenty
live and thirty dogs.
Schutz also obtained a search war
rant for the recovery of his dog, which
Is a Newfoundland, valued at $100. It
was stolen from him on January S.
Search warrants will also be sworn
out by the other men who have lost
dogs, and a lively time is expected
when they are all recovered and taken
to the City Prison till the cases are
disposed of.
Higgins and Flynn piled their trade
during the hours of the night. They
usually had a tempting piece of meat
with them and get the dogs to follow
them without making a noise. The dogs
would be taken into tne city under
cover of darkness and sold. The price
paid for the dogs is not known, but.
assuming it was $20 each, Higgins and
Flynn did a rattling business.

NEWS OF THE MINES.
New Railroads for Mines
and New Mines for
Railroads.
Boom In Southern Califor
niaâTwo Tales of Great
Placer Finds.
It looks as though the Mother Lode is
to be reached before a great while by
another railroad line which will give a
large mining region that new impetus
â¢which transportation facilities, bringing
cheapness and convenience to every
phase of mining life and operation, can
give in a greater degree than anything
else. The Stockton and Tuolumne Rail
road Company, though composed mainly
of women and so far managed by an
able and active woman, seems to have
good prospects of getting a real railroad
running from tidewater to Summersvllle
on the East belt in Tuolumne County.
A committee of twelve citisens has
been organized to Becure subscrip
tions to stock in the county and
Mrs. Annie Hikert of Jamestown, the
hustling organizer and president of the
company, declares that capital for the
enterprise is waitinÃ m Stockton, San
Francisco and elsewhere. Whether this
road is built or Dot a number of branch
railroads will thread various parts of
the mining region of the Btate in
the near future and every one will
bring a transformation in the way
of quickened development, Increas
ed population and increase of mining
prosperity and production.
The Stockton and Tuolumne road, if
built, will go through Copperopolla and
will likely tiring about, a resumption of
copper mining in that rich copper re
gion. When the leading copper mine
there closed down it cost $3 to haul the
matte to the railroad at Milton and $2 to
get it to Stockton. <'oke cost as much to
get in. A rate on matte of $1 from Â«'o[>
peropolis to tidewater might !><â¢ expect
ed to result from the building of this
road. The line would cross the mother
lode near the Rawhide, Tarantula ami
other large mines and reach a group
of rich mines on the Bast Kelt. Sonora
would be. reached and i),<- cost of trans
portation and production would be de
creased over a large mineral area in the
county. With this and the Sierra rail
road reaching It, Tuolumne would make
large strides.
TWO TALES OF RJCII PLATER
STRIKES IN CALIFORNIA.
The week has afforded two Interesting
tales of "strikes" by placer miners In
California worth noting amid the Klon
dike craze. Although quarts mining is
the field in which the great future fl<
velopment of California gold mining will
be reached, and while rich finds I:: quartz
lodes are of almost daily occuri
throughout the State, the placer deposits
will yield hundreds of millions in the fu
ture, and new developments are constant
reminders that cv tn placer mining is not
"played out" in California- ' >ne ,Â»f these
finds is a "drift" deposit up north in NÂ« -
vada County, and the other is .t placer
â¢worked by a dry washer away down on
the desert in San Bernardino County.
The finding of another tl' 'i pectJon of
puried ancient river 'b.T.-ei is thus de
scribed by the Nevada Daily Transcript:
"A remarkably rich lead of blue gravel
has been found on Clifford B. Calkins'
eighty-acre Tract of patented ground at
the foot of Belby Plat, a mile w.-st of
north of town. The dirt pays from ten
to fifty cents a pan, and the gold is very
coarse.
"The strike was made on New Tear's
day. Young Mr. Calkins and his father

and brother had been working the claim
steadily since August 14. They had run
216 feet of main tunnel and had upraised
;<.!.<l drifted In various directions for
ral hundred feet more, searching for the
blue lead supposed to ll< ement
Hill, but which has heretofore never been
found in that part of the country.
"After a conference <>n the last day of
the year they decided to work ;i few
days longer. Next morning an impulse
s. :zÂ«.-<! one of them to X" Into an uj
ten feet above the tunnel and drift west
erly. He had guni; but four feet when
he struck a rim carrying a thin layer of
genuine blue gravel and pitching to the
west. Since then t!.> rim-rock of the
new-found lead lia.s been broken through
at various points for a distance of forty
feet and found to be uniform and regu
lar. Every foot of it pr< spects splendid
' ly, 10 cents to the pan being the poorest
so far. it extends almost parallel
with and several feet above th<' tunnel,
and the owners are satisfied that they
have half a mile on the channel.
'â Arrangements â will now be made for
the thorough and systematic working of i
the claim. The eider (>'"â â  has been a
gravel miner In that locality sino
and he regards the find as o
best ever made on or above Belby Flat.
: which was a veritable Golconda to the
pioneer placer miners. A number of oth
er old-time gravel miners have visi t*â¢â¢!t *â¢â¢!
the claim in the last few days, and they
say they have (seen nothing so good for
tlirty years or more.
"Pot many years past the search for
this deposit has been carried on by pros
pector after prospector, and without
avail till now. Tens of thousands of
dollars have been spent In sinking and
!in running tunmls and cuts. One shaft
was sunk a great distance into the ridge
some three decades ago -- 1 â¢ i<li < l struck a
I bo'ilder twenty or mnro feet across the
top. Here the shaft sinkers quit In dis
trust. Had they put an Incline down past
the boulder a few feet they would have
found what they wanted, for the boulder
lies just over the .channel, as the last
f< w days have proven to the present
; owners. Such is thfÂ» irony of the gold
| hunter's fate very often."
The San I-iernardlno Times-Index
i matches some of th< [ the Klon
dike thus:
"I-ouls Curtis, Dick Donahue and W.
i R. Radenburger an- three partners doing
j business in the Virginia Dale District,
and last evening the first two named
came in with $370f> in gold dust and nug
gets as the result of less than two
months' work. And yet people will rush
to Alaska and endure all kinds of hard
ships jn the search for gold in the Icy
north when untold wealth is to be had at
our very doors. The claims from which
the gold was taken have only b^en lo
cated a little over six weeks, and arÂ»
called the "Rough and Ready' find
'Klondike. 1 They are situated in the
Virginia Dale District, and are placer
i claims, being worked with dry washers.
The largest nugget taken out Is worth
$JK *4, and many others of smaller sizes
were found. Ofttlmes the miners took
I out $972 per week while only two of them
: were working."
THE MOST RELIABLE BBTOCATS OF
ALASKA'S G< >L,D V\i> fDTJCT.
The Alaska Mining Record gives the
; following estimate Of the Alaskan gold
; product of 1897, including the American
: portion of the Yukon Valley:
'"'Die output of the mines of Alaska
is extremely difficult of estimation. The
vastness of the mining territory, the mi
! gratory characteristic of its population
and the entire absence of reports and
statistics from a great part of the small
er camps render it a difficult matter to
arrive at a statement approximately cor
rect except by .artful study and watch
ful attention â¢ detail. Tl i
lowing estimate is believed to !
nearly correct as possible, and still rep-
I ts. fully, yet conservatively, the
production of gold in Alaska during the
past season:

"This Is but a slight Increase over the
output of last year. "While the quartz

that of 189S, It will be noticed that th.>
placer output, which was greatest in
Rirch Creek district lnst year, is consid
erably smaller owing to the abandon

Joined the Klondike rush."

.'.ange that has come over a large
proportion of the small mining towns of

The excitement following wild news
paper reports ,of riches on the Yaqui
River, Mexico, has petered out and dis
gusted rushers are still returning. One
of the latest notes of them is the follow
ing In the Tombstone Prospector: "A
party of men arrived at Nogales the other
day. They had traversed almost the en
tire length of the Taqui River in search
of placer ground, and although they
struck color everywhere, they found no
placor gold in paying quantities.* Thus
warnings should be constantly sent out
which should not be lost to those who
have the Yaqui gold fever."
It is stated that 215 cars of or** a day

How Southern Callforolan Mines Are
Coming to the Front.
The mining districts of Southern Cali
fornia will probably show an Increase
of gold production of not far from $1,000.
000. as compared with iso<'>. During the
year a groat amount of development has
gone on, and many new mines will be
producing this year. There is now more
prospecting going on all over the deserts
and in Ban Diego County than has ever
been known. More capital Is seeking in
vestment than ever before. Bales of de
veloped mines and of promising claims
are reported almost daily. Many of the
investors are Eastern men, but there, as
elsewhere throughout the State, Califor
nians are eagerly looking about them for
gold properties. A number of mills and j
cyanide plants have been erected or ar
ranged for during the past few months.
It is estimated that there is $14,000,000
Invested in the gold mines south of Teha
chapi, with I stamps dropping and
about mi employed. The number of
mines located is about 3SOO, and perhaps
2500 are being actively worked or devel- >
oped. Yet as truly as of any other part
of the State can II be said that tho de
velopment of, the gold, resources has
hardly begun. During the year hundreds
of valuable finds have been made, and
in scores of claims on which develop
ment has proceeded "strikes" have been
made. The greatest activity has been
seen in the Randsburg district, which
will now enjoy a second growth with the
completion of Its railroad; but the Vir
ginia Dale, Perris. Pannlmint and other
districts scattered over the great arid
gold-producing territory are likewise see
ing the beginnings of greatness.
Southern California has as much to
gain from the coming Mining Fair at San
Francisco as any other part of .the State,
yet there has been no extensive and or
ganized movement to show to the many
thousand! who will attend the exposi
tion the opportunities which Southern
California offers to gold seekers, the pos
sibilities of Us great hidden wealth, Its
peculiar attractions to prospectors, and
the chances for investment there. South
ern California knows how to advertise
and has well learned the value of it. and
now comes a chance to advertise its min
eral resources and fruits. The southern
counties should match the mother lode
region with the magnificence, pictur
esquenest and allurements of its display
at the Mechanics" Pavilion.
A weekly record of all the mining prog
ress In the counties of Ban Diego, San
Bernardino. Riverside and Kern would
require a large amount of space. During
the past week the arrival from Chicago
of C. W. L<Jller and S. C. Good of the
Monroe Mining and Milling Company has
brought to prominent notice the proper
ties in the Virginia Dale district, which
this company has bought and propose to
develop on a large scale. There are four
claims yet undeveloped, but showing a
wide ledge giving high assays and the
promise of a bonanza. Tile company also
has two properties in the Chuckawalla
Mountains, in which shafts of about 50
feet show a line ledge of ore about six
feet wide. The company promises to be
gin extensive development at once.
The development of tin- desert gold.re
sources is of course hampered by lack of
water, of milling facilities, transporta
j tion, etc., but these aids, along with elec-
I trie power and special processes adapted
I to the ores and the mining conditions,
will rapidly Increase from now on. A few
days ago a tew custom mill was started
at Johannesburg, and now the San Ber
nardino Times-Index reports that a 40
stamp custom stamp miii and a cyanide
: plant will be erected at once at Bars tow,
i giving prospectors and claim owners with
small capital a chance to work their
properties.
The Lone Star Mining Company, with
a capital of $1,000,000, was organized at
Ontario last week to work the Lone Star
â  and Yankee Doodle mines.

WHIST
The fourth annual meeting of the Pacific
Const Whist Association has pone Into history.
The news columns of The Call have Riven a
very pood account of what has transpired.
The president of the association received a
great many congratulatory letters from the
great masters of the Kamt% which no doubt will
be read with great interest by the whist-lov
lng public. The first Is from Miss Kate
Wheelock, known throughout the world as the
Whist Queen. It is as follows:
BOSTON, Jan. 7 IS9S.
P. J. Tormey, President P. C. W. A.â Dear
Mr. Tormey: Your Invitation to be present
to your fourth annual meeting of the Pacific
Coast Whist Association, to he held In your
city January 14 and 15, 1898, Just received, and
again 1 felt the same regret as in past ses
sions and for the same reasonâ the distance
alone Is the reason.
Hut I do send you all my best wishes for a
successful feathering. And certainly Bin you
wrre the first to conceive the Idea of having
association!*, and Since many in the East have
followed out your idea with great success,
you ought to feel proud of the fact that it
started from the Pacific Coast and in your
pity. May the best whist win In the. wish of
your sincere friend, KATE WHEELOCK.
WMISTERS FROM OREGON.
The Portland Club of Portland. Or., was
represented at the whist convention by the
president of the North Pacific Whint Asso
ciation, 1.. Therkleson, which club was ad
mitted as a member of the Pacific Coast
Whist Association. Mr. Therkleson was ac
companied by Judge 1,. T. Barm, E. C. John
son and Mr. Sweeny, the team who visited
San Francisco in August last and carried oft
the Payot trophy. .
DOES IT CONSTITUTE A REVOKE?
A very unusual and Interesting question hns
be^n submitted for our opinion. It arose the
other evefilÃC in a match game In the rooms
of The Trist Doplicate wTUsi Club:
East dealt nnd turnÂ»-.l qoeen Of spades; Booth
Icails a tmall diamoad, which is won by East.
.â¢a'is to of spades (trumps) and holds
the trick, then switches to â  dub, which is
won by North, an,l North Immediately comes
through Bast with Â» spade ttrump); Bast
.i diamond; South plaj West.
att-r hesitating â  little, in s surprised way
asks. 'Wli.it are trumps?" Asking the ques
to m fee nml correct his fr
ror; North and Bouth rlalm a revoke, fful
claims, under law 88, that he has the right
to :i-k. "What the trump suit Is" at v;
during the pla> of s deal.
Â«'ll; OPINION.
If we were a reJStee or umpire in a mntrh
and this question came up just ns It did In
W, ws w'uM allow ii revoke, as we In
terpret the law povernins: revokes.
l^iv. 2Sâ The second paragraph reads: "A
renounce in error may be corrected by the
player making it before the trick In "which it
occurs has teen turned and quitted, unless
either he or his partner, whether in his right
turn or otherwise, has led or played to the
following trick, unless his partner has asked
whether or not he has any of the suit re
ll' uncr>d."
Questions asked at a whist table by a player,
undor the strict letter of the unwritten law,
should be addressed to the partner, and are
answerable only by him. This being the case,
the t|UÂ»-stlon asked was to all Intents and pur
poses asking the partner. "Whether or not he
had any of the suit renounced?" -Under the
laws of duplicate whist, as adopted- by the
last Congress, a player has the right to pre
vent his partner from committing any irreg
ularity . except this one thing, "Renouncing
in error."
t, asking this question at this partlcu
- ins partner, the dealer, that
th" trump suit, and the turneii
..â  knew was still i: n|>la> t-<t. an.l 1
saj estab ,-oke. The words

THE PAYOT TROPriY IN OREGON.
The Fayot trophy 1b soinf? the rounds in Ore
gon. When tho crack team of the Trist Club,
composed of Q. M. Steams, Lieutenant Le
selne, Richard Nixon and S. P. Heuston, won
f HALE BROS.
so easily from the Portland "Whist Club It was
generally supposed they would hang on to It
for some time. But Judge L. T. Barm. captain
of a mixed team from the Oregon Roail Club,
composed of Mr. and Mrs. Carroll Hughes,
Miss Sallie Beck and himself, Bent in a chal
lenge and New Year's eve was selected for the
contest. The match consisted of forty-eight
deals and resulted in a victory for Judge
Harln's team by a gain of six tricks. The
Indies are members of the Kate Wheelock
Club of Portland and it Is not to be wondered
.it that they could play equal with the men.
THE PLAY CALLED Th|E "fIL-
BANY LEAD."
Mr. John T. Mitchell, the author of two of
the greatest works on duplicate whist that
have ever been published, is the whist editor
of the Times-Herald of Chicago. "When John
cracks a nut one is sure to get some good meat
out of it.
Under the heading of "The Albany T^ad"
he says: "The play first described, which la
at present used as a call through the honor,
was formerly used to show a holding of three
card suits, and has been variously known as
the Milwaukee lead, the Albany lead, the Syra
cuse lead, the Pottsvtlle lead, etc. Whenever
it struck 'a new place it was usually considered
that it originated there, and was so christened.
The number of places whose name it bears is
the best proof of the extent of Its inroads
among the whist players, and yet while it re
tains its popularity for some little time In each
of its birthplaces. It soon proves so disastrous
to those who have adopted it that they are glad
to let it go quietly and without public cere
mony, and when it is born again in another
community the whist players of the previous
birthplace have no heart to dispute Its pa
ternity. The above is only another way of pay-
Ing that the play cannot be recommended.
Ptill. the hardest duty gi regulation whist
player has to perform Is to lead from four
trumps when the remainder of his hand con
sistsof three three-card suits. The only Other way
out of the difficulty is to lead the bottom of
one of the three-card suits, provided It is
headed by the ace. king or queen, with prefer
ence In the order named, and If you have not
anything as good as that, abide by the rule
and blame the game If It loses."
TABLES FOR CLUB PAIRS.
Whist Editor CÂ«ll: For the purpose of fUHner
certain traps in duplicate play T have recently
soni^ calculations which It till to be Of
ruffielent general Importance to justify dis
pemi nation.
The scheme for progressive duplicate for
pairs suggested by Professor "SVhitfield and
published by Mr. Mitchell in his late work at
pases 67 and 6S only goes as far as ten tables.
This I* inadequate for large clubs, and I have
extended it to Include sixteen tables, involving
the play of thirty-one trays, as many as can
conveniently be played in one evening.
The players move In the same order. I. c..
the highest player plays against the lowest,
the next highest against the next lowest, etc.,
the first round, and on the subsequent rounds
each pair takes the place of the next lower.
No. 1 remaining stationary alt evening. â  In
the original assignment of pair numbers the
north and south pair* are the same number
as the tables at which they sit; the east and
west pairs are the difference between that
number and the one greater than the number
of pairs in play, it will be observed that the
north and south pairs move to,ward the first
table, and the east, and west pairs move
away from the first table.
The essential difference between this sys
tem andllowell's system Is that here the play
ers move regularly and the trays do not. while
in his plan the trays move regularly and the
players do not.
The extensions will be sent to all clubs de
siring same free. H..H. HOTAL.ING.
