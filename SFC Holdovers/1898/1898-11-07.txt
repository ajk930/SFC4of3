FARNUM USED ONE BANK TO
SAVE ANOTHER FROM RUIN
He Betrayed Thousands of Depositors
Into the h|ands of tfye
Conspirators.
The Â£3ged Banker Played a Dubious Double Part in
the Destruction of the People's SaviQgs
Banl^ arjd ttye Pacific.
In the history of the ruin of the Pa
eifio Bank, The Call begins this morn-
Ing the publication of the letters of Dr.
R. H. McDonald. In December. 1891.
Dr. R. H. McDonald fled from this city
to evade the consequences of hia own
crimes and those of his sons. Before
he fled he promised the Bank Cammis-
Bloners that he v. ould piedge his
private fortune to save the institutions
with which he was so prominently con
nected. Instead of keeping his prom
ises he did everything In his power to
divert his property from any channel
â wherein the depositors might use the
courts to demand restitution. The aged
banker went to New York, and while
there kept himself closely in touch with
the affairs of the Institutions that were
fast drifting on to the rocks of finan
cial distress.
The letters of R. H. McDonald Sr.
present a dramatic story of a tragedy
of finance. The old man in the latter
part of 1592 and the first half of 1893
was battling against the wreck of his
fortune and almost of death. In the
greatest bitterness of heart he dis
cusses his private affairs, warns and
counsels his children, reminds them of
their duties and obligations toward re
ligion and begs them to accept the
warnings in time. In the old man's
letters Is the record of the terrible
struggle of the family to free them
selves from the human parasites
that were sucking their lives and
dragging them down to ruin. In
letter after letter written from New
York, where for nearly a year and a
half the eider McDonald was prac
ticaiiy iv hiding:, Dick is urged to brave ,
the storm that was battering the I
family to death. In the latter days of
the conspiracy the elder McDonald
seemed mad with grief that his for
tune and his honorable name should be
crushed.
In letter after letter the aged moral
ist discusses the beauties of a truly
Christian life and then asks his son to
steal ten thousand more from the bank.
At one moment he cries out that all
must pull together for the shore and
reach the end of the bank's career
honorably if not a dqllar is left at the
end. Again he cries despairingly that
"If my children go to hell, they will
go there knowing better." In the bit
terness of remorse the father of Dick
McDonald tells his son that it cost him
$100,000 to get rid of Clara Belle Mc-
Donald, the wife of Dick. Turning
again to the dreadful affairs of the two
banks, the old man in warning terms
Bays "we are surrounded by schemers,
traitors, vagabonds, thieves, and by all
means don't trust that Jew, Moses
Bherman." Throughout the story of
these letters reveals the conspiracy of
financial manipulators, the domestic
miseries and love entanglements of a
once-honored family, the corruption of

WASHINGTON, Nov. 6.â An explo

noon wrecked the Supreme Court room
and the rooms immediately adjoining
it on the main floor of the Capitol.
The damage is enormous. The entire
central eastern part of the great mar
ble pile, from the main floor to the sub-
terranean basement, practically is a
mass of ruins. The force of the ex
plosion was so heavy that the coping-;
stones on the outer walls, just east of
the , point where the explosion occurred,
were bulged out nearly two inches,
windows in all â  that part of I the build-

The San Francisco Call
I officials high In the State and the de
liberate robbery of thousands of men,
women and children.
Dr. McDonald fled from San Francisco
in December, 1891. In August of that
year the Pacific Bank was insolvent.
The Bank Commissioners had warned
the Attorney General and commanded
Dr. McDonald and his sons to rehablli
i tate the Pacific Bank and stop its aw
! ful drain on the People's Bank. Dr.
j McDonald tearfully promised the Bank
Commissioners that he would sacrifice
every dollar of his private fortune to
place his banking institutions again on
i a sound financial foundation. Having
j made that promise he fled from the
I State to evade its fulfillment. From
i that time on until the crash on June
j 22, 1893, Dr. McDonald was supposed by
| the authorities and the public to know
i nothing of the affairs of the institu
tion of which he was the president.
When the Pacific Bank failed he was in
New York, and, with the same fund of
tears to moisten his assertions, em
phatically declared that from the time
he had left the city he had taken ab
solutely no part in any transaction re
lating to- the banks. As a matter of
fact, when not prevented by illness, he
was intimately concerned in a!i the
Eastern manipulations. At his sugges
tion his enormous debt to the Pacific
j Bank was released by a crime; his
property was fraudulently deeded and
j hypothecated until it was placed be
yond the reach of execution. On one
occasion Dick was commanded to take
j $2000 and on another $1000 for the per
sonal incidental needs of his father.
And when the crash became inevitable
the old man himself, over his own sig
nature, told Dick to steal $10,000 more, j
so that the doctor might have living ex- j
penses for six months. The letters will
be found interesting and perhaps valu- I
able in any effort there may be made '
to recover the stolen property of the i
banks.
DR. McDONALD'S FEAR OF THE
BANK COMMISSION.
A few days after Dr. R, H. McDonald
fled from this city his interview with
the Bank Commissioners was still on
his mind, and from San Bernardino on
January 23, 1892, he wrote, in part to
Frank, his son, as follows:
I am desirous of knowing the result
of the interview you were to have had
or did have with the Bank Commis
sioners growing out of the note sent
us from them the day before I left the
city to come here. I doubt if I will
ever again enjoy the health _I us
ually have had. Three score and ten
hangs out her sign to say you are
nearing the end of that great un
known beyond, from whence no trav
eler has returned to bring us the
news, but where a triumphant faith
leads us on to a higher and better
place.
FARNUM THOUGHT THAT THE
BANKS WERE IN DANGER.
This intimate association of faith and
finance, this trembling at the designs
of earthly investigators and the child
like confidence in heavenly mercy, will
probably not strike the public with the
same confidence that it hit Frank Mc-
Donald.
as to seem practically simultaneous
with It. The explosion shook the im
mense structure to Its foundations and
was heard several squares from the
Capitol. It occurred in a small room
tightly incldsed by heavy stone walls
in the subterranean basement imme
diately below the main entrance to the
old Capitol building. In this room was
a 600-light gas meter, which was fed
by a four-inch main. Very little gas
is used in that part of the building,
but at the time of the explosion the
gas had not been turned off at the
meter. The meter itself was wrecked
and the gas pouring from the main
caught fire. The flames originating
prom the explosion darted up the shaft
of the elevator, which had been com
pletely destroyed by the force of the
explosion, and communicated with the
record-room of the Supreme Court, the
office of the marshal of the court and
the Supreme Court library. Before the
flames could be subdued the priceless
documents in the record-room had been
almost totally destroyed and serious
damage had been done in the marshal's
office and some minor rooms in the
immediate vicinity.
The library of the Supreme Court, lo
cated immediately beneath the Su
preme Court room, was badly damaged
by fire, smoke and water, practically
destroying the great collection of law
reference books. The library contains
about 20,000 volumes and was used not
only by the Justices of the Supreme
Court, but by members of Congress
and lawyers practicing before the Su
preme Court.
Mr. Justice Harlan said to-night that
the library was very valuable. Many
of the works it contained would, he
thought, be difficult to replace. Li
brarian Clarke, after a cursory ex
amination necessarily made by the
light of lanterns, expressed the opinion
that many of the books could be saved,
although they had been drenched by
water from the streams poured into
the library for two hours or more after
the explosion occurred.
The most serious damage, in the
opinion of the Justices of the Supreme
Court, is to the records stored in the
sub-basement. Theee Included all the
records of cases and opinions rendered
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, NOYEMBEB 7, 1898.
On January 31, 189& eight days after
the foregoing letter was written. Dr.
McDonald was in New York and the
little band of schemers and manipula
tors had already assembled there. W.
H. Eastland, A. F. Johns, M. H. Sher
man, O. T. Dyer and Dr. W. Jenning
son surrounded the old man and began
their flatteries and misrepresentations.
Dr. McDonald had received a letter
from J. E. Farnum, manager of the
People's Bank, and in answer to it,
wrote his son Richard as follows:
I had quite a long letter from Mr.
Farnum. He thinks the changes in
the financial board of the People's
Home Savings Bank were not wise at
the time they were made and gives
several reasons for this view of the
situation and says, among other
things, that there are some Innuendoes
afloat as to the condition of the Pa
cific Bank, and he intimates the pos
sibility pf some danger ahead. He
writes me in a very kind and faithful
manner and I think means truthfully
and well in all he says. Is It not awful
to get Into such a financial condition
as we seem to be at the present time.
Mr. Johns has always expressed the
greatest confidence in getting rid of
the John Brown and Madera property
to advantage and coming out with a
property. I think I would like to give
him $50,000 to insure us out of that dif
ficulty, and that would be the extent of
our loss In the enterprise. I have now
no confidence in the Dyer matter or
the Los Aneeles electric road. Taking
all together the Pacific Bank has the
widest circle and the greatest variety
of business on its hands that I have
ever known. And for your considera
tion and best interest In the future I
will state they never would have hap
pened if there had â  been the proper
confidence, consultation and consid
eration between you and Frank as
well as myself.
THE PURCHASE OF CLARA BELLE'S
DIAMONDS
- â¢-.: At tar, fckfl vrHioar of th c" f nt-eÃaing" let
ter T Dr. McDonald remained for a long
time silent. i .He . had been very ill ; and
was compelled to seek the t relief that
he might find at various resorts. - On
August 9, 1892, he was at ' Catskill, i New
York, and wrote a letter In reference to
the purchase of Clara Belle's Jewels by ;
Dick. The old man did not think well
of the purchase and wrote: /
I see by a telegram in one of ; the
papers here that the Clara Belle jewels
have been sold for a little over $2000
to pay the debts of creditors, and that
you are again probably the purchaser
;' and . hold them. If you are - the pur- -
chaser I hope you will get them out of
your hands or have it understood. that '
you now have no connection with them
as It will attract public attention and
criticism : such as I hope you do not
want if it can be avoided. If you have
the jewels I hope. you will break them
up with little expense into other forms
so as to avoid identification as; much
as possible.
"FARNUM WILL DO AS HE PLEASES
WITH YOU."
On August 17 the old man, who had
returned to New York, again wrote to
Dick as follows:
My Dear Son Richard: I think all
your hobnobbing with Farnum and
Toy will prove a disadvantage. They
will commit you all they can and then
do just as they please, using you as
far as they can carry you. Our bank
by the fathers of judiciary of the Gov
ernment. Apparently the documents
in this room are either totally de
stroyed or so badly damaged by fire
and %-ater as to be useless. Justice
Harlan said that while the loss of the
records was irreparable, it was for
tunate that the later records of the
court, which are kept in the office of
the clerk on the main floor, were not
injured. As documents for reference
at this time and later, Justice Harlan
thought these were of far greater
value than the records destroyed.
Fortunately the clerk's office was not
in the least damaged by fire, and the
explosion aid no damage in It except
to blow one window out.
James McKenney, Clerk of the Su
preme Court, expressed the hope after
making an examination of the old room
that some at least of the documents,
priceless from the view point of the
historian, could be saved. To-night,
however, owing to the inadequate light
ing facilities in that portion of the
building where the explosion and fire
occurred, it was impossible for him to
make an intelligent or thorough inves
tigation of the damage. The Supreme
Court room was damaged principally
by water and smoke, the fire not reach
ing that point. Adjoining the court
room, however, both the marshal's office
and the Senate barber shop furnished
food for the flames.
While many theories are offered as to
the cause of the explosion it seems be
yond doubt to have been due to escap
ing gas. At 5:07 o'clock Lieutenant
Nelson of the Capitol police detected

NEW YORK, Aug. 25, 3893.
MY DEAR SON RICHARD: Mr. Farnum is a narrow-minded, self -conceited, stubborn
man that knows very little except in one particular line, and assumes to know
everything, and one of two things must be done â that he must leave the bank, or submit
to the control of those who are interested and know more about the way of conduct
ing the bank than he does. I say this not to be repeated, but to be acted upon at
the proper time. I put him in the bank to be my servant, so far as his duties are
conoerned, and not to be a tyrannical dictator over me, and that he will soon learn.
True and affectionately, your father,

" FARNUM IS MY SERVANT, NOT MY DICTATOR."
In the conspiracy that ruined the Pacific Bank J. E. Farnum plays a conspicuous part. He was placed In the savings Institution by his cousin, M. H. Sherman,
and while in that capacity he handled the enormous sums that flowed into the People's Bank. As manager of the bank he transferred the deposits to thÂ«
Pacific Bank as soon as thÂ»*y were received. On one occasion he attempted to defy the dictation of the McDonalds, and I>r. R. H. McDonald wrote a let
ter of censure, part of which is given in fac-simile above. In the subsequent developments of the conspiracy Farnum was more tractable and did as he
was told. Under his management the People's Home Savings Bank became absolutely the feeder for the Pacific Bank.
has been saved from ruin and carried
forward with a marvelous success by
the course pursued, and I don't intend
a set of impecunious fellows to run it
into a rut and stunt its gTowth. and
that is just what is being done now.
1 look upon your interest in the
Californian Magazine enterpriseassure
to turn out with a loss, and how much
depends mainly with the length of time
it runs, in my opinion. And you don't
want a disgraceful bankruptcy of it.
the main notoriety and disgrace of
which is sure to fall upon you. If I
could have known yourthoughtslthink
I could have kept you out of it by
showing you its uncertainty and dan
ger, but you do every such thing in
secret. I regard that John Brown
colony business as the most danger
ous affair we now have on hand to
gether with the Bank of Madera.
Frank says he has consented that Mr.
Farnum shall sell some party $50,000
worth of P. H. S. Bank stock and
then make the man president of that.
I am opposed to anything of the kintl
and I want all such pledges declared
off. Neither he or you or any one
else has any right on your own re
sponsibility to make any such ar
rangements and I will insist on being
consulted before any more of the stock
is sold or any other movement of im
portance is entered into. Affection

DR McDONALD'S BITTER DENUN-
CIATION OF J. E FARNUM.
On August 25, 1892, Dr. McDonald
wrote an important letter to his son,
Richard. This document shows clearly

NEW YORK, August 25,: 1892. '
My Dear Son Richard: You say in
one of your letters that the People's
Home Savings Bank statement makes
a fine show, but don't forget, my boy, "
that for nearly a year we have done
â¢ a large amount of, advertising in one ;l
or another form, and to an extent of
$1000 per month, and -to >; that more
than all others combinfed is due the â 
good - showing of the savings bank,
and now that the advertising is
stopped you will see ;â  the ' business is -
running down from week to week, and . I
the cry comes up "hard times and bad
business." Now, bad business Is not
the cause; it is on account of the
stimulant given the bank in the way
of our regular advertisements. And
you - will see, unless attention is paid ..:
to it, we will be in an old rut just the
same as other slow-going banks in our
city. â 'â â¢ And just : about ?as well, s and I
want to prevent that if I can in spite
of the bullhead course that some of
the directors seem disposed "to ; take
and force .upon us on that subject.-.; It
is much easier ;to ; keep the business
going when in a prosperous way than -
it is to let it run down and then com
mence to build- it :up again, and 1 do â 
not want to lose the effect of our mo- v
an odor of gas from the corridor adjoin
ing the Supreme Court room. Not being
able to locate It he proceeded to Statu
ary Hallâ the old hall of the House
of Representativesâ thinking the gas
might be escaping from a burner In
that vicinity. While he was endeavor
ing to locate the escape of the gas the
explosion occurred.
Only a few persons, principally offi
cers of the Capitol police, were In the
building at the time, but several of
them had narrow 6 escapes. Before the
fire department, which responded to
an alarm sent in by a policeman three
squares from the Capitol, had arrived
C. P. Gllem, chief electrician of the
Capitol, and H. W. Taylor, chief en
gineer of the House side, had a stream
playing into the Supreme Court record
room, which by that time was a roar-
Ing furnace. Within a few minutes
after the arrival of the fire department
the flames were under control, although
as a precautionary measure streams
were poured into the marshal's office,
the library and the subterranean base
ment for two hours.
The firemen were unable, however,
for a considerable time to extinguish
the flame of gas which shot out of the
four-inch main In the meter-room.
From this main the fire swept through
an orifice in the basement floor caused
by the explosion and attacked the con
sultation-room of the Supreme Court
Justices on the main floor. Some dam
age was done to the furniture and fit
tings of this room, but it was incon
siderable as compared with that done
elsewhere. The robing-room ,of the
Justices practically escaped damage, j
mentum which we have obtained at so
much cost and energy In the way of
advertising.
Mr. Farnum is a narrow-minded,
self-conceited, stubborn man, that
knows very little except in one partic
ular line and assumes to know every
thing. And one or two things must
be doneâ that he must leave the bank
or submit to the control of those who
are interested and know more
about the way of conducting the bank
than he does. 1 say this not to be re
peated, but to be acted upon at the
proper time. I put him in the bank
to be my servant, so far as his duties
are concerned, and not to be a tyran
nical dictator over me, and that he
will soon learn. True and affection
ately, your father,
r. h. McDonald.
FARNUN HAS MOUNTED THE
THRONE AS A PETTY TYRANT.
In the latter part of the same month
Dr. McDonald wrote another important
letter to his son, Richard, in whih h*>
informed the latter to be on his guard
against Miss Mary Grant, as she was
becoming less and less useful to the
Pacific Bank and it would not be too
wise to talk to her of private affairs.
The doctor also took another fling at
Farnum and the proposed sale of $50,
000 worth of the stock of the People's
Home Savings Bank. The old man
wrote as follows:
Miss Grant, you say, is away on her
â vacation. Sht; is becoming less and
imM to us. Only a small por

;mp> i-ar'num has by his own authority
mounted the throne and attempting to
play the petty tyrant, which can only
last so long, and I hope you will not
allow him to use you for that purpose..
I consider him an honest man, a good
worker, but a narrow-minded bigot
that wants to rule or ruin. I person
ally placed him where he is, and he al
most at a stride assumes to be my
master and defy all my wishes. He
nearly acts like a fool and does not
see the ax over his neck. Mr. Toy is
a man with all the elements of sel
fishness wrapped up in htm, and as
sumes to dictate everything. Now,
these self-assumed dictators must be
and will be regulated some way.
Frank told me that he had agreed
with Farnum that he, F.. might sell
some one. if he could, fifty or one
hundred thousand dollars of the P. H.
S. 8., and such party could become
president of the bank, and that by
and by we would agree to take back
the stock if the purchaser desired to
have us take it back.
Now, what a nonsensical piece of
business that would be to do anything
of the kind. Now, we dont want to
sell any more of that stock except in
small lots, if at all. Second, we don't

' It was evident that the fire could not
be extinguished until the gas from the
main was cut off. That this might be
accomplished the firemen turned two
streams upon the main, choking the
flow of gas and at the same time cool
ing the pipe. Electrician Gliem, brav
ing the Intense heat, entered the mettr
room and shut off the gas at the floor
valve of the main. Throughout the
lower central portion of the old Capitol
building doors, windows and fittings in
common rooms and other apartments
are badly damaged.
Just north of the crypt an archway
almost over the meter-room was com
pletely blown out and masses of ma
sonry were hurled to the ceiling with
such force as to burst the stone and
plaster of the walls above. Ponderous
pieces were wrenched from their places
and throughout the corridors the fres
coing on the ceilings and walls were
utterly ruined. No damage was done
to the main foundations of the building,
as these are of solid masonry, deeply
imbedded and twenty-five feet four
inches thick.
The electrio lighting apartment, In
cluding dynamos, boilers and wir
ings, was not damaged. In order to
enable the firemen to work without
peril from live wires Electrician Gliem
cut off the current from all wires ex
cept one circuit which lighted the
lower western part of the building.

will not be a party to the arrange

Frank to just let matters remain as
they are. We have had enough of
this individual and personal responsi

"CAPTAIN JIM" WANTED TO BE
MAYOR.
In 1892 Captain James McDonald had
a very serious thought that the people
of this city wanted him to be Mayor.
Captain Jim and his brother, the
doctor, were never very good friends in
their later years, and when the x doctor
heard on September 5 that his; brother
did have designs on the position ; now
occupied by the greatest "Hefter" in'
the land, he wrote to Dick as follows: â¢
: "I hope the 'i captain has too much
good sense to allow his name to be used
for Mayor of the city." *: '

LESS SACK. ;â ;â 
If any of the friends of Dr. R. H. Mc-
Donald have I a lingering | hope . or belief
that the old man was ignorant ; of the
condition of his ; bank, the ? following
letter that was written from New York
on September 26, . 1892, will destroy - the
hope and dispel the belief :
My Dear Son Richard: I hope you
â  are doing all that can be done to keep
the Pacific Bank In , a prosperous con
. dition and '; that she may pass . safely :

money in at the top and it is lost be
low, or the tendency Is dangerously that
way. If the bank is not sold I fear it
â¢ will greatly reduce . the value of our
bank. s Now, I hope you will be able to V

Pacific Bank and that it may come out-

remains of George Washington burned
brilliantly.
Among the losses which wia be most
sincerely regretted are those of busts
of Chief Justice 'Marshall and other
distinguished members of the Supreme
Court, which were arranged on small
pedestals about the Supreme Court
chamber. In the smoke and ruin which
followed the explosion these invaluable
works of art were either badly dam
aged or who. .j destroyed, and with
their destruction the country has suf
fered an irreparable loss. Many of
them have been treasured exhibits in
the Supreme Court chamber for half a
century.
The Capr 1 building has been dam
aged a number of times before by nre,
but it is believed to-night's nre will
prove to be the most disastrous in the
history of the building. On two occa
sions prior to this fires have been start
ed by explosions of gas. Seventeen
years ago a large amount of damage
was done to the same part of the build
ing by an explosion of this kind, and
in 1876 there was an explosion of gas
that killed two men and came near
killing another.
No intelligent estimate of the money
loss by the explosion and fire can be
made yet. In the opinion of the Capitol
officers and mechanics who examined
the structure to-night the loss will
reach probably $200,000 to the building.
The lobs on the library and records,
as stated above, can scarcely be esti
mated in dollar^ and cents. A million

'â YOU WILL REMEMBER THE
LESSON ALL YOUR LIFE"
If the foregoing letter was not
evidence enough that Dr. McDonald
was fearful of returing to San Fran
cisco and knew thoroughly the condi
tion of his banks here, the following
epistle will prove it:
NEW YORK, Oct 5, 1592.
My Dear Son Richard: You must
not expect much of me at i^e present
time, but, as you are doubtless aware,
I am keenly alive to all that is going oa
in San Francisco. My boy, keep the
Pacific Bank intact and going on safely
if you can, and if you can get out of
this complex condition of business
mistakes and the present embarrassed
condition of affairs you will have
learned a lesson that may prove of
value to you the remainder of your
life, even if it has cost you a fine for
tune to gain that experience. Affec
tionately your father,
r. h. McDonald.
-YOU WILL KILL THE GOOSE THAT
LAYS THE GOLDEN EGG."
On October 10, 1892, Dr. McDonald
wrote a letter to ; his son, Richard, i in.
which he shows that ;he had not yet
reached : the - point of ; distrusting O. T.
Dyer, who was 'in â  New York trying to
negotiate ' unnegotiable - securities.

NEW YORK, Oct. 10, 18M.
My Dear Son Richard: From all I
can learn from Frank and others,
Dyer seems to be hustling here to get
money in one and another way, and
from the talk has a prospect of having
returns soon. The best thing, it seems
to me, is to let him alone, or you will
kill the groose laying the golden egg.
Of course, there is a point beyond
which this cannot go. I know
this to be a very vexatious and
dangerous debt we have against him,
and one most unwise for us to ever
have gotten into; but the management
on the part of Dyer has been most in
sidious and well planned to bring it
to what it is now. Affectionately your
father, R. H. McDONALD,
To-morrow morning The Call will
continue the publication of the letters
of Dr. R. H. McDonald, and will show,
to the public what the old man thought
of the schemes and the schemers that
had ruined the two institutions of
which he was the founder and the
leading spirit. In these letters the old
man discusses with a pathetic bitter
ness of spirit the private affairs of
himself and his family and the terrible
wreck of his fortune that came to him
after he had passed three score and
ten. These letters, associated as they
are with the wreck of two great insti
tutions, are of primary public impor
tance.

HAVANA, Cuba, Nov. 6.â The yellow
fever situation here is causing great
anxiety among the American officials.
The increasing number of cases, the
majority of which are of a serious na
ture, has alarmed the entire American
colony, and the announcement to-day
of two new victims caused the alarm
to develop to almost the character of
a panic. The disease apparently is
spreading rapidly and Is not confined
to the Vldado district, where Captains
Foraker and Beebe were stricken.
The outbreak of the disease in the
quartermaster's department has tem
porarily disorganized the work of the
office, which has charge of the erection
of camps and making preparations for
the reception of troops. As matters
now stand, it scarcely seems possible
to get them ready by December 15, tha
latest approximate date yet named.
Colonel Smith of the Commissary
Department, who arrived yeÃterday,
took charge of the chief quarter
master's office this morning in place of
Colonel vVilliams, now ill.
Immune nurses especially are re

isolation hospital. Dr. Lalne regards
the situation as grave. The conditions

meetings in the latter city to-night.
Maior McLaughlln and his associates of
the Republican State Committee enjoyed
a day's rest yesterday and will be ready
for active duty early this morning. 'Apart
from completing arrangements for city
and interior mass meetings to be held
this evening very little business was
transacted yesterday at party headquar

the Saturday night demonstrations all
over the State were remarkable for attend
ance and enthusiasm. Under the auspices
of the State organization forty mass
meetings were addressed by able and elo
quent exponents of Republican doctrine.
Other meetings arranged by local author
ity were also held. The State is ablaze
with Republican enthusiasm from the
mountains to tl â¢ sea. If the people vote
as they shout the victory to-morrow will
be the greatest Republican triumph ever
achieved in California.
To-night at Saratoga Hall in this city
under the auspices of the Continental

meeting in behalf of Gage and Ned and
Patton. The speakers announced are
General W. H. L. Barnes, Senator George

Able and eloquent speakers will address
the audience.
A TRIBUTE TO LOTJD.
His Efforts in Behalf of Labor Appre
ciated in the East.
That Congressman Eugene F. Loud is a
friend of labor no one has ever ques
tioned. Workingmen throughout the
length of the coast have long given their
support to Mr. Loud, and now from the
East comes the news that his labors in
behalf of labor have been recognized and
appreciated. This fact is manifest from
a letter received by Edward Johnston
prominent in Grand Army circles, which
follows:
Beneath the Shadow of Historic Dorchester
Heights. South Boston, Mass., Oct. 27, IS9S.
Comrade Edward Johnston. Colonel Thomas
Cn?s l'"St, G. A. R., Californiaâ Friend John
ston: 1 have Just learned of the nomination
for re-election of Hon. Eugene F. Loud to Con-
Ikh from your state.
1 regret exceedingly that I am not a citizen
',of tiif? district ir. California recreÃented in
Congress by Mr. Loud, for if I were it would
afford me great pleasure to battle and vote
for one who is referred to by Bostonians as
"one of nature's noblemen."
Congressman Loud of California by his tire
less efforts, suberb legislation and brilliant
record in Congress in behalf of the plain peo
ple, not alone of his own glorious State of
California, but of every State in the Union,
won the esteem, respect and admiration of
millions ol American citizens.
Twenty-nine years a Democrat in every sense
of the name, loyal to the party and its prin
ciples, yet with all the courage of my convic
tions, friendship for my fellow man and admir
ation for public men who stand for their less
fortunate brothers in the struggle for exist
ence and try to make life easier and happier
for the toiler. I would cheerfully vote for and
urge others to vote for such a man. I am in
formed that Congressman Loud Is one above
class. I care not what his political faith is or
may be, I only know that when a perfect
t-tranger to him I recently appealed to him to
"B n to the front" and stand by. a citizen of
jgan Francisco, Ca!., who in years long past
ftn-1 gone forever "stood by me. " when blessed
with youth, health and strength. I wore Colum
bia'a navy-bluo, as one of the "men who stood
behind the runs. " when Admiral Dewey was
only a commander in the service which to-day
in efficiency is second to none. Cnnnretsnian
Lend granted the request respectfully solic
its hv me. He went "straight to the front."
and my gratitude prompts me to pen you these
liifes. houins they may prove inter*>stlnK to
you and to your frienus on the golden sands
of sunny California. If you live in Mr. Loud's
district you will do me a prent fÂ«*vor by voting
for and urging other citizens td vote for him.
to the end that merit, manhood, ability and
patriotism as represented and disalaved by
Hm. Eugene F. Loud may continue to reflect
credit on the State he so nobly und faithfully
represents in Coneress. Believe me to be ever

A FAIR COUNT IS ASSURED.
AT every ballot box in the city when the count of the vote begins on
Tuesday evening, there will be two vigilant watchers on hand to see
that there is no mistake made in the returns on the Republican
ticket. This decision was arrived at last evening at a meeting of the
presidents of the numerous Republican clubs of the city, held at the quar
ters of the Union League. At th* last meeting of the Affiliated Clubs a
committee of seven was appointed to inquire into plans made by the State
and county committees for a careful supervision of the ballot, and last
evening it was reported that the State committee had already organized
its force of watchers but that, owing to a depleted treasury the county
committee had decided not to take this necessary precaution. It was im
mediately moved and carried that the affiliated clubs furnish two men from
their ranks for each precinct to assume the duty free of any cost, and to
proffer this assistance to the county committee.
Chairman Reuff of that body was caught by telephone and upon behlf
of his committee accepted and thanked the patriotic club men for their
bmtl; offer, and he promised Vi provide necessary passes and badges.
'Jo day the presidents of the different organ 'Uitions will call for volunteers
from their ranks and from all other bources to do active duty. In fact
th>? call has been already made in the folli-fving resolution which was
I assed last evening at the sug^33tioa of Chairman A. O. Perkins. Frank
If. Robinson was selected as the captain of the watchers, and all of
those who are sufficiently patriotic to volunteer in the protective measure
mapped out will find him to-morrow at the State committee headquar
ters on the first floor of the Palace Hotel.
AH Republicans desirous of having a fair count of the ballots to be east at Tues
day's election, anil to that end willing to volunteer their services at the polls in
the various precincts during the progress of the count, are respectfully requested to
caJl or communicate with the undersigned committee at the Republican State Cen

assignments, passes and badges. Telephone number. Main 6080.

CYCLOID FINISH
ALAMEDA POLITICIANS SPENT
A BUSY SUNDAY.
Republicans Concentrating Their Ef
forts in J. B. Talcott's Fight
for Supervisor.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 6.â Politics was at
fever heat In Alameda to-day. All sorts
of rumors were afloat. There were stories
of combinations, of backsliding, of knif
ing and everything else that absorbs the
attention of the politicians. The Repub
licans and Democrats held caucuses all
day and In all sections of the city, and
they have completed plans for a fight
next Tuesday which, from present Indica
tions, will be the liveliest election in
which the voters of Alameda have ever
participated.
The managers of the Stoddard cam
paign were In session nearly all day. They
appear satisfied with the light thus far,
and claim that the reports from all sec
tions of the county are most encouraging.
J. B. Lanktree is leading the Alameda
forces of Frank Jordan. He has matters
well in hand and is exerting every effort
to pull the Republicans into line for their
regular nominee for County Clerk.
In the eastern section of town the Re
publican workers are concentrating their
efforts in the supervisorial contest. They
are making what they call a cyclone fin
ish in behalf of J. R. Talcott. and are
confident of sending him out of Alameda
with the largest majority ever given a
candidate for Supervisor from the Second
District. D. W. Martin, Dr. C. L. Tis
dale and E. R. Anthony are managing
the canvas.*.
The Republican meeting at Hnclnal Hall
last evening was an enthusiastic affair. It
was purely a gathering of club members,
nnd over 150 were in attendance. J. R.
Knowland, Hy Morris, E. K. Taylor. J.
B. Barber and Lin Church were the
speakers.
The final Republican rally of the cam

TO AFRO -AMERICANS.
A Card Issued That Is of More Than
Passing Interest to Colored
Voters.
The following card has been Issued to
Afro-American voters:
The conditions 'which' prevail at this time are
precisely similar to those which obtained four
years ago during the Estee-Budd campaign.
Then two uncertain factors determined and
decided the issue,. viz., the A. P. A. and the
Afro-American vote. An effort has been made
to repeat the same political tacticsâ the alien
ation of the negro vote because of some imagin
ary grievance. We are again requested to do
some dirty work for foxy Democratic poli
ticians. The religious controversy has been
reopened. Former enemies are now friends,
and vice versa. Seeing, then, that the fate of
any candidate may hinge on a few hundred
votes, it behooves us to realize who our friends
are What can we expect In the -event of
Democratic success? Mr. Magulre represents
an element which is our natural enemyâ the
foreign anarchistic element, the enemy of all
law and order.
The leaders "of the Republican party in this
State are misinformed concerning the number
of Afro-Americans registered. Many -"^.us ;

identity on election day. For the first. "m? in
several years we are permitted to cast t "'U

again barter our political birthright for the
empty husks of Democratic promises.

A Cow With Four Calves.
The wonderful cow who, with her
four heifer calves, is now attracting bo
wide attention among cattle fanciers,
wag raised by Christian Blystone of
Cambridge Springs, Pa., and owned by
him up to a short time after giving
birth within a few hours to four heifer
calves. The calves were born May 6,
1897, and were sir^d by a Shorthorn
bull. The mother is half Holstein and
half Durham, showing the size and
build of the Durham and color of the
Holstein. At present she is eight years
old, and weighs 1360 pounds in fair con
dition. After the birth of the calves
she gave sufficient milk to raise all of
them up to weaning time. Throughout
the winter the calves had a light feed
of grain, and at 364 days of age the
combined weight of the four was 1860
pounds, there being not ten pounds dif
ference in their individual weights. At
present they weigh just about 2000
pounds, and are as large as the aver
age yearling. So near alike are they in
all particulars that those who are best
acquainted with them cannot tell one
from another. In color they are a light
red. yellowish shade, each having only
a little white spot on the belly, with no
other marks, and never did four ani
mals have features and dispositions
more nearly alike. On March 15 they
were purchased by their present owner,
W. L. Mitchell of Erie County, Pa., who
is exhibiting this wonderful quartet at
the New England fairs this fall.â

FATE OF THE SQUAW MEN.
The squaw men must go. This painful
conclusion has finally been reached by the
Dawes Commission at Ardmore, Indian
Territory. Indian Agent Wisdom has
been ordered to eject them. From the
point of view of the squaw men, this
edict is harsh. A squaw man, be it un
derstood, is a white man who marries
an Indian maiden and settles upon her
property. Twenty thousand of them have
done just this thjng and have raised 50,000
children, half Indian and half squaw
man, to rise up and call them blessed.
The civilized tribes of Indian Territory
are. according to their wealth per capita,
among the richest people in the world.
Before the war they owned negro slaves,
and although the war freed them, it was
not until recently that they could be
coerced by Washington into giving them
the right, to vote. But the squaw men
could vote. The squaw man is wise in
hid generation. He married the Indian
girl, got admitted to the tribe as an In
dian and acquired citizenship, with all its
privileges, and so has become a formid
able element in the voting- population of
the Indian tribes. Being* a squaw man
ha 3 now become a regular profession or
industry in the Western States, with a
kind of trades union or squaw man as
sociation to protect their rights. Their
walking delegates, however, were caught
napping this time, and a man's enemies
are they of his own household. For it is
the Dawes Commission and not the In
dians themselves who will drive them out
of this good land, whither they have gone
to possess It, and which they trusted that
every place whereon the soles of their
feet should tread should be theirs.
The property of the squaws is in land
and funds held by the United States Gov
ernment, and if the squaw men are to be
driven out they will be at a distinct dis
advantage as compared with the squaw
men who come over from Europe and
marry wives in New York and then go
back home with wives, property and all. â

AN AMERICAN PTJPIL.
Pupils are a fruitful source of amuse
ment. I once had an American pupil who
refused point blank to do a single thing I
told her. She knew everything far bet
ter than I did. and talked in the most
scientific way about the structure of her
hands, which, as far as I could see, dif
fered In no way from those of any one
else. I humbly suggested that it wasn't
necessary to be a professor of anatomy
in order to teach-Chopin's nocturnes. But
my remark made no impression whatso
ever. I have never been so thoroughly
snubbed in my life. I was, however, to
have my revenge. One day she arrived
at my house rather earlier than usual,
and began looking over my books. Among
those lying on the table was a volume of
poems by Matthew Arnold, which he had
given me himself, and in which he had
written a few very charming words of
dedication. /
As I came into the room she addressed
me in a voice in which I thought I de
tected a tone of disrespect hitherto con
spicuous by its absence. "Well, I never!"

CYCLISTS AS SPORTSMEN.
The wheelman himself can hardly be
held answerable for the death of a rab
bit which bolted into Ms machine -as it
stood by the roadside, and broke its neck;
and there was contributory negligence,
as the lawyers say, on the part of the
cat which tried to go through the wheel
of a passing bicycle, and gave the rider
a bad fall at the cost of its own life.
Much more noteworthy than either of
these was the achievement of a cyclist
who, while scorching along the road (he
must have been scorching) ran into a
covey of partridges and killed one, his
wheel passing over its neck. The only
way in which this curious accident can
be explained is to suppose that the birds
were "dusting" at a bend in the road,
and that the cyclist's approach, concealed
by the hedges, remained undetected till
the enemy was literally among them.â
Chambers' Journal.
WHEN THE FISH LIAR WAS HIM
SELF.
They are not as iively down among the
Kingston and Rondout fish yarners this
season as usual. The only pretense of tell
ing a big fish lie made there is about a
little boy named Arthur Guber, wno was
fishing in Rondout Creek, and caught an
eel so big that it nearly pulled the boy
off the pier. A man went to his aid,
pulled four feet of eel out of the water
and then the line broke. Think of it!
The line broke and the eel got away!
Why, when the Rondout Creek fish liar
was himself and felt good that eel would
have pulled the boy into the creek and
swam down the Hudson, and towed the
boy across to the east shore, where he
would have tied him to a tree, taken his
jackknlfe out of his little pocket, and
after extracting the hook from its jaw)
would have gone wriggling back to tell
the boy's father where he was, and offer
to tow a boat across for a dollar and a
half.â Albany Argus.

LONDON, Nov. 6.â The military au

largest naval arsenal in Great Britain,
received orders to-day for the immedi
ate mobilization of all the troops in the
western district. The defense com
mittee will meet to-morrow.
The Dally Chronicle this morning

return to France with his expedition
from Fashoda by way of Jibutil, on the
Gulf of Aden, "the only route con

MIND BEADING IN COLORADO.
The practice of mind reading landed J.
E. George in the County Jail.
'Judge,' suid George, "I am an expert
mind reader and have fully mastered the
subject of mind over matter. Recently I
i went into St. Mary's Cathedral, on Stout
street, to test my mental organs, which
: are continually under a high tension.
\\ hen I went in there was a man stand
ing and I saw at a glance that he expect
ed that I was going- to attempt to rob the
box on the wall, which was labeled 'For
the poor,' in which people drop their con
tributions. My insight into that man's
mind was as clear as a glass; I could see
that he was saying to himself, 'George is
going to rob the box.'
"When I had fully convinced myself
! that my judgment and mind reading were
I all right, I walked up to the box and
! dropped a piece of paper in. That was
done simply to see what effect it would
have on the mind of the man who was
watching me between his fingers. When
I dropped the paper in I read what he
thought. It was: 'George < commencing
to roD the box.' Then some other people.
two wemen and a man, came in, ana
right away I saw that they, too, believed
that I intended to steal what was in tne
box. Of course, it is more difficult to
read the minds of four people at once, as,
â  in such cases, matter being present in
I such superior force, has a great advan
j tage. So on this account, I had to repeat
I the experiment at the box in order to pam
I control of the four minds that were com
:â¢ bating mine.
"Then, just before I had gained com
! plete control of the situation, the police
man came in and placed me under ar
rest. It was not right to do so, from a
humanitarian standpoint, and, in addition,
it seemed a very Interesting experiment.
I^ad not the interference been made when
h mim my scientific knowledge might have
j been greatly increased. Yes, you might
! call it self-hypnotism, but in general
j terms my specialty may be termed the
i victory of mind over matter."
"How about the story that you went
into a restaurant a short time ago and
i ate a big meal -without being able to pay
i for it?"
"That's true. Judge: that's true; I of
ten do that. It can only be accounted for
in this way. When I eat fruit it takes
control of me and creates a phenomenal
j appetite. More than that, fruit is strong
â  er in its action than my mind, so you may
! depend on it that when I go into a place
; and eat a big meal without paying for it,
I I had been eating fruit before.
"Judge, George is not my right name.
I My relatives in the East are among the
aristocracy, so I conceal my identity.
What do you think should be done to me,
Judge?"
"Thirty days," said" Justice Reynolds.
THE VALUE OF GREAT CITIES TO
STATES.
I desire to call the attention of the
farmer or countryman to a fact that
many have never thought -of, v;h!ch
may tend to abate their hostility toward
the' cities. It is this, to wit: While it is
impossible for a rich and prosperous
farming country to surround a city with
out contributing to the prosperity of said
city, yet it is possible for a city to be lo
cated within the borders of a State and
grow to be rich,, prosperous and large,
and to add great value to the lands
around and to the State without receiv
ing a corresponding- value from the coun
try of said State. In fact, such is always
the case where the city is large.
For instance, the great city of New
York is not indebted to the country or
farm lands of New York for one-hun
dredth of her prosperity and wealth. She
reaps her wealth not only from all the
States of the Union, but from all the
civilized 1 parts of the world; yet she does
not contribute a dollar to the payment
of current expenses and State debt of
any State in the Union, or an-y part of
the world, except the State of New York.
She gives in her Immense wealth to be
taxed solely for the State of New York,
thereby relieving each and every farmer
in the State. St. Louis reaps a majority
of her prosperity from other States than
Missouri. New Orleans reaps four-flftha
of her prosperity from other States than

MODEL CAUCASUS ROBBERS.
The Tlflis journals are warning tour
ists against traveling in the Caucasus,
and especially lr the Transcaucasus
without an armed escort. On August M
nine highwaymen held possession or
the small ravine Gasluch, m the nelKh
borhood of Adshikend. The leader of
this band was a Tartar. RabiNadshas-
Ogly, and from 5 o'clock in the aftei
noon until 7:30 the robbers ;, he ; ld ww u P
every carriage and vehicle that went
along that narrow defile and quietly
took from the occupants money and
valuables. Five members of the band,
armed with Peabody revolvers and long
daggers, and clad in the costume of the
Khirgese, were told olf to examine the
unfortunate travelers. They were very
courteous to the ladies, and examined
the men only. The leader was especi
ally courteous, and took great pains to
see that the ladies were not robbed; la
fact he even went so far as to restore
to several husbands their valuables on
the entreaties of their wives.
During the two hours and a nail tn*
robbers got possession of 2000 roubles
and a great quanity of valuable ob
jects, for in that time they had stop
ped a dozen vehicles of different kinda
and had plundered nearly fifty persons.
The Caucasus Journal expresses as
tonishment at the cowardice of the vie-
Mnies, among whom there were many
strong men who had revolvers and
other weapons with them. A coachman
was the only one who wished to offer
resistance, but he alone could not do
much, and he. was pulled off his box
seat and soundly cudgeled. As the as
sistant of a chief of police drove up
with his wife and child and learned
what was going on he seized his re
volver and wished to fire at the rob
bers He was at once stopped by crlea
of "Don't shoot, for heaven's sake; you
will hit some of the women and chil
dren " and a man rushed forward, and.
snatching the weapon from the assist
ant's hand, hid it, so that the robbers
might not see that he had intended to
fire upon them. wÂ«*
None of the vehicles "held up" by the
robbers was allowed to proceed on ita
way. At last a lady traveling in a car
riage with her husband and two little
children grew tired of the long delay
and approached the chief of the robbers
with the prayer that he would let them
continue on their journey. The latter
drew his watch from his pocket and re
plied' "Wait, please, for another fif
teen minutes; by that time I expect two
more carriages. We will just look over
them and then we will let you all go
c-n your various ways." In a few min
utes the carriages appeared, and after
they had been overhauled by the high
waymen the chief said to his victims:
"Now you are all free and can continue
your journeys, but first of all we will
make our escape." They quickly
mounted their horses and at once dis
appeared.

HENRY T. GAGE WILL BE ELECTED GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA, Because-
He is not a fanatic.
He believes in law, order and the equality of rights, which make this nation great.
He believes in his party, his country and his countrymen, and will be Governor for
the whole people, knowing no rich nor poor, but justly executing the law for all.
He believes in the vested right and title oi every man to the land ana
home he has earned and owns.
He believes in California, in ,the protection of the fruits of her vine
yards, orchards and fields; in the unity of her territory, the goodness of
her people and the greatness of her destiny.
He believes in the laborer's right to freedom of contract, to the
highest wages, paid in the best money in the world.
He believes that when the honest miner has dug coal, iron, gold, silver, copper
and quicksilver from his own mine that it belongs to him and not to the community.
He believes that anarchy is not love of liberty, but lust of license and of murder,
and that anarchists have no right of asylum in this republic.
The people of California believe these things with Henry T. Gage. They want
progress and prosperity instead of experiment and unrest, and they will elect him Gov
ernor to secure that sound sense in the administration which means stability in the
State.

The Call several days ago wired the
chairmen of the respective county cora-

cratic â throughout the State asking for
conservative estimates as to the prob
able vote for Governor of. California on
November 8.
The figures given below are the esti
mated probable majorities given by the
chairmen of the Republican commit
tees. The Democrats, although in a
great many cases expressing their con
fidence that Maguire will be elected,
would not venture estimates in suffi
cient numbers to permit of a table be
ing prepared.
As is shown by the table. Mr. Gase
will doubtless come to San Francisco !
with a majority of not less than 14,000
votes. A great mam- Republican lead
ers express their belief that Mr. Gaere
will carry this city and county and
those who are not so sanguine do not
concede more than 2500 majority to Mr. ;
Maguire. It would appear that there
is no good reason to doubt that Mr.
Gage will be elected by a majority be

BIG CROWDS AT THE PARK.
Willard Jidston Injured in a Run
away â Fun at Sutro's Baths.
An immense crowd, in -which hosts of
politicians mingled, assembled at the
city's pleasure grounds yesterday. Al
though there was a slight chili in the air
that stimulated the people to keep mov
ing, the space around the band stand was
packed with those willing to suffer a lit
tle discomfort on the benches In order to
escape none of tne numbers on the pro
gramme,
The ,cars running to the Cliff House
were, as usual, overcrowded, and it is re
markable that no serious accident oc
curred. There was one accident that re
sulted painfully for Willard Jidston, son
of Captain Jidston of Alameda. Captain
Jidston, with his son seated by his side,
was driving a spirited team out on Bal
boa boulevard, when the team took
fright, became unmanageable and ran
away. Young- Jidston became frightened
and jumped from the buggy, sustaining
painful scalp wounds and a badly con
tused arm. He was found by one of the
mounted police and removed to the Park
Hospital, where his wounds were dressed.
After the injured boy leaped from the
buggy Captain Jidston redoubled his ef
forts to regain mastery over the mad
dened animals, but did not succeed until
after a distance of over two miles had
been covered. He managed to keep the
team in the middle of the rpaa until it
became tired out with its own efforts and
then it was stopped. Captain Jidston
then drove back to the hospital and took
his son home.
The usual crowds assembled at the
Chutes and Sutro's Baths. Following are
the results of the aquatic contests given
at the latter resort:
Four hundred yard dashâ Won by J. Ben
son, X. Benson second. 100-yard dash â
"Won by , E. Bonifleld. A. Hay sec

OUR CHRISTIAN MISSION.
Rev. William Rader ? s IMscourse at
the Third CongTegafional
Church.
In a discourse last evening on "The
Christian Mission of Our Country" Rev.
TVilliam Rader of the Third Congrega
tional Church, took his text from the
third chapter of Revelation of
John, eighth verse: "Behold I have set
before thee an open door, and no man
can shut it."
"The question that now confronts us, as
a people and a church," he said, "be
comes a gospel theme, as important as
any biblical theme.
"The mission of the United States is
found in its origin and inception. We
came here for a p.urpose â seeking refuge
from certain persecutions in the < >;â !
Worldâ and have been accepting people?
ever since. We have made a business <if
liberty; of establishing self-government,
the principles of popular liberty, of df-m â 
ocracy; and have measurably succeeded.
We have had some civil war â out of
which came a clearer sky and the belief
that democratic principles are feasible
and right."
The question of Larger America, the
speaker discussed under three headings:
Imperialism, expansion and the Monroe
doctrine â the latter being characterized as
an anchor idea, holding us to the past
as well as present.
"The planting of the Union Jack and
Stars and Stripes side by side," said the
speaker, "is a great motive for conquest â
for imperialism."
LITE OF JOSEPH.
Rev. John A. B. Wilson's Sermon at
the Howard- Street M. E. Church.
At the Howard-street M. E. Church last
evening Rev. John A. B. Wilson took for
his theme "The Life of Joseph."
"It is bad when we get depending on
each other," he said. "Better have faith
in Godâ have him our primary object of
dependence. I would say to you young
men, you cannot always choose your com
panionship, but you have always got to
live with yourself. See that you have the
kind of company that your soul can afford
to keep forever. There is no cultivation
that has been found or ever will be found
to make a rosebuÃh out of a fern; the
more you cultivate it the more fern you
have. The outcome is going to be accord
ing to your sowing. If you sow unwor
thily â of the flesh â you are going to reap
corruption. There is a consequence to
every act, which we cannot escape. No
act is insignificant â no thought; there is
a sequence growing out of everything you
do. I telL you a wise thing to do: When
you find you are doing wrong, stop. Grap
ple with your nature. If you can't do it
now, how can you do it when it is
stronger? The thing's you can't do now
you are adding to make harder. Don't
add another faggot to the bundle that Is
already too heavy for you to carry
about."

against his inclination.
â¢'We were married yesterday after

orated yesterday afternoon by the mem
bers of the Calvarian Society. The serv
ice consisted of the recital of the Litany,
the "Way of the Cross" and a sermon by
Rev Father Ramm. who took as his
subject "The Aftor Life." ......
In addition to the several hundred mem
bers of the society present the church
was crowded with people from all sec
tions of the city.
Noted Pickpocket Arrested.
The police believe that yesterday Harry
Elmore lurnished them with evidence suf
ficient to hold him in the meshes of the
law and to insure him a trip to San Quen
tin. Elmore is a noted pickpocket and
has often been arrested, but in each in
stance has been released for want of suf
ficient evidence. Yesterday afternoon,
while riding on a. Guerrero street car,
Mrs. Malcolm, residing at 205 Turk street,
saw Elmore take a purse from the pocket
of her sister, Mrs. Johnson. She raised
a cry and the thief jumped from the car,
but was captured later by Officer J. W.
Stanley. Upon being searched the $9 con
tained in the purse was found upon his
person, and the purse, which he had dis
carded in his flight, was picked up behind
a fence.
Y. M. C. A. Bulletins.
The special wire of the Western Union
Telegraph Company running Into the aud
itorium of the Young Men's Christian As
sociation, corner of Mason and Ellis
streets, is putting the complimentary
tickets of admission in great demand.
While the special operator is capturing
the news, a delightful programme of
music and elocution will fill the interim.
The Knickerbocker Quartet, the Columbian
Orchestra, Miss Frances Luse, elocution
ist, and Brownlee Newton, the popular
reader and impersonator, will be some of
the attractions.
Heinrichs at the Orpheum.
To-morrow afternoon there will be a
Heinrich recital at the Orpheum, the first
special matinee ever given at this thea
ter. Max Heinrich, barytone; Mrs. Hein
rich, soprano, and Miss Julia Heinrich,
contralto, are the best ballad singers ever
heard in San Francisco, and as the prices
are popular the house should be packed.
Twenty-three numbers will be sung, and
the selections will range from "Polly
Willis " by Dr. Arne, to the "Erl King,"
by Liszt. On this occasion no smoking
will be allowed.
Home From Their Honeymoon.
Mr. and Mrs. Frank W. Fuller returned
to this city last night from their honey

JAMES G. MAGUIRE WILL BE DEFEATED FOR GOVERNOR OF CALIFORIA, Because-
He is a fanatic.
He believes that a land owner is a monopolist and a robber, and declares that he
must be deprived of all vested rights, titles and ownership in his home and land with
out compensation.
lie believes that coal, iron, gold, silver, copper and quicksilver should be given to
the community, and don't belong to the mine owner and miner.
He believes that anarchists and nihilists are patriotic and worthy and should not be
excluded from this country, though their official platform is : "Down with all govern
ment. Do what you wish. Everything is everybody's."
He has bolted in and out of all parties, has lived in office since he was 19 and has
drawn from the taxpayers salaries equal to $4 50 per day for every day since he was
born. His sole return to the taxpayers who have supported him has been the threat
to confiscate land and abuse of its owners.
His claim for votes is that he opposed the law to settle the debts of the Central
Pacific road, which was drawn by Senators White and Morgan. But should any Re
publican vote for Maguire because Senator White voted for that funding measure? and
should any Democrat vote for Maguire because he opposed Senator White?
Neither good Republicans nor good Democrats, nor good Populists, nor land owners,
nor miners, nor wage earners can vote for Maguire. Therefore he will be beaten, and
great will be the benefit of his defeat to the State and to principles, to genuine reforms
and straight politics.
THE MANLY CAMPAIGN
OF CHARLES L. PATTON
He Has Made a Clean, Honest, Open Fight
and Won the People's Con
fidence.
His Many Admirable Qualities Have Gained Him Widespread
Popnlarity, and the Signs of the Times
Point to Him as the
Victor.
After an exciting campaign, the battle
of the ballots will be waged to-morrow.
During several weeks the contest has la.
vored the Republicans in a marked man
ner. The party has made steady gains,
the leaders and candidates are confident
of success and the Republican hosts will
go to the polls In better condition than
fur many years. They are In full harm
ony, and will oppose an enemy that lias
been divided by the trickery and despot
ism of the plug hat boss who has usurped
the rights of the party and boldly jioses
as the whole Democracy, heading a ticket
that was not named by the Democrats of
this city but by a clique of Job-chasers
who saw no other way to secure nomina
tions.
As against the campaign of deceit made
by Mayor Phelan the voters of San Fran
cisco should consider the manner in which
Charles L. Patton comes before the people
and how hp has conducted himself in this
contest. He has made a clean, manly,
energetic campaign, indulging in no per
sonalities, resorting to no innuendoes, but
plainly and honestly telling the public his
ideas as to how the city government
should be conducted, standing for the dol
lar limit of taxation, for the charter and
for strict business methods In the office
HALL CAINE ON THE AMERICAN
SOLDIER.
"Personally I have always contended
that even we. your cousins, greatly un
derestimated your fighting strength and
I never hesitated to state that opinion.
When the war excitement that followed
the Venezuelan trouble had so died out
!n London that arbitration began to be
mentioned, and when a great meeting
was held for that purpose in Queen s
Hall there I drew some criticism upon
myself by remarking that America was
by far better equipped for a brief strug
gle than the maternal Government. Not
only had a free mflitary system of cadet
schools and volunteer militia given a
great deal of necessary training, but the
democratic principles of the land had
more than doubled the Individual value
of army and navy. While I have noted
in Russia and elsewhere that men who
have absolutely no reason for loving,
their fatherland are still imbued strongly
with that mysterious emotion known as
patriotism, no doubt can exist that the
soldier who is risking his life for things
that he understands and that appeal to
him directlyâ the soldier who may be
come as high in position as the highest
of his commandersâ will fight as no other
recruit can. And the results of the late
war have proved the foundation of my
belief This has been tf contest in which
personal bravery and individual heroism
have* discounted even the superb work of
the army and navy as a whole.
"England Is not prepared for the emer
gencies so well as might seem to be the
case with the casual observer. Only ex
perts can tell of the power of her navy
and her armament, but that she lacks
the impromptulty of the United States, de
aplte her standing force, there can be no
doubt. I believe in the unity of the two
countries almost above everything else."

He believes that $861,000,000 of property in land values and loans se

of Mayor. If elected he will not pursue
the tactics of shirking the responsibility
of passing upon important public improve
ments and leaving it to the Board of
Supervisors, as is the practice or Mr.
Phelan. who has shown that he has nei
ther the veto courage or the backbone to
perform his duties as the chief executive
of the municipality.
Another feature of the campaign is the
significant fact that in all this heated
contest there has not been one word
breathed against Mr. Patton's Integrity,
his ability and energy, his private or
public character. He stands before his
felow citizens as capable, honest and up
right a man as could be found.
That these matters are appreciated by
the voters has been proved by the en
thusiastic reception of the man during
thÂ« arduous and admirable campaign he
has made." The further fact that he has
nut been Mayor of the city and made him
s. !f .1 czar, using his official power to rob
his fellows of their rights under the consti
tution in order to stuff a ticket in his own
interests has given him great strength
among those citizens who believe In and
demand from their public servants hon
esty and Justice.
Finally, a vote for Mr. Patton la a vote
against "a combination of job-chasers who,
if elected, will have the city at their
mercy and be in a position to perpetuate
themselves in office Indefinitely.

THE HUMORIST RETREATED.
In a group of lawyers who were dili
gently smoking cigars, sat a mild-ap
pearing youth puffing a cigarette, says
the GJaicago Journal.
"Janitor, will you kindly open the
window?" called the reputed wit of the
little company. "I think I smell a cig
arette."
The lawyers grinned appreciatively
and the youth made a visible effort to
appear oblivious.
"A man was arrested the other day
for blowing smoke in a Horse's face."
began the legal humorist, winking at
his audience and speaking in a voice
evidently intended for the cigarette
smoker.
"The Judge who heard the case said
there was no law against such an act,
and was about to throw the case out
of court. v
" 'But,' exclaimed the complainant,
'it was cigarette smoke, your Honor,'
Whereupon the court imposed a heavy
fine."
The lawyers laughed and watched for
the effect of this shot on the lonely cig
arette fiend.
The youth gradually recalled the
gaze which had been fixed on the far
distance, and, turning with an inter
ested and almost eager expression to
the wag, inquired with a drawl:
"Did the Judge make any rulings as
to blowing smoke in an ass's face?"
And during the lull the humorist had
time to think of an important engage
ment!

MR. BUMEISTER'S COURTSHIP.
At last Mr. Bumeister's patience was at
an end. The Widow Flaherty's geese had
again broken through the fence that sepa
rated the two yards and had partaken
of the cornmeal intended for his own
flock without leave or license.
"Ach, meln himmell" cried Mr. Bumei
ster from his front door step. "Dose

own threshold), "vill you keep dese gooses

The Widow Flaherty has a fine eye In
her head, and as she talked wrath died
from the looks of Mr. Bumeister. His
glance wandered down to the two Quar

to the rosy face of the widow, and with
incredible speed his steps followed the

on the fence between the premises.
"You vas a pooty smart vomans, eh?"
he said. "Yf>u ton't got no husban's?

IT GREW ON A TREE.
The little girl with a broad-brimmed
hat was a bright child. All the railway
passengers who happened to occupy seats
in her immediate vicinity were ready to
admit that. The lady with her wore gold
eyeglasses and was reading a paper-
Dovel as attentively as her youthful com
panion's flow of conversation would
permit.
"Was you ever in a railway accident,
auntie?" the child queried.
"No, dear."
"Would you like to be?"
"Certainly not."
"I know a man who was in a railway
accident."
"Do you?"
"Yes. I asked him if it hurt him much.
He said he just laughed when it was all
over."
"It couldn't have been a very serious
accident," said the lady with gold eye
glasses as she laid her book down and
gave a sigh of resignation.
"Yes, it was. It was quite a large ac
cident, and his car was in the very worst
of it."
"He was fortunate to escape without
injury."
"He didn't. He lost his limb in the ac
cident. It was all covered up in the
debris. And he had to come away with
out it."
"What did you say he lost?" was the
Inquiry in a tone of slight severity.
"His limb."
"My dear, I am going to tell you some
thing which I desire you to bear in mind
In the future. There was a time when
people who were very punctilious regard
ed it as desirable to say 'limb' when they
meant 'leg.' But now sensible persons
who mean 'leg' use that word. Don't say
'limb' unless that is what you mean. Re
member that a limb is something that
frows on a tree. Do you think you will
c able hereafter to make that distinc
tion?"
"Yes'm. I asked the gentleman th.it
was In the accident why he didn't k^
back afterward and try to find hisâ his
limb"â
"Caroline! I thought I told you a limb
was something that grew on a tree."
"Yes'm. But, auntie, this gentleman's
leg was a wooden one."

further interruption.â Washington Star.
PUZZLES IN PRONUNCIATION.
School children are so observant. Es
pecially of their teachers, and more es
pecially when they are just starting out
in school.
A little Cleveland girl of six summers
came home the other day with her mind
filled with that new wonder, the school-
room.
"How do you like your teacher?" her
mamma asked.
"She's a very nice teacher, said the
little one; "only it's such a pity sne
doesn't speak so many of her words right.
I shouldn't think they'd let her teach till
she learned to say them so people comd
understand."
"Why, what does she say that s wrong?
"Well, yesterday she was going to say
'Pass from the room quietly,' and what do
you think she did say? She said, 'Pawss,'
just like that. 'Pawss from* the room
auietly ' I guess nobody didn't understand
her at #rst. And then, this morning we
were talking about trees, and she said

a nice teacher, but you rot to get used to
her before you can understand her lan
guage."
WHAT THE BEAR DID.
A few old sportsmen were relating their
experiences to each other when ;in inter
loper drew up and interrupted them with
a few stories of his hair-breadth escapes,
much to their disgust. Finally one
chipped in and quietly told the following
story: _ ...
"Three or four years ago I was hunting
in the Rocky Mountains and happened to
be on the top of a high precipice, and for
the purpose of getting a better view of
the valley, some 500 or 600 feet below, laid
down my gun and crawled out upon a
small rock overlooking the chasm, and
strangely fell asleep.
"Presently I wft awakened by a noise
on the bank, and saw a large bear within
a few feet of me. Of course I was power
less, as I could hardly move without fall
ing from the rock, and I could not escape
to the bank nor reach my gun, which was
beyond the bear.
"Presently the bear crawled down slow
ly until he stood squarely over me on the
rock."
After a short pause the Interloper
asked: "What did tne bear do?"
"Ate me up."â Forest and Stream.

Burglar's Visit.
STOLE ONLY GAS BURNERS
THOMAS SHIELDS AND HIS FAM
ILY NEARLY SMOTHEREjJ.
The Thief Neglected to Turn Off the
Deadly Fluid and the House
Became Uninhabit
able.
In his anxiety to possess himself of two
gasburners an unknown thief yesterday
morning nearly caused the death of
Thomas Shields and his family.
The Shields live at 5448 Howard street.
Some time after 4 o'clock yeterday morn
ing a thief visited the premises and
wrenched off the gasburners. In his haste
to get away, presumably, he neglected to
turn off the gas.
Sometime afterward Shields was
aroused by the smell of gas. Jumping out
of bed he proceeded to make an investi
gation. After considerable trouble he
discovered that the gasburncrs in the
hallway had been removed. Arousing his
wife and children he told them of what
had happened and ordered them to open
the windows while he continued his inves
tigation. Failing to find the thief he went
in search of the police officer on the beat
to whom ho told the story of the theft
of the gasburners.
Last night Shields visited police head
quarters and made a report of the oc
currence to Chief Lees. He does not be
lieve that the thief intended to cause the
death of himself and family.
"He was probably in a hurry." Shields
remarked, "and neglected to turn off the
gas. Had I not detected the smell of the
escaping fluid it is more than probable
that at least one of the family would now
be in the Morsrue."
The police are inclined to believe that
the crime was committed by some opium
fiend, who, in order to satisfy his craving
for the drug, determined to steal the
burners and then sell them for a mere pit
tance. With the money he received for
them, they argue, he would buy enough
opium to satisfy his appetite for the
drug.
LIGHT ON THE MEN WHO CONVICT
ED DREYFUS.
France has had a little Parliamentary
scandal, which throws light on the meth
ods of the men concerned in suppressing
the truth in the Dreyfus matter. M. Tur
rel, who was Minister of Public Works in
the Meline Ministry, had for his opponent
in the late elections a retired army offi
cer, whose complete military record, sup
posed to be kept in the secret archives
of the War Office, was published in a
Government newspapeV in the expecta
tiionÂ»that it would hurt his chances. M.
Turrel, before the Committee on Elec
tions of the new House, solemnly de
clared "on the memorj- of his mother
and on his honor" that he had no part
in the publication of his opponent's rec
ord, whereupon a Deputy produced the
manuscript of the article in Turrel's own
handwriting. He was unseated. The con
duct of General Billot, the Meline Minis
ter of War, who is responsible for Tur
rel's obtaining possession of the record,
is severely criticized. General Billot it
was who dragged the question of the
"honor of the army" into the "Dreyfus
investigation.â New York Sun.

Doomed.
Flames Also Spreading to th>e Residence Section
of the City, and the Loss Will Be
Very Heavy.
BpÂ«clal Dispatch to TbÂ« CÂ«H.
SACRAMENTO. Nov. 7.â Shortly af
ter 1 o'clock this morning the car and
machine shops of the Southern Pacific
Hailroad Company here caught flre,
and are now almost a total wreck.
What the cause is or where the fire
started is unknown, but it is presumed
that it had its origin in the engine
room of the machine-shop.
Prom last reports sparks from the
doomed buildings were carried for a dis
tance of six or seven blocks and were
threatening tne residence section of the
city.
The regular fire department was
called out t<> aÃstet the regular force
employed by the railroad company to

A TRIBUTE TO ANDRE.
Roses were laid on the tomb of Major
Andre, in Westminster Abbey, with . a
card, on which was Inscribed: "From Mrs.
Curran, formerly Beatrice Benedict Ar
nold of Chicago; a descendant of General
Benedict Arnold, who detests the memory
of her ancestor but reveres that of me
man whose death he encompassed, Major
Andre. This is a token of her loving re
6pect." Arnold, it will be remembered,
had turned traitor to Washington, and
was trying to secure West <<*tat for. the
British, and In a culpably careless fashion
had sent Major Andre on a secret expedi
tion. The major, in civilian dress, was re
turning, when he was seized by me
Americans and hanged as a spy, In Oc
tober, 1780: His remains were exhumed
and brought to Westminster Abbey in lE2O.
Mrs. Curran's dislike for her ancestor is
certainly not shared by her family, for
bo recently as IbSO Isaac N, Arnold pub
lished a nook with the object of extenuat
ing the treason of General Arnold, and at
tributed his tralterous conduct In going
over to the British to a in of temper, in
duced by Washington putting tive subor
dinate officers over his head; Arnold who
joined King George's service, died In l^n
ton in ISOI. He has his apologists outside
his own family, who declare that but for
the nigh character of Major Andre, whose
cad fate was the result of miscalculation
Arnold's treason would have been treated
very lightly by the historian.-London

Much interest has been aroused In a
chalice exhibited in the window of Keith
& Co., at Soho. It' will be transferred
next week to the Ait Exhibition attached
to the Church Congress at Bradford. The
chalice Is described as "undoubtedly one
of the finest specimens of modern ecclesi

has en," and will vie with any product
of the old masters. It stands close on a
foot high, weighs fifty ounces, and has
taken four years to complete. It was de
signed by Mr. Keith for use at New York
after the congress. The design is of the
choicest fourteenth century workâhex
agonal plinthâ the center panel shows the
Crucifixion, and other panels the chief
events In the life of Christ. On the upper
portion appear figures of the apostles,
and there are otiter details of exquisite

of the locomotive and took the straight,
level track right ahead of the train. In
another instant a great blaek-and-tan

his long, lank body stretched out at full

hind the fox. More steam was turned on.

The machinery of the shops, itself, is
considered to be worth a fortune alone,

was being done in the building before

The effect vt the fire is inestimable

an abatement of the fury of the ilames.

FERGUSON WAS HIS GUEST.
"A Worcester man," says the Wor

trips to Europe, fell in with a fas
cinating stranger the last time he
was across. The stranger, who may
be designated as Ferguson, because
that doesn't sound at all like his real
name, was an American, his manners
were those of a gentleman and he
seempd to be well supplied with money
and to know a great many people
worth knowing. In conversation with
the Worcester man one day Ferguson
paid: "Worcester is a charming city
and I have some very dear friends
there. I presume you know Colonel K.
J. Russell? He is an old and highly
esteemed friend, to whom I am deeply
Indebted for many favors.' When tho
Worcester man returned home he met
Colonel Russell one day, and in course
of conversation remarked that he had
met a man in Europe who said that he
was an old friend. Colonel Russell
thought for a moment and then he re
plied: 'Oh, yes; I remember Ferguson
very well. I ought to, for he lived with
me for seven years once. It was when
I was warden of the State prison at
Charlestown, and I will say that Fer
guson was one of the quietest and beat
behaved prisoners that I ever had."

WADE WILL HAVE
COMMAND IN CUBA
A New Military Depart
ment to Be Formed.
CHOICE OF THE PRESIDENT
LEE TO COMMAND THE DISTRICT
OF HAVANA.
General Gomez Does Not Apprehend
That the Islana Will Be An
nexed to the United
States.
Special Dispatch to Tho CalL
WASHINGTON, Nov. The Gov
ernment of Cuba has given the admin
istration much concern and its form is
not yet definitely determined upon.
Since issuing the order designating the
troops to go to Cuba there has been
considerable talk at the War Depart
ment about the probable commander
of troops in Cuba and the organization
of a government, civil and military.
The probabilities now are that Cuba
will be designated as one department
and placed under the command of one
officer. The general impression seems
to be that the officer will be Major Gen
eral Wade, now chairman of the Cuban
Military Commission, whose duties as
a member of this commission has fitted
him for the office. \
The President and Secretary Alger
have great confidence in General Wade
j and believe he combines the military
and civil qualities necessary for the
! supreme command of Cuba when our
occupation is complete.
There has been an intimation that
: General Brooke, who has been in com
' mand in Forto Rico, might be selected
Co* command in Cuba, but such is not
the present intention. General Brooke,
who ranks all the major generals in the
volunteer service, commands only
i about 6000 troops in Porto Rico, less
! than some brigadier generals who are
in command of divisions, and much less
'. than several generals in command of
corps. It is generally understood that
General Brooke does not care to remain
i any longer in Porto Rico than the de
' partment actually thinks his services
are required. There has been some sug
gestion that General Merritt might re-
I turn and take command in Cuba, but
the administration thinks the selection
of General Wade would be better.
General Wade ranks all the volunteer ,
major generals now in service, except j
Brooke and would rank General Lee in
'â  command of the Seventh Corps, al
â¢ though the latter would be in actual
command of the district of Havana. ,
It is possible that the department of :
Cuba will be divided into districts, some
of greater and some of less importance,
'â  The districts would be Havana. Santi
' ago and Cienfuegos. It is possible that ;
each province will be designated as a
district. The command of the Second
Corps is still unsettled. General Law
ton was at one time selected for the
place but it was found that two offi
cers at least ranked him, and this prov
â  ed rather unsatisfactory.
Following is an extract from a letter
j received by Senor Quesada from Gen
' eral Gomez, written October 20:
Â»Thava full confidence in the solemn
promises' made by the Congress of
: Washington, and for that reason I do
i not have any fear as to the independ
ence of Cuba. Some time must elapse
1 before our ideal will be realized, but
! after so many struggles and privations
we can wait a little longer.
"The military occupation by the ,
United States is to a certain extent \
! necessary to prepare and hurry the j
! evacuation of the Spanish and to bring ;
! about harmony among the different lac- j
tions in Cuban politics. During this
military occupation the republican
government will be organized. Its de
cisions will be finally accepted by all;
order will reign everywhere.
"Those who speak of annexation try
to satisfy, above all, their spite propa
gating unfounded fears as to personal
i security and private property.
"The final success of our struggle has
' required necessary destruction of prop
i erty which the enemy Used to its ad
; vantage, but we have never attacked
! individuals. The struggle against Spain
is now ended; we commence now a
more delicate and difficult taskâname
ly, to make our republican political
system triumph and to reconstruct the
i country. It is not an easy labor, and
1 all men who love their "country should
; contribute to it. For that reason I
cannot retire now, notwithstanding my
61 years.
'â¢Most of the officers and soldiers went
; Into the field obeying my orders; I can
' not abandon them until their future is
assured. They have lost everything
they had, they have a right to some
i nsation, and, above all, to their
! salaries; the new government must se-
I cure them. Their abandonment can
i not occur until the Spaniards have
evacuated; my men cannot be aban- ;
doned without bread or work to the
! mercy of their enemies. A solution
| could be found, perhaps, in the plan
j which the American Government is
: said to have of creating a native civil
guard formed In the majority of Cv
i ban soldiers. This organization would
' offer the advantage of not exposing the
! American troops to the deadly climate
! of the island and at the same time the
' United States would have people \> ho
knew the country thoroughly. In the
meanwhile and until the evacuation oc
: dura food must be provided for my sol
! diers. . - .
"The evacuation should be as rapid
I as possible, and afterward everything
! will be arranged, for the American Gov
| ernment will fulfill its moral pledges
to us. Some people have tried to make
us suspicious, :so as to bring about
trouble, but before doubting the good
faith of the American people .we must
j wait for acts which phall give the lie
I to their solemn pledges."
"CARPET-BAGGERS" BEGIN
TO ADVANCE UPON CUBA
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Nov. 6â An
Insurgent captain and lieutenant have
been arrested at Guantanamo for hold,
ing up a man on the street and taking
away his machete, which they after
ward sold for $2 50. They denied that
they were under any obligation to- pay
for it and claimed exemption from trial i
nnd imprisonment on the ground of
their rank In the Cuban army.
Mr. Kemoner has been promoted to
be postal agent of the military depart
ment of Santiago. John Gcrrst has been j
appointed postmaster of Santiago City
and Hugo Heyderman financial clerk.
There ate now eight postofflces in the
departmentâ Santiago, Daiquiri. Guan
tanamo, Baracoa, San Luis, Manzanilln,
I Gibara and Holguin. Many people are
arriving here with letters from Sena
tors. One man Is virtually appointed
by Secretary Alger as collector of cus
toms at Manzanillo. He expects about
three times the salary of the Cuban
i row holding the position. Owing to
pressure of public business General
Leonard Wood, governor of the depart
< ment, has postponed his trip to Guan
[ tanamo for a day or two. but he will
probably leave before the middle of
the week.
PONCE, Nov. 6.â A large and repre
sentative body of Porto Rlcans have
drawn up a petition addressed to Presi
dent McKJnley asking the Government
to retain in Porto Rico Colonel John B.
Castleman and the First Kentucky Vol
unteers. General Henry has cabled to
Washington that the compliment is
thoroughly deserved, but that the regi
ment ought to po north. It Is under
stood that orders to move will be Is
sued aa soon as the Fifth United States
Cavalry arrives.
TIGERS DETERMINED
TO DEFEAT YALE
PRINCETON, N. J., Nov. Â«.â The disap
pointed but not discouraged Tigers will
begin hard work to-morrow with the de
termination to down Yale. The chief ob
stacle to overcome is the crippled condi
tion of the men. Wheeler is in Philadel
phia undergoing treatment for a lame
back. Kafer was carried off the field at
West Point unconscious, and will not be
able to do duty to-morrow. Beardsley
has not recovered from the Injury to his
knee and is practically out of the game.
The condition of Wheeler is more serious
than that of any of the others, and the
chances are decidedly against his playing
on Saturday.
From the way things look now, Hutch
lnson and Myers will probably play at
quarter and full back respectively. Black
will play one halfback und Beardsley the
other if he recovers from his injuries in
time.
To-morrow the team will be put on long
practice, the halves being extended to
the limit.

man J. Miller it Is probable that where
many handsome residences now ornament
the eastern part 01' this city would stand
a mass of blackened, smoldering ruins.
Shortly after midnight an Incendiary set
fire to the grand stand of the baseball

Fire Department ample time to subdue
the flames before the danger point was

A Simons breeze was blowing from the

F,r;mu stand are situated many cottages.
It the fire had reached them it Is proba

111% IS A COMMON SCOLD.
The unusual spectacle of a man ar

Magistrate O'Brion occupied the judicial
bench aod the prisoner before him was
J Â»hn Ilcrtmann of 937 Marshall street.
The audience Was principally composed of
Hartmahn's rteiehbors and the principal
witness against him was Charles Plckett,
who ri sldaa next door to him. Pickett
testified that Hartmann has been nagging
at the people of the neighborhood for
some time. Hartmann objected to his
neighbors sitting upon their door steps at
flight, and insisted that they should stay
inside and go to bed early. On one occa
sion he deliberately turned the hose upon
Pickett and hi* wife because they refused
"to u>> in the house by 10 o'clock." Sev
ern! women In the courtroom chimed In
with a concert of ahecdotes, but were sup
pressed by the Judge.
Hartmrinn, who has a pronounced Ho
henzollero accent to match his alleged
Kaiser WilhPlm proclivities for managing
other people's affairs, shouted: "Vy don'd
dey mofe cleir houses Und go? I am a
nuisance not." When the magistrate held
Hartir.ann on the- charge of being a com
mon scold and demanded ba.il, the de
fendant's lawyer cried: "You cannot hold
toy client on that charge. Who ever
heard of a man being a common scold?"
"I did, just now, alia unless your Client

NEW YORK, Nov. 6.â State Superin

IS THERE AN IDEAL, IN FRANCE?
Is there an ideal in France? One might
be disposed to question this. The French
character which prides itself bo much On
its lucidity and logic, is essentially realis
tic. It has its moments of Tartarinesque
exuberance, but then Tartarin was one of
the most practical of men. An inquisitive
writer in Figaro has recently addressed
a questionnaire or circular demand to
many of the most eminent and Some of
the most strikingly mediocre personages \
in this country, requesting them to state
what was their ideal at the age of twen
ty. Most of the answers are curious; all
are-* interesting. Some arc hypercritical,
others bombastic, and those which seem
to bear the Impress of genuine confession
are a little pessimistic. Theophile Gau
tier has already said that '"in order to for
get the brutalities and bitternesses of the
present time, one must look back to the
past and console one's self by thinking of
the ideal one had at twenty years of age."
Barbey d'Aurevilly exclaimed: "'The
ideal at twenty years of age!' The star
which always shines over our head, in
spite of the mists of senility."
Thanks, then, to the Figaro, we know
now what was the ideal at twenty years
of age of those remarkable personages,
MM. Aurelien Scholl, Hyaclnthe Loyson,
Oarolus Duran, Victorien Sardou, Henri
Becque, Rodin, Armand Sllvestre, Charles
Lt-cocq, Francisque Sarcey, and Mme.
Judic. Sardou, that great upholsterer of
modern melodrama, who would have
turned Moliere into a limited liability
company, with branches in all. parts of
the globe, wandered, at the age of 20,
among the old trees of the Luxembourgâ
since replaced by younger ones, which are
not worthy of their predecessorsâ and his
ideal was success and celebrity, with Â£500
a year, a library of 1000 or 1200 books, and
a cottage in the country similar to the
guardian's lodge at the iron gate of the
Rue de Vaugirard, with its puddle of dirty
water In front, where the ducks splashed
about. In addition, of course, decorations
and the Academy, and honorific functions
and what not. All of which things M.
Victorien Sardou has most ideally
achieved, and ho is very happy. Not so
M. Henri Becque. who has never thought
much of M. Sardou.
Poor M. Becuue has always been a
grumbler, an incompris. His special de
testation is M. Claretle, manager of the
Comedle Prancalse, to whom he attributes
the small pecuniary . success he has
achieved with the public. No one denies,
of course, that M. I Becque is a great
dramatist. "At twenty years, at thirty
and even later. I . have had dreams, of
which not one has been realized"'â that
is all he condescends to say. It is very
sad. M. Franeesque Sarcey, another of
Becque's betes ndires, the typical bour
?eols dramatic critic, but a first-rate good
ellow, remembers that at twenty years
all he wanted to be was a university
professor, and that he became; and,
though he has drifted into journalism, a
professor he has always remained. He
quotes About as a similar instance. About
was born to be a novelist, but never un
derstood this; he always hankered after
a university career.
Armand Silvestre, the modern Rabelais,
the last (let us really hope the last) de
pository of the vieil esprit gaulois. had
but one ambition at the age of twenty,
which was to love. How. touching! And
since then he has gone on loving,, "even
though he may hope no more." : â 
Carolus Duran wanted to have a grand
talent, to be really somebody, righteous
in character, and worthy of inspiring the
same love which he was capable of feel
ing himself. He is now old, but he feels
with Musset that "rien nest bon que
d'almer." Added to Which he is the fash
ionable portrait painter of American heir
esses, the father of a charming family,
and a command"" of the Legion of Honor.
Rodin,. the great sculptor of Balzac, de
serves to be contrasted with him. At the
age of 20 he was seeking, without
success, a master to his taste, and sent to
the Salon the famous bust "The Man
With the Broken Nose," which was re
fused. "When I was young "he writes,
"I always walked about with the first
â¢Meditations' of I.aniartine in my pock
et ' They Were tender and religious in the
face of nature. My sculpture resembles
them. I have introduced something of
the 'Meditations' into many of my works.
So I have realized my ideal a little."
. Aurelien Scholl wanted to be a great
man of letter?; he .has been simply a pop
ular journalist, an arbitrator of duels,
and a" fashionable. wit. He used to dream
of the Academy; now he dreams only of
the Nirvana and of bringing out a vol- j
ume of reminiscences. _ w .
And Hyacinthe Loyson (Pere Hya
cinthe)? Ah, his was a gradiose^ ideal.
"At twenty . years â  I dreamed 'of ? men
growing great in knowledge and mor
ality, Reeking their happiness in aiding
and loving one another." . But among the
deceptions and bitternesses of the pres
ent hour M. Loyson reflects that. he has
not sold his conscience, that ho:go*ld
could purchase it and that God is above
all the God of Reason, the God of Des
cartes, whom he has never ceased to low
and worship. "So that, after all, life ,la
good.'and death also.'. 1 :.
And at twenty years of age Mme. Ju
die's Ideal was to play, drama and to re
main thin. Life has not realized either
of these. dreams, but though she has re
nounced all, hope of i becoming. thin, â > she
does not yet despair, of one day playing

PANBESA'S LETTER.
Probably the oldest letter In the
world is the letter of Panbesa, written
fifteen centuries before Christ, to his
friend Amenemapt, a scribe.
The manuscript is of perishable
papyrus, and it is amazing that it
should have survived for more than
thirty centuries and still be legible.
It is preserved in the collection of the
British Museum. It has been several
times translated during the present
century. It presents an interesting
picture of life in Egypt in the time of
Rameses 11. It is more in the nature
of a literary production, a poem com
posed in celebration of the visit of
Pharoah to the city of Pa-Rameses,
than an ordinary letter of to-day.
Panbesa "greets his lord, the scribe
Amenemapt, to whom be life, health
and strength," and then goes on to de
scribe the verdant fields, the thrashing
floors, the vineyards, the groves of
olives, the orchards of flgs, the great
daily markets, with their fish and
waterfowl and swarms of purchasers.
The citizens had their "sweet wine of
Khemi, pomegranate wine and wine
from the vineyards," and to these they
added "beer of Kati."
There was music in plenty furnished
by the singers of the school of
Memphis.
On the whole Pa-Rameses seems to
have been a pleasant place to live in.
â¢'The lesser folk are there equal with
the great folk," and Panbesa writes
that its maidens were "in holiday attire
every day" with locks "redolent of
perfumed oil."â Washington Star.

Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Qor
don Bennett.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Nov. 6.â
Naval officers told me the Maria Teresa
was in condition to stand gales safely,
and that, towed by the Merritt and
Vulcan and convoyed by the Leonidas,
there was every reason for her safe ar
rival at Norfolk If properly sailed.
Carelessness, not weather, was the j
cause of the Teresa's loss, in the opin
ion of officers here.
When work on the Maria Teresa was
begun under Captain Sharp of ihe
wrecking company Commodore Watson
found that the large amount of the
agreed per diem, $800, tempted Captain
Sharp to "dilly dally" over the work.
He therefore dismissed Captain Sharp
and appointed Captain Chittenden to
take charge of the work of raising the
cruiser.
Under the contract the Government
was to render all assistance possible, j
The repair ship Vulcan, commanded by
Lieutenant Commander Ira Harris, was j
detailed from work on the ships in i
Guantanamo Bay. While the time of j
the ships crew was devoted to work j
on the Teresa Lieutenant Commander
Harris directed the work of the wreck-
Ing party, doing nothing on any of the
Government vessels.
Lieutenant Commander Harris, fired
with ambition to be in charge of the
splendid prize when she was delivered
to the United States, it is alleged, put
political machinery in motion in order
to obtain a sentimental record con
nected with the Spanish ship. He had
In view, it is asserted, his own restora
tion to service, as he was only serving
as a volunteer officer.
Captain Chester of the Cincinnati,
senior officer on the Cuban station, en
couraged him. The wrecking company,
desiring to deliver the Teresa at Guan
tanamo, thus avoiding the responsibil
ity of the passage, put no obstacles in
his path, and Mr. Harris's plans were
successful.
He was detached from command of
the Vulcan and transferred to the
Teresa In just what special capacity is
not known here. If, however, he was
In command as the representative of
the United States he was virtually re
ceiving officer, thereby relieving the
wrecking company of that part of the
contract requiring delivery at Norfolk.
MAMA TERESA MAY
YET BE AFLOAT
NORFOLK, Va., Nov. 6. â No one saw
the Maria Teresa sink, and it is now
feared she may be afloat, a dangerous
derelict and menace to commerce. The
repair-ship Vulcan, which parted com
pany with the wrecking tug Merritt eff
the- Bahama Islands in last Tuesday's
Etoim, during which the joint convoy,
the cruiser Infanta Maria Teresa, was
lost, arrived at Hampton Roads .to
day, bringing additional news of the
catastrophe.
f'hief Engineer Sims of the Vulcan
said that after the crew of 108 men
aboard the Teresa was taken off by
the Merritt the Vulcan, which was tow-
Ing the disabled cruiser by a fifteen-
Inch hawser, proceeded for four hours
longer to tow her toward Norfolk. The
hawser from the Vulcan was secured
by a chain bridle around her after uite.
The great fear of the Vulcan's officers
was that she might not be able to get
rid of the dangerous tow without foul-
Ing: her own propeller with the heavy
tackle. The chief engineer said, d<
epite the possibility of the Teresa sink-
Ing at any minute and pulling her con
sort down after her, the Vulcan held
on manfully to the former Spaniard un
til it was believed that to tow her
longer was to sink with her.
It was then that Lieutenant Gilmer
ordered the men to cut with axes the
great hawser and throw off the chain
bridle. The Vulcan's engine stopped
meanwhile.
By this time the Teresa was pitch-
Ing and rolling as though she was to
go down very soon. She, however, held
her course astern of the Vulcan for
some time. Tremendous seas were
sweeping over her. The last seen of her
by those aboard the Vulcan was the
American flag flying defiantly astern,
and the men cheered as they left the
ship to her fate. The Vulcan proceeded
northeast all night at two knots an
hour. At daybreak she turned back
and searched "all day, but saw nothing
of the Teresa, Merritt, or the collier
Leonidas. As night fell the gale in
creased, and it was determined to pro
ceed to Hampton Roads.
Sims said that at times it was im
possible for men to work aboard the
Teresa. The air was very foul, and the
discovery of the skeletons of Spaniards
in the hold was almost a daily occur
rence. Sims says no one saw the Ter
esa sink. It was stated that before be
ing abandoned her after water-tight
compartments were closed. She may be
ev<*n now a dangerous derelict afloat at
eea. Search will be made for her until
at least floating wreckage is found
which makes it reasonably certain that
she y>zs crone to the bottom. Nothing
nas been heard of the Leonidas.
THE VULCAN LOST
SIGHT OF THE TERESA
NEWPORT NEWS, Va., Nov. 6.â The
repair ship Vulcan arrived in Hampton
Roads late last night. She started
from Santiago vi'h the Maria Teresa,
together with the tugs Merrltt and
Leonidas. Th<; night the Teresa went
flown she lost track of the two tugs and
after a fruitless search for them started
for Hampton Roads. The men on the
Vuican were grraitfled to learn that the
Merritt had arrived at Charleston, as
they feared that she had been lost.

TOMBSTONE, Nov. 6.â Last night Joe

rerrill fired, killing Marquarl Instantly.
Both men were old residents of Cochls

DETROIT, Mich., Nov. 6.â Three more
victims were to-day dug from the ruins
of the New Wonderland building, which
'collapsed yesterday afternoon. This
makes the death list so far eleven. The
bodies recovered to-day were identified as
those of Peter Pfeifle, carpenter; Frank
Wolf, tinner, and Max Pett, who was
Wolfs helper.
All the Injured at the hospitals were to
day reported improving, except Edward
Fischer, who is expected to die.
A mass-meeting of representative citi
zens was held at noon in the Mayor s
office, and over $1000 was subscribed for
the relief of the families of those who
were killed. The loss on the property was
estimated to-day for the first time. It
is believed that $102,000 will cover it.
What caused the catastrophe Is still un
known and probably will be until the
Coroner's inquest next week. A promin
ent local architect In an Interview to-day
stated that he did not believe in the the
ory that the steel work was faulty, but
saJd he did believe that it was not heavy
enough.
All three bodies discovered to-day were
in the center of the building, buried un
der tons of debris. Frank Wolf was found
strangled to death by a heavy steel girder
which lay across his throat. Both the
o her bodies were frightfully mangled. In
addition to those known to be dead there
are still missing Fred Miller, Charles
Mielke and O. Mullln.

tion returns from the dome of its

RAVAGES OF SMALLPOX
IN HOLGUIN DISTRICT
NEW YORK, Nov. 6.â General Wood,
commanding at Santiago de Cuba, has
sent a cable dispatch to the Central
Cuban Relief Association which reads:
"I find in Holguin district, just evacu
ated by the Spaniards, long standing
smallpox scattered throughout the dis
trict and am making every effort to
stamp it out. Dr. Woodson of the army
is in charge of the work. Please send
him to Gibara by first Government
transport 1000 cots and 200 half-ounce
bottles of vaccine lymph."
Agent Warner of the Red Cross, who
reached Gibara in the latter part of
September on the schooner Mary E.
Morse, reported on his arrival the ter
rible spread of smallpox, which had
been raging unchecked for a long time,
and called for vaccine virus. Enough
for 1000 vaccinations was at once sent,
as well as a quantity of quinine. The
facts were telegraphed to General
Wood in reply to his message and he
was told that the supplies asked for
would be sent to the Red Cross agent at
Gibara for Dr. Woodson's use.

Drafts.
CHICAGO. Nov. 6.â William Lodtman,
once a wealthy lumber dealer of Bohemia
and later a lieutenant in the German
army, is under arrest in this city charged
with swindling. Lodtman admits having
passed worthless checks and drafts in va
rious parts of the country during the last
few years, but claims that the whole
amounted to only $1000, most of which
he paid back. The police assert, however,
that Lodtman has secured several thou
sand dollars and was about to pass a
worthless drafts for a large sum at Port
Huron when captured. Lodtman is well
known in America and Europe as a news
paper writer on scientific subjects. Busi
ness adversity, he says, compelled him
to obtain money through swindling.

BONNET'S CHANCES
BEST FOR SHERIFF
A careful canvass of the city shows that T. F. Bonnet, the popular candi
date for Sheriff, has established himself in the minds and hearts of the
people by reason of his magnificent record as License Collector. The political
don't want Bonnet because they cannot use him. He will not permit
them to pollute the very fountain of justice, the jury-box, which passes
throueh his office before it finds a resting place in the courts. He will not
tolerate the appointment by them of a gang of political loafers whom the
bosses must reward for dirty work. They want a Sheriff who will be po
litically deaf dumb and blind; a man who will be a mere figurehead, and
allow them to name the deputies, pack juries and run things to suit - them
selves. And for all of these reasons the people desirous of good government
will elect Mr. Bonnet, *

Sum to Be Paid the Madrid Goovern

â Jteolal Dispatch to ThÂ» Can.
NEW YORK, Nov. 6.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent says:
Spain's exhaustive argument against
the cession of the Philippines to the
United States has had the result of
making the officials all the more de
termined to take the islands. The in
structions sent to Mr. Day. chairman
of the American Commissioners, will
require him and his colleagues to re
new on Tuesday their demands for the
cession of the group to the United
States, and they will make In their
communication the first otter in money
in payment for the islands.
It Is understood that the President
will consult to-morrow with some of
his advisers concerning the amount to
be named in the American communica
tion, but I was told again to-night that
the sum to be paid will not under any
consideration exceed the aggregate of
debts contracted by the Spanish Gov
ernment for improvements in the Phil
ippines. All military debts and debts
contracted in the name of other islands,
such as Cuba, will be barred, and the
Spanish Commissioners will be In
formed that they must recognize this
fact as promptly as possible.
Secretary Hay has received* a full
statement of the contents of the Span
ish note. Its character was just what
the officials expectedâ without any new
arguments of importance, I under
stand that Senor Rios and his col
leagues call attention to the action of
their Government in delivering the
note through M. Cambon, French Em
bassador, to President McKinley,
which set forth the understanding of
the Spanish Government that in agree
ing to the protocol its sovereignty over
the Philippines would not be affected.
It is also claimed by the Spanish
Commissioners that this declara
tion was assented to by President
McKinley. As a matter of fact, I was
told this afternoon the note had been
delivered, but the President had de
clined to answer it, either in writing or
verbally to M. Cambon.
The Spanish Commissioners have de
clared, it is said, that instead of the
United States acquiring the Philip
pines, this Government should pay
their Government indemnity for the
attack on Manila after the peace proto
col had been signed and for the dam
age consequently done.
I understand that after the Philip
pine question has been disposed of the
Commissioners will consider the de
termination of claims which have been
filed by Americans against Spain and
by Spaniards against the United State's.
It was thought that this Government
would bind itself to satisfy all Amer
ican claims in consideration of territory
ceded to the United States, but I under
stand this is incorrect. The Spanish
Commissioners have a heavy claim for
filibustering against the United States
to offset the claims filed by Americans
for personal and property injuries, and
the question of their disposition will
have to be decided.
Remind your neighbors of the
importance of the issues at
stake, and sec that all off them
make up their minds to vote to
morrow.
SPAIN WILL SIGN PEACE
TREATY UNDER PROTEST
LONDON, Nov. 7.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Daily Mail says:
Spain will sign the peace treaty under
protest.
The Vienna correspondent of the
Times, commenting upon the irritation
of the German press over the attitude
of the United States toward the Phil
ippine question, says: "It has but lit
tle importance and is only likely to ex
cite the scorn and defiance of the
Americans and tend to confirm them
in their determination to keep the Phil
ippines." The Framdenblatt, in a
temperate article that gives the Ger
man papers an example of impartial
ity, recognizes that it is purely a ques
tion for the Americans to decide for
themselves.
The Berlin correspondent of the
Times, after giving extracts from an
other longer and violent article in the
Kolnische Zeitung. declares that the
fate of the Philippines cannot be a
matter of indifference to Germany, and
expresses the opinion that such utter
ances will only stiffen the attitude of
the United States.
The Berlin correspondent of the
Standard says: The semi-official pa
pers have received a hint to stop their
attacks upon America. I have good
reason to believe, however, that Ger
many will doff her reserve so soon as
other powers seek a share in the spoils
of the Philippines.

Her.
KANSAS CITY, Nov. 5.â "1 am trying
to live a Christian life. I'm hom.rriick to
see Jesus. I am ready to go to-day, this
hour, this minute, if necessary. Praise
the Lord."
Scarcely had these words left the lips
of Mrs. Jennie Walker, at a religious
meeting at the Goodway Mission to-day,
when she fell back Into her seat dead.
The hall was crowded with worshipers.
After a short service people in the con
gregation arose one by one and began to

to testify. In one breath she said she
was ready to go â her next breath was her
last. The woman had died of heart dis

RIDDLED WITH BULLETS.
Negro Murderer Killed and Two
Others Likely to Meet His
Fate.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Nov. 6.â Arthur
Williams, a ne~ro under arrest for the
murder of Miss Elina Ogden, confessed
last night, implicating two ouier negroes,
Buck James and Monroe Leggitt. Near
midnight the Constable and his guards
were overpowered by a mob and Williams
was riddled with bullets and a fire built
upon his body. James and Leggritt will
likely go the way of WilHams to-night.
Do not confuse William L. Fitz

City and County Attorney, with
E. L. Fitzgerald, the Democratic

Oakland, whose crooked record
has been exposed. William L.

deserves the support of all par
ties.
Nebraska Vs. Kansas.
LAWREN^'K, K;ins., Nov. 6.â Three

the State Universities of Kansas and
Nebraska. The Nebraskans were vic

of the first half the score was 6 to 0 in
the visitors' favor. The Nebraskans won

of Miss Eversleigh's death.
Both young men are under parole ar

TRADE FPIR AND FEATURELESS.
*"T~"HE condition of trade throughout the country
at large remains about the same as previously
* reportedâ quiet, and characterized by conserva
tism and a disinclination to overbuy or speculate on
the future. The elections have had less effect than an
ticipated, though they have exerted more or less in
fluence. The bank clearings last week were 20 per
cent heavier than for the same week in 1897, and the
failures were 183, against 223. While these figures
show a better condition of business than at this time
last year, there is no line exhibiting any especial ac
tivity, and most of them are reported quiet.
There is no lack of funds in any quarter, however.
The annual report of the Treasury Department to the
Secretary shows that the net ordinary revenues of the
Government during the past fiscal year were $405.
321,000, an increase of $57,597,000 over the preceding
year, while the expenditures were $443,368,000, an in
crease of $77,594,000. The war with Spain added
greatly to the expenditures, but in spite of this the
assets of the country were only about $55,000,000 less
on June 30 than on the corresponding date in 1897.
It will be remembered that Congress voted $50,000,000
for war expenses, so the deficiency is easily accounted
for. The statement adds that the tenders of gold to
the department by banks and individuals in exchange
for paper were more than it could accept.
The same plethora of gold has characterized na
tional trade for over a year. Business may be quiet,
but it certainly is not for the want of gold coin. The
country has more of it than it knows what to do with,
and, as previously mentioned, the banks have been
glad to lcSan it to Europe. The cause of the com
parative quietness seems due to overproduction in a
number oi staples, notably wool and cotton, and to
a slackening in the foreign demand for wheat, owing
to the more pacific political situation in the Far
East. The distributive trade of the country seems to
be jogging along about as usual, and, in fact, is re
ported even better than it has been in the South and
West, owing to more favorable weather and the lift
ing of different quarantines. Wool is showing more
activity, as holders, having discovered that they
have been deceived in regard to the extent of the
supply, have begun to sell at concessions, and the
woolen manufacturers are looking forward to an in
creased trade in consequence, and at prices which will
admit of a small profit. The iron and steel trades re
port less business than for some weeks past, though
the mills are still well supplied with orders. While
grain has been duller, statistics show a fine foreign
export movement, which, however, has been offset by
increased receipts at Western points, so prices have
not been able to improve.
In Wall street bonds have been active, while stocks
have sold at concessions. The feeling on the street
is steady enough, as the railroad earnings continue to
make a good showing, and a number of large indus
trial concerns have recently declared their usual
dividends. Still, trading has been dull as a rule.
On this coast conditions have not changed for
some time. In California the weather is now the
chief factor in the commercial situation. Rain is
needed, both on account of feed and farming opera
tions. While it is yet too early for any apprehension
regarding the coming season, it cannot be denied that
a good soaking southeast storm would brighten
things wonderfully. Still, with the exception of dried
fruit and wool, the leading staples are moving off
well. The season in dried fruit has been a disappoint
ment all around. With short crops all over the
world nobody expected a stagnant market this fall,
but such has been the case, nobody knows why. The
grain market, albeit quiet, is on a plane of prices at
which the farmer can make money, and the minor
cereal^ such as barley and oats, have advanced ma
terially during the past week. Provisions still rule
dull. Hides are quiet, but the hop-growers are sell
ing their product at profitable quotations, and the
demand has lately been good. Cattle, sheep and
hogs are steady at satisfactory prices, and, except for
the scarcity of feed, no complaints are heard from the
stock men.
Country credits have kept up well in spite of the
dry year. Collections are no slower than usual, and
there is at present no visible disposition on the part
of the city houses to contract credits. The weekly
record of failures continues very favorable, there be
ing no serfotlS defaults in this direction. Money is
plentiful at the ordinary rates of interest, and the
agricultural parts of the Stats seem to be flourishing,
despite the recent dry season.
It is not easy to see why the American army should
p-y so much deference to the wishes of Blanco. The
soldiers ought to land in Cuba irrespective of his
wishes, and if he has not sense enough to get out of
the way the result would be chiefly distressing to him
self.
A girl who swore a man to prison now asserts that
her testimony was totally false. The mildest that
Justice can <*? is to permi'. he* to change places with
the man.
PATTON AND HIS PLATFORM.
PATTON and his platform. That means for San
Francisco the right measures and the right
man a business administration on business
â  principles, carried out by business methods, straight,
i open, honest, economical, efficientâ useful to the com
i muni'ty, beneficial to all classes, for the good of every
j citizen.
Charles L. Patton is not an office-seeker in the or
dinary meaning of the phrase. He accepted a nomi
â¢ nation in response to the call of his party and of con
| servative taxpayers because he is a man of public
i spirit, of civic patriotism, ready to assume the burdens
of office when the way is clear for him to fulfill the
duties with honor to himself and with usefulness to
his fellow-citizens. He did not accept the nomination
blindly. He demanded a platform in accord with his
views of the needs of the municipality befort he would
consent to become a candidate.
He appears before the people pledged to nothing
j except the principles of his platform and fidelity to
j the responsibilities of office. He is bound to no man,
nor set of men, other than the great body of the
j people themselves. He did not obtain, he did not
| seek, the nomination by intrigue, by chicanery, by
j combinations with other office-seekers or by sub
i servience to bosses.
The record of his life attests the independence of
| his manhood and the sterling worth of his character.
: lie is one of those native sons of whom the State
has a right to be proud. His position in society, in
the legal profession and in all the circles of business
is high. He has the learning, the experience and the
energy required to master the complex duties of the
Mayoralty, and he will perform them with the integ
rity that deserves success and the ability that com
mands it.
Mayor Patton will not confuse the affairs of the
city by making mistakes of law. He will not entail
losses upon the public treasury by hefting money
which the law requires him to count. He will not
use the patronage of the office to promote his ambi
tion for re-election or for the United States Senator
ship. He will not be a dealer in jobs for the benefit
of a gang of hungry spoilsmen.
The candidacy of Mr. Patton affords the citizens
of San Francisco an opportunity to accomplish a true
reform in municipal administration. Not the reform
of mouthing hypocrites, but a genuine business re
form. He is the candidate of more than the Repub
lican party. He stands for taxpayers, for property
owners, for workingmen â for all whose interests arc
identical with the interests of the community.
Work for him to-day. Vote for him to-morrow.
Let us eleCt him by a majority that we can be
proud of.
THE MfiN FOR ASSESSOR.
JOHN D. SIEBE, Republican nominee for As
sessor, has made the campaign for re-election
upon the record of his past services. To the
bitter attacks made upon him, and to the many mis-
representations of his opponents, he has made no vin
dictive reply. His works speak for him. He has
served the people eight years in the office of Asses
sor, and that service is all the vindication he needs
from such charges as his opponents have put for
ward.
The excellence of Mr. Siebe's official career is
proven by the fact that his opponents have had to
' resort to the most elaborate misrepresentations in
i order to form even the semblance of an argument
against his re-election. Four years ago, at the con
\ elusion of his first term of office, even the Examiner
conceded that his assessments had been fair, and his
administration honest and efficient. This year, at the
close of his second term, his work has won the ap
! proval not only of Republicans, but of the Non
* Partisans and the Populists, and he has the indorse
i ment of the conventions of those parties for re
| election.
The canvass made by Mr. Siebe and his friends has
been straightforward, manly and clean. He does not
seek re-election by aspersing the character of his
opponents, but upon his own merits as an official who
has done his duty in office and served the people
faithfully and well. The taxpayers know Mr. Siebe,
and out of that knowledge they have given him the
popular title of "Honest John Siebe." It is a title of
honor, for it has been honorably earned by stanch in
tegrity in all the relations of life. That fact is now
well understood, and all voters who desire an honest
and impartial Assessor, one who has been tried and
found true, will vote for John D. Siebe.
fl GOOD LOCOL GOVERNMENT.
ONE of the gratifying features of this campaign
has been the earnest attention given to the
local issue of good municipal government. It
has been the rule that Congressional and State elec
tions have caused voters to overlook city affairs to
a great extent in past contests, and, accordingly, weak
or vicious men have been chosen to city and county
offices simply because the people were more or less
indifferent to the comparative merits of candidates.
It has not been so this year. The local campaign
has been conducted as systematically and as zealously
as that for State offices or for members of Congress.
Every point involved has been thoroughly discussed,
the personal and political deserts of aspirants for
office weighed and considered, and the people will go
to the polls to-morrow well informed of every issue,
whether of men or of measures, on which they will
have to vote.
It is not due to chance that this public interest in
the municipal campaign has come about. The events
of the Phelan administration have been of a nature
that compel the attention of citizens. The Mayor
entered office under the fairest auspices. A large body
of independent citizens, representing industrial and
property interests, voted for him and expected great
things of him. To these men his career has been one
of bitter disappointment. Instead of giving the city
an honest administration he has used all its patron
age to further his political ambitions, and has been
more unscrupulous and more domineering than any
other official or boss in our political history.
Mayor Phelan was largely responsible for the elec
tion of the majority of the Board of Supervisors, and
that majority has been thoroughly corrupt. He was
responsible for the election of the majority of the
Board of Education, and the board has given rise to
scandals involving frauds of almost all kinds from
something like petty larceny to something like whole
sale plunder.
The renomination of this incompetent Mayor and
unscrupulous boss roused the citizens to a sense of
their duty to the city. It was felt that a strong man
would be needed to defeat Phelan, intrenched as he
is in power, possessed of large wealth and surrounded
by a band of intense partisans whose political ambi
tions are bound up with his own, and for a time many
people believed he could not be beaten at all.
The nomination of Charles L. Patton had the effect
of rousing the hopes and energies of the taxpayers
and of all citizens who desire good government. His
candidacy aroused enthusiasm at the start. From the
day of his nomination popular interest in the local
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1898.
canvass has been as keen as that in the State against
Maguire and the single tax. For once it may be said
our people have given heed to their home affairs,
and the outcome is no longer doubtful.
It must be borne in mind, however, by every voter
that to assure a good local government Mayor Pat
ton should have the support of a Republican Board
of Supervisors and a Republican Board of Education.
The overthrow of the Phelanites should be made com
plete. When we eliminate Phelan from our politics
let us eliminate along with him all the gang of job
chasers whom he has brought to the front and put
forward as candidates for office.
BY the votes to be cast to-morrow California will
declare her attitude toward the politics of the
day and the destiny of the nation. She will be
counted for McKinley or for Bryan; for the prin
ciples of protection, sound money and conservative
govenment; or for free trade, a debased currency
and the rule of the discontented, the improvident and
the lawless.
The distinction between constitutional government,
stability and prosperity, as represented by the Repub
lican party, and that formless mass of anarchy and
folly represented by the fusion of the extremists
among Democrats and Populists, has been so clearly
drawn during the canvass that no observing man can
overlook it, no good one ignore it. So wide and
deep is the difference between the two that the con
test is not so much a discussion between political par
ties as a struggle on the part of certain violent and
more or less vicious elements in the community to
overthrow the established order of society and gov
ernment and to reconstruct everything by wholesale
confiscations of property and the destruction, of
vested rights.
Throughout the nation it is everywhere recognized
that the chief issue of the campaign is that of sus
taining the President. The people are to determine
by their ballots whether Congress will uphold* the
administration in dealing with our foreign relations
and in settling the currency problem, or whether
there shall be at Washington a Congress to oppose
the President, hamper him and thwart him.
Were there no other issue in this State than that
which is presented to the nation at large, California
should go Republican. We have, however, a local
issue which renders a Republican victory doubly
necessary to the welfare and the dignity of the com
monwealth. The contest forced upon California by
the nomination of Maguire is more menacing than
that which has been carried on in this campaign in
any other State in the Union. We have here not only
the incentive of patriotism to sustain the administra
tion, but the dire danger of single tax, industrial dis
turbance and anarchy if we vote the other way.
The issues have been fully presented the voters,
the canvass is completed and the campaign is over.
There remains only the duty of rousing the indiffer
ent among the people to a sense of their responsi
bility to the city, to the State and to the nation. This
work should be undertaken by every public-spirited
citizen. There should be a full vote to-morrow, and
to-day each man should speak to his neighbor and
remind him of his duty to vote right.
ONCE more the Phelanitcs in their desperation
have resorted to a bugaboo for the purpose of
frightening citizens into voting their ticket.
The Examiner of yesterday in screaming typo de
clared: "The new charter is in danger. It is again
attacked by its same old enemies. They are not this
time fighting boldly, brazenly and in the open, but
they are fighting just the same â secretly, poisonously,
malignantly."
All of that wild scream is the kind of barbaric
yaup known as a false alarm. The new charter is not
in danger, unless, indeed, the Phelanites sell it out for
votes. All Republican candidates for the Legislature
are pledged to vote for its ratification by that body
this winter. The Republican candidate for Mayor,
Charles L. Patton, is one of the truest and firmest
of its supporters.
In his speech at the closing Republican rally of the
campaign on Saturday evening Mr. Patton, in speak
ing of the Republican platform, which pledges legisla
tive candidates to support the charter, said:
"I am in sympathy with every plank in the
platform, and I pledge myself to support it. I
believe in the new charter, which the Republican
platform favors. No man and no party of men
dare say us nay. It will become the organic
law of this city, and I ask you to see to it that-
Henry T. Ga^e is the man who will sign it as
Governor."
With such an illustration of what the Phelanites
and the Examiner are willing to do in the way of
raising false issues to deceive the people, there is no
telling what they may attempt this morning. All
voters should be on their guard. The desperate fac
tions of Maguire and Phelan are very sure to resort
to some trick to fool or frighten the unwary, and al
most anything in the way of a false alarm, a roor
back or a bold, audacious lie, may be looked for.

victors they would have had something to say con

expense to that paper.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The torpedo boat destroyer Fawn, the
seventh boat of that class built by
Palmer's at Jarrow-on-Tyne, had her trial
on October 14. She 'developed a horse
power of er.^l ami a speed of 30.462 knots,
notwithstanding a heavy sea and high
wind. The contract calied for 6000 horse
power and thirty knots.
Bulgaria is now in the list of naval
powers, a torpedo gunboat named Nadio
ia. of "r.O tons, has just been launched at
Bordeaux, and two armored gunboats arp
building at Leghorn. The rest of the navy
consists of eleven small steamers and the
operations of the Bulgarian navy are al
most entirely confined to service on the
Danube.
The Armstrong Company at Elswlek
had on July last 1015 naval Runs of vari
ous CallbWi under constriiction. The firm
had daring the year then ending fur
nished the nrir.ament for thirteen war
ships built at that yard, besides wholly
or partly equipping with guns sixteen v<.s
hp!s built fct Other yards. Eight ships
were computed and seven wero launched
ranging from KOO to 12.500 ton?.
The Pedro d'Aracon. building at Se.Â«tri
Ponente, Italy, for the Spanish navy has
never been paid for by Spain, and the
phi;) has been Fold by the builders to the
Argentine republic. The vessel is a dupli
cate of the ill-fated Cristobal Colon, run
ashore and surrendered July 3 last off
Santiago to the American squadron. The
Argentine republic has now three sister
ship;; of this very desirable type of ar
mored cruisers.
< advertisements recently appeared in
London and provincial papers in England.
They ran thus: "Wantedâ First-class time
expired gunners for service abroad."
After diligent inquiry it was learned that
it was China who desired the services of
practical - gunners and high wages were
offered for the shipment of three years,
together with free passage ;to and from
China. They were wanted for the cruis
ers building in European yards, and the
men who responded to the advertisements
were told they would have sole charge
of gunnery batteries and were expected
to bring the natives up to a state of effi
ciency equal to that of European soldiers
and sailors. "When the British Admiralty
learned of these tempting offers to its
marines and sailors the police were In
structed to prevent men leaving for China
under, such agreement with the Govern
ment, and each man of the reserves, mili
tary and naval, received a note of warning
against breaking 1 their oath of allegiance
to her Majesty the Queen. : '
Some doubt of the practical utility of
high speed torpedo boat destroyers !s ex
pressed by the British journals. Atten
tion is called to the fact that the Griffon,
when accepted, had averaged over thirty
knotÃ during three hours and developed
6000 horsepower, but when the boat was
placed in commission and underwent the
customary trial the horsepower reached
only 5500 and the speed only twenty-four
knots. Later on the engineers managed
to get up 5970 horsepower and a speed of
twenty-six and a half knots. The ex
planation offered for the discrepancy be
tween thirty and twenty-six and a half
knots Is that the boat, when ready for
sea, was drawing one foot of water more
than when she passed through her ac
ceptance, trial. The excuse offered is a
very good one, but as all the thirty knot
boats have been run on a light displace
ment the same difficulty of increased
draught and weight operates against
them reaching the credited high speeds
under service conditions, and the alleged
thirty knot boat becomes a twenty-four
or twenty-five knot craft in actual prac
tice.
HIS) DELICIOUS NERVE.
As the young man entered the old man
looked up and scowled.
"Well?" said the old man. shortly.
"Your daughter," began the young man,
but the old man cut him off abruptly.
"I've noticed that you've been hanging
around here a good deal," he said. "I
suppose that you've come to tell me that
you love her?"
"No " replied the young man calmly.
"I've come to tell you that she loves me
and wants to marry me."
"What?" roared tne old man.
"She says so herself," persisted the
J Â°^ n never heard of such an exhibition of
egotistical impertinence, ' said the old
man.
"Then you misunderstand me, ex
plained me young man. "My assertion Is
dictated by policy and not by imperU
nence. You see, it's Just this way: What
I want is nothing to you; now, is it?"
"Whyâ erâ not exactly."
"I might want a thousand pounds, but
that wouldn't matter to you, would it?"
"Certainly not."
"You're under no obligations to supply
me with what I want, are you?"
"Hardly."
"Then what a foolish proposition It
would be for me to come to you and say:
'Mr. Parkinson, I have been very favor
ably impressed with your house and fur
niture,' or 'I think I'd like your daugh
ter,' or anything else in that line. But
when your daughter wants anything it's
different. Now. isn't it different?"
"It certainly is different," admitted the
old man cautiously.
"Precisely," said the young man. "She
and I figured that all out very carefully
last night. You see, I have got no par
ticular prospects, and we could both see
that there wasn't one chance in a hun
dred that you would give her to me. Then
she suggested that you had never yet re
fused anything that she wanted, no mat
ter what the cost might be, and that per
haps it would be a? good plan to change
: the usual order somewhat. We sort of
felt that It wouldn't be right to ask you
to do anything for me, but It's different
in her case, as I remarked before, bo
I'm here merely as her agent to say that
she wants me, and that she wants me
very much, and to ask you to please see
that she gets me. She never has wanted
anything so much as she wants me, and 1
am so favorably disposed toward her that
if you care to make the investment, I
shall be quite willing to leave the terms
entirely to you and ner."

ONCE EUGENIE'S HOME.
At one Â«time it seemed probable that
Camden Mouse, Chislehurst, and the
ground surrounding it would fall into the
munis of the builders; but another and a
more satisfactory fate awaits it. A syn
dicate has been formed and Â£83,000 raised
to purchase the mansion and the seventy
acres of land in which it stands. Hence
forth, as has been the case for some
time, the grounds will be used as golf
links, and the building Itself Is to serve
as a clubhouse. The residence takes its
name from the fact that for some time
William Camden, author of the famous
"Britannia," in whose honor the Camden
Society was founded sixty years ago, lived
hero, and here died in 1623. So far as
I am aware, Camden was not a devotee
of the royal and ancient game of golf,
although for some years before he died
the Blackheath Club was in existence.
However this may be, it is probable that,
could the father of English antiquaries
be consulted, he would prefer the meta
morphosis which is now . to be carried
out to the demolition of his old dwelling.
In the early years of this century Mr. and
Mrs. Thomson Bonnar were murdered by
one of their men-servants in Camden
House, a painful circumstance alluded to
in the "Personal Recollections of Mary
Somerville." The house is also associated
with sad incidents in the history of the
Bonaparte family. After his release
from German captivity. Napoleon 111 and
the Empress Eugenic retired to this place
of exile, and it was here, on January 9,
1873, that the Emperor died. When on
the Wednesday following he was burled
in the little Roman Catholic chapel of St.
Mary, which lies on the south edge of the
common, the Prince Imperial, as chief
mourner, followed immediately after the
hearse. Six years later the body of this
Prince, killed, as all will remember, in
Zululand while serving as a volunteer on
a reconnoitering expedition, was borne
from Camden House to be laid In a re
cess in the opposite side of the church to
the remains of his father, Napoleon 111.
Soon afterward the Empress removed
from Chislehurst.â Glasgow Herald.
THE BOMANCE OF A BDTG.
At the close of the battle of the Tcher
naya I was riding from the bridge toward
our camp when a zouave offered me a
huge gold signet ring which he had taken
off the finger of a Russian officer. I need
not mention how he had obtained it, but
I bought it as a memento of the day. It
bore a massive shield with a coat of arms
and a coronet with the letter "Z." I
wore It occasionally on my forefinger as
a signet ring, and the likeness of it is
to be seen in an engraving from a pnoto
graph which adorns one of my books.
Whet) 1 attended the coronation of the
Czar in 1556 Count , adjoint of the
Minister of Finland, to whom I told the
story of the ring, took an impression of
the seal and discovered that the ring
belonged to a colonel whose widow, an
English lady who had been a Misa Hope
of the Commandery of Worcester, was
then living at her country seat some dis
tance from Moscow. I sent the lady the
ring with a few lines to say how fortunate
I esteemed myself to be the means of
restoring her a souvenir of her gallant
husband. Before I left Moscow my fair
countrywoman brought me the ring, and
with many thanks asked me to keep what
was painfully associated with the mem
ory of one whom she could never forget.
1 was not destined to keep it long.
The following year I was on my way
to Sir Colin Campbell's camp, and while
the Nubia was coaling at Aden, Mr. Stew
art Mulrhead of the Seventh Hussars
and I were lodged in a sort of cave for
the night. It was intensely hot, and my
companion, who was a confirmed sybarite,
hired a Somali Arab to fan him to keep
the mosquitoes away while he slept. I
reposed on an adjoining couch, and when
I w.ke in the morning the ring which
I wore on my finger was gone. The hotel
v.a.s turned insiae out, the police were
summoned, all the Somali boys in Aden
were driven like a flock of sheep into
the yard, where their wool was closely
searched and their scanty clothing min
nutely examined; but though I offered
egregious ransom, the P. and O. Isubla
sailed that day with me for Calcutta,
disconsolate and ringless!â William How
ard Russell in The Spectator.
AN AMUSING BUBGLAR.
The Parisian correspondent of the Lon
don Standard says a clever and daring
burglar gave considerable amusement the
other evening to a crowd of several thou
sand persons assembled on the Place de
la Bastile, who were attracted uy the
spectacle of a large number of policemen
exploring the roofs of a block of houses
In the square. The Standard correspond
Â»ut States that on returning home at 6
o'clock in the evening Lieutenant Metay
er of the Republican Guard, discovered a
burglar in his apartment at 6 Place de la
Bastile. The man was rummaging among
the furniture for valuables, 'lhe lieuten
ant of K<'Â»<larmeF. n ot caring to tackle a
burglar alone,, sent the house porter for
the police.
After the lapse of ten minutes several
officers appeared, and, with Lieutenant
Metayer, they ascended to hisjapartment,
which had been ransacked. The burglar
had taken to the roof, and he was followed
during two hours to the great entertain
ment of the crowd below. They explored
every chimney stack and every nook of
the roof of the buildings without discov
ering the thief. At length a policeman,
who had entered a lodging house by a
window, discovered the tattered clothes
of the burglar in a room on the top floor,
but no other trace of the owner.
It would appear that the man, with
great self-possession, had taken off his
ragged clothes and put on a quite new
suit belonging to one of the lodgers. Thus
dressed he had descended the front stair
case, and bowing to the lodging house
keeper at the door, mingled with the
crowd outside to watch the police on the
roof. He is still at large.
A CRITICISM OF WORDSWORTH.
He pours Into his personages the strong
life and moving breath of genius; but
they have little of the air of the mart or
the'farmyard. They have, Indeed, all that
which Is so complf-tely wanting In the
heroes of Lord Byron, the absolute truth
of being, the nature which Is so uniform
under so many varieties: they are made
up of the elements of universal but want
the accidents of social humanity. Words
worth appears to take no pleasure in
watching the entangled threads of pas
sion which bind together crowds with
such many colored, yet scarcely distin
guishable feelings. He retires from the
conflict of mingled and heterogeneous in
terests. He loves to muse by winding
rivers; but the tumultuous current of
men's ordinary motives has little for his
contemplation. He delights to gaze unon
cities; but it is when "all that mighty
heart is lying still."
He diffuses his affections over every
thing around him, and lets them be re
stricted by no arbitrary limits and con
fined within no sectarian lnclosures. He
looks around upon the world and upon
man with eyes of serene rejoicing, and
traces all the workings of -that spirit of
good of whose Influence he is conscious in
his own heart. Out of his want of that
mastery over forms which was never pos
sessed so perfectly by any one as by
Shakespeare, he cannot make so intelligi
ble to all men as he otherwise might the
depth and value of his own feelings. Like
those angela who are made a name of
flre, he burns with a cairn and holy light,
and the radiance which shows so strange
amid the contrasted glare and blackness
of the present will blend with the dawn
ing of a better time as with its native
substance.â F. D. Maurice in the Ath
enaeum of IS2B.
MOUNT WASHINGTON SLIDE
BOARDS.
The slideboards used by the workmen
on the Mount Washington -Railway are
always of great interest to Visitors. They
originated in necessity and are used by
the workmen to make the descent of the
mountain after the close of each day's
work. The best riders have been known
to go from the summit to the base, three
miles, in three minutes. About 1 o'clock
each day one of the workmen makes the
descent to examine the track, and see that
it is in good conditionâ always preceding
the downward train.
The board is constructed so as to fit
the top of the cog rail. It has two guid
ing arms, one on each side. A piece of
iron projects from these arms to a point
underneath the rail, which slightly pro
jects from the timber on which It rests.
By pulling up on the handles, or arms,
the speed of the slideboard can be check-
Ed and thus prevent it and its rider from
flying off into space, as it speeds at a fear
ful rate downward to the bottom of the
mountain. No one except th, workmen
is permitted to use them, as it requires
experience to manage them without OMK
gerto the rider. Many years ago. not long
after the road was constructed, an exper
ienced person connected with the signal
station, while making a descent, ran into
a descending train and was instantly
The workmen come up with their slide
boards from the- base in the morning, on
the first train, and they are left at dif
ferent points along the road, where tney
are engaged in making repairs on tne
track. At night, at the close of work,
they get on their boards and slide to tne
base station, and they can be u.=mani>
seen by those on the last train for the
summit. As they come dashing down tne
track at a fearful speed it would seem
impossible to stop them, but that is eas
ily done by applying the brakes, though it
would be dangerous for an inexperienced
person to attempt to manage them.â

THE TEMPLES OF SIVA.
The shape of the temples of Siva, the
destroyer, does not differ from those or
the other Indian gods. The chief entrance
into the great temple, says a writer in the
Architect, is by a high, massive pyramid,
the top of which has generally the form
of a crescent. It Invariably faces tne
east. â  Beyond the â  gate there is a large
court, at "the further extremity of which
another â  gate leads - through a pyramid
of less height but of the same form. A
small yard separates it = from the temp
of the idol. In the middle of it there is
either a huge bull or a linga carved in
stone, raised on a pedestal or put under
a canopy supported by four pillars, â  . *â  ">â

St. Andrew (white on a blue ground) and
the diagonal cross or saltier of St. Pat
rick (red on a white ground.) The term
Union Jack is also applied to a small flag
containing only the union, without the

stars representing the States of the Union,
which is seen at the bowsprit of Ameri

MISS AND MRS.â M. E.. City. Miss la
a title prefixed to the name of any un

tress, written in the abbreviated form of
Mrs., is applied chiefly and specifically to a
married woman. When a court grants
a woman a divorce and allows her the
privilege of resuming: her maiden name, it
does not give her a legal right to adopt
the prefix Miss or Mrs. The law does not
recognize either Mistress (Mrs.) or aibe,
but simply recognizes a woman by her
given and family name. For instance,
fn the case of a woman whose family
name is Johnson and whose given name
is Mary and not married, the law would
recognize her as Mary Johnson. If she
should marry John William Jones, the
law would recognize her as Mary JoneÂ»,
and not as Mrs. John William Jones.

It was very lively on the water front
yesterday. A number of whalers arrived
from the Arctic, the transport City of Pu
ebla got away for Manila, there was al
most a murder on the British ship Peleus,
en Italian man-of-war got in from Cen
tral America and an attempt was made to
take the wrecked river steamer J. D.
Peters to Hunters Point drydock.
Charles Wilson, boatswain of the Peleus,
was responsible for all the trouble on that
vessel and he is in consequence locked up
in the Harbor Police Station with a
charge of "assault to murder" against
him. Chief Officer M. Andreus of the
Peleus tells the story of the trouble as
follows. /
The men had all been ashore Saturday
r.ight and some of them had sore heads
this morning. They had washed down the
decks in a slipshod manner, but as it
was Sunday 1 excused them. Shortly af
ter this the boatswain, Charles Wilson,
came aboard the worse for liquor. He
at once noticed that the decks were not
properly washed and ordered the men to
uo the job over again. L Interfered and
pent the boatswain to his room and or
dered the men forward.
"The boatswain went to his room, but
while my back was turned he came out
again and went up on the bridge. John
aii-Intosh, an A. li., was there, and the j
two men began quarreling. I started for- I
ward to separate them, but before I got
there Michael Scott, another A. 8., rushed
to Mclntosh's assistance, and the entire
crew followed him. A general scuffle fol
lowed, but I didn't know a knife was
being used until Mclntosh cried out 'I'm
stabbed,' and fell to ttie deck. 'My God
he's done me up, too,' cried Scott, and
he also fell to the deck. I then got the
men separated and AVilpon went to his
room, while some one sent lor the am
bulance."
At the Harbor Receiving Hospital Dr.
Zabala found that Mclntosh had three
Bevere wounds -fTi the stomach, through
which the Intestines were protruding, and
two in the left breast. After he had been
fixed up as comfortably as possible Cap
tain Dunleavy took his 'ante-mortem state
ment. Later in the day, however. Ale-
Intosh rallied considerably and he now
has a slight chance for his* life.
Scott wus stabbed twice in the hip and
once in the breast. His wounds are not i
dangerous. Officers Ellis and Shaw ar- i
rested Wilson. Behind his bunk they !
found the large sheath knife with which
h<? had done the stabbing, while in his
coat pocket was found a pocket knife
with the large blade open. He asserts that
he acted in self-defense, as no other
course was open to him when the crew
rose against him.
The Italian protected cruiser Etna ar
rived from Acapulco yesterday. She has
been outside for nearly a fortnight, as the
captain of the Mail Company's Acapulco
saw her when he was coming here from
Panama. The &tna is on a cruise around
the world, and has been in the Pacific for
over six months. In June last she was in
South American waters and has been
gradually working her way north.
Pilot Scott of the Gracie 8 brought the
cruiÃer into port. As she passed up the
bay the stars and stripes were run up at
tha fore and a national salute was fired
Shortly afterward the Italian flag was
run up at Alcatraz and a return salute
was fired from the fort. Later in the day
the Italian Consul. Chevalier Carlo F\
Verra. went on board and the usual sa
lute was fired for him.
It is about two years since an Italian
warship was in the bay. The Etna is a
flrst-class cruiser and was built in IÂ«SS.
Her displacement is 3470 tons and her reg
istered horsepower 6018. with which she
can average fifteen knots an hour. Her
length is 283.5 feet, breadth 43.5 feet and
depth 19.2 feet. She 'carries two 10-inch
25-ton guns, six 6-inch breech-loaders,
live 6-pounders and ten magazine guns.
She carries 20 officers and 320 of a crew.
The chances are that the Etna will go
on the drydock here and will then pro
ceed home by way of Japan and China.
The whaling bark Alice Knowles, steam j
whalers Balaena and Belvedere arrived j
from the Arctic yesterday. The Knowles
only brought in COO barrels of sperm oil, '
â¢while the Ualaena brought in 4R.000 pounds â¢
of whalebone and SOO barrels of oil. The I
Belvedere took six whales, but only a !
portion of the same came in on her, the |
other part having been sent down before- â 
hand.
The bark Mermaid that has been work- '<
ing her way here from Kotzebue .Sound i
for thirty-nine days arrived in port at
last. The gold hunters got cold feet as i
soon as they reached Kotzebue and then '
began quarreling among themselves. Cap- j
tain Weeks left them and came down on \
another vessel. Captain Robinson brought
the vessel into port.

Attempt Made to Tow the J. D. Peters From Sausalito to the
Hunters Point Drydoek.
THE river steamer J. D. Peters, that was wrecked in a collision with the collier Czarinia last week and was after
ward beached in Richardsons Bay, Is still on the mud fiats. The tugs Rescue and Sea Queen went over to
her yesterday afternoon. It was the Intention to tow the steamer off the flate and up to Hunters Point dry
ock where she was to be overhauled. H. J. Corcoran, superintendent of the California Navigation and Improve
ment Company, owner of the Peters, and Captain Grey, superintendent of the towboat company, went over on the
Rescue, but after several attempts had been made they decided to postpone the matter until to-day. The Rescue
got on one side of the wrecked vessel and the Sea Queen on the other, but the difficulty was in finding a place on
the hull of the wreck to which to make fast. Superintendent Corcoran thinks there are at least five Chinese in the
forward cabin of the J. D. Peters. This place was built up especially for the use of the Chinese employed on the
various ranches along the river, and aa it was in the eyes of the vessel and below the main deck it must have been
flooded very quickly. The Chinese runner for the company is known to have been drowned. He ruehed on deck as
soon as warned by the chief engineer, but remembering that he had $300 in a bundle on his bunk, he rushed back
to secure it and was never seen again. It is thought that four others who were smoking opium when the collision
occurred were also drowned. The Chinese Consul and the chairmen of the six companies have written to the navi
gation company, informing the management that five Chinese are missing and asking that the bodies be cared for
when recovered. Quite a number of Chinese went out to the dry-dock to meet the Peters during the afternoon in
the hope of learning something about their relatives as soon as the vessel was docked, but they were disappointed.
Another attempt will be made to get the Peters on the dry-dock this morning.

NUMBER FIFTEEN
THE WINNING NUMBER
ELECTION RETURNS WILL VERI
FY THE PROPHECY.
It Is the Number on the Official
Ballot of Henry S.
Martin.
The campaign that has been made
by Henry S. Martin, the Republican
nominee for Sheriff, has been so thor
ough and effective that his election is
assured by a large majority beyond all
possible doubt- His great personal pop
ularity and his unsullied record as an
enterprising and progressive citizen
made him, from the date of his nomina
tion, one c-f the strongest candidates
on the ticket. Friends have rallied
to his support from all quarters, and
voters, irrespective of party, have lound
in him all those very desirable quali
ties that are a prerequisite to the suc
cessful administration of all public of
fices.
That he will be elected Sheriff is a
fact generally conceded by all who have
canvassed the situation thoroughly. He
will make a capable, honest and up
right officer, one to whom all can point
with pride. He is a man of large
property interests in this, the city of
his birth, and is therefore very much
interested in seeing all offices adminis
tered with the sole object of good gov
ernment in view. He will, as Sheriff,
prove himself to be thoroughly deserv
ing of the confidence reposed in him
by all who vote number fifteen on the
official ballot.

Dr. Dennis of the South Ends Dis
qualified for Fouling in the
Outrigged Skiff
Race.
The championship rowing regatta of the
Pacific Association of the Amateur Ath
letic Union was held yesterday at i/)ng
Bridge. The day was a lovely one, and
the bridge was crowded with spectators,
as also was the deck of a large ship
moored alongside. In the early part of
the day the water was quite smooth, out
later a light breeze ruflled its surface,
The winners in yesterday's races hold the
bay championships until next year's
championship regatta.
In the intermediate four-oared barge
race the Pioneers had the inside station,
the Ariels the center and the Dolpmns
the outside. After rowing a few strokes
the Dolphins turned back, having crossed
the starting line merely to save their en
trance fees. The Ariels, rowing a good
stroke In their new barge, came home
winners by ten lengths. Time. 7 mm. ii^a
sees.
In the senior outrigged skiff, first heat,
| F. Ayers of the Alamedas and Dr. C. C.
Dennis, the former having the outside
station and the latter the Inside, were
the only starters. Both men, being sure
of their places in the final heat, took
things easily. Two hundred yards from
the linish they began to pull a little, and
F. Ayers crossed the line half a length
to the good. Time, 10 mm. 16 sec.
In the junior four-oared barge race the
Ariel crew had the inside station, tne
tPioneers the center and the Alamedas the
i fifttÃjde. The Ariels led at the start, the
steering wildly. Up to the staKes
: the order was: Ariels, Pioneers and Ala
medas. The Ariels and the Pioneers raced
I bow and bow, but 2iW hundred yards from
the finish the Ariels were fouled and
stopped rowing, allowing the Pioneers tq
win and the Alamedas to take second
place. The Ariels claimed a foul, but it
was disallowed on the ground that it did
not affect the result, lime, 7 mm. 45 sec.
The Junior outrigsred skiff race, first
heat, was won by Flckert by four lengths,
Orr second. La Chapelle third ana J.
Lyons fourth. Time, SÂ» mm. 19 sec.
In the- senior outrigged skiff, second
heat, Ochs rounded the stake first, pulled
strongly and won by six or seven lengths;
C. Ayers second. Time, 9 mm, 2% sec.
The Junior shell race was practically
a rowover for Klunder. Time, 11 mm.
23 3-5 sec.
- The senior four-oared barge race was
easily won by the Alamedas. The Pioneers
beat tho South Ends for second place
p.fter a close contest. Time, 7 mm. 30 sec.
In the senior shell race H. A. Wlttkopf
of the Ariels had the inside station, A.
W. Pape of the Dolphins center and
Frank Duplissea of the South Ends out
side. Pape rowed a wherry; the others
were in shells. At the start Duplissea
crowded Pape. but afterward cleared
away from him. Pape and Wlttkopf
turned almost together; ttien Pape took
the lead, followed 'by Wlttkopff, with
Duplissea twenty lengths behind. Witt
koff hung on to Pape out could not catch
him, tho Dolphin sculler winning by a
length. Time, 8 mm. 44 sec.
In the junior outrigged skiff, second
heat, only A. Webb and W. O. Hansen,
both of the Alamedas, started. Being sure

ers took things easily, W. Hansen win
ning by about two lengths. Time. 10 mm.
11 sec.
In the senior outrigged skiff, final heat,
F. Ayers of the Alamedas had the inside
station, C. Ayers of the Alamedas inside
center, C. OchÂ» of the Pioneers outsiuo
center and Dr. C. C. Dennis of the South
Ends outside. Dennis started off with a
rush, and fouling Ochs broke the blade of
one of Och's sculls. Ochs stopped and
turned back. After the turn Dennis led
and came in a winner by two lengths from
F. Ay its, C Ayers a bad third. Dr. C. C.
Dennis was disqualified for fouling Ochs.

In the junior outrigged skiff, final heat,
W. G. Hansen of the Alamedas had inside
station, Atwell Webb of the Alamedas
center and J. Fickert of the Ariels out
side. Flckert got away with the lead and
led after the turn. Then he took Webb's
water, and Webb, overtaking him, ran
right into his boat. The foul was of the
clearest kind, and the race was given to
Webb. Time, 9 mm. 19 2-5 sec.
The course was understood to be one
and a half miles with a turn, but the sur
prisingly good time made in every event
shows that the distance cannot have been
rightly estimated. The course was prob
ably not more than one and a quarter
miles.

How Far the Plan of Reorganization
Has Progressed â Elections to
Be Held in the Naval
Militia.
The approaching election has engrossed
n much of the time of the citizens of the
State that during the past week but lit
tle attention has been paid to the matter
of reorganization of the National Guard.
Men who wish to Join the guard under
went physical examination for three com
panies, and in two there was about thirty
men who stood the test, but the third, the
company of the Fifth Infantry, located
at San Rafael, had but seven men out
of more than thirty petitioners who were
rfady to be examined. Thus far the ex
aminations have been for Companies B,
C, D, O, X and L of the First Infantry,
and D and F of the Fifth. Company I of
the First haÂ« sent in its petition, and the
men will be examined next week after
the election. There yet remain to be
examined men for Bix companies of the
First Infantry, nine for the Becond, six
for the Fifth, eight for the Sixth and
twelve for the Seventh.
It is stated by those who have charge
of the reorganization that if those com
panies which have sent in petitions to join
the guard do not make a better showing
than did the company at San Rafael they
will lose their chances of being admitted.
There will be three elections in the Na
val Militia this month. Lieutenant Col
onel Henry F. Emeric has been detailed
to preside at an election to be held on the
Marion on the 15th inst. for lieutenant,
vice C. C. Dennis, term expired. He will
undoubtedly be re-elected. Lieutenant L
L. Chandler, commanding the Third Di
vision, will preside at an election to be
held on the Plnta on the 23d inst. for en
sign, vice George B. Smith, deceased- and
Lieutenant D. F. Hunt, commanding the
Sixth Division, wil preside in the armory
at Santa Barbara on the 22d inst. at an
election to be held to fill the vacancy
caused by the resignation of J. J. Delany.
Ensign Delany entered the auxiliary navy
as a mate. When the auxiliary was mus
tered out. Mate Delany continued in the
naval service of Uncle Sam, and is now
on duty on the Pensacola.
The presiding officers have been in
structed in orders that they must notify
each successful candidate that he wlil
have to" be examined in the prescribed
t.icties, rules and regulations governing
the United States navy, and the Na
tional Guard of California, the provisions
of the Code of California relating- to the
National Guard, forms of naval ordtrs
records, correspondence and general Qual
ifications.
Last Friday night Lieutenant Com
mander G. W. Kingsland, chief engineer
of the Naval Militia, who has recently
returned from a trip in Alaska, took the
men of his command out for a cruise
around the bay in the reserve's steam
launch and gave them instructions in the
construction of the engine and the meth
ods of operating it. Now that he has re
turned to duty he will devote consider
able time to the instruction of the men In
the engine room of the Marion.
raptain Leslie Hewes, commanding the
Signal Corps of the Second Brigade, is
working hard to redeem the corps from
the adverse criticisms that have t> -on
made in regard to it. It is his purpose
he said recently, to make the corps a
signal corps as it should be, and to that
end lie will devote his energies. He alÃo
stated that in hia efforts he is being sec
onded by the men of his command. In ad
dition to the usual drill work in wire and
flag, the men are receiving instructions
in ningle stick exercise, taking lessons In
the use of the saber, and they are a,lso
practicing with carbines at the reduced
target in the basement of the Ellis-street
armory.
There-iB at this tim<* considerable spec
ulation as to what changes will take place
in the guard upon the change of adminis
tration. The most important position that
Is attracting attention is that of adjutant
general. The incumbent. General Barrett,
will be a candidate to sucoeed himself
and Colonel George Stone, Colonel J. c
Currier and Major Charles Jansen, In
spector of the Second Brigade, will also
present their claims for the office.

night In California Hall to take steps to
form a company to take the placÂ« of Com
pany I of the First California Volunteers,

PEACE JUBILEE SERVICE.
Soldiers and Sailors Attend the Cal-
vary Presbyterian Church.
A peace Jubilee Bervlce was held last
night at the Calvary Presbyterian
Church, corner of Gearv and Powell
streets. The interior of the church was
handsomely decorated with national col
ors and palms. A motto in white letters,
"On Earth Peace," was strung just over
the pulpit, and a large star, formed by
incandescent lamps, hung below it.
A large numuer of army officers and
soldiers from the Presidio occupied the
right division of the center seats, and
about one hundred marines from the
training ship Adams filled the seats in
the left division. The programme ren
dered during the evening was as follows:
Organ prelude, ProfesÃor R. D. Burness;
invocation, Rev. John Hemphlll; anthem,
"Glory Be to God on High and on Eearth
Peace"." choir; solo, "Battle Hymn of the
Republic," W. C. Campbell; address,
"War as a Means of Permanent Peace."
Chaplain O. C. Miller, Eighth California
United States Volunteers; address, '"The
Moral Side of Army Life," H. J. McCoy,
treasurer of the Army Christian Commis
sion; address, "Current Events," Rev.
John Hemphill; tenor solo, "Peace I
Leave With You," Herbert Williams.
Rev. Mr. Hemphlll said that the war
with Spain had accomplished five things
it made the American flag more respected,
more strongly united the North and the
South brought England on closer terms
of friendship with the United States than
had existed since the Declaration of Inde
pendence in 1776, gave to the world proof
that the God of Hosts assists those who
flght in the defense of humanity and
opened up a great field for Christian mis
sionary work. _

MERITS OF THE CONFESSIONAL.
The Rev. Father Mahony's Sermon
at St. Ignatius Church Last
Evening.
At the usual Sunday evening service of
vespers and benediction at St. Ignatius
Church last evening Rev. Father Ma
honey, S. J., preached a sermon on the
benefits of confession.
"Christ instituted the confession," said
he. "before he left the apostles, and he
told thenf, 'Whose sins you forgive they
are forgiven.' Our Savior could not be
charged with making a useless institution,
because he saw the human heart and the
violation that rested there. In consider
ing the confessional we will take the
charge that !s sometimes made against it
by the ignorant that it was instituted by
the Catholic priests. That charge is
easily answered. In the first place,
for a priest to sit for hours together In a
little cramped box of the confessional
is a very tiresome and unhealthy task,
as the ventilation is bad. In warm
weather the box is suffocating, and In
winter it is nearly cold enough to freeze
one's blood. The priests also, if they in
stituted the confession, would certainly
have made a rule that they would not

Parsimony In the Navigation of
River Craft That Will Cause
Passengers to Enter Claims
for Damages.
BY SAM W. WALL.
Bp*ci*l Correspondence of Tha Call.
DA"WSON, Oct. 1. â The unexpected
has happened this year indeed. The
Yukon hag not Been such an open sea-
Bon for a decade. Ten days ago a
light fall of snow covered the ground
and everybody conceded that winter
had come. The snow passed away, and
another week of perfect Indian sum
mer has succeeded it. Frequently
heavy frosts and a thin glaze of ice
that forms in the pools during the night
are the only evidences that summer
has passed, for the vast old Yukon
flows as tranquilly as though it never
felt the grip of winter, the air is balmy
and the sun shines brifrhtly in a clear
sky every day. So near its close one
cannot but smile at the dark proph
ecies with which many of the ao-called
old-timers worked their names into
print early in the season. There was to
be no water in the river sufficient to
carry a boat to Dawson. because there
had been such slight fall of snow the
preceding winter. The fact was there
had been quite the usual fall of snow,
and there has been all the season a
most unusual flow of water. There has
been no day since the river cleared of
Ice that a boat drawing five feet of
water could not navigate the river with
perfect freedom. That so many found
great difficulty in getting up was
chargeable to the Incompetency of
those in charge. Never perhaps in all
the history of business enterprise has
so much capital been placed in the care
of lnexperiei "- J, untrustworthy and
incompetent hands. In order to save a
few dollars on the salary of a steam
boat captain or perhaps to find a place
for some poor weakling who could not
find one for himself positions of the
highest responsibility, requiring expe
rience and executive force, were be
stowed where these qualities were con
spicuously absent. But for the unusu
ally favorable conditions, the uniformly
high water and the great length of the
season, the record of last year with re
gard to the number of persons winter
bound on the river at a distance from
their destination would have been far
outdone this year. As it is there will,
no doubt, be many who .will fail to
reach Dawson. Of the boats arriving
this week, the Boston and Alaska Com
pany's Governor Pingree and Philip B.
Low, having in tow the barge New
York, are probably the most derelict of
all the great fleet that attempted the
ascent of the river this year. The boats
started from Puget Sound on the 11th
of June in tow of the same company's
ocean steamers, the Laurada and -he
Brixhai... and did not arrive here until
the 25th of September. The passengers,
besides having to practically work their
â¢way up the river chopping and loading
the wood for the furnaces and shifting
and reshifting and loading and unload
ing freight, as the almost daily encoun
ters with sandbars made necessary,
were almost starved.
The boats were carrying several hun
dred tons of supplies for the Canadian
military post of Fort Selkirk. Arrived
at Rampart City, the Canadian officers
who accompanied the outfit, becoming
anxious, offered to take charge of the
boats and get them through, and the
officers of the boats, beginning to feel
their incompetency, accepted the offer.
Two men were sent forward to Daw-
Bon by a boat of another company and
the steamer Seattle was secured at a
cost of $30,000 to go down and bring up
the barge Mfchigan, which had been in
tow of the Pingree, but which was
left at Port Yukon. With the single
tow, the New York, the Low and Pin
grres struggled through the eighty miles
of flats, consuming ten days in so do-
Ing, and thence to Dawson. Here the
officers of the Canadian Government,
on the grounds that the company had
broken its contract In failing to deliver
the military supplies in July, took pos
session of the boats, paid off the <;;n
ployes and assumed entire charge of
the property. Nearly every passenger
on board had some claim against the
company, as there was scarcely a sin
gle instance where they received the
freight or baggage that they had in
trusted to the company's care. They
had intended to bring some action for
recovery against the company, but this
action of the Government presented
a complication that was difficult to
meet. The passengers, as well as ship
pers' freight, had been broken into and
plundered. Some of the passengers
could not find a single package of their
freight. Immediately upon arrival
Captain Blakeley of the barge New
York was arrested on a charge of
broaching cargo. He is still in jail.
He is thought to have made away with
a quantity of whisky, the property of
Donahoe & Co. Colonel McCook,
United States Consul, is of the opinion
that the Canadian Government has
overstepped its limitation in arbitrarily
seizing the boats for broken contracts,
and that it may be compelled to pay
damages. The recourse of the Gov
ernment, he says, was a suit for dam
ages, and nothing more. The Boston
and Alaska Company is in the hands of
a receiver, and it is understood that it
will change its name for a contem
plated campaign next spring, in order
to avoid as much as possible conse
quences of its bad management.
Captain Worth has been arrested at
Circle City on n charge of embezzling
some 418,000 claimed to be due Carpen
ter and the other owners of the May
West, of which Captain Worth was
master and part owner. Captain
Worth superintended the building of
the little steamer at St. Michael last
fall. With her he was frozen in at a
point about ninety miles below Minook
He passed a very bad winter with his
unhappy passengers. He arrived early
in the spring and, although he had
plenty of troub'- in squaring accounts
with passengers, many of whoso out
fits had been consumed during the longr
winter, although his contract required
him to feed them unti he landed ihem
at Dawson, he finally effected h's re
lease and carried a boatload or* pas
sengers down the riv<- at good figures
âthe first run of Klonrlikers for the
outside after the beginning of the
clean-up. It was for appropriating
this passage money that he was ar
rested. Captain Worth sets his ser
vices against the claim and declares
he dees not owe the company one cent.
The situation in Dawson at this writ
ing has nothing of that terrifying ele
ment that characterized it at this sea
son last year. Sixty-three boats have
reached here from below during the
season. Very many of the big
boats brought barges â one or
them the Louise Captain Dixon,
bringing two barges with 1000
tons. Not less than 5000 boats have
come down the river, including flat
boats and barges, and their average
would be at least two tons each. There
are about 25,000 people who will win
ter in the city or vicinity and there
will be plenty of provisions at rates
quite reasonable, as compared with
those of last year. Flour, for instance,
is $8 a sack, beans 15 cents a pound,
bacon 60 cents a These are
the staple of staples. Canned meats
are 75 cents per two- pound cans. Fresh
meat, of which there is lust now plenty,
averages $1 a pound. Sugar is 30 cents,
coffee 75 cents and milk and cream 50
cents and $1 per can. Butter is scarce
and brings $1 50 a pound. ' Window
glass is almost as hard to get as it was
last year, and $2 is âadily paid for a |
: small pane. Bruoms are also not to !
| be had, although there is considerable
demand. These are a few of the short
ages. The stock of sheet iron for stoves
and pipe is not large and the prices
of these things are higher than last
i year. Generally speaking, there is an
abundance of everything needful and
very "many of the luxuries of the outer
world. Luxuries, of course, Buch as
candy and silk dresses and electric
lights come proportionately high.
There has been during all the sum
mer and there 1b still a great deal of
sickness in and about the city, al
though not nearly so much as has been
made to appear by alarmists. Reports
have been continually circulated here
and have doubtless reached the outside
to the effect that funerals take place
nearly every hour of the day, and that
the superintendents of hospitals falsify
their statements as to the number of
deaths. A late report was industrious
ly repeated to the effect that smallpox
was raging here, but that the cases
were being concealed. I have made a
canvass of the doctors in the city, the
hospitals and the undertakers and have
counted the mounds in the graveyard.
There is or has been no case of small
pox in the city. Typhoid fever has
been prevalent during the summer and
is still so.
Almost every individual has suffered
more or less from dysentery, which has
in many cases proved fatal. This is
chiefly caused by the water, the com
plaint being accompanied in almost all
cases by symptoms of arsenical poi
soning. Scurvy also still has its vic
tims. Withal, however, the death rate
has at no time exceeded an average of
one a day. The population here, it is
learned from actual census taking, has
ranged from 20,000 to 30,000. There are
now in St. Mary's Hospital 135 patients,
In* the Good Samaritan 35 and in pri
vate hospitals 20. The sick, however,
are to be found in tents and cabins
everywhere throughout the town and
the entire mining region, many in
wretched discomfort. It is easier to
lose one's health in this country than
to find the fortune they are all seeking.
The dead or disabled are to be seen
every day being carried on stretchers
through the streets or over the rough
trails from the mines to the hospitals
or burial grounds of the city. For all
this, however, the death rate in propor
tion to the population is not excessive.
Since my last report of the deaths in
the city the following have died:
Bishop of New Brunswick, Frank Miller
of Aberdeen, Wash.; Mrs. Waddell, for
merly of 135 Page street, San Fran

The little steamer Willie Irving,
which carries this dispatch as far as
White Horse, advertises this as her last
trip before seeking winter' quarters. She
has made nine round trips since the Ist
of July. Her master, by the way. was
married only two days ago, the bride
being Dr. Luella Day, formerly of Chi
cago. The ceremony took place at the
Fairview, Dawson's swell hotel. Mrs.
McConnell was for six years superin
tendent of the Metropolitan Railroad
Hospital, and came to see Dawson dur

since resigned.

Disgraceful Sequel of the Attack by

Special Dispatch to The CalL
HAVANA, Nov. 6.â J. B. CaJdwell
and F. T. Stewart, attached to the
quartermaster's department, have been
stricken with yellow fever. They had
been occupying: apartments at the Ho
tel Pasaje, adjoining those of Colonel
Williams, the chief quartermaster, who
is also suffering from the disease. Both
men were removed this afternoon, un
der the order of Dr. JLaine, to El Ve
dado fever hospital. In the opinion of
Dr. iLaine and other physicians the Ho
tel Pasaje is infected and there will
probably be a stampede among the
American guests when the fact becomes
known.
Following the usual petty jealousies
existing between the Commissioners,
to which the medical corps furnishes no
exception, the doctor who attended
Caldwell and Stewart gave no notice of
their illness to the United States Com
missioners at El Vedado. Colonel Wil
liams being ill, and nobody apparently
being authorized to assume authority
In his place, Stewart, who is a clerk in
the quartermaster's department, lacked
certain attentions that only money
could buy. Instead of the United States
Commissioners being informed an at
tempt was made to collect private sub
scriptions to provide nurses and mcdi-
Caldwell and Stewart have been ill
for several days, but not until this
morning was the fact brought to the
attention of the American Commission
ers, who immediately ordered Dr. Lame
to see the patients and to care for them
at the expense of the Commissioners.
As a result of his examination the re
moval orders were promptly issued,
Dr. Lame considering it his first duty
to care for the health of the large num
ber of Americans living at the Hotel
Admiral Sampson and Generals Wade
and Butler, the United States Evacua
tion Commissioners, are highly incensed
at the action of those who originated
the private subscription for a Govern
ment official.
tThe international agreement as to the
ne between Spain's loss of sovereignty
Cuba and the assumption of full
ilitary control by the United States
seems indefinitely prolonged, with no
immediate hope of relief to a country
which daily grows poorer and more de
populated. On all sides the question is
asked, "How much nearer is the final
solution of the problem than it was
on the day the protocol w r as signed?"
The feeling among the better classes
of intelligent and influential Cubans
may be pretty accurately summed up
in the following observations made by
a representative Cuban merchant of
Havana: "It seems to me, and I think
my views are shared by many, that the
United States Government is dilly
dallying too long with Spain over this
evacuacion question. Of course the
Kblem is a difficult one, but the delay
surely unnecessary. The United
tes has sent here an assortment of
imissions, each more self-important
and mysterious than its predecessor,
and each veiling its operations with a
cloud of secrecy, which, so far as my
American experience goes, really serves
the purpose of obscuring issues and
concealing very small achievements.
Almost nothing has been accomplished.
The spirit of jealousy fills not only the
individual members of all the commis
sions, but also exists between the differ
ent commissions collectively. These ri
valries seem to engross the attention
of the commissioners much more than
the serious questions affecting the wel
fare of Cuba and the dignity and good
faith of the United States.
"First we were told that the date of
occupation by the United States troops
would be November 1. Then December
1 was fixed upon and later we were in
formed that the date for occupation
would be left indefinite. So far as
evacuation is concerned January 1 was
named as an ultimatum, but How it is
rumored that February 1 has been
agreed upon. The people are losing
faith and confidence in the lack of for
mality displayed by the American rep
resentatives. To all questions asking
information on these points the Amer
ican Commissioners, with a superior
smile and an assumption of gravity to
cover their ignorance, reply vaguely and
unsatisfactorily.
"Unless the Washington Government
forces its lethargic commission to
greater activity Cuba will be an im
mense graveyard and its fields barren
before the United States takes posses
sion. The daily records of mortality
show that the population in all parts
of the island is dwindling steadily. En
tire villages are dying of starvation.
On all sides the Spaniards continue
robbing and plundering. In the mean
time these sage, gossiping commission
ers from the United States sit sipping
cool drinks by day and seeking shelter
by night with mortal dread of fever,
yet absolutely impervious to the de
mands of humanity.
"The situation created by this un-
Btainty is still more aggravated by
fact that no one dares to sow crops
cultivate the lands until the present
conditions show some rays of light.
There is no -work for idle hands. Day
by day the number of beggars, thieves
and other forms of vice Increase, while
the number of those able to relieve dis
tress shrinks in the same proportion.
Thus far the United States l^as sent In
the name of humanity a mere pittance
of a million rations and the Red Cross
Society has sent two cargoes of sup'-
C, as to the distribution and dis
l of which there have been many
vorable comments. How far can
relief be expected to go?
"The present conditions cannot be
much longer protracted without sub
jecting the United States to well-de
served criticism. More than that the
elements most in sympathy with the
United States are slowly but surely
falling off and joining the ranks of the
opposition. As you are aware, Senor
de Castro, the Civil Governor, only yes
terday issued orders for the arrest of
263 criminals recently released from jail
and the penal colonies at Ceuta and on
the Isle of Pines. This was rendered
necessary by the alarming increase of
burglaries and highway robberies.
While ttie blockade was on the city was
ruled with an iron hand and cases of
asssault and robbery were almost un
known. To-day, with the release of
criminals and the increase of poverty,
the list of murders and hold-ups is a
very grave affair.
"In addition to the already numerous
paupers and unemployed driven to beg
, from sheer necessity, there aro many
discharged soldiers entirely without
means of support. Their number
reaches into the thousands. Boys and
tfirls of genteel extraction have been
thrown on the streets to beg, live
the lives of beggars or thieves
or to be brought up In jails
or houses of ill fame. Do the
people of the United States realize theso
things? Does the Government of the
United States, morally responsible be
fore the world for the future of Cuba,
Intend to tolerate indefinitely a delay
which by a day makes these bad con
ditions worse?"
General Luque, Spanish Military
Governor of the Holguin division, on
leaving Glbara for Spain, wrote, it is
understood, to Captain General Blanco
to the effect that Glbara, prior to the
American occupation had been govern
ed In ordinary fashion by the Cubans,
who had named municipal officials
whose sober direction of affair com
manded the respect of the Spanish.
But when the Americans entered the
town Colonel Ra^- according to the re
port of General Luque's letter tore the
Cuban flag from all the public build
ings, trampled on it, freely insulted the
Cubans and allowed his men to indulge
in drunken carousals. When the Span
ish troops were embarking, wrote Gen
eral Luque, some 4000 Cubans lined the
road along which the evacuating
Spaniards, with Luque at their head,
marched to the wharf. The Spaniards
raised the cheer, "Viva Espana." which
was lustily answered by the Cubans as
a direct affront to the Americans, after
which the Cubans retired to a place
called Bujari, near Glbara, where they
fortified themselves, "defying American
authority." This is generally reported
as the tenor of Luque's note.
Alfred Bettancourt. a British subiect.
born in Jamaica, was assaulted last
Tuesday by a Spanish officer, who
struck him on the side of the head for
wearing a gold scarfpln in the shape of
a five-pointed star. The officer ordered
Bettancourt under arrest and sent him
before General Arrolas, Military Gov
ernor of Havana, who ordered him im
prisoned. Mr. Jerome, British Vice
Consul, on bein~ notified of the assault,
presented himself at the Captain Gen
eral's palace to protest against an act
of brutality and to demand the instant
release of Bettancourt.
General Blanco at first attempted to
put Mr. Jerome off, then said it would
be an extremely difficult matter to re
lease the prisoner, as he had not been
arrested by the Orden Publico, but by
an army officer, and had been sent to
Jail by the Military Governor. But Mr.
Jerome maintained a firm attitude, in
sisting that he would remain at the
palace until Bettancourt was released.
Finally, after an interchange of mes
sages between General Blanco and Gen
eral Arolas, Mr. Jerome all the while
refusing to budge from the palace, Bet
tancourt was released at a late hour.
These are the bare facts of an assault,
which, under other conditions, might
pass with slight notice, but which is
significant coming on the heels of a
threat made by General Arolas to get
even with Englishmen in Havana be
cause of a protest recently made by
Mr. Mac Lean, manager of the Marjno
Railway, owned by an English com
pany, against the use to which the rail
way stations have been put by Spanish
soldiers stationed to guard them on
I Sundays and holidays. The conduct of
the soldiers was grossly indecent and
excited the indignation of everybody
living in the vicinity of the stations.
When Mr. Mac Lean lodged his com
plaint General Arolas, who is extremely
hostile to the English, as well as to the
Americans, declared that he would gzt
even with the "Saxon rabble."
El Diario de la Marina publishes a
fierce editorial attack on the United
States, declaring that "the whole coun
j try is governed by rum and ignor
ance." It imputes to the American
Government "a breach of faith contrary
to the usages of all civilized countries
in sending war vessels to Porto Rico
after the protocol was signed and oc
cupying the Philippines before the con
ference at Paris has terminated."
MINISTERIAL CRISIS
IN NEWFOUNDLAND
Sir Herbert Murray, the Governor,
Compels a Cabinet Member to
Resign.
ST. JOHNS, N. F.. Nov. 6.â There Is a
serious Cabinet crisis in Newfoundland.
Sir Herbert Murray, the Governor, de
mands the re?' "nation of M. Morine, Min
ister of Finance. The ostensible reason
is that M. Morine is the general counsel
of Mr. Reid, the railway contractor, but
the real cause is the continued friction
between Governor Murray and the Minis
ter.
M. Morine, In tendering his resignation,
points out that Sir William Whiteay, the
former Premier, and Messrs. Emerson
and Morris, members of the late Cabinet,
held a similar relation to the contractor
and that Sir Herbert Murray acquiesced
in the arrangement in all three cases.
He reminds the Governor also i.at he has
been aware ever since April last of his
(Morine's) relation to Mr. Reid, and in
sists that the Governor's omission to in
terfere before stamps his action now as
personal and vindictive.
It is feared that complications will arise,
wrecking the Cabinet and seriously preju
dicing the negotiations regarding the
French treaty shore already under way
before the conference of the settlement of
the disputes between the United States
and Canada. '

WASHINGTON, Nov. 6.â Lieutenant
Nlblack, formerly In charge of the naval
military branch of the Navy Department,
and just detached from the command of
the torpedo boat Wlnslow, which has
gone out of commission, reported at the
Navy Department to-day, enroute to Ma
nila. He will sail from San Francisco on
the 19th, having been assigned to duty
on Admiral Dewey's flagship, the Olym
pia. It was in a large part owing to the
indefatigable efforts of Lieutenant
Niblack that the Naval Militia was devel
oped to the point where it became of
such value to the service during the war.

THE WINNER
AT INGLESIDE
The Courses Were
Very Exciting.
SHORT ENDS NOT FAVORED
MOONDYNE AND PATRIA BEAT
EN BY LAS FALMAb.
'Xhe Crowd "Was the Largest in the
History of the Park â Betting
Good in Ail the
Boxes.
One of the grandest meetings ever held
In an inclosed field took place yesterday
at the Ingrleside Coursing Park. The at
tendance was above the average, there
being nearly 7000 people present. The
Ehortenders again had a bad day of It,
but when a phot did win it was attended
by such good odds that those whose
game it is to pick the shorteniers had a
good chance to pull even on the day.
The bitch Las Palmas beat Moondyne at
8 to 1, and repeated the same trick by
displacing Patria on the bills at 5 to L
Coursing has its disappointments and
its surprises. This was never more clear
ly depicted than when three favorites,
Patria Moondyne and Prince Hal, among
â whom the stake money was supposed to
fall went out one after another, having
been discounted by dogs that wore hard
ly recognized in the betting ring. Los
Palmas sailed to the front by beating
Sloondyne in the first round, and by put
ting out Patria In the third. Moondyne
ID S to 1 favorite, and led off by
a lengths. After making the first
turn he kicked up considerable dust and
me lost in it. Before he could re
cover himself Las Palmas had gained pos
n of the hare, taking thrte turns
snd making the kill. The score was 4
â 
Prince Hal lost the hare in the course
with Mind Your Eye, and as the latter
dog haJ scored the better up to the time
ccurred he secured the decision, Ij\
tst round of the all-age stake Mind
lour Kye and Lottie M were the con
testants. Mind Your Eve worked well.
but her rival was too clever for her, and
?Iter a short but exciting chase was given
he first prise.
The dogs of the A B Kennels have
been ruled off the track. They ar^
Island Boy, Irma, Victor King and four
other saplings. When Volunteer ran Vic
tor King in the fourth round of the puppy
Btake no decision was given and the owner
of the kennela reQutsteu to draw his
dog, giving as a reason that he was fa
tigued. As a matter of fact the dogs
va.s no further gone than his opponent
and the fieldkeeper refused to grant the
request. The owner of the dog protested
st the ruling of the racing people,
off his animal, and, in consequence,
big entire kennel has been barred from
further coursing. The manag.-rs of In
gleside have proposed for the public a
square deal, and they will see that it geta
It. The results were as follows:

SHELL MOUND RANGE.
Why the Naval Militia Boys Could
Not Make Good Scores.
There were three riile shooting organi
zations on the Shell Mound range yester
day, and the light and wind being good
and favorable the marksmen enjoyed
themselves. N T o very remarkable scores
were made, although the conditions were
the best for fine work. There was a fair
attendance at the monthly class medal
<tad bulisey* shoot oX the Deutscherj
Krieger Verein. The scores on the first.
German ring target, 20 6hots, stood as
follows: -
Champion class, C. Weggemann, 841 rings;
first class, F. Kaiser, 291; second class J. Ben
del, 291; third class, O. Meyer, 179; best first
shot, O. I'amraer, 21; best last shot, C. Meyer,
21; most bullseyes, George Hetzel.
Bullseye match for cast) prizes, machine
measurementâ First, X. Silberzahn. 1100 points;
second. F. Kaiser, 1106; third, J. Bender. 1413;
fourth, C. Weggemann, 1494; fifth, C. Meyer,
2251.
The members of the Independent Rifles
held their monthly class medal shoot, ten
shots on the Blunt military target. An
nexed are the scores ma
Corporal J. A. Stang, IT; Frank Schnhay, 30;
O. kp'.lontierser, 16: Corporal T. Schonlg, 3T;

monthly medal shoot of the First
and S ;ond divisions of the Naval Militia
brought out but nine shooters, and as a
whole their scores were not up to the
average. There was a most excellent rea
son for poor shooting. The buys were not
in condition, but few of them having had
any Bleep the night before. Among their
former comrades was one named J. V.
Ounrr.ore. formerly of the First Division.
When Uncle Sam called for men to go to
Manila Imnmore was among the first 10
enlist, entering Company B, First Cali
fornia Infantry. In the battle before
Manila this young soldier was among
those who were cut down by Spanish bul
lets. He left a widowed mother, who was
deprived of her main support in the death
of her boy.
Dunmore's old friends of the Naval Mili
tia decided to help the mother of their i
comrade, and on Saturday night a benefit I
was given for her by them. It took place i
in the armory on Page and Gough streets
and proved a success In every particular.
The Naval boys stayed out all night, and
that was the reason they could not shoot
any better. Their scores stood as follows:
M.-Kee, 25; Burns, 36; Lindecker, X; Quinlan.
31; Paris, S3; Bob, 80; Bauer. 29; Harris, 39.
A notice posted yesterday on the Shell
Mound range was to tho effect that the
old San Francisco Fusileers will be re
organized next Thursday evening-. The
organized twenty-seven
years ago, and for many years it has been
in the National Guard, under the name
of Company 1. First Infantry. < aptaln
L. Siebe was among the first captains to
command the boys of the company, and
the late Captain KiohUT, who met his
death In Manila, was the last command- i
EBcer. The late war broke up the (
company, nearly all of the younger mem- j
bers volunteering into the regular army.
The decision to reorganize the National
Guard made the perpetuation of the
Fusileers possibl< . Last Wednesday even-
Ing the membei neflt fund asso
of 'lif FusileerÃ met and took
steps toward putting the company on Its
-a in.
Among thop*Â» who signified their inten
tion of going back into the old body are |
nine of the charter members who i
t the Fusileers Into existence
twenty-seven years ago. They are Cap
. Siebe. John Hause, E. Sohoenfeld,
11 Paulson, P>. BehrenÃ, O. Thierbach, D.
Dunker, William Alt's and John D. Siebe.
A committee consisting of Captain L.
John C. Rineer and Sergeant Cor
coran was appointed to attend to the work
of organization. A meeting will be held
next Thursday evening to receive signa
tures.
WELL SELECTED FIELDS
AT OAKLAND TO-DAY
THORPE AND RTTTTER DOING
FAR THE BEST WORK.
Doss & Co. Lose the Fast Sprinter
Enchanter â Dan Honig Gets In
From St. Louis â Probable
Winners.
The racing game sailed along on an
even keel all last week over at Oakland,
but there Is a noticeable lack of some
thingâenthusiasm â¢ or coin. Nobody
could enthuse over the riding tal
ent. Charley Thorpe of courte Is the
same "grrand old man" of the sad
dle, and Rutter, too, the hustling Chicago
boy, is doirfg: good work. The latter rides
with a dash and vim that might serve as
a good example to the lesser lights. But
these two riders cannot support the bur
den alone, and the advent of "Skeets"
Martin, Turner, Spencer and possibly
Clawson will be welcomed by all. The
â port itself has so far borne a clean and
healthy appearance, and few complaints
have been heard on that score.
Ferguson's starting has been good. If
he will continue in the same notch the
gentleman from Kentucky can look for
110 adverse criticism. Now and then
Thorpe slides down the toboggan with
considerable gusto that does not please
the backers of some of the other starters,
and if Charley would accept an even
break the lion and the lamb would un
doubtedly breakfast together in the
morning.
So far Thorpe and Rutter lead their '
brother jockeys, with considerable to I
spare, as the following table will show:

I have aiso been seen In the saddle, but to no
advantage.
Dan Honig is once more with us. The
astute St. Louis man dropped in from St.
Louis Saturday night, diamonds and all,
but reports a bad season. Dan's friends \
\ are inclined to say this latter habit is
chronic with him, and notwithstanding
which he continues buying vacant sand
lots and quantities of red brick.
Louis Ezf.ll did not bring Paul Kauvar
out with his stable. Instead he filled up
the vacancy with Robert Bonner, a shifty
mud horse.
Doss & Co. are unfortunate. On the way
across the continent Enchanter was taken
sick and was dropped off at Ogden. A
wire received Saturday stated the ani
mal was dead. He was a very fast sprint
er, capable of running six furlongs In 1:13 j
flat, and probably the best horse in the
stable. . ..

At Glen Park.
There was a large attendance at Glen
Park yesterday. The wrestling: match be
tween Joe Gilsen and Ed Wells was won
by the former. The rope walk was made
by Professor Williams, but the ballo6n
ascension did not take place, owing to the
fact that too strong a wind was blowing.
This pretty park has become one of the
standard attractions of the city.
Do not forget that the nation
expects California to stand with
the President and to elect a Re
publican to the United States
Senate.
THE SAJZ FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1898.
FATHER YORKE
SAYS GOOD-BY
TO HIS FLOCK
Pathetic Leave-Tak
ing at the Cathedral.
TEARS FOR THOSE HE LOVES
HE ASKS ALL PRESENT TO PBAY
IN HIS BEHALF.
Reviews His Career as a Priest of
St. Mary's Cathedral â The
Time of His De
parture.
At the 8 o'clock mass in St. Mary's
Cathedral yesterday morning Father
Yorke took leave of the parishioners who
attended the last mass to be said by him
In public In this city, probably for a year
and possibly for many years to come, i
Although it was not previously announced j
that he would bid his people and friendd
good-by the church was crowded.
In taking leave of those whom he loved
and those who loved him, the eloquent
and fearless orator, who stood time after
time up the rostrum or in the pulpit
to guide, warn and lead his people by
good and sturdy advice to victory, for
once lost the power of self-control and
broke down and wept before the faithful
Catholics whom he has taught and scold
ed, but always loved.
Immediately after the last gospel Father
Yorke announced his intention of setting
aside the usual short sermon that he
might avail himself of the opportunity to
say good-by before his departure abroad.
His address included a review of his
career in the priesthood. He endeavored
m carry those present who knew him
when he first came to this coast, back
over a period of twelve years to the time
when he first appeared at Old St. Mary's
Cathedra] as an ordained priest of the
Catholic church.
In reviewing his life he touched upon
a tie of friendship and love that end<-d In
a burst of pathos and emotion which
those who attended this last mass of
Father Yorke will long remember.
He, as he said, was about to go abroad
for his health which Is undoubtedly fail
ing. When he will return he did not say;
but asked those present to pray for him.
The exact date of departure is not defi
nitely known, but it is expected that he
will leave about the middle of the present
week.
It is rumored that on his way East he
will deliver a lecture at Los Angeles.
ELECTION SIGNALS.
Watch for election return
signals from the dome of The
Call building. The signal
code will be published to
morrow morning.
BODY ON THE BEACH.
Too Many Cases at the l_orgue for
the Officials to Attend To.
The body of an unknown man was
found on the Ocean boulevard about a
mile below the Cliff â  House yesterday
morning by John C. Talbot and J. C. Tal
bot, brothers, residing at Â£17 Eddy street.
Deputy Coroner Tyrrell removed the body
to the Morgue.
Deceased was about 40 years of age and
was about 5 feet 8 inches in height. He
had black hair, dark mustache and was
dressed in a black diagonal suit, soft
shirt, black necktie and gaiter shoes, liy
his side was found an empty flask and in
his pocket an empty purse.
Three cases for the Morgue were dis
covered about the same time. Coroner
\V. J. Hawkin's deputies had but one
wagon, and could not handle all the cases
at once. An effort was made to manufac
ture political capital out of the matter,
interested persons claiming the deputies
were doing politics instead of attending to
their duties. At the time Deputy Tyrrell
was at the beach, and Deputy Joseph Mc-
Curmick had to secure outside wagons to
handle the two cases downtown.
Captain Freese a Surprise.
The headway made by Captain
Freese for Public Administrator in
forging to the front within the last
week has been the surprise and ad-
miration of his friends. Every Inde
pendent voter speaks of putting Freese
lon his ballot. Fretse's election means
I that a first-class man need not truckle
jto a boss. Freese is no man's man.
HOSPITAL SUNDAY.
Many Collections Made Yesterday to
Aid in Establishing l"ree Beds
in Hospitals.
In commemoration of All Souls' day,
November 2, and In accordance with a
custom prevailing in many Eastern and
European cities, a collection was taken
up In the Protestant churches yesterday
in aid of the Saturday and Sunday Hos
pital Association, organized last year for
the purpose of providing free beds in such
of the city's hospitals as might become
members.
Collections will be made this year about
Thanksgiving time, in addition to which
the association will receive not only the
collections made yesterday in the Protes
tant churches but the collections .tiade
day before yr-sterday (Hospital Saturday)
in the Jewish synagogues. The receipts
from these various sources bid fair to < n
able the association to greatly enlarge its
field of usefulness.
"He has done good work as Assessor
and deserves re-election," said the Ex
aminer, editorially, four years ago of
John D. Siebe. His record the past four
years surpasses that of his former term.
He is the best Assessor the city ever
had. Vote for him. Voting number 11.

RAILROAD MEN NOT
SLAVES AND HIRELINGS
Oakland's Sons of Toil as Intelligent as the
Man Who Belittled Them on the
Platform.
Judge Magnire Recommends That Nearly All the
Republican Connty Ticket Be Elected in
Alamedaâ All Are Tried and
True.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Nov. 6.
Oakland is a railroad town, but not,
therefore, a corral of slaves. This re
mark is suggested by Judge Maguire's
speech in this city last Thursday night,
wherein he referred to the "coercion" of
railroad employes, leaving the impres
sion that they are like a herd of ani
mals, driven to and fro by the leash
of any manipulator who orders them to
vote according to the commands of
their employer. These remarks have
aroused much indignation among the
hundreds, aye, thousands, of honorable
men employed in this county by the
railroad company. That it is absolutely
false is proved by the fact that on nu
merous occasions candidates for office
known to be violently opposed to rail
road dominance and influence have
been elected by large majorities over
candidates known to be more favorable
to the corporation. Even at the last
Republican primary Henry P. Dalton,
whom no one will accuse of being in
favor of railroad influence in politics,
brought in a solid delegation from the
First Ward, which his own organ al
ways refers to as a railroad strong
hold.
Mr. Maguire did not properly gauge
the temperament of the men he thus
maligned as slaves and hirelings.
Everybody doing business in this city
knows that the railroad men are the
very best customers they can have.
Merchants are confident that twenty
four hours after the pay car passes
through the city they will receive their
bills, and it is common talk that it is
easier to collect from railroad employes
than any other single body of men in
this county. Without the thousands of
dollars spent weekly in Oakland by the ;
railroad company many of her business
houses would be crippled. At the pres
ent time the railroad company has
more men employed than at any period
fur the past ten years. All summer an
army of men were engaged building the
new Harrison-street bridge, the ap
proaches to it and laying tracks up
AVebster street; at the mole another
army of men is now engaged widening
the depot, laying extra tracks for the
twenty-minute ferry service soon to go
into effect, and in building bulkheads
for the reclamation of the water front.
For any one to characterize these men
as slaves who can be corraled at the
crack of a whip held by a railroad boss,
is infamous and no one knows its abso
lute untruthfulness better than Mr.
Maguire. These men are certainly no
less intelligent than their critic, and it
Is not to be supposed that votes for the
fusion candidate were made by such
deliberate Insults.
Evidently after referring to the op
â ;on and coercion of corporations
Mr. Maguire realized his great mistake,
for he adroitly completed his circular
argument by taking it all back. He
wound up this period by saying that
the railroad boss could not go into the
ballot box with his honest employe
and therefore said employe could, after
all, do exactly as he pleased with his
red rubber stamp. This species of non
sense characterized Mr. Maguire's
speech throughout.
Neither are honest Oakland voters to
be entrapped by Mr. Maguire's so
phistical allusion to the single tax. At
the outset he stated that it was un
doubtedly the coming panacea for
every social and economic ailment from
which this nation is now suffering. A
little later he admitted that the single
tax was yet in its "primitive and edu
cational stage" and was very little
understood. Still later he said that
the Governor of the State of Cali
fornia would have no power whatever
to inaugurate the single-tax system,
and he took great pleasure to explain
that his pet idea is 30 thoroughly op
posed to the spirit of the constitution
of this State that such a movement
could only begin by an amendment to
that constitution. In other words, Mr.
-Maguire stated that the single tax is
a grand invention, but that he is will
ing to throw all kinds of mud at it if
by doing so he can gather in a few
votes. For using many words and
landing at the same place he started,
the Judge's speech was only a little
less inferior to that of J. Aubrey Jones.
Incidentally Mr. Magnire supplied
the Republican county candidates with
the best argument they could possibly
have. "The State of California has
spent a good deal of money and
twenty-three years of time," said Mr.
Maguire, "in educating me to be a
statesman. Now I do not see what
good argument can be advanced why
It shouiu cast aside a tried and true man
and take up an apprentice." If this
argument be good for Mr. Maguire,
it is certainly good for his followers.
In this campaign there are many tried
and true county officials seeking re
election. Some of them have served
the county faithfully and honestly for
half a dozen years and are still enjoy
ing the confidence of their employers.
Perhaps Bur. Maguire is right, and it is
to be hoped that his scattering of fol
lowers In this county will take his ad
vice â to some extent. So good reason
can be advanced why County Clerk
Jordan should not be trusted with an
other term. Without flattery, it can
truthfully be said that no other County
Clerk in the history of Alameda has
ever done such economical, faithful
and thorough work in his department
as the ~ounty Clerk. His bitterest po
litical enemies acknowledge the merit
of this statement. Jordan had a little
opposition in his own party. It is,
however, a fact that such opposition
emanated from a source that is calcu
li t d to help his election rather than
to hinder it. Many of the issues upon
which Mr. Jordan made his last cam
paign are deader than Dead Sea ap
ples, and there is a general desire to
squelch any one who revives them. He
now stands out as a "tried and true"
official, and Mr. Maguire has said that
he should be re-elected.
The same Is true of Tax Collector
Barber. Mr. Barber has been in the
Tax Collector's office for six years, and
although some departments of the
county government have not been
what they should be, Mr. Barber's of
fice ha* always been above criticism.
He has done his whole duty, and ac
cording to Mr. Maguire should be re
elected.
County Recorder Spear has served
the public either as an official of the
town of Berkeley or of Alameda Coun
ty for many years, and the Recorder's
office has never been brought into ques
tion. It has been conducted with uni
form system, and the records of this
county are in perfect condition, easily
accessible and accurately kept.
According to Mr. Maguire, Recorder
Spear should be re-elected.
Year after year Judge Allen has been
returned by this city to the Justice's
bench, showing plainly that his em
ployers have confidence in his in
tegrity and ability. The Judge has
never found it necessary to explain to
grand juries or other critics any of his
conduct, and according to Mr. Ma
guire's doctrine should be elected Dis
trict Attorney of fhis county.
Cal Ewing has been four years chief
deputy in the County Clerk's office, and
it is but right to accord to him a fair i
measure of the praise due to the mag
nificent administration of that depart
ment. Mr. Ewing has been always at
his post, always courteous and oblig- i
Ing, was never troubled by those who j
wished to do business in his office, J
ever deeming it a pleasure to oblige j
everybody. The confidence of the Re- i
publican party in his ability to hold \
office was demonstrated at San Leandro
when he was nominated for County Au
ditor. He has proved that he can be j
faithful to his duties and Mr. Maguire !
recommends that he be elected.
If ever Mr. Maguire said anything
that would apply absolutely with truth
to a man this remark of his applies to
Supervisor Talcott. One of the farces
of this campaign has been the attempt
to belittle Mr. Talcott by his jealous
Democratic opponents. Even the Su
porior bench has gone out of its way
to compliment Mr. Talcott on his in
tegrity and businesslike principles, and
his splendid road and bridge work are
everlasting monuments to his fitness
for office. Mr. Maguire recommends
his re-election.
The Grand Jury that sat nearly a
year, and certainly took plenty of time
to inquire into everything wherein
they thought existed the least taint of j
crookedness, paid Supervisor Church a |
high compliment for the manner in |
which, as chairman of the hospital com- I
mittee, he has conducted the County
Infirmary. While it is well known that
many were interested in trying to be
smirch Mr. Church's record in the hope
of electing a Democrat the Grand Jury,
to its credit be it said, could not avoid
telling the truth, and their opinion of
the infirmary has been generously sup
ported by the leading physicians of thi?
county, irrespective of school. Mr.
Church's re-election is therefore recom
mended by Mr. Maguire.
Assessor Dalton has been in office six
years, two as a Councilman and four as
County Assessor. He has persistently
done everything that has a tendency to
increase public confidence in his career
and therefore should be re-elected.
Arthur Feidler. whom the Republi
; cans have nominated for Treasurer, has
frequently served the people of his
township in official capacity, and has
always enjoyed their confidence; Georgre
L. Nusbaumer, the County Surveyor,
has been "tried and true" for many
years, and his grades have never been
questioned or his bills criticized; Oscar
Rogers has so thoroughly earned the
esteem of the people of Alameda that
ho has been returned as City Marshal
term after term, and there is no doubt
that his career as Sheriff will be as
far above reproach as that of chief of
the police force of Alameda. All of
these men have been "tried and true,"
and the good advice of Mr. Maguire
should be followed in regard to each of
them.
While it canno-t be said that Mr.
j Hawes, whom the Republicans nomi
| nated for Public Administrator; Mr.
i "Waterman, for Superintendent of
j Schools, and Dr. Mehrmann for Coro
â¢ ncr, have been "tried and true" in the
j sense in which Mr. Maguire spoke, they
i are known as honorable citizens and
I grood Republicans, worthy of public
support, irrespective of party.
STUART "W. BOOTH.
LYNN IS BACK.
Says Hs Does Not Recollect His A 1A 1
tempt to Murder His Wife.
OAKLAND, Nov. 6.â John W. T,ynn,
who eight months ngo shot his wife
five times because she refused to live
with him any longer, was to-ni^ht
brought down from the Insane Asylum
at Ukiah by Deputy Sheriffs Ed White
and Orin P;ige, and is now at the City
Prison awaiting- his preliminary examin
ation on a charge of assault to murder.
It was while the preliminary examination
was in progress about seven months ago
that Lynn manifested the most violent
form of mental derangement. His reason
has now been fully restored, and to the
officers who brought him down to-night
he stated, "My conscience is clear and I
am perfectly ready to stand trial, for I
have no recollection whatever of having
tried to murder my wife." He did not
even recognize Deputy White whÂ»n he
and Page took charge of him to-day, al
though White accompanied the prisoner
to T'kiah originally. In appearance Lynn
has greatly changed. He is not as stout,
his face is ashen white, but his eyes have
a clear ami calm expression now. and his
general demeanor is that of a quiet, re
served man.
At the asylum he was considered a
great favorite, and at the special request
of the asylum authorities the prisoner's
wrists were not burdened with handcuffs.
Much doubt is expressed as to the prob
ability of I^ynn being held to answer be
fore the Superior Court. His preliminary
examination will no doubt be set for an
early date, but his wife, whose recovery
was marvelous, ana who is the. principal
witness for the people, has since left the
State and cannot now be located.
SEVERED- HER WINDPIPE.
Most Determined Attempt at Suicide
of a Castro Valley Woman.
OAKLAND, Nov. 6.â Mrs. Rodrigues,
aged 35 years, residing with her family
of six children on a ranch in Castro Val
ley, made a most determined attempt to
commit suicide a few nights ago. For
some time past she has been despondent
and worried, and has several times threat
ened that she would end all her sufferings
suddenly.
She arose at midnight and secured her
husband's razor, but before she had an
opportunity of cutting her throat the
razor was taken frea kÂ«r. Later at 3
THE SAN FKASTCISCO .CALL, MONDAY; NOVEMBER T, 1898.
o'clock In the morning she again arose,
claiming that she coula not sleep and that
she intended building a fire. Mr. Rod
rigues, however, also arose, and went out
to the barn to hide his razor, fearing that
she was once more seeking the weapon.
When he returned to the kitchen he waa
horrified to find his wife lying prostrate
across the wood pile with blood gurgling
from her throat and a huge knife by her
side.
Dr. Reynolds was promptly summoned
and attended her. It was found that Mrs.
Rodrigues had severed her windpope but
missed the veins. The wound required
several stitches, and although the would
be suicide is still very weak, there la a
chance for her recovery.

HAM IBERG
WAS AGAIN
THE STAR
His Pitching Caused a,
Shut-Out.
JIM M'DONALD UMPIRED
THE FRISCOS PLAYED POORLY
AT BAT AND ON BASES.
Stockton Won an Easy GamÂ© From
Watsonville and Sacramento
Beat the Santa Cruz
Team.
By Joe Corbett.
Ham Iberg was again In evidence. This
time it was with a vengeance, and no mis
take. Yesterday, at Recreation Park, be
fore a crowd of 4000 fans, he deliberately
shut out the Athletics and did not offer
the semblance of an apology. "Ham" is
truly a wonder, and it is a pity he has
never been given an opportunity to dis
play his prowess in a more moneyedlike
atmosphere. Yesterday he was, as usual,
invincible. To him is due the brunt of
glory which generally follows in the wake
of the victors, for the Athletics, strong as
they are at bat, found him but for three
measly base hits and not a run. It was he
who threw the "foghorn" and his co
horts down, as it were, and it was his
great pitching which made the game so
interesting and covered up, but not en
tirely, the stupid battery and base run
ning of his colleagues. Had they played
any kind of an up-to-date game the score
would have been about 7 to 0, yet I sup
pose there is no use of complaining. in
view of the close score. However, the
Friscos would do well to practice up a
bit on that long lost art of base running.
Just a little of it, with an opportune hit,
! would surely be appreciated.
The Athletics fought nobly yet useless
ly. Iberg was in excellent form, and
when this gentleman finds himself in such
a mode it fs a rather difficult proposition
for any team to solve him correctly. The
Athletics could not do so yesterday, -et
played beautiful ball, Meeney in particu
lar distinguishing himself. There was
plenty of enthusiasm and many good
plays, all of which had a tendency to
make the afternoon an agreeable one.
Then, again, Jim McDonald, one of the
ablest umpires of the National League,
called the balls and strikes, and Informed
base runners that they were safe and out,
which fact in itself was a big attraction.
Jim was accorded a most handsome re
ception, and bowed his acknowledgments
again and again. He is certainly a most
popular fellow.

at Fort Baker.
LADIES AND THEIR GUESTS
THEIR PRESENCE AN ACCIDENT
SAY THE OFFICERS.
The Boat Sailed for the City Too
Soon and the Ladies Became
Campers for the
Night
There is trouble In Battery B of the
California Heavy Artillery, now stationed
at Fort Baker. That is to say the rela
tions existing between the enlisted men
and the commissioned officers are for the
present somewhat strained. Not that
officers and men do not salute as they
pass by, but there Is that little something
in the atmosphere at Fort Baker just
now which suggests future developments
of a more or less Interesting nature.
There have come recently to depart
ment headquarters rumors from Fort
Baker concerning the conduct of the com
missioned officers of Battery B. and there
can be no doubt but that these rumors
were first started by the enlisted men of
the battery. How much truth there is
fn these sub rosa charges of the enlisted
men remains to be seen, for certain it is
at present that the officers indignantly
deny them. The commissioned officers
now stationed at Fort Baker in command
of the battery are Captain Herbert Choyn
skl. First Lieutenant Sprague and Sec
ond Lieutenant Huie. The present cloud
of scandal that rests over the battery un
doubtedly has Its origin some time back,
and there is equally little doubt concern-
Ing the fact that it has sprung from the
kick of the volunteer, who, incited by
more or less animus, has kept the ball
rolling until there Is now every prospect
of General Merriam making a formal In
vestigation of the entire matter.
The enlisted men of the battery charge
that the officers of the battery have been
guilty of conduct unbecoming officers and
gentlemen, and to prove what they state
they declare that on Thursday of last
week the officers of the battery enter
tained several women of questionable
character at the camp, and that these
women remained in camp all night. This
Is the most serious charge that the sol
diers bring against the men who com
mand them. Again it is stated that Sec
qjra Lieutenant Huie, the canteen officer,
Is behind in his accounts, and that there
are at present outstanding bills against
tho canteen for the month of September,
which as yet have not been paid, al
though they should have been liquidated
over a month ago.
These are the rumors that constant cir
culation on the part of the men have
made so public as to bring them into no
tice, and in consequence General Merriam
may this week take up the matter offi
cially. The kick 3of the men regarding
the kind of food and the treatment they
get is not worthy of notice, for an inves
tigation of the matter reveals the fact
that the men of the battery are as well
fed and cared for as any command now
In the service. Their camp Is a model one
In appearance and cleanliness, and their
food is wholesome and sufficient.
Regarding the more sensational details
of army life at Fort Baker there is much
that has to be passed by. One of the
sergeants of the battery stated that on
Thursday last several women, who he
had heard were actresses, came In the
afternoon to visit the officers. They re
mained until quite dark and left for Sau
silito in time to catch the last boat back
SHOT TO DEATH
BY HER LOVER
Mrs. Louisa Parker, a Saloon Waitress,
Murdered by Tomasso Kellini.
MRS. LOUISA PARKER, a dive wait
ress, known In Barbary Coast dance
halls as Mrs. Spain, was shot and
Instantly kllle 1 yesterday by To
masso KelllnL Ti > murder occurred In
the grocery and saloon at 117 Second
street, kept by John Sanders. Jealousy
wu the murderer's motive.
About 12 o'clock the victim, accom
panied by George Spreen, her former lov
er, entered the store and going behind a
pile of soap boxes, which serve as a par
tition, drank a glass of beer. Kellinl fol
lowed them Into the place a few mo
ments later. Going to the bar he took a
drink and then Joined the other two be
hind the boxes. Kelllnl ordered another
round of beer, and when the proprietor
had served them and was making change
three pistol shots were heard. Spreen, the
only eye witness to the tragedy, ran out
ft)** slda door and down Minna street
to the city. They returned to camp later
and Bald that they had missed the boat
and were unable to get to San Francisco
that night. These women, the f olcue \
said, remained in camp at Fort Baker all
night. The man, when asked It trie
women were under the influence of liquor
or if they made things at all merry, re
plied that he could not vouch iÂ° T \â¢Â±
part of the rumor, but that all he knew
was that the women had been Quartered
for the night in some of the tents In tne
officers row, and that they had returned
to San Francisco the first thing the next
captain Choynskt when seen by a rep
resentative iof The Call in regard to the
rumors discussed the matter very trankl> .
but at the same time said that he did not
see that he had to give an account, of any
thing that occurred at Fort Baker to any
one but his superior officer, and that when
an explanation of affairs was wanted and
was called for in the proper way by the
proper person that it would be Immedi
ately forthcoming. Regarding the women
in camp Captain Choynski admitted that
three women and one man had been quar
tered in the headquarters tent ;on last
Thursday night, but he said he did not
know who they were, and he most empha
tically stated that he had seen nothing
in their conduct -to indicate * that they
were improper â¢ persons Captain Choyn
kis version of the incident given in the
presence of Lieutenant Sprague Is sub-
Bt nt retu y me S d ?o oFort0 Fort Baker rather Yata
on Thursday afternoon and found a man
and three apparently young girls in camp. >
Ostensibly they had i come to see one of
the sergeants. They remained until it
was time for. them to return on the Mc-
Dowell and went to the wharf to take the
steamer. They missed it and came back.
The teamster, who cares for the niules
that haul the ambulance, had turned the
animals out, so there was no way for the
party to get back. Sausalito is but two
miles off. It was then suggested by some
one that they - remain all night If they
were willing to put up with such accom
modations as Wk could give them in camp.
This was done and the ladies remained all
night in the headquarters tent. We loan
ed them some blankets and these they
spread on the floor. There is a â  sentinel
kept on the beat the entire night in front
of this tent, and that night he was walk
ing up and down in front of It all the
time. I do not know the people, but I will
state that 1 saw nothing out of the way
in their conduct and I did not hear them
make any sordid remarks." , .
Lieutenant Sprague confirms the fact
that the party remained in camp all
night. He met the women, but said he
could not recall their names. The name
of the man who accompanied the women
Captain Choyinskl would not reveal, j
Lieutenant Sprague. said that after sup- i
per they went down to the beach ana
built a fire and watched the tide come
in Captain Choyinskl declares that the
matter has been falsely exaggerated by
the enlisted men because some of them
have It in for him because he has been
strict with them and maintained discip
line. He cited the fact that in one month
there had been in the battery ninety
three summary court cases, and that all
of the cases had pleaded guilty. He also
said that he had been forced In some
Instances to reduce non-commissioned
officers to the ranks because they were
either insubordinate or incompetent.
Captain Choyinski stated that without
meaning to cast any reflection on his pre
decessor. Captain Hay, he had been such
a good-natured fellow and had been so
lax In discipline that when he (Captain
Choyinskl) had assumed command he had
a hard time of it to make the men un
derstand what discipline meant. These
facts were cited by Captain Choyinski to
show that the exaggerated reports of
affairs at Fort Baker were due to per
sonal animus and spite. He also pointed
to the fact that many of the men in the
battery who had given the most trouble
were not fit to be soldiers. -
When asked concerning the reported
shortage of Lieutenant Huie, the can
teen officer, Captain Choyinski stated
that there was. so far as he knew, noth
ing In the report. He said he had re
quested a statement from the bookkeeper
of the canteen, and that Lieutenant Huie
was aware that he had requested this
statement of the canteen financial af
fairs. Captain Choyinskl said the state
ment would be ready to-day. One of the
non-commissioned officers connected with
the canteen declares that some of the
bills for September have not yet been
paid by Lieutenant Huie. He says that
no statement has been rendered since the
canteen was started, which was on June
13. and that the hospital corps now sta
tioned at Fort Baker has never received
its share of the canteen's funds which
it is justly entitled to. One of the med
ical officers inquired Into the matter in
order to see that the hospital corps
should get its just proportion of funds,
and when he asked for the books he was
informed by the non-commissioned officer
that they were In the posssession of Lieu
tenant Huie. This non-commissioned
officer declares that he is entitled to see
the books, but that he has never been al
lowed to do so.

front door, up Minna to Third and thence
to Mission. lie ran Into a saloon on the
corner of Mission and Third and was ar
rested there by Officer Barn Royston. He
attempted to hide the weapon with which
he had killed the woman, but It was soon

On the way to prison Kellinl admitted
that he killed the woman because he loved
her and she Intended to leave him and go
back to Spreen.
The murderer is an Italian, 28 years old,
and has been employed by Valente, the
baker. The dead woman had lived In the
city several years, during all of which
time Bhe had been a waitress In saloons.

LAPHMAN'S STRANGE STORY
MAKES A STARTLING DISCOV
ERY AT HABBOB VIEW.
Finds a Stranger In the Throes of
Death Apparently a Victim of
an Assassin â Supposed
Victim Disappears.
Edward Laphman, living at 520 Golden
Gate avenue, last evening reported to the
police that while riding horseback In the
vicinity of Harbor View baths he saw a
man lying In the brush, apparently dying.
He approached him, and from his ap
pearance he concluded that the man had
been foully assaulted.
The man's face was covered with blood
and a deep wound in his head indicated
that he was the victim of foul play. Cap
tain Bohen Immediately dispatched De
tective Egan to the scene, with instruc
tions to make a thorough investigation.
Accompanied by Laphman the detective
visited the spot, but was unable to find
a trace of the supposed murdered man.
There was a pool of blood where the man
lay, but further than that there was
nothing to show that a murder had been
committed. Detective Egan visited a
number of saloons in the vicinity, but
failed to find a clew which would tend to
solve the mystery.
Laphman is positive he Â«aw the man
lying on his back in the throes of death.
He even claims that the appearance in
dicated that he had been assaulted and
perhaps murdered.
Captain Bohen Instructed Egan to con
tinue his investigation and if possible
learn the name of the supposed victim.

With solemn and Impressive ceremony

ministered to a class of twenty-eight
children, boys and girls, at St. Anthony's
church on Army street yesterday after

robed in pure white with veils of the same
material extending over and covering
their faces. Following them came the
boys, dressed In black and wearing the
usual and customary ribbon of purity on
the right arm. St. Joseph's sodality, con
sisting entirely of adults, followed. At
the extreme end was the Archbishop
robed in the sacred vestments of the altar,
assisted by acolytes and representative
priests from various orders.
At the conclusion of the rendition of the
opening .hymn by the choir, the Arch
bishop oriefly outlined the importance and
the meaning of the sacrament about to
be administered. He maintained that It is
a duty of parents to assist their children
in every way to form and maintain the
highest ideals of piety and virtue.
fn honor of the event the altars and
sanctuary of the church were prettily
decorated and adorned with flowers and
evergreens. On the surrounding walls of
the church were hung at intervals
wreaths of palm. During the ceremony
Father Rafael, the pastor of the church,
conducted the choir and rendered the or
gan accompaniment.

An Honest, Upright Judge,
The career of Hon. James M. Seawell
since his elevation to the Superior bench
six years ago has been one character
ized by ability and Integrity of a rare
type. He has earned the reputation of
being an upright, honest Judge, and his
record both as a lawyer and JurlÃt are
such as to make his candidacy appeal
strongly to all voters who are desirous
of maintaining the high standard now en-
Joyed by the Superior Court of San Fran
cisco.
Judge Seawell has been a resident of
this city since 1861. He Is In the prime of
life, being 62 years of age, and is just at
that period when long experience has so
ripened judgment that he is Qualified to
Berve in a judicial capacity with distin
guished ability.
His candidacy is most favorably re
garded by a majority of voters, irrespec
tive of party, while among the members
of the bar there Is practically a unani
mous desire to see Judge Seawell re
turned to the position he has so ably
filled the past six years. â¢
An honest judiciary is essential
! to the protection of the property
and the rights of citizens, there
fore the people should vote for
Davis Louderback, John Carson,
; James M. Troutt and Henry N.
j Clement as Judges of the Su
perior Court.
Clark Hakes Denial.
M. B. Clark denies the statement made
| by Charles Hyer, a Democratic candidate
for Supervisor on the Oakland ticket, that
j he (Clark) ever served a sentence in the
â  Alameda County Jail or any other Jail.
In a statement made by Hyer of certain
frauds on the Government, he sought to
: lay the blame for his trouble on Clark's
| shoulders. Clark Is well connected and
well employed in this city, and though he
, acknowledges having at one time been in
â¢ Hyer*s employ, denies emphatically that
he was In Jail.
A demagogue in the Assessor's office
