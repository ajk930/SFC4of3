PHELAN MAKES A MOST ABJECT PLEA FOR MERCY
BETRAYAL
HIS LAST
RESOURCE
THE "HEFTING" MAYOR FINDING HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH DEFEAT TRIES TO
AVERT DISASTER BY LICKING THE FEET OF THE MEN HE HAS CALLED RASCALS
Friday morning Governor
James H. Sudd, M. F.
Tarpey and others, rep
resenting Mayor James D.
Pheian, paid a. forma/ visit to
Major P. J. Harney at his resi
dence in the Western Addition
and there proposed that if the
Harney- Rainey Democrats would
assist in the election of Pheian
they would be rewarded by be
ing given one-third of the pat
ronage at the City Hall, and
would besides be given absolute
control of the Committee of One
Hundred. The Harney-Rainey
Democrats are those to whom
Pheian has often referred to as
thieves, scoundrels and black
guards. The Mayor's offer to
turn over the party organization
and a-big portion of the spoils
of dffice was received and
"placed on fife."
The Call has insisted from the be
ginning that Mr. Pheian is not the dis
interested purist which he has pro
resoej m be, but that he was simply
sordid in his ambitions and sought to
satisfy them regardless of fair play or
good faith in his party or with the pub
lic. His place in politics and in the pub
lic eye, and to a degree in the public
confidence, has been won by an appar
ent battle with what he has often de
scribed as the corrupt element in his
own party. This attitude has secured
for him standing in the community
and a degree of confidence from busi
ness men whose interests require a
right administration of public affairs.
As Mayor he has been a slothful offi
cer, mindful of the spectacular oppor
tunities of his office, but wretchedly
neglectful of its administration, which
requires application and industry. His
prestige suffered by his attempt to
oust Supervisors whom he had selected
for nomination, and his gross negli
gence, by which the latest dishonesty
in the city treasury developed in the
presence of opportunity, resulting in
the looting of the deposits in his
charge. To win back the ground he
had lost, Mr. Phelan put his lance in
tilt and rode against what he called the
corrupt forces in his own party. Ke
publicly despaired of an honest pri
mary, because Harney and Rainey
would run it, and in the dust which he
succeeded in raising he built up the i
Committee of One Hundred and en- I
dowed it with all the authority of party i
organization. He put it in motion as a I
county convention to make a delegation
to the State convention, and appeared i
in the latter body to plead that it be
seated, by painting a black picture of
Harney, his general committee, his
delegation elected at an open primary,
and his intentionsâ if he got the small
est fraction of public patronage. Seat
ing his non-elected delegation by a
promise that his Committee of One
Hundred would call a primary for a
city convention, he returned to San
Francisco, procured of that committee
a refusal to call a primary, and induced
it to organize itself into a city conven
tion for the nomination of a municipal
ticket, of which he is the head.
For a time these acts and professions
of Phelan were taken in good faith by
the people and procured for him much
public sympathy and support. Repub
licans were impressed by his apparent
sincerity and were inclined to support
him. Then came his anarchistic out
break against the State Supreme Court,
which was so brutal, reckless and at
war with every American sentiment
toward the Judicial safeguards of life
and property that his Republican sup
port fell away more rapidly than it had
been built up. All up and down the
streets where our wholesale business is
done and all up and down the streets
where San Francisco retail trade is lo
cated and in shops and ship yards the
attack upon the courts was discussed
ai <1 Phelan was repudiated.
Now Phelan'a ambition is a case of
"intellectual sciatica." and is delicately
sensitive to the draughts. He f. It
keenly the less cordial hail of men who
had recently been warmly familiar. He
Mt the averted face and the absence
of repetition of assurances of confidence
and support, and his sciatic ambition
twinged and ached under the change in
the political wind and weather. He
found it impossible to regain the Re
publican and even the Non-Partis>in
strength he had lost by invoking popu
lar vengeance upon the courts and by
a m-:>st ignorant statement of thÂ« duty
of the bench in interpreting statutes,
and in the agonies of hia suffering am
bition turned for support to the men
and the elements he had denounced
and spat upon. On Friday night he

and his morning organ arranged for
and procured a conference with Major
Harney and the representatives of Mr.
Rainey. Phelan begged the support of
the elements he had denounced in every
speech, that he drove out of the Sacra
mento convention, bruised by his in
vective and outlawed of all parties by
his vicious ascriptions of crime against
the suffrage. In that conference he and
his organ begged that the Harney gen
eral committee be called together; that
it indorse the Phelan ticket and pledge
to that ticket its support; that it re
solve for party harmony, and give the
votes of its followers to the Mayor and
his self-nominated candidates. In re
turn for this Phelan pledged himself to
give the Harney committee one-third
of the city patronage and to have the
Committee of One Hundred dissolved
GOOD GOVERNMENT
LEAGUE CONFIDENT
Assured of Victory in
Santa Clara.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 29.â Next week will
witness the hottest political campaign
ever conducted in Santa Clara County.
On the outcome depends to a great ex
tent the future prosperity of this city
and county. The struggle will be be
tween the union of reform forces and
the Rea gang. The former is composed
of the Republican Good Government
League, Democrats, Populists and Sil
ver Republicans. Opposed to them are
the gangsters, who, under Rea and
Mackenzie, have been in office and fed
at the public crib for years.
While this ring has been in power
property in the city and county has de
preciated in value and taxes steadily
increased. Intending settlers have been
driven away and business suffered se
verely. Not alone this, but the public
school system has been Injured. The
strike in the High School will serve as
an example, 200 pupils rebelling against
boss rule. The school department in all
respects has suffered. Efficient and
capable teachers have been dismissed

ATTEMPTS TO
BUY THE VOTES
OF DEMOCRATS
after the election, willingly if possible,
and if not probably by act of the State
committee, the Harney general commit
tee to immediately take its place as the
regular and authorized organization of
the party.
To effect this it is agreed that the
Harney general committee shall be
called together next Tuesday to give
its formal adhesion to the Phelan ticket
and to pledge to it the Rainey contin
gent of votes which it controls. To give
this conference with Major Harney an
air of authority and good faith Phelan
procured the presence and assistance
of Governor Budd, whose recent plain
tive appeals for harmony in the party
have been evidence that an astute poli
tician had begun to smell the mold
above the rose of party affairs In this
city. The Mayor and the Governor
and those with political "pulls" given
places. Politics controls the police and
fire departments. In fact, the corrupt
ness of the municipal affairs of San
Jose and Santa Clara County is known
all over the State and is proving a bar
rier to the prosperity and progress of
city and county.
An effort is to be made to change this.
The Good Government League, Demo
crats and Populists have agreed upon
a strong anti-gang ticket and its elec
tion will result in a complete turning
out of the rascals. This union of forces
is more than sufficient to beat Rea's
ticket. The candidates put forward are
of the oldest and best citizens and their
election means a business administra
tion and a new and greater San Jose.
An energetic campaign has been car
ried on through the county for the past
month by the Good Government League
and the Democrats, and both organiza
tions are satisfied that the country dis
tricts will give a large majority against
the gang ticket. This canvass has been
thorough and systematic and over half
of the voters of the county have been
appealed to personally. Commencing
on Monday morning these forces will
begin work on the residents of the city,
besides continuing their labors among
the orchardisid and farmers. Rea de
pends on the city for a large vote to
cut down the majority that will be
rolled up against him in the country.
A house-to-house canvass will be made
and the people shown where a change
will benefit them. There are hundreds
who are in sympathy with the reform
movement and if they dared to would
vote against the gang, but their bread
and butter depend on the latter and
they dare not antagonize Rea. This
class is rapidly deserting the gang since
Rea's conviction of having slandered
Councilman Jarman, and it is believed
that a large number can be educated
in the next week to vote the Good Gov
ernment ticket. Besides meetings in
the outlying towns there will be speak
prevailed as far as Major Harney was
concerned, and it was agreed that an
effort would be made to get the Gen
eral Committee on Tuesday to ratify
the treaty of Friday by which Rainey
is to have one-third of the city patron
age in exchange for enough votes to
make Phelan Mayor.
It is not often that politics furnishes
a newspaper a more reprehensible deal
to expose than this. Mayor Phelan won
his spurs and has worn them by con
stant outcry against the man whose
aid he supplicates in extremity. His
most autocratic and unusual course in
denying the primary was made to seem
reasonable by his picture of the danger
that through a primary the Harney
committee would get power and Rainey
would get public patronage. His morn
ing organ has declared that under Har
ing in the various precincts of the city.
To-night there were lai-gely attended
meetings of the Good Government
League at Palo Alto and New Almaden.
Judge J. R. Lewis and E. A. Hayes ad
dressed the former and L. J. Chipman,
J. N. Days, H. G. Squires and A. T.

SATOLLI NO LONGER
IN FAVOR AT ROME
Does Not Enjoy the High Confidence
of the Sovereign Pon
tiff.
NEW YORK, Oct. 29.â According to the
report of an American priest recently re
turned from Rome, whose sojomm in the
Eternal City was one of association with
the most distinguished ecclesiastics con
nected with the Papal court. Cardinal Sa
tolll no longer enjoys the high confidence
of the sovereign pontiff In which he re<
posed during his term as delegate apos
tolic to the United States, hut. on the
contrary, is distinctly out of favor. While
In this country Satolll was supposed to
represent the more liberal policy of the
Catholic church as exemplified by the
Pope himself and exercised here by Gib
ney and Rainey management an hon
est primary was impossible. Phelan
had even gone so far as to say in a
public speech that there should not be
another Democratic primary in this
city until the Legislature passes a pri
mary election law. He had declared
that all these unusual precautions must
be taken to protect the people against
the Harney Democrats, to prevent the
bosses getting patronage and power, to
preserve unsullied the official adminis
tration of the city and to keep in check
the corporations and monopolies. Hav
ing protested too much to the loss of a
support that made sure his defeat, in
abject despair, in the agony of defeated
ambition, in a misery that poppy nor
mandragora nor any drowsy syrup of
the East could ease, he betrayed every
pledge, sponged out every utterance,
bons, Ireland and Keane, who were his
recognized consulters and advisers.
No one in Rome, says this priest, can
or will divulge the reasons which have
reduced Satolll from the supreme ftwor
that he enjoyed. At first on his return
he wns loud, in his praise of the AmerÂ«
lean priestffood and of American institu
tions, but latterly he Is reported to have
said that no one In America was capable
of doing any service to the church ex
cepting the Germans, especially as pro
fessors in colleges and universities. These
statements of the priest seem to be in a
measure confirmed by sentiments ex
pressed in a letter which Satolll ha 3
written to Rev. Charles Maignen, a memÂ«
ber of the French priesthood, who has re
cently become known as the author of
"Father Hecker: Is He a Saint?"â a vol
ume criticizing Father Elliott's book on
the work and life of the late Fatfcer Isaac
T. Hecker and the foundation of the con
gregation of Paulist Fathers in un
measured terms and denouncing the
type of priest which Father Hecker
represented. In this letter Satolll ex
pressed the wish that the book may ar
rest the progress of the American idea,
already spreading on both sides of the
Atlantic. He says In the letter:
"We hope the good God will a"ssist you
in arresting the most disastrous pest
which has spread its contagion in two
worlds."
HOBSON PROPOSFS TO
FLOAT TWO WRECKS
Says He Can Raise the Cristobal Co
lon and Vizcaya at a Cost of
a Million Dollars.
NEW YORK, Oct. 29.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent says: If $1,
000,000 is placed at his disposal, Naval
Constructor Hobson guarantees to float
! the armored cruisers CristobaJ Colon and
i Vizcaya and dry dock them at either New
i York or Norfolk. Mr. Hobson made this
proposition to-day to the naval board of
construction, and the board took It under
consideration until Monday, when It will

ate cold every profession made and
presented himself, hat in hand, pros
trate before the men by abusing whom
he had built up the gaudy structure of
reform and seated himself on the top!
Men have sacrificed their self-respect
before this far office and power. But
it is a peculiarly contemptible nature
that contents Itself with the externals
of honor and position, gained by bar
ter of all that makes high places pre
cious to a man of honor. Casserly re
signed from the United States Senate
when he was presented with a bill for
votes bought for him by his friends
without his knowledge. He paid the
bribes back, resigned, and with a proud
spirit broken by having worn a tar
nished honor avoided thereafter the
faces of men and lived and died, an
honest man, of wounds to his honor
elusion preparatory to submitting a re
port to the Secretary of the Navy. This
board will consider also the proposition
of the Acme Wrecking Company to float
the Maine, and will report upon it prob-
a Mr. n Hobson told the board he thought
it would cost $500,000 to raise the Colon
and $500,000 to lift the Vizcaya. The job
of floating the latter cruiser would be
more difficult than in the case of the
Colon as it would be necessary to build
a coffer dam around her, pump out tne
water and repair the bottom of the ship
before floating her.
Mr. Hobson stated to the board that
the Vizcaya was a structural wreck, and
it would cost a great deal of money to re
pair her, and this statement also will be
given consideration by the board. Esti
mating a cost of $500,000 to float the ship
and $1,000,000 to repair her, besides the risk
of losing a large amount of money by the
action of a storm, some officials with
whom I talked say it is hardly worth
while to float the Vizcaya.

that no medicine could mend.
Mr. Phelan is not of that fiber. His
honor is no sensitive plant, to shrivel
at a rude touch. It is of a wanton and
bawdy kind, that is not easily shamed.
The people of this city now have thia
peculiar case before them. If Phelan
told the truth about Harney and
Ralney Democracy, no honest citizen
can calmly contemplate their reinvest
ment with power. Phelan has called
them the upas shadow on the city, and
has likened them to everything awful
in the physical world. His lieutenants.
Max Popper, Braunhart and McNab,
have used them as a bogy to frighten
the people. Phelan has drawn his
skirts as they passed, and has stepped
over the spot in the sidewalk poisoned
by their shadows. And now, in" the
rank betrayal of all his professions, ha
sends his emissaries and commission
ers into their camp with not only a
flag of truce, but the protocol of a
treaty of amity, comity and alliance,
by which he agrees to ~fve them tha
public patronage which he has insisted
they cannot have without using it cor
ruptly, and to hereafter put the city
in their control, for the new charter
election of 1900, by knocking his Com
mittee of One Hundred in the head
and turning all party authority over to
the organization he has denounced aa
an aggregate jailbird! "Was it called a
treaty of alliance? It is rather tha
terms of a surrender, with the privilege
of retaining his plug hat, as soldiers
stipulate for their side arms. An am
bition for office which seeks such
means for its gratification is unnatural.
It is a political typhoid, a disease, and
its possessor is no more moved by a
desire for the public welfare than is a
sperm whale actuated by a wish to
perfume the locks of women when ha
overfeeds and produces ambergris by
indigestion.
It remains to be seen whether the
Harney and Rainey Democracy will re
ceive the Mayor's surrender. They
have for months been fugitives from
political Justice. Phelan hooted them
out of Sacramento. He called them
tools of the monopolies, minions of the
corporations, despoilers of the people,
bosses, corruptionists and gangsters;
and then when his chances to get office
by denouncing them seem fading away
he and his morning organ and the or
gan grinder and the grinder's monkey
trudge to the lair of the men he had
denounced as bandits and offered all he
had to give if they would make him
Mayor, let him sit in a high place, let
him be looked at by the populace, let
him enjoy dishonorable honors and be
seen of men for two years more! No
other man ever had such an itch for no
toriety as to give so much for. so little.
No man ever climbed down from such
a height to root in the mud for an of
fice, like a hog for truffles which it is
not allowed to eat. It may be known
later on how far this surrender^ ex
tended, whether it invaded the range
of those official institutions which con
cern the public peace and safety. It ia
safe to say that such a, politician aa
the Mayor would not hesitate to bar
gain for the partisan activity of those
divisions of the city government whose
efficiency wholly depends upon their
keeping aloof from politics. Jnto this
bargaining and trading and laying of
himself on the shambles like a mutto-n
chop he brought outsiders, not voters
in this city. It was characteristic that
he should have Mr. Tarpey from Ala
meda to bear the white flag, as he had
imported a registered voter from Sausa
lito to sit in his Committee of One
Hundred convention and vote for him
for Mayor. Whether he had been tell
ing the truth of the Harney and Rainey
Democracy or whether he has been
traducing them makes no difference
now. Be they black as he painted them
their sins are as white as his shirt front
compared with his offense in playing
a part to get public confidence and then
volunteering to betray it by this abject
surrender.
The city will turn with relief from
the spumy mess Phelan has made and
daubed on himself to a clean and strong
man, who is no pretender, who does not
go around abusing the devil by day and
crawling into bed with him by night.
The Harney Democracy is now put to
the test of its self-respect. Phelan
hissed and pelted it into a corner and
has brought the town daily to look at
and hear him Jeer it. No pug puppy
ever took more pleasure in worrying a
cat than Phelan has in towseling that
wing of his party. Now let us see
which way the cat will Jump.
The duty of the city is plain. It will
repudiate Phelan's ambition and retire
him to that privacy which he will adorn
less as an ex-Mayor than he did as a
private citizen before ambition swelled
his self-conceit so out of proportion to
his merit.
No good-Lord-and-good-Devll candi
date who would excite the envy of Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and make Janus
shut up shop can be elected this year.
His talent for intrigue survives while
he catches at this straw. His promise
of patronage to Rainey is a shadow.
The substance is the offer of control to
the Harney general committee. But
that is a gold brick. The next Legis
lature will pass a primary election law,
which obsoletes all committees in re
auect to primaries.2

Special Dispatch to Tha Coll.
PARIS, Oct. 29.â The Court of Cassa
tion has decided to graiit a revision of
the Dreyfus case, and will institute a
supplementary inquiry. The court,
however, has declined to order the re
lease of Dreyfus.
At the opening of the court to-day
M. Mornaud resumed his argument in
behalf of the Dreyfus family, Insisting j
that the bordereau was not in the j
handwriting of Dreyfus or an imitation â¢
by him of the writing of Major Ester- â¢
hazy. The latter hypothesis, -'counsel !
continued, was absolutely improbable, j
If it was an imitation, the author of it
must be a third party. If it was no im
itation, the author of the bordereau, |
he asserted could only be Major Ester- j
hazy himself. Continuing. M. Mornaud j
pointed out that the honor of the army !
was not involved in the doings of court- |
martials, as, like other courts, they ]
cuuid err without their honor suffering, j
After Mornaud had. closed his argu- }
ment the court retired to deliberate.
M. Yvos Cuyoi. in Siccle to-day, as- i
sens that the secret documents in the!
Dreyfus cage were burned some days
ago. i
The deciskm of the court is as for- |
.lows:
In view of the letter of the Minister of
Justice.' dated September 20. IS9S, in clos- '
ir.Â»r arguments or the public prosecutor
denouncing to the court the condemnation
pronounced l>y the first court-martial
of the military government of Paris
on December 22, 1894, against Alfred Drey
fus, then a captain of artillery attached
to the general staff, in view of all the
documents in the case and also of arti
143 to 4-lfi of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, amendr-d by the law of June
. relative to the admissibility of:
an application in proper form for rede
cision.
Whereas. The matter has. been brought
before the court by the public prosecutor
in virtue of the express order of tae Min
ister ot Justii â Â»â¢;
Whereas, The application comes within
the category of the cases contemplated
in article -i-t:: and has been, introduced .
within the period fixed by article 444;
Whereas, The judgment, a revision of
Which is demanded, has the force of a
chosen Judge;
Whereas, The doctiments produced do
not place the court in a position to decide
all the merits of the case and there is
ground for making a supplemental in
quiry.
For these reasons the' court declares
the application to be in proper form and
legally admissible, and states that it will
institute a supplemental inquiry, and de
clarea there is no ground at the present
moment for deciding on the public pros
ecutor's application for a suspension of
the penalty.
The Judges of the court were occu
pled for three hours and a half in con
sidering the judgment.
The public, whose admission to the
court was regulated with the greatest
care, awaited the decision with marked
calmness. During the" suspension of
business the public crowded into the
lobbies and there was evident anxiety
to hear th.c verdict. There was no dem- ;
onstration when the court arose.
The decision created no public ex
citement and complete tranquillity pre
vails on the streets.
NEW CABINET MAY

announced that M. de Freycinet has

ject to the proviso that the selections
for the remaining Cabinet officers meet
with his approval.
M. Paul Peyerals, Minister of Finance
in the late. Cabinet of M. Brisson, has
declined to accept the colonial portfolio
on the ground of ill health.
The anti-Semite members of the
Chamber of Deputies have issued a
manifesto to the country declaring
' that the Government of the republic
must be divorced from Jewish in
fluences, "which are ruining It and
subjecting France to the yoke of the
Jews."
BRECKINRIDGE THINKS
HE HAS BEEN ILL USED
Says He Was Mustered Out Because
of His Charges of Mismanage
ment at Santiago.
NEW YORK, Oct. 29.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Major General Jos C. Breekinridge has
returned to his office, after having been
ordered mustered out aa corps commander
at Chickamauga. L'nder this order Gen
eral Breekinridge expected to be granted
leave of absence until November 30. In
the meantime he was directed to report
to Washington. I am informed that one
of the firsi things General Breekinridge i
did after arriving here was to call on ths
President, who did not receive him. It I
is conlidently stated that there is an un- !
pleasant friction between the office of in- i
spector general and that of the Secretary
of War. It is urged with much feeling '
by the friends ' of General BreckinridEre :
that the oruer mustering him out of the !
service was an afterthought and In some
1 degree a sort of punishment for his re- '
. port from Santiago setting forth in vig- '
orous fashion the causes of the raisman- :
agoment there. While at Santiago it ap- '
'pears he incurred tne ill will of General i
Shafter because he sent a dispatch ask
ing for more troops. I am Informed that
on this account the commanding general '<
refused to speak to him for Beveral days.
Although tne utterances of General
Brcckinrldge have been entirely official In
thr-ir character ti.jv seem to have been
unsatisfactory to the administration.
General Breekinridge does not seem to ;
understand his present status. He is
simply waiting for orders with seemingly
nothing before him to engage his atten-
Uon. He did say. however, that from !
certain causes there had been no cohe- |
rency possible In the department of the !
inspector general and that connection be- j
tween the inspector general and his Bub- '
. ordinates during the progress of the war:
had been severed by unseen hands.

LONDON, Oct. 29.â The arrival of
Major Marchand at Khartoum, on his
way to Cairo, with the portion of his
report which was not finished when
Captain Baratier left FaÂ«hoda, is re
garded as a rift in the clouds overhang
ing Anglo-French relations, for, in spite
of the semi-official denial issued in
Paris that orders were sent to the
major to go to Cairo, it is fully be
lieved here that the French officer
would not be on his way to Cairo un
less he had received a hint to that ef
fect from the French Government, which
considers that his leaving Fashoda will
take the sting out of the situation, and
at the same time prepare France for
the eventual withdrawal of the whole
expedition, which now consists of seven
officers and 120 men.
The British view of the latest move
is that the Marquis of Salisbury and
his Ministers are delighted to afford
Major Marchand the facilities for
reaching Cairo. But they would
hardly care to send him back except
in the capacity of a guest or scientific
explorer. That is to say, France will
first have to renounce her principal
claims based on his mission.
In the meantime in the voluntary re
turn of Major Marchand, the French
Minister of Foreign Affairs, M. del
Casse, and the Government of France
have got over a great difficulty from a
diplomatic amour propre point of view.
M. del Casse had declared that the
French Government could not do the
impossibleâ that is to say, recall Major
Marchand. Therefore the latter's re
turn has enabled the French Govern
ment to "save its face" as the saying
goes. It is recognized, however, that
even if the tri-color of France is hauled
down at Fashoda, the main subject < f
dispute remains and may cause anx
ious moments in both countries before
the Bahr-el-Ghazel question is settled,
although there has been a confident
feeling for the last few days that war
will be averted. The French Minis
terial crisis at first increased' the feel
ing of anxiety which prevailed as to
the prospects of a peaceful solution;
but in the list of probable Ministers
the British newspapers'eee a body pf
experienced and capable men who are
able to lead French opinion.
The retention of M. del Casse at the
head of the Ministry of Foreign Af-'
fairs, however, is not regarded favor- !
ably, as he is the father of the March
and adventure.
An instructive account of the origin
of the whole enterprise appears in an
important Paris paper, JJe Journal,
which says the Marquis de Mores, the
Anglophobe, French explorer, who was
assassinated in the hinterland of Al
geria, really conceived grandiose plans,
which he submitted to M. del Casse,
who fell tn with his view:) and dis
patched Major Marchand to the Upper
Nile, while De Mores started for the
Sahara with the avowed hope to con
quer, with the co-operation of March
and, the province of Bahr-el-Ghazel.
The plan of campaign included the or
ganization of all the armed peoples op
posed to Great Britain, and included
even the co-operation of the Khalifa,
whose forces, led by Frenchmen, would
attack the British, and the Khalifa,
backed by the French explorers, would
thus interpose a buffer between Egypt
and Central Africa, thereby thwarting
British aims. De Mores and his party
were massacred at the outset of their
journey, but Marchand succeeded in
carrying out his part of the plan, and
there is reason to believe the French
Government now wishes he had not
done so. As the Eclair says to-day:
"Major Marchand returning? Why
then did we go to Fashoda? In order
to play the game we played against the
English we ought to have had a navy
capable of making a brave show
against the English, instead of which
the fossils of our Navy Department
have left us incapable of fighting with
honor."
French newspapers seem to have lit
tle faith in Russia helping her ally in
the present crisis, while Russian dis
patches to the British papers affirm
positively that the Czar is decidedly
opposed to war, and has counseled the
FVench to abandon their untenable at
titude. It is even said that the Czar
has characterized the French attitude
as reckless.
The rumor from Paris of the inten
tion of the British Government to de
clare Egypt under the protectorate of
Great Britain has attracted little at
tention, as the general feeling is that
the moment is clearly inopportune for
such a step. It would be only playing
into the hands of France. There is
talk, however, of Great Britain adopt
ing extreme measures toward the Khe
dive of EÂ«â¢Dt unless he rnodifleÃ his at
titude. It is well known that he re
turns from each of his visits to Euro
pean courts filled with sinister* ideas
against British tutelage. I3ut every act
of petulaiicy has been met with an iron
hand. It is asserted that the Khedive
Abbislimi has shown no capacity for
government and is a mere puppet in
the hands of Frenchmen. Consequently
It hap be'en mooted that he is soon to be
deposed in favor of his. brother. Mo
hammed AH, who was born in 1875. and
who is a brighter and more amiable
youth.

Camp Thomas.
WHAT TWO CIVILIANS SAW
LOCAL PHYSICIANS TESTIFY AS
TO AN INJURED SOLDIER.
An Army Officer Tells the War Board
That the Sanitary Conditions
Were Exceedingly
Bad.
Epeclal Dispatch to The Call.
CHATTANOOGA, Term., Oct. 29.â
Major Edward T. Comegys was the first
witness before the War Investigating
Commission to-day. He was medical
purveyor here during the existence of <
Camp Thomas. He stated that there j
had never been any delay in the filling
I of his requisitions on the surgeon gen
eral, and that he had always been able
to meet all requisitions upon himself.
Major Comegys admitted that he had j
refused to fill some requisitions from j
the hospital of the Second Division of i
the Third Corps because satisfied the
articles demanded were not D eded. He
accounted for the sicknes. in Camp
Thomas by saying the men did not
know how to take care of themselves. |
"They seemed to think," said he,
"that when they had put on their uni
forms there was nothing else to do;
that they could simply enjoy them
selves and their officers ould do the â 
rest."
He thought the colonels and regi- |
mental surgeons were to blame.
Lieutenant James M. Arrasmith, who !
acted as chief commissary of subsist- 'â 
: ence for Camp Thomas, said that,
. while in the beginning there had been i
: some congestion on the transportation ;
I lines, there had never been any short- '.
i age of supplies. There was constantly j
: on hand an average of 1,500,000 pounds !
;of rations. The rations were the best j
i he had ever seen issued in many years' ;
I experience. He thought the principal :
trouble was in the matter of cooking.
Lieutenant Arrasmith said the sinks ',
; were very badly cared for, and that the
' stench around the camp at night was ;
simply stifling. He also said the disci
pline was very slack. The witness con- j
sidered Chickamauga a natural camp- \
ing site, but said there were more men j
in it than there should have been. Some i
of the volunteer regiments never took i
down their tents during their entire ;
: stay, and there was general negligence
of cleanliness and sanitation. He did
not accept the theory tha' the forma- ;
tion of the ground was such that the
| sinks could not be made deep enough, i
j There was, he said, a general improve- j
i ment in the camp after General Breck
! inridge took command.
Drs. BaxXer ami Boyd, local physi- '
i cians, were "called to testify in regard' toj
; the case of Sergeant Frank, who died'
here during the summer as the result !
â of a railroad accident. Dr. Baxter said \
: that, notwithstanding the man was in !
a state of profound, shack after the.ac-.
' cideiit, Dr. Samuel D. Hubbara. sur- '
{ geon of the regiment, insisted upon re- i
I moving the wounded man to Chioka
: mauga Park. The man died on the way j
! out, as he (Baxter) had predicted he
; would.
Dr. Baxter told of one train of Wis
! consin sick which he had seen on its ;
â  way home without a medical officer or 1
â¢ medical supplies.
The commission closed its sittings
here to-night by hearing the testimony
of some residents, stating their obser- ;
vation of the condition at Chicka- j
mauga Park while the troops were
â  there, and giving their conclusions as
to the causes of the sickness of the j
i soldiers. They defended the climate as :
salubrious and healthful, and generally
; attributed the prevalence of disease to
: the habits of the volunteers.
J. C. Howell. railroad station agent, i
! told of an instance in which fifty-four
, sick men, being part of the Wisconsin !
! command, had been placed on a train j
i and started to their homes without !
: medical supplies or physicians and \
without furloughs or transportation j
papers. They were taken off trie train i
at Chattanooga and their wants ad
', ministered to by members of the relief
: societies.
Ira J. Hannes, a private, acting as a
I member of the Hospital Corps, who
said he had been a practicing physician
ta Louisville, Ky., for eight years, was !
' examined on the lines of a communica- i
tion he had sent to the commission. In |
this communication he had charged
that patients had been treated for ty
\ phoid fever when they plainly had i
! pneumonia. He said there were several
â  such patients, and he gave the name of j
| Vincent Flora of the Third Illinois as |
i one of them, this, he said, being as
' plain a case of pneumonia as he had
! ever seen. Upon being pressed he modi
; fled his statements, saying that he had ?
i no consultations with the physicians as ;
: to their line of treatment. He said, j
i however, that he considered some of i
' the physicians incompetent. He also j
i charged that appointments were made ,
]in the hospital upon political lnfiu- |
i ence.
Dr. F. B. Stapp, a local physician, !
detailed a visit to the hospital of the >
i Second Division of the Third -Corps in ;
I August, saying he had found it over- j
crowded and dirty and with no phy
i sicians in attendance at the time. Dr. |
Stapp said he had seen a great deal of j
drunkenness among the soldiers in the .
j city, but he had never hSerd of any I
special effort to close the saloons and !
other places of vice. He had seen j
I drunken soldiers lying in the streets,
i and he was sure much of the sickness
! at Camp Thomas was due to the habits
of the men.

ing part in the massacre of British sol
diers on September 6, were executed to
day on 'the same spot where the seven,
earlier victims met their fate. In addition,
four Bashi-Bazouks have been sentenced

which he had forged the name of Mohr &

AMERICAN DISPATCH BOATS

Military Commissioners Begin the
Work of Taking an Inventory

nance.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 29.â The Presi
dent, Secretary Alger and Adjutant
General Corbin had an extended con
ference to-day, the principal topic un
der consideration being the occupation
of Cuba. There is no disposition to
change the date. January 1, fixed for
the assumption of control by the United
States. The questions discussed to-day
related mainly to transportation, ships,
equipment, landings and camps. The
reports of the Cuban Military Commis
sion and the army board appointed
to investigate and locate sites were
considered.
General Lawton, who has been for
some time Military Governor of San
tiago province, was present during a
portion of the conference, and gave
the President some information con
cerning conditions in Cuba. The re
ports of the board to select sites in
cluded a list of articles which would be
immediately necessary, and the de
partment has ordered the issuance of
advertisements for them. Colonel
Hacker and Colonel Lee, the latter
quartermaster with the board, have
been ordered to Washington to report
more in detail and to assist in the pre
parations for the embarkation of troops
to Cuba.
During his conversation with General
Lawton the President expressed his
gratification at the victorious conclu
sion of the campaign in Santiago prov
ince and at the manner in which the
officers and men conducted themselves.
HAVANA, Oct. 29.â The dispatch
boats Scorpion and Mantero are in
port, having arrived here yesterday.
The second engineer of the Mantero
died recently at sec of heart disease.
The Marianio beach landing place has
been definitely selected, and work on
the landing stage began this morning
under the direction of Captain Craw
ford of the engineer corps.
The Colonial Congress was dissolved
yesterday by decree of Captain General
Blanco.
Captain Brooks has been assigned by
the United States Military Commission
ers to make a detailed inventory of
every gun mounted on the fortifications
of Havana. The captain began work
this morning, in company with two
Spanish officers appointed by the Span
ish side. This is the first step taken by
the commission to investigate on its
own account the ordinance existing
here. i
The relief supplies of J:he Red Cross
steamer City of San Anronio have been,
so far, distributed as follows: Sixty
tons at Cardenas, twenty tons at Colon,
twenty tons at Jogellanas, twenty tons
at Navagas, ten tons at Union de
Peyes, ten tons at Sabanilla, forty tons
at Santo Domingo, twenty at Sagua la
Grande, sixty at Santa Clara and
twenty at Guanabacoa. All the hos
pitals and asylums at Matanzas have
also received medical supplies and
stores.
The Civil Governor of Havana re
cently ordered the removal of all the
beggars who are infesting the public
thoroughfares. They will be taken
to homes, hospitals and asylums desig
nated for that purpose.
The work of removing the beggars
has commenced. They w^ere placed in
closed wagons, which, however, did not
turn out' to be satisfactory convey
ances. The beggars proved to be most
unwilling passengers, opening the back
doors of the vehicles . and taking to
their heels as soon as the drivers
turned their backs. Consequently the
first attempt to free the streets and
public -places of hordes of professional
mendicants was entirely unsuccessful.
But to-day the Civil Governor will un
doubtedly enforce stringent regulations
which will accomplish the beneficial
result proposed.
POSTOFFICE ROBBED

Crime.
NEW YORK. Oct. 29.â Charged with a
crime that only the boldest cracksmen
attemptâ robbing a United States post
officeâKatie Boose. 12 years old. Is a
prisoner at the police station in West
Brighton, Staten Island. After search
ing for the bold cracksman John Smith,
a detective, to-day arrested Katie Boose.
Through a small window opening from a
storm lobby at the rear the thief had
gained entrance, took tha money from
the drawer, which was forced, and tore
open letters. When Katie Boose was ar
rested she made a clean breast of her
wickedness.
"I didn't think I was doing very
wrong," she said, as tears flowed down
her cheeks and she sobbed hysterically.
"I only wanted money, because you can
buy so much with it."
Until Uncle Sam decides what to do
with this youthful burglar she will be

tion of Cruelty to Children.

ATLANTA, Ga., Oct. -J.â Allan D.
Chandler was inaugurated Governor of
Georgia at noon to-day. In his address
he said:
"Not content with the extent of our
magnificent national domain, we are
reaching out thousands of miles for the
islands of the sea, with their heterogen
ous population, and there are those In
both political parties who would reverse
the policy of the country and enter upon
an- expansion scheme of colonization as
have the countries of Europe, which will
necessitate an immense standing army
and a large and costly navy. It will not
do for us to wander too far Into the
realms of experiment. Our safety Is in
conservatism and a rigid adherence to
the precedents of the past. This is espe
cially true of the people of the South. We
should resist all dangerous Innovations.
We should cling to the constitutional
right of local self-government, the sure
anchor of our safety, and oppose in every
legitimate way the increasing tendency
of, the Federal Government to encroach
upon the rights of States."

AMERICAN LOSSES
DURING THE WAR
Disease More Deadly
Than Bullets.
OFFICIAL FIGURES GIVEN
A TOTAL DEATH ROLL OF LESS
THAN 3000.
Statement of Commissioner of Pen
sions Evans of the Fatalities
Among Soldiers and
Sailors.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Oct. 29.â Commissioner of
Pensions H. Clay Evans, who is in this
city, states that up to September 30
the war with Spain had caused the
loss of 2906 American soldiers and sail
ors. He further declares that the sta
tistics of his office show that the per
centage of deaths in camps from dis
ease during last summer was much
less than it was during the Civil War.
Commissioner Evans being asked for
further particulars, spoke as follows:
"During the Rebellion 40,000 men were
killed in battle and 360,000 perished in
camps and prisons. From official fig
ures which have recently been com
pleted, covering a period from May 1
to September 30, I find that the total
number of deaths as a result of the
war with Spain was 2906. Of this num
ber 107 were officers. At Santiago the
loss of life was twenty-two officers and
222 men. This is an average of one
officer for every ten men. At Cardenas
one officer was killed. Since the bat
tles on Cuban soil sixty-one men have
died of wounds received in service.
"The total number of American sol
diers that have died in camps from dis
ease are eighty officers and 2520 priv
ates, or an aggregate of 2600. This is
remarkable, in view of the terrible cli
matic disadvantages, but it fully veri
fies the soldiers' adage that disease
kills more men than bullets. There
have been 600 claims for pensions filed
to date as a result of the war.
"In the Cuban campaign the loss of
so many officers is accounted for by the
fact that Spanish sharpshooters hid in
the trees and dense foliage used
smokeless powder and picked off the
officers with ease. Some of the wounds
received by officers were remarkable. 1
recall one case in particularâ that of
Captain Knox of the First Cavalry.
The captain was shot in the back. The
ball penetrated his kidney, liver and
lung and broke two of his ribs, but he
is alive to-day, and the President has
promoted him."
Commissioner Evans says the loss of
life resulting from the destruction of
the Maine in Havana harbor will be
placed on the same basis as mortality
in battle. He holds that the general
law providing for Indemnity to sailors
and soldiers in the Federal service will
apply to the explosion at Havana.
"Thus far only fifty-five claims have
been presented from relatives of the
boys who went down with the Maine,'*
said the Commissioner. "Every one
of them will be pushed through. It la
no more than right that the dependents
of the men who went to watery graves
in Havana Bay should be provided for
by the United States Government."

Forecast of the Coming Elections Indicates That
California Will Gain Three Representa
tives and One Senator.
NEW YORK, Oct. 29.â Careful and
unbiased reports from every
State in the Union indicate that
the next Congress will be Re-
publican. The Senate will be
Republican by a small majority and the
House of Representatives by a majority
of between fifteen and twenty. There
is nothing in the situation anywhere to
Indicate either a Republican or Demo
cratic landslide, but the unexpected
may happen. All experienced politi
cians agree that landslides come as
surprises, and there is an ominous feel
ing of unrest in the middle West, as
â well as in the rural communities of the
East.
Reports from Pennsylvania indicate
that notwithstanding the bitter efforts
made against Quay his Republican can
didate for Governor, Stone, will be
elected, though by a largely decreased
plurality. A remarkable campaign is
being carried on in New Jersey. The
indications are that Foster Voorhees,
Republican, will be elected Governor by
a slight majority and that the Legis
lature will be Democratic on Joint bal
lot, thus returning James Smith Jr. to
the United States Senate.
In Connecticut the Republicans will
probably elect Representatives in every
district.
New England bids fair to present its
usual unbroken Republican front.
In the middle West there are con
flicting reports. The Democrats claim
they will make a sweep there, but the
chances are not favorable to the ful
fillment of this prophecy.
On the Pacific Coast the Republicans
more than hold their own. The effect
of the sound money victory in Oregon
Is felt by the Republican party in Cali- :
fornia, which will elect the Governor.
Democratic silver fusion will win in
Kansas, South Dakota and Nevada. I
Michigan, the State of General Alger, j
Secretary of War, will probably main
tain its Republican position.
In Ohio there is no probability of Re
publican reverses, although the Demo
crats are making boasts of gains in
some Congressional districts. The Re
publicans and Populists have united in
North Carolina and claim they will con
trol the Legislature. This is disputed
by the Democrats, who claim the Leg
islature and also insist that they will
have a solid delegation in Congress.
But the fight of the year i 3 in N-ew
Tori.- State. The ej es or the country
are upon the spectacular contest be- 1
tween Theodore Roosevelt and Au
gustus Van Wyck for the governor
ship. It is a great struggle between
cities and rural localities. The Repub
lican apathy which threatened Roose
velt with an overwhelming defeat two
â¢ weeks ago has very largely disap
peared. In the county of New York
the situation has been complicated by
the introduction of the issue that the)
Judiciary must be independent of po- \
litical control. This may or may not i
be a factor in influencing votes for the I
governorship. The Democrats will make j
gains in the State Senate and also in !
the Assembly.
In New York there would seem to be
hardly any doubt that the Democrats !
will capture several seats that are now !
occupied by Republicans. Captain i
William Astor Chanler is carrying !
on a fierce and spectacular campaign !
against Representative Lemuel Ely !
Quigg, chairman of the Republican :
County Committee, and fully beJieves
he will beat him.
The United States Senate will also re
main Republican. The Republicans may
gain a Senator from California, but
the Democrats in that State say they
will not do so. In the present Congress
there are 204 Republicans, 122 Demo
crats, 15 Fusionists, 12 Populists and 4
Silverites. A canvass indicates that
the complexion of the next Congress
will probably be 193 Republicans, 143
Democrats, 8 Populists. 12 Fusionists
and 1 Siiverite. Thus the Republican
control of Congress is apparently not
in any danger, and the Republicans will
etillhave a working majority over the
Democrats and other parties.
The Democrats in Pennsylvania are
hopeful that the hot fight that is being
carried on there against Quay candi
dates by John Wanamaker and the Pro
hibitionist forces wil result in the over
turning of some of the districts that are
regarded as surely Republican, and the
triumph of the Democratic Congres-
Eional candidates.
In Indiana the Republicans are confi
dent they will at least retain their pres
ent strength in the House. The Demo
crats are equally confident that they
will increase theirs. Advices from con
servative sources Indicate that there
will be some changes in the make-up
of the Indiana delegation.
In Illinois, where the Democrats have
but three representatives now, they

Supplemental Register Opened.
MADERA, Oct. 29.â In the Superior
Court to-day Judge J. K. Law of Merced,
sitting for Judge Conley, handed down
a decision in re the application for an
alternative writ to compel the County
Clerk to issue a supplemental register
containing the names of all voters who
registered between eighty-five and fifteen
days prior to the election. He held that
all persons who registered prior to fif
teen days before election were entitled
to vote. The writ was granted, thereby
adding 119 names to the great register of
this county. The case will not be ap
pealed.
CaÃtroville Will Go Republican.
SALINAS, Oct. 29.â The Republican
meting at Castroville last evening was
the largest ever held in that place. The
speakers were F. F. Davis and F. Domin
guez of Los Angeles. Despite the fact
that Castroville ever since its foundation
has given large Democratic majorities, it
will this year go for Gage and Neff and
the balance of the Republican ticket.
This will be the greatest victory for the
Republican party in Monterey County.
Buys the Tyler Acres.
RED BLUFF. Oct. 29.â Half of the fa
mous Tyler estate, situated eight miles
south of Red Bluff, has been sold to
Charles Tate of Tehama. Tait has bought
me property for $26,000, and it is under
stood that he leases the other half.

Love that Alters.
" I<ove Is not love that alters when it alteration
finds."
That is one of the sublimest lines in all
literature. It is the final definition of love
by the world's greatest reader of the human
mind, â Shakespeare. Nearly all women
who truly love, love in this sublime way.
Men seldom do.
Woman's most glorious endowment is
the power to awaken and hold the pure
and honest love of a worthy man. When
she loses it and still loves on, no one in
the wide world can know the heart agony
she endtires. The woman who suffers
from weakness and derangement of her
special womanly organism soon loses the
power to sway the heart of a man. Her
general health suffers and she loses her
rood looks, her attractiveness, her amia-
bility and her power and prestige as a
woman. Dr. R. V. Pierce, of Buffalo. N.Y.,
with the assistance of his staff of able phy-
sicians, has prescribed for many thousands
of women. He has devised a perfect and
scientific remedy for women's ailments. It
ia known as Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescrip-
tion. It is a positive specific for all weak-
nesses, diseases, disorders, displacements,
irregularities, and debilitating drains pe-
culiar to women. It purifies, regulate",
strengthens and heals. Medicine dealers
sell it, and no honest dealer will advise
you to accept a substitute that he may
make a little larger profit.

UNIVERSITY STUDENTS UNITE FOR REPUBLICANISM.
"Rah, rah-yah,
"Rah-U. C. Berke-rah,
"Stanford, Berke-rah .*â¢
It was the old time clashing of yells that woke to wildest enthusiasm
and stirred to sounding cheers the thousand students of California's two
big universities and the thousand friends that they had brought with them
to Woodward's Pavilion to aid them In their splendid ratification and expo
sition of Republicanism.
It was the clashing of the yells and the lines twixt 'varsity and 'varsity
were as clearly drawn as they have been on many a hard-fought foot
ball fleld, but on the main proposition there was accord at least twixt
U. C. and Stanford.
On two sides of the hall the delegations from either institution were
drawn up in solid phalanx, the "Profs" and their wives and daughters at
the front and doing their good share of the "rooting."
From both sides of the hall the old time sarcasms' were bandied and
g-ood natured derision tossed back and forth. And all of this was kept up
right blithely until the business of the evening was begun. Then shone out
the real and not the counterfeit spirit that binds these two big institu
tions of the Greater West.
Berkeley's speakers were marched to the rostrum to the quickstep of
Stanford's band and Stanford's orators were cheered and lauded to countless
blushes by rooters of the Blue and Gold. Football fields^ debates and field
days were sponged out of memory and the men of the two colleges, with a
great good fellowship, united on the vital and the real life that they are
living. In the face of a country's need, in the light of a new century, on
the threshold of an unknown and unsoundable epoch of prosperity they
clasped hands over factional jealousies and schoolboy rivalries to unite in
a eulogy of country and party.
To the Chief Executive they paid high tribute and to his splendid
statesmanship that has opened to them at a time when theycan make best
use of them, opportunities such as no mart In times past has had. And to
the needs of the times and to their critical condition they gave the weight of
their eloquence and the depth of the college man's perception.
Upon the issues of the day they were united, and there was no discord
ant note nor anything but the white heat of political enthusiasm In which
the men of both colleges merged and worked out their ends.
The old pavilion was dressed in its gayest; flags and buntings and flow
ers everywhere typified the spirit of the evening. On a rostrum hung over
with the national colors were ranered the speakers, the glee men and a half
dozen of those who were particularly honored as wise wights of the creed.
Before it Stanford's band of forty and odd nieces was ranged, and they
did much to help along the rackety enthusiasm of the night.
General Barnes, whose speech will live in the memories of the men who
heard it, had stowed himself away among a dozen of the more sedate of
the members of the two faculties, but he was hunted out and marched to the
speakers' stand between the ranks of a thousand men who leaped to their
feet to greet him.
Republicanism's "nigh leader" settled into his seat with a smile of su
preme contentment. He told the boys later that It was Kis happiest day in
years.
It devolved upon Professor C. A. Dunniway of Stanford to bring order
out of the din before him. The Stanford band was doing its worst to drown a
ripping Berkeley yell, and it was ably assisted In its fell Intent by the full
delegation of Stanford rooters. In the excitement of the moment profes-
Bors and others of like Ilk were forgotten, but when the gavel finally made
itself heard the classroom quiet of the last recitation hour settled over the
hall and the audience stood to hear Professor Dunniway announce that It
was his pleasant duty," etc., for all the world like any one of the score
and more nominees who have become veterans of the stump in the last few
weeks.
But Professor Dunniway's little speech was not like hiÂ» beginning. It
was the voice of the university speaking, not for office, but for politics in the
highest and purest; politics as the synonym of all that is good and right in
the lives and affairs of men. And those of Stanford and Berkeley listened
with an attention that did not lag to the end of his say.
"It is my very pleasant duty," said Professor Dunniway, "to give you a
few words of welcome. You know that it Is often said that a university man
in politics is like a bull in a china shop, but that, like a good many sayings
of its sort, I hold not to be true. The university and the university man are
always in politics. Politics in its true sense, I mean. The general idea of
a man who is in politics is that he Is out for an office. In that sense we are
not In politics, but of it.
"I think that it is a sign of the best progress that the university men
are coming out to claim their rights and place in the nation's politics.
"Look at these opponents of ours Bprawling over three platforms. And
look at the ideas that are embodied in these platforms.
"Every man who does not believe in the theory of the single tax; every
man who thinks that California should vote to uphold President McKinley;
every man who believes in good sound money on a gold basis and not in
this 16 to 1 nonsense, or in fiat money, as one of the three parties would have
it, is in duty bound to vote the Republican ticket In November."
Professor Dunniway was not allowed to make way for his successor
without bowing to the plaudits of the blue and the gold and the frantic ap
plause of his own excited charges, but the announcement that a veteran of
the older institution was to speak brought quiet.
Hon. William R. Davis. U. C, class of '74, was announced as the presi
dent of the evening.
"I thank the student bodies of these two grand institutions of this
later day for assigning me as one of those who are to speak. It is a happi
ness that you younger men cannot understand to see the youth of both
institutions here to-night with not one note of discord, and giving their
best thought to the questions and principles and needs that are of our
glorious Government of to-day. It augurs well for the nation when the
flower and best intellect of its youth takes up the problems of its govern
ment.
"This spirit of accord is as it should be between two institutions of
kindred aims that are both anchored in the granite of State and individ
ual bounty.
"Politics such as you pursue will work to your own betterment and
the uplifting of all that shall certain to your later life; but there is one
thought that rises to my mjnd, and of Its im-^rt I wish to warn you â Woe
to him who shall ever attemut to introduce partisan politics into these
universities.

"There are sources of learning and institutions of learning that do and
should always stand up far above all parties and platforms, and such are
these two universities. A second thought is that out of these two institu
tions is to come the grandest manhood and womanhood of the nineteenth
century, the men and the women who are to guard zealously and make
the most of the God-given promise that is opening before us with this new
era. Berkeley and Stanford are two unquenchable torches, that are light
ing your way to this era of the bright future. Stay in the light
"There are three well defined lines of our civilization. The first began at
the Atlantic seaboard. Its signal points were Portland on the north, Sa
vannah on the south. It overflowed the Alleghenies, and the second line
was drawn down the broad Mississippi, and the third was last drawn, not
on our coast, but out over the waters to include Hawaii and the Philippines,
and in this last line lies your work and your future."
A stirring song by the Stanford quartet was followed by C. E. Reith,
U. C, 00. who unmercifully grilled the "Little Giant" and held up the
record of his course in Congress. He said that in 1888 Maguire abandoned
Democracy and told the party that if they wanted his support they would
have to adopt his fads and crankisms.
"And that," said Mr. Reith, "is the reason why Mr. Maeruire is again sup
porting Democracy, or, rather why Democracy is supporting Mr. Maguire."
C. S. Chandler, Stanford '99, stated that the Democratic party of to-day
is of undoubted anarchistic and socialistic tendencies. He spoke in scathing
terms of the attacks that Maguire and his ilk have made, upon the Supreme
judiciary, and pointed out that in attacking the integrity of the courts they
were attacking the foundation of the Government itself.
R. C. Daniels, U. C. '99, followed Mr. Chandler with an expose of Ma
guire's peculiar- course with reference to the so-called funding bill. Mr.
Daniels spoke by the book and was warmly seconded by his audience.
Mr. Daniels gave way to Herbert Dam of Hastings College of the Law.
It was Mr. Dam's special province to defend the Supreme judiciary against
the unwarranted attacks made by Phelan and Maeoiir* and their consorts.
In a clear <mt exposition of plain, written law he showed conclusively
that the charges made have been logically impossible of truth.
S. G. Bailee, Stanford '99, referred to an attack made by a student from
Stanford on Justice Van Fleet UDon the occasion of the Democratic stu
dents' meeting a week ago.
"That young man," said Mr. Bailee, "I know for a fact has never read
or been informed of the decision of which he pretended to speak. They also
say that our university is dominated by Maguire and those of his creed.
The truth is that ths Stanford Maguire Club has fifty members, while the
Gage Club is staggering along under a load of 300."
There was another good campaign song, this time by the Berkeley Glee
Club, and Chairman Davis rose to announce General Barnes, Than that
â which was tendered to- California's greatest orator there has never been a
more generous, heartfelt reception.
General Barnes had waited upon applause for a chance to speak on
many a big occasion, bat never before has it gone to his heart as on last
evening. "When he could command his voice, he said:
"I came here to-night to listen to these young men from the univer
sities. There is no man alive who thinks more of young men than I do.
There is nothing so splendid as youth. Nothing so. grand and beautiful as
a pathway on which the sun shines alwayg and over which a cloud neves
floats.
"The young man of to-day is lucky to bi born when he was. He stands
on the doorstep of the most wonderful century /that the world ever saw.
In the last hundred years steam has been mad% to do our bidding; the
lightnings have annihilated space and contracted the size of the world;
we have almost harnessed time itself. And yet the century to come, I do
not hesitate to say, will be a greater in progress than the one that is about
to close.
"Remember that this nation of ours has expanded from the lines
that our fathers drew at the Mississippi, not to the Pacific's shore, but be
yond, to Hawaii and 3000 miles farther to the Philippines; that our nation
has grown in a hundred years from a people of 3,000,000 to a people ot
100,000,000.
"You young men will see things that we have never seen. "We have
seen a severed nation, rent and torn and divided against itself. You have
seen it too, but with Its bonds reunited. You are living In it to-day â you,
the one grand, glorious and really free people of all this globe. This has
been a wonderful epoch, but the one to come is a greater. I wish I could
live to see it, but I cannot. You can though and you shall, and I am glad
to see you fellows of the universities taking the interest you are in the
questions of the day.
"Since this campaign began I have been through nearly every county
in the State. I have stood under the snows of Shasta and I have stood and
looked from San Diego across the line at the table lands of Mexico. I dont
know how it is, but every campaign that comes along I am dragged out to
do duty. I cannot help working for the old party, for I love it. But this
campaign has been of particular interest and I have enjoyed It. I have
been in this campaign and Judge Maguire knows it. I am the Judge's night
mare. He never goes to sleep but he sees my face, he never wakes but he
prays for immunity from sudden death, fire, flood and Barnes.
"He is the loneliest man of this campaign; from place to place he travels
alone. The people turn out. look at him, like the prospect and go away
again. I have been through this campaign, and Maguire knows it. He said
the other day that if I would go and take a kindergarten course In single
tax he would argue it with me. Well, I've read everything little Maguire
ever wrote on it, and if that is not a kindergarten course I don't know
what is.
"I do not hesitate to say that Mr. Gage will beat Maguire by from 10,000
to 20,000 votes. I can pronounce Magulre's chance dead. The remains will
be on exhibition until November 8, at which time interment will take place.
You will kindly omit flowers.
"The most amusing thing I have ever seen is the real old Populist. A
genuine Populist, one of the sort who swallows everything. He knows of
the combination that Maguire made with his -arty and of the promises
Maguire made, and ever since he has been coming forth with his ears awag
to hear this giant say something about the good old fads and fool notions
of the Populists, and he hasn't heard one yet.
"And there are a good many of these good old Pops who have learned
what Maguire is, and there are a good many more who were Republicans
once, and they are coming back home. They are going to be grood Republi
cans again. They have told me so at every meeting. But I have yet to
meet the man who has left the ranks of grand old Republicanism. Of the
faces that I have learned to love in a quarter of a century of work for the
dear old party not one is mlasing."
The general closed with a denunciation of Maguire and his alleged
Democracy that carried hi 3 hearers off their feet, and 'mid cheers from a
thousand throats he made room for Henry T. Gage, who had arrived late
from Oakland.
Mr. Gage had not much to say, nor could he have said much that would
have been heard through the deafening cheers that greeted him. It was
simply a pledge .to the people's best interests and an assurance that party
success in the coming election is already a fact.OFFICIAL

WHY THE CZAR IS DISPLEASED
RAPPROCHEMENT WITH GREAT
BRITAIN DENOUNCED.
Emperor William's Visit to the
Orient Said to Be an Attempt to
Undermine Russian Influ
ence in Tuxiiey.
Copyrighted, IS9S, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, Oct. 29.â The official rela
tions between Germany and Russia
have been ruffled recently. This fact,
although denied by the Government or
gans, was obtained from a person in
high authority, and one of the most
striking proofs of the accuracy of the
statement is that Count Muravieff, the
Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs,
has just visited Paris and Vienna, but
Ignored Berlin. The German news
papers remarked this, and have com
mented on the omission.
Other significant facts are the almost
outspoken hostile tone of the entire
Kussian press, in which the rapproche
ment between Germany and Great
Britain is described as an underhand
piot against Russia, which the latter
is justified in keenly resenting, in view
of her friendliness to Germany in
China in the recent tariff negotiations.
Moreover, Emperor William's visit to
the Orient is characterized as an im
pudent attempt to undermine Russian
influence in Turkey and the position of
the orthodox church in Palestine. The
Kussian clerical authorities fear Ger
man Protestant rule in Jerusalem,
where the orthodox pilgrims are ten
times more numerous than those of all
other creeds together. It is said that
Kussia, in order to counteract the
Anglo-German agreement, has come to
a closer understanding with Austria,
by which those two countries and
France will jointly oppose the increas
ing influence of Germany in the Orient,
and will in no case permit Turkish ces-
Bion to Germany.
The bulk of the German newspapers
express the opinion that Emperor Wil
liam's trip will yield little tangible
good, but will create much jeaiousy
upon the part of the interested powers,
Avho will endeavor to destroy any Ger
man projects in Asia Minor. The Ger
man comic papers are also poking fun
at the Emperor and his. new crusade,
leading in some cases to prosecutions
on the charge of lese majeste. The police
confiscated the last number of Simpli
cissjmus owing to its publication of a
poeni entitled, "In the Holy Land,'
ironically congratulating Palestine on
ing such august visitors, and
paying Golgotha will be able to boast
not only of hearing the last words from
the cross, but the first of Emperor
William's.
The German newspaper correspond
ents with Emperor William highly
praised the lavish hospitality of the
Sultan of Turkey, which, however, has
created intense dissatisfaction. Pla
cards have been posted on the mosquea
and in the streets of Stamboul, de
nouncing the extraordinary sums spent
on the Emperor, which money, it is
further pointed out, comes out of Mo
hammedan pockets.
It is said the Sultan offered to pre
sent Emperor William on the occasion
of the latter's arrival at Jerusalem
with. the famous "chamber of the last
supper," but the German Emperor
thanked the Sultan and declined the
proposal on the ground that the build
ing also contained Turkish religious
relics. The Emperor, it is further as
serted, will get some other valuable
present instead.
Another report says the Sultan in
sisted upon paying the entire expense
of the Emperor's tour out of his own
private purse.
The German newspapers, . in asking
for a denial of this report, declare that
while the Emperor was at Constanti
nople he had for reasons of foreign pol
icy to be the Sultan's guest, but they
added that as soon as his Majesty set
foot in the Holy Land as a Christian
pilgrim there was no longer anything
in common between him and the Sul
tan, and he could not remain the lat
ter's guest.
It appears that the progress of the
Emperor and Empress through Pales
tine has been very fatiguing, especially
to the Empress. There has been plenty
of color and picturesque tableaux, but
the heat has been intense. The jour
ney on Thfursday was especially try
ing and the terrific hot march lasted
thirteen hours. The Turkish cavalry
escort lost four horses.
Their imperial Majesties have been
receiving addresses from the German
colonies at each town thiy have vis
ited.

CELEBRATION
OF PARNELL
ANNIVERSARY
Dublin's Chief Event
for the Week.
THE SEVENTH OF THE KIND
AN UNUSUAL DEMONSTRATION
IS SUCCESSFULLY HELD.
Monster Procession Headed by
Mounted Men and the Memorial
Car Guarded by Foresters in
Picturesque Costumes.
BY J. J. CLANCY.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
DUBLIN. Oct. 15.â The celebration of
the Parnell anniversary has been the
principal event of the week. When it is
remembered that it was the seventh of
the kind, it was undoubtedly a remark
able demonstration. The Parnellites. of
course, outside LHibJin, the other large
cities and towns, and some counties are
in a minority; yet every October for the
last stven years 26,000 or 30,000 people have
come up from the provinces to join in the
procession through the streets of Dub
lin to Parnell's grave in Glasnevin, and I
do not believe that anything of the kind
has ever taken place in honor of any
other Irishman, living or dead. This year
I learn that the exact number who trav
eled by railway alone to Dublin was 23,400.
To this throng Dublin city and county
added its usual multitude. It would be
difficult to say how many people alto
gether were in the streets, but probably
I should not exaggerate If I put it at over
100,000. The procession was headed by a
contingent of men on horses, after whom
came the memorial car drawn by four
horses^ and guarded on each side by
mounted Foresters, who wore their pic
turesque costumesâ hat with white
plumes, green coats trimmed with gold
braid, white buckskin breeches and long
top boots. The car was constructed for
the lirst anniversary demonstration, and
every year, on the eve of the procession,
it is elaborately decorated with flowers
by a committee of ladies. This time
infinite pains must have been bestowed
upon it, for it was a really artistic floral
monument. Behind the car there came
on foot the members and ex-members of
Parliament who stood by Parnell at the
time of the split in IS9O, or who have since
been elected on Parnellite principles.
Then followed, in a long array reaching
over a mile, corporate representatives of
Dublin and other cities in their munici
pal robes, the Dublin Fire Brigade, fully
accoutered and equipped for action, or
ganized deputations from various places
with bands and banners, and finally an
apparently interminable line of "outside"
cars, carrying women as well as men.
The procession took over an hour in pass
ing a given point.
When the memorial car was within a
quarter of a mile of the historic ceme
tery of Glasnevin the bands which had
hitherto played joyous or martial airs
broke out into mournful music, to the
strains of which the processionists filed
into the beautifully laid out grounds of
the City of the Dead and walked around
the mound where the remains of the
great Irish leader lie. This plat is in the
immediate neighborhood of the O'Connell
Round Tower and the Cemetery Church.
It is a spacious circular mound, which
was unused for forty years, but in the
famine times many were buried in it who
died of starvation and cholera. It is now
covered all over with lloral wreaths, the
grass te kept carefully cut, the passages
through it graveled; right in the center
Is an iron cross, which marks the head of
the coffin; and around it is a handsome
iron railing erected at a cost of Â£400 and
painted dark green. Certainly no grave
In Giasnevin is so beautifully kept. I
may add that it is so kept not by the
cemetery authorities, but a committee of
ladies, one or two of whom attend to it
personally every Saturday throughout
the year, in the depth of winter as well
as in the height of summer, and have
done so ever since October, 1891, a circum
stance which is only one of many which
show the intensity of the personal devo
tion which Parnell inspired and which
seems destined to outlive him for many
a day to come. I may remark, too, that
those who do not feel that devotion seem
to be more attracted to the grave of Par
nell than to any other spot in Glasnevin.
It is constantly the resort of visitors
from all parts, and it is a commm sight
to see persons attending funerals make it
a point to visit it before leaving, al
though those who do so must have per
formed the same pilgrimage a hundred
times before. To return to the proces
sion, it only remains to add that it
passed through the cemetery in perfect
order, returned to the city and then broke
up, the greater portion of the visitors
from the provinces leaving for their
homes by the evening trains. On the
whole. I repeat, it was a wonderful dem
onstration, considering that it was the
seventh of a series, that a large propor
tion of those who attended traveled from
remote places, and that it is only two
months since many of them traveled the
same distances to take part in the great
demonstration in honor of Wolfe Tone.
For several years past it has been the
custom of the Parnellite leaders to hold a
convention of their supporters on the day
following the procession to Glasnevin,
and on this occasion the custom was duly
observed. The meeting was held in the
public halls of the city, under the presi
dency, as usual, of John Redmond, Si. P.,
who was accompanied to the platform by
several of his parliamentary colleagues,
by the Lord Mayor of Dublin, the Mayors
of Cork and Kilkenny, and other men
prominent in public life in various parts
of Ireland. Considerable interest at
tached to the proceedings, because it was
understood that at least two subjects
which are much in people's minds just
now would be dealt withâ namely, the
question of national reunion and the atti
tude that should be adopted by National
ists in the coming elections under the new
local government system. The conven
tion did deal with both. On the latter
subject the unanimous view was that Na
tionalists ought everywhere to make sure
of a majority, but that subject to secur
ing a majority the "Loyalist" minority
should everywhere be accorded a fair and
even a liberal representation in the new
elective bodies. In other words, it was
deemed advisible to make the new
councils, as far as possible, stepping j
stones to home rule, but at the same
time, by not boycotting capable men be
longing to the anti-Nationalists' minor
ity, to secure the successful working of
the new system, and to show the oppo
nents of home rule that they would have
nothing to fear from the restriction of
an Irish Parliament. This moderate atti
tude has, as far as I can see, been gen
ally approved. On the question of re
union the decision was unanimous too.
Every one who spoke expressed himself
in faVor of reunion, but contended time
two conditions were essentialâ first, that j
it should commence from the bottom, not
from the top; that it should begin with
the people, not with the parliamentary
parties; and second, that it should be an
independent or Parnellite principle. A
union of parliamentary parties, under
present circumstances, was deemed im
possible, as it would simply mesm the
subjection of the Parnellltes to the sway
of a larger body between whom and
themselves, it is contended, there is a
wide difference in policy. But the con
vention at the same time saw no objection i
to co-operation between the parties in
Parliament and out of it on every subject
in which they agreed. Mr. Redmond
pointed out that last session the two par
ties acted together to a very considerable
extent in the House of Commons, and the
convention practically endorsed the view
that that course might be usefully con
tinued in the future. And no doubt it
will be, so far as Mr. Redmond and his
colleagues are concerned.
A multitude of other topics were dis
cussed, but I may pass them all by but
one. It was inevitable that the project of
an Anglo-American alliance recently
brought to the front by Mr. Chamberlain
should engage attention at such a gath

ering as the Independent Nationalist con
vention, and it was inevitable also that it
should evoke a decidedly hostile mani
festation. The view taken was that Eng
land in this matter was animated by
purely selfish ifeotlves and was endeavor
ing to entrap America into helping her In
her European isolation without being able
to give the American republic any corre
sponding advantage in return. I may add
that this is not the view of the Parnellltes
alone It is the confirmed opinion of all
Irish Nationalists. The Irisa do not be
lieve in the "Oiood thicker than water"
theory, which the English are so fond of
subject. They recall not only the war of
Independence but such incidents as the
Trent affair during the Civil War. as
showing better than any latter day mani
festation of feeling the real sentiment of
England toward America. In the Interest
of America itself, therefore, they would
be sorry to see the projected alliance
even take tangible Bhape. I need not add
that from the point of view of Ireland
they would regard it as a calamity.
As to the immediate future, the Par
nellltes intend to be as active as possible
in the coming winter. A series of local
conventions and other meetings are to
be held in the provinces in connection
with the coming elections and for the
promotion of the Parnellite movement
generally. John Redmond has already

NEW SCHEME TO BEAT
THE CUSTOMS DUTIES
Heavy Importations Into Hawaii for
Transhipment to the
United States.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 29.â Harold M.
Sewall, special agent of the United States
at Honolulu, has called the attention of
the State Department to the large impor
tation of goods into Hawaii under the
rates of the Hawaiian tariff and which
are to be shipped to the United States
when the restrictions on trade between
the islands and the United States arc re
moved. He presents statements showing
an increase of Imports for the first seven
months of 1898, compared with those of
THE EMPORIUM.

previous years, together with a compara
tive statement of imports by countries for
that period. Imports from countries other
than the United States, he says, show an
increased volume altogether dispropor
tionate to present or prospective demands
for local consumption.
"A comparison of the schedule of rates
Imposed by the Hawaiian tariff and those
imposed by the Dingley law," says Mr.
Sewall, "will show what an inducement
is offered Importers in anticipation of the
extension of the Dingley tariff to Hawaii.
The Hawaiian tariff imposes an average
rate of 10 per cent and has a liberal free
list. But on numerous articles of Ameri
can manufacture, which ought naturally
to find a large outlet in Hawaii, duties
are very heavy. Notably among these
are to be classed carriages, jewelry and
brushes at 25 per cent each, and whisky,
the rate on which is $3 50 per gallon and
10 cents for every degree above proof.
Hawaiian customs authorities have been
at work for some time preparing a state
ment of the revenues that are to be real
ised on Hawaiian imports under the
Dingley tariff law."
Mr. Sewall says he has been credibly
informed by Hawaiian merchants that Im
ports are being made with the express
purpose of profiting by the new tariff,
but that he does not deem it wise to give
the names of importers.

TriE THANKSGIVING PROCLAMATION
PRESIDENT .McKIXLEY'S proclamation fixing
Hiursday, fjovembcr 24. as the day for the annual
national Thanksgiving comes opportunely to
remind the people in the midst of partisan discussions
of the manifold blessings the country enjoys and the
bountiful prosperity which as a rule has attended our
industries. It is not a campaign document, and none
will consider it so, but nevertheless it is likely to have
effect upon the minds of the intelligent by allaying
discontents and steadying the masses who have been
excited by the appeals of demagogues and agitators.
"Few years in our history," says the President,
"have afforded such cause for thanksgiving as this.
We have been blessed by abundant harvests, our
trade and commerce have been wonderfully increased,.
our public credits have been improved and strength
ened, all sections of our common country have been
brought together and knitted into a closer bond of
national purpose and unity."'
Nor is it in our domestic affairs only we find rea
son and cause to give thanks for what the year has
brought. The very war which threatened to interrupt
our peaceful development of industry has proven a
gain to the nation in many way?. "As we were com
pelled," says the President, "to take up the sword in
the cause of humanity, we are permitted to rejoice
that the conflict has been of brief duration, and the
losses we have had to mourn, though grievous and
important, have been so few, considering the great
results accomplished, as to inspire us with gratitude
and praise toward the Lord of Hosts."
Angry partisans in the heat of political conflict may
be. loth to agree with the President that this year has
been one of exceptional good to all the people of the
United States, but with the passing of the partisan
conflict on election day calmer judgment will come,
and then all with one accord will unite in the rejoicing
over what has been vouchsafed to our industries and
to our arms. The year has been indeed a great and
glorious one for our country, and when the day ar
rives North and South and East and West all the
people will celebrate with glad hearts the solemn and
joyous festival of the national Thanksgiving.
"LOVE WILL FIND fJ WflY."
SOMEBODY once wrote a song of which the
only sentiment worth preservation was "Love
Will Find a Way." This naturally calls into
question whether love is always justifiable. Would it
not, ratb,er, under some circumstances, seem more like
the genuine article if it withdrew from the field?
There have been several instances in this city lately
in which men believing themselves inspired by this
holy passion have slain the objects of their affection.
"Love" went too far. "Love," as represented in the
persons of these degenerates, should without delay be
hanged. The ambition to marry a worthy girl is noth
ing of which any man should be ashamed. The re
fusal of any girl to marry a beetle-browed brute who
would neither provide for her nor appreciate her
should not, notwithstanding, be regarded as a capital
offense.
In addition. to the murders inspired by refusal of
proffers where acceptance would have been a gross
violation of the dictates of common sense, husbands
have essayed to correct or impress their wives, results
being serious or fatal. These offenders deserve to
be hanged on the same scaffold with the other va
riety. They are exactly what the others would have
been.
When crime is rare, its occurrence is to be deplored
and checked by legal methods, while the world re
grets. But when it becomes common, when one hor
ror succeeds another in rapid succession, regret is
commingled with rage, and there is a human yearning
to have worthless necks stretched, not as a method of
revenge, but as a protection." "Love may find a way"
to the gallows, and any hampering technicalities will
be apt to revive the spirit of the old Vigilantes.
In the press of matter possibly more important
there has not been extended mention of the fact that
Mrs. Hamilton of Tennessee street has recovered her
nannygoat, the law giving it back to her arms after
an absence of eighteen months. We congratulate
Mrs. Hamilton, and the goat.
The gentlemen who wish to raise the Maine as a
speculation might also secure Mr. Noah's ark. It
would be s fine marine curio, and the two exhibited
together would afford an object lesson in the ad
vance of naval architecture.
Perhaps one reason Henley laments at the prospec
tive turning down of Phelan is a knowledge that at
the same time he will himself be turned down so hard
he'll never get over the bump.
If Mr. Grace wants to earn money in large sums he
ought to see what candidates can be induced to give
him for not indorsing them.
MAGUIRE AND STANFORD UNIVERSITY
,\ A AGUIRE denies that anything he has said on
/ \ land confiscation, anarchy or Ireland and the
* * Pope is in issue in this campaign. At the
same time he insists in every speech that what Gage
has never said nor done is put in issue by Gage's can
didacy. If Gage had ever written or said a word or
done a thing in favor of the Southern Pacific Rail
rc>ad, or taken a professional fee from that corpora
tion, does any one believe that Maguire would fail to
use it as an issue? Does any one believe that he
would fail to hold Gage responsible for it, read it and
demonstrate it in every speech he makes?
Of course every one knows that Maguire, while
dodging his own record, would greedily seize upon
any such fact in the record of his opponent. That he
can find no such thing in Gage's record is proved by
his,not using it.
In default of such material he has busied himself in
manufacturing a record for Mr. Gage to prove him a
railroad man. The work is not creditable to Judge
Maguire, but he is an expert in office-seeking and
stops at nothing that will keep the public treasury
open to his salary-seekhig hand. So he assumes to
invest Mr. Gage with a record he never made, with
intentions he never entertained, with acts he never
performed, with relations he never sustained.
At the same time Maguire denies responsibility for
his own utterances, intentions and relations, to which
his record for years commits him.
While he was making a speech in the House or. the
sth of July, 1898, on the Pacific railroad debt, Mr.
Hopkins asked him whether his position on that ques
tion had changed, to which Maguire replied: "It is
the same to-day as it has been on all previous occa
sions. I do not recall any change in my opinions on
this question in the last five years. My opinions are
fully incorporated in the Record." Now, in that
same speech Maguire said that Stanford, Huntington,
Hopkins and Crocker were guilty of "gigantic frauds.
* * * The original directors of the Central Pa
cific Company, in defiance and violation of every ob
ligation they owed as trustees, either to the company
they immediately represented or to the Government
of the United States, diverted $80,000,000 to their own
pockets. After this tremendous peculation of these
directors was disclosed the act of 1873 was passed. If
upon foreclosure of the Central Pacific the sale shall
fail to produce an amount sufficient to pay the claim
of the Government, I have no hesitation in saying
that the Government has a right of action against
the living directors and against the property of the
dead directors who diverted these assets, provided, of
course, that the property of the dead directors can be
found in the hands of persons who acquired it not by
purchase, BUT BY GIFT OR BY SOME MEANS
OTHER than purchase. It so happens that of the
original directors of the Central Pacific who diverted
ail these assets one is still living, * * * his es
tate is within reach of the courts. The other three
are dead, but it so happens that all their estates are
in such positions that the Government can reach them.
Charles Crocker is dead, but his estate before his
death was put by. gift into a corporation known as the
Crocker Estate Company. That great estate, made
up largely of the fruits, in many cases the direct
fruits, of these diverted assets, stands there to answer,
if under the principles of equity, jurisprudence and
the laws of the land his estate is liable, as I believe it
is. The Hopkins estate is in the same position prac
tically. The other estate, that of Leland Stanford, has
passed in part to the widow of the deceased and is
held by her very largely in real property. In the dis
cussion of a former funding bill it was suggested that
as Stanford had devoted his fortune, however ac
quired, to a quasi-public use, in the establishment of a
magnificent university in California, it would be
against public policy to disturb it, but it has no
relevancy as an argument in favor of a funding bill.
* * * What Congress should do if, in the collec
tion of its claims, the Stanford University were likely
to be crippled or closed or made less useful to the
public than it is now. I am not at present prepared to
say. * * â¢ * If this bill should pass * * * you
then wipe out all collateral obligations attaching to
the original contracts, including those arising out of
the gigantic frauds and breaches of trust to which I
have all too briefly and incompletely referred. The
directors and their successors, in the enjoyment of
colossal fortunes largely based upon these fraudulent
diversions of trust assets, will be immediately set free
from all liability to the Government and their offenses
condoned and compounded."
Now, there is a recent, direct and explicit charge
that Stanford University is founded and endowed on
the fruit of peculation, gigantic fraud and crime, and
that not only it, but the Hopkins Art School, given
to the State University, the Crocker Old People's
Home and Mrs. Stanford's kindergartens, the fine
conservatory in Golden Gate Park, the lake and other
creations in that park, and all and sundry the many
public gifts of millions of dollars given by the orig
inal four directors of the Central Pacific, are the "di
rect fruit" of crime. There is the direct assertion that
the Government of the United States can seize all and
singular these properties, and that Maguire is "not
prepared to say" what should be done if Stanford
University "is crippled or closed" by such seizure.
Recently Maguire has told certain students that he
will take Stanford University "under his wing" as
Governor, and by the demagogue arts of which he is
past master he is wooing votes in that institution.
But will he go to that university and, standing in the
great court where its founder lay in death and thou
sands carae to his obsequies, repeat his speech and his
charges of last July?
He said in the same speech that upon this subject
his opinions have not changed lor five years. Have
they changed in three months? Does he still be
lieve that Stanford stole the endowment of that uni
versity and that it may be crippled or closed by seizure
by the Government?
This is something that concerns the character of
the young men and women who are students at Stan
ford. It concerns an important section of State Uni
versity students who are related to the Hopkins Art
School.
If Maguire told the truth in his horrible accusation
against the dead, no honorable young man can stay
at Stanford. If Maguire did not tell the truth, no
honorable young man can stay at Stanford and sup
port Maguire. If he do he is, open-eyed, supporting
the contention that his alma mater is a monument to
"gigantic fraud," and is trying to put that stain forever
upon her walls by aiding in the indorsement of the
man who daubed it there in rhetorical mud only
three months ago.
Maguire is talking a good deal. Will he tell the
people if he still thinks the money that built Stanford
was stolen by its founder?
The Tacoma News uses type of impressive size to
make this announcement: "Our Soldiers Loose Their
Votes." What's the ground for excitement? Per
haps they wili loose them so they will do the most
good. _
If France becomes involved in war good by to the
republic. We suggest Dreyfus as dictator under the
â  new regime.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1893.
THE WINNER IN THE SIXTH-
BY the fierceness and the bitterness of the at
tacks made upon him by the orators and organs
of the fused factions of Democracy, Populism
and discontent, it is evident the Hon. Russell
J. Waters is making a winning contest for Congress
in the Sixth District. The very desperation of his
opponents is an evidence that the trend of public sen
timent is strongly in his favor.
Mr. Waters is one of the most eminent of the pro
gressive men who during the last twelve years have
done so much for the upbuilding of Southern Califor
nia and the development of its resources. Born in
Vermont in 1843, he removed first to Massachusetts,
then to Chicago, and finally in 1886 came to Cali
fornia.
From the time of his arrival in the State he has
been a leader in great enterprises. As the representa
tive of a number. of citizens of Chicago who desired
to establish themselves in California, he selected and
laid out a site for the colony in East Redlands, where
mÂ«st of the colonists now reside. Having in this way
become identified with the progress of the southern
part of the State, he has continued to promote its in
terests with energy and sagacity. He is at present a
resident of Los Angeles, and is known among the en
terprising men of that city as one of the most public
spirited and liberal in promoting every movement de
signed for the general good.
California needs at Washington just such men as
Mr. Waters. The State has many great interests in
volved in national legislation, for whose proper man
agement men of trained business ability, tireless
energy and a zealous fidelity to the public welfare are
required. The citizen who in the advancement of his
private business has accomplished so much to de
velop his section of the State can be relied upon to
give an equally valuable service in Congress, and with
the election of Mr. Waters the Sixth District will
have a representative to be proud of.
It is not, however, for his personal reputation only
that the popular sentiment of the district is favorable to
the Republican candidate. The intelligence of the peo
ple there as elsewhere perceives the importance of hav
ing at this juncture a Congress in harmony with the ad
ministration. The President will have grave problems
of foreign as well as of domestic politics to deal with
during the next two years, and tht success of his pa
triotic policies will be largely dependent upon the co
operation of the House of Representatives. In this
emergency the people owe it to themselves and to the
country to stand by the President.
While this is what is generally known as an off year
in politics, it is not so in reality. Rarely were more
serious problems ever presented to the American
people than those which will confront the Congress
that is to be chosen this fall. A Republican House of
Representatives is essential to the continued prosper
ity of the country, and the voters of the Sixth District
will serve the nation as well as their local interests by
the election of that stanch supporter of the adminis
tration, Russell J. Walters.
ELECTRIC RAILWAYS IN EUROPE.
CONSULAR Reports for October contains a re
port from Consul General Dv Bois of St. Gall,
Switzerland, on electric street railways in
Europe, from which it appears there were on that
continent on January 1 of this year 204 electric street
lines in operation, with an aggregate mileage of 1422
miles. This is a surprisingly small mileage when
compared with that of electric railways in the United
States, and the contrast is more striking when the
statistics are noted for the various countries sepa
rately.
Of the total electric street railway mileage of
Europe Germany contains almost exactly half, or 707
miles. France comes next with 246 miles. Great
Britain is third with only 97 miles, and little Switzer
land ranks fourth with 90 miles, or nearly as much as
Great Britain. Italy has 82 miles, Austria-Hungary
66, Belgium has 42, Spain 37, while the vast empire
of Russia has only 19 miles.
There are several cities in the United States that
have within their limits, or in their suburbs, more
miles of electric street railway than all Europe ex
cept Germany, and Philadelphia claims to have more
miles than Germany. In comparison with our devel
opment of that means of transportation, therefore,
Europe can be hardly said to have reached the electric
age.
The reason why European countries are so far be
hind us in this mode of street traffic appears to be
not so much a lack of enterprise on the part of pro
moters and projectors as an objection to the over
head wires on the part of the governing authorities
and that system seems at present to be the one most
favored by companies constructing electric lines.
Thus of the total number of electric roads in Europe
172 lines have the overhead trolley, 8 lines the un
derground trolley, 8 lines the third rail system, 13
lines the storage system and 3 lines a mixed system of
overhead trolley and accumulators.
It is a curious illustration of how the blocking of
progress in one direction leads to its advance in an
other, that the checking of electric street railway con
struction in European cities has been the cause of the
adoption there of the horseless vehicle to a much
greater extent than in this country. Our cities are
so well provided with street railways that we hardly
need the self-propelled vehicles for which there is
such a demand in Europe, and it will probably be a
long time before they are used here for any other pur
pose than that of delivering goods of a light charac
ter. Therefore while we can smile at Europe as being
somewhat silurian on the subject of electric railways,
we may expect them before long to mock at us for
being so slow in making use of the horseless vehicle.
There will be general public interest in the outcome
of the suit brought in Alameda by Martial Davoust.
His wife was killed by a dangling electric wire. Not
withstanding that corporations tacitly claim the right
to dangle wires, the consequent slaughter being
ascribed to Providence, people not ready to die, nor
witness the spectacular taking off of their friends, have
ventured heretofore modestly to take issue. Da
voust asks money damages, not that the value of a
wife is to be computed in cash, but that the under
standing of the corporation may be aroused.
Ladies in congress at Omaha devoted much time to
discussion of short skirts. When ladies get together
they are apt to do this, and to favor the short
skirt enthusiastically. But they do not reach that
stage of devotion to reform which impels them to lay
aside their own trailing street-sweepers.
If Chief Lees and Officer Kane will remain separ
ated by the length of a telephone wire, they will save
the public many a shudder of apprehension, though
the wire may melt with a fervent heat.
Jurymen in an Astoria murder case had a fist fight
in determining the question of guilt. The method is
unique, but it may be as good as some others.
Kansas soldiers will vote at sea, and as returns will
be long in getting back, the whole State will be at
sea for awhile.
i
THE HEAVY ARTILLERY.
NUMBER F.IGHT.
Editor San Francisco Call: The power of the people may be used against
the people. For our protection we have divided and subdivided political
office. We trust no politicians. We will give no man so much power that
he may become independent of the plain people, of you andme. This is the
palladium of our liberties â not Fourth of July speeches, not hollow appeals
for good government, not personal denunciations. We trust no man. The
State's business must be done, but we commit the business to so many
hands that no one man may monopolize it to our hurt.
The danger of boss rule consists in the attempt to destroy this subdi
vision of power. We do not object to bosses because they control votes.
We must have bosses so long as we have leaders. But we do object to the
boss who manages to control so many offices that he can afford to use the
power of the people against the people.
One great safegaard we haye â the multiplication of bosses. The one
boss who can control everything is far more dangerous to the plain citi
zen, to you and to me, than the many lesser bosses who fight and squabble
for power. Against the boss who is supreme 'here is no recourse for the
plain citizen, that is. for you and for me. Ap;,inst the squabbling bosses
we have remedies aplenty, because we ccn always use one to whack the
other on the head.
PLAIN PEOPLE USUALLY LOOK ON THE BOSS
As a wonderful and mysterious individual. We picture him as the spider
sitting in the center of his web, whence the sensitive threads radiate
to the circumference of the city or State. He is to most of us a Svengah
who by some strange hypnotic influence makes his Trilby subjects warble
at his will. But after all when we plain people, that. is. you and I, come to
think of it, a boss is but a man of flesh and blood, like ourselves. He is
dealing, too, with men who are like us in birth, in education, in sentiments.
Half of a boss' strength is in plain people like you and me, whom he un
consciously influences. His immediate followers are marvelously like us
plain people. They are subject to the same impulses and passions, and are
stirred by the same motives and interests. A boss gains power over his fol
lowers in the same manner and by the same means . that other leaders gain
power over their followers. Unless plain people like you and me understand
this thoroughly we are liable to make many mistakes in our estimate of
political situations in general, and of the present municipal campaign in par
ticular. One of the strongest motives that the boss can exercise over his fol
lowers is the promise of position. Every government in the world pays its
servants well and does not work them too hard. There are no situations in
San Francisco with such easy hours and such good salaries as the appointive
offices in the City Hall. These offices are, of course, filled by the successtul
candidates on the principle that
TO THE VICTORS BELONG THE SPOILS.
Now the boss, when he is' making his campaign, considers these ap
pointive offices as his most efficacious weapons. They are his heavy artil
lery. An influential district leader, a promising orator, an energetic vote
getter, may stand off from the fight and declare that he is not in politics this
year. He is deaf to all appeals, to reason, to gratitude, to party loyalty. But
let the boss train one of his big guns on him, a big, salaried position for him
or for his friend, and the plain citizen often wonders at the suddenness and
energy with which he mingles in the melee.
As the boss is the general, he must have the placing of the artillery.
Hence when he sets up candidates he does so on the condition that they will
relinquish to him a certain number of the nominations to appointive offices.
This is usually euphuistically styled, giving the organization a percentage
of the positions. As far as the plain citizen can judge of such things, the
usual figure has been about 50 per cent, for after all the greediest or most
necessitous boss must feel that the candidate who has borne the burden and
heat of the day is entitled to at least half his wages.
Where we have a number of bosses controlling a number of candidates
of course each has his own independent battery, and he directs it as best he
knows how. In the cross-fire the plain citizen often escapes safe. Where
one boss is delivering his lead into the intrenchments of another, the man
that is up a tree, that is, the plain citizen, grins with delight. But if one man
can control all the positions, he can direct his fire on the people. All the
guns will bark to one effect, to his advantage â that is, to the disadvantage
of the plain citizen, of you and of me.
MANY PEOPLE THINK
That it will be to the benefit of the plain citizen to spike as many of those
guns as possible. They believe in cutting down the power of the .boss by
making the tenure of appointive places life or good behavior. This is what
is known as civil service. Plain people have yet to be convinced that there
is a governmental precaution that a boss cannot get around. We therefore
do not commit ourselves to civil service or to anti-civil service. Some of
us are in favor of it, and some of us are opposed to it. Anyhow, like plain
people, we agree to differ.
But the professional reformers and the #ood government people are
loudly pledged to civil service. Mayor Phelan is its stanchest advocate. He
demands a business administration, and of course we all know that every one
employed in Mr. Phelan's private business has a life tenure of his place. The
new charter he advocated because of its civil service provisions. He does not
believe in the vulgar cry, "To the victors belong the spoils." He wishes to
prove that he is no boss by spiking the heaviest guns in the bosses' artil
lery.
But the power of the people may be used against the people, and pbwer
corrupts. Mr. Phelan has used the power of the people to take from them
their right of nomination; he has used the power of the people to grasp
at the complete control of the city government; he is now using the power
of the people, the money of the people, the promise of office, to make certain
the ambitious schemes which he has contrived to raise the government of
the town to his own high and moral level.
EVERY CANDIDATE NOMINATED
By the Committee of One Hundredâ that is, by Mr. Phelan â was compelled
to lift his hand to heaven and promise to the organization â that is, to Mr.
Phelan â 80 per cent of the patronage of his office.
The plain citizen thinks of Mr. Phelan's words in favor of civil service,
and of Mr. Phelan's acts in demanding a larger share of the patronage than
any boss has ever dared to ask. You and I remember the question which is
the greatest danger to us, the many small bosses, or the one boss that con
trols them all? The power of the people may be used against the people.
We are put in pawn to buy workers for Mr. Phelan. He controls all the
artillery. It is an irresistible force. It is directed by one hand. It is used
for one object â the victory of Mr. Phelan, the capture of the city by those
who are pledged to do Mr. Phelan's bidding. Well, indeed, may it be asked
in alarm by the plain citizen â that is, by you and by me. Which is the great
est danger, the many small bosses, or the boss that controls them all?

Four Touchdowns Made Against Stanford's Cubs
by a Strong Blue and Gold Eleven Which
Plays Great Football.
California Freshmen, 21; Stanford
Freshmen, 0.
FULLY 3000 spectators watched the j
California cubs rub . the dirt and
dust of Recreation Park into the
eyes and skins of the eleven young
athletes from Palo Alto yesterday i
afternoon. A typical football gathering
filled the grand stand and bleachers. The i
cohorts from Berkeley were perched In i
their own section and the shouters from ,
Palo Alto did not mingle with them, but
eat alone in their icy seclusion, for it was :
a freezing day for Stanford. The fifth j
game between the freshman classes was ;
an overwhelming victory for California.
Harry Cross. Stanford's coach, sighed
and wore a look that was fathoms deep:
Garret Cochran smiled and seemed satis-
fled; the Stanford contingent on the
bleachers painted in red yelled but once,
and the California 'supporters acted as if
the one object in this world was to shout
themselves hoarse, wave blue and gold
flags, ribbons, chrysanthemums and in
quire every other minute what was the
matter with this man or that man. Stan
ford shouted but once, which was when
the whistle sounded the beginning of the
game. After that the occasion was not
there, so they kept silent and did heaps |

GET FLESH-
Cet . Strength. Vigor, Clear Complexion
and Good Digestion, Not by Patent
Medicine, but In Nature's Own Way
Any honest physician will tell you that
there is but one way to get increased
flesh; all the patent medicines and cod
liver oils to the contrary notwithstand-
ing.
Nature has but one way to increase
flesh, strength and vigor, mind and
body, and that is through the stomach,
by wholesome food, well digested.
There is no reason or common sense in
other method whatever.
People are thin, run down, nervous,
pale, and shaky in their nerves simply
because their stomachs are weak.
They may not think they have dys-
pepsia, but the fact remains that they
do not eat enough food, or what they
eat is not quickly and properly digest-
ed, as it should be.
Dr. Harlandson says the reason is
because the stomach lacks certain di-
gestive acids and peptones and de-
ficient secretion of gastric juice.
Nature's remedy in sue., cases is to
supply what the weak stomach lacks.
There are several good preparations
which will do this, but none so readily
as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, which
are designed especially for all stomach
troubles, and which cure all digestive
weakness on the common sense plan
of furnishing the digestive principles
which the stomach lacks.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets give per-
fect digestion. First effect is to In-
crease the appetite, and increased
vigor, added flesh, pure blood and
strength of nerve and muscle is the
perfectly natural result.
Stuart's. Dyspepsia Tablets is the
safest tonic known and will cure any
form of stomach trouble except cancer
of the stomach. May be found at
druggists, at 50 cents for full-sized
package or direct by mail from Stuart
Company, Marshall, Mich.

lof thinking instead. The freshies with
! the cardinal shirts who strutted a brief
: hour and a quarter on the Recreation
Park gridiron were a sorry lot after the
game. The red was transformed into
1 black and seemed buried under a tower
j ing heap of blue and gold. The result
i of the ninety minutes' ecstaey was a daz-
I zling victory for the Berkeleyites and an
I ignominious defeat for the bedraggled
banners of Stanford.
There was but one team in the game
â from start to finish. For a few minutes
when Stanford buckled down to work and
held the California freshmen on the two
yard line it lool*ed as if there was some
mucilage in the Stanford rushers, but this ,
proved a delusion and ever after the Stan
ford team acted as if they were sorry for
the creditable defense they made when
their goal was in danger. Early in the
first half Smith and Lippman and More,
all wearing the striped shirt of blue and
I gold plugged the red obstruction in front
of them for big gains until the danger
point was reached, and then the cardinal
stiffened sufficiently to get possession of
the ball. This was the only time the
Stanford colts played a good laudable
After this surprising and inconsistent
burst of speed the California team began
to exert itself on the road to touch
downs, and inside of five minutes a lot
of sprawling blue and gold kickers inex
tricably bound up with their red-shirtf-d
enemies on the goal line told the story of
a touchdown. Smith and Lippmann of
California, backed up by the entire team,
won the first score for California, and
the noise that floated over the field was
a sonorous indication that their efforts
were appreciated. Another touchdown
was scored in the first half, due to the
successful plugging of the Stanford line
and general fast work of the blue and
gold in their team play. Smith carried
the ball over for the first five points,
Lippman for the second. No goals were
kicked either tim*.
After that California, conscious mat
the Stanford team could make little head- | (
-way on the offensive, kicked the ball ; ,
whenever it was necessary. The defen- i ,
sive play of the Eerkeleyites was always ,
sufficiently effective to prevent the Stan- ;
ford team from gaining the required dis- \ -
tance, necessitating a kick after every I
second try on the part of the latter. At j â¢
times Stanford would hold the California ;
backs and regain the ball on downs but
this was not often, and the loss of the .
spheroid would follow so hard upon its |
possession that nothing but complete
failure remained for Palo Alto's cubs.
In the second half the play opened with j
a series of punting interchanges and j
some rare fumbling on the part of Car- j
son, who was supposed to be a fort in
the back field for the cardinal. After the 1
spasm of kicking subsided Smith broke
out of the bunch at the center of the
field and was not downed until he reached j
the thirty-yard line. Then the line buck- j
ing began anew, and the third touch- 1
down was scored, but no goal was V
kicked. Score: 15-0: !
All this time the Stanford men played
without ginger and without snap. There
was some few minutes left, and it was a
mere matter of drawing equations with
time on one side and touchdowns on the
other so far as California was concerned. I
Three times the blue and gold tried for |
a goal after touchdowns and missed, so
they tried the fourth, and made it, but
by the merest accident. The ball struck
the goal post and sidled over the cross j
bar. Then the 3000 people seemed satis
fied and yelled some moreâ those adorned
in red to* drown the terrific din of their
rivals with chrysanthemums and violets.
The score board read 21â0, and received
no additions during the rest of the game. :
The men who distinguished themselves
In the football battle yesterday belong
with but one exception to the blue and [
gold team. First Smith would dash
through the pack and then Lippman for
steady gains of appreciable distances.
More the fullback of the California
eleven, punted in splendid shape. Womble
and Hill on the ends were down on every
kick and generally toppled over the
Stanford man in his tracks. But it was
not the individual playing of the Califor
nia men that won the game it was the
principles instilled by the coach; Coch ran,
concentration of effort and a general as
sistance to the runner.

THE SAN ITKAIN CISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1893.
ALL TROOPS
WILL SOON BE
ON THEIR WAY
Zealandia Will Sail for
Manila To-Day.
PENNSYLVANIA ON THURSDAY
GEN. MILLER WILL REMAIN BE
HIND UNTIL THE LAST.
Two Tennessee Privates Get Twelve
Months at Alcatraz and a Dis
honorable Discharge for
Desertion.
The final assignment of the remaining
expeditionary forces has been made. To
, day week will have seen the departure
i of the last of the troops that have for six
months been encamped here. The New
: port, Pennsylvania, Zealandla and City
of Pueblo are the transports that will
sail this week, and these four vessels will
1 be sufficient to carry all of the troops.
i The Zealandia will sail this afternoon
I with companies A, B, C, E, F. L. and M
!of the First Tennessee Regiment. On the
' vessel will go Colonel Smith and. his head
quarters with live hospital stewards,
; making in all 590 men that will sail on
: this transport. â¢
The Pennsylvania will take the entire
Fifty-first lowa Regiment and will sail
on Thursday if nothing should happen to
prevent. The Newport is ready to go
now, but will wait for General filler, who
desires to get all the troops off before he
leaves. No orders are out for this vessel,
but she will carry the remaining battalion
of the Kansas Regiment, the Wyoming
Light Battery and the remainder of the
California Heavy Artillery. This will only
leave the five companies of the Tennessee
Regiment and the Nevada Cavalry, and
these organizations will go on the City
of Pueblo. The Pueblo was inspected on
Friday by Major Moseley and Captains
Thompson and Raymond, and was ac
cepted. She will be in shape and ready
by the last of the week to sail, and in all
probability will accompany the Newport.
The transports sent out during the last
month have been the best equipped for
the comfort and health of the nen of any
that have gone to Manila, Each soldier
has a Turner bunk, which gives a man an
aisle on both sides and does not necessi
tate his crawling over other men, which
was the case with some of the first trans
ports. Many other conveniences have been
put in the vessels for the men. This has
been done at the urgent demand of the
Board of Inspection. Major Moseley and
Captains Thompson and Raymond com
pose this board.
General Merriam stated yesterday that
as soon as the troops had got away the
business of the department would once
more be on a routine basis, with this ex
ceptionâthe effairs of the departments of
Hawaii and the Philippines would have
to be administered from here. San Fran
cisco will become the point of communi
cation betweeen Washington and these
departments, and the shipping point of
troops and supplies, which will mean
much to this city. General Merriam
could not say how long the volunteer
troops would be kept over in Manila. It
is very probable that as soon as all the

Mrs. Cordelia Botkln, whose name now

of extradition, issued by Governor Budd,
was concerned; but ordered her Into cus
tody on a bench -warrant issued under au
thority of tbe indictment. The prisoner
wfes then arraigned, and after her plea
had been entered George A. Knight asked
that further proceedings be postponed
until next Saturday. On that date the
cane will be set for trial. In the mean
time the Delaware witnesses will be sum

At the conclusion of the proceedings
Mrs. Botkin was taken to the City Prison

taken to Branch County Jail No. 3, where
she will remain until the beginning of the

WELLS-FARGO
MUST PAY
MORE DAMAGES
New Suits Against the
Company.
SHIRKED ITS WAR TAXES
PATRONS WOULD NOT AFFIX
THE STAMPS.
In Each Case $50 Damages Are
Asked and Suits Galore
Are Expected to r ,
Follow.
The shirking of its war stamp tax by
Wells, Fargo & Co. may soon prove to
be an expensive proceeding, Judging from
the developments in the Justices' Courts
Saturday. Two more suits were filed
against the express company by Indig
nant citizens, who had vainly offered to
the San Francisco office of the company
certain parcels of merchandise, with the
money for the express charges, but with
out the extra one cent in each case for
the war stamp.
The complaints were both filed by the
law firm of McGowan & Squires, the
plaintiffs being H. B. Benham and B.
Johnson, both residents of this city. In
each case damages amounting to $50 are
asked.
Benham states In his petition that on
September 22 he offered a parcel of mer
chandise to the company for transporta
tion to Santa Barbara, at the same time
tendering the regulation charge of 30
cents. The agent of the company refused
to receive the package. The shipper was,
therefore, put to great inconvenience and
was obliged to send his package by an
other carrier, involving delay and trouble.
In view of the fact that Wells, Fargo &
Co. Is a common carrier, he considers
that its refusal to take his express mat
ter Is worth $50 to him, and he prays
the court so to decide.
Johnson's complaint Is similar, except
that his package was destined for Oak
land, and he tendered the price for trans
portationâ2s centsâ which was refused.
This happened on September 12. He also
considers the refusal of Wells, Fargo &
Co. to handle his consignment to be
worth $50.
It Is quite evident that the practice of
the express company in avoiding Its just
tax Is going to be the means of enrich
ing all of the citizens of San Francisco
who care to take the trouble to offer a
parcel to the agent of the Wells-Farog
concern, and after it is refused for lack
of the one cent for a stamp, recover
damages according to the established
precedent in the courts.

the dignity of the hustling Oakland man
ager to the surface, and he is declaring
that If they play Mertes that he will take
the league rules in his own hands. Mr.
Ewing stated la9t night that he will se
cure George Van Haltren of the New

and will have them in an Oakland uni

Mertes on his team.
The 6tockton manager claims that he
has as much right to play Eastern play

says that the executive committee do not
do their duty according to the roles or
they would not allow other clubs to play
ineligible men on their team. He em
phatically states that he will play Mertes,
as he is not going to lose any chance to
finish the season within the first three.

FROM ALAMEDA'S HOSTS
Standard-Bearer Gage Greeted by a Vast
Assemblage at the Oakland
Tabernacle.
The Glorious Principles of Republicanism Eloquently Re
cited in Distinction to the Fallacious Doctrines
of Popocratic Maguireism â A Rally
That Means Votes.
OAKLAND, Oct. 29.â The standard
bearers of the Republican party must
have been gratified with the display of
party loyalty made on the streets of
Oakland and at the Exposition building
to-night The demonstration proved the
liiit. aaing interest in the Republican
ticket as the election approaches. Dele
gations from nil parts of the county were
in line, aiul so generally is it recognized
that when the Republicans are out all
other parties may as well save their red
iir,- that the Independents postponed their
demonstration arranged for to-night till
next Monday evening.
The unanimity with which the many
Republican organizations responded to
the rail to march shows that although
there may be some local differences in the
party it is united on the State ticket I

and marclu-d for more than a mile
through streets lined with crowds on

On arriving at the Tabernacle the largo
buildirg was pack* d with an audience
that was evidently in hearty accord will
all the sentiments expressed from the
platform. _ .
A 11. Breed, chairman of the Repub
Hear. County Central Committee, called
the meeting to order and introduced Dr
i'ardee, who presided durin
jvenlng. Dr. Pardee briefly Btated
that it is evident that the Alameda Coun
ty people have not forgotten their alle
glance to the Republican party. He in
trouueed the Hon. Henry T. Gage as "th
man of destiny." At least live minute
-.-'. before the distinguished bp
of the evening whs given an opportuiiily
to utter a syllable.
"If 1 were to consult my own inclina
tion as to comfort, after the bttlguss of
this campaign," said the speaker,
would keep silent; but I would violate m
promise if 1 did not pay my respects t
this vast assemblage.
"The ardor and enthusiasm I witr.
on the streets and in the Tabernacle tc
night indicate that on the Bth day of No
rt the Republican party wl

witnessed in a quarter of a century.
"One of the reasons is that the poop!

have been consistent to this principle ever

"Oh. my countrymen, of course I am
the man the railroad wanted down this
way. Often have they sought to retain me
and to pay me a fee. but I have never
received one dollar from them for the
reason that I preferred to stand for and
by the people. But I have often made
them pay thousands, thousands, thou
sands for killing and wronging my fellow
man."
The speaker next pointed to the fallacy i
of the statement made by the Examiner, !
the exponent of the fusionists, that the
funding amendment is the sole issue, and |
the speaker carefully explained this ;
amendment, which in the halls of Con- I
grass had not been opposed by Maguire, i
which had been framed by a Democrat â :
John T. Morgan of Alabamaâ improved uy j
a Democrat and voted for by every Demo
cratlc and I'opulistio Senator as well as ;
by Republicans, and which cannot be
modified by the Legislature. The speaker
also touched upon that alleged remedy
of all evils, the single tax. In conclusion
he said: j
"Probably it is my duty to say a few
words relative to my position. If elected
Governor of this State I will give you an
administration that is just, honest, econ- ;
omic and business-like. I will not be :
dominated by any corporation influence
whatever.
"I will be guided by one idea and pur
pose, and that purpose, ho help me (jÂ«a,
will be effectual. I purpose to do that
which is just and fair and right by my
fellow-mar, with that right that God Al
mighty has given me." , Â«Â«â¢â  j-
The applause that followed Mr. Gage s
address was deafening, and after con- ,
siderable pause Dr. Pardee. introduced the :
H,,n Victor Metcalf. nominee for Con
rres from this district, who said in part:
"I have Just made a careful canvass of
this d ; !?trl<t and from all sources of infer- |
nation at hand 1 am able to say that
Henry T. Gage, our standard bearer, will
be elected by an overwhelming majority. |
I do not believe in vituperation. The par- |
ties are large enough not to resort to
personal slander."
He spoke in glowing terms of President j
McKiniey's administration and the patrl- |
otic manner in which the country is sup
porting him. and how the people in this
are a unit. He discussed briefly the sil
ver question, the protection of American !
industries, and the decrease of the public ;
debt under Republican administrations.
"The war -with Spain," said Mr. Metcalf,
"has demonstrated to the world that the I
people are a unit; that sectionalism no
longer exists; there is no longer a north,
south, east or west, but one grand, har
monious people. Every American should
highly prize his citizenship. 1 believe,
though, this priceless boon ought only to
be >< nferrefl upon the worthy. No ipr*
eigner should have it conferred until he
can read and write the English language
and understand our form of government. |
I believe in elevating the standard of citi
zenship, not degenerating It."
Mr Metcalf expressed himself in favor
of retaining all conquered territory; un
alterably opposed to the free coinage of I
silver at the ratio of 16 to 1: in favor of i
the strictest kind of an immigration law;
In favor of the Nicaragua canal, but i
owned and controlled by the Urrfted
States; in favor of harbor and river im
provements, and extending railroads the
same consideration as any private Indi
vidual.
Hon. E. F. Preston was the next and
last speaker. He said he had lived in I
the State forty-eight years, but had never
been accused of being a railroad man, yet
he once invested $2T>OO in a Salt Lake rail- !
road enterprise and that was $2.'>00 more |
than Maguire ever put up in his life
against railway monopoly. He referred
to the fusion party as the "three-tailed
monkey," without brains or sense, but !
an abnormally developed paw reaching ;
for the public treasury, and said there j
were men who speak of Jeffersonian De- j
mocracy who never read one of Jeffer. |
son's speeches or knew anything about |
the fundamental principles of govern
ment. He spoke of the evils of single j
tax, and how Magulre's success would ,
only further it. Of Maguire he said that
he need not open a kindergarten foj him
self. Gaare and Barnes, for "he can't t< ;i<h
D 8 politics, because we can never st;iy in
office sixteen years and straddle all the j
political principles that Maguire has. i
Maguire is to Stephen M. White what
Hyperion was to a satyr." He urged every
good Republican to vote for Metcalf for
Congressman and roll up the Republican
majority for Gage to such numbers that
single tux will be wiped out forever as an
issue in this State.
BARCLAY HENLEY IS A
DELINQUENT TAXPAYER
IS IN ARREARS FOR BOTH STATE
AND MUNICIPAL TAXES.
Arrearages Date Back to 1889 and
Suits Are Still Pending in
the Justices' Courts.
Barclay Henley, some time citizen of
Mexico and present Democratic candidate
for District Attorney, is, and has been
for nearly ten years, delinquent In the
payment of his taxes.
Mr. Henley takes the platform night af
ter night and dwells upon the unparalleled
honesty of Phelan's nominees. He howls,
stamps and gets purple in the face as he
recalls political corruption in times past,
but conveniently forgets that he has neg
lected to pay his pro rata toward the
support of the government of the coun
try in which he now claims citizenship.
Suits for unpaid taxes have been
brought against him time and again, but
in some mysterious manner, explained by
the initiated as the exercise of a "politi
cal pull," r.o judgment has ever been ren
dered, and they are still pending in the
Justices' courts.
The nrst on record Is 1889, against the
firm of Henley. Swift & Rigsby. The
firm paid everything except the State's
portion, which with the penalties, is
$11 30. In IMO the iirm paid no tax at all,
and Is charged with $58 35. In 1831 the
firm was changed to Henley & Swift; no
tux was paid, and $7 28 is owing. For the
year isi'l Mi. Henley owes $-5 44 for taxes
on furniture, library, watch and jewelry
In the house at 2131 Green street. In IS$3
he tiled a sworn statement that he had
$10,000 in credits and dues, $400 in money
and $165 in jewelry and furniture. His tax
was |Â£06 w, and the undecided
against him is No. 180,028 In the Justices"
court. On all these there is accumulat
ing an interest at 2 per pent per month.
The year 1533 finds him again delinquent
fur the sum of $44 78, and for the year 1597
the firm of Henley, Blgelow & Costello
owes $1 74.
All these items of Indebtedness are a
matter of record. Mr. Henley has been
notified in the regular way. and suit will
now be brought to recover wie entire
amount.
J. H. BARRY'S SUPPORTERS.
Hold a Poorly Attended Mass-Meet
ing in Metropolitan Hall.
Supporters of James H. Barry held a
mass meeting at Metropolitan Temple
last evening. Its conclusion was much
brighter than its opening, hut the big hall
could have seated hundreds more than
were present. When the hour for the
opening arrived the hall was practically
deserted. This was noticed by a geatle

man on the platform and advancing to
the front he put out his hand, shifted a
quid of tobacco or a wad of gum ana
announced that the vacant appearance or
the hall was owing to the fact that the
"fellows" were out watching the Crockers
and the HobartÃ in the street parade, but
all hands could find comfort in the
thought that Republican meetings were
probably suffering from the same cause.
A song was then announced and a quartet
extolled the virtues of all Democrats tO (
the tune of a forgotten "coon" song. Their
the speeches began. Frank Molly, H. Â»â¢
Jenner, Louis P. Ward, Samuel Mchee,
E. I. Woodman, Herman Gudstat and
William M. Hinton, in the order named,
addressed the meeting. All had the same
story to tell the story of the laborer s
suffering and the wrongs that had been
done him by the "green-eyed monster,
monopoly. The corporations were first
attacked, then the Republican candidates,
and lastly the "unimpeachable integrity
and honor" of all adherents of Democracy
was Impressed upon the audience.
James H. Barry finally made his ap
pearance. He was presented to the gath
ering and said: "Ladles and gentlemen
and fellow craftsmenâ l have spoken at
many meetings since the opening of this
campaign, some much larger than this,
but no audience ever filled me with more
pride than this before me. I am proud
to be here, proud after hearing all that
has been sala of me by men who know me
best. I feel unworthy of this most friend
ly demonstration, but it will only lead me
to strive for higher and nobler thoughts
and deeds. I am proud that I belong to
the ranks of labor and as such I -will go to
Congress." The speaker then, like those
that preceded him, opened up an attack
on the corporations and Republicans, ex
tolled the virtues of Phelan. Maguire and
himself, and continued on in this strain
until interrupted by a voice from the gal
lery with: "We'll elect the three Jim
mies." "Yes we will elect the three Jim
mies, Maguire, Phelan and Barry," an
swered the speaker, "and on November
8 we will give the corporations the jim
jams." This sally was followed by a
shout of approval and when it had died
away the Fpeaker continued for a few
minutes on the same line and retired.
It was announced that other speakers
were to address the audience, but at the
conclusion of Barry's speech all arose to
leave the hall and the meeting was or
dered adjourned.
IN THE THIRTY-SEVENTH.
Enthusiastic Republican Meeting of
the Electors of Hayes Valley.
The electors of Hayes Valley turned out
; in large numbers last night to listen to
J speeches by the candidates on the Repub
lican municipal ticket in Mowry Hall.
i The meeting was held under the auspices
: of the Thirty-seventh Assembly District
Republican Club, and the utmost enthusi

George A. Wenfworth of the Republican
campaign committee called the meeting

the chairman of the meeting. The chair
man stated that it was the duty of every
citizen who desired to uphold the national
administration tc> vote for the Republican

i dence in his possession to prove it.

Against a Would-Be Boss.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 29.â An Independent
Republican Club was organized last night
at Encinal Hall. Its members are en
tirely from what is known as the Bay
street section of the city. The leaders
; of the organization state that the excuse
I for Its existence arises from the claim
made by a local politician that he car
! ried Bay street around In his vest pocket.
i The club will support candidates "favor
! able to public improvements in Alameaa
In just proportion to the rest of the coun
ty and State." It is understood that It
i Is in opposition to George Lovegrove, an
independent candidate for Supervisor.
' The officers are: J. F. Mecklem, presi
dent- J. B. Tate, vice president; A. E.
Cumbers, secretary; William Hackins, Q.
\ 11. Fitch and A. B. Stiflalback, executive
committee.
Hayes Valley Republicans.
A very successful Republican meeting
was held in Mo wry "s Hall last night, the
people of Hayes Valley turning out In
such great numbers that It was neces
sary to hold an overflow meeting outside
the hall. The meeting was presided over
by George A. Wentworth, who introduced
Attorney General Fitzgerald, Henry X.
Clement and Judge Murphy as the speak
ers of the evening. Short addresses were
made by 1. J. Truman, Judge Charles F.
Low, John B. Carson. Thomas F. Gra
ham! Judge * Joachimsen, Thomas P.

Independent Political Alliance of Cali
fornia and the Latin-American Citizens'
Club will meet to-day at Pythian Castle
at 2 o'clock to arrange for the indorse-
I merit of candidates and the election of
j permanent officers.
Elect Good Judges.
The great importance to the moral
welfare of this community of able and
incorruptible Superior Judges demands
a close analysis of the character of can- .
didates. Before these Judges come â 
matters involving not only the rights of !
property and liberty and the claims of
litigants, but life and death in crimi
nal prosecutions. The qualifications of
candidates require a wide knowledge of '
civil and criminal jurisprudence, i
Among the various candidates Judge ;
Davis Louderback is an able jurist of
ample attainments and of sound judg
ment. He possesses executive and ju- ;
dicial ability, and would infuse more
life in the Superior Court bench, so that
the crowded calendars of civil cases in
some of the departments would be re
lieved and litigants obtain trials and
justice within reasonable time; and so
that in criminal cases murderers and
criminals would have justice meted out
to them without long delays. He is a
conscientious, painstaking, careful and
fearless Judge, that would put a stop
to the jury frauds and professional
jurymen. A change of Judges is re
quired for the public good, and a re
form in the administration of civil and
criminal justice is needed. Judge
Louderback's record, character and
professional and private life are a
guarantee that the dispensation of
equity and justice by him would be dis
tinguished by purity and impartiality
and free from corporation and political
influences. The other candidates on
the Republican judicial ticket for the
four Superior Court Judgeships are ex
cellent nominees. A vote for Judge
Louderback and the other nominees is
a vote for a pure and upright judiciary.
ATTEMPTED TO
BLACKLIST
JUDGE MOGAN
A "Scab" Poster That
Made Trouble.
CHARGED AGAINST PHELAN
THE ALLIED PRINTING TRADES
COUNCIL STEPS IN.
A Contemptible Advertising Scheme
Said to Have Been Backed
by the Mayor's Com
mittee.
For refusing to submit to the sand
bagging methods of the gang that caused
to be printed a large number of sheets
containing the photogravure pictures of
the local Democratic nominees, Police
Judge Mogan, who is a. candidate for re
election, has received the condemnation
of Phelan and his cohorts. So incensed
Is tne plug hat boss over Mogan's action
that he threatens to defeat him at the
polls.
About a week ago Mogan was ap
proached by a man, who, after explaining
that he had gained the consent of the
Democratic State Central Committee to
print the pictures of the men who were
nominated by Phelan and his celebrated
committee of one hundred, informed him
that it would be necessary for him to give
up $12 50 before his photograph would be
included in the bunch.
Mogan refused to be bled and so in
formed the stranger.
To the surprise of Mogan's friends the
sheets appeared a few days later, but his
photograph was not in the group. As
the gang asserted that tne posters had
been printed by order of the Democratic
State Central Committee several of Mo
gan's supporters waited on that body ana
demanded an explanation. While they
were discussing the matter word reached
them that the Allied Printing Council had
threatened to notify the Grand Jury and
have the publishers indicted for violating
section 10 of the purity of election laws
for falling to sttimp each poster with the
name of the firm that printed them. Evi
dently learning of the action of the
Trades Council the publishers yesterday
had several men vlsk the places where
the posters had oeen displayed and tear
them down. The only explanation given
for the action was that some mistake had
been made and that the publishers were
anxious to rectify it.
It is understood that new posters will
be printed Monday, and that the name
of the firm uoing the work will be
stamped on each one, so as not to clash
with the section of the purity of election
laws.
PHILIPPINE DEBT
WILL DELAY PEACE
PARIS, Oct. 29.â While the Spanish
and American Peace Commissioners
now stand upon the threshold of the
Philippine question, it seems probable
that the United States will take over
the entire archipelago.
In 1897 Spain issued, by royal decree,
bonds in the sum of $-40,000,000, tv which
were pledged the revenues of the Phil
ippines, and to which the Spanish na
tional guarantee was added. Prom
these $40,000,000 of obligations Spain
realized $36,000,000 in cash. These $40,
000.000 represent the Philippine debt,
which is entirely outside of the debt of
the $500,000,000 of the so-called Philip
pine and Spanish debt.
Should the United States absorb the
Philippines, none but officials yet know
whether they would assume a part or
all of this debt or more than the Phil
ippine debt. The Americans have de
clined to assume any of the Cuban debt
because Cuba is not theirs; biit in de
posing Spain in the Philippines the
Americans acquire the territory, and it
is believed there will be some financial
assumption by the United States. Some
well informed persons believe that
Premier Sagasta has determined to be
rid of the Philippines and would direct
his commission to sign a treaty by
which the United States should take
the islands and assume the $40,000,000 of
debt.
This proposition finds support in the
Parisian press, which to-day declares
that resistance is impossible and that
Spain should abandon the archipelago.
Spaniards now in Paris declare the
Philippines are a drag-, and assort that
Spain would lift a cry of Joy to be re
lieved of them if the terrific debt pres
sure should be thus lessened. On the
other hand Spaniards at home are
clamoring that their commission should
bolt the conference, and, in returning,
fulfill the highest duty.
In these contending currents the
Spanish Commissioners are awaiting
the American declaration on Monday,
and they declare they cannot sign a
treaty of peace involving the loss of the
Philippines to Spain. It is appreciated
by Spaniards and Americans alike that
should no treaty result here hostilities
will be continued, and both sides clearly
understand that in such event the
American fleet would immediately pos
sess the Philippines beyond question
and without money consideration to
opain. The Canaries would then be an
object of interest to the United States,
and possibly other Spanish possessions.

MORGAN'S BILL
IS SATISFACTORY
It Pleases the Maritime
Canal Company.
OPPOSED BY HUNTIN6TON
HE WILL SEEK TO DEFEAT ITS
PASSAGE.
Men to Whom Nicaragua Govern
ment Granted a Concession Are
Believed to Be Merely
Speculating.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Oct. 29.
It can be authoritatively stated that
the Nicaraguan canal bill reported by
Senator Morgan and now on the Sen
ate calendar substantially represents
the views of the Maritime Canal Com
pany upon all important points. The
Maritime Company will have no new
propositions to make to Congress at
the coming session, but will direct all
its efforts toward the passage of the
Morgan bill.
"While the sentiment in favor of
building the canal has been largely
augmented by events of the war the
representatives of Mr. ' Huntington of
the Southern Pacific are confidently
predicting that the Morgan bill will
never get through Congress. During
the past week it has been alleged here
that J. J. Hill of the Great Northern
Railway was co-operating with Mr.
Huntington in his opposition to the bill.
The Maritime Company's agents do not
believe Hill will become an ally of the
Huntington interests.
The informatioa from Nicaragua that
Edwin P. Cragin, Edward Eyre and
Frank S. Washburne will receive from
the Nicaraguan Government a conces
sion for a canal across that country
was no surprise to those in Washington
who are familiar with the affairs of the
Nicaraguan Canal Company. Mr. Cra
gin is a Chicago promoter, not an en
gineer, Mr. Eyre is from New York
and represents considerable capital and
Mr. \Vashburn, who also 1b from New-
York, is an engineer and contractor.
While nothing definite is known about
the amount of capital represented by
these men it is believed they are pre
pared to put up a stiff fight for the con
cession and if necessary could secure
enough backing to float bonds, and,
perhaps, to construct the canal. It is,
however, thought that they intend
rather to dispose of the concession
when it is obtained, either to the Marl
time Canal Company, which holds the
present concession, or to other parties
desirous of constructing the canal
rather than undertake the task them
selves.
The fact that under the terms of the
concession they are authorized to nego
tiate with the Maritime Canal Com
pany leads many to believe it rather a
speculation than a bona fide business
proposition. As affairs stand now the
concession held by the Maritime Canal
Company holds good until next October
and this company has done a great deal
of work in the way of surveying and
even in actual construction of the
canal.
The Maritime Canal Company is not
concerning itself about the concessions
made to the Atlas Company, fts rep
resentatives hold that concessions made
to this company in no way eonllict with
the canal concession. As this is the
ground taken by the Nicaraguan Gov
ernment the company thinks that
ought to be sufficient.
The bill introduced in Congress by
Senator Morgan provides that the
United States Government shall be
come the actual though not the visible
owner of the canal. It is proposed that
the Government shall put up the money
for the construction and retain a ma
jority of the stock and control the af
fairs of the corporation. It is believed
that by this method international com
plications could be avoided.
The Nicaraguan Canal Commission
has made a thorough survey of the
ground. It is now engaged on its re
port, which will be submitted in about
a month. There is no doubt this com
mission will represent that the build
ing of the canal is perfectly feasible
and there is no difficulty in the way
which cannot be surmounted.

INTERCOLLEGIATE GAMES
ON EASTERN GRIDIRONS
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 29.â The Car
lisle Indians scored their usual goal from
the field in the football game on Soldiers'
Field this afternoon, but Harvard won
through hard, clean and brilliant work,
by a score of 11 to 5, making the first
touchdown through poor headwork on the
part of the Indians and another in the
second half by beautiful runs by Dibblee.
The game was one of the best seen in
Cambridge this year, for the Indians
gave the Harvards the hard work that
they needed and showed up the weak
points in the crimson line in a manner
that was anything but assuring as to the
outcome of the pennant game next Sat
urday.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 29.â The Univer
sity of Chicago football eleven succeeded
this afternoon in crossing the University
of Pennsylvania's goal, the first time the
red and blue has been scored on this
season, the final score being University
of Pennsylvania 23, Chicago University
11. For the first ten minutes of play the
Chicago boys simply carried the Quakers
off their feet, and it looked as though
they were going to have a walkover, but
then Pennsylvania took a brace and
played something like their true form.
Chicago scored their first touchdown ten
minutes after play started.
WEST POINT, N. V., Oct. 29.â The
Yale-West Point football game here this
afternoon resulted in a score of 10 to 0
in favor of Yale. It was the best played
and most exciting contest witnessed here
this season. The West Pointers put up
a good fight, Yale having to work very
hard for tne points they scored. The mili
tary boys were in fine trim and went into
play a winning game, but by an unfor
tunate fluke, precisely eleven seconds be
fore the end of the first half McÃride
went over the line for a touchdown.
ITHACA, N. V., Oct. 29.â The Cornell
Varsity team was forced to play its hard
est at Percy Field to-day by a strong
eleven from Oberlin. The game ended
with a score of -6 to oin Cornell's favor.
PROVIDENCE, R. 1., Oct. 29.â Brown
was beaten by Princeton to-day by a
score of 23 to 0.
Brown was weak in her defensive plays
while Princeton was equally weak on the
offensive movements.

Native Son to a Charming
Native Daughter.
SALINAS, Oct. 29.â Miss Zoe Anna Web
ster, the eldest daughter of J. A. Webster,
and Charles B. McDougall, the Becond son

daughter and a charming- young lady. She
won the prize last Christmas as the most
popular lady in town.
The groom is one of the best known
young men in Monterey County, a well
known entertainer and a native son.
The church was crowded to the doors,
and. though very pretty at all times, was
made more so by the fact that no space,
nook or corner was left unadorned, while i
everywhere potted plants and palms were
profusely distributed.
The bridal procession was unique, 'xhe
UPhers â J. A. Webster, brother of the
bride, and W. Hawkinsâ met the bridal
party at the entrance to the church,
where the procession was formed, with
the ushers leading, followed by Miss Ethel
A. Webster, sister of the bride, and Miss
Elvira Montfort Seighold as bridesmaids,
In costumes of white organdie with pink
satin trimmings, each carrying a large
bouquet of pink carnations. Miss Caroline
Ayers of San Francisco followed alone as
maid of honor, costumed in pink organdie
trimmed with satin, and carrying a simi
lar bouquet. Then came the bride, lean
ing on her father's arm. She was cos
tumed in white satin organdie, bridal veil !
and orange blossoms, and carried a bou
quet of orange blossoms.
The party moved toward the chancel to
the strains of Mendelssohn's Wedding
March, upon reaching which they were
met by the groom and the best man, who
was his brother, E. J. McDougall, and tne
clergyman.
The pretty wedding service of the Epis
copal church was then read.
A wedding breakfast was partaken of
at the home of the bride's parents, after
which the newly married couple left for
San Francisco and other cities on their
honeymoon.

READY COOKED FOOD.
A Great Convenience for House-
keepers.
It Is a known fact that many people
fail to properly digest the starchy part
of bread and other food. Grape-Nuts
(a delightful breakfast food) are made
of the grape-sugar which results from
preparing the starchy parts of the ce-
reals, in the same way artificially as
the body should do by natural pro-
cesses. Therefore Grape-Nuts furnish
food all ready for immediate assimila-
tion into blood and tissue. They are
made by the Postum Co., at Battle
Creek, Mich., and are ready prepared,
require no cooking whatever and will
be found most valuable by athlete,
brain worker or invalid.

HOSTS PARADE TO CELEBRATE
REPAVING OF MARKET STREET
Wheelmen and Horsemen Unite on Common Cround in a Great Demon
stration Over the Success of the Long Continued Agitation
for the Betterment of the City's Pavements.
THE cycling fraternity and the horse
men met on common ground last
night to give expression to their joy
that the city's main artery of travel
has a modern pavement for at least a
portion of its broad surface.
The parade as a spectacular affair was a
failure, owing to the inability of the police
to handle the throng of people who camÂ©
from far and near. As a demonstration
showing the interest of the people at large
jn the important matter of good streets,
it was a success far beyond the anticipa
tions of its promoters. The efforts of the
Imen were seconded by the horse
men, represented by those who use horses
both for pleasure and for utility. The
highest development in each class was
sh.iwn by Walter Morosco's coach, drawn
;ht black horses, and by some of the
Lid draylng teams of sturdy Clydes
dales.
Mayor Phelan. as Chief Executive of
the city, held the place of honor at the
head of the procession. He was accom
panied by Colonel W. P. Sullivan.
Charles L. Fatten was the gue=t of
honor on Walter Movosco'S coach, which
was filled with the owner's friends.

tary James M. Hamilton of the Cycle
Board of Trade and rode in an open
barouche.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen swept all
before them in the magnificence of their
display. Eighty members paraded under
Captain W. L. Loos. They were all
mounted on white wheels, and wore the
well-known flying "O" on their white
Jersey shirts. To add to the beauty of
their display they had two floats, de
signed by A. B. Corbett. The most am
bitious of these was Eureka, the coat of
arms of California. California was im
personated by a little child. Miss Viola
Blesser. She was clothed in the well
known gown affected by the lady on the
great seal of the State. The tableau was
mounted on two bicycles ridden by
George Kroetz and H. D. Bean. The su
perstructure or canopy was all a-glitter
with gold and tinsel.
The foundation for the second float was
a triplet bicycle, ridden by J. E. Wing,
Eddie Kragness and E. A. Bozio, a trio
of great riders. A shell-shaped canopy
covered with red.white and blue bunting
was over the riders. At each corner of
the huge affair a rider clad in white was
mounted. The club was awarded three

TWO REMARKABLE CURES.
Two Happy Men Testify to the Grand Results Received From Dr.
Sanden's Electric Belt.
There is nothing so penetrating, nothing 90 invigorating, nothing that will relieve
weakness and pain so speedily and surely as Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt It is simple, but
grand. It assists nature by a general re-enforcement of the. vital energy, by infusing a mild
invigorating current of Electricity into the nerves and by supplying the system with the very
essence of nerve vigor and nerve strength. Â«n?TTrPTRTPTTV T^ TTITF"
The greatest men in the world of medicine and science say "ELECTRICITY IS Lit
It is the strength, the vigor, and, in fact, the very life in the body and Dr. bandens success in
making use of its life-giving power proves, its merit. With his Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt be

debility, wasting weakness-men who had been able to get no benefit from drugs Many of
these cases were pronounced incurable by doctors who had failed to cure them But they have
been cured, and they stand ready to testify to it. There must be merit in a system of treatment
that can show such cures as these.

Thomas Cronin Mehrin and Captain W.

They were assisted by Leader John A.
Hammersmith, President J. W. Mullen,
and had the co-operation of the members
at large.
The Acme Club Wheelmen of Oakland,
under Captain Agnew, and the Kncmal
Cyclers, Captain M. C. Curtis, were the
principal out-of-town clubs represented.
The Enclnals were ail dressed alike, and
presented a uniform appearance, 'me
Acmes had a float with a little girl as the
central figure.
The California Cycling Club, under the
captaincy of R. A. Coulter, assisted by
Lieutenant Birdsall and Thomas White,
had forty men in line. The San Francisco
Road Club and the Imperials also helped
to swell the ranks of organized wheel
men.
There were many novelties In the cyc

small space to which they were restricted.
Among these features was a troop oi

practiced a number of fancy evolutions,

One wheelman was disguised as an un

Mrs. and Miss Anthony made a pleasing
appearance in fancy bicycle costumes of
pure white, set off with trimmings of
gold. Stanley C. Scovern and wife made
a hit as Columbia and Uncle Sam. Their
tandem was elaborately decorated by a
canopy of national colors fringed with
lanterns.
The Golden Gate Park Driving Club
members made a strong display with
their pneumatic-tired buggies and well
groomed horses. There were up-to-date
coaches and those of the olden time. The
display of delivery wagons was a large
and a representative one.
Some of the loaded truck?, notably that
of the Tubbs Cordage Company, were of
the highest class. There were vaqueros
and ladies among those on horseback.
DR A T. SANDENâ Dear Sir: It is nearly three months since I commenced the use of your Belt and am no-

Rheumatism which had settled in both my arms. The Belt has worked perfectly and I have felt the current good

First Infantry has been set for Monday;
on Tuesday next there will be an exam
ination at San Rafael of those who want
to join Company D of the Fifth Infantry,
and on Wednesday those anxious to be
come members of Company X of the First
Infantry will be examined at the Ellis
street armory.
Lester C. Burnett, recently elected lieu
tenant of Troop A, has passed a success
ful examination as to competency to dis
charge the duties of the position.
Colonel T. M. Cluff, assistant adjutant
general on the division staff, has re
turned from his trip East and has re
ported for duty.
Captain L. H. Turner, commanding the
Naval Militia, has recovered from his re
cent illness and is again at his post.
Last Tuesday night sixty men of the
Naval Militia, reported at the Marion for
drill, and while there was a good showing
of men there was a dearth of officersâ
that is, commissioned officers â to drill
them. It being a fine clear night and there
beir.g plenty of moonlight, the men vÂ»re
assigned to boat drill, three boats being
taken out. One was under command of
Lieutenant Dennis, the other under com
mand of Lieutenant W. E. Elliott, an<l
the third was hi charge of Coxswain Don
nellan. The men were out for nearly :wo
hours, and went as far as Goat Island.
On the way they rounded the United
Slates ships Philadelphia and Wheeling
and were hailed from each ship. The nii.-n
displayed considerable familiarity with
the duties required of them. Among the
duties they were required to perform was
the making of landings. They made three
of them, and were complimented /or the
successful manner in which they did their
work.
The board recently appointed to investi
gate and report upon the loss of certain
property belonging to the State and in
charge of the Naval Militia, has com
menced its labors. Each division com
mander has been directed to make a per
sonal examination of the property of the
division and report the result of such ex
amination without delay, and they were
further directed to have all the property
in such condition that it may be inspected
at a moment's notice by the members of
the board or some one of the board. The
board will in its report locate the respon
sibility on those who are accountable for
the loss of the property.
During the approaching session of the
next Legislature the Committee on ivilli
tary Affairs will fcave a number of new
matters to consider. An effort will be
made to have it recommend the passage
of a law that will do away with the fre
quent elections held in the companies of
the guard. It is proposed that after the
first election the only commissioned officer
to be elected shall be the second lieuten
ant, so that in case of a vacancy in the
upper grades those in the lower ones wul
be In line for promotion. That Is, if the
captain retires, is removed or dies, tne
first lieutenant will become captain, the
second lieutenant first; the vacancy in the
second lieutenancy to be filled by elec
tion, the officer to hold during good be
havior and competency and to be retired
for age as is done in the regular army.
This, it is thought, will do away with
a great deal of sectional feeling in tne
companies and give officers who will oe
able to enforce discipline much better
than in the past.
It is also proposed to have the laws af
fecting the guard codified, do away with
the regulations as now laid down, and In
lieu thereof substitute the United States
army regulations, so far as applicable.
Another matter that will be urged will
be the erection of armories to be owned
by the State.
The 1900 Club will move into their per
manent quarters in the Y. M. C. A.
building, corner of Mason and Ellis
streets, room 2. third floor, on November
1. After that date the clubrooms will be
open for the use of members at all hours
of the day, Ttith an attendant in charge.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1898.
MUST FIGHT FOR ITS LITTLE
PENNIES.
Despite Numerous Semi-Virtuous Concessions Wells,
Fargo & Company Must Show Cause Belore the
Supreme Court of This State Why It Should
Not Pay the War Tax.
Attorney General Fitzgerald yesterday
filed with the Supreme Court his petition
for an alternative writ of mandate ope
rating against Wells, Fargo & Co. It is
by this means that the State of Califor
nia will seek to rid its sovereign people
of the burden of a grasping corporation's
taxes and convince President John J. Val
entine that the laws of the land are not
to be differentiated that he may further
squeeze the people who have made his
company and his own rotund salary prof
itable possibilities.
There is a bright, shining possibility
that Mr. Fitzgerald's petition is too
late for its object. It has developed in the
past few days that Mr. Valentine and b,is
company have made concessions and that
to some of their littie receipts they are
attaching and paying for their own reve
nue stamps. True the patrons who have
been so far honored are the very largest
and most profitable shippers that appear
on the company's books, and the suspi
cion may arise that the Valentine magna
nimity is induced by the coercive influ
ence of threatened withdrawals of big
blocks of trade. However, the fact re
mains that the company is actually pay
ing for some of Its stamps, not only in
this city, but in Sacramento and in the
other towns where there are shippers of
enough importance to the corporate purse
to tell Mr. Valentine to put up or go
without. Mr. Valentine is putting up,
and the fact will argue to his benefit un
til he proves that his sudden accession of
virtue is nothing more than discrimina
tion against those who do need it for the
benefit of those who do not.
I'nsuspected virtue to the contrary. At
torney General Fitzgerald is going right
along with his fight for principal and pub
lic rights. It was hi? original intention
to make his application for a writ of man
date before the Superior Court. The
decision of Justice of the Peace Barry
and of Superior Judge Troutt in the
Costley case, however, interfered with
that. Though the Superior Court declared
that the corporation should buy its
stamps and pay damages to William
Costley as well, Mr. Valentine considered
that the last behest only was incumbent
upon him. He acknowledged the decis
ion's justice In so far that he forwarded
MILLIONS IN A STRONG BOX.
Personal Property of the Estate of
Charles F. Crocker Deposited.
An order was made yesterday by Judge
Coffey directing Henry T. Scott and
Charles E. Green, guardians of the ps
tates of Mary, Charles Templeton and
Jennie Adeline Crocker, children and
heirs of the late Charles F. Crocker, to
deposit all personal property belonging
to the estates of their wards in the vaults
of the Crocker- Woolworth National Bank.
This was done in order to obviate the
necessity of the guardians securing bonds
sufficient to cover the great value of the
property, and was made under the pro
visions of the code.
The property was all placed in a strong
box and carried into court, sealed and
delivered to G. W. Kline, cashier of the
Crocker-Woolworth Bank. Following is
a list of the property which has passed
from the hands of the guardians into
the vaults of the bank under the order
of court:

A GRAYBACKED WHALE
CAUSES EXCITEMENT
A BIG grayback whale caused considerable excitement in the bay yes
terday. When first seen the leviathan was off Goat Island, but he
soon changed his quarters and got right in the fairway. The pas
sengers on the ferry steamer Piedmont got a splendid view of the mammal,
as it spurted a few hundred feet from the steamer.
Whales are not uncommon in the harbor, and sometimes two and
three of them are to be seen off Alcatraz feeding. They generally follow
the sardines into port and go out with the tide. It is something unusual to
see one south of the ferry, and the Piedmont's passengers were treated to
that sight yesterday.
1 a check to Costley, but he bought no
stamps.
The Attorney General figured that one
Superior Court decision would receive no
more attention than another, and decided
to appeal for relief to the Supreme Court
of the State. This he did yesterday, and
in his cause of action avers that the com
pany is and always has been since Its
incorporation under the laws of the State
of Colorado, in the business of car
rying and transporting packages as a
general express business.
That since the first day of July, IS9B,
it has been the duty of the defendant to
affix, and cancel at its own cost, to all of
Kb receipts a revenue stamp of the value
of 1 cent, as provided by an act of Con
gress entitled "An act to provide ways
and means to meet war expenditures, and
for other purposes." That on October 19
he tendered to the company a package
for transportation to the State Board of
Examiners at Sacramento and at the
same time offered the usual rate of 25
cents but that a demand was made upon
him for an additional cent to pay for the
stamp, which plaintiff alleges he was not
required by law to pay, and that upon his
refusal to pay the 1 cent his package was
refused by the company's agent.
In his statement of cause the plaintiff
also alleges in a general charge that the
company in disregarding the tax law is
dishonoring its franchise. On this point
the complaint says:
Affiant believes upon information and al
leges, that defendant is violating its franchises
and Us duty to the public and is unlawfully de
niiiivltng of all personw who transact any ex
press business with defendant within this State
the payment of the internal revenue tax which
by virtue of the provisions of, the act of Con
gress aforesaid it is the duty of defendant it
self to pay. and unlawfully and oppressively
forces and compels all of such persons to pay
said tax by unlawfully refusing to receive for
transportation any goods so offered to it for
transportation and shipment unless, In addi
tion to Its regular charges, the persons so offer
ing goodÃ pay to defendant a sum sufficient to
cover the cost to defendant of purchasing and
procuring the Internal revenue stamps, or un
less such iiersons themselves furnish said
â tamps; that by reason of its unlawful and
coerciva acts defendant is evading and escap
ing Its Just share of the burden of the internal
revenue tÂ»jX and is unlawfully â violating its
franchise and failing to properly perform â¢ the
<luti.Â»s imposed upon it by law, and is co
erclvely and without any rirht violating its
duty to the people of this State by imposing
the unlawful and onerous burden of paying its
joint and rightful share of the internal revenue
tax upon the general public.

RUPERT MANUEL
DIES IN THE

Left His Property to
Mrs. Head.
HE WAS IN THE FIGEL CASE
EXPIRED WHILE "ERVING SEN
TENCE FOR CONTEMPT.
Gratitude of the Octogenarian for
Kind Treatment Received
Substantially Ex
pressed.
Rupert Manuel, S3 years old, died In the
County Jail shortly before 1 o'clock yes
terday afternoon. He had been attended
by City Physician Hereford for a com
plication of diseases.
Manuel was formerly In the service of
Eugene Deuprey, his duty being to serve
papers for Mr. Beuprey's law office. He
came Into prominence In the Figel-Hoff
man murder trial. On October 14 of this
year he was committed for contempt by
Superior Judge Troutt, his sentence being
for five days. The contempt consisted In
his refusal to deliver certain papers in
the case of the estate of his deceased
wife. He was again taken from the
courtroom to the County Jail last Thura-
day.
On Friday night he wrote a statemen.
In lead pencil, purporting to be his last
will and testament in the guise of a let
ter addressed to Mrs. Bertha Head, wife
of School Director E. L. Head. The let
ter is written in a remarkably firm hand
for an octogenarian on the point or
death. He requests Mrs. Head to have
him cremated, and leaves her all his
property, consisting of $400 of his own
money and $1000 belonging to the estate
of his dead wife, together with his real
estate the value of which is not stated.
Mike H. Smith is made trustee for her
for $3000 or thereabouts on his bank ac
count. He also bequeaths to Mrs. Head
$60 cash In his pocket.
In his statement he says that he makes
the bequest to Mrs. Head out of grati
tude, because she was kind to him when
he made her house his home.
ASSESSOR SIEBE
AND CORPORATIONS
RECORDS OF HIS OFFICE DIS
PROVE FAVORITISM.
His Opponents Allege Facts That
Official Records Disprove
Absolutely.
After a man has served as a public
official as long as honest John D. Siebe
has, and then has so little said against
him regarding the administration of
his office as can be said against this
gentleman, it argues well for his fit
ness for the place and it suggests many
reasons why voters should and will
vote for his re-election.
Distorting figures and misstating
facts in an endeavor to weaken an op
ponent usually acts as a boomerang,
and such will prove the case in Mr.
Siebe's campaign when his opponent re
sorts to such practices.
In recent addresses to voters the
Democratic nominee has taken advan
tage of the opportunity to make a num
ber of misstatements relative to Mr.
Siebe's assessments, particularly those
of corporations, and has made asser
tions of alleged facts that are not
borne out by the records.
Mr. Siebe's opponent has recently, on
various occasions, at public meetings
asserted that the Republican nominee
had shown favoritism in the assessment
of corporations, and gave alleged spe
cific figures to substantiate his claims.
He called particular attention to fig
ures of assessments made by Assessor
Badlam in 1876, as against those of As
sessor Siebe, especial consideration be
ing given to the personal property as
sessments of the Spring Valley Water
Company and the San Francisco Gas
Company. The Democratic nominee
endeavored to make it appear that Mr.
Slebe has assessed these two corpora
tions for a less amount than they were
assessed in 1876 by Mr. Badlam.
The records show that in 1876 the
Spring Valley Water Company's per
sonal property assessment, including
franchise, was $2,322,170, while for 1898
the assessment made by Mr. Siebe was
$3,589,857.
The personal property assessment of
the San Francisco Gas Company in 1876,
including franchise, was $1,403,900,
while Mr. Siebe assessed this same
company for personal property in 1898
$2,521,168.
Personal property assessments
reached a maximum of $101,000,000 in
1874. They declined in 1876 to $71,000 -
000, and in 1879 to $51,000,000. The last
two were during Mr. Badlam's incum
bency and show a decrease In personal
property assessments of $20,000,000 in
three years of his incumbency, and a
decrease of $50,000,000 between 1874 and
1879.
It is a fact â one regretted by all, but
nevertheless trueâ that many business
interests in San Francisco have depre
ciated in value of late years, hence the
decline In amount of personal property
assessments. Yet during Mr. Siebe's
incumbency he has increased the as
sessments of banks and corporations
nearly $12,000,000, while the total in
crease in all personal property assess
ments has been but a little over $2,000,
000.
These figures are all a matter of re
cord, and can be verified at any timÂ«
by an inspection of the records of the
Assessor's office.
That Mr. Slebe has done his duty
justly and honestly b- rich and poor
alike no one can deny who will take
the pains to investigate. For his op
ponent to state alleged facts from a
platform or in any other manner, when
the records disprove such assertions,
demonstrates how hopeless is the task
of defeating honest John Siebe, the
true and tried public official. Mr.
Siebe has demonstrated that he is a
man who cannot and will not betray
the trust and confidence of the people,
and the public approval of his admin*
istration of the Assessor's office will be
shown in the rousing majority by
which he will be re-elected Novem
ber 8.

A Society Woman and Her
Watch Suggest a Pertinent ;
I Physical Parallel.
!
A lady went to a famous New York
watchmaker the other day and said her
watch had broken down. The watch
maker opened the watch, adjusted his
eye-glass and carefully examined the
works. He smiled as he shut the case,
wound the watch, Bet it, and handed it
back to its owner.
"Why, what was wrong?" she asked.
"What did you do?" as with the watch
at her ear she listened in pleased sur-
prise to its regular beat. "It was, just
run down, and I wound it ,up, that was
"answered, the watchmaker. -
There is all the difference in the
world between being broken down and
-
RUN DOWN OR BROKEN DOWN. .
run down. But it usually takes the
skill of the specialist to determine the
difference.
There are thousands of women, Just
in the condition of that watch. They
are all run down, but they make the
mistake of thinking that they are bro-
ken down, and their condition is often
aggravated by their fears. It often
happens, however, that the complex
symptoms of feminine diseases appear
in the patient's judgment Just as criti-
cal as the stopped watch. It is simply
a "run down" condition and this run
down condition in woman means that
the vital forces are about exhausted.
The woman, unable to care for the fam-
ily or attend to her household duties, is
as incapable of play as she is of work,
is in constant pain, and feels that life is
about to end, and that she is completely
broken down. Many thousands of just
such women have come to Dr. R. V.
Pierce chief consulting physician of the
Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute,
Buffalo, N. Y. Dr. Pierce is a specialist
in the diseases of women, and his more
than thirty years' experience has en-
abled him to say to many a suffering
woman: "You are not broken down.
You are just run down. Your whole
life will run on again in its divinely
appointed way, when the main spring
which dominates it is once more regu-
lated and enabled to exercise its in-
herent and proper function."
The sufferings borne by women in
which men have no part or lot, and of
the pains and pangs of which they are
ignorant, are chiefly related to those
organs which are distinctively feminine.
Thus the "run-down" condition of
woman can oft-times be traced to the
irregular periods which beginning in
maidenhood culminate in the unpleas-
ant and debilitating drains of wifehood.
Then come the strain and drain of fre-
quently repeated motherhood, and with
it ulcerations, inflammations, displace-
ments of internal organs and bearing
down pains. The nerve force has al-
most entirely departed. There is no
more conjugal happiness and no more
courage to face the obligations of ma-
ternity. The desponding mind of the
prospective mother keeps a fearful
watch on the dial which marks off the
months and the days. She shrinks from
her coming anguish. The little life knit
up with hers is already being blighted
by her nervousness and gloomy fore-
bodings and surely handicapped in the
race of life. This condition has been
met in a wonderful way by Dr. Pierces
Favorite Prescription. It quickly allays
inflammations, cures ulcerations, and
builds up the nerve centers. The wife
instead of nervously pacing the house
wringing her hands in dread of the ap-
proaching day of pa^n, now sits and
sewa in happy preparation, her fingers
sometimes falling idly to her lap, as
she drifts into smiling reverie, and al-
ready imagines the tug of the tiny
fingers and the pressure of the tender
lips upon her bosom, swelling with
motherly pride and happiness.
Such a transformation seems wonder-
ful. It is wonderful. Yet It is as true
as it is wonderful. A half million of
women have testified to these facts;
women who have been freed from pain
and suffering and been restored to the
full measure of enjoyment which be-
longs to the happy duties of wife and
mother. Some few of these women tell
their story in the following testimo-
nials:
"I thank God for such remedies as
your 'Favorite Prescription' and 'Gold-
en Medical Discovery,' for myself and
friends honestly believe that had it not
been for these wonderful medicines I
would to-day be in my grave," writes
Miss Laura Brooks of Clinch, Hancock
County, Term. "1 am sure that I could
not have lived many days in the condi-
tion I was in at the time I first con-
sulted you. I was only praying to die
and be free from pain. I was simply a
shadow and we had tried almost every-
thing, when, through a friend, I was
advised to write to you, which I did,
thinking all the while that it was only
foolishness to think that such a case as
mine could be cured. But I do not
think so to-day. After the first week's
treatment just as you prescribed, I felt
like another woman and I hardly be-
lieved that such could be when the first
period was passed without pain. I con-
tinued the treatment until I had used
about servren bottles of the 'Favorite
Prescription' and some of the 'Discov-
ery,' and now I am a well woman. I
would have given any amount if I had
hid it just for the rest it has already
given me â rest from pain. I never
know when the periods are coming on
now, as I am free from pain, and dur-
ing the time I feel Just as well as at
any time, and am never confined to
my room as I once was. I can eat any-
thing I want and can work at any kind
of work. Everybody who knows me
thinks it wonderful that I am not sick
any more. I thank God for this friend
of women this blessed 'Favorite Pre-
DR. PIERCES REMEDIES
scription.' I can never tell you how I
medicine that saved me from suffering,
thank you, dear doctor, for your kind
advice and for your kind, good, fatherly
letters to me."
"Whai a difference in the suffering at
time of childbirth when Dr. R. V.
Pierces medicines are used," writes
Mrs. Edmon Jacobs of Bargersville,
Johnson County, Ind. "1 had not heard
of Dr. Pierces medicine three years
ago, when I was expecting to be con-
fined, so had to suffer almost death. Be-
fore baby was born I could not be on
my feet without two persons holding
me. The baby was a boy weighing
nine and three-quarter pounds, and for
some weeks after his birth I suffered
severe pain. Following the advice of a
neighbor last fall my husband bought
me two bottles of Dr. Pierces Pleasant
Pellets and one bottle of his 'Favoritt
Prescription,' which I took durlnut tbÂ»
winter, and in March, 1898, I gave Dirm
to a baby boy weighing ten and three-
i quarter pounds. I was only in labor
two hours and was on my feet without
I help until thirty minutes before my
I baby was born. He is now threÂ«
months old and weighs nineteen
pounds. I know it was Dr. Pierces
I advise all women to take Dr. Pierces
Favorite Prescription, also his 'Pleas-
ant Pellets,' if necessary. I would not
be without them."
What a change from darkness to day-
light these histories tell! All this
change occurred in the privacy of thÂ»
home, without indelicate questionings,
offensive examinations and disagree-
able local treatments so obnoxious to
modest-minded women. If afflicted you
are cordially and courteously invited to
write to D~. Pierce and tell him your
condition. There is no charge for this
consultation by letter. You get a spec-
ialist's advice absolutely free. Every
letter is treated as pri-ate communica-
tion between physician and patient, and
every statement is held in the most
sacred confidence. Write without fear
as without fee.
Remember that Dr. Pierce is a gradu-
ated physician, whose reputation standi
side by side with his thirty years' ex-
perience. It is well to keep this in mind,
because people are often invited to
write to "doctors" who are doctors in
name only, having no right to the pro-
fessional title. The feelings of women
are often played upon, also, by
those who- Invite them to "write to a
woman and secure a woman's sympa-
thetic advice." What a "run-down"
woman needs is sound medical advice
and not mere sisterly sympathy. There
is not, so far as we know, any gradu-
ated woman physician connected with
any proprietary medicine. There is
certainly no woman in any such posi-
tion who, like' Dr. Pierce, has given
thirty years of active practice to the
treatment of female disorders, thUB af-
fording women the practical sympathy
of real help and sound healing.
Every invalid woman should know
that Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription
contains no alcohol, whisky or other in-
toxicant. It is also free from opium
and narcotics, and contains neither su-
gar nor syrup. Without any of these
it preserves its remedial valuÂ© indefi-
nitely in any climate.
Medicine dealers, everywhere, sell Dr.
Pierces Favorite Prescription. See that
you get the genuine. The imitations
imitate the appearance only. They can-
not imitate its thirty years' record of
cures. Look the dishonest dealer
straight in the eye and ask him if his
imitation substitute which he is trying:
to foist upon you has a thirty years'
record of cures behind It. Insist upon
having a remedy with a record.
The best book for any woman, slngla
or married, in the spring of life or in its
summer or autumn, Is Dr. R. V. Pierce'a
great work on physiology and hygiene,
"The People's Common Sense Medical
Adviser." It is medical science freed

story of life, told in strong and simple
language. It appeals to young and old
alike. It appeals to the heart as well as
to the mind and to the soul which is
over all. It is the plain, practical lan-
guage of common sense applied to thÂ«
facts of physiology, the natural relation
of the sexes, the hygiene of the home.

COUNTERFEIT LABELS
ON LIQUOR PACKAGES
DECISION BY U. S. DISTRICT
JUDGE HAWLEY.
Liquor Dealers Must Not Ship Their
Goods on False Pretenses or
Under False Labels.
T'nited States District Judge Hawley
rendered a decision yesterday which will
be of the greatest interest to dealers in
spirituous liquors.
The case was that of the United States
of America vs. Henry Campe & Co. to
collect a fine of $500 for shipping a case
of brandy labeled "Hennessy One Star
Cognac," when in fact the label was a
counterfeit and the liquor was not of the
brand named.
Judge Hawley quotes the following from
the Circuit Court of Appeals:
Unquestionably, an observance of the re
quirement that packages of liquor shall be
shipped or removed only under names indi
cating truthfully their contents will aid the
revenue officers to trace and identify such pack
ages, and thereby verify the truth OT fnlFlty of

fier. There are doubtless other ways familiar i
to the revenue offi'-prn in which the require- !
ment of section 3449 tends to the detection and j
suppression of frauds on the revenue.
After quoting the foregoing Judge Haw- j
ley proceeded to say: "As that action !
was against a distilling company the j
court had no occasion to pass directly
upon the point whether or not the act j
in question was intended to apply to any !
other persons than rliPtilk-rs, manufac- !
turers or rectifiers of liquors, and defend- !
ants argue that it must be limited to such j
persons.
"The statute does not, in terms, make
any such limitation. The language of the '
court in the case cited is broad enough ;
to include any person who ships, trans- j
ports or removes any spirituous or fer- I
mented liquors from one place to an- j
other in violation of the provisions of the I
statute.
"The demurrer is overruled."
HEARST LIBEL CASE.
Owing to the Defendant's Alleged
Illness the Hearing Is Con
tinued Till To-Morrow.
The case of W. R. Hearst, proprietor
of the Examiner, charged with criminal
libel by Claus Spreckels, was perempto- j
rily set down for hearing before Judge i
Mogan yesterday morning, but when it !
was called John S. Drum, representing !
Garret McEnerney, asked for a further
continuance, as Hearst was ill in bed and ;
could not be present. He thought that j
if the case was continued for an hour and
a half Hearst might be able to appear.
"If you say he is ill in bed and cannot
appear now, how do you think he will be
able to come here so soon?" asked the
Judge.
Drum replied that he did not know, but
he would telephone to Hearst and ascer
tain if he could be present. Drum held
a consultation with Attorney Grove L.
Johnson, for the prosecution, and the lat- j
ter remarked that he had placed himself
to considerable inconvenience to be pres
ent, believing that the case would go on,
and he thought it would be better to al
low the matter to go over till November
4, the time fixed upon at the last caHlng
of the case.
The Judge said he was willing to hear
the case at any time convenient to both
parties, and suggested that counsel should I
arrange for some definite time. Drum i
thereupon promised to have Hearst in
court to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock,
and by mutual consent the case was con
tinued until then.

owning the Sanitary Reduction Works be
asked to name a price to be given to the
city for a term of years for incinerating
all garbage, including that kind of refuse
which has been heretofore dumped by
scavengers on vacant lots. Further it is
suggested that the Supervisors ask on
what terms the reduction works can be

The French bark Duchesse Anne will
be released from quarantine to-morrow.
None of the crew show any signs of dis
ease, and as It is nearly six weeks since
the last member of the crow died of bu
bonic plague, Dr. Mathiewson thinks
there Is no fear of contagion. The gene
ral Impression seems to be that tho
dreadful Asiatic scourge would not live
here any more than yellow fever. For
forty flays the sailors and officers have
been living in the same quarters in which
their ship mates died, and all are In the
very best of health.
The quarantine officials are not taking
any chances, however. The Duchesse
Anne is to be thoroughly fumigated to
day. Everything in the cabin and fore
castle will be landed on Angel Island and
put through the hot-air process, while
every member of the crew will be given a
disinfecting bath. Dr. Mathiewson, the
Federal quarantine officer, says that as
soon as this work is done the vessel will
be released. She will therefore come Into
the stream to-morrow, and will dock as
soon as a berth can be procured for her.
She was chartered prior to arrival by
Girvin & Eyre to load wheat for Europe,
and no time will be lost in getting her
away on her homeward voyage. Captain
Waflace the pilot who brought the
Duchesse Anne in, is still aboard, much
to his disgust.

later was sold to San Francisco owners,

By the grace of James D. Phelan,
Mayor of San Francisco, another death
trap is being added to the water front.
Passengers by the ferry steamers from
Oakland, Alameda and Berkeley look at
the structure in amazement, and the re
mark is general that if anybody is killed
through its falling in the ttrst north

lynched for putting his signature to the
permit to build the fence.
From Sacramento to Clay on East
street the Frank estate owns all the
wooden shanties that confront visitora
on their first arrival in San Francisco.
From Sacramento to Commercial the
buildings are two stories, but from Com
mercial to Clay they are only one story.
On October 13 the Board of Super
visors, with the Mayor approving,
granted an advertising concern a permit
to erect a twenty-foot fence on top of
the one story buildings on East, between
Sacramento and Clay.
When the men began putting the fence
on the two-story buildings Sergeant Tom
Mahoney of the harbor police stepped in
and would not allot", the work to go on.
On the one-story buildines he allowed
them to work, but nothing could be done
with the others until a nÂ«?w permit could
be rushed through the Board of Super
visors and signed by the Mayor. The
twenty-foot fence Is now up and being
painted and In a few days will be cov
ered with advertisements.
This enormous stretch of fencing is
braced with 4x4 timbers only, and when
a southeaster or northwester strikes it
there will be trouble.

WIDBER AGAIN IN COURT.
Offers Evidence in Support of a Mo-
tion for a New Trial.
Augustus? C. Widber, convicted of hav
ing looted the city treasury, was up be
fore Judge Cook again yesterday morning,
watching and listening to the proceedings
instituted for tho purpose of gaining him
a new trial. Attorney Peixotto was al
lowed to introduce testimony in substan
tiation of his allegation that Juror F. A.
Well had expressed an opinion unfavor
able to the defendant previous to the trial.
John Cook was called, and testified that
Well h:i<l Etated that in the event Widber
was guilty he should be punished. This
was the only opinion he had expressed.
P N. Brown was next called. He nad
heard the juror express an opinion, but
whether on the Widber or Botkln case he
was unable to say. This ended the pro
ceedings, and the case was continued until
Thursday for argument.
Boys Charged With Robbery.
John Richardson, a boy living at 630
Capp street, swore to a complaint in
Judge Low's court yesterday for the ar

trero avenue Thursday searching for
worms for bait when the five boys sur
rounded him and one of them drew a
long knife out of his pocket and threat
ened to kill him if he made an outcry.
Then they searched his pockets and stole

THE FRENCH BARK
DUCHESSE ANNE
SHE arrived In port last Friday night, and was at once placed in quar
antine. A few days after she sailed from Hongkong the captain was
taken with the bubonic plague and died. Shortly afterward a sailor
sickened with the disease, and he also died. The other members of the
crew are now in good health, but they and the ship will be fumigated be
fore they are allowed to leave the quarantine grounds.
HIS QUALIFICATIONS
ARE OF THE BEST
HENRY S. MARTIN WILL MAKE
A MODEL SHERIFF.
It Is Predicted He Will Prove a Rec
ord-Breaker in the Matter
of Majority.
The opponents of Henry S. Martin,
the Republican nominee for Sheriff,
have found no better argument to ad
1 vance against his candidacy than the
; fact that he has never held office be
fore and for this reason is not fitted
to perform the duties of the office to
; which he aspires. If this were to be
: made the sole qualification of a man's
; fitness for officeâ the fact that he had
j been a public official beforeâ the coun-
I try would be compelled to run itself af
1 ter the presenffmbHe officials through-
I out the land had become too old for
further service.
The fact of the matter is that a
mans fitness for any public office
should be and nearly always is shown
by the abilities he has shown to pos
j sess by his success and accomplish
! ments in private life.
That Henry S. Martin has proven his
i fitness to be Sheriff of this county is
demonstrated by the marked success
! that he has achieved in all undertakings
i he has been engaged in since he came
i to man's estate in this, the city of his
: birth He has been a success in every
thing in which he has attempted. He
i has shown good judgment, rare execu
| tive ability, great energy and perse
verance at all times, and he is the peer
of any of his fellow men in all those
good qualities that combine to make a
good citizen and an exemplary public
official. _
The duties of the Sheriff's office are
exacting and require peculiar qualifica
tions to perform them in a manner sat
isfactory to the people. That Mr. Mar
tin possesses all these necessary quali
fications none will gainsay among the
vast number who are personally ac
quainted with the gentleman.
His reception by voters has been one
continuous ovation. It is not merely
because of the fact that he is person
ally a "good fellow," but that his re
cord as a public spirited and enterpris
ing citizen has shown him to be a man
who can be intrusted with the duties
i and responsibilities of any office within
! the gift of the people.
Any one who has been about the city
i the past few weeks and is familiar with
the flattering reception that voters, re
gardless of party, have extended to Mr.
â  Martin during his campaign, must ad
i mit that his election is merely a ques
tion of majority.
He has so many personal friends who
are taking a deep interest in
his candidacy that he finds it hard
work at times to cover ground rapidly,
so intent are those who are anxious for
his election desirous of telling him of
the enthusiasm that his candidacy has
aroused among the people.
Plain, every-day Henry Martin will
be San Francisco's next Sheriff, and
he will prove a model officer, one that
every citizen will be glad to know and
one whose record aH can point to with
pride. All who vote for him will feel
conscious of a public duty conscien
tiously fulfilled, for they can say unan
imously: "I helped make Henry Mar
tin Sheriff, with my vote, and I am
glad of it, for he is the best Sheriff San
Francisco ever had."

DEFENSE OF WALTER ROSSER.
Will Contend He Was Drugged When
He Murdered Henry Hildebrand.
Private Waiter Rosser will make a fight
against going to the gallows or peniten
tiary for life for the murder of Henry Hil
debrand, on the contention that he was
drugged on the night of the killing and
was, in consequence irresponsible for the
murder. General Barnes, who will defend
the prisoner, hopes to establish the allega.
tion that Rosser and a friend named Not
grass were drugged in a saloon on tne
Barbary Coast and that the murder was
prompted by a mind maddened from the
effects of some unknown poison.
Depositions of several members of Ros
ser' s company were taken yesterday by
Judge Wallace. As the Tennessee Regi
ment is under orders to proceed tv Manila
and may depart to-day, the depositions
of all who are acquainted with any of tne
facts of the murder were taken, to ue
used in the trial. The witnesses examined
were: Dr. Fitzpatrick, Captain A. C. Gil
lem. Corporal \V. T. Vaughan, Dr. W. R.
Davis, Captain Sheffield Clarke, Corporal
L.. B. Arms and Privates Leonidas Polk
and Charles B. Notgrass. Notgrass testi
fied that he and Rosser were enticed into
a saloon in the tenderloin by a "capper,"
and took a drink with him. As they were
leaving the saloon both became dizzy and
felt griping pains. Notgrass was so ill
that he had to be removed to the camp,
but Rosser remained downtown, and in
the evening was booked at the City Prison
on a charge of murder. All of the wit
nesses agreed in giving the accused a good
character, and the majority believed that
in some manner the murderer and his
friend had been drugged.
The Public Administrator and Freese
When a man has been elected to of
fice by vast majorities and more than
once, too, it is but natural to inquire
into the causes of his popularity. Cap
tain Freese, when he first stood for the
office of Public Administrator, demon
strated that there was at least one
Democrat left in this city, for he was
elected by 5000 majority, while every
other man on that ticket at that time
was defeated!
He is now making an active canvass
to succeed himself, and the general
opinion seems to be that his majori
ties in times past will not be dimin
ished.
Married at the Occidental.
The wedding of George Bitterdin of this
city and Miss Ampara Ynigo of Guaymas,
Mexico, was celebrated in the private
parlors of the Occidental Hotel at high
noon yesterday, Rev. Father Jaime of the
Spanish church officiating.
The bride is the daughter of one of the
wealthiest and most influential citizens
of Guaymas, and is highly accomplished,
having been educated abroad. The groom,
Mr. Bitterdin. who is well known in local
society circles, is a nephew of Mr. Ver
dier, proprietor of the City of Paris.
After a short honeymoon passed in the
southern part of the State, the newly
married couple will take up their resi
dence in this city.

i THE CALIFORNIA TITLE INSURANCE AND
TRUST COMPANY
Issues policies of insurance upon realty titles,
which guarantee purchasers and their heirs
against losses from defective searches.
The company has a paid-up capital of $250,000
and a reserve fund of $25,000, which amply
guarantees every policy.
The leading banks accept its policies and loan
money upon the property of which the title is
Insured without other search.
Having a complete abstract plant the com- j
pany Is able to make and continue abstracts for j
use of attorneys at shortest possible notice.
"The advantage of a policy when a man
wishes to convert hiÂ» property into cash quickly
I or to make loans upon It has been proven
: again and again by experience. The man with '
i a guarantee title finds that he can borrow
I money with- as much ease as if he had stocks
: and bonds."â Chicago Tribune.
"The guarantee of such companies protects
purchasers of property and mortgages against
risks which, though remote, always attend real
; estate transactions. The most experienced
! lawyer may err. especially where the. law Is un-
: determined and fraud is an element of danger."

OF THE CAMPAIGN
IN LOS ANGELES
Webster Davis Talks
to Thousands.
EXPLAINS M'KINLEY'S POLICY
VOTERS URGED TO SUPPORT THE
ADMINISTRATION.
After a Tour of the State the Mis
souri Statesman Predicts a
Landslide to the Repub
lican Ticket.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 29.â Hon. Web
ster Davis this evening at Hazards
Pavilion aroused Republican enthusi
asm to its highest pitch. He addressed
5000 people who crowded themselves
into the auditorium until it could hold
no more, and for two hours they lis
tened to the sound doctrines advanced
by the distinguished citizen of Missou
ri. Such a meeting as the one to-night
has not before been seen here in this
campaign. The eloquence of Mr. Davis
had much to do with the enthusiasm
that was manifested, but it also indi
cated that the Republicans are alive
and active and that Los Angeles Coun
ty certainly may be relied upon for its
old-time Republican majority.
When Mr. Davis arrived in the city
thit= afternoon he was met by a non
partisan committee and escorted to the
Chamber of Commerce, where he was
tendered a reception as Assistant Sec
retary of the Interior by the citizens,
regardless of political affiliations. Sev
eral hundred citizens were by this im
promptu reception given an opportuni
ty to meet Mr. Davis.
Bradner W. Lee, chairman of the Re
publican County Central Committee,
called the meeting at the pavilion to
order, and Edwin A. Meserve was pre
sented as chairman. In a few brief re
marks Mr. Davis was introduced.
For two hours the gentleman talked
and he was listened to most intently.
Frequently he was interrupted by long
and continued applause. Mr. Davis'
remarks were largely devoted to na
tional politics. He made a masterly
statement as to what the McKinley
administration had accomplished for
the people in the past eighteen months.
He explained fully the war policy of
the President, which elicited long and
continued cheers. The tariff policy as
outlined in the Dingley bill was dwelt
upon at length and contrasted with the
disastrous effect the Wilson bill had
upon the industries of the country. Air.
Davis made a telling point in cit
ing the fact that the Republican party
was the party of the poor boy and not
the friend of the plutocrats. He point
ed out that Lincoln, Johnson, Grant,
Garfield and Blame were poor boys and
had been advanced to prominence and
power by the Republican party as soon
as it was ascertained they possessed
true merit, clear heads and undoubted
ability. Mr. Davis insisted that the
Republican party was the party of the
poor man and at all times his defender
and champion.
To the Silver Republicans Mr. Davis
paid particular attention, and he ex
tended a cordial reception to them to
return to their old faith. He made a
strong argument in favor of the Nicar
agua canal, which he said the Repub
lican party was in favor of construct
ing at once.
In closing his address Mr. Davis ex
plained the necessity of sending to
Congress men who would stand by
President McKinley and his wise policy
in the conduct of the affairs of the na
tion.
In an interview after the close of the
meeting Mr. Davis said:
"California is going Republican as
sure as the world. There will be a
landslide for Gage a:id Neff and the
whole Republican ticket from top to
bottom. It have been in San Fran
cisco, Sacramento, Oakland, San Jose,
Modesto, Fresno, Bakersfleld and now
in Los Angeles, and I tell you that
everywhere there are indications that
industrious and thinkinsr people are in
favor of a State administration that
will assure good government and pro
mote confidence. I have noted the fact
that many old-time Democrats in Cali
fornia are working this year for Gage
as against the conglomeration of Popu
lists, socialism and Democracy repre
sented by Maguire, fused only for the
purpose of gaining offices."
WATERS WELCOMED
AT SANTA BARBARA
SANTA BARBARA. Oft. 29.â A grand
illuminated parade took place this evening-,
in which the Amerious Club, its campaign
band, the local band, the "Uncle Tom"
company's band, a hundred bicycles and
many prominent Republicans on foot took
part.
The Americus Club is a political organi
zation, semi-military in character. It was
organized during the Markham campaign,
and l\as maintained its organization ever
since. It is composed of several hundred
young men of Los Angeles County, who
have been very carefully drilled, and is
now one of the finest marching clubs on
the coast. Its white and orange uniforms
made a beautiful appearance.
After the parade 3000 people assembled
in a large tent put up for the occasion and
listened to prominent Republicans discuss
the issues of the campaign. Russell J.
Waters, candidate for Congressman in
this district, ably answered the false
charges made against him by Congress
man C. A. Barlow, a candidate for re
election. Barlow has made so many false
charges against his opponent and the con
servative voters have so thoroughly found
him out that it is conceded that his over
whelming defeat is a foregone conclusion.
The enthusiasm shown this evening
proves that this county, and more partic
ularly this city, will go for Gage and
Waters.
WHITE AT SAN RAFAEL.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct 29.â United States
Senator, Stephen M. White spoke to a
large rfudience in the Opera-house to
night on campaign Issues. Prior to the
meeting the admirers of White vented
their enthusiasm in a torchlight proces
sion and with fireworks. Senator White
was met on his arrival by a committee
composed of J. H. Wilkins, J. W. Coch
rane. M. C. Dufflcy, M. P. Cochrane, R.
M. Donne and James Keyes.
The meeting was called to order by At
torney J. W. Cochrane, who introduced
James J. Manney as chairman of the
meeting. On the platform with the chair
man and speaker sat a number of leading
Democrats.
Senator White was cordially received
and applauded at every good point in his
speech. He asserted that if Maguire were
defeated- the credit would belong to the
Southern Pacific Company. He denied
that the single tax was an issue, and be
lieved that Maguire's legislative and
Congressional experience rendered him
the best man available for the position of
Govornor.
At the close Senator White was ban
queted at Hotel Rafael.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEVADA CITY, Oct. 29.â This was
fusionists' night In Nevada City.
Mountains trembled and canyons
echoed with the thunder of exploding
dynamite, and for an hour burstine:
rockets and bombs shot athwart the
clouded heavens in all directions. Bon
fires in the streets cast a cheery clare
over the entire city and twinkled from
many surrounding peaks. The Maguire
ites had united to a man in making it
the chief demonstration of the cam
paign â for their cause und in honor of
Judge Maguire, E. L. Hutchison, can
didate for Lieutenant Governor, and
H. M. I . Rue, candidate for Railroad
Commissioner, who arrived at 8:30
o'clock from Grass Valley, where he
had held a meeting. A special train
from Grass Valley brought several
hundred citizens early in the evening.
The theater here had been elaborately
decorated, one of the most prominent
features of the decorations being a life
size portrait of President McKinlev.
over the face of which many Republi
cans present aver they saw shadows of
disapproval frequently pass as free
trade doctrines were touched upon by
the orators. The house was crowded,
and there was much enthusiasm as
compared with former fusion gather
ings here this fall.
Thomas Ford was president and forty
citizens were named as vice presidents.
The speaking was interspersed with
music by the Glee Club and by Goyne's
band.
Judge Maguire was first introduced
and for an hour and a half held the
ciose attentio-n of the audience. Hi 3
remarks were almost entirely devoted
to an arraignment of the railroad and
to personal scoring of General Barnes
and his "distinguished opponent," as
he some thirty times designated Mr.
Gage.
Judge Maguire was asked previous to
the meeting to set himself right, if pos
sible, with the peo-ple on the mining
question, in view of the widespread im
pression throughout this part of the
State that he holds that gold taken
from the ground does not belong to the
miner who digs it, but to all the peo
ple. The truly reference he made in
this direction was to casually observe
that the man who owned a home or a
mine should be protected in the rights
to which he was entitled.
Judge Maguire was followed by
Messrs. Hutchison and La Rue in brief
talks. Mr. Hutchison assured his listen
ers that the city of Los Angeles would
give a plurality for Maguire and that
he would come to Tehachapi holding
Gage even.
AT GRASS VALLEY.
Speeches Delivered by Maguire,
Hutchison and La Rue. '
GRASS VALLEY, Oct. 29.â The Dem
ocratic demonstration to-night was one
of the greatest of the campaign.
There were bonfires, salutes and fire
works. Judge Maguire, E. L. Hutchi
son and M. If. La Rue, candidate for
Railroad Commissioner, arrived on the
4:30 train. They adlressed the citizens
in a large tent. Later the party left
for Nevada City, where they were
billed to speak in the evening.
RYAN INVADES THE
HOME OF DE VRIES
Big Political Demonstration at Which
Ladies Act as Vice-
Presidents.
STOCKTON. Oct. 29.â Frank D. Ryan,
Republican standard bearer in this Con
gressional district, invaded this, the home
town and stronghold of Congressman
Marion de Vries, his opponent, to-night,
and was accorded a reception at once flat
tering and significant. He was accom
panied by Frank Coombs of Napa and
Frank H. Short of Fresno. The Repub
licans are determined to wrest this dis
trict from ennfusioo control and send a
man who will vote for Republican organi
zation of the next House and support ad-
ministration measures. The meeting was
held in the Pavilion and attended by 5000
people. Preceding this gathering the
largest political parade of the campaign
moved through the streets as escort to
the distinguished nominee.
C. M. Keniston acted as chairman of the
meeting and a decidedly novel feature of
the gathering was the calling of a large
number of ladies to the platform to act
as vice presidents. The women responded
readily and took the places assigned to
them.
Mr. Ryan is not an eloquent man, but a
hard, common sense talker, imbued with
sterling Republicanism, which rang
through every senten^ and evoked the
warmest manifestations of approval. He
urged Republicans not to be turned aside
by the Democratic bogie in the shape of
the railroad cry. He declared that if
the railroad had controlled the conven
tion which nominated him he would not
have been the nominee. He appealed to
Republicans to indorse McKlnley by send
ing representatives who would hold up
the chief executive's hands and assist in
consummating achievements so glorious
ly begun, bring honor, peace and pros
perity all over this broad land and on
every distant shore where Old Glory
waves by virtue of American valor and
sacrifice.
The speaker asked what Magulre could
do about railroads' extortionate rates if
he wero Governor. For years there has.
been a Railroad Commission In the State.
For years It had been a Democratic com
mission. What had the Democratic com
mission done? What had any of thoin
done? What had the present Democrotic
Governor, who Is against the railroads,
done? Nothing.
Messrs. Short and Coombs followed
with telling speeches. Ryan will carry
this county beyond question.
Red Bluff Hears Ferral.
RED BLUFF, Oct. 29.â Democrats and
Republicans alike turned out to-night
to hear Robert Ferral, the Democratic
warhorse from San Francisco, and J.
W. Bartlett of Weaverville, Democratic
nominee for joint Assemblyman. Mr.
Bartlett made an eloquent address, and
then Chairman Wells Introduced the
speaker of the evening. Mr. Ferral spoke
at length on. the Issues of the campaign.
Alford Talks at Santa Cruz.
SANTA CRUZ, Oct. 29.â W. H. Alford
addressed a Democratic meeting at the

REID OF YALE THE
GOLF CHAMPION
NEW YORK. Oct. 29.â The third tourna
ment of the Inter-collegiate Golf Associa
tion was concluded this afternoon on the
links at Ardsley-on-the-Hudson.
The team championship, which for two
years was won by Yale, went to Harvard
this year, but as an offset to the loss of
this honor, John Reid Jr. of Yale won the
individual championship for the New Ha
ven contingent.
The two survivors in the individual
championship contest were John Reid
Jr. and W. B. Smith, both of Yale. In
the first half of the morning round the
men were on equal terms, but at the end
of the round Reid led by two up. Smith
won the first hole of the second round
in the afternoon, but Reid forged ahead
up to the seventh hole, being four up on
the day s play at this point. Smith won
the eighth in three to seven, as Reid met
with some very hard luck. He had to
give up the hole, which was not played
out, and the figures were approximated.
Reid retrieved himself on the next, but
lost the tenth in five to three. Reid
struck a winning gait, playing from the
South Mountain tee and won the next
three holes and the championship honors
with six up to five to play. The five bye
holes were played, as Reid was anxious to
tie or beat the Ardsley record of 7S, but
he took 41 strokes to come in and was two
behind these figures at the finish.

PATIENTS NEED NOT PAY TILL THEY ARE CURED.
Dr. MEYERS & CO. have such confidence in their
successful remedies and methods that they will let the
patient deposit the price of a cure in any bank or with
any business house or newspaper in San Francisco, to
be paid to them only when a cure is effected. â_â_. .,,;.,
If patients prefer they may pay for a cure in monthly
installments. _
Nervous Debility, its attendant Dangers and Em-
barrassments, and all Contracted Ailments, including
Contagious Blood Poison, Scrofula, etc., are included in
this offer.
Sufferers should beware of stimulating appliances of
any nature. They are advertised to care nerve troubles,
when in reality they are nerve destroyers, veritable
man-killers and wreckers of human life, made to sell,
not to cure.
Debilitated men can never be restored to PERMA-
NENT strength except by a thorough and proper con-
stitutional treatment. This cannot be done by mechan-
ical or other temporary stimulants. The latter only leave
the unfortunate victims, after a few days, weeks or
months, in a condition which is almost hopeless.
In restoring weak, nervous, despondent and incom-

HART WORTH'S RETURN.
He Tells of the Interest Taken in
California's Election by the
Atlantic Slope.
OAKLAND. Oct. 29.â Hart N. Worth,
Immigration Commissioner for the port of
San Francisco, returned this morning
from the East.
; In speaking on matters pertaining to
immigration, Commissioner North said
that there is no comparison between the
immigration at Eastern ports and that
which arrives in San Francisco. They
have no Asiatic immigrants, but they have
hordes of Russian Jews, Slavonians, Ar
menians. Bohemians and Italians, all re
cruited from the lowest dregs of their
respective countries. "They are far worse
than anything that we have here, and
they are coming into the Atlantic ports
in vast numbers," said Mr. North.
Continuing, the Commissioner said con
cerning the political outlook: "The en
tire Atlantic slope is tremendously inter
ested In the political outcome, and a
great deal of interest is taken in Califor
nia, especially in the anticipation of an
increased Congressional delegation from
this State. All seemed immensely pleased
at the prospects of electing a Republican
Senator to succeed Stephen M. White."
They Want Their Money Back.
OAKLAND, Oct. 29.â Jcse <J. Moraga to
day brought suit against Arcadia E. and
Timothy "Mahoney for the recovery of '
$1500, which sum the complaint alleges the
defendants induced plaintiff to advance ,
last April, in Los Angeles, on a represen- i
tation that they were the inventors of a
new electrical machine to produce its own
motive power to an indefinite degree. A
machine on a small scale had demonstrat
ed the success of the scheme, and the
money sued lor was for fhe purpose of
constructing a large one of twenty horse
power. Plaintiff was to have a one-fourth
interest In the invention and the patents.
The consideration upon which plaintiff ad
vanced the money has wholly failed.

Although there was a large majority

Preliminary Examination of W. H.
Allen for Fraud.
OAKLAND, Oct. 29.â The preliminary
examination of W. H. Allen, charged with
defrauding John Ludeman on the Win- i
ters Hotel deal, took place to-day {n the !
Police Court. The prosecution had inti- ;
mated that one of the most important j
witnesses for the defense, John Langlitz,
was a myth. By this witness' testimony
Allen hoped to show that he himself had i
been imposed upon, in that he had ac
cepted an assignment of a mortgage from ;
Langlitz without question.
Every effort was made to secure Lang- i
litz's attendance, but without avail, al- j
though it was established that such a j
man does exist. Decision as to whether
Allen will be held to answer for felony j
Will be rendered next Monday.

has a grievance in the shape of a claim

satisfy the demand of clamorous land
lords for those "awful board bills," and
the other differences will be adjusted at

of Miss Clara was very detrimental to
business and that she has "queered her
self" with Eastern booking firms. How
ever, the young lady who would like to
pulverize Chief Lees for describing her
features In the cold, heartless official
way has had one piece of good fortune
on her Western trip. She succeeded in
getting married at Leadv.ille. This was
accomplished "with the knowledge and
consent" of her brother and without the
knowledge of her company.
The seauel to this drama is to come.
but &fim Thropp is convinced that she
would rather barnstorm one night stands
than undertake to ever charm San Fran

Leavitt Is not in his usual haunts, and

hairs at an alarming rate.

Suggestive Report on
Bonus Raising.
SAN LEANDRO'S SUCCESS
BRILLIANT PROSPECTS FOR THE
FUTURE.
Chairman Hawes Tells of His Expe
rience in Trying to Help
the Public Help
Itself.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Ilroadway, Oct. 29.
B. C. Hawea, the chairman of the ex
ecutive committee having in charge the
task of establishing a large cannery at
San Leandro, has issued a report, which
shows how much work is necessary in or
der to arouse public spirit sufficiently to
induce it to loosen its purse strings even
when the public is to be benefited.
Preparations are now being made to
build the large King-Morse cannery at
San Leandro. Nearly two years ago the
project was broached, and since that,
time the committee has been steadily
working, and ultimately succeeded in
raising $5224.
The report, which contains many sug
gestions of insincerity on the part of
pledged subscribers, says, in part:
"While in the main the committee is
pleased to report that the majority of
subscribers willingly redeemed their
I promise, there was a large minority that
i caused untold labor before they could be
induced to pay their subscription. This,
of 'course, has no reference to those
whom misfortune has overtaken in the
| interim between signature on petition
j and call for payment, aa the committee
was sensible to that fact, and always met
; them in a compromising way; but there
I was a large number who could pay, yet
endeavored by many means to avoid it.
To this class was due the fact that the
j committee was compelled to ask several
extensions of the time allotted.
"Our secretary, ilr. Frank, was instruct
: ed to use every honorable means to
| promote collections, and, while his exer
tions were in a measure fruitful, the nee
' essary or promised amount could not be
' got together. As a last resort th<>
' committee issued an appeal to people who
j had not previously subscribed, and this
j had the desired effect, as not only the
i promised sum was secured, but also a
sufficient amount was collected to defray
all expenses."
Considerable trouble was also experi
: enced in securing a p roper block of land,
i but eventually one was found, and of this
I transaction the report says:
"In the matter of purchasing- the site
j the committee was beset with difficulties,
i not only in the selection of the site to
I suit the purjrose in its manifold details,
j but to purchase it on reasonable terms.
"After negotiating with numerous par
' ties we finally purchased block 40, known
'as the (Jurtin block. The owner, how
ever, is a resident of Montana, and a
I gentleman who in this deal exercised
, some peculiar notions. To dissipate these
notions required a good deal of ex
: planatlon, legal u.n<l other, but after
three months oâ¬ tarrying the gentleman
! finally concluded" to deliver the deed,
j which brought us another stop nearer in
the direction of getting the cannery."
In conclusion Chairman Hawes gives
the following advice:
''The committee further hopes that the
people of San Leandro and vicinity will
at ail times exercise friendly considera
tion toward the people who are planting
another industry in our beautiful city of
San Leandro. Let us trust that this new
enterprise will prove an object of as
much pride as our two other manufac
tories, namely the Daniel Best Agricul
tural works and the Hay Press Manufac
tory of our colleague on this committee,
L. C. Morehouse. Let us further hope
that our industries will multiply in the
future and our city double its population
within the next five years.
"Before concluding my report of the
executive committee, I desire to express
my sincere appreciation of the constant
courtesy extended to me by the individual
members of the executive committee, and
further beg to acknowledge that at all
meetings the utmost harmony prevailed
and all deliberations were accompanied
with ever present good feeling and an
earnest desire to serve the best Interest
of this association, the business men of
our city of San Leandro and the fruit
growers of this section of Alameda
County."
SCOFIELD NOT A HERO.
Mystery Surrounding an Alameda
Footpad Story Cleared Up.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 29.â The mystery sur
rounding the assault on Sam Scofield has
been cleared away. It was not a case of
footpads, and Scofield did not knock out
an army of highwaymen, as he an
nounced. /The Scofield yarn turns out to
have been a fistic misunderstanding be
tween the would-be hero and Frank Bart
lett, son of Columbus Burtlett and nephew
of the late Governor Bartlett. What adds
interest to the case is the prominence of
the young men's families.
Scofield and Bartlett spent the evening
together on Park street last Saturday
night and after midnight started to walk
home They conversed on various mat
ters and all went well until Scofleld
passed some slighting remark about a
young lady who stood high in Bartlett s
esteem The latter at once resented the
statements and challenged his companion
to a deadly combat. They squared away,
and Bartlett, who is much the smaller
man of the two, soon had his antagonist
rolling in the gutter. Scofield. covered
with blood, went to the Park Hotel ami
told that he had been assaulted by foot
pads and that, although there had been
three of them, he had managed after a
hard struggle to vanquish the whole out-
Bartlett went home and said nothing.
He was seen this evening and corroborat
ed the story given here. Scoflold was
not to be seen to-night. .

The following letter from C. Davis of
Turlock was received by the Chief of
Police this afternoon:
"TURLOCK, Oct. 27, IS9B.
"Chief of Police, Alameda, Cal.â Dear
Sir: The San Francisco Call's description

| off Monday's p. m. overland going" south.
I He got off the train and rusTied over to

I meet some one. As soon as the train
! pulled out he seemed lost, walked around
! the burg until dusk and then around the
: depot. He went south same evening on
Fresno local. He told th<> officer here ne
i was on his way to Los Angeles. The
I clothes he woreâ hat and overcoatâ tne
i build, face, complexion and everything
i agree to his description. He seemed well
! educated in conversation, though I did
1 not think at the time he was a university
! student; took him for a fellow who did
Inside work â cook or something like thatâ
'â  though we are pretty sure he is the fel
; lOW."
Later information from Turlock was to
' the effect that there was absolutely no
' question concerning the identification.

THE rataplan of horses' hoofs, the
sharp crack, crack of stout whale
bone whips, intermingled with shouts
from a vast multitude of spectators,
were the tokens at Oakland track yes
terday that the winter racing: season of
the California Jockey Club was on.
The day was an ideal one for racing.
The softness of an Indian summer after
noon was tinged with a touch of autumnal
crlspness, although there was hardly a
breath of air stirring. The silken flags
of yellow and black, colors of the Jockey
club, hung listless on their- staffs, while
the rings of white smoke from a passing
locomotive drifted skyward until they
merged with the clouds.
The crowd gathered early, and when the
horses left the saddling paddock for the
opening scramble every point of vantage
was filled. The betting ring was a seeth
ing, struggling mass of humanity, each
individual trying to reach the block of his
favorite layer of odds. The play through
out the afternoon was heavy, especially
on the Inaugural handicap*
Up in the stand the bright colors of the
ladies' costumes relieved the somber
browns and blacks affected by the men.
The balcony of the new clubhouse lent Its
simple picturesqueness as a background
for displaying the brilliant toilettes of the
fashionable set. who had entree to It. The
overflow from the- betting ring drifted
Into the precincts of the saddling pad
dock. Here an Interesting throng of those
well up on racine- lore saw the finishing
touches given the horses and the last
whispered Instructions to the jockeys
from owner or head trainer. The attend
ance was estimated at five thousand,
FRED R. BERG
WAS NEARLY
ASPHYXIATED
The Weil-Known Treasurer for
Gutte & Frank Had a
Narrow Escape.
Frederick R. Berg, who for years has
oeen the confidential man for Gutte &
Frank, is in serious trouble and has been
at death's door. He has acted as general
secretary for the firm, and as treasurer
also for the Fire and Marine Insurance
companies handled by the concern,
for the Gutte & Frank draying company
and the Gutte & Frank Mercantile Com
pany.
All kinds of stories are afloat. Some
of the insurance men say that Mr. Berg is
a defaulter to the tune of $15,000. Others
say that he is not more than $10,000 short
in his accounts. Isidore Gutte says he
ls not short a cent, but when asked
whether the shortage was made up during
the past twenty-four hours he changed
the subject. Furthermore, when asked if
Mr. Berg was going to sever his connec
tions with the firm all he would answer
was that he had been for half an hour in
the office yesterday.
One thing is certain. Mr. Berg had a
very narrow escaape for his life the other
day. He went to bed as usual and by
some means the gas was turned on. Mr.
Gutte says his cashier uses a student's
gas laarnp and was reading in bed by Its
light. "When he wanted to go to sleep he
turned out the gas and accidentally
turned It on again. Had not Mrs. Berg
noticed the strong smell of gas that was
pervading the house and traced It to
ncr husband's room, Mr. Berg would not
be alive to-day. The wife rushed into the

Intolerable
ITCHING
Eczema All Over Head and Faoe.
Two Doctors, No Benefit.
Tried CUTICURA REMEDIES
with Rapid Cure.
I was troubled several years with cutaneous
diseases which developed into chronic Ec-
. zema, which spread all over my head, and â 
X down on my face. I took medical treatment 1
\rfrom two doctors and received but little re- .
lief, i Then I tried several lotions, etc., which
we had in the store, but only received little
relief from them. At times, the dreadful
Itching became almost intolerable. "When I :
was heated, the Eczema became painful, and
almost distracted me. I was advised to try
Ccticura Remedies and did so, and found
them all that is claimed for them. I The Ecze- '
ma rapidly disappeared, and I am well, with
no i, trace of any cutaneous disease. . Shall
always recommend Ccticura to all.* -i

Baby Scratched Continually:
Our babe, two months old, broke out in sores
over her face and ears. She seemed to be in
great misery, and would scratch continually.
I noticed your advertisement in our home
paper, and supposed it would be a good thing
' for our Sadie. I used the Cutioura (oint-
ment) and Ccjticcra Soap, and they wore a
great benefit to her. I did not like to give
medicine inwardly to a child so young, but
saw that she must have something to drive the
disease out, so I pot a bottle of Cutioura
Resolvekt, to purify her blood, and gave her
about one third of the bottle, and your medi-
cines have done wonders for her.

which augurs well for the success of the
winter racing.
The track was good but not lightning
fast, as it will be later on. The time of
the various races was good, especially
that of Napamax, which ran seven-eights
of a mile in 1:27.
The orange, blue sleeves and green cap
of Burns & Waterhouse were conspicu
ous throughout the afternoon. From Mid
love, a dashing chestnut daughter of im
ported Midlothian, down through Obsid
ian, white-faced Napamax, Recreation
and finally Shasta Water, a representa
tive of the Burns & Waterhouse stables
was first past the winning post in every
race. Ola-time followers of the racing
game affirm this to be the first time on
record where one owner won every race
at an important meeting. Dwyer, the
Eastern turfman, is credited with winning
the card at a minor meeting, but this
does not dull the luster of Burns & Wa
terhouse's success yesterday.
Trainers Ben Timmons and Mike Kelly
sent their charges to the post fit to race
for a king's ransom, and were showered
with compliments as the colors of
their employers caught the judges' eyes
each time.
The well-known Maltese cross of Lucky
Baldwin, master of Santa Anita, was car
ried into second place by his clever filly
La Goleta and by Los Medanos.
Charley Thorpe carried off the honors
for jockeys, piloting three of the winners.
His success was given due recognition, as
he was applauded each time he returned
to weigh in.
The troubles of the bookmakers began
with the opening race, a five and. a half
furlong scramble for all ages. Midlove,
the fretful Midlothian, packing SS
pounds and Devin on her back, was in
fierce demand, being playeo down to 9
to 5 favoritism. She was first away, and
made every post a winning one, leading
death chamber, turned off the gas, threw
open the windows and sent for a doctor.
When the latter arrived he went to work
with a will and soon had his patient out
of danger.
Berg's troubles were the one subject of
conversation among the insurance men
yesterday. They thronged around Isi
dore Gutte and the latter in despair had
to foresake his temporary residence in the
Palace Hotel and return to his old quar
ters on Leavenworth street. To none of
his friends would he admit that his firm
had lost anything, but that fact is ac
counted for by the guarantee company,
which was on Berg's bonds.
"It was a mystery to us all how the
man could get behind in his accounts,"
said a well-known Insurance agent yester
day. "When we remembered, however,
that he was treasurer for the marine in
surance branch, lire insurance branch,
draying business and merchandise busi
ness of the concern, the problem was
solved. In the fire and marine business a
report has to be submitted every month
to the Insurance Commissioners and in
that line he could not have got more than
$1000 behind. But when he had all four
concerns to manipulate and could juggle
from one account to the other and had
no one actively supervising him, it was
an easy thing to get away with a large
sum and no one any the wiser. I don't
think Gutte & Frank will lose much
but they will be more careful in looking
after their help In the future."

Woods on Recreation loomed up a likely
candidate. The two leaders died away to
nothing, and Woods on the Morello filly
made it four straight for the Burns &
Waterhouse colors. Grady, with Mike

at long odds, was a good third.

Riley Grannan, the noted plunger, is
again In California, but will not book for
a couple of weeks. Getting into Sacra
mento Friday evening, he there left tne
train and purchased a ticket for Los An

rest.
The stable sent In a heavy commission
on Napamax, and the ring groaned when
the Maxim filly romped In the easiest
kind of a winner. Midlove was also in
receipt of strong support from the stable.
On the strength of what he had heard
about La Goleta, Virginia Carroll took a
fall out of Napamax, and later repented.
The Baldwin filly Is probably at her best
on a lightning fast track.
In a letter received by his brother
George, Alex Covington, the "Major,"
writes that he is going to make an inva

and, no doubt, is now on his way to the
land of Dukes, Earls and plum pudding.
He will take along Candelaria, once
owned by Burns & Waterhouse, which
horse was taken from a selling race; Wax
Toy, the medium of qurte a "killing"-
Organ Pilot, Serena and possibly a couple
of other useful ones. Alex, who can tip
thp scale at 115 pounds, will do hia own
riding.
James L. Flood, an enthusiast over the
sport, who has been an absentee fuom tne
local track for some time, was an inter

Jockey J. Relff, who will be seen in the
saddle next week, is not much larger than
a full grown oyster can, tipping the scales
at 46 pounds. He is described as a great
little man for his inches. His brother
Lester was a very capable lad in the sad

GENUINE
TORTOISE SHBUU
Monday morning October 31st at eight o'clock, we
begin another sale of genuine tortoise shell goods, at about
one-half the ordinary prices and but little more than the
cost of imitation goods.
A tortoise shell ornament always retains its original
shape; keeps its lustre for years; can be easily polished;
never chips; and then, being genuine, it affords you satis-
faction â the same sort of satisfaction as can be obtained
by wearing a real diamond rather than an imitation.
This will afford a splendid opportunity for satisfying
your Christmas wants, as few guts are more acceptable
than real shell goods.

ALICE RIX WITH DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES.
T was very gay on Sixth street, just by the corner of Sperry-
Jvery gay even for Sixth street, which is never what you might
call slow. The Thirtieth District was out on the sidewalk. A bon-
CiÂ« blazed berore the San Francisco Athletic Club Hall on the
coiner, a crowd of men stood in the doorway, small boys danced
abound the bonfire, small girls minced around the small boys,
and the ladies of the neighborhood had brought out rocking chairs
and swung to and fro on the curb in the full cheer and glory of the
Xow and again an anxious mother called a small brand back
from the burning.
"Gawgee! Get outer the fire! Yer know whatcher promised me,
Gawgee!"
And for the rest of the time they talked family matters after the
fashion of ladies in conclave and politics, as is more of a fashion,
perhaps, among ladies 4n the Thirtieth than in many more aristocratic
districts.
'â¢It's the fine Supervisor he'd make for the ward." And "Yer
right there! Ye'd see the improvements he'd be making in them old
Bchoolhouses." And "It's falling down they are, them old school
houses " And "I'm crazed that the children will be walking home
from them dead." And so forth and so on till the band came round
the corner. There were three pieces and the drum In the lead.
"Hurrah! Hurrah! The flag that made us free."
The ladies in the rocking chairs rocked in time to the tune. The
men in the doorway whistled and stamped their feet. A thin child
ish treble piped up on- the words and all the children in the block
took them up and marched round the bonfire.
"Hurrah! Hurrah! We sing the jubilee."
"Listen to my Mamie!" said Mamie's mother. "She's the grand
singer!"
"Ain't she!" said the next rocker, amiably. "Ain't It nice to
hear "em?"
"You can hear Mamie over all of 'em!" said Mamie s mother.
"That's what you can!" cried a voice from behind the rockersâ
a big. genial, hearty, affable voice, full of good nature and good
feeling and whole-souled genuineness and human sympathy and
brotherly love and love of children and I know not what besides!
all the qualities a man needs in politicsâ until he is elected anyway.
And if you only suspected this in the sound of his voice you were
sure of it in the sight of the man as he came around to the front
of thÂ»i rockers and stood there with his stout legs spread, rubbing
his hands together and smiling on Mamie's mother and the next
rocker and Mamie, who was marching byâ
"Hurrah! Hurrah! The flag that made us free!"
"That child's got a fortune in her voice," said the genial and
whole-souled one.' "She sings like a bird, Mamie does! W here d you
learn tc sing like that, Mamie?" _ n .â
"To school!" said Mamie between hurrahsâ "We sing the jubilee.
"Wonderful! Wonderful! And of course you ladies will be over
to-night just to encourage us candidates? And to hear the Mayor.
That's right! That's right! You ladies are the life of the Demo
cratic party. I often say that! I often say that the ladies have
more to do with electing the right man than the men themselves!
Ha-ha-ha: Ain't that so?"
"You bet its bo," said Mamie's mother.
But the next rocker giggled coquetti.shly.
"And you're the right man, ain't you? Could you tell me a
better man now for Tim to vote for?" â 
The genial man stopped rubbing his hands and stretched them
out before him appealingly. 'Mrs. Quinnehan!" he said gravely.
Tim thinks I'd do best for the ward I hope I'll get his vote, but if
there's any other man he thinks would do better I want him to vote
for that man. It's the interests of the ward I've got at heart. You
tell Timyou heard me say that yourself, will you, Mrs. Quinnehan?
And of course Mrs. Quinnehan s^ild she would and that she knew
whom Tim would vote for, and when the genial and whole-souled one
passed on she looked after him and said to Mamie's mother, "Ain't
he the fine man and the lovely speaker! And so nice to everybody!"
And so. Indeed, he wasâ as nice as he could be, beaming on the
block as warmly as the bonfire, paying little compliments to all
the rockers, .patting little boys, smiling on little girls, clapping gawk
youth on the back, throwing his arm lovingly over the shoulders of
citizens clean or soiled, drunk or sober, responsive orotherwise, greet
ing the crowd in the doorway of the San Francisco Athletic Club like
long-lost brothers â "old boy" and "old man " and "old borse" and "old
Bocks"â and .asking them all to step up and have something. He
stepped up himself through a door cut in a rough board partition
across cne side of the entrance hall and the crowd after him. And
as it stepped up I vow it grew. I know not how, but a mysterious
summons went out from it and attracted other men to it from the
north, south, east and west of it. Men who were inside the hall came
out, men who were outside the hall came in, men who were up the
block came down, men who were down the block came up, men who
were across the street came over. And they went through the door
In the rough board partition after the fine man and the lovely speaker
who was so nice to everybody and, I suppose, had something, for
standirg alone in the outer hall I heard his hearty, genial voice
above the clink of glasses- and the shuffling of feet, urging them to
have something more. .',Â«...*_,
Tho hall was decorated bravely in thin strings of bunting, polit
ical banners and placards offering brief imperative advice to votersâ
"Vote for Washington Dodge for Assessor;" "Vote for Hull Mc
riau~hry for Justice of the Peace;" "Vote for James D. Phelan for
Mivor " And each placard baited slyly with a picture as if to say,
"I ook on this honest countenance and vote for another man if you
can " Behind the political banners hung the gay silk, gold-fringed
banners awarded to the club. Ropes and rings dangled from the cen
ter ce : llng over that space devoted to contests in the manly art and
r.o\v *lt thick with chairs. A fallen punch-bag lay In a corner beside
anile of carpet, and a gay lithograph of the victorious Fitz, caught
tn ih* brief costume of the ring, was half eclipsed by a portrait of
Jr-nos G Masuire done on cotton in his campaign coat.
Th<* band came in and eat on the punch-bag and the pile of car
pets ard tooted three toots of the "Wabash." The crowd came back
through the door in the rough board partition and filed slowly into
the hall. A few more came in from the street. The little boys and
the little girls among them and a man with a young baby in his
arms. He was a tired looking man, pale, soft-eyed, delicately bearded
like the gentle Nazarene, and he held the baby with a practiced hand
that told its motherless story well. The better sort of men passed,
b-<- a tacit understanding, to the chairs in the middle. of the hall;
the others climbed the tiers of rough benches, like circus seats, which
lined the side walls to the roof, and the worst, as often happens,
went to the top. , .
The baby cried out sharply in its sleep upon its father s breast.
He soothed it tenJerly and a woman straggling by looked down at it
and at him. She was a dissipated looking woman with a rough face
and reel eyes, but she smiled a sudden sweet, womanly smile and said:
"Ain't it cunnin'."
Father smiled back at her and she passed on to the circus seats
and scrambled up them, shrieking and catching at the shoulders of
men til she reached the top. A man who looked like a bunco-steerer
grabbed her by the arm when she got there.
â¢â l. ay down!" he said thickly. "Lay down!"
The men in the middle chairs were interestingâ like with the
kinship of class, grim, strong-featured, lined, worn, with serious
eyes. They were here to help make the city's laws, to elect the city's
lawmakers. One could see that they took such matters seriously if
not intelligently. The pity of it was they were in the minority. A
sort of master of ceremonies stood by the door and shoved people
along out of the passageway. He caught me under the elbow.
"Want to sit front?"
"No," I said, rescuing the elbow.
"There'll be a crowd here by the door,"- he argued, reaching out
again, "and you can't see the Mayor if you sit here."
"Thanks," I said. "I've seen him."
A woman who had not snatched at my wasted opportunity. I
saw her yield a willing elbow and go hustling through the chairs
to the very first row. She sat there with her eyes glued to the
curtain at the left of the stage and started nervously every time it
was lifted to let a candidate through. :" And after all the Mayor- Kame
by the other doorâ democratically, you know, right through the
crowd, so that he was recognized and cheered from the start. { â 
But this was later. All the other candidates came firstâ the
would-be Supervisors and Assessors and School Directors and City
and County Clerks and Attorneys and Justices of the Peace. And
what they all, with an exception or two, wanted to put themselves
in this embarrassing position for I could not sayâ perhaps at
that moment could they. Their political aspirations seemed to weigh
on them like a load of shame. They apologized for taking up the
time of the audience with their poor remarks and volunteered to
make these as short as possibleâ which they certainly did not
dwelt on the superior merits of other candidates (for other offices, of
course;, expatiated on their own unworthiness and had, usually, to
be helped oft by the chairman. One pitied them out of a full heart
to see them so shamed and shy and wondered, as I have said before,
why on earth they had rushed into politics at all if they felt this
way about it, since it is so easy to hide one's unfitness for public
office by remaining in private life. They were all floridly introduced
by the chairman, adorned with characters they could not hope to
sustain, painted in colors that were sure to fade, and then turned
over to the Thirtieth. < â  , .
"This is Mr. Bartlett! One of that famous family of Bartletts
who have figured in the political history of the State. Mr. Bartlett
is fitted by heredity as well as natural ability for public office. I
will leave my brilliant young friend to speak for himself."
Mr. Bartlett smiled palely on the Thirtieth and began with a
little anecdote about a man named Pat who had a bucket of rock
dropped on him. "Are you dead, Pat?" said the man who dropped
the bucket. "Naw! O'im not dead," said Pat. "but O'lm knocked
spacheless." The Thirtieth received this in stony gloom. It was
evident that Mr. Bartlett had dropped a bucket of rock. He paused
hopefully and cast a deprecating eye over the house. The bunco
steerer rose at him from under the roof.
"Lay down!" he shouted. "Lay down!"
The chairman rapped for silence and Mr. Bartlett finished his
speech. He made a point of having been born in the neighborhood.
"I have lived," he said, "almost within sound of my own voice!"
"You must have a strong constitution," observed a man at the
back of the hall.
The Thirtieth laughed brutally and Mr.- Bartlett hurried away
from his childhood's home to other matters of Interest and sat down
in the midst of rustling and shuffling that must have told him he
was not good for one word more.
Not so Mr. Twigg, who might have talked for ever to the Thirtieth
if he could but have found the words. But words were not ex
actly in Mr. Twigg's line. He had a few, of which he made repeated
use, but even a good thing cannot last forever. , Mr. Twigg wanted
to go to the Senate from the Thirtieth. He put it very unostenta
tiously. He said he wasn't no self-flatterer, that is to say, he wasn't
no hand to flatter himself, but he thought he could flatter himself
to the extent that he had always been honest and he thought a man
wasn't flattering himself any too much who could say that, but still
he flattered himself it wasn't every man who could flatter himself
so much. Then he said he thought honesty was a good thing.
The Thirtieth cheered this sentiment wildly. Mr. Twigg was so
pleased that he said it again. Then he said that if he got elected to
the Senate he meant to be an honest Senator if he wasn't nothing
else. And the Thirtieth cheered him off almost as wildly as they
cheered Mr. Hanrahan on. I forget now what it is Mr. Hanrahan
wants. I know if the Thirtieth has any influence he is likely to get
it, whatever it is. After the Mayor, Mr. Hanrahan was the man of
the night. He was modest and I think sincere, and certainly brief.
" "You know me," he said. "I was born in the Thirtieth. I went
to school in the Thirtieth. I've worked in the Thirtieth. If you
don't' all know me it's because I've worked hard ever since I left
school and I haven't got round much among you. But I guess you
all know me." â â¢â â V â  Â»
And that was about all there was to Mr. Hanrahan's speech.
But* what need, may I ask, has man to say more- when a little will
succeed so well? 4 Mr. Pope, aspirant " for the honors of
School Director, talked for : twice the time and talked exceeding well
without producing half the effect. His was the instructive style,
full of suppositious cases, mathematical calculations , and quota
tions from the great. His dignity was invincible. The bunco
steerer told him twice to "Lay down!" without disturbing the even
tenor of his grave discourse and the Thirtieth was cowed to silence
by his superior English. Still it. was not enthusiastic over him
as it was over Mr. Hull McClaughry, a keen- faced, clear-eyed young
man who wants to be Justice of the Peace, and said quite candidly
that he thought he would make a pretty good oneâ indeed, he 4
looked as if he mightâ and that he would try anyhow for all there
was in him and he hoped his fellow citizens in the Thirtieth would
vote fr.i him If they felt the same way, and anyhow he hoped, when
they were making up their minds about bigger candidates for bigger
nlacesT that they would remember him and those little two hundred
and ninety-nine dollar jobs out at the City Hall . Then he ducked
a briof little bow and said he was very much obliged to them for :
listening to him and got himself into his hat and coat and: out of
the ha* in a great hurry, with everybody stamping and clapping

Then the chairman rapped fo
order and Mr. Franklin K. Lan.
went on with his remarks. Hi
said he did not wish to take ud
the time of this fine audience.
"Stop right there." said a voice from the line audience. "Stop
"ight there, Frank! You can have all the time you want. We're your
friends and we've got time to burn."
'Yes, thanks," replied Mr. Lane, blandly, "but I've got to speak
at two other meetings myself. Besides the Mayor will be here pre
sently (wild cheers) and I want to get in a few remarks about him
before he comes and about some of the other candidates, including
myself."
"What's the matter with Franklin K. Lane?" shouted the Thir
tieth. "He's all right!"
Mr. Lane bowed appreciatively and went on with his few re
marks 1 . He made all the old points over again, but he made them
nr ji Wo Hnnpnlf'fl tnrifiillv to the wnrltinsman to sunrÂ»ort. the mer
of his own ctaaÂ», mentioning adroitly that he had worked hnnselt
â with "these two good hands," also that he had gone hungry on the
streets of San Francisco while looking for work to do with. them.
And then what did he do? Did he go to the mansions of Nob Hill
and ank the bloated bondholders for their gold? No! He went to
the honest workingmanâ his friend and equalâ and borrowed a dollar
from him and paid it back, too, as soon aR he could! And that was
what the working-men wanted to do. They wanted to hold together,
to keep to their own, to stick to their friends! To such men as
James D. Phelan and James G. Maguire, who belonged to the work
ing class themselvesâ Just as he, Frank Lane, didâ and he was proud
of it! And in the midst of his enthusiasm Mr. Frank Lane neglected
to mention why he himself had stopped working with his two good
hands to study law with his one good head â any more than James
G. Maguire ever explained why he left that anvil of which he is â *Â«
monstrous proud during campaigns and keeps so carefully in the
background at other seasons of the year.
The Mayor came in to three Wagnerian trumps on the trombone.
The Thirtieth cheered him to a man. Its representatives crowded so
close to him that he had to pick up the skirts of his campaign coatâ
that sober black diagonal of priestly cut which belongs in common
to politician and undertakerâ and pull it along after him.
"Where do they get their clothes?" I whispered to the man
with me.
"Goldstein & Cohen's," he whispered back. "Good political make
up, isn't It? "Wait till you see Maguire's!"
"But Maguire Is not coming over here to-night."
"We'll go over to him. We'll go with the Mayor. Listen!"
"What's the matter with Patton?"
The cry came from the back of the hall and the Thirtieth roae

to settle it. A man with S. F. F. D. on his cap struck his hand on
his le/r and shouted, "The whool foire department is behoind Phalin,
and that settles Patton!"
"Lay down!" said the bunko steerer, sleepily. 'Dye hear? Lay
down!"
Meantime the Mayor extended a pacific hand and smiled a smile
of peace. He said Patton was all right because nobody knew any
thing about him.
'Wait,' he said dramatically. ""Wait until he has had two years
in the City Hall and then we can tell what's the matter with him!"
Then he told his little hard-luck story about the jeers of the
Republican press and his persecution at the hands of false-hearted
lamp-lighters and made a few little boasts and threats about the
gas and water companies and what he had done and what he meant
to do to them. And then he bowed his little bow and went his little
ways with the cheers of the Thirtieth and three more Wagnerlan
trumps of the trombone to speed himâ as pleased a little politician
as ever worked hard for popularity "shouth Market and got it,
such as it is, and for whatever it is worth.
And with him went all the glory of the meeting in the Thirtieth
District. The candidates who concluded it spoke to emptying benches
md (o idle ears. The band stole quietly away. Even the bunco
steerer went home, and the woman with the red face with him, and
alter them the tired father and the baby asleep again on his breast.
At the Metropolitan Temple, where the Mayor went, and 1 close
after him, were none of these interesting thingsâ no babies, no bunco
â¢Ueerers, no bonfires, no atmosphere, no excitement, no inter
ruptions to speak of. There was not even very much Mayor. Ho got
a rousing, cheering reception and the three Wagnerian trumpsâ so
like those of the Thirtieth District that I suspected him of carrying
an automatic trombone under his coattails. But as the Thirtieth
District meeting was all for Phelan, so the Metropolitan Temple meet

And so was Maguire. That campaign modesty which inspires
candidates to dilate on the merits of one another hath no place In
the Maguire philosophy. The gubernatorial candidate of the Demo
cratic party talks about himself. He speaks in sneering contrast of
his "distinguished opponent" and speaks of him thus too oftenâ some
six or seven times in the same sentence â so that in listening I was
somewhat minded of the oratory of Mr. Twigg. But fondly as the
Maguire fancy clings to the word "distinguished," used in a satiric
sense, it is yet more firmly set on the little words "I" and "me."
These drop from his tongue as honey droppeth from the comb and
linger sweetly on his lipe and leave them only to return. His speech
was a little autobiography, bound in the beauty of self-esteem, his
manner a vast compliment to himself, his acknowledgment of ap
plause in the nature of approval, his egotism of that smug and
smiling sort that maddens whom It hears. And although I am as
good a Democrat as ever wrote for a Republican newspaper I longed

Buying "Liquor.FHled Candy" in a Popular Candy Store.
Official Analysis of the Candy.
1 have analyzed samples of candies known as "chocolates filled with
cordial," and find the contained liquid to be rum. water and sugar.
Youra respectfully, . FRANK T. GREEN,
Chemist San Francisco Board of Health, Etc.
A BEAUTIFUL box done up in
dainty wrappings and filled with
Maskey's beet chocolates has
carried almost as much havoc
in its wake as the celebrated
Botkin candy.
It aroused the indignation of the re
cipient, who is a prominent member of
the Woman's Christian Temperance
Union.
She immediately put on her bonnet
and armed with the innocent looking
candy sallied forth to horrify the
friends with -the alluring sweets. She
took the box with her to the last meet
ing of the W. C. T. U., and a resolution
â¢was passed condemning the character
of the candy.
The committee did not condemn the
donor of the candy. In fact, she was
as horrified as the other ladies when
she learned that her gift, meant as a
token of affection, contained "poison."
"Poison" is the term the ladies of the
W. C. T. U. apply to the objectionable
ingredient of the candy.
"Rum" is the term the chemist, who
has analyzed the candies, applies to
the ingredient.
Chocolates filled with cordials is the
name the manufacturer makes use of.
The lady who bought the candy asked
for assorted chocolates. ' She was not
aware of the fact that there are choco
lates filled with rum. Hence she did
not -request the shop girl to leave out
the "cordial chocolates."
When the box reached its destination
it was hailed with delight and immedi
ately opened. The first candy eaten
was filled with a liquid of a peculiar
taste and odor. That is, it tasted pe
culiar to the. member of the W. C, T. ('.
She passed the box to a man and he
selected, a similar candy.
"Rum!" succinctly announced the
man, who is not a member of the W.
C. T. U.

C. T. U., Discovered the "Rum

, r> ONFECTIONB filled with alcohol in any form are a most serious
I menace to the well-being of the nation. It is a scientific fact
> \_^f that there are a large number of persons who have a latent in

â¢ life if it has no awakening stimulant. An alcoholic-filled confection
â¢ is one of the most insidious methods of enkindling that appetite.
â¢ Young ladies are so often the recipients of these candies and there

- I was Retting advertisements for our annual report I found that we
could not acoept the advertisements of confectioners, as all the leading
ones made and sold rum-filled candies. One confectioner openly told
me that there was not a first-class dealer in the city who did not
â  carry them. Some way should be evolved for stopping this nefariou*
â¢ practice. If there is anything worse than alcohol Satan never dis
â¢ covered it.
There were five of these rum-filled
candies in the box. The others-were
chocolates made of harmless concoc
tions. The rum-filled candies were ta
ken out of the box and shown to the
sympathizers and members of the W.
C. T. U. The recipient of the candy
felt it her duty to investigate the mat
te: anu Bee â¢whcilicr the demand for
such candies was widespread.
â¢ She first went to Haas' candy store.
"Have you any filled chocolates?" she
asked the shop girl.
"Filled with what?" Inquired thÂ«
girl.
"I don't know," responded the lady;
"but it's some sort of liquid."
"Oh, you mean the candles filled with
rum," and the girl proceeded to mea
purÂ« out the required amount.
"Most people like chocolates, don't
they?" said the W. C. T. U. member,
artlessly
"Yes. especially these filled with cor
dial," answered the girl.
Gruenhagen's was the next store vis
ited. Chocolates filled with rum were
purchased, th* shop girl making no se
cret of the nature of the ingredient.
"What do you call these candies?"
asked the W. C. T. U. member.
"Chocolates filled with cordials,"
answered the girl.
"Are they good?" Inquired the lady.
"Everybody likes them. They are
very popular. We sell a great many,"
responded the girl.
A number of the smaller shops down
town were visited and In all of them
the ruin-filled or "cordial" chocolates
were obtainable.
The candy shops in the Western Ad
iition sell a great many 'cordial"
chocolates. The Woman's Christian
Temperance Union member bought a
niX <>f them at Bernheim's on Polk and
Butter streets. "I want to buy a box
>f filled chocolates for my little girl,"
she said.
Filled with cordial?" asked the shop
ijirl.
"What is the cordial made of?" in
juired the lady.
"Rum," promptly responded the shop
jirL
â¢I wonder whether my little girl will
ike them," said the W. C. T. U. mem
aer.
â¢Oh, yes, all the children in this
aei^hborhood are just crazy for them.
Mrs. Maria Freeroan Gray, President of the W. C.
T. U. f Declares the Law Should
Act Promptly.
EVERY effort should be made to stem the increasing popularity
of rum-filled candies. I think it is the most dangerous practice
in the way of creating an appetite. It is even more harmful
than the practice of giving to the children the sugar saturated with
rum that is left in the bottom of the glass. Because a mother gives
the child the chocolates entirely ignorant of their contents. It is more
of a menace to children than the saloon. For if a child is given liq
our straight he does not like the taste as a rule. But he soon learns
to like it when it is done up so seductively in chocolates. Mothers'
attention must be called to these candies and public sentiment
aroused. But to make it absolutely effectual there should be a law
against such candies and a fine for their manufacture and sale.
There are so many instances where we must first decrease the de
mand before we can ask the manufacturer to cease. But this is a
practice thM can and must be stopped at once.
They like them better than any other
kind. I'm sure she'll like them; all
children do. I like them myself," and
the shop girl ate one with evident
relish.
The W. C. T. U. member went back
to Maskey's, where the original box
was bought. She saw two young ladies
whom she knew entering the store.
They met at the counter.
"Wait till she goes out before you buy
them; she's a W. C. T. U.," she heard
one girl whisper.
Opinion of Mrs. Nellie Blessing Eyster, Editor of
the Official Organ of the
W. C. T. U.
r | 'HE confectioner who sells rum-fllled candles should use on his pla
cards "Will you walk into my parlor, said the spider to the fly,"
Â± tor he is offering: something the contents at which are unknown,
and wherein lurks deadly danger. Heretofore I was not even
aware that such candles existed. I am told, however, that they have
been on the market for some time, and that their popularity is con
stantly increasing. Now that mothers are aware of the existence of
rum-filled confections they can take precautions to keep them from
their children. But as long as the manufacture and sale of rum-filled
candies is allowed it will be almost impossible to prevent such candies
from falling into hands where they will do infinite mischief. Rum
put up in such a seductive form may create an appetite for liquor
which otherwise might never have been aroused. It matterÃ not that
the quantity oX rum in each candy is small. There is an ample suf
ficiency to create a desire for more and thereby another life wrecked.
A box of confections that contains one of these rum-filled candies is
not a suitable gift for man, woman or child. But unfortunately candy
more often falls to the child, and thus is the first seed of temptation
gown. Some way must be determined upon to grapple with and crush
the practice of filling candies with rum.
THJ3 SA^f FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1898.
"LIQUOR-FILLED CANDY" SOLD WOMEN AND CHILDREN
"Oh, she won't know what they are,"
responded the other girl, and forthwith
she ordered a pound of "cordial choco
lates."
"What is the cordial made of?" asked
the W- C. T. U. member.
"I don't know," replied the girl
hastily, "but they are rather nice," and
blushing at her flb the two girls left
the store.
The girl who bought the rum-filled
candy was rather surprised to receive
a visit from the W. C. T. U. member
that same afternoon.
"I came all the way out here," she
said, "to tell you that' those cordial
chocolates are filled with rum."
"Oh, I don't think so," aaid the girl,
weakly.
"I am positive. The manufacturers
say so and I have had them analyzed
by a chemist. Won't you throw them
away?"
"We've eaten them all up. Anyway
there isn't enough rum in them to
hurt," answered the girl defiantly.
Then the W. C. T. U. member told
her something that she had never .
known. It was of a man who had
taken "not enough to hurt" and finally
had died a drunkard's horrible death.
"Is that the reason I like the candies
so much? Have I inherited the taste
from papa? Now that I realize the
danger I can fight against it." and the
girl crushed the empty box resolutely
and tearfully thanked her friend.
Then the W. C. T. U. member went
over to Oakland. She toured the candy
stores there and in most of them found
"cordial chocolates."
She bought a box of assorted choco
lates and took them out to a friend.
"Here is the kind the baby likes,"

said her friend, biting into a cordial
chocolate.
"Do you know what that is?" asked
the W. C. T. U. member.
"No. I have always intended to ask
what they flavor these candies with be
cause the children are so fond of them."
"If you knew that it was rum would
you allow the children to eat ttiem?"
"Certainly not. But is it really rum?
I never imagined 6uch a thing. To think
that I have been buying them un
knowingly and perhaps giving the chil
dren an appetite for rum. You ought
to let every mother know what the
contents of these candies are so "that
they can be on their guard. Many
mothers are now committing a crime
through ignorance and they should be
told."
That is exactly what the W. C. T. U
member thought.
So at the meeting of the San Fran
cisco W. C. T. U. last Wednesday she
brought up the subject. She told of her
investigations and a very animated dis
cussion followed.
Some of the ladles had long been
aware of the existence of alcoholic
liquors in confections, but none had
Mrs. A. E. Bradley, Business Manager of the Pacific
Ensign, Says "Rum-Filled" Candy Must
Not Be Sold.
IN allowing the sale of rum-filled confections we are laying the
first stepping-stone to intemperance. Peopie buy the candles and,
entirely Ignorant *h th#y are filled with, eat them. If there
is a dormant instinct, an appetite is soon created. These candies are
a stab in the dark. They fail into the hands of children and do their
deadly work. Girls who otherwise would never be tempted learn to
like the taste and seek it in other forms and in greater quantities.
There seems to be little doubt that the female parent is the more gen
eral transmitter of the alcoholic taint. How much sin and misery then
can be accomplished by these seemingly harmless candies! The sale
and manufacture of any confections containing alcohol in any form
should at once be legislated against. It particularly menaces our
children, and thus strikes a blowat the hope and salvation of the
entire nation..
ever realized how widespread was their
sale.
They unanimously agreed that It wag
a most dangerous habit. Ways and
means of preventing the sale of siu-h
candies were discussed. The ladies de
termined that something must be done
at once as the confections filled with
rum are temptations that assail those
who otherwise might never meet the
tempter. A definite way of fighting the
rum-filled chocolates was put over till
the next meeting and the following
resolution was adopted by a unanimous
vote:
Moved that we greatly deplore
the increased popularity of the use
of alcoholic liquors In confectionery
âbelieving that thereby a pernicious
taste is engendered and a danger
ous habit encouraged. We m<Â»si
heartily approve of any action pro
hibiting the manufacture and sale
of the same
Whether the candy dealers will take
the same point of view that the W. C.
T. U. does is a question.
The chemist who analyzed the choco
lates Bays that the percentage of rum
In each candy is small.
But the W. C. T. U. care not about
the amount. They say there is enough
to create a longing in the eater If she
has a latent tendency toward alcohol,
and certainly enough to awaken a de
sire for more If the taste of the candies
is found particularly agreeable.
So the Union is determined that at
least every one shall know the exact
nature of the ingredients of the so
called "Ghocolate cordials." If vKomen
still eat them and give them to children
it will not be through ignorance of their
contents.
But if they can possibly bring it
about the W. C. T. U. will drive the
confections filled with alcoholic stimu
lants entirely out of the market.
BANKING IN SWITZERLAND.
Some of the methods are sufficiently
antiquated, according to our standards.
For Instance, it requires fifteen minutes
in which to make a deposit at a bank.
Every banking boilM has numerous
chairs outside the railing, and the visitor
is expeited to sit quietly and cultivate a
spirit of patience while the machinery is
getting under way. A customer who
wlabea to make a deposit goes to a
window and hands in his money, together
with a memorandum of the amount. The
employe behind the railing counts thÂ«
money and prepares a receipt for it. add
ing his signature by way of preliminary.
Then a small boy takes this receipt up
stairs and submits it to an official, who
studies and then ponders for a while
as to whether it will be safe to take the
money. If he decides that the bank can
undertake the risk he passes the receipt
to another man. who prepares a dupli
cate slip and makes several entries and
finally signs his name. Then, as soon as
another man has examined the receipt and
added his name, it Is taken downstairs
and turned over to the depositor. There
Is one satisfaction â the money is thor
oughly deposited.
An American residing in Zurich went
to the bank the other day with a check
which had been given to him by a busi
ness man in a large town near here. He
handed in the check, and twenty minutes
later received his money, less 14 cents
charges. The American was well known

get a button and declare your
self a member as soon as you
can. That is if you wish to be
up to date, for the Non-Treating Club
is one of the greatest movements ever
started in this or any other cc-untry,
at least its promoters say it is.
The Non-Treating Club started in
Chicago only a few weeks ago. It now
has thousands of members all over the^
country and has just struck San Fran
cieco. The first box of 500 buttons was
received here only a few days ago and
already the supply is exhausted. An
order for several thousand has been
sent to Chicago and it is very apparent
that they won't last long after they
get here.
Everybody who has joined the Non-
Treating Club thinks it the greatest
Bcheme that ever was, and many who
haven't joined are singing its praises
and calling aloud for a button and a
membership card.
In fact the only men who have been
heard to utter a word against the Non-
Treating Club are the saloon-keepers.
They say it is bad because it strikes
at sociability. Members of the Non-
Treating Club have another explana
tion.
With a membership of only a few
thousand in San Francisco the Non-
Treating Club could strike a heavier
blow at the evils OK the liquor business
than all the temperance talk that has
been launched here in years or any pro
hibition law that has been enacted.
The founder of the Non-Treating Club
is E. T. Monett at Chicago. He aays
that the club waÂ« formed to correct the
evils of the treating habit in saloons.
Summed up the principal evil of the
treating habit Is that it makes us drink
too much.
"I like a glass of wine," says Mr.
Monett. "I am satisfied the glass of
wine will do me no harm; in fact, not
as much as a cup of tea. But one glass
is all I do want. More than one glass
causes a slight discomfort â the same
as too much food. And yet it Is hard
to* get only one glass.
"You ask why? Well, if I go into a
saloon and see a friend there it gener
ally follows that I have to ask him to
drink. If this treating habit stopped
there all would be
well, bat he asks
me to drink also,
and if 1 refuse he
feels offended. Then
other friends come
in and the process
Is repeated. The re

days we all saw the benefit of the plan
and explained it to others, who at once
became eager to join. At present it is
possible for me to- leave my office, get
my own drink and cume back without
offending my friends and foolishly
drinking more than is good for me. It's
a #ieat scheme. The railroad men have
taken it up and are spreading the good
work."
At present it is a little hard to pick
out the Non-Treating Club buttons
from among the vast number being
worn for favorite candidates. But the
buttons are there. The five hundred
have been well distributed. When thÂ»y
are cast among a lot of friends they do
the most good, for each understands
the feelings of the others.
Thf most noticeable movement of
this kind has been among the pupils of
Professor Van der Naillen's school of
engineering. Most of them are men
somewhat along in years, but as usual
they fell into the college habit of treat,
ing one another. It was an evil of so
ciability.
Bui now all is changed. Th* entire
seventy-flve pupils have joined the
Non-Treating Club. No pupil will ac
cept or tender a drink when erne or
mure of them are together. If one
wants a drink he buys it and the others
are not offended at not being asked.
The result is that they have all that
they want to drink, but no more, and
consequently have more money than
they had under the c-ld pernicious treat
ing system.
That's why they're shouting: 'â¢Hur

name is Lolita Farron, and she

Her skin is not remarkable on ac

"SAN JOSE" SCALE IN NEW YORK.
From the New York Press.
ITHACA, Sept. 24.â Last Sunday
afternoon as two Cornell scientists
were walking out Ninth avenue in
the neighborhood of Ninetieth
street. New York city, one of them
suddenly stopped to examine the shrubs
by the wayside. In a moment he ut
tered an exclamation. He had made a
discovery which will be of the greatest
importance to the lovers of trees in the
metropolis â it was that dreaded pest,
the San Jose scale.
It has been known for some time by
entomologists and nurserymen that the
San Jose scale infests certain parts of
New Jersey and Long Island, but never
before has it been discovered in New
York city. Unless the spread of the
pest is arrested there the beautiful
vegetation in Central Park will in a few
years become either permanently in
jured or totally destroyed.
It was H. P. GoUld, assistant in the
College of Agriculture at Cornell, who
is also one of. the State inspectors ap
pointed to look for the San Jose scale
in the vicinity of New York, who dis
sd the insect near Central Park
last Sunday. After finding the traces
of the scale Mr. Gould made an inves
tigation and discovered, not only the
shrubbery "n the streets of the city
but the trees of Central Park are more
or less infected with the scourge. It is
estimated that it will take three years'
work under a resident inspector to
eradicate the pest from New York city,
even if the work were started immedi
ately. The scale has been found also
within the last few days in nurseries in
Flushing and Bronxville.
The most efficient method of eradi
cating this pest is said to be a mixture
with two pounds of whale oil
: one gallon of water.

Lolita swam out to the drowning girl
and brought her in to shore.
"She swims like a fish," said an old
gentleman.
"Haren't you heard why?" anpwerea
an old lady who was the confidential
friend of Lolita's aunt.
"Haven't you heard why?" "Haven't

And Lolita heard, too. She wrote a

â¢"heimweh" gnawing at her heart

her and together they went to Coro

Of all the swimmers who took a daily
plunge there was none who could com

far out beyond the reach of the eye,
beyond the sound of the voice. The
other children begged her to teach
them and found her ever ready to help.
"Why do you always wear stockings,
Lolita?" asked one of the little girls.
"It's much nicer to have your legs bare
when you go in the water."
Lolita did not reply, but ran sobbing
up the beach, and that night she and
her father left for Oakland.

lentlessly does it spread over practically
all deciduous fruit trees â trunk, limbs,

of only two or three years before the
death of the plant attacked is brought
about, and the possibility of injury,
which, from experience from other scale
enemies of deciduous plants, might be
easily ignored or thought Insufficient,

importance, from an economic stand
point, is vastly increased by the ease
with which it is distributed over wide
districts through the agency of nursery

the extreme difficulty of exterminating

it does in the last regard, difficulties not
found with any other scale Insect."
It was this pernicious scourge which

of ail American fruit into her seaports

ter and lasting controversy between the
two nations. On February 5 Emperor
William issued an order: "To guard
against the importation of the San Jose
scale-louse the importation of living
plants from America; and further, of
such barrels, boxes and other objects,
which were used for packing or trans
portation of such products or parts of
such products, is prohibited until
further notice.
"The same applies to invoices of fresh
fruits or fresh parts of fruit from
America, as well as the packing ma
terial used thereto, whenever the ex
amination which is to take place at the
port of entry has ascertained the pres
ence of the San Jose scale-louse on the
goods or on the packing material."
John Walton Spencer, conductor of
University Extension Work of Agricul
ture in the western district of New-
York, said: "me San Joae scale is re
ported among our plants. It has a
quiet, insidious habit, so that few ob
serve it. A single insect is so small as
compared with the trees that it attacks
that it may be likened to the 'flea upon
a lion,' but fleas and scales also can
multiply like locusts in Egypt. It is
probably imported from California and
it came in nursery stock. It first be
gan to be noticed in the East by en
tomologists in New Jersey, then it
spread to Long Island, and for the last
few years It has been creeping up the
Hudson, where its presence was at last
recognized. It has no means of loco
motion of Its own, and it gets to dis
tant points by fastening its tentacles
upon nursery stock and spreads itself
by that means, like a plague.
"Nurserymen who have been in the
business for a number of years will
wonder if they have it in their stock,
and they should only be satisfied when
they have obtained an investigation by
the most experienced entomologists.

and grounds are on a sloping piece of
land, and in the immediate vicinity are
acres of green lawns and walks shaded
with palms, magnolia, cypress, orange
and lemon trees, while here and there
are rustic benches, roses, lilies and
flowers galore.
Every blade of grass upon the place,
every fruit tree and wide-spreading
cypress tree attest to the fact of Mr.
Gage's love and interest in his home,
for they were planted by his own hand.
Mrs. Henry T. Gage believes firmly
that her husband will be the next Gov

thought of it made me very ill for days.
I was not surprised that she was born
v.ith skin scaled like a fish. Her legs,
too. were joined together, and the feet,
being webbed, made her look like a
strange, uncanny sort of li?h. The doc

me that she would be able to walk nat
urally.
"As a mere infant she was passion
ately fnnA of water. When the nurse
Igave her her bath she was wild with
delight and struck out with her little
arms and legs as though she wanted
to swim.
"Lolita was not quite a year old when
we went to Santa Cruz to spend the
summer. She could not walk at the
time, but we ut?ed to put her in a little
bathing suit and let her creep on the
sand.
"One day the waves rolled up higher
on the shore than usual and somehow
she got mixed up with ttvm. There
were bathers all around wh. saw h.r,

to the child's rescue. You can imagine
how surprised every one was to see the

After that we simply could not keep

constantly slipping away to look at the
ocean. She would never say whether
or not she went in swimming on such
occasions.
"This summer we went to Santa
Cruz. Lolita had not been there since
babyhood. When she went down to the
beach she burst into violent tears. She
could not wait she was so impatient to
put on a bathing suit and swim. She
would stay in the water almost all day
long, but it never seemed to disagree
with her. People began to talk about
her wonderful swimming, and then

I sent her down to Santa Barbara.
From there her father took her to Coro

"We have to let her go swimming
every day now. She goes in the morn

at first, but she grew so strangely silent
and went around so piteously that I
had to let her go. She swam in the
surf at Alameda thie morning, and is
out in the yard now drying her hair.
I'll call her in. Lolita! Lolita."
Lolita came quickly, throwing back
her golden hair and showing an oval
face with delicate features and beauti
ful sea-green eyes. She Is not as tall
as the average child of fourteen, and
she has an odd) piteous expression.
"Did you enjoy your swim?" I asked.
"Yes, but I had to come home, and
when the waves call you all the time
it is so hard to get away from them."
"You love the sea?" I said.
"Oh, yes; and the sea is my friend.
It would never harm me. Even when
I was a baby it let me ride on it." She
moved over to the window, and the

it was scarcely noticeable.

continued, in a voice as young and

She is an earnest woman of vivid con

personal enthusiasm. She is essential

their five children. She takes the keen

At the thought that there might be

"Yes, it will be a wrench to leave

Mrs. Patton says she never took the

only for a short time and that soon the
thread of domesticity will be resumed.
"Oh, Ido hope he'll be elected. He's
such a good man that I'm sure he
would make a good Mayor.
"No, I am not fond of society. I am

tall clock upon the stairs tolled off the

a glad tremolo from mere joy of life.
A homey, restful atmosphere per

"Do you know," she said, suddenly,
"I have never heard my husband make
a speech, but I'm going to soon. I
would love to, for I'm sure he makes

Mrs. Patton has an admiration for

modest, shrinking from publicity, and
as she talks she settles back into her
chair with an air that goes well with
her rich southern coloring.

DEADLY BACILLI Or THE "BLACK PLAGUE" OVERCOME SCIENTISTS IN VIENNA
Last Friday a bark from Hongkong arrived at tfye GoldeQ Gate with a report that twoof the crew had died of the dreaded bubonic plague on
the voyage. The vessel was immediately ordered into quarantine at Angel Island, and every precaution will be taken to stamp out every trace of the
terrible disease. All Southern Europe is aroused over the deaths in Vienna of the physicians who were experimenting with the bacilli of the scourge

MENT IN THE LABORATORY AT ANGEL ISLAND.
VERY lately two physicians experimenting with bubonic plague germs
;ht from Bombay, India, to the Vienna University contracted the
dread disease and died. Five nurses and attendants also died. There is
danger of riots in Vienna against the university, as the populace fears

building. A rope has been placed around the building, carefully guarded,
at any one approaching the place, and also to prevent any of the
care-takers from leaving the infected building
Th- physicians and people of Vienna are much excited, but Dr. Liden, the
head of the City Health Board, says that microbes artificially raised have
not the strength of naturally raised microbes, and that the worst is over.
THE microbes of the terrible bu
bonic plague which Dr. Muller
Lght from India here killed
him. Professor Barisch, who re
fused to leave his chief when he
was stricken, also is dead. Be
sides these two men, Qve others have
already fallen victims to the scientific
Investigations.
â¢ The bubonic plague, has ragf?d period
ically over Asia and. Europe for cen
turies and no power has ever been able
to stop it til! change of wind swept it
away. It disappeared as mysterious
ly as it came.
The plague .selects Its victims as if
it walked among the people, .not one
Bad then the next one, but as the steps
of a man the victims.
Superstition says that the Wandering
Jew, upon whom our Savior pro
nounced the curse "Thou shall ' go on
till 1 return," carries with his presence
the plague.
The period of illness is short. Men
' in the act of carrying the dead to bu
rial are stricken, fall and themselves
are of the dead.
There is no scourge to compare with
it in horror, when it passes through
the half starved, huddled up peoples
of India.
Can science stay the plague?
The University of Berlin is experi
menting with the germs. Dr. Muller
went to India and watched it, escap
ing all the dangers. Carefully pro
tected cultures of the different microbes
accompanying the disease were brought
back to Vienna, where better facilities
are found for studying them than in
India.
In attempting to isolate the bubonic
plague microbe he himself became in
oculated. Just how this occurred is a
mystery.
At lirst It was not- recognized that
the scientist was suffering with the
plague. His doctors thought some cas
ual illness only affected him. His as
sistant. Dr. Barisch, attended him. Be
sides the doctor, there were two nurses
and one other attendant. They all
came and went from the sick man's
presence without precaution for two
days.
Suddenly one of the nurses fell ill;
then another. Precautions against in
fection were at once -begun, but even
then no one suspected the- truth, till
Professor Barisch died.
In the meantime Mrs. Muller had
been exposed, but had returned to her
home and went about among her
friends. Other nurses and attendants
did the came.
When two men had died Vienna be
came alarmed. The plague was In
their midst, and no known remedy ex
isted.
Prevention was their only hope
Every one who was known to have
been exposed was compelled to go into
a detached building connected, with the
university, Several persons resisted
They were promptly .arrested and forci
bly put into the isolated house. They
are attended by Sisters of Charity and
by Dr. Pooch, who volunteered for th
service. All the sick and those who
are suspected of being infected with
the microbes are Inclosed in the one
house, which is carefully guarded and
quarantined. A rope is- stretched
around the house and guards placed to
prevent any one approaching or leav
ing the pla.ee.
Provisions are furnished by means of
baskets on pulleys. When Dr. Mullet
wanted medicine for the sick he wrote
his prescription and pasted k on to the
window glass, so that those outside
could read it.
The bodies of the dead are wrapped
in sheets soaked in disinfectants and
Jhen cremated. Every article which
coui-1 be !nf>otÂ»c! is carefully burned.
When I>r. .Muiler fell ill he struggled
his best against the disease. He' kept
on his feet attending the others and
watching and noting the symptoms and
effects of the remedies. He kept in
communication with the other physi
cians of the Vienna University .by
means of a telephone. Consultations
were hold and every change noted. He
watched his 0./n symptoms and wrote
them down in his diary. He saw four
others die and wrote the details at
length.
At last fever and delirium overcame
him. He never finished the history of
his own case, for death came and some
one else must write the end. Dr. Porch
volunteered for the duty. Nothing but
the pure love of science and humanity
actuated these men. They gave their
lives to discover a remedy to prevent
th" spread i>f the plague.
In the meantime Vienna is trembling

grounds.
Those who are shut inside are wait

is little chance that they will. Whether
they do or not they will go through
some of the horror â¢which gave "The
Boccaccio" to the world.

Is a success, but more frequently it is a

It is a good deal more difficult to
rear the germs of cholera than it is to
rear chickens. Germs are delicate and
require the most careful attention to
keep them alive, in spite of the fact
that they are so difficult to kill when
they spread among the population and
become a plague.
There are about six large laboratories
lin and around San Francisco where
nearly all kinds of deadly germs are
always on hand. The most important
of these, and the best supplied with
deadly germs, is the one on Angel Isl
and, in charge of Dr. Rosenau of the
Government quarantine station.
Dr. Ernest Pillsbury has a laboratory
of his own on Scott and Pine streets
that is -well supplied with the germs
of such local diseases as under extra
ordinary circumstances might become
epidemic. His collection of the ba
cillus of tuberculosis is perhaps the
largest in the country.
Dr. Mauser on Bush street has a good
laboratory well supplied with germs.
The principal medical colleges have a
certain quantity of germs on hand in
their laboratories, and. besides, there
are a few scientific experimenters with
laboratories full of germs, hidden
! away where it is almost impossible to
find them.
It might be thought to be an easy
matter to obtain and take carer of
germs of any kind. But such is not
the case. To obtain a tiny tube of the
germs of Asiatic cholera during the
time that disease was last raging in
the Orient took considerable corre
spondence and money on the part of
Dr. Rosenau of the Government quar
antine station. And had it not been
for his position it is hardly possible
that he could have succeeded in ob
taining them.
When the tube did come it was
packed in a piece of bamboo and cov
ered with all sorts of figures and labels
and the top sealed with a big red seal
bearing the arms of the Chinese Em
pire. The doctor in China who was
good enough to send the germs also
sent a brief account of the efforts he
was put to in order to obtain them,
and also the trouble he was put to be
fore the Chinese officials would consent
to their being sent out of the country.
In the end they were brought here by
a surgeon of one of the Pacific Mail
steamships who appreciated the impor

principle and are in reality incubators

of all kinds.

pastorate in the Thirteenth Street
Presbyterian Church, the church built
for the Key. Dr. Burchard, of 'Rum,
Romanism and Rebellion' fame. I had
no quarrel with my congregation. I left
simply because I had determined to de
vote my life to reaching the unchurched
masses of New York City. I knew that
half a million of our citizens were not
church members and were practically
deprived of the right of the Gospel.
"My aim was to stir them up to a
senss of their responsibility, to a rec
ognition of their opportunities, but
through no sectarian medium.
"My first essay was In a house in
Thirteenth street, a few doors away
from my pastorate. I had long felt
that it was the Lords will I should
take that house and make It the center

proved the first resting place of the lit

movement that in 1881 I was enabled
to secure the Academy of Music, and
later Abbey's old Park Theater, corner
of Broadway and Twenty-first street,

My congregation grew, and finally we
were enabled to rent what came to be
known as the Old Gospel Tabernacle, in
West Twenty-third street.

filled with the germs of the deadly
black plague. To spill the tube into
the bay would not cause harm, be
cause the water is so cold the germs
could not propagate there. However,
even such an act would contain an
element of danger, for the germs might
lie dormant for years until they washed
up into some of the fresh water
marshes, where they would reproduce
themselves and start out on a mission
of death.
Although the tiny light streak in the
tube of gelatine represents micro-or
ganisms, the organisms themselves
cannot be seen except with the most
powerful microscope. A tiny speck of
the poisonous matter taken from the
tube on the end of a piece of- platinum
wire and spread on a glass slide will,
when properly stained and fixed and
put under the microscope, reveal thou
sands of tiny threadlike objects.
These are the deadly bacilli, and the
numbers of them in the tube can only
be vaguely surmised, when it is con
sidered that only the millionth part of
the contents of the tube has been
picked up on the wire.
Dr. Ernest Pillsbury has at present a
splendid colony of typhoid fever germs

"A little later we were suddenly in
formed by Mr. Darling that he had an
offer from a syndicate of wealthy men
of $15,000 a year for fifteen years for
this building, for a theater in which to
produce 'The Passion Play,' a carica
ture of the sufferings and death of the
Lord Jesus Christ.
"Mr. Darling had accepted the propo
sition of these parties in the interest of
his partners, and so he informed us that
he would be unable, as he had ex
pected, to rent us the property.
"Then we began to i)ray for light, and
in the end found that it was a great
benefit to us that our first arrangement
was not consummated.
"God in his providence allowed the
Morse syndicate to make the necessary
repairs, which cost from $50,000 to $75,
000, before the structure could be used
for public services.
"When they had secured the building
and put it in good shape the Morse
people offered us the use of the the
ater for our Sunday meetings. I de
clined, however, to have anything to
do with it under the circumstances,
and told the management that we
would get possession in due time. And
it soon became true. When Morse
failed It was leased to us with all the
improvements for a term of six years
at $3000 a year.
"I have no commentary to mak.i, but
simply state the fact as it isâ that on
the night after we took possession
Salmi Morse committed suicide, and the
man who was associated with him in
the Passion Play was burned out in
Brooklyn on that same night.
"A year or two passed and we then
determined to purchase a building for
ourselves instead of leasing one. Our
choice fell upon the large and hand
some building at the corner of Madison
avenue and Forty-fifth street, now the
site of the Manhattan Athletic Club.

Dr. Vowlnkle, whose office is at Van

at the University of Berlin when Dr.
Koch was making- his experiments in
the same way as Dr. Barisch was doing
in Vienna. Dr. Koch, 1 wever. was
more fortunate. He has positively dis
covered one n.icrobe â that of tubercu
losis. He, too. went to India, as did
Dr. Barisch, and brought home germs
or cultures of Asiatic cholera to study
in his home laboratory.
When seen at his office Dr. Vowinkle
showed great interest in t-ls study of
germs. He said: "If science can pre
vent the spread of diseases which have
devastated whole continents no task
can be too great to be attempted. Dr.
Koch was one of the first to investigate
on these lines. He started with the
theory that contagious or infectious
diseases "are caused each by its own
germ or microbe. Medical science was
elate, comes from St. George's, where
he labored with Dr. Rainsford, and I
think' he has found the work a labor of
love and thanksgiving."

Dr. Parent, in speaking of the experi

as yet by science of bubonic plague. I
suppose It is partly because the dis

any great medical schools. Probably
a stronger reason is that the disease
is so virulent and so much dreaded
that most doctors let it alone. Those
who have studied it have usually gone
to India, as did the professors of Vi

"Is it particularly virulent?"
"Yes. Maybe more virulent than any

The emancipation of woman proceeds

since then has held a whole country

road.

had a double gang plow cutting a fur
row twenty-four inches wide. He would
start at a corner of the field in San
Francisco and plow south toward San
Jose, a distance of forty miles. Then
he would come back and cut another
furrow to San Francisco, making
eighty miles for the round trip.
This amount of work would only be a
tiny scratch four feet wide along one
side of the forty-mile field, and the
process would have to be reneated at
least 1300 times, making a total dis
tance of about 105,000 miles.
Suppose that the plowman worked at
the rate of twenty miles a day. To get
over the 105,000 miles would take 5250
days. To plant would take about the
same time, maJdng a total of 10.500

OUR NEXT WHEAT CROP AND ITS PRICE.
BY UNITED' STATES SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE WILSON,
Special to The Sunday Call.
TRAVELING on the luxurious
train of the President of the
United States, through the fer
tile fields of lowa, which line
the Burlington road, a few days
ago, I talked with the Secre
tary of Agriculture about the predic
tion of Sir William Crookes of England,
that in a few years the world's pro
duction of wheat will be unequal to the
world's demand, and we shall have to
turn to artificial food products for sus
tenance. Secretary Wilson says Pro
fessor Crookes is all wrong and there is
no cause to fear that the wheat supply
will give out.
â crookes' theory," said Secretary
Wilson, "is based on the belief that
the fields of America are losing their
productiveness because they are giv
ing us only twelve bushels to the acre.
That is a mistake. The fields of lowa
could produce twenty-five bushels to
the acre if the farmers could afford to
sow them in wheat. lowa alone could
produce thirty or forty million bushels
of wheat. So could Illinois. But the
farmer of lowa finds it more profitable
to sow his fields in something that will
make meat in his herds or flocks or
milk for his dairy. It is only the pio
neer who can afford to grow wheat and
his land is not the most productive.
That is the reason the average of pro
duction is so low. Put the price of
wheat at a dollar and the lowa farmer
will cultivate it."
"What could the United States pro
duce at a pinch? " I asked.
"A couple of hundred million bushels
more than it does now. Crookes'
theory is like that of Malthus, who liv
ed a hundred years ago. He claimed
that population increased in geometri
cal ratio and production in arithmetical
ratio, and that in a certain time popu
lation would be out of proportion to
production and the world would starve, i
He wrote a book to prove this, but
time has shown that he was all wrong.
You can't base any theory on popula
tion, because it does not follow any
rule.
"As men grow rich they are less
likely to have large families. In the
rich quarter of the town you will find j
few children. In the half-starved j
quarter they are few. Among the
common people you will find many chil
dren and in the country they have large I
families. The increase of population \
lis governed by conditions. In France
there is no increase of population and
there has not been for some years."
"What is the annual production of
wheat in the United States?"
"It will be about 650,000,000 bushels
this year. The commercial agencies
make it 700,000,000, but we don't agree
with that estimate. We have ten agents
in the field to their one and we won't
do any guessing ahead at this time of
year to please any one. I have no doubt
the people who want to buy w^heat
would like to have us make a big esti
mate, but we won't do it. The wheat
crop of the world is going to be splen- ;
did this year. But it finds us with j
empty bins and no reserve. For that
reason I believe the price of wheat will
go higher.
"Another thing the theorists about j
crop conditions don't consider," said the
Secretary, "is the improvement in i
friends however, assert that from what
they know of the recent Improvements
he has made In the turbine system of
propulsion, and from the plans of the
new boats, they will make fifty, and
possibly sixty, miles an hour. The Tur
binia had 2100 horsepower, so that the
two new boats will each be five times
more powerful.
The steam of the Turbinia was pro
duced by a water tube boiler. The to
tal weight of other machinery, includ
ing turbines, auxiliary engines, con
densers, boilers, propellers, shafts,
tanks and the water in the boilers, was
twenty-two tons. Thus, about one hun
lred horse-power was attained per tÂ«>n

power per ton of displacement. This
beats all records.
metnoas or proaucuon wnicn is oeing
spread among the farmers every year
by the Agricultural Department and
through the agricultural colleges. The
farmer is learning every year how to
get more out of his land. He is learn
ing for example how to conserve the
water supply. Irrigation is going to
make fertile some of our barren land,
but only so far as the water supply will
go. We can dam the rivers whose
waters are now going to waste and
store up some against a future need.
But more than that, we can make fertile
now without irrigation land which a
few years ago would have been called
a desert. Science shows that soil needs
no more than six inches of rain to make
it productive. All else that falls on it
is evaporated. If six Inches of rain fell
in a day much of it would evaporate in
the natural course and only a small
part would remain. But the farmer to
day spreads dust over his newly
watered field and so keeps the moisture
from disappearing. Besides, we are in
vestigating constantly to find what
kinds of grain will grow best in certain
climates with a view to increasing pro
duction. I have a man in Russia now
getting seeds for experimental planting
in this country."
When Secretary Wilson took charge
of the Agricultural Department he un
dertook- a number of investigations
through special agents. He tells me
that the eighteen months' experience of
the department has proved the entire
correctness of his ideas.
"We have proved to the people of
England," he said, "that we can send
them the best dairy products they have
ever seen. Just now we are introduc
ing American butter and cheese into
China and Japan."
"Do you think the Chinese can be
persuaded to eat our butter?"
"Certainly. They don't eat any but
ter now, but when they have tried it
they will want it as they will want our
meats and other food products. Give
a man something good to eat and you i
cultivate the taste for it. The Chinese
will take our butter and in time our j
cheese. You must remember, too, that
not all the people of China are natives
of that country."
In scanning the columns of the daily
press the majority of people give the
news of the crops in official form bare
ly a passing glance, but to the student
I of the crops of the United States these
I form the pages of the text book, by
I means of which he gains the necessary
I knowledge upon which to predicate an
j intelligent opinion. Secretary Wilson
and his staff of experts are students of
just this sort of knowledge, except that
they have far more laid before them
every day than any newspaper could
possibly print. Mr. Wilson's statisti
cian is John Hyde, and it is his duty to
collate all the figures that come from
the department's agents throughout
the country, discard the chaff and pol
ish the kernel of the grain so that it
will attract the attention it deserves.
Mr. Hyde says that the total pro
duction of corn in the United States
last year was 1,902,967,933 bushels, or
more than 16 per cent less than the
yield of the year before, while the area j
of production was almost a million |
acres less. Yet, in spite of these facts, ;
on the basis of the farm price, the net
value of that decreased crop was more
than ten millions of dollars greater
than the big crop of 1896. Of course
The Turbinia, as exhibited last sum
mer, was unable to stop, unable to turn
and unable to go backward. Mr. Par
sons therefore withdrew her to New
castle-on-Tyne. There he has succeed
ed in producing a turbine steamer
which can reverse as easily as the or
dinary steamer.
The Turbinia has been given a public
demonstration before a board of naval
experts to show what she can accom
plish. Mr. Parsons recently brought
her to a standstill within thirty-seven
seconds while traveling at the rate of
thirty knots. He has also recently
made the Turbinia, with her new re
versing system, go at the rate of seven
and a half knots backward. He has
also proved that she can turn as easily
as the ordinary steamer.
The Parsons system of turbine pro
pulsion is highly ingenious. Inside a
steel case or tube five feet long and
only eight inches in diameter there is
arranged a small regiment of tiny tur
bines.
These are so set that as each revolves
it comes in contact with partitions
fixed to the interior of the steel case or
tube.
Between the revolving blades and the
fixed ones there is just space enough
for steam to steal through. This steam
is admitted to the tube by means of a
valve.
After turning the first turbine it is
projected on to the next, and is whirled
from one to the other with ever in
creasing force until, by the time it
escapes from the opposite end of the
tube, it has by its pressure on the
blades turned the shaft on which they
are placed at the rate of 2500 to 3000
revolutions a mi-nute.
Mr. Parsons in a recent interview
said: "I believe that a liner of 15,000
tons can be built with engines like the
Turbinia's capable of running between
Sandy Hook and Roches Point in three
days.
"She will burn pretty well three time?
as much coa. per day as the present
iiic rrup in is^o is me largest on record
and the crop of 1897 has only been ex
ceeded in the history of this country;
six different years.
The experts claim that these facts in
dicate more than proof of the oftmade
statement that a lesser crop is more
profitable than a greater. They show:
a stronger; a wider and a constantly;
developing market for American ce
reals that comparatively few of the
sharp-eyed people of this country real
ize. Another very interesting fact that
was demonstrated by Mr. Hyde is that
there has been a big increase in corn
crops of the cotton States west of Ala
bama, as well as in Illinois, Missouri,
Nebraska, Kansas, New Mexico and
California. The only great increase in
acreage, however, was in Kansas and
Texas, the latter State increasing its
corn area by more than half a million
acres.
All these facts pertain to the corn
crop. Mr. Hyde tells us even more in
teresting .facts than those quoted about
the wheat crop, facts that demonstrate
very clearly the truth of what Secre
tary Wilson said to me. For instance,
the wheat area actually harvested in
1897 was nearly five million acres more
than had been reported as under culti
vation. So thoroughly did this fact
throw the calculations of the depart
ment people out of plumb that it was
found to be impossible to make a satis
factory comparison of yields with the
results of the farmers' labors in 1898.
So Mr. Hyde says that the best thing
we can do is to go back to the eleventh,
census and with the figures there se
cured make comparisons that have
nothing about them which could bÂ«
termed odious.
This action brings out in strong re
lief the continued western movement
of the center of production, and also
the continued tendency toward concen
tration. Take the country east of the
Mississippi, for instance. Only six
States show a larger wheat acreage
than they had the eleventh census, atid
the total of such increase is only 377,462
acres. On the other hand, every State
west of the Mississippi, with the single
exception of Missouri, shows an in
crease. Kansas' acreage is greater by
1,500,000; Minnesota, 1,200,000; Nebraska,
1,000,000; Oregon and Oklahoma, 500.
000 each; Washington and California,
each 400.000. It is a curious truth that
appears when the yield in the two Da*,
kotas is contrasted. ihe northern is
apparently at a standstill, while the
southern comes to the front with an in
crease of over 400,000 acres.
Looking back again at the increase
the position of the Pacific Cxiast is
worthy of note, for the wheat crop of
California. Oregon and Washington ag
gregated 70,673,690 bushels, or 13.3 per
cent of the total crop of the country.
The Mark Lane Express tells of the
Insectivora Food Company of London,
which is selling a new food product
called preserved tropical flies. These
flies are caught in the swamps and
lakes of South American countries by
spreading nets over the water during"
the night. The flies are then dried,
pressed and shipped to England to be
sold as poultry food. The eggs of these
flies, which are about the size of poppy
seeds, are also collected and sold as
chicken food.

Emperor William of Germany on His Way Through
the Holy Land,
THE Emperor William II of Ger
many,, accompanied by the Em
press, is making a pilgrimage
to the Holy Land.
No one acquainted with the
character of William will doubt
that the entire processional will be a
continuous spectacle of. splendor .
Why does he go to Jerusalem?
"I think it is mostly to visit the very
interesting country," said Mr. Oswald
I.ohun, German Vice ConsuL :There
is no reason why the Emperor and.' Em
press should not enjoy the trip just as
hundreds of private individuals do
every year. Ha is going to be. pres
ent at the dedication of the Church of
Our Savior, as his father was at the
laying of its cornerstone. 1 have no
official notification of the absence of
the Emperor, but as the Empress ac
companies him it is little likely that
the object of the visit is political."
The Kaiser is ambitious. He has
been trying to find some opening to
fame, but there has seemed little for
him to do.
Owing to the waning life of the Pope
it has been suggested that William's
mission to Jerusalem has for its ob
ject the proclamation of himself as the
head of the church of Germany. Czar
Nicholas is the supreme ht-ad both of
Btate and church in Russia, and the
Kaiser watches the young Czar with
envious eyes.
Be that as it may, the Emperor is
making a magnificent tour to the Holy
Lund.
He does not go as did Richard Coeur
de Lion, with an army of fighting men
at his b.-ick. In William's train is an
army of prelates, stat" fhlnlsters,
retaries, artists, courtiers, couriers,
pages, cooks and personal attendants.
To transport the impedimenta loOfl'
horses and mules are required.
' The sea journey is made in the
royal yacht the Hohenzollern, .but a
greater portion of the land journey the
Kaiser intends to make on h"rseback..
Every city through which the royal
train must pass is guarded and every
care is taken to protect the royal ones
from the anarchists. Already two
plots have been discovered to assassi
nate the Emperor. â¢ /';. " â¢
It was intended at first that he
should visit Egypt, but as European af
fairs are not at rest the head of the
German Empire could not be* absent
from home so lons, so the Egyptian
visit was abandoned. Then an an
archist was captured, and from the pa
pers captured with him it was found
that a conspiracy had been formed v.
kill the royal couple by the explosion
of a bomb. In the almost impassably
narrow streets of Cairo a fanatic was
to throw a bomb of guncotton and ful
minate of m^rcur-- Into the carriage,
carrying death to every one near.
When William decided not to. go to
Cairo the plan of death was changed
&-a tne V-- â -Â \, aras tc be' thrown dur
ing the ceremony of the dedication of
the Church of Our Savior.
Again, on Monday, an anarchist was
found with plans of an assassination.
Then followed an edict that veiled wo
men should not be allowed abroad In
any city through which William was
passing. The loose, long veil is an
excellent disguise, and the anarchists
might avail themselves of It. As a Mo
hammedan woman may not go unveiled
this order will mean that the women
must stay at home.
When the royal fleet entered the
Dardanelles it was joined by two
patched up vessels" of the decrepid
Turkish fleet bearing envoys with
greetings from the Sultan to the Em
peror and inviting him to rest and ac
cept entertainment in Constantinople.
A royal palace had been prepared with
lavish outlay to be placed at the serv
ice of the couple and their suite. , . '
When the Christian- and Mohamme
dan, .monarchs nipt they kissed. . The
Sultan bowed low over the Empress*
white hand and laid upon it his royal
lips, an honor never before accorded
to any Christian woman by the Mo
hammedan Sultan. . >;V
The city had been cleaned and decor
ated Whole streets of picturesque neg
! lect were furbished up with red or blue
: "i: yellow paint. Streets were paved,
-and never did the Turks behold such
| illuminations before. From a hill the
i veiled women of the town viewed the
[ pageants. Although every mark of
' honor was paid to the German Empress
'< no woman of the Sultan's household
j greeted her or bore her company at the
banquets or functions. At the grand
[ banquet the Sultan occupied a seat of
state with the royal guests one on
either side.
When the long banquet was ended
j the Kaiser went to make his farewell
visits to the Ministers of State. At the
same time the Sultan and his eldest son
accompanied the Empress to the home
i of the Turkish women and childrenâ
the harem. Even the Emperor of Ger
many might not. look upon the face of
i any of the women of the harem. The
young daughter of the Sultan acted as
Interpreter,' and a pleasant hour was
passed.
The programme for the entire two
i months of absence from Germany has
i been carefully prepared by the court
{ chamberlain as follows:
October 26 the Hohenzollern will
I arrive at. Haifa. At that point will be
! gin the long' drive over the Plain of
Sharon, where the roses .are the most
: beautiful in all the world and now in
blossom in great gardens, to be gath
ered soon for making attar of roses. At
night the tents will be pitched outside
the town of Caesarea, whence St. Paul
set out on his journey to Tarsus.
The royal tents are not mere tents,
but houses of canvas, containing many
rooms and every luxury.
Most of the journey into the Holy
Land the Kaiser will make on his white
horse, presented to him by the Sultan.
jHe will be dressed in the gorgeous
I canary colored uniform and surrounded
Iby his bodyguard, also dressed in
I canary color, no one of whom is under
6 feet 3 inches. He carries- fifty new
uniforms for the pageants and wears no
sackcloth under any of them.
October 27â The journey will be con
tinued over the Plain of Sharon to
Jaffa, the travelers stopping at the
places on the way where the apostles
walked and talked.
October 29â Entry into Jerusalem.
K:ea on the way where the apostles

Before the Jaffa gate the Emperor
1 will dismount and will be received into
1 Jerusalem by German girls dressed in
white muslin trimmed with moire silk
and carrying Marechal Niel roses and
lilies of the valley, the favorite flowers
of the Empress. â¢
After the German maidens have
passed the Emperor will be received by
a guard of Turkish soldiers and by the
Bishops of the Roman, Greek, Ar
menian, Catholic and Protestant
churches of Jerusalem. The spectacle
will be as magnificent as is in the im
agination of man to conceive. -
October 30 the royal pilgrims will at
tend divine service at the Church of
the Holy S.epulcher the visible result
of the crusade?. The church was built
In the fourth century by the Emperor
| Constantine and has been the. Mecca of
hundreds of pilgrims from every Chris
tian country, not excepting America.
It is one of the oldest Christian
i churches in the world. This church is
j built on the tomb of our Savior, and
beneath is the grotto of the sepulcher,
only six and a half feet long by six
feet wide and very low. Here are the
forty-three precious lamps maintained
by the different churches of Christen
dom.

gotha) is near, and here is shown the
Hole in which was inserted the cross.

NEW CURE FOR THE TOBACCO HABIT.
Dr. Sydney Flower says that by simply eating peanuts and following certain directions in mental training the craving for
tobacco can be stopped.
HOWEVKR fantastic my particu
lar method of dealing with the
tobacco habit may seem on pa
per, It will effect a cure if faith
fully carried out. In the first
place, be sure that your patient really
desires to break off the habit of using
tobacco. In the second place, remem
ber that your patient will react accord
ing to the impression your manner
makes upon his mind. If you speak
lightly of your method of treating him
he will hold that method in small es
teem. Therefore, speak impressively,
and If he smiles at your modus op
erandi frown him into a decent humil
ity.
Suggestion alone is not sufficient to
hold the average tobacco user, and you
will therefore add a material medicine
in the shape ofâ peanuts! Yes, my
friend, ludicrous as the Idea seems,
there lies In the vulgar peanut a charm
to sap the power of My Lady Nicotine
and free the fettered slave.
In all drug habits there are two con
ditions to combatâ physical and mental.
or physiological and.peychologica.l. I
use peanuts to offset the physical crav
ing and suggestion to calm the mind.
What is the condition of the user of
tobacco if the weed is withdrawn? It
is important to understand this, be
Savior. !
The church which the Emperor has
traveled all the way from Germany to
Jerusalem to see dedicated is one built
at the cost of $300,000 by Germany for
her subjects in Jerusalem. It is thought
most significant that the Emperor has
selected October 31 for the dedication,
as it is the anniversary of the day â 
when Martin Luther nailed his twenty- '
cause there is but a slight variation in
one dozen cases from the average.
The condition is one of mental un
rest, some physical sensations and ner
vousness. The withdrawal of tobacco
acts as a withdrawal of a powerful
nerve tonic, because this weed, used
first as a nerve spdarive, becomes by
force of usage a nerve stimulant. Let
us take the mental condition first under
consideration. I do not try to put a
tobacco user to sleep, because it is an
unnecessary performance, but give him
positive suggestions whiie he is sitting
opposite me to the following effect:
1. That it will be easy to break him
of the habit.
2. That he will not suffer, despite the
fact that he has tried to break off pre
viously, but has failed on account of
the discomfort ensuing.
3. That he Is not a hero or a being to
be pitied or sympathized with, because
he will not be calied upon to display
any heroic qualities of endurance.
4. That If he follows directions he will
not Buffer from nervousness or "sink
ings" at the nit of the stomach.
5. That he will begin at once to gain
In weight; that his memory will be
sharper and more tenacious, and that
his digestive organs will regain tone;
that his nerves will be as steel, his
muscles as Iron and his complexion will
lose the muddy hue which mars its
comeliness.
6. That the habit Is uncleanlyâ ln
fact, degradingâ and that Its gratifica
tion entails a gross waste of money.

LAST DRAWING OF THE HAVANA LOTTERY
The advent of the Americans has ended Cuba's big gambling institution.
Special to The Sunday Call.
HAVANA, Ocf 27, 7898.
OInE of the most clearly marked
Indications of the coming <>f

passing of the Havana lottery.
Last Monday morning I wit

Us last drawing. According to the Gov
ernment schedule the. next drawing
should be held the first of next month,
but the exact date. has not yet been
advertised, and it is accepted as a fore
gone conclusion by almost every one
that before that time arrives "Los
Yankis" will have interfered and .driven
the lottery from Cuba forever.
The two institutions which always
best illustrated the state of the public
conscience and character in Cuba were
the bull fight and the lottery.
While the bull light was national and
traditionally- sacred, it was never gov
ernmental or political. Its existence
could be terminated by a single edict.
But with the lottery it was different,
lor this dignified, well managed gam
bling institution was one of .the chief
Cuban sources of revenue for the Span
i b crown.
The lottery here was a Government
Institution just as much was the cus
tom house or postoffice. Its profits were
the most infallible of the indirect taxes,
its management and operation consti
tuted one of the departments of the
colonial administration.
I 'ill ike the !aie Louisiana lottery, for
example, none of the profits were ever
given to charitable institutions. Every

nually derived from the Havana lottery
was turned over to the Secretary of the
Treasury, which is. another way of say
ing that they were sent to Spain, be
cause the Idea of spending in Cuba any
of the revenues that came from the
Island has always been entirely foreign
to the Spanish theory of governing.

ers, the only vent far the gaming spirit,
always strong in the Latin race, was
the Government lottery, which has
done a thriving business ever since it
started.
It is a difficult matter to ascertain
the exact amount of revenue that has
been obtained from the lottery, because
stories are told about other prominent
Californians. but little credence can be
given to any of them.
But the fact remains that the camels
were brought here. On all the points
connected with this part of the story
the old-timers agree.
It was in the old days when the Com-
Btock was in its glory. The days before
the railroad; when Virginia City was
almost as important a town as San
Francisco. Old-timers heave deep sighs
full at heartrending meaning when
they think of them.
It so happened that a certain group
of mines about twenty-five or thirty
miles out of Virginia City was panning
out piles of rich ore. It was impossible
to put up a mill close to the mines on
account of lack of water.
Mules were put to the work, and dur
ing the winter months did fairly well,
although to feed and care for them was
a terrorizing expense. It must be un
derstood that as dry, rocky and barren
a desert as there is on the face of the
earth lay between Virginia City and
the mines. To use a vehicle of any
kind was out at the question, and so
the ore was carried in bags slung over
the backs of the animals.
both its prizes and income have from
time to time been paid in gold or silver
or paper currency, as the price of the
different kinds of money was most ad
vantageous for the Government.
The accounts were last kept on a gold
basis in 1892. During that year the
amount of revenue paid into the treas
ury from the lottery was $1,957,124.
Since then, according to the reports
! in the Treasury Department, the earn
ings of the lottery, paid sometimes in
silver and sometimes In paper, have
been as follows:
18&3 $1 ,811,698 1896 $1,036,7(59
1894 1,588,744 1597 1,446,564
1895 1,218,422
Drawings usually took place three
times a month. For each 12,000 tickets
were offered for sale at $10 each for
the entire ticket, or 50 cents each for
any one of the twenty sections into
which it was subdivided. Three
quarters of the receipts were distrib
uted In premiums and one-quarter was
retained by the Government, which took
also all prizes drawn on unsold tick
ets. The first prize at each drawing
was $50,000. From that amount they
ranged down to 500 prizes of $60 each.
. By a complicated system of agencies
that reached to every village of Cuba,
lottery tickets were on sale every
where. There agents hired sub-agents
to peddle tickets in the streets and pub
lic places.
One of the favorite methods for re
concentrado children to earn a few
cents a day was to sell tickets for some
sub-agent. Their shrill voices crying,
"Good numbers; sure to win prizes,"
could be heard on every corner. Lot
tery tickets were far more easy to ob
tain in Havana than postage-stamps.
It is scarcely an exaggeration to say
that every one more than 15 years of
age in Cuba played in the lottery. In
every position of the mercantile, pro
ffssional or social life of the island
uund the same green and purple
tickets with their big black numbers.
Some years ago reports became cur
rent here of fraud and corruption in the
administration of the lottery. As a re
sult an ingenious system of conducting
the drawings was devised that is said
to be the only one of its kind in the
world.
The drawing on Monday took place in
a low, one-story shed in the courtyard
of the Palace of the Treasury. The
shed is plain enough on the outside, but
is handsomely furnished. A large, high
tribune, or platform, occupies about
half the room. On the rear wall hangs
a lifesize .portrait of the boy King of
Spain, in the uniform of a Captain-
General of Cuba. Directly beneath the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1898.
THE LONG STRING OF CAMELS WERE LOADED WITH SACKS
OF ORE AND SENT TRAMPING ACROSS THE DESERT
FROM THE MINES TO THE MILLS.
From the first it was apparent that
the mule plan was not a success. In
the summer it took about two mules to
carry water for the one that carried
ore. And all the while the animals
kept dying. The intense heat and dry
sandy air was too much for them and
they fell by the waysiae so fast that a
new band was required almost weekly.
But the ore had to be carried t<> the
mill, for there was "millions in it."
At this juncture some genius sug
gested that the miners buy camels for
the work. So the camels were bought
at great expense. Some of them were
obtained from the veteran showman,
P. T. Barnum, and about twenty came
direct from Asia Minor under the care
of an agent dispatched from Virginia
City.
From the first the camels did all
that was expected of them. Each
morning they would eat a meager
breakfast of any old weed that hap
pened in their way, drink a few gallons
of water and were ready for business.
Two bags of ore, each containing be
tween 300 and 500 pounds, were
strapped to the back over the hump of
each camel.
When the train was ready all started
off at once, striking a good swinging
gait that was kept up until the mill
was reached. The drivers had nothing
to do but follow the train. No stopping
for water, no urging, no beatings. The
faithful beasts did their work willingly.
When the ore was dumped the camels
took another big drink and were turned
loose, being permitted to make their
way back to the mine at their own
pleasure. Very rarely did one of them
fail to be on h.and the next morning
ready to take another load to the mill.
The camel train was a strange sight
picture is a long, semi-circular tabie,
covered with crimson velvet. At the
center of the table sat Senor Ramon
Espinosa and the Conde de la Re
union, who, as representatives of the
Treasurer, preside at the drawings.
Beside them, as assistants, were dele
gates from six of the municipal depart
ments of the Government.
Although drawings invariably begin
at 7:30 o'clock in the morning, a crowd
began to gather on the benches in front
of the platform long before that hour
and chatter over the tickets which ap
parently each one had brought with
him.
Senor Espinosa touched a bell on the
table as a signal that the drawing had
begun. A clerk unlocked a big wooden
box and from it took out six long
strings of wooden marbles. Two pub
lic criers announced to the crowd that
the marbles were numbered and repre
sented the tickets which had been is
sued. "If any one has any doubt as to
the fairness of this distribution," they
said, "let him come forward and ex
amine the marbles; if not, let him com
plain of no unfairness." No one ac
cepted the invitation. Every one
seemed convinced that the drawing
was the model of fairness the criers
proclaimed it to be.
The marbles were taken off the
strings and deposited in a basket in
front of the velvet covered table. From
another box several smaller strings oÂ£
marbles were taken. Each one of them
was marked with the amount of one of
the premiums. These smaller strings
were counted in the presence of the
audience by the supervisors of the
drawing.
A negro took his place in front of a
large, odd looking apparatus that was
not unlike an American spiral grain
conveyer. The ticket marbles were
thrown into it, and the negro began to
turn a crank. The marbles rose higher
and higher, jangling and clashing as
they went, until they finally dropped
Into an enormous brass globe on one
side of the platform. The prize marbles
went by the same process into, another
globe on the other side of the platform.
The object of this, Mr. Espinosa ex
plained to me, was to thoroughly mix
the marbles, so that no one would have
the slightest idea of their position in
the globes, and thus preclude any pos
sibility of cheating.
Attendants took their places in front
of the two globes. By means of valves
attached to each they allowed the
marbles to fall out one at a time.
From an anteroom at the rear of the
platform two boys from the Havana
while en route across the desert. From
a distance the general effect was that
of a scene in Persia. There was noth
ing lacking, the intense blue sky, the
blinding white sand and the distant
mountains showing dimly through a
faint, purple haze. Many a traveler,
seeing the sight for the first time,
has stopped and rubbed his eyes, won
dering if he were not suffering with
some temporary mental aberration.
But all this changed when the rail
road came. Then the camels' work was
over. The iron horse displaced them,
and once more the owners began to
puzzle over a serious question. "What
was to be done with the camels?
The herd hud been increased by sev
eral young ones. Nearly all the in
fants, however, died the first winter.
Then an effort was made to sell the
whole lot. But Barnum did not want
them and nobody else cared to load up
on camels.
For months the patient beasts waited
around their old corral ready and will
ing to do any work that might be given
them. But there was none for them to
do and finally the owners turned them
loose to get their living as best they
could.
It was several months before they
ventured far from their old home, but
in time they managed to wander all
over the deserts of Arizona and even,
into Mexico and New Mexico.
At first f me of the bold cowboys
thought to have fun with the meek
sad-looking camels that crossed their
tracks. But they never tried it a sec
ond time. It was always somewhat dif
ficult to make a cow-pony get near
enough to a camel to throw- a rope over
its neck. But the trick was often done
and the cowboy settled back in his
Orphan Asylum were led out and sta
tioned by the two globes.
The two attendants worked in con
cert. Every* time a ticket marble fell
on one side of the room its correspond
ing prize marble would fall on the
other. The boys would in turn shout
out first the number of the marble and
then, the amount that had been won by
the ticket it represented, depositing the
marbles on the dejk of a clerk, who sat
in front erf the table.
Every fifteen minutes the globes would
be turned over, in order to further mix
their contents.
The cool of the morning had passed
by this time. The day was hot, as
nearly all Havana days are. The men
at the valves perspired and fanned.
The boys' voices grew husky. The in
creasing crowd listened nervously and
anxiously for the announcement of the
number that had drawn the first prize.
Finally the marble that represented it
fell from the globe. A recess of ten
minutes was taken. The boys were led
away and two more took their places.
The drawing was resumed until all the
prize marbles had been exhausted.
"The last!" cried the man at the smaller
globe. Senor Espinosa arose and said,
as he rang the bell for the last time:
"The day's drawing of the Government
lottery of Havana is over. You have
seen that it was just and fair."
The prizes are distributed to the win
ners from the office of the Secretary of
the Treasury on the day following the
drawing-.
In speaking of the lottery, the Conde
de la Reunion told me to-day that the
receipts had fallen off very materially
since the American occupation of East
ern Cuba. Santiago, he said, was for
merly one of the best markets for the
sale of lottery tickets.
"I do not very well see," said the
Conde, "how the United States Govern
ment can dispense with the lottery
without causing great dissatisfaction
throughout Cuba. We are as much ac
customed to buying lottery tickets as
postage stamps. Savings banks have
never been a success in the island. One
was tried several years ago in Havana,
but it failed miserably and its president
committed suicide. Cubans are accus
tomed to putting their snare money
into the lottery as an investment. Any
man who plays continuously and per
severingly is almost certain to get back
more money than he has paid into the
lottery, besides always having a chance
of winning a prize that will make him
comfortably rich for life."
The Conde de la Reunion, who is a
large plantation owner and one of the
leading autonomists in Havana, voiced
the Spanish and Cuban opinion of the
lottery.
It is exceedingly doubtful whether
American eyes will ever view this time
honored institution in the same light.

antics of the beast.
But about a moment later the cow
boy generally thought the country had
been struck by a oyotone. His horse
was jerked from .under him and usually
dragged to death unless the lariat
fortunately broke. The cowboy bumped
the ground pretty hard and in some
oases came to in time to witness th>
end of his horse or possibly see the
bruised animal lying on the sand and
the saddle following a camel into the
distance. A cow-pony could no more
hold one of the Comstock camels than
it could a steam engine, and the cow

learned a lesson that he never forgot.

SPANIARDS MAKING A "CLEAN-UP" IN CUBA
Business in suspense; garrjbling and corruption on all sides.
Sfecial to The Sunday Call.
HAVANA, Oct. 27.â Business in
Cuba is in a state of suspense,
of complete stagnation. No
progress in any industrial
branch is to be expected un
tii the political status of the
island becomes fixed and stable. Cu
bans, Spanish and Americans, mer
chants of all nationalities, are simply
waiting for the Spanish troops to get
out and the American soldiers to come
in. Meanwhile the era of progress is
being postponed by the eternal manana
of the Spanish Evacuation Commission
ers. The American Commissioners find
little to do except to go fishing and
shark hunting, while the patriotic Span
ish officers of all ranks are trying to
fill their pockets with the loot that is
to be carried off when the final manana
comes around.
Rt/bbing the people, cheating the Gov
ernment, stealing public funds, picking
private pockets, fleecing the lambs
called strangers, plucking the geese
called promoters; these are the occupa
tions of the Spanish military officials,
of the Spanish civil authorities and of
Spanish and Cuban merchants at pres
ent.
Corruption is practiced openly, even
ostentatiously, like the charity of the
hypocritical. If one dc-Ã¼bts this he has
only to walk down to the machina, the
Custom-house wharf, to find the proof.
Here he may see, as the correspondent
did the other day, blacks at work un
loading sacks from the lighters. The
sacks were labeled "charcoal," but the
process of piling them in heaps on the
wharf scattered a fine white dust. This
does not mean that white charcoal has
beeen invented, for when the corre
spondent dipped his fingers in the white
dust and tasted it he tasted flour. The
sacks were consigned to a Spanish im
porter in Manzanillo â a thousand sacks
of flour marked as charcoal. The infer
ence was clear that some one was
cheating the Government out of import
duties, or that the Custom-house offi
cials were permitting the Government
to be cheated.
Later, on presenting a letter of intro
duction to a well-known Cuban mer
chant in Havana, the correspondent
mentioned the flour which had come In
as charcoal. "Tut," said the merchant,
"that is a mere item. That -.man In
Manzanillo haa been receiving monthly
remaining ones always had a longing
for human companionship. They would
wander into the villages and frequently
would let the children be lifted on
their backs for a ride. Any village
would gladly have taken care of one or
two of the old camels, but they made it
troublesome for the horses. For some
reason a horse dislikes the smell of a
camel and so after a few days, to the
intense grief of the children, the ani
mals had to be driven out on the
desert again. Should a prospector
without a horse happen to be camping
in a lonely spot and one of the camels
come along It would exhibit all the
signs of perfect friendliness. Unless
the man drove the camel away it would
remain around the camp for weeks. It
always foraged for its own food and
water, but simply yearned to be near
shipments of that same charcoal for
years. The thing is easy. You see my
neighbor across the street. He cables
his buyer in New York to ship a thou
sand tierces of lard. The buyer gets
the consignment on board ship and
mails to Havana a manifest calling for
one thousand barrels of potatoes. Here
the custom-house inspector allows the
importer's drays to haul away the sup
posed barrel of potatoes, a cargo, upon
which there has been this difference in
tariff prices: A tierce of lard weighs
five hundred pounds, and the duty is
5 cents a pound; a barrel of potatoes
weighs only one hundred and fifty
pounds, and the duty is only 2 cents a
pound. The duty on the cargo of lard
would have amounted to 525,000, but the
amount paid for the cargo of potatoes
was only $3000. a saving of $22,000. In
consideration of this saving the custom
house inspector, of course, receives his
reward."
Such is the way business has been
conducted in Havana for years. Rob
bery of the Government has been so
systematized that it has become a sci
ence. With a termination of this state
of affairs in sight, the extent of bribery
now is almost beyond belief. In a stay
of a week or so a man who keeps his
eyes open can see a score of cases to be
explained only on the hypothesis of
bribery of officials. The largest and
most valuable cargoes dwindle to al
most nothing under the skillful hand
ling of the importers and the officers of
the port. The approaching end of va
rious sinecures is causing the partici
pants in benefits accruing from the
present system to neglect no opportu
nity. It is a case of "steal quickly, ,rrab
everything in sight, for soon we will
have to cut and run." Meantime, port
duties have been trebled, obsolete rules
have been revived and new rules
created. Importers who do not or will
not stand in with the custom-house
Inspectors have been obliged to suspend
business. For instance, the port duties
on a ton of flour, valued at $70, amount
to $42 50. A case of a dozen cans of
beans valued at 80 cents is taxed $2 30.
These exorbitant duties have been
imposed with the object of excluding,
as far as possible, all shipments of food,
the ulterior motive being one of which
the world at large is ignorant, namely,
the disposal of quantities of provisions
in the hands of the military govern
ment. The statement that, during the
war, the Spaniards In Cuba had no
supplies was quite erroneous. As a
matter of fact, the Spanish military
government, foreseeing the war, made
some human being. Camels and dogs
are nearly always good friends.
Six years ago the original herd of
thirty camels had dwindled down to â¢
two as n^ar as could be judged from
the people whj lived in the country
where the animals made their home.
That year one of the pair died and the
other was left alone. He was very old
even then because *c was at least ten
years old when he worked on the Corn
stock. An old ex-showman who saw
him when he last visited Phoenix placed
his age at at least seventy years.
Since then the beast has wandered
about, stopping as long as he was al
lowed at every place he could. His
feeble condition no 3oubt prompted the
Indians at Yuma to kill and eat him.
And so disappeared the last camel of
the Comstock.
immense shipments of foodTco all parts
of the island, stocking every store, and
! consigning goods to all the importers
i and jobbers. And now, with the end of
its domination in sight, the Spanish
j military government has still on hand
i about 25,000 sacks of flour, 15,000 barrels
| of beans, 10.000 boxes of Xorwegian cod
j fish and 1000 cases of condensed milk.
These goods are offered at prices be-
I low cost, are sold, in fact, at any figure,
| with the idea of turning everything:
into cash before the time comes to give
lan accounting. At the same time the
; stock in the hands of private dealers is
. spoiling for want of purchasers at even
| reasonable prices. And the Govern
; ment, as long as it has a pound of food
left, will continue to undersell the deal
ers.
Thus the' expulsion of a rotten gov
ernment is being marked by an epoch
of shameful intrigue, of under-handed
dealing and of wholesale lying an^,
cheating. Individuals are following
the example set by the Government,
and many a merchant in Havana, hon
est till now, will never be honest again.
No one asks questions, and each sim
ply pockets the money that comes his
way.
The feeding of the reeoncentrados.
has been a source of gain to nearly all I
who handle the money contributed
for the purpose. During the blockade
and up to the present time enough
money has been contributed in Ha
vana alone to feed every one of the
city's 30,000 reeoncentrados three
square meals a day. For instance,
8 cents a day buys enough food
for each hungry one. It is sufficient to
give each a quart of soup and half
a pound of bread daily. The money
was contributed by private subscrip
tions gathered by the Government's
agents â enough money to spend $2400
daily in giving the 30,000 poor their
8 cents' worth of food. But instead
of a quart of soup and half a pound
of bread daily, the reeoncentrados re
ceived a quart of soup and half a
pound of bread weekly. In other words,
the 8 cents for ea.eh starving one was
expended once every seven days in
stead of every day. The balance,
which was a magnificent amount, was
put down as "expense." This matter
will probably never be investigated,
although there are reliable witnesses
in the city who will testify that one
merchant alone has made $75,000 as his
share of the profits of feeding the poor.

AMERICANS IN WAR.
As Viewed
BY A GERMAN MILITARY EXPERT.
PBNERA'j YON BOGUSLAWS
KI, in the Berlin National Zei-
Utung, gives a series of critical
essays on the Spanish-American
war. This eminent military
critic on the whole thinks that the
American army did not cover itself
with glory, although it did quite as well
as could have been expected. At any
rate -the Americans proved themselves
a vigorous people, whose failures were
due to their military system rather
than to their character. His remarks
on the attitude of. the Spaniards are
more scathing. Not only did the Span
ish officers blunder in every particular,
but they exhibited a want of courage
â¢which reminded him of that pe.'od of
deep humiliation ever before the eyes
of a Prussian officerâ the war of ISO 6.
"We summarize General Boguslawski's
remarks ap follows:
It is a healthy theory which led Mar
shal Blanco to mass 3000 .to 4000 men
near threatened points; but in practice
one is inclined to attempt too much.
Besides, it is very difficult to move
tmops in Cuba during the rainy season.
But whatever the cause, it is not easy
to see why so few troops were near
Santiago, for an attack was to be ex
pected there, if only because the in
surgents were there strongest in num
ber. The Americans could easily have
been held near Santiago, especially as
they were lacking in cavalry, although
the insurgents in some measure sup
pled this want.
It seems incomprehensible' why Ad
miral Camara did not go to Cuba,
where his squadron would have evened
up matters to some extent. His trip to
Port Said was absolutely a tactical
mistake. The destruction of Cervera's
ships does not prove that these vessels
were not fitted for their work.. Their
armor was lighter, their artillery in
ferior to that of the Americans. In
spite of these disadvantages it should
have been possible for the Spaniards to
ram the Americans, if the former had
been spirited enough. The spirit of a

Then, full of a vague sense of calamity,
he sought the porter at the entrance to the

"Do you know that all the furniture is

went at once to Mr. Bessels apartment

Mr. Bessel did not return, and at last
Mr Vincent, having done some more
helpless staring, and having addressed a
note of brief inquiry and left it in a con
spicuous position on the bureau, returned
in a very perplexed state of mind to his
own premises in Staple Inn.
For a space he lay awake and trem

â  vague unaccountable terror of unknown
possibilities that comes out of dreams i
upon even the bravest men. But at last
he roused himself, and turned over and â

He awoke with such a strong conviction j
that Mr Bessel was in overwhelming dis

his friend had rushed out to some dire i

may not influence an able military
commander. Very often they are only
mentioned to conceal weakness and
want of decision, as unfortunately the
history of Prussia shows, when, in 1806,
a number of commandants surrendered
to Napoleon I. Not only military glory
but substantial advantages could have
been reaped if Santiago had followed
the example of Saragossa. The long
resistance of Kolberg, Kosel, Graud-nz
and Danzig was of great value to Prus
sia. ,
No doubt the Americans possess
courage. endurance and physical
strength in a large degree. Esprit de
corps, obedience and punctuality, all
, very necessary military attributes â
they cannot acquire in time of peace
with their present system; and with
out these they cannot well realize their
wish for expansion, however much
their national pride may have risen.
That the Spaniards have courage, en
durance and patriotism they have
shown often enouerh but their parlia
mentary institutions undoubtedly hurt
the army.
Spain has been advised to conclude
peace, and for the sake of trade and
industry peace is devoutly to be
wished. Yet it should not be forgotten
that posterity Judges a nation's right to
I exist solely by Its resistance in war,
and, even if the war is unlucky, by the
fortitude with which It is borne.
The Spaniards are not to be blamed
if they are unwilling to evacuate a
province in which they have 100.000
men who have not yet been beaten, and
even their Government is bound to
defend their warlike honor. Only a
people who are great in adversity need
not give up the hope of better times in
the future. ,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1898.
By H. G. WELLS
But he never got there. As he was g'>lng
down Long Acre some unaccountable im
pulse turned him aside out of that street
toward Covcnt Garden, which was Just
waking to its nocturnal acitivlties. He
saw the market In front of him, a queer
effect of glowing yellow lights and busy
black figures. He became aware of a
shouting and perceived a figure turn the
corner by the hotel and run swiftly t>>
ward him. He knew at once that it was
Mr. Basel. But it was Mr. Bessel trans
figured. He was batless and disheveled,
his collar was torn open, he grasped a
bone-handled walking cane by the ferule
end, and his mouth was pulled awry. He
ran with agile strides and very rapidly.
Their encounter was the affair of an in
stant. "Bessel!" cried Vincent.
The running man gave no sign of recog
nition, either of Mr. Vincent or of his own
name. Instead, he cut at his friend =u.v
agely with the stick, hitting him in the
face, within an inch of the eye. Mr. \ in
cent, stunned and astonished, staggered
back, lost his footing and fell heavily on
the pavement. It seemed to him that Mr.
Bessel leaped over him as he fell. When
he looked again Mr. Bessel had vanished
and a policeman and a number of garden
porters and salesmen were rushing past
toward Long Acre in hot pursuit.
With the assistance of several garden
portersâ fi-r the whole street was speed
ily alive with running peopleâ Mr. Vincent
struggled to his feet. He at once became !
the center of a crowd greedy to see his
injury. A multitude of voices competed
to reassure him of his safety, and then
to tell him of the behavior of the madman, |
as they regarded Mr. Bessel. He had sud
denly appeared in the middle of the mar- j
krt, screaming "Life! Life!" striking I
left and right with a blood-stained walk
ing stick, and dancing and shouting with
laughter at each successful blow. A lad i
and two women had broken heads, and he '.
had smashed a man's wrist, a little child ;
had been knocked insensible, and for a i
time he had driven every one before him,
so furious and resolute had his behavior i
been. Then he had made a raid upon a
coffee stall, hurled its parafflne flare |
through the window of the postofflce and i
fled laughing, after stunning the foremost I
of the two policemen who had the pluck

he said, "but I thought more of his
sire, Fuller George. I have owned
scores of good lively steppers, but
Fuller George was the best one of
them all. He was true as steel. His
temper was perfect. He was never in
bad condition. He was positively the
prettiest horse I ever saw. Best of all,
he was never beaten on the road.
"I shall never forget the day he out
trotted Small Hopes, driven on old
Harlem lane by Commodore Vander
bilt. Any old-timer will tell you that
Small Hopes was one of the crack step
pers of his day, his track record being
2:lBMi. My Fuller George had no track
record. None of my horses have been
track horses, since my only object in
owning fast horses has been that I
might, win pleasure and health by driv
ing them. But Fuller George was a
better footer than Small Hopes, as I
proved to the commodore one pleasant
June morning about twenty-five years
ago.
"A good many of the commodore's
friends had told him that Small Hopes
was all right, but he wasn't in the
same class as Fuller George. Vander
bilt pooh-poohed at that, of course.
But all the same, he understood full
well that his horse must beat mine or
be beaten sooner or later, and so he
was on the lookout for me.
"As I drove down the lane that
morning I saw the commodore sitting
up stiff and straight behind his pride
and joy, and I noticed that he had his
Bye on me and my horse. Small
Hopes had his eye peeled, too. High
bred horses know when their drivers
are getting ready to speed them as well
as the drivers do, and Small Hopes
was perfectly aware that he was about
to be tested. I was ready, of course,
and so was my horse. But, as I wished
to beat the commodore in my own way,
I let him drive up alongside me and
get almost a length ahead.
"When the hind wheels of his wagon
were about even with Fuller George's
head I stirred him up a little. Not by
yelling at him or by using the whip.
I just telegraphed along the reins by
a slight pressure of the left little fin
ger. My horse knew what that meant,
and from that on the commodore
could not increase the lead. The race
was fairly begun at One Hundred and
Forty-fifth street and it lasted till we
reached One Hundred and Twenty-fifth
â just a mile.
"The old Harlem clubhouae stood at
One Hundred and Thirty-third street,
and a short time before we arrived
there I telegraphed to Fuller George
to charge him.
It appeared to him indisputable that Mr.
Bessei must h;ive gone violently mad In
the midst of his experiment in thought
transference, but why that should make
him appear with a sad white face In Mr.
Vincent's dreams seemed a problem be
yond solution. He racked his brains In
vain to explain this. It seemed to him
at last that not simply Mr. Bessel but
the order of things must be insane.
About dawn his physical fatigue assert
ed itself and he went to bed and slept
at last in spite of his dreaming. Mr. Vin
cent's perplexities, to which the fever of
his bruise added fresh irritation, became
at last intolerable, and, after a fruitless
visit to the Albany, he went down to St.
Paul's churchyard, to Mr. Hart. Mr. Bes
sel'B partner, and, so far as Mr. Vincent
knew, his nearest friend.
He was surprised to learn that Mr.
Hart, although he knew nothing of the
outbreak, had also been disturbed by a
vision, the very vision that Mr. Vincent
had seen, Mr. Bessel, white and dis
heveled, pleading earnestly by his ges
tures for help. That was his impression
of the import of his signs. "I was just
going to look him up in the Albany when
you arrived," said Mr. Hart. "I was" so
sure of something being wrong with him."
As the outcome of their consultation
the two gentlemen decided to inquire at
Scotland Yard for newÃ of their missing
friend. "He is bound to be laid by the
heels," said Mr. Hart. "Ho can't go on at
that pace for long." But the police au
thorities had not laid Mr. Bessel by the
heels. They confirmed Mr. Vincent's
over-night experiences and added fresh
circumstances, some of an even graver
character than those he knewâ a list of
smashed glass along the upper, half of
Tottenham Court road, an attack upon a
policeman In Hampstead road and atro
cious assaults upon a number of peaceful
citizens. AH those outrages were com
mitted between 12:30 and 1:45 in the morn
ing, and between those hours, and, indeed,
from the very moment of Mr. Vessel's
eush from his rooms at 9:30 in the
g, they could trace the deepening
?e of his fantastic career. For the
)ur at least, from before 1, that is,
1:45. he had run amuck through
n, eluding with amazing agility
effort to stop or capture him.
.Nothing of his subsequent doings came
to light in spite of the keenest Inquiry.
Here was a fresh astonishment for Mr.
Vincent. He had found considerable com
fort in Mr. Hart's conviction, "He is
bound to be laid by the heels before long,"
and in that assurance ho had been able
to suspend his mental perplexities.
It was only on the following day, Sun
day, that Mr. Vincent thought of the
remarkable stories of Mrs. Bullock, the
medium, who was then attracting atten
tion for the first time in London. He de
termined to consult her. She was stop
ping at the house of that well-known in
quirer, Dr. Wilson Paget, and Mr. Vin
cent, although he had never mot that
gentleman before, repaired to him forth
with with the intention of invoking her
help. But scarcely had he mentioned the
name of Bessel when Dr. Paget inter
rupted him. "Last nightâ just at the end,"
he said, "we had a communication."
He left the room and returned with a
Blate on which were certain words writ
ten In a handwriting shaky indeed, but
indisputably the handwriting of Mr.
â¢â How did you get this?" said Mr. Vin
cent. "Do you mean â ?"
"We got "it last night." said Dr. Paget.
With numerous interruptions from Mr.
Vincent he proceeded to explain how the
writing had been obtained. It appears
that in her seances Mrs. Bullock passes
into a condition of trance, her eyes roil
ing up in a strance way under her eye
lids and her body becoming rigid. She
then begins to talk very rapidly, usually
in voices other than her own. At the
same time both of her hands may be
come Hctlve, and if slates and pencils are
provided they will then write messages
simultaneously with and quite independ
ently of the flow of words from per
mouth. By many pne Is< considered an
even more remarkable medium than the
celebrated Mrs. Piper. It was one of
these messages, the one written with her
left hand, that Mr. Vincent now had be
fore him. It consisted of eight words
written disconnectedly. "George Bessel
trial excavn Baker st help
starvation." Curiously enough, neither
Dr. Paget nor the two other inquirers
who were present had hoard of the- dis
appearance of Mr. Bessel â the news of It
appeared only in the evening papers of
Saturdayâ and they had put the message
aside with many others of a vague and
enigmatical sort that Mrs. Bullock had
from time to time delivered.
When Dr. Paget heard Mr. Vincent's
story he gave himself at once with great
energy to the pursuit of this clew to the
discovery of Mr. Bessel. It would serve
no useful purpose here to describe the in
quiries of Mr. Vincent and himself; suffice
it that the clew was a genuine one and
that Mr. Bessel was actually discovered
by its aid.
He was found at the bottom of a de
tached shaft which had been sunk and
abandoned at the commencement of the
work for the new electric railway near
Baker-street station. His arm and leg and
two ribs were broken. The shaft is pro
tected by a boarding nearly twenty feet
high, arid over this, incredible as It

again. Then he began to gain, inch by
inch, inch by inch. Just in front of
the clubhouse we were going a 2:18
clip, and you could have covered both
horses with a blanket, as the reporters
say. Vanderbilt looked across at me.
I telegraphed Fuller George again and
he jogged by easily. Then the com
modore began to call on Small Hopes,
and the horse went right up in the air.
There was quite a crowd at the club
house and every man in It howled till
he was hoarse. The commodore was
so sore about it that he never cared to
mention the circumstance.
"Commodore Vanderbilt, though a
skilled reinsman, was the most reck
less driver on the road in the old Har
lem lane days, and his collisions with
other drivers were frequent.
"The narrowest escape of my life i
was when the commodore ran into me. |
I was driving a single horse. He was
driving Mountain Maid and Mountain
Boy. He was going up the lane and I
was coming down. I first saw him
whizzing along like a streak of greased
lightning two or three blocks away, his
horses swaying from side to side. As
near as I could tell he was due to be on
my side of the road about the time we
were to meet and I looked for trouble.
So did my horse, and it was hard work
to keep him from turning short about
and upsetting me right there. The
crash came in less time after that than
I can tell 3 r ou of it, but I did the best I
cc/uld by swinging my horse so that he
wouldn't be pierced by the pole of the
commodore's wagon. The way I fixi.-d
things my horse and Mountain Boy
came together so hard that it knocked
the breath out of both of them.
"Vanderbilt's rig was all smashed up
and I thought the cc-mmodore was
killed, sure. He went right down among
the horses, head first, with his feet in
the air, and yelling like a wild Indian.
The shook knocked him senseless. The
wagon was not damaged beyond the
springing of the front axletree and my
horse was injured so little that I was
able to drive him home. They carried
the cormnodore to the clubhouse near
by and brought him to. As soon as he
opened his eyes he asked for me.
" 'Oh, Fuller has driven home," they
told him.
"What did he say? Nothing. He
wasn't a man of many words at any
time, and he had some hard thinking
to do Just then. He never spoke about
the accident to me."
Mr. Fuller is almost the sole active
survivor of the famous drivers on the
seems, Mr. Bessel, a stout, middle-aged
gentleman, must have scrambled in oraer
to fall down the shaft. He was saturated
In colza oil, and the smashed tin lay be
side him, but luckily the flame had been
extinguished by his fall. And his mad
ness had passed from him altogether.
But he was, of course, terribly enfee
bled, and at the sight of his rescuers he
gave way to hysterical weeping.
In view of the deplorable state of his
flat he was taken to the house of vr.
Hatton in Upper Baker street. Here he
was subjected to a sensitive treatment,
and anything that might recall the violent
crisis through which he had passed was
carefully avoided. But on the second
day he volunteersd a statement.
Since that occasion Mr. Bessel has at
several times repeated this statementâ
myself among other peopleâ varying the
details as the narrator of real experi
ence always does, but never by any
chance contradicting himself in any par
ticular. And the statement he makes is
in substance as follows:
In order to understand it clearly It is
necessary to go back to his experiments
with Mr. Vincent before his remarkable
attack. Mr. Bessel' s first attempts at
self-projection, in his experiments
Mr. Vincent, were, as the reader will re
member, unsuccessful. But through all
of them he was concentrating _ all his
power and will upon getting out oltne

dead. Sage is still with us in the llesh,
but his present driving is tame in com
parison with that of the old times.
Bonner is alive, too, but he doesn t drive
much on Manhattan Island nowadays.
"Bonner was one of the best drivers

day with Henry Ward Beecher on the

ment of his first essay was shot with tear^
For he perceived, at first indistinctly nnci
then suddenly very clearly, that he was
surrounded by faces; that each roll ami
coil of the seeming cloud stuff was a face.
And such faces! Faces of thin shadow,
faces of gaseous tenuity. Faces like those
faces that glare with intolerable strange
ness upon the sleeper in the evil hours 01
his dreams. Evil, greedy eyes that were
full of a covetous curiosity, faces wltn
knit brows and snarling, smiling lips;
their vague hands clutched at Mr. Bessel
as he passed and the rest of their bodies
were but a vague, elusive streak of trail
ing darkness. Never a word they said
never a sound from the mouths that
seemed to gibber. All about him they
pressed in that dreamy silence, passing
freely through the dim mistiness that was
his body, gathering ever more numerously
about him. And the shadowy Mr. Bessel.
now suddenly fear-stricken, drove mistily
through the silent, active multitude of
eves and clutching hands.
So inhuman were these faces, so ma
lignant their staring eyes, and shadowy
clawing gestures, that it did not occur to
Mr. Bessel to attempt intercourse with
these drifing creatures. Idiot phantoms,
they seemed, children of vain desire, be
ings unborn and forbidden the boon of
being, whose only expression and ges
tures told of the envy and craving for
life that was their one link with exist-
It says much for his resolution that

Mr Vincent. He made a violent effort of
will and found himself, he knew not how
stooping toward Staple Tnn, saw Vincent
sitting attentive and alert m his arm
chair by the fire. - Â»Â«.Â«Â«
And clustering also about him, as the}
clustered ever about all that lives and
breathes, was another multitude of these
vain voiceless shadows, longing, desiring,
seeking some loophole Into life
For a space Mr. Bessel sought Ineffect
ualv to attract his friend's attention. He
trie"d to get in front of his eyes, to move
the objects in his room, to touch him.
But Mr Vincent remained unmoved, ig
norant of the being that was so close to
his own. The strange something that
Mr. Bessel has compared to a sheet of
glass separated them impermeably.
And at last Mr. Bessel did a desperate
thing. I have told how that in some
strange way he could see not only the
outside of a man, as we see him, but
within. He extended his shadowy hand,
and thrust his vague black fingers, as it
seemed, through the heedless brain.
Then suddenly Mr. Vincent started like
a man who recalls his attention from
wandering thoughts, and it seemed to
Mr. Bessel that a little dark-red body,
situated in the middle of Mr. Vincent's
brain, swelled and glowed as he did so.
Since thnt experience he has been shown
anatomical figures of the brain, and he
knows now that this is that useless struc
ture, as doctors call it, the pineal eye.
For, strange as it will seem to many,
we have deep in our brains, where it can
not possibly see any earthly light, an
eye. At the tlm.- this, with the rest of the
internal anatomy of the brain, was
quite new to him. At the sight of its
changed appearance, however, he thrust
forth his linger, and, rather fearful still
of the consequences, touched thjs little
spot. And instantly Mr. Vincent Started,
and Mr. Bossel knew that he was seen.
And at that Instant it came to Mr. Bes
sel that evil had happened to his body,
and behold! a great wind blew through
all that world of shadows and tore him
away. So strong was this persuasion
that he thought no more of Mr. Vincent,
but turned about forthwith, and all the
countless faces drove back with him like
leaves beiore a gale. But he returned
too late. In an instant he saw the body
that he had left inert and collapsedâly
ing indeed like the body of a man just
dead â had arisen, had arisen by virtue
of some strength and will beyond his own.
It stood with staring eyes, stretching its
limbs in dubious fashion.
For a moment he watched it In wild dis
may, and then he stooped toward it.
But the pane of glass had closed
against him again, and he was foiled.
He beat himself passionately against
this, and all about him the spirits of
evil grinned and pointed and mocked. He
gave way to furious anger. He com
pares himself to a bird that has fluttered
into a room and is beating at the win
dow pane that holds it back from free*
dora.
And behold! the little body that had
once been his was dancing- with delight.
He saw it shouting, though he coultl not
hear Its shouts, he saw the violence of its
movements grow. He watched it fllnÂ£
his cherished furniture about in the mad
delight of existence, rend his books apart,
smash bottles, drink heedlessly from the
Jagged fragment*, leap and smite, in a
passionate acceptance of living. He
watched these actions in paralyzed as
toishment. Then once more he hurled
himself against the impassable barrier.
and then, with all that crew of mocking
ghosts about him. hurried back in dire
confusion to Vincent to tell him of the
outrage that had come upon him.
But the brain of Vincent was near
closed against apparitions, and the dis
embodied Mr. Bessel pursued him in vain
as he hurried out into Holborn to call a
cab. Foiled and 'error-stricken, Mr.
Bessel swept back again to find his dese
crated body whnoping in a glorious frenzy
down the Burlington Arcade.
â¢ â¢ Â«
And now the attentive reader begins to
understand Mr. Bessel's interpretation of
the first part of this strange story. The
being whose frantic rush through Lon
don had inflicted so much injury and dis
aster had indeed been Mr. Bessel's body,
but it was not Mr. Bessel. It was an evil
spirit out of that strange world beyond
existence. Into which Mr. Brssel had so
rashly ventured. For twenty hours it
I held possession of him. and for all those
twenty hours the dispossessed spirit body
of Mr. Bessel was going to and fro in
that unheard of middle world of shado-ws
seeking help in vain.
"Beecher was writing for the Inde

At last Mr. Bessel chanced upon a place
where a' little crowd of such disembodied
siient creatures was gathered, and thrust
ing through them he saw below a bright
ly lit room and four or five quiet gentle
men and a woman, a stoutish woman

I hail from.(Copyright IS9S by S. S. McClure & Co.)
IT must have been within a month
of my landing in Yamba's country,
in Cambridge Gulf, that I witnessed
my first cannibal feast. One of the
fighting men had died in our camp,
and after the usual observations had
been taken it was decided that he had
been pointed at and his death brought
about by a member of another tribe liv
ing some distance away. An expedition
of some hundreds of warriors was at once
fitted out, and the enemy was apparently
only too ready for the fray, because the
two armies promptly met in an open
plain, and then I had an opportunity of
witnessing the extraordinary method by
which the Australian blacks wage war.
One of the most redoubtable of our
chiefs stepped forward and explained the
reason for their visit, in comparatively
calm tones. An opposing chief replied to
him. and gradually a heated altercation
arose, the abuse rising on a crescendo
scale for ten or fifteen minutes. These
two then retired, and another couple of
champion abusers stepped forward to
â¢â¢discuss"' the matter. This kind of thing
went on for a considerable time, the
aou.se being of the most appalling de
scription, and directed mainly against the'
organs of the enemy's body (heart, liver,
etc.), his ancestors, "his ox, his ass, and
everything that was his." At length,
when every conceivable thing had been
said that it was possible to say, the war
riors drew near, and at last some one
threw a spear. This, of course, was the
signal for real action, and in a few min
utes the engagement became general.
There was no strategy or tactics of any
kind, every man fighting- single-handed.
Bat to return to the battle I was de
scribing. After a very few minutes' tight
ins the enemy were utterly routed, and
promptly turned tail and fied from the
scene of the encounter, leaving behind
themâ all the uproar and the flood
of vilificationâ only three of their war
riors, and these not dead, but only more
or less badly wounded. Quarter being
neither given nor expected in these bat
tles, the three prostrate blacks we.re
promptly dispatched by the leader of my
tribe, the coup de grace being given with
a waddy, or knobbed stick. The three
bodies were then placed on litters made
out of spears and grass, and were in due
time carried into our own camp.
A COMING HORROR.
There were so many signs to presage
what was coming that I knew a canni
bal feast was about to take place; but
for obvious reasons 1 did not protest
against it, nor did I take any notice
whatever. The women (who do all the
real work) feil on their kn>-cs. and with
their ting' '. â  â  : three iong trenches
in the sand, each about seven feet long
and three feet deep. Into each of these
ovens was placed one of the bodies of
the fallen warriors, and tht.-n the trench
lied upâ first with Bt< ion with
sand. On top of all a huge fire was
built and maintained with great fierce
ness for about two hours. There was
gr>at rejoicing; during this period, and ap
parently much pleasurable anticipation
among the triumphant blacks. In due
time the signal was given and the ovens
laid open once more. . . . But, perhaps,
the less said about this horrible spectacle
the better. With a yell several warriors
leaped into each trench and stuck Bpeara
through the big "joint." And the mo
ment the roasted carcasses were taken
out of the trenches the whole tribe lit
erally fell upon them and tore them limb
from limb. I saw mothers with a leg or
an arm surrounded by plaintive children,
who were crying for their portion of the
toothsome dainty.
THE FIRST CANNIBAL FEAST.
Others, who were considered . to have
taken more than their share, were like
wise fallen upon and their "joint" sub
divided and hacked to pieces with knives
made from shells.
A more appalling, more ghastly or more
truly sickening spectacle it is impossible
for the mind of man to conceive. A
great corroboree was held after the feast,
but I crept to my own humpy and tried
to shut out from my mind the shocking
inferno 1 had Just been compelled to wit
ness.
I now come to an event of very great
Importance in my life. Elsewhere. l have
spoken of my penchant for dugong hunt-
Ing. ell, one day* this sport effectually
put an end to all my prospects of reach
ing civilization across jthe sea. I went
forth one morning, accompanied by my
ever faithful Yamba and the usual ad
miring crowd of blacks. In a few min
utes we two were speeding over the sun
lit waters, my only weapon being the
steel harpoon I had brought with me
from the island, and about forty or fifty
feet of manila rope. When we were
some* miles from land I noticed a dark
looking object on the surface of the
water a little way ahead. Feeling cer
tain it was a dugong feeding on the well
known grass, I rose and hurled my har
poon at it with all the force I could mus
ter. Next moment, to my -amazement
the head of a calf whale was thrust
agonizingly into the air, and not until
then did I realize' what manner of crea
ture it was I had struck. This baby
whale was about fifteen feet long and it
â¢'sounded" immediately on receiving my
harpoon. As I had enough rope, or what
I considered enough, I did not cut him
adrift. He cam up again presently,
lashing the water with his tail, and cre
ated a tremendous uproar, considering his
size. He then darted off madly, dash-
Ing through the water like an arrow and
dragging our boat at such a tremendous
pace as almost to swamp us in the foam-
Ing wash.
Up to th time I had no thought of dan
ger but just as the baby whale halted I
fooked around and saw to my horror that"
his colossal mother had Joked her off
spring and was swimming round and
round it like ligntning, apparently areatlv
disturbed by Its 'Before , I
could even cut the line or attempt to tret
out of the way the enorrnouâ¢
caught sight of our little craft and bore
aown upon it like a fair-sized island rush
ing through the sea. I shouted to Yamba
and we both threw ourselves over the side
into the now raging waters and com
menced to swim away with long strokes
In order to get a* far as possible from the
boat before the catastrophe came, which
we knew was at hand. We had not got
many yards before I hoard a terrific
crash, and looking back I saw the enor
mous tail of the great whale towering
high out of the water, and my precious
boat descending in fragments upon it
from a height of from fifteen feet to
twenty feet above the agitated waters.
Oddly enough the r'ure part of the boat
remained fixed to the rope of tue harpoon
in the calf. My first thought, even at so
terrible a moment and in so serious a sit
uation, was one of bitter regret for the
loss of what I considered the only means
of reaching- civilization. Lake a flash it
came back to me how many weary
months of toil and hope and expectancy
I had spent over that darling craft; and I
remembered, too, the delirious joy of
launching it. These thoughts passed
through my mind in a few seconds'.
A TEN-MILE SWIM.
At this time we had a swim of some ten
milc-s before us, and yet in the far dis
tance 1 could not only see land distinctly
but also the crowd of. blacks, who were
now putting out in their catamarans to
help us.
Before long a large catamaran with one
of the chiefs on board came up with us,
but although deeply grateful for Yamba's
and my own safety. I was still greatly
dlstressed at the loss of my boat.
My harpoon had evidently inflicted a
mortal wound on the whale baby, be
cause as we looked wo saw it lying ex
hausted on the surface of the water, and
being gradually swept nearer and nearer
the shore by the swift flowing tide. The
mother refused to leave the little calf.
however, and still continued to wheel
round it continuously, even whon her off
spring had reached dangerously shallow
The result was that when the tide
turned both the mother and her calf were
left stranded high and dry on the beach,
to the unbounded delight and amazement
of the natives, who swarmed round the
leviathans and set up such a terrific up
roar that I verily believe they frightened
the mother to death. Furious smoke sig
nals were at once sent up to summon all
the tribes in the surrounding countryâ
enemies as well as friends.
To cut a long story short, the natives
fully believed that I had killed single
handed and brought ashore both whales.
And in the corroborees tnat ensued the
poets almost went delirious In trying to
find suitable eulogiums to bestow upon
the mighty white hunter.
Never can I forget the scene that fol
lower!. when the blacks from the sur
rounding country had responded to the
smoke signals announcing the oapture of
the "great fish." From hundred? of miles
south came the natives, literally in their |
thousands â every man provided with his ;
ptone tomahawk and whole armory of
shell knives. They simply swarmed over
the carcass like vermin, and I saw many
of them staggering away under solid
lumps of fleph weighing between thirty
and forty pounds.
For about a fortnight this cutting up
and gorging went on. The spectacle wit
nessed on the beach would have been in
tensely comical were it not so revolt
ing. Many of the men and women had
gorged themselves to such an extent as
to be absolutely unable to walk, and they
rolled about on the sand, tearing at the
ground in agony. It may amuse you to
know that smoke signals were at once
sent up for all the doctors in the coun
try, and these ministering angels could
presently be seen with their massage
shells rubbing the distended stomachs of
the sufferers as th^y lay on the beach. I
saw some men fairly howling with agony,
but still devouring- enormous quantities
of oil and blubber.
The orgy, however, had its uses from
my point of view, because t took advan
tage of the arrival of so many strange
tribes to make myself acquainted with
their chiefs, their languages and their
manners and customs, in the hope that
these tribes might be useful to me some
day when I commenced my Journey over
land to civilization. For, of course, all
hope of escape by spr had now to be
abandoned, since my boat was destroyed.
So far I had won laurels enough with
my mysterious arrows or "flying
epears," as the natives considered them,
and my prowess with the harpoon and
tomahawk whs sung In many tribes.
And not the least awkward thing about
my position was that I dared not even
attempt a little quiet practice in spear
throwing for fear the blacks should
come upon me suddenly, when I would
most certainly lose caste.
The months passed slowly away, and
I was still living the same monotonous
life among my blacksâ accompanying
them upon their hunting expeditions,
joining in thPir snorts and making peri
odical trips inland with Yamba, in prep
aration for the great Journey I proposed
to make overland to Cape York. When I
spoke to my devoted companion about
mv plans she told me she was ready to
accompany me wherever : wentâ to'
leave her people and be forever by my
aide Right well I knew that she would
unhesitatingly do these things. Her
doer-like fidelity to me never wavered, and
I know she would have laid down her life
for me at any time.
DOG-LIKE FIDELITY.
Often I told her of my own home be
yond the seas, and when I asked her
whether she would come with me she
would reply: "Your people are my peo
ple, and your friends my friends. I will

IN AUSTRALIA.
MDE ROUGEMONT has returned to Europe
after more than thirty years spent among
1 the cannibal blacks of Australia, So astound
ing were some of his experiences that it would be
almost impossible to believe them if his story had
not been investigated and corroborated by famous
geographical expertsâ Dr. Scott Keltic, secretary of
the Royal Geographical Society, and Dr. Hugh
Robert Mill, librarian of the Royal Geographical
Society, and scientists of equal note in other fields,
whose opinions are those of experts.
The account of Louis de Rougemont is without
doubt the most thrilling true story ever offered for
newspaper publication. His actual experiences sur
pass even the imaginative adventures of "Robinson
Crusoe" or "The Swiss Family Robinson."
De Rougemont'B story is that In 1863 he joined a
pearling expedition to the Guinea coast where a
large fortune in pearls was coon amassed. One day
At length everything was ready, and
I paid a final farewell, as I thought, to
my black friends in Cambridge Gulf.
They knew I was venturing on a lung
journey overland to another part of the
country many miles distant, In the hope
of being able to get into touch once mute
with my own people, and though
they realized they should never see me
again, they thought my departure a
very natural thing. We had a very af
fectionate leave-taking, and a body of
the natives escorted us for the first 100
miles or so of our trip. At last, how
ever. Yamba, myself and the faithful
dog were left to continue our wande,rings
alone. The reliance I placed upon
this woman, by the way, was absolute
and unquestioning. I knew that alone
I could not live a day in the awful wil
derness through which we were to pass,
nor co-uld any solitary white man. By
this time, however, I had had innumer
able demonstrations of Yamba's almost
miraculous powers In the way of provid
ing food and water when, to the ordin
ary eye, neither were forthcoming.
I ought to mention that before leaving
my black people I had provided myself
wfth what I may term a native pass
port â a kind of Masonic mystic stick,
inscribed with certain cabalistic char
acters. Every chief carried one of these
sticks stuck through his nose; I, how
ever, invariably carried the passport In
my long, luxuriant hair, which I wore
"bun" fashion, held in a net of opossum
hair. This passport stick proved invalua
ble as a means of putting me on good
terms with the different tribes we encoun
tered. The chiefs of the blacks never ven
tured out of their own country without
one of these mysterious sticks, and I am
sure I should not have been able to travel
far without mine.
Whenever I encountered a strange
tribe along the line of march I always
asked to be taken before the chief, and
when in his presence I presented my
little stick. He would at once manifest
the greatest friendliness, and would offer
us food and drink. ' Then, before I took
my departure he also would inscribe his
sign upon it, handing it back to me, and
probably sending me on to another tribe
with an escort. It often happened, how
ever, that I was personally Introduced to
another tribe whose "frontier" joined that
of my late hosts, and in such cases my
passport was unnecessary.
At first the country through which our
â¢wanderings led us was hilly and well
wooded, the trees being particularly
fine, many of them towering to a height
of 150 or 200 feet. Our principal food con
sisted of roots, rats, snakes, opossum and
kangaroo.
Gradually we left the hilly country' be
hind us and at length got into an extra
ordinary desert of red sand, which gave
off a dust from our very tracks that near
ly suffocated us. Each water hole we
came across now began to contain less
and less of the precious liquid, and our
daily menu grew more and more scanty,
until at length we were compelled to live
on practically nothing but a few roots
and stray rats. Still we plodded on and
on, finally striking a terrible spinifex
country, which was Inconceivably worse
than anything we had hitherto encoun
tered. Not only was water all but unob
tainable here, but our skin was torn with
thorns at almost every step. Yamba was
terribly troubled when she found she
could no longer provide for my wants.
Fortunately the dew fell heavily at night
and a sufficient quantity would collect on
the foliage, and more particlarly on the
steel blade of my tomahawk, to refresh
me somewhat In the morning. How eager
ly would I Hck the precious drops from
the shining blade of that American ax!
Curiously enough. Yamba herself up
to this time did not seem distressed from
lack of water; but nothing about this
marvelouÃ woman surprised me.
By this time I began to feel delirious,
and I fear I was like a baby in Yamba's
hands. She knew that all 1 wanted was
water and she became almost distracted
when 'she could not find any for me. Of
herself she never thought. And yet she
was full of strange resources and devices.
When I screamed aloud in an agony of
thirst, she would five me some Jtind of
irrass to chew, and although this pos
sessed no real moisture, yet it promoted
the flow of saliva, and thus materially
benefited me. ,
Things grew worse and worse however,
and the delirium increased. Hour after
hour through the endless nights would

mnistenina: my lips with the dew that col

ies and in my lucid moments I gave my
self up for lost. I could not stand or
walk, nor could I speak or swallow My
throat seemed to be almost closed up,
and when I opened my eyes everything
seemed to be going round and round in
the most dizzy and sickening manner.
Mv heart beat with choking violence,
arid my head ached so that I thought I
was going mad.
A GHASTLY DRINK.
Gradually I grew weaker and weaker,
and at last, feeling the end was near, I
crawled under a tree and prepared to
meet the death I was now fervently pray
ing for. Had Yamba given up these lines
would never have been written. Amaz
ing to relate. shÂ« kept xnarvelously well
when De Rougemont was aboard ship alone with
his dog (the oth ers being out after pearls) a storm
swept the schooner to sea. He was finally cast on a
tiny sand-spit, where he lived for two and a half
years entirely alone. At the end of that time a
small party of blacks from the Australian coast
was blown upon the sandbar. After waiting months
for a favorable wind De Rougemont returned with
them to the Australian mainland, where his appear
ance excited the greatest wonder among the natives,
who had never before seen a white man.
After several unsuccessful efforts to regain civili
zation M. de Rougemont finally took up his resi
dence with one of the tribes, married a native wife
and eventually became ruler over a considerable
portion of the country.
During his long residence among the cannibal
blacks M. de Rougemont of course could not fail to
become acquainted with their customs and modes
of life. He participated in their battles and ob
served the practice of cannibalism in all Its hor
rible details.

against the trunk of the tree, and leaving
! my poor, suffering dog to keep me com
pany, she set out on her lonely search
with long, loping strides of amazing vigor.
It was late in the afternoon when she
took her departure, and I lay there hour
after hour, sometimes frantically deliri
ous, and at others in a state of semi-con
sciousness, fancying she was by my side,
with shells brimming over with the pre
cious fluid. I would rouse myself with
a start from time to time, but, alas;
Yamba was not near me. During the long
and deathly stillness of the night the dew
come down heavily, and as it enveloped
my bed I fell into a sound sleep, from
which I was awakened some hours later
by the same clear and ringing voice that
had addressed me on that still night on
my Island sandspit. Out upon the impres
sive stillness of the air rang the earnest
words. "Coupe l'arbre! Coupe l'arbre!"
I was quite conscious and much re
freshed by my sleep, but the message puz
zled me a great deal. At first I thought
it must have been Yaraba's voice, but I
remembered that she did not know a word
of French, and as I looked around there
was no one to be seen. The mysterious
message still rang in my ears, but I was
far too weak to attempt to cut the tree
myself, so I lay there in a sort of inert
drowsiness, until, rousing myself. I heard
the familiar footsteps of Yamba approach
ing the spot where I lay. Her face ex
pressed anxiety, earnestness and joy.
MY MINISTERING ANGEL.
In her trembling hands she bore a big
leaf containing two or throe ounces of
life-giving water. This I drank with gafep
lng eagerness, as you may suppose. My
delirium had now entirely left me. al
though I was still unable to speak. I
signed to her to cut the tree, as the voice
in my dream had directed me. Without
a word of question Yamba picked up the
tomahawk from where she had hurled
it and then cut vigorously into the tree,
making a hole three or four inches deep.
It may seem astonishing to you. but it
surprised me in no wise, when ovit from
the hole there trickled a clear uncertain
stream of water, under which Yamba
promptly held my fevered head. This had
a wonderfully refreshing effect upon me,
and in a short time I was able to speak
feebly but rationally, greatly to the de
light of my faithful companion. As, how
ever, I was still too wenk to move, I In
dulged in another and far sounder sleep.
All through that terrible night while
Yamba was far away searching for
water, Bruno had never left my side,
looking into my face wistfully, and occa
sionally licking my body sympathetically
with his poor, parched tongue.
While I was asleep the second time
Yamba had gone off with the dog in
search of food, and had returned with
an opossum, which was Poon frizzling
In an appetizing way on a tripod of
sticks over a blazing fire. I was able to
eat a little of the flesh, and we obtained
all the water we wanted from our won
derful tree. I have since learned that
my life was saved by the well-known Aus
tralian "bottle-tree," so called from the
shape of the trunk.
I was often amazed at the marvelous
way in which Yamba would track game
She would glance at a tree casually
and discern on the bark certain minute
scratches, which were quite invisible to
me even when pointed out. She wouid
then climb up like a monkey, and would
return to the earth with a good-sized
opossum, which would be roaeted in its
skin and accompanied with" many different
varieties of delicious roots. When I had
recovered, Yamba told me she had walked
many miles during the night, and had
finally discovered a full waterhole in a
now country, for which she said we must
make as soon as I was sufficiently strong.
Fortunately, this did not take very long
and on reaching the brink of the "water
hole we camped beside it for several days,
in order to recuperate. I must say that
the liquid we found here did not look very
invitingâ it was, in fact, very slimy and
green In color; but by the time we took
our departure there was not a drop left.
Yamba had a method of filtration which
excited my admiration. She dug another
hole alongside the one containing the
water, leaving a few inches of earth be
tween them, and then forced a stick
through the partition. When we wished
to drink, this stick was withdrawn. A
stream of comparatively clear water then
spirted through the opening. She would
also filter the water by letting it drain
from the waterhole into another hole duf
at the side.
At other times, when no ordinary human
being could detect the presence of water,
she would point out to me a little knob
of clay on the ground. This, she told me,
denoted the presence of a frog, and she
would at once thrust down a reed about
eighteen Inches long and invite me to suck
the upper end, with the result that I im
bibed copious draughts of delicious cold
water. â¢ <
As Told by Himself.
One day I saw a number of small
snakes swarming- around the foot of a
tree, and was just about to knock some
pf them over with my stick when Yam
na called out to me excitedly not to mo
lest them.
They then began to climb the tree,
and she explained to me that this clear

son. "1 did not wish you to kill the
snakes," she said, "because I wanted to
see if they would take refuge in the
trees from the coming floods."
Up to this time, however, there had not
been the slightest Indication of any great
changf in the weather. Many months
must have elapsed since rain had last
fallen in these regions, for the river was
extremely low between Its extraordi
narily high banks,* and the country all
around was dry and parched; but even
as we worked a remarkable phenomenon
occurred which told of impending
changes. I was oppressed with a sense
of coming evil. I listened intently when
Yamba drew my attention, but at first
all I could hear was a curious rumbling
sound, far away in the distance. This
noise gradually increased in volume,
and came nearer and nearer, but still I
was utterly tumble to acount for It. I
also noticed Tnat the river was becom
ing strangely agitated, and was â  swirl-
Ing along at ever increasing s-peed. Sud
denly an immense mass of water came
rushing down with a frightful roar, in
one solid wave, and then it dawned
upon me that It must have already com
menced raining among the hills, and that
the tributaries of the river were now
sending down their floods into the main
stream, which was rising with astonish
ing rapidity. In the course of a couple
of hours it had risen between thirty and
forty feet. Yamba seemed a little anx
ious, and she approached me with a sug
gestion that we had better build a hut
on some high ground and remain secure
in that locality without attempting to
continue our march while the rains last
ed, and It was evident that they were
now upon us.
We therefore set to work to construct
a comfortable little shelter of bark,
fastened to a framework of- poles by
means of creepers and climbing plants.
Thus, by the time the deluge was fairly
upon us, we were snugly ensconced In
our little hut. We did not, however, re
main Indoors throughout the whole of the
day, but went in and out, hunting for
food and catching game just as usual, the
torrential rain which beat down upon our
naked bodies being rather pleasant than
otherwise. We also collected a stock of
provisions to take wtih usâ kangaroo and
opossum, of course; but principally wild
honey, cabbage palm and roots or vari
ous Kinds. These preparations occupied
us for several days, and by the time we
had arranged everything for our journey
the weather had become settled once
more. Yamba remarked to me that If we
simply drifted down the Roper Biver we
'should be carried to the open sea, nor
would the time necessary be very long,
since the swollen current was now run
ning like a mill race. Our catamaran, of
course, afforded no shelter of any kind,
but we carried some sheets of bark to
form seats for ourselves and the dog.
At length we pushed on on our event
ful voyage, and no sooner had we got
fairly into the current tnan we were car
ried'along wtlh prodigious rapidity, and
without the least exertion on our part,
except in the matter of steering, which
was conducted by means of paddles from
the Bide of the craft. We made such
rapid progress that I felt inclined to go
on all night, but shortly after dusk
Yamba persuaded me to pull inshore and
camp on the bank until morning.
We passed any number of submerged
trees, and on several of these we found
snakes coiled among the branches. Some
of these reptiles we caught and ate.
About the middle of the second day we
heard a tremendous roar ahead, as though
there were rapids in the bed of the river.
It was now Impossible to pull the cata
maran out of its course, no matter how
hard we might have striven, the current
being absolutely irresistible. The banks
narrowed as the rapids were reached,
with the result that the water in the
middle actually became convex, so tre
mendous was the rush in that narrow
passage. Yamba cried out to me to lie
flat on the catamaran and hold on as
tightly as I could until we reached
smooth water apaln. This she did her
self, seizing hold of the dog also.
Nearer and nearer we were swept to
the great seething caldron of boiling
and foaming waters; and at last, with a
tremendous splash, we entered the ter
rifying commotion. We went right un
der, and so great was the force of the
water that had I not been clinging te
naciously to the catamaran I must in
fallibly have Seen swept away to certain
death. Presently, however, we shot into
less troubled waters and then continued
our course, very little the worse for
having braved these terrible rapids.
Again we camped on s^hore that night,
and were off at an early hour next morn-
The last time we landed Tamba had
stocked an additional quantity of edible
roots and smoked meats, and although
we lost a considerable portion of these In
shooting the rapids, there still remained
enough for a few days' supply.
In consequence of the ever-Increasing
width of the river. I found it a difficult
matter to keep in the channel where the
current was, so I gave up the steering
paddle to Yamba, who seemed instinc
tively to know what course to take.
Some distance from the mouth of the
river De Rougt-munt and his wife landed
on a large island inhabited by a number
of natives, who gave him a dug-out canoe
to take the place of his raft. Thence he
proceeded along the coast in the direc
tion in which he believed Cape York to
lie.
At length they fell in with a mall vessel
carrying a Malay beche de mer expedi
tion. Thf fishermen received them hos
pitably and offered to carry them back to
Kopang in the Dutch Islands. At this
point, however, De Rougemont's black
wife fefused to accompany the party
through fear of the Malays, and rather
than desert her De Rougemont gave up
this opportunity of rescue. This was
about the year 1868.
Captain Davis, the commander of the
Malay vessel, informed De Rougemont
that he would be likely to find white men
at Port Darwin, between 300 and 400 miles
away. De Rougemont accordingly set out
in his canoe to reach Port Darwin. After
traveling forward for two weeks, and
when he believed that he must be close
to Port Darwin, a terrific storm arose
which swept the canoe out of sight of
land and nearly cost the lives of its oc
cupants. In the course of the storm they
were evidently swept past Port Darwin,
for after sailing on for many days more
they came in sight of familiar land and
found' themselves once more on the shores
of Cambridge Gulf, the identical point
from' which they had started.
The natives welcomed them back with
every sign of delight, and De Rouge
mont was careful not to explain to them
that his return was involuntary. For a
long time after this bitter disappointment
he remained among his Cambridge Gulf
friends, always keeping a sharp lookout
for visiting ships and making several
short exploring expeditions along the
coast, but not attempting another trip
across the continent.
Some months afterward De Rougemont
determined to make another strike for
civilization and set off due south, not
knowing that this direction would take
him directly into the unexplored heart of
the continent. On this trip many won
ders were encountered, including a rain
storm Which brought down live fish, a
countless horde of rats, which devastated
all the country it passed over, and a cave
full of immense snakes. There were also
many narrow escapes from death at the
hand's of hostile natives.
On one occasion, believing that a native
chief meditated treachery, De Rouge
mont and his wife left the camp which
they had constructed and slept in the
bush. In the morning they found a num
ber of spears sticking through the bark
sides of the camp in the place where
they would have slept ordinarily.
Month after month the journey was
continued in a southerly direction. It was
impossible to travel due south, but they
followed a zigzag course from water hole
to water hole after the manner of the na-
When he was some seven months out
and while traveling in company with a
small party' of blacks De Rougemont
came suddenly upon four white men. At
this time he was naked like the savages,
and so tanned and brfcwned by exposure
to the weather that in appearance he was
much like them. Forgetting this, in his
excitement, however, lie rushed toward
the white men, who promptly fired upon
his party and then retreated. For this
affair De Rougemont assumes the entire
blame, saying that he would doubtless
have done the same thing under like cir-
Two or three weeks after this encounter
De Rougemont and his wife came across
another white man, who had lost his rea
son and was wandering aimlessly about in
the desert. This man lived with them for
some two years, recovering his mind fin
ally just before his death, sufficiently to
inform De Rougemont that his name waa
Gibson and that he had been a member
of the Giles expedition.
After the death of Gibson, finding that
there was apparently no hope cri reaching
civilization by following an overland
route De Rougemont determined to settle
down' among the friendly blacks, and if
necessary end his days there. To this
decision, he says he was moved largely by
the pleadings of his native wife, for
whom he had come to entertain a most
sincere affection. He therefore settled
down in the mountainous region mar the
center of the continent and ultimately be
came king or ruler over a number of large
tribe 0 In this manner he lived out th*
next "twenty years of his life, and would
nrobably have ended his days there had
not an epidemic of Influenza swept over
the continent and carried away his wife
and children.
Being thus left alon.e De Rougemont
decided to make one more attempt to
reach civilization and leaving his moun
tain home set out toward the southwest.
In this, as in previous journeys, he was
unable to follow a direct line, but had
to go hither and thither with the tribes
that he met in his journey. After a
time he came across a tree marked "For
rest," evidently the name of an explorer
who ' had passed that way. Turning
south from thia point he at length, seve
ral days' journey north of Mount Marga,
learned that a party of -white prospectors
were near by. Taught by his previous
experience he decided to get some of the
natives to procure clothes for him before
he presented himself to the white men.
When he Joined the prospecting party
and informed thorn that he had been jour
neying from the intertor for nine or ten
months they looked upon him as a per
son of weak intellect, and when he asked
the question, "What year Is this?" they
were convinced that he was crazy. How
ever, they permitted him to accompany
them back to Mount Marga, which was
the nearest camp. Thence by Slow stages
he worked his way to Melbourne, reach
ing there early in 1895.
For over two years he supported him
self by various more or less menial oc
cupations, gradually becoming accus
tomed to civilization and learning of the
events that had taken place during the
time when he was lost to the world.
Early in the present year he worked his
passage to London on a trading vessel
and soon afterward all the vrorld heard
of him under the title of "the new Rob.
inson Crusoe."
Tr;e De Rougemont Controversy.
LONDON, Oct. 24.â For two months
the great controversial question in
England has been: "Is the man
who calls himself Louis de Rouge
mont, and who claims to have
lived for something like thirty
years among the cannibal blacks of Aus
tralia, a great traveler or a great im
postor?"
The Daily Chronicle asked this question
early in September, and since that time
has kept up a continuous fire of denial,
criticism and ridicule against the "mod
ern Crusoe." But De Rougemont has
not been without warm supporters, and
the public has seemed disposed to listen
with interest to his story and to believe
it until it should be proved untrue. ThÂ«
. world at large has watched this paper
war with interest, too, for the account
of De Rougemont, or at least such part
of it as he has related thus far, has been
repeated in every quarter of the globe,
and it -certainly has fulfilled the claim
of the Frenchman's backers as being
"the most marvelous story man ever
lived to tell.'"
When Louis de "Rougemont, or Louig
Grin as his name is now reported to be,
applied to the Hon. Hunneker Heaton
some months ago for an introduction to
some London editor it is doubtful if he
looked upon himself as in any way a
wonderful man. He had recently worked
his way from New Zealand to London on
a trading vesÃel and was out of money.
He modestly explained that he had been
a pearl-fisher, had lived among the Aus
tralian blacks, and had had some ad
ventures which he believed might make
an interesting- story. Until he became
stranded in London, he claimed, it may
be truthfully,, he had had no thought of
writing about his experiences.
Through Mr. Heaton. who is interested
in all affairs Aus>tÂ»ala.Â«ian. the traveler
was introduced to Mr. W. G. Fitzgerald
of Sir George Newnes' Wide World mag
azine. His story must have impressed
the managers of that publication, for
they shortly announced that they had
discovered a "new Robinson Crusoe,"
whose actual experiences were even more
remarkable than those of Defoe's imag
inary hero, and that his own account of
his wonderful adventures would begin
publication in the. August number of their
magazine.
Public curiosity, which had been mildly
stimulated by the advertisements of:
the new prodigy,' received a gen
uine surprise when the first In
stallment of De Rougemont's story
appeared in print. It is putting it
mildly to say that his adventures were
the most remarkable ever related under
the. guiae of truth. The $50,000 cargo of
pearls, the giant octopus, the wreck on
the lonely sandapit, the turtle-bock rides,
and the other wonders which formed the
inception of De Rougemont's tale, are fa
miliar to the reading public. They proved
a large dose to swallow at one gulp, and
it is not surprising that they were re
ceived with astonishment and incredulity.
But Crusoe and his publishers were not
abashed. It was announced that thÂ«
geography of the story had been examined
and checked by Dr. Scott Keltle and Dr.
Hugh Robert Mill of the Royal Geo
graphical Society, and that they believed
it was true. The most Incredible incident
of the first portion of the story was that
in which the narrator told how he had
beguiled the w^ary hours on the sand
spit by riding on the backs of Immense
turtles, keeping them at the surface by
leaning far back on the shell and guiding
them oy poking his toes in their eyes.
But Admiral Markeley, who had had
long experience among the South Pacific
islands, came forward and said that h#
had known of this feat being accom
plished by natives there, and- that It wai
by no means impossible.
Then De Rougemont enjoyed a genuine
triumph. He was invited to address the
Bristol Congress of the British Associa
tion for the Advancement of Science, He
read two papers before this digniiied
body on his geographical and anthropo
logical observations among the Australian
natives. More than this, he was the lion
of the hour, and his papers were the great
feature of the meeting. The worthy and
distinguished gentlemen wtto compose ihÂ«
British Association are now greatly
pained and scandalized to think or their
enthusiasm over the man who, according 1
to recent revelations, was in service as
a footman and courier during a consider
able portion of the time when he was sup-
Eosea to be lording it over a tribe of
erce cannibals. .
The enemies of De Rougemont acknowl
edge that there may be a considerable
substratum of truth in his stories. It i|
known that he was at one time engaged
in the pearl industry, and it is believed
that Peter Jensen, who figures in the
narrative as his partner In this enter
prise is still living in New Guinea. It is
acknowledged, too, that he may have
lived for some years among the blacks
as no record of his doing-s from about
1875 to 1880 has been found.
With important modifications it Is like
ly that his story will be proved to have
a basis In fact. ...
At any rate, in spite of the damaging:
revelations that have been made regard
ing his credibility, De Rougremont still
sticks to hl9 Htory.

LONG CREEK, Oct. 28.â Mr. and Mrs. C. C. Blackwell are two of the old
est and most highly respected residents of Grant County. They were
both- born in Hickman County, Tennessee. They were married Sep
tember 9, 1847. Mr. Blackwell was born September 6, 1826. Mrs.
Blackwell was born in 1830.
Fifteen children have been born to them, two of whom died in infancy.
Their living descendants number 13 children, 63 grandchildren and 13
gTeat-grandfhldren, a total of 89 .
In 1861 Mr. and Mrs. Blackwell removed from Tennessee to Franklin
County, Arkansas, where Mr. Blackwell engaged in farming. In 1854 they
went to what is now Parker County, Texas. They returned to Arkansas
just in time to escape a general massacre by the Comanche Indians in 1857,
in which all their neighbors were killed. They then resided in Northwest
ern Arkansas until the spring of 1875, when they removed to Grant County,
their present home. Blackwell engaged in Btock raising.
Soon after their arrival in this valley, in 1878, the country was raided
by Indians, and it is said th: t had it not been for the courage and energy
displayed by Mr. Blackwell a massacre of the twenty odd families then re
siding in Northern Grant County would certainly have occurred. Every
family in the valley was brought to a point a few miles above the present
town of Long Creek, and the men immediately set to work building a
fort, and with energy born of desperation succeeded in completing it a
few minutes before the Indians arrived. Mr. Blackwell gave orders to the
party not to fire a shot unless the Indians closed in on them, and to his
good judgment in this respect the party no doubt owe their lives. Mr.
Blackwell says that the Indians could have taken the little fort with ease
had they stormed it, for the weapons of the settlers consisted of only a
few guns of the old cap and ball pattern, and very little ammunition.
But after firing a few volleys at the fort -with the intention of drawing
the fire of the settlers the Indians withdrew, evidently deeming the little
citadel too strong to attempt a hand-to-hand attack. Mr. Blackwell lays
he thought the entire party would be massacred, but he and the rest of
the party determined to sell their lives as dearly as possible under the
great odds against them.
The Indians contented themselves with stealing every horse In the val
ley and slaughtering the cattle and sheep and firing the settlers' cabins.
Mr. Blackwell lost several thousand dollars' worth of livestock and 'i)s
home and improvements. He has succeeded since, however, In amassing
quite a fortune.

A BUD'S
GOSSIP.
EAREST MARGUERITE: The
doctor and dentist pronounced me
Din full repairs, and the dress
maker vouched that I had all the
modern improvements. That was
last Monday, and to-day 1 feel that I
ought to be put on the shelf again for re
pairs. Like all new-fangled tilings, I got
out of whack.
But this is a fin-de-sieole age, so I must
keep the pace, and, well. "Apres nous le
deluge!" Not that I really did anything
thrilling this week. Yet I had pome Ken
ulne gayety. But after hibernating for
so long on the memory of joys that have
fled. I almost succumbed unilnr the influ
ence of a bona-flde good time.
The first affair was an informal little
t^a given to Lurllne Spreckels. Mabel and
Lurline have always b^en very chummy,
fu Mabel is bluer than Indigo at the
thought of Lurllne'a living in Paris In
definitely.
We really had a Jolly time, especially
I Edith McÃean and myself, who were the
I only girls who had passed our teens. In-
I stead of putting weights on the other
girls' spirits, we pitched them up to the
| Key of G.
Lurline showed me the picture of a cer
tain tickle youth who or late has been
sighing under her lattice. And 1 think
she must have smiled at him through the
slats, otherwise he would not have had
his picture taken especially to ivc to her.
1 myself have smiled at him several
times and oft, yet I did not receive a pic
ture, in fact, iÂ£mile B. has given me the
marble heart evef since I told you that
secret of his engagement to a southern
girl.
Monday afternoon we all went to the
1 tennis game. 1 think 1 told you that I bet
my hat on Alice Hoffman. Well, Winm
fred Mason won out, and unless some one
puts up a finer game next time my career
is ruined. I can never afford to get an
other hat like the one 1 have lost.
Some wily financiers should get a cor
ner on tea, for at the rate we girls are
consuming it. it's bound to go up. Every
afternoon, with malice aforethought, we
come down like the wolf on the fold at
some of the girls' houses. We consume
gallons of tea, barrels of crackers and
acres of sandwiches.
I steered half a dozen of the girls to
see Carrie Taylor one day, and we lin
gered over our cups so long that it was
a scramble to get home in time for din
ner. The Hopkins', the Carolans , Edith
McÃean and Caw Crockett constituted
by entire force, but they did nobly, and
Carrie will have to lay in a fresh stock
of tea before we come again.
The next day most of us went over to
San Rafael to see Tiny O'Connor.
The buds are in a flutter of excitement.
Olive Holbrook came home from Faso
Robles this week, and she and Mabel
have had all sorts of conferences as to
their "coming out." , .
Mrs. Loughborough is going to give
Josephine a matinee tea on Saturday to
introduce her to We, Us & Co., sometimes
called Society. â, â¢' /!
1 met Josephine at a dinner Mrs Martin
gave, and she did herself proud. Lieuten
ant and Mrs. Key. U. S. N., were the
guests of honor,' and I found them very
charming. They leave for Tokio, Japan,
In some official capacity or other. Ethel
Murphy. Miss Schneely.-J. Downey Har
vey and Laurence Van Winkle were thÂ«
other guests.
I don't think you ever met Miss
Schneely. She is an extremely handsome
girl, with shining braids of black hair
wound around a really classical head. I
never can pronounce her name, so I call
her Juno. . â¢' < "
Mrs. de Young has offered her house for
the cushion tea that will be given for the
benefit of the Woman's' Exchange. I was
going to assist, but as Josephine Lough
borough's tea is the same day I couldn't ;
accept. Isn't it too bad there Is only one ;
Marie Wells, Julia Buckbee. Helen Wag- !
ncr Marie Oge and Mary Belle Gwin are
going to assist and will endeavor to pre
vent the public from feeling my absence
too keenly. â.'.= â  Â
We have been out to so many dinners
this week that the cook has not half ;
earned his salary. Besides Mrs. Martin s j
dinner there was a truly delightful one |
at the Bohemian Club. Mr. and Mrs.
Grant gave It in honor of Mr. Harrison,
the celebrated artist. The red room never i
looked prettier and the menu cards, by
Gordon Ross, were little gems. I- or once ,
the artistic atmosphere was genuine, not
merely a snobbish attempt. Mamma and
papa have been to two dinners this week,
but we managed to bear their absence by
inviting an avalanche of friends to break
Colonel Hawes grave the first dinner. j
Rear Admiral Miller and Mrs. Miller be- (
ing the guests of honor. The heads of .
our distinguished family said they enjoyed
it very much. The other dinner was
given by Mrs. Morgan, and was followed ,
by a card party. Mamma says going out
so often is making her young again.
You'd never guess it to look at her.
The Philadelphia Is here once more.
We were all relieved to see ]N orris Davis.
I was afraid that the hot weather of j
Honolulu, would wilt his massive collars.
But he still wears them highâhigher
choice' 'em. Affectionately >:Â°Â«Â«i MqY

Mrs. Gedleigh's
Fall Shopping
Gedleigh was married only last spring
and, as he and his wife have been out
of town ever since, he had no opportu
nity of discovering the true inwardness
of feminine shopping until last week,
when he and Mrs. Gedloigh came to
town to settle in their winter quarters.
The morning after their arrival as they
sat at breakfast Mrs. Gedleigrh observed
that It was plainly her duty to go a
shopping.
"I shall start early so as to get
through as much as I can," she re
marked.
"You won't do it all to-day then?"
"My fall shopping in one day.' Carl
Gedleigh! It is plainly evident that
your sisterless bachelorhood left you In
a deplorable state of ignorance. If you
would just go with me "
"Oh, no! no! I'll take your word for
it. I have no desire to be instructed by
means of object lessons."
"Well, as I was going to say, the
grand rush will be on by next week, and
I want to get ahead of it. Don't you
want to meet me for luncheon at 2
o'clock? Then I'll tell you what I have
done."
Gedleigh waited until half-past 2 and
had just decided that his wife was not
coming when she bore down upon him,
looking: tired -and nervous.
"Oh, Carl! I am so sorry to be late,
but I really could not help it. I have
been just as busy as I could be every
minute, and then I didn't do half what
I had planned."
"Well, what did you buy?" asked
Mr. Gedlelgh with sympathetic inter
est. "Did you get a stunning new fall
gown?"
"Oh, dear, no! I just looked at them.
I wanted to see what was going to be
worn this season."
"And didn't you get a hat, either?"
Mrs. Gedleigh shook her head. "I am
all at sea about hats. I went to several
of the largest shops and to some of the
swellest private ones, and everything
this season is so unbecoming to me."
"Didn't you buy any thing?" asked
the bewildered husband.
"Oh, yes; I bought some shirt waists
that were marked down from $3 50 to
$1 75, and I got you some lovely neg
lige shirts; you know yours are nearly
all so faded."
"But I thought it was time to lay
aside shirt waists and neglige shirts?"
"Yes, but they will do for next sum
mer, don't you see? And I got them so
cheap."

THE existence of the Ancient and

barked on an undertaking which
threatens to revolutionize the English

the name certainly fits it like the var
nish on a picture frame. A nickel in

i tendant on convivial gentlemen at say
ntfl an hour, and a real swell, dress
'. escort, for unattractive but

THE frou-frou swish and flutter of
the summer girl no longer echoes
softly on the ear. In its stead Is
the patter-patter of the autumn
girl, clad, as befits a modern Di
ana. The summer maiden has evoluted
into the autumn girl easily and naturally.
r For country life has been genuine tnls
r year instead of a mere pretense. Driving,
riding, swimming and boating crowded
out dress parade through corridors and on
verandas. Pallor and powder went out
of fashion together, and people have come
back to town sunburned to a turn.
Since Bess looks athletic, Bob has been
willing to take her seriously and include
her in the out-of-town jaunts.
The tennis and golf clubs bid fair to
outshine cotillons in popularity at least
for a time. A hunting club is being organ
ized and swimming and fencing are down
on the programme.
October is the month par excellence
when sport lovers get their innings. The
school bell has brought many families
back to town, but from Friday till Mon
day they hie themselves to their country
homes. It is then that the houses are at
their best â tilled to overflowing with city
guests, enlivened by the call of the hunt
ers' horn, by the gallop of horses,' the
crack of whips and the snouting of cheery
voices under autumn-tinted boughs.
So for the hunting garb of our fair
equestriennes, they are models that comp
are more than favorably with those
worn by the French and English dames
enjoying: their annual hunt in the forest
of Fbntainebleau.
Nov.- that our ladies fair have become
serious nd capable devotees of outdoor
Bports they study to a nicety as to what
is the correct thing to wear. They do not
go riding in some long skirt cut short and
, i a shirt waist out of fashion. â 
"i Madame numbers several hunting garbs
'â â¢ in her wardrobe. The skirt is always
ehort' enough to allow of Its just clearing
the sole of the riding boot. Most of me
skirts are of dark green cloth, and worn
with it is a oat or tightly fitting bodice
of bright apple green.
One of our fair Dianas chooses a habit
that harmonizes with the hunt. In the
last rabbit chase that the lingering guests
at' Monterey enjoyed she wore a habit
of soft shining, silky looking cloth of a
delicate, elusive shade that matched
"bunny's" coat perfectly. The hat was a
gray fedora draped with a silver gray
veil"
While this is a very pretty idea it is
very expensive and beyond the purses
of the multitude. One riding habit for the
wardrobe is sufficient, but it must- be
faultless. It is best for the cut to be
simple and the colors quiet, but the make
must be perfect. All the paraphernalia
of belt. whip, gun, boots, hat. spurs, cart
ridge holder, hunting knifeâ in short the
etceteras that are needful for hunting
ahorse or shooting afootâ must be fault
less.
Dead-leaf colored velveteens make up
into > .-rv pretty shootlngr-suits. Til.- skirt:
is plain and short, with a box-plaited
Norfolk jacket, fitting with absolute fidel
ity to the contours of the figure.
The Norfolk jacket may have a high
military collar and narrow cuffs, whereon
are embroidered small oak leaves and
acorn? in burnished silver. This last de
tail while Â»-xcoedingly pretty can be dis
pensed with. With such a costume should
be- worn a Tyrolese hat of tan felt
adorned with the wing of a partridge.
The same costume may be carried out
in myrtle green or mouse-gray cloth.
For hunting, as well as for shooting
the underwear should be of raw silk or
natural wool made up in the shape of
Bti^hts. all other forms of undervestments
" having been long since discarded.
The golf links out near the Presidio are
daily tented by young women in
emart costumes. The skirts are worn
longer than the" were 'last year, and
r^ach quite be!.,w the ankles. This ib
more becoming to the generality of
women. Almost all the skirts are gored
in front and circular in back. They are
made of heavy double-faced material, fin
ished with a .deep hem. They are worn
with any sort of shirtwaistâ that is, of
flannel, velveteen or wash material, made
loose, and yet fitted over the shoulders.
ilt is considered the smarter thing to wear
a golf cape of bright plaid faced with an

either an Alpine or Tarn o' Shanter.
The golf cape, like the skirt, is cut
rather larger than that of last year, is
tight fitting in the back and at the sides
and is single-breasted, fastened with gold
buttons, on which is the monogram of
the club. The turned-down collar Is some
times faced with a contrasting color, .in
dicating the club to which the wearer be -
longs. The hat is the medium-sized cam
paign hat, trimmed with a stiff wing at
the side and a leather band.
Golf shoes and boots are very heavy
looking. They are made of tan water

with holes across the back for. ventilation.
A smart bicycle costume is made of
checked material with the skirt cut in
circular shape, open at either side with
little straps and buttons. The Jacket Is in
Eton shape, with the fronts long enough
to extend below the waist line, and the
revers are unusually wide.

where during the entire winter. She real
izes th.at a wrap of that character is in
tended to be one of several rather than the
only one garment of its class. Coats and
jackets have proved to be always fash
ionable and always serviceable. But one
must keep up with the modish movement
of dress, be it what it may; consequently,
if we have a very good short jacket, the
thing to do is to study it carefully, and
plan the best way to ri-muuol its length.
The skirt or basque may be lengthened in
many ways. Supposing -the cloth cannot
be matched exactly, we may fall back
on the modish touch of using another
shade of the same color. That will be
found to result wonderfully well when
seen between rows of fur. Then the
revers. if not entirely of fur, should be of
the new shade of cloth, and the collar
and cuffs also. It is not intended that
the new shade of cloth should form the
outside of the collar; that would be in
bad taste, but as a lining it would be in
k^-ping perfectly.
Many of the smartest Paris gowns built
of cloth show two shades of one color
or have a contrasting color introduced, be
tween cuttings of the cloth, these stitched
down afterward on each side. A snuff
brown ladies' cloth had a charmingly
gt ful skirt design so devised as to
mount up and finish to perfection on the
bodice. It is carried out in gourd-yellow
cloth, the lines not over a quarterof an
inch wide. A burnt orange velvet chemi
sette with a left strap and rosette de
scending to the belt, inte rmingled with
ecru guipure lace. This lace also formed
half collars and a front, completing a de
lightful scheme of color.
The thing to avoid in altering an out
side garment is introducing contrasts
which are t<<o sharp. It is better taste
to keep vivid tones subdued. There are
numerous ways of doing this, such as by
the use of passementeries, black laces
braids and strappings to break the color.
In the matter of revers and collars they
may.be allowed to stand out more posi
tively, if harshness is avoided and no
abuse of the privilege is made. For In
stance, white satin seldom can be worn
as facings to such parts without being
veiled with lace.
Regarding skirts, the foundation taffeta
petticoat remains separate from the top
or outside skirt, as in our summer gowns
having an accordion flounce, and measur
ing throe yards around the bot
tom. All new skirts are long, too
long to shop or to go about the
streets on foot without drawing up the
other skirt to keep it clean. Unless we
do, and a pity it is to De so taxed, we
have nothing left us but letting them
hang to sweep the streets, as we see daily
very careless untidy women doing. The
outside skirt is simply faced and stitched
down, the stitching hidden by the usual
bottom finish which all skirts now have,
for they are all trimmeu in some way.
Fitted flounces hold their sway su
premely. Home dressmakers should be
warned against attempting them, espe
cially in cloth, unless they obtain the
rcrvlces of a tailor to cut them out. AH
the best dressmakers employ a tailor for
?uch work. If one has a cloth gown made
â tfter the model of last spring there will
be found very little to do to it, unless to
make it fit the figure more closely at the
lop and to trim the opening at the back
with groups of small outtons or to close
the back and open the sairt on one side,
und to add the same button trimming on
the hip seams; both are new touches
which take away from the excessive
plainness of not having gathers or plaits.
One of the favorite plain skirt models
in new Parts gowns has bias seams in
front and in the back. All such skirts
measure four yards round the bottom.
Cross-striped materials, both in woolens
and silks, which are so popular at the
moment, look the best when their skirts
aro made up after this model. As
an instance, there is a very smart
novelty material, having a fine, cloth
like foundation, cross-striped with satin
cords an inch apart, and found In all the
modish colors of the season. There Is no
rieed of a fitted flounce or trimmings on a
skirt of this material and model. For that
reason is it mentioned as the smartest
and least expensive skirt one may choose.
The meeting of these stripes on the bias
on the front and back seams is in itself a
nost effective trimming.
The bodice material for the back is
seamed on the bias to correspond, which
carries a charming line from neck to hem
of skirt. The material for the fronts
starts on the bias under the arms and
drapes up toward the center. Velvet 'Â«
then used for the chemisette, or the small
coachman's cape, or the divided collars,
which separate front and back, three of
the smartest styles observed on French
g-owns.
Bias seams are also carried out on the
sleeves. All new sleeves are slit up very

chance for effective small button group
ing, when buttons arc used as they are
popular, especially beautifully designed
very small ones. When medium sized
ones are used two in a group are suffi
cient. Chemisettes are no longer worn
down to the bust as in summer. They
are carried up higher, and so are revers,
because we must now show more of our
tight-fitting corsage below than we have
been doing.
The tops of sleeves fit closer this pea
son, and one cross row of flat trimming
laid on a little below the arm is thought
very smart.
AMBER
IN DEMAND
|7 N the matter of hairdressing English
I women seem to be very indetermin
jl ate. The Spanish comb that a few
months back was wont to prove a
really serious obstruction to the view in
public places of amusement, seems to
have quite disappeared and only the nar
row, graceful little empire shapes are
used, and even these do not seem to be
as numerous as formerly.
Amber is in special demand just now,
and women with very dark hair have
taken to wearing combs made of this
golden-hued translucent substance with
excellent effect. At a theater the other
evening I noticed Mrs. Brown-Potter, for
instance, \vi'h an enormous string of
amber beads twisted once around her neck
aril hanging far below her waist in front.
They looked odd and a trifle barbaric, but
they suited her remarkably well. 1 have
also seen lately some most delightful am
ber card cases with gold frames and the
initials or monogram set in diamonds in
one corner. For cigarette and cigar cases,
articles indeed of most exquisite luxury,
To wear the hats rolled off the face or tipped down over the eyes? that was the question. Whether
'twas better to show the contours of the face by the rolling brim or to hide them with the hat with the tipped
brim. From the latest models by the Parisian milliners it will be seen that the hat turned off the face
has won the day. This style is well adapted to show the fluffy pompadour style of hair dressing that still
prevails. Feathers are used lavishly on these hats and Dame Fashion is evidently firm in the decree that
the hat that does not boast of feathers of some sort is utterly hopeless. The hats are made of velvet al
most entirely. Felts are only found in the severe walking hats. Even these are draped In velvet and
are sometimes made entirely of two-colored velvet. The only substitute that is used for velvet for the foun
dation of the hat Is a very rich and novel weave of braided chenille. The hats this season are not only
very stunning, but they are of such a variety that it is unusually easy to find something becoming and
at the same time smart
amber is also "used, and I was shown the
other day a case which a wealthy bride
elect had just presented to the fortunate
you t"h who was about to become her
spouse. The case was of amber, with a
delicately wrought framework of gold,
and twisted about it, the edges fitting so
perfectly that the dolls seemed unbroken,
was a serpent of gold inlaid with emer
alds. In one corner, just at the end of
the serpent's head, was a coronet and
monogram in diamonds. It was, of
course, an impossible affair for any man
to carry in his pocket, but as a rare and
beautiful specimen of the jeweler's art
it was decidedly interesting.
Delightful little stamp boxes and bon
bon boxes are also being made of amber,
some of them hanging from slender golden
chains so that they can be worn depend
ing from the neck. These also are set
with precious stones, and some of them
have the amber lids cunningly carved in
quaint designs. All these things, of
course, cost a very pretty penny, but I
dare say Bond-street jewelers will drive
a brisk trade with them in anticipation of
the Christmas season.
SLEEPING MACHINES.
Experiments have been made recently
with some curious devices in the shape
of "sleep machines." Sleep will some
times result from fatigue of the eyes.
Looking at trees or other objects as
we rush along in the train will fre
quently "send us off."
An ingenious gentleman has pro
duced a machine for this purpose. It is
a box surmounted by two fan-like
panels, one above the other, revolving
horizontally in opposite directions.
Those panels are studded with mirrors
that throw upon the retina a vi
brating flood of twinkling light.
A similar effect is produced by star
ing at a brigtit ball placed high abeve
the head, so that some slight strain is
caused by staring at it.
Another apparatus for causing drow
siness is formed of clamps for squeez
ing the arteries leading to the brain.
The clamps remain in position for less
than half a minute, and by that time
the sufferer from insomnia has been
placed in a state of somnolence by the
decreased flow of blood to the brain.
Still another method is to arrange an
electric battery in the bed so that a
mild electric current acts upon the
spine.
In China hens are employed to hatch
fish cpÂ«s. These are sealed in an egg
shell and placed under the unsuspecting
hen for a few days until the spawn has
warmed into life. The contents of the
shell are then emptied Into a shallow
pool, where .they can bask in the sun
shine until the minnows are strong
enough to be turned into a lake or river.

Powder and Curling Irons
as
An Aid to Beauty
By Mme. Hygeia.
This department is for the benefit of all those who are interested in cos
metics and the hygiene of proper living-. Correspondence is cordially invited.
Ask as many questions as you like and sign any name that you choose. Ad
dress all communications to Mme. Hygeia, The Sunday Call, San Francisco.
DESPITE the rantings of the
strong-minded lady who flies to
the housetop and flings anathe
mas right and left as to the
girl who wields a curling iron
or flaunts a powder puff, there
never was a girl yet whose dear little
nose was the least bit demoralized by a
suspicion of powder gently sprinkled over
it. Have you ever particularly noticed
the aforesaid goody-goody lady, who rails
against creams and lotions, powders and
all such aids to beauty as the invention
of a certain disreputable gentleman whose
name I would not think of mentioning in
a respectable newspaper? Have you ever
observed that this croaker about "beauty
unadorned" is invariably plain to an ex
treme? She is usually a maiden lady, too,
with her hair done up in a tight little
wad, a false front and a nose that shinea
with the magnificent radiance of a newly
polished brass door knob. But she
wouldn't put a particle of powder on that
scintillating member for all the riches in
the United Kingdom; no, indeed, not she!
But never mind, girls, powder is a good
thing just the same, if of the right sort
and used with discrimination.
Why, for my part, I would almost as
soon be without my front hair as to be
bereft of my beloved powder rag. And
by the way, there i:- nothing more delight
ful in the way of a powder rag than a
nice soft piece of white velvet. It is well
to have two pieces; with the one apply
the powder and with the other go over
tTT<> face, smoothing down the powder and
rubhintr it in. If any flecks fall upon the
eyebrows nr eyelashes, brush them out
with a small brush.
Nearly all women have some pet face
powder to which they pin their faith; but
let me tell you one thing. With but few
exceptions, powders that are bought in
the shops are positively poisonous, for
they contain bismuth or lead in large
quantities, and many of tTiem are made
almost entirely of oxide of zinc. A little
of this latter as an ingredient in a powder
can do no possible harm.
The only way to be sure, of your pow-

der is to make it yourself. The formula
winch I am about to give is not only,per
fectly harmless, but possesses exceptional
medicinal properties. Boracic acid in
most excellent for the irritated skin, so

can feel perfectly safe in using this pow
der. If carefully prepared it wll be as

One ounce Lubin's rice powder.
One ounce best, purest oxide of zinc.
One-half ounce carbonate of magne
sia (finely powdered).
Twenty grains boracic acid.
Two drops attar of roses.
When purchasing your ingredients, ask
your druggist to powder each separately
in a mortar. First put your rice powder
through a fine sieve and then .through
bolting cloth. Do the same thing with the
oxide of zinc, the magnesia and the bo
racic acid before adding tfiem to the rice
powder. When all are combined, put
twice through bolting cloth. After each
sifting throw away any particles that re
main. It is very necessary that all the
ingredients be made fine and soft and
downy. Add the attar of rose last.
If you desire a creamy tint to your pow
der, add the tiniest suggestion of finely
powdered carmine. If you wish to have
a rose or pink tint, add still more. Per
sons with a pale complexion should use
flesh-colored powder; those with florid
skins should use white, while cream will
be found the most acceptable for bru
nettes. A little rose water rubbed lightly
over the face before powdering will make
the powder adhere more closely.

to is the diet. Avoid pies, cakes and rich
foods. Eat plenty of fruit. Mineral v.-a
ters also have a good effect on skins
which are too liberally endowed with nat
ural oils. Then use the following lotion
to soften the water in which you bathe
your face: Alcohol, four ounces; ammo
nia, one ounce; oil of lavender, one
dram. Mix up by shaking in a six-ounce
botttle. Add one scant teaspoonful (not
a drop more) of this to two quarts of
warm water when the face is bathed. Use
camphor ice on the tender lips.
AUGUSTINE C.-I think if you will use
the following lemon hair wash- on your

lemons. Use this as a shampoo, and then
rinse out until the hair is soft and fluffy.
To stop the falling hatr use this tonic:

Formula is given in answer to Valdora.
ALAMEDA.-When the hair is exces
sively oily or the scalp unusually crowd
ed with dandruff, it should be shampooed
at least every ten days. . The simplest
recipe is the yolk of an egg well beaten
up in one ounce of rosemary spirits and
one pint of very wai-m water. Wash the
head thoroughly in this and rinse in sev
eral waters, until every bit of the egg has
been removed. This I am sure will ban

falling, try the tonic suggested in the
foregoing reply to Augustine C.
R. N. Câ With care you can do your
own housework, and still keep the hands
soft and white. Keep a lemon or tomato
conveniently near with which to remove
vegetable stains, and, if you can afford
it. use castile soap for dishwashing. Do
not change the hands suddenly from hot
to cold water or from cold to hot. Keep
a pair of old gloves with the fingers cut
off to draw on when handling coal or
ashes or doing rough work of any kind.
Each night upon retiring rub this cream
well into the hands: Cocoa butter, oil of
swe-'t almonds and refined white wax,
equal parts.
VALDORA F.â What you need to fatten
your face is the orange flower skin food.
Here is the formula: Spermaceti, one
half ounce; white wax, one-half ounce;
sweet almond oil, one ounce; lanoline, one
ounce; cocoanut oil, one ounce; tincture
of benzoin, ten drops; orange flower wa
ter, one ounce. Massage this well into
the skin.
ANNETTE CORDELIA B.â The follow
ing cold cream is excellent to use, after
washing the face: One-half ounce each
of white wax and spermaceti, four ounces
oil of sweet almonds and two ounces of
orange flower water. -Melt all together
very gently and pour into cups to cool.
When cool, pour off the water. Remelt
and pour into jars to keep.
LOLA HENRYâ You ask what effect
benzoin has upon the skin. The purpose
of benzoin is to help rid the skin of the
tiny particles it ia continually throwing
off. It is most excellent if used sparingly,
but if too much of it is usod yon will
find yourself shedding innumerable flaky
scales. I wouldn't think of using it on
the hair. Borax is all right if used in
very small quantity, say, a pinch of it
to a basin of water, but toe much of it
will be found to be very drying to the
skin.
I don't care for cocoa butter for the
face. Pure castile soap is the most de
sirable to use upon the skin. It has not
a particularly sweet odor, nor does it
make a nice lather, but it is pure. I gave
a special talk on proper diet in last Sun
day's Call. I hope you saw it.
GLADYSâ Witch hazel is splendid for
the eyes. If mixed with one-third part
camphor water it is particularly good for
weak, inflamed eyelids. A tonic made of
equal parts of cocoa nut oil and vaseline
will make the eyelashes and eyebrows
grow. But don't. I beg of you, use it on
the lashes in the condition your eyes are
in, for if it gets into the eyes, as it i.s
pretty sure to do, it will irritate and in
flame" them. Washing the hair in. strong
sage tea will often bring a darker shade
to one's tresses. I' am very sorry that I
could not answer your letter sooner, but
there were so many ahead of you.
YOUNG AMERICAN*â And ' you too
wanted an answer in "next Sunday's is
sue." Well, I can only say to you too
that I am sorry and I hope your patience
is not completely exhausted. The exces
sive redness, of your face probably comes
from a fevered condition of the blood.
Rest your; hopes of a cure on proper diet,
plenty of exercise and a general regard
for all hygienic laws. Take hot footbaths
and bathe the face occasionally with di
luted witch hazel. Bvery night before re
tiring massage the face thoroughly with
a good, pure, cold cream.
MISS J. W.â That is the best T could
make of the name you signed, and hope
you will recognize yourself. Bathe the
red nose' frequently in diluted witch hazel.
Also soak your feet in hot mustard water
before going to bod. A camel's hair face
scrubbing brush, tepid water and pure
castile soap, used Â»every night and fol
lowed by a smearing of the face with cold
cream, is the only treatment that will do
away with blackheads. I would advise
you to go to a skillful dermatologist and
have the moles removed.
KITTY M.â Were you finally success
ful with the cold cream?
I. U.â The electric needle is the only
permanent cure for superfluous hair.
Pumice stone will remove it but only tem
porarily. Peroxide of hydrogen is a bleach
and can be used upon the superfluous hair
with perfect safetly. Apply with a little
soft sponge every other night for awhile,
and then less frequently. This will light
en color of the hair, so as to make it
scarcely perceptible and very often will
finally deaden the growth. It will not
cause the slightest soreness or disfigure
ment of the skin and will lighten the hair
permanently.
CLAIRE E.â Dissolve a small pinch of
borax in two tablr>spoonsful of cologne
ami with it sponge the pimples on the
shoulders. Also take a daily sponge bath,
eat only such food as agrr-es with you,
and take plenty of exercise. For informa
tion concerning superfluous hair, please
read foregoing reply to I. H. Benzoin
used as you suggest is excellent.

Gertrude Atherion's New Book Just Out
It's Galled "TKe California^ Critics Produce It jkr Best Work, but San Franciscans Mau JM Agree With Her fen Description
of Our people.
"The Californians"â By Gertrude Atherton.
Ji hn Lane, publisher. London and New York;
For >nic by all booksellers.
MRS. GERTRUDE ATHERTON
has written another book.
It would not be just right to.
call It a story, for there is little
nf what would t>e called a plot.
It has not a single dramatic in
cident that is necessary. Those
that are depicted might as' well be left
out.
"The Californians" must be likened to a
series of pictures spread all over one can
vas. Looked at as a whole there is noth
ing, but a conglomerate muss. Separate
any one of the gems and it is a ma?ter
.if English writing. From a purely,
literary point of view the book is the
best that Mrs. Atherton has written.
But whether it is just in its description
: , crt tin | nother matter.
"The Californians 1 must be praised in
any case. Whether it should i>> pÂ«Â«*ised
with enthusiasm or merely accorded a
il approval Is another question;
mswer to it depends upon whether
the reader expects the novelist to Imaglna
or merely to observe. In the matter of
imagination Mrs. Atherton is easily sur
passed even by such craftsmen as Guy
by and Hall Cafne. Probably, how
she has ii" wish to challenge com
â n with writers of the florid school,
and would wish for no higher commenda
tion than that which one of her own char
vrs upon Henry James: "He's
so fascinating; 1 think it's because noth
ing ever happens, and that's so like real
life."
Certainly nothing of serious conse
quence happens from the first page of
"Tho Californians" to the last, except a
6uieide. To this extent, then, the writer
is a successful disciple, not only of Mr.
Henry James, but also of Balzac and
Thackeray and Mr. Â£eorge Gissing- and
various other masters; and one feels al
most hound U> apologize for not finding
her work particularly interesting.
Judged by all the canons, it is good work.
The environmentâ San Francisco In the
eightiesâ is admirably realized and pre

are thoroughly well dovetailed; the <iiar
learly individualized: the
is fluent and graceful. Yet one

the sense that there is something want
. it. Why? The reason is. so far
as we can judge, that tin- tone is pessi
mistic and that the tare qualities which
make pessimism acceptable are wanting.
The pessimism of Mrs. Atherton is neither
amusing nor Inevitable. The heroine, for
whom sympathy is invited, only needed
to he thoroughly well shaken in order
to be made quite contented with her lot.
Very likely that is the ease with a good
many of the unhappy heroines of real

of the superficiality and selfishness of the

Here is a paragraph describing the
leaders of California society. Perhaps
this is the way Mrs. Atherton saw
things. Could anything be more cut
ting?
The three large and aristocratically ugly
mansions of Don Roberto Yorba, Hiram Polk
and Colonel "Jack" Belmont stood side by side
on Nob Hill. Belmont was not as wealthy as
the others, but a "palatial residence" does not
mean Illimitable riches even yet In San Fran
cisco. Belmont had married a Boston girl of
far greater family pretensions than Mrs.
Yorba's, but of no more stately appearance nor
correct demeanor. The two women were inti
mate friends until her husband's notorious in
fidelities and erratlclsms when under the pe
riodical Influence of alcohol killed Mrs. Bel
mont. Neither Don Roberto nor Polk drank to
excess, and they kept their mistresses in more
decent seclusion than Is the habit of the aver
age San Franciscan. It would never occur to
Mrs. Yorba to suspect her husband or any
other man of Infidelity, did she live In Cali
fornia a hundred years, and Mrs. Polk was too
â  Indifferent to give- the matter a thought.
And the following bit of descriptive
writing is intended to give an idea of
the typical California young ladies.
Surely this is not true. There are un
doubtedly girls like the ones described
in our State, but to call them types is
not only a mistake but a slander:
"Is that you, Helena?" she whispered.
"Is It? Just you wait till you see me'"
A moment later she â  had clambered over the
railing and stood before the astonished Magda
lena.
"Whatâ what "
' "Boy's clothes. Can't you see for yourself?
I'm going to the fire, and you're going with
me."
"Of course I shall not. What possessed
you "
But the astute Helena detected a lack of de
.cislon in her friend's voice. "You're just dying
to go," she said coaxingly. "You adore fires,
and you'd love to see one close to. Put a
waterproof on and a Ulkck shawl over your J
head. Then If anybody notices you they'll
think you're a muchacha from Spanlshtown.
As I am a boy I can protect you beautifully.
We'll go to the livery stanle and I'll make old
Duff give me a hack. I've a pocket full of
boodle; papa gave me my allowance to-day.
Here, come in." She dragged the unresisting
Magdalena Into the room, arrayed her in a
waterproof and pinned a black shawl tightly
about the. small brown face. "There!" she
said triumphantly, "you look like a poor little
greaser for all the world. Don Roberto would
have a fit. Do you think you can slide down
the pillar?""
â¢ * â¢
"Lena!" whispered Helena, ecstatically.
"Isn't this gorgeous?" i
Magdalena nodded. Her brain and heart ,
were throbbing too loud for speech.
"I'm going to fires for the rest of my life," .
announced Helena, as they turned the corner
and walked swiftly down the hill. She was not
of the order which Is content with one expe
rience, even while that initial experience is yet
a matter of delightful anticipation.
When they reached the livery stable Helena
marched in, holding Magdalena firmly by the
band. . "I. want a hack," she said peremptorily
to the man â¢in charge. "And double quick,
too." The man stared, but Helena rattled the
gold in her pocket,, and he called to two men
to hitch up.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Magdalena did not speak of her conversation
with her own parent. She did not want to think
of it. This night was to be one of uniform
joy. They were a quarter of an hour reaching
the fire. As they turned into the great central
artery of the city. Market street, they leaned
forward and gazed eagerly at the dense, highly
colored mass of men and women, mostly young, .
who promenaded the north sidewalk under a
blaze of gas.
â  . "What queer-looking girls!" said Magdalena.
"Why do they wear so many frizzes and sailor

"Girls that live BOUth of Market street. Tney

Chippy town."
The following is certainly a master
piece of literary work, and is possibly
true to a certain extent. But is It not
overdrawn a little in order to accentu
ate the author's idea?
During the following work all Monlo, whlrh
had moved down before Mrs. Yorba, railed on
that august leader. She received every after
noon on the veranda, clad In black or gray
lawn, Btlff. silent, but sufficiently gracious.
On the day after her arrival, aa the rlrst vis
itor's carriage appeared at the bend of the
avenue, Ita advent heralded Liy the furious
barking of two mastiffs, a bloodhound and an
English carriage dog, Magdalen* gathered up
her bonks and prepared to retreat, but her
mother turned to her peremptorily.
"I wish you to stay," she said. "You must
begin now to see something of society. Other
wise you will have no ease when you come
out. And try to talk. Young people must
talk."
"But I can't talk," faltered Magdalena.
"You must learn. Say anything, and In time
it will be easy."
Magdalena realized that her mother was
rtfiht. If she was to overcome her natural
lack of facile speech she eoold not begin too
soon. Although she wai terrified at the pros
pect of talking to these people who had
alighted and were exchanging platitudes with
her mother, she resolved anew that the time
should come when she should be as ready of
tiiiÃue anil as graceful of speech as her position
and her pride demanded.
She sat down by one of the guests and stam
mered "out something about the violets. The
young woman she addressed was of delicate
and excessive beauty; her brunette face, under
a hat covered with corn-colored plumes, was
almost faultless in it;-- outline. She wore an
el it 'rate and dainty French gown the shade
Of her feathers, and her small hands and feet
were dressed t<> perfection. Majrdalena had
heard of the beautiful Mrs. Washington, and
lit ft a. privilege to sun herself In such love
liness. The three elderly ladies she had brought
with herâ Mrs. Cartright, Mrs. Geary and Mrs.
Brannanâ were dressed with extreme simplicity.
"Yes." replied Mrs. Washington, "they are
lovelyâ they are. for a fact. Mine have chil-
Walns or something this year and won't bloom
for a cent. Hang the luck! I'm as cross as a
bear with a Bore head about it."
"Would you like me to pick some of ours for
yr,u"" asked Magdalena. wondering If she had
better model her verbal accomplishments on
Mrs. Washington's. Fhe thought them even
more picturesque than Helena's.'
"Do; that's .1 jolly good fellow."
When Mngdalena returned with the violets
they were received with a bewitching but ab
sent smile: another carriage-load Had arrived
and all were discussing the advent of a "Bo
nanza" family, whose huge fortune, made out
of the Nevada mines, had recently lifted It from
obscurity to social fame.
"It's just too hateful that I've got to call."
said Mrs. Washington in her refined, melodious

MY Dear Mr. Martin: I find
things here about as formerlyâ
not much change worth record
ingâa new system of steam
tramways â two new railroads,
and a vast amount of work going on
for the exhibition of 1900. The students
from San Francisco are working away
and seem to be making headway. Mar
tinez is going ahead and is gradually
making a name for himself among the
students at least. We are nowâ thanks
to their generosity â in the apartments
of the McFarlands during their stay in
the country. Miss McFarland has some
good work to show; she is getting on.
I have not much to say in regard to
the exhibitions seen so far either here
or in London. The Royal Academy was
distressingly badâ worse than one could
possibly expect, in factâ a large oil by
A. E. Abbey being about the only thing
there worth mentioning. The subject
was Macbeth, and was treated in a
simple decorative way, quite telling,
though perhaps a little too much like
his Shakespearean book illustrations.
Of course there were portraits by Ser
gent and a number of small, healthful
works but so sadly insufficient to rep
resent a city of 4,000,000, with a country
of 30,000,000 directly at hand.
The Salon, well, you know the Salon
is such a load. It is like a Thanksgiving
dinner â one gets so full in the middle
of it that it all appears bad. One must
have time before saying whether
French art is worth much at present or
no. My first impression wasâ l won't
' say it, for it would be wrong, you know.
We had the advantage of seeing a
splendid exhibition of earlier French art
Grove, Sonoma Grove, St. Helena Grove,
William Tell Grove, Vilta Grove and Per
severance Grove, and at each place found
gratifying evidence of the prosperity of
the order. At each place the officers
were cordially welcomed, and they were
giyen evidence of the knowledge of the
officers in the secret work which w-i.-s very
satisfactory. At each grove they were
treated to a banquet.
On the occasion of the visit to Sonoma
Grove there was a celebration of its
ninth anniversary. A. G. Bolletti. tno
iirst noble arch, gave an interesting his
tory of the grove, its rise and prosperity,
and there were addresses both in the
grove and at the banquet by members of
the grove and visitors from Petalunvi.

of people, and I just critd last nijfht when
Teddyâ the old darling! I'd do anything to
please himâ told me I must call."
"It's a great pity we old families can't keep
together," said Mrs. Brannan. a stout, high
noted dame. '"I here arc plenty of others for
them to know. Why can't they let us alone?"
"That's Just what they won't do!" cried Mrs.
Washington. "We're what they're after. What's
the reason they've come to Menlo I'ark?
They'll be 'landed aristocracy' In less than
no time. Hanp the luck!"
"Shall you call. Hannah? aeked Mrs. Cart
right. "Dear Jack never imposes any restric
tions on me â he's so handsome about every
thing; co I ehall be guided by you."
"In time," replied Mrs. Yorba, who also hail
had a meaning conference with her husband.
"But I shall not rush. Toward the end of the
summer, perhaps. It would be unwise to take
them up too quickly."
"I've got to give them a dinner." said Mrs.
Washington, with gloom. "But I'll put It off
till the last gun fires. And you've all got to
come. Otherwise you'll see. me on the war
path."
"Of course we Hhall all go, Nelly." said Mrs.
Yorba. "We will always stand In together."
The conversation flowed on. Other person
alities were discussed, the difficulty Of getting
servants to stay In the country, where there
was such a dearth of "me gentleman frien',"
the appearance of the various gardens and the
atrocious amount of water they consumed.
"I wish to goodness the water works on top
wouldn't shut off for eight months in the year,"
exclaimed Mrs. Washington. "Whenever I want
something- in summer that costs a pile. Teddy
groans and tells me that his water bill is four
hundred dollars a month." And Mrs. Washing
ton, whose elderly and doting husband had
never refused to crant her most exorbitant
whim, sighed profoundly. â¢
Magdalena did not find the conversation very
interesting, nor was she called upon to con
tribute to it. Nevertheless she received every
day with her mother and went with her to re
turn the calls. At the end of the summer she
loathed the small talk and Its art, but felt that
she was improving. Her manner was cer
tainly easier. Phe had decided not to emulate
Mr 3. Washington's vernacular, but she at
tempted to copy her ease and graclousness of
manner. In tin^Ji she learned to unbend a lit
tle, to acquire a certain gentle dignity In place
of her natural haughty stiffness, and to utter
the phrases that are necessary to keep conver
sation going; but her reticence never left her
for a moment, her eyes looked beyond the peo
ple in whom she strove to be Interested, and
few noticed or cared whether or not she was
present. Bit at the end of the Bummer she
was full of hope; society might not Interest her,
but the pride which was her chief character
istic commanded that she should hold a tri
umphant place among her peers.
She had told neither of her parents of the
books Colonel Belmont had given her. knowing
that the result would be a violent scene and
an Interdiction. At this stage of her develop

think there were some 500 numbers and
embraced about eighty years â that is to
say, from the early part of the century
to 1390.
I saw many old friends there, and it
was truly as fine and representative a
showing of French art as I have seen,
not barring the retrospective exhibition
of French art in 1889 at the Universal
Exhibition.
When the rot has been cleared away
and the good work gets a chance,
French art trill then be recognized as
quite worthy of most of the praise it
has received. Impressionism appears
to be dead as an influence. I mean the
fad of impressionism, not the principle
that seems to stick as it should. I be
lieve a man could be an avowed im
pressionist to-day without being a fool
and innocent of drawing. I wish we
could transport the collection of im
pressionist work in the Luxembourg to
San Francisco; then we could demnn
trate what it is not. I would Judge that
the academicians had made the collec
tion as a joke. It is a hard one, and the
room that holds it is usually solitude.
The new ronm in the same gallery that
holds the foreign works is not so much
better. That dreadful, dreadful "Span
ish Dancer," by Sergent, is in it. Whist
ler's beautiful monochrome port- an of
his mother is present. There is also a
picture by a young American negro,
Tanner by name (recently bought), that
is wonderfully lacking (for a modern
picture) in the spirit of cleverness and
full of fine promise. The rest are just
as respectable as they should beâ would
shock no one. Yours,

and his companions is one of the most
romantic and interesting of medieval or
of modern times. The manner of the re
turn of the Polos long after they had been
Kiven up for dead, says Mr. Brooks in his
preface, the subsequent adventures of
Alarco Polo, the incredulity with which
his book of travels was received, the
gradual and slow confirmation of the
truth of his reports, as later expeditions
penetrated the mysterious Orient, and the.
fact that he may be justly regarded as
the founder of the geography of Asia,

LETTERS OF GEORGE WILLIAM
CURTIS TO JOHN S. DWIGHT.
Edited by George Willis Cooke.
George William Curtis remains and
must always remain one of the most
worthy and lovable figures in American
literature. These early letters show his
independence, his love of humanity, his
courage in maintaining his own convic
tions, ins chivalrous and romantic spirit,
his literary skill and charm, his profound
spiritual convictions, that would not be
limited by any sectarian bounds, and, in
addition, they constitute the record of one
of the most interesting periods of an un
usually interesting life. Mr. Curtis
formed friendships with Ralph Waldo
Emerson, George P. Bradford. John S.
Dwight. Charles A. Dana, C. P. Crancn,
Margaret Fuller, Thomas Wentworth
Higginson, George Kipley. Henry Thor
eau Nathaniel Hawthorne and many
othersâ friendships which were destined
to ripen and develop later on; and his im
pressions and experiences are duly re
corded in this series of letters.
Mr. Cooke. who edits the letters, gives
in the first third of the book an interest
ing account of the early life at Brook^
Farm and Concord, with reminiscences oÂ£ J
the men Curtis met. George William Cur
tis went to Brook Farm in 1842, when ha
was 18 years old, and the two years ha
spent there formed an important episode
in his life, for although he did not sur
render himself to the associationist Idea,
but remained rather an individualist, yet
he loved the men and women who were
at the head of the community, and it ia
safe to say that without Brook Farm and
transcendentalism his Hfe would have
been less worthy of our admiration. The
winter of 1543-44 he spent at his father's
house in New York, and in the spring of
1544 went to live in Concord for purposes
of study and recreation.
Then come the early letters to Jonn S.
Dwight forty-one in all. dated 1843 to ISI7
inclusive arid in conclusion twenty-one
letters ef later date written at various
times from 1850 to 1886.

LEGITIMATE, AND
BLANCHE BATES AND IBSEN.
IGO to the Orpheum nowadays]
about once in a fortnight, partly to i
see the show, and partly to bask In
the sunshine of prosperity and
pleasure. That the Orpheum pleases
most of the people most of the time ;
has ceased to be a question: it
Is a large opulent fact, the sor
row of all the other managers in .
town, and the delight of the gTeat care
less public. While the other managers
are parting with their hair and their
diamonds the vaudeville enterpreneurs '
on O'Farrel! street grow sleeker and
more besparkled every hour; and even
hen the other theaters are booming !
*it is the same old case of sardine space
and standing room at the Orpheum.
Haven't you noticed when people are !
In doubt where to go that they gen- j
erally turn up at the Orpheum? The '
disadvantages are so few; one grows
accustomed to the unbeautiful audi
torium, the scurrying waiters with the '
beer; and a man who is properly armed
can give back as much bad smoke as j
he gets. I love to go there and lounge
and imagine that I am not working:.
Vaudeville exacts the minimum of
attention from the auditor, and, when
he Is in the right vaudeville mood, gives
him the maximum of comfort. And
there is something restful in the com
mercial security of the house, and the
unpretentious good nature of the crowd.
All sorts of people go to the OrDheum j
now; none are too swell and respectable '
to deny themselves that dissipation: I
and while you see everybody there,
from your employer to the foreign
nobleman who varnishes your boots,
yet the audience has but two very dis
tinguishable identities â and
the gallery. The crowd is so big that
individuals do not seem to count, and
(he veil of smoke helps out the family
v . -.semblance. The Orpheum audience
' has been the same composite for sev
eral years. But the shows . have
changed. The little sawed-off comedies
that at one time had to be fierce and
vulgar or else unheard are now the
crack items of nearly every bill; and
the less "legitimate" turns are of a
softer nature than before. A few years
ago who would have believed that the
Orpheum crowd would have stood for
Miss Mary Norman and the clever
mimetic feats which she is pleased to
call "society caricatures"; or for Mr.
and Mrs. Boyle in thirty-seven minutes
of farce which is almost pure comedy?
In fact who would have believed a few
years ago that Mr. and Mrs. RoÂ«yle
would ever play in the Orpheum or any
other vaudeville house? Mr. Royle Is
a Princeton man, the author of a
charmin- American. comedy. "Friends."
an actor of peculiar idiomatic force,
fleet-witted, natural and possessed of j
graces and culture that practically
would have cost him his life with the â 
Orpheum gallery of a few years back.
Mrs. Boyle (Selina Fetter" is a Ken
tucky gentlewoman and a distinguished j
actress. Her personality Is to me ir
resistible: she has the May Irwin mag
netism legitimized and sublimated. Her
voice is full and free, and she acts with
real Southern hospitality. Having once
seen an authenticated lord on the staere
y .vho played the part absolutely without
conviction, I am not a snob in the mat- |
ter of play actors; but I do ask as
plausible a presentment of a well-bred
character as of any other sort, and am
not particular whether the player is
being natural or affected. It is not to
the disparagement of the Royles that
their manners are not a professional
disguise: the principal point Is that
they fix the play. j

my neighbor the other night when I
saw the Royles in "Captain Impu
dence." He tried to discourage my
enthusiasm by talking Badly about the
decadence of vaudeville. He said that
the variety had lost all Its character
through the introduction of these le
gitimate turns, that they knocked all
the ginger out of the bill, that they
were against the first principles of a
vaudeville show, which are snap and
speed. He sighed for the days of the
black-faced monologulst in the linen
duster, the bounding acrobat, the con
torting young lady who swallowed her
toes, the half-skirted girl with daring
dances and more daring songs. "Why
this show is absolutely respectable. " he
said, disgustedly. "You could bring
your family to see this." I told him
that families always had been features
of the Orpheum audiences, but that it j
had taken a couple of years to work
up the proper appreciation of the "le
gitimate" sketches, and that these
sketches were usually the most expen
sive ones on the programme. "I don't
care what they cost," he growled:
"they are .nothing but stuffers to pad
out the show with. If you want vaude
ville you want that and nothing else.
It's ail very' well to go to a music hall,
but how is a man to know. that he will
see a variety show after he gets
there?" I told him that our sorrow
for several years and our trouble with
the theatrical trust had been in not
knowing where to go to escape a.va
riety show, and that the. Orpheum had
not gone in for the legitimate until the
Baldwin and other big. theaters had

practically given it up. But I couldn't
convince him. He said that only act
ors who were "has beens" and failures
went into this work, and that the pub
lic in New York was sick of it, and
that it was merely a question of weeks
before San Francisco would feel the
same. "The 'legitimate' fad is on the
wane now in New York," continued
my companion; "you mark me, that
when one of these broken-down lead
ing men looks for a vaudeville job next
year the manager will ask him if he
can do a double back-action song and
dance. This legitimate fake is played
out. If the actors want to stay in
vaudeville with short hours and long
salaries they had better fall in and
ara the business in the good old
ay."
But these bodeful remarks didn't spoil
ny fun in the least. Nothing could be
luicker, cleaner and more complete
nan Mr. and Mrs. Royle and their
ompany of two in "Captain Impu
ience." I saw the piece in its premiere
and in its entirety some three years
back at the California, There were at
least sixty-seven seperate plays in it
then, ranging from melodramas to
?omic operas. The mills grind slowly,
but I am glad to see that at last Mr.
Royle has parted company with the
unworthy sixty-six.

of Anna Held at the Orpheum in the

later on in the show he displays his

ple delight In complicating Ibsen, who
writes practical plays for the practical
theater. I hope that Miss Bates and
the company v.ill realize that the wiz
ard of the north is as simple as Sardou
or Shakespeare, and that of all Ibsen's
pieces, "A Doll's House" comes the
nearest to being "popular." There is
really no reason why we should follow
up the performance with a fight about
its meaning. Also I hope that Miss
Bates will not tire herself with the
tarantella in the second act. The dance
was her sad moment In "The Dancing
Girl," and if she all but cut this one
she will be merely following the pre
cedent of nearly all the great European
actresses who have played Nora.

happiness there must be but one line of
thought between husband and wife, each
bearing an equal important relation, to
the other. In "A Doll's House" Nora, the
wife, worships Torvald, her husband, as a
superior and almost supreme being. To
save him from punishment for an excus
able crime committed in his youth, she
commits forgery. Making this sacrifice
in his behalf she discovers that her Idol
has been one of brass with feet of clay,
and that in truth she is the superior be
ing, so much so that there can never
again be/any harmony between them, and
so they part.

Sydney Grundy's "Sowing the Wind"
commences a week's engagement at the
Columbia to-morrow evening. This play,
which promises to rank as the great ef
fort of Sydney Grundy's life, is now in
its third season in this country. In New
York, Chicago and other large cities it
was the theatrical sensation of the year
1893-94, and its popularity Is still great.
It selects from the two sexes an able
champion and representative of each and
puts them against each other in one of
the fiercest and most relentless intellec
tual conflicts ever depicted on the stage.
The woman has been thrust into the
world without the boon of lawful parent
age, and through the irony of fate the
man responsible for her situation is now
the guardian of her lover standing be
tween her and the only happiness of
which she has ever dreamed, objecting
to her marriage because of the very con
ditions that have resulted from his own
youthful perversity, though his relation
ship to her is not made known to him
until the denouement of the play. The
woman, stung and maddened by the terri
ble injustice that rests upon her, and yet
unconscious that she is speaklrtg to the
author of her first great wrong, bursts up
on him in a moment of wild emotion, with
a most fearful arraignment to the sterner
sex for its pitilt-ss treatment of woman-
I hood. The man. wounded by the truth
fulness of the charge, and writhing in
'the secret consciousness of his own guilt,
rallies from the staggering effects of the
i assaults and rushes to a desperate de
i fense. The- contest is on. the battle cry
i Is "sex against sex." The cast includes
i Howard Hall, W. H. Turner, Thomas
! David, Julien Barton, A. D. Richardson,
I William J. Cornejl, R. A. Bennett, Walter
i Matthews. Amelia Gardner, Janet Bar
rington. Eugenic Hayden, Ella Bailey

The yellow kid will be Introduced to
â  the local stage at the California to-night
in the farce comedy "Hogan's Alley."
The yellow kid pictures are hardly as
well known here as in New York, but
still they are familiar, and doubtless
many persons will be interested to see
how Micky Dugan fares as the central
figure in a farce comedy.
In addition to the latest songs, ballads
and rag-time ditties, several new fea
tures have been given the road produc
tion, including Hogan's Alley and Cycle
Club and illuminated roof garden.

"The Indian," a comparatively new
play, by Lewis Morrison, will be seen
here' for the first time::u Alurosco's to
morrow night. It is a spectacular melo
drama of " Washington and the Western

on facts. It throws the warm light of
melodrama on thievery at the Indian
agencies and warfare as practiced by the
Sioux. Mr. Brophy will impersonate the
two Indian heroes, Blue Feather and Red
Feather, and Miss Arwood will be 'the
Amtrieaji girl. Two newcomers are in

Of the new people who will appear at
the Orpheum Carl Hertz is regarded as
the star attraction. He will appear in,
his famous illusion, "Vanity Fair," in
which his assistant. Mile. d'AJton, while
standing before a mirror, suddenly dis
appears. A peculiarity of the work done
by Carl Hertz is that it is all done on
the open stage without the aid of cur
tains or screens and in full light. The
Newsboys' Quintet is regarded as a musi
cal novelty. They have made a hit in
the East. Raymun Moore, the popular
song writer, will sing his own songs,
and Pearl Andrews, the mimic, will imi
tate famous actresses. Sells and Young,
acrobats and pantomimists, are from the

THE WOOL TRADE.
V. REASONS WHY THE BUSINESS
SO DULL.
! he private circular of Jacob Wollner cays:
"Our local Wool .market is. still dull. Fail
wools are arriving quite freely. .The sales at
lied Bluff, Ukiah and Cloverdale were post
poned until the middle of November, as the
buyers and sellers could not agree on a price.
"From . the Eastern markets the latest re
ports are that there is more wool selling, more
inquiry, and that there is no doubt but ll.^t
there will be large sales and a good demand
shortly, especially if the cold weather, which
has â¢-! in in the Eastern and Western States, â  j
will continue so that people will have to buy. I
heavy clothing. ' â¢ â¢
"There are several reasons for the wool mar
. kets of the United States being so unsatis
factory. ' The principal reason i*> the after
math of the free wool tariff, It paralyzed the
wool industry for four years and a good deal
of wool accumulated; then, on the eve of the
Plngley bill going into effect, millions of
pounds, of foreign wool and millions of dollars
worth of foreign -manufactured goods, -- â¢ â¢
dally the cheaper grades, were brought into j
tills country. After the Dingley.biU went into j
operation a it of speculators went .into the
market and advanced wool from 75 to" 100 per
cent, when the tariff only made a difference of
from 25 to 40 per cent. In fact, from the first
Of August until the first of December, 1S!Â»T,
there was only a speculative market, some
wools being turned over three or four times at j
a srood profit. Manufacturers laid in large
supplies of wool, many of them: at enhanced
values, discounting the future by 25 to 40 per
cent. Then came an open winter with mild
weather, so, of course, heavy weights would
not 11,- and although the year 1897 was very
prosperous for the Western farmer he thought
more of paying off his mortgage than of buying
new clothes or blankets, and the consequence
v.<.- that manufacturers and jobbers accumu- I
lated large stocks besides the imported goods.
"At shearing time this year- the growers |
asked high prices, in some Instances 100 per
cent more than prevailed druing the previous
three years, and so most of the clip went into j
dealers' hands at high figures. When the light !
weight season I r.ed in August last everybody
expected a move' or a demand at good prices,
but they counted without their host, as then
l!:- cheap manufactured goods of Europe im
ported- last year, came Into play- and knocked,
the manufacturers out of business, as they.
could, not set orders for light weight goods
Wool still continues to accumulate, â¢ with no
demand. . " :
"Although the country is prosperous, the p< â¢
ple, after four years of ' hard .times, have
learned the lesson of economy, and although
they bought clothing during that time it was â¢
of the cheaper and poorer quality, and they
have not yet come- to buying better goods, and
still want suits of clothes from $6 to $S and
ladles' dress goods from 20 to 50 cents per
yard. . -; -â â "."..â¢
"After the tariff went Into effect last year
most of the woolen mills which had "deduced
wages raised them again as they were before
the free wool tariff went into effect, and of
course it added to the price of manufactured
goods. . â  â .;:â¢:â¢
"Wool statistically is in good position, and
anybody who wants to sell at from 2J to 40 per
cent of prices prevailing during the free wool
tariff will easily find customers. Although ]
dealers are well loaded up with high-priced .
wools, it is only a question of time when â 
prices realized Will be most satisfactory to
both growers and dealers. â¢ â â â¢'â¢

THE 11 AY MARKET.
The circular of EJcott .<i Mapner says of Hay:
"Receipts of Hay during th^ last six days
have been 22 > hie part of
t en Alfalfa Hay.
"The market for the last ten days' has been
easy. The demand in every direction ha* been
lighter, and the feeling generally has been de
pressed. Much more effort has been necessary
to place consignments on their arrival, and
concessions on prices have had to be made.
The market at this time ;- decidedly Flow.
"There has been a little strictly gilt-edge
Wheat Hay on the market, which has com
manded is per ton. Such Hay is exceptionally
Fcaroe. as out of the entire week's receipts
there has only been about one-half-dozen cars
of such kind. . .
" 'Foreign' Hay â There has been some Hay
arriving daily from Oregon .and Nevada, and
such Hay as found sales at the following
figures: Wheat Hay. $13 to $I.*; Cheat Hay.

Hay, $12 50 to $14 per ton on tile, car here.
"Alfalfa Hayâ Receipts of this class of Hay
have continued to be very large. and the
market for Bucn is exceptionally dull and sales
therefore slow. Prices are very easy. Choicest

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
:n\V YORK, Oct. 29.â With the ex?eptlon of
â t Monday the average of prices on the Stock
â¢â¢â  :.ang<? has. shown a net advance for each
Â«!nce Wednesday, October 19. There was
. era! -expectation, therefore, that there
â 'â¢1 be the selling to take profits to-day
. is customary among professional traders
end of the week. The buoyant tone of
it the specialties held the market firm In
>t hour of the short session. Consoll
â  Gas and Third Avenue Jumped six points,
rmer.on talk c* the termination of the
-as war". Tobacco continued its ajrgres
bJvÂ« advance on the strength of the develop
ments showing the accretion of plug tobacco
companies. The stock was very active and
iÃrge blocks were absorbed to make way for
the upward course of the stock. The process
of bidding up the price of the Federal Steol
â ec'irltifte s.lso continued. Advances in those
and in Metropolitan Btreet Railway. New Jer
iey Central, Minnesota Iron and International
Paper preferred were between one and two
points. Meantime the railroad list was very
â¢ dull and showed only Blight changes, although
nearly all changes were gains'. The publica
tion of the Burlington statement for Septem
ber resulted' In Immediate, activity In the
grangers at the expense of values. Losses
reached about a point in the other members of
the group amd IV4 in Burlington itself.- There
was a 'general reaction in the railroad list In
sympathy, but the railroad stocks generally
; were not active and losses were confined to
i fractions. Burlington's decrease of $484, In
gross earnings, compared with â  September of
.last year, Â«an a distinct disappointment,, the
more so as St. Paul's weekly statement had
shown an Increase of about the same amount
for- the same period." The delayed movement of
wheat in Burlington's territory and the large
proportion of its business that is given to corn
were advanced to explain the poor showing.
Prices continued heavy in the railroads to the
close, but net declines were restricted to frac
tions outside the grangers and 'specialties. The
bank statement was without . infiuen-ce on
stocks, though the growing strength of the
clearing house institutions was evident.
The foreign exchange market alone hart been
affected by the foreign situation, and In this the
growing dependence of foreign financial mar
kets upon the resources of this country's mar
kets was strikingly illustrated. With the sud
den drop in British and French Government
securities on Monday and early on Tuesday
and the upward, surge of discount rates In
London- and at all Continental centers, the
actual charge for demand sterling jumped up
]' 4 cents on the pound on account of the heavy
selling of securities here for London account,
and the high money rates for money abroad
had their effect on the exchange market, and
with the later developments In Paris there was
buying of London exchange reported here for
Paris account, while Paris exchange in New
York weakened, reflecting the pressure of timid
Paris capital for transfer to London. The price
of sterling exchange has since dropped a cent
with the calmer feeling abroad. Another short
lived factor which was made .much of by the
bears on Monday was the Supreme Court de
cision against the Joint Traffic Association.
The gloomy forebodings of the bears regarding
the effect on railroads of this decision were
forgotten by Tuesday morning. Doubt the
fact that trans-Missouri railroads, whose asso
ciation had already been outlawed, were mak
ing money in abundance, while the legal exist
ence of the Joint Traffic Association here
proved of no avail to prevent rate cutting,
and decreased earnings on the trunk lines had
its influence in reforming the bears' opinions.
The rate cutting among the trunk line? ana tn â¢
continued depression in the anthracite and
bituminous coal industries are the ;.-. -i ihr
enlng- clouds on the horizon of the stock mar
ket.
Bonds have shown increasing activity and |
strength during the week, the volume of deal- j
Ing on Friday rising to $5,315,000. Bonds of ;
Western and Southwestern roads and reorpan- I
ization bonds generally have been the favorites. .
.There have been large dealings in the Gov
ernment 3s coupon, and the record price, 106%,

vanced % and the old is coupon and the us

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK, Oct. Sit.â The Financier snys: i
Tr.e statement of the Associated Ranks of New
York for the week ending Oct iber ZS shows a I
notable Increase In the various Items. Loans â 
reflect a fain of 110,227,310, making the total
exo.mMon- for the month of October almost !
; . The increase in cash f.;r the week j
vas. $6,03-1,400, made up principally of specie
receipts. The gain in cash and the loan ex
pansion account for the week increased $15,
in deposits. The heavier deposits, of
course, raised the reserve requirement, but not
enough to offset the cash gain, in consequence
the ' surplus reserve of the banks is $2,679,225
hlf.her than for the previous week and stands !
at $26,0!n.560, or nearly $22,000.00ti more than [
reported on September 1" last. Changes that j
have occurred within the past thlrtv days are I
well shown In the deposit item, which In the
time named has Increased over $">9. 000.000. Nat
urally these conditions .reflect the completion
of the bon i transaction and the effect of Gov
ernment deposits and gold imports. Of greater
interest, however, is the effect which has been
made by the money market in having declined
to low figures after a period of partial string
ency. The outlook under present conditions
favors an easy money market. The natural â¢
drift of monÂ»- now that crop necessities have
been met is in favor of New York, and even
with a business revival the supply will ex
ceed the demand.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. Wheat got a weak start
from an apparent disposition at Liverpool to
chime In with the bearish sentiment prevail
ing here. The firm tone of English Govern
ment securities also contributed ' by their
strength to the desire to sell wheat at the
opening. Prices continued to drop throughout
the forenoon despite considerable buying
against puts that the opening decline brought
into play. Northwest receipts liberal, 1141
cars, but a snowstorm was reported to be pre
vailing in the Dakotas, which created appre
hension of bad roads and a consequent failing
off In receipts in that region next week. Some
buying of short wheat was done because of
that possibility. The seaboard reported a fair
export business and New York advised sales
of 35 boat loads, of which one cargo was for
Russia. Near the end a large line of cash
wheat was disposed of here for export to tha
United Kingdom right at the market price.
When that became known the sentiment among
traders was quickly changed, and in the en
deavor to cover that followed the price L urged
ahead and the early loss was regained. â  De
cember closed %c lower. Fine weather and
Liverpool cables rushed corn down at the
start. The offerings easily depressed prices.
Later, however, the market became strong on
a good cash business. Near the close the
buying became more pronounced and prices
wound up at a slight advance.
OatÂ« reserved the strength from the firm
ness in the shipping situation. Cash held at a j
strong premium over May and there was a |
fair speculative trade in futures. May closed
i,; advance.
Provisions ruled fairly steady on a light i
speculative, trade and liberal receipts. It was
reported that 2,500,000 pounds of ribs were dis- j
posed of yesterday on October contracts, but
contrary to expectations this announcement
did not have any influence on the market.
Pork gained sc; Lard 2%c and ribs unchanged.

HIS MOTHER'S
TRUE CHAMPION
BY MARIE ALLEN KIMBALL,
MARYSVILLE-
DICK NELSON and the Johnson
boys were going on a camping
trip up the river. They were
intending to hunt and fish and
have a Jolly .time. Dick was
a ihe porch getting his traps to
gether, when he heard his mother and
â¢ < hinese cook talking in the dining
room.
"You must sweep better than that,
<iow," his mother was saying,, "look at
the dirt in those corners."
"No care," answered the Chinaman,
-*>-; "him pi**nty good. No catchee
much money; work a!le time."
"Grow, you know better:"
"You no Ukee him, you fix him you
self. Me go town; no iikee work for
you. Y'.u heap meant growled t'i^
cook, Blamming the chairs about.
Dick flung open the door, and strid
ing up to the Chinaman seized him by
the shoulder.
"S< â¢ he cried; "do you know
you are talking to my mother?"
Gow threw up his hands and caught
th>- boy by the front of his luo.se .shirt,
; g It tifiht around hii? neck.
flew Dick's fist squarely in the
Chinaman's face. Hi* grasp relaxed
and down he went, knocking over a
chair and coining to the floor with, a
tr< mendous bump.
I >ick stood ovÂ«r him, the picture pf

. picked, himself up and looked
dn~ed. Blood was dropping from his
!!â¢â  muttered something that
sounded like "Me no stay, me go town."
an i went off through the kitchen to his
cabin.
Mis. Nelson sank down on the near
est chair, white and trembling. Dick
looked rather shamefaced, thouen 'the
flush of anger was still on his cheeks.
"J didn't mean to be quite s>> rough
â¢ >!i the old fellowâ just to teach him
.ace.' he muttered.
"Suppose you had killed him, any son.
That you did not mean to -would i>-.t
have counted them," said his .noth^r
gr.ively.
Dick turned confusedly away.
"What shall I do?" his mother w^nt
on. "He will not work any more and
there are all those men to get dinner
for. Your father has gone to to* â >
and I am nearly sick with the head
ache."
" "Us pretty rough," said the boy.
"Bui we'll have to make the best of.
it, " linished hLs mother, trying to smtta
and rising wearily to go into the
kitchen. "But I >u k." she went on,
"you must feed the pips and water the
calves before you start. Gow always
does and I cannot."
Dick picked up the pails and went out
to the x>en. The pigs came grunting up
and began eating their breakfast with
swishes of delight. The boy leaned on
the fence thinking uncomfortably. If
he went away this morning his delicate
mother would be left alone with the
â¢work and that ugly Chinaman. He had
heard that they had "terrible tempers.
What if Gow should avenge his hurt on
her? Yet how could he give up his trip?
He had promised the others and they
would be as disappointed as he. He
had everything ready, too, and the boys
could only be spared to go now. But
"would he take any pleasure if he
thought something dreadful might have
happened at home?
"Pshaw," he said to himself, "China
men are too big cowards to do any
thing." but the distrust and suspicion
would not be quieted and ihe boy ha/1
a sharp, fight with himself.
"It's no use," he determined at last,
giving himself a mental shake as ho
heard a shrill whistle announcing that
the boys had come, "I made this mesa
and I've got to see it through. '
A pang went through him when h<:
Baw his young friends, with their fish
and blankets, but he held rigidly
to his determination against th^ir dis
appointment and persuasion?, for D+rk
wae a â most-sought-after companion.
He waited untii they drove away and
â went into the house. His mother was
Bitting in the hot kitchen holding her
aching head.
"Here, mother," called out Dick.
cheerfully, "you go to bed and Til Â£et

dinner. I guess the men can stand no
cooking for once."
"Why, aren't you going?"
"No, 1 sent the boys on. 1 don't mean
to get you into such a fix as this and
then go back on you," said Dick, with
out revealing his other motive.
You are very good, Dick," said his
mother, thankfully, "and 1 shall always
remember it."
"Oh, it's nothing," replied the boy.
"Go and sleep off your headache."
Dick had a great time cooking that
dinner. The teakettle was dry and the
meat burned before he knew it; but
with what he found already cooked hÂ»J
managed to get a passable sort of meal
for the hungry men.
He was getting ready to wash the
dieh<-s t wh>n Uuw came in, exhaling a
strong odor of peppermint. Tin- China
man's face was a sight to behold! One
eye was black and swollen to immense
proportions and his nose vas skinned
and red where it had come in contact
with Dick's hard young knuckles.
"Hello, Gow," said the boy, "sit down
ami eat your dinner. I say, I didn't
mean to use you up- that bad. If we
had known it was going to happen we
could have- bought some beefsteak of
the butcher; it's fine for a black eye."
Gow Kiunted out something, got the
teapot and sat down at the end of the
disorderly kitchen table. He watched
the great boy wrestling with the dishes,
looking out of his one open eye with
malicious pleasure as he leisurely drank
his tea. Dick kept up one end of a
brisk conversation, which was some
thing <>f a monologue, however, as he
elicited only grunts from his auditor.
At last Gow did unbend enough to
change the meat from the pantry to the
safe, muttering to Dick something
about "ants catch him, you put him
there," which the hoy took as a pro
pitiouji omen. Then Gow shuffled out
to his cabin.
When Dick came hurrying in to start
supper, having almost forgotten it ir
the excitement of a coon hunt in the big
tree behind the barn, he found Gow
building the fire. Meditation or Dick's
remark about the fresh meat had evi
dently had some effect on him. He sent
the boy out. saying "Me fix him; you
breakee too muchee dish."
When they were seated at the sup
prr table the old Chinaman came In,
holding his head on one side and draw
ing down the Ud of his black and swol
len eye, said pathetically to Dick's
father. "Hoss man, boss man; you look
seÂ»- what your boy do."
Mr. Nelson, who had already heard
the Btory, said with affected surprise,
"Why. why! you don't say so! Rich
ard "âwith pretended severity â "you
look out what you are about! Gow, you
see you'll have to be careful how you
talk to Dick's mother!"
"Me flaid to stay; me have to go
town."
"Well," said the farmer, laughing, "I
shall not take you until that eye gets
well. Why, Gow, it would be a disgrace
to the family!"
The next morning Gow got breakfast
and seemed to have thought better of
his decision for he said to Dick when he
brought in the milk, "You takee litte
cart: go catchee boys; catchee fish. Me
all lite, me cook, take care you mudder,
ebery ting."
OUR FUNNY BONES.
"Mamma, has the captain's boat got
stems on it?" was asked by our six
year-old daughter. Before we could
answer some one laughed so she cor
rected herself and said, "I mean flag
poles!" She meant masts.
A little girl who had a fondness for
long words was one day playing school
with her dolls. She was speaking quite
emphatically when her mother said:
"My dear, do not speak so loud; it is
better to speak gently."
"Yes. mamma, but you see I wish to
make a deep indentation upon my
scholars." ,
Little Nellie, the 5-year-old daughter
of a clergyman, had been listening at
fi'tively to a Bible story. "Now, Nel
lie," asked her mamma, "can you tell
me what we must do before we can
expect our sins to be forgiven?"'
"Course I can," she replied; "we've
got to sin first."
"When you go to heaven, grandma,
will you play a harp?" "I suppose so,
dear." "Then why don't you take- les
sons?"

THE STOLEN
CARMELITA
BY ALICE D. JOHNSON,
HAYWAKDS.
IN a beautiful mansion In Italy
lived Ramona, a rich nobleman, and
his wife. They were quite happy,
but there was one thing lacking to
make them perfectly happy, and
that was a child.
Soon a beautiful little girl was born
to them and now their happiness was
complete. The little girl, whom they
named Carmelita. grew to be more
beautiful every day. She had black,
curly hair, and large black eyes and a
dark gypsy - like complexion. Her
father and mother were very proud of
her, and well might they be, for she
had a very sunny and lovable disposi
tion.-
When little Carmellta was 6 years
old she went one day to gather flow
ers in 'the woods near by. But she
never came home again and every one
grew alarmed. Ramona sent soldiers
out everywhere, but they didn't get any
tidings of her. Suddenly' he thought of
the woods and sent a band of soldiers
there to look for her, but they couldn't
find .her.

Ramona and his wife were so grieved
over the loss of their child that they

they were happy again, but not per
fectly happy, for how could they be
when their darling Carmelita wag lost?
This little girl they named Mignon
and she was fully as beautiful and lov
able as Carmelita. Mignon's parents
often told her about CÂ«rme!ita and she
used to wonder if Carmelita was dead
or alive. Of course they all believed
she "was dead.
One day when little Mignon was 7
years old she went with her mother
into the woods to gather flowers. She
gathered flowers and sang and laughed
till her mother called her to go home.
On their way home they met some
travelers. One of them was a beau
tiful girl about 13 years old, who looked
tired and weary, but seemed happy to
be in Italy. Mignon and her mother
looked at the travelers, when Mignon
said: "Mother, isn't that a beautiful
girl?" Her mother thought so, too, and
finally thought she would inquire who
she was. "I was born here," said the
girl, "and I have been living in France
till now. My name is Carmelita,
and â "

mm's mother took Carmelita. in her
arms and kissed her, saying: "Oh, my
darling, lost child!"
Carmelita looked awhile at her
mother and said: "Ah, yes, I remem
ber, you are my mother!"
"And I am your sister," said Mlg
non.
Then Carmelita said: "Mother, he
stole me while I was playing in the
woods."
Whereupon the man answered, "I did
not; if â " but he got no further, for
Carmelita's mother waved toward the
house and a troop of soldiers came and
put him in chains.
The three walked home, and when
Ramona saw them he looked at Car
melita a moment, then took her in his
arms and said: "My darling lost child!"
FROM THE DARK
INTO THE LICHT
BY L. I. M.
MAMMA, can I go ovpr to Em
ily's house now?" asked little
Mary ('olernan.
"Have you sewed the button
on your coat and the string on
your blue hat?" Mrs. Coleman asked,
looking at her little girl reproachfully.
Mary blushed and hung her head.
"No, mamma," she said, "but please,
can't I sew them on to-night?"
"To-night," said her mother, "you
have your lessons to study, and even
if you hadn't, Mary, you must learn
to 'never put off for to-morrow what
can be done to-day.' "
"Well, I don't believe any other little
girl has to sew buttons on her dress
and strings on her hat like I do," Mary
said as she settled down to work.
"Why, Mary," said Mrs. Coleman,
"you scarcely have forgotten those poor
little Jones children. Why, how glad
they would be if instead of going to
the factory every day they could stay
at home and sew their clothes. And
Just look at poor little Helen Cary, who
is blind."
"Oh, to be sure." said Mary, bright
ly, "and we haven't been to see her for
nearly a week, mamma. Can we go
to-day?" _____
"I do not see anything to prevent our
going after supper," said Mrs. Coleman,
"if you think you can get your lessons
learned in time."
"I am nearly finished sewing:,
mamma, and then I will get my books
to study right away," Mary said as the
coat and hat were finished and put in
their proper place.
After supper the carriage was called,
and soon Mary and her mother were on
iheir way to Helen's house. Helen
(/ary was the only child of a widowed
mother; she wan born blind, and her
mother was always sick, and had it
not been for the kindness of Mrs. Cole
man and Mary the poor family would
have had a miserable life. When Mrs.
Coleinan's soft knock was heard at the
floor Mrs. Cary would feel as though
a great weight had been lifted from her
shoulders.
"Helen, my dear," said Mrs. Coleman,
after she had stopped talking to Mrs.
Cary, "I have good news for you. My
husband told me of a doctor who can
cure blind people, and if your mother
is willing I -will take you to him nmv."
"Oh, Mrs. ("ok-man!" cried thy poor
girl. "How can I ever thank you
enough?" Then, as she went In to
ward the bed, she said: "Mother, are
you willing? Can I go?"
"Yes, my child," said Mrs. Cary; "but
I am afraid he will charge a great
deal."
"Do not worry about the bill, dear
\'rÂ«. Cary. lam fully able to pay tne
bill. Well, I will say good-by, as I see
Helen is ready."
When they reached the doctor's
house, Mrs. Coleman told him all she
kne w about Helen's eyes. After a great
deal of pain Helen could see. She
could hardly believe it. When she
reached her neat little home she rushed
up to her mother and gazed unon her.
"Oh, mother!" she cried, "I can set.
I ought to be, oh, how thankful, to God
and to kind Mrs. Coleman."
"Oh, mamma," said Mary, while
they were on their way home, "how
glad I am we could do good to other
people and make them happy."
Mrs. Coleman begged Mrs. Cary to let
Helen study under the same teacher
that Mary had. Bo at last she con
sented, and Mary and Helen grrew to be
fast friendo, and Helen never forgot In
any way how kind her mother had
been to her.
THE VICTORY
OF* BRAVE HOP
PART 11.
THE Ogres did not underestimate
the courage and cleverness of
Hop-o'-My-Thumb. At the in
stant that he blew the hunting
horn that hung from his girdle
the OgTes strode forward to meet the
Knights. Some of the monsters ran
forward to the plate where the bridge
had stood, for there was the only place
where it was possible to ford the
stream Their purpose was to cut off
the retreat of Hop-o'-My-Thumb and
the Knights, who, they supposed, would
now be so badly scared that a retreat
would occur. â 
Twang! Hop-o'-My-Thumb had
speedily fixed an arrow of stout hickory
on his bow string and had let fly. True
and swiftly to its mark it sped. The
point was tipped with the sharpest
steel. The shaft was feathered from
the plumage of the Jazzow, which
makes its nest only in th* craters of
volcanoes, in the most distant lands of
the world. The point pierced the eye
of the foremost Ogre and he fell heav
ily as when, before the wrath of- the
hurricane, down topples the pride and
monarch of the mountain forest, and
all the earth quakes.
Down went the Ogre with a dreadful
groan and was dead. Encouraged by
this success the Knights, who were all
expert archers, drew their bows and
with the same kind of arrows, all of
which had been provided by Hop-o'-
My-Thumb for the expedition, made
the Iron Forest resound with twanging
bowstrings and whistling arrows, and
more than one Ogre bit the dust. In
deed, the monsters, although they were
so huge, had little real courage. They
had expected to crush Hop-o'-My-
Thumb and his fifty Knights with ease.
The prowess of their antagonists
caused the Ogres to draw back, whereat
the Knights raised a rousing cheer.
That was a mistaken cheer. Ma
linge, the Witch, who had been slum
bering in her cave, heard the noise.
Hastily issuing from her retreat she
mounted a grizzly old winged nag,
seized a two-pronged spear and flew to
the scene of the combat, uttering
shrieks of rage and wonder. The scene
presented to her view increased her an
ger. Some of her Ogres were cower
ing behind trees. Others stood aloof
at a distance, uncertain what to do.
"Cowards, cowards!" shrieked the
Witch: "is it for this that I made the
awful brew that called you into exist
ence? Is this the loyalty and valor
you were to show by which the King
dom of the Prince was to be laid waste
and all the cities, castles and palaces,
with the people, cattle and prow
ing crops, were to be turned to ashes?
Advance and seize these pigmies be
fore they lay other Ogres low! Is it
for such as you that I seized the
Prince's daughter and brought war
upon us? Advance, I say!"
You have already learned how the
Seven League Boots ciime into the pos
session of Hop-o'-My-Thumb. So you
will recollect that the boots made
themselves large or small, according to
the size of their wearers. Hop-o'-My-
Thumb had on the Boots when he en
tered the Iron Forest and still wore
them. He could easily have run away,
but a clever thought came into his ac
tive brain. He had heard that whoso
ever, within the Iron Forest, dared the
Witch to personal combat could bid
"*II others in the For-"* to stand still,
vliile he fought the Witch.
Just as the Ogres once more hastened
on to kill him and his comrades, Hop
o'-My-Thumb callod aloud: â 
"Aroint thee. Witch! Thou and I
â will meet. If I fall, then you shall
slay my Knights. If thdu shalt fall,
then from the bewitched soil of the Iron
Forest shall be torn the routs or these
horrible trees; so, also, shall thy Ogres
perish. Propare!"
Then, for the first time, the "Witch
was afraid. For it had been written
in a great tome of brass that the Witch
should be destroyed by a person no
larger than a man's thumb. But she
put spurs to her horse, which darted, as
a vulture darts from the sky, to de
stroy Hop-o'-My-Thumb. In her strong
grasp the Witch held her two-pronged
spear, and she made at Hop-o'-My-
Thumb with deadly- purpose and aim.
When she reached the spot where he
had been standing he was miles away,
he having made one stride with his
Seven League Boots just in the nick
of time to avoid being pierced.
"Ah, ha; so that is it, my little
man?" muttered the Witch spitefully
as she wheeled her nag and again flew
at him.
Hop-o'-My-Thumb was chuckling at
his cleverness when the winged nag
AiraiÃ iwooped through the air. Again
he dodgfd, and again and again, until
the nag was tired and could fly no
more. Then Hop-o'-My-Thumb be
came the attacker. When the Witch
paw him coming she made a magic cir
cle around her, across which no human
being could step. Within this circle
she changed her shape to a mouse, to
a snake and to a big spider. Hop-o'-
My-Thumb was not fooled, but knew
her all the time and would not let her
cross the line that surrounded the
magic circle. His sword hud been
filled with magic, when he struck fire
with it in the Iron Forest, although he
did not know it. The Witch knew and
feared the sword.
Finally she changed herself to a
lioness. In this shape she foolishly
ventured out to battle. On she came
ferociously, but Hop-o'-My-Thumb
stepped nimbly aside and struck her a
blow with his maslc sword, as she
passed, and cut off her head with the
blow. So that ended the Witch.
When she fell dead the spell over the
Ogres was broken and the battle with
the Knights was straightway renewed.
Attacked from all sides, the Knights
were in sore plight once more. There
were so many Ogres that the Knights
were kept dodging about until they
were out of breath, and they wer" not
given a chance to use their bows and
arrows. How the battle would have
ended had not Hop-o'-My-Thumb been
there, I cannot say; but I fear that the
Knights would have been killed, one
and all, and the Kinedom of the Prince
would have been ruined.
Hop-o'-My-Thumb drew off one of
his Seven League Boots and touched
it to the foot of an Ogre who had fallen
in the fray. At once the boot became
very large to fit the Ogre. Hop-o'-
My-Thumb hacked the boot into
one hundred fragments with his sword.
To every Knifrht he gave two frag
ments. When these were placed in
the riding boots of the Knights their
magic was such that all the riding
boots speedily became Seven League
Boots. Hop-o'-My-Thumb cut his re
maining boot into two pieces, and each
piece became a whole Seven League
Boot in a jtffy.
It was now easy for the Knights to
get away from the Ogres, to wnom an
CUT THIS IN SIX PARTS AND PUT TOGETHER SO AS TO FORM THIRTEEN STARS
end would speedily have been made had
not Hop-o'-My Thumb prevented the
Knights from using their bows and ar
rows. He had another plan in view.
Mounting the Witch's winged nag,
which was now rested and vigorous,
he ordered the nag to fly to where the
daughter of the Prince was held a pris
oner, and the. Knights were command
ed to follow.
The Seven League Boots enabled the
Knights to keep up with the flying nag.
They looked very brave and hapoy as
they Btrode from mountain top to
mountain top, leaped over rivers and
stalked across deep canyons and wide
valleys. By and by they saw a castle
of pure gold glittering in the sunlight
on a distant mountain top, and, as the
nag fieg directly toward this castle
they knew that their journey was
nearly ended. The little Princess was
indeed in the castle. The Knights cut
off the heads of the lions that guarded
the castle gates, all of whom were
witches, and entered the room where
were kept all the secret books of magic.
In these books they found out how to
make the Ogres obey them. At once
thy proper charm was set to working
an'< the Ogres, knowing Hop-o'-My-
Thumb now as their master, appeared
at the castle gate. Hop-o'-My-Thumb,
having found and released the little
Princess from a dungeon, where she
had cruelly been hung up by her hair
by the Witch, ordered the Ogres to cut
down the huge forest trees to make a
level road. Then he caused the great
chains to be fastened to the foundation
of the Palace of Solid Gold, which, be
ing all in one piece, was easily moved
by the combined strength of the Ogres,
which was very great.
The Ogres, having taken their places
at the chains, were ordered to proceed.
They obeyed. The road was extended
through the Iron Forest and into the
Kingdom of the Prince and along it
the Palace of Solid Gold steadily
moved. The Prince heard of these
wonderful things from a trusty Knight
whom Hop-o'-My-Thumb sent forward
as a messenger, and he came out from
his city, attended by the Pri.ncess and
all his court and thousands of Knights,
to welcome his child and to honor Hop
o'-My-Thumb, who have ever sinre
lived in the Palace of Solid Gold. The
Ogres are his servants. D. H. W.
GRANDMA'S HOUSE.
BY FLORENCE R. KENDERDINE.
DO you recollect thinking, when you
were a boy.
That visits to grandma's held all the
earth's joy.
t the cookies which grew on her high
pantry shelf
Were just the right things for a small
hungry elf?
That the apples which fell on- the old
orchard ground
Could not be surpassed though you sought
the world round?
Did you ever go fishing with thread and
bent pin.
Along the wee brook that minnows lived
in?
Did you wade in the pond that was shal
low and clear,
Or try to skute on it when winter was
here?
Then the snow, and the coasting, the long,
merry rideâ
Ah! I can remember those visits with
PUZZLEâ FIND THE BALD-HEADED MAN.
I have traveled, but elsewhere in lands
I have seen
The sun shone less brightly, the fields
looked less green.
E'en the song of the birds seemed less
cheery and sweet,
And plants now in bloom In my garden
so neat
Are Ipss beautiful fa* than the daisies so
tall
Thai grew by the side of the old orchard
wall.
Would that .each change of season that
visit could bring,
For close to my heart the fond memories
cling
Of the old country homestaad, and often
I see
In fancy that picture so happy and free.
And I long as I tread through the wide
city street
To go as of yore to that peaceful retreat.
THE SAD FATE
OF A DOLLIE
BY NELLIE TRIMBLE.
MY father bought me a doll that
would talk. What do you think?
I had it out on the doorstep
playing with it, and talking to
it, when along tiie street came
a runaway horse. I jumped into the
house pretty quickly and it was lucky
that I did, for the horse ran close to
the house, so close that he stepped upon
my poor dolly and broke in her head.
Well. Sarah and Iâ my real name is
Mary Jane â cried, for we both loved
that dolly, whose name was Beautiful.
But Sarah's papa came and told us to
cheer up. for he would buy each of us
a new doll. So we put on our best
dresses and went to the store, and
there we saw such nice dolls. I picked
out one and Sarah had one, and we
took them home to be dressed. We do
not play with our dolls on the street
any more.
ROBBIE DALE
AT THE FAIR
BY JANIE REBECCA WARD.
ONE bright morning Robbie Dale
eat quietly on the doorstep. He
was planning how to help hfs
mother, who was poor and needed
money very much. Baby Ruth
had been sick and there were many bills
to pay. '.'Oh, dear, I wish I could do
something!" sighed Robbie. He sat
thinking a while longer. Suddenly a
bright idea came to him. "I'll ask
mother!" he exclaimed. His mother
was ironing in the kitchen. She looked
greatly surprised when Robbie told her
what he had been thinking about.
His plan was to have a small stand
at the fair, which was to be opened the
next week. He thought he could sell
lemonade and candy. Perhaps, too,
sister Alice would make some cf her
nice doughnuts and sandwiches for
him. After a while Robbie obtained his
mothers consent to try his plan. He
easily obtained permission to have a
stand on the fair grounds. Everybody
in the village who knew Robbie liked
him very much. The fair whs to last
only one day. Robbie could hardly wait
for the time.
But the day came at lastâ a bright,
sunshiny morning. Robbie *vas at the
fair grounds at an early hour. He care
fully arranged his standâ doughnuts
and sandwiches Â«n one side and candy,
glasses and lemonade on the' other.
Robbie prided himself on his lemonade.
It must have been good, for his little
stand was soon quite surrounded. It
kept him very busy. Among the group
around Robbie's stand was old Jacob
Green, who kept the village store. He
had known Robbie's father and was a
great friend of the family. He saw how
busy the little fellow was and he de
cide<L to help him.
RoWbie was glad of his assistance.
Before night everything was sold. Rob
bie counted his money, finding he had
made nearly $10. With a joyful heart
he hurried home to his mother.
"Will this help you, mother?" he
cried, passing her the money.
"Yes; very much," answered his
mother; "but It helps me a great deal
more to know that I have such a gootl,
thoughtful little son."
She clasped the boy to her breast,
kissing him tenderly. And Robbie wa3
quite contented. Many times after that
he found ways of helping his mother.
LITTLE NANCY.
ONE day little Nancy Wilcox*s
mother went out and told Nancy
to take care of the children and
not to go out. As Nancy said yes,
her mother knew she would keep
her proniise, for Nancy was very hon
est. Nancy's little friend, Daisy Mait
land, came to see Nancy and help
amuse the children. Before the children
knew it Mrs. Wilcox had come home
and they could go out and play by
themselves. Nancy was very glad that
she had not made any fuss about amus
ing the children, for the time had flown
so quickly.
After Daisy had gone home Nancy
went in the house and was Just going
up to her own room when she heard
her mother calling her and she went to
see what she wanted. Her mother gave
her a book that she had been wanting
for a long time, telling her she had
been a very good girl.

chance to rail. Undoubtedly there are
people supporting the Republican
ticket who are not blossoms of inno
cence. But the great mass who op
pose Phelan represent the best elements
of citizenship. There does not appear
any good reason why Phelan should
be regarded as supreme. He is of com
mon clay. My chief grievance against
him is not that he should have consti
tuted himself a boss, not that he should
have hefted the city's money, not that
he is an aristocrat with nothing on
which to base his pride. It is tnat he
should have selected A. M. Lawrence
as his chief advisor, and that the Ex
aminer, one of the foulest sheets ever
permitted to be published, should be
his especial organ. Ido not say this
of the Examiner because of any per
sonal feeling, but because it seems to
me, as a working newspaper man, a
shame that there should be a paper so
devoid of honor. It is one of the few
which would rather publish a lie than
the truth. A knowledge of Its charac
ter must tend to give to the public an
impression that newspaper men are
liars and blackguards, which they are
not. This is obviously unfair to writ
ers whom abiltty or ill luck has drawn
into daily journalism. There are many
men on the Examiner whom, personal
ly, I esteem. They are my friends,
and I am glad of their friendship. But
an institution overshadowed by Law
rence must submit to the suspicion of
being rotten. It is a strange circurrv
stance that men of brains sink their
personalities and bend their mental
powers to carrying out the will of a
Hearst, transmitted through such a
creature. But Phelan, hoping for of
fice, eager for undeserved honors, is
willing to pour his confidences into the
ear of Lawrence and abide by the de
cision. This fact alone, without the
record of Phelan's Boards of Supervis
ors and Education, his committee of
one hundred, his Wldber, would destroy
my faith in him. He does not deserve
re-election, and I do not believe he will
receive it.

mountain stream, pure as the crystal
waters, and for all the honor she has
won at home might as well have in
scribed her inspired thoughts on an au
tumn leaf and thrown it to the breeze.
But she has been taken up abroad. Her
genius, for it is nothing less, has been
recognized in London, a recent number
of The Outlook devoting to her and
her work more than a page. The kind
ly English critic quotes from her free
ly to show that she loves the fair land
where is her home, and yet he ex
presses surprise that she is either un
known or unappreciated in her native
country. The fact that she belongs to
California seems to weigh against her,
although what this prejudice really ac
complishes is to show that the people
of the United States are in sentiment
narrow, and in their store of literary
information but meagrely equipped. I
think the blame for this can be partly
fixed. That pestiferous Atherton wo
man, with no more soul than a turnip,
devoid of heart, falsely cynical, brazen
iy blase, us enough to prejudice a conti
nent against any source from which
she may emanate. She is a Califor
nian, and all others must come under
the ban she creates. Miss Coolbrith's
verse is pure and sweet. I refrain from
quoting much of it, because it is too
good to be shown in fragments, yet
here is one gem selected of many, and
in itself incomplete:
When the grass shall cover me,
Head to fout where I am lying.
When not any wind that blows,
Summer blooms nor winter snows
Shall awake me to your sighing,
Close above me as you pass
You will say: How kind she was,
You will say: How true she was,
When the grass grows over me.
Miss Coolbrith, so far as has been
my privilege to observe, does not at
tempt heroics. She is content with
melody and lilt, with sentiment, ten
derness, an appeal to the emotions.
Could anything be more beautiful than
this?
And the love my heart would speak
1 will fold in the lily's rim
That the lips of the blossoms, more
pure and meek,
May offer it up to him.
California has a right to be proud of
Ina Coolbrith. It is too busy now.
Some time it will awaken from its
dreams of gold and gain and conquest
to understand that here was one who
had been touched with the sacred fire.
It does not realize this yet. It is too
practical, too busy in the counting of
useful dollars. Besides all this, there
is a peculiar spirit manifest here, and
assuming the outward form of jeal
ousy. Let a Californian be successful
and the shafts designed to wound will
be hurled by those who had been his
fallow citizens. Bierce and Morrow

California for the work they did here,
but such weaknesses as they had are
enlarged upon. The same pernicious
rule prevails in politics. A Californian
no sooner achieves eminence than he
becomes a target. From this spirit
Miss Coolbrith will not escape. Her
hope is in recognition afar, and this is
being realized. For one, I am glad to
know that her worth is being noted
and hope for her a measure of success
so full that those failing to contribute
to it may learn ultimately that they
were in error, and be ashamed.

horse must be sacrificed in the endeavor

is the possibility that the horse is of
more value than the man. I do not

According to the News of San Pedro,
a certain Justice of the Peace was re
cently drunk while on the bench.
Rightly enough, the News regards such
conduct as reprehensible. A spectacu
lar inebriate perched uncertainly on the
woolsack tends to bring into discredit
the administrative mechanism of the
law. It seems, however, that the
worst offending of tht? official was not
in getting loaded, but in denying it un
der oath. I leave to the indignant
editor the task of setting forth the
heinousness of the crime, deeming his
words more fitting than any others now
at hand. The following is merely an
excerpt, but it is fuller of character
than the Justice was of brew: â¢ â¢ â¢

Part of good citizenship is manifest
in abiding by the law. Yet, as the
people enact the laws, there are times
when they seem in duty bound to sus
pend them. There is no probability
that San Francisco will ever be the
scene of another lynching. In theory
such an episode would be without ex
cuse, and would constitute a lasting
disgrace. Perhaps this is true. How
ever, my personal wish would be to see
the next murderer who adds to the lung
record of crime here swing from a
lamp post without having thirty sec
onds in which to insult divine mercy
with a prayer. There seems to be a
belief that a girl in refusing to marry
some low-browed scoundrel thereby
commits a capital offense, and that the
scoundrel becomes the executioner. I
do not hesitate to say this belief is
tinged of error. Neither can the man
who kills his wife, leaving his children
motherless and unprotected, be put to
better use than as a terrible example.
It seems too bad to waste the time of
the courts in establishing the guilt of
men concerning whose guilt there Is
no doubt. Within the last few days
two women have been slain under the
circumstances outlined. In neither in
stance was there a shadow of mitiga
tion, and the bloody handed wretches
are not fit to live. There were several
j attempts of a similar nature. Men so
degraded as to butcher women are be
yond possible reform. The law can do
nothing for them but kill them and get
I them out of the way. But the law is
j so deliberate, so tender of the assassin,
so full of quips and delay, that it tries
the patience more severely than It does
the prisoner at the bar.
With the promptness expected after
the death of a millionaire, the battle
for the fortune left by Adolph Sutro
has begun. If Mrs. Kluge is entitled
to anything I hope she may get it.
This does not discourage a belief that
the average "widow" bobbing up rrom
obscurity to weep at the tomb or the
deceased, wiping her eye with one
hand and reaching for his gold with
the other, is a most annoying type of
fraud. Either she has no claim grow
ing out of former association, or if
such association ever existed, it left her
a good way ahead of the game. The
Craven reach toward the Fair estate
is fresh in the public memory. Per
haps Mrs. Craven is an angel of light.
It may be that she would shudder at
the thought of putting up a Job and
faint in the presence of a forged docu

none of my concern it strikes me as
