SAMPSON CORKED THE
BOTTLE HOLDING CERVERA
CLOSED SANTIAGO
HARBOR WITH
THE MERRIMAC
Eight of the American Collier's Men
Reported to Be Prisoners of the
Spaniards.
Copyright, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
PORTO PLATA, San Domingo, June 3.-Cable mes
sages received here from Santiago deCuba state that the
Merrimac was sunk while trying to enter the harbor
An officer and seven men were taken prisoners.
How many were lost is not known.
After a sharp and effective cannonade which lasted
from three to four hours an American auxiliary cruiser,
which is said to have been the Merrimac, tried to force
an entrance to the harbor. The Spaniards allowed her
to pass the first line of torpedoes, but when she reached
the second line a torpedo was discharged at her. It took
effect and the ship sank almost immediately. One offi
cer, one engineer and six sailors were taken prisoners.
It is not yet known how many sank with the ship.
Only the extremities of the funnels and the tips of the
masts of the vessels are now visible.
A second dispatch from Santiago states that it is be
lieved the Merrimac was sent into the neck of the harbor by
Sampson for the purpose of closing the port, and thus pre
vent the escape of the Spanish squadron. From informa
tion conveyed by the prisoners it is believed they volun
teered for this dangerous work, and that none perished.
They were prepared for the explosion when it occurred.
CAPE HAYTIEX, June 3. â The American fleet, according to advices received by cable
from Santiago de Cuba, the cable being under Spanish control, opened fire again at 3 o'clock this
(Friday) morning on the fortifications and warships. The cannonade was well sustained until 4
o'clock a. m. ; . . : ["â 
One of the United States auxiliary cruisers, "well armed," attempted to force the passage
into the harbor. The Spanish allowed the cruiser to cross the first line of torpedoes, but before
she arrived at the second line they discharged a torpedo at her, which broke a great hole in her
side and caused her to sink almost instantly, bow first.
3ne -officer, one engineer and six sailors were made prisoners by the Spaniards.
The vessel sunk is understood to be the Merrimac. Only the extremities of her funnel and
two masts are visible above the water.
The Santiago advices in reference to the sunken vessel being an auxiliary cruiser are prob
ably mistaken. The Merrimac is a collier and has always been a collier.
INCE, June 3. â This morning at 3 o'clock the American squadron began
the bombardment of the fortifications of Santiago de Cuba, and a lively cannonade ensued for two
hours, which silenced the Spanish batteries.
An American vessel, the Merrimac, described in the advices from Santiago de Cuba as an
auxiliary cruiser, making a dash to force the entrance, succeeded in passing the first line of defenses,
but was torpedoed about 500 feet up the channel. She went down perpendicularly. An offi
cer, an engineer and six seamen were taken prisoners. The number of victims "is unknown.
Only the funnel and mastheads of the sunken vessel can be seen.
There is great excitement in the city. A part of the population assisted in the fighting on
the heights, Everybody is astounded at the audacity of the American vessel.
The American squadron was cruising all the while in the offing.

Herald's cablegram from Porto
Plata is correct and that Admiral
Sampson has taken the most
effective means to prevent the
Spanish fleet from giving him the
slip by running out under cover
of a dark and rainy night before
the land forces can reach Santiago
and co-operate with him in the

mac into the narrow entrance of
the harbor and opened her sea
valves, allowing her to sink.
Just inside the entrance the
channel is so narrow that a
sunken vessel as large as the Mer
rimac would make it impossible
for Admiral Cervera's ships to
pass on either side of her.
It is hoped the report that one
of her officers and some of her
crew were captured by the Span
iards is incorrect, yet it is realized
it was a dangerous task they had
to perform, and though Admiral
Sampson took every precaution

possible to enable them to escape
they may have been unable to get
off the sinking vessel and get
safely past the Spanish batteries
at the entrance of the harbor in
a small boat to where they could
be picked up by one of the ves
sels of the American fleet.
The collier Merrimac was for
merly owned under the same
name by Jefferson Hagan of New
York. She was of 3362 tonnage,
carried 5000 tons of coal and was
commanded by Commander
James M. Miller. As it would re
quire comparatively few men to
take the vessel into the channel
and sink her it is believed to be
probable that she carried only a
small crew, and very few officers,
and that the officers and men
volunteered for the duty, some
possibly from other vessels of the
fleet. Commodore Miller was
doubtless in command of the
crew which took her to the spot
where she was to be sunk. She
carried a regular crew of fifty
three men.
The special danger of the task
probably lay in the fact that while
Commodore Schley practically
silenced the batteries at the en
trance to the harbor by the bom
bardment on Tuesday, there were
other batteries further up the
channel which could not be dis
posed of from outside the en
trance, and the guns there would
fire on the Merrimac as she went
in. It is probable the Admiral
ran some smaller vessels of the
fleet as close as possible to the
entrance to the channel, or some
of them may even have followed
the Merrimac in so as to engage
I the inner batteries, and the Mer
rimac may have towed in one
converted for the use of her offi
cers and crew in making their
escape.
It is possible the vessel was
sunk by running against one of
the mines which it is believed the
Spanish placed in the channel,
but it is not thought probable, as
the Herald cablegram does not
speak of any one being killed,
and had she been blown up by a
I mine it is probable some lives
would have been lost.
The Merrimac mounted on her
deck six guns. She is of steel,
| 330 feet long, with a beam of 44
feet and a depth of 29 feet. She
was built at Newcastle, England,
in 1894, when she was christened
the Solveig, flying the Norweg
ian flag.
While loading grain at New
port News, April 27, 1897, she
caught fire. She proceeded to
Erie Basin, Brooklyn, for repairs.
Her registry was changed to
American and she became the
property of T. Hogan & Sons,
who operated the Lone Star serv
ice. While in service she ran be
tween Boston, New York and
Galveston.
The officers of the Merrimac
were: . Commander James M.
Miller, commanding; Lieutenant
W. W. Gilmer, executive; Ensign
J. M. Luby, Ensign J. R. Y.
Blakely, Assistant Engineer R. J.
Crank.
Now that Admiral Sampson
has thoroughly blocked the en
trance to Santiago harbor and
penned Admiral Cervera and his
ships *inside, he can leave Com
modore Schley in front of San
tiago with a few ships and can
take the remainder of his fleet to
Porto Rico to operate with the
artillery expedition against that
island.

Sampson and Schley Considering
the Best Means of Entering in
Pursuit.
WITH THE FLEET, on Board the Herald-Call dis
patch boat, off Santiago, June 2â (via Port Antonio, Ja
maica, June 2>-)- â * n vifcw P* tne Spanish admiral's latest tac
tics, it is doubtful if there will be a naval battle soon in this
neighborhood. Since the brief engagement last Tuesday,
Cervera has withdrawn his ships further up the harbor,
where, they are, of course, out of sight of the blockading
squadron, owing to the. high hills that separate the oppos
ing fleets. Cervera is evidently anxious to keep his vessels
nn'r of hnrm's way. â  â  â¢ : â  â¢ .'.: : . . â â â â  "
Rear-Admiral Sampson joined Com
modore Sehley's forces early yesterday
mornlna with the New York, Oregon
and Mayflower. The Spaniards wel
comed the American reinforcements by
firing two puns, the shots falling harm
lessly at sea. Later the torpedo-boat .
Porter, the dispatch-boat Dolphin and
the .steamer Adria joined the fleets:.
The Adria is loaded with supplies and
fitted with appliances for grappling and
cutting cables. The Harvard also j
joined the fleet, bringing welcome sup- ;
plies of fresh meats and vegetables.
Commodore Schley went on board th.c
New York as soon as the flagship came
up, and ; was closeted with Admiral â <
Sampson- a long time. The result of j
their deliberations is not known, but
their reticent. manner led every one to.
believe they were somewhat hampered
by Washington in adopting measures
to force Cervera to fight. All the of
ficers and men are eager to battle, but.
all do not agree on the most advisable
plan of attack. . "

The mmea onc^ exploded the . way
would be clear except, for the opposi- .
â¢tidn of the Spanish vessels. This is
not regarded so formidable as to pre
clude a powerful fleet forcing an en
trance. Once Inside the complete, de
struction, of Admiral Cervera's fleet is
certain. Officers of the fleet are con
fident-there Would be a repetition of the
Manila victory,. which would entirely
break Spain's naval power..'.
: A.t first" it was expected that. Rear-
Admiral. Sampson's arrival would re
sult .in action, but the day wore on -
without any indication of attack. About
noon the New York,: followed by the â¢
Marblehead, steamed in shore five miles
west of Morro*Castle. '= Some. hours' be
fore the gunboat Vixen had disappeared
in that direction. . The New York went
within 1000 yards/ of â  the '.shore, and
Sampson made' a. close examination of '
the coast line with a vie- to finding a
suitable place to land .troops. \ , â¢
To take, the batteries pro jctln^ the2
harbor entrance isone. plan being con
sidered. Asteani launch put off from
the New York carefully explored every
inlet to within two miles of Morro Cas
tle. The Vixen ran into several small
creeks In search, of ihe Spanish gun
boats and several hours were spent in
this examination. . '
When Sampson returned he had a
conference with captains on board the
New York. Darkness brought a heavy
rain squall, which made the work of
preventing the escape" of the Spanish
. fleet doubly difficult. Thick curtain
clouds cam*. from behind the high
mountains that wall, in Santiago and
spread canopy-like over the sea. Soon
a veil of rain obscured the shore and
obliterated Morro Castle. As the
gloom gathered. Commodore Schley
took the New . Orleans, lowa, Texas,
Massachusetts, Mayflower and Vixen
and formed an innor guard line about
three miles off the harbor, while Samp
son, with the remainder of the fleet,
took a position three miles further out,
with the Oregon extremely eastward,
close in, to prevent the vessels from
slipping along shore unobserved. News
paper boats were warned to : keep at
least five miles outside the fleet, the
penalty boing fired at without warn
ing. Then the rain came and wrapped
the entire landscape in gloom, and the
searchlights on the warships could not
penetrate fifty yards.
Cervera could not have chosen, a more
favorable hour to slip through the
blockade, but apparently he had not an
irJ^- of making the attempt. Three
hours later the squall passed away, the
moon shed a white radiance over the
.land and sea, to be succeeded by an
hour's darkness just before dawn, after
Luna retired. So passed the night.
When day came the Texas was lying
within two miles in shore. The twelve
inch gun battery just east of Morro
Castle fired at her, but missed by one
hundred yards. The battleship did not
. reply, but slowly and disdainfully
ptoamed outside of range. Shortly after
dawn, a small steamship approached
from the west to within five miles of
the fleet, and then started away full
speed. When the vessel was fully ten
miles away, the New York started in
pursuit, followed by the Porter. The
trio were soon lost to view, and at noon
the New York had not returned.
During the forenoon the Adria
dragged for cables within four miles of
the batteries, but was not successful in
locating them. Sampson intends to cut
Cervera off from communication with
Madrid as soon as possible.
There must be great apprehension In
Santiago as the Spaniards witness the
gradaal strengthening of the American
fleet, for they can expect nothing 1-ss
than bombardment. If Cervera, had any
intention of venturing out to give bat
tle Sampson's arrival with reinforce
ments must have caused him to aban
don it.
The appearance of Sampson on the
scene was not relished by officers of
Sohley's squadron, who think it bad
taste on the admiral's part to interfere
at this juncture. Some think it would
be graceful for Sampson to return to
the front of Havana, leaving: Schley to
deal with the situation. Unless decisive
action is taken to reduce the batteries
this blockade will probably continue
until the end of the war, which will be
more arduous the officers say than a
protracted engagement.

at a Banquet in
London.
Eoglish Statesmen Profuse in Ex
pressions of Regard for This
Country.
LONDON, June 3.â One of the most
; enthusiastic banquets ever given in
London was the Anglo-American ban
! quet this evening at the Hotel Cecil.
; Six hundred Britons and Americans as
sembled fraternally, the purpose of the
: entertainment being the promotion of
< good fellowship between kindred races.
Englishmen were the hosts, while resi
j dent Americans were the guests. Politi-
I cal, business and literary circles were
well represented, but the purpose of
making the affair spontaneous and a
I wholly unofficial celebration excluded
i the embassy. American and British
flags were draped over the tables.
Among the banqueters were the Earl
lof Carlisle, Viscount Powercourt, Sir
I Norman Leroy, Sir Frederick Pollock,
i Sir Richard Temple, Lord Beresford,
! the Dean of Hereford, the Rev. New
man Hall, Hiram Maxim and George
1 W. Ward, manager of the Commercial
Cable Company.
Literature and journalism were rep
> resented by Sir John Robinson, man
ager qf the Daily News; Mr. Alfred
Harmsworth, proprietor of the Daily
Mail and Evening News; M. Edmund
. Stead, editor of the Review of Reviews;
, Sir "Yv alter Besant, Mr. Anthony Hope,
Dr. Conan Doyle and Miss Beatrice
Harraden. .
Lord Bernard Coleridge presided. In
proposing the health of President Mc-
Kinley, he said:
"Where can the whole world show
such a line of rulers of men as have
been the free choice of the American
people?" â¢ .
The speakers were the Bishop of Ri
pon (the Right Rev. William Bernard
Carpenter) Lord Brassey, Colonel Tay
lor, president of the American Society
in London; Sir George William Dcs
Vereoux, Mr. Newton Crane, Earl Grey,
Professor Albert Yon Dycey, Mr.
George W. Cable and Sir Frederick
Pollock, professor of jurisprudence at
Oxford.
The English speakers lauded the
achievements of the revolution as en
thusiastically as if they had been their
own victories.
The Bishop of Ripon elicited the
greatest enthusiasm by a pointed ref
erence to the war, Baying that although
both nations had been accused of wor
shiping the dollar, we both know when
to spend our money and we know that
some cases were worth spending any
price for.
Lord Coleridge prayed that victory
might perch on the American banner.
"in the interests of America, in the
interest of Spain and in the interest of
common humanity. Twice America has
fought with all her might," he said.
"The first fight was forced by the im
becility of the King, and she was right
[cheering]; the second time she fought
for the freedom of slaves, and the same
spirit is with her yet." [Tremendous
cheering.]
â  He advocated a permanent tribunal
for the settlement of international dif
fero-nces.
Lord Brassey said that there were
closer ties than a written allianceâ ties
which could not be broken.
Colonel Taylor raised a hurricane of
cheering by saying: "As you have
stood by. us in our day of trial, when
your day of trial comes count upon
us."
Sir Frederick Pollock replied, pre
dicting that there would be M one fleet
under two flags to keep the peace of
the world.*'
The morning papers, commenting up
on the Anglo-American banquet at the
Hotel Cecil last evening, all speak in
the same tone of gratification. The
Daily Telegraph says:
"Nothing said by the speakers could
offend the susceptibilities of Continen
tal . nations, but there was evidence
throughout of the friendship which has
grown so ranidly and that it will not
end in mere verbal protestations of mu
tual respect and affection. It would be
a mistake to fo^o an. alliance before

the time is ripe, but there is an infinity
of good in cultivating these sentiments
of kinship, which are the forerunners
of formal alliances."
The Daily Chronicle, referring to the
banquet as a "remarkable gathering
of men who are forces in the modern
world," says: "The dinner was the be
ginning of a movement which, unless
unwise words or unforeseen mischance
should wreck it, must carry us far. It
is important that all men, friends or
foes, should realize that this move
ment has come to stay."
The Standard says: "It would be
premature to speak of an alliance, in
the sense in which Continental chan
cellors employ the term, but it would
hv an error not less grave to deprecate
the benefits which must accrue to the
United States and Great Britain from
the knowledge that they can look to
each other for sympathy and co-opera
tion."
The Morning Post says: "The ban
quet has made a permanent addition
to the reciprocal friendship which has
been derived from recent events in vari
ous parts of the world, and while
agreements in smaller points, such as
the Canadian and American differences,
are most valuable, on the large issues
treaties are not necessary. The iden
tity of interests of the United States
and Great Britain if as close as the
community of their traditions, and their
destiny is splendid, because it is one."

Captain Carter paid to-night: "I

more. Men are enlisting from every
part of the State, and I will have no
trouble in getting the required num
ber. It is men I want. I care nothing
for locality. . They must be men phy

ORIGIN OF A YELLOW
JOURNAL FAKE.
Sensational Yarn Concerning Ger-
mans at Manila First Printed
at Shanghai.
Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
HONGKONG. June 3.â The Shanghai
Mercury, whose reporter said he rep
resents the London Central News,
prints the following dispatch from
Manila:
"The Germans are slobbering over the
Spanish here and pretend to sympa
thize with them, but what they really
want is possession of the Carolines.
The Spanish Car-tain-General informs
me that a German ship desired to land
provisions for the Spaniards, but Ad
miral Dewey flatly refused. The Ger-
man Consul threatened to force a pas
sage with two German cruisers."
This is evidently the origin of the yel
low Journal's sensational story which I
contradicted recently, and which I
still believe to be untrue.

MOBILE, Ala, Juno 3.â The forward
movement from Mobile began this
afternoon. The first part of the Fourth
Army Corps to leave camp was the
Second Cavalry, and this was quickly
followed by the Third Infantry and the
Twentieth Infantry. These troops
marched to and through the city to the
water front, whore the afternoon and
part of the night were consumed in

Copyrighted. ISSS, by James- . Gordon Bennett. \
KINGSTON, Jamaica, June 3.â The
Government here is much exercised
over a point that has arisen in connec
tion with the observances of neutrality.
It has stated that press dispatch boats
touching at various ports, of the island
have been carrying not only press mes
sages, but also official communications
passing between the American govern
ment and the commanders of the fleets
in Cuban waters.
It is contended in some quarters that
in many cases where they carry Gov
ernment dispatches the pcess dispatch
boats should be regarded a? belllgei'
ent vessels, should In- permitted to take
on only coal enough to last them to
their nearest port in their own country,
and should not be -allowed to enter the
same port twioe- within three months.
The Attorney General declines to give
an opinion on the new point in inter
national law herein involved, and a de
cision by the imperial authorities has
been asked for by. cable. Whatever
the answer from the home Government
the dispatch boats will he. regarded as
private vessels except in ?peciiic cases
where it is proved they are carrying
official dispatches.
THREE SUPPOSED CATTLE
THIEVESJJNDER ARREST.
Accused of Having Killed Stock on
Banches in Western San Mateo
. . County.
REDWOOD CITY, June 3.â A number
of years ago a gang of cattle thieves was
the terror of the coast side in. this county.
It was eventually broken up and punished.
Until within the iast six weeks or two
months, the . county has been compara
tively free from this class of outlaws.
About two months ago Daly & Tiltpn re
ported to the Sheriff that they had lost
one. of their cattle from the Brlttan
ranch,- In West Union. Two weeks later
they reported another one killed. The
first was out up. and carried off. The
second was shot, but not immediately
killed, and succeeded in reaching the road,
where it died. . .
Sheriff Mansfield then commenced an i
Investigation, as a resuJt of which he sns
pecte'd three men, whom he now has un
der arrest. He was informed yesterday
that a steer- belonging to . McClellan
Brothers of Laurel Creek, had been, killed i
and the meat. 'carried away. A man who I
lives in that neighborhood heard a shot;
near the road, and soon afterward met |
Henry Kriess with a gun. He supposed |
Kriess had shot at a rabbit.. On. going i
further up the road he. heard a struggle
in the bushes and found the dying, steer.
Later Kriess and two other raefi named
Trovelyn and Judd came brick and took
the animal away. The tracks of. their ,
wagon ltd 'directly to the Kreiss place, i
and there the meat was found. packed in a !
barrel. The trio was arrested.

â  . â 
VESSELS THAT NEEI> GREATER

The President of the Union Iron
Works Says the New Monitors
Should Have a Greater
Displacement.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 3.â The Herald'a
Washington correspondent says: "The
Sun Francisco, of course I take pride
in the San Francisco," said her builder,
Irving M. Scott, to me to-day, at the
BAOfeham.
"And the Oregonâ she's different?"
"The Oregon? The Oregon is a bat
tleship, and she is boss of the earth."
Mr. Scott is presiuent of the Union
Iron Works at San Francisco and the
builder of the Oregon. He was enthu
siastic over the battleship's phenomenal
performance in the unbroken run from
San Francisco to Florida. Mr Scott
is now en route to St. Petersburg,
where he will hold important confer
ences touching the building for the
Russian Goveriinu-nt of ships similar
to the Oregon. Leaving Washln
Sunday afternoon he will sail from New
York Tuesday.
"In the design of -the Oregon." con
tinued Mr. Scott, "may be found one
ration of her remarkable run. Ii;
the bklll ana ability of the: engineering
department of the ship, the bravery
and pluck ct Captain Clark, who h:.s
conf-ldei.ee in his engines, the engineers
and men and. in the confidence of the
men in him may be found all other x
planations needed."/ '-; ..-;.;â , :.:â¢ "â¢â¢:.
"What Is the naval lesson of tho
Oregon and her run?"
"It means that the navy to have a
great fighting capacity must have a
great coal capacity. Why, for example,
look at the Monterey. She Is as per
fect a fighting machine as can be built
for money, but she curries only 900
tun? of coal, whereas her displacement
should be increased SO fliÂ» could carry
800 tons. Her turrets, too, should be
the same size. Then she would be a
match for a battleship. Now that she
is to be towed from Mare Island to
Manila care should be taken to keep
her full of coal so that in cape the haw
ser should be slipped she can stand out
and fight herself out of trouble."
Mr. Scott was frank to disapprove
of the plan of the Government in or
dering four single-turret monitors of
only 2500 tons displacement each and of
only small coal-carrying capacity,
while even the Monterey has 4000 tons
displacement.

TO BATTER
SANTIAGO
Formidable Guns for
the Heights Above
the City.
The Defenses of Manila
Are Also Receiving
Careful Attention.
Call Office, Riggs House, Washington, June 3.
The Call correspondent to-night is able to present im
portant additional: details with regard to the expedition
against Santiago, which was described in these dispatches
last night. The military force will constitute a well-balanced
organization specially selected for sharp and effective work,
both in an assault upon a fortified town and an attack upon
vessels within a range of four miles.
The most formidable feature of the artillery equipment
will l>e sixteen siege guns manned by double crews, and
sixty field pieces served by the best experts in the artillery
arm of the military service.
These powerful guns will be rupport
. 1 hy ten batteries of light artillery
and four of heavy artillery, the former
manned by 760 experienced artillery
men, thus giving twelve- men to each
gun. whi< h is ample provision for any
contingency that may: arise:
A large amount of ammunition has
been specially prepared for the batte
ries and siege guns, and the transports
v. ill carry wagon trains for the con
veyance of reserve supplies. . The work
of landing, transporting and mounting
tho artillery will be in the hands of an
enpineer battalion, which will have at
its command a modern Pontoon outfit
to be used both in transporting guns
and ammunition to the shore, .and for
tht> bridging "f such streams as may be
encountered vt v>v.n the landing place
the heights back of Santiago.
The lai si infoi^nation obtainable-in
dicates that thfi expedition will be land
..,j Considerably^ -nearjer Santiago than
w;:p at first planned.:: It was originally
: to make a ! landing in the
of Guantanarno Bay,
thirty miles east of Santiago, for
th>= reason' that good roads were said to
lead from this point through the In
terior to the hills behind the city:
It is understood that the department
has decided that the engineer corps Is
to construct a serviceable road
from any point on the. beach to the
hills in the rear of Santiago, and that
since, in any event, a road would have
to be built from the main highways to
points of vantage for the location of
rips, the route of the expedition
may be materially shortened without
greatly increasing the difficulties to be
encountered.
â¢ uving to the strict censorship now
in force at all Gulf ports It cannot be
definitely stated whether the advance
guard of the Santiago expedition has
left for Cuba or not, but it Is known
that thp artillery, the â  pontoon outfit
and General Roy Stone's road mak
ins machinery Were embarked on six
transports at least forty-eight hours
ago. . â¢
Twenty-five hundred Infantry will
accompany the expedition, and . their
embarkation will probably immediate
ly precede the departure of the artillery
transports for the Windward Passage,
which it is now understood will be the
route followed In reaching Santiago.
It Is not likely that any news will be
received from the Santiago expedition
within the next seven days. Assum
ing that the transports leave immed
iately it would require four days : to
reach the landing place, and at least
two days to disembark the artillery
and for the troops to scale the hills and
establish the batteries. Even should
an immediate and decisive engagement
take place it will be seen news can
hardly reach Washington before the
end of next week. ;
The Navy Department to-day ire*--'
cHved the first official information re
garding the operations against the bat
teries of Santiago. Commodore Schley's
terse report of that affair closes with
the statement that he is quite satis
fied the Spanish fleet Is in Santiago.
In view of Schley's report and the in
structions forwarded to Admiral Samp
son, who is now In command of the
vnpsHs before Santiago, it is expected
that preparations will be made for a
naval attack coincidently with the as
sault by the American land batteries.
<''>nfirmation is given by the depart
ment to the report that preparatory to
this work the Vesuvius will be sent in
to explode the triple line of. mines in
the mouth of the harbor with charges
of dynamite fired from her fifteen.pneu
matir guns. Charges of gun cotton
weighing f.iK) pounds, capable of ex
ploding a wklp area of mines, can be
fired from this unique vessel at a dis
tance of two mil^s, and it is assumed
that in "xe^uting this maneuver the
heaviest rifles in the fleet will be em
ployed to protect the Vesuvius from the
fir^ of the land batteries.
For the first time since the war be
gan the administration is endeavoring
to prepare and observe a schedule of
future operations. In this programme
the capture of Santiago and the de
struction of Cervera's fleet are sched
uled for accomplishment prior to June
is/Contemporaneously, or immediately
afterward, San Juan, Porto Rico, will
be bombarded and invested with a land
force sufficient to hold it against any
Spanish fleet that may cross the At
lantic to retake it. t
These operations, together with the
reinforcement of Dewey in the Philip
pines, the administration believes, are
likely to bring Spain to her senses with
out the necessity of bombarding the
should not be realized. General Miles'
original plan of landing 100,000 troops
west of Havana will be rapidly develop
ed and Spain's last stronghold in the
western hemisphere speedily destroyed.
A Paris cable announcing positively
that Cervera's fleet had proceeded to
the Philippines from Cape Verde in
stead of to the West Indies, and that
Admiral Villamll's squadron is the one
bottled up in Santiago harbor, was rkli
culed at the Navy Department even be
fore Schley's official report came to
day.
The administration has no fear that
Spain will make an effort to regain the
Philippines, as the attempt would be
hopeless. In addition to the Monterey
and Monadnock, the gunboat Benning
ton, now at Honolulu, will be sent to
Manila.' Orders to that effect were to
day sent to Admiral Miller, command
ing the Pacific station. It is said that
the Bennington will convoy the third
Philippine expedition. With the arrival
of these vessels. Admiral Dewey will
have one of the most formidable fleets
afloat. If will consist of twelve ves
selsâthe Olympia, Monterey, Monad
nock, Boston, Baltimore, Raleigh,
Charleston, Concord, Petrel, Benning
ton, McCulloch and the transport Za
firn.
These vessels will, together, mount 192
guns. There will be In the fleet two
twelve-inch, four ten-inch, twelve
eight-inch, twenty-two five-inch rapid
fire guns, a large number of six and
four inch, one, two and three pounders,
and fourteen terrible Gatling guns.
But even with this powerful squad
ron, other measures will be taken to
render the harbor of Manila absolutely
Impregnable against assault. A large
number of mines each containing fifty
pounds of guncotton are being con
veyed to Manila on the City of Peking.
This is a fact vouched for by a prom
inent War Department official. These
mines are of the kind sent to the North
Atlantic squadron at the request of
Rear Admiral Sampson. One hundred
and fifty thousand dollars will also be
expended for. torpedoes for Manila har
bor.. These elaborate preparations for
the defense of the Philippines would
seem to indicate that this Government
is preparing to occupy the island for a
considerable length of time, if not per-
. manently. â 
Assistant Secretary Meiklejohn said
to. a Call, correspondent to-night that
no definite time had been fixed for the
departure ; of the Colon, China, Zealan
dia. Centennial and Ohio, comprising
the second Manila expedition, with 5000
troops aboard, but he believed it would
sail oh Monday or Tuesday; at any
rate, not iater than the middle of next
week. â  - . . â¢

MADRID, June B.â ln the Chamber
of Deputies to-day Lieutenant General
Correa, Minister of War, in reply to
an .inquiry as to whether a Spanish ex
pedition would be sent to the Philip

erating on the matter, and that troops
would be ready to depart the moment
they were required.
Senor Azcarrate, Republican, spoke
against the proposal that the House
should order a prosecution of Senor
Castelar, the distinguished Republican
statesman, for his article attacking the
Queen Regent. .He contended that the
Queen Regent was not inviolable, like
a monarch, and he recalled the con-,
duct of previous regents, which had
been criticized without causing scan
dal.
Senor Sagasta replied: "Parliamen
tary immunity is worthy of respect;
but the inviolability of the crown ousht
to be defended with the utmost ener

extend to acts outside the chambers of
Parliament and it is a pity that pre
cious time should be wasted in such
a discussion."
The House then decided to pass the
order of the day and a discussion of
the budget was resumed.
Senor Castelar, who is now at Ali
cante, has declared to an interviewer
that he will not come to Madrid to de

time that the article in question "does
not attack the Queen Regent, but the
courtiers; and this has been permitted

"Secretary of the Navy, "Wash
ington: Made reconnaissance
this afternoon, May 31. with the
Massachusetts, lowa and New
Orleans to develop fortifications
with theiT character. The fire
was returned without delay by
the heavy batteries to the east
and to the west, large caliber,
long ranges. The range was
7000 yards. Reconnaissance de
veloped the presence of the
Spanish squadron lying behind
the island near the upper fort,
as they fired over the hill at ran
dom. Quite satisfied the Span
ish fleet is here. SCHLEY."
NEW YORK, June 3.â The United
States auxiliary cruiser St. Pau?, Cap
tain Sigsbee commanding, came into
port early to-day. Captain Sigsbee
went ashore and thence proceeded to
the nnvy-yard. He refused to be in
terviewed regarding the recent service
of his ship in the vicinity of Santiago
de Cuba at which port, It has been
said, Captain Sigsbee ran tha St. Paul
well into the mouth of the harbor and
obtained ihe first definite information
of the presence there of Admiral Cer
vera's squadron. After visiting Com
modore Bunce at. the navy-yard, Cap
tain Sigsbee relaxed from his service
sufficiently to say to a reporter:
"I had target practice right along j
from the first day I arrived at Santi- i
ago, on May 22, and while none of my
men have been in the service long, I
am well satisfied with their work at
the guns. We have not been in any
fight so far, but my men will give a
good account of themselves. It was
on the 25th that we captured the Res
tormel. I knew that the Spaniards
needed coal very badly and I made
every effort to see that they did not
get it. While off Santiago with Schley
I saw two more Spanish cruisers, and
Sohley saw two torpedo-boats. There
is no question that they are bottled up
as tight as can be in Santiago harbor.
I went in so close that I made sketches
of their fortifications, which 1 am send
ing to Washington.
"Their guns could easily have
reached m<\ but the batteries made no
attempt to fire, for what reason I do j
not know. It may be the Spaniards
did not want to reveal the strength and
location of their guns. lam going to
Washington with dispatches from the
fleet, and as soon as we have coaled
and provisioned we shall put to sea
again. This probably will not be for
three or four days.
"As soon as I arrived outside the
harbor of Santiago there were indica
tions of the presence of Cervera's fleet
on the inside beyond the hills. I hugged
the mouth of the harbor so closely that
it would have been impossible for any
thing afloat to sneak out without our
seeing them. It was on the third or
fourth day after our arrival that I saw
two Spanish vessels, which I was sure
were the Vizcaya and the Cristobal
Colon. They crept cautiously into the
stream and got to the middle of the
channel. As soon as they caught sight
of me they scampered back as rapidly
as they could steam.
"As soon as we arrived off the harbor
I announced my presence by the cour
tesy of a salute, taking as a target one
rrf the Spanish forts. The fort evidently
did not intend to accord me the cour
tesy due in return, for its guns re
mained silent. When I was satisfied
with the practice my men had had, I
steamed the St. Paul out of range and
resumed scout duty outside the mouth
of the harbor.
"It was directly under the guns of a
fort and within easy range that I took
the Restormel, with 2400 tons of crral
aboard. This coal was evidently in
tended for the Spanish fiVet, and for
the Reatorrrrel to run our blockade and
enter Santiago harbor would of itself
have been good evidence that the Span
ish were there. We had to fire several
Bhotfl at her before she hove to. I put
a prize crew aboard and sent the col
lier to Key West.
"During the period I was at Santiago
Rchley came and went several times,
cruising a little to the westward, but
the St. Paul remained off Santiago har
bor for all of the eight days. It was on
May 29 that I saw heavy lines of smoke
from what I at first thought was the
Spanish squadr.on coming to the relief
rrf ( 'orvera. There was great excite
ment nn board the St. Paul, and I im
mediately put out after the fleet. I
soon found that the smoke was com
ing from Schley's ships returning to
the entrance of the harbor. On this
day both Schley and myself saw again
positive evidences that the Spanish
fleet was still bottled up in Santiago
harbor."
CARDINAL VAUGHAN
WRITES ON ALLIANCE.
Rejoices at the Prospect of Closer
Friendsnip Between English-
Speaking Haces.
NEW YORK, June 3.â A dispatch
from London says: Cardinal Yaughan,
in a letter to K. T. Stead, on Anglo-
American relations, rejoices at the
prospect of a closer friendship of those
who are one with Englishmen In blood,
language and ideas. The letter closes:
"Personally 1 deplore the fact that
the United States has chosen war with
a weak power like Spain instead of ar
bitration, which was the alternative.
But I would not allow such disapproval
to stand in the way of the great bene
fit that may result from an entente
cordiale between England and Amer
ica. If the two peoples combine and
encourage each other to make justice
and the moral law international and
universal, so far as their influence
shall extend, they will end by reinstat
ing In the world the standard which
the Christianized civilization of mod
ern Europe has laid low."

TROUBLES OF
THE TEMERARIO
Must Put to Sea or Be
Dismantled.
DEMAND MADE ON PARAGUAY
THAT GOVEBNMENT EXPECTED
TO OBEY THE DICTUM.
The Spanish Torpedo Gun Vessel Has
Outstayed Its Welcome in a
Neutral Port Under the
International Law.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
NEW YORK, June 3.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald sends
the following: Spain's torpedo gun ves
sel, the Temerario, will be dismantled,
her guns removed and be put in as in
effective condition as possible or else
leave the waters of Paraguay at once.
This is the dictum of the United States,
and Paraguay is expected to obey it to
the letter.
Instructions to this effect have been
cabled to Minister William R. Finch,
the representative of this Government
in Paraguay, and he will lay it at once
before the Paraguayan Government.
No doubt exists in the minds of the
officials that the commanding officers of
the Temerario will comply with the de
mand of this Government. Paraguay
requested him to proceed to sea, prom
ising to give him enough supplies to
take him to the nearest friendly port.
The Temerario's commander, however,
replied that the condition of his ves
sel was such that he could not put to
sea; she was unseaworthy, and before
he could proceed on a voyage he would
have to make considerable repairs.
This statement was laid before the
representative of this Government, who
forwarded it to Washington, and as a
result of a conference to-day between
Acting Secretary of the Navy Allen and
Secretary of State Day a demand that
the Temerario be immediately dis
mantled if Paraguay permitted the ves
sel to remain within her boundaries
was cabled to the American Minister.
EITHER MERRIAM
OR OTIS RESPONSIBLE.
It Seems the War Department Did
Not Move Troops From, the
Presidio to Richmond.
WASHINGTON, June 3.â Members of
the California delegation were to-day
in receipt of telegrams from the Cham
ber of Commerce of San Francisco, rep
resenting that the water supply, sew
erage, etc., at the Presidio were inad
equate, and that, inasmuch as other
cities and towns in California were
anxious to furnish camping grounds for
the troops, the Presidio should be put
in condition.
The Senators and Representatives
failed to see the advantage that might
accrue from this improvement, now
that most of the troops have been
transferred from the Presidio to Camp
Richmond. The Call correspondent in
quired at the War Department to-day
why this change was made and by
whose orders. Each one of the offi
cials seen affected entire ignorance of
the matter. Finally Assistant Secre
tary Meiklejohn said that orders for
the temporary occupation of certain
grounds for camping purposes are not
issued from the War Department, but
that such matters are left to the dis
cretion of the general in command. The
inference was, therefore, that either
General Otis or General Merriam had
given orders for the change. But
whether or not, it is certain that Sec
retary Alger is aware that San Fran
cisco people have criticized the removal
of the troops from the best and most
natural camp in the Presidio to the
Bay District track, for a California
Congressman interviewed him to-day.
INSURGENTS BEGIN
FORWARD MOVEMENT.
Spaniards Report That the Cubans
Were Defeated, But This May
Safely Be Doubted.
NEW YORK, June 3.â A dispatch
from London says: A Havana dis
patch says the insurgents have com
menced a forward movement against
the Spanish outposts. A force of 500
insurgents under Garcia attacked a hill
fort near Holguin, but the garrison,
composed of fifty volunteers, made a
determined resistance and mowed down
the Cubans at short range. Garcia
retired, leaving sixty-eight killed and
wounded, exclusive of many that were
carried off.
A dispatch from Key West says:
Blanco has withdrawn large bodies of
troops from the coast line to Cardenas,
Matanzas, Havana and Cienfuegos,
leaving only a light patrol at the va
cated points.

Assertions at Madrid That the Ad
miral Is Not at Santiago, but
Is on the Way to the
Philippines.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
GIBRALTAR, June 3.â lt is an
nounced here that the Spanish squad
ron has sailed, but the date of its sail
ing was not mentioned, nor was the
destination of the warships siren.
PARIS, June 3.â There is a persist
ent belief here and at Madrid that Ad
miral Cervera is not at Santiago de
Cuba. The correspondent of the Gau
lois at Madrid telegraphs from there,
saying he has learned from the high
est authority that Admiral Cervera has
never been in the harbor of Santiago
de Cuba and that the Spanish ships
there belong to Captain Villami's tor
pedo squadron.
It appears from the information gath
ered by the Gaulois correspondent that
Admiral Cervera, after leaving the
Cape Verde Islands, "maneuvered so
as to deceive the Americans and then
started at full speed for the Philip
pines, where the fleet is to arrive on
Saturday or Sunday. His orders are to
destroy Admiral Dewey's fleet and then
to intercept, capture or destroy the
American transports on their way to
the Philippine Islands from San Fran
cisco."
MADRID, June 3.â The Pais, a prom
inent republican organ, says it is ru
mored that the United States fleet has
made a second attack upon Santiago
de Cuba, and that the Americans
forced an entrance into the harbor. In
Spanish circles here the report is not
believed to be true. The Madrid
newspapers maintain that Admiral Cer
vera's fleet is sailing in the direction
of the Philippines.
REPORTED NEARING
WEST INDIAN WATERS.
Here Is a Story That the Ships From
Cadiz Are Going to Cervera'a
Relief.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, June 2 (de
layed in transmission).â The corre
spondent here of the Associated Press
has been informed from an apparently
authentic source at Port Antonio, this
island, that a Spanish fleet from Cadiz
is nearing West Indian waters, and
should be off Santiago de Cuba to-mor
row, in order to reinforce the fleet of
Admiral Cervera. The Spanish fleet
is said to consist of sixteen warships,
battle-ships and three torpedo-boats.
The British second-class cruiser In
defatigible, Captain George A. Prim
rose, has sailed for Santiago with sev
eral doctors on board, In order to watch
the impending battle and to aid the
wounded.
The information that the Cadiz
squadron has sailed comes from Eng
lish sources and seems trustworthy.
On the other hand, Senor de Castro,
the Spanish Consul, declares that he
does not think the Cadiz squadron has
sailed for the West Indies, as he be
lieves Admiral Cervera can defend him
self alone.
DO NOT BELIEVE THE
CADIZ FLEET HAS SAILED.
Navy Department Officials Refuse to
Be Frightened at What They
Declare to Be a Bugaboo.
"WASHINGTON, June 3.âNotwith
standing the rather positive state
ment coming from Jamaica to
the effect that the second Span
ish fleet from Cadiz has crossed
the Atlantic and is about to join Cer
vera to-day at Santiago, the officers of
the Navy Department refuse to be
frightened at what they declare to be a
bugaboo.
It appears that the basis of their
confidence is a telegraphic report of as
late date as yesterday declaring that
the Cadiz fleet is still at Cadiz. More
over, they know that there are not as
many as sixteen ships in that fleet.
RED CROSS WORK

NEW YORK, June 3. â Chairman
Stephen E. Barton, vice-president of

ban Relief Committee, said to-day it
was probable that some member of the
American National Red Cross will pro
ceed to California in the immediate fu
ture to assist and advise in the work
inaugurated there. Miss Barton, too.
he said, would doubtless make appli
cation for a commission from the Pres

THIRD PARTY
DISAPPEARING
Losing Its Identity in
California.
ONE RESULT OF FUSION
POPULIST VOTE DWINDLING
RAPIDLY.
Data of the Last Election Indicative
of the Early and Complete Ob
literation of This Political
Faction.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, June 3.â The Peo
ple's party is losing its identity in the
State of California. Secretary of State
Brown on May 28 sent a circular letter
to the various County Clerks through
out the State, in which he asked for
the following information:
"Will you kindly favor me by sending
to this office the total People's party
vote in your county at the election of
IÂ£9& 1 wish only the total and not the
detailed vote. The vote was added to
that of the Democratic party, and,
thinking - perhaps you had it segregated.
I have taken the Liberty to write, ir
there' is any way whereoy you can as
certain sniu vote without going to too
much trouble 1 would appreciate the
favor.
Replies have been received from
Mono, Inyo, San Mateo, Butte, San
Luis Obispo, Modoc, Fresno. San Fran
cisco. Monterey, Kings and Kern coun
ties The reply in each instance states
that by reason of the fusion with the
Democrats no record was obtained
Knowing the number of votes cast by
â¢he Populists. The Clerk of Kern
County writes:
The People's party did not have a ticket
in the flela, but Fused with the Democrats !
and generally voted that ticket, so tin ri-
Is i. "tiling to show 'What their strength
was. â  â¢
Ail the other replies are in substance
â  the same. . â  â¢
Were it not for the. fact that several
. Republican counties returned the Pop
ulist vote as segregated, the Populists
would at the coining, election be. withr
â¢ out the mt ana of showing the percent
age of their vote, and. hot being able
â¢to show 3 per cent of the -vote' cast,* they
could not be recognized.- as a political
organization, and the only way they
could secure a place on the State. ticket
would be by petition.
The counties which returned no seg
regation of the vote were Colusa, El
dorado, Fresno, . Glenn, Kern, Kings,.
. Lake, Madera. Modoc, San feenito, San
Francisco, Blakiyou, Stanislaus and
Tulare. All these ; being Democratic
counties it would seem that.it was the
design of tfhe Democracy to obliterate
all traces of the Populists as a party.
.. The present scheme to fuse under the
head of Democracy will, in all proba
bility, if carried out, result in the final
obliteration of the Populists as a
party. â â â ;:â¢â .
Secretary of , State Brown, in speak
ing of. the endeavor to. bring about a
fusion," said. to-day..:, .' -...".
"It is amusing to note' the eagerness
which the leaders, of the Democrats dis
play in their, endeavor, to bring about
â¢ fusion with the Pedple's Party. If the
Populists fuse, with the Democracy,
having in view the accomplishment of
â¢but one of its several principles (and
the two parties agree' on silver only,
with that question being national, and
not State), they are nothing more nor
less than an annex in disguise lo the
Democratic party. If, after the treat
ment accord- d the People's Party, by
its partner in fusion at the election in
1896, wherein a determined effort was
made by the State Democratic Com
mittee to wipe It out of existence, by
having its vote counted in with the
Democratic group only, and the action
of the national committee in ignoring
the People's Party candidate, Watson,
the party enters into a coalition with
the Democracy at this time, It u ill
be its ending.
"In- the election of 1892, the People's
Party vote was, approximately, 88,000.
In the State election of 1594, only two
years subsequent, it equaled nearly 52,
000. In lhDti, under fusion, for the first
time, the vote fell on the face of the
returns to 22,000. In the very nature of
things,, the larger and older party, if
fusion continues, will utterly engulf the
other. The smaller organization in fu
sion,, loses its individuality and char
acter, .being overwhelmed by the larger
of the two parties. If it is the desire
of the People's Party to live only for a
day, as it were, it could not do better
than to kwp up fusion. t
"In arranging the fusion, ballot, it
will be Impossible' to have the- names of
the two political parties opposite the
â  names of their candidates, because the
vo-tes cannot be segregated. The only
course fusionists can pursue is to al
ternate with the names of their respec
tive parties, and that can be brought
about'only by making alternative nom
inations in their conventions. TheSilver
Republicans, should they enter the
fusion scheme, will have to petition,
and if the name' 'Silver Republican' ap
pears opposite the name of either can
didate of. the other two parties, then it
kills the two organizations for the fu
ture, because it would be impossible to
segregate the vote of the two, and
thereby determine which received the 3
per -cent of all the votes cast." .
That the Populists, have suffered
greatly : from. their affiliation with the
Democrats is demonstrated by the fol- j
lowing facts:
In LsfÂ»4, without fusion, they cast 235 I
votes i-n Amador; in 1896, with fusion,
they cast 7. r > votes in Amador.
In 189'4, without fusion, they cast 557
votes in Tehama: in 1K96, with fusion,
they. cast 294 vo^ps in Tehama.
In 1894, without fusion, they cast 444
votes ln'Yolo; in 1596, with fusion, they
cast 95 votes in Yolo.
It> 1894, without fusion, they cast 945 i
votes in -Mjpndocino; in 1596, with fu
sion., they cast 352 votes in Mendoclno.

Former Employe Testifies Against
the Management of the
Home.
CARSON, June 3.â Tho investigation of
the charges against the management of
the Orphans' Home began to-day.
Charges were preferred against Mr. and
Mrs. .Beebe for alleged incompetency,
lack of discipline, cruelty and allowing
a grave scundal to continue for a year,
involving the assistant matron and an
inmate of the home.
Charles Day, a former employe, who

and blue, had compelled him to stand in
a tank of cold water an hour. He had
compelled Robert Heritage to cut ice un
til he dropped from exhaustion, and
awakened him at midnight and compelled
him to work until 6 o'clock in the evening'
with only a bite to eat. tie had told tne
boys to "lay the school teacher out" and
to "throw bar out of the window." The
teacher was a Miss Moore. It was also
alleged that a boy named Stan ton spent

The prosecution promises to present
evidence to-morrow to bear out the more
serious charges affecting the morality of
the Institution.

Horrible Sufferings of the Men Em- '
ployed on the Crows Nest Pass
Line.
VANCOUVER, June 3.â The report on i
the Crows Nest Pass Railway by Com- ''â 
missloners appointed by the Government !
to Investigate the grievances of the men
discloses a terrible condition of affairs on
the line. It first shows that 4300 men are i
employed, brought there by misrepre- i
mentation on the part of Agent M. J. j
Haney, manager of construction of the
Canadian Pacific- Railroad. It states that
the men are ill used in many ways, and
that those who left or were discharged
were refused food and had to walk nun
dreds of miles, Buuering from hunger and
exposure; In many camps the meu were
compelled to sleep in tents until January (
Without Stoves, and in some camps to in- ;
habit filthy places filled with vermin.
Many of the men who were examined
testified that they felt like prisoners in a
Btrange land. They were prohibited from
speaking while at work, and were treat
ed by some of the bosses like slaves and !
prisoners". At the rate 01 pay received
they would at the end of one year be out ,
of uocket and unable to return home.
The appointment of a Government offl
cer. with magisterial power to see that
the men are treated properly is recom- I
mended by the Commissioners.
ENDANGERED LIVES OF
FERRY PASSENGERS.
Collision Between the Steamers Sau
salito and Tiburon Barely-
Averted.
SAUSALITO. June 3.â The frl<>ndl>
practice of racing, in which the ferr>
boats Tiburon and Sausalito have been
engaging for some time, came near end
ing In a collision last evening under such
circumstances that the sinking of one or
both boats and loss of life must certainly
have resulted. Both boats start from the
terry slips at the foot of Market street
on their last trip to the Marin County
shore at 6:.^) p. in. Yesterday evening, as
usual, they entered upon a contest of
The Tiburon got a hundred feet
the start, but the Sausalito gradually
pulled up to her.
When opposite Angel Island Captain
White of the Tiburon veered slightly from
his former course, the new course taking
him obliquely across the Sausalito's bow.
A collision seemed certain and a panic
seized the passengers crowding both
boats, but Captain Wilson of the Sausa
lito reversed his engines in time to per
mit his adversary to cross by a narrow
marginâ about twenty or thirty feet.
Otherwise the Sausalito would have
struck the Tiburon amidship at full
speed.

Norris Pays the Penalty for
His Crimes.

ker, the train robber and murderer, was
hanged In the enclosure of the courthouse

an" effort would be made to prevent the
execution, but no demonstration took
place.
Parker spent a restless night In jail.
When everything was in readiness he
said:
"I have not much to say. I claim I am
getting something that ain't due me,
but I guess every one going- to be hanged
says the same thing."
The cap was then pulled over his head,
the noose adjusted and the murderer of
Lee Norris satisfied the demand of the
law. His neck was broken.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
DALLAS, Tex., June 3.â A special to
the News from Shreveport, La., says:
A thousand people gathered at Doy
line, on the Vicksburg, Shreveport and
Pacific Railroad, about eighteen miles
from here, to witness the burning at
the stake of William Street, a negro,
who outraged Mrs. Parish. The crime
was committed on the night of May 30.
The people erected a post near the
railroad track near the town and laid \
the light wood and kindling, saturated I
with coal oil, preparatory to chaining |
Street to the post. Street was a negro, !
about 28 years of age. He confessed
the crime to a colored minister, but said
a colored minister named John Rhodes j
was implicated. When going to the |
stake he looked frightened, but refused j
to say anything. He was tied to the
stake and uttered not a word as the
crackling flames^ shot up in succession
above his head.
The flames were started at 1 o'clock.
It was a sickening sight, which lasted
ten minutes. Then Street was a charred
mass.
Well-known lawyers made speeches,
warning the crowd of negroes that such j
crimes would not be tolerated in a j
civilized community.
The woman whom Street attacked is I
in a most critical condition and could j
not identify Street when he was caught
until a doctor held open her eyelids.

handed over to the mob that had gath
ered at the house. The negro was dragged
to a tree near the Iron Mountain Railway,
a few feet from where Ed Coy was burned

Natives Who Sympathize With Spain
SANTA BARBARA. June 2.â Numerous
native Callfornians here and at Montecito
are expressing Btrong sympathies with
Spain In the present war.
CUBAN HOSPITALS.
The Great Lack of the Insurgents Is
Surgical Care.
On account of the t- ctics employed by
the Cuban forces and the division made
in them, together with the fact that
small bands often operate alone, there j
is not a sufficient number of doctors to !
I properly attend to the wounded. One
doctor, and in some cases two, are as
signed to an entire division. These doc
tors appoint assistants from the men in
the ranks, who, after a little instruc
tion, are given a few bandages, cotton,
! carbolic acid, quinine, etc., and assigned
to the various regiments in the division.
These men are expected to give the first
aid to the wounded and administer such
medicines as they may have when they
are required, but even then it often
happens that they are not present when
the men are wounded, and it is neces
sary to take them many miles on horse
back, or in hammocks hung on a long
pole before their wounds are dressed.
Owing to this delay small wounds often
prove very serious. After their wounds
are attended to they are taken as soon
as practicable to one of the many small
hospitals In the woods, where they are
given every attention possible under
the circumstances.
These hospitals are nothing more
than deserted country houses, with
beds made by driving forked sticks into
the ground, two at the head and two
at the foot; a heavy stick is then laid
in each pair of the works, and thin
j sticks, laid lengthwise of the bed, rest
on these. The frame is then covered
with banana leaves and, if possible to
! procure it, a sheet completes the bed.
I These hospitals are in charge of a
practicante, but under the general su
pervision of the doctor, who visits them
as often as possible; and in some cases, |
after a he: vy engagement, .a doctor or
several doctors are assigned to them,
and remain as long as their services
are required. As soon as a new pa
tient arrives he is placed on a new |
bed, as the same bed is never used I
twice, and is given an attendant to j
do his cooking and attend to his wants, j
These hospitals are well supplied with I
bandages and medicine, and the prefect j
is required to keep then; supplied with j
vegetables, sugar, milk, etc. The gen- j
eral in whose division they are fur- i
niehea meat, and. the country people!
bring chickens, eggs and any little I
dainties they may have. As the wounds I
are mostly from Mauser balls, few am- |
putations are necessary, and the pa- ]
tients recover rapidly; but when the
wounds are from Remingtons with the
ordinary lead ball, or the lead ball with
a thin brass Jacket (explosive ball), 'â 
they often prove fatal, and if the pa- j
tient recovers, the improvement is slow, j

AGREES TO
ISSUE BONDS
The Senate Backs Up
the Proposition.
COMMITTEE MINORITY UPHELD
SILVER BULLION TO BE COINED
IN LIEU OF SEIGNIORAGE.
Two Most Important and Significant
Votes Taken in Connection With
the War Revenue
Measure.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, June 3.
While the war revenue measure was
not passed by the Senate to-day, two
very important votes were taken, one
on a proposition to coin the silver bul
lion in the Treasury and to issue sil
ver certificates against the coin, and
j the other on the bond proposition, pre
sented by the Republican minority of
the committee on finance. In lieu of
the seigniorage amendment offered by
the majority of the Finance Commit
tee, Wolcott (R.) of Colorado proposed
an amendment authorizing the Secre
tary of the Treasury to coin the silver
bullion in the Treasury and to issue sil
ver certificates against it. After some
discussion a vote was reached and the
amendment was agreed to, 48 to 31, sev
eral Republicans voting for it.
Aldrich (R.) of Rhode Island then
pressed the amendment of the minor
ity of the Finance Committee provid
ing for the issue of $100,000,000 certifi
cates of indebtedness and $300,000,000 of
bonds to be used exclusively for the
payment of the expenses of the war.
After an extended debate, the question
was brought to an issue and by the de
cisive vote of 45 to 31, the bond amend
ment was incorporated in the bill as a
substitute for the amendment to issue
legal tender notes. The bond proposi
tion received the votes of 3? Republi
cans, 7 Democrats and 1 Populist. Th^
Democrats who voted for it were Caf
fery, Faulkner, Gorman, Gray, Lind
say, Mitchell and Murphy, and the Pop
ulist was Kyle. No Republicans voted
against the issue of bonds, the votes In
opposition to bonds being cast by 21
Democrats, 5 Populists and 5 Silver Re
publicans.
Just before adjournment this even
ing a sensational speech was made by
Wolcott (R.) of Colorado, in reply to
some suggestions concerning the bi
metallic commission made by Allen
(P.) of Nebraska,
During the discussion of the war rev
enue bill Allison said, without including
the last 75,000 volunteers called for, the
estimate made was that the war expenses
for the first year would be at leant $3(9.
000 000 He regarded an addition of $70,
000,000 for the additional volunteers as en
tirely reasonable.
Morrlll (R.) of Vermont, the venerable
chairman of the Finance Committee, de
livered a short speech in opposition to the
"propositions that come to us from the
Populist side of the Senate to issue
greenbacks and coin the seigniorage."
Woloott (R.) of Colorado proposed an
amendment to the amendment of the
committee upon the coinage of the seign
iorage It was in the nature of a substi
tute, and after being slightly amended a
direct vote upon it was reached, Jones
(D ) of Arkansas giving notice that he
would move hereafter to substitute the
committee amendment for the Wolcott
amendment.
"Wolcott's amendment was agreed to â
48 to 31 as follows:
Ayesâ Allen, Bacon, Bate, Berry, Butler,
Cannon, Cartpr, Chandler, Chilton, Clark,
Cookrell, Daniel. Faulkner, Gray, HatiÃbrough.

Millan, Mason, Morrlll. Murphy. Nelson, Platt
(Conn.), Platt (K. V.), Proctor, Sewell, Spoon
er, Wetmoreâ 3l.
The amendment as agreed to follows:
That the Secretary of the Treasury shall lm
i mediately cause to be coined as fast as pos
sible into standard silver dollars, to an amount
of not less than $4,000,000 per month, which shall
be of like weight anÂ«J fineness and of like legal
i tender and quality as those provided for un
: der existing law, all the silver bullion now
i held in the treasury.
That the Secretary of the T-easury is au-
I thorized and directed tn fssuu as said silver
I is coined silver certificates of similar design
and denominations and of the same quality,
payable and redeemable in like manner as
those authorized by law, to the amount of the
' gain or seigniorage derived from the purchases
of silver bullion by the Treasury under the
act of July 14, ISiW, until the sum of $42,000,000
i shall have been issued. â¢ .__-_...â.
That all said moneys so coined, Including the
amounts of the pains or seigniorage so coined,
shall be used both for the redemption of the
Treasury notes heretofore issued under and by
virtue of the act of July 14, ISJO, and for the
redemption of the certificates issued, under this
j act.
Aldrich moVed to strike out the com
i mittee amendment providing for the issue
lof legal tender notes and substitute the
i bond provision offered by the Republican
minority of the Finance Committee. Upon
I this motion he demanded the ayes and
noes. It was carried, 45 to 31.
Chandler offered his amendment in
' verting a declaration that the policy of
i the United States is not to commit the
country more thoroughly to the single
gold standard, but that the efforts of the
Government shall be steadily directed to
coin both silver and gold as standard
money.
Stewart offered as an amendment to
Chandler's amendment a provtslon that
no bonds issued under this act shall be
used ns a basis of bank currency.
Morgan gave notice of an amendment
directing the Secretary of the Treasury to
enforce those provisions of the Income
tax of 1594 not expressly declared by the
Supreme Court's decision to be unconsti
tutional.
Morgan spoke In support of the amend
ment and attacked the national banks,
which, he declared, -were behind the con
spiracy to force a bond issue upon the
people.
The amendment offered by Stewart was
laid on the table, on motion of Mr.
Chandler, 44 to 27.
Hoar proposed an amendment to be add
ed to Chandler's amendment, as follows:
"And to this end to relax no effort to se
cure the co-operation of the principal
commercial nations of the world."
The amendment was agreed to, 35 to 33.
In the course of some remarks upon bi
j uietallism Allen of Nebraska took a
I reminiscent turn and discussed at length
i the work of the International Bimetallism
Commission. He declared their work had
I been a failure and that no good had over
i been expected to come from it, and that
international bimetallism was a delusion
and a snaro. An appropriation of $100,000
had been made for the commission, which
had traveled throughout Europe on a mis
sion which was foredoomed to failure.
Wolcott, who was president of the Bi
metallic Commission; listened attentively
to Mr. Allen's remarks. He was evidently
indignant, and he took the floor to re
ply to his criticisms. He said:
It is not pleasant to a self-respecting man to
meet such susseÃtionn as have been made by
the Senator from Nebranka. This debate has
taken a turn which I deprecate, and 1 would
not now occupy a moment of the Senatp's
time, which ought to be devoted to the con
sideration of the pending bill, were It not
that I desire to inform the Senator from
Nebraska that the three commissioners ap
pointed by the President spent more than six
months in Europe traveling where their
duties took them. They were accompanied
by a secretary, and the entire expense of the
work accomplished was only $16,000. And I
desire to add that every member of the com
mission In accepting the appointment and
performing his doties sacrificed thoueands of
dollars, It Is undignified â  and unbefitting, a
Senator of the â â  United Btates to : stand In kls
place on this floor and . suggest | that the com
mission spent money â It was not justified In
spending. . I am getting tired of hearing that
sort of suggestions from , the , Senator . from
Nebraska. It Is not the first; the second 01
the third time he has thrown them ! out.'
Through him they are being circulated In the
'/West ; by .:* means of "the patent insiders"
which constitute the bone and sinew and
most of . the ' brains of the Populist party. I
suppose at some - crossroads In Nebraska,
where nothing is known of Europe except that
it is on the map of the world, some people of
the Senator's kind - have gotten together - and
resolved : that :no country, except the United
States is enlightened enough to have ideas on
the money question. They are" not aware that
the great ..' leaders of thought, in ; England,
France and Germany favored bimetallism
mor# than a quarter of a century before the
Populist party or the Senator from Nebraska
were ever heard of. Fortunately, : however,
the blmetalllsts of Europe are not hampered
in_their work by long-haired cranks, who clog
the progress of . enlightened financial legisla
tion In this country.
Allen made a very brief reply to Wbl
cott, speaking calmly and coolly. He ex
plained that he had not charged the
commission with extravagance or with
having squandered the money appro
priated. What he did say, he insisted, was
that the appropriation was made when it
was evident that the effort to be made
would be a failure. He contended, there
fore, that the money should- not have
been expended at all. Yet, because he had
held that belief, and held it now, he was,
he said, made the subject of the Colorado
Senator's sophomoric philippics. He was
not. he concluded, afraid of the Senator
(Wolcott) in the Senate or elsewhere. â¢. :
An effort was then made by Allison to
effect an arrangement whereby a vote
might be taken this evening, but it was
unsuccessful. The consensus of opinion
was that an adjournment until to-morrow
would facilitate the final disposition of the
measure. After agreeing to meet at 11
o'clock â¢ to-morrow the Senate, at 6
o'clock, went Into executive session, and
soon afterward adjourned.
CRUELTY OF THE SPANIARDS.
"We need not recall the historifc bar
1 barities of the old conquistadors like
I Cortez and Pizarro, the horrors of tl>:
; Duke of Alva's rule in the Netherlands
when it was subject to Spain, or the
abominable incidents of the expulsion
of the Moors. These things occurred
centuries ago, but when the corrupt
and oppressive rule of Spanish author
ity produced the insurrection of the
South American provinces there had
been no improvement. It is shown in
Spanish official documents that' in Ven
ezuela, New Granada' and Ecuador 80,
000 prisoners of war were "sacrificed
In cold blood' by hanging, shooting and
other modes of execution." This is.
apart from the merciless slaughter in
captured towns, where it is declared in
official dispatches that 'such or such a
| pueblo "with all Its inhabitants has
disappeared from the face: o f the
earth." When. the. Venezuelan chief,
Miranda, surrendered to General Mon
teverde in 1812 4000 revolutionists de
livered up their arms under an express I
j stipulation of amnesty and oblivion of
the past and security to life and prop
erty. How Spanish faith was. kept is
related in this historical account of the
sequel:
"As soon as the revolutionary troops
were disarmed throughout the province
Monteverde sent parties of dissolute
soldiery to seize almost every resp.ec- â¢
table Creole in the province. They were
torn from the arms of wives and chil
dren, bound to horses' . tails, and thus
brought to the city of Caracas. After
being exposed to the scoffs and insults
of a brutal soldiery,' they were thrown
Into close and damp dungeons, crowded
together in a manner more dreadful,
than the victims who perished in the
Black Hole of Calcutta: â¢ â¢ * About
1500 Creoles of the highest respectabil
ty in the country were chained in pairs,
! conducted to the horrid dungeons of La
! Guayra and Puerto Cavello, where in a
i few weeks many of them perished by
! suffocation and diseases."
Was this violation of the terms of
! capitulation disclaimed at Madrid? On
; the contrary, it was distinctly a'p
; proved, and a decree of the Cortes,
j dated April 10, 1813, has been preserved,
I which declared: "That it was deroga
tory to the majesty ' of the National
Congress to confirm., a capitulation
I made with malignant insurgents."
HOW LINCOLN ESCAPED.
The demand for an additional body
I guard around the White House recalls
an incident of the Civil. V,'ar -within the
memory, of many residents. During the
exciting period of 1861 great fears were
entertained for the safety of the Pres
ident and every precaution was taken
to insure his personal protection.
One morning there appeared at the
White House a woman, closely veiled,
demanding an immediate interview
with Mr. Lincoln. Approaching Mea
! senger Perkins, who guarded the door
I of Mr. Lincoln's private office, the vis
itor made known her request, and
pleaded earnestly that she be admitted
to a personal interview. The door
keeper's orders were, however, very
strict, and finding her eloquence all in
> vain, she finaJly compromised by con-
I tiding her message to the courteous but
firm employe. Taking him to one side,
the veiled lady seized both his hands
and tenderly rubbed them as she ex
tracted a promise that he would im
mediately deliver her request to the
President. Perkins was almost over
come by a peculiar odor that appeared
to emanate from his companion, and
hastened to get rid of. her without cre
ating a scene.
No sooner had he accomplished this
than he confided to. one of the official
household the effect produced upon him
while in conversation with the.importu
! nate visitor. A physician who was
! present promptly divined, the truth and
instituted a search for the woman,
when It was learned that she had driv
en rapidly away in a carriage, and all
trace was losti Perkins was immedi
ately ordered to return to his home arid
await developments.
Within the usual period he was- taken
111 with one of the worst cases of viru
lent smallpox on record, and for weeks
lay at the point of death. Upon his re
covery the faithful messenger, whose
devotton to duty doubtless saved the
life of the President, was appointed to
a permanent position on the clerical
force of the War Department, which
office he has continued to hold up to
date, being one of the most efficient
clerks on the rolls. â Washington Post.
CUBA'S TOBACCO INDUSTRY.
Nope of the native inhabitants of
Cuba or the refugees, in this country
will welcome the freedom cf the island
so gladly as the tobacco planters "and
cigar manufacturers.. This industry,
which furnished a means of livelihood
to a large proportion of the inhabi
tants of the three provinces of Pinar
del Rio, Havana and Matanzas, has
been brought to a complete standstill
by the present war. The Spaniards
in the fulfillment of their policy of de
vastation have destroyed the planta
tions, and upon the smoking ruins of
the farmhouses have left notices warn
ing the proprietors against any at
tempt to cultivate the forbidden crop
in the future.
In the city of Havana the manufac
turers, who ar^ almost exclusively Cu
bans, have been compelled to give up
the manufacture of cigars, rfot only
through lack of material, but because
of General Weyler's edict nr^ainst the
export of tobacco in any form. The
result has been that there are now but
two factories c.t work in the city, and
they are engaged merely In making
cigars for the Spn- ' h grandees and
such of the Cuban inhabitants as can
afford to pay the exorbitant prices de
manded.
Before the war began there were over
400 cigar manufacturers in the city of
Havana, who each employed between
500 and 700 men, and many smaller
Jobbers, each of whom gave employ
ment to thirty or forty men and girls.
As an instance of the way in which
the business has b n crippled, one of
the largest cigar manufacturers in
Havana turned out V-re the war 250,
000 a day. Now he Is not .'aaking a

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 3.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Unless
the war revenue bill shall be unex
pectedly delayed in the Senate the Ha
waiian annexation resolution will be
taken up in the House of Representa
tives next Tuesday.
This is the present understanding be
tween Chairman Hitt of the Commit
tee of Foreign Affairs and - Speaker
Reed. It is not yet certain whether
it will be brought up under a special
order or be called up under the rula
which provides that after the House
has considered the business of commit
tees for one hour it shall be in order
for a member to. move the considera
tion of any bill which has been pre
viously reported from the committee
of the whole.
No agreement has yet been made as
to the length of the fiebate. The an
nexationists wish to have as little talk
as possible, and they hope to reach a
vote after two days. of speech making.
If some arrangement as to the length
of debate cannot be made by unani
mous consent a special order will be
reported from the Committee on Rules
to limit the debate.
While the House is talking on Hawaii
the conferees on the war revenue bill
will be at work, and it is expected they
will reach an agreement by the time
the resolution shall have passed the
House. â¢.'â 'â¢ ' .
When this conference report be dis

nothing .more to hold Congress in ses

to accelerate the action of the Senate
by concentrating the attention of the
public on that body.

THE ASSAILANT ARRESTED

: During a- quarrel on a schooner at the
â  foot of Third street late yesterday after
noon Charles Forstman. captain of the
Pchponer: Louise, was almost Instantly
â  killed'; by Anton* 'Christiansen, who was
in charge of : tne schooner Reliance. The
1 iti en had a dispute as to. their respective

According' to Christiansen's story Forst

grabbed a pair of tongs which he had

. The- wounded captain was at once re

SHOT TO SCARE, BUT HIT.
WORRIED and harassed by the mischievous tricks of a crowd of boys,
George Wilson, living in a little hut at 323 Spear street, fired six
shots last evening for the purpose of frightening his tormentors,
but one o.f them struck John Dumphrey, a twelve-year-old young
; . ster, in the abdomen, inflicting a very slight flesh wound. The boy
ran to the fire engine house at 320 Main Btreet and informed the men that
hÂ« had been; shot.' They immediately telephoned for the Harbor Hospital
ambulance. aÂ»d when the doctors examined the youth it was found tliat
hfs 4njupy Was Itblhlng mere than a scratch, and the boy soon afterward
w-ilkfil (0 his home at I Zoe pLace-. Officers Lake and Mahoney were at
the .-hospital., and. when they learned of the shooting went to Wilson's house,
arrested. him and charged him with assault to commit murder.
According td Wilson's account of the affair and the statements of
neighbors the old man has had a groat deal of provocation to deal harshly
with a iarga gang of boy* living near him. He lives in a little Bxl2, well
patched board cabin directly under the- east bluff of the Sailors' Home, and
by s-elling kimlling-wood manages to support himself and an old man named
John Hall, .trhotn he calls his partner. The fact of the two men living
alone in- their little- shack has caused a number of stories to their discredit
to be circulated, and the boys in-the neighborhood have been in the habit
of bothering the men .for pome time past.
A; little uvt'i- a year ago Wilson, was hit by a stone and his Jaw was
broken. . . H.o. iiris -asked the protection of the police a number of times, but
the guardians. of the- law have been unable to find the boys who have been
implicated in the. work of tormenting him. Every time Wilson would ap
pear at .his' door when any of the boys were in the vicinity of the place
he received a volley of stones, and the ground in front of the house looks
like a srriall-sifced rock quarry. Thursday night some one who Wilson
thinks belonged to his gang of tormentors broke the padlock of his door
and stole, some articles from the house. Last night on his return home a
crowd of- about fourteen boys assailed, him with a volley of rocks. He
concealed hlrhself : behind a fence in the rear of his hut and fired five shots
into 'the air to attract an officer and scare the boys. When he had ex
hausted;, the ammunition in his gun the boys, being aware of the fact,
shouted: "Come on now, he haÂ« no more cartridges!" and made a charge
an th* place. Wilson', in the meantime, had reloaded, and as the boys ad
vanced fifed another shot through the fence. It was this shot which hit
Dumphrey, and had it not been that the force of the bullet had been di
minished by passing through the fence the shot might have resulted in a
more dangerous wound.
Wilson regretted bavins injured any one, and was greatly rejoiced when
he heard that the boy was not severely injured. He says there are a num
ber of large, boys, in the party, who. tried to get to him by climbing into
the yard of the Sailors' Home, but that the inmates of the place, who were
his fri.endsi would not allow them to enter the grounds.
of thÂ« matter, reported the cases pro
gressing favorably. Two have already '
been tried and a favorable verdict had !
been received In one of them. There aro |
still eight Indictments against the John |
Kelso Company, but on the advice of At
torney Knight, these will not be pressed
just at present. Messrs. Saunders and Rob- :
bins were deputed to formulate a letter â¢
to Attorney Knight, thanking him for the |
'. very satisfactory manner In which he has ;
I handled the cases. It was also reported
that Gray Brothers are living strictly up j
to the law in laying the concrete founda- j
tlons.

THE SA"tf FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JDNE 4, 1898.
INITIAL BOW OF A PRODIGY.
Irwin Eveleth Haskell, a Young and Brilliant Pianist,
Who Will Soon Make His Debut,
Another youthful prodigy is about to make his debut in this city.
The latest aspirant for musical recognition is Master Irwln Eveleth Hassell, a
Native Son of but 16 years of age, but who, it is said, possesses a technique per
fect in all its numerous details, with an appreciation and expression of music
far beyond his years.
Young Hassell is of slight build, intellectual in appearance, refined and
modest to a degree. According to the accredited descriptions of the composer,
Haydn, the young pianiste Is his living counterpart. He possesses a large head,
with well-developed brain, and a face strong but mobile.
The youthful artist- was educated at the King Conservatory of Music In
San Jose, and while there proved himself a veritable genius. His sentiment in
all its varied moods is remarkable, and his execution is said to be astonishingly
powerful and brilliant. His selections cover a wide range, rendered with earnest
feeling, and display an easy mastery of technical difficulties only acquired by
finished pianists after most careful training, repose being a most conspicuous
feature.
He will make his initial bow to a local audience on Saturday afternoon. .Tune
11th, in Sherman & Clay Hall. The coming recital will he a complimentary affair
for the purpose of introducing him to the musical world of this city, and the fol
lowing programme will be rendered: Sonata, op. 35 (Chopin); Tarantelle, op. 4
(Karpranoff i; "Hark, Hark, the I.ark" (Schubert-Liszt); Sch.rzo a la Russe, op.
1 (Tschalkowsky) ; Fugue in F (Hassell); Humoreske, op. 10, No. 1 (King); Scher
zo, op. 31, Etude, op. 26, No. T. Valse, op. 64, Xo. 2. Andante Spianato and Polon
aise, op. 22 (Chopin); Concerto, op. '-'> (.Mendelssohn). A selected orchestra will
accompany him in the rendition of the concerto, which will afford an excellent op
portunity for the exhibition of his ensemble work.
TROOPS AT CAMP MERRITT.
Regiments Familiar With
Frontier Hardships Not in
Second Expedition.
All sorts of rumors, generated by the
I exceedingly indefinite order of Thursday
1 night, were in circulation at Camp Mer
â  ritt yesterday regarding the troops for
the second expedition for the Philippines.
The order states that the troops must be
ready to leave by next Tuesday. It will
i undoubtedly be several days after that
I date, for aside from the fact that the
: transports cannot possibly be ready by
j the time specified, the organizations des
ignated to form the expedition are de
ficient in the way of equipment.
General Merritt, according to Eastern
advices, has had much to say since his
appointment to the command of the ex
pedition about hts lack of confidence In
new troops. Then with an inconsistency
'â  that Is quite refreshing he issues an or
i der naming not the entire Eighteenth and
Twenty-third ( nlted States regiments
but merely a battalion of each, and then
falls back on the volunteers, selecting
the Tenth Pennsylvania and First Colo
rado. When it is considered that a
month ago nut a company in the regular
establishment exceeded fifty enlisted men
and that fully 40 per rent of the com
mands are now composed of as raw re
cruits a.Â« can be found in the newest vol
unteer organization, one fails to see
where General Merritt's "trained vete
rans" come In.
The First Colorado is certainly as fine
a command as <-;in be found anywhere;
the men are robust, well drilled and capa
ble of the greatest endurance, but they
are not fully equipped, and it will take
some time to get them in shape for the
campaign.
i he Tenth Pennsylvania has a fine rec
ord, and will doubtless justify the mark
Of confidence General Merritt has shown
it. but It is a small command, only eight
companies, and many of the men are re
cruits. This regiment, too. is not fully
equipped in the way of quartermaster
stores and ordnance, there being BeveraJ
commands now in camp that are much
bett.-r prepared for service in these re
spects.
If General Merritt is looking for men
best qualified to endure the hardships of
a campaign in the Philippines he should
not overlook the Montana, Wyoming. Da
kota and other far Western troops. These
men are familiar with hardships, and
probably three out of every five of them
could give the hardiest veteran in the
regular service some valuable pointers
on camp life and fighting, as they are all
as familiar with the rifle as others are
with the pen and yard stick.
The following order was transmitted to
Colonel Hale of the First Colorado yes
terday, and is Identical with one received
by Colonel Hawkins of the Tenth Penn

proximately 2000 officers and men. The
China Zealandla, Colon. Centennial and
Ohio ought to carry 4500. so that the
Seventh California will probably be in

ceived assurances some days ago that his
command would go with the second ex

made to thoroughly equip the regiment,
so that to-day it is better prepared for
service than any other volunteer regiment
in General Merritt's command.
The quartermaster, commissary and
ordnance departments may. by herculean
efforts get the troops In readiness to sail
by Tuesday, hut it is a certainty that the
transports cannot now be fitted up and

ELKS ENTERTAIN.
i
Soldiers Enjoy a "Military" So
cial Session.
The session of San Francisco Lodge No.
3 of the Benevolent and Protective Order
of Elks in its magnificent lodgerooms in
Central Block last night is one that will
be long remembered by all who attended,
as it was one of the most patriotic and
i enthusiastic ever held under the auspices
jof that organization. The hall was deeo
] rated with the grandest of decorations,
the American flag festooned over the
chair of the exalted ruler, anfl the occa
sion for ail this was "a military social
Bession to all visiting brothers enlisted
with the United Slates army now in San
Francisco."
There were present: Colonel J. L.
Jewett of Indiana, Judge-Advocate on the
'staff of General Merritt; Colonel Reaves
and Lieutenant-Colonel Ames of Minne
sota; Captain F. de L. ( 'arrlnyton,
U. S. A., of Oakland Lodge; Captain R.

During the regular session Colonel
â  Jewett, who is an Elk, delivered an ad
dress, in which he eulogized the flag that
the order loves, and. speaking of the
charity of the order, said that it extended
to all, "to God's poor, the devil's poor and
the poor devil."
The exalted ruler appointed George E.
de Golia of Oakland Lodge chairman of
the social session. After patriotic selec
tions by the orchestra and the singing of
the "Star-spang4ecl Banner" by the vis
itors and hundreds of Elks present. Gen
eral W. H. L. Barnes delivered the ad
dress of welcome, which wbs a most elo
quent and patriotic effort, and was vo
ciferously applauued. In conclusion he
said that the strangers had been favor
ably impressed by the welcome from the
ladies; "but wait," he said "till you re
turn visitations, and the welcome they
will give you there will be such that all
the unmarried men will never return to
the States from which they came."'
The response was by Colonel Jewett,
and then there were addresses by Colonel
Reaves, Lieutenant \Colonel Ames and
others, and a programme of song and
music by professional talent from all the
theaters in the city except from the Cali
fornia.
There was an abundance of refresh
ments. The meeting closed with expres
sions of godspeed to the soldiers and
cheers for the flag.
Presidio to Be Made Sanitary.
The presence of the United States vol
unteers on private camping grounds Is a
subject that the Chamber of Commerce
has seen lit to take notice of, and in or
der that the Government may be made
aware of that fact, ton-ether with the ne
cessity of putting the grounds at the Pre
sidio In proper sanitary condition, the
following dispatch was forwarded to Sen
ator Perkins yesterday from the Cham
ber of Commerce:
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.
RAN FRANCISCO, June 3, 1898.
Hon. George C. Perkins, Washington, D. C. :
Please present this to the California delegation.
It Is suddenly found that the Presidio military
reservation is not fit for a large military camp.
It is sadly short of water â  and Inadequately
eewered. The soldiers sent to the city are
camped on private property. The trouble is
very serious in view, of possible emergencies
and should be remedied at . once. Other coast
cities have noted the failure of the Presidio
to meet military demands and propose offering
the Government land for rendezvous purposes
with a view of drawing the soldiers away from
here. Steps should be < taken to Immediately
provide the Presidio with the proper supply
of fresh water and to have It properly sewered,
every portion, of it. ; The military and com
mercial interests of the city make immediate
action Imperatively, necessary.
HUGH CRAIG,
*â *mj President Chamber of Commerce.
THE PASSING
OF THE GRADY
Now Known as the
Steamer F. M. Smith.
WHAT MARINERS MAY EXPECT
FORECAST OF NORTH PACIFIC
WEATHER FOR JUNE.
The Harbor Commissioners Expect
to Open the New Ferry Depot
to the Public Next
Month.
The old sternwheel steamer H. C. Grady
Is to change her name and go to the
Klondike. There is a hoodoo on her pres
ent cognomen, so her owners are going to
see If the name F. M. Smith will not
bring a change of fortune. Collector of
the Port Jackson has been appealed to,
and he has given permission, so in a few
days the H. C. Grady will be officially
known as the F. M. Smith of Oakland,
Cal.
The Grady never made any money for |
her owners. She was built In Portland
and ran on the Columbia River for a
time. Then she was laid up, and finally
some of the fruit dealers In Oakland
tried to buy her for the Sacramento River ,
trade. Everything but the paying of the
purchase money waa carried out, and the
vessel was held at the last minute. Fi
nally everything was straightened out .
and the Grady came to San Francisco.
She made Beveral trips up the Sacra
mento in opposition to the Southern Pa- '
cilie, but her debts followed her from
Portland, and the new ones incurred here
soon swamped the venture. She was
libeled, seized by the United States Mar
shal, sold at public auction and has ever ,
since been lying up in Oakland Creek. I
She is now to be brought out of retire- ;
ment, and it is to be hoped that under
the name of F. M. Smith she will make
money for so mo one.
Captain John Barnesen has sold a half
Interest in the weU known bark Scminole
for $tioou to Mrs. M. R. West, Joseph Han- '
bury and K. 1,. Renaud.
The Branch Hydrographic Office has Is
sued the following forecast of wind and
weather in the North Pacific Ocean for
June. 1S98:
"Atmospheric equilibrium obtains In
June more than during any other month
of the year.
"Typhoons are not frequent In the
China seas during June, but they may
occur toward the latter part of the
month, first appearing to the eastward of
the Philippine Islands. The paths of a
few typical typhoons that have occurred
during June in previous years are shown
on the chart."
The hull of the wrecked ship New York
was sold at the Merchants' Exchange
yesterday for $310 to D. Roth. The ves
sel will be broken up and everything pos- -
slble salved.
The Harbor Commissioners announce
that they expect to open the new ferry
depot to the public on July 1.
ARMY HEADQUARTERS.
Advices That lowa and Ten-
nessee Regiments Are
Coming.
First Lieutenant John G. Burnett, aid
do-camp to General Merriam, has been
put in charge of the adjutant general's
office of the department of California, in
ordter to allow Adjutant General Field to
attend more fully to the many duties
that have recently devolved upon him.
First Lieutenant George T. Bartlett of
the Third Artillery has been ordered to
proceed to Carson to muster in the nrst
troop of the Independent Nevada Cavalry.
The recruits that are being received by
Lieutenant Abernethy in the artillery re
cruiting office in the Phelan building are
, being distributed among the batteries
destined for Manila. Several hundred re
: emits arc expected from Nashville and
St. Louis in a few days for the Third Ar- i
tillery.
Lieutenant Skerrett has opened a re- :
crulting office in Los Angeles, and Is en
listing men for the artillery, and It is very
likely that all the batteries that are go
ing to the Philippines will soon be filled
to the limit.
Robert E. "Williams, acting assistant
Burgeon, will accompany Battery C,
Heavy Artillery Volunteers, from the
Presidio to Fort Canby, Washington, at
the mouth of the Columbia River.
Lieutenant Thomas of the Twenty
third Infantry has opened a recruiting
office in rooms 6 and 7, 23 Kearny street.
A dispatch has been received by Cap- ;
tain Thompson, chief quartermaster of
the department of California, that the
First Tennessee Volunteer Infantry will
leave Nashville in a few days for San
Francisco, probably reaching here at the
end of next week.
The Fifty-first Tnwa Volunteer Infan
try has been ordered to San Francisco.
It is not yet known when this regiment
will start.
All the troops going to Manila on the
second expedition next week have been
completely outfitted by the clothing and
equipage department, which has been
kept very busy for the last ten days.
ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE.
Soldiers Pursue a Prisoner
With Fixed Bayonets.
The sight of eight stalwart soldiers
charging through the streets with fixed
bayonets In pursuit of a fugitive cre
ated n profit deal of excitement at North
Beach yesterday afternoon.
Private Madison of Company E, Wash
ington Volunteers, has for some days
been confined In the guardhouse, await
ing- sentence for shamming sickness and
using vile and abusive language to an
officer. Yesterday afternoon he was per
mitted to go out for exercise under the
guard of a sentry. A five-foot board
fence runs along the easterly end of the
Fontana barracks ground, and as the
couple approached the prisoner suddenly
made a bold dash and scaled the fence.
The sentry jabbed at him with a bay
onet and missed. Then the chase began.
Lieutenant Weigle, the officer of the
guard, was near by when the incident oc
curred, and he at once called the guard
and started in pursuit. The chase was
hot down Francisco street to Jones, where
the fugitive cut across lots, over a fence
and into a house fronting on Bay street.
Lieutenant Weigle at once posted a guard
around the house, and after a long search
finally discovered the prisoner hiding un
der a bed. When dragged out he was
crestfallen and sullen and permitted him
self to be taken back to the guard
house without attempting to resist.
It has not been customary for the sen
tries to carry ammunition, it having here
tofore been considered unnecessary, but
in the future they will be prepared for
any emergency which may arise. On his
return to the barracks Lieutenant Weigle
was warmly commended for his activity
in recapturing the prisoner.
The Soldiers' Postoffice.
Postmaster Montague has fixed upon
Ihe corner of Fourth avenue and C as
the site for the temporary branch post
office for the accommodation of the sol
diers. Only mail deposited by or ad
dressed to soldiers will be handled, and
all classes of mai' including registered
letters and packages will be received.
The only mail business which will not be
done will be the issuance and receipt of
money orders.
Through Postmaster Montague's efforts
the department at Washington has made
an allowance for the salary of three
clerks for that work, and the San Fran
cisco Board of Supervisors have granted
Mr. Montague the use of one of the port
able election booths free of charge.

RECIPROCITY TREATIES.
PROTESTS which our wine men have sent to
Congress against the new reciprocity treaty with
France are in the nature of efforts toward locking
the stable door after the horse is stolen. They will
arrive too late to be of much use. The question of
law raised by them with regard to the construction of
the clause authorizing the President to reduce duties
on Wines is one which can be settled only by the
courts, or possibly by an opinion from the Attorney-
General. Congress certainly has nothing to do with
it, nor is the President likely to interfere now
and denounce the treaty within a week after he has
made it.
While the protests are likely to be unavailing in this
case, it is not too late to attempt. to prevent further
.-damage by future treaties. Our Government is at this
time negotiating for reciprocity with Germany and
Italy, both of which countries are large exporters of
tyine. Unless strong protests are sent to Washington
it is probable arrangements will be made with them
si:m!ar to those made with France. In that case our
wine men will have to compete with all the wine
countries of Europe, and not with one of them alone,
as at present. â â '':.' " . .
It is to be regretted that our wine producers have
been so dilatory in presenting their case. At the time
â the Dingley bill was under, consideration The Call
repeatedly directed attention to the fact that the ar
ticles on which the President was authorized to reduce
duties were almost all of them of California produc
tion and that we therefore would have to stand the
burden of such treaties for the benefit of the rest of
the country. No action, however, was taken at that
time. The section was adopted without protest, and
now the President has no option but to act under it.
It is to be hoped the legal question raised in the
protest may be decided in our favor. An opinion of
Attorney-General McKenna set aside a clause of the
tnrifF which weighed heavily upon New England, and
possibly we may have the present issue terminated in
cur interests. It is to be borne in mind, however,
that foreign treaties made in accordance with the con
stitution are the supreme law of the land, and there
fore the chance of getting one of them materially
altered is by no means promising.
The best solution of the matter would be to have
section t, of the tariff materially amended so as to per
mit the. President to negotiate reciprocity treaties by
concessions on other articles besides wine lees, wines,
1 randies and works of art, or else abolish it alto-
Kcther. There is ample scope for reciprocity treaties
under section 4. which authorizes the President, with
the advice and consent of the Senate, to grant reduc
tions on any and all articles in return for equal con
ions. Such treaties can be made to bear impar
tially on all- parts of the Union, and therefore would
be fairer than those provided for in section 3.
The protests sent on by our wine men will have the
effect of calling., attention to the unfairness, of the
present law. To that extent they witl do good. The
Senate may not have power to revise the treaty just
prranged with France, but it can interfere to prevent
further treaties -of the kind, and as further treaties
are now in process of negotiation such efforts are well
Avorth the making. .

AN APPEAL TO PREJUDICE.
THE Post pushes Hawaiian annexation, attacks
Senator White for his opposition and declares
that only the sugar trust is trying to defeat the
absorption of the islands into our body politic.
This is an appeal to prejudice and not to reason.
The sugar trust is represented as fighting for its life,
which it will lose if Hawaii be annexed. In this way
it is expected to array all the prejudice against trusts
on the side of annexation in the expectation that when
it is accomplished the sugar trust will cease to exist
and other trusts will get a mortal blow.
The sugar trust is merely an association of com
panies and individuals engaged in refining sugar,
which issues a common stock. This association of
people engaged in the same business may be good or
bad; that feature does not enter into the present dis
cussion. It is represented as opposing the annexation
of Hawaii on the ground that its selfish interests will
so suffer thereby that it will not be able to exist.
Will our contemporary explain why annexation will
injure the manufacturers of sugar? They buy raw
sugar and refine it. The Hawaiian raw sugar comes
in now duty free, under the reciprocity treaty, is
bought, refined and sold by the sugar manufacturers
associated in the sugar trust. If the islands are an
nexed their raw sugar will continue to come in duty
free, will be bought, refined and marketed by the man
ufacturers in the sugar trust? What difference will
this unchanged situation make to them? How are the
members of this association to be helped or hurt by
annexation? If it will dissolve the trust, why will it
do so? These are questions that have never been
answered, though the appeal to prejudice which
prompts them has been made from the beginning.
Yet no one has ever explained how annexation would
so unfavorably affect the refiners of sugar as to drive
them into a life and death struggle to prevent it.
In the alignment of Senators on annexation there is
no evidence of the appearance of the allied sugar re
finers. If the very papers which make this charge told
the truth, while the tariff bill was pending certain Sen
ators were friendly to the sugar trust and aided it in
fixing the differential between raw and refined
sugar. If it is true, as was then charged, that these
Senators belonged to the sugar trust and were legis
lating in its interest and under its control, surely in a
battle for its life, which it is represented to be making
against annexation, these Senators should be with it.
That they are not is notorious. Quite to the contrary,
annexation is opposed by Senators who were praised
by these same papers for not belonging to the sugar
trust.
A year ago Senator White, for illustration, was held
up to public admiration for opposing the sugar dif
ferential which it was alleged the trust desired. To
day he is held up to public displeasure because he
opposes annexation and is condemned as a tool of the
sugar trust. Important changes in public policy and
permanent abandonment of our scheme of govern
ment should not be the fruit of appeals to passion and
prejudice, but should issue from calm and most de
liberate judgment.
HARD TO SATISFY.
I \ATRIOTISM was sufficiently strong among
1 ./members of all parties in the House of Repre
* sentatives to procure the passage of the urgency
deficiency bill on Thursday by a unanimous vote.
The desire to talk and protest, however, was too re
calcitrant in many of them to be overcome even by
patriotic instincts. Accordingly there was a debate,
brief but lively, which brought to the front several
classes of war critics and showed how impossible it
is to please everybody even when everybody wishes
to be pleased.
The object of the deficiency bill is to provide for
the emergency expenses of the army and navy brought
about by the war. The measure naturally gave rise
to a consideration of the provisions which have been
made to carry on the struggle. The first outbreak of
the debate was made by a member from Massa
chusetts, who demanded that cooks be provided for the
troops at Camp Alger. This precipitated a discus
sion concerning the conditions that prevail in the
camp. Many objected to the provisions that have
been made as inadequate, but old campaigners of the
Civil War like Grosvenor of Ohio and Livingstone
of Georgia declared the volunteers of to-day are much
better provided for than were those of 1861, and,
moreover, they asserted it is well to put the young
recruits through a process of hardening in camp so
as to fit them for the greater hardships sure to come
when they go to the front.
Next came a cry that the Government has not used
' due vigor in prosecuting the war. These critics com
plained that the administration is wasting time and
money in pursuing a dilatory policy. The war is
costing over $1,000,000 a day. In fact Mr. Cannon es
timated that if it lasts a year it will cost $600,000,000.
lor nearly $2,000,000 a day. Here, then, is an economic
i basis for the cry. "On to Havana." The shouters for
1 an immediate advance demanded to know the reason
why "nothing is being done."
Scarcely had this set of critics closed their mouths
when up rose a representative from Tennessee who
criticized the Government for acting too hastily in
equipping the army. He vigorously denounced the
War Department for allowing but seven days for re
ceiving bids for supplies. Such a short time, he al
leged, did a grave injustice to persons who would like
to be bidders, but who could not get their bids ready
in a time so brief as that.
After such a debate it is not to be wondered that
Mr. Cannon, who had charge of the bill, was some
what in doubt what to say. He could do no more
than point out the absurd and whimsical inconsis
tencies of the critics. "Some gentlemen," he said,
"come here and cry out and complain because in a
twinkling an army fully equipped with tents, uni
forms, provisions, guns and everything for comfort
is not ready now. and now here comes the cyclone
from Tennessee and says, 'My God, you don't give us
but seven days to bid.' "
DEMOCRATIC OBSEQUIES.
THE morning organ of the Phelan reform "push"
confesses that its faction is afraid to hold an open
primary. To this fear, it explains, may be at
tributed the interference of the State Committee in
local politics and the appointment of a committee to
make nominating conventions and State delegations
for the Democrats of this city. Had not the corpora
tions knocked out the primary election law, the or
gan says, the Democrats of its faction would not be
afraid to hold a primary, but since the reformers will
now have to meet Sam Rainey at the polls they pre
fer to take their chances on appointed conventions.
It is quite true that Democratic politics is none of
our business, and perhaps a proper regard for the
amenities of social life dictates that we should not
interfere with the quarrels of the reform '"push." But
we have some interest in logic, and when the organ
states in one breath that it is afraid to hold a primary
because Sam Rainey will capture the party, and in the
next that Sam does not control over 2000 votes, we
confess to a demoralized feeling of mental obfusca
tion. The proposition is as clear as a pool of Potrero
mud. If 2000 Raincyitcs should not be allowed to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, SATURDAY, JUNE 4, 1898.
rule the Democratic party of San Francisco, why
should the organ be afraid to hold a primary lest
these 2000 will capture the organization ?
Of course this is all bosh. The Democratic reform
"push" docs not fear an open primary on Sam
Rainey's account. What it fears is that the Demo
cratic party of San Francisco will capture the organi
zation. Mayor Phclan now considers himself
master of the situation. All he thinks he
needs is to get the nomination of a rump
Democratic convention, the indorsement of the
Non-Partisans and the approval of Colonels
Sullivan and Murphy. So he encourages the State
Committee to resort to autocratic measures and ap
plauds its unDemocratic procedure. He thinks he is
invincible, and his newspaper organ rejoices in the
thought that under the new charter, with his assist
ance, it will get a chance either at the treasury or the
corporations.
But we question whether all this will go down with
the Democratic people of this city. An open primary
is so distinctly an unterrified institution, the privilege
for scrapping for delegates is so necessary to the
proper sustenance and development of good Demo
cratic politics, that we doubt whether the party will
survive Phelan and the State Committee. The bosses
of the latter, McNab, Gould and Alford. are assum
ing a grave responsibility. Before they go much further
they had better consult a political undertaker. There
is bound to be a general Democratic funeral here
abouts this year.
SELLING PUBLIC POSITIONS.
I~*HE prompt acquittal of School Director Waller
of the charge of soliciting $500 as a consideration
for his influence in securing a teacher's berth in
the School Department for the daughter of EH T.
Sheppard does not by any means dispose of the pop
ular notion that positions in the department are regu
larly sold for coin. Mr. Waller may be entirely in
nocent of wrongdoing, but it will take more than
the verdict of a jury upon such evidence as was given
in Sup*-ior Judge Cook's court on Thursday to
convince the public that School Directors do not
traffic in appointments.
The difficulty of proving such a charge as was pre
ferred by Mr. Sheppard is manifold. There is no
character more despised by the predatory politicians
than that of an informer, and nothing can be done
in such cases as Waller's without an informer and a
prosecution which believes in and supports informers.
Informers are difficult to discover, but they sometimes
appear. But a prosecution disposed to rely upon them
and credit their testimony is never found.
Besides, it is always easy to discredit charges such
as were preferred by Mr. Sheppard on the theory that
the motive is revenge. Mr. Sheppard wanted a
teacher's position for his daughter. He applied to
Waller for his influence, evidently expecting to get
it. Failing, it was not unnatural that in his anger
he should turn on the official and attempt to ruin
him. This, of course, is improbable. Even if per
sons exist capable of such exploits, Mr. Sheppard is
not one of them. But the mere statement of the
theory illustrates the ease with which the best of mo
tives and the highest sense of public duty may be
discredited before a jury from which politicians are
careful to exclude all hostile critics.
The root of this species of corruption, therefore,
lies deeper than the impulse of corrupt politicians to
make money out of their offices. It betrays a moral
degradation on the part of seekers after municipal
favors which is eminently discouraging. No wonder
courts and juries fail to discover evidence in such
cases as Waller's when so many persons are found
willing to pay for places under the municipal govern
ment without any idea that they are guilty of moral
turpitude in making their bargains.
OUR CHEESE EXPORTS.
/~* ONSULAR Reports for May contains a report
I from Consul Dickenson at Nottingham, Eng-
land, on the cheese imports of Great Britain
which contains an extract from a recent review of the
subject by the London Tames to the effect that in 1893
the United States and Canada together furnished that
country with 80 per cent of the imported cheese, and
in 1897 over 8* per cent; but whereas in 1893 Canada
sent a little over 50 per cent and the United States
something more than 29 per cent, in 1897 the Canadian
trade had risen to more than 58 per cent and that of
the United States had fallen to but little over 24 per
cent.
The Consul accompanied the report with a state
ment that he had been advised by dealerr in Great
Britain that the discrepancy between the increased
percentage of Canadian cheese imports into England
and the decrease in the imports from the United
States "has been wholly brought about by American
shippers, who persisted in sending to this market a
product known as 'filled cheese.' American cheese
to a very considerable extent is therefore under a ban
in this country."
The report was sent from the State Department to
the dairy division of the Bureau of Animal Industry
with a request for an explanation of the alleged ex
ports of filled cheese, and in return a reply was re
ceived to the effect that the evil of filled cheese be
came so great a few years ago that in 1896 Congress
enacted a law regulating the manufacture and sale of
the article. This act is now well enforced, and the
Dairy Bureau reports "the filled cheese frauds have
been practically terminated and the reputation of
American cheese has been improving." As an il
lustration of the effect of the law, statistics are given
of the total exports of American cheese to all coun
tries, showing that while in 1896 these amounted to
but 36,777,291 pounds, they increased under the new
regulations to 50,944,617 pounds in 1897.
These reports show in a striking manner the evils
of adulterated food exports and the benefits of en
forcing stringent laws to prevent such adulterations.
While the practice of sending abroad filled cheese was
permitted the whole cheese trade of the country suf
fered. Our 9airy products were being driven out of
the best market in the world by Canadian products,
and that simply because of the dishonesty of a few
exporters. The Government interfered and at once
our trade began to revive. The cost of inspection has
been more than counterbalanced by the increased
trade and higher prices, and the future promises even
better results.
With this showing of the result of an experiment
on a large scale with pure food laws there ought to
be no further questioning of the advisability of such
laws. What has been done for the dairymen ought
to be done for all producers of genuine goods. This
is particularly true of the producers of fruit, wine and
oil products. In no other trade is there so much adul
teration, and in none are the adulterations so difficult
to be discovered by the consumer. A comprehensive
law on the subject should be enacted by Congress and
it should be made to apply to the home market as
well as to that of foreign countries. Business re
quires it and honesty and justice demand it.
This is a big country. It can conduct a foreign war
and a great exposition at the same time and make
successes of both.
AN AUSTRALIAN LAUREL WREATH.
ThÂ© first important engagement of the
Spanish-American war has been a naval
conflict. This much was expected, though
it was naturally supposed that the West
Indies and not the East would be the
scene of the encounter. Of the two fleets
which fought at Manila, it has always
been recognized that the American,
though far inferior in numbers, was the
more effective squadron. It had at least
two heavily armed modern steel-built
cruisers. The Spanish vessels were mostly
wooden and antiquated, and the two Els
wick vessels which were engagedâ the Isle
de Cuba and the Isle de Luzon-were lit
tle more than gunboats. The eight-inch
guns carried by the American vessels for
which the Spaniards had no equivalent
whatever, will probably be found to have
played a great part in the action But
apart from this, the triumph of America
at sea is expected because of the faith put
in the British stock. The best race will
employ the best vessels and the best guns
but the battle is ultimately won by the
brains in the conning tower and by the
determination and discipline of the men
when stripped at quarters. From Paul
Jones to Farragut, the Americans have
produced great commanders whenever the
occasion offered, and there is no reason to
suppose that there will be any lack of
dash and daring to-day.
In this last instance, the Pacific squad
ron flying the stars and stripes followed
the true British tradition when it sought
the enemy in its harbor, forced the entry
to the port, fought the foe under cover of

GIRL DO?

yesterday afternoon In company with !
her aunt, when Edwin Stevens, Tommy
Leary and George Lask came down Eddy

then the following scene was enacted for

Stevens advanced briskly toward the

upon she was confronted by Leary, who,

around the waist with his good right arm
and with a "Pardon me. miss, may I have |

began to waltz with the now thoroughly ;
surprised lady, and div not desist until

catching the countenance of Louise in
both hands, he administered a kiss on
her ruby lips that could be heard two
blocks away. He vanished before the ob

her delicate fist, and not knowing what
might happen next Louise said to her
aunt, "This is too warm a corner for me;
lft up move up the street," which they did
forthwith. They had not walked far

THE USE OF CAVALRY
In the old days troops wore safe when
held in reserve 500 yards back of the fight
ing line. Now for 2500 yards behind this
line the ground is torn by bullets. Con
sequently troops are held 3000 yards back,
and even at this distance there will be oc
casional casualties. To take part in an
engagement the reserve force must be
moved through this wide and dangerous
zone. Infantry cannot do it In less than
twenty-five minutes, and another ten min
utes will be used hi getting them into
his batteries and gave apparently a good
account of one and all. There were no
Ironclads engaged on either side, so that
as a naval engagement the affair ha.Â« not
the importance of the Yalu fight, in which
the Chinese had two magnificent line of
battleships in actionâ ships which steamed
back after the destruction of their con
sorts, shaking off the victorious foe. The
Spanish account, that the American loss
has been too heavy for the advantage to
be followed up. may be correct. But. after
making all deductions, the American ex
ploit remains a splendid instance of the
dash and courage of the race. The fleet
encountered a force superior in numbers,
covered by gains and possibly protected
by mines, and it fought far away from
succor, and where, in the absence ot de
pots and of coal, defeat meant destruc
tion. The incident will test the morale of
the Spaniards, and their friends will hope
that their Cuban fleet will fight its en
gagement before the catastrophe is heard
of. On the other hand, it must further
assure the confidence of the Americans
that they share with Great Britain the
command of the main. The spirited verses
in "Oriel" the other day may be quoted
as poetic prophecy:
"Up spake the voice of Hawkins bold
from his couch in the ocean bed.
Off coast from Porto Rico fair, and these
are the words he said:
'Now, Francis Drake, be of right good
cheer, for the men who to-day fight

Are the selfsame breed as thou and Iâ
so turn to thy rest again." "

six minutes. The rapidity with which
their range alters makes them n difficult

dering and swift advance is great. It is
estimated that the cavalry loss in a
charge should not exceed one-third of the
infantry loss. American military men of
the more advanced kind expect service of

PRIZE MONEY TO SEAMEN.
It is a debatable question whether prize
money to officers and crew of national
vessels should ceuse to be paid and that
our soldiers at sea should be placed- on
the same footing as land soldiers who
fight either for patriotism, for the lust
of fighting or for $13 a month, and ra
tions.
William H. Hunt. Secretary of the
Navy, recommended in a letter to Con
gress In 1882, that prize money in the
navy be abolished "as a relic of the loose
and barbarous customs of the old buc
caneers." He suggested that the entire
proceeds of all captures should go to the
navy pension fund, instead of the half
as heretofore. The House Committee on
Naval Affairs recommended the passage
of a bill to the above effect, but it failed
to pass, and Jack at sea has still the
incentive of prospective prize money to
enter the navy. . â 
In a war like the present one, prizes will
not be very plentiful, as Spain's merchant
marine, small as it is as a whole has

â dl"..d 1 ".. the J ast days of October, 17M, four
British frigates, the Ethalion, Naiad
Alcmene and Triton, while on a cruise in
the Bay of Biscay, discovered and chased
two Spanish frigates, one of which the
metis, was captured by the Ethalion. and
found to have 1,411,250 pieees-of-eipiv,.
(bpanish dollars) and a quantity of cocoa
"ii board The other, named the Santa
Bngida, had on board 1,400,000 pieees-of
eight and a cargo valued at a like amuunt
and was captured the following day by
the other three frigates, the total loss to
the British being one killed and ten
wounded, and the Spanish three killed and
seventeen wounded. A Spanish squadron
came out of Vigo Bay while the Santa
Brigida was being captured, but retreated
before the inferior force.
Two days later the frigates arrived at
Plymouth with their prizes, and an im
promptu procession was formed to con
vey the treasure taken in the two Span
ish ships to the vaults of the citadel It
took sixty-three artillery wagons to trans
port the treasure. As the procession
passed through the market-place, during
a temporary halt, a gentleman pushed
forward To see how the Spanish dollars
were packed. The sailor in charge, carry
ing the British ensign over the Spanish
asked: "If his honor wished to smell
at the treasure," to which the reply was
that: "He would much rather taste it "
Th.- sailor immediately putting his fingers
in his mouth pulled out a small Spanish
gold coin and a quid, and putting both in
the gentleman's hand, said: "In my coun
try we find tasting better than smelling
and feeling is the naked truth, so your
honor Is welcome."
In the latter part of November . the
treasure was taken to London escorted by
seamen and Surrey Dragoons. It was met"
by a band of music, battalions of the
guards and grenadiers and passed along
Piccadilly, St. James street. Pall M;ill
Strand, Fleet street and Cheapside to the
Bank. The Lord Mayor and other high
dignitaries reviewed the procession and
treated the sailors. . -.
The result of these captures' netted- to
the British Government a tine hew frigate,
as the Thetis was oh her- first voyage
when captured, and the prize money "was
distributed as follows:
Captains, each .' $203,654 50 "
Lieutenants, each... 25,456 81
Warrant officers, each. 12,342 69 â¢
Midshipmen, each 3,958 75^
Seamen and marines, each.. 302 19l|
An occasional capture like those related
brought more sailors into the navy than
all the press gangs combined; and Jack
of to-day who has heard or read of old
time wars hopes for similar luck.

OUR SPLENDID TROOPS.
When a European nation tftarts In to re
arm its soldiers, two or three years are
given to the work. To a nation that has
been at peace for thirty years the arming
and equipment of 125.000 soldiers is not
three months. As a rule we do things
faster than they do them in Europe, but
it is too much to expect that wo can call
into existence a large army and put mod
ern rifles in the hands of the men in a
few days.
A prominent British statesman Is on
record as saying that, if a sudden call
came upon England to mobilize her army,
not more than 40,000 effective men witb
full train could be put in the. field within ;
two weeks. The United States has, .in:
three weeks, concentrated- her. regular .. .
army, and has put into camp 100.060 yol- : .
unteers. An English correspondent, writ
ing from Tampa to the London. ;' .Marl.. ...
says that the troops in camp at. Tampa.
and Chickamanga, regulars and . volun
teers, "are splendid fellows, lithe, active.
soldierly in every movement. They much
resemble our Australian troops, but hav'a
more professional style. The light caval
ry are especially impressive. They axe
wdl-horsed. and sit like centaurs." This -^
Englishman declares that we have mada
most astonishing progress. He probably
knows more about such things than the
newspaper strategists who have not been

The muster rolls of the Seventh
California, First Colorado and Tenth

went to Colonel McClure, chief pay
master, yesterday. The Pennsyl
vania arid Colorado troops will be
paid to-day, having been selected to
sail for Manila next week.
The commands so far designated for
the second expedition to the Philip

Battalion of the Eighteenth United
States. Infantry, the First Battalion of
the Twenty-third United States Infan

General E. S. Otis that Captain

The Quartermaster's Department of
the United Steates Government has
made one record in this war which may
never be obliterated. One hundred and
fifty mules were obtained in Baltimore
recently and shipped to San Francisco
to supply the army needs of this de
partment. Each mule of the lot deliv
ered in San Francisco cost the Govern
ment $231, a sum sufficient to purchase
three good, serviceable mules in this
city. It is said that the mules were not
taken out of the cars for exercise dur
ing: the trip across the continent and
were so badly Jammed in transit that
many of them will not be able to work.
NEXT TUESDAY OR LATER.
Orders for the Next Expedi-
tion Somewhat Indefinite.
Influence Invoked.
As published in yesterday's Call, an or
der was issued from headquarters late
Thursday night indicating that the troops
that arc to go on the next expedition to
Manila should be ready by next Tuesday.
A copy of the order was sent to the
various commands that will compose the
expedition. The order instructed the dif
ferent commanders to be ready to sail
by Tuesday or later. It is hardly possible
that the expedition will sail by Tuesday,
THE B&K FRAKCISCO CAT.L,, SATURDAY, Jt^E 4, 1898.
and It Is believed that the day was
named purely for the purpose of hurrying
up the supplies of the troops that are to
go. The expedition, however, may sail
the latter part of next week, and possibly
not before the first of the week following.
The slate made by headquarters on
Thursday night of the troops to go next j
comprised the First battalions of the
Twenty-third and Eighteenth Infantries,
the Engineer Corps, the Tenth Pennsyl
vania Volunteers, the First Colorado Vol
unteers and a battery of the Third Artil
lery.
The First Battalion of the Twenty-thrid
Infantry is composed of E, F, H and D
companies, and will be commanded by
Lieutenant-Colonel French. The First of
the Eighteenth Infantry comprises Com
panies A. B. E and G, and is under the
command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bailey. |
The order to prepare for embarkation
etates that supplies and subsistence for
Blx months, with 400 rounds of ammuni
tion, will be carried by the expedition.
This same order regarding supplies ap
plies to the other commands that are to
go.
The two battalions of regulars will be
composed of old soldiers, the other com
panies of the two regiments having b*en
drawn upon to furnish seasoned and well
drilled men. This leaves the Eighteenth
and Twenty-third, with one skeleton and
one new battalion to recruit, which they
will no doubt shortly accomplish , as 850
recruits are on their way here from the
East to join these commands.
ihe Furteenth Infantry is rapidly filling
its ranks, Â«>o that In all probability the
three battalion.-; will sail together on the
third expedition.
Yesterday afternoon a change was made
tn the selection of troops that arc to go.
It wan reported upon the very highest
authority thnt one or both of the Utah
Light batteries would be substituted for
the < 'nrps of Engineers. Captain Young,
the senior officer in command of the bat
teries, admitt'-d that he was hopeful of
going to Manila, hut he refused to dis- j
cuss the orders that he received late yes- |
terday afternoon. Captain Longfltt of the
Corps of Engineers stated that he had
heard his corps was to give way to the
FIRST INFANTRY REGULARS.
Colonel Evan Miles,
First United States Infan
try, is now in camp with
his regiment at Port Tam
pa, but the command may
at any hour be ordered
forward to occupy an im
portant position on the
Island of Cuba. Colonel
Miles fully appreciates the
many kindly recognitions
and the cheering- courtesies
which the people of San
Francisco have bestowed
on his regiment. The
troops of the First Infantry
were stationed in Califor
nia for twelve years prior
to their departure to the
front, and the regiment is
therefore composed large
ly of Californians. The Col
onel desires the fact to be
made known to the pro
gressive and patriotic citi
zens of this State that the
men of his regiment would
be happy to receive con
tributions of magazines or
other interesting reading
matter. The contributions
should be sent to the "First
Regiment of Infantry,
Regulars," Port Tampa,
Fla.
light batteries, but yesterday he had re
ceived no official notification to that ef
fect, and he declined to discuss the mat
ter further than to state what he had
heard. There seems to be no doubt, how
ever, that the engineers will remain, for
the corps has only sixty men. and it
should be recruited up to Its maximum
strength, which is 150 men.
The First Colorado and Tenth Pennsyl
vania were Inspected In heavy marching
order yesterday by Colonel Hughes and
Captain Mallory. These two regiments
will certainly go on the next expedition,
and the quartermaster's department has
orders to stop everything else so as to
have these two commands in readiness
by Tuesday. â 
There Is a suspicion that political wire
pulling is having much to do with the
troops that s corn.pose the second expedi
tion, and open expressions are to be
heard among the officers .of the regi
ments that remain regarding this sub
ject. - â  â â¢ - -â ; " â  â â â â -â â â : â  'â â :'-â - â  . -â -:/
The Thirteenth Minnesota and Seventh
California regiments and the two . Idaho
battalions are anxious to go on- the next
expedition, as is also the First Nebraska,
and each of the commanders of these dif
ferent liodies of troops will bring aa the
influence they possess to bear upon Gen
eral Merritt with a view of having their
regiments selected to compose a part of
the next expedition. The First Nebraska
will be Inspected in heavy marching or
der by Captain Mallory this morning, and
it is thought by many of the volunteer
officers that Colonel Bratt's regiment will
be included among the troops going next
week to Manila.
The Catholic Truth Society erected a
large tent at Camp Merritt yesterday,
next to the Idaho troops, for the purpose
of holding services. To-morrow Father
Yorke will have low mass at 7:30 o'clock
for the soldiers desiring to take com
munion, and at 11 o'clock he will hold

ANOTHER TROOP SHIP.
The Steamer Centennial Arrived From Seattle Yesterday and Will Bo
Added to the List of Troop Ships To-Day. She Has Accommoda
tions for 680 Soldiers, but as They Are Not Up to the Standard
the Chances Are That the Present Bunks Will Be Torn Down and
the Vessel Fitted Out in the Same Way as the Zealandia.
Overhauling Troopships Im
properly Fitted Up for
Service.
The Vessels Must Conform to the Plans
of the Australia and
Zealandia,
The steamer Centennial arrived from
Seattle yesterday and will dock at Fol
som-street wharf to-day to get ready
for her trip to Manila. According to
the agents of the vessel, she is ready
to go out with 680 soldiers as soon as
the stores have been put aboard. The
chances are, however, that she will be
delayed several days, as the army au
thorities contemplate making a number
of changes in her accommodations.
The Centennial was built in 1539, and
was then known as the Peninsular and
Oriental steamship Delta, Being a
roomy ship she was employed for a.
number of years in carrying coolies
from port to port on the Chinese coast.
Later she was sold to the Nippen Yusen
Kaisha Company of Japan and her
name was changed to the Takasago
Maru. She was employed in carrying
contract laborers between Yokohama
and Honolulu for some time and dur
ing the Chinese-Japanese war she car
ried troops up and down the coast of
Japan for that Government. When
running to Honolulu she carried 1200
Japanese each trip, and on one occa
sion she carried 1500 soldiers on the
coast.
From the Japanese flag the vessel
was changed to the Danish and was
given the name which she now bears.
She was brought to Victoria, B. C, and
there fitted out for the Klondike trade.
At that time the rush via Dyea and
Skaguay was at its height and on one
occasion the Centennial carried as
many as 685 gold-hunters to the north.
She is a good stout vessel of 1287 tons
net burden, 324 feet long, 35.6 feet broad
and 30.5 feet deep.
In the matter of accommodation for
the troops, the Centennial is away be
hind either the Australia or the Zea
landia. On the latter vessels ea<h sol
dier has a separate berth, which he
can enter and leave at pleasure, but
on the Centennial the men must be
crowded into all kinds of holes and
corners, and as many as twelve bunks
are fixed into a small square space that
would ordinarily accommodate six.
There is an entrance to the bunks from
three sides, so that the four men at the
head and the four men at the foot can
crawl into the space allotted to them
without much trouble. The four men
in the center, however, have to get
into their beds the best way they can,
and that means that they must, crawl
over each other. These bunks are all
three tiers high, bo that thirty-six sol
diers will be squeezed into- a. space
which eighteen men would consider .
meager. â¢ "
In one or two favored spdts the ven
tilation is good, but wind sails will have
to be uesd freely in the tropics or
otherwise the soldiers will smother.
The Centennial has a fine flush upper
deck, however, and in the tropics the
soldier boys will be able to bring their
blankets up and sleep under awnings â 
in the open air. She is. also fitted with ":
an electric light plant and the men's
quarters will be well lighted through
out during the tropical nights..
The army authorities are going to
thoroughly overhaul the vessel] Major.
Long and the Medical Board will go
ovrr her to-day and will see ttiat the
accommodations conform with the cu
bio air ordinance. Supervising Inspec
tor of Hulls and Boilers Bermingham
and his. assistants will go over the
steamer and see that she conforms to
all the requirements .of law and a
board of naval officers will see to it
that she is fit to act as a United States
troop ship. After inspecting the Cen
tennial Major Long will visit the Colon
and China at the Mail dock, and the
Zealandia at Pacific street wharf and
they also wfll be passed upon by thu
different boards of officers.
The Colon was to have been fitted
out in a somewhat similar manner to
the Peking and Sydney, but the work
on her was stopped and she will now
be fitted out like the Zealandia, with
the Turner patent bunks. These all
have iron frames and wire woven mat
tresses. When not. in use they can be
folded up in a few minutes and turned
into settees upon which the soldiers
can sit or lounge at pleasure.
"The Zealandia is splendidly fitted
out for carrying troops," said Major
Long yesterday. "The patent bunks
with which she is fitted are the best
things of the kind I have seen, and I
have ordered the contractors to work
night and day in order to get a supply
of them ready. The chances are that
after the inspection to-day the Centen
nial will be fitted out with them and
nil the vessels that will be chartered
by the Government in the future vill
have them put in. In order that noth
ing that wilt go toward making the sol
diers comfortable during their voyage
should be overlooked, I asked for the
appointment of the Medical Board to
examine the sanitary conditions of all
the troop ships before they leave port.
My request was granted andnow every

WHEELING TOUR
THROUGH
LAKE AND NAPA.
Just at this season of the year a great
many wheelmen are contemplating the
trip through Napa and Lake counties,
and the following letter sent to The Call j
by a subscriber who has just been over ;
the trip will therefore prove quite ,
apropos:
.' Callfornian wheelmen who are familiar with
the topography of the State often concede to
Its * northern -particularly to Lake :
Countyâ superiority In the matter of
food roads, accommodations and varied scen
ery. As these are really the essentials to an ;
enjoyable tour, last May, with a friend, I took
a spin through a portion of/ that particular ter- i
ritory and a most enjoyable time It proved. â¢
Though there were no sensational Incidents. 'â 
others may profit a trifle by our experiences. |
Napa was chosen as the point from whlcn
to begin the trip proper, and leaving this city j
by an early train we were awheel by 10 o'clock.
We took the road running north, which paral
lels the railroad track, and passing through |
splendidly cultivated land, we reached sue- !
cessively Yountvllle, Oakvllle, Kutherfora.
Vlneland and eventually St. Helena, where we :
halted for lurch. This la a run of about .
eighteen miles, and not only was the road
In excellent condition and the scenery very i
prettily pastoral, but the light breeze made '
the riding most enjoyable. After lunch we |
went on toward Callstoga. The road here is i
level and In first-rate condition, especially after i
leaving Walnut Grove. The run to Callstoga is '
easily done in an afternoon, and here wÂ« !
found comfortable quarters for the night.
We had decided to go tÂ« the Clear Lake re
gion, as there Is a choice of routesâ the one [
leading through the Geysers and Cloverdale, ,
and- the other by way of Mount St. Helena,
we chose the latter, though It is a trifle longer, ;
but we were well repaid for our trouble. This j
road leads across Cobb mountain and past Mid- j
dletown. Just after passing this picturesque :
town there is a succession of scenery, which
for panoramic effect is not equaled in Xapa ;
County; Indeed, it Is rarely surpassed any
where In the State. In fact, right on to liar- ,
bins, Adams Springs and Qlenbrook the pano- J
THE CRACK TENNIS PLAYERS WHO FIGURE IN BIG TOURNAMENTS.:
rama. Is almost perfect. By noon we had reach
ed Kelseyville. and after a short rest pushed
on steadily for Highlands, where we Intended
to spend the night. This was done easily, and
the roads continuing to be good and the at
mosphere delightful, we congratulated our
selves on the choice of routes made. The
forty-eight miles' run from Cnllstoga had been
done In very good time and â  with no unneces
sary exertion.
Next morning-, not too early, we turned our
faces toward Lakeport, where we found our
selves shortly after noon, and making only
a brief stay, went on toward the Upper Lake.
This Is a fair three hours' ride over decently
food roads, and on arrival there we had a
choice of spending the night at either Blue
Lake or Saratoga, there being- but a -mile and
a half between the two places. After enjoy
inK the scenery for a while we decided on Sar
atoga, and got there In good time for dinner.
The road leads Into a broad and well-wooded
canyon a half mile up which we found the
hotel. There are any number of excellent
short rides in this vicinity, and as a matter of
fact we found It convenient to make It our
headquarters for a couple of days. It Was the
Intention to have reached the city on the
fourth' day after starting, but the vicinity of
the Lakes is very fascinating to the cycler who
has time to spare... '
Returning we took the road to Uklah, past
Laurel Dell and Blue Lakes. As far as Blue
Lake the road is excellent and quite level, but
It is somewhatâ though not veryâ hilly beyond.
The scenery is delightful all the way, and a
pleasanter round trip it is scarcely possible
to conceive.
On the route described, the stopping places
are so well arranged that there Is not the
slightest necessity for making a labor out of
a (ipln for pleasure. The roads are very good
Indeed and the mountain air is delicious. Those
who have more time will find any number of
places to take up temporary headquarters from
where a number of interesting dally runs in
the vicinity of the lakes . can be made much
In the same way as we did at Saratoga. It
Is in point of fact quite a little paradise for
the cyclist.
I would recommend that any one making
this beautiful trip should first provide him
self with one of the Associated Cycling Clubs'
â  road books and membership cards. The for
mer gives explicit directions and distances.*
and the latter saves money In hotel bills by
reason of the discounts allowed C. A. C. C.
members.
The regular monthly meeting of the
California Associated Cycling Clubs will
be held this evening at 8 o'clock at the
rooms of the Olympic Club Wheelmen on
Post street. The most Important subject
to come before the board of governors
will be the changing of the date of the
annual twenty-mile race, which usually
takes place In July. It will probably be
put off until September. *
Captain Coulter has called a moonlight
run of the California Cycling ,Club for
this evening, leaving the club rooms at
8:30 p.m. at Twenty-second and Folsom
streets. At the destination, the beach, a
clambake has been arranged. Charles J.
Birdsall and Thomas H. White have been
appointed lieutenants by Captain Coulter.
Four members of the Callfornias left for
Manila on the Peking recently, among
whom was John F. Burke, ex-captain,
and once very prominent In L. A. W. af

Captain H. Goetz has called .a run of

The Cycle Baseball League is ended for
the season. The proposed final game be
tween the Bay City Wheelmen and the
Olympic Cyclers, scheduled for to-mor
row, is off, owing to the inability of the
Olympics to get together a team, as some
of their men are out of town now. An
they had an unbroken record of victories
over all the other clubs except the Bay
Cities, the managers of these two clubs,
both so friendly to each other, were loth
to bring them together, as many a friend
ship is severed over the result of an ama
teur ball game. So it waa finally decided
to concede the championship to the Olym
pic Cyclers and to arrange another league
for next winter, with the games confined
to three months.
The San Francisco Road Club's ball
team wants to play the team of any of
the Kastern soldier companies now en

to that effect, the proceeds to go to the

ALL ABOUT DOGS
AND THEIR OWNERS.
The San Francisco Kennel Club has
filed a complaint with the American Ken
nel Club accusing J. B. Martin of mis
conduct In connection with dogs and dog
shows. The complaint will be heard at
the next meeting of the executive board,
and Interesting developments may be
confidently awaited. At the recent quar
terly meeting of the A. K. C. two decis
ions affecting this coast were arrived at.
The action of President Belmont in sus
pending and afterward reinstating the
Pacific Mastiff Club was approved and
confirmed.
In the matter of Wade Collins, con
victed and suspended on his own con
fession for fraud in connection with the
pedigree of a St. Bernard pup, a petition
for his reinstatement was forwarded by
the St. Bernard Club of California, bear
ing also the indorsement of four mem
bers of the Pad Ho Advisory Board. In
view of the strong petition it was decided
to condone Collins' offense and to cancel
his unexpired suspension.
An application was received from Web
ster Jones of San Francisco asking that
the club rescind the suspension of his
famous setter dog Count Harold, which
he bought some time ago from H. T.
Payne. Payne was suspended last year
for making some libelous charges against
James Mortimer, the judge at the Oak
land show, which charges Payne after
ward refused or was unable to substan
tiate. Of course all Payne's dogs were
sharers in the suspension, and now Mr.
Jones, who bought the Count in good
faith naturally wants the suspension re
moved. The A. K. C. however refused to
accede to the request until Payne is
purged of his disability.
Emmett Sullivan of Menlo Park is ap
parently determined to be known as the
most versatile of our fanciers. He has
lately acquired one of the finest fox ter

tion over next season's circuit.
LATEST NEWS
OF THE
NATIONAL GAME.
BY JOE CORBETT.
Some one, who evidently did not know
what he was talking about, gave to the
sporting editor of the Post an article
claiming that some of the managers were
not pleased with the work of Joe Staple
ton, the official scorer. This statement
is very untrue. No one has complained,
and no one can complain, as Mr. Staple
ton, when it comes to scoring a baJl game,
has not a superior in the business. I have
hud occasion to go over the work of many
"star" knights of the score book, during
my brief sojourn in the major league, and
have yet to find the man that caJi out
score "delicate Joe." When the Balti
mores and All Americas played here some
few months ago the players were aston
ished to find a man keeping score who
was so perfectly posted in the art of sep
arating base hits from errors and who
had such a knowledge of baseball in gen
eral. Many a flattering compliment waa
paid "Sir" Joseph's ability, especially by
the Baltimore players, who during the
championship season back East never let
a game pass without a tilt of some sort
with the scorers. This little incident in
itself would be sufficient to secure for Joe
a life position on Nick Young's staff, as
there never was a complaint In any shape,
manner or form entered against his work
by these experts while here. These facts
alone demonstrate Joe's proficiency to
properly take care of his work, and the
rumor that some one was displeased no
doubt originated from some player who
should first learn how <o play baseball be
fore attempting to criticize the work of
Mr. Stapleton.
Ab a warning to other players, Mr. Pyne
has been suspended for thirty days. Such
is the punishment Inflicted on a player
who, being unable to secure his release
on his own say so, resorted to work which
he now undoubtedly realizes was not the
"proper caper," so to particularize. Had
It been possible to have given Mr. Pyne
thirty days In the "old ladies' home," no
one doubts for a second that Manager
Coffroth would have done so. But it Is
not always best to go to the extreme in
matters so "separating," and as "Hand
some" James had the unadulterated pleas
ure of planting his hard right on Mr.
Pyne's left optic after the game at San
Jose, it is hardly to be wondered at that
he should feel avenged, and at the same
time contented, over the way things have
terminated. The trouble, as I now under
stand it, after making a few "feints" and
"side steps," while perambulating in the
"terrible" Pyne's presence, came about a.s
all such trouble does. Mr. Pyne, after
signing with the San Franciscos, received
a very flattering proposition from the San
Jose management. "They offered me a
position," says Pyne, "at $6<T per month,
outside of my share coming from the ball
games, and those 'guineas.' Coffroth and
Bunker, would not 'cut the wire and
leave me to myself.
"My persuasive powers being on the
'dink' ever since I made that home run at
Central Park, led me to the conclusion
that there was but one way of my sep
arating myself from that "sausage
grower,' Bunker, and 'Cigar Indian Cof
frothâwho, by the way, reminds me of
a piece of 'chilled iee 11 â and that way was
by ceasing to interview the ball when it
came into my territory. The scheme
worked like Murphy's throwing . arm
sort of 'icecreamedly'â but I neglected to
use a little 'discreth,' and they rung the
curtain down on me amid an avalanche
of 'noise,' which sounded something like
steam oozing out of an engine whose pipes
were a trifle to the leeward. It's all right
though. I'll be in the game again, and
when I do steal in those 'guys' who have
been awarded a 'blue ribbon' for develop
ing 'knotty chests' will sink into a state
of obligation (oblivion) when they get a
tintype of my expansion."
"So there's nothing I could do for you,
Mr. Pyne, such as placing your case be
fore the strategy board?"
"Not a thing, old man. I met my
Manila through the efforts of that
board, but on the 'perpendicular'
'Dewey' really gets another crack at
the game. If they telegraph you for re
inforcements tell them 'I forgive,' but
don't mention it in the same sentence
with the thirty days. It might resurrect
old thoughts, and the 'Old Ladies'
Horne 1 is a trifle high-priced during
theÃe dull times. Say! Just a minute. I
voted for 'prosperity' and this is what
I gets. I have been given the 'keen'
overlook by those 'magets,' Bunker and
Coffroth. and now my 'old college chum'
McKinley has wiped the dust off that
'old prosperity talk ot bis,' and It la
simply awful to penetrate. No matter,
there's the recruiting office across the
street. Good-by." From Mr. Pyne's de
meunor it was easily apparent that while
a trifle chagrined over the turn in affairs,
he still clung to the hope that all would
soon be forgotten. He admits that he
was in t he wrong, and being a fair player
it wou}d not be such an awful breach of
"diamond etiquette" for the officials of
the league to be lenient with him If
his sentence should be cut in two it is
certain that the effect on other offend
ing players would not be diminished by
the move.
The most important point developed in
Mr. Pyne's case lies in the right of one j
manager to offer inducements to a j
player already the property of another
club. If the San Jose management knew
that Pyne signed a San Francisco con- i
tract and then made overtures to him,
they should be more severely dealt with :
than Mr. Pyne. His idea was all right,
but the action was very wrong. A player
cannot lie blamed for endeavoring to bet
ter himself, but in so doing he should be i
discreet. Pyne, on rinding he could not
secure his release, should have let the i
matter drop. However, from what I can
learn of the case, the real "villain" be
longs in San Jose. He started things a
rolling by not minding his own affairs,
and it is certain had he not made over- !
tures to Pyne the trouble never would
have occurred. As it is, Pyne's sentence,
â while a just one, should be cut in two, I
and the matter patched up. Not, how- ;
ever, without first giving other players to
understand that the next case will be the
last
The game to-day is between the Fresno j
"Tigers" and the San Jose "Lions." If
names go for anything, a tierce game may I
be expected. It is assured, however, that :
the Fresno boys intend retrieving lost
laurels, and as McOucken Is not throw- ;
ing any games away, the contest will un
doubtedly contain some good baseball.
The line-up is as follows:
Fresno. San Jose.
McCue Catcher Kent

Moore Third base Weed
Courtney Short stop Brackhoff

RACKET
WIELDERS
IN THE COURTS.
The easy victory of the Hardys in the
interclub doubles tournament last Mon
day at Alameda shows the great
width of the breach between the
first and second class players now
actively engaged In wielding the
racket. In doubles there are really but
two first-class teams, the Whltneys and
the Hardys. The Whitneys refuse to play
under the banners of the California Ten
nis Club, and this practically leaves the
Hardys the unchallenged masters of the
situation.
The interclub schedule has not been
half completed, owing to our rainy Sat
urdays. Two matches will be played to
day at Oakland. The match originally
scheduled for this afternoon will he be
tween Holmes and Bowen of Alameda and
the Hardys of Oakland. The second
match which should have been played a
week ago will be between R. Nicholson
and E. Stone and Weihe and Adams. This
should be a clone contest with the San
Francisco team the favorites.
A great deal of discussion Is being had
by the tennis players in regard to the
new rule passed by the National Lawn
Tennis Association in regard to foot
faults. The old rule was supposed to pre
vent all overstepping of the base line be
fore the ball was served, but owing to the
ambiguity In which the rule was ex
pressed a player could on a flying start
still have one foot back of the base line
and his moving body well on the way
toward the net at the moment of serving.
The new rule reads: "The server shajl
stand with both feet behind, i. c., farther
from the net than the base line." This
will cause a great deal of trouble to the
umpires, and the players who will have
to change their style of serving. It will
especially affect the beet players who
have a perfected style of serving.
Some very good matches were played
during the week. For the first time slnca
the last championship games at San Ra
fael, George Whitney played a set with
Sumner Hardy. It was a very close
match, and was either man's until the
last, when Whitney won out. The score
was 6â4.6 â 4. Sam Hardy beat Joe Daily, Bâ6.
Daily had five games to Hardy's two and
forty love, and the Oakland crack played
the ball of his life, sweeping everything
before him. Sumner Hardy and George
Whitney beat Bradshaw and Robert N.
Whitney 6âl. Sumner Hardy and Rob

The attention of oarsmen and scullers Is
directed to the regatta to be held at El
Campo on June 26 and July 17. On the
first date the scullers will race and on
the second day the oarsmen. McAusland
has gone back to the Ariel Rowing Club,
and will wear Its colors at the regatta.
He will use a skiff specially built for him
by 11. B. Kennerson on the model of a
shell and much lighter than skiffs gene
rally are. His antagonist in the special
skiff race, A. W. Pape, is an excellent
swimmer, and, being fond of many forms
of outdoor excercise, neither a smoker
nor a drinker. Is always in good condition.
11. A. Wittkopf will represent the Ariels
In the shell race. If McAu.sland should
beat Pape at El Campo he may enter for
the shell race also.
The Ariels will hold their club regatta
on Sunday, June 12, when medals will be
offered for senior and junior scullers. The
senior skiff men ara Frank Wilson, Rob
ert Ellis and James Wilson. Frank Wil
son, the holder of the club senior sculls,
is taking daily exercise. The junior skiff
men are James O'Connell, C. McAullffe,
Archie Taylor, E. C. Stenberg, 11. A.
Pless and Andrew Carroll.
McAusland and 11. A. Wittkopf will
have a shell race on June 12. In the old
timers" race Flanders, Growney and
Stevenson will compete.

mtule up thus: William Howe, stroke;
Robert Ellis, afterwalst: E. McKenna,
forward waist; and John Fickert, bow, in
place of Joseph Hanna, The German
crew goes out under Batteaux's coaching.
It has been very enthusiastic and in prac
tice has been running away from the
other two junior crews, which are made
np as follows: Crew 1-A. Carroll, stroke-
Dan O'Connell, afterwaist; H. Witeon
forward waist; and Albert Carroll bow'
Dan O'Connell having met with an acci
dent to his foot his place was taken last
Sunday by Thomas Shirley. Crew 2 con-
Mists of K. Lynch, stroke; "F. L.oth. after
waist; J. Horton, forwardwaist; E Me-
Donough, bow.
Rodger?, the boat-builder, has begun
work upon the new barge for the Arlels
and says that he may have it ready for
the barge races at El Campo on July 17
She is being constructed on the same
lines as the barge recently built for the
Alameda Boat Club.
E. M. Garnett of Harvard College visit
ed the boathouse of the South End Low
ing Club last Sunday, and coached the
junior crew, consisting of C. Jenkins
stroke; C. Crelghton, afterwaist; Emii
Blumlein, forwardwaist; and J Bogan
bow. The new junior crew will probably
consist of William Barry, stroke; E. Blum
lein. afterwaist; C. Crefghton or J. Bogan
forwardwaist; C. Jenkins or C. Scull v'
bow. The senior crew Is not yet formed'
but the "Midgets" may take" in a new
man and fill up their crew. The Inter
mediate, or Irish crew, consists of W
Duplissea. stroke; Tom Lynch after
waist; George Bates, forwardwaist; and
Tom Lynch, bow.
The Dolphin Boating Club will hold Its
regular monthly meeting on June 8 when
officers for the season will be elected
Captain Kennedy says that he does not
wish to take the office again, and It is
possible that either A. W. Pape or W O
Patch will be chosen. The Junior barire
crew of the Dolphin Club is made up as
follows: A. W. Pape. stroke; Victor Cae
lieri, afterwaist; T. J. Hopkins, forward
waist; and E. J. Bartman, bow.

Any one of them that is capable of nego
tiating his initial course Is deemed more
valuable than a ' Spanish warship. ' Per

one course is sometimes capable of doing
something further. The features of â¢ the.

all-age class. At both parks the outlook
Is of a sunset hue. The dog owners arÂ»
overlooking no opportunities. . : â  .'.

second at $60 and. fourth at $20: And thÂ«
other two weeks she was resting.
, A 7 to 1 shot landed at Ingleside last,
week, and the talent stood agha's.t. It is
not infrequent that a short end. lands at
Ingleside. but two or three to one is usu
ally the extreme limit.
The running at Union Park to-day,
which should be of the hottest kind,
shows a trio of Merced. tlyers--Sunolite,
Johnny R and Mollle. All three are said
to have shown good work, but all three
are also up against hard game.

The Commissioners have stocked the
streams of the Yosemite with several
thousand fry of the Brown or Yon Behr
trout and ft is expected that a few
years hence those game fishes will give a
good account of themselves. The Brown
trout, as a lighter, Is as game as the
Rainbow, and frequently it will attack
other fishes In Its attempts to hold poÂ»-
Bession of a stream, but no anxiety need
be felt for the Rainbow because it is a
fish that is fearless and will not tolerate
an insult from an invader.
Tin- Dewey fly is the very latest thing
in -fishing tackle. John Benn Is the in-
I ventor. The fly is dressed this way: Tip
silver, tag red; tail red, white and blue;
body blue and red. ribbed with silver
cord; hackle, red, white and blue; wings,
white swan and scarlet ibis.
Although lly-fishing on the Truckee
river la yet below par, so to speak, still
anglers who reside near this beautiful
stream anticipate having pood sport in
the latter part of the month.
Latest intelligence from Dormer is to
the effect that fiy-fishing is now first
class, and many fine fishes are taken
daily by those who understand the art of
easting. Among the gentlemen who are
enjoying the sport are ex-Pish Commis
sioner Btnerte and John Elliott.
Messrs. 11. Â«'. Campbell, Don Y. Camp
b.-l) and John O. Cadman have just re
turned from a fishing trip to the Geysers,
They report trout fishing on the Big
Sulphur as unusually good this year, the
average catch being ovor 100 each for the
day.
THE STATE LIVE
BIRD TOURNAMENT
FOUR INTERESTING EVENTS AT
: . THE OLYMPIC GROUND.
Haight and Kibby Carried Off the
Honors as Well as the Money
on the Most Kills of the Day.
The State live bird tournament, held
under the auspices of the Olympic Gun
Club, began yesterday, at the grounds at
Ingleside and will continue to-day and to
morrow. The attendance was pood and
included several shotgun sharps from the
interior parts of the' State. Among these

V. iu;l::n, and I>ig'hton from near Los
Angeles. Merrill of Stockton and Fox and

-The day was perfect; In fact, too per
fect, there not being- enough wind to give
the :iiirÂ«is sufficient start to give snap to
the Occasion. The. birds, taken as a whole.
.â¢!â¢.â  fair, â  but nothing to brag about.
The shooters began banging away at the
live targets as early as 9 o'clock In the
li-.'-rniiiji, and.it -was 5 ! clock before the
\lajst'slio<; "V:ts llred. . .'.'â 
â  â  There' 'a -re four events on : the first
a^y's i*â  r.imme. â  The first was a six
btrd : race. $2 50 entrance, $10 added. In
this, as in all of the others, the high guns
took -trie 'â '. nione.y. Merrill, Jackson,
.-Vnughan,- Lejghton, Kibby. Haight and

tries, but the game uuickly narrowed
down to about seven or eight of the best
Phots, who ' agreed to increase the dis
tance to .32 yards, â  In order to make the
candltions more difficult: Even at this it
looked as. if the match would last all
night but on the eighth bird Nauman
broke and he was followed by Inglisbee
and Vaughan. This left Haight. Feud
ner, Burnett and Kibby, who decided to
divide the money and save time, birds
and ammunition. Each of the winners got
14250. During the day Haight and Kibby
only lost one bird each. The scores in
this event were as follows:
Faudner, 9; Nauman, 8; Merrill, 0; Rice. 0;
Haight, 9; Kibby, 9; Golcher, 5; Inglesbee, 8;
Fox, 6; Jones, 5; Vaughan, 8; Sears, 1; Bur

WITH THE FIGHTERS.
Interesting Boxing Bouts to Be
Pulled Off in the Near Future.
Tt is likely that the National Club will
match Young Peter Jackson, the hard
hitting welter-weight, who has ' been
looming up of late, and some other shifty
fighter in that class as a preliminary "go"
oh the evening of the McConnell-Mc-
Keever match.
L!i!ly Otts. the clever and stiff-punching
lightweight of the Excelsior Athletic
Club who earned a decision over Gran
of the Frisco Athletic Club some
weeks ago, will light Jack Ennis of the
r club eight rounds for a decision
re the Jefferson Athletic Club on
Tuesday evening next. The bout should
be extremely interesting, as Ennis will
try to win back the laurels lost by Gran
field. The latter's friends claimed that
he was done out of a decision, and since
then there has been bitter rivalry be
tween both organisations.
The San Francisco Athletic Club will
hold a feather-weight tournament in their
club rooms, 317 Sixth street, on Thursday
evening next. Great dissatisfaction arose
Â\-. r the outcome of the recent tourna
â  ment and many remarks of "I wish I had
â  hern in it" has prompted the directors to
give another such entertainment as the
last. There will be several new entries,
and all are fast. The entries include.
Charles Preese, W. Dirks, John Dean, M.
Davis, fi. Jackson, John Kane, Jami-s
Higgins, George Savage and \V. Quinn.
Bach winner of a bout will receive a
handsome go|d medal. These winners
i will then compete for the final medal,
\vhi<-h will contain a diamond and be
jryalued at $7R.

AN APPEAL TO WASHINGTON
ALLEGED TO CONFLICT WITH
THE TKEATY.
Sitxy-One Merchants Who Have Been
Refused a Landing TaKe the
Matter to the Secretary
of the Treasury.
The apparent conflict between the ex
clusion act of 1884 and the treaty made
In 1N94 between this country and China is
In a fair way of being settled within a
short time, an appeal based on that Issue
having been perfected and mailed to the
Secretary of the Treasury yesterday. The
decision of the Secretary on the matter
Will be fraught with great Importance to
the people of the Facirto Coast, who will
be more directly and injuriously affected
than the people of any other portion.
It Is believed that there la merit In the
appeal, that the decision will be In favor
of the petitioners and that the door will
be thrown wide open for the unrestricted
entrance of hordes of coolies under the
guise of merchants and traders. It is the
rule where two laws on the same subject
come in conflict to decide that the latter
law, if valid at all, supersedes the older
or such portions of the older as may con
fiiot with tho younger law.
The act of Congress of 1884 provides
that the certificates of admission on
which merchants or traders may be en
titled to enter this country shall state
the nature, character and estimated
value of the business of the applicant.
The treaty which was ratified and which
went into effect ten years aiter the going
into effect of the act of Congress ot ISS4
simply provides that the applicant shall
have "a certificate" with his name, de-
Bcription, age, etc., and the statement
that he is a merchant or trader. This
certificate must be signed by the Regis
trar General or Taotai, and vised by the
American Consul at the port of depart
ure.
The Treasury Department, of its own
motion, for the purpose of tnrowing the
proper safeguards against the entry of
OOOly labor Irom China, has added to the
requirements of the treaty the additional
requirement mentioned in tho act of ISS4.
It is contended by the Chinese applicants
that the Treasury Department has no
power, right or authority to amend the
treaty, â¢
Sixty-one Chinese who arrived on the
China and the Doric recently presented to
the Collector Canton certificates signed
by the Taotai and properly vised by the
American Consul at Canton, certifying
that they were merchants. The require
ments of the treaty were carried out In
every particular, but the requirement of
the act of ISM that the nature, character
and estimated value of the applicant's
j business should be stated was not cum
! plied with.
(.'..Hector Jackson, under the instruc
tions previously received from the Treas
ury Department, refused to allow the 01
merchants to land, on the ground that
the certificates did not comply with the
requirements of the statute of 18M. The
only authority to which an appeal ran
be made In case of the refusal of the Col
lector to allow Immigrants to land is the
Secretary of the Treasury, and from his
decision there can be no appeal.
The n applicants have made that ap
peal, and a decision i:< expected at an
early .lay. The Collector beUevw that
the appeal will be successful and that the
treaty will be held to have superseded
all laws and parts of laws in conflict
with It.
CUT RATES TO APPLY
BY WAY OF OGDEN
RIO GRANDE AND UNION PA
CIFIC GAIN THEIR POINT.
Southern Pacific Will Sell Second-
Class Tickets on the Rebate
Plan After June 0.
The Southern Pacific Company yester
day definitely announced that the same
reduction* in second-class rates via Mo
jave. El Paso and New Orleans which are
to go into effect on Sunday, June 3 will
also apply via Ogden on Wednesday,' June
9. They give as a reason for not putting
the rates in effect on the earlier date be
cause the Interstate Commerce Commis
sioners must receive three days' notice
When rates are reduced, and a* there are
Other minor details to be attended to,
therefore the rates via Ogden will appiv
..ii the 9th. This is the culmination of
extraordinary efforts on tHe part of the
I Oion Pacific and the Rio Grande ana
Western to persuade the Southern Pacific
to i.ill in line with the reductions first put
into effeot .some months ago by the Can-i
dian PadflQ and followed later by the
Oregon Railway and Navigation Com
pany, the Northern Pacific and the Great
Northern, who honk their passengers via
Portland. The Southern Pacific; Company
was slow to yield to the demand* of the
lines out of Ogden, but it has finally con
sented, and the result will be that the
major part of the second-class travel will
take the more direct route via Ogden at
the reduced rates. Tickets will be sold
ut present rates on the rebate plan- Kan
sas City $4v, rebate $8; Boston $67 80 re
bate (25 25; New York, JOB HO, rebate $23 95-
St. L,o\iis $47 60, rebate $10 50; Chicago
|53 SO, rebate $20.
It is generally believed that the South
ern Pacific Company decided to put the
rates in effect via Ogden only after it
was agreed by the other lines to allow the
division demanded by the Southern Pacific
Company as Its share of the haul to Og
dtii. <Â»n points east of the Missouri River
the local company will receive $11 80 and
to tin- Missouri River it will get the
regular id per cent of the rate.
For instance, the rate to Kansas City
is $:u. and the Southern Pacific Company
receiving 46 per cent wll make its division
$14 Â»;. This will leave but $16 74 to divide
between the lines out of Ogden and their
connections.
The Rio Grande brought all of Its per
suasive {lowers to bear, and the Union
Pacific kept the wires hot in an endeavor
to induce the Southern Pacific Company
to recede from a position which it was
claimed was an unjust one; but the local
officials were inexorable, and the South
ern Pacific, being the initial line, had the
advantage, and the rates went into effect
only after Its demands had been complied
with in every particular. As one dis
gruntled official expressed it, "they have
entered into a con/Act with their friendly
Eastern connections."
COMPENSATORY DAMAGES ONLY
California Navigation and Improve
ment Company Gets a New Trial.
The difference between compensatory
mid. rxomplary damages was a question
which wa* settled by the Supreme Court
in a decision handed In yesterday. The
case in which the court made itself clear
for the guidance of trial courts in the
future was that of Charles Trabing, a
minor, who sued through his mother, as
guardian, the California Navigation and
Improvement Company for $5000 damages
received by him from the captain of the
Mary Garratt, who placed him in irons,
with his arms around a stanchion, during
the voyage of that boat from Benicia to
Anttoch, for a period of three hours. The
cause which led up to this treatment was
that the captain accused the boy of not
paying his 50 cents for a passage from
Benicia to Stockton. The boy claimed that
he had paid his fare, and on the trial he
offered evidence In support of this claim,
which the jury evidently gave credence
to, aÂ« it* awarded him $2500 damages.
From this verdict the Navigation Com
pany asked for a new trial, which the
lower court refused to grant and from
which an appea.l was taken. The Supreme
Court, in reversing the action of the trial
court and granting the defendant a new
trial, did so on the fine point of what con
stitutes "compensatory" from "exem-
plary" damages.
After a general review of the case, the
court quotes a portion of the Judge's
charge and also a portion of that asked
by the defendant's attorney, but which
was refused by the trial court. That por
tion of the Judge's charge which the
upper court comments on Is as follows:
"Then I charge you, your verdict will be
in favor of plaintiff for such damages as
under all the circumstances of the case
disclosed by the evidence appear to be
just, not exceeding the Bum of $5000, the
sum demanded in the complaint." To this
the defendant's attorney asked that the
following be also given to the jury, but
tho Judjre declined: "I charge you that
in cases of this kind the plaintiff can re
cover only the actual damages suffered
by him. unless the master authorized the
commission of the act complained of or
participated therein, or ratified it after its
commission."
For this refusal the Supreme Court re
versed the verdict and granted a new
trial, holding that compensatory damages
in a case of this kind should prevail In
stead of exemplary damages, as were
given by the jury.
The evidence in the case as quoted In
the decision showed that it was the cap
tain himself who placed the irons on the
boy's wrists and who ordered him ashore
at Antioch at 3 o'clock in the morning
without a cent In his pockets or a friend
to appeal to.
MAN AND CASHBOOK
DISAPPEARED
MANAGER FOR J. L. VERMEIL
& SON IN CUSTODY.
Found Living Under an Assumed
Name and Arrested on Three
Charges of Embezzlement.
Henry Blume. manager for J. Tj. Ver
meil &. Son, Union-square Market, was
arrested yesterday afternoon by C. J.
Duncan, of Morse's Detective Agency and
turned over to the police. He was booked
at the City Prison on three charges of
felony embezzlement, the complaints hav
ing been sworn to before Judge Conlan
yesterday. In the complaints L.urae is
charged with embezzling $114 50, $139 and
$190.
Blume refuped to say anything and the
firm was equally uncommunicative, but
Captain Callundan of Morse's Agency is
authority for the statement that these
amount! do not represent the full extent
of the defalcations.
A few days ago Klume left the office to
go home on the pretext that he was sfek.
He did not return, and as the enshbook
could not be found it was suspected that
something was wrong. The c?ise was put
in the hands of Morse's Agoncy. and
every effort was made to rind Hlume and
recover the missing cashbook. Yesterday
Blume was traced to the Baldwin Hotel.
where he had been living under the name
of T. B. Wells. The cashbOOk has not
been found, and Blume refuses to say that
he knows anything about it. It is sup
posed that he has destroyed It to covtr
up his defalcations.

Position.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, June 3.â School Trustees
Kenyon, O'Brien, Graham and Lang
ford held a star chamber meeting this
morning in City Superintendent Rus
sell's office to consider the High School
difficulty. Principal Shumate and Pro
fessor Smith of the High School were
summoned before the body, and it is
said they and Superintendent Russell
were given some instructions and ad
vice, with the imperative command to
obey orders. The board decided to
take things into its own hands, regard
less of public opinion, and it was the
consensus of opinion of four trustees
that Vanderbllt's famous saying, "The
public be damned," be adopted as the
motto of the board.
A resolution was Introduced and
adopted declaring that the board would
act independent of all forcea, and so
notified the public, the Grand Army,
the students of the Hlph School and
the faculty. Trustee Kenyon prepared
the resolution, but he refused to per
mit any outsider to see the paper. Ken
yon said its substance was this:
The board intends to do as it pleases
In the matter; it wants no interference
from outside persons, either public.
Grand Army or students; that discip
line must be maintained, and Principal
Shumate is Instructed to straighten af
fairs in the school.
Principal Shumate and Professor
Smith were given to understand that
they must do better. They were in
structed to notify the students that no
interference in the affairs of the board
would be tolerated.
At the High School to-day all was
excitement. When Professors Shu-
I mate and Smith returned they sum
moned two classes at a time and told
them of their interview with the board.
That they addressed only two classes
at a time the students claim was due
to a desire to avoid a possible conflict
with the student body. As it was,
Professor Shumate and one of the pu
pils had a wordy dispute. Professor
Smith asked the students to abandon
i all further movements in his behalf.
I Orders have been issued forbidding any
! meeting of the student body of the
I school.
It leaked out to-day that at a meet
ing yesterday the students by unan
imous vote decided to strike unless
Professor Smith was reinstated next
Tuesday night. It is said they de
clared they would never return to
school unless Smith was employed aa
teacher. The students were warned to
day against talking about the affair
outside of the school.
Trustee O'Brien said to-day some
thing was radically wrong with the
school, and that an investigation would
probably be held. He said a great
deal of jealousy existed among the
teachers, and this would be "nipped
in the bud." Professor Smith would
undoubtedly be put back, and no appli
cations-for his place had been consid
ered.
Trustee Kenyon expressed about the
same opinion. He said the board
was determined to have the High
School conducted properly. He did not
propose to have the student body dic
tate to the trustees, and e\'9ry mem
ber of the faculty would be discharged
if necessary to break the backbone of
the student body. The trustees want
ed to conduct the school in the best
way, but did not want outsiders to med
dle with their affairs.
On every hand the Grand Army is
being highly complimented for unmask
ing this gang of political tricksters.
The High School affair is being dis
cussed everywhere, and nearly every
one is taking Professor Smith's part.
Says He Was not Insane.
Samuel T?. Hayes, a destitute and suf
fering piano-mover, who was recently re
leased from the Uklah asylum, has peti
tioned the Board of Supervisors for as
sistance on account of an unjust Impris
onment In the Insane asylum. On Septem
ber 11 Holm< s came before Judge Belcher
and was ordered to be sent to Uklah. The
Finance Committee has reported favor
ably on his case and referred it to the
Mayor.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
f : .NEW YORK, June 3.â Professional specula
tors on the bear side were very alerfc and ac- :
â¢ live to-day, attacking first one point and then
another of the list and keeping thÂ» stock mar
ket decidedly Unsettled. In the final hour there i
: 'was a move all along the line which effectu
ally broke prices, leaving only a few small
n>t gains in some of the low-priced stocks that
. had been pushed up in the earlier trading, in
all the prominent stocks, even Sugar which was '
â¢the leader of the market, gain* were practically I
wiped out, and In nine cases net losses amount !
'to over 2 points. The bear drive was accom- '
. pariled by considerable beating of tom-toms '
and a diffusion of rumors and ostentatious feats
of the effect of the Senate's vote for the coin- '
age of treasury silver.
The day's trading opened with the conditions
' in yesterday's market rather emphasized; that
is to say, with the high-priced dividend paying
stock showing some effects from profit taking,
and the middle and lower grade stocks were
â¢ .well supported â by nominal buying.
The profit taking in the recent leaders was
pretty wen absorbed, and .t was evident that
funds realized by Felling these stocks Instead
of being taken out of the market were- simply
being diverted into other stocks which have
not as yet advanced conspicuously In price
The realizing In the Grangers and some of the
high priced . specialties, however, caused them
, .to drop somewhat, and made them vulnerable
to attack. London followed the New York
lead, and sold the high priced' stocks and !
bought some of the low priced internationals.
â¢The preferred stocks of reorganized roads were
in .especial favor. Union â  Pacific preferred and
Northern Pacific preferred being conspicuous
, examples. Sugar was a strong sustaining force
and rose at one time 2 1 ? points, but saved only
the fraction. The local traction stocks were
markedly weak all day. Money continued In.
abundant supply and rates continue to de
cline. New York Exchange has gone to a
sharp premium at Chicago. Silver to-day sold
at 5St%. the highest price of the year, the de
mand coming from Spain.
Bonds were strong in the early dealings, but
the speculative issues yielded in sympathy with
stocks. Total sales, $4,700,000.
United States fours registered of 1907 and
1925 advanced **, while the fives registered de

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, June 3.â Strength in , Wheat was
due to an opening advance of from 2d to 2%d

rained by ' reports from â  Kansas City of con- I
, siderable damage to the Kansas Wheat crop :
by bugs, rust and rank growth. Cash Wheat I
I everywhere was scarce, and the bulk of It ap
j peared to be under Letter's control. This, to-
I gether with the fact that Letter sold 1,400,000
j bushels of cash Wheat to British millers ye
! terday created a good buying sentiment. Shorts
who .had a profit seemed disposed to cover and 1
secure â¢ It, â  while other shorts bought to stop I
further losses. On the bulges," however new
shorts were quickly created, and this selling
j and profit taking by the fortunate longs led to I
frequent breaks. The market . became sUong

CALIFORNIA DRIED FRUITS.
NEW YORK. June B.â The Journal of Com
merce says: The demand for California Dried
Fruits from consumers was light and no specu
lative interest whatever was manifested. How
ever, as spot stocks of all descriptions In the
firpt hands are light and jobbers are said to be
carrying small supplies even at this season a
steady feeling prevails.
Stocks of California Prunes in first hands con
pist almost entirely of 60(&70'8 and 70Â®80's, but
these sizes do not seem to be wanted. Jobbers
are carrying very small supplies of 40@50's and
Bo@fio'e, and of sizes below 90's they are re
ported to have little. There is, however, little
consuming demand at present and prices are
nominal. Apricots are quiet, but offerings
limited and prices firm with an upward ten
dÂ«Â»nry. General quotations are 9012 cln boxes,
but for some extra fancy fruit up to 14>*c is
demanded. Peache.s are slow of sale, but un
der small supplies of desirable goods the mar
ket is firm. California loose Muscatel Raisins
are quiet, but there 1h little offered, spot or to
arrive. The market remains firm. California
tifpdless are limited in stock and firm, but we
hear of little demand. Foreign Raisins ate
scarce. There is, however, little demand and
prices nominal. Currants are firm, though the
inquiry is light. Dates and Figs remain quiet,
with prices nominal and unchanged.

BRADSTREET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK, June 3.â Bradstreet's to-morow
will say: The general business situation might
well be expressed by the single word "crops."
Certainly the very flattering outlook reported
in nearly all the grain-growing sections of the
country, and particularly as regards the grow
ing wheat, has been of a nature to dominate
the entire trade situation. From all of the
surplus wheat-growing States there comes but
one report, that of a large acreage, extremely
good weather and crop conditions already fore-
shadowing an unprecedented production of the
king of cereals. With the steady and favor
able progress making toward a large wheat
yield has come the final elimination of the
May wheat deal and a considerable quieting
down of speculative fever and prices. The close
of the week witnesses an Immense shrinkage
in the price paid for cash wheat as compared
with a short time ago, partly the result, or
course, of former higher prices, inducing a
freer movement of reserve wheat stocks Into
eight, not only at home, but abroad. That the
ultimate effect of declines has been beneficial
rather than otherwise, however, is evidenoed
by the increased inquiry of exporters for wheat
and corn and the total movement for the week
is a record-breaking one for this period of the
year. Accompanying the decline In wheat,
however, is the sympathetic fall in oats and
flour, but corn is higher on crop news and In
creased export demand.
Reports as to distributive trade are encour
aging and weak in spite of the vague season.
A hopeful feature is the generally reported
good trade at retail, not only at the West, but
also East, where unfavorable weather condi
tions have heretofore checked the demand
greatly. The volume of orders already re
ceived for fall delivery by wholesalers is, how
ever, of such satisfactory proportions as to
lead to the Impression that the fall demand,
when it actually materializes, will be the best
seen for years.
Reports from other industries continue, on
the whole, quite good. The movement of Iron
and Pteel is still of an Immense volume and
the demand for agricultural implements has
never been exceeded.
The rather better tone reported in some
branches of the cotton and wool goods Indus
tries of late remains unimpaired, print cloths
having advanced again while wool remains
firm.
Wheat exports for the week reflect a better
export inquiry and larger shipments, aggre
gating 5,245.(i5i; bushels, against 4.30 I >,ooo bush
els la*t week, 2,620 000 bushels in this week a
year ago, 8,209,000 bushels in IS&6. 2,931,000 bush
els in 1895 and 2.742,000 bushels in 1594.
Huainess failures in the United States this
week show a sharp falling off. numbering only
178, against 231 last week, 192 in 1597, 236 in
1896 and 1595 and 207 in 1R94.
Business failures in the IK>mlnlon of Canada
number 21, against 18 last week. 37 In this
week a year ago, 29 in 1596, 27 In 1895 and 37
in 1594.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, June 3.â R. G. Dun & Co.'a
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
May having been the first full month of actual
war the fact that failures in that month were
smaller, even though but little, than In the
corresponding month last year and nearly 10
per cent smaller than in May. W6, (s some
what encouraging, tho more because a year
ago the remarkable decrease in May grave proof
of the heavy improvement in business which
made the year so gratifying in general results.
Large failures were eight in manufacturing for
$2,385,000 this year, against thirteen for $2,965,
000 last year, and in trading five for $690,000,
against ten for $1,572,077 in 1R97. Hesitation in
extending usual credits soon after the war
began naturally affected weak more than
strong concerns, but it soon gave place to
steady and increasing confidence.
Wheat dropped 74 cents from the highest
point after the May deal culminated and has
since been weaker for July because of accounts
promising an enormous yield. Those who were
nearest the truth last year now predict about
700,000,000 bushels for 181*8 and ail accounts
make acreage much larger and conditions much
better than a year ago. But with $1 IS still
paid for No. 2 red In elevator and a foreign
demand taking 6,294,498 bushels, flour included,
from Atlantic ports for the week against 2,165,
757 last year, and 385,439 from Pacific ports
against 74.929 last year, the decline evidently
hastens the marketing of surplus and gives
the new crop a better chance. It is not less
surprising that Western receipts for the week
were 4.M8.6M bushels against 2,099,795 last year,
although the crop has been by some supposed
to he almost exhausted and Corn receipts were
also 7,076,491 bushels, against 6,116,523 last year.
Exports of Corn for the week have been 4,881,
821 bushels, against 1,926.566 last year, and for
the first time in their history exports of each
grain nave about reached 200,000,000 bushels in
the same year.
Woolen mills are encouraged by a somewhat
larger demand for goods, in part from Govern
ment orders and are averaging about 1 per
cent better prices for goods than a month ago.
There is not much demand for Wool, which is
still held in the main above the views of
manufacturers and prices have declined an
average ot M cent for the month.
The Iron and Steel manufacture leads all
others in gain over previous years, its con
sumption of pig iron being apparently more
than a million tons per month, or 225.000 tons
each week, against 170,780 tons per week in
May, 1592, an Increase of 33.6 per cent. Works
beyond the Alleghanies are crowded with busi
ness and wlille some Eastern concerns are run
ning part time, mostly bar mills, the Govern
ment demand is felt most In this section.
Above all others in significance is the wholly
unprecedented demand from agricultural im-.
plemenf works, which throw in the shade ail
their past orders, while the plate and rail
manufacturers are beating all records, partly
with foreign orders, one for Cannda ha v lns*
been placed at Chicago for 12,000 tons. Struct
ural work Is very heavy, the West furnishing
a large share of it, and in sheet bars and rods
for fencing the orders arÂ»Â» large. Prices of pig
have been somewhat strengthened by the enor
mous buying orders for Bessemer and basic
at Pittsburg and of charcoal at Chicago.
Failures lor the week have been 222 in the
United StÃtes, against 241 last year, and 16 in
Canada, against 32 last year.
-r.sANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, June 3.â Bradstreet's Financial
Review to-morrow will say: A strong tone
has been shown In last week's speculation, and
generally advancing tendencies in prices have
been accompanied by increased activity, though
a sharp reaction on Friday followed the news
that the I'nited States Senate had adopted the
measure for the coinage of the silver seignior
age. The upward movement in prices has at
tracted considerable outslrir interest, but in the
more prominent stocks manipulative influences
and the work of bull cliques can be detected.
The strength of Government bonds (the new
fours advancing from 121*4 hid to 123) : the im
provement in railroad bonds indicating renew
ed activity on the part of the Investors, and
more or less buying by London have all been
sustaining factors, while in this connection
the ease of money must not be forgotten. The
principal influence continues to be the war, and
the street this week has been favorably in
fluenced by expectations that the blockading
of the Spanish squadron at Santiago will end
In its destruction and capture, and bring about
a restoration of neace. Rumors of an actual
victory in the same quarter had naturally a
decided bullish effect on Wednesday's market,
and though the alleged news was never veri
fied, the market did not exhibit any decided re
actionary tendency. In fact, holders have been
averse to selling stocks even to realize profits,
and the professional bears are timid about
putting out shorts, doubtless because a victory
would result in an immediate and sharp appre
ciation of prices. The attention is given to the
Indications of an Impending break down of
Spain's chief and only financial supportâ the
Bank of Spain â and the ease of the London
money market has also been to a certain ex
tent an element In connection with the exist
ing bullish speculative "sentiment.

That is. they would give Jl 40 for shipping

Considering that the millers are paying $1 60
fi\ 65 for choice milling. $1 40 is too low in the
opinion of sellers, so there is no business, and

Jacob Wollner's circular says: "The cloud
which hung over the wool market for the
last five or six months seems to be lifting a
little and some sunshine is appearing. Al
though the sales in this market for this week
will only amount to about 109,000 i>"iin<ls, there
Is more looking around, and by small conces
sions some large sales could be effected. The
balance of the Red Bluff wools have been Fold
at from 13c to 14c. The most Inquiry 1? fo>
foothills and Nevada wools. Two scouring
mills are In active operation and will need some
wools. The Eastern markets are reported
steady, with a good many Inquiries. Although
the sales have not been large as yet, the pros
pect! are that larger salps will be effected In
the near future, as they have been 'doubled in
the last two weeks. Wool Is stiii good prop
erty, and even If It doesn't go as high as some
holders expect it is bound to be better than
it has been In the last five or six months. The
stocks of wool In this market are* large, but if
there is an active demand it will not take long
to bring it to a normal condition. European
markets are reported steady, with active de
mand."

Of all queer forms of language perhaps
that used by tho natives of the I'ame
roons is the queerest. It is what may be
called the drum language. For this pur
pose a peculiarly-shaped drum is used.
The surface of the head Is divided into
two unequal parts. In this way the in
strument ifs made to yield two distinct
notes. By varying the intervals between
the notes a complete code of signals for
every syllable in the iaxtgusig* is pro
duced. All the natives understand the
code, and by means of it messages can
be sent quickly from one village to an
other. The "drummer in one village sends
on to the next the signals which he hears,
and so on until the message is delivered.

â  â  "Without any trial Harry Thomas, sec
retary .'.of -.the Board of Works, was ac-
Qulttl?d.;.thSs afternoon on the charge of
..subornation of perjury preferred against

! 'The .circumstances of the case nave ;

note. ;to> Ilammerton. Subsequently he
aÂ£j&lh?\ten\t before that body, contradicted
Xli former .testimony and said that his
â l.irst .-H'qrj: â â  was told at the Instigation of
Harry Thomas. For this alleged suborna
tion,of perjury Thomas was indicted.
... A /day -and- a haif. was consumed in ob
talriihg 1 a/jury,' and about the same num
ber:6f.;.ho.tit.s in disposing of the case. The
' liresvcytion -placed Major Wood on the
"etajid;~t;b'--,tell of the testimony given be
fore the. â irund Jury, of which he was a
â  .jntrjriiiyxl'- â -.â After a few preliminary ques- j
tions, he\w,as asked the following:
.' ''Stat,'e'Hn what substance was the testi- j
inqny; given, by the witness, Robert Me
' iKenziV',- I'l'efo're- the i rrana Jury then in
session,- anil- -investigating this charge of i
bribery- which you have mentioned?"'
: - it appeared- that the case of irlbery un- ;
j der Investigation by the Grand Jury was
. thai 'l;f Mayor Thomas, and not his son.
The question was immediately objected to â 
by ey.Nusbaumer on all kinds of I
grounds, but mostly on the ground that
Harry Thomas was not under investiga- I
tion at the time, and that consequently
. any evidence connecting tiarry Thomas,
C-.cer Hammerton and Robert McKenzie
â was -not material to the case under con
" t-ddefation; and that therefore no perjury
was ;â¢ committed, and consequently there
â  -was no subornation of perjury.
Some lengthy argument followed, and
finally the court took a recess, and on its ]
return Judge. Ellsworth said:
"Any evidence not connecting Mayor ;
Thomas- with -the case is certainly not
material; ahd therefore perjury could not
be; 'committed under the circumstances
â  â which the prosecution has outlined.
. â¢The tacit that Harry Thomas borrowed
money'; from prospective police officers ap
pears, to be admitted. he fact that his
father's Dame was on the notes ..en as
security for. these loans is also In e\l
.deuce. ' But there is not any evidence b^
yond; that of suspicion or inference W ;
. show that these notes were given for any |
â other than a. 'thoroughly legitimate trans
action. â¢ The prosecution states that it
cann/pt . produce proof that the $200 ob
â taJned from Peter Garrity and the 5200
obtained from J. W. Kessler were given
as bribes, and that the money was not to
be returned should these men be appoint- i
ed on. the police force. It is true that it ;
..is a suspicious circumstance that these *
loans were made while the men were can- |
didates,' and that they were returned af
; ,ter the men had failed to receive posi
tions. The inference from this is that the
money was not to be handed back should
the Board of Works appoint them to the
police force, and the further inference !
may be that Harry Thomas was negotiat- j
ing the loans jointly with his father, tne |
Mayor, for the purpose of sharing the
proceeds with his father in return tor
his father's vote. These statements, I
however, are mere inferences and sur
mises, and cannot in law be said to con
nect Mayor Thomas with any of tho I
transactions of his son. On the face of j
these notes they are ordinary transac- |
tions in good faith. Consequently the |
prosecution, having no further evidence i
than' that which it has outlined, cannot j
connect the transactions of Harry Thomas
with his father.
"The case of alleged perjury by Robert |
McKenzie therefore falls to the ground. !
. He was not testifying to anything that ;
' would have been admitted as material '
evidence in a charge brought against the j
â  Mayor, presuming he were on trial, and
therefore, whether McKenzie swore false
ly or not. he was not, according to the
statutes, committing perjury.
â¢ "it may have been and perhaps was ex
- ccedingly bad taste on the part of the
Mayor and his son to execute notes as
guarantees for loans with people who i
were, seeking patronage partly controlled
â¢ by the Mayor, but this is a matter which i
the law does not control. Under these j
circumstances the objection of the de- |
fense will be sustained."
The . prosecution stated that they had
ho more evidence to offer, as in cases of
this kind the tracks of the alleged crimes
. were always carefully covered up, mak
ing it impossible for the people to pro
duce the proper witnesses to prove their
case. â¢ Deputy District Attorney A. A.
. Moore Jr. thereupon submitted the case
to the court, and the defendant's counsel,
M. C. Chapman and Judge Nusbaumer,
asked the court to instruct the jury to
. acquit. Judge Ellsworth submitted the
- case to' the Jury with a few oral instruc
tions, that there was no evidence to con
. " yict' Harry Thomas, and that under the
law he must be acquitted.

THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 4, 1898.
FIRST GUN OF
THE CAMPAIGN
Youngr Republicans Rally
to the Flag.
ENTHUSIASM WAS RIFE
IT IS AGREED THAT GREAT
PRINCIPLES ARE NEEDED.
Eloquent Addresses by George W.
Reed, Tirey L. Ford, A. L. Frick,
J. W. Stetson and Other
Patriotic Citizens.
OAKLAND, June 3.â Political enthusi
asm, which has lain dormant since No
vember, 1896, was revived to-night, when
Alameda County opened the Republican
campaign. Though early for active poli
tics, and although the beautiful summer
night offered more comfort than a
crowded hall, there was a good attend
ance, and the first gun was well fired.
There was plenty of enthusiasm, and the
Republicans of the banner county took
every occasion to vent it.
The rally was called by th"c Young Mfn's
Republican League of Alameda County,
and it was essentially a young men's
night. A delegation from the league,
headed by a military band, met Hon.
Tlrey L. Ford at the train and escorted
him to Hamilton Hall, and when the par
ade was over every one in the heart of the
city was aware that the Republicans had
begun the battle of 189 S.
The league yell was given at every
street corner, and the league set a prece
dent for future meetings and paraaes by
appointing a special committee on yells.
It consisted of W. Nat Friend, J. W.
Stetson, Ben Woolner, Teddy Joste and
Cal Ewing.
This committee headed the parade and
sat in the front row of the hall, and had
they been matched against a band of
Comanches the red men would have paled
with fright and verdant from envy.
President Breed of the league opened the
proceedings, and between the yells was
able to announce that Hon. F. B. Ogden
would preside.
After some introductory remarks George
W. Reed was presented as the first
speaker. Mr. Reed referred to the promi
nence that young men had always attain
ed in the councils of the Republican
party, and complimented the league on
the thorough manner in which It had ar
ranged to tire the signal gun of the cam
paign.
After a reference to the war the
speaker stated that no one can tell at
this time what may be the future Issues
before the great political party of the
country. Though there can be no doubt
us to the result of the conflict with Spain,
other questions would arise which would
be new to American statesmanship, but
with which he felt assured the soldier
President will be able to cope to the en
tire satisfaction of the nation.
Hon. Tirey L. Ford said he could under
stand better, after seeing the Young
Mens' Republican League, how Alameda
County managed to roll up such good ma
jorities for the party.
"Now it is easy," said he, "to see how
it is done. A thorough organization of
young men can accomplish anything, and
certainly such a league preaching and
pnn-ticing Republicanism, as I under
stand you do, in all sections of this
county, cannot fail to exert a wonderful
influence. There are times in which prin
ciple is called for. Vacillating policies
and clouded issues are not wanted and
presage no good. Free silver and simi
lar questions are of little moment now.
The Union demands the exorcise of those
principles that saved it over thirty years
ago, and which alone can preserve its
salvationâ the great principles of the Re
publican party."
A. L. Frick. Ben Woolner, J. W. Stet
son, James Oliver and Frank M. Parcells
made speeches and the meeting broke up
cheering for everything Republican that
was suggested. .

OLD CAPTAIN
BADGER'S WOE
Wants to Die Before He
Is Quite a Pauper.
ONCE A WEALTHY OWNER.
PLEADS FOB SOME DELAY IN
STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
Offers to Sell His Property to the
Council at Figures That
Are Remarkably
Small.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 3.
Captain Badger, a pioneer of East Oak
land, who was once wealthy, but Is now
poor, told the Street Committee at the
City Council a pitiful story last night.
Years ago Captain Badger was one of the
leading capitalists and land owners of
this city. lie owned the first large publ.'c
pleasure resort in Oakland, and every on>j
of the last generation knew of Badger's
Park.
His property was mostly located in the
old section of Oakland known as Clinton,
and while the big city west of that dis
trict has been rapidly growing and tn
creasing in value, Captain Badger's
property has been more and more de
serted, and its value has decreased.
There is now a proposition before the
Council to construct East Tenth street,
from Seventh to Ninth avenue. The
greater part of the cost of this work will
fall on the capitalist of the park, and last
night he made an earnest protest against
it. "If this work goeÃ over for a year,"
said the captain, "I shall not trouble you
any longer, for I realize that I have not
that long to live. However, I do not wish
to sit still and be robbed. When I came
here a generation ago I was a rich man.
I paid $50,000 for property in East Oak
land and owned half-a-dozen ships. To
day I can't pay my passage out of town.
The people who are now making the trou
ble must have come out of a bandbox,
because they are objecting to a little dust
arising from the carts as they pass over
the street with material for East Twelfth
street. I like nice things, too. But times
are too hard. I used to wear fine clothes,
but the other day I paid $12 for a suit,
and I had to rustle to get hold of the
money. I will sell my property there
to-day for $6 a foot, and if any member
of this Council thinks that is a snap, I
will hold the offer good for twenty-four
hours after the adjournment of this
meeting."
Captain Badger then went on to say
that in times of war it Is unreasonable to
saddle unnecessary improvements on a

REVOLUTION
THAT FAILED
Filibusters Taken in
Santo Domingo.
LED BY SENOR JIMINEZ
HELD FOR EXAMINATION, BUT
A SUBORDINATE IS SHOT.
The Expedition Sailed in the Steamer
Fanita From Cape Haytien
Hayti, and Landed at
Monte Christi.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. June 3.â A dispatch to
the Herald from Puerto Plata. Domin
ican Republic, sr-s: A revolutionary
expedition was landed at Monte Christi
from Hayti, under the leadership of
Senor Jiminez, who was formerly a
merchant in New York. The Govern
ment had been advised of the move
ment and troops were in waiting for
the party and all were captured.
The leader, Jiminez, was reserved for
examination, but a subordinate. Gen
eral Augustin Morales, was shot with
out delay. President Herreux will ar
rive at Monte Christi to-morrow. It
is almost certain that the whole party
will be executed.
CAPE HaI'TIEN, June 3.â The re
port that a revolution has broken out
In Santo Domingo is confirmed, the
supposed Cuban expedition from here
being really the departure oj Domini
can revolutionists.
The mystery surrounding the move-
I ments of the Clyde Line steamer Fa
; nita are now said to be fully explained.
It appears to be established beyond a
j doubt that the reports of an uprising
lin the republic of Santo Domingo
against the power of President Her
| reux are correct. The initial blow was
struck at Monte Christi on the borders
i of Hayti, the nearest Dominican port
: to Cape Haytien. It would appear that
the Fanita, instead of having on board
only seventeen Dominicans, probably
! had 150. The Fanita arrived here on
; June 1, half empty, bringing from New
York provisions for the navy, which
she landed at Matthewtown, Bahama
: Islands. She slipped away about 10
; o'clock the same night and was to
: touch at Monte Christi or at the keys,
just outside, with the object, it was al
leged, of filling up the empty portion
i of her hold.
She had on board Chris Roberts, the
most famous pilot of the West Indies.
The captain of the Fanita said the por
tion of her cargo which was not landed
consisted of coal, but there was good
reason to suppose that it consisted of
something very different from coal.
The suspicions of the Spanish Consul
here were aroused. He denounced' the
taking on board the steamer of the
Dominicans and the sudden sailing of
. the vessel without notice and without
the permission of the Dominican Con
j sul. The Spanish Consul classed this
as an outrage and as an act of piracy,
and entered a formal protest with the
Haytien authorities.
The majority of the Dominicans, it
appears, while h<Â°re were shut up in the
[ hold of the Fanita, so as to escape at
j tention. Oeneral Juan Ysidro Jimi
1 nez and General Pablo Villaneuva are
believed to have been on board. It is
.. also noted that the former has long
' been in the public eye of Santo Do
mingo as a rlf>sirablp man for the Pres
idency. General Villaneuva fought
bravely against President Herreux's al
leged usurpation and was exiled. He
has been living at Great Inagua for
: some time past, and the Fanita is said
to have stopped there to take him on
board.
SALVATION LASSIES
SMASH NUDE FIGURES.
Public Sentiment in Omaha Upholds
the Act of Lieutenants Mauer
McCormick.
OMAHA, June 3.â The sentiment in op
position to the public display of nude hu
j man figures in Omaha seems to be very
; pronounced, for the Misses Mauer and
McCormick, arrested for committing mu
tilations on undraped statuary at the ex
position grounds, have been released for
! want of prosecution. The company con
| eluded th,is was the easiest way out of
the muddle.
The girls are lieutenants in the Salva
tion Army, and a number of the higher
officers of that organization from St. i
Louis and Chicago were present to ren- j
der necessary aid to the girls. Booth-
Tucker wired Mayor Frank Moores that
if the girls were released they would be
transferred to another station, but the |
girls refused to go, saying they desired j
to stand trial, as they had done nothing j
their conscience did not approve. The i
exposition company was determined to
prosecute at first, but a large number i
of protests were received from Omaha
people, those opposed fo the nude in art
as displayed at the grounds. The girls
did not boast of their offense, but both
declared that they had been directed by
the Lord to do as they did.
A peculiar feature of the case is the
fact that the statuary destroyed was on
the building within a few feet of the one
occupied by the girls as a rescue home
tor (alien girls. The Misses Mauer and
McCormick are the directors of the home.
They thought this continual display of
human figures before the Inmates of the j
home was corrupting their morals, and I
so climbed the building at the dead of I
night and cut the nude figures to pieces.
They were arrested before they could
escape from the grounds.

RAX RAFAEL, June 3.â John Lazarln

Mrs. I. Lowenberg, chairman of
the hospitality committee of the lo
cal Red Cross Society, announces
that no further lunches will be re
quired at the ferry until the arrival
of more troops, which will be duly
announced.
Through the untiring efforts of the ;
Red Cross Society this State has won :
an enviable reputation for hospitality
and kind-heartedness throughout the
East. The thousands of soldiers who
have arrived during the past month
have been so charmed with their recep
tion and the climate that letters have i
been written to loved ones at home ;
telling of California's kindness, and
adding that this was the only State to
live in. Hundreds of the boys in blue
have been so charmed with the people
and the State that they vow to taite up i
residence here If they return safely from
the fever-stricken shores of Manila.
: There might have been greater rest- ,
l^psneKs among the soldiers who are anx- \
â â  at tha front, and Increased
complaints against the tardiness of the
quartermasters department in awarding
food and clothing to the men, but for the
noble work of the society in alleviating
tiuir wains and its constant watchful
::Â«.^s over their welfare.
One of the strongest examples of the
Red Cross Society's beneficence was
" given on Thursday night, when It fur
nished the large body of troops from Da
kota with food, which through the neg
â  ljgence of the quartermaster's department
. or the regimental officers had been neg
lected.
." The Call yesterday told how Mrs. Har
rington and her corps of Indefatigable
assistants skirmished the city in search
of food and how their appeals were speed
ily answered by generous and kind-heart
â¢ed citizens.
This was only one of the many noble
deeds performed by the society since its
.organization, and ii is no wonder that the
public has responded so quickly in sub
scribing to carry on the great work.

REJUVENfITED OLD MAIDS.
Kirjg's Daughters Give ar> Inter-
estirjg Entertairjment in Aid
of the Red Cross Society.
The entertainment given last evening in
the California street M. E. Church by
M. M. Circle of King's Daughters for the
benefit of the Red Cross fund was a suc
cess in every particular. The "Rejuven- I
ated Old Maids" idea created merriment :
among the large audience that filled the I
assembly hall of the sacred edifice. Girls
who were supposed to havo reached that
age where marriages are few and far be
tween were placed in a box and by turn-
Ing of a crank to the soulful tune of '"Old
Black Joe" were rejuvenated into later
day girls. Miss Bessie F. Hewitt, the
president of the society, entered the magi
cal box in a costume that would attract
attention anywhere, it being so ludicrous, j
but on being released she appeared as a
winsome city belle.. Miss Browne did ;
not have the combination and was ground
and reground without materializing. Miss j
Myrtle Morton was turned out a pretty i
Red Cross girl and recited the needs of
the organization. Miss Maud Kennedy (
came forth in bridal robes, and Miss Ida ;
McMullen returned a demure "Puritan."
Miss Eikman, as the "Pride of the Navy," |
sang "Remember the Maine." Bertha j
Adams changed from an old and erratic !
maid to a fresh country girl, much to hor :
satisfaction. Miss May Druoker came out i
as she went In, "an old-fashioned girl."
After Miss 1,. Weir had sung and the
Richmond Broom Brigade, in command of
A. B. Southard, had gone through its
manual of arms, the audience and parti
cipants adjourned to a long room off the :
assembly hall and did justice to ice- ',
cream and cakes. Quite a neat sum was
realised by the entertainment, which will ;
be turned over to the society.
MINT GOLD GOES
UP IN STEAM
BEGINNING OF THE TRIAL OF
WILLIAM CLARKSON.
His Counsel Contends the Missing
Bullion Was not Stolen, But
Evaporated in the Mint.
The trial of â William Clarkson, ex-fore
man of the rolling department of the San
Francisco Mint, for embezzlement, was
begun yesterday before a jury in the
I'nlted States District Court. Judge de
Haven presiding. H. C. McPike appeared
for the defendant and Deputy District
Attorney Schleslnger for the Govern
ment.
Mr. McPike took the ground that the
Mint lost no gold at all by theft, but that
it was lost and dissipated by the processes
to which it was subjected while being re
fined and manufactured into coin in the
Mint. Much of it was carried away in
minute particles by the water in which
the gold was washed, and much of it was
evaporated by heat and moisture and
parsed away in the form of steam.
A. T. SpottÃ. coiner of the Mint, occu
pied the witness-stand during the greater
part of the day, and testified to the fact
that $1100 worth of gold in excess of the
ordinary loss, due to manipulation, had
been missed between August, 1897, and
February 24, 1898.
The prisoner is being iried on only two
charges of embezzlement, $70 worth of
gold being alleged to have been taken
away and appropriated to his own use by
Clarkson.
Mr. McPike offered to prove that since
Clarkson's discharge from the Mint there
had been proportionally as large an
amount of gold lost as there had bfen
when Clarkson had charge of the rolling
department.
Mr. Spotts told the Jury how on ascer
taining that the loss In the rolling de- '
partment was inordinate he had gone to i
Mr. Clarkson and informed him of the
lOM, that it was heavy, unusual and tin- !
accountable, and that Clarkson's conduct !
of that department was not satisfactory ;
to the witness as coiner.
E. D. Carver, a blacksmith residing at
340 Golden Gate avenue, was called for the
purpose of testifying tn the fact that
clarkson last November brought some of
th.> stolen gold to his shop, but Mr. Me- :
Pike objected. The testimony of the wit
ness would destroy Mr. Mcl'ike's theory i
that the missing gold had evaporated in j
steam In the Mint. The argument on the ,
objection was deferred until to-day, and
the jury 'was excused until Monday.
CHINATOWN ARBESTS.
Excellent Work DonÂ© by Sergeant
McManus and His Squad.
Chief l.ees yesterday received trie re
1 prt of the first month's work of Sergeant
' McManus and his Chinatown squad, and
it shows that they have not been asleep.
During the month 241 arrests were made,
and out of that number there were only
twenty-one dismissals. The amount of
fines contributed to the treasury was
$1890, which compares most favorably
with the results of any previous squad.
1 Forty-two cases of lottery tickets, valued
at $300, were seized and confiscated, the
largest seizure of the kind ever made at
one time.

Townsend resigned his position as* opener

ployment, and F. W. Lewis was appointed
in his place from the eligible list. J. P.
McNab, opener and packer, got tired of
the Job and handed in his resignation.
His place was tilled by the appointment
of A. C. Buckbee from the eligible list.
Wants Her Marriage Annulled.
Janet A. Pariser has applied to the Su
perior Court for an annulment of her
marriage to George Pariser. Mrs. Pari
ser alleges that the marriage was per
formed in New Jersey in November of
1897, and that she has since discovered
that her husband had a wife, who was at
the time of her marriage and still is in
the land of tne living. In consequence
the plaintiff asks that her marriage be
annulled and that she be allowed to re
sume her maiden name, Prescott.

THE SA!N FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 4, 1898.
ROBBED OF
HIS WATCH
AND MONEY
Bold Crime of Three
Criminals.
THREATENED TO KILL HIM
HENRY KAHERS, A STRANGER,
HELD UP.
Joseph. Reed, One of His Assailants,
Arrested and Locked Up in
the Tanks Pending
Investigation.
Henry Kahers, a recent arrival from
Nebraska, was attacked by three men
on Pacific street, near Leavenworth,
Thursday night, and after being beaten
into insensibility was robbed of $30 and a
gold watch.
According to Kahers' story he was on
his way home when he was accosted by
a young man, who asked him for a
match. Catching a glimpse of two men,
who were concealed in a doorway, Ka
hers, tuspecting something wrong, start
ed to walk away. Just then the men
who were in the doorway emerged from
their place of concealment and attacked
him.
One of them struck him over the head
with a slungshot, felling him to the
ground. While one of the men proceeded
to search his clothing the other repeat
edly kicked him in the face and stomach.
After taking the money and valuables
the robbers threatened to kill him if he
informed the police. They then run down
Pacific street and disappeared in the
darkness.
Kahers a short time afterward visited
the North End Station and told his tale
of woe to the oflicer in charge. From
his description of the man who struck
him with the slungshot Policeman Mc-
Grayn of the California-street Station
yesterday afternoon arrested Joseph
Reed, a teamster, and locked him up in
the tanks pending an Investigation.
Reed denies any complicity in the rob
bery and claims that he can prove an
alibi by at least half a dozen reputable
citizens. Notwithstanding his protesta
tion of Innocence Kahers says he is one
of the men who assaulted him.
The police claim they know the other
robbers and confidently expect to arrest
them to-day.
In telling his experience to Chief Lees
Kahers said he had left his home in Ne
braska intending to come to this city to
seek employment. He rented a room in
a down-town lodging-house, expecting to
remain there until he procured work.
Learning that a friend was stopping at
a house on Pacific street, near Hyde, he
concluded to call on him. As he passed
Leavenworth street ho was attacked by
the three men.

PRECITA VALLEY CLUB.
The Contour of Frog Hollow Is Being
Rapidly Transformed.
Through the instrumentality of John T.
Graham and his Precita Valley Improve
ment Club the contour of what was a few
years ago a home for meandering frogs
is rapidly assuming the shape of com
fortable homes for small families who
purchased property there some few years
ago. Streets and avenues have been laid
out, graded and sewered, bringing the
valley into prominence as a snug dwell
ing place for those who reside there. Yet
much is required to be done, and to do
it the club keeps hammering away at the
Supervisors for additional work. One
final effort will be made this year to have
Bernal Park beautified and turned into
a pleasure ground tor the children of that
section. In addition to this the Supervi
sors will be petitioned to have Harrison
street, from Twenty-sixth to Precita ave
nue. Treat avenue, Shotwell and Capp
streets, from Twenty-sixth to Army
street, graded and sewered during the
early portion of the next fiscal year. The
extension of Potrero avenue from Ninth
street to the county line will be finished
during the coming year. Then will fol
low the filling in of Twenty-sixth street
from Bryant to San Bruno avenue, and
the abatement of that standing nuisance,
the broken sewer which has and is at
present a standing menace to the health
of the entire community.
The thanks of the club to the Superin
tendent of Streets was offered at the i
meeting last night for bringing to time J
the contractors wno had the grading of j
Twenty-sixth street for the last nine
months. The forfeiting of their bonds
and the sublettin- of the contract to oth
ers has had the desired effect. The work
is now going on in a satisfactory manner.

FORGED HIS
CLIENT'S NAME
Warrant Out for A. J.
Greene's Arrest.
HE HAS LEFT* THE CITY
PUBLIC ADMINISTBATOR IM
POSED UPON.
The Arrest of John Lapique Three
Years Ago on a Charge of
Embezzlement Is
Recalled.
A warrant was issued yesterday by-
Judge Mogan for the arrest of Attoraey
A. J. Greene on a charge of forgery.
Greene has left the city and is supposed
to be in Hanford.
The complaining witness is John La- J
pique, 1318 Stockton street. Lapique was I
arrested In June, 1895, on a charge of fel- |
ony embezzlement. He was agent for
Jean Louis Ader, an old Frenchman, and
in negotiating the sale of furniture and 'â 
personal effects in the lodging house at
514 Bush street to Ader on June 13, 1895, it
was alleged that he embezzled $300 of the
purchase price. He was held to answer
before the Superior Court, and Judge
Belcher on April 13, 1896. sentenced him i
to eight years in the State prison. He I
appealed to the Supreme Court on the
ground that he had agreed with the land
lady of the lodging house that he should !
receive any money beyond $1150, the
price she was willing to accept, and he
kept the $300 in virtue of that agreement.
The Supreme Court reversed the judg
ment of the lower court on February 3
last, and Lapique got his liberty after
having been over two years in the County
Jail.
Ader meantime . had died and Laplque
filed a claim on his estate for J7335, which
was rejected by the Public Administra
tor. He then brought suit to recover the
amount. Lapique had no attorney, and
while he was in jail J. D. Sullivan, attor
ney for the Public Administrator, moved
I for the dismissal of the case, as the
I plaintiff was not represented, and it was
i dismissed.
Shortly afterward Attorney Greene, who
was connected with A. P. Van Duzer's
office, called upon Laplque at the County
Jail, and after leaving him sent him the
1 following letter:
I just returned from my proposed Interview
with you and am determined that you shall
see what I have tr> say. Jerry Sullivan for
j certain reasons will asree to have the case
i against Freese reinstated If I am interested. I
I can get you $250. otherwise you set nothing.
! I will give you $200 of it and take $f>o myself.
This is all you can possibly get; otherwise the
same is gone forever.
Lapique refused to agree to the propo
i sitlon, and since leaving jail he discovered
! that the following order purporting to be
i signed by him had been presented to the
I Puoiic Administrator, and in September
last $250 paid to Greene to compromise
the case:
Pay to A. P. Van Duzer or A. J. Greene, my
attorneys, any amount of money due me In
compromising my case against A. C. Freese,
and oblige, JOHN LAPIQUE.
Lapique declares that his signature is
i a forgery, and he has instituted proceed
i ings before Judge Seawell to have the suit
j against the Public Administrator reln
â  stated.
J. B. HUGHES' FUNERAL.
Will Take Place This Morning From
St. Peter's Cnurch.
The funeral of the late James B.
Hughes will take place this morning
! from St. Peter's Church, on Alabama
: street. Deceased was a member of the
! Young Men's Catholic onion, and past
president of St. Peter's Literary Society.
These organizations will attend the fu
; neral In a body. Mr. Hughes was in the
; prime of life, and his death has caused
| great sorrow among his many friends.
For there was not a more popular young
man in the Mission, where he was a resi
dent since his boyhood. He was one of
the organizers and active members of the
Potrero-Avenue Improvement Club, and
he took a very prominent part in the
movement to remove the County Hospital
and Pesthouse from their present loca
tion.
From his early boyhood Mr. Hughes has
been connected with the firm of Francis,
Valentine & Co., where he worked his
I way up the ladder from an errand boy to
secretary of the firm, which position* he
j has held for many years. In his death
the community has lost a valued and ac
tive citizen. He leaves a widow and a
little daughter.
Patriotic Wood-Turner.
R. Robinson, a wood-turner, became so
excited over the work of Schley's squad
ron at Santiago de Cuba that he pur
chased half a dozen big firecrackers
Thursday night, and while on his way
home about 1 o'clock yesterday morning
he tired them off on Polk street, between
McAllister and Golden Gate avenue. The
reports sounded like those of a gun, and
Policeman Youraky, the linguist of the
department, thought murder was being
committed. He rushed to the scene and
arrested Robinson on th<? charge of dis
turbing the peace. Yesterday morning,
after Judge Low heard Robinson's ex
planation, he dismissed the case.

A SEVERE NORTHER
IS PREDICTED.
FORECASTER SAYS WE WILL
HAVE THREE HOT DAYS.
Temperature Rising Rapidly in the
Sacramento Valley â Slight Fall
in Pressure Along the Cal
ifornia Coast.
"Weather Forecaster Ilammon says that
we are going to have two scorching hot
daysâ to-day and to-morrow. This he
reasons from the weatncr conditions and
from precedent, which has established
that our hot days come in threes. Yes
terday was the first day of the hot spell,
and summer clothing was very much in
demand. The maximum temperature of
the day in this city reached 71 degrees in
the shade, and to-day, according to Ham
mcn, it will be much more than that.
There has been a rapid increase in pres
sure over Washington, Idaho and Mon
tana, and a slight fall along the coast of
California, These conditions are develop
ing what is likely to be a severe norther
in California. Temperature has risen
rapidly in the Sacramento Valley, and
will continue to rise. A marked fall In
temperature has taken place in the plat
eau region of Nevada and Utah, and the
conditions are reversed in Utah and
Northeastern Nevada, where they have
had a heavy fall of snow.
The forecast for Northern California is
fair to-day, with brisk north winds.

The Wasp This Week.
The first convention of the California
State League of Republican Clubs, which
was held this week in this city, was pho
tographed exclusively for the Wasp, and
in this week's issue considerable space is
devoted to the League. There are be
sides the picture of the convention a num
ber of half-tones of leading Republicans
fmrn various parts of the State. Other il
lustrated features are the volunteer ren
dezvous at Camp Merritt and the recent
Santa Rosa rose carnival. The cartoons arÂ«
clever, one showing Uncle Sam eking out
the just deserts to a notorious disciple of
yellow journalism, and another on a mil
itary topic. In the "Social Sidelights"
some of the newest g-ossip in the ultra
fashionable set is told, and the "Old
Maid's Diary," the "X Ray" and several
other departments are up to good stan
dard.
