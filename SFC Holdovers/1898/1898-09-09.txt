WELCOMES THE SONS, AND
DAUGHTERS OF CALIFORNIA
SAN JOSE BEGINS
THE GREAT NATAL
DAY CELEBRATION
Natives of the Golden State Invade the
Garden City in Vast
Throngs.
Spectators by the Thousand Are Also on Hand to Join the
Festivities and View the Big Parade
To- Day.
SAN JOSE, Sept. B.â Some
months ago San Jose extended
an invitation to the Sons and
Daughters of the Golden West to
come down and help themselves
to the city. The invitition was
accepted, and to-night they came
and helped themselves. What
they did not want may be found
floating somewhere out in the
bay, but it is not worth looking
for.
This is young California's
night, and young California is
not letting anybody in Santa
Clara County forget it to any ap
preciable extent. He an^ she are
all here; it can't be possible that
one is missing, and one has only
to fight one's way for a block
along First street to readily be
lieve that two or three envious
sister States have sent large, ro
bust delegations of their hope
and pride to swell the throng.
Judging from the crowds on
the streets at midnight there
ought to be not less than 5,000,
000 votes cast in the State at the
November election, even though
the girls have not been granted
the right of suffrage.
And what a noise! Everybody
is trying his or her level best to
drown the uproar of all the
others, unmindful of the fact that
glittering success does not seem
to crown their efforts. But they
do manage to increase the din.
Brass bands tramp down the
street, every mother's son jam
ming wind into his instrument
like mad; at least his cheeks
bulge like a toy balloon, but not
a sound of melody reaches the
sidewalk. Standing close beside
them one might hear something
resembling the feeble piping of
tin whistles, that is all.
San Jose has been lavish of
electricity, and all the principal
streets are ablaze with light;
every man and most of the
women are armed with Roman
candles, while the skies are faifly
aglow with countless rockets
The San Francisco Call
bursting high in the air, their
multi-colored balls of fire blend
ing in dazzling beauty.
A few â very few â people are
trying to sleep, but they are only
perfecting themselves in profan
ity. They may as well get up and

SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1898.
join their tormenters on' the
streets, for there will be no sleep
in the Garden City to-night; it
and its guests are suffering from
a bad attack of insomnia.
About 10 o'clock the streets became
somewhat deserted, and strangers
thought there was not going to be a
hilarious a time as they had been
promised. But the people were not
going: to bed, they were merely packing
themselves into the two depots to wel
come the late comers from San Fran
cisco and Alameda counties.
The first section of the San Franicsco
train arived at 10:30, closely followed
by the second section. While they were
being emptied of their freight, the Ala
in dans rolled into the narrow-gauge
depot. Then there was a great mix-up.
The San Jose parlors, with their band
were on Market street waiting to es
cort the visitors up to their headquar
ters, but the other sections of the San
Francisco special kept filling in, their
occupants made a rush for the street,
and the Alamedans and San Francis
cans became involved in a hopeless
tangle, which no mortal could
straighten out in a week. Visiting del
egations crowded past the local parlors
and started up town two and three
parlors abreast, leaving the escort to
become the escorted.
Here a band vainly struggled to make
"There'll Be a-Hot Time" sound above
a vigorous'drum corps marching along
side of them and the cheers, whoops,
shouts and screams of ten thousand
people lining the streets. The tune was
appropriate, even though it could not
be heard, for the "hot time" arrived all
right as per schedule.
Stanford marched with Golden Gate;
Niantic became tangled up with El Do
rado; Sequoia wished those infernal
drummers attached to Rincon would
get tired or drop dead or something.^o
they could keep step with their own
music. Members lost their parlors,
ladies lost their escorts and there was
all kinds of mischief to pay, but with
it all only the greatest good humor pre
vailed. Any man who lost his temper
in that crowd would have had a hard
time of it.
The girls probably had the hardest
time of it in the rush and crush. Each

Youths Representing Parlors From This City
March Through the Streets to the Strains
of Martial Music.
Spectators of the Parade Are Moved by the Carnival Spirit With
Which the Proceedings in the Garden City for the Next
Three Days Will Be Enlivened.
With blare of brass instruments and
with their way illuminated by red fire
and by rockets bursting high in the air
the San Francisco parlors of Native
Sons of the Golden West marched from
their headquarters last night and em
barked for the Garden City. j.his was
the first part of a long programme of
festivities which annually marks the
pilgrimage of members of the order to
some city within a short distance of
the metropolis.
The conditions- all seem propftious
this year for the success of the annual
gathering of the organization for which
the people of this State have so great
an admiration. This sentiment is
shared equally by the sister organiza
tion â the Native Daughters of the
Golden West â -omposed of the budding
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
womanhood of the State. Both repre
sent the generation of sturdy miners
and their helpmeets who built up the
country and now one by one are being
gathered to their fathers.
The close of the war finds the people
bubbling over with patriotism. This
was shown in the cheers that greeted
"Old Glory," which was carried proudly
at the head of the procession and by
representatives of every parlor.
The war spirit has given way to the
carnival spirit. Yet the sight of the
Native Sons last night brought tears
to the eyes of many as they carried
them back in memory to that spring
day when the gallant boys of the First
California Volunteers marched down
the main thoroughfare of the city.
Their country required their services
in far away lands. They were Native
Sons and under the burning skies of
the tropics they are surely celebrating
the holiday so dear to all Californians
The tears that dimmed the eyes of
spectators last night could not be tears
of regret as the flower of the city's
young manhood was en route to the
fruitful valley of Santa Clara. Here
preparations have been under way for
weeks for the prcper reception and en
tertaining of the hosts of young men
and young women. The gardens have
yielded their richest blossoms; the
orchards their luscious fruits and the
vineyards sparkling wines equal to
those of the sunkissed hills of France.
All these are offered upon the heavily
tables of the hospitable Garden
â¦ity. It is not necessary to hand the
golden key of the city to representa
tives of the order, as nothing is locked.
The city, noted throughout the land
for the beauty of its women, will add
its quota of pretty girls in organdies
and duck suits to carry out the spirit
of carnival time. Flags and vari-col
ored bunting have brightened the
streets and transformed the city into a
fitting background for the festivities
which were inaugurated last night.
The Native Daughters were not in
evidence last night. It was not deemed
expedient for them to parade, but they
will be seen in all their glory in the
demonstration "at San Jose.
For an hour before the parade started
last night Mason street. In the vicinity
of Native Sons' building, was a seeth
ing mass of humanity. Grand Marshal
Daniel A. Ryan established his head
quarters near the building and soon his
aids were hurrying- to and fro assign
ing the various parlors to their proper
stations. The Twentieth Kansas band
played several concert selections, while
in the distance could be heard the mar
tial music of a drum and fife corps.
In the big building alt seemed in
extricable confusion. Men were shout
ing to their fellows, inquiries as to
tickets and impendimenta which they
were to carry. Exactly upon the stroke
of a quarter past 8 a rocket went up
ward with a long drawn out hiss and
then exploded high in the air. This
was the signal for the advance.
The confusion was stilled, and like
well-drilled soldiers the men of the
first division stepped off to the music
of one of Sousa's marches. Twenty
men of the mounted police, Corporal
Shannahan commanding, led the way.
Following them was Grand Marshal D.
A. Ryan, accompanied by his chief
of staff, L. F. Sericano; Chief Aid Ed
ward L. Head and aids, H. G. W.

Hayden, William Milton, S. "V. Cos

PRETTY PARADE OF
NATIVE DAUGHTERS
SAN JOSE, Sept. B.â The Native Daughters came early to get a
good night's rest in order to be ready for the grand parade to-mor
row and the ball to-morrow night. Regular trains leaving San Fran
cisco and Oakland during the afternoon came in double sections, and
the coaches were nearly all filled with the Daughters of California,
After dinner thif evening th^y paraded. They were not mar
shaled in regular divisions, with a platoon of mounted police in ad
vance, and their marching was not enlivened by the strains of brass
bands, yet they paraded of their own accord along First street and
Santa Clara avenue from 7 until 10 o'clock, and were reviewed by
thousands of resident spectators and a vast number of visitors. The
beauty column looked well and marched in good style. If it pleased
the girl on parade to march five blocks and counter march, she ob
served that order. She was conscious that the column was on re
view and under inspection, but she was satisfied that the reviewing
officers were dilighted.
Conversation was carried on in ranks as it Is at high tea, the
Daughters all talking at the same time, but seldom any two on the
same topic. If any subject was uppermost it was the ball to-morrow
night, which promises to be one of the greatest social events under
the banner of the Bear.
The decorations in honor of the reunion are elaborate, even pro
fuse, but a harmonious plan is not observed. Individual enterprise
is manifest along with the individual taste. There are also conces
sions to consistency. For example, an undertaker's place on First
street displays bunting in graceful profusion, but does not herald the
common motto, "Welcome, N. S. G. W." Early in the evening some
premature youngsters, bearing brooms and aspiring to the joys of the
bowl, made a deal of a racket to engage the attention of the Native
Daughters, but attracted more attention than compliment.
It is now plainly foreshadowed that the hotel and transportation
facilities of San Jose will not be adequate to the demands of the
multitudes assembling in the city. The Native Bons' celebration, con
ducted jointly with a celebration by the Native Daughters, grows
in importance as the years advance. San Jose is so near the center
of population in California and the Garden City is so readily accessi
ble by frequent trains from the metropolis that this partciular Ad
mission day celebration is assembling a throng much larger than
was originally estimated.

The fourth and last division was mar
shaled by William C. Miller, his aids
being peorge J. Donnelly and E. J.

There was but little attempt at dis
play. The light suits which will
brighten the parade at San Jose were
snugly packed In dress suit cases. All
that was left were the distinguishing
regalia of the members.
The one excention to this was a drill
corps attached to one of the parlors.
The members wore a uniform of white
dwek trousers and blue cap and coat.
In the course of the parade the mem
bers, mostly youths, formed various
crosses and stars. Each member was
equipped with a torch, thus marking the
evolution of the corps, a brilliant feat
ure of the parade.
The line of march was on Mason
street to Market, to Third, and thence
to the depot, at Townsend street. The
streets were thronged with spectators,
who cheered lustily for the boys in
line. Poor Indeed was the native who

down upon the depot and its sur
roundings.

and the Hearts of All
Within It.
There was one part of the celebration,
a great part, possibly and, to be cour
teous, the greatest part, that was not a
part of the procession.
The Native Daughters were every
where, everybody and everything, and
what would the 9th of September be
without them?
They did not assemble around Native
Sons' Hall on Mason street; their pretty
heads are not worried over the arrange
ments for the parade, but still it may
be said they are the feature.
The train was scheduled to leave at
9 o'clock. The Native Sons were sched
uled to arrive at the Third-and-Town
send-street station a full quarter of an
hour before that. They got there on
time, but found their territory dis
puted.
Long before the hour the waiting
room, passageways and in fact all
available space was occupied by the
happy-faced, laughing, free-hearted
daughters of the Golden West.
The last man of the column finally
passed through the big gates of the
depot and Sergeant Michael Joseph
Conboy heaved a sigh of relief and
walked away. That was the end of
things so far as San Francisco is con
cerned, but that end was only the be
ginning.

umphantly paraded the streets to-night
on the way to the depot to welcome
the thousands of Native Sons and
Daughters who have come to celebrate
the forty-eighth anniversary of Cali
fornia's statehood. They were recip
ients of congratulations on all sides on
the successful manner in which they
had handled the preparations for the
celebration. For the past few months
they have been hard at work, and
things have gone on without a hitch
until now the greatest celebration of
the kind in the history of the State Is
In progress.
Marches of the local parlors with
music preparatory to the coming of the
hosts enlivened the evening and did
much to entertain the people until the
arrival of the visiting parlors. Stock
ton Parlor was met at the broad gauge
depot about 8 o'clock, and at 10 the
parlors separated and went to both the
broad and narrow gauge depots to re
ceive parlors from the bay counties.

Continued from First Page.
one of them was united to a huge ex
tension basket containing that en
trancing costume she is to wear in the
big parade to-morrow, and even though
she lost her escort no ill must befall
that basket. Bravely the girls
struggled along through the crowd
vainly seeking her comrades. Perspir
ing standard-bearers searched for their
fellows who had strayed from their
banners, and failing to find them fell
in with the first crowd that happened
along and marched contentedly to his
haven of rest.
Finally, with the assistance of a
dozen mounted aids, who dashed reck
lessly through th choked streets,
heedless of the lives of men and
women, the San Jose parlors managed
to reach the head of the procession,
and by the time Santa Clara avenue
was reached some semblance of order
was effected. That is, the parlors had
fallen into line, so that the doubling up
of organizations was overcome.
Under the beautiful illuminated tow
er, Third street to San Fernando, back
to First past the St. James and to the
Vendome, the procession or part of it
marched, At almost every corner a
fragment would break off and start on
a little parade of its own, having no
particular objective point in view; but
just celebrating. Nobody could under
stand why they were escorted to their
headquarters; they did not want to
turn in. What they wanted was fun,
and it was easy to be found.
If there is any person in San Jose to
night who has any fault to find with
the Natives, their reception and the ef
forts of the citizenÃ to entertain them
that person ought to have his digestive
organs attended to at once.
It is not the fault of San Joseans
that there are not beds enough in town
to go around. San Jose expected and
was prepared to house 12,000 or 15,600
visitors, all it had reason to expect
would attend the celebration.
But San Jose hospitality has extend
ed further than her people knew, and
so when 20,000 guests from all parts of
the State came tumbling In to-day
there could only be one result â some
had to continue their fun until morning
in lieu of sleeping.
. The great event of the celebration,
however, will come to-day with the
big parade, and while it will be watch
ed by some eyes that are heavy no
body here will miss it.
After the parade vi3lts and receptions
will be in order until night, when the
grand ball In the pavilion will be held
with informal dances in nearly every
headquarters for the accommodation of
those who will be unable to force their
way into the big affair. Then there
will be more street parading, singing,
shouting and all the accompanying
racket, in fact It will be a repetition of
to-night, for nobody will think of going
home before Sunday.
VARIOUS PARLORS TO
HOLD RECEPTIONS
Annual Reunions Are Becoming In
teresting Features of the
Celebration.
SAN JOSE, Sept. B.â To-morrow vari
ous parlors will hold receptions at their
headquarters and Native Sons and
Daughters from all over the State will
become acquainted with each other.
This annual reunion has become one of
the features of Admission day, and each
year the custom meets with greater fa
vor. Old pioneers drop in at these
gatherings and spin yarns of the days
of '49. The choicest of eatables and
viands are served and the greatest
cheer prevails. About forty parlors of
Native Suns and Daughters â will thus
entertain, and in many instances
dances will be given in the evening.
Different headquarters to-night pre
sented animated scenes and gave evi
dences of preparation for much pleas
ure to-morrow. At the Hotel Vendome
there were greater numbers than else
where. Here Stanford No. 76, Oakland
No. 50, Alameda No. 47, Athens No. 195
and Yerba Buena No. 84 are located and
they will entertain lavishly for the next
three days. Other parlors have estab

Celebrations.
SAN JOSE, Sept. B.â Among many
others' arriving to-night on the San
Francisco special were William Blatt
ner, James Gallagher, James O'Gara,
Percy Long, Judge Ccnlan, William A.
Deane, W. H. Alford, Judge Kerrigan,
Joseph O'Donnell, J. J. Jameson, Mayor
Phelan, "Daniel Ryan and Judge Con
ley, candidate for Justice of the Su
preme Court on the fusion ticket.
Dr. Pardee of Oakland, who always
attends the Native Sons' celebration of
Admission day, is agreeably sheltered
at the Vendome Hotel, where many of
the Alameda representatives are so
journing.
George Houghton, regent of the
State University, is in San Jose to
night. Judge Mogan and G. Blodes
are also in the throng of visitors.
The journey hither of the specials
running on either side of the bay was
without incident other than entertain
ment, such as singing, music and con
vivial greeting. While many politi
cians are here, there are no signs of
political demonstration. Candidates in
the field and aspiring gentlemen who
expect to be called forth to serve the
public are keeping in touch with tbe
progressive young men comprising the
order of Native Sons' of the Golden
West.
Vmong the noted guests of the occa
sion is Judge Coffey of San Francisco,
who was turned down by the Maguire
convention at Sacramento. At this
hour (1 a. m., Admission day) there is
some inclination among the youngsters
to shout for a favorite candidate. Some
rousing cheers are given for Al John
son of Sacramento, but the demonstra
tion is not encouraged by the Native
Sons. Among the prominent Oakland
ers here are R. M. Fitzgerald, Henry
Dalton and John McDonald.

whole lot of people here now â and more
are coming â who will have to try to
forget about beds and sleep and all that
sort of thing until they get back home.
The man who was careful and se
cured a room a week or two in advance
is an object of veneration among his
less provident fellows. They lift their
hats to him and talk In whispers of his
large mental caliber and about his
availability for Congress, and in other
ways give expression to his worth as
a citizen. The ladies! Well, it is some
what different with them. Take those
of the fair daughters of the State, for
instance, who have planned this trip
with their brothers for weeks and came
in to-day to be escorted to a "first floor
front" by an obsequious attendant.
Now, those girls are not venerated by
their less happily situated sisters who
only decided to come at the last min
ute and jumped aboard the train this
afternoon to avoid the rush and get
comfortably settled before the jam got
here. Oh, no. There is no talk of po
litical or other honors for them. On
the contrary, they are made to feel that
they have taken an unfair advantage
of the others; sort of played a low
down game, as it were, and when they
pass, instead of respectful salutes they
get a cold shoulder and some real hate
ful side remarks.
All the hotels are brimming over;
every lodging house has put cots on
the roof and run up fire escapes for the
convenience of those guests occupying
the sky floor; private 'unilies have
been called upon to shelter visitors un
til the residents themselves have been
driven to the attics.
Still they come and will continue to
come all night and to-morrow fore
noon.
And with all the uproar and jostling
and bustling fan Jose is happy, for the
Native Sons and Daughters are always
honored guests whom the townspeople
delight to honor and are willing to sub
mit to any amount of inconvenience for
their sakes.
Everybody was out to welcome the
Stockton parlors, which were scheduled
to arrive at 6:45 p. m., but did not get
in till long after that hour. Gorgeously
bebadged the local Natives, accom
panied by a band of music (none of the
musicians being consumptives) and
everybody in town were at the depot to
greet the Slough City delegation, and
a warm reception the pilgrims were
accorded. The members themselves
and some of their friends had engaged
rooms in advance, but â there were
others â and so while the reception com
mittee and the band and the populace
escorted their guests through the prin
cipal streets there were some who
joined that other procession and in
vaded the side streets and alleys
searching for a "room to let." sign.
Such an inscription that did not lie
would have brought more joy than an
emblazoned passage of holy writ; it
was more difficult to find than an hon
est politician training under Jim Rea'a
standard.
After the Stocktoniana had been
housed, or such of them as had lodg
ings to go to. the crowds thronged the
streets, passing the time pending the
arrival of the special trains from San
Francisco and Oakland viewing the
street decorations and overwhelming
the icecream parlors.
San Jose has outdone herself in the
matter of decorations. The whole city
Is a-flutter with bright-hued bunting,
while the business houses and public
buildings are brilliant in their plumage.
The finest effort in the way of decorat
ing is the electric light tower on Santa
Clara avenue. That graceful, almost
fairy-like structure, towering 150 feet
above the driveway it spans, has been
festooned with a myriad of arc lights
along the four corner shafts and the
center column. To-night the lamps
were lighted for the first time, present
ing an indescribably beautiful night
picture. Everybody gazed at it spellr
bound; even the shelterless unfortu
nates, to whom there is little left in the
world that Is bright and beautiful,
could not help admiring the scene,
though their admiration was tinctured
with malice, for they made unkind re
marks about the lack of foresight on
the part of the committee in not string
ing up cots instead of arc lights.

Voyage of Commissioners on a
Little Steamer to Neigh

Hittof Illinois Speaks Loving Words of Patriotism

Special Correspondence of The Call. '
WAILUKU, Island of Maul. Aug. 21.
The Claudine, trim and tidy little is
land steamer, sailed out of Honolulu
harbor on the afternoon of August the
20th, bearing to Hawaii's other Islands
the august body of United States Com
missioners, head, trunk, hide, horns,
hoof and tail.
One learns after a bit of a while to
know all these apart, but at first, with
thirteen to choose from, I vow It was
hard to tell a Senator from his Secre
tary, the gTeat man fnom the small.
An air of Importance is so monstrous
catching. When I saw theâ cr â under
âgentlemen of the official party at din
ner I took thesm all for dukes. But
this, mtnd you, was at the hotel, on dry
land, where a man's legs do not inter
fere with his pretensions. The wilted
dignity of great personages at sea is
what mere men make merry over on
shore.
No one came to speed the Commis
sion on its way. This official tour of
inspection about the isiands, the result
of which their future government
might be said to hang, awoke not the
slightest Interest in Honolulu. The
Commissioners have not, truth to tell,
been followed about at any time by
gaping crowds. No committee of re
ception waited on. their coming. No
delegation escorted them to the Ha
waiian Hotel. They came humbly
enough in their hired hacks and intro
duced themselves to the hotel register.
Beyond the semi-public reception ten
dered them by Mr. Harold M. Sewall,
ex- Minister to the United States, noth
ing brilliant has been done for them
socially.
This reception was brilliant enough.
Coming on the shabby heels of the An
nexation Ball, it was even dazzling.
Those who took advantage of the gen
eral card of invitation published in the
Honolulu papers were not of a sort to
mar the handsome rest which went on
terms of acquaintance to the ex-United
States Minister's house. Men and wo
men met there in that agreeable secur
ity which makes the rarefied social at
mosphere, and if a few here and there
whiffed it awesomely and for the first
time, the lantern lighted grounds were
wide enough in which to lose such
harmless differfncfs as these. And as
these grounds were wide so were they
beautiful, mysterious, like "charmed
groves of other stars than earth," i
lighted shiftingly by hundreds of little i
Japanese lanterns strung like Jewels
in the trees, shaking soft colored lights
out on the waters â for the shaded
lawns of "Waikiki creep down into the
sea â gleaming on the jewels, silks and
tulles of women, caressing soft bared
heads and sweet uncovered shoulders,
fearlessly given to the gentle Hawai
ian night. Within, the goodly throng
bent upon the hand of the Special
Agent of the United States â for at last
Mr. Sewall's new title is out of the of
ficial bag â and that of his wife, and
those of Senator and Mrs. Cullom of
Illinois (and. Washington) and their
daughter, Mrs. Ridgway, of â I
really do not know where â and then
stood glittering in lovely frocks and
exceedingly well tailored garments un
der the electric lights, or wandered out
beneath the trees, where all shapes
were gracious in caressing half
shadows, and the band played its va
rious accompaniment to the changeless
voice of the surf.
And, although a little person in pink
tuile shrugs a dear, disdainful shoulder
with a love of a dimple in It, to the
right of me, and remarks to some
Philadelphia shoulder straps, in fond
attendance, that she hates these polit
ical love feasts. I, in my social inno
cence, find it a very fit and lovely spec
tacle, and, since after the Annexation
Ball. I had not given Honolulu credit
for them, I am glad to have seen a few
of her frocks and manners before
shaking the dust of these Hawaiian Is
lands from my homing feet.
So, as I say, nobody came to see the
Commission off. The band fumed as
usual on the pier and the native boys
dived and ducked for dimes and nickels
in the green waters about the ship.
But they were not the dimes and nick
els of the United States Commissioners,
which same, according to rumor, are
handled with economy, and so have no
part or place in this chronicle of Com
misÃional happenings by land or sea.
The Claudine slipped out Into the

enough at the Courthouse to see the
Commissioners arrive, all garlanded
with leis of brilliant blossoms like prize
cattle at a county fair.
A crush of all sorts of rigs and traps
was at the door and tied beneath the
trees were droves of the sturdy Uttle

the most part, old native women who
had come mile upon mile through the
beautiful, simple, uncritical country

rides it man 'fashion In her holoku.

strange company of troubled faces,

yuarter whites come to listen to the

why America has taken their country
from them. The place was crowded.
Men stood four and five rows deep
outside the windows and doors.
Senator Cullom spoke.
He rose to the introduction of Judge
Kaaluaâ who was also his interpreterâ
his lean, keen American face with that
fatal likeness to Abraham Lincoln
which took this man into politics and,
like the name of a great father de
scended to a little son, has been both
his help and hinderance there â rising
with singularly silly effect out of his
lei of yellow flowers. He looked like an
eagle In chains. He spoke like a man
who has nothing in particular to say.
He told his "friends and fellow citi
zens" all about what happened on the
7th of Julyâ as If they did not know
that much for themselves, the poor,
bewildered dears!â and how very good
It was for them to belong to America
instead of to themselves, and that he
thought their country was a beautiful
country, and that he was gratified, he
might say pleasantly surprised, to find
such intelligent. industrious and
worthy persons abiding In it.
His interpreter followed him phrase
for phrase and doubtless lent his ut
terance something from the gracious
speech of Hawaii, for the native audi
ence bowed in their appreciation of his
parting compliments and sat expectant
of the next.
And the next was Repre tentative

Desire to Keep on Importing

BY HORACE WRIGHT.
Special Correspondence of ThÂ» Call.
HONOLULU, Aug. 31.â The Chinese
have set an example to the Hawaiians
In the matter of placing their wishes
in regard to Congressional legislation
for the newly acquired territory of
Hawaii before President McKinley's
Commissioners.
On Monday last Chinese Consular
Agent Goo Kirn Ful appeared before
the Commissioners with a memorial
signed by 180 of the leading Chinese
residents. The character of the legis-
lation they favor Is comprised within
the following prayer:
That in all matters pertaining to the
ownership of property and in all nersonal
rights they shull enjoy the same priv
ileges as the citizens or subjects of the
most favored nation, and as they have
hitherto enjoyed the same under the laws
of the Hawaiian Government.
That all Chinese wno have become nat
uralized undt-r the laws of Hawaii, and all
chuuren born in Hawaii of parents In
Whole or in part Chinese, be eligible to
become citizens of tne United Slates of
America on taking- an oath of allegiance
to the United States of America.
That they be permitted the right of
tranalt to and from all other parts of the
United States. That in the laws and reg
ulations affecting the Immigration of Chi
nese laborers special provision be made
for the importations from time to time
by the owners of rice plantations of a
limited number of Chinese laborers to
work such plantations. That the Chinese
be permitted to bring into this country
their children In China for the purposes of
education and employment, and to send
them to China for education or business
training for a limited number of years,
and also to bring In women of good char
acter.
That the Chinese merchants be permit
tea to Import clerks for their business es
tablishments. That in the matters of tax
ation and licensing and in the pursuit of
their occupations, whether professional,
mercantile or industrial, no discrimina
tion be made against them, and that they
be accorded the same privileges as are
given to other residents In the commu
nity. That the system of penal labor con
tracts be abolished.
It is felt on all hands that this Chi
nese problem is one of the most diffi
cult that the Commissioners will have
to face, for it will be practically im
possible to induce the Congress of the
United States to believe that conditions
exist here which would Justify the en
actment of special laws for this newly
acquired island domain.
It is painfully amusing to learn that
annexation came too quickly for our
planters to avail themselves of Minis
ter Cooper's act, rushed through on the
dying day of Hawaii's last Legislature,
permitting the Immigration of an un
limited number of Chinese, of whom It
Is now admitted, nearly 10,000 were
hoped for. While on this topic it may
be interesting to refer to the report of
Wray Taylor, inspector and secretary
of the Board of Immigration, a report
which the Government has been at
much pains to prevent publication. The
following passages are taken from It:
From all the plantations from Laupa
hoehoe to Hilo desertions have taken
place, and there is no doubt that In Olaa
and Kona a large number of the desert
ers could be found were a systematic
search to be made. In considering this
question as a whole there Is no doubt
that the coffee districts are a great at
traction for laborers, both free and con
tract. The work is lighter than on sugar
plantations and the wages higher. The
Japanese are paid $15 a month In Olaa.
Quite a number of Chinese are beginning
to get into this dietrlct. One way to stop
desertions might be a combination of the
sugar and coffee planters, but it would
have to be a thorough one to have any
effect. Soon after my return from this
trip I had a long talk with Mr. Inouye of
the Kumamoto Immigration Company,
who stated that the desertions of Japan
ese brought here by his company had
been a loss to them of about $3700, and de
sertions were still being reported. He was
very anxious, as were the other com
panies in the builness, to have an end
put to this wholesale desertion. Since
April 1 of this year I understand the
Japanese Government allows the immi
gration companies to exact a monetary
bond from each laborer before leaving
Japan sufficient to cover the amount of
the passage money, and in the event of
desertion the immigration company to
confiscate the money. As yet no laborers
have come in under this new agreement.
The companies hope by exacting the
monetary bond to lessen the desertions,
and another way will be to recruit la
borers from new districts men who have
never been to the islands before. Thi6
will necessitate the companies going to
the northern districts for men. The cry
from all the plantations is that they are
short of labor, and two new plantations
have just been started which will call for
a large number of laborers.
With regard to the ill-treatment of la
borers by lunas something certainly
should be done to protect these people, as
they come here with the guarantee from
the employer that they will have the full
and equal protection of the laws of the
Hawaiian Islands, and nowhere can it be
found on tne statutes that the laborers
have to be kicked and cuffed around by
a lot of ignorant lunas.
In conversation with some wealthy
land owners from the districts referred
to, I ascertained that the desertions
were still increasing In number, es
pecially among the Japanese, who
quietly but forcibly resisted the man
dates of their Consul, claiming that he
had no jurisdiction over them, now that
the countr" belonged the United States,
their contracts were illegal and void
and consequently they could work for
whomsoever they pleased.
CALISTOGA HAS A NEW
PETRIFIED FOREST
Important Discovery Hade by Miss
Honoria Tucraey, a Santa
Rosa Teacher.
SANTA ROSA. Sept. B.â Considerable
interest has been developed here in the re
cent discovery of a new petrified forest in
the neighborhood of Calistoga and some
distance from the foi'est which has for
years been recognized as one of the prin
cipal natural attractions of this county.
The find was made yesterday by Mi?s
Honoria P. Tuomey, a well-known teacher
of this city, who, with her brother, vat
exploring a hitherto unknown section of
the Calistoga hills, and the result is like
ly to prove of great value to the owners
of the property upon which the wonderful
petrifactions are situated.
Outcropplngs of such gigantic size have
been discovered that It seems more than
likely that the new forest may prove a
dangerous rival for Its older neighbor In
the feelings of the sight-seeing public. It
Is believed that the many mammoth trees
shown to be there will be uncovered at
once and the property developed as one of
the attractions of this section.

COMMISSIONERS
INVESTIGATING
HAWAIIAN ISLES
Morgan Says His Mission Is in
the Interests of the
Natives.
Many Rumors Concerning Discord in the Board,
but the Fact Remains That Business
Is Booming.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
HONOLULU, Aug. 31.â Within seven
days the Commissioners to recommend
legislation for the Hawaiian Islands
have visited two of our larger islands,
Hawaii and Maui, seen the volcano,
glanced at a few plantations and
schoolhouses, hobnobbed with native
Hawaiians, behaved very politely and
friendly to their campagnon de voyage.
Queen Liliuokalani, and delivered many
speeches, notable perhaps for the gen
eral kindly disposition and for the lack
of information on the very points the
people desired to know to obtain an
inkling of the probable form of future
government. Senator Morgan, much
to the surprise of many who vainly im
agine that he detests the Hawaiian as
much as any other dark skinned race,
is credited rightfully or wrongfully
with the following noble and natriotic
remarks in council: "Our mission here
is not in the interest of the Repub
lican, Democratic or Populist parties;
it is simply in the interest of the Ha
waiian people, their welfare and their
country." Most certainly the Commis
sioners themselves cannot be blamed if
the Hawaiian people do not respond to
their invitation and go before them and
tell them of their wishes, for they have
been very frank and cordi 1 in those
invitations, and to-day commence a
series of open sessions for the recep
tion of delegations or individuals hav
ing thoughts to utter.
The speeches made by them on their
rapid tour of inspection have, like those
of the inveterate campaign speaker,
considerable sameness.
The Commissioners will be enter
tained by the executive at dinner this
evening, and to-morrow an official visit
will be paid by them to Pearl Harbor.
Happily, Mr. Sewall has enabled me
to set at rest an unpleasant rumor to
the effect that the Hawaiian section of
the Government had expressed to him
a desire that the transports, when re
turning from Manila, should not call at
Honolulu. The mere existence of such
a rumor, earnestly canvassed by the
citizens and referred to by the local
press, indicates the dread the conserva
tive element has of an undesirable in
flux of immigrants, for which we are
totally unprepared. The exaggerated
advertising the country has very un
wisely had through the annexation
campaign threatens to do much harm
and wrong to many well intentioned
men anxious to seek their fortunes in a
new country, which unfortuna' ly af
fords no scope for their ambitions, un
less they bring enough money to live
upon or to invest discreetly. So seri
ous are the conditions that the Land
Agent of the Government has been
constrained to issue a formal circular
explanatory of existing conditions and
concluding with some sound advice to
intending immigrants in search of land
for location, as follows:
But if you wish to come after fully
considering the matter, and can bring
experience and energy, with enough capi
tal to nisure you against any danger at
want, and enable you to study the situ
ation on the ground before making a
final decision, it is safe to say that you
TROOPS WILL NOT
REACH MANILA
Arrivals at Honolulu to
Be Held There.
MERRIAM HAS SUCH ORDERS
THREE TRANSPORT LOADS NOW
ON THE ISLANDS.
In the Vicinity of Hawaii's Capital
There Is Some Trouble in Find
ing Accommodations for
All the Volunteers.
Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Aug. 31.â General Mer
riam stated yesterday afternoon that
his orders from Washington were to
hold everything at Honolulu until he
had heard from the Government again.
These instructions applied to the Ta
coma and her cargo of live stock, as
well as to the Arizona and her troops.
"Whether the Tacoma will go to Manila
or return to San Francisco no man this
side of the coast knows. It is not be
lieved here, however, that she will ever
reach the Philippines, inasmuch as the
terms of peace end the necessity for
cavalry animals there.
Arrangements are now making to put
the troops on the Arizona in camp at
the Kapiolani Park in case movements
are delayed by coming orders from the
War Department. This will mean
merely an extension of the present
camp to accommodate the recruits. The
commissary department at this post
is now thoroughly established and can
easily stand the additional strain. A
few of the Arizona men stopped at the
camp last night.
General Merriam is a true friend to
a cable for Honolulu. Unless all indi
cations fail he will urge upon the Gov
ernment at Washington the immedi
ate, pressing necessity for connecting
the islands with the mainland. It will
be urged as a military necessity of
great moment, especially in view of
the movement of all expeditionary
forces to this city. There seems a pos
sibility that the cable will follow the
troops quickly as a military preoau
tion, even if the line is sold after the
Philippine question is fully disposed of.
Yesterday the Arizona discharged a
large quantity of hay, intended for the
Tacoma's live stock at Manila. It will
be taken to the Iwllei pasture to-day.
will be welcome, and what ha 9 been â 
kindly country to others may prove so
to you.
The booming of sugar stocks and the
formation of several new plantations ol
large dimensions have apparently ne
cessitated the formation of a stock ex
change, which formally opens for busi
ness to-morrow, and only awaits cable
connection to place itself in direct com
munication with the stock boards of
the mainland. The initial price of a
seat at the board, limited to twelve, is
$1000.
At last, after much discussion and
dissension, the native Hawaiians are
beginning to see the wisdom and neces
sity of listening to the reouest of the
Commissioners for information as to
their views in connection with the fu
ture government of this country. They
are now busily organizing their socie
ties and conventions and preparing me
morials setting forth their views.
While the party lines between annexa
tionists and anti-annexationists, Gov
ernment employes and the "ruts," are
as bitterly drawn as ever, there will be
a unison of ideas in their petitions,
which, as previously foreshadowed by
The Call, will contain requests for a
form of government with a franchise
and equal rights in all respects for the
Hawaiian as for the white resident.
The whites rather welcome this divi
sion into strong parties of the native
Hawaiians, for they appreciate the fact
that with universal suffrage in the
hands of a united Hawaiian party the
Hawaiians would invariably hold the
preponderating influence at the elec
tions. It is whispered that politics is
already beginning to show its presence
in the commission, and that irate words
have been exchanged at the council
board between the advocates of the
District of Columbia form of govern
ment and those favoring the territorial,
but as all connected with the commis
sion are pledged to inviolable secrecy
it is somewhat surprising that such
statements, with a considerable quan
tity of other information, important if
true, should be allowed to le^k out.
Some people even go so far as to de
fine the position of each Commissioner
and to intimate that the Commission
ers are only wasting their time here, as
their minds were made up before they
left the Golden Gate. Be this at it
may, a fairy tale is current of um
brage taken by the Commissioners at
the lack of respect paid to them by the
members of the Hawaiian Government
in not dul- honoring them by meeting
them on their return from their brief
trip to the other islands. As they had
Cabinet Ministers with them, surely
they might have excused their brother
Commissioner and the other Ministers
from golner down to the steamer. A
question of etiquette of precedence, it
is said, also arose between our chief
executive and Senator Cullom, the
chairman of the commission, which
caused a momentary reserve. All these
little disagreeablenesses naturally pro
ceed from the evaporation of energy
and disintegration of the moral forces
after the only partially exploded en
thusiasm of annexation; or perhaps
from that tired feeling of satiety.
Over a hundred tons of supplies lor
Honolulu were also discharged.
It would take about three weeks
more to complete the repairs to the
Tacoma's boilers and condenser If work
were continued. Orders were received
yesterday to stop the work, however,
and nothing further will be done until
word is received by the Scandia, due
next Thursday, as to the movements of.
the Tacoma and its cargo.
Colonel Barber said yesterday after
noon that he did not know how the
6000 men under General Merrlam could
be comfortably quartered here. "We
have experienced the greatest difficulty
in locating the 1700 under me," said the
colonel. "A board of engineer officers
has been at work for days endeavoring"
to locate a suitable site, but as yet
have not settled upon a place. And
when It comes to arranging a camp
for 6000 men â well, I don't know what
can be done."
The steamship Alliance of the John
son-Locke line arrived here on the
27th. She left San Francisco at 4:30 p.
m. on the 18th, bringing a mall and
five-day later papers.
On the Alliance are Companies F, Q
and H of the First New York, under
command of Captain U. A. Ferguson.
Chaplain Earl Swartz is on the Alli
ance, also Chief Surgeon Major Davis,
who has an order to establish a forty
bed hospital in Honolulu, for which,
there is a complete outfit on board.
The Arizona, the largest vessel on
the Pacific, arrived off port about 9
o'clock Saturday night, and came up
to the Pacific Mail wharf early Sun
day morning. She made a quick trip
of a trifle over six days. She brought
the Third Battalion of Eighteenth In
fantry recruits for the First Colorado,
First Montana, Tenth Pennsylvania
and Third Artillery, In all 1206 men, be
sides General Merriam and a Red
Cross corps.
General King's first orders to the
troops after arrival here was In re
lation to shore leave, which he said
would depend on their own good con
duct. Until further orders liberty
hours will be from noon to 11 o'clock,
the time to be divided into five watches,
a fifth of each company to be on shor#
at one time.
The Arizona will remain here until
the Scandia arrives, probably next
Thursday.
The men of the Arizona were enter
tained at luncheon yesterday by the la
dies of Honolulu.
SOLANO'S SCHOOL FXTND.
Necessitates an Increase in the
County's Tax Levy.
SUISUN, Sept. B.â At a meeting of the
Board of Supervisors of Solano County
Superintendent Sanborn stated that the
minimum amount of the county school
fund required for the ensuing year -was
$25,356. On motion of Supervisor Berg
wall of Vallejo the amount was increased
$6000, and the Auditor was instructed to
include this amount in his estimate of
this year's tax levy. The trustees of the
Vacaville and Vallejo High schools pre
sented their estimates of $4925 and $5000
respectively for the maintenance of
those high schools for the ensuing year.
The Auditor was instructed to include
these amounts also in his estimate for
the tax levy.

ATHENS, Sept. B.â The following dis
patch dated at 8 o'clock this evening
has been received from Candia: "The
Bashi Bazouks are committing: ex
cesses and Christians in the surround
ing districts are arming to march to
the assistance of the Canaians. There
are eight warships in the harbor and a
fresh bombardment is expected. The
British, German and Spanish consul
ates have been looted and thus far 300
native Christians and sixty-seven Brit
ish subjects have been killed."
The Asty says It learns from an au
thentic source that as soon as the Brit
ish troops arrive at Candia from Malta
the Turkish garrison in Candia will be
expelled, martial law proclaimed and
the ring 1 leaders of the riot put on trial
and publicly hanged if found guilty.
According to a dispatch from Candia
Bent late this evening the admirals of
the international fleet have decided to
compel the disarming of the Bashi Ba
zouks and the surrender of the Instiga
tors of the disorder.
CANDIA, Island of Crete, Sept. B.â A
detachment of international troops,
which has just arrived here has occu
pied the fortifications and restored or
der. It is now estimated that 200 per
sons were killed during the rioting. The
Mussulman troops protected the Chris
tians placed under their care, but they
did not attempt to prevent the pillage
of Christian house?, which continued
until the international troops arrived.
LONDON, Sept. B.â The correspond
ent of the Times at Candia, telegraph
ing Wednesday, fully confirms the
earlier reports of most serious events
there. He says:
"Lieutenant Haldallne and Lieuten
ant Seagrave were wounded. The sol
diers pluckily carried Lieutenant Hal
daline's body to the boat under a hail
of bullets. The telegraph office was re
peatedly set on fire and the father of
the telegraph superintendent was
killed. The wire is still working.
"The worst is feared as to the fate of
a majority of tho Christians. It is re
ported that only 250 have been saved
out of over 1000. The situation was ex
tremely difficult. The Turkish troops
refused to aid the British, who, being
exceedingly few in the town, were soon
overpowered. The forty wounded were
attended to by the warships.
"The necessity for a large garrison in
Candia had been repeatedly pointed
out, and the blame lies in the quarter
responsible for leaving, against heavy
odds, a handful of men to protect our
occupation and enforce our authority.
The Mohammedans are pillaging Can

The Times correspondent, telegraph
ing later, says: "Refugees are now
coming on board the Camperdown,
many of them wounded. They tell a
tale of great massacre."
The president of the Cretan Execu
tive Committee has notified the foreign
admirals thjit, in view of the massacre
at Candia, it is impossible to continue
the effort to organize an administra
tion until the Turkish functionaries
and troops are withdrawn. He de
mands the convocation of the Cretan
Assembly and proposes to place a
force of Cretans at the disposal of the
international administration.
The correspondent of the London
Standard, telegraphing Thursday from
the British battleship Camperdown, off
Candia, says:
The refugees tell ghastly stories of
massacres. They report that no fewer
than 700 Christians are missing. Sev
eral attempts were made last night to
set on fire the office of the Eastern
Telegraph Company. It has been ascer
tained that all the houses overlooking
the British camp were loopho-led for
rifle fire and barricaded.
This shows clearly that the outbreak
was preconcocted.
The behavior and attitude of the
Turkish troops have been and still are
inexplicable. Without going so far as
to assert that they took part in the
attack an our troops â though many
people are ready to affirm that they
actually saw the Sultan's soldiers fir
ing on our soldiersâ it is impossible to
contradict the positive fact that they
made no attempt to render assistance.
Every Christian survivor of the mas
sacre swears that the butchery was
mostly the work of Turkish soldiers,
who first robbed and then slew their
victims.
Edhem Pasha is the man who ought
to be held primarily responsible. Had
he wished to prevent bloodshed he
would most certainly have done so.
Not until the British troops under
Colonel Reid had been fighting hard for
four hi/urs did Edhem, with his Turkish
soldiers, arrive upon the scene. He had
then the effrontery to say that he had
only just heard that the British troops
were being attacked by thousands of
Bashi Bazouks. It is needless to com
ment on this brazen-faced excuse.
It is enough to say that Edhem Pasha
must have known what was happening
from the moment the first shot was
fired, if, indeed, he did not arrange the
plot himself.
LONDON, Sept. 9.â The corespondent
of the Times at Candia telegraphing
Thursday, says:
"It is estimated that no fewer than
800 Christians have been massacred and
the town has been pillaged by Bashi

reports agree as to the disgraceful be
havior of the Turkish troops.

Spain intends to bargain at the Paris
Peace Conference to retain part of the

somehow prevails that a republic -will
be established there under the protec

it is claimed, of destroying the mili
tary preponderance of the Government
The Spanish Cabinet at its meeting
this morning decided to take the most
stringent measures to prevent the pub
lication of the proceedings of the Cor
tes, and to provide for the censorship of
telegraphic dispatches.
The newspapers assert that the Gov
ernment is greatly surprised and cha
grined at the attitude of the Conserva
tives In the Chamber, which indicates
that the Ministry is isolated on a mat
ter of .such magnitude as the conclu
sion of the peace treaty.
Continuing, the Spanish papers ex
press the opinion that this foreshadows
the downfall of the Ministry.
It appears that many of the Govern

RENO, Sept. B.â When the Demo
cratic convention was called to order
by Chairman Webber this afternoon
the first bombshell of the battle ex
ploded when the committee on creden
tials reported that about forty dele
gates were not entitled to seats in the
convention.
A motion appointing a conference
committee to confer with the Silver
party forces upon fusion was lost.
Dennis of Washoe, chairman o-f the
committee on platform and resolutions,
moved for a reconsideration, and his
motion was carried. Adjourned until
10 o'clock to-morrow morning.
The Silver party State convention
was called to order by Secretary N. W.
Roff shortly after 11 o'clock this morn
ing and a temporary organization was
effected by the election of J. F. Mc-
Dowell of Storey as temporary chair
man, L. U. Updike and John Pugh sec
retaries and John Robb and C. A.
Richardson sergeant-at-arms.
At 2 o'clock Judge Bonnfield of the
Supreme Bench was selected as perma
nent chairman.
At the evening session the discord
among the delegates was shown in the
attempt of Chairman Coming of White
Pine to submit his partial report on
platform and resolutions. He recom
mended an adjournment to give the
committee time to complete its report
and to allow the minority to submit
their views to the convention.
Sharon of Storey moved that the
platform be adopted at once. He had
assurances that it had been completed
and wanted it disposed of immediately.
After a vigorous discussion on both
sides in which there were cries of fraud
and jobbery, the motion was lost.
A motion that a committee of five be
appointed to confer with a like com
mittee which it is expected the Demo
cratic convention will appoint on the
matter of fusion was carried. The con
vention then adjourned until 10 o'clock
to- morrow.

Spain's Bill for Conclu
sion of Peace.
!T REVIEWS THE LATE WAR
TELLS HOW THE NATION HAD
TO UPHOLD ITS "HONOB."
After a Long Preamble the Ministers
Ask the Cortes to Give Them
Permission to Surren
der Colonies.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Sept. 9.â According to the
Madrid correspondent of the Times the
following is the text of the bill au
thorizing the Government to conclude
peace:
"The reverses suffered by our arms in
the unequal struggle to which we were
driven in order to defend the honor of
the nation and maintain its rights de
prived us at an early stage of the ele
ments required for continuing the war.
'"The bravery of our soldiers and sail
ors proved insufficient, as did the calm
attitude of the nation, ever ready to
shed its blood and sacrifice its resources
for the honor of the Spanish flag.
"Separated by wide seas from the
territories it was our object to protect,
and these territories being closely
blockaded, so that our few remaining
ships could not reach them, Her Ma
jesty's Government has been compell
ed to admit the bitter truth, that an
end must be put to the war.
"The sense of responsibility entailed
by the preliminary peace negotiations
had weighed heavily on the Govern
ment. Notwithstanding it fully appre
ciated its duty toward the country, the
Government has had to consent to
these preliminary negotiations and to
bow to the cruel sacrifices imposed by
sheer necessity.
"For this reason and because peace
must be purchased at the cost of a
cession of territory and the abandon
ment of sovereign rights, the Govern
ment has thought it expedient to sound
the Cortes before concluding the treaty
the ratification of which will be duly
notified to both chambers in accordance
with constitutional law.
"The Government, whose moderate
language will not be " \ind fault with
by the representatives of the nations
limits itself to submitting to the Cortes
the following bill, whose first and only
article is:
"The Government is authorized to
renounce rights of sovereignty and to
cede territory in the Spanish colonies
in accordance with the peace prelimi
naries agreed., upon with the Govern
ment of the United States of America."
The Times' corespondent says the bill
is signed by all the Ministers.

COLORADO'S BIG
FACTIONAL WAR
Signs of Order Coming
Out of Chaos.
TELLER'S CHANCES BRIGHTER
THREE OF THE FOUR PARTIES
SUPPORT HIM.
Anti-Tellerites Adopt Resolutions,
Nominate a Full State
Ticket and Then
Adjourn.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Sept.
B.â At the end of the first day's meet
ing of the four State conventions here
the situation seems no clearer than
yesterday. The chance 3 for fusion be
twen the Democrats, Populists and Tel
ler branch of the Silver Republican
party appear a little brighter, judging
from actions taken by the different
conventions.
According to an agreement reached
last night neither faction of the Silver
Republicans attempted to meet in the
opera house. The fusionists gathered
in Durkee Hull and chose Senator Tel
ler as temporary chairman.
Mr. Teller made an address of two
hours' length, in which he traced the
history of the Silver Republican party
and denounced President McKinley and
his B&pporters as enemies of silver. He
spoke on some of the phases of the late
war, claiming that it would not have
have been necessary had the President
listened to the plea of Congress when
it asked for the recognition of Cuban
belligerency. He created great enthu
siasm by a vigorous advocacy of the
annexation of the Philippines.
J. M. Downing of Pitkin County was
made permanent chairman, and a com
mittee was chosen to meet with simi
lar committees from the Democratic
and Populist conventions to arrange
for a fusion ticket.
After this National Chairman Charles
A. Towne addressed the convention.
He defended his action in deposing
State Chairman Broad, who, he
claimed, had arranged to turn the ma
chinery of the party in the State over
to the McKinley Republicans.
The following committee was named
to negotiate for fusion: Senator Henry
M. Teller cf Gilpln, John W. Wing of
San Juan, A. M. Stevenson of Arapa
hoe, Orsion A. Adams of Mesa, J. M.
Maxwell of Boulder, W. T. Leggett of
El Paso and C. W. Lake of Jefferson.
The convention then adjourned until 10
o'clock to-morrow
The anti-Teller faction met at Co
burn Hall and elected Judge Dixon first
as temporary and later as permanent
chairman.
While waiting -for the report of the
committee on resolutions, ex-Congress
man J. B. Belford addressed the con
vention. He said he was tired of being
a political tramp and wanted to get
back with the Republican party. He
said Senator Teller had repeatedly
stated his purpose of devoting the re
mainder of his life to the destruction of
the Republican party, and predicted
that he would fail. He said if silver"
was ever remonetized it must be
through the Republican party.
B. Clark Wheeler of Aspen, nominee
for Congress in the Second District,
spoke brielly, after which Judge Hilton
of Denver made an address. He as
serted that Senator Teller has not been
the friend of silver that he has claimed
to be, and paid a tribute to "the un
conquerable and matchless Wolcott"
which was applauded. He said he was
tired of being a political maverick and
proposed to follow "a new light In the
east," which had recently appeared to
him.
At the night session of the anti-Tel
ler Republicans the opposition to the
nomination of Guggenheim vyas with
drawn and he was nominated for Gov
ernor by acclamation.
"When the convention reassembled the
resolutions committee reported a plat
form, which was adopted. The most
important planks were as follows:
Resolved, That we favor the restoration
of the money of the constitution by
throwing open the mints of the country to
the free coinage of gold and silver at the
ratio of 16 to 1; that we commend the pa
triotism, skill and ability displayed by the
present administration during the trying
times of the late war with Spain and are
proud of the achievements of our army
and navy in the victories over the enemy,
especially the bravery and patriotism dis
played by the Colorado volunteers In the
Philippines, and the daring courage of the
Seventh Infantry at Santiago; that We are
unqualifiedly In favor of keeping forever
the American flag wherever it has been
unfurled to the breeze, whether as a re
sult of conquest or peaceable acquirement.
The construction of the Nicaragua
canal by the Federal Government is
favored. Fusion with other parties Is
condemned. National Chairman Towne
is strongly denounced for his action in
attempting to remove Chairman
Broad, and his authority to do so i 3
disputed.
The following ticket was then
named:
viovernorâ Simon Guggenheim of Den
ver; Lieutenant Governor â Ira Bloom
field of Rio Grande County; Secretary of
Stateâ Joseph W. Millsom of Fremont
County; Treasurer â Harry Mulnix of
Denver; Auditorâ John A. Wayne of Weld
County; Attorney General â H. M. Hogg
of San Miguel County; Superintendent of
Public Instructionâ Mrs. Mayme Marble
of Denver. For regents of the State Uni
versity E. J. Temple, J. W. Gunnell and
Dr. J. H. Perching were named.
The convention then adjourned sine
die.
The Democratic convention elected
E. C. Stimson of Cripple Creek perma I
nent chairman and chose its commit
tees, including one on fusion. It also
listened to a speech by Charles A.
Towne, national chairman of the Sil
ver Republicans, who was invited to
address them.
The Populists met at 3 o'clock and
chose Lyman I. Henry of Ouray as
temporary chairman.
After the reports of the usual com
mittees Mr. Henry was made perma
nent chairman and the following fu
sion committee was named: T. M. Pat
terson of Arapahoe, Senator Porter
field of Pueblo, Representative Hart of
Eagle, P. A. Wheeler of Mineral, H. S.
Tompkins of Chaffee, Frank Madden of
Weld and John Gray. After passing a
resolution inviting National Chairman
Towne of the Silver Republicans to ad
dress them to-morrow the convention
adjourned till 12 o'clock to-morrow.

SENATOR McBRIDE TO
SECRETARY ALGER.
Reports Dissatisfaction Over Detention of
Oregon Recruits in This City.
Relief Promised.
PORTLAND, Or., Sept. B.â The following telegraphic correspond
ence is self-explanatory:
Hon. R. A. Alger, Secretary of "War, Washington, D. C. â There is
general dissatisfaction respecting the quarters and detention of the
Oregon recruits at San Francisco. They should either be sent to
Alanila to Join their regiment or be mustered out. They have been
kept at San Francisco for months, while other troops have been
sent to Manila, where the Oregon regiment is stationed.
GEORGE W. McBRIDE, United States Senator.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Sept. 5.
Hon. George W. McÃride, United States Senator, St. Helens, Or.â
Tour telegram saying that there is gerieral dissatisfaction respecting
the quarters and detention of the' Oregon troops at San Francisco
received. The signing of the protocol prevented sending these men
to their regiments. We have talcen steps to ascertain if they can be
comfortably placed in Honolulu waiting any further need of troops in
the Philippines. If a good camp ground is found they will be sent
as indicated; otherwise they will be sent home to be mustered out.
R. A. ALGER, Secretary of War.
ALGER WANTS AN
INVESTIGATION
Joined by the Adjutant
General.
DESIRES A COURT-MARTIAL
PBESIDENT HAS BEACHED NO
DECISION.
Beviews the Question in All Its
Phases and May Come to a
ifonclu6ion at To-Day 's
Cabinet Meeting.
Special Dispatch to The Cail.
WASHINGTON, Sept. B.â Secretary
Alger has requested the President to
order a thorough and searchinr inves
tigation of the War Department. In
this request the Secretary has been
joined by Adjutant General Corbin. No
decision has been reached yet by the
President, who has the request of
Secretary Alger under consideration,
but has not yet determined whether he
Win grant It or not.
Secretary Alger had a long confer
ence with the President to-night be
fore he left the city, and impressed
upon him his earnest desire that a
courtmartial should be ordered. The
question was thoroughly discussed in
all its phases. Secretary "Wilson par
ticipated in the conference and General
Corbin was present during a part of the
time. It now seems not unlikely that
the court of inquiry will be ordered,
but it is the wish of the President to
further consider the matter before an
nouncing a definite policy.
The question probably will receive
consideration at the Cabinet meeting
to-morrow. General Griggs is among
those who will not be present at to
morrow's meeting. It is the wish of the
President to take up all the particulars
of the controversy.
Should the investigation be ordered,
it will include, probably, all matters re
lating to the conduct of the war, so
far as they concern the War Depart
ment. Secretary Alger expresses him
self as confident that such an investi
gation, if conducted promptly and thor
oughly, will result in much good.
Such an investigation as has been re
quested is, it is pointed out, beset with
some difficulties. No charges of a defi
nite character have been filed by any
responsible person or official. Sensa
tional stories and rumors, for which the
administration has present knowledge
that there is no foundation, have been
circulated and objection is made to
dignifying them by the ordering of an
investigation. By those who desire and
advocate the investigation it is main
tained it can do no possible harm and
the controversy will be of benefit in
clearing away manifest errors from the
minds of many people and in placing
the blame, if any is to be placed, where
it rightfully belongs.
GRAND PARADE OF
THE THOROUGHBREDS
Great Array of Fine Horses and Cat-
tle Exhibited on the Agricul
tural Park Course.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. B.â The ex
quisite thoroughbred, the stylish road
ster, the team of high-steppers, the
mammoth shire horse of England, the
gigantic Clydesdale, the substantial
looking Cleveland bay, the heavy but
handsome Norman and Percheron, the
pretty but massive French and German
coach horse, the homely but costly
Spanish jack and meek cattle of the
best-known breedg (Jersey, Holstein,
Hereford, Durham, etc.) went to make
up a procession this morning that
stretched almost around the mile course
at Agricultural Park.
Nearly the entire lot had been en
tered for premiums and they were
grand representatives of the various
well established breeds of horses and
cattle.
The thoroughbred stallion Torso,
winner of many a great race, and sire
of a score or more of high class ones,
was perhaps the most admired of all
the horses in the parade, but a two
year-old bright bay colt by imp. Ar
tillery from Banewor'e dam had a host
looking upon him with longing eyes.
There were brood mares with young
foals at th -r sides, yearlings that had
begun to look like Foxhalls in minia
ture and two-year-olds that showed
there was plenty of fire in them as the
band struck up a lively air. The youth
ful trotters stuck to their gait going
around the track, while the heavier
breeds arched their necks and tried to
look as proud as Lucifer. â 
There were eight teams driven in the
procession, eleven handsome single rigs
caught the eye, while six sportily in
clined horsemen had their representa
tives hitched to sulkies.
The largest herd was the Brightons
(of Shorthorns), seventeen in all. Frank
H. Burke of Ban Francisco had nine
handsome Holsteins on the march and
the Yerba Buena ranch was repre
sented by nine sleek looking Jerseys.
The Judging will begin on Saturday
and be finished by next Wednesday
evening, when the premium winners
will be known.

OAKLAND, PIEDMONT AND
ATHENS PARLORS THERE
Native Sons From Alameda County
Are Joyously Greeted Upon
Beaching San Jose.
SAN JOSE, Sept. B.â Oakland, Athens
and Piedmont parlors, 700 strong, came
in with a prolonged shout, arriving on
a narrow gauge special at 11 o'clock.
The Garden City drum corps, accom
panied by detachments from the local
parlors, was at the narrow gauge sta
tion to meet and greet the Native Sons
from Alameda County. A long line of
electric cars was in waiting to trans
port the ladies from the depot to the
central section of the brilliantly il
luminated city. Many of the daughters
avaiied themselves of the privilege of
marching in column and shooting
Roman candles, while the sons carried
the luggage and shouted. A deal of
marching was done to the tune of "A
Hot Time in the Old Town."
There was a notable lack of precision
in the formation of the procession at
the narrow gauge station. The Pied
mont band contributed some of the
music, but the music was not heard by
the musicians owing to the volume of
shouting and yelling by incoming Sops
of the Golden West Marching up San
ta Clara street the Alameda Parlors
came in friendly contact with the roar
ing sons from the peninsula of San
Francisco. Then the natives dwelling
in the Santa Clara Valley did realize
that the conditions were highly favor
able for a hot time in the old town to
night As midnight approaches the
enthusiasm increases. First street is
lurid and smoky. The Native Daugh
ters belonging to some of the parlors
go arm in arm with their escorts and
participate Joyously in the animated
scenes.

NEW YORK, Sept. B.â The Herald's Washington correspondent
telegraphs: Major Coneral Miles will not pursue the controversy
over the conduct of the war further. He is willing, after having
made the statement 'a the American people printed this morning, to
let the matter rest where it is. This seems to be the disposition of the
administration also.
There was a conference at the White House to-night between the
President, Secretary -Jger, Secretary Wilson and Adjutan'; General
Corbln. which lasted two hours. The President is anxious, if possi
ble, that harmony should be restored between the head of the War
Department and the commanding general of the army, and one pur
pose of the conference to-night was that object.
General Miles told me to-night that he did not intend to do any
thing further. He seemed perfectly content to allow the matter to
rest as he has left it in his statement, and will go about his duties as
commanding general of the army.

matter of admission of Chinese women
to this country, which will result in
the shutting out of a large class here

NOW COMMANDER
OF GRAND ARMY
Elected at the Annual Encamp
ment of the Veterans of
the Nation.
Corporal Tanner Scores Commissioner of Pen
sions Evans for Making Certain
Rulings.
CINCINNATI, Sept. B.â lllinois and
Pennsylvania are*celebrating their vic
tories at the respective headquarters
to-night. The one has secured the
commander-ln-chief in Colonel James
Sexton of Chicago, and the other the
location of the thirty-thirJ annual en
campment of the G. A. R. at Philadel
phia next year.
While heated contests were going on
inside the guarded doors of the en
campment all the demonstrations on
the outside in the city were In accord
with the peace jubilee. The parade of
the civic and industrial organizations
in the afternoon with all the illustra
tions of peace and prosperity and hap
piness thp.t could be produced was the
most magnificent pageant ever wit
nessed in this city. It is estimated
that there were 40,000 in line, and over
half a million spectators along the line.
There were more people In the city to
day than at any time of the week or
any other day in the history of the city.
With the river fronts and the parks
and Camp Sherman ablaze to-night
with most elaborate flrewoiks the dem
onstrations are ended, but special en
tertainments have been provided for to
morrow evening in excursions on the
river and displays at the summer re
sorts.
The National Encampment elected
only its commander-in-chief to-day,
and will elect its other officers to-mor
row, adopt its resolutions and attend to
other business.
The auxiliaries of the ladies elect
their officers to-morrow also and com
plete their annual encampment.
There were about 1200 national dele
gates present when the encampment
proper was called to order at Music
Hall at 10 a. m., with Charles Went
zel as officer of the day. The welcom
ing address was delivered by Governor
Bushnell of Ohio, with supplemental
addresses by Mayor Tafel of Cincin
nati, M. E. Ingalls, chairman of the
citizens' committee and president of
the Big Four and Chesapeake and Ohio
railways, and Director General W. B.
Melish. In his response Commander-ln-
Chief Go-bin referred eloquently to the
attractions of the week and the lavish
entertainment of the citizens of Cin
cinnati. General Gobin wore the fine
gold watch and chain that had been
presented to him at the camp fire last
night by his old comrades of the Forty
seventh Pennsylvania Regiment, and
on the assembling of the encampment
he was presented with a fine gavel
made of historic timber.
At the conclusion of these interesting
preliminaries the great hall was cleared
of all but the members entitled to a
voice in the proceedings, and in execu
tive session various reports were sub
mitted. Commander-in-Chief Gobin
said in part:
As comrades of the Grand Army of the
Republic we can overlook the events of
the year just passed with feelings of con
gratulation and just pride. To our fellow
soldiers and sailors of the present era we
extend our congratulations as heartily as
it is in our power to do so, recognizing,
as wo do, that our organization and our
teachings during the last thirty years
have been effective in preparation for this
glorious result.
To our esteemed comrade. President Wil
liam McKinley and his Secretary of War,
our past commander-in-chief R. A. Al
gpr, we have given our individual and or
ganized support in the arduous duties im
posed upon them. Never in the world's
history has there been an occasion when
the experience of leaders In national strife
rendered them so thoroughly competent
to meet the difficulties encountered.
The congratulations of the Grand Army
of the Republic, aye, of the nation, are
due them, and from this present encamjk
ment there should go forward no uncer
tain words as to our united support to
the Government in solving the difficult
problems before them. Confident are we
that the result will Justify the supreme
faith which we repose in these, our com
rades, and through their efforts we be
lieve the nation will continue under the
providence of Almighty God to the higher
position which he has evidently designed
for it.
Referring to his visits to departments
in the South, the commander-in-chief
said:
In the South the greeting of ex-Con
federates who participated in many of
our campfires was exceedingly agree
able and was preliminary to the devo
tion to country and flag manifested in
their resnonse to the caff of the Presi
dent, v/ne feature, however, which
<ould not but impress me is the fact
that the color line still exists. There
are many colored soldiers in some of the
departments laboring under great dis
advantages. The race prejudice remains,
and the chasm seems to be widening: it
seems impossible to overcome it, and for
this I can only express my extreme re
gret. What the remedy is, if any, I am
unable to suggest.
General Gobin discussed the pension
question at length, and said:
All that the old soldier demands Is
that the existing pension laws be ad
ministered with justice and liberality
In accordance with the laws when enact
ed, and which were made to provide for
the soldier an- relieve his necessities to
THIRTY PER CENT
DOWN WITH FEVER
Typhoid Spreads Among Our
Troops in and Around Ponce,
Porto Rico.
PONCE, Porto Rico, Sept. B.â lllness among the United States
troops here is increasing. There are now more than 25 per cent of the
men unfit for duty. Within a radius of a few miles from Ponce are
1000 soldiers in hospitals. In some commands 30 per cent of the
men are down with fever, principally typhoid.
The City of Chester arrived to-day with medical supplies and forty
six nurses. The surgeons here are handling the patients as well as
possible. Considering conditions the percentage of deaths is small.
Convalescents, however, have ths climate to contend with, and
after the fever has left them patients then fail to recover their
strength. They should be sent north at once.
The need for transports for the convalescent and hospital ships
Is imperative. If there is more wet weather the conditions will be
come much worse.
the full extent to which he is entitled.
This is "due him, an^ there should be no
cavil or question about his receiving it.
In his report Alfred Lyth, the senior
vice-commander-in-chief, referred to
the visit of Post No. 2, Department of
New York, to Hamilton, Ont., saying
that the cheers which greeted the
comrades on arrival and the reception
on the part of the citizens of Hamilton
were illustrations of the recent draw
ing together in sympathy and feeling
of the two great English-speaking na
tions.
The report of the adjutant general,
Thomas J. Stewart, contained the fol
lowing figures as to the membership:
The members in good standing June
30, 1897, numbered 319,456. The gain
during the year was, by muster in,
10,940; transfer, 4275; reinstatement,
12,687; from delinquent reports, 4551;
total, 32,453. The losses were, by death,
7383; honorable discharge, 1190; trans
fer, 4471; suspension, 25,033; dishonor
able discharge, 165; by delinquent re
ports, 7041; by surrender of charter,
1026; total, 46,306. So the members in
good standing June 30, 1898. numbered
305,603. The number of members re
maining suspended at that date was
36,668. Reports received from depart
ments showed that 8610 members pre
viously reported as suspended had
been dropped from the rolls. The
amount expended in charity during the
year was $171,903.
The report of the quartermaster gen
eral, A. J. Burbank, showed that the
receipts during the year were $17,195
and the expenditures $14,694, the bal
ance on hand being $9902.
Alonzo Williams, inspector general,
reported that the organization is still
strong and in good condition, although
rapidly decreasing in numbers. It was
still doing very efficient work through
out the land.
When the annual reports were being
read, especially Gobin's, there was con
siderable cheering at the mention of
President McKinley's name, but when
the name of Secretary Alger was men
tioned in connection with the recent
war there was an uproarious demon
stration in his favor. After the reports
had been referred to their respective
committees, many resolutions were of
fered specifically Indorsing the admin
istration of General Alger in the War
Department The temper of the en
campment, as shown to-day, indicates
that the resolutions will indorse the
management of the recent war.
A resolution was introduced to have
the school histories use the term of
"the war between the States," instead
of the "war of the rebellion." It is
quite likely that resolutions will be
adopted providing for the use of the
term of "war for the preservation of
the Union." There will also be an effort
made to secure representation for the
colored men in the national encamp
ment.
The first business in order at the
afternoon session was a lengthy report
from the committee oil pensions. It
cited the facÂ£ that extensive investiga
tions had been undertaken by the de
partments of different States, and after
close inquiry there had not been a
single case of fraud discovered which
could be traced to a member of the
Grand Army of the Republic.
The report made a somewhat ex
tended comparison of the work accom
plished now and during the last year
of the administration of General Grant.
This showed that the efficiency of the
department in the way of prompt dis
posal of claims had been vastly in
creased. The committee gave figures
showing that the death rate was rap
idly increasing among pensioners. It
is estimated that the increase in the
number of deaths will be such that in
1920 the number of pensions will be re
duced to a little over 250,000, and that in
1940 the list will be obliterated.
When a motion was made to accept
and adopt the report .Corporal Tanner
of New York arose to discuss it. He
said that in the main he agreed with
all the committee had reported, but
with that portion of the report which
dealt with the administration of the
pensions officers he did not agree, and
he went on to speak in criticism of the
present Commissioner of Pensions, Hon.
H. Clay Evans. With evident feeling
he said:
'VI stand ready to be responsible here
arfa elsewhere for all statements I may
mfeke on this subject and I declare that
Commissioner Evans called his chiefs
of divisions together and using lan
guage which indicated intense feeling,
if not anger, instructed them to disre
gard totally every application based
on deafness or rheumatism. He fur
ther intimated that if any one declined
to accept his suggestion he would find
chiefs who would obey his orders."
Corporal Tanner declared that in his
opinion it was clear that the man who
would make such an order had him
self never heard the sound of cannon
nor slept in the open air, and h a . was
not surprised, therefore, to find that
the Commissioner of Pensions had an
army record which consisted of three
months and sixteen days as a sergeant
in the commissary department.
A delegate from Kansas followed
Tanner in the same strain. The mat
ter was disposed of finally by postpon
ing it until after the report of the com
mittee on resolutions should be re-
ceived.
Business was interrupted by the en
trance of a committee of three ladies
from the Woman's National Relief
Corps, headed by Mrs. Martin, the Na
.tional president.
Mrs. Martin stated that when the call
for help arising from the war with
Spain came she had no authority to
use the funds of the corps in that way,
but she took the responsibility of send
ing out a call for an emergency fund
and in this way had collected a large
sum of money which was immediately
applied to relieve the wants of our sol
diers. She closed by requesting the
national encampment to give the Re
lief Corps authority to change its con
stitution so that its funds can be used
for the relief of soldiers serving in the
war with Spain. The resolution was
referred to the committee on resolu
tions.
This was followed by a delegation
from the Sons of Veterans, Senator
Thurston of Nebraska being the
speaker. He made a brief but eloquent
speech on behalf of the Sons of Vet
erans.
A still further interruption of regular
business was the presentation to ex-
Commander-in-Chief Clarkson of Ne
braska of a magnificent silver set in an
oaken case. The ex-commander, with
deep feeling, made a response express
ing his thanks for the high honor shown
him.
The choice of the place for the next
encampment was then taken up. The
pending question was upon substitut
ing Denver for Philadelphia. Com
mander May of Denver spoke for his
locality, saying that $50,000 had been
already pledged for the entertainment
of the encampment. He promised to
the delegates and their wives a three
days' trip through the mountains about
Denver free of cost and gave alluring
promises of favorable railroad rates.
He was followed by a delegate from
Pittsburg, who made an equally elo
quent plea for Philadelphia, balancing
the se.ashore against Denver's moun
tains and naming all the natural ad
vantages of Philadelphia. When the
time came for voting it was suggested
that instead of voting to substitute
Denver for Philadelphia votes should
be taken directly by calling the roll and
letting the delegates vote for their
choice. This was done, and the result
was: Philadelphia 359, Denver 295.
A motion was made afterward to go
into the election of commander-in
chief. Although it was then late in the
afternoon the motion was adopted, and
immediately the name of Alfred D.
Shaw of Watertown, N. V.. was pre
sented by a delegate of that State.
General John C. Black of Illinois
placed in nomination James A. Sexton
of Chicago. Other candidates were an
nounced. The roll of States was called
and the vote announced, showing the
election of James A. Sexton, who re
ceived 424 votes, while Albert D. Shaw
received 241. Sexton being called, re
turned his thanks in very brief form,
and the encampment immediately ad
journed until 9 o'clock to-morrow.
The commander-elect entered the
volunteer army in 1861 as a private in
the Sixty-seventh Illinois. Later he at
tained the rank of captain in the Sev
enty-second Illinois, and still later be
came colonel of the regiment. At the
close of the war he was serving upon
the staff of Major General A. J. Smith,
commander of the Sixteenth Army
Corps. Colonel Sexton is a manufac
turer of stoves and hollow ware in Chi
cago. He was Postmaster In Chicago
during President Harrison's term.
The sixteenth annual convention of
the National Women's Relief Corps of
the G. A. R. convened at 9 o'clock this
morning in the Scottish Rite Cathedral.
The annual report of. the national sec
retary, Mary R. Shepard of Missouri,
showed an aggregate of v 144.245 mem
bers, a gain of 4099 members during the
past year. The report of the national
treasurer, Isabel T. Bagley of Ohio,
showed the assets of the organization
to be $18,997 and no liabilities. The gen
eral fund now on hand is $12,264. The
election of officers will take place to
morrow.
On suspension of the order of busi
ness the Women's Relief Corps elected
the following officers:
Mrs. Flo Jamison Miller of Chicago,
president: Mrs. Mary Wentzel of Cin
cinnati, senior vice president; Ellen T.
Daniels, West Virginia, junior vice
president; Mrs. Caroline Bell, Milwau
kee, national treasurer.
The following were elected members
of the executive board: Chairman,
Mrs. Ella F. Burt, Rhode Island; Mrs.
Alida Rue. Knoxville, Tennessee; Kate
B. Vallandingham, South Dakota.

QUITE A THRIFTY BUSINESS
SKELETONS THROWN OUT FOR

Family Plats in Old City Cemetery
Leveled Off and Sold Again.
â witnesses Secured for
Investigation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, Sept. B.â A
sensation has been caused here by J.
C. Wees, chairman of the City Trustees'
committee on cemeteries, preferring
charges before the board against N.
H. Bartorl, sexton of the city cemeteries
of San Bernardino.
Two cemeteries, one old and one new,
are side by side. The former has been
located since the town was founded,
but some yeurs ago, it being almost
impossible 'o secure new lots, a new
one .vas laid out. It now comes to light
that for some time past lots and even
family plats have been resold in the
old cemetery.
Mr. Wees heard of it and investigated
with the result that it seems the sex
ton has been able to make a consider
able profit in this way. He would level
off old-time graves when relatives left
the country, died or were unknown, and
resell them. Witnesses have been se
cured who will swear to having seen
skeletons thrown out to make places
for new burials on several occasions.
A full examination will be made at
the next meeting of the board. Doubt
less prosecution will follow and the
cemetery be closed to all except owners
of plats. _______________

FILIPINOS
BECOMING
DANGEROUS
Rivalry Between Aguinaldo
and Pilar Partly the
Cause.
Attitude of the Native Leaders
Tends to Injure the Cause
of Independence.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1888*
by James Gordon Bennett.
BY SOL N. SHERIDAN.
MANILA, Sept. B.â The attitude of
the Philippine insurgent leaders is daily
becoming more dangerous. So .open is
their opposition to the American au
thorities that the situation is strained,
and reconciliation may be difficult.
What makes the situation more
troublesome is the undisguised rivalry
between the followers of General Agui
naldo, the self-proclaimed dictator, and
General Pio Pilar, who covets the hon
or Aguinaldo has acquired.
General Pio Pilar is in command of
the insurgent troops stationed in South
Manila. He uses them in a way that
will be most annoying to Aguinaldo,
and at the same time he makes every
effort to show his utter disregard of the
American officials. His forces continue
to patrol the city, encouraging lawless
ness in every direction. They are con
stantly annoying the American troops,
who are engaged in the difficult task
of preserving order.
Aguinaldo's course is no less annoy
ing. He no longer' attempts to conceal
his hostility to the officials who repre
sent the United States. Yesterday he is
sued an order prohibiting his soldiers
from entering the American lines. This
course is probably deemed necessary in
order to^prevent them becoming well
disposed toward the Americans, so as
to destroy his power by repudiating his
leadership.
The attitude of the rival leaders can
not fail to injure the cause qf Philippine
independence. It will certainly pre
vent the presentation of a strong case
before the Paris ePace Commission on
behalf of the Filipinos.
OTIS HAS NOT ASKED
FOR REINFORCEMENTS
NEW YORK, Sept. B.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: President McKinley has
formally approved the course pursued
by Major General Otis, commanding
the American military force in Manila,
in his treatment of Aguinaldo and the
insurgents whom he commands. This
approval was communicated to Major
General Otis, and was in response to a
cablegram he sent showing that a dis
quieting condition exists in Luzon. The
contents of General Otis' dispatch are
withheld from publication by the de
partment officials, but it was stated
positively to-day that the American
commander had not asked for addi
tional troops, and there is no present
intention of reinforcing his command.
The most the department proposes to
do is to send several regiments to
Honolulu, from which point they can
be transported to Manila.
Under the instructions sent to Gen
eral Otis he is directed to compel the
insurgents to recognize the cessation
of hostilities agreed to between the
United States and Spain, and require
Aguinaldo and his forces to recognize
the military occupation and authority
of this Government.
A great deal of confidence is ex
pressed by the administration officials
of the ability of Rear Admiral Dewey
and Consul Williams to handle Agui
naldo without any resort to force, but
at the same time it is felt that it will
be part of wisdom to prepare for any
emergency that may arise. For that
reason troops will be sent to Honolulu,
where they will be 2200 miles nearer to
Manila, and the battle-ships Oregon
and lowa will be sent to the Pacific to
be in a position to reinforce Rear Ad
miral Dewey whenever the occasion de
mands.

tration officials have had no recent
cause to feel that a critical condition
of affairs was near at hand with the
insurgent forces of the Philippines. It
will be recalled that Major General
Merritt, before starting for Paris, ad
vised the insurgent leader Aguinaldo
that the authority of the United States
in and about Manila must be respected,
and that in the interest of a quiet and
orderly administration of affairs it was
desirable for the insurgents to vacate
the suburbs of the city within a rea
sonable time.
At that time Aguinaldo gave assur
ances of co-operating wit:, the Ameri
can forces toward the maintenance of
order, and there has been no reason to
believe that his adherents would give
serious opposition to their removal
from the suburbs. The time within
which the movement is to be accom
plished has not expired, according to
the understanding, and a satisfactory
arrangement is expected before the
time arrives.
In the meantime no reports have
come from General Otis, who is Acting
Governor in the absence of General
Merritt, as to friction with Aguinaldo
over his retirement.
Repojts have been circulated that
the President received a dispatch from
General Otis yesterday saying that he
had given Aguinaldo until to-day to
vacate the suburbs or else ti^ke the
consequences. This is erroneous, how
ever, as no such crisis has been report
ed by General Otis, and the reports ap
pear to have grown out of the original
orders given by General Merritt.
There is no uneasiness in official cir
cles over our relations with the insur
gents, as the American officers at Ma
nila have thus far shown an ability to
cope with the situation so tactfully as
to avoid friction and entanglements.
PRESIDIO TROOPS MAY
BE RUSHED TO MANILA
NEW YORK, Sept. B.â A Washington
special to the Journal says: As ar
ranged to-night orders have been given
for all troops at the Presidio at San
Francisco, about 7000, to proceed at
once to Honolulu. But the transports
carrying them are not to return. It is
believed by those who should know
that these transports will not stop at
Honolulu longer than a day, and will
at once steam^ across the Pacific to Ma
nila. So grave is the situation that or
ders were given at the White He-use
that none of the officials of the War
Department should give out any infor
mation on the subject.
After consultation at the White
House this morning it was stated at
the War Department that the troops at
San Francisco would be hurried to
Honolulu. The troops designated for
this service are the First Washington
Volunteers, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth
California Volunteers, Twentieth Kan
sas, First lowa, First Wyoming, First
Colorado and First Utah Battery.

FORTY-EIGHT EVENTFUL YEARS.
AT San Jose to-day the Native Sons and
Daughters of this great State are celebrating
the admission of California into the Union.
Thif was forty-eight years ago. More than an aver
age lifetime has passed. Most of the pioneers are
at rest. It is fitting that the day should be remem
bered by their children.
Half a century ago California was an unknown
land, a place of mystery and tradition. There were
stories told of the gold it held, of the broad acres
where the Spanish followed an ideal life, of the
matchless climate, and yet the bold spirits who set
sail for it or essayed to reach it by a trip across the
almost endless plains did not know whither they
were coming. Upon arrival they found new and
strange conditions. They had left behind the matter
of-fact civilization, with its fixed forms, and the task
was theirs to build up a new and abiding civilization.
They did this. From the first, before statutes could
be framed, they said that justice should rule. They
were industrious, enterprising, and they became pros
perous. Of their labors the fruit is ours now. We
hold them in high esteem, and whether they have
been called or are still among us, the work they ac
complished is to their credit, and freely arc they given
honor.
Since the admission of California progress has been
something beyond description. The unknown State
has grown to be might}'. Its resources have been
sought out, its productiveness encouraged. It has
added millions to the wealth of the world, and those
who live within its bounds think themselves blessed
that such is their privilege. WeFl may the Native
Sons and Daughters make a gala day.
As an incident of the occasion The Call will run
a special train to San Jose. The young men and
women who went from here yesterday with banners
and with song shall not miss their daily paper.
Bright and early this morning The Call will be in
their hands. They can read it before breakfast, and
hardly realize that they are away from home. But a
Californian is at home anywhere within the glorious
State of his nativity.
THE MERCANTILE LIBRARY.
SAN FRANCISCO is rich and generous, her
people have attained a high degree of literary
taste and general scholarship, but she will make
but a poor showing for her wealth, her liberality or
her culture if she permits the Mercantile Library to
be forced to close its doors by reason of a lack of
patronage and support.
The Mercantile has many claims upon the people
of San Francisco. It is one of the oldest institutions
in the city organized for the public good, and its
career of usefulness dates back to the days of the
pioneers. It is therefore an object of historic inter
est as well as of literary value, and appeals strongly
to all who desire to perpetuate in the city the works
of the founders of the commonwealth.
During the period of its existence the library has
been of incalculable benefit to thousands. Its hos
pitable reading-rooms and stores of books have been
sources from which a strong intellectual impulse
emanated and either directly or indirectly affected the
whole community. Even under the present adverse
conditions and with a heavy burden of debt upon it
the library continues to be an institution of prime im
portance, one of the notable features of the city.
If every person who has derived benefits from the
library would contribute to it but a tithe of what
those benefits have been worth the mortgage now
resting upon it would be paid off and a handsome
surplus remain as a permanent fund to support it.
Nor should- it- be difficult to arouse all beneficiaries of
the institution to contribute something to save it
from the fate that now threatens it. If one or two
liberal men of wealth who have been long associated
with it would lead in giving the required support it
is more than likely that others would gladly follow.
As a matter of fact if a well devised plan for re
lieving the library were put forward and directed by
energetic men the support 'given would not be con
fined to the membership of the association, nor to
those who have been habitual readers of its books.
There would be a generous response from the general
public. The association is one of which the com
munity at large is proud. It owns the best and most
stately library building in the city, and presents the
finest architectural monument that has yet been
raised in San Francisco to learning a..d literature.
It is therefore an institution in which all persons of
any civic pride take an interest, and if rightly appealed
to that interest would undoubtedly be responsive in
the way of irfaterial help.
Some of the dog-catchers ought to be made to pay
a license similar to tha,t required for the four-footed
canines they pursue.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FKIDAY, SJSJf TEMBER 9 % 1898.
JUDGE MAGUIRE'S JEFFERSONIONISM.
IN his speech made on the 4th of last February,
reported in No. 164, volume 31, of the Congres
sional Record, Judge Maguire quoted Jefferson's
motto, "Equal rights for all, special privileges "for
none," and proceeded to define what he considers
special privileges to be. Among them he puts the
private ownership of land, and seeks to spread abroad
the idea that the principles of Jefferson require the
confiscation of all lands so held.
Maguire calls private land-owners "aggressors" and
"monopolists," who, being "strong and cunning,"
have robbed "the weak and undesigning." This brings
up again the discussion of what Jeffersonian Democ
racy means, and its definitions promise to bÂ« as
various as those given to the Virginia and Ken
tucky resolutions of 1798 and 1799.
According to Judge Maguire, Jefferson's principles
demand that land-owners shall have their lands con
fiscated by the State without compensation.
But is that what Jefferson meant? Did the author
of the Declaration of Independence consider the pri
vate ownership of land a special privilege and there
fore to be prohibited? Can Judge Maguire reason
ably deduce from the Jeffersonian motto such a
meaning?
After Jefferson had written and signed the Declara
tion of Independence he went home to Virginia and
there set up what may be fairly considered a work
ing model of our system of constitutional govern
ment He was the Governor of the colony of Vir
ginia, and instituted there all of the reforms and laid
all the foundations which he considered necessary to
the perpetuity of a representative republican govern
ment.
He found in his native colony a union of church
and state, by which the civil law protected the tith
ing of the people for the maintenance of an ecclesi
astical establishment. This he abolished, separating
church and state and putting all creeds on an exact
level, to be supported by the voluntary contributions
of those who accepted them.
He found in force the Jaw of entail, by which the
landed estate of a family was held in its possession
from generation to generation, and by the twin law
of primogeniture, descended to the oldest son, leav
ing the rest of the children without a landed estate;
and he abolished entail and primogeniture.
Now this not only gave children an equal in
heritance in the parental lands, but permitted the sale
of all lands by lifting from such sale and transfer of
title the paralyzing hand of entail which forbade the
sale of landed estates.
After these reforms were accomplished by Jefferson
in Virginia the special privilege of the family in an
entail of lands and of the oldest son in their descent
to him exclusively had been abolished, and all men
had the same equal right to property in land that they
had to property in other things â the right to earn it
by their labor.
At the time he accomplished these reforms Mr.
Jefferson could have gone further had he believed
that private ownership of land was a monopoly and
a special privilege. That he did not go further is the
best evidence that in his philosophy real and personal
property were equal and man had an equal right to
either by paying for it.
Judge Maguire can bring no testimony from Jeffer
son's reorganization of the government of Virginia
and his amendments of its Royal Charter to purge it
of tithing, entail and primogeniture, to help out his
pretense that the private owner of land is a monopo
list and a cunning aggressor.
In his speech of last February Judge Maguire said:
"Land is just as truly the common heritage of the
people as are the air and the sunlight. * * * It is
therefore the function of democratic government to
prevent the interference of the unscrupulously aggres
sive with the equal rights of their fellows, * * *
and to determine * * * by rules * * â¦ the
terms and conditions by which every citizen's natural
right "o the soil shall be exercised."
It will be observed that his idea that the land is
incapable of private ownership is based on his anal
ogy between the land and the air and sunshine. With
a strange lack of logic he fails to see that he is com
paring things incomparable. His statement is:
"Air and sunshine and land are alike the common
heritage of the people. To part with the use of land
as air and sunshine are used is fatal to the natural
right of life. Therefore it is the function of demo
cratic government to prevenv private ownership of
land."
Now let us redistribute the elements in that state
ment.
"Land, air and sunshine are alike the common heri
tage of the people. To part with the use of sunshine
as land and air are used is fatal to the natural rights
of life. Therefore it is the function of democratic
government to prevent the private ownership of sun
shine." It is at once seen that the Judge's statement
is nonsense because it treats as alike things that are
not alike.
But moonshine as it is, it serves his purpose. He
believes that a majority of the voters of California
have invested their means in personal instead of real
property or have not earned either personal or real
property, therefore he believes that if his amendment
No. 2 is adopted the voters who have bought personal
instead of real property and the voters who have not
bought any property at all will join, and, being in a
majority, will vote to rob the men who have bought
land instead of personal property and will confiscate
and equally divide all property in lands.
This scheme he calls Jeffersonian Democracy,
when it is far from anything taught by Jefferson as
Governor of Virginia or President of the United
States.
One count in Jefferson's indictment of George 111
in the Declaration of Independence was that he pre
vented the population of. the colonies and discour
aged immigration by making, too difficult the appro
priation of land, meaning its subjection to private
ownership.
Any citizen who studies Judge Maguire's fantastic
definition of "special privilege" to mean private
ownership and applies it to the material concerns of
this State may well be alarmed at the effect of his
election upon landed securities and, through them,
upon the savings banks and their depositors.
War has seemed to touch the Astors. One of
them has contributed freely to the conduct of it and
has concluded hereafter to pay his taxes. The other
has given orders that tenants whose supporters have
enlisted are not to be ejected for non-payment of
rent. Yet there are people who profess to think the
little misunderstanding with Spain has accomplished
nothing.
There is not much use in the health inspectors de
voting their time to finding filthy restaurants unless
they have a way of making the proprietors clean the
places. Anybody can find them.
Aguinaldo will vainly be counseled to think twice
before defying the United States, for he does not
seem to have the apparatus for thinking once.
When women have secured the right to vote there
are several fictitious widows who will never cast a
ballot for Judge Seawell.
TWO NECESSARY CHANGES.
IT is quite evident that a change ought to be made
in the name of the Silver-Democratic-Populist
combination which is now soliciting the suffrages
of the people of this State for its kangaroo ticket.
Unless this organization wishes to be indicted at the
election in November for obtaining votes under false
pretenses, it will be compelled to adopt a different
designation. We therefore respectfully suggest as a
precautionary measure that the fusion gang be called
the Gallagher party. This is shorter than the regular
name, it is more euphonious than the Popocratic
party, and it is thoroughly expressive of the object
and purposes of the fusion.
The entire movement is designed to put the Gal
lagher family in office, and to call the fusionists the
Gallagher party would be tit once appropriate and
honest.
There is another thing the Gallaghers must do if
they desire to succeed in their sortie on the offices.
They must immediately cut loose from Hearst's
bcodling sheet. If the Gallaghers will jog their mem
ones a little they will recall the fact that Hearst once
sold his paper to the Southern Pacific Company for
a $30,000 "advertising" contract. This money was
made payable in monthly installments of $1000, and
therefore the contract extended over a period of thirty
months, covering a State campaign and two Legisla
tures.
The Gallaghers ought also to recall the fact that
after effecting this sale of its silence Hearst refused
to stay "fixed." > After serving Huntington for
twenty-two months he broke the quiet he had main
tained and began to abuse the railroad. Various ex
planations have been offered of this extraordinary
conduct. The most tenable one is that Hearst had
constituted himself a grievance committee and had
applied for an increase of pay, failing to get which
he went on strike. This theory is supported by the
fact that the railroad lockout of 1894 was then in
progress. At such a time Hearst, it is presumed,
would naturally adopt the absurd view that his silence
was worth more to the Southern Pacific than $1000 a
month.
If the Gallaghers possess any sense they will per
ceive that the support of a sheet which has been con
victed of such an offense as this cannot fail to prove
fatal in the campaign. What these gentlemen should
do is to call their State Committee together, resolve
in favor of adopting the name of the Gallagher party,
and then formally repudiate the support of the Ex
aminer. We assume that the Gallaghers are anxious
to get control of the State government. Of course
if they are indifferent on that point they may proceed
as they are.
It is quite certain, however, that they will be de
feated if they continue to accept the support of
Hearst's boodling sheet, and it is not less probable
that unless they change their name as we have sug
gested they will be apprehended after election for
obtaining votes under false pretenses. The present
Gallagher party is not the Democratic-Silver Repub
lican-Populist party by a long shot, and to solicit
votes under such a designation is a fraud on the
people.
ThJE SAMOAN PROBLEM.
KING MALIETOA of Samoa, we are told, main
tained his royal state on a revenue of about $50
a month derived from his subjects, and patron
ized the arts and pleasures of his capital out of such
sums as his wife allowed him from the income she
earned by doing the washing for the European and
American residents of the place. He was not a potent
nor a very august monarch in his life, and yet his
death threatens to disturb the world more seriously
than that of the late Czar â the mighty autocrat of all
the Russias.
While Malietoa lived he served as a sort of buffer
against which American, British and German rivals
in the islands shook their fists or butted their heads
as passion prompted when they were angry, and thus
were saved from fighting one another. Malietoa
dead, however, serves no such purpose. The con
tentious traders find themselves standing face to face.
Fist shaking has become dangerous, and head butting
would mean immediate war. The King's death, there
fore, is of more moment than' that of any other sov
ereign of recent years. Truly it might be said of him
that we could better have spared a better man. He
seems to have been in the truest sense of the phrase a
peacemaker, for now that he is gone it looks as if
the only way by which the United States, Great
Britain and Germany can avoid engaging in a tri
angular war would be to agree with one another to
perpetrate a wholesale spoliation of the islanders.
The proposition for spoliation is under discussion
in Germany and is said to have found favor there.
Basing their conclusions upon the admitted failure
of the present system of governing the islands by a
tripartite league, the Germans propose to divide the
group and apportion them among the three powers.
According to this plan the United States is to take
Tutuila, the British Savaii, and the Germans Upolu,
while the Samoans are to take to the deep seas or \o
take in washing for a living as the great Malietoa
did before them.
The proposed plan, it will be conceded,, has its
merits. By what appears to be an equitable division
of the spoils, it gives to each of the three great powers
a station in that part of the ocean and enables each
to provide there a coaling and naval depot of such
magnitude as it chooses. It also relieves each from
any share of responsibility for the actions of the
others, and thus puts an end to those irritating
problems that have been continually arising ever
since the tripartite agreement was made.
The interests of all three of the powers in the
islands are considerable. The foreign population is
mainly British, and most of the imports are British;
the wealthiest firms are German, and most of the ex
ports are to Germany; while we have treaty rights
with the islanders and have frequent direct steam
ship communication with the group. By the proposed
division Germany will get the island containing the
capital and the largest population, the United States
will obtain the one with the finest harbor, and Great
Britain will have the most land.
The chief objection to the scheme is that all this
equitable division will be made among powers who
have no equities at all in the matter. All of them
have agreed to maintain the independence of Samoa,
and to break that agreement would be in a small way
something similar to the partition of Poland. Alto
gether the subject is an unpleasant one. It is to be
regretted that Malietoa is dead.
Pretty soon there will be necessity for calling the
roll of the men who did not mail a mysterious pack
age at the request of some woman. They will be
easier to count than the other fellows.
It is even now not too late for the Wells-Fargo
Company to repent and be forgiven. It will be re
membered that the dying thief s contrition was effec
tive.

AT THE IRISH FAIR
By ROBERT FERRAL
Sure, there's a real old jaunting cap.
Brought over for the fair,
'Twill take you 'round the little Isle,
And make you think you're there.
With whip in hand the driver sits
And rattles off his story,
'Bout every castle, town and spot,
It'B sorrows and its glory.
Thank God for this one day of life on Irish soil again
The tears that dim my poor old eyes are sweet as summer rain;
To stand once more on Irish earth, to press it to my heart,
It makes me like a child again, and tears unbidden start.
I hear the sound of Bhandon bells, as in the days of yore,
Wfren playing at my mother's feet around the cabin door;
I see the dear ones, long since dead, yet young and fair to me,
As when I lisped my evening prayer beside the River Lee.
But Erin's sod beneath our feet brings other thoughts to-day,
Beside the loved ones left behind, and long since passed away;
Here's where great Brian, king of kings, beat back the Danish foe,
And drove them headlong to the sea, at Clontarf long ago.
And there, in all its glory bright, is Tara's sacred hill.
Where Patrick preached the word of God that echoes 'round it still;
The sweet notes of its silent harps, like incense in the air,
Linger o'er the blessed spot with melody of prayer.
And here is where O'Connell stood, and in the name of God
Proclaimed religious liberty on Ireland's hallowed sod;
Rolled back the clouds of darkness, and made the world to know
That freedom only comes to those who dare to strike the blow.
Old Limerick, too, is holy ground, It brings us Sarsfieid's name.
Before me glares that awful siege, its glory and Its shame;
The Dead Sea fruit of treachery, the outraged people's cry, \
The story of the treaty, broken ere the ink was dry.
Wexford and Wicklow! Bend the knee to dust of ninety-eight.
It drank as rich, warm patriot blood as ever tempted rate;
They fought and fell for freedom's cause, their native land to eavÂ«y
A hundred years have left undimmed the memory of the brave.
But Wicklow brings a tender thought of beauty rich and rare,
"The Meeting of the Waters," enchanting spot, is there;
The song of Moore is in our ears, so soulful and so sweet,
'Tis like a glimpse of Paradise, where the glad, bright waters meet.
And here is little Sligo, where two hundred years ago
Our heroes taught a lesson to old Ireland's ancient foe;
A part of dear old Connaught, with its sorrows and its tears.
Where the mother tongue Is spoken and is sweet to Irish ears.
Old Blarney Castle strikes the eye, just as it stands to-day,
With a chance to kiss the famous stone, and drive dull care away;
The Bank of Ireland, true to life, once rang with freedom's voice,
When Grattan's matchless eloquence made Erin's sons rejoice.
Here's where the "man forGalway" roared when 'lection day came round,
There's where Kilkenny's wild gossoons a process server drowned;
And yonder, just across the way, is noisy Donnybrook fair,
Sure blackthorn sticks were busy when the boys had gathered there.
And there's the city of the north, Belfast, old Ulster's pride,
Despite sad scenes of bigotry, her sons for freedom died;
Through passion's light shines clear and bright the name of William Orr
First martyr of the noble band in the darkest days of yore.
But of all the cities, great and small, brave Dublin leads the van,
With words that burn for liberty and men that died for man;
Heroes, patriots and orators, I hear the battle cry
Of those who in their country's cause left names not born to die.
Grattan and Curran thrilled the world with eloquence sublime
They spoke for all humanity, for every age and time;
Emmet and Tone, McCrackenand Sheares, Lord Edward brave and true
We'll not forget our martyred dead while Irish skies are blue.
'Twas Dublin, too, that later etill gave other names to fame
When "Young Ireland" of forty-eight rekindled freedom's flame:
Smith O'Brien, Mitchell, Davis, and gallant Meaghor, too.
Who 'neath the banner of the Stars so proudly wore the blue.
And here's Glasnevin's holy ground, where Ireland's sons find re^t
From the cruel fate that waits upon the bravest and the best-
Parnell sleeps in his humble grave, life's fitful fever o'er,
But his name and fame to Ireland are dear forever more.
This is a picture of Ireland, as shown in Irish clay.
And many a tear has fallen for the old land far a'wav
Father and mother, sister and brother, kneeling on the sod
Have kissed the earth that gave them bjrth and breathed a prayer to God
GAGE AND THE RAILROADS.
This cry of the railroad in connection with Henry T. Gage Is reminis
cent of but one thingâ the bogie man. I have known Gage for twelve years
or more, and I write by the card when I say that no man in the State has
a more complete, consistent, anti-railway record than he. He made the
first speech ever delivered in Southern California in favor of San Pedro as
a harbor, and his creed in regard to corporations is so radical that it
might not be considered good politics for -me to go into it at this time.
Mr. Gage, If he desired, could now be a rich man from the fees he coufd
have gotten from the Southern Pacific Company alone, but he never could
be induced to take a case for that company at any price, and more than
that he has obtained more judgments against that corporation, I venture
to say, than any half-dozen lawyers in the State. Mr. Gage has not talked
much about his anti-railway record as has Mr. Maguire, it is true, but the
latter gentleman as far as results are concerned has not one-half the
showing to make. Personally I do not believe that the Southern Pacific is
any worse nor one-half as bad in its effects on the public weal as several
other corporations that could be named, if naming were appropriate, but
to try to fit a railway collar on Gage's massive, free neck is nothing less
than rank absurdity. I would like to add that to my personal knowledge
Gage has what to my mind is the finest quality a man can possess, that
is, his fidelity to his friends. He has never accepted a case against any
one who was in that category, and he has let thousands and thousands
of dollars go by him that he could have had as fees from his strict regard
of this principle. With all due seriousness and weighing of the assertion
I firmly believe that there is not enough money in the world to tempt him
to swerve one hair's breadth from what he believes to be right and honest
He is a thoroughbred American, but it is no derogation from that proud
appellation to say that he has all the virtues that once made the name of
Roman the loftiest adjective that could be applied to a man â Otheman

NIGHTS
HE WASTED.
a certain thing happened a few nights
ago which shook my faith in positive
reasoning. Every physician of the North
told me I was a victim of my own hallu
cinations, but I refused to believe them.
I knew that I suffered from insomnia,
and that they were powerless to relieve
me. 'The sleep that knits up the rav
eled sleeve of care' never visited my eye
lids more than an hour out of twenty
four. I tell you It was an awful condition
to be in. Why. I used to keep friends
up and buy them anything from lemon
ade and Welsh rarebits to small bottlea
and hot birds merely to know that some
body else besides myself was not sleep
ing. I was resolved to allow my young
life to dissolve Itself away, and was
already preparing myself for the fatal
hour. I listened to the most desiccated
sermons that were ever written or read,
but it was of no avail. But I was cured
in a single night.
"I remember every detail distinctly. I
heard the cuckoo crow its damnable
erowÃ every hour, and I was certain that
not one escaped me. When I arose in the
morning I was quoting the words of Clar
ence, 'I would not pass through such an
other night to buy a world of happy
days.' Without any exaggeration I tell
you that was the most gnawing night of
insomnia I ever experienced.
"The first thing I do when I get up
!n the morning Is to reach for my watch
to see the hour. I reached, but no watch.
I became suspicious, and I looked on the
bureau and In an instant I saw that I
was robbed. My diamonds, money, silver
ornaments and everything of value bad
disappeared. The door Was locked just
as it was when I retired the night before,
but there was a square piece of glass
out of the window near the top where
the lock is fastened. Did I sleep that
night? Well, I guess I must have, and
I have been sleeping ever since. It was
all a delusion. That burglar taught me
a lesson, and he is welcome to all he
took, but please don't send him tround

SMALL VESSELSâ lnquirer, City.
Among the smallest vessels that pass in
and out of the Golden Gate in the regular
line of commerce at this time may be
mentioned La Chilna, 11 tons; Nettie Low,
25 tons, and May C, 26 tons. Vessels of
only seven tons have passed through the
gate in going from one port to another.
OWEN MEREDITH'Sâ SeveraI readers
of Answers to Correspondents have kind

the author of the lines published in the
issue of September 6. They are from
"Changes," by Owen Meredith, the first
line of which is "Whom first we love,
you know, we seldom wed."
TWO HORSESâ Teamster, Lakeport,
Cal. If two horses are attached to a
wagon and on the road one gets in the
lead and the other lags, the one that is
In the lead does the most work. If the
leader throw himself in the collar and the
lagging one holds back without stretching
the trace, then the leader is doing all
the work.
TROUBLESOME CORNSâ A. A., Stent,
Cal. The best cure for troublesome corns
Is to have shoes made that will fit well,
without undue pressure on any portion of
the foot. Hard leather continually
pressing on soft portions of the feet is
what produces corns. There are any num
ber of "sure cures" for bunions, but these
should not be tried without the advice of
some competent person who has made an
examination and can tell just what
should be done.
STATE OFFICERS' SALARIESâ A. E.
9., City. The salaries of State officers in
California are: Chief Justice of the Su
preme Court, $6000; Associate Justices,
$6000 each; Clerk of the Supreme Court,
$3000; Governor, $6000; Lieutenant Gov
ernor, $10 per day while the Legislature
is in session; Secretary of State, Con
troller, Treasurer. Attorney General, Sur
veyor General, Superintendent of Public
Instruction and Superintendent of State
Printing, $3000 each.
DO AS ROMANS DOâ A. D. F., City.
The origin of "When in Rome do as
Romans do" is credited to St. Ambrose
(fourth century)- It appears that in his
time, in Milan Saturday was observed as
a feast and in Rome as a fast. St. Am
brose, being asked what should be done
in such a case, replied: "In matters of In
difference it is better to be guided by
general usage. When I am in Milan I do
not fast on Saturdays; but when I am in
Rome I do as Romans do."
CITIZENSHIPâ C. M. R., City. The
statement made in the letter of inquiry
relative to citizenship is not sufficiently
clear to admit of an answer. In order to
be able to furnish an answer it is neces
sary to know when the father came to
the United States when he enlisted in the
navy, when discharged, whether he re
mained in the United States, or whether
he went back to the land of his birth;
when and where the son was born, and
whether the father returned to the United
States.
INVENTOR AND LAWYER â Sub
scriber, City. If an inventor wishes to
secure a patent on an invention he can
go to Washington, D. C, and make per
sonal application, but he will not be aole
to do so without a great deal of trouble
and expense. If he places the matter in
the hands of an attorney who has a good
reputation he will have but little trouble
in securing his patent if entitled to it. He
would run danger of being betrayed if he
placed the matter in the hands of some
party who has no reputation at stake.
WATERâ lnquirer, Fort Ross, Cal.
There is some doubt as to whether water
that contains sodium or magnesium i 3
unwholesome, experts being divided on
that point. "Water that these Is any
doubt about can be made fit for human
use by boiling and it may also be ren
dered fit for use by filtering, care beinp
taken that the filtering material, coarse
gravel, fine gravel and sand, is thorough
ly cleansed at short intervals to keep the
water free from bacteria. The simplest
way to use hard water for washing Is to
use it with what is known as "hard water
soap." It is impossible to Rive a general
answer as to what should be done with
water that leaves a deposit in boilers ami
kettles. The safest way to act is to have
the water analyzed and ascertain what
its properties are. The chemist will l>e
the best to advise as to how the water
should be treated to render it fit for
human use.
WEDDING DRESSESâ L., Stockton,
Cal. The department of Answers to Cor
respondents is ready at all times to an
swer any reasonable question, but it is
not ready to devote the time and labor of
searching over the files of newspapers for
an unlimited period, turning over the
pages of the daily papers of this city as
printed day after day and those of publi
cations of other places for the puriose
of publishing "the names of as many San
Francisco brides as you can find out
about whose wedding dresses were made
of light gray material, or as many f-jsn
ionable society women of the world who
yore light gray on their wedding flay."
This department wishes it understood
that the information can be obtained by
any one who would be â willing to devote
two or three years or more time to
searching the recorus since the time when
society reporters commenced publishing
the attire of brides.
THE WOMEN WHO WAIT.
He went to the war in the morningâ
The roll of the drums could be heard.
But he paused at the gute with his mother.
For a Kiss and a comforting word.
He was full of the dreams and ambitions
That youth is so ready to weave.
And proud of the clang of hts saber
And the chevrons of gold on his sleeve.
He came from the war in the evening â
The meadows were sprinkled with snow.
The drums and the bugles were silent.
And the steps of the soldiers were s.low.
He was wrapped in the flag of hie country
When they laid him away In the mold,
With the glittering stars of a captain
Replacing the chevrons of gold.
With the heroes who sleep on the hillside
He lies with a flag at his head,
But. blind with the years of her weeping.
His mother yet mourns for her dead.
The soldiers who fall in the battle
May feel but a moment of pain.
But the women who wait in the homesteads
Must dwell with the ghosts of the slain.

OREGON ARE
WELL TREATED
Governor Lord Make
an Investigation.
SAYS HE IS WELL PLEASED
EHAFTER TO COMMAND DEPART
MENT OF CALIFORNIA-
The Eighth California Regiment
Will To-Morrow Move to Its
New Station, Replacing
the Sixth,
Borne weeks ago Mrs. Dr. H. E. Jones
of Portland, representing the Red Cross
Society of Oregon, came to San Fran
cisco and visited the 330 recruits for the
Second Oregon, who were then located
at Camp Merrltt, and now at the Presidio,
waiting to be forwarded to Manila to Join
their regiment. Mrs. Dr. Jones, Instead
of finding the Oregon recruits enjoying
a continual picnic, learned that they were
simply being treated as soldiers and were
passing their time In learning the manual
of arms, the usual evolutions Incident to
a military life, and doing camp duty. Mrs.
Dr. Jones returned to Portland and re
ported that the Oregon recruits were not
well treated, that they were poorly fed
and poorly officered. She sent a fearful
tale of woe, by wire, to Adjutant General
Corbln, protesting against "the culpable
neglect of the 330 Oregon recruits at the
Presidio," and beseeching the Govern
ment to send them at once "to Manila
and responsible officers, or else return
them to their respective homes."
General Corbin telegraphed the dispatch
of Mrs. Dr. H. E. Jones to General Mil
ler, and requested him to make an in
vestlgat.on. General Miller did so, and
wired back an emphatic denial of the
Portland woman's charges.
Yesterday morning Governor Lord of
Oregon, accompanied by his adjutant
general, Colonel Tuthlll, arrived in the
city to make a personal investigation of
the matter. The chief executive of the
AVebfoot State will return to his com
monwealth satisfied that Mrs. Dr. H. E.
Jones was misled into making an In
correct statement.
Governor Lord and Colonel Tuthill, im
mediately upon arrival in the city, pro
ceeded at once to the Presidio, being es
corted by Adjutant General Barrett. They
were met by General Miller and First
Lieutenant Charles G. Woodward, the as
sistant adjutant general of the First Bri
gade, and Major Goodale of the Twenty
third Infantry, to which the Oregon re
cruits are attached. The Governor went
through the camp and made a most
thorough inspection, and, after question-
Ing the men, came to the conclusion that
he had never seen a more contented or
better cared for lot of soldiers than the
recruits about whom he had given himself
puch needless anxiety. After the inspec
tion he expressed himself as pleased with
the condition of the men, and said that he
had never seen soldiers any better cared
for than the Oregon recrufts. The Gov
ernor accompanied by Colonel Tuthill,
will visit the men again to-day, when they
will be drilled for him In order that he
may have an opportunity of Judging of
the sure and rapid progress that they I
have made in that trying school that i
transforms the civilian into the soldier. !
Governor Lord Is an old soldier, having j
at one time served in the Second United

Presidio Notes.
Private Duckworth, Company A, First
Tennessee Regiment, and Colonel Smith
have had a clash of arms, with the re-
Bult that the soldier has been threatened
with punishment. Duckworth represents
an Eastern paper In his native State, and
has persisted In sending back to his home
accounts of the discontent existing among
the men and enlarging upon all of their
petty grievances. He was ordered by
Colonel Smith to stop sending such re
ports, but refused to do so, and it Is
Bald that after he had been warned to
desist he immediately liled a report mag
nlfying the many aJleged hardships that
the men of the regiment are suffering.
If this be the case, when the papers
reach here Duckworth will be punished.
It is said that three of the sergeants of
the regiment who have been doing much
to stir up the men and make them dis
contented are to be reduced to the ranks.
The companies of the Sixth which have
been at Benicla, Santa Cruz and Alcatraz
will arrive at the Presidio to-day.
Private Charles Zuger, Company X,
First Washington Regiment, died at the
post hospital yesterday of typhoid fever.
Nine more soldiers were taken yester
day from the division hospital to the Red
Cross Convalescent Home. This makes
a total of twenty already being cared for
by the Red Cross. All of these men with
one exception are convalescing from fever.

HAS BORNE FRUIT.
A Strict Watch Being Kept on Chi-
nese at the Mail Dock.
The exposures made by The Call with
reference to the audacious manner in
which Chinese brokers suborn perjury for
the purpose of landing coolies at this port
have borno good fruit. Yesterday Sur
veyor Spear requested Deputy St. John to
issue an imperative order that no one be
allowed herenfter to visit steamers on
which Chinese are awaiting a landing
without a pass countersigned by the Sur
veyor of the Port.
The close watch which has been kept
for the past few days has resulted in the
exclusion from the Mail dock of a
Chinese hanger-on named George Brown.
Brown has been in the habit of acting as
a go-between for Chinese coolie brokers
and their slaves, and haÃ been carrying
letters for them to and from the steamers
for a cash consideration.
His Boom Looted.
G. H. Jones a switchman on the
Southern Pacific, living at 650 Fourth
street, reported to the police yesterday
that his room had been broken into dur
ing the night and all his clothes and other
personal property had been .stolen. Noth
ing was left belonging to him except a.
soiled pair of cuffs.
He Committed Suicide.
Detectives Dillon and Anthony have
concluded their Investigation into the
death of J. C. Martin at 229 Golden Gate
avenue Tuesday morning and have re
ported to Captain Bohen that in their
opinion It was a case of suicide. This ends
the matter as far as the police are con
cerned.

GUESSING AT
THE TAX RATE
City Fathers Will Soon
Fix the Levy.
NO ACTION YET TAKEN
SUPERVISOR HASKINS SPEAKS
ON THE SUBJECT.
Expert Williams Declares No Deci
sion Has Been Reached as
to a Rate â SomÂ«
Demands.
Considerable guessing is being done Just
now as to what the next tax levy will
be. One rumor has it that the Supervisors
will fix the municipal rate at 1.30. an ad
vance of 11.46 cents on the hundred dol
lars' valuation. Still another rumor says
that the increase will be about 23
cents, making the total tax levy, including
that of the State, over $2. These guesses
are based solely on the extravagant ten
dencies of the Supervisors and their
known willingness to spend money with a
liberal hand.
It has been believed for some time that
the Supervisors would seek to Increase the
rate, but up to the present time not an
lota of evidence exists that the Finance
Committee â will recommend any Increase
whatever. No meeting of the committee
has been held to discuss the tax rate, ow
ing to the absence of Supervisor Rottanzl
from the city and the illness of Super
visor Devany. The only member of the
Finance Committee who Is In the city â
Supervisor Haskins â said last evening:
"The committee -will meet some time
next week. At that time the tax levy
â¢will be discussed. We have not as yet
considered the matter owing to the ab
sence of Supervisor Rottanzi, who, in his
military capacity, is at present away on
guard at the Santa Cruz powder mills.
Supervisor Devany is very 111. He has
been at Skaggs Springs, but is now at
Mill Valley. If he recovers sufficiently
the committee will meet some, day next
week.
"Have you formed any idea of what the
tax levy will be for the next fiscal year?"
was asked.
"I have not," replied Haskins. "The
people are asking lor a new City and
County Hospital, the improvement of car
tain streets, the building of new sewers
and the erection of more school houses.
If the Supervisors accede to these de
mands as a matter of course the tax
levy will be higher. You can positively
state, however, that the Finance Com
mittee has had no opportunity to
meet as yet to discuss the tax levy."
Expert Accountant Cyril Williams, who
serves the Finance Committee, was seen
at his residence on Scott street last even
ing and asked as to whether any secret
action had been taken by some of the
Supervisors, looking to the fixing of a
tax levy.
"You may state without reservation,"
remarked Mr. Williams, "that no one
knows yet what the next tax levy will
be. The Supervisors do not know. Un
til they get together next week it Is im
possible to say whether they will uphold
Auditor Broderick's estimates or not.
They may cut his estimates all to pieces,
as they have done in the past. It he rec
ommends $20,000 in one case, for illustra
tion, they may cut his estimate to $10,000,
and then spend the other $10,000 as they
think best. It Is absurd at this time to
say what the tax levy will be. It may
bo more than it was last year. That will
depend on the views of the Supervisors,
and I know that they have determined
to do no guessing in the newspapers un
til they know themselves what is to be
done."
Another gentleman, who is Intimately
associated with Supervisors Sheehan and
Brltt, made several pointed statements
on condition that his name should not be
given. "There have been quite a number
of little caucuses held in San Rafael re
cently "he remarked. "You might have
noticed Haskins, Britt, Sheehan and De
vany together. Delany wasn't invited.
They did not think it necessary. Morton
Smith and Rivers were also noticeable by
their absence. Of course when you come
to say Just what topics were discussed by
the lour Supervisors at the San Rafael
meetings then you enter the guessing
business once more. If they talked or
tax levies, or new parks, or anything else
they kept no minutes for the benefit of
the public. Surmises do little good, ex
cept to cause fools to speculate. If some
of the Supervisors have agreed to work
for an increased tax levy they have not
indicated the fact to their most Intimate
friends."
The first definite information concerning
part of the tax levy came from Sacra
mento yesterday afternoon in the shape
of a communication from the State Board
of Equalization addressed to the San
Francisco Supervisors and giving, under
date of September 6. a statement of the
amounts to be levied for State purposes
For the general fund 23.8 cents is de
manded, for the school fund 21.6, and for
Interest and sinking fund 1.4 cents. In
addition there Is an assessment in the
form of an ad valorem tax of 2 cents
upon each $100 valuation of taxable prop
erty In the State for the support of the
University of California. 'The total levy
thus amounts to 48 cents and 8 mills.
Last July Auditor Broderick, as will be
recollected, estimated the necessary tax
levy for the city to be 1.29 for the com
ing fiscal year. The Auditor determined
in his own mind how much ought to be
spent by the various departments, recom
mending Increases for the Assessor,
County Clerk and several other officials
and a reduction from $110,000 to $53,000 In
the Health Department, and proportion
ate cuts in other branches.
Since that time the Supervisors, without
taking action on the Auditor's report
have decided to make provision for a new
city and county hospital to cost $400 000
to pay $16,500 on the deficiency of Treas
urer Widber; to provide for a deficiency
in the general fund of $87,000; to spend
$35,000 for police telegraph boxes and cen
tral switches, $12,500 for fife alarm boxes
and $40,000 for removing the fire alarm

THE CHAMPIONSHIP
TENNIS TOURNAMENT
THE PACIFIC COAST DOUBLES
AT SAN RAFAEL TO-DAY.
All the Teams Entered Play in thÂ«
Same Class and Are Evenly
Balanced.
The championship doubles tournament
of the Pacific Coast will be played to-day
on the courts of the Hotel Rafael. The
entries are not large, but some good
matches are promised on account of the
evenness of the playing of the teams
which will participate.
The Hardy brothers, the present cham
pions, and the Whltneys, will not play
in the tournament. This will leave the
field open for the second-class men en
tirely.
Pieher and Freeman of Stanford Uni
versity will try for the prize honors, and
it is very likely that they will carry off
the championship. Both men have been
playing tennis constantly for the past
three months and are in splendid condi
tion. In the South they won every tour
nament they entered.
The California Tennis Club will enter
WHhe and Adams, the "pony" team, of
which groat things are expected. Chese
brough and Drummond and Root and
Walter are other teams which will wear
the colors of San Francisco. Alameda
will be represented by Hunt and Stark,
Bowen and Holmes and Murdoch and
Nicholson. Stone and Selby and Pratt
and Spencer will wear the colors of the
Oakland Club.
The interclub rivalry is one of the ele
ments which will make the tournament
interesting. The teams are evenly bal
anced with perhaps the exception of the
Stanford men, Pieher and Freeman, wno
stand In a class of their own, somewhere
between the llrst and second classes.
The ladies' tournament, which is al
ways held at the same time with the
doubles championship, may not tcke
place on account of the paucity of en
tries.
The greatest rivalry exists between
Nicholson and Murdoch and Weihe and
Adams, both of which teams are slated
for places by their favorites. It was riot
known until last week that Pieher and
Freeman Intended to enter and the
"pony" team and their brothers from
across the bay are now filled with pain
and unpleasant feelings, for the silver
cups on which they had set their hearts
seem to be passing out of their hands.
THE BANKERS' CONVENTION.

WILL PRESENT A
BILL FOR SALVAGE
Asks for Pay for Saving
the Grace Dollar.
WAS FAST ON A SAND SPIT
GOLD HUNTERS DESTITUTE AT
COPPER RIVER.
Returning Miners Say Starvation
Will Reign Supreme at Coffee
City This Winter Unless
Relief Is Sent.
The arrival of the new steamer Grace
Dollar from Coos Bay to-day will prob
ably be the signal for the commence
ment of some lively litigation. About two
weeks ago the vessel left San Francisco
for Coos Bay and Astoria with passen
gers and considerable cargo. On the
morning of August 31 her captain started
Into Coos Bay with her, but somehow
the steamer got out of the channel and
struck on the south spit. After some
maneuvering she was backed of/ only to
go ashore again on the other side of the
channel.
At this point things began to look pretty
blue for the Grace Dollar, and those who
were aboard of her. The rudder and
rudder post carried away, the vessel was
leaking and it seemed to the passengers
as though the hull would soon break up.
In the nick of time the tug Columbia
hove in sight, and after a great deal of
trouble a line was got from the stranded
vessel to her. The men on the Grace
Dollar worked splendidly and launched
their life boat in spite of the heavy sea
that was running. When they got the
hawser aboard the Columbia it did not
take long to get the Grace Dollar Into
deep water and thence to a place of safe
ty in Coos Bay. She has been fixed up at
A. M. Simpson's yard and is expected
back here this morning.
In order to settle the matter the own
ers of the Grace Dollar have offered to
pay what they consider a fair amount
for the towing of their vessel to a place
of safety. The owners of the tug do not
look at it In that light, however, and
have made a demand for salvage. The
chances are that the courts will have to
decide the value of the services rendered
the Grace Dollar by the Columbia.
Vessels from Cardiff and Swansea for
Pacific Coast ports with coal seem to be
particulai'ly unfortunate. The Eaton Hall
for San Francisco was compelled to put
into Rio de Janeiro on the 3d inst. with
the loss of her boats and her deck dam
aged. The Banffshire for Victoria, B. C,
was nearly lost. Her cargo caught fire
and she had to be run into Montevideo and
the hold flooded before the fire was put
out. The chances are that she will not
reach this coast for some time, as the
surveyors have recommended the sale of
her cargo. The Routenburn, for San
Francisco, had to put into Rio de Janeiro
with her cargo shifted, and the Balmoral,
also for this port, was in collision with
the British ship Glenericht, also from
Swansea. The latter had to put back to
Montevideo with the loss of her mizz(?n
mast and other damages. At Montevideo
the captain of the Glenericht found the
bark Fiery Cross, from Cardiff for Puget
Sound, damaged to the extent of $10,000
In a storm.
Captain Nelson of the steamer President
reports that on September 3, in latitude
48:25 north, longitude 132:40 west, he spoke
the British ship Celtic Monarch, from
Japan to Victoria, B. C. Her captain
wished to be reported "all well."
The British steamer Glengyle, under
charter to the Pacific Mall Steamship
Company, arrived from the Orient yester
day morning. She brought 7 cabin pas
sengers, all from Honolulu; 9 steerage
passengers, 3 Japanese, and 37 Chinese.
Among the cabin passengers was Dr.
Clinton dishing, who has been spending
a vacation in Japan and Hawaii. The
Glengyle brings the news that the Ameri
can snip Baring Brothers, which caught
fire in Kobe harbor, had been towed into
shallow water and scuttled. It Is hoped
that some portion of the 1500 tons of cu
rios in her hold may be saved. Brady
and Huid, the two sailors who were ar
rested on suspicion of having set her on
fire, were released by United States Con
sul Lyons, as there was no evidence
against them.
The bark Electra arrived from Prince
Williams Sound yesterday with 35,000
cases of salmon and eighteen disgusted
gold hunters. They went to the Copper
River district and say one-half the tale
of misery endured by those who went out
on that wlldgoose chase has not been told.
Among the returned men are Sydney Wil
liams and Stanley Cameron of Oakland.
They say that hundreds of men are
stranded at Copper City unable to get to
this place or the Sound. They are with
out food, and some of them short of
clothing, and if help Is not sent there will
be many deaths from starvation before
the winter sets In. The returned gold
hunters say that a more poverty-stricken,
God-forsaken country than the Copper
River would be hard to find.
The Albatross went up to Mare Island
yesterday, where she will discharge her
armament and he turned over to the Fish
Commission again. The gunboat Benning
ton came down from the navy yard and
will start this afternoon or to-morrow for
Honolulu to relieve the cruiser Philadel
phia.
WAS NOT THE WIFE
OF QUACKENBUSH
THE ALLEGED WIDOW OF THE
CAPITALIST DEFEATED.
Judge Seawell Refuses to Recognize
Her Claim to Valuable Prop
erty â Her Name Is
Mrs. Dawson.
Judge Seawell filed a decision yesterday
In which he holds that the woman who,
for some time past, has chosen to call
herself Carlotta QuackfÂ»nbush, is entitled
solely to the name Dawson, and is not
the widow of the deceased capitalist,
Thomas M. Quackenbush. This, unless
the Supreme Court reverses the decision,
effectually disposes of the woman's claim
to one-half the property left by the de
ceased capitalist. Mrs. Dawson, as the
decision of the court makes her name,
commenced suit against Esther A. Swort
flguer, a daughter of Thomas M. Quack
enbush, to recover a widow's share of
the estate, on the alleged ground that
she was his wife by contract. The claim
ant testified that her name was Castro
when she met Quackenbush. They went
to live as man and wife, and a contract
they believed was sufficient was drawn
up between them. In 1579 she left him
and took up her residence with her son.
It developed during the trial that after
leaving Quackenbush the claimant mar
ried a man named Dawson. This was
fatal to her cause, and after reviewing the
case Judge Seawell held she was not mar
ried to Quackenbush at the time of his
death, and gave judgment for the de
fendant.
Caught in the Act.
William Carson, an ex-convict, was ar
rested at an early hour yesterday morn
ing by Policemen Colen and Douglass,
and later was booked at the City Prison
on charges of attempted burglary and
having burglars' tools in his possession.
Carson was discovered in the Grosvenor
House on Sutter street by the elevator
boy hiding In one of the bathrooms. When
searched a skeleton key and a picklock
were found in his possession.
Soldiers' Comfort Committees.
"What the Red Cross Society is doing
here for the soldiers' boards of trade and
other commercial bodies In the East are
doing for Uncle Sam's boys. This is
shown by a letter received yesterday by
the local Chamber of Commerce. The
letter is from Frank 8. Gardner of the
New York Board of Trade, and the writer
reQuests that the chamber appoint a
committee to look after the interests of
all soldiers en route to their homes who
may be in need of help. In the East
these committees are known as soldiers'
comfort committees. While the letter
will be presented to the meeting of the
directors, still it is not likely that any
action will be taken, as these matters are
being attended to by the Red Cross So
ciety, and, further, this city is not on the
lino of any route over which soldiers
wouM pass going to their homes.
BOTH LOVED THE WIDOW.
Two Hackmen Make a Discovery m
Court mat Nearly Ends in a
Fight.
Two hackmen, John Hunter and Frank
Miller, Lave been devotedly attached for
years to Mrs. Amelia Wilson, a buxom
widow living on Russ street, but it was
not till yesterday that they discovered
they were rivals, and the discovery nearly
led to a fight in Judge Conlan's court.
A daughter of Mrs. Wilson, Jda, 17
years of age, and her companion, Dora
Kendricks, 14 years of age, had been ar
rested for vag: ~ncy, and when they ap
peared in Judge Conlan's court yester
day morning both Hunter and Miller were
present to help the widow. They i.ad
been friends for years, but neither knew
of the other's attachment for the lady.
Hunter Is employed during the daytime
and Miller during the night, which ac
counts for each doing his courting with
out the knowledge of the other. When
the discovery was made there was trouble
and it required the combined efforts of
Bailiff Kelly ant; Policeman Behan to
prevent a fight in the courtroom.
The widow had to decide between the
two men. and Hunter was her choice.
Then Hunter wanted Mmer arrested for
stealing a powder box from Mrs. Wilson,
but the warrant was refused.
Mrs. Wilson's daughter and her com
panion were sent to the Magdalen
Asylum, and the Judge ordered a warrant
issued for the arrest of Mrs. Ida John
son, a woman living on Minna street, who
induced the two girls to enter upon a life
of shame, fixing her bonds in $1000.

FIELD DAY OF THE CADETS.
It Will Take Place at Glen Ellen To-
Morrow.
Last evening the board of officers of the
League of the Cross held an election of
officers at their headquarters and also
perfected plans for their field day excur
sion, to take place at Glen Ellen to
day. The meeting was presided over by
Colonel William P. Sullivan Jr. In the
election all three retiring officersâLieu
tenant Colonel Ryan and Majors D. J.
McGloin and D. C. Deasyâ were re-elect
ed, the former by unanimous acclamation
and the two latter by ballot. The only
new aspirant for the gold leaves was
Captain Harry F. Sullivan, but he was
defeated by D. J. McGloin b" seven votes.
The commanders of the different com
panies reported that they all expected to
bring an average of thirty cadets with
them to the excursion, which will bring
the number up to over EOO boys in line.
The regiment will form on Van Ness ave
nue at 7:30 a. m. and will from there
march to the ferry, headed by their band,
and take the 8:30 boat for Tiburon.

Has a New Manager.
The Manufacturers' and Producers' As
sociation has decided to branch out on
broader lines and enlarge upon its field of
usefulness in the way of promoting homo
industries and effecting commercial and
business reforms. In order to do so it was
necessary to enlarge the force of its em
ployes and the first step in this line has
been the engagement of E. Goodwin as
oneof the managers. The services of Oscar
Lewis are retained and he will have his
hands full attending to many matters that
he has had under control for some time
past, particularly with reference to the
Associated Industries, of which the asso
ciation is a member. Mr. Goodwin has for
many years been connected with the Gov
ernment at AVashington, being in the In
dian service of the Department of the In
terior. While in his Federal position he
has been on this coast on several occa
sions purchasing supplies for the wards of
Uncle Sam, and this experience, aside
from any other, has fitted him for the po
sition he now holds. Mr. Goodwin has
many friends on this coast.

CONTRACTORS
DIFFER OVER
PAGO-PAGO
Wide Margin in the Eight
Tenders Furnished.
SEVEN LOCAL FIRMS 810
NO AWARD TO BE MADE TTNTIB
DEPARTMENT APPROVES.
Deposits Were Not Required With
the Tenders, So That No Firm
Is Compelled to Carry
Out the Work.
Local contractors differ remarkably tn
their estimate of the cost of constructing
a coaling station for Uncle Sam on Pago-
Pago harbor In Samoa. When Commander
Tanner opened the tenders at noon yes
terday he found that each of the eight
firms to which he had sent out plans and
specifications had furnished a bid. But
the difference In the estimates was enor
mous. The lowest tenderers, Messrs.
Cotton Bros. & Co. of Oakland, profess
themselves willing to erect the coaling
sheds, wharf, etc., for the trifling sum of.
$133,397. The Rtsdon Iron Works, on tha
other hand, consider that the same serv
ice should be compensated by no less than
$255 .000. There is thus a margin of $122,000
between the estimates. The intermediate
bids are: Joseph McMahon, $162,000; Cali
fornia Bridge Company, $154,00j; Ely, Tib
bits & Co., $142,000; King Bridge Com
pany, Cleveland, Ohio, $217,000; City Im
provement Company, $207,000; San Fran
cisco Bridge Company, $164,300.
Commander Tanner cannot at present
give any Indication of the final award.
"You know," he said, "I have first to sub
mit the name of the tenderer to Washing
ton in order to ascertain If the firm
stands well with the department. And
since the excitement of the war rush haa
passed most of the Federal officials are
away taking a much-needed holiday. So
there may be some little delay."
A peculiar feature about this contract
is that, contrary to the usual custom, noi
deposits were required with the tenders.
Commander Tanner did this In order to
expedite matters and avoid red tape.
Consequently none of the firms who have
put in estimates are obliged to undertake
the work, unless they so choose. Hence
the final acceptance of the contract may
be delayed, commander Tanner has sub
mitted the name of the lowest tenderer to
Washington, and if the reply is satisfac
tory we will ask the firm to undertake
the work. If It declines to sjgn the con
tract, the next highest on the list mugt
be applied to, and so on, until a practi
cal bid is reached.
Thus it is impossible to say which of the
eight companies which have sent in offers
will carry out the work. Seven out of the
eight firms belong to California, so that
there Is a fair chance of the work being
dene on this coast. In any case the ma
terial will have to be shipped from here
and the skilled labor required engaged in
this city.
Commander Tanner does not consider
that it will be necessary to have a United
States man-of-war at Pago-Pago harbor
during the work of construction, which
will probably occupy over a year. But
It might be advantageous as a method of
keeping the natives in order and asserting
Uncle Sam's prestige.
"Now that the war is over," he pointed
out, "probably the usual round of naval
visits will be resumed, and undoubtedly
one of our war ships will visit Samoa. The
Bennington has gone to Honolulu, but if
she should get news of Importance by the
Australian mails she might go on to the
Samoan group."
ANGRY MILKMEN.
Leipsic Brothers Sued the Board of
Health for Big Damages.
Leipsic Brothers, milk dealers, filed suit
yesterday against J. P. Dockery, Milk In
spectcr, and the Board of Health, to re
cover J25.000 damages, alleged to hays
been sustained by reason of statements
given out that the plaintiffs sold Impure
milk, and that the arrest of Isaac Leipslo
for selling adulterated milk was malicious
and groundless. The plaintiffs In their
complaint allege that Dockery Is a grossly
and notoriously incompetent man in the
business of inspecting and testing milk
and cream, and does not and never aid un
derstand the first rudiments of the busi
ness. "He has never had the proper or
any schooling sufficient to fit him for the
business," states the complaint. "He has
been frequently intoxicated while on duty
and shows favoritism to many milkmen
who should be arrested and prosecuted
for selling impure milk and is maliciously
ruining the business of honest men."
Shortly after filing the c6mplaint In the
foregoing action Isaac Leipsic filed With
the Board of Health charges against
Dockery similar in their nature to those
made in the civil action, so far as the
Milk Inspector was concerned, namely, in
competency, intoxication while on duty,
favoritism to some and malicious perse
cution of others. Leipsic asks the privi
lege of appearing before the board with
witnesses to prove the truth of his asser
tions. As Dockery has gone to the Native
Sons' celebration at San Jose his version
of the controversy could not be obtained.
Verdict on the Whitelaw.
The United States Inspectors of Local
and Foreign Steam Vessels have conclud
ed their investigation into the cause of thÂ«
loss of the steamer Whitelaw by fire on
the 4th of March of this year at Skaguay.
and returned a report yesterday to the ef
fect that the fire was caused by sponta

VON ARNOLD'S
LEGAL WIFE
IS DESTITUTE
Sues the Bogus Baron
for Divorce.
ELOPED WITH JEANINE YOUNG
HOW D. M. DELMAS' NEMESIS
WAS CLEVERLY DUPED.
Presiding Superior Judg-e Belcher
Holds That Divorce Is a
Luxury and Should Be
Paid For.
The legal -wife of "Baron yon Turk
helm," a royal name assumed by Charles
J. yon Arnold, when the glitter of gold
caused him to c:ist honor to the winds,
entt-r into a pretended marriage with
Jeanine Young, the nemesis of the elo
quent lawyer D. M. Delmas, and flee to
foreign lands, is In this city toiling for a
livelihood. She no longer wishes that the
name Yon Arnold should make her many
cares the harder to bear, and yesterday
she applied to the Superior Court for a
divorce from the man who dishonored
himself and her and asks that she be al
lowed to resume her maiden name, Emma
Paul.
A decree of divorce is asked for by the
unfortunate woman on three groundsâln
fidelity, failure to provide and willful de
sertion. She asks for no alimony, per
haps knowing that even if the court saw
lit to award her any sum she asked it
would be next to impossible to collect it.
To substantiate the allegation of infidelity
Mrs. yon Arnold refers to the pretended
marriage between her husband and Jean
ine Young. This scandal, the more inter
esting by reason of the connection of the
eminent lawyer, whose life was made a
burden by the bride for months preced
ing the ceremony that was, in fact, a
farce, occurred in April of last year. After
the knot was tied, legally thought Jean
ine, illegally knew Yon Arnold, the couple
went to Montreal and thence to London.
They lived together its man and wife, and
this fact will undoubtedly be accepted by
the court as sufficient proof that the first
contention of the plaintiff is true. That
he deserted his wife there can also be no
question, and her allegation that he has
failed to provjde her with the common ne
cessities of life will be easy to substan
tiate.
George W. Monteith, who represents
Mrs. yon Arnold, Is greatly incensed at
the action of Judge Belcher in refusing to
allow the complaint for divorce to go on
record without prepayment of fees. Mrs.
yon Arnold is all but destitute. She is toil
ing here and there to keep body and soul
together, and the payment of several dol
lars to file the action for divorce was more
than her slender purse would admit. In
consequence her attorney appeared before
Judge Belcher yesterday and asked the
court to make an order remitting the pre
payment of fees in this case, explaining to
the court his client's distressed financial
condition. "Judge Belcher, notwithstand
ing my plea on behalf of this poor woman,
refused to make the order," said Mr. Mon
teith. "He stated that divorce was a lux
ury and that those who wished to enjoy
the luxury should pay for it. I demurred
to the stand taken by the Judge, but when
I found that he could not be moved, I In
formed him that I considered his stand in
the matter contemptible. We had a
stormy meeting and a stormier parting,
the result being that Mrs. yon Arnold had
to go from frfend to friend and borrow
the amount before the paper could be
placed on file. If Justice must be pur
chased, then the very poor are to be pitied
for Justice is not for them, at least on
earth."

BABY TOLAND
WILL HAVE A
BIG NESTEGG
Grandmother's Estate
Settled.
HE GAINS NEARLY $20,000
COMPROMISE EFFECTED AFTER
MANY DAYS.
The Boy's Attorneys Regard the
Agreement as a Restora
tion of His Inherit
ance.
The estate of Mrs. Mary B. Toland,
widow of Dr. H. H. Toland of the
medical college of that name, who died
in November, 1895, at the Occidental
Hotel In this city, has at last been set
tled after a bitter contest in the courts
of nearly three years' duration. By the
terms of the coi.. promise decedent's
grandson, William. Gridley Toland, will
receive nearly $20,000 in lieu of the
pittance bequeathed him under the pro
visions of the two wills left by her.
About ten dÂ»â 8 after Mrs. Toland's
i death Hugo H. Toland, her son, filed a
! document which he alleged to be her
last will and testament, at the same
'. time asking for letters of administra
! tion. In this will, which was rather
' eccentric in its verbiage and provisions,
Mrs. Toland left her grandson $20iW,
but the bulk of her estate, valued at
1 $100,000, she left to her son, Hugo H.
: Toland.
Mrs. Trella Toland, the daughter of
Mrs. Clara Foltz of this city and
mother of William Gridley Toland, at
once engaged Samuel M. Shortridge to
represent the latter's interests. Mr.
Shortridge immediately filed a contest
in behalf of his little client, at that
time but six years of age, claiming that
the will offered for probate as that of
Mrs. Toland was not signed by the tes
tator; that it was not duly witnessed,
and that the testator was not of sound
mind and was therefore incompetent to
make a will.
Contemporaneous with the filing of
the contest Mr. Shortridge demanded a
jury trial and this was granted, but as
the affairs of the estate required im
mediate attention no objection was
made to the issuance of special letters
of administration to Hugo H. Toland.
It must first be understood, however,
that the real objection to the probat
ing of the instrument alleged to be the
will of Mrs. Toland lay in the fact that
the gTandson had been deprived therein
of what his mother and his attorneys
regarded as his rightful inheritance.
They felt that he should have at least
one-half of the entire proceeds of the
estate, and that the paltry $2000 be
queathed him was not sufficient to sat
isfy them in their respective offices of
parent and counsel, charged with the
duty of preserving 1 his rights so long
as he was too young to decide for him
self in such matters.
MR. CHRISTIE FAILS
TO LEAVE HIS ADDRESS
HIS FRIENDS ARE ANXIOUS AS
TO HIS WHEREABOUTS.
It Is Intimated That He Is in Tem
porary Seclusion in the
Country.
The somewhat mysterious and unac
countable disappearance of J. A. Christie
Is causing considerable anxiety and In
quiry among his many friends. Mr. Chris
tie, who is a very popular young man,
had been for over six years the confiden
tial clerk of W. F. Goad, the well-known
lawyer and capitalist, who died a few
weeks ago. He was also secretary of the
Montgomery estate trustees, of whom Mr.
Goad was one, as well as being the attor
ney of the estate. The surviving trustee
of this estate Is A. W. Foster. It had been
rumored that Mr. Christie was short In his
accounts several thousand dollars, but bo
far as the Goad estate Is concerned the
attorney, Richard Bayne, emphatically
states that up to the present he knows of
no such shortage. Mr. Foster has made
a similar declaration regarding thfi ac
counts of the Montgomery estate. Mr.
Christie left the city without giving any
notice whatever to his employers, who are
very much mystified over his singular
conduct. They assert that they cannot In
any way at present account for it.
For eighteen months Mr. Christie had
rooms at the Burnett House. 1364
Market street. On Friday, August
19, he moved from the Burnett,
telling Mr. Hodge, the proprietor, that
he was going to take a room on Sutter
street with a family who recently came
from the East. They were his friends,
and his object was to assist them in a
financial way. Mr. Christie, however, is
evidently not In the city, at least quite a
thorough search by his friends has failed
to locate him In town. Mr. Hodge Bays
that a day or two after Christie's disap
pearance one of his intimate friends called
at the Burnett House and Intimated that
he had simply gone Into the country, but
for what length of time or for what ob
ject he did not say. Among the many
friends who have called at the Burnett to
make Inquiry waa Mr. Foster, who was
there two or three days ago and stated to
Mr. Hodge that Christie's accounts with
the Montgomery estate are correct. An
other friend hinted that there might be a
romance in the case.
Mrs. Hooker, daughter of the late Mr.
Goad, denies that Mr. Christie has run
away, but admits that he is out of sight,
or in other words is in temporary seclu
sion. She asserts that everythingâ what
ever it may beâ will be all right in time.
Mr. Christie stands high in the estma
tlon of all who know him. He is a man of
?'ood habits and moves in good society. So
ar no tangible reason can be given for
his absenting himself from his usual
haunts and place of business without leav
ing his address.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, JTRIBAY, SEPTEMBER 9, Ib9B.
MILLIONAIRE'S
WILL SAID TO
BE WITHHELD
William Black Makes
Grave Charges.
CARTER ESTATE FIGHT IS ON
NEPHEW OF THE DECEASED AC
CUSES HIS UNCLE.
The Uncle in Turn Has a Spicy Opin
ion of the Character and
Personality of His
Accuser,
The fight for the vast wealth of Thomas
Carter, the millionaire car builder who
died a short time ago, is on. William G.
Black, a nephew of the deceased, filed an
application in the Superior Court yester
day for special letters of administration
upon the estate.
There Is nothing 1 particularly significant
In this fact, but interest is Increased by
I an allegation made by the young man
j who seeks to administer the estate that a
brother of the deceased, Martin Carter,
junior member of the firm of Carter
| Bros., car builders, has a will, left by the
decedent, in his possession, which he re
| fuses to offer for probate. Young Black
states that the deceased left no lineal
i heirs, and that those who are entitled to
the property are two brothers, two sis
ters, a niece and a nephew of the de
ceased, he being the last named, axe al
leges that he is named in the will as one
I of the legatees, and in consequence is
i anxious that the estate be probated and
I distributed to the heirs.
Although frequently requested, he says
that his uncle refuses to offer the will for
probate and refuses to disclose the nature
of the estate and its exact value. This
I being the fact, the petitioner believes that
I the estate is suffering great damage and
I asks to be allowed to administer upon it
that further loss may be prevented.
Martin Carter, who is accused of with
holding the will, is of the opinion that
young Black is hardly capable of ad
ministering the estate and thereby pre
venting its damage, even though it were
suffering for want of a guiding nand. He
was found at his country home at lr
vington last night, and when informed of
his nephew's latest move he was in any
thing but an amiable mood.
"That boy," he declared, "is not re
sponsible for what he says or does. He
has fallen into the hands of lawyers, and
the result will only be to tie up the estate
Indefinitely. Young Black was out here
before his uncle had been buried a week
with lawyers trying to get his sister to
enter into the deal with him, but she re
fused to have anything to do with it. He
is a cripule and has epileptic fits and
spells. He Is absolutely irresponsible for
anything he does. He drinks, and this
makes him worse. While In one of these
spells he has fallen easy prey to any who
see an opportunity to bleed him.
"My brother Thomas made provision for
every one of his relatives and heirs, and
in due time the estate will be distributed,
but this act of my nephew's will not
hurry matters at all. I am now engaged
in the preliminary steps necessary to
make a showing, and as I have thirty
| days I shall not be in any hurry to do so
I till I am ready. Further than this I ao
I not care to discuss the matter, as I am
anxious to avoid all publicity, and i would
much rather that not a word should be
said as coming from me, as I have not
talked before.
William G. Black is the son of a sister
of the Carter brothers, Mrs. George
Black, who lived in Oakland before her
death several years ago. His sister, Miss
Georgia, resides with Martin Carter, and
he did until he became a burden by rea
son of his social habits when ho went to
Oakland. Last Saturday he is said to
have had an epileptic fit at Centerville.
PRECITA VALLEY CLUB.
Wants a Park Completed and tne
Bryant Street Sewer Nuis
ance Abated.
The Precita Valley Improvement Club
Is now forcing with renewed vigor upon
the Board of Supervisors its former de
mands, which have laid dormant for so
long a time.
This is an old club, and has Its regu
lar meetings. Treasurer John T. Gra
ham, who is one of the main workers,
said: "Our principal proposition just now
is to complete Bernal Park, which means
the filling of Bryant street from Twenty
sixth to Army. The Board of Supervis
ors have been asked for an appropriation
of $12,000 to be used for this purpose. It
13 now an assured fact that the money
will be soon forthcoming:, and then we
will have one of the prettiest little places
of recreation In the city. The contem
plated park is to be 800 feet long and 120
feet wide. The city owns the land, and
has paid $6500 for the street work sur
rounding It already.
"Another thing," said Mr. Graham, "Is
the abatement of the Bryant street sewer
nuisance. That sewer now dumps and
gives out Its poisonous germs from
Twenty-sixth to Army streets, endanger
ing the lives of thousands of people. It
could be obviated if It was filled in from
Twenty-sixth to Army streets, but we
cannot have It done. The contract has
been let to John Kelso, but he has delay
ed the work to such an extent that the
matter may have to be taken out of his
hands. This pestilence affects Immedi
ately the children of the Columbian
Grammar School, the St. Peter's School,
under the charge of the Sisters of Mer
cy, where hundreds of children go, and
also the residents in that vicinity.
"This large sewer takes the drainage
from the Twenty-fourth, Twenty-fifth
and Twenty-sixth street sewers. There
fore the nuisance may be easily imag
ined."
FAST SERVICE.

BRITISH TRIBUTE
TO COLONEL HAY
Congratulations Alloyed
With Regrets.
AN ANGLO-AMERICAN ADDRESS
BOND OF SYMPATHY BETWEEN
THE NATIONS.
Cemented by the Eminent Tact and
Courtesy of the Retiring Em
bassador â A Happy
Response.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Sept. B.â A committee of
the Anglo-American League, headed by
its chairman, James Brice, presented
the United States Embassador, Colo
nel John Hay, to-day with an address
congratulating him upon his accept
ance of the portfolio of Secretary of
! State at AVashln^ton. The address ex
| pressed regret at his departure from
| this country, "where you have dis
! charged the weighty and delicate dv-
J ties of Embassador with such eminent
I tact, judgment and courtesy as to win
the cordial appreciation and confidence
of the British people."
Continuing, the address says: "It
i has been your fortune to represent your
country here at a time of exceptional
interest, when the war, now happily
ended, gave occasion for an expression
of the feelings of affection and sympa
thy toward the United States, which
the British people have long enter
tained, but never before have they been
so conspicuously manifested. You
carry back the assurance of the depth
and strength of these feelings. The
1 principle that there ought to be perma
nent friendship and cordial co-opera
! tion between the British empire and
I the American republic lÂ» one that all
I parties and all statesmen here agree in
1 regarding as a fundamental principle
| of British foreign policy, and by it the
whole people desire that their govern
ment should be guided.
"We rejoice to believe that in your
country corresponding sentiments are
entertained and that corresponding
; principle is now largely accepted.
\ Knowing that no one holds these con
1 victions more firmly than yourself, or
j can express them in clear and more
felicitous terms, we gladly acknowledge
I the great service you have rendered to
â  both nations, and console ourselves on
; your retirement by the reflection that
i you are called to duties in your own
country even wider in their scope and
graver in their responsibility and more
important In the results they may se
! cure."
Mr. Brice, during the course of the
j remarks which he made upon the oc
i casion, dwelt on the "admiration for
the splendid gifts and boundless en
ergy of the people of the United States
and the sympathy with the principles
of their constitution," which have been
quietly ripening among the British
people and which this year found a
sudden and hearty expression. He
also said he saw in the universality of
i these sentiments here, and the fact that
! they were reciprocated by a large ma
jority of the Americans, a happy au
gury, as he believes that nothing could
contribute more to the peace of the
world and the welfare of both nations
than the sense of essential unity of
the two peoples.
Colonel Hay, in reply, referred to the
gratification he experienced in hearing
such words from men so qualified by
experience and character to speak for
the British with certainty. He added:
"My voice has no such sanction as
yours, but I give it for what it is worth
to assure you that your sentiments of
kinship and amity are reciprocated to
the utmost in my country."
The Embassador also said that his
work in England had been made easy
by the instructions he had received
from home and by the frankness and
fairness of her Majesty's Ministers and
of all Englismen with whom he had
come in contact. He then aid: "On
sides of the ocean the conviction is al
both sides of the ocean the conviction
is almost universal that a clear, cordial
and friendly understanding between
Great Britain and the United States is
a necessity of civilization. I shall hold
myself signally fortunate if I am able
to do anything to continue and
strengthen the relations of fraternal
amity between our nations."
THE EIGHTH REGIMENT.
Soldiers Jubilant Over the Pay
master's Coming This
Morning.
CAMP BARRETT, BATHER TRACT,
Sept. B.â Never since the advent of the
Eighth Regiment at Camp Barrett has
enthusiasm run as high as to-day, when
the welcome news was received from
headquarters that Uncle Sam's paymaster
will visit the camp to-morrow and pay
off.
The men are also jubilant over the fact
that six companies of the Eighth will
break camp next Saturday and go to Fort
Vancouver, while the other campanies
will also be apportioned for garrison duty
at Alcatraa, Benicia and at Fort Point.
There has been considerable talk about
the spread of typhoid fever at Camp Bar
rett and the fact that eight cases have
been recently reported. Regimental Sur
geon and the hospital officers, however,
emphatically deny all such reporte.
"There have been but two coses under
suspicion of typhoid, but nothlngserious,"
said one of the officers to-night. More
over, Colonel Henshaw has been person
ally inspecting the camp and has given
many orders in regard to cleanliness.
BOBBED A KLONDIKEB.
Three Men and Two Women Arrested
on Complaint of Peter Frish.
Charles Erickson, Frank McGill, Ben
Riggans, Aggie Evans and Nellie Brown
were arrested last evening on the sus
picion that they were implicated in the
robbery of Peter Frish, a returned Klon
diker, who claims that he was relieved
of $500. Frish is staying at the Com
mercial Hotel, and Monday night went
out to see the town. About 6 o'clock the
next morning he found himself in the
Gold Field Saloon, 914 Kearny street,
owned by Charles Erickson, and began
to have a good time with the inmates
of the place. He finally became Intoxi
cated, and while in that condition was
knocked down and robbed of $500.
The miner did not report the matter to
the police until yesterday afternoon, when
Detectives Wren and Dlnan and Officers
Cavanaugh, Williams and McMahon were

ANNEXATION OR
INDEPENDENCE
Question Now Discussed
in Havana.
FAVOR UNCLE SAM'S AID
REPUBLIC UNDEB AMERICAN
PROTECTION POPULAR.
Union Expected Between the Rad
ical Autonomists and the
Leaders of the
Insurgents.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
HAVANA, Sept. B.â Annexation or
independence. These are the words that
Havana is conjuring with to-day. A
long wait for the arrival of the Ameri
can Commission had an effect on the
nerves of the populace already keyed
to a breaking point by three months of
blockade hunger.
A vast amount of political discussion
is being done. At first the composite
opinion of all men of property or posi
tion, or even of respectability, was for
annexation. During the last week the
voice of the ultra Cuban party, the ir
reconcilables, is for independence or
nothing.
A union has been effected between
what is known as the radical autono
mists and insurgent leaders. A plat
form has been arranged and a definite
plan of action been agreed upon, urg
ing the claims for absolute independ
ence upon the American Commission
ers. The leaders of the radical auton
omist party are Eduardo Dolz and
Elizo Giberga. Dolz is a member of
Blanco's autonomist Cabinet. Up to
the time of the signing of the protocol
he was loud in protests of loyalty to
Spain. Giberga is a Havana lawyer,
for years prominent In autonomist
councils. These two men are in con
stant communication with the insur
gents, and personally visited during the
last few days nearly all the insurgent
leaders in Havana province. Speaking
of the new party Mr. Dolz said to me:
"The principles of our new movement
for independence are but little under
stood. We believe in independence â
for the good of Cuba, mark you â not
for the good of the insurgents or auton
omists nor any particular class or
party, but the entire population of the
island, without regard to their previous
political opinions. We have the same
mistrust of the insurgents' disorderly
methods that the annexation party has,
but declare that here in Havana and
other cities of Cuba are men capable of
governing, who understand Cuba's na
tional character and needs far better
than any Americans do. We do not say
absolute independence will be an im
mediate success. We must have a pro
tectorate by the United States, but let
the protectorate be withdrawn as soon
as possible."
It Is still far less difficult to obtain
interviews in Havana favoring annex
ation than statements in support of Cu
ban independence. As far as can be
estimated, also, the supporters of an
nexation are a more numerous body In
the city and certainly among those of
the highest standing, representing
property and commercial interests.
DISCUSSING THE TAX LEVY.
Much Planning Necessary to Keep
Within Legal Limits.
OAKLAND, Sept. B.â The City Council,
sitting as a committee of the whole, pro
ceeded this evening with the work of fix
ing the tax levy. It was decided to al
low enough money to place two free read
ing rooms in the annexed district. TTTe
estimates for the School Department, ag
gregating 1302,479, will be taken up next
Monday evening when the Board of Edu
cation will be present.
An animated discussion took place over
the matter of placing $80,000 in the tax
levy for the dredging of Lake Merritt,
and Auditor Snow stated that there
are many problems yet to be solved before
the legal aspect of the matter is clear.
Mr. Snow had cut the amount to $42,000
on the ground that the amount had better
be placed in the levy of two fiscal years.
Messrs. Girard and Cuvelller were of the
same opinion, and Woodward advised
them to stand by their colors, which caused
a laugh. Woodward said the next Coun
cil might complete the work, and Girard
said there need be no worry, as no doubt
Woodward could be elected unanimously,
and this created much amusement.
Auditor Snow made a speech that sug
gested many difficulties in the way of
making all the improvements contemplat
ed. He said that under the law the money
obtained for parks and boulevards could
not be used for any other purpose, not
even building bulkheads. He also hinted
that there were 16,000 tax payers who
would not be directly benefited by the im
provement and who would not pass by
any chance to block It. Further, there is
the annexed district to be considered, as
the legality of the matter is still before
the Supreme Court. Mr. Snow's speech
was somewhat of a damper. As the tax
levy, independent of the Lake matter,
cannot legally exceed $1 27 there will have
to be much pruning yet done in the de
partments, as the estimates at present
call for about $1 50.
Persistent Socialists.
OAKLAND, Sept. B.â Another street
speaker, Thomas Bersford, was arrested
to-night on Broadway, and put up $20
ball. This makes the fourth socialist ar
rested during the last four nights, and
the leaders say there are twenty-five more
men and women that will be arrested at
the rate of one a night. Each will de
mand a jury trial, and they declare they
will carry the matter to the Supreme
Court to test the ordinance prohibiting
street Bpeaking within the fire limits. In
the Police Court to-day E. J. Grebs plead
ed not guilty and his case was set for
September 23, the day after the Wilklns
trial. The case of James Andrews was
set for the 27th.
Captain Carson in Danger.
OAKLAND, Sept. B.â Captain Frank
Carson, of the Police Department, who
has been sick for some time with appen
dicitis, was worse to-day, and this after
noon underwent an operation. He pos
sesses a vigorous constitution, and this.
It is believed, may carry him through. At
a late hour to-night the patient was slum
bering.
Is Charles Pecker Faking?

POPULAR
CANDIDATE
Irving M.Scott May B<
the People's Choice.
AS A NOMINEE FOR MAYO
A GENERAL DEMAND FOR HIM
TO LEAD THE PARTY.
Maguire Succeeds in Again Making
Himself Unpopular With the
German Democrats of
the City.
Although the date of the Republican
municipal convention has not yet been
fixed much speculation Is being In
dulged in regarding the choice of the
party for Mayor. There are many
available candidates among the solid
men of the community, but with 6O
many to choose from there is much
uncertainty and diversity of opinion as
to the particular man upon whom the
choice should fall.
It is this uncertainty that has led
many of the leading Republicans of the
city to express a wish that individual
preferences be set aside and that all
unite in asking Irving M. Scott to ac
cept the nomination. Mr. Scott arrived
in New York a few days ago after an
extended visit to Continental Europe
In behalf of the industrial and commer
cial interests of the Pacific Coast. He
Is due to arrive in San Francisco with
in a few days, and it is more than
probable that upon his arrival here he j
will be approached on the subject that |
Is now uppermost in the minds of those
interested in local municipal affairs.
It is pointed out by the Republican j
leaders that Mr. Scott is perhaps the !
most popular man in California to-day i
bat bis popularity extends to peo- j
pie of all classes and conditions. If he
can be induced to accept the nomina
tion there is no doubt but that he j
would be elected by a majority exceed- j
ing that ever given a candidate of any
party In this city. Having the confi
dence of the people it is certain that he
could and wou.d bring order out of the
chaos that has characterized the con
duct of municipal affairs in San Fran
cisco for so many years.
old Mr. Scott express a reluctance
to enter into public life and thus neg
lect his groat private interests it will
be urged that the term is a shurt one :
an d ; good citizen he owes it
to himself and the community at large
to surrender personal Interests and de-
Mmself to a cause that vitally ef
fects every man, woman and child in j
ban Francisco.
-Much dissatisfaction is being mani
fested on the Democratic side concern
ins the conduct of the affairs of the
party in bjoth the city and State. Now
that v ha.s become apparent to the
dullest among them that Lhe affairs of
vnÂ« pa.it y have been given into the
ing uf the members of the Clan
there can be no doubt as to
â¢what the result will be. In the im
probable event of Magulre's election all
of the fat appointments in the State
will be parceled out to the members of
the clan and the real workers In the
party will be left to a discussion of the
husks. In Ran Francisco the result of
a Democratic victory would be the
same. The Gallaghers, the Manns, tfie
Treacys, the Leggetts and the elect of
the band of single-taxers will secure
the cream of the patronage to the total
exclusion of the party workers. Even
under present conditions no less than a
scnre of the members of the clan are
feeding at the public crib. If the Ma
gruire-Gallagher-Phelan combination
â Is in gaining control of local af
lairs the number will be trebled.
Jud^e Maguire made an attempt yes
terday to "square" himself with the
an Democrats of the city by ap
pointing Oscar Hocks, a member of the
German Democratic Central Club, to
a place on the Democratic State Cen
tral Committee. When Magulre ap
pointed the twenty-one members at
large of the State committee he ignored
the request of the German Club for
rocornitlon. He then added insult to
injury by appointing Dr. Max Magnus,
a man who Is anything but popular
with the memh-rs of the German Club.
"vVh^n this action became known Ma
prulre was informed that he must re
pair his mistake or suffer the loss of
the support of the German Democrats
of the city. This he promised to do.
In the meantime, however, he appointed
Dr. Maernup a member of the purity
committee (if the State committee. Now
that he has appointed Mr. Hocks as a
member of the State committee he finds
that the act has not in any way bet
tered his condition so far as the Ger
man Democrats are concerned.
E. 1,. Hutchison, the Populist nominee
for Lieutenant Governor, was in the
city yesterday. He intends going to
Fan Jr>.cr> to-day to make love to the
Native Rons. He is very popular with
tho old line Democrats. In this re
ppect he divides the honors with J.
Aubrey Jones and Judge Van Dyke.

tion was presented as being progressive,

chape ac regards the municipal delegates.
The State nominees were Indorsed. ,
POPS BATTLING
FOR THE NAME
The Big Fight to Open
Saturday.
SECRETARY BROWN TO DECIDE
- - - ; â 
â â _â
SHAN AHAN WILL MAKE A VIG
. OROUS CAMPAIGN.
The Voters in the Outraged Party
Are Combining ,to Defeat
the Fusion
Ticket,
A big legal battle between the regular
Populists and the fusionists for the party
designation on the official ballot will be
formally opened at Sacramento to-mor
row.
The initial decision In the matter must
be given by Secretary of State Brown,
with whom all State tickets must be filed
within a specified time. To-day is the
sixtieth and last day prescribed by law,
but it being a legal holiday. Secretary
Brown has notified the representatives of
the opposing factions of the Populist
party that he will receive their tickets
I and briefs and hear their arguments on
I Saturday at 10 a. m. Thomas V. Cator
will appear for the middle-of-the-road-
Bters, and he is preparing a brief which
; will make a very strong showing for the
I genuine party which was bo ignominlously
sold out to the Democracy.
The Populist State Central Committee
is more than confident that Secretary
Brown will decide in their favor, but if
Ihe does not the fight will be at once
I taken to the Supreme Court. The fuslon
i lsts will doubtless do the same thing if
they are decided against, so a light to the
finish Is assured.
Shanahan and the State Central Com
mittee are waiting for this decision before
opening the campaign. Should they se
cure the recognition they claim to be en
i titled to the Populist State campaign will
j be opened at once in the most vigorous
I style. Shanahan promises to make a lively
gubernatorial fight, and the great ma
jority of the party which remains loyal
to its principles and which repudiates fu
i sion as the fruit of a base betrayal will
rally in a fashion that will be uncom
fortable for the Pinto Populists and their
friends.
The decision as to whom the name
"People's party" belongs will have very
important results. If the regular Popu
liats ultimately lose, the Shanahan ticket
and the campaign will likely be aban
doned, for the candidates could run only
as Independents after filing a petition re
quiring 10,000 names.
If the fusion wing loses the Populist
candidates on the fusion ticket will have
to go on the ballot as simply Democrats.
Even the Silver Republican candidates on
the hybrid ticket, McCraney and Van
Dyke, would appear as pure Democrats
and nothing more.
The general and to-be-expected revolt of
the great majority of the Populists
against the fusion arrangement is show
ing itself daily in Increasing strength. The
great body of the party is filled with a
spirit of independence and loyalty. It
snows itself in the voluminous correspond
ence received from all over the State by
<arleton H. Johnson, secretary of the
State Central Committee, which has its
headquarters in the Parrott building, and
also in the way that county committees
are reorganizing.
"The Populists generally throughout the
State feel that they have been sold out
and they are knifing fusion right and
left." said Secretary Johnson yesterday.
"We expect now that Shanahan will poll
as large a vote as Webster did four years
ago. To show how repugnant fusion is to
the mass of the party, two years ago,
even with all the whoop for Bryan, 20.000
Populists voted for the Populist electors,
when there was a doubt that the vote
would be totalized an<l the State Central
Committee urged all Populists to vote for
the Democratic electors. You remember
that the same fusion electors appeared
twice on the ballotâ once as Democrats
and once as Populists.
"The county committees are being rap-
I idly reorganized and there will soon be
j straight People's party organizations in
! all the counties. In Shasta, Tuolumne,
i Tulare and other counties straight county
I tickets have already been nominated. In
j Kings County it was agreed to support a
county fusion ticket, but all Populists are
to support the Shanahan ticket. Lines
are being closely drawn and no Populist
will be supported for a local office who
! will not support the straight State ticket.
i Populist local fusion candidates thus do
not dare to support Maguire, even if so
Inclined. The members of the party feel
outraged and they are bound to beat fu
son. No county convention which rati
fies fusion is recognized by the State
! Central Committee-."
A howl of indignation is being raised
i throughout the State by a circular which
has been sent out by George D. Gillespie,
secretary of the State Central Committee
of the fusion Pops. It is sent to State Cen
tral Committeemen and levies a tax of 50
cents "upon each candidate who comes be
; fore the several county conventions of the
People's party desiring nomination for
j public office, whether the candidate is
! successful before the convention or not."
j This applies to Democrats eeekinp fusion
I nominations as well. It is explained that
i expensive legal battles are in siKht and the
four-bit pieces are wanted to fight "those
who are attempting to Bteal the party
name."
North End Republican Club.
The Republicans of the north end of
the Forty-first Assembly District met last
night and organized the North End Re
publican Club. E. M. Galvin was elected
president and L. J. Hart secretary. It
was decided to hold a mass-meeting In the
district at Plxley Hall in two weeks. Hon.
Z. T. Dodge was unanimously Indorsed
for State Senator from the Twenty-second
District, and J. L. Waller for Supervisor
of the Second Ward.
Republicans Are Active.
The Republican voters of Precinct No.
3 of the Thirty-fourth Assembly District
met last evening at Progress Hall and or
ganized a permanent club. Seventy mem
bers signed the roll. The officers elected
were Charles J. Klass. president, and W
J. Winterbottom, secretary. The club will
meet again at the same place on the
evening of September 21.
The Bear Club.
The Bear Club held a meeting last even
ing and indorsed ..he nomination of Julius
Kahn for Congress. A. B. Truman, Ed J.
Casey, A. W. Voorsanger, George O'Neill
J. T. Hayes, John Woods and others made
remarks for Republican success.
"Lucrezia Borgia" at the Tivoli.
The second opera of this noteworthy
week at the Tivoli was "Lucrezia Borgia,"
composed by Donizetti. This venerable
opus has a very strong libretto, and its
music is well adapted to inspire the sing
ers to their best capabilities. Alfonso,
Duke of Ferrara, was sung by the effer
vescent artist, Willjam Pruette. with his
usual dash and spirit, and could not have
been in better hands. His strong bary
tone is ideally suited to these heavy
parts, where manliness and knightly gal
lantry Is Invaluable. Frl. Marie Brandts
as Lucrezia was very good, if one makes
allowance of her German schooling, which
seems out of place at times with a cast
of other artists. Her voice, however, is
strong and pleasing and under control at
all times. Zerni's Gennaro deserves great
credit, as his masterful rendition of one of
the most difficult parts in Italian opera
showed that there are great possibilities
in store for this young artist. Mr. Schus
ter as Gubetta was a refined, well-studied
performance, and Miss Elvla Crox as
Mafflo impressed the audience to due ap
preciation.

Weston Trusdale, editor of thÂ« San
Leandro Standard, is in a peck of trou
ble over a misunderstanding concerning
a word which he used in one of bis edi
torials of recent date.
"I have incurred the enmity of a dis
tinguished local Republican," says Trus
dale, "because I stated last week that
during the past few years the San Le
andro Republicans had made many pros
elytes. This learned gentleman hastened
to Inform me with much indignation that
the Republican party is one of high mor
ality, and that it never made a proselyte
in its life. Moreover, he wants the
Standard to apologize for 'casting a dirty
slur on the Republicans of San Leandro.'
I don't know what my indignant friend
thinks the word 'proselyte' means, but
I suppose he thinks it signifies something
very bad. Anyhow he is welcome to any
apology he may see fit to require."
The Democrats are now beginning to
wake up, and are looking for county can
didates. Justice St. Sure of Alameda
would like to be District Attorney, and
Edward A. Holman, N. J. Manons and
R. B. Myers are also spoken of in case
fusion is agreed upon. Charles E. Lloyd,
J. C. McLeod and R. M. McKillican are
mentioned for Sheriff. County Treasurer
Sanford will try to succeed himself.
Thomas Moran of the Fourth Ward may
be a candidate for Supervisor, and J. M.
Shay may run for the Assembly In the
Forty-ninth District. Seth Mann is a can
didate for State Senator from his dis
trict. Colonel J. J. Lyon is now in town,
and he will probably be a candidate for
some office.
The Democratic County Central Com
mittee will meet on Saturday evening to
fix the date of the primaries and the
county convention. The Populist Coun
ty Central Committee has called the pri
maries for September 20, but has not yet
fixed a date for the county convention,
which is to be determined by the chair.
It is now believed to be probable that
the convention of the Populists will be
on the same day as the Democratic gath
ering, and that a fusion plan of naming
the candidates will be agreed upon.
SUTRO'S ESTATE
WELL CARED FOR
THE ADMINISTRATORS ENTER
UPON THEIR DUTIES.
Ask the Court for Permission to Ex
pend the Entire Income for the
Maintenance of the
Property.
Mrs. Dr. Emma Merritt and W. R. 11.
Adamson, who last week were appointed
special administrators of the estate of
the late Adolph Sutro, have entered upon
their duties with a vim. Yesterday they
filed a petition in the Superior Court for
permission to expend money toward the
maintenance and improvement of the es
tate. The petitioners state that the
monthly expense of the baths, the Cliff
House, Sutro Heights and of the valu
able library left by the deceased philan
thropist amounts to about $5000. This
amount, they state, is about equal to the
present income of the estate, and they ask
to be allowed to expend the entire in
come for the purposes set forth. Besides
the Immediate expenses of the estate the
petitioners state that In the near future
an assessment of $2 a share on the stock
of the Sutro Railroad Company, held by
the estate, must be met, which will de
duct no immaterial sum from the assets
In the possession of the executors. It is
not thought that the heirs to the estate
will make any objection to the petition, as
a thorough care of the property will en
hance its value, and when the day for dis
tribution comes all will reap the 'benefit.

PHELAN IS
RENOMINATED
FOR MAYOR
Unanimous Choice of
the Non-Partisans.
POINTED QUESTIONS ASKED
A PLATFORM WAS PRESENTED
BUT NOT ADOPTED.
It Was Announced That Phelan,
Like Maguire, Will Stand
on Any Kind of a
Platform.
James D. Phelan was renominated for
Mayor last night by the Citizens' Non-
Partisan Convention. The delegates were
so anxious to carry out that part of their
work that they could not wait until a
platform had been adopted. It was an
nounced on behalf of Phelan, however,
that he would subscribe to any platform
adopted by the convention. The Mayor
has evidently taken lessons from James
Gallagher Maguire, the Populist-Silver
Republican-Democratic nominee for Gov
ernor, who has swallowed three plat
forms.
The convention was called to order by
George K. Fitch shortly after 8 o'clock,
and a call of the roll by Secretary Isaac
T. Milliken showed that a Quorum was
present.
The first order of business waa the re
ceiving of the report of the committee on
platform. Frank J. Sullivan, a brother
in-law of Mayor Phelan, announced that
the committee was ready to report. He
then proceeded to read tne report, which
is published In these columns in full.
When Sullivan concluded reading the
platform prepared. George L. Center
claimed the attention of Chairman Fitch.
He said that he thought section 16, relat
ing to the purchase of lands by the city,
was not couched in terms strong enough
to show the feeling of the people in re
gard to the looting of the public treasury.
"It Is time that these raids on the treas
ury, made under the guise of municipal
improvement, should be stopped," said he,
"and we should pledge our candidates to
light against these raids. Take, for in
stance, the proposed purchase of land for
a zoo. Every one knows what it means."
"That matter was considered by the
committee," replied A. \V. Halliday, "and
the conclusion arrived at was that the
present Board of Supervisors would not be
able to carry through the project."
"By the way," inquired Delegate "Web
ster, "why is it that Mayor Phelan is the
only official commended? Why not name
the honest members of the Board of Su
pervisors and the honest members of the
Board of Education?"
"We have only one Mayor," replied
Halliday. "and consequently no invidious
distinctions can be made.
"I would like to know, Mr. Chairman,"
persisted Webster, "if it is a hard Job to
put one's finger on the honest men 'v>n
both boards?"
E. J. Le Breton put a stop to further
discussion on that line by moving that
the matter of adopting the platform be
laid over for one week. The motion pre
vailed with a suggestion that any mem
bers having alterations or amendments to
offer present them in the meantime to the
committee on platform for consideration.
The report of the committee on order
of business and rules was adopted with
out discussion.
The question as to whether the candi
dates for Supervisors could be selected
from any part of the city or whether
they must be taken from the ward In
which they live, was referred to the Judi
ciary comittee.
The committee on municipal nomina
tions reported progress. Chairman Lie
Breton said the names of various aspi
rants had been canvassed, but that no
conclusion had been arrived at other than
one. the office of Mayor. "The commit
tee," said he in conclusion, "decided to
unanimously recommend James D. Phe
lan for renomination."
On motion of L. Altschul It was decided
to increase the county committee from
twenty-five to forty members. It was
further decided that any member who ab
sented himself from three consecutive
sessions of the convention without satis
factory excuse would be considered as
having resigned.
Delegate Perkins then moved that .the
rules be suspended and that the conven
tion proceed to nominate a candidate for
Mayor. The motion was carried, and Le
Breton placed Phelan in nomination. He
said that Mayor Phelan had carried out
all of the promises he made to the Non-
Partisan convention two years ago, and
that he thought it would only be a grace
ful compliment to nominate him before
any of the other conventions met. "We
desire to see him again in the chair,"
said Le Breton, "and we further desire
that any higher aspirations he may have
will not prevent him being the first May
or of San Francisco under the new char
ter."
There were no other nominations, and
the secretary was instructed to cast the
ballot for Phelan. When his nomination
was officially announced the delegates
rose and gave three cheers for Phelan.
The convention then adjourned to meet
next Thursday night after instructing
Secretary Milliken to telegraph to Mayor
Phelan officially notifying him of his
nomination.
The question asked by Delegate Web
ster why the honest members of the
Board of Supervisors were not mentioned
in the platform was not relished by Phe
lan's friends. It is a matter of political
history that Phelan refused to head the
Democratic municipal ticket two years
ago unless he was allowed to name the
Supervisors. He named them, and every
time the "Solid Nine" is mentioned Phe
lan has the shivers, for he is the political
foster father of the majority of them.
NON-PARTISAN PLATFORM.
The Non-Partisan party, composed of men
of various political parties, exists solely to
protect the best Interests of the city of.
Ban Francisco and Its. citizens.
It proclaims Its absolute freedom from
political bias and Its non-interference in
national or State politics, except when nec
essary to protect municipal interests.
Called Into existence by i the disgraceful
condition of affairs that has developed since
the dissolution of : the old People's party
arid the wanton disregard for the rights and
Interests of the â  citizens of; San Francisco;
in the management of municipal affairs the
Non-Partisan party proposes to influence the
coming municipal election in the Interest
of good' and honest government. , ,- % â 
"With the approval of the new charter by
the vote of the , people the prospect of a
better government baaed on . business prin- 9
ciples and . pledged -to economy, and effi
ciency encourages the â  Non-Partisan party
in the belief that the citizens of San Fran-.
Cisco desire good government and . will sup
port its nominees in | the coming election.
The Non-I'artiean party recognizes that
In the government of a city ' party politics
has no place, and that â¢ the â¢ hordes of hun
gry followers of - political : bosses - must -be
driven from the City Hall, which they, have
polluted too long with â  their dishonest prac
: tices, their bribery v and corruption. .- The
management "of â  city affairs must -be taken '
from = their inefficient < and wasteful â  hands .
and given to honest and competent officers.
We believe the time has arrived when the
people of San Francisco will no longer sub
mit to be ruled and plundered by dishonest :
: and ':â  political . bosses. The Non-Partlsan
party Â» therefore â  announces â  the â¢ following '
principles, : which â  shall guide Its * nominees, â¢
and declares ; the i same * to be ; the platform
on which they must stand: I ; r v â .*.
â¢ 1. This convention will . nominate - for of
fice,' irrespective of party or. party nomina
tions, such men as it believes to be honest,
capable and fit for the office for which they
are nominated, and .will not nominate or in
dorse any candidate for the Legislature who
has not agreed in writing to vote for the
ratification; of the new charter. -
-: 2. The - convention ;â¢; condemns .. any effort :
to defeat the nomination or election of men
because eof '. religious belief. â¢- It ' believes -In ?
freedom ) of I speech i and I affirms 4ts | loyalty
to . those wise j provisions of the I Federal and I
State 'â ' constitutions : - which *â " guarantee, to
every citizen I the | fullest I religious ! liberty. v'
;K 8. The ; public - schools â¢we t consider ; espe- 1
..oUUk Uie flttlcKUÃrd ot our public lastltu
tions and personal liberties. The effi
ciency of the school should be Increased,
Its Instruction simplified, industrial educa
tion should be foetered, the sanitary con
dition of the schooihouses and ths phyÃi
cal development of the pupils should re
ceive the attention and care of the teach
ers. In order to Insure the best work we
insist on the prompt payment of the salar
ies of the teachers and other employes of
the School Department. The appropriation
made last year was adequate to the needs
of the department economically adminis
tered. "With shameless disregard for the
interests of the public and the children
much of this money was wasted in Jobbery.
Teachers must be paid by law, Irrespective
of the appropriation made. The present
board has diverted the money set aside for
their Balaries and forced a deficit, which
must be made up in this fiscal year. This
act is a fraud upon the public and merits
the severest condemnation.
4. We demand that the same rules which
govern a well-conducted business house
shall apply to the government of the city
of San Francisco, and we, therefore,
pledge our nominees to an economical ana
Judicious administration of our municipal
affairs and limit them to an expenditure
not exceeding one dollar on the one hun
dred dollars of assessable property, within
a limit of 13,500,000, for all municipal pur
poses.
6. Renewed efforts should be made to re
move the Police and Fire Departments
from politics. We believe that the effi
ciency of both these departments ehould be
increased. We require that it shall be
the duty of every patrolman to enforce
the ordinances of the city and to note and
report to the Chief of Police all violations
of the same.
6. In all public work home labor shall
be employed and the productions of the
Btate shall In all cases be given the pref
erence. Eight hours shall be the limit for
a day's work.
7. We require that our nominees shall do
all In their power to secure the confirma
tion by the Legislature of the new charter
and when the charter becomes a law we
require the spirit and the provisions of
the same shall be carried out ' in good
faith.
8. Telephone service has become a neces
sity to our people and the privileges granted
by the city to the telephone companies have
been very liberal and are of great value.
We demand free service to the city and a
reduction In rates to our citizens.
9. Street railroad franchises have been
granted without regard to the convenience
of the public or the value of the franchise.
We require that all unused rails and tracks
shall be removed from the streets as well
as dangerous obstacles, such as the turn
table at Oeary and Kearny, at Post and
Montgomery and the curve at the toot of
Sacramento street.
10. The charge for gas and electric light
should be reduced and the quality improved
and the city, subject as it Is to foggy and.
dark nights, should have Its lamps lighted
every night in the year.
11. The acquisition by the city of publlo
utilities is very desirable and we favor such
acquisition whenever practical. Especially
do we recognize the importance of this city
owning its gas and electric lighting plant
and a system of water works. The rate
for hydrants should not exceed $2 60 each
per annum and 6 per cent dividend on tha
water company's stock should be nut Helen t,
and we pledge our nominees for Supervisors
to reduce rates to bring about this result.
12. We denounce the lamentable failure
and the transparent imbecility of our Su
pervisors In connection with the building
of the Hall of Justice and point this out
as a glaring example of the inefficiency
of the present city government, calling for
a remedy at the hands of the people.
13. Pure food Is essential to the health
of the people. We heartily commend the
efforts now being made to assure the purity
of food and to punish those who adulterate
or sell adulterated food.
14. The Public Pound as now conducted
is a disgrace to the city. We favor the con
trol of the Public Pound by the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, whose
management for four years was satisfactory
to the citizens and In the Interest of de-
cency.
15. The administration of municipal af
fairs during the past two years has been a
deplorable failure. We denounce the pledge
breakers of the Board of Supervisors and
the Board of Education, and condemn their
disregard of the sacred rights of the citi
zens who elected them to office.
In strong contrast to the action of the
above officials, we commend the able and
efficient administration of Mayor Phelan In
the fearless performance of his official duty
at all timeÃ, and also those members of the
Boards of Supervisors and of Education who
have labored faithfully to serve the peo
ple.
16. We are opposed to the further pur
chase of property or the construction of
buildings by the present clt- authorities,
and we require that all such projects be
postponed until after action Is taken by the
Incoming Legislature on the new city char
ter, which provides business methods for
such purposes.
17. We require that the expenses of the
County Clerk's office be kept within a limit
of $6000 per month, and we condemn the In
cumbent as a pledge-breaker for the ex
travagance displayed In that office during
the past two years.
18. Real estate and Improvements and In
dustrial entprprlses and the homes of the
people are now taxed at their full value,
whereas, the large quasi-public and other
corporations escape with an insignificant
valuation. The Supreme Court In the case
of the Ran Jose Gas Company vs. January,
has laid down the rule by which corporate
property may be assessed at approximately
Its market or real value. We therefore
pledge our nominees for Assessor, and for
the Board of Supervisors, when sitting aa a
Board of Equalization, to follow the de
cision aforesaid.
19. The Grand Jury system has often
proved to be a shield for crime. The same
men are reappolnted term after term. We
therefore pledge our nomlneess for the Su
perior Court to select proper material for
the Grand Jury, and In no case to ap
point a citizen who has served In that
capacity at any time during the last three
preceding years.
20. The office of District Attorney Is the
most lmnortnnt of all the offices In the
municipal government. He has power hy
filing an Information to hold for trial any
boss or officeholder who Is charged with
bribery and corruption, and he can also sup
press many evils which are a disgrace to
our city. With a fearless, independent Dis
trict Attorney in office we believe that
School Directors. Supervisors and other
officials would abstain from public rob
beries with which their names are coupled.
The heads of great corporations who deal
with them would refrain from tempting
the weak and easily corrupted. A new
era would dawn on the city of San Fran
cisco.
21. We earnestly entreat all citizens to
vote against tho Infamous constitutional
amendment known aR number one, being
Senate Amendment No. 41. This would
subject the city of San Francisco to claims
for street work of all kinds done in the past.
It might cause the bankruptcy of the city.
22. To carry out the provisions of the
charter In good faith we pledge our muni
cipal candidates not to contest the seats
of their successors who may be elected
under the charter In November. 1899. for the
reason that the terms for which they are
elected at the forthcoming election are
curtailed by the ratification of the charter
by the Legislature.
In conclusion, the Citizens' Non-Partisan
Convention, in the hope that municipal
affairs cf the city shall be thoroughly re
formed, nnd that Its citizens shall not be
made the mere servants of the unprinci
pled bosses of the great political parties
or grasping corporations, and in the belief
that honesty and integrity should be the
rule and not the exception among city
officials, asks the people of San Francisco
for its hearty and generous support.

WAITING FOR GALLAGHER.
The Mission and Potrero Club Anx
ious About a Franchise.
The Mission and Potrero-avenue Im
provement Club is just now anxously
awaiting to hear from City and County
Attorney Gallagher with reference to the
franchise of the Southern Pacific Rail
road, granting it the privilege of putting
down double tracks across the streets of
the city from the San Mateo County line
to the terminus of the coast division at
Third and Townsend streets. The club
has discovered that the railroad really
has no franchise to keep its present single
track down where it is. and has therefore
submitted the matter to the City Attor
ney for an opinion.
As the request has been In the latter's
possession for about six weeks it begins
to look as if the matter was to be put
over until after election.
If the opinion Is for the railroad it will
hurt Mfiguire. Gallagher's candidate, with
the people. If it is for the people it will
hurt Maguire with the railroad. In either
case it would be injurious to Mr. Maguire,
It is declared, by the club members.
If not answered by Monday a committee
will wait upon City and County Attorney
Gallagher.
CRIMINAL MALPRACTICE.
The Notorious Dora Fuhrig Arrested
for Killing Another Foolish
Woman,
Mrs. Anna Eggertsen, wife of Jacob
Eggertsen, a restaurant keeper at 507
Fourth street, died in the McNutt Hospi
tal yesterday morning, of blood poison-
Ing, brought about by a criminal opera
tion, performed, it is alleged, by Mrs.
Dora Fuhrlg, a midwife, residing at 1846
Howard street. The deceased was taken
several days ago to the McNutt Hospital.
Last Wednesday night she made an ante
mortem statement to Dr. Winslow Ander
son and Coroner Hawkins, accusing Mrs.
Fuhrlg of having performed a criminal
operation upon her. The Fuhrig woman
was placed under arrest. There is an
other similar charge against her for hav
ing caused the death of a woman in
J3iden two weeks aeo. j
VALLEY ROAD MAY
USE CHINA BASIN
HARBOR COMMISSIONERS SET
TLE THE DISPUTE.
The Basin Will Be the Place for
the Erection of Freight
Wharves.
The Board of Harbor Commissioners
has at last decided that it cannot with
hold from the Valley Railroad the use of
China Basin as a place for the erection of
freight wharves and buildings for the
handling: of the freight traffic of the road
when the connections are made with this
city. It was so decided at the meeting of
the Board of Harbor Commissioners yes
terday afternoon.
It will be remembered that when the
Valley Railroad began to build its road
from Stockton to Visalia the Legislature
was petitioned for the use of the China
Basin by the new company for freight
traffic purposes. The Legislature then em
powered the Harbor Commissioners to al
low or to refuse it as they saw fit. The
basin was then leased to the Valley Road
by the Harbor Commissioners, but subse
quently the board repudiated its action
and refused to accept the rental tendered
by the Valley Railroad. This dispute hung
fire for some time.

CANNED FRUITS AND SALMON.
The recent arrivals of California fruits have |
all been sold, and resales have been made of
many parcels, Rays the London Grocers' Ga
t*tte. It is generally thought high prices for I
Callfornlan fruits will increase the consump
tion of pines, nnd considering the low price
of these an active demand is expected. The
market for salmon has beer, in a very ani
mated and excited condition, owing to reports
that thp pack on the Fraser River, which has
Just been completed, will show a shortagp of
about 650,000 ca*es as compared with the quan
tity put up last year. Prices have been In
consequence advanced Is to Is 6d per case, and
at the close holders are firm, and the tendency
of prices Is upward, in fact packers have in
many cases cabled their agents not to sell for
forward delivery.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NTTW YORK, Bept. Bâ St. Paul made the
market this morning and broke this morning.
Trading â was not on a large scale during the
flay and all Interest centered In the meeting
of the St. Paul directors to act on the divi
dend. The rumor mongers fixed the dividend
rate on the common all the way from 2% to
Shi per cent. Those who paid that It would
be 2H found little credence and the continued
firmness of the stock In the /ace of the recent
heavy tone of the market and the confident
and heavy buying of the early hours of to-day
eeemed to Justify this Incredulity. There was
large buying of Pt. Paul here for London ac
oount and there was very active trading upon
the London curb after the close there, accord-
Ing to cahled reports. The price was rushed
up to 115 without any attention being
given to warning statements that very power
ful Interests In the directorate were opposed
to anything more than the 2Â»* per cent rate.
The eager bolls pointed thai the recent In
crease In the Burlington dividend was kept
â¢nMirouded In the same mystery up to the
moment of Its declaration, when the stock led
a violent upward movement. The showing of
the company for the last fiscal year was cited
â¢s confirming the confidence in an increased
dividend disbursement, the earnings applica
ble to the common stock having amounted to
8 3-10 per cent after extraordinarily heavy ex
penditures for Improvements charged to oper
ating expenses. When the announcement came
about 2:30 p. m., that the directors had made
the second annual dividend only 2VÂ» per cent,
the price dropped without a check, except for
momentary pause at each even number, to
110^4, which was 4*i per cent below the best.
Numerous blocks of many thousand shares
were thrown on the market with precipitate
eagernesÃ and the market speedily took on
panicky conditions. Rock Island foil In sym
pathy 3 points, Burlington 2 points, People's
Gas 24 and Northern Pacific preferred 2%.
The demoralization caused by the break in St.
Paul came on a market showing considerable
Strength and at a level materially above yes
terday's close. The rate for call money, after
folng to 4 per cent, eased off to 3 per cent un
er the influences of the engagements of |400 -
000 gold for Imports.
Bonds wore dull and firm most of the day
but yielded In the later dealings. Total sales,
12.900.0 W. United States old 4s, registered, the
8b and the 3f, when Issued, advanced Vi per cent
in the bid price.
Total sales of stocks to-day were 556.500
shares, Including 6SCO Atchison preferred: 31750

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Sept. B.â The Evening Port's
London financial cablegram says: The mar
kets opened here flat to-day. Consols and
most other stocks were offered, but the fall
was most marked In Americans, which were
freely sold on the decline In New York ex
; change and on the belief that dearer money
!Is at hand In New York. The decline, how
! ever, was short-lived and the general smart
â  recovery whlrh has taken place all around
confirms yesterday's cabled statement aa to
the strong undertone of the markets.
The recovery in Americans was accompanied
by rumors that St. Paul will declare a $2 SO
dividend and asl bonus. Mainly on this report
and on the big arbitrage house picking up
i Etock prices closed firm.
A sharp drop In Portuguese securities on
| the Delagoa Bay report which Is still believed
in many quarters, and the upward movement in
Kaffirs were again features.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
1 CHICAGO, Sept. S.â Heavy Northwestern re
| celpts of wheat, a knowledge of which was in
i possession of the traders before the session
opened, went a long way toward neutralizing
the firmness with which wheat started at Liv
i erpool. The recent heavy and quite steady dÂ»
! cllne and the comparatively low price to which
i wheat had already sunk, however, apparently
made friends for the grain and restrained the
ardor of the bears. Liverpool, notwithstanding
I a decline here, was Hd higher for September
! and Vn<l lower for December. Receipts con
; cernlng the Russian wheat crop were quite
bullish from a market point of view, as dlÂ«-
I appointing harvests were the general tenor.
! So far this season the movement of new wheat
! in Russia has been small enough to give what
I appears to be corroboratlon of the poor crop
1 reports from that country. Wheat futures
i were additionally strengthened near the close
! by a dispatch from New York to the effect
that Russian grain exporters who had soid
i wheat fro shipment In September to the United
â  Kingdom were trying to have the contracts
j canceled, presumably because of difficulty in
j getting the grain. The close was %<&%, c higher
for September and %<gHc for December.
Speculators In corn were for the most part
i bearish on account of the lliitlessness of the
â¢ shipping demand. Prices were steadied some
what by the strength of wheat and predictions
!of frost in lowa to-night. The market ruled
! heavy, however, closing with a loss of Ho for
I December.
Oats followed wheat. There was a fair
amount of business transacted within a very
narrow range. May closed %c advance. â¢
Provisions ruled 6trong on the healthy legi
timate basis of an excellent demand for the
cash article. Pork advanced 20c, lard 17% c
and ribs 15c.

Jacob Wollner's circular says: "The Wool
market Is still a puzzle, both here and in the
East. There are over fifteen million pounds of
Wool In this market, with none selling and
without Inquiry. Some little fall Wool is com
ing in, but it Is rather short In staple. It
really does not make much difference how
cheap Wool is offered, as there are no buyers,
and as there is very little woolen goods sell
ing manufacturers cannot get any orders.
They do not come Into the market to buy.
â¢'Something can be gleaned of the state of
the market in the East by the following stn
tlptics: The p.iles of last week in Boston
amounted to 1,700.000 pounds, against 11,700,
700 pounds for the corresponding week last
year. Snles since January 1 In Boston amounted
to 78.715.000 pounds, against 250,230,000 pounds
last year at this time.
"All the markets in the United States have a
large stock of Wool and there is a good deal
still In the hands of the growers. Still thÂ«
prices are well maintained, as when anybody
needs Wool and come into the market he Is
wllllnfr to pay full prices for what he wants,
but cannot be induced to buy more by getting
concessions."

COFFEEâ The circular of C. E. Blckford
gives tho receipts at this port thus far this
year at 124,544 bage, against 128,340 during the
same time in 1897. The sales from first hands
were 91.581 bags, against 57.16 G. The stock
on hand September 1 was 31.458 bags, against
35,913 on the same date last year. The world's
visible supply September 1 was 6,399,422 bags,
against 5,419, 061. The circular says:
"Our last circular was dated August 6. Dur
ing the intervening period the movement In
this article was of moderate proportions. The
market has been altogether devoid of features
worthy of particular mention and generally
dull. Coffees below 6c, however, prove an ex
ception to the prevailing conditions and are In
request at steady to fair pVlces both for domes
tic use and shipment to nearby overland mar
kets. Other descriptions have undergone but
slight alterations, mostly applicable to the
higher priced grades.
"Present Brazilian crop receipts (July 1, 1898,
to September 6, 1898) are 737,000 bags less than
during the same period last year. As a counter
fact the world's visible supply is steadily swell-
Ing, the Increase for August being 699,000 bags,
as against 922,000 In August, 1897.

THE REVOLUTIONARY TORIES.
If George 111 and his Ministers were
embarrassed by oposition at home, the
American patriots were no less embar
rassed. An energetic minority, it has
been said, brought to pass the Revolu
tion, which proceeding, especially from
New England, was carried through in
spite of a majority in the coloniesâ a ma
jority in great part quite apathetic but
to some extent actively resisting. The
emigration of Tories, when the day was
at last won, was relatively as great as
that of the Huguenots from Prance after
the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.
The total number is estimated to have
been at least 100,000. In this multitude
were comprised only such, with their
families, as had been active for the King.
The indifferent, who had lent no helping
hand to the patriots, must have been a
multitude much larger; these remained
behind, inertly submitting to the new
order of things as they had swayed in
ertly this way or that, following the
power and direction of the blast of war.

HE WAS TOO FOND
OF WIVES
Charles Albrecht Is in
Great Demand.
FIGURES IN A DIVORCE
LEFT HIS FIRST WIFE BY JUMP
ING A TRAIN.
Now It Is Alleged He Has Married
a Wealthy Girl at Santa
Rosa and Is in
Jail.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 8.
Two weeks ago Rosie Albrecht tiled a
suit for divorce from Charles Alfred Al
brecht in this county, and suit Is still
pending, as no one lias yet been able to
serve the summons on Albrecht. He was
married to Miss Mamie Boagard in De
cember of last year, and she is the lady
â¢who Is now desirous of being free.
This morning Attorney Leonard C.ark,
who Is Mrs. Albrecht'.s attorney, read a
dispatch from Santa Rosa, stating that
Charles Albrecht and Miss May Mar
shall, daughter of a well-known Sonoma
farmer, were married a few days ago,
and after their honeymoon returned to
Marshall's ranch. On their arrival Al
brecht was arrested on a charge of hav
ing obtained money through an alleged
fraudulent check.
Attorney Clark called on Chief of Po
lice Fletcher to-day and declared that
Albrecht Is a bigamist, and asked the
Chief to communicate with the Sheriff
of Sonoma County and have him detuin
cd on a charge of bigamy, with the privi
lege extended to Mr. Marshall to prose
cute if he felt so disposed.
A'brecht evidently has a system of In
ducing girls to marry- him. The published
etory from Santa Rosa compared very
favorably with the story Attorney Clark
says Albrecht told Miss Boagard when
proposing marriage to her last winter,
lie represented that he was wealthy, and
â took her to San Francisco, where he
â spent a few hundred dollars for a seal
6Â»cln sack and a diamond ring. In spite
of these evidences of his wealth Miss
Boapard told her parents that she feared
all was not right. To allay her trepida
tion he showed her an alleged forged tel
egram dated at San Matoo, telling of
his appointment to a lucrative position
4as an architect. lie induced her to ac
â  fompany him to San Mateo.
This was on December 20, and two
dayÃ Liter the young wife's sister took
h.r away to her home. The husband fol
lowed, and when the sister threatened
him with arrest he jumped from the
.â¢.train aching San Francisco, and
Attorney Clark h<-ard no more of him till
he read of his experience in Santa Rosa.
Albrecht Fails to Explain.
SANTA ROSA. Sept. g.â The plot cer
tainly spems to be thickening around
Chartes Albr^cht, the San Francisco ar
i bltect whose honeymoon was so rudely
tr.am-d by the strong arm of the law here
riiÃtrt, and who In consequence now
occupies a cell in the County Jail.
.On Tuesday Albreoht was married to
May .Marshall, the pretty daughter
V. Marshall, a Weil-to-do farmer re
ptdln* n short distance from town. On
Wednesday evening he was arrested and
charged with Issuing a fraudulent check
upon the First National Bank of San
Francisco in payment for goods that were
j purchased for the brides trousseau.
Lost night when seen in his cell Al
| brecht claimed his arrest was the result
of a mislake upon the part of the officials
.and as soon as the morning came he
would be able to communicate with San
Francis.o hy telephone and explain
everything satisfactorily. When morn
ing rani';, however, he failed to make good
his promises, and when questioned by the
ofHcr-rs told many conflicting tales as to
his actions and whereabouts during the
past few years.
This afternoon the hief of Police of
Oakland wired the Sheriff's office in this
city that Alhrecht was wanted .there, if
he was the man the Alameda County offi
cials 'believed him to be. for bigamy, hav
ing married Miss Mamie M. Boagard,
whose parents reside at 747 Market street,

PLOTTED TO
BE DIVORCED
After the False Teeth of
His Rival.
WANTED A WATCH CHARM
LEWIS WAS DISARMED TO
AVOID A MURDER.
He Found His Wife With Another
Man and Was Led to the
Couple by His
Sister.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 8.
This afternoon Attorney Tom Bradley
obtained from the Sheriff a pistol which
but for the timely work of a Deputy
Sheriff would have caused a tragedy at
the Chateau at Piedmont. The circum
stances connected with this pistol point to
a very clever plot by which a sister at
tempted to aid her brother In securing
a divorce from a wife who was not des
perately fond of him.
T. J. Lewis is the man who owns the
gun, and just what steps he will take
through his attorney, whether civil or
criminal, is not yet known. A few days
ago Lewis was in Colfax, when he re
ceived a letter from his sister telling him
that his wife was making appoint
ments with A. E. Harris, a local sales
man. Lewis, anxious for something
upon which to seek a separation, quick
ly returned to Oakland, and was inform
ed by his sister that Harris, Mrs. Lewis,
a man named David and Lewis' sister had
gone to the Chateau in Pleasant Valley.
Lewis at once loaded his pistol and went
to the Chateau with another man to get
his wife. He told Officer Hitchcock that
his desire was to secure a divorce, and
told him he preferred to use a club instead
of a pistol. The officer not only declined
to loan him his club, but took away the
gun. A few minutes later Lewis again
met the officer, told him that his wife
was not at the Chufau, and asked him to
return the gun. Hitchcock did so, and
Lewis returned toward the Chateau, at
the same time reloading his gun, which
Hitchcock had emptied. Seeing- this, he
was again disarmed, and he then ran to
the house and found his wife and Harris
in a dining room. The men grappled with
each other, and in the tight Miss Lewis
struck her brother over the head with a
bottle, but immediately saw her mistake,
and explained to him that she meant It
for Harris. After a while Harris broke
away, with the aid of the officer and the
restaurant keeper.
Lewis then told the crowd that he did
not intend to kill Harris, but he intended
to force him to his knees and make him
take out his false teeth, which Lewis de
clared he was going to hang on his watch
chain as a memento of the evening's
sport.
Lewis' sister and Mr. Randberger, who
had accompanied Lewis to the Chateau,
then started away, and a few minutes
later were calling for help, boih of them
having fallen into a sewer ditch six feet
deep. Lewis was around town to-day
looking for Harris, but the latter had
disappeared. Officer Hitchcock turned
the gun over to the Sheriff, and this af
ternoon it was delivered to Attorney
Bradley for his client..
THE JONES DIVORCE
HAS BEEN GRANTED
SEQUEL OF A SENSATIONAL
SERIES OF SCANDALS.
Continuation of the Disbarment Pro
ceedings in Which Hutchinson
Is Charged With Ut
tering Libel.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. S.
Judge Ogden to-day granted a divorce
to Gertrude Jones from Ernest Norwood
Jones on the ground of infidelity, at the
same time awarding plaintiff custody of
the two minor children, all of the prop
erty and $50 per month alimony for the
support of herself and children. The
defendant is permitted to visit the chil
dren at such times as may be convenient
to plaintiff. The parties were married in
San Francisco April 3. 1894.
Indirectly the case has some connection
with the disbarment proceedings brought
by Attorneys Henry N. Beatty and
George H. Francoeur against Attorney
Joseph Hutchinson, which was resumed
in Judge Hall's court this morning, Hut
chinson having acted a-s Mrs. Jones' at
torney in the suit of Francoeur against
Mrs. Jones for the recovery of $500 on a
promissory note given In payment as at
torney's fees.
The petitioners for Hutchinson's dis
barment allege that the latter in the
answer to the suit on the note made
statements which he knew to oe scan
dalous and libelous regarding them.
Henry Beatty was on the stand to-day,
and his testimony in the main was a de
nial of the charges made by Hutchinson
as attorney for Mrs. Jones in the suit
brought by Francoeur to recover attor
ney's fees for the defense of Jack How
ard when the last mentioned was under
charge of murder in the celebrated Annie
Johnson case, in connection with which
case E. N. Jones' name had been mention
ed. Beatty admitted that he had paid
Harvard $10 per week for several months
on behalf of Jones, and that after the
murder trial Francoeur had paid Jack
Howard and Hulda Johnson $75 as a pres
ent. It was shown that lteatty and
Francoeur had been retained to defend
Hulda Johnson and Jack Howard, evi
dently at the solicitation of Jones.
Witness Hfatty asserted that he had
never toTd Jones that money would be re
quired in order to keep the papers from
publishing the details of the Johnson
murder, and he had never represented to
Mrs. Jones that there was any fear of her
husband'a arrest at any time. Hutchin
son had told Mrs. Jones this. Witness
denied that Mrs. Jones over asked him
for money, but said that Jones told him
that Mrs. Johnson was after money.
Beatty was asked how much money he
received Jn the defense of the case, and
he replied $1191, of which he retained $^s<i,
the rest being paid over to other claim
ants. Witness had not heard from Jones
for a long time, but had read in to-day's
papers of his arrest in the East on a
felony charge.
Mrs. Jones was also on the stand to
day testifying that her husband was out of
thi's State since last February; that she
was In the hospital last May. when the
answer In the Francoeur suit was brought
to her for her signature.
The petitioners claim to be able to
prove that Mrs. Jones was never consult
ed regarding a defense to the note suit
until after answer was served on her;
that she never appeared before a notary
and acknowledged to the scandalous al
legations in the answer.
Further hearing in the motion went
over until Tuesday morning at 10 o'clock.
The Thayer Inquest.
HERKELEY, Sept. B.â The inquest held
last night over the remains of the lato
William Parker Thayer. who shot himself
Tuesday, returned a verdict of Buicide.
The jury's finding was not, however,
unanimous. Dr. John G. Jessup held the
opinion that "death was caused by a
gunshot wound, accidentally inflicted,"
and brought in a minority report to that
effect. The verdict was signed by seven
jurors.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1898.
BOYS PLAY
WITH FIRE
Piedmont Springs in
Grave Danger.
MAKE FULL CONFESSION
STRUCTURES ARE SAVED BY
MUCH HABD WORK.
President Havens Appealed To on
Behalf of the Tibbitts Boys,
Who Fired the
Underwood -
Oakland Office Son Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 8.
Two little boys named Tibbltts are
anxiously waiting for the return of Presi
dent Havens of the Piedmont Springs
property. When Ar. Havens returns he
may decide to prosecute the lade for
starting three fires on the property sim
ultaneously and exposing valuable build
ings to great risk merely for fun.
The boys have signed a complete state
ment of the Incidents connected with the
fires at Piedmont Springs, which wore
only put out after a hard battle waged by
a gang of men. The little fellows were
coming from school, and after taking a
bath in the reservoir they decided to
light a fire for amusement. When they
had lit one and it had got a good headway
they left it and started another among
the deep dry undergrowth surrounding
the building. This pleased them so much
that they started still another, and when
the flames almost met they became
frightened and tried to put them out.
The dense smoke attracted the attention
of a special officer, and as it was seen
that the buildings were in danger he tele
phoned to headquarters and was told to
organize a band of men at once and put
the tires out.
It required the services of half a dozen
men for some hours to prevent an ex
pensive conflagration as a result of the
boys' mischief. An investigation was
made, and the little culprits, who ran off
as soon as they saw the danger, were
easily found. They have since written out
a full account of the affair for President
Havens, and their parents have entered a
plea for mercy, which will probably be
granted.
EL NIDO CLUB SUITS.
All the Members Who Were in Good
Standing Are Sued for the
Club's Indebtadness.
ALAMEDA, Sept. B.â The last chapter
in the history of the unfortunate El Nido
Club was opened to-day, when I. P. Allen,
assignee of the club, which is insolvent,
filed suits In Justice Morris' court against
all the members who were in good stand
ing at the time the organization went into
insolvency, for the purpose of collecting
the sum of 1965 76. or $15 09 from each In
dividual. Sepacate suits were filed
against each member. The complaints al
lege that on or about August 3, 1898, the
said El Nido Club was declared insolvent
In the Superior Court of this county and
I. P. Allen was appointed assignee of the
estate thereof. That the club Is indebted
to divers and sundry creditors In the sum
of ${*>5 70. and each member is sued for his
pro rata of that ambunt.
El Nido Club had a flourishing existence
far a brief period. It included many of
the prominent business men of the city,
but finally some of the members ran up
bills which they did not pay, chiefly for
liquid refreshments, and when the club
was called on for settlement It had no
money in the treasury.
. particularly aggravating feature of
the affair is that most of the men who
have been sued are of the number who
paid their bills and dues regularly and
are substantial business men, while those
who ate and drank on credit were dropped
from membership and their associates are
now called upon to pay for their refresh
ments.

ALAMEDA. Sept. S.â At the meeting of
the Board of Trustees last evening one
of the hose companies presented a re
quest for a gift of half a dozen fire hats

The Dean Forgery.
OAKLAND. Sept. B.â The Grand Jury
resumed its session this afternoon, con
tinuing its inquiry into the alleged regis
tration frauds done in the County Clerk's
office during the recent Congressional
primaries. Expert E. J. Dunshee was one
of the principal witnesses before the jury
this afternoon and testified that the Dean
signature was an absolute forgery.
The Grand Jury had been advised that
in the absence of any primary law there
was grave doubt whether there could be
any crime and that the investigation could
hardly result in the return of an indict
ment. The matter Is therefore understood
to be dropped.
Supplemental Complaint.
OAKLAND, Sept. B.â Josephine A. Elly
has filed a supplemental complaint in her
divorce suit against John R. Elly, alleg
ing desertion dating from June 5, 1887, and

altogether unknown in this vicinity, but
their affable manners charmed away all
suspicion. They found ready sales
throughout the town. But one or two
of the dealers on weighing their goods
found them to be several pounds under
weight. It was then discovered that ev
ery grocer who had purchased of the
strangers had been swindled. The bills
made out for each -sale all bear the head
ing: "Marshfield Cheese Factory, Manu
facturers of Martin's New York Cheese.
Factory, Marshfleld, Oregon." The police
have been notified, and they are now
looking for the offenders.

si's daughter, in Justice Kerrigan's court
yesterday to recover $150 which he had
given to the young couple in order to fa
cilitate their wedding several years ago.

from Barabino, whereupon Rossi was
wroth and determined to recover the wed
ding dowry In the courts.
Barabino testified that the father of the
bride had offered him $1000 to marry his
daughter, but had only paid $150. This
the father denied. The Justice continued

whether a cash bridal present can be- re

Meeting-.
BIG CROWDS AT THE TRACK
PIGGOTT THE STAB HORSE PILOT
AT SACRAMENTO.
Bides Four Winners and a Third
Horse in the Five Race*
Where He Haw
Mounts.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. B.â The racing
steadily improves as the meeting wears
on, and the same can also be said of
the attendance. The latter was placed
at 4000 to-day. The balance was on
the right side of the ledger of the pub
lic, for four favorites and two well
played second choices got home In
front. Especially heavy was the bet
ting on Harry Thoburn in the last
event, and this time he did not disap
point his admirers, though Moringa was
the best horse in the race. It is a fact
worth knowing that the winners, Jen-
nie Reid and Scarborough, are brother
and sister. Piggott rode four winners
and a third horse in the five races
where he had mounts, and is easily the
star horse pilot here. Bullman ap
pears to be a comer.
Midlove was made a slight favorite
over Jennie Reid for the Shafter sell-
Ing stake, six furlongs, for which five
lined up against the rubber. To a good
Btart, Jennie Reid going best, led the
band for over a furlong, then Midlove
headed her and led past the half. The
Miller now ran up very fast and led by
the saddle skirts into the homestretch.
Jennie Reid, under vigorous riding, got
up to the leaders less than half-way
down the straight and won easily by
two lengths; Casdale second as far be
fore Nilgar, who had made up a vast
amount of territory in the last three
furlongs. Midlove, the favorite, wound
up absolutely last. Time, 1:16&.
A mile selling race came next, and
It had four starters and Shasta Water
for a 4 to 5 favorite. Cromwell was at
6 to 5, Joe Terry 6 to 1 and Kruna 8 to
I (played from 12). Kruna, a good
looking bay mare, led for about a fur
long, then Shasta Water sailed away
to the fore, leading to the home stretch
by from half a length to a length,
Cromwell second most of the way. Un
der Piggott's vigorous riding Cromwell
beaded the Burns & Waterhouse mare
half way down the straight and won
cleverly by two lengths, Shasta Water
eecond, six lengths from Joe Terry, who
made up some ground from the half to
the stretch. Time, 1:42.
San Mateo was a 1 to 4 shot in the
third race, six and a half furlongs, sell
ing. Major Cook was second In demand
at 6 to 1, the others 10 to 20 to 1. Off to
a fair start. Major Cook took the lead
and held it past the quarter by saddle
skirts, at the half by his head; then
the slow-to^get-moving San Mateo said
"Ta-ta, Major," and leading into the
homestretch by four lengths won in a
canter, eased up, by two and a half
lengths, Major Cook a handy second,
two lengths before Lady Britannic, the
other two back a short block. Time,
1:22 Mi.
The fourth race, five furlongs for
maiden two-year-olds, brought six to
the rubber band. Almoneer and Fa
versham were at 8 to 5 each, Cleodora
B to 1, Napian and Crossmolina 5 to 1,
Alcatraz 6, latter two played rather
Btrongly. The start was poor. Alcatraz
and Cleodora might as well have been

to win. Moringa was best but had to work through the
ige better. Fig Leaf had iomÂ« speed. The rest never prom-
munching hay in the barn. ' Faver
sham was away in front, but Almoneer
and Napian passed him when they had
gone about a furlong. Napian and Al
moneer were heads apart passing the
half and turning for home. In the
homestretch Shields outrode Snider and
landed Almoneer a winner in a mild
drive by a neck, Napian second, three
lengths before the counterfeit, Faver
sham, Crossmolina a poor fourth. Time,
1:03^.
In the fifth, one mile, Scarborough
was a 7 to 10 favorite, with Libertine
second choice. Lost Girl was heavily
played for the place. To a fair start
Libertine got to the front when they
had gone about a furlong, and had an
advantage of a length and a half at
the quarter. Then Scarborough and
Manzanilla -closed up on the big horse.
The latter was badly cut off by Liber
tine when three furlongs from home.
Scarborough had a length the best of
Libertine when they made the final
turn and won handily by two lengths,
Libertine second one length before
Lost Girl, who made up considerable
ground. Time, 1:43*4.
The sixth race, six furlongs, selling,
had Harry Thoburn for a hot favorite,
he being backed down from 2^ to 1 to
4 to 5. Moringa was at 3 to 1, Venis 15
to 5, P. A. Finnegan 16 to 5, others 8
and 10 to 1. To an excellent start Harry
Thoburn went into the lead and made
every post a winning one, passing the
finishing line half a length in front
of Moringa, who was fast catching him,

by Fig Leaf. Time, 1:15^4.

are out to win. "Heney" Krug and Louie
Balsz will be in the box for their respective

Bogus Advertising Contract.
L. C. Ewell, an advertising agent at 43
S'.xth street, swore to a complaint in
Judge Joachimsen's court yesterday for
the arrest of Steve Vulfcevich on a charge
Of petty larceny by trick and device, but
a more serious charge may be preferred
against him. He went to San Jose a few
days ago and returned to Kwcll with a
contract purporting to be signed by Jlin
Rea for $150 for advertising in connection
with the campaign. The contract waj in
dorsed with an order upon Colonrl Dan
Burns for the money, but Burns rofuse-1
to recognize the order. Meantime Ewell
had advanced Vulicevich $10 upon the
contract, believing it to be genuine. It
now depends upon Ttea if a charge of for
gery will bo made against Vulicevlca.

MRS. ROTHKUFF SAW MYSTERIOUS
WOMAN AT THE FERRY POSTAL STATION
FEMESSEFS
STRANGE STORY
â¢ CORROBORATED
Sylvia Heney Says She
Sold the Candy.
SHE IDENTIFIES THE BOX
NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE
DUNNING TRAGEDY."
Legal Complications That May Pre
vent Mrs. Botkin From Re
ceiving a Fair
Trial.
Another rpmr.rk.ible coincidence that
may assume Importance for the defenders
of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin h:is forced itself
out of the labyrinth of facts and fancies
In which the whole mysterious affair '8
clouded. Another woman has appeared
with information that Is certainly Inter
esting and may be of moment in the case.
Her contribution to the confusion of
theories is in corroboration of the asser
tion of J. IE. Fennessee that he saw a
woman resembling Mrs. Botkin post a
package shortly before 6 o'clock on the
afternoon of August 4 at the ferry postal
station.
This new witness is Mrs. Lena Roth
kuff. She does not know Mrs. Botkin,
and is not sure that h>-r testimony is of
any value. She simply describes what
Bhe saw and feels that, while she wishes
to avoid notoriety, her experience was
somewhat remarkable in conjunction with
other circumstances in the web of testi
mony. She also saw a woman post a
package at the ferry postal station a few
minutes before 6 o'clock on the afternoon
of August 4. The package. Mrs. Roth
kuff says, resembled the wrapped box of
poisoned candy. The woman who posted
It was very like the description published
of Mrs. Botkin. The Incident Is signifi
cant, as Mrs. Botkin can prove that she
was well on her way to St. Helena at the
time her double appeared at the ferry de
pot in this city.
Mrs. Lena Rothkuff Is a resident of
Sacramento. She was in this city on
August 4 on business connected with the
preparations for the Irish Fair. Having
< oncluded her mission Mrs. Rothkuif
started for the ferry to return to her
home. She intended to take the 6 o'cloc*
boat from this city, but lound, upon her
arrival at the ferry depot, that she was
mare than an hour too early.
Having nothing else to do she bupled
herself in watching the faces and follow
ing the movements of the hurrying crowds
of men and women who came ajid went
to and fro in the ferry building. While
occupied with this diversion Mrs. Roth
kuff says sho noticed particularly the ac
tions of .a woman that approached the
package window of the postal station,
then went away and again returned. The
â¢watcher's attention was specially at
tracted by the incidents as one or two
scenes at the ferry postoffice had already
interested her. A girl had entered hur
riedly with a letter in hor hand. She
kissed the epistle and then dropped it
into the mail. Mrs. Rothkuff watched to
see what the next visitor would do.
A short woman, not unlike Mrs. Bot
kin. entered the urea in front of the post
office. She carried a wrapped box that
In size arid shape resembled a box of
candy such ;;s dealers sell for 50 cents.
It was shortly before 6 o'clock and there
wore two or three men In front of the
postoffice. Mrs. Rr.thkuff says she did
not notice them particularly, and as far
as she knows one of them may have been
J. K. Fennessee. Her attention was fixed
upon the woman who had approached the
package window of the postoffice. The
Btranger hesitated a moment when she
reached the window. She made a mo
tton as If to retire for a few steps and
then returned to drop the package In the
mail.
A few minutes later Mrs. Rothkuff was
on her way to Sacramento. She thought
no more of the Incident at the ferry pos
tal station and dismissed it from her mind
as an incident in an idle diversion. When
the statement of J. E. Fennessee was pub
lished, however, Mrs. Rothkuff recalled
her experience. She told it to her frierds,
but look no steps to communicate with the
authorities. She can give no more par
ticular description of the strange woman
than that already indicated. The woman
with the package may have worr> glasses
as far as Mrs. Rothkuff knows, as the
watcher at the ferry did not look critically
at her face.
The facts that Mrs. Rothkuff has Intro
duced Into thr case nre of great impor
tance to tho defense In any plan to estab
lish for Mrs. Botkin an alibi. If it can be
shown that another woman, resembling
the accused, rruiiled a package In any way
like the box of poisoned candy a serious
doubt will be interjected to interfere with
the case of the prosecution. When Fen
nessee mad" his statement no greater Im
portance than that of a coincidence was
attached to it. Both the prosecution and
the defense saw its meaning, which Is now
greatly enhanced by the recital of Mrs.
Rotbkuff.
Mrs. Rothkuff was in the city yesterday
afternoon, but returned at night to ht?r
home in Sacramento. In an interview yes
terday she described the incident as al
ready outlined. The defense will undoubt
edly use her as a witness when the case
of Airs. Botkin is presented.
The police have given up all hope of
tracing the postage stamps on the box of
poisoned candy to their purchaser. It is
Impossible to locate so small a purchase,
and the endeavor will be given up as
hopeless. The inquiry before the local
Grand Jury has also ended. The police
authorities of this city do not wish to
injure their own plan of sending Mrs.
Botkin out of the State. If the inquiry
before the Grand Jury were to proceed
an Indictment might be the result, and
the prosecution would find itself in a
peculiar predicament. It was out of the
question for the police to use the offi
cial Inquisitors simply as agents to ob
tain testimony that could not be secured
in any other way. Little has been left

Mrs. Lena Rothknff, Who Introduces a New Mystery
in the Dunning Tragedy.
therefore except to put In legal form the
evidence that- has already been gathered.
This will be done as a preparation for the
extradition hearing before Governor
Budd. This proceeding has been set for
next Tuesday morning, and will be held
at the Palace Hotel.
Another saleswoman, employed by
George Haas, made a statement yester
day to the police. She Is Miss Sylvia
Heney, vA\o works as an "extra" clerk
and on occasions at night. The authori
ties are now convinced that it was she
and not Miss Kmma Herber who sold
the box of candy that was subsequently
poisoned. Both Miss Herber and Miss
Heney sold boxes of candy answering the
description of that which plays so prom
inent a part in the Dover tragedy. Miss
Herber told her story to the police, and
attempted, without success, to identify
Mrs. Botkin as the purchaser of the box.
After this failure Miss Heney was
brought forward. The young lady was
summoned to police headquarters last
night and made a complete statement.
She says that on the afternoon of July 31
she sold the box of candy which was sent
to Delaware. Her recital of the Incident
of the sale and the actions of the pur
chaser Is identical with that made by
Ml.sb Herber and already published in The
Call. Miss Heney can go further than
Miss Herber, however, as she explains
why she identifies the box.
The woman who made the purchase had
asked for a special box. With a desire
to sell a faded box and please her em
ployer Miss Heney chose that which she
Identified yesterday. An attempt was
then made to have the girl Identify Mrs.
Botkin. The young lady was taken to the
window of the matron's room, but Mrs.
Botkin retired from view. Another effort
will be made at the earliest possible mo-
imnt.
The police have also received the report
of T. Kytka, the handwriting expert who
is employed by the Police Department.
The expert solemnly announces that Mrs.
Botkln undoubtedly wrote the anonymous
letters to Mrs. Dunning and also the ad
dress on the box of poisoned candy. This
decision, coming from an employe of the
Police Department, was not unexpected.
An interesting legal question has arisen
in the case of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin which
will probably puzzle not only the lawyers
engaged on both sides but also Chief Lees,
who claims to be the leading counsel for
the State.
The constitutions of the State of Califor
nia and Delaware, as well as the constitu
tion' of the United States, provide that in
criminal prosecutions the accused shall be
confronted with the witnesses against him
or her In open court. The principle enun
ciated Is as old as the Magna Charta, It
was formulated for the purpose of pro
tecting persons accused of crime against
secret trials and the conspiracies of those
in power, who, in monarchical govern
ments, arbitrarily made way with their
political enemies.
In the Botkin case the question Is now
asked: How can the alleged poisoner be
confronted with the witnesses against her
if ehe is taken to Delaware, or how can
the same privilege be extended to*her if
she is tried here? There Is no process by
which the California witnesses can be
compelled to attend court In Delaware,
and there Is no process by which those In
that State can be brought here.
The constitutions of both States, as well
as the Federal organic law, guarantee
Mrs. Botkin the same privilege employed
by the prosecution. That is, she is en
titled to have witnesses in her defense
brought into court. If it should appear
that a person In Delaware refused to at
tend when subpenaed In her behalf she
could not constitutionally be convicted,
and if she were extradited on Governor
Budd'a warrant and her California wit
nesses should refuse to go to Delaware,
she could not be convicted there.
"The fact of this matter Is," said an'at
torney who has studied the rase, " Mrs.
Botkin's situation is an anomaly in the
law. Even If she were a fugitive from
Justice and could be extradited under the
Federal statute, none of the California
witnesses could be taken to Delaware
against her will. The common law pro
vided that when a crime was committed
partly in one and partly in another juris
diction it might be tried In either, but it
was always assumed that tne trial would
take place where the witnesses were lo
cated.
"If Mrs. Botkin actually was a fugitive
from Justice from Delaware the witnesses
for and against her would probably be
In the latter State; but as she Is not in
the legal sense a fugitive â never having
been lji Delaware â it happens that both
the witnesses for and against her are
mostly here.
"1 have no Idea how the prosecution in
the Bctkln case will get over this diffi
culty. Dunning is one of the important
wltnepses for the State. It will probably
be difficult to make out a case afrainst
her without his evidence. Suppose he
should refuse to come to California in
case she is tried here,*or go to Delaware
In case ehe Is extradited. I know of no
way . in which he could be compelled to
attend either jurisdiction."
The point here involved is Booner or
later bound to puzzle the lawyers on both
Bides. IndÂ«*d, it may cut an important
figure In thg argument before Governor
Budd on Tuesday next.
SUMMING UP THE
EVIDENCE OBTAINED
Chief Lees Preparing for the Battle
for Extradition Before Gov
ernor Budd.
Chief Lees is still seeking to attach Mrs.
Botkin to the mass of facts and surmise
that he has gathered to place before Gov
ernor Budd on Tuesday next.
The arsenic feature of the case is con
sidered closed by the prosecution in so far
that Mrs. Botkin admits that she pur
chased arsenic of the Owl Drug Company
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1898.
on June 1. But with the balance of the
prosecution's evidence the accused woman
remains unattached, and the past two
days have been largely spent in hearing
the numerous witnesses who were sup
posed to have been familiar with Mrs.
Miss Grace Allison, Who Posed as & Rich Widow, and H. C.
Franks, One of Her Love-Sick Victims,
Botkin's movements, particularly with
her shopping tours.
Of these A. B. Barnes, proprietor of
the Hotel Victoria, one time the abiding
place of Mrs. Botkin, was most reckoned
on for positive facts.
He was called Into the presence of Chief
Lees yesterday and subjected to a rigid
interrogation, but as It had not been nls
custom to record the doings of his guests
the Information that was had of him was
only of a general character.
Mrs. Botkin's remaining days in jnil
will be probably not so devoid of event
as have those of the two weeks past. The
procession of freaks who are morbidly at
tracted by great crimes and great crim
inals has begun, and the prisoner Is kept
busy declining to be exhibited. One party
oT six simpering young things were
taught a lesson yesterday that should be
of lasting benefit. Armed with a permit
from the Chief, thpy descended upon the
City Prison and insistently demanded that
the prisoner be dragged rorth. The pris
oner declined to be dragged, but the de
mands were not squelched until Turnkey
Shaw ordered them out of the prison.

V
A MATRIMONIAL AGENCY FAKE
ANSWERED AN ADVERTISE
MENT OF A "RICH WIDOW."
She Got Him on a String, Then
Worked Him for Costly Pres
ents â Now She Is
in Jail.
Men who seek a sharer of their joys
and Borrow^, through the medium of a
matrimonial agency as a rule come to
the conclusion that they are fools and
wish they had followed the good old
custom of winning: the affections of girls
Whose antecedents were known to them.
Bain's Matrimonial Agency in this city
has been the means of many heartaches
and worse, and now the female head of
the concern has been arrested at the In
stigation of a dupe who has the courage
to brave public ridicule.
About the beginning of January last
H. C. Franks, a wealthy miner in El
Paso, Tex., noticed an advertisement in
Bain's paper, "The Marriage Bell," that
a widow worth $250,000 wanted a husband;
money no object, but only he must be
congenial. He thought over the matter,
and being a bachelor he decided to write
to the address in the advertisement. In
a few days he received a reply from
Mrs. Grace Allison, who is the female
head of the bureau, that she was pleased
with his letter, and begging for further
particulars about Hfta and his anteced
ents. He did not like the tone of the
letter, but replied and received a reply
that he appeared to be the man she had
for years been looking for.
Franks found it necessary to go to New
York on business, and when he reached
Jamestown, N. V., he sent Mrs. Allison
a diamond engagement ring worth $110.
After he had finished his business in
New York he came to this city and met
Mrs. Allison, who was then living at 516
Jones street. He was delighted with her
and it was agreed that they should be
married this month. She showed Franks
a number of houses that she said belonged
to her, and he thought himself the lucki
est man on earth. He remained in the
city from February 3 to 13, when he left
for El Paso.
Before leaving she told Franks that she
would like to have some token of his love
and ho might send her some silk for
dresses and some of the valuabk- stones
that were to be found In Teas. He sent
her 128 yards of silk valued at $1 50 per
yard, and opals and other precious stones
altogether of the value of about $1000.
All this time they wore corresponding
in the most endearing terms, and Franks
longed for the day when he could call
the wealthy and fascinating widow his
own. He arrived here a few days ago
and called upon her to fix the day for the
wedding. She was cold in her manner
and urged him to return to El Paso as
she was afraid some bewitching young
maiden might fascinate him and he would
forget her. He reminded her that their
marriage waa to take place this month,
but she begged that the ceremony be
postponed a short time longer.
She had occasion to leave the room and
Franks" attenlion was attracted by a
pile of letters on top of a bureau. He
was curious and examined them and was
surprised to find that they were answers
to the "wealthy widow" advertisement.
He got suspicious and asked her what the
letters meant and she put him oft with
laughing reply. He went to Attorney
Humphrey and explained to him the cir
cumstances, and he called upon Mrs. Al
lison Wednesday evening. The attorney
demanded the return of the engagement
ring, the silk and the precious stones, but
Mrs. Allison advised him to tell Mr.
Franks to go to a warmer climate than
California.
Yesterday morning Franks reported the
rase at police headquarters and a de
tective wm sent to 516 Jones street to
bring Mrs. Allison to Chief Lees. She
;iad fled, but It waa ascertained later that
she had taken rooms in a house on Hyde
street, between Union and Pacific streets.
A warrant was sworn out for her arrest
on the charge of grand larceny by trick
and device before Judge Joachimsen, and
Sergeant Moffltt was detailed to arrest
her. He succeeded in doing so last night
and she was locked up in the City Prison.
"Do I look like a thief? Would any one
take me for a criminal?" exclaimed the
prisoner last night. "Why, I am a woman
of wealth and refinement. That man."
pointing to Desk Sergeant Brown, "has
taken nearly $4000 in diamonds from me.
It's an outrage that I am placed in this
vile place. 1 was walking to my home
when a man accosted me and asked me
whether I was Mrs. Allison. I answered
'How dare you address me' How dare
you speak to a lady?' With that he
grabbed me by the arm and says 'You
come with me.' Of course I could not
resist, and went with him.
"I had an Inkling that this man Franks
contemplated my arrest, but I did not
think he would go so far. Why, I can
prove that every present he gave me was
a gift, and how he can charge me with
theft is something I don't understand.
He has been sending me flowers since
his arrival In the city. He owes a florist
$18 for flowers sent me up to a few days
ago.
"That man Is angry at me because 1
did not loan him $10,000. A few days ago
he tried to borrow $7. r > from me, but I
refused him. He said he was erecting a
smelter, but I knew he was not, because
he had no money, and bad no business
ability to do it. Mr. Franks is lacking
In intelligence and refinement, and in fact
is not my social equal. I have hundreds
of letters from him in my room, showing
his affection for me. I never cared for
him and would never marry him, but if
a man forces his gifts on a woman she
cannot refuse to accept them.
"I made his acquaintance through the
marriage bureau. He was in Colorado,
but after we became acquainted he came
out here to marry me. As he did not
come up to my expectations, 1 put him
off."
SHOT IN THE BACK.
Manual Meads Shoots Fred Miller in
a Quarrel.
Fred Miller, night cashier in the Brook
lyn Restaurant, at 207 Sixth street, and
vho resides at 969 Howard street, was
shot in the back last night by Manual
Meads, a brother of John Meads, the pro
prietor of the restaurant. He was ar
rested by Officer T. P. Riordan and a
charge of assault to murder placed
against him. Young Miller was removed
to the Receiving Hospital, and although
Dr. Hartley probed for many minutes he
was unable to extract the bullet.
Miller claims that Meads entered the
restaurant last night and charged him
with bearing false reports to his brother.
This the wounded man denied and em
phasized his denial with a few choice ex
pressions. Meads then smashed him in
the face and a fight resulted. Miller had
his enemy on- the floor pummeling him
when Meads pulled a gun out and shot
at him.
Friends then separated the two, but
when Miller was moving to his desk
Meads shot him in the back.
The prisoner has charge of the Cream
ery Restaurant, 117 Sixth street, also
owned by John Meads.
