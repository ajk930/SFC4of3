OTIS ORDERED TO
SEND TROOPS TO
OCCUPY ILOILO
American Soldiers to Succor Spaniards
Who Are Besieged by Insurgents
on Panay Island.
WASHINGTON. D. G, Dec. 23.â The War Department telegraphed General Otis to-day:
"Send troops to Iloilo, island of Panay, and take possession and military control."
This action was taken by reason of reports that Filipinos and Spaniards were fighting, and
that the former suffered great losses. Otis is to use discretion in the selection of troops.
NEW YORK, Dec. 23.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Instructions have been given
Major General Otis at Manila by Sec
retary of War Alger to send troops to
occupy Hollo.
These instructions are the result of
a cablegram recently received from
General Otis requesting permission, in
view of the condition of affairs prevail
ing in the island of Panay, to take pos
session formally in the name of the
United States. The dispatch was dis
cussed at a Cabinet meeting, and as a
result the military commander has been
trild to send such troops as he may
deem advisable to succor the Span
lards who have been besieged in Iloilo
by the Insurgents for several months.
The Spaniards will not be considered
as prisoners of war, but will probably
remain at Ilnilo or Manila until ar
rangements are made by this Govern
ment for their transportation to Spain.
It is Intended to treat the insurgents
of Cebu in the same manner as U Â«
under command of Aguinaldo in Luzon.
No joint occupation of the city of Iloilo
will be allowed, and the insurgents will
not be allowed to enter the boundaries
of cities with arms in their possession.
The War Department authorities say
the Spanish force at Iloilo consists of
oniy $00 men, who have been heroically
defending the city from several thou
sand insurgents. It is the last Spanish
stronghold in the Philippines, and with
its occupation by American troops the
final vestige of Spanish authority in
the eastern islands will disappear.
While the occupation of Iloilo Is
simply a step on the part of the au
thorities in the direction ot the entire
â vÃs told to-day that no In
structions have been sent to General
r-tis to send troops to occupy all the
islands and will not be sent until the
treaty of peace is ratified.

WASHINGTON. Dec. 23.â Senator Stew

CAPTAIN BARRY IS
GIVEN A PROMOTION
England Will Increase Its New-
foundland Squadron Next
Year.
ST. JOHNS. N. F.. Dec. 23-Captaln
Henry D. Barry. Assistant Director of the
Naval Intelligence Office of the British
Admiralty, has been appointed to the
command of the British squadron in
City of Iloilo, Island of Panay, Philippines
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 24, 1898.
Newfoundland waters, with the rank of
Commodore, and the cruiser Comus as
his flagship. The appointment will go
Into effect next season. The squadron
will be increased by heavier vessels than
have heretofore been assigned here.
Captain Barry's appointment, which is
out of the regular order of selections, is
understood to be due to the desire of the
Imperial Secretary of State for the Colo
nies, Joseph Chamberlain, to have in
command of the squadron an officer
whose abilities can be utilized in the
many delicate complications certain to
result from Mr. Chamberlain's deter
mination to bring about a settlement of
the French shore question as speedily as
possible.
Captain Barry will also organize the
proposed naval reserve among' the fish
ermen of Newfoundland.

MRS. BOTKIN IN HER VARIETY.
The Accused Woman Completed Her Testimony Yesterday. S
Entered a Sweeping Denial to Many Statements Made by
Witnesses for the Prosecution. Although Frank Grey, the
Drug Clerk, Claims to Have Sold Her Arsenic, and Also
Claims an Acquaintance Extending Over a Considerable
Period, She Says She Never Saw Him Before and Never
Spoke to Him. She Said She Never Bought Arsenic in
Her Life. On the Stand She Was Somewhat Subdued, but
Posed Much After the Manner of Her Appearance on the
First Day.
MRS. CORDELIA BOTKIN
CALMLY ENTERS A SWEEPING
DENIAL TO MANY CHARGES
The Accused Woman Completes the Story of Her
Movements and of Her Benefactions to John
P. Dunning=A Mild Cross-Examination.
THE defenders of Mrs. Cordelia
Botkin have closed their case.
The woman charged with the
murder of Mrs. Dunning and Mrs.
Deane in Delaware concluded yes
terday the testimony she had to give
in support of her claims of innocence
and then withstood the ordeal of cross
examination by counsel for the people.
This cross-examination was not severe
and there were signs of evident delight
among the attorneys and relatives of
the prisoner when she was released
from the witness chair.
The surprise of the trial came In the
absolute denial by Mrs. Botkin of mat
ters which witnesses for the prosecu
tion swore to as absolute facts. Calm
ily she said she did nbt know Frank
Grey, the drug clerk. She had never
met him; had never talked with him
and had never purchased arsenic in her
life, either here or elsewhere. She de
: nied that she had ever discussed the
matter of postage rates "with her old
nurse, Mrs. Ruoff. She also denied that
Dunning had ever told her that his wife
was passionately fond of candy. The
witnesses affirmed these things on the
stand with positiveness.
Mrs. Botkin also claimed that Mrs.
Price, the manager of the Victoria Ho
tel, saw her on Monday. August 1, and
! not on Sunday, the last day of July,
;as she testified. Mrs. Botkin acknowl
! edges that she returned from a short
shopping trip on the Monday, but
I claimed to have been confined to her
! room all day Sunday, except when she
i went to the telephone in the house.
Mr. Dunning has claimed that his
: wife sent him a copy of an anonymous
letter, reserving the original for her
self. Mrs. Botkin swore that the
anonymous letter which Mr. Dunning
I sent her for inspection was in the same
; handwriting as those which have been
placed in evidence. The prosecution is
prepared to put in much evidence in
rebuttal to strengthen the case for the
people. It will try to controvert the
claims of the defense that Mr^. Bot
kin, in Humboldt County, could not
have mailed a letter which bears the
canceling stamp of the postoffice sta
tion at the foot of Market street. The
prosecution expects to show that let
ters are placed in a mail bag that
hangs at the gang plank of the steamer
and are brought to this city without
the stamps being canceled. Upon ar
rival here an official of the steamship
company takes the bundle of letters
and deposits them In the postofflce,
where they are run through the can
celing machine and the stamps killed.
The anonymous letter in question bears
date of June 17 and is postmarked June
I 18. It is a day's journey by sea from
, Humboldt County.
The opportunity of seeing Mrs. Bot
kin on the stand attracted an unusual
ly large crowd to the court yesterday.
Captain Callundan of Morse's patrol
was the first witness called, his testi
mony being for the purpose of im
peaching Mrs. Grace Harris, the for-
mer saleswoman at the City of Paris.
Mrs. Harris has been the especial mark
of the defenders of Mrs. Botkin, and
has been handled without gloves re
peatedly. Captain Callundan's knowl
edge of the woman's antecedents did
not get into evidence owing to the ob
jections of Mr. Hosmer. Knight ac
complished what he wanted by the
manner in which he asked his ques
tions, in which he set forth all that the
detective could tell.
J. W. Bird, the next witness, proved
the undoing of the lobby In the rear
portion of the courtroom. He had a
peculiar Swedish accent coupled with
a quaint framing of his words that
amused those in attendance. They
laughed immoderately at one of his
answers and Judgre Cook at once or
dered the room cleared of all persons
who could not find seats. This provea
a bitter disappointment to many. Mr.
Bird is a brother-in-law of Kitty Dett
ner, one of the candy girls. He ad
mitted under questioning by Mr. Hos
mer that he had tried persistently for
some months past to break the force of
Miss Kitties testimony. Mrs. A. F.
Grant followed the loquacious Bird on
the stand. She told of statements made
her by Miss Livernash. Mrs. Botkin
then tripped blithely to the stand. She
drew her chair quickly over to the edge
of the Jury box and then bent her gaze
intently on the men in whose keeping
is her life. Her affectations of the pre
vious day seemed more subduea and
her mannerisms not so pronounced. She
had the same abounding confidence in
herself and posed to her heart's con
tent.
As on the day before she paused oc
casionally and asked Mr. Knight in a
bored tone: "Ah! Do you want more
of that?" Her examination proved hei
to be a gay bird of passage. She flitted
from one lodging-bouse to another and
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
apparently at one time or another had
modest apartments in almost every
boarding-house in the city. Her cross
examination by Attorney Hosmer
seemed insipid and colorless when com
pared with the severity with which the
menacing Knight handled some of the
women with pasts that would not bear
the fierce light that beats down upon
the witness stand.
Mrs. Botkin seemed to dwell fondly
on the expression "My son Beverly. **
It was ever on her lips and Beverly,
the leviathan, seemed to have invaria
bly shared the company of their friend
'"Jack" Dunning together. Mr. Hosmer
tried to get from the witness her exact
relations with Dunning, but she bristled
up indignantly at the first hint of any
impropriety and Mr. Hosmer abandoned
that line of inquiry when objections to
some of his questions were sustained.
There were evidences of delight among
the supporters of the accused woman
when Mr. Hosmer said that was all.
After asking the jury if they had any
questions and receiving no response
Mr. Knight said that was the case for
the defense. An adjournment was then
taken over the Christmas holidays. The
trial will be resumed on Tuesday morn
ing.
THE PROCEEDINGS.
Captain J. J. Callunden, superintend
ent of Morse's patrol, was the first v.-it
ness of the day. He was called by At
torney Knight to prove the character and
to impeach the testimony of Mrs. Grace
Harris. The prosecution has attacked
this witness more savagely than they
have any other person who has testified
for the prosecution. Mrs. Harris' testi
mony as to the sale of the handkerchief
to a woman resembling Mrs. Botkin and
of her ordering it sent to the Victoria
Hotel created one of the sensations of the
trial. This has brought out all the bitter
ness of the defense. Knight was not able
to frame a question that would pass Mr.
Hosmer's objections, but he succeeded in
getting the facts he wished to prove be
fore the jury by means of his bitter ques
tions. The unfortunate Mrs. Harris is
not through yet, as a juror has asked
that she be recalled, as he desired to ask
a question regarding a tag she is said to
have made out.
J. W. Bird, brother-in-law of Miss
Kitty Dettner, one of the candy store
girls, was asked to tell what he knew of
that young woman's reputation for truth,
honesty and integrity. The witness had
the quaint accent of an "Ole Olson" or
"Yonny Yonson" of the vaudeville stage,
and but for Judge Cook would have had
the courtroom in an uproar. At the first
outbreak of laughter his Honor ordered
the lobby closed, and those remaining
were careful to control their feelings. The
witness' direct examination was a sim
ple one, as he was hardly called upon for
more than the bare statement that Miss
Dettner's reputation for truth was a bad
one. Turned over to Mr. Hosmer for
cross-examination he acknowledged that
he had had trouble with the young
woman, but said he had no prejudice
against her. He acknowledged that he
went out of his way to say mean things
about the young woman to newspaper
men and also to Chief Lees. He was
asked as to persons who had spoken un
kindly of Miss Dettner, and said their
name was "legion." "Her own brother
had said mean things about her, and to
recite the names of her detractors would
be tedious." Mr. Hosmer asked him to
let him be the best judge of that, and to
name at least one. He finally named
Mrs. McDonald as one who had said.
"What can we do with such a liar as Kitty
Dettner?" He denied that he had ever
made any approaches toward her. "If
you please, sir, it was the other way."
He said the obfect of his going to Chief
Lees was to secure fair play. He said the
Chief was not particularly interested in
his disclosures regarding the girl, but that
he was anxious to know if she made a
good appearance and would she be likely
to impress a jury favorably. He was
asked if he did not tell equally disagree
able stories about Kitties mother and
her grandmother. Regarding the girl's
mother he said sadly that she was his
mother-in-law, as though that explana
tion was all that was required. Xlxe wit2
ness declined to answer some questions
either "yes" or "no," saying that one
part of them required one answer and the
other a contrary one. Judge Cook lec
tured him severely upon his evasions of
questions: the first time he has felt called
upon to do .^o during the progress of the
trial.
The witness who had lightened the
gloom of the tragic trial reeking with ar- j
senic, poisoned candy and tales of illicit
love, finally gave way to Mrs. A. F.
c.nuit. music teacher at Healdsburg Col
lope. She repeated the oft-told tale of the
planner in which Miss Lizzie A. Livernash
gained the confidence of Mrs. Botkin. I
Miss Livernasta told Mrs. Grant that she i
had told Mrs. BqU n she was a woman of
*.he world. To Mr. Hosmcr she said she
fcore no ill will toward Miss Livernash.
Mrs. Botkin Was the next and the last
witness for the defense and with the enn
rlusion of her cross-examination Mr.
Knight said: "That is our case, if your
Honor please."
Fnder Mr. Knight's careful questioning
the defendant went on with the carefully
worded narrative sh*> commenced the day
b( forÂ«>. Sho first said that the letters in
her trunk from her husband all discussed
the divorce he seemed so - lxious to se
cure from her, to the end that he might
hestow his cooled affections elsewhere. In
response to questions regarding her cor
respondence with Dunning, she said that
on the eve of his departure for Cuba and
it= battlefields they had an understanding
that a regular correspondence was to be
kept up. He was to write of the war and
The stirring incidents through which he
passed and also to tell her with what suc
cess he had pul' " himself toe-ether to be
what he was not at that period.
He had written her three letters en
route. Her letters to him were equal in
number to those he wrote, perhaps more,
she said.
"When we parted there was no under
standing thnt our friendship was severed
for all time, but, on the contrary, we were
to follow up one another's movements.
He was anxious to know of my success
in dealing with my husband. I admon
ished him that it was best that he should
be with his family, where temptation
would not be strong. We never at any
time discussed the matter of each of us
getting a divorce and being thus able to
marry. T would not consider the matter
of a divorce, and my husband has no way
of procuring one, although he has repeat
edly asked for one.
"My friendship with Mr. Dunning was
open and above board. We went about
with my husband's consent, as he wanted
me to have a pood time so long as I was
in the company of gentlemen. While I
was at 927 Geary street Mr. Dunning's
financial condition was pitiable In the ex
treme. It was such that it would excite
pity in any woman. He was in extreme
want, and I helped him. I do not care
to refer to what I have done for him.
About this time he went to Salt Lake, in
an attempt to better his condition. He
remained away. five months, but did noth
ing, and then wanted money on which he
could return. He wired for funds so that
he could return here, and I sent him the
ssary funds. When he left here he
thought he had gone for good and that
be would never return. While he was in
Suit Lake he sent me what purported to
be an anonymous letter. With it he wrote
me that he had received it from his wife
and that he did not know who had sent
it. To his wife he had laid the blame at
the door of Mrs. CaHmbertie, but he really
did not know who wrote it. He said that
his enemies and mine apparently did not
intend to let us alone. I thought the letter ;
waa the work of some one who had lived j
at 987 Geary street and who had not en- j
joyed the good times we had there.
"I also suspected Mrs. Seeley, who had
an enmity toward mo. 1 had seen Mrs.
Running's handwriting, as he had shown
his wife's letters to myself, Mrs. Seeley
and my son Beverly. He would read to
us what she had to say about their little
girl, of whom he was very fond. The
anonymous letter was not a copy in the
handwriting of Mrs. Dunning, as has been
t.r- titied to in this case. As well as one's
memory can be depended upon, the letter
was a perfect counterpart of the other
anonymous letters."
"Did you on August 4 send by mail a
box of candy?" asked Knight.
"1 did not," was the answer.
"Did you ever send a box of candy to
Mrs. Dunning?"
â¢'I never did."
"1 never spoke to Mrs. Ruoff about rates
of postage as I knew all about such mat
ters and freight charges from the wide ex
perience I had as a purchasing agent. I
never wrote to Mrs. Dunning and 1 never
addressed a letter 'John P. Dunning.' It
was always 'J. P. Dunning Esq.' 1 had
no enmity toward Mrs. Dunning. I had
never seen the woman in my life and
never sent her a letter of any kind. I
certainly never saw the box of candy
until it was shown here and was never in
the candy shop. 1 never went to the Owl
drug store. 1 do not know Mr. Grey. I
never met him and never had any talk
with him. 1 never made a purchase of
arsenic in 'me' life in San Francisco or
in any other place. I never purchased the
handkerchief shown here and I never had
anything delivered to me from any shop
in this city.
"When Mr. Botkin was discussing the
question of us being divorced 1 consulted
Attorney W. EL L. Barnes with a view to
restating his efforts in that direction.
When Mr. Dunning went East we had no
discussion and no understanding as to my
joining him there, 1 hoped for the best
for him and never contemplated that mat
ters would be otherwise. On July 31 I
was ill in bed and did not leave my room
with the exception of the time I went to
telephone Dr. Ttrrlll. The Jap served
dinner to mo in my room and placed it
near my couch. On the following day,
August 1, I gathered myself together and,
aJter making myself presentable, 1 went
to the shop downstairs and made a num
ber of purchases of eatables. They had
no buns which I desired, so I took a loaf
of bread and some fruit. I then went to
a chemist's shop and made some pur
chases of toilet articles and returned to
the hotel. On the stairs I met Mrs. Price,
who reprimanded me, saying that in my
tllnesa 1 should have had the Jap or her
lad to serve me. I had these parcels when
I met Mrs. Price.
"Mr. Dunning never told me his wife
was passionately fond of candy. He used
to say that with her high ideals of life
she was too good for him. I always ad
vised him to go to his wife. 1 never dis
cussed marriage with him. It would be
an impossibility."
Mr. Hosmer, in his cross-examination,
had Mrs. Hotkin again trace her move
ments throughout the State from the first
time she met Dunning until Chief Lees
placed her under arrest. Her course led
her from boarding-house to boarding
house in this city, with trips to her rela
tives in Oakland. Stockton, Healdsburg,
Eureka and Ferndale.
To Mr. Hosmer she said she first met
Dunning in the autumn of 1895â she
thought in September. At the time she
was living ut 2217 Bush street. She did
not know where Dunning was living and
did not learn until some weeks later. She
told of the meetings with him at various
places, but usually at Ingleside race
course. Off and on between the betting
he left the ring and chatted with her.
Shortly after, in response to an invitation,
he visited her at her apartments one af
ternoon and stayed about an hour. He
then extended an invitation to her to dine
and shortly after she accepted. They went
to Delmonico's and had a private dining
room upstairs, where she said thÂ«y re
mained the usual length of time required
to take a meal and converseâ about an
hour or an hour and a half altogether.
The witness said she was frequently out
with him during the years 1896 and 1597
and dined frequently with him. She did
not recall the restaurants, but they were
always cheap ones after the first splurge,
and she said she paid for them more fre
quently after the first time than he did.
She a< knr.wledged to having been In thÂ«
waiting room of the Hoffman House cafe
and also in the Hamilton House, Oakland.
The latter time was while she was in her
convalescent state after her illness and
she had taken a car ride out there. She
had never gone to the Columbia cafe, but
she had gone to the theater of that name.
She had never seen Mrs. Dunning, but
knew there was a <hild in the family, as
the father had told her so.
Mr. ITosmer asked if Mr. Dunning had
ever asked for money. The witness
thought he ankcd if she had tried to get
some from him. She drew herself up in
dignantly as though it was preposterous,
and she was about to give a sharp answer
before she understood the question. She
said he had asked for money. He visited
her frequently at Bush street. After
dining with his wife and child he would
stroll out for a walk and would usually
call on her. He would discuss his success
or failure at the track during the day and
then rejoin his family. When pressed for
an answer requiring a date tne witness
pleaded bad memory. While she was on
Bush street she frequently met Dunning
downtown. Dunning went to live at 927
Geary street about Christmas. 1896. He
was there so continuously that the little
party of four, consisting of Dunning, Mrs.
Botkin, Mrs. Seeley and Beverly, all de
cided that it was only proper that he
should take a room there. One was va
cant at that time and he took it. stay
ing until the time he went to Salt Lave*
Mrs. Botkin said she was in his company
continuously. She took meals with him,
or rather he took imals with her, as she
corrected herself to say. He was con
stantly In her room after he returned
from the races, and after a day at tne
track he was frequently without funds.
As to the character of the social life there
she said they all dined together, and then
there were games of whist and other
games with cards, after which she would
provide refreshments in the shape of tea
and salad. Mr. Dunning and her son, Bev
erly, would drink beer, and "bracers"
made of whisky. The witness occasionally
took some of the "bracers" as brewed by
the men, and admitted that she linally
fw to like them. Mr. Hosmer tried to
at the nature of the intimacy existing
ween the prisoner and Dunning, but
bristled up and was rapidly growing
indignant whon her questioner desisted.
He did ask If they spent the entire nignt
together, and she said, "He had his room
and I had mine."
She said her husband in Stockton know
she was keeping company with Dunning,
and that he knew him under his real name,
Iverly, my son, knew him aa 'Jack,'
in the letters of my husband wnere
k' is used it means Dunning."
c couple corresponded regularly while
nine was In Salt Lake, and she said
c of hers were long epistles. She did
not have him come back at her instance,
although she sent him the money for his
fare and was glad that he returned. She
told of him sleeping on the i of the
Press Club at times when he did not have
the money to secure a room. She fur
nished him with food when he had none.
The witness acknowledged that she was
at the foot of Market street on the day
on which the box of poisoned candy is
supposed to have been maued in this city.
She was on her way to her sister's at
Ht-ald-sburg.
She told In detail the checking of her
trunk and the purchase of her ticket. She
had to hasten, as she just had time to
take her small luggage and get the boat.
It was about 7 o'clockâ justâ gloamingâ
when she reached her destination. Two
days later she drove across country with
her sister, where she remained until the
trip to Stockton to seek the protection of
her husband. Mr. Hosmer after this re
cital took her abruptly on her trip to Eu
reka, which she described in detail.
After drawing from her an acknowledg
ment that she had frequently purchased
articles at the City of Paris, Mr. Hosmer
surprised everybody by saying: 'That is
all, your Honor." Mr. KnitriiL asked if
any juryman desired to ask Mrs. Botkin
any question. She stood up promptly, but
the twelve men In the jury box had noth

Giant Scales Installed in the Govern- '.
ment Gunshops in Washington.
Everybody is perhaps aware that tho
', large scales upon which the entire j
freight cars with their loads of many |
tons are weighed are considered im- j
mense, but with all their immensity, >
i Uncle Sam has gone all the railroads in :
| the country one point better by install- ;
â  ing at the navy-yard one of the largest :
j pair of scales in the country. This
' machine can outweigh the largest rail-
I road weighing machine by fifty tons,
j and its results must be accurate to a
I pound, while railroad scales are con
| sidered good if they approach any-
I where near fifty pounds of being cor- '
I rect. The new scales are placed on :
I the track going south from the great j
j gun shops and just opposite the forge
shop. They are 48 feet long and 12 i
| feet wide, and rest upon a cement base j
built upon long piles. The ground is i
somewhat low, and it was necessary to j
utilize the services of pile drivers to se- !
cure a stable foundation, which is one \
of the requisites of an accurate weigh- j
ing machine. The cost was about $1200. i
Much o-f its fine and sensitive balanc- j
ing apparatus was manufactured for I
special use in the new machine, and the '
, completed structure Is considered a j
model and marvel of modern mechan- j
ism and American ingenuity.
In order to illustrate the accuracy of I
the counterpoise of the machine to a !
reporter the Superintendent of Yards !
; and Docks picked up a half brick which !
| was lying on the ground near by and ;
i tossed it on the huge platform of the
machine. He then consulted the long
brass lever in the reading box along jhe !
side of the scales and found that the i
record of the brickbat was just a
pound.
Turning to the reporter he said that
i the machine is so sensitive that it can
weigh anything from a pound of sugar
to a trio of thirteen-inch naval guns,
and weigh them accurately, though it
will probably eke out a long existence :
at the famous gunshop without having '
, the chance to weigh an ounce of the
former. The capacity of the new scales
is 150 tons, or double the capacity of
I the old scales, which have just been -
replaced. A thirteen-inch gun weighs
about fifty-five tons, and it may be
readily seen that the new scales can I
weigh two of the monsters, reclining on
a forty-eight-foot car track, and not
tax its capacity to any great extent.
All the big guns of the new navy will
be weighed upon these colossal scales. â ,

Disclosure of an Organized Attempt
to "Count Out" James H. Camp
bell for District
Attorney.
Special DiEpatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 23.â Interest is in
! creasing in the contests over the elec
i tion of Sheriff, Treasurer and City Jus
j tice, and the disclosures thus far made
: indicate that fraud was perpetrated by
: the "gang" at the last election. The
; count is progressing very slowly, but
I two precincts having been tallied to
! day. At this rate three weeks will be
required to recount the county. In the
Second Precinct of this city, Lyndon
gained ten votes. The net gains of
the contestants in the three precincts
of the city counted are as follows:
Lyndon (Sheriff), 12; Conant (Treas
urer), 3, and Aggeler (City Justice), 4.
If this ratio keeps up these officers
will win on the vote of the city, and
it will not be necessary to count the
outlying precincts.
An organized attempt to count out
James H. Campbell, the Good Govern.
ment-Democratic nominee for District
Attorney, has come to light through
the contest. The ballots of the First
and Second precincts show that B. A.
Herrington, Rea's candidate, was given
35 votes he was not entitled to. The
Third Precinct v.ill show about 8 votes
counted illegally for Herrington. Thj
"gang" made an especially hard fi?ht
to elect the District Attorney, and it
was reported fraud was perpetrated in
the hope of accomplishing it.
Last night Herrington secretly filed a
contest of Campbell's election, but
knowing ones declare it will neve*
come to trial, now that evidence of
fraud has been unearthed. The peti
tion, which is signed by L. O'Neal, al
leges that 600 votes were counted for
Campbell that should have gone to
Herrington. The matter was up be
fore. Judge Lorigan this morning, but
no date was set for the hearing.
Campbell was given the certificate of
election on a majority of 39.

Governor Refuses to Re
prieve the Negro.
FRANKFORT, Ky.. Dec. 23.â Governor
Bradley to-night refused to extend clem
ency in the case of "Bob" Blanks of May
Held, sentenced to be hangod on Februarj
23 next, thus closing a rather sensationa
chapter In Kentucy history.
Blanks, a negro, assaulted Teenie Bay
ky, a 12-year-old white girl, in Graves
County, in January last. He escaped Into
Illinois, and Governor Bradley made
requisition and had Blanks brought to
Louisville. On the date of his trial the
adjutant general, with a company o
Statue trooj.s, accompanied the negro to
Graven County, remained there until the
case was ended, and brought the prisoner
back to Louisville. He has since been in
jail there, and will not be taken to the
scene of his crime until a few days be
fore his execution.
A MAN OF NERVE."
He Gave a Remarkably Cool Recep
tion to a Burglar.
"Coolest man I ever met," tells the
reformed burglar, "was right here in
Detroit. No matter how it was dope;
I got a line on his huuse. knew where
the silver and jewelry were kept, and
also knew that he had some wealthy
visitors with diamonds and other costly
trinkets well worth gathering in. i
went through the rear window as
fiuickly as any glazier could have done
and the burglar alarm never chirped
a note. I sat down to satisfy myself
that no one in the house was stirring
and to smile at a little iron safe that
an expert could open with a hairpin. I
was just about to begin the campaign
when I received a slight tap on the
shoulder, and whirled about to be con
fronted with my cool gentleman, a re
volver held c-n a level with my fore
head. His hand was as firm as a rock,
there was a dancing light in his eyes
and his color was perfectly natural.
" 'Glad I happened to notice your en
trance,' he remarked in a pleasant
voice. 'Anything I can do for you?'
" 'For â for heaven's sake, don't shoot,'
I managed to stammer.
" "Sorry to violate the etiquette of
hospitality,' he laughed, 'but I have an
Irresistible impulse to bang away, and
you're standing right where I'm going
to shoot. It is ju.Â«t possible that I can
restrain myself for a couple of seconds,
but not a moment longer.' He wus
grinning like a big good-hearted school
boy, but I knew what was expected of
me. I dove through that window like
a streak of lightning, never stopping
for my kit, ran three miles and just
caught the train for Chicago. If I
had that mans nerve I fear I never
would have reformed." â Detroit Free

WHY THE CREW GREW FLESHY.
Phenomenon Explained by the Pres
ence of Much Arsenic Aboard.
The German bark Zion, which ar
rived at this port recently from Fowey,
England, brought a rather peculiar
cargo. It consisted of IsOO cask 3of
china clay, but in addition there were
on board 300 casks of arsenic. This
part of the cargo had a remarkable ef
fect on the crew.
The fact that arsenic as well as
'trychnine helps the formation of adi
pose tissue when taken into the hu
man system in minute particles is well
known, and both drugs have become
favorite tonics for convalescents. On
ioard the Zion the men slept very near
the large array of barrels containing
Lhe drug. They were stored in the
iold, near the forecastle, and partially
?xposed to the rays of the sun, which
streamed in through the open hatch.
When only about a week out from
Dort one of the crew mentioned to his
messmates that a peculiar and inde
scribable odor was coming from the
â¢asks containing the drug. It was not
ong after their attention had been
to it that they all noticed the
same thing 1 , and, strange to say, no
iced it all the more forcibly a week
ater. Several of the German tars be
â¢ame aware of the fact that they were
Wing out their clothes to a much

Many Qthers, as days went by, became
ibnormally stout, in vast contrast to
.he former slim appearance which
many of them presented before the
and was left. One man gained, it is
aid, twenty-five pounds. Others were
iffected to a less extent. But the ag
gregate weight put on by the entire
Tew was little less than 400 pounds.
Several of the sailors are known here,
md they are said to be scarcely recog
lizable when contrasted with the old
lays. The entire sudden taking on of
avoirdupois is attributed to vapor,
which, generated by the action of the
sun on the casks, was inhaled by the
i seamen as they slept and acted in pre
'â  cisely the same manner which it does
) when given as a tonic in a prescrip
tion. Captain Hammes, who slept aft
in the vessel, entirely removed from the
arsenic, does not show any effect of the
inhalation.â Philadelphia Times.
ANOTHEB BRAVE DEWEY.
How Captain Samuel Sawed Jackson's
Figurehead From Constitution.
Now, when the nation rings with the
name of Dewey, the exploit of Captain
Samuel Dewey of Massachusetts should
: have place among our sailor yarns. Ben.
Perley Poore in his "Reminiscences" gives
an account of the capture of the figure
head of Andrew Jackson from the ship
Constitution by this daring young mari
ner. It appears when "the solid men of
Boston" ascertained that General Jackson
actually signed the order for the removal
of deposits from the Bank of the United
I States while enjoying their hospitality
| they were very angry, and soon after, on
learning that the United States frigate
Constitution, a Boston-built vessel, which
was being repaired at the Charlestown
navy-yard, was to be ornamented with a
full-length figure of General Jackson,
they regarded it as an insult.
The carver was ordered to stop his
work. This he declined to do, and had
the half-finished block of wood removed
to the navy-yard, where his work was
completed under the protection of a guard
of â¢marines. When the figurehead was
completed and fastened to the cutwater
of the Constitution she was hauled to
i her anchorage and a vessel stationed as a
! guard on either side of her. The indigna
' tlon of the Bostonians had now reached
fighting pitch and Captain Dewey deter
i mined the head should come down. Late
! one night, during a violent storm, he
! dropped into a rowboat and started for
I the ve.ssel. All was dark except when
lightning shot across the sky, illuminat
ing the harbor and guiding Dewey to the
Constitution.
Making fast his boat to the bow of the
| vessel, he climbed up, protected by some
headboards left there the day before. A
: sharp saw soon did the work, and an hour
later Dewey entered the door of Galla
i gher's hotel, where a party of friends
' anxiously awaited him, bearing aloft the
grim visage of Andrew Jackson. Uproar
ious shouts greeted him, and he at once
became the lion of the Whigs. Commo
dore Elliott, though frantio with rage
over the insult offered his chief, was
powerless to do anything. Soon after
1Â»> wry went to Washington, taking his
trophy with him, where it was passed
around among the leading Whigs. Finally
he called on the Secretary of War, taking
the head tied up in a bandana handker
chief.
"Mr. Dickerson," said the captain, "I
am the man who removed the figurehead
from the Constitution, and I have brought
it here to restore it."
Secretary Dickerson looked in astonish
ment at the man who had the boldness to
> ;ist such an indignity upon the adminis
tration.
"Well, sir!" he exclaimed, "so you are
the man who had the audacity to disfigure
Old Ironsides?"
"Yes, I took the responsibility."
"I shall have you arrested immediate
ly." and the Secretary reached toward his
bell to summon a messenger.
"Stop, Mr. Secretary," Interposed the
captain. "You, as a lawyer, know that
there is no statute against defacing a
ship of war, and all you can do is to sue
me for trespass, and that in the county
whore the offense was committed. If you
desire it, I will go back to Middlesex
County and stand my trial."
After a few monifnts 1 reflection, Diek
f-rsun admitted that he was correct. Then.
asking him to wait, he stepped over to the
White House, followed by an attendant
carrying the head. At the sight of It the
President burst into an uncontrollable fit.
of laughter.
"Why, that," he cried at length, "why,
that is the most infernal graven image I
ever saw. That fellow did perfectly right.
You've got him, you say? Well, give him
a kick and my compliments and tell him
to Saw it off again."â Leslie's Weekly.
A FLOATING EXPOSITION.
The Shipload of Its Products Which
Austria Will Show in the
Orient.
Austria-Hungary lags behind in the
race for foreign trade. Hungary is given
to agriculture, and her manufactures are
inconsiderable. Austria lacks the coal and
iron that add so much to the wealth and
industrial activity of Germany. Most of
the manufactures of the empire are pro
duced in the rugged parts of Austria
proper, and though in variety and volume
they fall far below those of Germany the
country is capable of much larger produc
tion, and is now trying to expand its
trade.
The latest effort In this direction is the
floating exposition, which is to- start from
Trieste in December. It will spend tne
next six months visiting all the leading
ports of India and the Orient and a few
islands in the Indian and Pacific oceans.
A large steamship has been chartered
from the Austrian Lloyds Steamship
Company, and the imperial Government
has encouraged the enterprise with a
grant of $20,300. Among the ports to be
visited are the Piraeus, Salonlca. Constan
tinople, Smyrna, Alexandria, Massowah,
Aden, Bombay, Colombo, Calcutta, Ran
goon, Singapore, Bangkok. Saigon, Kata
via, Oebu, Manila. Canton, Hongkong,
Swatow, Amoy, Fuchau, Shanghai. W.i
Hal Wei, Cheefoo, Port Arthur, Nagas
aki, Kobe and Yokohama.
The ship will carry samples of Austro-
Hungarian products, and nic entire ves
sel. llt ted up with booths and lighted by
electricity, will be a vast storehouse of
exhibits. Each exhibitor win pay accord
ing to the space up occupies, and thirty or
forty experts will accompany the floating
show to give information. The exposition
will be free to all, anu its arrival in each
port will be announced In advance in the
newspapers and by posters i.nd circulars.
Catalogues printed in four languages wiil
be distributed Gratuitously, and the
agents on board may receive orders, but
can se only at the prices fixed by the ex
hibitors. An ice machine will be on board
to insure the freshness of all the products,
particularly the wine and beer.
This enterprise is not original with Aus
tria. It wns tried with success by Switz
erland years ago. The larger country
m.'iy well take other lessons from the
little republic, for Switzerland, an
Inland state, denendent upon for
eign ports to receive and dispatch all

in proportion to its population, one of the
leading commercial nations.â New York

A Sergeant's Opinion.
On a recent trip West we rode for many
miles, in sleeping and dining cars, with an
intelligent young man, a sergeant in an
Ohio regiment, going home on sick fur
lough to recuperate. While mourning his
forced inactivity during the war, he spoke
most plainly and positively of the real
reasons which underlaid many of the
complaints as to the treatment the troops
received. Most prominent among them
was the lack of discipline in many of the
volunteer regiments, brought about large
ly by the unwise mingling of officers with
their men when off duty. Some of those
in command would, perhaps naturally but
very unwisely, participate in athletic
games and sports during hours of idle
ness, and then be surprised that their
commands, when on duty, were looked
upon sis being more in the nature of ad
vice than an order to be unquestionably
obeyed. The remarks of our soldier friend
were in accord with universal experience,
which has ever shown the importance of
keeping up most rigidly the lines which
divide privates and officers, if that disci
pline is to be maintained upon which the
safety and well-being of all depend in
war.â Episcopal Recorder.

American Farmers Slandered.
The London Spectator says: "You can
not rid the average American farmer of
the . idea that When silver and paper
money are plenty times will be good."
rho average American farmer deserves a
better-reputation than this. He showed
In the recent election that he does not
think silver and paper money in abund
ance necessarily make good times. ' In
that election he declared that silver and
paper currency need bracing up, and that
jold must be used to do the bracing. The
farmer voted for the preservation of the
gold standard. It was the farmer's vote
which saved the gold standard from as
sault in the next House o Representa
tives. If the farmers had been faith
less to the cause of financial sanity the
Republicans would have been beaten in

commercial region the Republicans lost
ground. They gained ground in the ag
ricultural districts. , -.When the Specta

CLEVELAND, Dec. 23. â Evidence
was obtained from additional witnesses
to-day to show that books belonging to
the Standard Oil Company had been
destroyed on November 20 and 21. The
first witness examined before Notary-
Mason to-day was George Fields, who
was said to have sent employes of the
company to the general offices after the
books that were alleged to have been
destroyed.
Fields said he was employed In the
car shops of the Standard. He said he
was Instructed by telephone to send two
men to the general office.
Moran said he was sent by Fields to
the general offices on November 19
after boxes of bcroks and papers. Ed
ward O'Hea and Mclnerney went with
him and Harry Gabeline and Henry
Schaf came In the afternoon. Moran
said the boxes were about four feet
square and weighed about 300 pounds.
He said that the hallway was so nar
row that he lowered them to the ground
with a block and tackle through a win
dow. The boxes were lowered upon a
wagon and taken to a storehouse on
Independence street.
Moran said that on the following
Monday morning the general office tele
phoned to the car shops for two men.
Mclnerney and himself were sent. On
that mc-rning they took some boxes
from the storehouse to the river pump
house. He did not know whether they
were the same boxes that they had got
Saturday. They took the boxes to the
furnaces and burned the contents. He
admitted that he had talked to Attorney
S. H. Tolles of the Standard in regard
to the destruction of the books.
On cross-examination by Attorney
Tolles Moran said that he knew a lot
of books and papers were burned a
year ago, but he did not help burn
them. Books were burned on Saturday
In the car shops and on Monday in the
pumphouse. Nobody said anything to
him about the matter.
Several other witnesses appeared to
day, but their depositions were not
taken. Constable McMahon was sent
to subpena several bookkeepers and
clerks employed at the Euclid-avenue
offices, but came back with the report
that he had been unable to find any
of the men. he had been looking for.
Another effort was made to-day to sub
pena Secretary Squire of the Standard
Company and Frank Rockefeller, but
neither could be found.
The taking of depositions was contin
ued until 9 o'clock to-morrow morning.

"The Queen's Musketeers," which ia

Indeed, he was counting upon the suc
cess of his new work as a means of get
ting his affairs into order again, says T.
P. O'Connor in the London Sun. He had
taken the very best of care with it,
eliminating every phrase and every bar
that smacked of the commonplace. Espe
ciallyâand here lies the whole point of
the storyâ he had been at infinite pains to
avoid repeating himself, and to strike out
every motif that might lead his critics to
accuse him of plagiarism from his former
operas. \ -. , ... â ;â .' .-.. - .- ;- â¢ -
The rehearsals went on capitally; the
artistes were delighted with their parts.
Everything foretold success. One day, as
he left the theater after rehearsal and
took a stroll along the boulevard, he
heard somebody whistling a tune near
him. He listened in amazement, for it
was a tune that he recognized only too
well. Heavens! it was just the air of the
song which he had written for Captain
Roland in his new piece. :'â â¢'
Unconsciously he had been composing
from memory. He went up to the whist
ler, a worthy workman, who was still
continuing his tune, and asked him what
on earth he was whistling. .........
"My friend, you are surprised," said the
man, "and no wonder. Do you know that
there is not another man in the â  streets
of Paris who could whistle you that
tune?" â â  â¢â¢- . '.:/ :-.%â

Early Marine Engineering in the
United States.
In 1830 gongs for the engine room were
unknown, and in many of the boats, when
the pilot was in his house (if there was
one) or on the deck over the engine room,
he would signal to the engineer by the
strokes of a stick or cane upon the floor
of the house or deck. All boats, of course,
carried bells, and by them all notices of de
parture and of arriving were made known,
and all salutes between boats were given
by their bells. To blow steam, as is now
done by a whistle, was intended to be a
challenge or an Insult.
In July, 1837. --c first steam launch, the
Sweetheart, 35 feet in length, 4 feet 3
inches of beam, and 3 feet depth, engine
4 by 12 inches, wheels 3 feet 6 inches in
diameter, and boiler horizontal fire tubu
lar, designed and constructed at the
United States Navy Yard. New York, by
the writer, then v_,hief Engineer of the
navy, was completed, and on her trial and
succeeding trips around the city of New
York was saluted with the bells of j
passing steamboats and cheered by peo- j
pie, who rushed to the ends of the piers i
to witness the novel sight. She attained
a speed of 8.5 miles per hour. The engine i
was subsequently transferred to tne
United States Naval School at Annapolis.
Fuel, up to the year 1836, was wholly
pine wood, though about that time some
owners of steamboats commenced experi
menting upon the practicability of using
anthracite coal. A steamboat on her
route of six or more hours could not have
the capacity in her fire room to contain
all the wood required, and was compelled
to pile it upon her side houses; and such
boats as were on a long route, as from
New York to Providence, were compelled
to invade their upper deck with wood,
and upon leaving the city had somewhat
the resemblance of a floating woodyard.

a commanding general should be in ab

Howard said he had never

: officers for service in time of war. His
experience confirmed this, and he
thought there were many experienced
retired officers who could have served
\ the Government better than some of
the young and inexperienced men who
j were appointed from civil life. He
i thought all officers not regulars should

General Howard was also in favor of

their cordial -welcome and compliment
ing the members of his regiment, he
justified his resignation as follows:
I had five months of peace in the amy,
and resigned In order to take part in 'a
ngnt. I am as much interested in the
people of the Vnited States as l an > the
people to Cuba, and, unless I am mistaken
in judging-, we are called upon to meet
more important problems in the United
fiiL tes , J^t now than will confront our
army in Cuba.
Some of these problems -were under dis
cussion before hostilities began; others
have been thrust upon us as a result "of
the war. Let me improve this, my first
opportunity, to assure you that my zeal
' or the reforms advocated a few months
ago has not in the least abated Vital
questions cannot be killed or buried and
we were dealing with vital question^
when the call to arms resounded through
the land.
The American people have not accepted
the gold standard as final. It has wrought
more injustice in our country during the
last twenty-five years than Spain has
wrought in all her colonies, and oDposi
t on to it will grow until the sold and
silver coinage of the constitution is fully
restored. The trusts which now flourish
in defiance of law are more merciless
than Weyler was, and the new trustâ the
paper money trust which is seeking to
obtain control of all the paper money of
the nationâ a greater menace to the
country's welfare than any foreign foe.
There are however, two new questions
that demand immediate attention, because
Congress is asked to act upon them at
once. The President recommends that
the regular army be permanently in
creased to 100,000 men. "This question
must be met now or not at all.
Taking up the subject of imperialism.
Bryan said that the President misin
terpreted the sentiment of the DeoDle
They are opposed to giving the
Philippine Islands i -k to Spain, but
they have not as ye- 'blared in favor
of embarking upon a colonial Dollcy.
So great a change, he said, could not
be undertaken without more investiga
tion and deliberation than the Deode
had yet give nto the subject. The prin
cipal part of Bryan's speech was
devoted to the Philippine question.
In this connection he referred to Presi
dent McKinley's inquiry. "Who will
haul down the flag?" and replied:
The flag is a national emblem, and is
obedient to the national will. It is made
for the people, not the people for the
flag. A hen the American people want
the flag raised they raise it; when
they want It hauled down they haul
it down. The flag was raised upon Ca
nadian soil- during the war of 1812 and it
was hauled down when peace was re
stored. The flag was planted upon Che
pultepec during the war with Mexico and
it was hauled down when the war was
over. The morning- papers announce that
General Lee ordered the flag hauled down
in Cuba yesterday because it was raised
too soon. The flag will be raised in Cuba
again on the Ist of January, but the
President declares in his message that it
will be hauled down as soon as a stable
government is established. Who will de
ny to the people the right to haul the
flag down in the Philippines if they so
? e^f e he ? a stable government is es
tablished there?
Our flag stands for an indissoluble
union of indestructibio States
State Is represented by a star, and
Territory sees in the constitution a
or hope that will some day take its place
in the constellation. What Is there in
the nag to awaken the zeal or raise the
aspirations of vassal colonies, which are
too good to cast away. t>ut not good
enough to be admitted to the sisterhood
of States?
Shall we keep the Philippines and
amend our flag? Shall we add a new <*tar
âthe blood star. Marsâ to indicate that
we have entered upon a career of con
quest? Or shall we borrow the veltow
which in 1896 was the bad*Â»Â» of goM and
gr.^.l. and paint Saturn and his rings to
suggest a carpetbag government, with its
â cbestea of spoliation Or shall we adorn
our flaers with a milky way composed of
a multitude of minor stars representing
remote and insignificant dependencies?
No, a thousand times better to haul
down the stars and stripes and substi
tute the flag of an independent republic
than to surrender the doctrines that give
glory to "Old Glory.' It was the flag of
our fathers in the years that are gone;
it is the flag dt a reunited coumtrj I -
day. Let it be the flag of our nation In
the years that are to come. Its stripes
of red tell of the blodod that was shed to
purchase liberty; its stripes of white
proclaim the pure and heaven born pur
f a government which derives its
Just powers from the consent of the gov
erned. The mission of that flag- is to
float, not over a conglomeration of com
monwealths, but over '"the land of the
frÂ»e and the home nt the brave," and to
that mission it must remain "forever
true â forever true."
Colonel Bryan's speech was the only
one of length at the reception.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 24, 189 S.
DECIDES A VAST
ARMY MAY MENACE
PUBLIC LIBERTIES
Minority of the H ouse Military
Committee Opposes tfje Plar)
for 100,000 Regulars.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.â The minor
ity of the Committee on Military Af
fairs filed with the clerk of the House
their report on the Hull bill to Increase
the army to 100,000 men. It is as fol
lows:
The minority of the committee dissent
from the majroity of the committee be
cause the bill reported makes a perma
nent standing- army for the United States
of over 100.000. Such an army is not nec
essary to be maintained in this country
now, neither because of our relations to
the islands of the sea, nor because of any
necessity which in the past year has aris
en in this country itself. The evils of
standing armies are too well known to
be dilated upon here. Such a standing
army as the one proposed would in time
of peace be a menace to the liberty of
citizens and in the time of war would not
be sufficient to meet successfully the ar
mies of the first-class powers of the
world. Happily, we are so situated that a
large standing army Ms not a necessity
and would only be a luxury to be sup
ported by the taxes of the people. It '1.
estimated that the Hull bill will cost the
people annually the sum of $150,000,000.
This would be a permanent charge upon
the people; $14; ,000 .000 are being paid an
nually to the soldiers of the Civil War
and the war with Spain, thus placing a
permanent charge of $295,000,000 upon the
people of the United States, and this to
maintain the military establishments
alone, to say nothing of the navy. The
passage of this bill means the practical
destruction of the National Guard and
the volunteer troops of the States. With
such a large standing army the citizen
soldiery of the country would feel that it
was not necessary to prepare for war in
time of peace, nor go to war in time of
war. The taxes which are now so bur
densome to the people will continue to
be collected, and will rather be increased
than otherwise. No hope of economical
administration can be indulged in. while
such permanent and lavish expenditure
is provided for.
It is well understood that the great cor
porate interests of the country are de
manding this large standing army, and
their reasons for such a demand are too
obvious to be pointed out. These inter
ests want force to enforce their demands,
and a President dominated by such inter
ests would have, with such a standing
army, the means at his hand to invade
the liberties of the people, to suppress
freedom of speech and to desecrate the
ballot box itself. It is needless, however,
to continue to point out the many evils
of this bill: suffice it to say that both In
form and in substance it overturns the
policy which has been pursued so success
fully by this Government for so many
years and launches the country upon *
course which can only terminate in the
destruction of the liberties of the people.
LUMBER SHEDS AND
DRY KILN BURNED
Conflagration Rages on the Al
bion Company's Grounds
at Mendocino.
MENDOCTNO. Dec. 23.â Three dry kilns, several sheds, thousands
of feet of lumber and huge piles of shingles belonging to the Albion
Lumber Company went up In smoke early this morning. The fire
was discovered in one of the lumber sheds adjoining the dry kilns by
the watchman. The entire population turned out at the sounding of
the alarm and every effort was at once directed toward saving the
surrounding property. This was no easy task, as the three kilns con
tained upward of 200,000 feet of dry lumber and the kilns were located
but a few yards from the mill. There were, besides, huge sheds full
of lumber as dry as tinder. Bhiploads of shingles and long- piles of
railroad ties.
The water supply was first' class and four large streams were
kept playing upon the mill's smoking walls. The county bridge
across Albion River caught fire, and for a time It was thought the
whole structure would be destroyed. The approach on this side was
burned away, but the main part of the bridge was saved. The large
pile of ties upon the bulkhead near the kilns was partially destroyed.
Thousands of ties were saved by being thrown into the river.
The loss probably will reach 525,000 or $30,000. perhaps more. The
three dry kilns were valued at $4000. At least 200,000 feet of the very
best lumber was burned, as were several thousand shingles and rail
road ties. The amount of insurance carried upon the destroyed
property is unknown.
COLLUM RETURNED TO

WOODLAND, Dec. 23.â Deputy Sheriff
Griffin arrival from Folsom this morning
with Phil Oollum. who has been serving I
a term in the State Prison for attempt- j
Ing to burn the Woodland Woolen Ktlis,
and who was recently granted a new trÂ»al
by the Supreme Court. The prisoner was 1
taken Immediately before Judge Hart in j
3 .perior Court. W. A. Anderson. As- 1
-. District Attorney, represented the ;
-. and asked that the case be set
for trial. Attorney Clark, on behalf of :
the defendant, asked for a dismissal on
the grounds that the District Attorney
should not ask that the case be retried,
as there was no possible chance of ob- ;
talning a conviction. After a reading of i
the testimony and the applying of the de- 1
of the higher court in regard to Uh
law. Judge Hart said that while he had
the power to dismiss the case he would
Dot do so If the prosecuting officer of
fered any objection. Mr. Anderson ob
jected.
Mr. Clark then said he desired to re
serve the right to present a motion for
the dismissal of the defendant upon the :
grounds that he had been once charged '<
with arson and a jury found him not
guilty of that crime, but brought in a ver
dict of guilty of attempt to commit
arson. Mr. Clark maintained that :
Collum again upon the charge of arooa
would be to put him in jeopardy twice for
the same ofTense. The court Informed the !
attorney for the defendant that he would
grant him the privilege of being nâ¬ard
upon that point, and the case was then j
continued for one week, to be set for trial. ;

at the present time.

CalL
The minority, holding the views above
expressed, have thought they owed it to
the country to present to the House of
Representatives a substitute for the bill
reported by the majority. They here
with report said substitute as embodying
every need of the Government in its pres
ent condition, and at the same time pre
serving- with scrupulous care the liberty
of the citizen and avoiding the evils of a
great standing army.
The substitute provides for a perma
nent standing- army of 30,000 enlisted
men, about the number in the army
before the war with Spain. The reor
ganization provided for in the substi
tute conforms to what it has been with
some few important changes. A largei
number of men is provided for artillery
than usual by reason of the necessity
of manning our coast defenses, upon
which large sums have been spent. The
substitute also provides for 50,000 vol
unteers to be taken from the States
and Territories and the District of
Columbia, in proportion to population;
these volunteers are to be mustered out
of the service of the United States
within two years from the date of -.he
assage of* the act, unless sooner termi
nated. Their organization is to be the
same as that of the regular army.
Volunteer organizations now in serv
ice are to be given preference as to
re-enlistment. All volunteers now in
the service of the United States are to
be mustered out within sixty days from
the passage of this act. The substitute
is not to operate to discharge any com
missioned officer who was in the army
of the United States prior to the war
with Spain. The necessity for this body
of volunteer troops arises from the re
lations which the United States Gov
ernment now bears to Porto Rico, Cuba.
the Philippine Islands, the Hawaiian
Islands and the Ladrone Islands. Fifty
thousand men are very near the mark
which the general of the army said
would be necessary in these islands in
his testimony before the Committee on
Military Affairs.
Representative Hay of Virginia, who
prepared the minority report, estimates
that the regular army establishment
provided for in the minority substitute
would entail an annual expenditure of
$30,000,000, or about $1000 per man, and
that the volunteer force of 50,000 men
by the same calculation would cost
550,000,000. or a total during the exist
ence of the volunteer army of 189,006,
000. The War Department is preparing
official estimates which will be ready in
a few days.

FOR "FREEDOM"
Letters Sent to Senator

AGONCILLO MAKES A PLEA
SELF-GOVEBNMENT ASKED FOE/
THE PHILIPPINES.
It Is Asserted That Aguinaldo Has
Established **a Regular and
Orderly Civil and Military
Administration."
S?*-Aal Disaatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23. â Senator
Hale yesterday received two letters
from Filipinos in London touching
upon the proposed action of the
Philippine Islands. The first letter
is from Agoncillo, the Filipino repre
sentative who came to Washington in
behalf of Aguinaldo's interests and
later went to Paris with the hope of in
fluencing the Peace Commission. The
letter follows:
LONDON. December 10. IS9B.
To the Hon. Eugene Haleâ Sir: The
opening of the present session of *ktm
American Senate will put jroa in a posi
tion to influence the just and good un
derstanding between the American and
the FÂ»..pino nations, and 1 beg you to
help me in my efforts to this end. The
free citizens of the United States and
Senators of America cannot follow the
steps of the monarchical countries, whose j
institutions are based on force and op- i
pression, the only form adequate to a |
colony or possession: but they are ex
pected to contribute to the realization in
history of the great principle of submit
ting the government of every country- to
the wish of the inhabitants thereof, un
der the form adopted by your republic.
Freedom, suffrage and independent self
government are the only basis of an or
ganized state in the present times.
Like America, the Philippines will
grow prosperous and happy if. instead of
sowing oppression and militarism and
their inevitable consequences, war and
disorder, the Senate of the United States,
complying with the expectation of my
countrymen and the formal prom
mail-? before the war by all the repre
sentatives 'i the Far East of the Amer
ican admin 'ration, wiil recognize the
independent- of the Philippines and pro
rlnim the cv. .-lasting friendship and al
liance of our two countries. Joined by
their common sentiments, created in the
field of honor, combatting as comrades
for justice and humanity.
Do. I pray, help the Filipinos to obtain
their noble aspirations. I intend r
turn to America at the f : -- â¢ ;nity
and will not fail to personally
the assurances of my respect and high
- leration. I am. sir. yo-ur most
obedient servant.
FELIPE AGOXCILLO.
The second of these letters reads as
follows:
LONDON. Dec. 13. IS9B.
Senator Eugene Hale, Washington. D.
j C. â Sir: We have addressed to George F.
Hoar, United States Senator of the State
: of Massachusetts, the following cable:
"Filipinos everywhere congratulate and
I thank you. Hale and Test for noble efforts
against military rule, colonial expansion.
We want American alliance, citizenship,
â  not subjugation; pray you oppose military
occupation.
"PHILIPPINE COMMITTEE.
"London."
We beg to confirm the foregoing request
â  and pray you to complete your noble
, task by opposing military occupation' of
! the islands by the American army. Gen
' eral Aguinaldo has established in the
; Philippines a regular and orderly civil and
; military administration and everybody
â  there approves of and obeys his com
. mands and those of his authorities: Life,
; property and the legitimate rights of all
are respected. Order prevails everywhere
under his government.
The American officers, military and
naval, in Manila and Cavite maintain a
regular connection, such as is required
by the comity of nations, with the recog
nized authorities. Why disturb these
peaceful conditions by the enforcement
of an American military occupation? We
are, sir, your most obedient servants.

LA GRIPPE NOW
VERY PREVALENT
Mr and Mrs. Loud
Among Its Victims.
MANY SICK AT WASHINGTON
ASPHALT PAVEMENTS SAID TO
HAVE CAUSED THE DISEASE.
Physicians, However. Differ, but the
Fact Bemains That the Num
ber Afflicted Increases
Throughout the East.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office. Rigrsrs House. ;
Washing-ton, Dec. 23.
Mr. and Mrs. Loud are very sick.
Both were attacked with grip. Mrs.
Loud's condition is serious. A trained
nurse is in constant attendance. The
attending physician Â«ays there is no
cause for alarm, and that all they re- j
quire is careful nursing.
The grip is very prevalent in Wash- '
Ington at present. School attendance :
is reduced 33 per cent. As a rule, how- ;
ever, the attacks are mild.
New York reports that the malady \
there thrives in the best 'sections of the :
city, but the poorer sections are nracti- i
cally immune. This agrees with the'
theory of some Washington physicians
that the grip is of recent orisrin and ;
was not prevalent before the laying of
asphalt pavements. The theory is that !
in summer asphalt pavement pores ex- !
pand and receive filth, and that in j
winter the pores contract and exoel
the poisonous matter, which is carried
about by the air. It is pointed out
that a large percentage of policemen,
street sweepers, motormen and drivers
are affected with the grip. But doctors
who disagree with the asphalt pave
ment theory say those men are natur
ally affected most who live most in the
open air. A dense fog has hung ore?
Washington for the past Tveek. and the
doctors attribute the epidemic to this
fact, for this weather ajso prevails in
Xew York and in Philadelphia, where
the grip is prevalent.

WASHINGTON. Dec. 23.â Major Hop
kins, military aid to Secretary Alger, re
turned from "Washington to-day from
Cuba. He was sent by the Secretary from
Savannah to Havana on tWT* transport
Mobile, which made her first trip since
being refitted, with a vjew to reporting
personally to the Secretary upon the
adequacy of tnis type of transport for
army service. Major Hopkins b^
the Mobile Is worthy to form the nucleus
of a first-class army transport. It is not
definitely decided that the Mobile will be
sent to Manila, as was originally pro
posed, for there is a demand just now for
her service in supplying the remaining
troops needed to garrison Cuba.

SAN DIEGO. Dec. 23.â The Coroner's In
quest over the remains of Mrs. A. B. Cole,
whose charred body was found In her

or was murdered and her body placed in
the burned building. Witnesses testified
to frequent quarrels between Mr. and Mrs.
Cole. Cole Is still in custody on the arson
charge.

IN AID OF THE
NICARAGUA CANAL
Amendment of the Clay
ton-Bui wer Treaty.
EARLY ACTION NOW SOUGHT
RECIPROCITY MAY FIGURE IN
AGREEMENT.
By Giving Up Rights to the Water
way England Likely to Secure
Concessions for
Canada.
! Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Deo. 23.â The State
rtment originally did not coiatem
plate a forma] op ning of negotiations to
ppoure the desired amendment oÂ£ the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty until Congress
)';ti! mad< some progress at lea:3t to
ward the â¢ nactment of the Nicaraguan
: bill, the department wishing not
t" be placed in the fair position of ne
potiating for an object which Congress
might, before th>' conclusion, deem to
b( undesirable. After the experience
had with the general arbitration treaty
tnere is a particularly strong disinclina
tion to be again placed in this attitude.
However, now that the matter has
brought Into such prominence the
ns may be opened at an
earlier date than was ori.srfnally con
templated, though it may be taken for
granted that their initiation will be an
evidence of the President's conviction
that Congress will pass some acceptable
canal bill befc-iv adjourning.
Although the gain to English com
raerce that may be fairly expected to
result from the construction of the
canal by the American Government
will make the waterway as important
to Great Britain as it is to the United
States there is still evidence going to
?hn\v that the British Government may
seize upon thr> opportunity to ask for
a quid pro quo. It is hard to perceive
just now what shape this will take, but
it is suggesu-d with considerable plaus
ibility that this may afford the key to
the solution of the reciprocity problem,
which has so greatly embarrassed the
Canadian Joint High Commission. In
ether words, in consideration of the re
linquishment of her rights in the Nica
ragua canal England may ask for
Canada a much more liberal reciprocity
uld X' arranged under
existing circumstances.
PRELIMINARY REPORT
HAS BEEN COMPLETED
Tigures of the Walker Commission
on the Enormous Amount of
Work Required.
NEW YORK, Dec. 23.â The t>re
liminary report of the Nicaragua Canal
Commission, consisting .of General
Haynes, Admiral Walker and Professor
Haupt, has been completed and will be
read before the Senate committee
either during the Christmas recess of
Congress or immediately afterward.
This report will give many details of
â¢ruction in regard to the proposed
route and also a close figure on the en
tire cost of the undertaking as far as
human ingenuity can foresee.
A summary of these costs has been
made out in sections, and, without go
ing into the details of curves and
]Â» j vÂ»-ls, thf-y are as follows: The eastern
harbor and jetties will require about
,000 cubic yards of soft excavation.
The jetties themselves require about
400,000 cubic yards of riprap stone.
The Greytown section of the canal,
which is the section beginning at the
harbor and reaching to the east divide.
will require 16,000,000 cubic yards of
earth and clay excavations. The three
locks in this section will cost in the
neighborhood of ten million dollars
complete, with three millions for ex
cavation. This section is about thir
teen and a half miles in length and
runs through the jungle country near
the coast. There will be 700 acres of
ing and grubbing also in this sec
tion. The incidental expenses will
amoflnt to little besides those above
Â» numerated; therefore they are
omitted.
The divide section reaches from here
through the higher range of hills to
twenty-four miles furtner. There are
seven and a hall' million cubic yards of
rock in this cut and about five million
yards of earth and clay. The depth of
this cut will be mitigated by the height
of the canal, which is here 112 feet
above the sea. The actual cutting will
>out 200 feet in the deepest cart.
From here begins the Ochoa section
which runs through the San Francisco
basin and Florida lagoon. This is low
country, and the cutting, which will
b to the Ochoa dam. thirty-four
ani a half miles from the Caribbean
will only add 10.000,000 yards to the
figures, making a trifle over 40.000.000
cubic yards to the dam.
From here a summary of the cut
through the San Juan River will ag
gregate 34,000,000 cubic yards with
about 000,000 more for curve widening
and 2000 acres clearing and grubbing'
This will not include any of the dams

FITTING CLOSE OF THE
CAREER OF GHANI BEY
The Cutthroat Aid of Turkey's Sul-
tan Killed by Hafuz Pasha
During a Quarrel.
CONSTANTINOPLE. Dec. 23. â Ghani
Bey the Sultan's aid de camp, was
murdered yesterday by Hafuz Pasha !n
a quarrel which took place in a pastry
cook's. Ghani Bey became notorious ow
ing to his lawless proceedings in Epirus.
He also inspired terror here by extort
ing money under threats of death. The
officials of the foreign embassy have fre
quently demanded the punishment of
Ghani Bey, but always unsuccessfully.
Hafuz Pasha escaped and is still at
large. The official press bureau prohibits
any mention of the matter in the news
papers. It appears, however, that Hafuz
Pasha after a slight altercation, placed
the muzzle of his revolver close to the
the head of Ghani Bey and tired. Ghani
Bey died after a few hours of suffering.
Ghani won the Sultan's favor and pro
motion by committing numerous crimes
He was sent to restore order in Epirus
after the Greco-Turkish war. At the
head of 300 lawless companions he robbed,
pillaged and murdered by the wholesale
until he was summoned home, only to be
promoted to a colonelcy. Then he con
tinued his iniquities here. He would enter
a shop, draw a revolver and compel its
owner to open his safe and give up its
contents.
MISSING SCHOONER
RETURNS TO PORT
Blown a Thousand Miles Out of Its
Course by an Atlantic
Gale.
1 PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 23.â The missing
i four-masted Philadelphia schooner Matil
da D. Borda, Captain Norton, which sailed
from Portsmouth, N. H., November 25 for
this port, the day before the terrific gale
which caused such sacriflece of life and
1 property along the coast, and which was
blown over 1000 miles out of her course,
arrived here to-night in tow of the tug
Asa Hughes. The home-coming of the
crew of this vessel, which had for some
time been given up as lost, was one that
will be long remembered by their rela
tive, who have passed through weeks of
great anxiety.
The experience of Captain Norton and
his men was a thrilling one as the vessel
scudded off shore before the terrific gale,
with seas leaping high over her. She was
provisioned for only a short run, and for
days the men have been subsisting on re
! duced rations. The British steamship
Trinidad supplied them with some food, i
', otherwise it is not unlikely they would
have perished from hunger. Captain Nor
. ton upon learning of the fearful havoc j
wrought by the storm said that their safe I
arrival was due to the interposition of
: providence.
REPUDIATES AN INTERVIEW.
Marion de Vries Did Not Speak in
Favor of Expansion.
STOCKTON, Deo. 23.â Congressman
Marion de Vries, in a letter to the Mail

"It was a plain, straightforward state

said. "1 am against the acquisition of
territory remote from our own shores,
but I have repeatedly said that I hold the
opinion that, while a Senator or Repre

HYPNOTISM USED
TO END A TRANCE
Milwaukee Young Woman Awak

Months.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Dec. 23.â Tony Brospeit, a woman 23 years
of age, who has been in a trance for the past five months at her hÂ«Â»me
In this city, was brought to her normal condition through the In
fluence of hypnotism.
Miss Brospeit retired as usual in her apartments on the 23d of
July last. On the following morning, when it was time to awaken,
she kept on sleeping, and though at times she vvould open her eyes,
she seemed unconscious of her surroundings. At last an application
of "suggestive therapeutics," a form of hypnotism, was tried and
the patient to-day was brought out of her long trance. Though very
weak, she was able to say a few words to those around her. She
has been kept alive with liquid food.

Uncle Sam Needs the Little Rock in

a Cable Sta
tion.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.â The Gov
ernment has determined to hoist th&
flag over an island far out in the Pacific
Ocean, and orders were sent out late
this afternoon to the commander of the
Bennington, Captain Tassig, to proceed
at once to take possession in the name
of the United States Government of
Wake Island, lying in latitude 19 north,
longitude 166 east. It is distant about
2000 miles from Nihau, the westernmost
of the Hawaiian Islands, and 1300 miles
east from Guam. It is almost in a di
rect line between these possessions of
the United States and is admirably
adapted for use as a station for a Pa
cific cable to connect the Philippines
with Hawaii and the United States. It
is about three miles in length and en
closes a lagoon of salt water. The
average height of the island is eight
feet above high tide. It is scarcely
capable in itself of sustaining life, but it
is expected that a cable station can be
maintained without difficulty by the
erection of a condenser to supply fresh
water.
Some station in this locality is deemed
to be absolutely necessary to the main
tenance of a cable and for that reason
the American Peace Commissioners at
Paris endeavored to secure one of the
Caroline Islands, but without success,
v.ake Island is said to be by right al
ready American territory, for in 1851
Admiral Wilkes surveyed the place and
asserted tit|Â£. It is not inhabited so
far as known at the present time,
though in the past some guano gather
ers have temporarily lived on the is
land.
The Bennington is now at Honolulu,
and the orders to her will go nut by
steamer. * After hoisting the flag on
Wake Island she will proceed to Guam
and make the survey of the island,
which was expected some time ago. She
has already completed a survey of
Pearl harbor, seven miles from Hono
lulu, which will form the foundation of
the Government plans for the enlarge
ment of the harbor there and the
straightening of the channel connecting
the Inner harbor with the ocean.

FRENCH CLAIMS
TO BE RESISTED
Objection to Extension
at Shanghai.
AMERICAN RIGHTS INVOLVED
ENGLAND FOLLOWS THE LEAD
OF UNCLE SAM.
This Government Particularly Inter
ested in Maintaining Open Mar
kets for Our Goods in
China.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.â 50 far as
can be learned here the conflicting
claims between the French Government
and the United States Government at
Shanghai, China, do not involve any
broad question relating to the acquisi
tion of large tracts of China by France.
Complaint was made to this Govern
ment that the French representatives
in China, under guise of extending the
limits of their extra territorial conces
sion in Shanghai, had included in the
claim certain property, valued mainly
for riparian uses, which had long been
occupied or enjoyed by American citi
zens and American corporations. Upon
this statement United States Minister
Conger was instructed to protest to the
Chinese Government against any action
on its part which would result in In
jury to the American citizens above
described.
It is gathered from the Shanghai dis
patches that the British Government
has taken a similar course. But beyond
that there has been no joint action be
tween the two governments.
It may be stated as to the broader
question of territorial extension in
China, that without entering into any
formal compact with Great Britain on
this subject our Government is deeply
interested in maintaining the integrity
of China, and as England's policy seems
to lie in the same direction, she will
thus receive the moral influence of our
attitude, which may be as effective as>
formal joint action. The particular in
terest of our Government in this mat
ter is to maintain the open market for
American goods in China.

CITY FATHERS OF
FRESNO ACCUSED
Malfeasance in Office
Charged.
GRAND JURY ON THE WARPATH
RETURNS ANOTHER BATCH OF
ACCUSATIONS.
Board of Trustees Alleged to Have
Expended Public Funds With
out Having Called for
Bids.
â¦
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Dec. 23.â The Grand Jury
is after public officials with a venge
ance. The public hardly had time to
talk about the sensation of yester-
day, when the accusations were found
against the Supervisors, before an-
other sensation was sprung. This even
ing similar accusations were presented
against the entire Board of City Trus
tees, charging it with failure to live
up to the strict letter of the law in the
transaction of public affairs. The ac
cusations against the board were filed
by District Attorney S*iow in the
County Clerk's office and conies of the
documents were placed in the hands of
the Sheriff for service upon the city
fathers. To-morrow each member will
receive formal notification to appear
within twelve days and answer to the
presentment.
The specific charge against the Trus
tees is that they expended an amount
in excess of $100 without first calling
for bids. The expenditure was incurred
in repairing the engine-house across
the track, which was built at the in
stance of Trustee Joe Spinney uver a
year ago, and which is said to be one
of the finest houses of its kind in the
State, $10,000 having been spent in its
construction. It is out of all proportion
to the needs of that part of town.
But it is not in reference to its con
struction that the Grand Jury has
brought the accusation, but to the re
pairs made subsequently. It is alleged
that on March 31 of this year the Trus
tees, acting in their official capacity,
"willfully, unlawfully and corruptly
expended out of the public funds be
longing to the ci^y the sum of $1795 25,"
and "willfully, unlawfully and cor
ruptly failed and neglected to publish
any notice for bids, as required by
law."
As in the case of the Supervisors, the
Trustees have twelve days in which to
appear in court and answer to the ac
cusation. Should they fail to appear
the charge will be heard in their ab
sence. The purpose of the action of
the Grand Jury is to remove them from
office for failure to comply with the
law. It is hinted that during the trial
sensational matters will come to light
in connection with the construction of
the $10,000 engine house in Spinney's
ward.
The Trustees accused of corrupt mis
conduct are: C. J. Craycroft, chair
man; W. F. McVey, Joseph Spinney, E.
L. Austin and P. M. Chittenden. Spin
ney, who can neither read nor write,
is commonly known as the "boss of thÂ»
board." He is also the "boss" of the
Fifth Ward, and has been running
things with a high hand. He was de
feated for Supervisor at the last elec
tion. McVey ran for Constable and
was defeated at the recent election.
Craycroft is a contractor and bulider.
McVey was until recently in the furni
ture business, and Chittenden is in the
insurance business.
After having returned the accusations
the Grand Jury adjourned for three
weeks.

YALE DIVINITY STUDENT
A PURLOINER OF BOOKS
Thousands of Volumes Found by Police
in Rev. James Brittain Miller's
Rooms.
NEW YORK, Dec. 23.â A New Haven (Conn.) special to the Herald
says: Yale University and the city of New Haven are talking of
scarcely anything except the case of Rev. James Brittain Miller, a
graduate of Divinity School, who was arrested yesterday charged
with theft and in whose rooms in West Divinity Hall upward of
5000 volumes believed to have been stolen from book stores in this
city were found by the police.
Fears are now expressed that the university library itself may
have suffered by Mr. Miller's depredations. In university circles,
among which the accused clergyman has many friends, not a little
sympathy is expressed for him and there is a strong disinclination
to regard his guilt as proved. Several hundreds of the volumes
found in his room, however, have been positively Identified as hav
ing been stolen frdm leading book stores in Chapel and Church
streets.
His case has been compared to that of Eugene Aram, but while
the crimes of Bulwer's hero were inspired by lofty motives, Mr. Mil
ler's oerations appear to have been conceived and carried out in a
purely commercial spirit. All the evidence so far appears to show
that for several years Miller, protected against suspicion by the fact
that he was a well-known divinity student, has systematically stolen
books wherever he could most safely do so, solely for the purpose of
selling them. He is known to have done a large business in the sell
ing of books to fellow students, and it is now fully established that
long lines of books stolen from certain stores have been found in other
stores not a stone's throw away, in which they had been left by Mil
ler to be sold for his account on commission.

Just before noon the American and
Spanish Commissioners, General Cas

and the American ranking officer in
Cuba, Major General John R. Brooke,
if he arrives in time, and otherwise
Major General Lee will assemble at the
palace.
The Spanish Commissioners will then
surrender the Government to the
United States Commissioners, who will
immediately transfer it to the Ameri
can general commanding. After this
the various functionaries will remain
a while to receive those who may wish
to pay their respects to the incoming
authorities.
It was agreed at the joint meeting
that the Spanish troops remaining in
Cuba after January 1 should be con
sidered in the light of foreign troops in
a friendly country, and to be accorded
the privileges usually granted under in
ternational law. The quarters, build
ings and grounds occupied by them are
to be covered by the immunities of ex
tra territoriality. and further stitpula
tions were entered into respecting the
prevention of any disturbance of public
order consequent upon their presence.
Matanzas and Cienfuegos will doubt
less be the only places where Spanish
troops will remain after January 1, and
Cienfuegos will be evacuated first.
The Spanish sick in the hospitals will
remain under the safeguard of the
American flag, the Spanish authorities
providing medicines, attendance and
food, repatriating them on recovery.
Generals Wade, Butler and Clous, ac
companied by their aids, were received
at the palace to-day with full military
honors. The Spanish trumpeters blew
a flare and the police guards saluted.
The same ceremonies marked the re

COLD DAY FOR JOB-CHASERS
GOVERNOR GAGE'S ARRIVAL
CREATES A STIR.
Headquarters at the Palace Deserted
by All Save the Army of
Moth-Eaten Place-
Hunters.
The near approach of the Christmas
holidays has hail a very depressing effect
on the aspect of things around political
headquarters at the Palace Hotel. Legis
lators and their friends from the interior
who have been in the city during u.e
past few weeks for the purpose of "Ret
ting next to themselves," as they ex
pressed it, have returned to their homes
t.-> spend Christmas with their families
or friends, leaving the Palace court and
the rooms of the Republican State Central
Committee in the- undisturbed possession
of local Job-chasers and the political touts
who are numbered among the camp-fol
lowers and personal advisors of Colonel
Burns.
The job-chasers, of which there are not
a few, were visibly stirred yesterday when
It was announced that Governor-elect
Gage would arrive in the city by the even
ing train from Sacramento In order to bÂ«
present at the reception tendered Lieu
tenant Hobson last night. To-day will see
a full attendance of the needy gentle
men who are willing to serve the State
In any capacity where there is good pay
and no work. It stands them in hand to
be in evidence around the Palace court,
co as to be in a p sition at any time of
the night or day to bow to the Governor
elect should he happen to pass. Another
and very important consideration is the
cheerful grate fire in the general office
of the committee rooms upstairs. There
Is a decided chill in the atmosphere at
this time of the year, and the chronic
place-hunter is not always provided with
an overcoat, a condition that may be at
tributable to the fact that this is tne
close of a Democratic administration.
Four years of enforced idleness is enough
to strfp the overcoat from the backs of all
but those who make politics a "fad" an
not an occupation.
To-day the job chasers will appear in
the courtyard and in the committee
- with the bottoms of their trousers
â  sheared, the cracks in their
it artistically inked, a pocketful of
c iron washers and an air of pros
perlty assumed in the fond hope that the
:...r-tlect may be led to believe that
are guests at the hotel and that
their sole object in wishing to give up
their luxurious quarters, and go to Sac
ramento is a desire to serve him.

SUES HER BROTHER.
Miss Gashwiler Alleges That He
Deceived Her.
Litigation, the result of alleged fraud,
has divided the Gashwiler family. Suit
Was filed yesterday by Charlotte L. Gash
wiler against her half-brother, Jared H.
Irwln, to set aside a deed to valuable real
estate on Kearny street, near Pine. The
plaintiff alleges that in November of last
year she requested her brother to prepare
a deed to the property in question that
Ehe might convey it to her mother, Mrs.
I* M. Gashwiler. Irwin stated that he
would do so, and on November IS, 1897,
Informed her that the deed was ready for
her signature. They went before a
notary and without reading the document.
Miss Gashwiler alleges, she signed it.
Subsequently she discovered that instead
of conveying the property to her mother
the de-r-d conveyed one-third to Irwin and
one-third to plaintiffs sister, Mrs. Samuel
M. Shortrldge.
Plaintiff states that she went to Mrs.
Phortri<!jr<i as soon as she discovered the
deception, and Mrs. Shortridge was ignor
ant of the transaction and immediately
signed a quitclaim deed. Now Miss Gash
wlUt seeks to set aside the deed on the
ground of fraud, that she may convey the
property to her mother, as she originally
intended.
GEORGE E. BARRON'S ESTATE.
Letters of Administration Upon It
Asked by T. J. Roche.
Theodore J. Roche, one of the many
creditors of the late George E. Barron,
las applied for letters- of administration
cpon the estate of the deceased- Peti
tioner states that he has no Information ;
â s to the character anÂ«3"v^r-s âC life Â«-Â»-Â»
*ate; neither does he know the names of
the next of kin of the decease^.
George E. Barron came into prominence
several years ago through a contest of his
father's will in the courts of San Jose.
A negress appeared on the. scene with a
boy she alleged was the son of herself
and George E. Barron's father. The dis
grace following this expose and trouble
and litigation drove young Barron into
evil ways and his death, which occurred
in this city on October 21. is said to have
been caused by dissipation. When Bar
ron died he was attended by a woman
whom rumor said was his wife, but as she
has not appeared to claim his estate the
reports were probably unfounded.
FOBBED AN OLD MAN.
A. McKenzie Relieved 01 His Jewelry
and All His Loose Money.
Mrs. Morrissey, 326 Minna street, short
ly after C o'clock yesterday morning: saw
a man robbing an old man opposite her
house. A few minutes later Policeman
T| 1 1 man was passing her house after re
porting off duty and she told him or what
she had seen. She described the robber
as short and stout, with a full beard,
r-ii' 1 n ho ut 30 years of age.
The old man was lying on the steps of
the house, "27 Minna street, with his
pockets turned inside out. He was con
siderably under the influence of liquor,
and Tillman took him to the City Prison.
He pave his name as A. McKay and
claimed that he had been robbed. Till
man went back to Minna street and found
the old man's gold rimmed spectacles and
falso u-eth about forty feet from where
he had bpen robbed. They were taken to
the prison.
Whon the old man sobered up a little
he said his name was A McKenzie and
that he had been a resident of this city
for over thirty years. He used to keep
a saloon on Market street, opposite the
Palace Hotel, and one on Pine
street, opposite the market. For a
few years he has been traveling
around selling spectacles. He lives on
Fourth street, nt-ar Mission, and Thurs
day night started out with $10 to have a
good time. The last thing he remem
bered was being in the Abbotsford saloon,
where he had several glasses of whisky.
H<> had a vague recollection of a man
with a beard, who knew his name. He
had been robbed of a cheap watch, a
gold chain and diamond locket, a diamond
stud, a diamond ring, a gold ring with a
bloodstone and any loose change he may
have had in his pockets. He had a check
in his purse for $1250. and reluctantly con
fessed that he was fond of poker and
kept for a blind.
Inquiry at the Abbotsford saloon elicited
the fact that a gentleman escorted him
home at the request of the proprietor, but
on reaching Fourth street, below Mis
sion. McKenzie Insisted on going into a
saloon and playing cards with a soldier
and some others. The gentleman left
him there. The police are working on
the case.
HIS GAS WAS SHUT OFF.
Refusal to Put Up a Deposit Causes
Trouble.
A. Daw-Kerrell, a resident of this city,
complains bitterly of the treatment which
he has received from the Pan Francisco
Gaslight Company. Yesterday afternoon
at A o'clock his gas was shut off oy an
employe of the concern, which gave no
notice of its intention to resort to the
arbitrary proceeding. The consequence
was that Mr. Kerrell's home was left In
darkness for the night, and his wife, who
is an invalid, suffered greatly from the
cold, as the only way they have of heat
ing the house is by means of gas.
Mr. Kerrell Is of the opinion that the
I corporation Is pursuing retaliatory tactics
i against him for his refusal to put up the
I $5 deposit which it exacts illegally from
Its consumers.
"The trouble." he said, "dates back
some eleven years, when I refused to com
| ply with the demand to deposit the $5. In
that time I moved four timos, and always
1 had trouble in that regard, but I never
; made the deposit, and I presume the com
; pany has had it in for me ever since. I
always paid my bills promptly and !n
i March last I contracted for a yas stove,
which the company loans to subscribers.
( ';: that 1 cheerfully paid a $3 deposit as
security, as I considered it a just charge.
; It cost me $20 to have the connections
i made. I found, however, that the pres
sure was poor, for when the Etove was
! lighted the Kas jets burned very feebly, so
: two weeks ago I sent word to ha.\e it re
: moved, and paid $4 to aisconnect it. My
â¢ son went to the office to ask for the re
turn of the $5 deposit on the stove, but
; was met with scant courtesy.
" 'Have you a deposit on your meter?"
Ihe was asked. Replying in the negative,
i he was coolly informed that the Jo on the
I stove would now be applied as a deposit
lon the meter. In addition he. was c<jn
1 fronted with a bill of $7 80 to cover the
â  amount of gas burned in November and
! fourteen days in December. Believing this
to be extortionate my son refused to pay.
and the summary action of shutting the
gas oft followed. This charge of $7 SO was
I the result of my being honest with tne
I corporation and notifying it last month
that I was of the opinion that the m^ter
; did not register properly, as I was posi
tive that we had burned more than ?2
worth of gas in October, which was their
bill for that month. I consider they have
acted in a high-handed and dishonorable
way, and I think I have cause to bring ac
; tion for damages. I will get the advice
1 of an attorney and took the first step yes
i terday to serve the company with a. no
i tice to turn on the gas forthwith. This is
a matter that concerns every user of -is
i in this city and something should be done
I to correct the tactics of the San Francis.'D
Gas Company, which, to say the least, are
peculiar." ______^_____
ACTOR MONTAINE'S
TWO CHARACTERS
HIS WIFE WILL SUE FOR A
DIVORCE.
A Dual Role on the Alcazar Soards
and Tragedy on the Domestic
Hearth.
Clarence F. Montaine this week at the
Alcazar is a funny German with stage
regulation Saxon tow hair and a litt.e
whisker on his chin. He says funny Ger
man things and laughs with his audience
at himself. But C. F. Montaine off the
stage is not saying funny things and
laughing just now. Then he is playing
best man to Mrs. C. F. Montaine in a lit
tle drama of her own, though in her set
tled opinion he is the worst man in the
world almost. In fact so bad is he that
she is consulting her lawyer in view of
getting a divorce on the grounds of cru
elty. Her lines in this play are that he Is
the usual unfeeling wretch of a husband,
111 treats her a little short of battery,
goes to drink with startling frequency,
insults her bosom lady friends and dis
courager her aspiration to develop into a
tragedienne.
In an interview the man of two roles
said, as he was making-up for his stage
part, that his wife was an unspeakable
lover of intoxicants, with a most vicious
temper, a lurid Imagination and a mighty
confidence in her latent theatrical abili
ties.
"Her tongue ie a scorcher," he said,
stopping to stick the funny whiskers on
his chin, "and ever s'nee our marriage in
Chicago, about a year ago, she has sub
jected me to almost unceasing abuse. She
has even gone so far as to slap me in
the face. I have had to get out of her
way to keep her from scratching my
f-vfs out. Oh, she Is a Tartar from Tar
tarville. Her love of war with me is al
most equal to her love of cocktails with
her lady friends, and when she ~ets im
bued with the spirit of both I just make
myself scan c. When she is mad through
and through she is so impulsive that she
will stop at nothing. Yesterday evening
after a tremendous flare-up she rushed
oft to her attorney. Judge Mogan, and be
gan proceedings for a divorce. But she
is nice when not stirred up; in fact she Is
like the little girl who 'when she Is good
is very, very good, and when she is bad
she is horrid.'
Mrs. Montaine is a handsome woman
about 30 years of age, and was a Mrs.
Pauline Davidson when she married itaon
taine in Chicago less than a year ago
while he was playing a leading part in
Nat Goodwin's company. She has ap
peared In minor roles .several times on
the stape. hut not with shining success.
She denies all her husbands allegations.
Montaine has consulted Hon. Julius Kahn
and will fight the case.

THE SA:N FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 24, 1898.
SLOAN'S STOMACH
IS OUT OF ORDER
HTS GRACE JAMES TOD SLOAN, Duke of Saddledom, Intimate of $
His Highness the Prince of Wales, and premier jockey of the Amer- }
lean turf, will arrive at the Palace in about ten days. This is the an- }
nouncement that Charley Quinn, herald for his grace, tipped off to i
the knowing ones last night. The news brought a smile to the haggard )
countenances of that swell set, better known as the talent, who for the <i
past ten days have been up against the books with somewhat disastrous }
results. The exact day when "Our Tod," as Quinn puts it. will arrive is )
not known, but from a letter received he will be here inside of ten days )
if he does not change his little mind. )
At present Sloan is at West Baden Springs, Indiana, drinking sulphur j
water. It is reported that his dear little stomach has been upset by the )
various brands. that he and the Prince of Wales were accustomed to drink }
together, and the immaculate midget wants to be in condition when he <l
arrives here. Charley Dwyer is at the springs with Tod, and will accom- )
pany him here. The talent hopes for the sure thing and the dead cinch ]
when J. Tod Sloan arrives. He will also bring with" him the latest '*
wrinkles from "dear old London"â that is. in the line of neckwear and i
clothes. This season It is ties that Tod will flash, and he has something *
like five hundred of the most startling patterns. He also brings thirty- )
seven dozen pairs of trousers and a chest full of imported cigars of the }
largest and blackest brandâ the kind that Sir Henry Irving and Lord Sal- ]
isbury smoke. ]
His Grace will have a suite at the Palace and will establish his court \
on his arrival, and the exacting etiquette of St. James will be rigidly en- \
forced. This season, owing to J. Tod Sloan's intimacy with the Prince \
of Wales, no one will address him until they have first been spoken to, ]
and it is positively stated on the very best authority that under no cir- <i
cumstances will Sloan accept a mount that has not a pedigree emanat- \
ing from the other side, "don't cher know." \
TREASURER REIS
IS TO MAKE A
SETTLEMENT
Surprised This City Is
Involved.
THAT STATE TAX MUDDLE
MAYOR PHELAN'S EXTRAORDI
NARY BUSINESS LAXITY.
Sacramento Pays Over â Colgan's
Firm Position â Aggressive Law
yers Now Proposing Stip
ulations.
Many taxpayers of San Francisco were
surprised yesterday when they read that
; the Board of Supervisors of this city had
j entered into a contract with Attorneys
j Rodgers, Paterson & Slack and Devlin &
I Devlin to pay these lawyers a large per
i centage to collect certain moneys which
! it is claimed have been overpaid in the
j collection of State taxes. No one was
; more surprised than Treasurer Christian
Reis. He was amazed to learn that the
I Supervisors had adopted a resolution to
pay lawyers a large commission for col
! lecting money from the State.
"It is a plain proposition," remarked Mr.
Reis, "that if the city collects any money
from the State, a tax on the city will be
levied by the State to restore the money.
The Mayor and the Supervisors ought to
j have known that the whole proceeding
j was designed to give fees to lawyers. No
matter how the litigation ends the ciiy
will be compelled to pay. Should, an
' amount equal to the commissions said to
be due San Francisco be collected from
the State the tax to restore it will fall
heavier on San Francisco than on other
| counties, and besides the city will be loser
1 in the amount allowed to the lawyers. I
: am surprised that a plain business propo
sition of this kind was not understood by
i the Mayor and Supervisors."
The contract between the lawyers and
'< the city and county of San Francisco was
obtained last August, -as the following
copy of the resolution will show:
1 RESOLUTION No. 1552 (Fourth Series).â
Resolved, That Arthur Rodger*. Van R. Pater
son and Charles W. Slack, composing; the firm
of Rodgers, Paterson & Slack, attorneys at law,
and Robert T. Devlin and William H. Devlin,
composing the firm of Devlin & Devlin, attor
i neys at law, ' .Â«_Â«â¢.

I Board of Supervisors of the City and County

I are hereby authorized, empowered and ap
. pointed to "examine into any claim that may be
due owing or unpaid to the said city and
: county and any of its officers or either from
i the State of California, in connection with cer
i tain moneys which it is claimed have been
overpaid in the settlements between them aris
i Ing from the collection of State taxes and reve-
n ue and the disbursement of public money, and
i also in connection with such State taxes and
; revenue and services rendered pertaining to
j the same and to develop the facts in connec

I and to collect by suit or otherwise the said

I That the said city and county shall be at no

Messrs. Devlin & Devlin above named.
! That the above-named attorneys so employed

force until the said claim has been fully col

Judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of
California; and the said attorneys shall also be
j entitled to the same percentage on all sums
I that may hereafter accrue on the said claim
I (luring the term of Raid employment; provided,
; that the said employment shall not continue for
a longer period than two years, unless the said
claim shall be in litigation, and in such an
event it shall continue until the said litigation
shall be finally ended.

.INO. A. RUSSELL, Clerk.
Treasurer Reis of this city announces
his purpose to make a speedy settlement
with the State Controller if he is not re
strained by the lawyers employed by the
Board of "Supervisors. Speaking on this
topic yesterday, he said: "I expect to
make the settlement in a few days. , I am
waiting now on the Tax Collector. No
papers to prevent me making the â  cus
! tomary settlement have been served upon
j me, and I do not hear that any steps to
; restrain me are. in contemplation. . The
! amount to be paid over to the State will
i approximate $1,100,000. but $400,000 may be
| retained under apportionment of school
] money."
It seems that Mayor Phelan did not sign
the resolution of the Board of Supervis
ors, but it became valid with his consent,
as he did not interpose official objection.
It does not appear on the record that any
one in the City Hall sought the advice of
the City and County Attorney on this im
portant contract. Comment on the
Mayor's inefficiency is varied and pointed.
The Mayor is said to be exceptionally
gifted with qualities required- for opening
a woman's congress or receiving a hero
like Hobson, but is so lamentably de
ficient in ordinary business sense that, he
ought to have a guardian. Obviously it
never entered his mind that the lawyers
had an ax to grind when they sought his
support in obtaining: , tho contract. Mr.
Devlin, a smooth talker from Sacramento,
found the Mayor a "good thing" and
worked him accordingly.
THE CONTROLLER'S POSITION.
Ten Counties Have Made Settlements
With the State â Sacramento and
Ventura Responded Yesterday.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 23.â With refer
ence to the suits brought against the
State by forty-two counties for back
commissions alleged to be due them State
Controller Colgan said to a Call corre
spondent this afternoon that he would
maintain the position that the counties
must proceed to make their settlements
with the State, as the law requires. Ten
counties have already settled, among
them Solano, Lake, Alpine, Mariposa, Plu
mas, Santa Clara, Ventura and Sacramen
to, the last two having made their set
tlements to-day.
"The attorneys for the counties in this
matter," said Mr. Colgan, "have, as I un
derstand it, advised the counties not to
settle with the Controller, but Devlin &
Devlin, who represent a majority of them,
stated to-day that they were willing to
enter into a stipulation or agreement to
have all the counties they represent set
tle with the Controller provided that their
rights are not jeopardized. Their proposi
tion has been put in writing and submit
ted to Attorney General Fitzgerald, who
represents me in this matter, for his ap
proval or modification.
"Section 3867 of the Political Code pro
vides that unless a County Treasurer set
tles with the State Controller between the
loth and 30th of December he shall pay a
penalty of JIOOO. Of course I shall look
for settlements In the usual manner and
that really sums up my position at pres
ent. My opinion is that there is nothing
in the case which the attorneys have
brought, but I must, of course, await a
judicial determination of the question."
An interesting fact in connection with
the passage of the law in 1893 abolishing
commissions was disclosed upon an ex
amination of the original tally sheet of
the Senate made by Secretary of State
Brown and The Call correspondent this
evening. The printed minutes of the Sen
ate, which are indorsed as correct by the
presiding officer of that body, show that
the measure received but twenty votes
and that it did not receive the vote of
Senator R. H. Campbell, his name not ap
pearing even as present. The original tal
ly sheet, kept in pencil, however, shows
that Campbell was present and that he
was the first man who voted aye. The
totals show that the measure received 21
eyes and 3 noes. The singular fact re
vealed by the examination is that right
next to the figure "1," denoting Camp
bell's vote, is a cipher with a stroke
through it. Whether it was intended to
have any significance or not is not known,
but at any rate it is regarded as worthy
of note in connection with the absence of
Campbell's name from the list of the Sen
ators voting- for the measure as it appears
in the printed minutes. With Campbell's
name out the printed minutes show that
the measure received but twenty votes,
which would not be enough to carry it,
although it is stated in the printed min
utes that the measure passed.
The Hearst Libel Suits.
Judge Mogan had set yesterday for ren
dering his decision in the libel case of
Claus Spreckels against W. R. Hearst of
the Examiner, but announced that he was
not yet ready, and continued the case till
January 10.
The demurrer of TV. R. Hearst to the
complaint of Claus Spreckels for damages
for libel was overruled by Judge Hunt
yesterday. Hearst was given ten days in
which to answer the complaint.
Not Wanted in New York.
Captain Bohen yesterday received a dis
patch from Captain McClusky of New
York In answer to the one sent him on
Thursday that Isldor Lorber was not
wanted there for the murder of his wife
nor for anything else. Lorber was at
once released from the City Prison.
Federal Grand Jury Indictment.
The Federal Grand Jury yesterday re
ported an Indictment against H. W. M.
Ogg of Sacramento County for sending
unlawful drugs through the malls to C. M.
Madsen of Gunnison. Utah, and to Mrs.
S. G. Sartor! of Nashville, El Dorado
County, California. Ball was set at $500.
A Soldier's Escape.
From the Democrat-Message, Mt. Sterling, 111.
When Richmond had fallen and the
great commanders had met beneath the
historic apple tree at Appomattox, the
83d Pennsylvania Volunteers, prematurely
aged, clad in tat-
ters and rags, bro-
ken In body but of
dauntless? spirit,
swung into line for
the last "grand re-
view" and then
quietly marched
away to begin life's

the hills and val-

the number Asa j

manhood; he c;ime
back a ghost of the self that answered
to President Lincoln's call for "300,000
more."
To-day he is an alert, active man and
tolls the story cf his recovery as follows.:
"I was a great sufferer from sciatic
rheumatism almost from the time of my
discharge from the army. Most of the
time I was unfitted for manual labor of
any kind, and my sufferings were at all
times intense. At times I was bent al-
most double, and got around only witu
the greatest difficulty. Nothing seemed
to give me permanent relief until three
years ago, when my attention was calle>l
to some of the wonderful cures effected
by Dr. Williams 1 Pink Pills for Pale Peo-
Ele. I had not taken more than half a
ox when I noticed an improvement in
my condition, and I kept on improving
steadily. I took three boxes of the pills,
and at the end of that time was in better
condition than at any time since the close
of my army service. Since then I have
never been bothered with rheumatism
Dr. Williams" Pink Pills for Pale People
is the only remedy that ever did me any
good, and to them I owe my restoration
to comparative health. They are a grand
-remedy."

MAS MR. PHELON BEEN HEFTING
0G0IN?
CERTAIN shrewd lawyers have made to the
officers of the various counties of California a
proposition to collect from the State a sum due
as a commission on the collection of State taxes. It
is a considerable sum; enough in the aggregate to
embarrass the State treasury- The lawyers are not
working for love, nor with a view to the promotion
of health. In iact, they are trying to dispose of a
gold brick. They ask a percentage, reaching up to a
certain sum, to half the amount collected, and be
yond this they are willing to accept less. This is good
of them. Even if moderately successful, each lawyer
in the lot can retire with a fortune.
It is strange that the authorities cannot see through
a scheme so transparent. It is more than strange
that public business cannot be conducted at least as
adroitly as the individuals guiding it would look after
their own affairs. Imagine Mayor Phelan, for in
stance, permitting a lawyer to direct his private con
cerns and paying him a handsome commission for
taking money from one pocket and putting it in
another.
California is not prepared to meet the claims
threatened to be brought against it. The only way
in which they could be met would be through the
levying of taxes. Any county recovering from the
State would simply have to reimburse the common
wealth, and do it with the knowledge that commis
sions aggregating, as nearly as can be estimated,
$700,000. will pass into the pockets of attorneys, whose
only object in instigating the suits is to get this com
fortable reward. The inevitable result will be that
the counties will be obliged to make good to the
State not only the thousands recovered, but the other
thousands consumed in fees. Thus there will be no
gain, but a distinct loss.
The Mayor of San Francisco is aiding and
abetting the lawyer?. He did not devote to the
proposition the consideration its importance merited.
He merely hefted the chances, and fell into error.
This county is more deeply concerned than any
other. It has more money at stake. Here the law
yers would make their richest haul, and the necessity
of an extra tax would be more heavily felt than in
any other quarter. Nevertheless the Mayor seems
to think that in winning a suit against the State there
would be a triumph. How does he figure it out?
TEARING UP PAVEMENTS.
PLAINT has occasionally been made heretofore
of the passion of corporations for tearing up
pavement. The sight of a good, smooth sur
face produces a peculiar effect upon those who have
the privilege of digging ditches in the thoroughfares.
While a street is covered with cobbles, or presents a
t< p of virgin earth, it docs not constitute a tempta
tion. Let it be graded, given a coat of bituminous
rock, and immediately an army with axes and picks
appears to assault it. It is chopped, stabbed, turned
bottom up, wheeled to one side, where it forms a pile
of debris; it is sundered lengthwise, crosswise,
carved in angles, curve*, unclassified rent?. Then the
debris is. with more or less pretense of care, placed
back, leaving a scar which is never effaced, while the
army, shouldering its weapons, marches away to new
conquests. In time this sort of thing becomes irri
tating.
.Wither is the work done completely at one swoop.
Perchance there is some perfect surface left, and this
is reserved for a second assault. The corporations do
not wish to appear too eager in demolition. They ac
complish their object by stages. Their plan is simi
lar to that of the humane man who, having to ampu
tate the tail of a dog, essayed to avoid cruelty by
cutting off a piece every day.
It is certainly strange that the impulse to lay pipes
comes only after there is a pavement to be marred
and probably to be ruined by the operation. The work
could surely be better done after the paving had been
ordered, done with less expense to the corporations
and less cost and annoyance to the taxpayers, who
really do not buy pavements for the mere sake of
having them destroyed.
The Grand Jury has made bold to suggest that the
nickcl-in-the-slot machine is not a promoter of virtue.
And yet people in their blindness have sometimes
wondered what the Grand Jury is for.
I would seem that the books of the Standard Oil
people just happened to be burned at the time there
was occasion to refer to them. Accidents will occur.
Spain's soldiers might as well have died fighting.
They will die, anyhow, before reaching their native
shores, and no glory.
The very least to be required of the Fuhrig woman
is that she acquire a degree of skill making her less
fatal.
Hobson is deserving of every honor short of

THROUGHOUT the discussion of expansion,
from the annexation of Hawaii to the conquest
of the Philippines, a feeble attempt has been
made to defend that policy on constitutional grounds.
No argument of that kind so far made has appealed
to constitutional lawyers. The late Judge Cooley ex
pressly denied constitutional warrant for colonial ac
quisition. Ex-Senator Edmunds and Senator Hoar
take the same view. Indeed, the constitutional ar
gument is so obviously against taking and holding
these tropical conquests that its advocates are aban
doning that view entirely.
In a speech this week at the banquet of the New
England Society General Merritt said: "We have
outgrown the constitution. It is not worth while to
discus? it." That is a very short statement of a very
great matter. It should be soundly pondered by the
American people. It is the declaration of a soldier
that our Federal constitution is obsolete and beneath
the courtesy of discussion! A year ago no major
general of the United States army, no soldier in uni
form, would have dared make such a declaration. It
is an expression of military contempt for civil gov
ernment. It shows that the same spirit is in most
military men that was in Alaric the Goth, Attila the
Hun, and many leaders of armies from the beginning.
That spirit has been roused by the appointment of
Military Governors for these tropical islands, who are
to rule by the force of a great army backing them.
Our Government was organized so as to subordinate
the military to the civil power. There can be no war
without a declaration by the civil authority, vested in
Congress. The constitution provides that Congress
shall raise and support armies, but shall make no ap
propriation for that purpose longer than a term of
two years, and that Congress shall have the power to
provide a navy and make rules and regulations for the
government of the land and naval forces. Such au
thority in the civil government has always chafed
military commanders, and they have seldom failed to
overthrow it when a state of war gave them the op
portunity.
The advocates of imperialism in Congress have al
ready addressed the country fervidly upon the exten
sion of our institutions and the blessings of our form
of government to the tropical races. But it must not
be forgotten that those institutions and blessings have
their origin in the constitution, and nowhere else.
Withdraw that, and they fall with it. They can no
longer exist at home, nor be extended abroad. Obso
lete the constitution, and every judicial court ceases
to be. Every judicial safeguard of person and prop
erty falls to the ground. All the civil rights enjoyed
by our people cease when their source, the constitu
tion, ceases to be.
Under these circumstances this soldier comes home
after three weeks in Manila to inform us that we have
outgrown the constitution, which no longer merits
discussion! This can only mean that the country has
grown out of its organic and fundamental law, and
that it has cast off its form of civil government like
a worn-out garment. But this major-general does not
suggest that in outgrowing the constitution we have
grown into another form of civil government. Our
old constitution having ceased to deserve respect or
discussion, the titular military Governor General of
the Philippines, the successor of Weyler in those
islands, who informs us of the fact, does not suggest
that we have clothed us in the more abundant gar
ments of another form of civil government. A sol
dier's sword follows and cuts where his word has
gone before. Having uttered the word of disrespect
and contempt for our civil government, he does not
compromise his military position and view by indi
cating that any other form of civil power is installed
in its place. Granting his judgment good as to the
failure and outgrowth of the fundamental law, noth
ing is left but military government by the army, or
civil and social chaos.
At the close of our Revolution there was a great
commander at the head of the Continental army. It
was plastic in his hands, and the country was ready
tc accept what he dictated. There was no constitution
to limit him. no ar hority equal to the task of curb
ing his army or subordinating it to the civil power.
A Continental Congress had made him the head of the
army without limit to his commission. But that com
mander had a conscience and a patriotic spirit, which
supplied the limitations that were externally lacking.
Meeting the Continental Congress in session in the
old Courthouse at Annapolis, a body feeble in power
and authority, that would have dispersed at a wave of
his sword. Washington handed that sword back and
resigned the commission which gave him the right
to bear it.
When Mifflin, the President of that Congress, re
ceived Washington's sword and commission, the civil
power advanced to primacy of "the military power, the
foundation of the constitution was laid, and the in
stitutions of freedom were planted thereon.
In less than six score years from that scene we are
told by a professional soldier that we have no civil
government and freedom no foundation!
THE GRfIND JURY FAILURE
THE adjournment of the Grand Jury without ac
tion upon the School Board scandals is merely
a repetition of the history of this county inquisi
tion during many years past. The failure of justice
again emphasizes anew what has often been said, that
the Grand Jury system is a complete failure. In the
days of its usefulness it is said to have served as a
barrier between tyranny and the people, but as a
modern means of prosecuting crime, investigating
public officials and bringing the guilty ones to justice,
it has fallen into the contempt of all thoughtful
people.
The members of the present Grand Jury say they
have been unable to obtain any conclusive evidence of
crookedness in the Board of Education. Yet it would
seem to the casual observer that if they had merely
followed up the publications in the newspapers they
could not have failed to indict several of the ring.
Grand Juries need not set themselves tip as sticklers
for legal evidence. When they know that crime has
been committed they can exclude the usually luke
warm District Attorney from their presence and find
indictments to fit the case.
It is a fact, however, that grand juries are ordinar
ily made up of politicians, and business men on the
verge of politic?, who respond promptly to the "pull"
of the tax-eating classes. A few virtuous members
upon a Grand Jury cannot swny the majority, who
are interested personally in shielding criminals and
preventing scandal. When the District Attorney is
indifferent or neglectful his office becomes an instru
ment for preventing the indictment of political crim
inals, and so the whole machinery of the law is
thrown into confusion, and the Grand Jury adjourns.
as this one has adjourned, acknowledging itself help
less and impotent.
We do not know whether there is any remedy for
this or not. If the Superior Judges were to name for
a while grand jurors who were outside the politick
influence of the City Hall, and would place upon
every Grand Jury two or three lawyers of courage
and integrity, they would soon find that results would
be forthcoming. The trouble is that grand jurors un
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 24, 1893.
learned in the law are unable to frame indictments
without assistance and the District Attorney will not
had them.
A Grand Jury or two constituted as we have sug
gested would make things exceedingly sultry at the
City Hall instead of generally making a poor quality
of politics. Why do not the Judges try the experi
ment ?
THE EXTORTIONS OF EXPRESS
COMPANIES.
A MOVEMENT has been started by the Mer
chants' Association of New York to procure
some form of regulation of express companies
to put an end to the extortions they now practice
upon the public. The promoters of the movement are
vigorous men and are making an active campaign for
the proposed reform.
From reports that come to us it appears the pur
pose of the agitation is to obtain legislation bringing
express companies, like railways, under the control of
the Railroad Commissioners of the several States;
and. in addition thereto, the association declares an
intention "to bend all the energies of the mercantile
class of the United States to substitute for the ex
press companies an efficiently organized fast freight
service, which can perform practically the same func
tions as the express companies at far less cost."
Commenting upon the excessive rates charged by
the express companies the New York Herald says:
"It is alleged by the association that this charge is
sometimes valued so low as 4 cents for individual
shipments, and sometimes as high as several dollars
for the same work, the rate being lowered where there
is competition with local carriers and inordinately ad
vanced where this does not exist. It is asserted that
where the railway companies get $1 44 for carrying
about one hundred pounds a distance of nine hundred
miles, the terminal charges of the express companies
upon the same package are $2 17."
It is worth noting that while the Merchants' Asso
ciation support their movement by strong reasons
drawn from the extortionate rates of the companies,
the immediate cause of the agitation and the revolt
against the extortion is the action of the companies
ii: shirking the war tax and shifting it upon the pub
lic. The merchants are reported as saying they had
long been oppressed by the companies, and this last
exaction exhausted their powers of endurance.
Whether the plans proposed by the association for
relief are the best that could be adopted is doubtful.
Regulation by State Railroad Commissioners might
be beneficial in New York, but we despair of it in
California. Nor is the probability of railroad com
panies furnishing fast freights sufficiently strong to
be encouraging. A better plan would be to ask of the
General Government a statute placing express com
panies, like railways, under the control of the Inter
state Commerce Commission and the adoption of a
parcels post system similar to that which prevails in
the more progressive countries of Europe.
Under any circumstances, however, the New York
agitation merits support throughout the country.
The Merchants' Association and the Chamber of
Commerce in this city, as well as similar bodies
throughout the State, should cordially co-operate with
the movement so auspiciously begun. No express
company in the Union has been more greedy, grasp
ing, disloyal and unpatriotic than that which operates
in this State and plunders the public under the direc
tion of a p?alm-singing Pecksniff who swindles all
the week by tax-shirking and makes a farce of religion
by dropping a nickel in the contribution-box on
Sunday.
New York has the honor of leading the way, but
San Francisco should get into line at once and help
her to make the fight and win it.
NOT HAMPERED BY PRECEDENT.
LAWYERS declare that for the case of Cheese
man, an Oakland murderer, the records of the
courts afford no precedent. For this the
tribunal before which the man is to be tried ought to
be grateful.
Doubtless precedents are often useful, but that in
many instances they are pernicious and work injustice
is equally certain. As times and customs and standards
change, it is hardly reasonable to submit to the guid
ance of fusty opinions, filed by men dead now for gen
erations, who may not have been master minds when
at their prime and whose opinions may have been
based on a misconception of right and equity. Ap
parently the fact that an opinion becomes embalmed
in a book is often regarded as sufficient to give it a
value. The modern Judge cons the decision dug up
from centuries past, and dares not say his soul is his
own.
But if there is no precedent to rule in the Cheese
man matter the difficulty of giving the prisoner a
fair trial will be reduced to a minimum. Cheeseman.
in pursuance of a habit of killing people, a style of
amusement appealing to his fancy, shot a resident of
Oakland fatally and wounded some others. He was
sent to an asylum, where the professional experts de
clared he was sane and had never been otherwise, and
said in effect that his impulse to slay was due to a
vicious tendency which should be repressed by more
rigorous methods than detention in a comfortable
asylum.
We have no desire to have the law applied with un
due harshness. The fact that Cheeseman knew enough
to pretend, with temporary success, to be crazy, is
evidence, that he is of sound mind. Therefore, in the
absence of hampering precedent, there ought not
to be any particular delay in hanging the fellow.
Something of this kind must be done, or the escape
of Rosser will come to be regarded as the ruling pre
cedent, and assassins in California follow their voca
tion without hindrance.
fICCURfITE MARKET REPORTS.
AS to the accuracy of its market reports, The
Call has not been wont to boast, as these mat
ters speak for themselves and are well under
stood among commercial men.
It is not often that the market report of any paper
comes before a court and there receives judicial com
mendation, not only as being superior to the reports
of other papers, but as absolutely reliable and virtually
official.
The matter recently came before Judge Ogden of
Oakland. As to the subject of controversy there is
no interest here. Enough to say that a witness,
Walter G. Manuel, testified that the prices as quoted
IT The Call were gathered- by competent reporters
who daily visit the wharves, warehouses and com
mission houses. "The prices," said Mr. Manuel, "are
published in the big dailies, but The Call is most ac
curate in the matter."
Such was the view of the court, and in accordance
with it a case of considerable importance was decided.
An attorney attempted to make it appear that The
Call's reports were hearsay statements, but the court
failed to indorse the view, on the contrary saying,
"Such reports are better and more reliable than the
testimony of one who has actually made a purchase."
The question will soon be decided as to whether or
not Mrs. Botkin is a hypnotist
A RARE CONCESSION FOR GREAT BRITAIN.
The assurance that the Government of
Great Britain has given or Is about to
give instructions to her representative in
Washington to enter upon negotiations
with the United States Government for
the abrogation of the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty and the making of a new treaty
will be received with satisfaction, mixed
with surprise, by most people familiar
with her previous unalterable attitude
toward the question.
For nearly fifty years England has in
sisted upon the validity of that treaty
and the observance of its provisions by
the United States Government and peo
ple, though she has come far short of
living up to them herself or of even at
tempting to make certain energetic land
grabbers claiming to be her subjects or
acting under her authority to do so.
For nearly twenty years the British
Ministry has diplomatically fenced off all
attempts on the part of this Government,
through Mr. Blame and his successors, to
bring about this now graciously con
ceded result. The treaty was made in
Washington in 1850 by Mr. Clayton and
Sir Henry Bulwer, under conditions that
have long since ceased to exist, and to
carry out certain definite objects for
which a concession had been obtained by
the United States by a treaty with
Nicaragua, made the year beforeâ that is,
the building of a canal from ocean to
ocean along what was known as the
Nicaraguan route. This last treaty,
among other things, provided that work
should be begun and the canal completed
within certain limits of time.
The financial condition of this country
at the time precluded the idea of our un
dertaking- a work of such magnitude and
of such enormous prospective cost with
out aid from the more bountifully filled
money chests of Europe. So to obtain the
necessary funds overtures were made in
England, which finally resulted in the
making of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty.
This, In substance, placed Great Britain
and the United States on an equal foot
ing as to the enjoyment of the privileges
of the concc'ssion which the United States
had already obtained from Nicaragua,
and of the canal which was to be built
under it, and at the same_tirne bound
each and both of the high contracting 1
parties to abstain from all effort and any
attempt either by treaty or force of arms
to obtain any privileges or rights or ac-
quire any territory in any of the Central
American States in which the other was
not to have an equal share.
The time limit fixed by the treaty of
COMMISSIONERS SAY
BALLOTS ARE VOID
PISTOLESI WILL NOT WEAK
JUDICIAL EBMINK
By This Decision Byington May Lose
His Election as Supervisor
of the Seventh.
Garret McEnerney yesterday morning
rendered to the Election Commissioners
an opinion which, if the courts uphold it,
will make a difference of one in the Demo
cratic minority of the incoming Board of
Supervisors, and by a vote of 2 to 1 the
Commissioners upheld him.
The commission met yesterday morning,
with members Block and Tilton absent,
and they came together with the express
intention of hearing the opinion of Mr.
McEnerney on the plea of Attorney P.
Pistolesi for the counting of the votes cast
for nominees for the unexpired terms on
the Superior bench. As a result of the
meeting, Mr. Pistolesi will not wear the
Judicial ermine even for a day, and By
ington may be compelled to give up hia
supervisorial seat to the Republican con
testant, Dr. Kearney.
From the beginning of the official can
vass of the vote of the recent election the
Commissioners have fought shy of the
"unexpired term." There were numerous
votes cast, though the unexpired offices
did not appear on the ballot, choices for
the positions being written in in lead
pencil on the tickets, and Pistolesi was
the recipient of most of them. Up to the
day that the result of the recount was
declared he kept up a demand for the
counting of the ballots, by which he
I claimed he had been elected, and on
Thursday evening the Commissioners de
cided to test his case by calling in Mr.
McEnerney.
Mr. McEnerney's opinion was short and
very much to the point. He said that
Pistolesi was not a lawful candidate and
that any vote cast for him was void. He
contended that the election proclamation
issued by the Governor made no call for
the election of some one to fill the office
of Superior Judge for the unexpired term,
and, moreover, no such office was desig
nated on the official ballot. But Mr. Mc-
Enerney went further than this. He said
that any vote upon which Plstolesi's name
was written was invalid and must be
! thrown out of the count entirely, and if
! this opinion be backed by the courts the
contest filed by Dr. Kearney against By
lngton may win out for him. As it is at
present, he is just eighty-four votes be
hind and it is known that forty-one of
the votes cast for Pistolesi in his own
district were also voted for Byington. In
i case the courts abide by the opinion of
! Mr McEnerney, this number will be more
! than enough to throw Byington out of
Before adjourning the Commissioners
resolved to begin the count of votes for
the unexpired term at 9:30 o'cluck this
morning. _
ANOTHER VICTIM OF
THE KLONDIKE CRAZE
HE CAME FROM FAR BOHEMIA
TO SEARCH FOR GOLD.
Disappointed and Broken in Health,
Adolphus TJrvalek Sent a Bul
let Into His Brain.
Adolphus Urvalek, a patient In ward
B, City and County Hospital, committed
suicide yesterday morning by shooting
himself through the head. The weapon
used was a 41-callber Colt's revolver, the
property of Urvalek, which by gross
carelessness on the part of the hospital
management, he was allowed to retain.
Uryalek left the following note, written
in lead pencil In a very neat hand:
22, 12. '9Â°.
Dear Sir: Because of general ill-health I de
sire to put an end to my existence. I am only
pqrry that I am to do so in this Institution
where I received a graceful hospitality. But
I was unable to leave.
X thank you, therefore, sincerely, as well aa
Dr. Brigham and other doctors who kindly
attended on me.
My best wishes and prosperity for all.
Kindly send Immediately for my friend, Mr.
F Thorleuchter. Scott street, 112, nr. Halgnt,
city and deliver him my letter with his ad
dress on my table, B 29, my body equally at
his disposal. Yours sincerely,
A. URv AIjEK..
Mr Thorleuchter of 112 Scott street was
notified of the death of his friend. He
called at the Morgue and said he and
Urvalek shipped from Liverpool last
March and went direct to the Klondike,
but with different parties. In the search
for placer diggings they lost all their
gold coin without finding any gold nug
gets, and they returned to this city,
Urvalek putting up at the Golden West
Hotel. He was sick and had sustained
an injury to his leg, and on August 6 was
removed to the City and County Hospital
for treatment.
The suicide was a clerk by occupation.

good family.
Stanton Failed to Appear.
The case of Dr. Ragan, School Director,
charged by D. E. Stanton with soliciting
a bribe, was set for a hearing before
Judge Low yesterday afternoon at 2
o'clock. At that hour the defendant and
his attorneysâ Foote, Terry and Dwyerâ
were on hand, but the court room was
1849 between the United States and Nlca-
ragua for the completion of the canal ex-
pired before the work was even begun.
and so the very "raison d'etre" of the
Clayton - Bulwer treaty ceased to exist.
Though doing nothing contrary to the
provisions and agreements of that treaty
the Government of the United States has
ever since maintained that it was no
longer valid, but voidable at her own op
tion.
This fact was insisted upon by Mr.
Elaine in ISSI and by Mr. Frelinghuysen
in ISS4 with other able arguments, among
which was that Great Britain herself had
persistently and insfstently violated the
provisions of the treaty in occupying and
extending her occupation over a large part
of the Central American States of Hon
duras. Great Britain in reply has always
maintained that the treaty was in force
and that she had done nothing contrary
to its stipulations. She has been entirely
unwilling to surrender any point under the
treaty or admit any argument that would
tend to lessen the prospect of her control
ling or sharing in the control of the Nl
caraguan route. On this she has long had
her eye.
The expedition which sacked and burned
the city of Leon Nicaragua, in 16(!5 re
vealed to Great Britain the value of the
lake for a line of inter-oceanic communi
cation and was the beginning of a series
of efforts to seize and control it. The
leader of the expedition said that 'lie val
ued the booty captured as nothing in com
parison to the knowledge he had obtained
of the lakes and the country between the
two oceans" and that he proposed re
turning to Ometepec (the volcanic island
in Lake Nicaragua) "to form communica
tion between the north and south seas and
control it therefrom." Both before and
after this the buccaneers who made their
headquarters at Bluefields and who were
mostly under English leaders had the
countenance of the British officials.
After the capture of Jamaica by the
British in 1G55 systematic efforts wore
made to control the transit trade through
Nicaragua. Treaties were made with the
Indian tribes along the Atlantic Coast
and settlements were established at
points between Cape Graclos a Dios and
the Bocas del Toro, while the Bluefields
buccaneers were encouraged and protect
ed with a view to paving the way to a
British protectorate. Every Inch and
point so gained has been tenaciously held
and used to block the way to any project
for control or improvement of route in
which she did not share.
Two reasons may be assigned for Great
Britain's sudden change of attitude. Eith
er she has lately become imbued with a
wholesome respect for the growing power
and importance of the United States and
wishes to make a big bid for our friend
ship by conceding what she must sooner
or later surrender anyhow, or she ex
pects by her diplomacy to secure under
proposed new treaty for her commercial
and other interests everything, and more,
than she would have under the Clayton-
Bulwer agreement, and that without cost
to herself.
locked. They waited around for about
fifteen minutes, when Clerk Haskins ap
peared and explained that Prosecuting
Attorney Reynolds had in the morning
asked the Judge for a continuance of the
case till this morning. Stanton was not
in court at the time. The attorneys were
furious and there will be trouble this
morning.
PRESIDIO HOSPITAL.
Liberal Allowance of Money by the
Government â First Troop Utah
Volunteer Cavalry
The Secretary of War, through Quar
termaster General Ludington, U. S. A.,
has authorized the chief quartermaster
of the Department of California to expend
$113,339 on the new military hospital to be
erected on the Presidio reservation. This
sum is two-fold greater than the amount
originally allowed and will enable the
erection of a building- sufficiently kirgo 'o
meet the demands of the service in thiÂ»
department. The quartermaster generuj
of the army appreciates the importance
of the Presidio reservation. The decision
to provide adequate and permanent hos
pital accommodations speaks well for his
Intelligence.
Paymaster Downing 1 paid the Utah troop
of Cavalry at the Presidio yesterday. The
troopers received their travel pay on the
muster out and ivill leave for their respec
tive homes to-night. The Utah troopers
did not get to Santiago or Manila, but
they rendered excellent service in the
field of patrol duty in the mountains. In
a soldierly manner they accepted the as
signment of duty anu reflected credit on
the volunteer army and the State of Utah.
A board of survey was convened at the
Presidio yesterday to inspect the horses
turned in to the post quartermaster by
the First Troop, Utah Cavalry.
Rough on the Fishermen.
Deputy Fish Commissioners Davis and
Low went up the river on a sturgeon
gear raid on Thursday, and the result of
their efforts caused several fishermen to
wish them anything but a merry Christ
mas. Off in the bay opposite Martinez
and the Nevada docks over twenty sec
tions of illegal gear were confiscated, be
sides a number of valuable anchors.
While tho ruid %vas in progress the fisher
men stood on the wharves and cursod the
deputies ln all of the principal Latin lan
guages of Europe. This kind of fishing
apparatus is very expensive and its loss
is severely felt by the owners.

AWAY AFTER

Gaelic and She Will
Race to Honolulu.
CHRISTMAS SHIP AT MANILA

LAST THURSDAY.
Marine Superintendent iabrett of the
Risdon Iron Works Taken

Front.
The Pacific Mall Company's steamer
City of Peking did not get away for the
ni until late last night, while the O.
and O. Company's Gaelic sails for the
sanle ports this afternoon. There will be
a pretty race from here to Honolulu and
the chances are that the Gaelic will win.
The Peking has been delayed owing to a
crack in her shaft, which necessitated the
putting in of a new one. Yesterday she
was tried on the bay, and as everything
worked all right the vessel proceeded to
sea.
Both the Peking and Gaelic have big
passenger lists and all the freight they
<an carry. Cotton, nails, ginseng and
some other goods arrived late from the
East and were rushed aboard. For Ma
nila the Peking took away among other
things lXi casts canned goods, 100 cases
â¢wine, 23 packages naval stores and 2500
packages provisions. For China she had
aboard beans, flour, wheat, peas, malt and
bops.
Among the passengers by the Peking
was A. M. Brown, Marshal of the Ha
waiian Islands. It was he who bought
and paid for the British ship Falls of
Clyde and not W. Matson. The Falls of
Clyde will dock at Howard street wharf
to-day and will begin loading for Hono
lulu. On her arrival there Marshal Brown
will place her under the Hawaiian flag
and she will then become a regular island
trader.
The transport St. Paul (Christmas ship)
arrived at Manila last Thursday. When
Captain Hays was leaving here he said
he would reach the PhiPppines in plenty
ol time for the boys to get their Christ-
m nf P resent s and he kept his word. There
will be no delay in unloading the steamer
and the chances are that by to-night or
to-morrow morning every boy In blue will
he admiring the good things sent to him
from home.

ORNDORFF THOUGHT
HIS TIME HAD COME
How a flood=Natured Bummer Bear Terrified
the Stage Director of the or=
phi urn.
FOR a long time the friends of
Harry Orndorff, stpsr director
of the Orpheum, have for divers
unexplained reasons regarded
the young man as a bear fight
er. It may be that Harry had
a lurking suspicion that under cer-
tain conditions he would make trou
ble for the bruin family, but he has
arrived at the conclusion that It Is
r.ot the province of the "king be
hind the scenes" to go up against
any such' game. No one dnubis tho
of Orndorff, but there are cir
cumstances under which the m:m
with the grudge against a bear for
gets his ill feeling and is willing to
go in the other direction and leave
behind all his prejudices. Speaking
of bears is why the name of the
celebrated stage director of the
proud vaudeville house is mentioned.
There are performing bears at the
Orpheum, much to the sorrow of
the attendants, who are not accus
tomed to handling the brutes. There
by hangs a tale.
A few niphts ago when the cur
tain had gone down on the pole
walkfng ad In whi'h the big bfar
had secured the bottle of sweet wa
ter, the old animals were safely
secured, but the cub when whipped
off the stage did not meet his mas
ter behind the scenes and conse
quently was not locked up. In the
dim light between the drops Direc
tor Orndcrff and his assistants be
gan taking down the horizontal bar
upon which the animals had
performed. ~Mt. Orndorff was "dry
smoking" a cipar and during the
haste of getting the paraphernalia
out of the way looked down between
Twenty-first and Capp streets the following
programme will be rendered by au augmented
choir of twenty-four voices: Hymn Mo. 193,

Glad Tidings" (John Hyatt Brewer); contralto

his feet. What he saw there was a
bear with a very red-hot, wide-open
mouth. To see was to act. Mr.
Orndorff did not stand on ceremony;
he did not stand on anything, lie
simply threw himself backward in
to, space and prayed that the brute
would not. smash him. The : shock
w?\s so great "Harry" forgot he
had a cigar in his mouth and " v .s
result was that while lie devoted Ms
attention to getting outfit the way
he swallowed two-thirds of his Ha
vana. Mr. Bear went the other way
very fast, and was just in time to
put the fear of the Lord in the
heart of one of Orndorff's assist
ants, who fled blindly away from
the presence of the earnest beast,
and in his wild career collided with
a jrlre guy rope, which caught him
en the stomach and carefully threw
him twenty feet to the other side of
the stage. Orndorff was llnally
found in the property room secreted
behind a statue of Mars. The as
sistant has not been found yet. As
for the bear he was only looking for
sugar, and -as soon as his master
Issued orders he went meekly to his
quarters, having no thought of the
horrors he had engendered.
The handsome stage director of
the Orpheum has not yet been able
to see the joke. He is found occa
sionally coughing up sections of un-
Bmokea cigar and is religiously
keeping off the stage until he is us
sured that the bears are all chained
up. It is said he will vote against
the further engagement of bears,
cither stuffed or genuine. He would
rather fight cross fairies.

later took profits en the rise here. The action
of the Government in calling for the J8.000.000
of Union Pacific payments from the low Inter

per cent installments, failed to cause a ripple

eral Steel issues was on a tremendous volume

rose very sharply, but in the afternoon on free
liquidation and the withdrawal of some of the
usual support, the stocks broke, leading to a
moderate reaction in other shares. There was
good buying, however, of Federal Steel on the
dtp, and this steadied the list. Sugar, Leather,
Tobacco and American Steel and Wire showed
considerable strength. Rumor had It that
there would be favorable developments an

BRADSTREET"B FINANCIAL REVIEW.
HEW YORK, Dec. 23.â Eradstreet's Financial
Review to-morrow will say:
In view <â¢' the recent ris*Â« an/! large Btock
exchange transactions It was thought that the
market prior to the holiday* would become i
dull and react. The beginning of the we** j
was marked by tendencies which &greÂ«d with !
this estimate, bat after the first day or bo re
newed strength developed and prices were in
many ca*Â»s carried to the highest yet reached,
the activity cf speculation â  <â¢;.'.Â« Ibowa by the!
total dealing* from Wednesday to Friday, j
which were well up to V/i.W) share* each day.
While leading financial Interests were active I
and gave a support to certain specialties which :
had a due â  "â â¢ â¢ In both starting and main- J
tt.lalz.g tfc* moiremeot, the buying of stocks by ;
the public was the rr.ont notable bullish factor !
'..; th* week. Block commission and brokerage ;
booses hare uniformly had an exceptionally j
large volume of business, and while the ex- j
tent of the advances haÂ« induced a great deal j
of profit taking both by the professionals and j
the public, concessions In prices develop further
purchasing power. London was Inclined to
rest, and alÂ«o seemed at first to be indulging
la profit taking In Americans.
T&Â« renewed strength of the market here,
however, had a stimulating effect on Its in
terest In them, and In the latter portion of the
week there was fair foreign purchasing. It
M:erns, however, that the English financial
press exhibits a suspicious attitude toward
Americans and recommends a suspension of
buying until a reaction occur. Theories of this
kind found favor at the outset with a large
section of the board room professionals here,
so that their short selling in anticipation of a
moderate decline, such as the market almost
Invariably displays Just before the chief holi- I
day week of the year, simplified the work of j
the leaders who Instituted the renewed ad- I
j vance. To a large extent the market has been
more speculative In character, although the
falling off In the bond transactions to around
000,000 each day may be accounted for by the
diminished activity in a number of bond is
sues where manipulation has been rather ap
parent. At the same time It must be ad
mitted that the purchasing on the part of the
public was mainly for speculation, an idea that
further large advances in stock values are in
eight being among the principal Influences of
the moment.

DUNS REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW TORK. Dec. 23.â R. G. Dun's Weekly
Review of Trade will ear in to-morrow's Issue:
It Is a year beyond all parallel, and goes to
Its close with the biggest volume of business
ever seen. Knormous transactions at the Stock
Exchange' make some difference as also heavy
railroad earnings, but when all the transport
ing and speculative Interests are eliminated
there is still a much larcer business than in
any other month of any year. Last year the
exports were in volume greater than in Bny
previous month In the history of the country,
but this year the three weeks' reports show
an increase of 25 per cent against 9 per cent
In imports, which would indicate much more
than $70,000,000 excess of exports this month.
The payments through clearing houses have
been for the week 26.5 per cent greater than
last year and 12.4 greater than In 1592. and for
the month 17.8 per cent larger than In 1592.
Until now no greater volume of business hax
ever been done in the history of this country
than in the closing month of this year.
Shipments of wheat have been 3,285,704 bush
els, flour included, at Atlantic ports, against
3,698,321 last year, although Western receipts
for three weeks have been 25,088,581 bushels,
against 10,308,929 last year, a fact which the
'â  believers in a small crop may well consider.
i From Pacific ports the shipments have been
for the week 1.316,019 bushels, against 966,000
! bushels last year. Considering the enormous
' exports from July 1 to date, exceeding last
! year's, one can only wonder that the outgo
this year has been so large, and the price has
risen during the week a cent and a half.
Sales of wool have been large, 27,366,100
i pounds, against 23,115,200 pounds last year, and
I 21,580.200 in the same week of 18*2. with small
! as well as large manufacturers buying very
freely, which Indicates a general Improvement
in the demand for goods, although not enough
as yet to lift prices. The story of the iron
manufacture is like a dream. With 25.000 tons
of Bessemer pig sold at Plttsburg for $10 60
and gray forge at $9 40 and Chicago sales lim
ited only by the capacity of the works, and
Eastern sales so numerous and so large as to
raise the price 25 cents, there is a demand for
finished products which Includes at Phila
delphia 4000 tons of plates for export to South
America, 3000 tons at Chicago, where the works
are crowded. 80,000 tons of steel rails by the
Maryland Steel Company for Asiatic Russia,
35,000 tons for Australia, against British bids
at Plttsburg. and about 10.000 tons of domestic
at the East. 6600 tons of structural work at
Chicago and Pittsburg, and SOOO tons for car
building at Chicago, all the works there being
crowded with heavy orders of sheets and wire
rods, and sharp competition in the South on
cotton ties, pending a contract for 20.000 tons
of cast pipe for Yokohama and sales of smaller
quantities in each class too numerous to men
tion. Prices of Iron and steel products" have
not materially changed, although the tone is
everywhere stronger, and for wire nails quota- 1
tlons have been advanced to $1 30 at Plttsburg.
But this country is beating the world in this
Industry. .: â¢ â¢.
All thfs business is done with a full belief
that the next year's demand will be greater
than ever before, and it Is creditable, espec
ially in the iron and steel business, that so
little advance in price of finished products
has been made. The range -of prices Is nearly
20 per cent lower than in 1592, Indicating Â«t>
astonishing increase of quantity of products
exchanged. How Europe will be able to pay
mere thai :~ â¢â¢: Â»:â  due on merchandise en
aecemt for tie month of r>Â»cember. besides
the eumiuuus balances due for November and
pre-rioos mnothÂ« Is a question which the
ccsstrr â -- -.- -i to consider at Its leisure
aid with â ".â ** '.

252 Jn the United States last year, and 31 In

BRADSTREET'S ON CONDITION OF BUSI
NESS.
NEW YORK, Dec. 23.â Bradstreef s to-mor
row will say: Current business conditions fur
nish some sharp contrasts to those usually
looked for or reported at . this season of the
year. It Is, of course, reasonable to look for
exceptional activity In holiday and retail, trade
generally at this date, and in this respect the
most sanguine expectations appear to have
been realized. Probably never before at this
date, however, was the course of general busi
ness so animated as it Is at present. Specu
lative activity is no longer confined to the
stock market, but has widened to include wheat
and corn among the cereals and copper among
the metals, while the rush of business In Iron
and steel seems little, if any, abated, and some
lines, notably cotton goods and raw wool, are
displaying an activity and strength which
would have been welcomed at any time for a
year past. Prices of securities and of ' staples
alike. furnish examples of aggressive strength,
which are so numerous as to deserve special
mention.
In the Iron trade no signs of flagging inter
est are to be discerned, but rather more pro
nounced activity In new directions. The fea
ture of the week has undoubtedly been the re
ported placing of an order for 80,000 tons of
steel rails with an Eastern rail mill to go to
Siberia. All the strength of prices Is main
tained, and in some lines, notably billets, wire
rods, plates and bars, further advances are to
be reported. In many lines the country's pro
duction seems to be heavily sold ahead and
the utmost confidence is expressed as to pres
\ ent values being maintained or still further In
creased. In other metals, too, a sympathetic)
rise is to be discerned.
The foreign demand for cereals continues un
abated, any slight reaction. In price being taken
advantage of by foreign buyers. Wheat closes
the week with quotations well up to the high
est paid this autumn and short sellers of De
cember delivery are reaping f?ie benefit of In
diecreet speculation. The strength of wheat
has been enhanced by sympathy with â¢ the
growing speculative interest in corn, for which
the highest price paid for three years past has
been recorded. Speculation in copper and cop
per stocks has received an Impetus this week
from rumors of a combination to control the
American production. â¢ â¢
Strength and firmness Is a feature also of the
lumber market, with the possible exception of
yellow pine, where keen competition tends to
check the advancing tendency shown by other
woods. In other lines of general trade and In
dustry reports are as a rule favorable.
Wheat, Including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 5.515.231 bushels, against 6.243,
859 last week, revised to Include Portland, Me. ;
4,757,560 bushels In the corresponding week of
1897, 2.111,702 In 1896,-3.457,991 In 1895 and 1814
054 in 1894.
Since July 1, this year, the exports of wheat
aggregate 115.236,840 bushels, against 123.566,647
last year.
Business failures for the week number 212,
against 234 last week. 280 In this week a year
ago, 327 in 1896 and 316 In 1895. -
Business failures In Canada number 34, as
against 32 last week and 30 In this week a
year ago.

DRIED FRUITS IN NEW YORK.
NEW YORK, Dec. 23.â The Journal of Com
merce says: While as usual at this time of the
year the movement of dried fruits from first
hands Is slow, general feeling among holders
Is one of confidence, and good business Is look
ed for early in January. Recent auction sales
both of California and Imported fruits have
taken out of the market a considerable quan
tity of stock which might otherwise have been
pressed for rale later on, thus continuing the
unsettled feeling:. While these auction sales
have not been as successful as had been ex
pected, the results appear to have given fair
satisfaction to sellers, and it is believed they
will be continued. With the exception of rai
sins all kinds of California dried fruits appear
to be In a good position statistically. The
conditions existing In the California drfed fruit
market to-day are said to differ from those
usually present at this season In that there
have been very few consigned goods this year
and consequently stocks In Eastern markets
are under better control than is generally the
case.

OARSMEN ELECT
OFFICERS
FOR COMING YEAR
At the last general meeting of the Ariel
Rowing Club the following officers were
elected for the coming year: President,
P. J. Enright; vice president, Robert
Ellis; recording secretary. A. Taylor;
financial secretary, Eugene Flanders;
treasurer, H. A. Pless; captain, James
Wilson; lieutenant captain, James Me-
Kenna. The delegates to the Pacific As
sociation of the Amateur Athletic Union
are J. R. Bockman, A. Taylor and John
O'Connell; and the directors are D. J.
Sheehan, Johnson Hardy, D. O'Connell,
E. Lynch and G. W. Phelan. The three
delegates to the Pacific Association will
choose one of their number to serve on
the regatta committee.
The Ariel club has been notified to take
its boathouse away from .Long Bridge,
which is doomed to early demolition. A
committee has been appointed to seek a
Bui table site for new quarters for the
club, and if it is successful in finding one
bonds will be iloated and the Ariels Will
erect one of the largest and best-appoint
ed boathouses on the bay.
The election of officers of the South End
Rowing Club for the next half year -will
take place on Tuesday evening, December
27. The following are nominated for the
various offices: President, J. D. Mahoney;
vice president, T. 1. Fltxpatrick; financial
secretary, James B. Feehan; correspond
ing secretary, William H. Mead; treas
urer, Joseph P. ODea; captain, William
Thomas; vice captain, J. Lyons; sergeant
at-arms, James Pallas. The nominees for
the board of trustees (five to be elected)
are: A. McGeorge, H. Hawkins, A. J.
Mellitz, C. Creighton, J. Bogan, John Ross
and Victor Martinez. The nominees for
delegates to the Pacific Association of
the Amateur Athletic Union axe Edward
Scully, Robert McArthur and James P.
Foley. One of the three last named will
be chosen to serve upon the regatta com
mittee, and if the choice should fall upon
R. McArthur a curious state of affairs
will be produced, for about no matter
that has come before that committee, have
more animated discussions been held than
as to the amateur or professional stand
ing of "Bob" McA.rthur. The last dele
gate from the South Ends to the regatta
committee was M. Breen, but as he was
absent from two meetings in succession
the club was requested to send another
representative. The South Ends are
somewhat lukewarm members of the as
sociation, and from time to time talk is
heard of their withdrawing from it and
Joining the National Association of Ama
teur Oarsmen.
About a week ago several mem
bers and friends met at the Triton
boathouse at North Beach and en
joyed a fish dinner. The following were
present: J. P. Cahill, P. Lohmann, P.
Maeney, "vV. Hlnes. J. McCarthy, J. Mc-
Donald, A. Langford. T. Mullen, J. O'Con
nell, F. Wilson, A. H. Schimpf, G. Bar
det, A. Reimers and J. Kehrlein.
The medals won at the championship
rowing regatta held at Long Bridge on
November 6 were distributed at the
Olympic Club on Wednesday night, after
the water polo tournament. There was
no ceremony or speechmaking, W. Â« '.
Espy, the president of the regatta com
mittee, simply handing the trophies to
the winners or their representatives. Of
the thirty-six medals the Alameda Boat
Club carried off thirteenâ five for the
senior barge championship, five for second
place in the junior barge race, the cham
pionship medal in the senior outrigged
skiff race and both medals in the junior
outrigged skiff race. The Ariels carried
off five medals for the intermediate barge
championship and the Dolphins won the
senior shell championship. But the Pio
neers took the lion's share, winning no
fewer than seventeen medals â five for the
Junior barge championship, ten for sec
ond place in the senior and intermediate
barge races, the junior shell champion
ship and second place in the senior out
rigged skiff race.

GOLF PLAYERS AT
OAKLAND
AND THE PRESIDIO.
The ladies' handicap for the "Winslow
medal, which was set down to take place
on the links of the San Francisco Golf
Club on Tuesday morning, December 20,
was put off on account of the rain. Now
the ladles are too busy with holiday shop
ping to be able to think even of golf.
There will, however, be a great deal of
golf on the Presidio linka during the
Christmas holidays. This afternoon the
men's championship contest will begin.
There will be numerous entries, who will
be matched according to their strength.
The contest will be at 18 holes, match
play. Winners in the tirst play will pass
on to the second round; winners in the
second round will take part in the
third, and so on until the final round Is
reached. The contest will be resumed on
Mo ml ay.
The Los Angeles Country Club, the links
of which are on Pico Heights, Los An
geles, will hold a series of club competi
tions next Saturday. December 31. The
events will be as follows:
At 'J a. m. the club handicap for men,
36 holes, medal play. The club champion
ship and a gold medal will be awarded to
the player who makes the best gross
actual score and a silver medal will/ be
presented to the player with the best net

At 1:30 p. m. the club handicap for wom
en, IS holes, medal play. The club cham
pionship and a gold medal will be award
ed to the playur making the best gross

At 4 p. m. there will be a driving com
petition for men and at 4:15 p. m. a driv
ing competition for women, for both of
which events prizes will be awarded.
The winners of the club championships
will receive gold medals and the honor
of having their names and scores en
graved upon the championship cups, the
ownership and possession of the cups re
maining with the club.
On the Monday alter New \ears day
an open amateur competition will be held
for men (30 holes, medal play) and for
women (IS holes, medal play); also an
open driving competition for men and
women. Gold medals will be given as
first prizes and silver medals for second

wili be awarded in the men's and women's
driving competitions.
John D. Foster, secretary of the Los
Angeles Country Club, will be glad to re
ceive entries for the open events from
any golfers. His address is 220 Wilcox
building, Los Angeles.
In the competition for the ladies cup
of the Oakland Golf Club, which began
last Saturday, and the details of which
were given in last Monday's Call, Miss
Alice Momtt and Miss Duff were left in
the final heat. The rain prevented the
heat being played off early in the week,
but yesterday morning Miss Duff beat
Miss A. Moffltt by 1 up. Miss Duff has
now won two out of the three competi
tions that have been held for the ladies'
cup. After a fourth competition has taken
place the winners will play a final game
to decide the possession and ownership
oi the trophy.
T)n Monday two teams of eight men will
play a match on the Oakland links. Play
will begin at 11 in the morning. One of
the teams will be made up of Messrs.
Wheaton. Magee, Knowles, McXear, Bel
den, "Wingate, Hubbard and McKee. The
other will consist of E. R. Folger, G. D.
Greenwood, R. M. Fitzgerald, W. P. John
son, G. D. Gow, P. E. Bowles, J. A. Fol
ger and F. S. Stratton. Of the first team
C. P. Hubbard. J. McKee and C. P. Win
gate played against the San Francisco
team that visited Oakland on December
10. while the second team is exactly that
which represented the Oakland club on
the Presidio links on December 17. The
match is thus a trial of strength between
the first and second eights of the club.
Of course, if the first eight was well
chosen it should certainly beat the second
team. b\it It will be interesting to see by
how a large a. margin the first team can
win.
Several young ladies having volunteered
to decorate the club house of the Oakland
golfers for the Christmas season and an
informal tea, to which all members are in
vited, will be given there on Monday af
ternoon, December 26, and on Tuesday a
turkey dinner will be set before about
forty caddies, on each of whom a present
from the Christmas tree will be bestowed.
SMALL INTEREST TAKEN
IN THE FIELD TRIALS
Norman J. Stewart of the Rancho Bonl
to collie kennels has sold to W. B. True
of San Jose a sable and white collie dog
puppy by Imported Ormskirk Blucher, out
of Schmoral. The litter seemed to catch
the popular eye at the Oakland show,
and the sale Is one of the results.
The Pacific Coast Is well represented In
Sprat V a calendar for 1899. Mrs. J. P. Xor
man's mastiffs make a fine showing. H.
Wepener's cockers grace the cover, and
John de Ruyter's collies and setters are
the types of those respective breeds.
Dr. F. W. d'Evelyn, president of the Pa
cilic Mastiff and Fox Terrier clubs and of
.the Pacific Kennel LeaKue, prepared a
pleasant surprise for his friends last
Monday by his unexpected return to San
Francisco. His lecture tour in the Kast
was brilliantly successful. .
The entries for the all-age stakes in
the field trials closed on the 15th inst.
The total of entries foots up far less than
last year, with the pointers in the ma
jority. The most promising of the possi
ble candidates are not entered for vari
ous reasons. "Vnllente and Rowena are
dead, Dash Antonio Is In the East and
Peach Mark is out of the running. The
outlook is poor for a successful meeting
this year.
To-Morrow's Handball Games.
The games to be played at Phil Ryan's

NO COURSING
TO-DAY
AT INGLESIDE
There will not be any coursing to-day,
as Judge Grace left this city yesterday
for Los Angeles, where he will judge the
big Christmas day meeting.
Very extensive preparations have been
made by the sportsmen of Southern Cali
fornia for the meeting, which will be at
tended by thousands of people from all
parts of California. Colonel Black, to
whose untiring efforts is due largely the
success which coursing is now enjoying
in Los Angeles, is determined to spare
neither time nor expense in giving the
lovers of the game a grand Christmas
holiday, and with that object in view he
has engaged the best military band in Los
Angeles to play during the intermission
between the courses.
Ingleside Park will put on a new dress
next month. The association, which is
looking out for its best interests, contem
plates making several improvements, be
sides adding new features. One of the
new features which. will catch the eye of
the sportsmen is a large blackboard,
which will be placed in the betting ring
within full view of the pool sellers and
the spectators. After each course the
names of the winner and loser and the
points they scored during the course will
appear on the board. This will give those
who may differ from the judge in opinion
a chance to see what each dog has done.
The entering of dogs for the drawings
under the names of So-and-so's kennel
will in future be done away with by the
managers of Ingleside Park, as there is
too large an opportunity for trickery to
be practiced under this new but danger
ous system of entry. The owners of dogs
will be compelled to enter their charges
in their own -names so that the betting
public can form some Idea as to who the
rightful owner of the dog or dogs may be.
The next meeting at Ingleside Park will
be held on Saturday week, and the draw
ing for the same will take place next
Thursday evening at Pythian Castle,
NEW YEAR'S FEAST FOR
CORINTHIAN YACHTSMEN
The most notable event among bay
yachtsmen during the winter is the an
nual dinner of the Corinthian Yacht Club.
This takes place in the clubhouse at Tib
uron on New Year's day, and will begin
promptly at 1 p. m. It will be under the
general supervision of Port Captain J.
H. Keefe, who will be assisted by L. B.
Chapman, H. A. Denhard, H. H.Gorter,
T. W. Ransom, F. M. Thornton, J. Short,
R. S. Buck, W. C. Howe, F. E. Schober,
H. D. Hawks and Carl Westerfeld. The
limited accommodations of the clubhouse
will not permit of the invitation of any
but members.
The Corinthian Club has suffered a se
vere loss in the death of its secretary,
Edward B. Lathrop, on Thursday morn
ing, from congestion of the brain. After
leaving school Lathrop made two voyages
to the Hawaiian Islands in sailing ves
sels, and he frequently went out to sea
on one of the pilot boats, in 1593 he was
a member of the crew of the yawl Seven
Bells, and during 1594 he sailed with va
rious friends In the Corinthian Club. In
1595 he became a member of the club, and
sailed on the sloop Elia with P. F. Ames
during that and the following season.
Early in 1*97 E. B. Lathrop, with W. P.
Humphreys Jr., R. Farquharson and the
Montealegre brothers, chartered the large
sloop Pride and sailed her during tne
yachting seasons of 1897 and 18'JS. Though
the Corinthians were anxious that he
should retain the secretaryship during
the coming season, It was his intention
to refuse re-election to the office. He was
enthusiastically fond of yachting, and his
death is sincerely regretted by all inter
ested in the sport.
The election of officers of the California
Yacht Club for the coming year will take
place at the clubhouse on San Antonio
estuary next Thursday evening, De
cember 29. The following members have
received nominations for the various of
fices: For commodore, Allen M. Clay; for
vice commodore, Harry W. Brydges; for
treasurer, E. N. Walter, incumbent; for
secretary, R. L. Eames; for measurer, J.
J. Sherry: for port captain, Eugene Flan
ders; for directors â L. F. Gale, G. B.
Edgar, George Miller, L, S. Sherman and
C. J. Lancaster. The nominees for the
regatta committee are Eugene Flanders,
C. J. Lancaster and R. R~ l'Hommedleu;
and the nominees for delegates to the Pa
cific Interclub Yacht Association are E.
N. Walter, L. S. Sherman and â  R. R.
l'Hommedleu.
Almost every one of these nominees Is
not only an active yachtsman, but also
an owner. Allen M. Clay, formerly owner
of the sloop Sea Fox, now owns the large
sloop Pactolus, which he purchased at
the close of the season of 189S, and has
had refitted; Harry W. Brydges owns
the yawl Hope: E. N. Walter the sloop
Embla, which last season carried Com
modore C. J. Lancaster's flag; R. L.
Eames' yacht is the sloop Surf; J. J. Sher
ry is owner of the yawl Gypsie, and Eu
gene Flanders of the launch Ariel. L. F.
Gale last season owned the sloop Mist,
but recently purchased the sloop Secret
from T. F. Tracy, ex-commodOre of the
Corinthian Yacht Club; G. F. Edgar is
of the sloop Sappho, George Miller of the
sloop Occident, L. S. Sherman of the sloop
Royal, and C. J. Lancaster was formerly
owner of the sloop Edna. R. R. l'Homme
dieu was part owner of the sloop Phoe
nicia, and Is secretary of the Pacific In
terclub Yacht Association. The club can
hardly fail to be active, if its interests
are placed in the hands of so many ac
tive lovers of yachting.
MICHAEL IS* COMING.
Crack Wheelman to Visit California
in February.
NEW TORK, Dec. 23.â "Jimmle" Mich
ael, who has been sojourning in this city
for several weeks, announced to-day that
he would leave to-morrow for Nashville,
Term., to look after his horse stabled
there. He thought that early in Febru
ary he would go to California for the In
door racing season there.
San Rafael's Football Team.
SAN RAFAEL. Dec. 23.â At the annual
election of officers of the San Rafael Foot
ball Club, held last evening in the rooms
of the San Rafael Athletic and Cycling
Club, S. Dollar was elected captain, H.
Hansen manager, and District Attorney
elect Hugh J. Mclsaacs treasurer for the
ensuing year. This team is deemed one
of the best amateur organizations of the
kind on the coast, every member holding
a good record as a sprinter. The team is
matched to play the Pastime Club of San
Francisco next Monday on the San Rafael
baseball grounds.
MARK LANE'S INJUNCTION.
Argument on Motion to Dissolve It
Heard by Judge Belcher.
Argument on ihe motion to dissolve the
Injunction heretofore issued in tne suit of
Mark Lane against the Board of Edu
cation was heard by Judge Belcher yes
terday morning. Lane in his petition for
an injunction alleged that the board was
about to appoint many new teachers and
was about to illegally close the Business
Evening School. A temporary injunction
was issued by Judge Belcher and the mo
tion to dissolve this injunction was heard
yesterday.
Judge Van R. Paterson, who represented
Lane, maintained the position that the in
junction should be made permanent by
reason that the schools are now abund
antly supplied with teachers and 'â hat ad
ditional appointments would involve a
waste of public funds. Attorney Jacob
Samuels, on behalf of the board, contend
ed that the court had no power to issue
the injunction In the premises and asked
that the petition be dismissed. Judge
Belcher took the matter under advise
ment.
REFEREES WHO
WILL
KILL BOXING
If those who mana^ boxing affairs in
this city would instruct their master of.
ceremonies to announce before the con
testants of a prize fight enter the ring
that Queensberry rules are no longer ob
served in this city they would be favor
ing many patrons of the game who are
still of the opinion that the Queensberry
rules govern all boxing contests.
The recent twenty-round bout between
Lavigne and Tracey was given to the
Saginaw "Kid" because he slugged the
hardest and scored the greater number of
misses. Lavigne was the aggressor, and
on that account alone he was awarded
the decision. Tracey outclassed him in
every other particular, but the referee
understood the game only from a slog
ger's point of view, and that gave Lavigne
the match.
On Thursday night Jack Stelzner ref
eretd a contest, and when he decided in
favor of Maxwell he knew only too well
that he he;it<Kl Denny out of a game
which h> won beyond all possible doubt.
Stelzntr w.iderstands the rules, but when
certain I .ducements were offered to him
to doM his eyes on Queensberry he evl
â¢ forgot what straight hitting, neat
defensive work, clever ducking and beau
tiful side-stepping meant.
Maxwell, who is purely a slogger of the
25-cent boxing club school, demonstrated
by wild swings and exceedingly poor
judgment that he has yyety e t much to learn
about listicuffs.
It is certain that professional boxing in
this city will soon see its end unless the
clubs will select their own referees, who
must be instructed to read the Queens
berry rules carefully and decide contests
according to them. Referees selected by
the lighters are guided solely by the ad
vice they receive from some gambler who
"works" the pool boxes in his own inter
ests, and as long as the fighters will have
any voice in the selection of referees the
sport must suffer the consequences.
Have the owners of race horses a say
as to who must judge any particular race
at Ingleslde or Oakland track?
"What would the directors of the Cali
fornia Jockey Club think if they were
approached by a brace of horsemen and
asked to appoint certain judges for some
race that they, the tricksters, were in
terested in?
Yet, while the pugs can select referees
who are to their fancy the sporting fra
ternity can expect to witness only hip
podromes of the worst kind imaginable.
The National Club is really the only
club in this city that has a record for
holding clean fistic entertainments. It
has given good shows in the past and
doubtless its next entertainment on the
30th inst. will be well worth seeing.
George Green always puts up a stiff ar
gument, and if Creedon is the Creedon
of a few years ago the sports who will
attend "the mill" may expect to see a
good fight.
CHEATED THE NOOSE AGAIN.
Kellini Guilty, but the Penalty Fixed
at Life Imprisonment.
Tomasso Kellini, the Italian fisherman,
â¢who shot and killed his mistress, Louisa
Spain, will not hang for his crime, but
will spend the rest of his days in prison.
The jury in his case, after being out all
night, came into court yesterday morning
and returned a verdict finding the defend
ant guilty of murder in the first degree,
but fixed the punishment at imprisonment
for life. It is understood that seven of the
jurors voted for a hanging verdict up to
the last minute, but finally, when court
was about to convene, gave in and voted
for life imprisonment.
Kellini's crime was a cold-blooded one
and he, as well as the District Attorney's
office, expected that the death penalty
would be inflicted.
Bacon Place Cases.
When the cases of the women arrested
in Bacon place for vagrancy were called
before Justice of the Peace Barry in
Judge Conlan's court yesterday Attorney
Lennon, for the prosecution, asked that
the case of Emma Wardell be first set for
trial. Attorney Ach preferred the case of
Emma de Loudre. The acting Judge
adopted Ach's suggestion, and set tne
case for trial on January 9. This led to
an angTy exchange of words between Len
non and the acting Judge, but the latter
was not to be moved from the position he
ha 4 taken.
The World's Supply of Wheat
An English expert prophesies a universal
dearth in the wheat supply. He claims that
the wht-at producing soil is unequal to the
strain thai will be put upon it. Even now
when the food supply of the world Is ample,
thousands die because their disordered stom
achs fall to properly assimilate the food they
take. Hogtetter's Stomach Bitters strengthen
and tone up the stomach and digestive organs,
and enable them to perform their proper func
tions. This great remedy cures dyspepsia, tor

Against Giving Presents
to Jockeys.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 23.â Riley Gran
nan was reinstated by the stewards ol
the Jockey Club at a meeting held to
day. "Doc" Street, who has been un
der the ban since the meeting at St.
Asaph in 1896, also was reinstated.
Grannan had been beaten in the
courts and on the turf, and his pardon
Is a voluntary act of clemency on the
part of the Jockey Club.
"Grannan was ruled off in 1896 on thq
charge of having violated that rula
which prohibits giving presents to
Jockeys by others than the owner of
the horse.
August Belmont, chairman of the
State racing commission, which had in
tervened in the suit, had an appeal
taken and the case went to the Court
of Appeals. Grannan was defeated on
all points, and the right of the racing
authorities to make such rules as they
saw fit, providing these rules were ap~
proved by the State Racing Associa
tion, was established.
Rlley Grannan, who is booking at the
local race tracks, was first apprised ot
his reinstatement by a telegram from a
friend in New York. He said last night:
"Although I had hoped to be rein
stated by the Jockey Club, the newa
came as a complete surprise. Since thÂ«
first telegram announcing my reinstate
ment I have received a number of con
gratulatory telegTams from friends in
the East."
CLEVER DICK O'BRIEN
DEFEATED BY RYAN
Police Interfere in the Fourteenth
Round to Save Him From a
Knockout.
HARTFORD, Conn., Dec. 23.â Tommy
Ryan of Syracuse, N. V., proved too
much for Dick O'Brien of Boston at the
Coliseum to-night. The police interfered
in the fourteenth round and saved
O'Brien from an actual knockout; but aa
far as practicable purposes were con
cerned he was out. Ryan had floored him.
a few seconds before with a right-hand
swing on the jaw, and Dick got to his feet
again just aa Referee Roche counted
seven. The fight had all been knocked out
of him. He was helpless and Ryan again
floored him with a vicious right-hand
swing. Dick came to time once more,
only to fall a. victim to a hard uppercut.
Then Chief of Police Bull jumped into the
ring and stopped the bout, and Roche
awarded the fight to Ryan.
The action of the police was generally
approved as preventing unnecessary bru
tality. It was Ryan's fight all the way
through. He wore O'Brien down by
inches with jabs, and had him bleeding
at the nose and eye early in the flght.
Several times Ryan had his man going,
but although he made dozens of passes
he could not land that right swing till
the> fourteenth round. Ryan was too
quick on his feet and too scientific for his
opponent, who could simply stand still
and punch and be punched.

A CEMETERY
FENCE CAUSES
CONSTERNATION
An Eyesore Located at
Mountain View.
OBNOXIOUS HIGH BOARDS
AN ACTION SUGGESTIVE OF A
JOKER,
ThÂ« Laugh on the Catholic Cemetery
Turned by the Hebrews on
the Mountain View
People.
Oakland Office San Francisco Tall,
008 Broadway, Dec. 23.
A high hnnrri fence now being erected
on the south side of the Jewish Cemetery
Is causing much consternation to the
cemetery a?s< ciations. The Mountain
View Association Is anxious to purchase
the plat owned by the Jewish Associa
tion, and t ho erecting of the fence in its
present position is a big blot to the
beauty of Mountain View Cemetery and
an eyesore to the thousands of visitors
â¢who go to the cemetery largely to wit
ness its scenic beauty.
Some years ago the father of D. Ed
ward Collins iMiisiimmated a deal by
â¢which a large slice of Mountain View
Cemetery was sold to the Jewish Asso
ciation. At that time the Jews erected
a high fence on the north side of their
property, to protect their people during
a Jewish funeral ceremony from being
gazed at hy the crowds who go to the
cemetery on the electric oars. This hiÂ«h
fence was a source of amusement to the
Mountain View people, as it prevented
any one in the Catholic Cemetery, which
adjoins the Hebrew burying ground, from
seeing the Mountain View Cemetery.
This condition existed lor some years,
but recently that branch of the electric
road has been taken up and the Jewish
people are now moving the horrible fence
down to their southern boundary, much
to the chagTin of the Mountain View
people. The board fence baa been car
ried even across a road leading through
the Jewish property into the Mountain
\ lew property, and this will necessitate
the makiiiK of a new piece of road In
order to secure a thoroughfare for the
Mountain View people from Charles
street to the eastern portion of their
burying ground. The Mountain view As
sociation Is anxious to purchase from the
Jewish Association thr beautiful plat it
Fold to them years ago. when Mountain
\iew Cemetery plats were not so much
in demand as they are now. It is now the
turn of the Catholic Association to smile
at the chagrin of the Mountain View As
sociation, as the board fence is moved
from their boundary on to the boundary
of the Mou Â«tain View people.

THE YELLOW MONSTER
AT THE EXPOSITION
DE GARMO GRAY DELIVERS ONE
PARTING SHOT.
No One Dreamed That He Had a Wife
Being Driven to Suicide in
Southern California,
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Dec. 23.
There waa evidently a little Jealousy
over the management of the Oakland
Exposition. Charles (sometimes Count*
de Garmo Gray says so in a letter he has
written to the directors of the exposi
tion. It is all contained in one sentence,
but it suggests a volume. The last sen
tence in the letter reads as follows: "But
surely the eleven directors should not be
led by the 'Jealous mouthlngs' of one of
their number.'
The "jealous mouthings" are referred to
In the letter as being an article contrib
uted to a local paper, the author of
which Count* de (Jarmo tiray believes
is Director Craigie Sharp.
Craigie Sharp is secretary of the Board
of Trade. He is a man of great hustling
ability, and has managed the last two ex
positions. Prior to the opening of the
exposition this year there was a, feeling
that Craigie Sharp was not the man for
the place. Jt was thought tie did not hayÂ«
sufficiently advanced and original ideas,
and so a new man was sought. He did
not require much seeking, however, for
De Garmo <ir;iy. armed with a volume of
testimonials, appeared, ana very soon the
directors, or some of them, were infat
unted with him. DÂ» (iarnio soon wanted
to control the directors, and on one or
two occasions what is commonly known
as the riot act w;is read to him. One "f
the directors is Craigie Sharp, and Mr.
Gray always avoided Mr. Sharp, wbiie
Sharp never went out of his way to
avoid Mr. <iray.
Two days after the show closed an
Item appeared in the local pai>er headed
"Sharp Says 'I Told Yon So.' " The ar
ticle then went on to state that Mr. Cray
had been Â» huge failur-- ;is .-< manager,
end that the exposition as compared with
the expositions managed by Craigie
Sharp w:<s :t worse failure. Although Mr.
Sharp denied writing or suggesting tue
norv, <;ra\ at once attributed it to his
rival.
Hi!-; article, which is well .Â«UÂ£K
by its Title, w;is the beginning of the
had bl l between the directors and Gray
that â¢â¢n<)'.-<! in tin- threats contained in
their legal correspondence, it constitutes
ihe "jealoua mouthlngs" which Is Charles
de Garm-i's parting shot at the directors
â  who undertook to discipline him.
In his testimonials to the director! it is
stated that De (larrau Gray has s;:
fully managed "dog shows, cat shows,
pet shows, pure food shows, Irish fairs,
national shows, bazaars. Hebrew festi
vals, international expositions" and at
least twenty other kinds of shows. Oak
land directors are wondering what his
next prospectus will contain regarding
his experiment in Oakland.
While here De Gsirmo Gray lived three
romantic months. No one knew that he
had a broken-hearted wife starving in
I>os Angeles, who was ultimately brought
to suicide. He did on two occasions ob
tain an advance from the directors on
the ground that he wished to send money
to his wife, who was sick in Ix>s Angles
but according to the story of the woman'
and her friends none of the money
reached her.
But D>; Garmo Gray did not lack for

lady acquaintances in this city, some of
whom were probably not contaminated
by the acquaintanceship. But there was

sent bouquets frequently. This young
lady was considerably attracted by the
insinuating charms of Gray, and was
much surprised when she learned <>f his

TAUSMANIC INFLUENCES
OF JUSTICE CLIFT^
OCCULT POWERS EXERTED OVER
GROOMS, SAYS BIANCHI.
Paid Five Dollars to Marry in Court,
but a Priest in Another County
Tied the Knot Again.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 23.
If the remarkable testimony of John
Bianchl. a San Francisco barber, given
In Superior Judge Ellsworth's court to
day, be true as sworn to. Justice of the
Peace Fred ('lift is possessed of talis
manle and occult powers that have been
the cause of C. E. Kinard bringing suit to
depose the Justice, almost on the eve of
his stepping out of office.
Kinard charges C'lift with malfeasance
In office, and as an Instance specifies that
the defendant charged $0 for performing
the function of tying nuptial knots when
the legal fee is but $3.
The trial was begun this afternoon, and
to establish the truth of the mentioned
allegation John Bianchi was called as a
witness. Bianchl, according to his tes
timony, had secured a license here to
make Julia Griffin his bride on June 6,
l v :^. the marriage ceremony being per
formed by Justice Clift; damages. $5.
M. C. Chapman, on behalf of defend
ant, cross-examining, drew out from wit
ness that be bad once before been mar
ried by a Justice and knew that the legal
fee was $::. "Then why did you pay Clift '
$5?" asked the attorney.
"Because of Cliffs t. : tlismanie powers," i
answered the witness, "which he exerted
over me when I asked him how much 1
ow< d for the ceremony." Witness admit
ted that he had looked up the word lalis
manlc in the dictionary for the purpose
of using it when called as a witness.
"Well, now, what d<. you understand it :
to mean?" further queried the legal man. !
"Why, it's the feeling that comes over
a man when he yets married." replied
witness, intimating at the same time that
Justice Clift' a occult powers were re- j
sponsible for thi^. "This power is exer
i is. ,i by the Justices all through the
country." continued Bianchi.
Later witness stated that for some rea- j
son or other the fair bride was not sat
isfied with the ceremony performed by <i
Justice, and so, four days later, they were
married again by the Rev. Father M.
Jloran or Moran in San Fran< Isco, and
on the strength of the license issued in
Alameda County.
Blanch! had been served with a subpena
by Kinard yesterday, and testified that he
immediately telephoned to dirt wishing
him to cross the bay for an Interview, but
that Clift referred him to his attorneys.
"But J wanted to see Clift alone," con
tinued Bianchi. "1 wanted to bÂ« ar both
Bldi a of the question and wished to aÂ»sk
him what was meant by malfeasance in
office. 1 supposed, too. that he might
want to say something to me that he
didn't want some one to know."
"Is not this the case." inquired Attor
ney Chapman, "that you wanted Judge
Clift to buy you off?"
Witness was about to request the court
to Instruct the attorney in his method of
questioning, but the court ordered an
answer, and Bianchi answered negatively.
The case will contiue to-morrow morn
ing and promises to be one of the most
interesting aa well as amusing trials ever
had here.
Against Garbage Crematories.

recommend to the City Council tnat the
request made some time ago for a fran
< hue to conduct a garbage crematory on

nied. Some of the members believe that
eventually the city would conduct a cre

are just now handling the city's garbage
in a satisfactory manner.

DETECTIVES
ARE SEEKING
FOR PARKER
His Wife Wires From
Chicago.
NO CLEW TO THE LAWYER
MORE EVIDENCE THAT HE IS A
MAN OF WEALTH.
Believed That He Is Sick in Some
Part of the State and Unable
to Send Word to His
Friends.
* 6akland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 23.
The mystery surrounding me disappear
ance of John R. Parker was not lifted to
day, but rather deepened. In answer to
the dispatch sent from Chicago last night [
SOS Broadway, Dec. 23.
'he mystery surrounding me disappear
ce of John R. Parker was not lifted to
y, but rather deepened. In answer to
s dispatch sent from Chicago last night
by Chief Fletcher, several dispatches were
received to-day. One was sent to the
proprietor of the Galindo Hotel by Mrs.
Parker, who is now in Chicago, asking
for details of her husband's whereabouts,
if any are obtainable.
This morning a detective in the employ
of the Hibernia Bank of > San Francisco
came to Oakland to search for clews of
the missing man. The bank has been
asked by a prominent attorney of Chi
cago, who knows Parker well, to try to |
locate him. Their detective could obtain
no more news than was printed In this
morning's papers, for Parker dropped
completely out of sight, and no one la
able to even guess wnere he went. dropped
npletely out of sight, and no one is
c to even guess wnere he went,
The ordinary theories of foul play have
been advanced, but It is regarded as far
more reasonable that Parker is lying sick i
in some place unknown to his friends.
When he left tne Galindo he was known
to be sick and It is proDable that he be
came seriously ill and that he will soon be
found on account of the publicity given to
his disappearance.
When Attorney Parker came to Oakland
I a month ago he called on several attor
neys in the building where he rented of
[ flees, and made himself acquainted. One
of these attorneys is Darwin C. de Golia.
"Mr. Parker called in my office a few
days after his arrival, " said Mr. de Golia
this atternoon, "and we discussed various
matters for a couple of hours. He told i
me of his Chicago connections and of his
purposes in coming to California, and he
t evidently intended to look around and if
I everything was satisfactory to bring his
family out here. I am convinced he is a
man of some means, and he impressed me i
with the fact that be is a man of excel
lent judgment and stability. I am certain
i that he is not keeping away from Oakland
of his own desire."
Nothing more has been heard of 'th
man who called at the Galindo Hotel two
days after Parker's disappearance and in
formed the proprietor that Parker was
sick and would -not be back for a few
days. He has not called again and there
is no trace of him to be found. Parker's

mail still accumulates at his office in th
Blake A: Moffltt block, but as no one has
any authority to touch it it throws no
light on his disappearance.
lc has been learned that a man named
Parker was buried here November 23, but
although well along in years he was not
the missing attorney.
A guest attorney, Galindo Hotel was
guest at the Galindo Hotel wa.
found to-night who hail a conversation
with Parker the night before he left.
Parker went to Stockton to see some real
estate and was to return in a couple of
days. Mrs. Allen, proprietor of the hotel,
recalls a conversation in which Parker
told her he was going to Stockton, and i
she says if he be sick he is in a Catholic
I hospital, as he said he was once so well
â  treated in one of those institutions that
j he would go to no other.
PREPARING FOR A HOT FIGHT.
Alameda Politicians Getting in Line
for the Spring Election.
ALAMKDA. Dec. 2;!.â Alameda politics
Is beginning to bubble. New candidates
for the municipal offices are bobbing up
every day. and it is now certain that in
no case will the office have to seek the
man. James Fowler, Deputy Coroner, is
the latest to have political ambitions. He
baa a notion that he would like to shine
as a City Trustee, and his friends are
beginning to makn plans to capture for
him the nomination of one of the con
ventions. City Clerk Lamborn and Re
corder St. Sure will be candidates for re
election. They will apparently have a
walkover at the election. There is no
well defined opposition to either of them,
and so far they have the Held all to
themselves. A. T. Burns is out for the
Aasessoranip in opposition to B. M.
Smith. Burns is backed by the younger
element, and has a big following. Smith
baa held the office for several terms. Ros
well <i. Wheeler wants to succeed himself
us City Treasurer; Elmer Johnson, Os
wald l>ubbock and Unwood Palmer are
also after the position; but Wheeler's
friends claim he has the inside track and
will be an easy winner.
Ther,- v.fll be a warm fight for the office
of City Marshal, but the action of the
City Trustees in putting Sergeant Conrad
in the position to till the unexpired term
of Oscar Rogers has mixed matters to
such an extent that it is hard to tell |usi
now who will be in the field for the Job
Alameda is getting ready ror one of the
hottest political lights it has ever experi
enced.

A Heavy Wind in Berkeley.
BERKELEY, Dec. 23.-For the last two
nights the university town has been vis

which has never been equaled here before
It was confined almost entirely to the
central part of the city, the outlying dis
tricts being: scarcely touched " at all
Within the affected region the powerful
norther exerted its energy with a terrific
force, bringing sleepless nights to many
of the citizens. Ten or twelve windmills
were completely wrecked, doors were
taken off their hinges, fences were blown
down and signboards broken. Otherwise
the destruction of property was slight.
Some of the exposed sections of the town
were rendered quite impassable for pedes

AGAINST CALIFORNIA PRODUCT
Local Protest Against the Ecuador-
Chile Treaty.
Local merchants, manufacturers and
exporters are considerably exercised over
a reciprocity treaty recently entered Into
by the Governments of Ecuador and
Chile. The treaty relates solely to com
merce and navigation, and under its pro
visions many articles of commerce are
admitted free of duty from one country
to the other. On the free list are sugar,
tobacco, fresh and preserved fruits, table
wines, dried and preserved vegetables,
preserved fish, cement, nearly all of the
base metals, lumber, flour, etc.
As soon as a copy of the treaty fell Into
the hands of the local exporters they saw
at a glance that its provisions would
work a serious injury to the Pacific Coast
commerce of this country-
San Francisco has enjoyed a good trade
with Chile and Ecuador, and the treaty
mentioned will have the effect of killing
it, especially in the line of flour, fruits
and wines. The matter was taken up by
the officers of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association, who sent to the
Secretary of State at Washington a copy
of the treaty and a long letter calling at
tention to the discrimination against the
United States. The statistics given show
that hundreds of barrels of flour and
wine have been exported to these coun
tries.
The position taken is that the United
Slates and California should have the
same privileges in these countries as any
nation, and the Secretary of State is re
quested to do all in his power to preserve
United States Interests in South America.
lesterday a meeting was held in the
rooms of the association, which was at
tended by all of the local exporters and
the letter was indorsed. It was derided
that a memorial be sent to the Secretary
of State and the Pacific Coast represent
atives urging their speedy and earnest
co-operation and action in the correction
of this injustice/to American commerce.

A NEW TRIAL ORDERED.
Judgment Reversed in a Valley Road
Contract Case.
The Supreme Court has reversed the de
cision of the lower court in the case of
A. V. Scanlan against the San Francisco
I and San Joaquin Valley Railroad Com- j
; pany. < The contractor brought the action J
:to recover what he contended was the
; contract price of the construction of a
. railway embankment. There was no con
! tention as to the amount of money due
: and the defendant stood ready to pay the
; same, but the difference lay in the re- j
sults of the different measurements as j
to the number of cubic feet the embank- I
ment contained, the price being on a basis
of ,so much per cubic foot. In the lower
court the contractor was successful but
the judgment was reversed by Justice
Van Fleet, who says:
We would suggest that upon another trial
of the case each side should put in evidence
the measurements upon which any computa
tion offered by It is founded, unless such
proof is waived by the other side. If the
measurements are before the court, errors in
computation can be corrected. â¢ â¢ â¢ The
judgment and order appealed from are re- i
versed and the cause remanded for â  a iJfcv i
trial.

CAPTAIN MESSER'S CIGARS.
Nine Hundred and Ninety Seized in
His Stateroom on the Trans

Xine hundred and ninety Manila cigars
were found by customs searchers yester
day in the stateroom occupied by Captain
Nat Meeser on the Scandia. The captain
had neglected *o inform the customs au
thorities that he had the cigars, and
played the first part of the Captain James
G. Blame act to perfection. But the ci
gars have been seized and will be sold
unless the captain pays the duty on them,
which will amount to about $75!
The seizure is regarded as a joke on the
captain, for he expressed indignation a
day or two before that warriors should be
obliged to pay duty on Christmas presents
in their luggage, just as If they were
mere shopkeepers.

Wells, who took it from nim and broke
it in pieces.
Detective Egan witnessed the assault,
and placed Saxon under arrest. He

LEES KNOWS NOW
THAT THE TOWN
IS "WIDE OPEN"
The Chief Fearful of
Investigation.
AROUSED BY CALL EXPOSE
COMMISSIONERS SURPRISED TO
HEAR OF POLICE IGNORANCE.
Messrs. Alvord and Gunst Intimate
That They Will Inquire Into
the Gambling and Fix
Responsibility.
CHIEF OF POLICE LEES knows now
that faro, roulette and craps flourish
right here In San Francisco, and ho
Is not grateful for the knowledge.
The expose in The Call yesterday morn
ing of the faro and roulette games in the
Palace Hotel, almost directly over the
spot where the antiquated Chief nightly
pits and dreams of his forty years' serv
ice In the department, and the crap
games that flourish on Market street
without a show of police interference,
gave the old man a severe shock. How
ever, in view of the open assertions of
Joe Harvey's touts that the game was
under police protection, there are many
who believe that the shock was merely
an outward manifestation conjured for
effect, or, if it was genuine, it was due
to the exposure of his own complicity.
Later in the day the Chief regained his
composure In a measure, and, according
to on evening paper, made light of the
affair, being credited with these words:
"There may be spasmodic games start
ed here one day and close ihe next, but
there .-ire no regular ones running- Two
years ago Joe Harvey did run a game in
the Palace Hotel, but it was raided or
driven away. We maintain too careful a
watch for any game to run very long.
A faro layout may be located anywhere
for a night or two. somebody passes the
word around and these who are looking
for that form of amusement are likely
to find it. Same way with crap games.
You can find player?, set them/together
In a few minutes and find a pl*ce to play.
But there are no games running regu
larly anywhere In my district. Sergeant
Donovan has charge of this detail and
would likely find out something about it."
Chief Lees made practically the same
statement to a Call reporter Thursday
night, and at the moment he was talking
Harvey's game was in full blast in the
very place where it had been conducted
nightly for several weeks. It was no
"spasmodic game"; it was fully estab
lished, well known to almost everybody
in town except the police, and there it
would have remained unmolested indefi
nitely had not The Call exposed it. So
far as that part of it is concerned, Chief
L,ees can take his choice of one of two
opinions. Either he must acknowledge his
woful incompetence by reaffirming that
he did not know Harvey was dealing faro
every night in room 937 of the Palace or
he ran admit that he knew what every -
I else knew and by so doing substan
' 'â ations that
ice for im-
asserts that
was raided
nowledge of
ilarly since
the inroads
nf rri' :i!i. decay nr willfully states what
he knows Is not true. Chief Lees knows,
unless the fact has faded from his mem
ory, that all last winter and spring up to
several weeks after the close of the racing
season, Harvey conducted his game In
the Palace regularly, and only closed ft
when an up-country capitalist lost a large
sum at faro and made an uncomfortably
loud talk about it.
The same paper that interviewed Lees
yesterday quotes Sergeant Donovan as
as follows:
"Some reporter in search of a sensation
may have run against an ephemeral
game, but I defy him to point out any
that 18 continuous. I know all the places
mentioned and many more on which we
keep a watch, where games have occa
sionally been played, but that is all there
Is tn it."
Perhaps Sergeant Donovan has his eye
on Billy Schrelber's game at 6 O'Farrell
street. If he has it would not be a .bad
Idea for him to get his hand on It as well.
Schreiber conducts poker rooms over Ca
ley & Roc-dor's at the corner of Grant
avenue and O'Farrell atreet. His rooms
are centrally located and well patronized
by poker players. Occasionally, however,
his visitors express a wish to vaxy the
monotony of poker, and all they have to
do is to express the wish and Schreiber is
ready to accommodate them. He has a
complete faro layout handy and whenever
his guests desire it a "flyer" is dealt for
their pleasure, profitâ and loss. Or if
craps are preferred the little ivories are
soon rolling merrily over the table.
It may be the Chief will seek to escape
the investigation before the Commission
ers that now seems inevitable by claiming
that It was though his vigilance that the
faro game until very recently conducted
in the Royal Eagle, over the Pabst cafe,
was closed, but such a claim would be
false. The game was only run occasion
ally and was closed for want of patron
age. But there are other games Desldes
Srhriebrr's that are running right along,
seemingly without the least fear of po
lice interference, but they are all likely to
suspend for a time now.
Police Commissioners Gunst and Al
vord were greatly surprised to learn
through the disclosures made by The Call
that faro and roulette were running full
blast in the Palace Hotel and had been
for the past three or four weeks, and
other games were in full bloom elsewhere
throughout the city. Their manner indi
cated that they were more surprised tlaat
Chief T.ees should seek to protect tVie
gnmblers by denying the existence of the
game nfter the proof of their operation
had been established by incontrovertible
evidence. While they did not say so in
so many words they intimated that the

head of the Police Department would be
called sharply to account lor the present
state of affairs as well as for his bare
faced attempt to cover up such a j^ross
violation of the law which it is his duty
to enforce.
.%Ir. Gunst was Inclined to resent the
insinuation that he might have been
aware of the operations of the gamblers,
consequently he was not in :t v>
:â â  frame of mind when called upon
bj .i Â«';ill reporter yesterday afternoon.
He was asked what he thoughi of Lees'
tnent that there was no crumbling'
going on in the Palace Hotel, in view
of the facts as published in The Call
terday morning, li'- said in reply:
"I have nothing to say in regard to
that at this time, i am not seeking any
newspaper controversy with Chief Lees.

or any other place he would close them

they move to some other locality and
open up again. The gamhlr-rs sit up nights
and study methods of getting the best "f

gambling in San Francisco compared with
other large cities."
"What about Chief Trees' statement de
nying that there was an? game in the
Palace Hotel?" was asked.
"That appears rather queer, that is a
fact. I shall see the Chief and have a
talk with him about it. The whole mat
ter will be looked into by the Police Com
mission and whatever action is deemed
necessary will be taken."
Police Commissioner Tobin is confined
to his bed with illness and could not be !
seen, but he Is k jwu to be strongly op
posed to gambling, and if Tie is convinced
I that Chief Lees has been derelict In his
I duty he will not hestitate to act promptly

Conductor Hunter's Troubled Run
From Santa Rosa to Tiburon

On his afternoon run from Santa Rosa

A Crazy Chinaman Makes Repeated
Attempts to Kill Himself on
Clay Street.
A Chinese, who was evidently crazy,
caused much excitement on Clay street
yesterday afternoon by making repeated
attempts to kill himself.
When first observed he stood on the
corner of Clay and Stockton streets, and
as a car came up the hill he attempted
to throw himself under the wheels. The
gripman stopped the car just in time to
save him. Apparently not disconcerted
by the failure of his first effort, the Celes
tial swung himself aboard the car when
it started and followed the conductor as
he went forward to collect a fare. When
he thought no one was watching he
climbed over the front and deliberately
threw himself from the car directly in
front of the wheels. The quick action of
the gripman and the steep uphill grade
alone saved the Celestial from going to
his joss. As it was. he received a bad
shaking up, but was not seriously In
jured. A crowd collected near the corner
and watched the peculiar actions of the
man for a long time, but as no police ap
peared he was left unmolested.

LIEUT,HOBSON
IS WELCOMED
BY THOUSANDS
A Public Reception at
the Palace.
THERE WAS NO KISSING
YOUNG HERO DELIVERS AN AD
DRESS FROM THE BALCONY.
The Cotillon Claimed the Young
Officer After the Affair at
at the Palace Was
Over.
The public reception extended to Lieu
tenant Richmond Pearson Hobson at the
Palace last night was a fitting- climax to
the young officer's transcontinental tri
umph. Over two thousand people were
personally introduced to him, but there
was no kissing. After receiving the pub
lic in the large parlor of the Palace for
over an hour and a half, Lieutenant Hob
son made an address to the assembled
multitude from the balcony of the first
floor. It is estimated that there were m
the hotel at least four thousand people.
While twice that number must have
passed in and out during the evening in
their efforts to get a view of the young
hero.
As early as 7 o'clock the crowd began to
assemble, and by 8 o'clock the grand court
was filled, while the crowd began to line
the first, second and third balconies. At 9
o'clock the band engaged for the evening
began to enliven the scene by popular and
patriotic airs, and the music only served
to increase the crowd.
It was shortly after 10 o'clock when
Lieutenant Hobson finally arrived at the
Palace in company with Mayor Phelan
ami Lieutenant Roberts. Mayor Phelan
took the precaution to give the crowd
the slip. He came in by the front entrance
and going down the main corridor took
the Market street elevator to the first
floor. Some one spied the distinguished
young guest, and this time there was no
mistaking the shout of welcome that
went up. The crowd on the first balcony
surped toward the elevator landing,
while the people in the court murmured
loudly at their disappointment.
Captain John Sptliane. with Sergeants
Conboy and Brophy and thirty officers,
had charge of the handling of the crowd.
There were a number of officers on the
first balcony. They kept the crowd out
of the main parlors, while Lieutenant
Hobson was taken in by Mayor Phelan
and presented to the reception committee.
The immediate members of the committee
who assisted in the reception were
Messrs. Ford. Daniels, Harrington, War
flekl. Shea, Newha.ll and Mills. Besides
these gentlemen there were many other
prominent citizens and a number of
ladies.
As soon as Lieutenant Hobson had met !
the committee he took his station in the j
center of the main parlor, with Mayor !
Phelan on his left, and the work of admit- j
ting- those who had cards, and those who
: had not, began. For over an hour and a I
I half the crowd poured in in one steady :
I and continuous stream. There were all i
sorts and all kinds of people. The ex- !
elusive wealth and fashion of Nob Hill
was right in line with the muscle and |
I brawn of the Mission and Potrero.
The people swarmed into the par
lon in such numbers that it was i
found by the committee that it could
not handle them, and the help of Ser
geant Conboy was invoked, but even the
efforts of that officer were useless. After j
shaking hands with Lieutenant Hobson
many remained in the parlor, while some
grot in line as many as thr^e times. See
ing that it was impossible to get the
i crowd to move out. Mayor Phelan eon
j ceived the idea of having Lieutenant Hob
son make ;in address. He was escorted
to the balcony, ami his appearance was
i the signal tor a mighty outburst of cheer
! ing. As soon us order had been restored |
, the young officer began to speak.
In a elnar and reson uit voice tie began
to tell of the trying days when the Amer
ican fU'ft lay before the guns of Morro.
1 First he briefly thanked those present for
, the reception which they had extended
him. and In a modest way declared that
he took it as a compliment to the Ameri
can navy and not to himself. There was
a certain earnestness in the manner in
which Lieutenant Hobson spoke that was
Irresistible.
Tm begin with, ho is a perfect specimen
of manhood â tall, straight as an arrow,
and very handsome. As he began to warm
up to his story the crowd frequently In
terrupted him with rli. its that were so
1 mighty in volume that they threatened
i to lift* t hf roof from the hotel.
HOBSON ADDRESSING THE PEOPLE FROM THE BALCONY.
He briefly alluded to President McKin
ley's recent visit through the South and
declared that the words of fraternal love
he had uttered would be the means of
the final union in spirit and love of. the
North and South forever. Next he mod
estly told of his assignment to his dan
gerous duty and how every man in the
fleet was eager and anxious to go with
him. He described his impressions of the
storming of San Juan Hill as he saw it
from the window of his cell in Morro
Castle, and he naM that the work of the
American soldier in that fight has never
been excelled. Vividly he described the
total destruction of the fleet of Admiral
Cervera, and he paid a high compliment
to the bravery and courtesy of that of
ficer, whom he called a noble cavalier.
Concerning his treatment by Admiral
Cervera, Lieutenant Hobson declared that
he and his men were shown every cour
tesy and that Admiral Cervera wanted to
entertain him as his guest in the fleet,
but General Blanco ordered that t pris
oners should be confined tn Mozm
After the reception the young officer
attended the cotillon given by the Friday
Night Club at Native Sons' Hall.

arrive and general dancing was in or
der. At 11 o'clock the german was in or
der, Mr. Greenway leading alone. Those

"DEAFY" MORRIS, A NOTED
CROOK, ARRESTED.
After Being Disarmed He Throws a
Handful of Pepper in
the Officer's
Face.
Detected in the act of picking a woman's
pocket, in front of the Palace Hotel last
night, "Deafy" Morris, a noted Eastern
thief, attempted to kill Detective Silvey,
who placed him under arrest. As the
detective grabbed him Morris drew a long

throat. Silvey dodged the blow and. after
a short struggle, succeeded In disarming
the infuriated crook. With an oath, Mor
ris quickly placed his hand in his coat
pocket and, taking out a quantity of red
pepper, threw it in the detective's face.
Fortunately the pepper did not reach Sil
vey's eyes. He again grabbed the des
perate thief, and, with the assistance of a
citizen, managed to get him away from
the crowd. He was then taken to the
City Prison, where his name was regis
tered on the small book.
Morris, according to the police, is one
of the most dangerous crooks that has
ever operated in this country. He haa
only one arm. the other, it is claimed
having been shot off while resisting ar
rest.
The detective first saw Morris dodging
through the crowd that stood in front of
the Palace awaiting the arrival of Lieu
tenant Hobson. Recognizing him from
his picture which adorns the rogues' gal
lery Silvey started after him. He saw
him insert his hand into a woman's pock
et, and, grabbing him by the neck, he in
formed him that he was an officer and
that he was under arrest. It was then
that Morns vainly endeavored to slash
his captor.
Morris, although a cripple, vigorously
resisted arrest, and had it not been for
the assistance of the citizen who came to
Silver's rescue he might have escaped.
When asked his name by the desk ser
geant at the Central station Morris re
plied that he was born without a cogno

"You think you've got me right," he
cynically declared, "but I will foil you as
I've done other fly coppers."
Secreted in the lining of his vest was a
small knife, sharp as a razor, which he
uses in cutting open the pockets of his
victims. It is believed that he is wanted
in the East on a more serious crime, and
until the local police hear from the East
ern authorities they do not intend to for
mally charge him.

made that portion of the Mission xamous
for their rowdyism. Heretofore Lock
rather enjoyed the notoriety of the pang
and laughed at complaints when made to
him regarding their antics.
Last night, however, when some of the
gang, headed by the notorious Patsy Bar
man, turned the joke on their boss and
proceeded to give him a taste of their vi
cious proclivities, he took refuge in ms
barn and barricaded the place, while the
roughs tried to break in the doors. Know
ing what was in store for him if they got
inside, he crawled through a skylight and
slid down the roof, making his way to the
Seventeenth-street police station. He met
Sergeant Griffith and Officers McHugh
and Taylor, to whom he told his troubles
They advised him to return and snow
himself to the gang, while they kept in
the background. As soon as Lock was
seen by Barman the signal was given to
go for him. This was being done when
the officers swooped in on them and ar
rested the ringleadersâ Barman, William
Taite and Frederick Burns.
The trio were locked up in the station,
their companions escaping through tha
cattle sheds. Charges of disturbing tha
peace were entered against them.

City Front Whisky Killed Him.
"When the proprietor of the saloon at 126
Oregon street opened the doors yesterday
morning he found the dead body of an
unknown man lying on the floor. The
dead man had probably fallen asleep on
the floor the night previous and had been
locked in by mistake. He had made away
with nearly all the contents of a bottlo
of city front whisky, and his sudden death
was undoubtedly due to that cause. The
body was taken to the Morgue and an au
topsy will be held. The dead man was
about 45 years old and was dressed like a
seafaring man.
