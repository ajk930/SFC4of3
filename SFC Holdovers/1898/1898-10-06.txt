NEW FAST FERRY SERVICE
TO CONNECT WITH OAKLAND
The Pet Monopoly of the Southern
Pacific to Be Broken.
Splendid Plans of the Realty Syndicateâ Exclusive
Passenger Service, Twenty-Minute Trips
and Cheap Fares.
A twenty-minute ferry service between
Fan Francisco and the Oakland shore;
new steel, double screw steamers, built
for passenger service only and to have a
speed that will cover the water trip within
eleven minutes; a complete system of
elc-ctric cars to connect with all parts of
Oakland. Berkeley, etc.; on- fare and
quick service, such is the surprise that a
number of capitalists, under the corporate
title of the Realty Syndicate, have benn
preparing for the people of this city and
those on the Oakland shore.
There have been rumors in the dim past
that somebody would eventually si
need of such enterprise and supply It. but
these paper schemes were baokod only by
wind. This, however, â¢â¢- isiness
proposition, behind which art* s
ss men who know a good thing
when they see it, and who have been
quietly working toward this end for sev
years. They are Just completing
arrangements to go ahead with the
perfection of their great plan and the day
is now at hand when the Southern Pacific
pariy must go up against a hard for

to comprehend the magnitude
of thi te anf show the necessity
for t; â  ihment or a ferry line it
1 that the Realty Syndi
cate owns all the street railroau lines in
Oakland, with the exception of three,
namely, the Haywarda and the Telegraph
and San Pablo avenue lines. In addition
to this it has water front property in
Oakland harbor and tracts of land
throughout Oakland. Berkeley and the
foothills east of Oakland, aggregating
four thousand acres. Emeryville forms
the natural traffic center for the present
and future travel frrm these great sec
tions, and it is prop<f d to so adjust their
street car lines as to deliver passengers
at that point from all sections covered by
tholr system?.
At Emeryville will be constructed a large
"distributing depot," which will form
the termini of the car lines. This is to
in spacious waiting rooms, a good
restaurant, etc. The transportation from
this point to the ferry is to be on a double
track electric road, on one side of which
will be a foot path and on the other a
bicycle path. The cars to be adopted will
be of the largest and best and capable of
a speed of forty miles an hour. As there
will be no freight, mails, animals or gar
bage to handle, the service in the matter
of promptness and efficiency will be in
the style of the elevated roads of New
York.
Some idea of the up-to-date style of the
new candidate for public patronage ran
be gained from the fact that it is proposed
to land passengers from the San Francioo
side in Berkeley in twenty-six minutes,
as against fifty-five now. Piedmont will
be reached In thirty minutes. The present
time Is sixty. The same kind of service
Is to be given throughout the city cov
ered by the syndicate's roads.

or weary delays. Separate cars for lo
cal traffic -will be employed.
The boats, which are to be built of
steel, will be of the latest pattern light
draught, double deckers, with a screw
propeller at each end. They are not to
bo so clumsily designed as the Oakland
and will have seating capacity for
â >pltjf but when necessary will be
able to transport 2000. With twenty-min
ute trips these arrangements will afford
the public the genuine comforts and con
veniences they long have prayed for. The
plans for the boats are now about com
pleted.
The operations of the Realty Syndicate
for the past two years have been

carried on in an unostentatious way, and
there has been a great deal of guessing
as to what many of the apparently queer
moves of the company meant. The fact
that Frank M. Smith, "the borax king,"
was at the head of the institution lent
it particular interest, and when he suc
ceeded in gathering in the California
and Nevada road it was predicted that
he was acting for 'he Valley road. This
was not correct, as the recpnt transfer
of 200 acres of land at Emeryville to the
syndicate by Emery shows. The pyndi
cate wanted the outlet to complete its
big plan.
"While we have been absorbing street
car systems and buying large bodies of
lands in Oakland and the foothills, we
have not been standing an the house
tops proclaiming our plans to the public."
said one of the leading m^n connected
with the syndicate yesterday, "if we had
told our ' objects we would have failed
to get what we were after. As it is. we
have it secured. We have the property,
capable pf enormous development; we
have the street rajlroads to assist in theft
development, and we own the water front
which will enable us to have a direct line
to San Francisco.
"We propose to give the public some
thing the Southern Pacific would never
give them. That is a clean, quick, exclu
sive passenger service, with twenty-min
ute trips. The boats will be of the most
modern style, and it will be a pleasure to
travel in them. There would be many
thousand more people living on this side
of the bay if it were not for those vile
old combination cattle, freight and pas
senger boats of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, with all the disagreeable things
that means to the man who desires to
smoke and must therefore stay on the
emigrant deck. We will give the people
what they want and deserve. Our com
mutation tickets will be $3 per month
and this will entitle the holder to ride
over any of our street car lines to the
farthest end. Single fares will be ten
cents, which will give the passenger the
same service.
"If the Southern Pacific people want to
go under these prices they can do so and
wo will meet them. We will be prepared
to do bo. They have been one of our
worst stumbling blocks. If there was ever
an Infernal lie put in circulation about our
business we could always trace it right
back to Uncle Collis' door. In short the

Southern Pacific has had Its 2000 'knock

throwing mud and bricks at us for the
past two years and we kept still. Now,
we know where we are 'at' and there will
be some 'knocking' done that will land on
that big, unprincipled corporation In a
manner exceedingly disagreeable. We are
about ready to begin the trouble and will
make our official announcement shortly.
"We have acquired all these advantages
without asking the people of Oakland for
a dollar. That shows whether we had the
coin, courage and ability to handle such
large transactions. What else may hap

tem and its connections will be built."

PILLAGER INDIANS ARE
NOW ON THE WARPATH
WALKER, Minn., Oct. s.â The
trouble Brewing between the
Indians and United States of
ficials for the past week
reached a culmination to-day
in a fierce fight at Bog-Ah-Me-Ge-
Shigs Point, thirty miles from Walker.
As a result of the engagement four sol
diers were killed, nine seriously wound-
Ed and several civilians hurt. The en
gagement took place at 11 o'clock this
forenoon and was one of the hottest
fights, while it lasted, ever seen on the
shores of Leech Lake.
Yesterday morning in response to the
requests of the Pillagers Marshal
O'Connor and Indian Agent Tinker
went to Bear Island and had an all
day's conference with the braves. At
the council, which was attended by
about fifty leading men of the tribe, the
officers were told the Indians for whose
arrest warrants are out would not be
surrendered while one of the band was
alive. They returned to Walker and re-
ported the situation to General Bacon,
who had just arrived with a detail of
eighty men from Fort Snelling.
At an early hour this morning. In the
midst of a blinding snowstorm and in
the face of a gale that piled the waves
high, General Bacon loaded his force
on board a small schooner and two
barges and started for Bear Island,
where the Indians were known to be
encamped. The waves threatened to
sink the frail craft on which the soldiers
had taken passage and the men and
officers were benumbed by cold and
drenched to the skin by the spray. .A
landing was effected about 6 o'clock.
After landing a sortie was made
through the bush, but no trace of the
Indians found until nearly 11 o'clock.
The men were then withdrawn to the
shore of the lake and ordered to pre
pare for dinner. Just as the order had
been given to make coffee the first shot
was fired. It came from Bog-Ah-Me-
Ge-Shig's house and struck a half
breed by the name of Ed Harris, break
ing his arm.
Immediately the firing became gen
eral from all directions. At the first
volley three of the soldiers fell and
were carried to the rear. Then, in a
twinkling of an eye the whole line van
ished into the woods, and not a sign of
one of the men in blue was to be seen.
Again the Indians poured in another
volley. This was what the soldiers
were waiting for, and as the Indians
came out of cover and made a rush
toward the troops, the Krag-Jorgensens
bellowed and half a dozen braves fell
to the ground. #
With terrific yells their comrades
again rushed forward and dragged
away those who had fallen.
Lieutenant Mcrriaon, .it *ht head of
twenty men, made a charge on the In
dians, who were carrying away dead
braves, and succeeded in capturing two
of the leaders.
Before the soldiers could retreat
within their line the Pillagers made a
desperate attack and came near rescu
ing the captives. For several mo
ments there was a fierce hand-to-hand
fight, but the superior discipline of the
regulars told, and they finally succeed-

THE AMERICAN EVACUATION COMMISSION IN SESSION IN HAVANA.
HAVANA, Cuba, Oct. 5. â During the Joint seÃSion of the American
and Spanish Evacuation Commissioners yesterday some of the diffi
culties connected with the removal of the Spanish troops were
brought out. The ordinary sailing time between Spanish and Cu
ban ports Is about seventeen days. This Is little likely to be short
General Bacon's Entire
Command Reported to
Be Massacred.
MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 6.â lt is reported here at mid
night that General Bacon's entire command has been over
whelmed by the Indians and massacred, and that half a dozen
newspaper men have shared their fate. Three more compa
nies of soldiers have been ordered to get ready to go to
Walker, and a special train is now making ready for them.
Women and children are being removed from the village of
Walker as fast as possible, and a reign of terror prevails all
through the Leech Lake section. None of the correspon
dents have been heard from since 5 o'clock yesterday after
noon, and only meager reports can be obtained from Brainerd
and the surrounding country. It is feared there is serious
trouble ahead.
Ed in extricating themselves without
loss.
The bucks retreated a little and then,
making another stand, fired a volley at
the steamer Flora, -which had brought
the men from Walker. A shower of
bullets poured into the schooner and
tore through her woodwork, but in
jured no one. They then let fly a vol
ley at another tug, which had been
chartered by a newspaper correspond
ent, breaking the pilot's left arm and
piercing the clothing of Inspector Tin
ker. Marshal O'Connor, who was on
board, escaped only by a miracle, as
the Indians fired the volley directly at
him.
The Indians then withdrew farther
into the timber, while General Bacon
began throwing up earthworks, behind
which he will wait for reinforcements
before proceeding further.
All the afternoon the popping of
Krag-Jorgensons could be distinctly
heard, and the sound of firing did not
cease until after 5 o'clock this after
noon.
The Flora has gone to Leech Lake
for Lieutenant Humphrey and a squad
of twenty men, who had been stationed
there to protect the agency buildings,
and she will probably continue to Wal
ker for Gatling and Hotchkiss rapid
fire guns, which General Bacon brought
with him from Fort Snelling.
There It danger that general upris
ings may be the result of the fight with
settlers. The people are filled with
terror. Many of them are deserting
homes and coming into the city. There
are nearly 1000 braves on Cass Lake
and White Earth reservations, and
though they have thus far been out
spoken in their condemnation of the
Pillagers, there is no knowing when
they may change their minds and don
war paint and feathers. If all the
Chippewas In the vicinity should rise
there would be hot work, and isolated
settlers would undoubtedly suffer.
From an Indian runner in from Bear
Island it is learned that the Indians are
withdrawing from Bog-Ah-Me-Ge-
Shigs Point, and it is now thought they
will make another stand in the vicinity
of Little Boy Lake, where they have
their fastness so strongly fortified that
it will take at least an entire regiment
to dislodge them.
General Bacon, who has had long ex
perience with the Indians of various
tribes, has all along been of the opin
ion that once he arrived on the ground
he would be able to persuade the Pil
lagers to give up without a fight. To
night he thinks differently. The war
like spirit of the old warhorse is at its
height, and he declares he will sweep
every redskin from the island.
If the Indians have withdrawn either
to Little Boy Lake or to the wilderness
farther north it will probably mean an
all-winter campaign, with much at
tendant suffering.
There is a possibility that the Four
teenth Minnesota Volunteers will be
ordered to Walker to guard the reser
voir and give such other assistance to
the regulars as General Bacon, may
stand in need of.
SECOND BATTLE
AFTER NIGHTFALL
"vTALKER, Minn., Oct. 6.â A courier
from the front arrived at midnight. He
says a second battle was fought after
nightfall, but with what result he does
not know.
He says Bacon's men are in a criti
cal situation to-night. Many of them,
it is believed, have been killed r>r
wounded, and unless a rescue party can
ened at this season. Thus allowing time for coaling, provisioning, load
ing and unloading, at least five weeks â will be consumed by each of the
twenty-seven boats on the round trip, transporting say 1200 men on each
trip. Assuming that all of the 100,000 volunteers will stay on the island
the evacuation of 125,000 Spanish soldiers will take at lea** twenty weeks.

reach them in season It is feared the
entire party will be wiped out, if they
are still alive.
A special train with arms and ammu
nition and twenty-five men arrived here
from Brainerd at midnight, and a spe
cial train with several companies will
leave from Fort Snelling as soon as
they can be started and will be rushed
to the island.
SAYS ONE THOUSAND
TROOPS ARE NEEDED
WALKER, Oct. 5.â A statement has
been secured from United States Mar
shal O'Connor. He says that General
Bacon told him he thought it likely that
they would have to remain several
days, and O'Connor thereupon said
he would return here for supplies.
O'Connor started in a skiff for
his steam launch, which was some
distance from shore, and just then the
battle commenced. The troops did not
return the fire for some time. When
ordered to fire they did so with good
effect. Mr. O'Connor says it was folly
to go over there with so small a force,
and thinks it will take at least 1000
troops to restore peace.
A dispatch boat that has just arrived
announces that although they cruised
up and down near the scene of the battle
for two hours, they were unable to see
a man and fear that all soldiers and
officers have fallen. About 100 armed
citizens, including the detachment from
Brainerd, are about to start for ttie
scene.
FIERCE FIGHT IS
STILL IN PROGRESS
MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 5.â A telegram
received at midnight from Walker,
Minn., says: A fierce fight between the
Indians and the troops is still in pro
gress. Marshal O'Connor reports sev
eral fatalities among the soldiers, but
does not give the number. A special
train is coming from Brainerd with a
hundred armed citizens.
CORRESPONDENTS CHASED
BY THE INDIANS
MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 5.â A special to
the Tribune from Walker, Minn., says
in regard to its staff correspondent at
the scene of the Indian trouble: "Have
not heard of your man Beaton since the
fight began at 11:30 a, m. The last I
heard of him he was among the Indiana
with Brill, and was running and the
Indians firing at them. I fear for his
safety, as well as for General Bacon
I and his meÂ». The situation is very
j gTave. There had been a special train
ordered here from Brainerd by the
County Commissioners with soldiers
and ammunition. We have just received
I information from Washington that
more troops are on their way here.
Every one is very much excited, yet
the situation is such as to warrant it."
Another special to the Tribune from
Walker later says: "Have heard noth
ing further from Mr. Beaton. We are2
expecting the special from Brainerd
every minute. Have just been advised
that they -will soon reach- us with thir
ty armed nion and fifty extra rifles and
ammunition."
NEWSPAPER MEN
IN THE BATTLE
WALKER, Minn., Oct. 5.â A hard
fight with the Indians occurred to-day
and the reports from the scene of the
battle, on the other side of Leech Lake,
are somewhat conflicting, although all
reports agree that the result has been
considerable shedding of blood and
some loss of life on both sides. No
word has come from the front for sev
eral hours, which fact Is considered
somewhat ominous.
The most serious report is that the
detachment of troons with General
Bacon was massacred, the general
himself being said to be among: the
dead. Three newspaper correspondents,
Brill of the St. Paul Pioneer Press,
Beaton of the Minneapolis Tribune and
Knappen of the Minneapolis Times, are
known to have been in th* fight, and
one report is that they were killed,
while another says they are now pris
oners in the hands of the Indians. ThlÃ
little town has been full of excitement
all day, and as the reports from the
other side of the lake came in the peo
ple became frantic and efforts were
made to get up a force to go to the help
of the troops. This will be sent in a
few hours, with reinforcements com
ing on a special train from Brainerd.
However, additional soldiers are most
needed, and the feeling is general that
they cannot come too soon.
Brill of the Pioneer Press, Beaton of
the Tribune and the Times correspond
ent had landed prior to the arrival of
the soldiers, a previous experience hav
ing made them believe the danger was
Blight. They were thus brought into
the thick of the fight and fought with
th soldiers. The men on the steamer
saw them in the fight, taking vigorous
part with their revolvers until they
were compelled to tiee, closely pursued
by the painted savages. To-night an
Indian who arrived from Bear Island
stated that all the men out of uniform
had been killed, but that he could not
tell how many BOldiers had been shot.
The outlook at this hour is that the
agency Indians may go on the warpath
at any moment. They have been hold
ing council all night and receiving re
ports every half hour by runners de
scribing the condition of affairs.
Two of the old chiefs want war, but
there are others who are trying desper
ately to stem the tide of discontent and
to prevent any conflict with the troops.
SECRETARY ALGER
ORDERS REINFORCEMENTS
WASHINGTON. Oct. s.â Official dis
patches received here to-night brought
to the authorities the sudden realiza
tion of an Indian uprising of more than
ordinary dimensions. The dispatches
began coming about 6 p. m., two of
them coming to Secretary Bliss, who,
as head of the Interior Department,
has charge of Indian affairs, and a
third to Attorney General Rriggs, from
one of the United States Marshals at
the seat of the uprising. The first dis
patch to Secretary Bliss was as fol
lows:
â WALKER. Minn., Oct. 5.
Secretary of tho Interior, Washington:
The Indians twenty-five miles from here
on the mainland of North Bear Island
opened tire on the troops under command
of General Bacon without warning this
morning at 11:30. I fear the army in the
field is not strong enough to subdue the
Bear Island Indiana. How many are
hurt on their side I cannot now toll. A
large force should be pent here at once.
It is now war, and the Government must
protect the people. I have a slight
â cratch on the arm and left leg. Please
wire me instructions.
TINKER. Inspector.
.Another dispatch from Inspector Tin
ker followed afterward as follows:
To Secretary of Interior, Washington:
Trouble was caused by Indians firing
upon troops tirst; situation as bad as can
be; feeling among Indians hostile and
mean to tight to the end. More troops
needed at once. They cannot get here
too quick. TINKER.
Immediately upon receipt of these
dispatches, Secretary Bliss went to the
residence <>f Secretary Alger and had a
talk with the head of the War Depart
ment as to the military steps which
should be taken. While they were to
gether, a representative of the Asso
ciated Press called and handed them
the press dispatch Riving more extend
ed details of the sanguinary engage
ment between the troops and the In
dians this noon. General Alger read
the dispatch aloud, punctuating it with
his own observations on the gallantry
of the men and the efllcacy of the
Red Cross, the latter being mentioned
in the press dispatch as caring for some
of the wounded. The two secretaries
agrred that the situation had reached
a stage when energetic steps were
needed. Turning to his military aid,
Major Hopkins, Secretary Alger said:
"Take those dispatches to Adjutant
General Corbin and tell him to have
ample reinforcements sent immediate
ly. If need be, have a special train
secured and the reinforcements sent
forward without delay. If it seems
desirable to send along a Gatling gun,
let that be done also."
General Corbin was inclined to be
lieve that the reports were magnified.
General Bacon is the commanding of
ficer of the Department of the Da
kotas, with headquarters at St. Paul,
and the Third Infantry is stationed at
Fort Snelllng, Junt outside St. Paul,
so that, if need be, this large force
could be called to General Bacon's as
sistance. As commanding officer of I
the department, it was pointed out that
General Baron has full authority to
move all the forces within his depart
ment if he deems such action neces
sary to meet the emergency. Aside
Xrom the Third Infantry, there are cay.
ftlry troopa within reach of St. Paul and
the seat of tho trouble, although it was |
the view at the War Department late I
to-night that General Baron would not
have any need for any cavalry, if, inÂ«
deed, he needed :iny infantry beyond
the hundred men now at the front.
General Corbin inclined to the view j
that a hundred regulars were morÂ» j
than a match for all the Indians which j
could be assembled at the place or the â 
present trouble. General Bacon will ,
be given a free hand, however, and
every facility afforded him by the au
thorities if he feels in need of reinforce- |
ments.

ST. PAUL, Oct. s.â Orders were issued
late to-night for additional troops to
go to Leech Lake and 200 soldiers will

MANY GRIEVANCES
OF THE PILLAGERS
WALKER, Minn.. Oct. s.â The Pil
lager and other neighboring Indians of
the White Earth reservation claim to
have many reasons for their present
outbreak, although the direct ' trouble
with the Pillagers came over attempts
to bring in Borne of the Indians to the
United States court at Duluth in con-
I nection with liquor selling cases.
Their grievances go back through
many years and there have been legis
lative and other attempts to settle
them, one of the latest being the Nel
son law regarding the sale of timber on
the Indian lands. However, the In
| dians claimed that the method of dis-
I posing of this was both cumbersome
! and expensive and that they were the
! sufferers. In regard to serving as wit
nesses in illegal liquor selling cases,
they claimed that the deputy marshals
lc't them to find their own way home
' from Duluth without having paid them
the proper mileage. This is denied by
the deputies. The leader in the trouble
1 with the Pillagers is an old warrior.
Bog-Ah-Me-Ge-Shig, not a chief, who
recently returned from court. He
alleged ill-treatment In being turned
adrift penniless in Duluth and aroused
the other Indians to protest against the
way he claimed to have been treated.
The United States Marshal insists that
the old man's story is unfounded, but
I the reds had been stirred up to such a
pitch that trouble apparently became
unavoidable, in view of the dccclv
seated feeling of general ill-treatment
in regard to their timber lands and
their lands and rights in general.

ST. CATHERINE ISLAND
SWEPT BY THE STORM
SAVANNAH, Ga., Oct. s.â The
Morning News correspondent at Hines
villo, the capital of Liberty County,
says that an unconfirmed feport has
| reached Rieeboro, near there, that St.
Catherine Island was swept by Sun
day's storm and that Superintendent
E. H. Heatherington was lost.

GRANDEST RACE
OF THE SEASON
Monterey's Victory at
Los Angeles.
FOUR HARD-FOUGHT HEATS
SIDNEY'S SON WINS AFTER
LOSING IN THE FIRST.
Moringa Steps a Mile in 1:40 Flat,
a Track Record â The Heavily
Sacked Midlove Left at
the Post.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. s.â The big 2:10
trot was the feature of the racing at
the track this afternoon and the man
agement expected a great crowd to be
present. The attendance was a disap
pointment, but the race proved one of
the grandest ever trotted in the State,
four heats being reeled off in 2:10, 2:12,
2:llMs and 2:10%. Monterey, the chest
nut son of Sidney, driven by Pefe Wil
liams, proved the victor after dropping
the first heat to Toggles, the fast
Fresno gliding, which stepped the race
of his career. Great things were looked
for from the winner, but he was unable
to lower his record of 2:09*4.
Of the four running events decided
favorites in the betting captured two.
The maiden plate for two-year-olds fell
to Correct, carrying the colors of "Cur
ly" Shields and ridden by Mike Hennes
sy. Unfortunately in this race the 3-to-5
favorite, Midlove, from the Burns &
Waterhouse stable, was left *t the post.
In the final mile dash Moringa, with 88
pounds in the saddle, skated around the
ring in 1:40 flat, a track record. The
track is as smooth and hard as the sur
face of a billiard table and the air will
soon be permeated with the odor of
liniment.
The five contestants for the 2:10 trot
were called at 1:30. In the auction bet
ting Monterey sold an even-money
choice over his field, but in the books
Toggles was favorite for the first heat.
Galette drew the pole, but the black
mare waa very unsteady and was in the
air when the horses got the word. At
the turn Prince Gift took the pole,
maintaining the front position to the
far turn, where he stepped on a tack
and was passed by Toggles. The
Fresno horse held the lead to the end,
passing the wire over two lengths in
front of the favorite. Zombro was
fourth, behind Prince Gift.
Monterey made such an impressive
showing that he was now an over
whelming choice, both in the auction
pooling and- in the booka. He took the

next two heats without effort, but in
the fourth nearly gave his backers an
attack of wind colic. Soon after the
word was given the chestnut horse
broke, and it was thought to be all over
with him. But Williams picked him up
quickly, and, making up a deal of lost
ground stepped to town the last half
in 1:03, catching and beating ioggies
out a head amid great excitement in
2:10%. But for this untimely break it is
safe to say the winner would have low
ered his record at least two seconds.
The Baldwin filly Celoso, after her
good showing on the opening day, was
picked by the smart ones to win tne
four and a half furlong scramble when
the runners had their inning, She ran
a good race, but at the end was beaten
out easily by Toribio, with post odds ac
I 3 to 1 about him. Roadwarmer, ridden
by Ames and a warm second choice
probably would have been returned the
winner had he net carried the webbing

books. Wheeling around as the barrier
was released and nearly knocking Pow

Correct, a 4 to 1 chance, got all the
best of the mix-up, and, leading all the
way, won easily from EUenwood, a la

third.
The six-furlong sprint went to Shasta
Water, the favorite. Lady Ashley led
until within eighty yards of the wire,

General Boynton said that while there

suspicion of pome of the surgeons con

notwithstanding the analysis showed

supplied. Sometimes pome of the meat
was spoiled, but as a rule It was good.

A more ridiculous method of curing a
man who is suffering from nervous exhaus-
tion and is threatened with nervous pros-
tration could not be well conceived. A man
who has overworked does not need more
work, but less work and more rest. The
man who has lost his appetite needs some-
thing to restore it. The man whose nerves
are shattered needs something to tone and
strengthen them. Get the nerves right and
sound, and refreshing sleep will follow. A
tian who sleeps well ana eats well, and
digests and assimilate* his food will not
remain ill. f%
In cases of this kind Dr. Pierce Golden
Medical Discovery goes to bed rockâ to
first causes. It creates a hearty appetite;
it makes the digestion and assimilation
perfect; it invigorates the liver: it purifies
the blood and fills it with the life-giving
element* of the food. It builds up new
flesh new muscle and new nerve fibres. It
is an ucfailing cure for nervous exhaustion
and nervous ration, and the best of
all medicines for overworked men and wo-
men. An honest druggist won't urge an
inferior substitute upon yoU( thereby in-
salting your intelligence. . . .

NAVAL OFFICIALS
JUSTIFY SAMPSON
NEW YORK, Oct. s.â The Washington correspondent of the Her
ald sends the following^ Had Major General Shafter carried out the
plan of campaign against Admiral Cervera's fleet and Santiago de
Cuba determined upon in Washington and agreed to by him during
his first conference with Rear Admiral Sampson and General Gar
cia, the operations would have been concluded without the great loss
of life which characterized them.
That is the reply which the navy has to make to the Indirect ac
cusations made by War Department officials that Rear Admiral
Sampson is responsible for hastening the departure of troops and
subsequently delaying them. It may be that the investigating com
mittee will deem the matter of sufficient importance to ask Secre
tary Long to submit the dispatches sent by him on the subject, and
to direct that Rear Admiral Sampson appear to give testimony. If
such action should be taken naval officers with whom I talked to
day said that a bombshell will be thrown into the War Department.
They declare they can place the blame "where it belongs"â upon the
War Department and General Shafter.
There is no doubt, as stated in the Herald, that Rear Admiral
B&mpson had urged that troops be sent with all possible dispatch +o
Santiago. This is the full text of Rear Admiral Sampson's dispatch
which the War Department officials expect will show the war
committee that that office Is responsible for the disasters experi
enced by the army:
Secretary Navy, Washington: Bombarded forts at Santiago 7:30 a. m.
to X" 1 a- ni. to-day, June 6. Have silenced works quickly without Injury of
any kind, though stationary within 2000 yards. If 10,000 troops were here
city and fleet would be ours within forty-eight hours. Every consideration
demands immediate army movement. If delayed the city will be defended
more strongly by guns taken from the fleet. SAMPSON.
Naval officials with whom I talked pointed out that the above
and subsequent dispatches foreshadowed what really occurred. The
Spaniards had ample time to bring reinforcements to the city, to erect
additional batteries and to make all arrangements to give a warm re
ception to the invading army.
McKinley nor any one In "Washington
can be held responsible." said the gen
eral with some emphasis.
General Boynton spoke in especial
commendation of the Toung Men's
Christian Association tents, which he
said were the best things In the service.
On the other hand, he condemned the
outside drinking houses, where he saul
much slop was sold that was worse
than whisky.
HON. WILLIAM STRUTT
DROWNED IN A BATHTUB
Was a Son of Lord Belper of Perby
shire and a Brother of the
Countess of Dunmore.
ST. LOI'IS. Oct. s.â Hon. William Strutt,
aged about . rs, son of Lord Belper
of Kingston, Derbyshire, Kngland, who is
a brother of the Countess of Dunmore,
wife of the Scotch peer and lord-in-wait
ir.g to Queen Victor: md dead in
the bath tub in his apartments at the
West End Hotel at ? a. m. to-day. His
body was entirely submerged in the wat^r
: that fiiied the tub. The last seen of the
I young man was at 2 o'clock Monday after
' noon. It is not known what caused death.
! The remains have been moved to the
. Morgue to await the inquest.
The deceased came to this city August
15 and took apartments at the hotel where
he died. He was here apparently on a
pleasure and sight-seeing t^ur. and not
very much was known about him.
The Countess of Dunmore, who Is a
daughter of the Earl ot Leicester, was
I at the home of Mrs. Hyman Clark,
-UL'2 \\>st Morgan street, where she is
: gr with her two daughters, Victoria
; ar.'i Mildred. She was much shocked
I over the cad news and stated positively
that the young man*could not have rom;
; mittÂ»d suicide, lie was subject to Caiat
â  ing spells, she paid, and it was one of
these, she thinks, attacked him in tf.e
water, causing him to drown.
] Countess Dunmore said that Lord Belper
i had been notified by cable of the d<Â»ath
i and w.-iuld start for this country immedi
i ately. She said her party would' leave for
[ England on October 20 and take the re
i mains with them.
The autopsy reveal-:*! the fact that Mr.
i Strutfs lur.gs were full of water am! that
ihe had drowned In the bath tub. Nothing
1 was shown to indicate that he had taken
; his own life.

Admiral Dewey Calls Attention to

Special Dtspatch to The Call.
PARI-,-, Oct. s.â The United States
Peace Commission had its usual session
to-day from 10 a. m. to 1 p. m. The
Commissioners continued the conference
with Major General Merritt and prac
tically concluded an extended canvass
of the Philippine situation.
General Merrltt concluded with a dec
laration cf his Judgment in the matter,
and it may be said that he arrived In
Paris hoping the United States Com
mission would press for the retention of
the Philippine archipelago.
It is also true that the disposition of
the troops in the Philippine Islands, be
fore General Merrltt's departure, was
such and was so ordered as to warrant
the view that a large or complete hold
ing of the Philippines by the United
States was contemplated.
WASHINGTON, Oct. s.â The proceed
ings of the Peace Commission at Paris
may last one month or three. That will
depend entirely upon the view taken
by the American Commissioners of the
situation in Paris. If they are con
vinced that the negotiations are being
conducted with sincerity on the part of
the Spanish Commission there will be
no effort made to force them beyond
reason. But if it should appear that
the Spanish position is not subject to
change; that it is Irreconcilable with
the American demands, ana that the
Spanish, knowing this, are simply pro
longing the proceedings, our Commis
sioners are likely to be promptly re
called.
The Spanish Government Is now ful
ly informed through its Commissioners
of the exact extent of America's de
mands. Whether these are absolute
and not subject to abatement cannot
be ascertained here, for the responsible
officials declare that it will be extreme
ly bad policy to make any admission
on this point. But the Impression in
official circles Is that the conditions are
absolute in their general scope; yet, ;
there may be opportunity for slight
amendment in minor details.
As to these details. Admiral Dewey is
one of the most trusted counselors of
the American Commissioners. He has
not directly suggested that the whole j
group be taken, nor that our claim be j
limited to Manila Bay and the contigu- :
ous territory', but he has called atten- !
to one very important con6idera- !
tion which has seemed to escape gen- i
eral observation up to this time and j
which has been laid before the Ameri- ;
can Commissioners â that is. with all the |
advantages in a commercial way pos
sessed by Manila, the place Is inde
fensible unless Subig Bay be also beld
by the United Staus.
This particular bay Is, on the whole,
remarked as being superior from a
strategic point of view to Manila Bay.
MADRID. Oct. 5. â A newspaper hav
ing declared that Major General Mer
ritt had asserted that the Philippine

EpechU Dispatch to The Call.
SAX RAFAEL, Oct. s.â James G. Ma
guire addressed a medium sized audi
ence at the opera-house this evening
and spoke for nearly two hours on the
issues of the campaign. The speaker
was to have been met at the train by
a committee from the San Rafael Ma
guire Club, but oniy one member, M.
F. Cochrane. materialized. Shortly af
terward J. H. Wilkins, J. W. Cochrane,
T. J. Crowley, Charles Began and M.
C. Dufficy made their appearance and
escorted Magutre to the Hotel Rafael,
> where a banquet was given In his
! honor. The party then drove to the
; opera-house, being preceded by a brass
; band. Fireworks were burned and the
town was illuminated by bonfires.
Attorney J. W. Cochrane introduced
! James F. Manney, the president of the
club, who in turn introduced the
, speaker of the evening. Maguire was
' heartily applauded as he stepped to
; the front of the decorated platform and
1 began his speech. The principal bur
i den of the "Little Giant's" discourse
; was an attack upon The Call. He de
' clared that two reasons why the Re
publican platform was known to be In
favor of the Southern Pacific were that
"it might have been written in the of
fice of Herrin, its chief attorney, or
General Barnes, its subordinate attor
ney," and "the whole ticket was pub
! lished In The Call prior to the conven
tion."
"The Call has answered my charge !n
this respect, " he continued, "by assert
ing that a number of bright young re
porters canvassed the delegates and
made up the ticket. Well, those re
porters must be of very acute percep
tion and would hear of something to
i their advantage by calling at the po
'â  litical headquarters of every party pre
ceding the big conventions.'
Maguire declared that Gage had been
"fooled" into making statements about
the funding bill that made him a laugh
ing stock, and said General Barnes
should have come to his assistance. liv
his opinion "the record of James G. â 
Maguire was clear as crystal." and the I
people knew it to be so. He declared
that the Republican party was pursu- j
ing the shameful policy of trying to ;
gain political prestige by taking to It
self the credit of the war with Spain. >
He added that the party should also â¢
take the discredit of the sickness prey- i
! alent during the war and the money j
; that certain officials must have secures ;
' possession of.
"Mr. Crothers of the Bulletin has as- j
serted in his paper that M. H. de Toung
: had a hand in building the Republican
! platform." he continued, "and every
; man must believe this to De true if the
; Republicans stand for it. M. M. Es
tee, an honest and stanch Republican,
stands by that platform, but refuses
to wander through the State and sup
port such a confidence game from the
rostrum."
Magruire's peroration was devoted ta

Winning Fight in South
ern California.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. s.â State head
quarters of the Republican party for
Southern California were opened to-day

DEMOCRATIC SIDE SHOW
COMPLETES ITS LABORS
The So-Called Non-Partisan Convention Indorses
Only Three of the Repnblican Nomi
nees for Supervisor.
Frank J, Symmes Was So Disgusted With the Actions of
His Associates That He Withdrew From
the Deliberations of the
Body.
The Non-Partisan Convention, now
more familiarly known as the Democrat
ic annex to Boss Phelan's Mutual Admi
ration Society of One Hundred Job Chas
ers, met in Pioneer Hall last night and
completed the work of indorsing the ma
jojity of the Mayor's political pets and
favorites.
The "slate" went through with one ex
ception, and that break was due to the
misguided oratorical efforts of Brother
in-law Sullivan. Police Judge Charles T.
Conlan was one of the four candidates
recommended by the judiciary committee
for indorsement. Conlan received the
nomination of the "Job chasers" after a
hard fight. At one time ho was off their
"slate," but he was forced back again
by influential political friends. In order
to prove that there was no ill feeling
and that the statement subsequently
made by the boss that it was all a mistake
that Conlan's name did not always ap
pear on the job chasers' programme.
Brother-in-law Sullivan arose last night
to throw a few bouquets at Conlan. That
settled the fate of Conlan. He was beat
en out for the place by William G. Burke,
who was looked upon up to thut time as
an outsider In the ran 1 .
When Chairman Fitch called the con
vention to order. A. Sbarboro introduced
a resolution providing for the appoint
ment of a committee of five to examine
into the present judiciary system and
consider the advisability of making some
recommendations to the next Legislature
relative to either increasing the salary
of the Judges, in order to secure more
experienced lawyers to take places on
the bench, or else make the term of of
fice extend during good behavior.
After a brief discussion the resolution
was consigned to oblivion, being relegated
to the table, the majority of the members
believing that no practical result would
follow the appointment of such a commit
tee.
Frank J. Symmes next created a stir by
moving that the rule providing th.it memr
bers of the convention be ineligible to
nomination be rescinded as It was not be
ing observed.
"There is every reason why the rulfc
should be rescinded," said Symmes, "for
It has been dead for the past forty-eight
hours and should be given a decent bur
ial."
"I don't see how we can rescind a prin
ciple," said George dimming. "As a sub
ftltute," he concluded, sarcastically, "I
think that we should adopt something
like this: 'Resolved, when expedient, the
end justifies the means.' Let us be hon
est. Let us throw principle to the dogs
and come out in the proper light."
Joseph Britton rose to remark that he
thought the resolution a very foolish one,
whereupon Cumming replied that he
thought It eminently proper considering
the manner in which the convention had
been acting,
"I don't know that I have a broader or
more delicate conscience than any one
else in this hall," said Symmes. "but I
don't see how men of integrity and up
rightness can put themselves on record
as they have been doing. I, for one, am
not willing to share my one-fiftieth part
of the acts of this convention."
"I object to the convention being lec
tured," exclaimed Joseph Britton. "If
the member wishes to withdraw, that is
his privilege."
"I intend withdrawing," replied Mr.
Symmes, "and I now offer my resigna
tion."
The convention, on motion of Cumming,
who wanted Syiwmes "to stick to It," re
fused to accept the resignation. The sub
sequent proceedings had no further Inter
est for Symmes, however, and a few min
utes later he left the haJl.
On motion of Britton J. P. Dunn was
assured the support of the delegates in his
candidacy for the Board of Equalization.
The auditing 1 committee, consisting of
E. A. Denicke, E. M. Root, W. H. Crim,
Hugo D. Keil and J. R. Howell, was ap
pointed to act as the committee on pu
rity of election.
The indorsement of four Police Judges
was the next order of business. The ju-
diciary committee recommended H. L.
Joaehlmsen, Charles A. Ixiw, Charles T.
Conlan and Finlay Cook. The committee
further reported that it had also con
sidered the names of E. P. Mogan, W.
G. Burke, A. B. Treadwell and Thomas
Graham.
It was then that Brother-in-law Sulll-
van did his bouquet-throwing and
slaughtered Conlah. E. J. Le Breton read
a letter from Barclay Henley indorsing
Burke, and that settled it. If Sullivan
had not spoken the letter would not have
been introduced and the "slate" would
have gone through. Before balloting
commenced the name of Mogan v/as
withdrawn at his request. The ballot
stood: Joachimsen 36, Low 33, Conlan
26, Cook 36, Burke 29, Treadwell 1 and
Graham 2. Joachimsen, Cook, Low and
Burke, having received a two-thirds vote,
were declared the choice of the conven
tion.
There were twelve aspirants for the
five nominations for Justice of the
Peaceâ Frank 11. Kerrigan, George H.
Cabaniss, Thomas F. Dunn, Alfred J.
Fritz, Hull McClaughry, James E. Barry,
Leonard Stone, G. W. Cook, Percy "V.
Long, G. C. Groezinger, Frank J. Burke,
A. T. Barrett and Frederick Hood. The
first five named were "programme" and
were nominated on the first ballot. 'me
vote Btood: Kerrigan 38, CabanlÃS 38,
Dunn 37, Fritz 29, McClaughry 37, Barfy
8, Stone 18 and Groezinger 5. The other
candidates did not receive a vote.
There was a contest over the nomina
tion for Supervisor from the First Ward,
the rivals being Dr. Thomas W. B. Le
land, Ph^lan's candidate, and E. L. Hol
land, the regular Republican nominee.
The first ballot stood: Holland 24, Le
land 16; second, Holland 24, Leland 16;
third. Holland 22. Leland 18. According
to the ruiee of the convention, artftr the
third ballot, tho majority vote nominated.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1898.
Another ballot was taken and it was a
tie vote. Just as the fifth ballot was
about to be taken, Delegate Cummlng
announced that.Leland and his friends
had been on the floor canvassing votes
among the delegates and he said that
he, for one, objected to any such methods.
The roll was then called, and Holland
received the nomination by a vote of 21
to 19.
A motion was then carried amending
the rules so that a majority vote instead
of a two-thirds vote nominated after the
first ballot.
There was no opposition to Stewart
Menzies, in the Second Ward, L. F. Bart
lett, Third Ward, and Osgood Putnam,
Fourth Ward, and the secretary was in
structed to cast the ballot for them.
William E. Phelps and Isodore Gutte
were the aspirants for the nomination in
the Fifth Ward. The first ballot re
sult^: Gutte 21, Phelps 19. On the
second ballot only 39 votes were cast, and
as Gutte received 20 of them he carried
off the nomination.
John Lackmann was nominated by a ris
ing vote as the nominee for the Sixth
Ward. L. F. Byington from the Seventh
Ward and Julius Platshek from tHe
Eighth Ward were next nominated with
out opposition.
L. Altschul moved that the secretary be
instructed to cast the ballot for Albert
Heyer from the Ninth Ward. D. I. Ma
honey presented the name of Eugene P.
Murphy, the Democratic nominee. Seeing
that It would be useless to proceed to
ballot, Mahoney offered no objection when
on motion of Altschul Secretary Milllken
was instructed to cast the ballot for
Heyer.
Jeremiah Deasy from the Tenth Ward
and Dr. C. A. Clinton were then nomin
ated without opposition.
When the Twelfth Ward was reached,
the committee presented the name of P.
F. Butler, the Democratic nominee.
"I don't want him," said Delegate Cum
ming. "but I've got to take my medicine."
"I wish It understood," remarked W. H.
Crim, "that I won't vote for Mr. Butler."
Cumming and Crim "took their medi
cine," for the other members instructed
the secretary to cast the ballot for Butler.
The fact that the convention was noth
ing more than a Democratic side show
was well evidenced last night by the se
lection of the Supervisors. Out of the
twelve Supervisors, the managers only
indorsed three Republicans, Edward Hol
land, John Lackmann and Albert Heyer.
The convention then adjourned sine <J!e
after the appointment by Chairman Fitch
of the following new county committee:
Ludwig Altschul, Joseph Britton, C. C.
Burr, George L. Center, W. H. Crim, H.
L. Davis, Ernest A. Denicke, George K.

LADIES OF THE MACCABEES.
Mission Hive No. 18 Is One of the
Active Subordinates of the Mis
sion District at This Time.
Of the many subordinate fraternal or
ganizations that meet in the Mission dis
trict there are but few, considering the
membership, that Is more active in the
work of spreading the principles of the
order and extending the influence thereof
than Mission Hive No. 18 of the Ladies
of the Maccabees, of which Mrs. Ella Ja
cobs is the lady commander. That hive
at this time has a membership of forty
four, and at the last meeting one candi
date was Inducted into the mysteries of
the order. It is one of the few orders that
is managed from the highest officer down
to the lowest by ladies. Five candidates
will be presented for initiation at the next
meeting. Some time ago the members of
this hive, acting for themselves, devoted
their time, attention and money to help
the soldiers who were at the camps of this
city. As their contribution to the com
fort of the b<"-s in blue they sent to the
camps thirty-four bed ticks, five hundred
and eighty silk camphor hags, besides
bandages and other useful articles. They
felt rewarded f,, r their efforts In that line
by the receipt of a letter of grateful ap
preciation signed by the officers of the
several commands they supplied.
In the latter part of last month Mis
sion Hive celebrated its second anniver
sary by an "at homo" in Mission Opera
Hall, at which (lure was a good attend
ance, and the excellent programme pre
sented furnished a great deal of enjoy
ment for all. A committee in now at work

MORE POP INDORSEMENTS
GRISWOLD - XINNE - GILLESPIE
FACTION STILL IN BUSINESS.
The Fusion Party Municipal Conven
vention Divide Honors 'Twixt
Democrats and Repub
licans.
That portion of the Popullstlc faction
doing business under the name of the Pop
ulist party municipal convention, and un
der the management of the Griswold-
Klnne-Gillespie combination, came to
gether last evening at Washington Hall,
35 liddy street, for the purpose of ballot
ing on the names of those placed in nom
ination on Tuesday evening, and for the
further purpose of placing in nomination
those who had been induced during the
day to submit to indorsement by the con
vention.
Chairman Klnne of the nomination com
mittee, reported little doing in the way
of collections, and also that the crop of
nominees looking for the combination's
indorsement was showing up small in the
reaping,
The fight of the eveningâ and thanks to
the efforts of Delegate Gillespie, it at
tained no alarming proportionsâ was on
O'Donnell for Coroner. It was evident
from the time that Kinne finished reading
his list of nominees that O'Donnell hadn't
dealt when the "buck" was passed to
him and the penalty was to be his turn
ing down.
Gillespie moved that the attempted
Coroner's name be dropped from the list
and that his nomination be returned, as
he had failed to appear and qualify during
the afternoon.
The doctor's henchmen were taken by
surprise at this unexpected move of the
"punh" and were not prepared for a
fight. One promising delegate explained
that during the afternoon he hud called
three times at least upon O'Donnell and
found him unable to leave his office be
cause of a patient who was in need of his
constant attention.
Gillespie disposed of this valid excuse
by insisting upon consideration of his mo
tion to turn down. The motion was car
ried. The plum went to Dr. E. E. Hill,
the Democratic nominee.
The honors of the evening were about
evenly divided between Democrats and
Republicans. Justice of the Peace John
A. Carroll, who was brought on the car
pet by Delegate Gillespie, was nominated
by acclamation.
Kinne's report of business done was the
first matter piven attention after the
minutes had been read.
As a result of the work of his commit
tee the following people were placed in
nomination:
For Auditor. John H. Grady: for As
sessor. John D. Slebe; for Sheriff, Henry
Martin: for Coroner, Dr. E. E. Hill; for
Surveyor, Charles S, Tllton and Bernard
Bienfleld; for Superintendent of Public,
Schools, James Penman; for Judges or
Superior Court. Rhodes Borden, Frank
J. Murasky and J. B. Carson; for Police
Judges. Finlay Cook and Charles A. Low;
for Justices of the Peace, George H. Ca

Howard Black* Fourth Ward, Osgood
Putnam; for School Directors, Dr. A.
Ei cliler, D. F. Keefe, A. A. Cavagnaro,
William A. Kemp and J. N. Thomas.
Upon the completion of the evening's
batch of nominations balloting on the
names of accepted candidates was be
gun. For District Attorney Barclay
Henley was nominated by acclamation,
and for Coroner Dr. Edward E. Hill was
accorded the same honor.
For Surveyor Charles S. Tllton received
113 votes and Bernard Blenfield 31.
Charles A. Low and Finlay Cook were

Daly piece, "The Last Word," which will
play all of this week at the Baldwin.
Miss Bates has scored a prodigious per
sonal hit as the Russian Vera, and several
others of the company are doing record

elty to San Francisco.
The Alcazar's creditable production of
"In Mizzoura" is making out a good Sec
ond week. It gives way to "The Wife" on
Monday.
There is a wild and stirring' patriotic
piece at the New Comedy, called "The
Signal of Liberty," which deals with the
recent Spanish-American unpleasantness
and puts the work of the most lurid war
correspondent to blush.
Morosco's is doing the usual big busi
ness with "The Runaway Wife," a domes
tic melodrama written by McKee Rankin.
Robert Downing, In the arena scene of

NEAD'S PAST RECORD.
W. E. Brown, a Cousin of His Di-
vorced Wife, Calls Upon
Judge Conlan.
Public interest in the case of J. M.
Nead and his wife has not by any means
abated and the result of the hearing be
fore Judge Conlan next Monday is Im
patiently looked for by the persons imme
diately concerned and others.
Yesterday W. E. Brown, a rancher in
Santa Clara County, near Gllroy, called
upon Judge Conlan's prosecuting attor
ney and told him he was a cousin of
Nead's divorced wife. Before coming to
this State he kept a grocery in Parker,
S. D. He said he never met Nead while
in Sioux City, but he knew that Rev.
Isaac Mllburn, Nead's father-in-law,
used to be continually getting him out of
scrapes.
Brown came to this city in the expec
tation that Nead's wife was his cousin,
not knowing that they had been divorced,
and when he learned his mistake he did
not call upon Nrad.
'JOne thing that we all commented on,
said Brown, "was the fact that Nead
never cared to call upon his wife's rela
tives. I remember she called at my store
in South Dakota once and she told me
her husband was outside in a buggy, as
he would not come In with her. 1 went
outside and saw his back and that was
the nearest glimpse I ever got of him.
If I had time to get an answer from my
aunt at Cedar Rapids before Monday I
am sure you would get some interesting
Information about him, but it is too late
now."
AN UNHAPPY COUPLE.
James Prendergast. a traveling sales
man, and his wife aired their troubles
in Judge Low's court yesterday to a large
and interested audience. They made
charges against each other of the vilest
and most Infamous nature, and the wife
became hysterical.
Prendergast was released from the
County Jail Monday after serving a sen
tence of six months for beating his wife.
They met that day and the wife alleged
that he threatened to kill her, and swore
out a warrant for his arrest. While he
was in jail she wrote him sarcastic let
ters that she had another iover and
did not care for him any more.
Prendergast promised that he would
never speak to his wife again nor molest
her In any way, and the Judge dismissed
the case.

UNDER THE FLAME
OF A SACRED LAMP
Nuptials of Miss Rosalie Neustadter
and Clarence R. Walter.
The first important function of the sea
son was the wedding of Miss Rosalie
Neustadter and Clarence R. Walter, sol
emnized last evening at the residence of
the bride's parents, Mr. and Mrs. J. H.
Neustadter, corner of Sacramento and
Van Ness avenue. About two hundred in
vited guests witnessed the ceremony,
which was celebrated by the Rev. Dr.
Voorsanger.
The decorations of the home were ele
gant and elaborate. The entire lower
floor of the residence was placed at the j
disposal of the guests and each apart
ment boasted of a separate and artistic ;
arrangement of choice blossoms. In the
drawing-room an altar was erected and i
white chrysanthemums and true lovers' j
knots of broad white satin ribbons made
it a thing of beauty. Here the happy j
young couple stood while they pronounced i
.he binding words, the sacred lampâ an j
heirloom for the past two hundred years
In the Walter familyâ burning clearly and
steadily over their heads. The bride was
attended by Miss Florence Neustadter,
who officiated as maid of honor, and the
Misses Helen Neustadter and Rose Wal
ter, wh"o acted as bridesmaids.
Herman Walter of New York was best
man and L. W. Neustadter, Henry Eran
denstein, N. H. Neufetadter and Herbert
Walter were the ushers.
The bride wore an elegant gown of
white satin, trimmed with rare and costly I
Point de Venice lace. The regulation j
bridal-veil completed the exquisite cos- â 
tume and was fastened to the coiffure by
a wreath of natural orange blossoms. , Or
ange blossoms also composed the bridal
bouquet.
The maid of honor wore a dainty gown
of white tulle over pink taffeta, and the
bridesmaids were attired alike in pale
pink mousseline over pink silk.
The bridal presents were numerous and
elegant.
Mr. and Mrs. Walter will spend their
honeymoon amid the orange groves of
Southern California, and on their return,
will occupy their new home at 2505 Gougn
street.

SOLDIERS AT THE PLAY.
Members of the lowa Regiment At-
tend the Comedy Theater
in a Body.
That there is enough patriotic fervor
displayed in the "Signal of Liberty,"
which is being played at the New Com
edy Theater on Bush street, was appar
ent by the large number of soldiers who
attend the performance nightly. The
thrilling scenes depicted arouse the great
est enthusiasm and the actors are re
called after each act.
The destruction of Cervera s fleet and
the occupation of Santiago by the Amer
ican soldiers gave 125 members of the
lowa regiment a chance to voice their
feelings last niKlit. The officers and
men tilled th.- difterent parts of the pretty
playhouse and greatly enjoyed th<- pa
triotic piece. The Kansas, Washington,
Ten i' -â  c and California Regiments will
be largely represented on different nights
during the present week.

GREET HENRY T. GAGE
The Republican Nominee for Governor Speaks
to a Large and Enthusiastic Audi
ence at Drew's Hall.
Another Meeting Held at Cambrian Hall at Which the Stand
ard Bearer and Charles L. Patton Address
a Great Throng.
A meeting remarkable for the large
number of voters assembled and distin
guished for the display of unbounded en
thusiasm in behalf of the Republican
cause was held under the auspices of the
Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Asem
bly districts' Republican clubs last night
at Drew's Hall, on New Montgomery
street.
Henry T. Gage, a man of the people,
who toiled and struggled as a working
man lo get his start in life, was especially
glad to meet so many men representing
the Industrial forces of San Francisco.
By their shouts of welcome and the man
ner in which they grasped his hand they
attested their delight In greeting a candi
date who never held a public office and
never drew a dollar from the public treas
ury. The political field is so overrun with
chronic office-seekers and moss-backed
job-chasers that the sight of a man whom
the office is seeking is truly refreshing to
the industrial classes.
A v RSt auOience was assembled before
the time appointed for the meeting to
open. There was no mistaking the char
acter of the assemblage. The audience
was intelligent, earnest and attentiveâ a
keen judge of character and capability.
In a few words, well chosen. P. J- Dona
hue called the meeting to order and intro
duced A. J. Morgenstern. The speech of
the latter was in good form. Dwelling
briefly on the achievements of President
McKinley's administration and unfolding
the prospect of renewed prosperity under
Republican auspices, he aroused a senti
ment of enthusiasm. The name of Mc-
Klnley was cheered frequently. He paid
a compliment to the worth and integrity
of the nominees of the State and munici
pal tickets, and was beginning to point

tered the hall. The shouts of welcome
given to Mr. Gage were repeated several
times, and culminated in three ring-Ing
cheers for the next Governor.
When the applause subsided Mr. Dona
hue introduced the Waterman Sisters,
who sang a captivating campaign song.
The audience was so highly delighted that
another song was demanded, and the sis
ters sang, "Mr. Gage Is All the Rage."
The chairman presented Mr. Gage as
the next Governor of our great and glo
rious State of California. There was an
other outburst of enthusiasm, the ap
plause continuing for quite a length of
time.
Mr. Gage addressed the audience in a
style that caught the fancy of his hear-
ers. The talk was in a man-to-man fash
ion, and when the working people of
that region of the city heard him they
â were convinced of his sincerity. He said:
"I have been sneaking and traveling in
thin State for the past seventy days,
and I pledge you my w^ord that one hour
ago I did not know where I was to speak
this evening. They told me that there
was a worklngman's meeting down here
and I replied 'there is where I want to
speak.' (Cheers;. I have a profound
sympathy for workingmen, because I
know from experience the trials of labor.
I know something of the way in which
the man who toils is oppressed, and I tell
you that if I am elected Governor, and
I will be, I will guard and protect labor
with the best judgment God has given
m<\ (Great cheering.)
"My distinguished opponent, Mr. Ma
guire, says that he Is opposed to rail
road monopoly; so am I. Again, I am op
posed to all kinds of monopoly. I am
opposed to a monopoly of office holding.
My opponent has been holding office for
many years and it Is time to abolish his
monopoly."
Reference was made to Judge Ma
guire's repeated assaults on the charac
ter and integrity of the men composing
the Republican State Convention. Mr.
Oage repelled the calumny In an earnest
and manly fashion, saying: "No man
has the right to question the honor, the
Intelligence and virtue of so large an as
semblage of Americans."
Continuing, Mr. Gage said: "From ray
personal observation of the great meet
ings and intense enthusiasm of the peo
ple in Southern California I can safely
say that the south will roll up the great
est majority for the Republican cause
ever rendered in that region of the State.
(Cheers.) When I see this audience and
feel the inspiration of this magnificent en
thusiasm in a section of San Francisco
â which I am told is the Democratic strong
hold of this city, I have no doubt of the
complete triumph of the Republican
ticket."
Mr. Gage, in a masterly manner, re
viewed the "confusion party," and cited
the dangers to personal liberty and prop
erty rights which the single tax threat
ened. Speaking of the extension of the
commerce of San Francisco and tha de
velopment of markets for the products of
California factories, the standard bearer
mentioned the conquest of the Philippines.
On this point he remarked:
"The Republican party has declared
that wherever the American soldiers, by
their valor and blood, have planted the
flag, there it shall remain." Tremendous
cheers greeted this patriotic sentiment.
Mr. Oape called attention to the evasive
declaration of the "confusion" party on
this American question. A tribute was
paid to the common schools which elicited
great applause. Mr. Gage referred to his
anti-railroad record of twenty-five years'
duration, and pledged his audience that, if
elected Governor, no corporation or cor
porate influence of the railroad or any
other kind should dictate his policy. He
promised to render impartial Justice to
his fellow men.
At the conclusion of the speech the
standard bearer shook hands with hun
dreds of men in the audience. The people
were cheering for Gage when he left the
scene to fill another speaking appoint
ment.
C. L. Patton, Republican nominee for
Mayor, made a brief speech and gained
great applause.
Other speakers were Julius Kahn, nomi
nee for Congress; C. S. Laumelster, for
Railroad Commissioner; D. J. Murphy,
H. N. Clement, H. S. Martin. Howard
Black, Dr. W. J. Hawkins. Edward I.
Sheehan, William A. Deane and Thomas
Graham.
Master Willie Rodle of Sausalito. the
famous boy orator, delivered a fine ad
dress, full of spirit and patriotism. The
Waterman Sisters sang a coon song;
Jabez Swan introduced some vocal feat
ures, and Joe Hansen sang an original
campaign song In fine style. The meet
ing adjourned with three cheers for the
ticket.
AT CAMBRIAN HALL.
The Scandinavian Republican
Club Addressed by Repub-
lican Nominees.
Members of the Scandinavian Republi
can Club and their friends had the pleas
ure of listening to the nominees of the
State and municipal tickets at Cambrian
Hall last night. The meeting was pre
sided over by Oliver Olsen, and musically
entertained by Sam Booth's quartet,
which entertained the audience during
the early part of the evening.
Julius Kahn was the first speaker of
the evening. He was followed by I. J.
Truman, nominee for Treasurer, who
made a short address. H. M. Clement,
nominee for Superior Judge; Thomas K.
Brophy, nominee for the Assembly from
the Thirty-first District, and County
Clerk C. F. Curry, nominee for Secretary
of State, had just finished their addresses
when the audience, by a spontaneous
movement in the rear of the hall, an
nounced the arrival of the next Gover
nor, Mr. Gage, accompanied by C. S.
Laumeister, nominee for Railroad Com
missioner; Charles L. Patton, the next
Mayor, and several other candidates.
Henry T. Gage on being introduced de
livered a short speech, briefly reviewing
the Congressional record of J. G. Ma
guire and his single tax hobby. The
speech was well received, and it was ap
parent from the enthusiasm accorded
him that he had the good wishes and
suffrage of the entire Scandinavian vot
ers with him. He illustrated the injus
tice of taxation on land only, by pointing
out how Magulre's enemy, the railroad
company, would escape taxation on its
rolling stock, bonds, franchises, buildings
and all property except the narrow Btrip
of land over which the road runs. On
the street railroads in all of the cities of
the United States everything goes free
except the car houses and the pieces of
property on which stood the offices and
ticket agencies, while the poor man
would have to pay as much as the multi
millionaire. But of all the anarchistic
doctrines known to the most rabid advo
cate of socialism the one by which a mi
ner would be compelled to give the prod
ucts of the mine discovered by him to
the State was the most preposterous.
This and the one that ali land belonged
to the people, and the father had no right
to transmit his home to his children or
heirs on death, was a something that evi
dently was news to the audience, as they
never had heard of all of the absurdities
of Maguire's single tax theory before.
Mr. Gage defied any living man to charge
him with being a railroad hireling, or
of ever receiving a dollar from the rail
road company. On the contrary, he had
been instrumental in wresting from the
railroad company millions of acres of
valuable land that it sought to take from
the people. This assertion could be prov
en by the court records In the case where
THE SAST FRANCISCO CALL., THURSDAY, OCTOREB 6, 1898.
Gage and Call were the attorneys for the
people.
The short address of C. S. Laumeister
was equally well received. His honest
face and frank manner won for him the
good wishes of the audience from the
time he started until he finished.
The big, good-natured face of the next
Mayor brought the house down with ap
plause as soon as he started in to speak.
He was w.ell received, as were the others
who followed him. They were: Coro
ner Hawkins, D. J. Murphy, W. A. Deane,
H. S. Martin and Thomas Graham.

tle chance of attacks from disease. The old
time remedy enriches the blood, builds up the
muscles, steadies the nerves and Increases the
appetite. Try It.

JUDGE 13TJCK CENSUBED.
San Mateo Democrats Pass a Num-
ber of Redhot Resolutions
at Baden.
At the regular weekly meeting of the
Baden Democratic Club, held at Baden on
Monday, October 3. the following resolu
tions were unanimously adopted:
Whereas, The Democratic party is ever
true to the principles of Democracy, the
leading features of which are liberty of
conscience and freedom of speech; and
whereas, at the County Democratic con
vention held at San Mateo on the 24th
of September not only freedom of speech
but the will of the majority was thwart
ed; therefore, be it
Resolved, That we, the Baden Demo
cratic Club, stamp with the indelible
stigma of our unanimous disapproval the
action of HÂ«n. George H. Buck, as chair
man of said convention â firstly, for low
ering the dignity of the bench by presid
ing over a political convention where the
disputes of delegates) have to be passed
upon; and secondly, while acting in that
capacity for showing bias in his rulings
and acting unfairly between the dele
gates, particularly iA the case of the
county commltteeman from the Baden
Precinct, who was cheated out of the po
sition after the majority had selected
him; and be it further
Resolved, That we heartily condemn
such action as being dangerous to the
Interests of the Democratic party, now
struggling to insure the success of the
standard-bearer of our party throughout
the State.
MIDDLE OF THE BOADSTEBS.
They Have Abandoned the Idea of
Nominating a Local Ticket.
The local middle-of-the-road Populists
â¢who repudiated James Gallagher Maguire
and fusion at Sacramento and nominated
T. W. H. Shanahan, the "tall Sycamore
of Shasta," as their standard-bearer, have
abandoned the idea of placing a municipal
ticket in the field. They Intended ndm
lnatlng a straight out and out Populist
ticket, but the decision of the Supreme
Court recognizing the fusion Populists
and giving them the party name upset all
their plans. The convention was to have
been held Tuesday evening, but the Coun
ty Committee decided to let the matter
rest until a more propitious time.
"There would not be any sense in hold
ing a convention after the Supreme Court
decision." said one of the commltteemen
yesterday, "for our nominees would have
to go on the ticket under another party
name by petition. We fought to save the
Populist party name from use by a gang
of thieving politicians and failed. The re
turns will show next month what strength
the Gillespie-Kinne coterie of fuslonists
has in the State. I for one. and I know
thousands of others who feel as I do, will
by our ballots on November next bury
Maguire and his allies so deep they will
never be heard of again."
RESIGNATIONS ACCEPTED.
Republican Nominees for TTnexpired
Terms Withdraw to Avoid
Confusion.
At the meeting of the Republican Coun
ty Committee held Tuesday night the res
ignations of Henry N. Clement for Superior
Judge, unexplred term; J. B. Cole, unex
pired term for member of the Board of
Education, and A. B. Treadwell, flpr Po
lice Judge, unexplred term, were accept
ed. This was done in acordance with the
wishes of the nominees in order to avoid
having their names appear twice on the
ballot, to the confusion of voters.
The nominations of M. H. Barry for As
semblyman in the Forty-fourth District,
and Patrick Graham in the Twenty
eighth District, were ratified by the com
mittee. All the nominees for the Senate
and Assembly were notified that t.ietr cer
tificates of nomination would be ready for
delivery to them at once.
Mr. Savage nominated A. P. Black to
fill the vacancy caused by the resigna
tion of H. N. Clement, but a motion to
postpone the filling of all vacancies pre
vailed, and the committee adjourned.

MARIN COUNTY'S
FIERCE POLITICS
Interesting Republican
Primaries.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. s.â From To
males on the north to Tiburon and
Sausallto on the south, Marin County
is in the throes of a keen political
struggle. The Republican primaries
held yesterday to select delegates to
the Republican County Convention
called for to-morrow were closely con
tested, and in nearly every precinct
rival tickets were In the field.
In Sausalito there came near being
a riot. There were three tickets in
the first precinct during the early part
of the day and later two of these com
bined against the Dickinson-Pryor
ticket. So noisy was the demonstra
tion and so reckless the language and
threatening action of the opposition
that when the polls closed Marshal
Hannon was called on to take charge
of the ballot box. "Stuffing" was car
ried on so flagrantly by the anti-Dick
inson element that even the disciples of
the late "Boss" Buckley would have
looked on in amazement.
In this city everything was outward
ly calm, but charges of "stuffing" and
bribery were freely exchanged and in
precinct three it was manifest to the
most casual observer that the opposi

tion was not conducting the game ac
cording to Hoyle. It won by the nar
row margin of one vote.
The hardest fights for county offices
this year seem to have centered on the
nominations for Sheriff, District Attor
ney and County Clerk. The contest
for Sheriff lies between William Barr,
chairman of the Board of Supervisors,
and William Taylor of San Anselmo.
Barr's record is advanced by his friends
as the slogan of his battle, while the
others point to the fact that Taylor is
a Native Son, has spent his money
freely to the advantage of the county
and should be given a chance.
City Attorney Thomas Boyd and E.
B. Martinelli, the incumbent, have
locked horns over the nomination
for District Attorney, with the advan
tage all on the side of Boyd, who is
very popular in the outside districts
and has a political record without a
blemish. The lax methods of Marti
nelli in dealing with the faro question
at Sausalito have made him many bit
ter enemies, and even the Sausalito del
egation has to vote against him. Gen
eral Dickinson forced this issue by %,
threat that he would have poolrooms
suppressed by legislative enactment If
Martinelli were not thrown down, and
the local "bosses" had to kneel.
County Clerk Bonneau and Robert
Graham, a conductor on the narrow
gauge railroad, are both Seeking the
office of County Clerk. Sausalito is
for Graham and the two run evenly in
the northern part of the county. The
same conditions prevailed last election
and Bonneau won handily.
From the vote polled yesterday
throughout the county it looks as if
the nominees will be Taylor and Boyd,
with the Graham-Bonneau fight dout)t
ful. All sides are marshaling their
forces for the battle at to-morrow's
convention, and the air is filled with
rumors of compacts and "throwdowns."

WELLS-FARGO TACTICS.
I"*HE court having decided that the Wells-Fargo
Company should pay its share of the revenue
tax, the company has taken an appeal. It mat
ters not that the decision is just, and that none other
could have been rendered without having been a
travesty; it is of no consequent that the company
knows this and was aware of it in advance. Its game
is to evade payment, and delay is a part of the game.
The course of the express company in this matter
has from the beginning been dutrageous. It has
been accentuated by the circumstance that President
Valentine of the concern has been making a pretense,
couching bogus arguments in language so sonorous
and yet so sedate as to suggest that his personality
is awash with a steady flow of piety. The pretense
is that Valentine believes, or ever believed, the statute
providing specifically that express companies should
bear a portion of the war tax really meant that they
should be exempt. Apparently he has discovered a
new Donnelly cryptogram and employs it in the
translation of a law already so clear that only the
hypocrite and illiterate can fail to read it aright.
President Valentine should not thus be permitted
to plant his Pecksnith'an heel upon the patrons of
his company. While the Costley suit has been ap
pealed, the case is one calling for a speedy decision
from the Superior Court, because tardiness would be
as satisfactory to the defendants as an actual verdict
in their favor. Meanwhile other suits ought to be
filed by every person whom the company charges for
the stamp it should affix at its own expense. Such
suits are readily brought, grounds for bringing them
are plentiful, and the company needs a series of ob
ject lessons.
DECEPTIONS IN THE FRUIT TRADE.
IX the course of a well-written and evidently care
fully studied review of the advantages possessed
by men engaged in rural industries in the West
over those following similar pursuits in the East,
the Philadelphia Record notes that fruit men in the
West are particularly fortunate. The statement it
self is true enough, but the Record illustrates some
of the advantages of Western fruit men in a very
curious way. It says:
"In Idaho, for example, the plum trees yield im
mense crops, and agents come all the way from San
Francisco to purchase the prospective crop on the
trees, paying between 1 and 2 cents per pound for
fruit which readily sells for 10 or 12 cents a pound
when dried, packed and sold as California prunes.' It
rarely happens under these conditions that fruit is al
lowed to rot on the ground, as is so often the case
in the East when a glut in the market temporarily
reduces the selling price below the cost of gathering
and shipping the crop."
If that statement is true, it is not easy to see why
the Eastern plum-grower could not put himself on
an equality with the thrifty orchardist in Idaho by
adopting the same practice. If San Francisco fruit
dealers can raise the price of plums by simply mark
ing them California prunes, the Philadelphia men of
the trade might do the same. If the counterfeiting of
California fruit is to be a business, there is no reason
why dealers in all sections of the Union should not
have a chance at it.
The subject is one that would well repay the at
tention of the fruit men of the State. Our producers
have had a long and hard fight to make the value of
California fruit known to the consumers of the East
and to win a general recognition of its superiority.
The benefits of the struggle will be lost, however, if
now that the California label has become an evidence
of good fruit, that label can be placed on any kind of
fruit. If Idaho plums are to be sold as prunes for the
sake of better prices they should at least be labeled
Idaho prunes, and not passed off upon the public as
a product of California.
Possibly the papers which oppose Phelan and his
machine-made One Hundred really have the good of
the city at heart. They have simply failed to grasp
the theory that the only good man is Phelan.
The Delaware detective who came out here to get
Mrs. Botkin nt&y become acclimated and like the
country so well that he will decline to go back there
himself without a requisition.
If the Nead family is what the man and woman rep
resent themselves to be, there is safety in guessing
that the active policeman who arrested them has a
bad quarter of an hour in store.
It is not satisfactory that an Oakland man should
have been acquitted of the charge of selling diseased
beef when he did sell the beef, and it was diseased.
According to accounts, the only way In which the
Empero.r of China did not commit suicide was by
swallowing dynamite and kicking himself.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI.L, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1898.
THE MAGUIRE OF RECORD.
WE have heretofore given parts of Judge Ma
guire's record since he was elected to the
bench by the Democrats in 1882. He could
hardly wait for another campaign to begin bolting
in and out of the party which had given him an office
and a salary. These bolts were not because the Dem
ocracy had abandoned any principle which it held
when he took office under it, but because it would
not abandon those principles and adopt his personal
and fanatical ideas. Finally, in 1886 he bolted, and,
joining Barry, now Democratic candidate for Con
gress, and Hinton, now Democratic candidate for
Railroad Commissioner, and a number of others who
are now candidates, or wanted to be, and are running
the party they bolted then, he put up a ticket in op
position to the regular Democratic ticket and led its
fight. One need not seek far for his purpose in this
final bolt. He sought to destroy the Democracy to
make room for another party, which he intended to
lead. In 1887 the Henry George movement took on
great proportions in New York. Father McGlynn
had joined forces with George, and there arose the
shadow of a schism in the Catholic church, of which
McGlynn would be the leader. It was a dream of
Henry George that this schism would detach a large
force from the church and attach it to his political
fortunes, and McGlynn would be the religious and
he the civil chief of a great movement, which would
revolutionize American politics.
The extremes to which McGlynn went are not for
gotten. He assailed the Pope, and, when reminded
of the obligations he had voluntarily assumed when
he entered the priesthood, responded with the re
mark that he wanted to see a Pope who would "take
off his petticoats, wear a plug hat and walk down
Broadway like anybody else!"
Mag-ire lost no time in getting into the McGlynn
and George procession. As early as March, 1887, he
wrote McGlynn the following letter:
Dear Sir: I have often thought of writing to
you to testify my unbounded admiration for the
course you have pursued in the trying ordeal to
which you have been and are still being subjected.
Though I have never had the privilege of meet
ing you, 1 feel bound to you in a sort of spiritual
brotherhood by the ties of a common devotion to
the principles for which you are now be'nf perse
cuted, and by that touch of nature which la
breathed forth in your public writings.
The inclosed clippings from the Weekly Star
(Barry's paper) of this city will serve to show you
what my feelings and opinions are concerning your
position, and concerning the questions Involved in
your pending controversy. Ido not Bend the clip
pings for their intrinsic value, but merely to show
to you that even at this distance your sacrifices in
the cause of humanity are appreciated, and that
your course is being watched with affectionate ad
miration. Your friends in California are legion, and
your enemies are confined to those who are the ene
mies of mankind. Their enmity is, of course, a lofty
tribute to your character and a strong recommenda
tion of your cause.
Before closing I must add my voice to the pro
tests against your going to Rome to answer for ex
ercising your sovereign rights of American citizen
ship in favor of the Labor party in the late cam
paign. I cannot imagine a more urgent occasion or
a better opportunity for teaching the world, includ
ing the Propaganda, that American Catholics are not
the chattels of the Pope. To go to Rome for the
purpose of answering the charge of having advo
cated and voted in favor of raising all public reve
nue from a single tax on land values would, in my
judgment, be a virtual abandonment of your Ameri
can citizenship.
For. if the decision should be against your prin
ciples and against your chosen party, how could you
submit to the decision and yet retain your citizen
ship?
Submission to a trial involves a submission to
an adverse decision of the question in controversy,
and would seem to be a voluntary act of denation
alization. If not a legal act of sdlf-dlsfranchtsement.
I believe that God has called you to preach and
teach the natural rights of all' his children in the
land, which his bounty has given for the equal use
and sustenance of all mankind, and that henceforth j
your duty to God and to your fellow man lies in this j
nexv service. If the Propaganda should, perversely,
take the other side in the struggle, your duty re- j
mains the swne, and is none the less plain. In the j
discharge or that duty, as I know you will discharge I
it, God will surely sustain you and soon an enlight- :
ened, elevated and prosperity crowned humanity '
will vindicate you.
Let me, then, not as the mere automaton of cus
tom, and not as an idle and unmeaning act of po
liteness and compliment, but in the earnestness of
heartfelt sincerity, subscribe myself, your devoted
friend, JAMES G. MAGUIRE.
These were high-sounding words. Does Maguire
stand by them now? If the Propaganda opposed the
confiscation of land, he impeached it of "perversity."
If the Pope held a priest to his voluntary obligations,
Catholics became his "chattels."
The writing of this letter was almost concurrent
with his letter permanently withdrawing from the
Democratic party because it would not adopt the
single tax plan for confiscation of land, in which he
made use of nearly the same terms employed in his
letter to McGlynn. A few months later he wrote
and Barry published his book on "Ireland and the
Pope." in which he said the Pope was "a serpent,
sinking his fangs in the heart of the spirit of liberty."
This is a country of perfect freedom and toleration.
If Maguire sincerely believed in land confiscation to
the extent indicated and expressed in his bolt of
church and party, what does he believe about it now?
Has the Democratic party indorsed the single tax
confiscation of land that he returns to it and again
seeks office and salary as its nominee, and did he and
McGlynn so cure the Propaganda of its "perversity"
and the Pope of his desire to own several millions of
"chattels" in the United States as to end the con
troversy?
Or is Maguire a mere mouther of words, who
shrinks from the consequences and is ready to shift
his position at any time for an office and a salary?
If God were on the side of land confiscation in
1887, on what side is Maguire now? If the Creator
were against land-owners then, what stronger con
demnation can there be of land-owning as a sin? That
was Maguire's notion at that time. What does he
think of it now?
In his speech to the Delaware Legislature he said
that while single tax would destroy investments in
land and be a hardship on land-owners, it would not
be unjust. Does he still believe this?
Under his scheme of land confiscation investments
in real property are to be destroyed, the owners are
not to have compensation. In 1887 he believed this
to be the plan of the Almighty.
Somewhere in Genesis he may read that, the
famine having borne hard on the Egyptians, they
were constrained to sell each man his land, and
Joseph then bought of each man his land and paid
him therefor, and the land of each man was bought
by Joseph for Pharoah, and thereafter Pharoah did
take a certain measure of each man's corn for rent
of the land which Joseph had bought.
This was the first instance of the kind. It ap
proximated closely to the commune division of land,
bin: Joseph bought and paid for each man's land, and
they were constrained to sell it by the distress of the
famineâ not because their ownership of it was wicked
in the sight of God.
Joseph was as "perverse" as the Propaganda, for he
recognized private ownership when he paid for the
land. Does Maguire feel himself attached to Joseph
in a sort of "spiritual brotherhood?"
The truth about the lowa and Oregon seems to be
that nobody outside the Navy Department knows
where the ships are going, a circumstance which
opens wide the field to correspondents who Kkc to
guess at space rates.
AN UNMASKED "PARTY."
THE thoroughness with which the Non-Partisan
traffickers in City Hall patronage have exposed
themselves during the past two weeks renders
any further speculation as to the purpose of their
existence entirely unnecessary. It was never claimed
, for the Non-Partisans that they represented any
body. The members of their "convention" were ap
pointed by Deacon Fitch, and they hold for life, or
as long as he decrees. They have never been con
sidered in any other light than a. a body of self
selected, respectable citizens, united for the promo
tion of pure politics and good government. Upon
this basis they have exercised considerable influence
in local politics. Their indorsement has constituted
a certificate of character, and as such has been of
value to the candidates of the other parties.
But the hollow pretense upon which the patronage
brokers now in control of the Non-Partisan "con
vention" have been doing business is exploded.
Their campaign this year is being conducted in pur
suance of a patronage bargain with Mayor Phelan,
whose candidates for nearly all the patronage offices
have been taken up one by one and indorsed. The
acme of absurdity in this relation was reached on
Tuesday evening, when the "convention" turned
down Attorney-General Fitzgerald for City and
County Attorney and indorsed a young legal sprig
who is attached to the machine of Phelan.
Fitzgerald is not only a matured and able lawyer,
but his record as Attorney-General has stamped him
as an incorruptible and energetic official. For such
a man to be rejected by a Non-Partisan convention
in order that an inexperienced, half-grown legal lu
minary, who is a stranger to the Supreme Court, may
be foisted into office at the dictation of Boss Phelan,
is decidedly laughable. Some of the Non-Partisans
may well smile at the uncooked nature of their work.
The mask, however, is now completely drawn.
Mr. Fitch's party is a Phelan Democratic sideshow,
and the fact can no longer be concealed. It can
exert no possible influence in this campaign, for the
certificate of character which it has conferred upon
the candidates indorsed means nothing more than
that they enjoy the favor of Mayor Phelan and his
brother-in-law. In some cases it may reasonably be
doubted whether Deacon Fitch is a willing partner
to the arrangements made by the Mayor and his
legal relative, but. being the recognized Non-Partisan
leader, he must be held responsible. Mr. Fitch has
always supported faithful officials. Yet his "conven
tion" has turned down Martin Fragley, one of the
best and most efficient office-holders ever appointed
to an executive position in this city, in order that a
personal friend of Phelan might have the indorsement
of the Non-Partisans for Superintendent of Streets.
Non-Partisanism in the present instance, there
fore, stands only for the political aspirations of James
D. Phelan. It operates merely to give him control of
the patronage of the city, and doubtless he has made
arrangements for an equitable division of results.
What the Republican candidates who have sought
Phelan's indorsement in this ridiculous sideshow
should now do is to make it plain to the people that
Non-Partisanism, as interpetreted by Deacon Fitch's
"convention," is a fraud and a sham. This may be
done by personally informing the few misguided peo
ple who may still be tempted to believe that a Non-
Partisan indorsement means something of the real
nature of the game Phelan and his brother-in-law are
playing.
Now that the mask is off this ought not to be diffi
cult. The Non-Partisans have substantially indorsed
the Phelan ticket, notwithstanding the Republican
candidates possess more approved records, are
stronger and better known, and stand Jiigher in the
community. This is enough to disclose the milk in
the cocoanut. Phelan and his brother-in-law are
bossing the Non-Partisans just as the former bossed
the Committee of One Hundred.
MAYOR PHELAN, HEFTER.
YOUNG WIDBER is apparently close to the
doors of San Quentin. While he was Treas
urer the vast sum of money under his charge
was not counted by Mayor Phelan, as provided by
law. Instead, as is already a matter of local history,
it was "hefted."
Had the Treasurer been a man devoid of larcenous
instincts, had no other thief had access to the vaults,
"hefting" might not have been of serious result. In
deed, were everybody honest there would be no need
of making even a periodical estimate of the coin on,
hand, but only to keep account of expenditures.
The peculiar method adopted by the Mayor made
a theft possible. It placed in the way of Widber a
temptation to which he could never rightfully have
been subjected. Had he known the coin would be
counted, the fact would have served to check him.
Had the safeguard to which he was entitled, and
which the community had a right to expect, been
thrown about him, he would not now be a felon, a
confessed and almost shameless robber. The Mayor's
"hefting" was Widber's undoing. Not that the ex-
Treasurer is to be held in any measure blameless.
Yet there is no merit in giving a rogue an oppor
tunity. "Hefting" was the opportunity; Widber was
the rogue.
But the Mayor seems, unconsciously, to be carry
ing the "hefting" process into politics. Here is his
Committee of One Hundred. He has "hefted" the
lot and is satisfied with them. He professes to think
the men of his personal choice competent to run the
Democratic party, and asks the entire city to become
a part of the machine of which he is engineer. There
are signs of dermir, and the Mayor has thereat a feel
ing of vague unrest. The people want to pass upon
the qualifications of that committee themselves. They
have no faith in Phelan as a "hefter." They know he
is prone to err. Furthermore, they do not under
stand why, if the Mayor has faith in his machine
made One Hundred, he should not permit them to
act with some degree of independence and not try
to be the whole thing himself.
The Bulletin makes a strong intimation that money
spent to secure its support would be thrown away.
A little more such frankness as this and somebody
will accuse the Bulletin of being honest in spots.
A man who went to a cabin near Redding for
something to eat was shot by the owner. Consider
ing that he got nothing to eat, and is likely to die,
the penalty seems almost too severe.
James R. Keene recently made $1,500,000 in a week.
This shows what industry will do. Every toiler
should be stimulated to renewed energy.
"Coin" Harvey has been selected as, chief herds
man of the nNock of the discontented. The chances
are even more than 16 to I that he scores a failure.
Something evidently has happened to the Emperor
of China, but just what it is seems to be a bit of in
formation deftly corraled by the censor.
The fact that bankers do not look with favor upon
popular loans will not change the general opinion
concerning such loans.
A FIELD FOR
MILLIONAIRES
Editor Call, San Francisco: On the
13th ult. you kindly published my ar
ticle showing the impropriety of the
people of San Francisco advocating and
the injury the completion of the Nic
aragua canal would be, not only to
San Francisco harbor, but also to the
whole Northern Pacific coast, and
while I endeavored to raise the alarm
and point out the dangers threatening
the very existance of that city, I con
sider it a poor alarmist that cannot
present a remedy, in a measure at least,
to overcome these dangers. While the
Nicaragua canal is a venture of vast
magnitude, many Avell informed men
consider it utterly impracticable, and
I will premise by saying if undertaken
like the Panama canal it will prove a
monumental failure, at least during the
present generation. Perhaps, Mr. Ed
itor, you may call to mind the reason
given by the great engineer, De Les
seps, when asked why he did not choose
the Nicaragua route for a canal in
preference to Panama. He answered: "I
have had the Nicaragua route explored
and find the approaches to it both on
the Atlantic and Pacific sides utterly
impracticable. On the Pacific it must
end at an open roadstead on the Pa
cific Ocean that would cost a thousand
million dollars to make a safe harbor
for shipping; and on the Atlantic, from
the north of San Juan River to deep
water, a distance of some twelve to
twenty miles filled in with sand and
debris, caused by the wash of the river
on one side and the action of the Gulf
stream, raising in the Caribbean Sea
and sweeping up through the Gulf of
Mexico, throwing sand and silt upon
the other, would entail a perpetual out
lay in dredging that would cost more
than the revenues of the canal to main
tain." I can readily see why the pres
ent owners of this canal stock and
bonds would like to see Uncle Sam take
the thing off their hands. It wpuld
no doubt be a splendid speculation to
unload it on the taxpayers of the
United States, and what a nice lot of
American millionaires it would make
at Uncle Sam's expense. In all the
estimates I have ever seen made of the
cost of the canal, I would candidly ask,
Did you or any one else ever see an
estimate on the cost of approaches to
it? I admit I never did, and I would
suggest to our law makers and states
men to at least make careful inquiry
on that point for the benefit of the dear
people, and I will venture the predic
tion, which may be called the emana
tions of a crank, that if this stupen
dous fraud is ever forced on the United
States Government it will be the political
grave of more American statesmen and
politicians than ever the Panama canal
was to De Lesseps, his associates and
the French people, who deluded their
countrymen into advocating it.
Thankiner you kindly for publishing
my former article and also the Wood
land Democrat, and other papers that
copied it, I am respectfully yours,

A NON-PARTISAN
PIECE CLUB
Editor Call: I was pleased with your
timely editorial this morning on the
work of the Non-Partisan "Piece Club."
I am sorry to say piece club, but it i 9
entitled to no other name. How stanch
old-time Republicans like Henry L.
Davis, George K. Fitch, E. A. Denicke
and others can be so bamboozled and
made such rank suckers of as is be
ing done at present is beyond the com
prehension of one of ordinary intelli
gence. The smaller "fry" are not to
be wondered at, as the task for get
ting little minds to use as catspaws to
nominate Democrats Is as simple as
two and two. Take, for instance, that
high-minded public citizen, Charles B.
Perkins, who is so frequently on his
feet everywhere and who nominated
Phelan for Mayor before the conven
tion had organized. Perkins is domi
nated by Robert McElroy (as they run
a church together). Robert McElroy
is the manager of the Phelan block.
So it goes, a wheel within a wheel, till
decency holds above its head an um
brella to keep the shocks of these
would-be reformersâ like sunstrokesâ
away. Out with such rot. Can it be
possible they for a moment think the
intelligent voter is going to be the tail
to a Democratic kite this year? I have
hitherto been allied with the Non-Par
tisan movement but the Phelan-Sulll
van-McElroy-Perkins conglomeration
is a trifle too nauseating for

COL. IRISH AND HIS ADDRESS.
To the Editor of The Call: Your
Alameda reporter in his account of
Colonel Tobin's address to the Uni
tarian Club took occasion to say that
It was an answer to my attack on the
administration as to the colonial policy.
My address was delivered before the
war closed. It was a calm statement
of constitutional principles and of cer
tain physical facts which mark the
tropics as unfit for colonization by
Anglo-Saxons.
Neither the administration nor Its
policy was mentioned. Indeed, if the
administration had any policy on that
subject at that time the country was
uninformed of it.
Under the circumstances the obvious
malice of your reporter is incompatible
with the fairness which ie plainly the
policy of The Call.

TO ENGLAND.
Brothers, who face with us the boisterous

That, through the storied, Immemorial
With buffets of sharp 'salt and mighty

Full of reverberations, we seem deaf.

Breathed under the Atlantic for our cheer.
Ah, yes, we hear them, and they nerve

The grip upon the saber and the hands
That keep the grim-lipped guns in ready
leash! .
From salutations such there comes a
thrill
Filling tense veins with ancient battle jdy
That thrills a lineage bright with daring
deeds.
The sons of men who heard Will Shakes
peare speak.
Whose fathers were with yours at Stam
ford Bridge,
When Saxon Harold made the Derwent
red.
But not with blush for England; we who
trace
From those old sea kings whose swift gal

King Philip's proud "invincibles" a myth;

New rights as old as Freedom's honored

In human hearts. We offer stintless

For your great giant souls like him just

Shorn of old bondage; watch with glisten

Your ancient cross spread freedom In the

If Afghan bullets stain a Highland plaid,

Because we were too patient. Eager never

NOT A LEAP YEARâ J. L., City. The
year 1900 will not be a leap year. If a
year were exactly 365Â»4 days long 1 there
â would be a leap year every four years;
but as there is an excess of 11 minutes
10.3 seconds each year, this excess is com
pensated for by dropping the leap year at
the beginning of three out of four cen
turies and thus equalizing the time gained
through the century. The length of time
thus established makes an error ofi only
one day in 3325 years. Of the years con
cluding the centuries, and known as the
hundredth year, such as 1800, 1900, only
every fourth is a leap year, commencing
with 2000 such as are divisible by 400â
that is to say, 2400, 2830 and so on.
TWENTIETH CENTURYâ A. K. D.,
City. The nineteenth century will close
at midnight on the 31st of January, 1900.
and the twentieth century will commence
with the year 1901. It takes 100 years to
make a century, and the century does not
close until the 100 years have? been com
pleted. This question, which has given
rise to much controversy, is best illus
trated by stating that a smoker pur
chases two boxes of cigars containing: 100
each. He takes cigars from box 1 until
he has emptied it, then he has used 100
cigars. When he takes a cigar from box
2 he takes cigar No. 101, and is in the sec
ond box; so it is with a century. When
the first 100 years were terminated the
next year became the first of the second
century, and was year 101.
RED, WHITE AND BLUEâ H. A. W.,
Sacramento, Cal. The prevailing fashion
of red, white and blue stripes on barbers'
poles is not according to the original, but
is the idea of some patriotic barber whose
name has been lost to history. In former
times the barber served his customers â
or, in fact, any one elseâ as surgeon, and
when cupping and bleeding were exten
sively carried on, the barber was in the
habit of performing in that line. That
his place of business might be known, he
used to display at his door a pole on
which was affixed a small brass bowl, and
below hung strips of red and white cloth,
the red symbolizing the b^o-vtl tht>t w;<9
let from the patient and the white the
bandage, while the bowl represented the
vessel in which the escaping blood was
caught. Subsequently the pole was paint
ed alternately with winding stripes of red
and white, and a gilt top supplanted the
bowl. When barbers ceased to be cuppers
and bleeders, the striped }x>le which had
become so familiar as the sign of the
place where the barber was. was retained,
but, as before stated, some one added a
blue stripe to make a patriotic display.
INSURANCE PREMIUM-A Potrero
Reader, City. If the insurance associa

plan of mutuality, then you must have
signed the constitution and by-laws and
you are bound by them. From the infor
mation given in your communication it is
apparent that you are responsible for the
extra assessment, and your failure to
meet that assessment carries with it a.
certain penalty. The association could no
doubt commence an action against you
for the amount due. Ii*Â»Â»ou have nothing
but your wages the law of this State
says:
The earnings of the Judgment debtor for his
personal services rendered at any time within
thirty days next preceding the levy of execu

debtor's affidavit, or otherwise, that such
earnings are necessary for the use of his family
residing In this State, supported In whole or In
part by his labor, are exempt from execution,
but where debts are incurred by any such per
son, or his wife or family, for the common
necessaries of life, the one-half of such earn

to satisfy debts so incurred.

ALONG THE UPPER YUKON.
TACOMA, Oct. 5. â Canadian police are completing the establish
ment of a chain of police stations along the Upper Yukon from
Dnivson City to Lake Bonnett. The sfations are about thirty miles
apart. Captain Harper, commanding the Northwest Mounted Po
lice, has detailed five men for each post. The steamship Canadian
on her last trip up the river carried police for all the posts between
Dawaon City an<l "White Horse Rapids. Soldiers for the balance of
the stations probably will be supplied from this end.
Each station has supplies for two years and numerous dogs. The
soldiers are to carry dispatches and facilitate the forwarding of
mails, and are instructed to assist all travelers, of whom from 6000 to
8000 are expected to come out over the ice.

SAVANNAH, Ga,, Oct. s.â News from
the storm-stricken districts along the
coast is coming In gradually, and it is
probable that a hundred lives have been
lost. News by way of a boat which ar
rived to-day is that fifty people were
drowned at Ferdinandina.
From Campbell Island, inhabited by
about forty colored people, it Is reported
that all but three were drowned. At
Brunswick four people lost their lives,
and at Jessup. 100 miles from the coast,
one man was killed by a building blown
down by the storm.
At Sterling Station Charles Wright, a

flood to lives and property in the
rice fields and in a portion of Glynn and
Mclntosh. There are a number of small
islands at various points around Bruns
wick, Ferdinandina and Darien on
which small groups of families lived. It
will be some days before accurate re
ports are heard from these points. At
Darien the water is reported high and
the town's buildings damaged.
The damage by wind and rain is enor
mous and extends inland 100 miles in
Borne cases. The damage to shipping
is also great. Near Darien the schooner
Blanche Hopkins collided with a small
schooner, the Minnie, and sank her. The
Minnie had on board 3000 pounds of
dynamite. At Ferdinandina the tug
Gladiator is said to have landed in the
midst of the town. Mrs. Lucy D. Car
negie's magnificent yacht, Dungeness,
is badly damaged. The Cumberland Is
land pUotboat, Maud Helen, was landed
high on a bluff in Fairbanks yard. The

â A, is on shore at Jekyll Island,
near Charleston. The Jekyll Island Club
launches landed in the clubhouse yards
and the water has destroyed much of
the clubs property.
On St. Simons Island, along the beach
lined with summer resort cottages, the
tide wrought devastation. Reports are
that all the cottages have been wrecked.

PARTJAL VICTORY
FOR "BOSS" REA
Court Knocks Out One
Count.
DECREASES SUM SUED FOR
JARMAN CANNOT GET MORE
THAN $25,000.
In His Answer to the Amended Com
plaint the Defendant Accuses
Other San Jose
Officials.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. s.â The demurrer to thÂ«
amended complaint In the Jarraan-Rea
; slander suit was overruled In regard to
i the first count and sustained as to the
second count by Judge Kittredge this
morning. This Is a partial victory for
Rea and knocks out 125,000 of the amount
of damages asked by Jarman
The court held that in the first count
the words "There were $900 paid on the
purchase of the steam roller and you re
ceived $400 of it" were slanderous in them
selves, and the matter would be left to
the jury to further ascertain the intent
oi the meaning of the words.
In sustaining the demurrer to the sec
ond count Judge Kittredge claimed the
words were not slanderous as used. This
count was based upon a conversation Rea
h v w L lh S - Â°- Tompklns in which he
charged Jarman with having robbed the
ci t. v while a member of the Council
The defendant's counsel were then given
until 4 o'clock to file an answer to the
first count of the amended complaint. The
hearing on this will come un_to-morrow
morning It is along the usual lines and
denies the facts set forth in the com-
In all probability the trial will now pro
ceed on the first count without further
interruption. For those slanderous re
marks $25,iX)0 damages are asked.
Rea's answer to the amended complaint
!Is unique and interesting. He makes a
general denial of the charges and then
goes on the relate the "political history"
he has been threatening to divulge during
the trial. It states that on May 14, 189*
and prior thereto, the defendant was
"deeply interested in the election of good
and capable men to fill the position of
Councilmen in said city."
Before Jarman was nominated for
Councilman the defendant induced and
solicited plaintiff to become a candidate
upon the express understanding and
agreement that he would not unite or
combine with Councilmen Dittus or
; Krit-g; that he. informed Jarman that
Dittus and Krieg were not good, capable
and honest men. Yet, in spite of his
warning, Rea alleges, Jarman did com
bine with Krieg and Dittus.
Rea also alleges that one Sunday night
prior to the annual election of police and
| firemen of San Jose, Jarman, Krieg, Main
and Dittus met at his house in order to
select capable man for places; that Krieg
took the defendant to one side and in
formed him thai an agreement could be
reached if said defendant would pay the
sum of $1000, and that Krieg said if the
sum was paid, he, Dittus and the plaintiff
would agree on the various policemen to
be elected.
At another time, the defendant alleges,
at the request of C. M. Hatcher, he spoke
to the plaintiff about having property be
longing to the Rhinehart estate put out
side the fire limits so the burned build
ings could be rebuilt of wood. The an
swer alleges that the plaintiff said it
j could be done, but "that he would not
j vote to do so, unless he obtained the
i painting of the buildings to be erected
! without competition;" and thereupon said
! premises were put outside the fire limits.
Rea tells his old story of the purchase
| of the steam roller, and as a new feature
charges Councilman Krieg with having
received $300. He says J. H. Maggard
told him that while the city paid $3750 for
the roller, hia company had received only
$3000; that $750 had been paid to Council
men and that Krieg got $300. Rea al
leges that he then asked Maggard what
became of the remaining $4dO, and the
latter informed the defendant that he did
not pay the same to other members of
the Council, save and except the plain
tiff, whose name he refused to discuss.
From these alleged facts the defendant
avers that he verily believed Jarman not
to be a good, capable and honest man and
the statements made by him were spoken
without malice and In good faith and to
the electors of the city for the purpose
of advising them of the plaintiff's real
character and qualifications for office
and that, therefore, the words uttered by
the defendant were not slanderous and
were privileged communication.

THE SAST FEANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1898.
SENATOR QUAY
HELD FOB TRIM.
Must Answer the Charge
of Conspiracy.
EVIDENCE GIVEN IN COURT
SHOWS THE ALLEGED USE OE
THE STATE'S MONEY.
Sweeping Denial Made by the Ac
cused in Which He Says There
Is No Foundation for
the Prosecution.
Special Dispatch to The Calf.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 5. â United
States Senator Quay. Richard R. Quay
and Charles R. McKee of Pittsburg were
this afternoon held in $6000 bail each to
answer at the next term of- court to the
i charge of using the State funds deposited
I In the People's Bank for their individual
! prottt.
The testimony produced by District At
! torney Graham was in the shape of about
twenty letters and numerous telegrams
covering a period from September, 1897,
to February, 1898, addressed by Senator
Quay to Cashier Hopkins, directing the
purchase and sale of large blocks of
stock and arranging for the placing of
margins; a letter from State Treasurer
Haywood to the president of the People's
Bank; a letter and telegram from Hay
wood to the cashier of the People's Bank,
and a private memorandum book of Cash
ier Hopkins.
The District Attorney averred that the
evidence he produced showed that Sena
tor Quay had the use of $200,000 of the
State's deposit of over $500,000 in the Peo
ple's Bank; that State Treasurer Hay
wood placed $100,000 of State funds In the
People's Bank on condition that the
amount of money be loaned to Senator
Quay's son; and that there was a regular
assignment of interest on State deposits
in the People's Bank to certain accounts,
one-third of it going to Mr. McKee, all of
which he claimed was a violation of the
State law prohibiting a bank official from
| making such transactions, and that the
accused persons were guilty of conspiracy
in Joining with Hopkins in these transac
tions.
The courtroom was filled almost to suf
focation with politicians, newspaper men
and lawyers. â
All through the ordeal Senator Quay
; bore an air of composure. He prompted
j his lawyers frequently and passed Judg
ment on every point raised.
The Senator to-night, in response to an
inquiry for a statement by a reporter of
the Associated Press, said:
"I think that no one who was present at
I the hearing to-day entertains any doubt
| as to the truthfulness of the charge boldly
made by my counsel, that this proceed
ing was" instigated by political enemies of
mine, who hide behind the District Attor
ney and will not permit him to reveal
their names, and that their sole purpose
was to manufacture campaign literature
by false charges that could not be met
and answered except on a trial in court.
"As to the charges themselves I have
simply this to suy. that they are absolute-
Ily false and wholly without foundation. I
have always had an account with the
i People's Bank, and have frequently in-
I structed Mr. Hopkins to have brokers buy
for me stocks which I thought were likely
to rise in value, but they were always
bought with my own money or upon my
own credit, and upon thoroughly good col
lateral, and the People's Bank was al
ways amply protected for any loans I
obtained from it. Not a single share of
stock was tvTT bought for me either di
rectly or indirectly with public money, and
my letters, which were offered in evidence,
themselves clearly show this. Nor did I
evÂ»-r have the use or benefit either direct
ly or indirectly, to the extent of one penny
of the State's money on deposit in the
People's Bank. Nor did I ever obtain
from the bank the loan of a single dollar
because of the deposit with it of the
[ State's money. Nor do I owe the People's
i Bank a single penny, for every dollar I
ever borrowed from it was promptly paid I
by me at maturity. â¢
"As to my son's transaction, which was |
perfectly legitimate. I had nothing what
ever to do with it, except that, having
full confidence in his ability to pay the
loan at maturity. I indorsed his paper and
it was fully paid at maturity."
CHEATS THE GRIM REAPER.
Charmed Life Borne by the Wife of
an Alturas Freighter.
ALTURAB. Oct. s.â An accident, the re
sult of which can be regarded as almost
miraculous, befell Mrs. Jasper Janes of
this city. Mr. Janes Is a freighter be
tween here and Amedee, and on his last
trip was accompanied by his wife. They
were seated upon an elevated seat and
traveling at the freighter's usual gait.
Suddenly one of the wheels struck an ob
stacle of sufficient size to Jar Mrs. Janes
from her high station.
In the course of her downward fall Mrs.
Janes slid over the forward part of the
wagon and landed In the road immedi
ately in front of the wheels. Mr. Janes
was unable to stop the team before the
wheel had passed over his wife's pros
trate form. When he assisted her to her
feet he found that she had escaped un
injured. The wagon weighed a ton at
least, and the only explanation of the
woman's narrow escape from death is
that the road is covered with rocks and
the wheels were, more or less, raised by
them.
DEATH IN THE MILK.
Product of a Yolo Ranch Sold in Sac-
ramento.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. s.â At the meet
ing of the City Board of Health last night
Milk and Food Inspector Dr. Megowan
reported that a herd of forty dairy cows
on the Perkins ranch, Yolo County, twelve
miles north of here, has for some weeks
bfen afflicted with anthrax or splenetic
fever, and that half the herd have died
and been buried near the surface of the
ground.
One dairyman in this city 1b reported
to have been using and selling milk from
the afflicted herd. Dr. Megowan's report
was corroborated by Dr. Henderson, local
member of the Btate Board of Health.
This disease is known to be as fatal to
human beings as to cattle. The doctor
will to-morrow visit the Yolo Supervisors
and ask to have the diseased herd quar
antined. Hogs that had eaten the car
casses of the dead cows have also died.

BURDENSOME STATE TAX.
Concerted Movement at Stanford to

that will be arranged later. Their efforts
will be centralized on the constitutional
amendment providing for the calling of a
new constitutional convention. It is
thought that me new convention would
give them relief. The Daily Palo Alto has
taken the matter up, and the college will
begin its campaign at once.
Appropriate resolutions have been adopt
ed by the Alumni Association and will be
sent all over the State.

CHURCH ARRAIGNED
BY DR. CHAPMAN
Says It Is Responsible for the Ex
istence of the Saloon in
California.
STOCKTON, Oct. s.â The second day's
session of the Congregational Association
was opened this morning by Rev. Fran
cis W. Reid of Clayton, and fraternal
greetings were sent to the meeting of
the American Board, in session at Grand
Rapids, Mich.
The question of temperance was intro
duced by Chaplain Rowell of the Mari
ners' Church of San Francisco, who stat
ed that the drinking in the camps at
Tampa and elsewhere was responsible for
at least three-fourths of the sickness and
death before Santiago.
Dr. E. S. Chapman, president of the
Anti-Saloon League of Northern Califor
nia, spoke on the liquor traffic and ar
raigned the churches for the existence of
the saloon in California to-day, for the
churches, he said, were certainly respon
sible for what they could prevent.
"The Narrative of the Churches" was
then read by Rev. J. R. Knodtll, giving
condensed reports from one hundred and
thirty-two churches In Northern Califor
nia. It was found that nine had erected
church buildings, thirty-four made exten-
Blve repairs, six had built parsonages,
twenty-five had purchased new books and
hymnals and ten had paid off large in
debtedness. While many had experienced
hard times, an made cheerful reports and
looked forward to better times. Six hun
dred and eighty-six had been added to the
roll during the year, and general attend
ance had been good.
The American Missionary Association,
which works for the Indians and negroes
j and Chinese, was represented and pre
sented by Rev. B. F. ~nrgent. Miss Rosa
Lamont and Mrs. S. M. Dodge. The Chi
nese Association Home in San Francisco
cost about $30,000, of which $10,000 remains
to be paid.
Rev. H. H. Wykoff told of the need and
work of the Church Building Society. Of
the 440 churches on the Pacific Coast, 350
had buildings, and 277 of these were built,
by the aid of this society, 140 of which
were the iirst to be built in the field.
Miss Peck, missionary from China,
spoke in an interesting manner upon
"Glimpses of Woman's Work in China."
Following her address Rev. Henry Fair
banks, missionary from India, spoke upon
the conditions of women in that country.
The officers of the Women's Home Mis-
I sionary Union then took possession of tho
platform. Mrs. E. S. Williams of Sara

FRATRICIDE CLARK
MAKES CONFESSION
Declares His Brother's Wife Had No
Connection With the St.
Helena Murder.
SAN QUENTIN, Oct. s.â ln the shadow
of the gallows George W. Clark, the St.
Helena fratricide, has confes-^d that he
and he alone Is responsible foÂ» the mur
der of his brother. Clark is to be hanged
on Friday of next week. His crime was
an atrocious one, he having murdered his
brother because he was enamored of tho
latter's wife, and hoped to marry her.
The confession is made in order to clear
the woman of the suspicion that attached
to her. It Is as follows:
To All Whom It May Concern â I, George W.
Clark, Incarcerate, believing that I am about
to die, and sincerely desiring in these, my last
days on earth, that the truth with reference
to the specific crime with which I stand
charged, and for which I am soon to suiter
death, shall be known, do hereby solemnly
state that I am and I alone am guilty of the
same. That no one, save myself alone, was in
any way Implicated In the same, either be
fore or after the fact, and that the same was
wholly plotted, planned, arranged and exe
cuted by myself with the knowledge or con
sent directly, or indirectly, of no one save my
self only. I makÂ« this my last statement more
particularly with reference to and to exon
erate one Mr*. Liavlna Clark, then wife, and
present widow of William A. Clark, now de
ceased. I positively aver that she was not Im
plicated therein In any shape or form, and so
far as my knowledeg goes, had no knowledge
or suspicion thereof. G. W. CLARK.

TELLS WHAT HE
INTENDED TO SAY
Chaplain Mclntyre Had
a Thick Tongue.
HAD BEEN TAKING BRANDY
DID NOT INTEND TO CRITICIZE
ADMIRAL SAMPSON.
An Expert Physician Testifies That
a Drunken Man Generally
Says What Is On His
Mind When Sober.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, Oct. s.â When the court
martial which is hearing testimony in
the case of Chaplain Mclntyre of the
Oregon was called to order this morn
ing the cross-examination of the de
fendant, which was begun yesterday,
was resumed.
In answer to the question of the judge
advocate regarding what he intended to
say in his lecture about the of
prize money the chaplain explained that
Commodore Winfleld S. Schley was the
first commander he ever sailed with. He
felt very friendly toward Commodore
Schley and believed that he should have
received the major part of the honor
and emoluments of the battle. He in
tended to say to the audience that the
division of the prize money would be
In the proportion of $10,000 to the ad
miral, $500 to Captain Clark and $75 to
officers of his own rank. He had no
idea of giving these as the amounts
each would receive.
The witness said his intention was to
say that when the battle began the Ore
gon took her assigned position on the
inner line, as she did bo passing the
lowa going the other way to assume
the position assigned to her. He in
tended to say that when tho Colon sur
rendered he saw several of the Ameri
can vessels half-hull down to the east
ward, and that while the boarding
parties from the Oregon and Brooklyn
were going to the Colon the other ves
sels came up. He declared that he
made no assertion to the effect that
Admiral Sampson reported himself
within four miles in order to get prize
money. He was aware that the ad
miral was entitled to his share of the
prize money, regardless of his distance
from the fight.
Chaplain Mclntyre on redirect ex
amination stated that he had the
brandy of which he drank on the night
of the lecture in a four-ounce bottle.
Indicating on a similar bottle the
amount he drank it was shown that he
took about one-third of the contents.
Alonzo A. Anson, an engineer, testi
fied that he was quite intimate with
Chaplain Mclntyre in 1894, and that on
the night of t.ie lecture the chaplain
did not recognize him even after he had
told his name. Witness thought the
chaplain had the manner of a man un
der the influei.ee of liquor. During the
lecture the chaplain's manner was not
natural.
Dr. H. T. Pershing, physician in
charge of insane and nervous patients
at the Arapahoe County Hospital, was
called as an expert. He expressed the
opinion that a man in the physical and
nervous condition of Chaplain Mcln
tyre who took eighteen grains of qui
nine and over an ounce of brandy
would become intoxicated. Witness
said the effect of intoxication is to re
move restraints in action and speech.
In most cases what an intoxicated man
says has some relation with what he
thinks when sober.
Sir Charles Dilke writes about the
Czar's peace union and the Anglo-
American alliance in next Sunday's
Call.

BAKERSFIELD, Oct. s.â Abe Turner, a
machinist in the Southern Pacific shops at
Kern City, and Peter Grijalva, an appren
tice, while rapairing a band this morning,

EASTERN MARKET&
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Oct. s.â Speculative attention
was directed to the American Sugar Refinery
Company's shares to-day by the cut in price
In the various grades of the product. Advices
from the sugar districts were that dealers were
holding oft" In expectation at further reduction
and that a lively war In the trade was looked
for. Wall street received the various develop
ments with some concern, as it was felt that
renewed liquidation in sugar would tend to de
prive the market of the outside support which
it was now experiencing and that the efforts
which were mailing to sustain various special
ties would be abandoned. Subsequent develop
ments, however, served to reassure the "street"
as supporting orders were placed all around
and the drop in sugar of three points to 112
was without appreciable effect. The firmness
of the general market coupled with open buy-
Ing of other Industrials by a leading Interest
brought about a late rally of two points in
sugar. Irregularity was quite pronounced dur
ing the day, and the list gave little semblance
of strength except for a brief interval at the
Ft art. and again In the late session. The ab
sence of a decisive tone led to the cancella
tion of some commission orders, and London
also alternately bought and sold. Local trac
tion stocks displayed a good tone. Tobacco re
sponded readily In either direction to the usual
assortment of rumors respecting the status of
negotiations with the 'Western manufacturers.
People's Gas, after a period of neglect, loomed
In prominence and bounded up ! on reportsof
an amicable adjustment of recent difficulties.
Fluctuations In the railway stocks were con
fined within narrow limits, except In one or
two cases. Northern Pacific common making
an early conspicuous display of weakness. Im
provement In grain prices, coupled with the
heavy export demand, exerted a sustaining In
fluence on the Western shares which offset the
frequent gyrations of the specialties. Final
dealings were characterized by strength, bet
net changes are irregular.
A brisk demand developed for the bond issues
of reorganized properties and those In process
of rehabilitation, but realizations In Denver
and Gulf firsts wiped out the improvement. To
tal sales, tS.BGO.OOft
Government bonds were unchanged all around
in bid prices.

There was a sharp rise In Grand Trunk by
clique buying and the market was caught short
of stock. Spanish fours and Portuguese se

solidation of Anaconda with another mine is
denied In good quarters.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. Advices from Liverpool
reported wheat steady. Notwithstanding the
extreme weakness here yesterday, it wu still
snowing a little In North Dakota, and a good
many light-weighted bears In the speculative
crowd went short over night. It was under
such circumstances that a firmer tone was
imparted to the market. at the start. Decem
ber, which left off last night at 61* c bid,
started at from 62c bid to 62@Â«2V4c and there
were buyers of October at Uc over December.
New York began even stronger than Chicago
and Duluth showed considerable bullishness
in the cash wheat trading, an advance of lc
a bushel being noted soon after the opening.
The superior strength at those points excited
a little emulation here and during Its display
December advanced to 624Â®62%c.
The aggregate at the chief Western primary
markets fas 1.947,000 bushels, oempared with
1.499.000 bushels a year ago. Exports from the
Atlantic and Gulf seaports were liberal but not
large enough to be of much help to longs, the
sum total being 445.000 bushels. Shippers re
ported some Inquiry from the East for wheat,
but generally at unworkable prices. One lot
of No. 2 red was reported disposed of early
In the day. but at a price not made public.
December kept within the range of 62 and 82V*c
the greater part of the day, but became
stronger near the end and closed at 624 c, at I
which figure quite a good business was done.
Corn ruled firm and higher. . Reports from
the country, especially Nebraska and Kansas,
were almost unanimous as to poor results of
husking.
A good demand for the cash article on for
eign â  account, together with an advance in the
other grains, strengthened oats.
Heavy selling by commission houses In ad
dition, to a large run of hogs and lower prices
at the yards caused a heavy feeling In pro
visions the greater part of the day.

Harrison's circular says: "Since the Moana
left there have been the following deliveries of
coal from Newcastle, N. S. W., vis.: Pericles,
2067 tons; CJifTnrd. 3434 tons; Mario, 1930 tons;
Bundaleer, 1238 tons; total, 5669 tons. There
are at present under charter to load coals for
here from Australia thirty-three vessels of
about 80,000 tons capacity; of these, ten are
now afloat and twenty-three are yet to be
loaded. Three months ago there were forty
three vessels chartered with a tonnage capacity
of 115,000 tons; this evidences a marked shrink
age of recent engagements. The high c >st of
colonial grades Is graduall-- driving some of our
large fuel consumers into other channels on the
ground of economy. Crude oil is beginning to
again assert itself as an pmnomic steam pro
ducer. The latest cabled freight quotations on
coal from Australia report a firmness for this
year's loading and gradual declining rales as
the months advance Into 1599. Seasonable
rains for this and next month will seriously
disturb present asking prices; recent showers
omen well for us
"The coast collieries are generous shippers,
hence a cessation of Australian deliveries
would not cause a fuel famine here, as our
northern mines are equipped to further In
crease their output to make good any deficit
that may arise here. The colonial managers
appear to be In no wise solicitous for our trade,
as they propose advancing their f. o. b. prices
fully 15 per cent after January 1."

THE STOCK MAKKET.
Mining stocks are somewhat firmer, and Hale
& Norcroes, on the strength of the Supreme
Court decision, sold up to $1 25. But the affairs
of the company are still far from being settled,
so dealers were uncertain whether to take hold
of the stock or not, and there was not much
business at the advance.
There -was no particular change In local se
curities, and trade was up to the average in
volume.

GRAND JURORS
HUNTING FOR
CASH BAIL
Constables and Jus
tices Under Fire.
SOME TELLTALE RECORDS
BAIL MONEY VANISHES WITH
THE PRISONERS RELEASE.
The Second Trial of Deputy Consta
ble Dowling. Under Indict
ment for Perjury, Ha?
Been Concluded.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
t. 5.
The Grand Jury has started on a chase
after lost cash balls, which the records
cf some county and township officials
show ought to bo somewhere, but which
in reality cannot be found. Evidently no
one is responsible for the disposition of
cash bail that was put up in several cases,
and according to the evidence an: one
can fix the ball to suit the occasion.
For several days the Grand Jury has
been Investigating the conduct of Con
stables and Justices of the Peace, and to
day Constables Glaze, Cramer and Weid
ler. Deputy Sheriff Lane and Justice Law
rence, besides Supervisor Ta-leott and
others were subpemied and questioned
about points of irregularity bearing on the
discoveries iaado by Expert Dunsh in
the records.
Two cases have attracted the particular
attention of the Grand Jury. In Febru
ary, 1896. A. L, Edwards and a young:
woman from San Francisco were rested
for disturbing the peace on the. county
road by Constables Glaze and Cramer.
They were placed in the County Jan, ana.
Jailer Lane's books show, wore atterward
released on $10 cash bail each. The case
was entered on Justice Lawrence s docket,
but there does not appear a word as to
the disposal of the $2"J. . _ _ ..
"It is absurd to suppose uiat I would
let any one off on tlo cash bail in such
cases." said Justice Lawrence to-day. T
generally fix it at $100 bond or $1V cash
bail. I don"t even know who nxed the
ball in thin; case." ,
Another case is that of the arrest of
John C Wood by Constable Glaze on a
charge of vagrai-.cy. The defendant put
up $5) cash bail and the complaint was
fifed in Justice Cliffs court. Judge Clift
does not know who entered the case on
his docket; who rixed the bail, or where
the $20 went. The money is being traced
by the Grand Jury.
Deputy Constable Richard D>wiir.g's
Eecond trial on a charge of perjury was
concluded before Superior Judge Ells
worth this afternoon. Dowling was in
dicted by the Grand Jury for making oath
and swearing to a complaint In Justice
Cliffs court on June 1. 1898, against Ed
Carr and another tramp named Ramsey;
and that he arrested them In a box car
outside of the city limits. The prosecu
tion contended that the men were ar
rested at Sixteenth-street station, Inside
the city limits, over which Oakland Town
ship Justice Clift has no jurisdiction.
The jury went out about 4 o'clock and
at midnight stood eight for acquittal and
four for' conviction. At that time they
were locked up for th-e -lit until 9
o'clock to-morrow morning.
A PECULIAR ACCIDEiTT.
Heavy Door of a Safe Breaks Sud-
denly From Its Hinges.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 5.â A peculiar accident
took place In the postoffice this morning,
which narrowly escaped having serious
results. The valuables of the place are
kept in a great double-door safe, standing
about six feet high. Deputy Postmaster
Marston opened these doors this morning,
and then instead of going to his deck.
which stands directly in front of the safe.
he stepped a few inches to one 6ide. A3
he did so. without a particle of warning
one of the doors fell with a crash to
the floor, both hinges having broker.
short off. As the door fell it struck the
front of the desk used by Mr. Marston.
smashing it into pieces. Had he been In
his customary place he must have been
terribly injured and perhaps killed, as
the door weighs nearly half a ton. Ex
amination of the broken hinges showed
that one of them had an old crack in the
metal. This is supposed to have been
caused years ago when the safe in ques
tion went through a fire in San Francisco.
It was not badly damaged, and was re
paired subsequently. There was no way
of discovering the crack in the iron.

TAX ORDINANCE
NOT APPROVED
By THE MAYOR
Vital Questions to Be
Decided.
TRUE STORY OF THE LAKE
CLUB MEMBERS PROPOSE TO
GIVE A LARGE PARK.
"No Time for Monkeying," Says the
Mayor, When He Reviewed
the Important Matter
Before Him.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 5.
It is comparatively certain that Mayor j
Thomas will not sign the ordinance
passed by the Council fixing the tax levy
at $1 21. Some close figuring has been
done, and It is found that the bare cost
of maintaining the city government and
the schools, provided they do not cost
one cent more than last year, will not be
provided by the ordinance, but will leave
a debt of $75,000. This can only be avert
ed by closing the schools a certain tinge;
by leaving the streets uncleaned and un
repaired; by closing the Free Library and
by crippling every department of the city
government.
In addition to this the whole of the an
nexed territory, which contributes about
$40,000 In taxes this year to the city treas
ury, will be left without so much as a
sprinkling cart.
Mayor .Thomas has given the Council
men notice that he Is studying the ordi
nance in detail, and that when he is ready
he will call a special meeting and sub
mit his message to them. Ho will re
quire assurance that none Of the munici
pal funds will be left in such condition
as to cripple the departments. The head
of every department has already assured
the Mayor that the levy is thoroughly
impracticable, and consequently it will
be sent back to the Council without the
Mayor's approval, and possibly with his
The proposition regarding the improve
ments of Lake Merritt has not yet been
put before the public. The members of
the club have formulated plans which
will greatly enhance the attractiveness,
the health and the value of a large por
tion of the city. They have acquired title
from the Water Front Company, by pur
chase, to all the marsh land between
the Government harbor line south of the
Eighth street bridge and Twelfth street
dam which amounts to about twenty
acres, and is at the present time a most
objectionable sight. The plan includes
the building of a bulkhead on the east
ern shore of this mudbank, leaving a
channel of sufficient width between the
private property line and the bulkhead.
Through this channel dredged to suffi
cient depth would pass daily the ebb and
flow of the tide between the estuary and
the lake, which is necessary to flood the
main lake sewer. The whole of this tract
will be deeded to the city by the club
it now standing in the name of one of
the membersâ as soon as it is evident
that the contract for dredging the lake
will make it certain that the tract will
be filled in by the mud. This plan also
Includes the taking away entirely of the
Eleventh street trestle, which would
go directly through this twenty-acre
park, and transferring tHe electric road
to a special track to bo built on the
south side of the Twelfth street dam,
which would be widened to permit of
such a change.
The club on the one hand wants positive
assurance that the work will not be dis
continued by the next Council which
takes office on April 1, and, therefore,
they want the whole appropriation of
S&O.uOO included in this year's levy. On
the other hand, the taxpayers demand
that there shall be sufficient money to run
the city in a decent manner.
This is the situation the Mayor and the
city government face, and it is one of
supreme interest to every taxpayer and
citizen of Oakland.
When asked for his opinion this after
noon Mayor Thomas said: "I am think
ingâdeeply thinking. The Councilmen tell
me that in some manner or other the
money will certainly be forthcoming to
run the different departments if I allow
their levy to become a law. 1 rind out
that there will be about $75,000 of a short
age, and I have not yet found out the
'somehow or other' manner in which it
can be obtained. I do Dot want my term
' of office to expire next March with the
schools closed, the free library and read
ing rooms closed, and the city heavily
In debt, and 1 want these gentlemen who
have prepared this levy to prove to me
; that such will not be the case.
"I am told that the proposed ordinance
i licensing every merchant and professional
man will bring in the necessary income.
This ordlnar.ee is not yet passed, and
1 Judging from the opposition It has aroused.
I cannot se-e much hope for it. A state
of affairs now faces the city government
'â  which requires much care and thought. It
' is not a time for mountebanks to play to
i the gallery, but it is a time for earnest
1 and "cautious action. As soon as I am
ready I thai] call the Council together
and deliberate with them."

AN UNSOLVED
MYSTERY IN
SEWER BILLS
Two Payments for
One Job.
NOBODY CAN EXPLAIN IT
AFTER MANY DAYS SOME CASH
CAME BACK.
Contractor A. J. Raisch Now Won
ders How the Duplication
of Bills First Oc
curred.
In Auditor Broderick's annual report
appears an Item under the head of "cred
its to Street Department fund," as fol
lows: "Refunded, $416 22." That is all,
but there Is a story connected with it.
Some six years ago A. J. Ralsch was
a deputy in the office of Street Superin
tendent Gilleran, and at that time ac
quired a knowledge of the fat profits
which accrue to the man who Is able to
obtain contracts for constructing city
sewers and pavements. Three years later
found him in business as the San Fran
cisco Paving Company. In fact he was
after the contracts as a whole corpora
tion and two separate individuals besides.
Bids flowed in for street work from A. J.
Ralsch and W. C. Raisch and the afore
said San Francisco Paving Company, In
all of which it was commonly reported
that A. J. had a direct Interest.
The city wanted a sewer â out on Cali
fornia streetâ and A. J. or W. C, or the
San Francisco Paving Company wanted
to build it, either one, or all three.
The Bewer was built. It is there now.
but who built it, or how many
men or companies built it, remains to
this day a dark mystery, A. J. thought
that he built it, and he presented a bill
for some $416 22 on acount of the con
struction. The City and County Auditor
allowed the Jill and the Treasurer paid
it. This was over two and a half years
ago. A short time afterward another bill
fur $416 22 coming in from the Raisch
combine was audited and paid and no
body noticed that it was for the same
w^rk that had been paid for previously.
Neither A. J., nor \V. C. nor the Paving
Company apparently noticed the double
payment. If either had suspected for a
moment that two payments for the same
job was being exacted of the city there
can be no manner of doubt but that one
and all of them would have loudly pro
tested against receiving so much extra
cash from the Treasurer, and would have
compelled him to desist from a double
payment. But no one noticed it and the
city paid just twice, but no more. Many
months drifted by and the error was not
corrected. Finally some six months ago
an inquisitive man happened to cast an
eye over the duplicated demands in the
Treasurer's office and wonderedâ to the
ultimate profit of the city. He asked
some questions at the city building and
then started in search of one of the
Raisch partners. During the conference
which followed the contractors' books
â were called upon for evidence and, lo:
the mistake was found.
No grass was allowed to grow before
\V. C. Raisch dropped into the office of
City and County Treasurer and "aid in

LUMBER RAFTS,
SALVAGE SUITS
AND WRECKERS
Trouble Brewing Over
the Derelicts.
AFTER THE LOG PILE
WHITELAW WILL ATTEMPT TO
BRING IT TO PORT.
Captain Frank Morley, Who Was
â¢ Nearly Killed on the Navarro
Fifteen Months Ago, Is
About Again.
It now looks as if there wore groin? to
be considerable litigation over the dere
lict lumber and log rafts that have been
drifting around, a menace to naviga
tion, for over a -week. The portion of
one of them that went ashore at Santa
Cruz has been olntmed by the Bibb Lum
ber Company, and should the half which
anchored Itself five miles off Pigeon
Point be brought into port it also will
be claimed by the owtirrs. Its arrival
â¢would not be hailed with delight by them,
however, as the rafts were only injured
against "total loss," and the waiving of
a portion would relieve the underwriters
of any liability. It looks as though there
were salvage and insurance claims ga
lore in prospect.
Captain Bridgett of the steamer George
Loomis was close to the raft last Tues
day, and took an excellent photograph
of it He says It is securely anchored
off Pigeon Point, and shows no sign of
breaking up. It is over 250 feet long, and
there must be at hast 120 tons of chain,
attached to it. The chain Is worth about
2% cents a pound. That one item figures
up $6800. The piles are worth at least
$3 each and their value will probably to
tal up $25,000, po there is a small fortune
a.t anchor awaiting some one.
T. P. H. Whltelaw, the wrecker, is go-
Ing to try to secure the derelict. It did
not take him long to get his wrecking
BChooner Catalina in working order, and
yesterday morning he chartered the Red
stack tug Monarch and made a start.
The Catalina has a supply of dynamite
aboard, and when the derelict is reached
It is the Intention to send a diver down
and place a charge of the explosive un
der the chain that is anchoring it. The
chain will be blown away frum the hold
ing ground and then hauled aboard the
Catalina. The Monarch \\i\i then take
both raft and schooner in tow and make
another attempt at bringing them into
Ban Francisco.
The fishermen are not at all displeased
with the state of affairs. The "i:
to navigation" does not bother them so
long as they can pick up a Â£"jd pile,
â which they can sell for $7 50. every time
they go outside. At least one-half of the
outside fishing ::â¢---: has gone int.) the
business and almost every hour In the
day when the tide suits, the boats can
be' seen coming in with a pile in tow.
As p<"<n as the prize is made last at Fish
erman's wharf the boat la headed out
to sea again in search of more pilesâ not
fish The gasoline fishing boats an- r. ap
ing the best harvest, as they can bring
In two or three of the piles each trip.
Captain Howard and Major Long. I
8 A paid a visit to the transport Sen
ator yesterday. They looked her over
from 'stem to stern and noted ;t number
of alterations that will have to be made
before the steamer goes to sea again.
The Boldlers' quarters will be improved
by the removal of a number of berths,
and a place for the men to move around
in during the day will be provided. The
Senator will go on the dry-dock to-day,
and will pr n > ;n to-mor
row It v, ill take about ten days to get
her r^a.'.y to start again lor Manila., SO
that it will probably be Monday we^k
before the soldier boys at the Presidio
get an order to move. Ihe next man
to Manila leaves by the Gaelic on the
11th inst but it will probably only just
get there in time to tHi the boys the Sen
ator Is coming.
Captain Frank Morley was on the water
front agaii. yesterday for th. tlrst Ume
in over a year. He met with a terrible.
accident at Usal In June, I^7, and he to ia
been in a hospital ever since. At the time
Morley was m.Ue of the steamer Xuvarro,
ard was superintending the unloading of
iiie vessel. w tiile a sling full or mer
chandise was being hoisted the cargo
fall parted and the whole apparatusâ
about tour tons weight in allâfell on
Morley -Ail his front teeth were knocked
out and hid scalp was nearly torn off.
Kive ribs and both arms were broken, his
spine was injured and his right ankle wm
crushed. For rifteen months the tough old
salt has been having a battle royal with
death, but he finally won out, and yes
y was able to hobble around to ste
a few of his old friends and tell them
that although badly battered he was still
In the ring.
It was Oaptain Frank Morley who
swam ashore through the surf in Vaquina
Bay with a life line from the. steamer
I'aqiiin.i City and thus saved the lives of
the passengers. It was he also who
stayed by the South Coast when she was
In danger of going to pieces at Fort
Bragg and all the crew deserted her.
Captain Morley got lines out and saved
the vessel. He is an old Atlantic naviga
tor, and knows that coast of America, al
most as well ns 1h- does the Pacific.
The Bchooner W. F. Jewett, < "aptain
Johnson, has made the record breaking
run of twelve days from St. Michael to
Grays Harbor.
The following letter is self-explanatory;

He is one of the best known owners and
breeders of hor<=es in th<- colonies. His
horse Nelson Bwept the hoard of all the

The Harbor Commissioners yesterday
reappolnted E. C. Ryan a Collector and
John L. Dickinson a wharfinger on the
front. The Board of Trade asked for an
Elevator in the new building, but the ap
plication was refused because of the ex
pense. The same hoard and the Mining
Bureau are squabbling over the space
each Is to have in the new depot, so Chief
Engineer Holmes is to make a survey

and will attempt to salve the derelict.
EXTRADITION
GRANTED WITH
LIMITATIONS
Governor Allows the
Botkin Warrant.
BUT UPON TWO CONDITIONS
THE CASE MUST FIRST GO TO
THE SUPREME COURT.
Chief of Police Lees Makes a Sensa
tional Statement of His
Peculiar Inten
tions.
At a hearing held yesterday In the
chambers of Attorney General Fitzgerald,
Governor Budd granted the requisition
iur Mrs. Cordelia Botkln prayed for by
Governor Tunnell of Delaware; but the
operation of the Governor's warrant Is
deferred to such time as both prosecution
and defense shall come together in .-iniity
and friendship and make unto the execu
tive a mutual promise upon two vital
points.
The llrst of these is: that upon the is
suance of the warrant the defense shall
at once apply to the Supreme Court for
a writ of habeas corpus in order that that
tribunal shall determine whether or not
Mrs. Botkln is a fugitive from the Justice
of I Delaware and, of a consequence, extra
ditable. The second: that the prosecution
Shall make complaint charging Mrs. Bot
kln with murder done in this State In
such terms that it can be settled upon
demurrer whether or not Mrs. Botkin is
triable in this State for the crime al
leged against her.
In other words the Botkin extradition
problem is precisely as it was before the
Governor granted extradition with the
exception "that the Supreme Court and
not Governor Budd shall bear the respon
sibility of deciding the matter. The sit
uation was ably summed up in the forci
ble expressive language of Chief Lees, who
said to Detective McVey when that gen
tleman asked the Governor's permissions
to telegraph the good news home, "Why,
Mac, that ain't worth a d , the whole
thing is in escrow. They are a-putting
us in an artesian well."
In explaining his action Governor Budd
Bald:
"I have carefully gone over this mat
ter, and two questions have been upper
most in my mind. Firstâ Could Mrs. Bot
kln, never having been in Delaware, or,
rather, not having been in Delaware at
the time of the acts charged, be a fugi
tive from justice? and second, if she did
the acts charged against her, is she or
is she not punishable for murder under
the laws of the State of California?
"Section 27 of the Penal Code provides
that a person is punishable under our
laws who, in whole or in part, commits
a crime within this State. And under
this section I am of the strong opinion
that If Mrs. Botkin be guilty of murder
she might be tried and punished here.
"In case I Issue a requisition the at
torneys for Mrs. Botkin may immediately
submit ihe matter either to the Superior
Court of this State or the Supreme Court
of the State, and secure from one or
both a decision as to whether or not the
facts justify extradition. If, on the con
trary, 1 refuse to issue my warrant, any
further inquiry fis to the rights of extra
dition must cease, as there is no power In
the courts to review my refusal on the
right to extradite."
To the firm of the executive's actions
George Knight for the defense agreed,
though he said that In throwing the mat
ter into the Supreme Court he closed be
hind him the doors of every Superior
Court in the Suite, should he have occa
sion to go into them on habeas corpus
proceedings.
Chief Lees, for the prosecution, refused
to agree to bring complaint in this State,
upon the ground that the trial of Mrs.
Botkin here is just what the defense is
lighting for.
Lees' refusal gave him an opportunity
to talk and ho took advantage of it to
unbosom himself of a throat that was, to
pay tiie least, peculiar. Said he: "I want
to tell George Knight that if he attempts
to drag me into every court In this State
on habeas corpus, I'll got this woman out
of the State anyhow. All the courts
could do to me if I did it would bo live
days In jail and $500 tine and I guess I
could stand that."
Governor Budd wheeled round in his
chair and retorted, "Lees, if you try to
spirit this woman out of the State
while this matt** is pending I'll withdraw
my warrant and have you arrested for
abduction before you are across the line."
Lees subsided.
Governor Budd then requested Attorney
General Fitzgerald to look up authorities
and a method of discovering some means
for having tho Supreme Court decide the
triabllity of Mrs. Botkin In California.
Attorneys Knight and McGowan, Chief
Lees and Attorney General Fitzgerald
will call upon the Supreme Court Justices
this morning to learn if that body will
hear the petition of the defense for a writ
of habeas corpus in bank, instead of re
ferring it back to some one of the Supe
rior Courts.
Governor Budd will Issue the extradi
tion warrant as soon as some plan for fu
ture procedure has been decided upon be
tween defense and prosecution.

TO AID THE
CHURCH OF THE
SACRED HEART
Opening of the Annual
Festival.
IS HELD IN ARMORY HALL
ATTRACTIVE PROGRAMME FOR
VISITORS TO THE FAIR,
Mirth, Art and Melody Now Rule
Where Recently the Sound of
Martial Music Awoke
the Echoes.
Armory Hall, Papre and Gough streets,
was a scene of life and color and gayety
last night, the occasion being the open
ing of the Sacred Heart Church Fair.
There have been a number of affairs of
this kind held in this city during the past
few months, but few can compare with
the beautiful booths and decorations that
ran be seen in the hall, which but a short
time ago was filled with martial sounds.
Pretty girls dressed in white and other
harmonious colors flitted about the place
armed with photographs, tickets and
other articles to tempt the visitor and
loosen his purse string's. In few instances
were their pleadings turned aside and. be
fore the close of the evening's entertain
ment a large number of sales were re
corded.
As a visitor steps into the hall he is
confronted by a view of a beautiful flower
booth, which has been erected in the cen
ter of the spectaturium. i'otted plants
and cut flowers have been used In decor
ating it, thus producing a striking effect.
The frumework is of bamboo and en
twined about it are ferns and smiiajc. A
large Japanese umbrella, decorated with
flowers, is suspended above it, and the In
terior has an inviting appearance. A
piano and many costly articles attract
the eye. Young ladies with persuasive
tongues sell many tickets for the articles
on exhibition. Miss L. Mahoney, assisted
by the following ladles, is in attendance
at the booth: Miss Kate Stafford. Mrs.
M F. Brennan, Miss Mollie Muleahy,
Miss Ella Mahoney. Miss Alice Magulre
and Miss Mollie Barrett. .

WORK OF FISH
COMMISSIONERS
IS REVIEWED
Large Output of State
Hatcheries.
MILLIONS IN THE EXPORTS
WHOLESALE DEALERS PERSIST
ENT VIOLATORS OF LAW.
The Propagation and Protection of
All Game Discussed in the
Biennial Report to the
Governor.
The State Fish Commission has for
warded to Governor Budd Its blennal re
port. It deals exhaustively with al
matters relating to fish and game in thi
State. Special mention Is made of th
splendid work of Arthur G. Fletcher, th
clerk of the board who died last Febru
ury. Also of the co-operation of th
Vnlted States Fish Commission in ex
tending the propagation of salmon so the
output of the several hatcheries excluded
all previous records. The lack of water
In the streams during the past season lias
injured the game- rish supply. The frork
of restocking will be taken up again next
sÂ«i!M<n and it will be several years be
fore the supply is fully restored. Every
effort has been made to protect the
streams of the State from persons who
violate the law. The deputies have been
kept on the move from place to place,
while county peace officers have also been
of great assistance to the commission.
The report ways: "The wholesale deal
ers and proprietors of French rotisseries
in San Francisco are tht- most persistent
and blameworthy violators of game laws.
We are glad to state, however, that In
San Francisco the courts are beginning
to see the law and have lately manifested
an Inclination to deal with these men as
they deserve."
The law providing for the appointment
of Game \\ ardens by Supervisors is com
mended, and in the counties where war
dens have been appointed the game and
fish interests have been well preserved.
.During the two years ending September
1. 2?7 arrests were made for violation of
the law, resulting in lines to the amount
of $3125. The sniped bass planted have
continued to multiply, and this Eastern
fish is now one of the principal food
fishes in the local markets. In order
to secure protection the commission ud
vlses that the month of June, the spawn
ing period, be declared a close season for
capture or Bale. 'i tie San Francisco
market receipts of bass have run from ,
79,738 pounds in 1893 to 355.194 pounds in
1597, and 2b3.144 pounds during the first
six months of this year. The people of
San Francisco are great fish eaters, the
receipts of salmon in this market being
also large. From 1893 to 1897 over two
and a half million pounds were consumed
annually, and In Iby7 the receipts were
The exports of fishing products for the
past six pears, aa shown by the Custom
liouse records follow: 1892. $2,165,106; 1893, I
1819.740: IXB4. $2,050,981: lSltf.. J2.553.465; 1596, I
$2,673,326; 1X97, $2,565,750. Of the hatcheries |
the report states that the total output of
fish during the past two years was 65,066,
908. The output from the Tahoe and Tal
lac trout hatcheries in the past two years
was 4.402.&00 fish and 3,550,000 eggs, which
were shipped to other hatcheries for
propagation.
The Commissioners will recommend
changes In the fish and game laws as fol
lows, subject to change before the meet-

TROUBLE OVER
THAT STANYAN
STREET LEASE
Supervisor Delany Uncovers a
Remarkable Document in
the Recorder's Office.
The City Saddled With the Old Ramshackle
Before the Matter Has Been Definitely
Acted Upon by the Board.
There Is on file In the Recorder's office
a document purporting to be a lease of
the premises 507 and 509 Stanyan street,
et present occupied by Supervisor Law
rence Devany as a cyclery, to the city
and county of San Francisco for a period
cf two years, to be used as a police sta
tion.
And thereby hangs a tale: !n fact sev
eral tailsâ a .sort of cat o' nine tails, as it
wpreâ which seems destined to be used at
no distant date on the backs of several
Supervisors, one School Director and an
ex-Sheriff.
This lease Is remarkable In more ways
than one. In the first place. It 13 not
worth the canceled DO-cent revenue stamp
which graces the so-called acknowledg
ment to the document. "Why it was ever
filed is a mystery to all who have seen
it, and it is doubtful if even Dr. D. F.
Ragan could give a satisfactory explana
tion of his great anxiety to have It safely
filed among the archives of the city.
The lease bears date of September 26,
1898, D. F. Ragan being the party of the
first part, and the City and County of
San Francisco the party of the second
part. The terms, which cover two cages
of type-written paper and part of the
third page, set forth that the house and
lot' to the east Bide of Stanyan street. Nos.
507 and 509, are to pass into the possession
of the party of the second part for a pe
riod of two years from October 1, 1898, at
a rental of *166 per month, said
rental to become payable in advance on
the Ist of every month. The premises fire
to be used solely for a police station, and
Is to be altered, fitted up and repaired at
the expense of the department. Water
and gas are to be paid for by the lessee,
and in default of the payment of rent
when due, the party of the first part may
elect the occupant. The privilege is
given the city and county to remove cer
tain tanks, etc.. at its own expense. The
last pago of the lease is given below in
full as it has a prominent part In sub
sequent proceedings. It reads:
In witness whereof the paid party of the first
pan has set his hand and seal, and the said
party of the second part, by its Committee on
Health and Police, have hereunto set their
hands and seals, this 26th day of September,
l- ; -- being thereunto authorized and empow
ered so to flo, by a resolution passed for said
purpose. f RAGAN, (Scan

Dr Ragan. who is not unknown to the
people of San Francisco as a member of
the Board of Education, presented the.
document at the Recorder's office last
Monday, October 3, and asked that it be
recorded. The deputy examined it and
handed it back with the statement that
the signatures would have to be duly
acknowledged before Jt could go on rec
ord. Dr. Ragan took the lease, saying
he was not aware that an acknowledg
ment was necessary, and after some
further conversation, during- which he let
slip the surprising admission that ex-
Sheriff John J. McDade was interested
in the property, left the office.
Ragan returned in a surprisingly short
time, considering it was necessary to
round up five Supervisors from the four
corners of the city and muster them in
the County Clerk's office. He was not
gone mere than a quarter of an hour,
but when he again presented the lease
to be recorded it bore a certificate of
acknowledgment to the Supervisors'
nam^s, signed by Charles p. Curry. Coun
ty Clerk. Ragan had failed to acknowl
edge his own signature and the documenl
â was worthless. The deputy, however,
did not care to have any further trouble
owr it, so he took it and fiied it to be
entered on the records. Later develop
ments indicate that the subscribers did
not go before the County ci*Â»rk at all.
but that Ragan took the lease to him
and asked him to acknov.-h-d,^ the sig
natures.
Some time after Ragan left the Record
er's office for the second time, Supervisor
P. M. Delany rushed in and wanted to
know if the lease had been recorded. lie
was told that it had bec-n, and asked to
see the document. It was handed to him
and he scanned the terms carefully.
"When he came to the signatures, his
own being at tbe top. h*> burn forth into
one of the most eloquent "roaxs" ever
listened to.
"Here, this thing's bogus. This is some
kind of a bunko game. This lease iB no
good. I never signed such a thing."
"What's that?' asked the deputy in
amazement. "Do you mean to say that is
not your signature?"
"I never bigned that lease," shouted
Delany, who by that time was mad clear
through. Several deputies came up, in

"Are you poÃitive that is not your Big

business if your name has been forged to
that document."
"Well, It's my signature, all right
enough, but I've been bunkoed; I didn't
know I was signing a lease."
"Maybe you nad a couplo of 'cold bots"
under your belt and wasn't feeling well
when you signed it?"
"Not much," returned the irate Super
visor. "Not with that steam beer gang.
I've simply been played for a sucker. I
only saw the last page of this thing and
signed it thinking- Jt was a simple reso
lution that would be brought up before
the board. Look at this: i tell you this
thing has lxÂ»en monkeyed with since I
signed it." Delany had been scrutinizing
the signatures while he talked and he
pointed to his own signature. There,
plainly enough was a broad line drawn
underneath it, but so high up that it ran
through the lower portion of some of the
letter?. It was manifestly drawn after
the signature was written, for the line
showed over the letters instead of the
letters being written over the line.
"That's a nice piece of work." continued
Delany. "And so Dr. D. F. Ragan signs
himself 'party of the first part. "What's
he got to do with this lease, anyway?
He doesn't own the property."
"What's that?" yelled a chorus of deep
ly interested deputies.
"It's truth I'm telling you. That prop
erty belongs to Johnny McDade. lie
bought it while he was Sheriff, but didn't

going right up to see the City and Coun
ty Attorney about this bunko business,"
and Delany bolted out of the Recorder's
office.
Delany did not see the City Attorney
Monday, as that official was not in when
the angry Supervisor reached his office.
Whether he has seen him since is not
known, for Delany has pained the mastery
over his wrath and now refuses to disAise
the matter.
"I have nothing to say about this affair
now," he replied, when asked yesterday to
tell what he knew about the lease, "more ;
than that there are a couple of fellows
named McDade and Ragan, who are go- j
ing about town selling gold bricks," and !
Delany chuckled.
"But how about your statements in tho ]
Recorder's office, Monday?"
"I have absolutely nothing to say now.
Next Monday this [ease will come up be- :
fore the board in regular order for final '
passage and I will probably be heard on
the subject then."
"Do you mean to say the lease has not
yet been finally agreed to by the board?"
"As I understand It, all such matters
have to be first passed to print and then
finally acted upon. It Is my belief that :
this lease has yet to be finally passed." ;
"Did you acknowledge your signature i
before the County Clerk?"
"Why Charlie Curry is putting In all his ;
time making his fight; he's never in his
office nowadays. How could , but, here, i
I'm not going to say another wcJrd about '
this until the board meets Monday. Just
warn the people about those two gold
brick merchants," and the Supervisor
gave a superb imitation of the silence of j
the proverbial tomb.
And now those who have heard of De
lany's declaration are wondering what has
come between him and the other members ;
of the Health and Police Committee, with
whom he has labored for nearly two years
in beautiful harmony.
Statisticians among: the speculators
have figured up that the city will pay
Just $3984 for a two-years' lease of the old
ramshackle building out on Btanyan
street, while Ragan or McDade, or who
ever owns it, would have good cause for
self-congratulation If he got $2000 or $2300 â 
from a private individual; then they tear
up their figures and begin to whistle, "Oh, i
what fun. '

FIGHT IN THE
SCHOOL BOARD
IS THREATENED D
President Barrington
Aroused,
WOULD DROP SIX TEACHERS
DECLARES RECENT APPOINT
MENTS TO BE ILLEGAL.
The Board Falls to Hold the Special
Session Called, but
Has a Secret , J
Caucus.
The special meeting: of the School Board
called for yesterday afternoon was not
held. A quorum of the members was
present at the rooms of the board, but
they went into a secret session as com
mittee of the whole and did not finish
their deliberations until evening. The
principal topic discussed was the pro
posed completion of the coping and ma
sonry about the new Mission High School.
The estimated cost is $15,000. Objection
was raised to a decision at this time,
when the board does not know Its own
financial condition. After lengthy discus
sion among the members It was finally
decided to postpone action until next
week Wednesday, when the clerk will
present a financial statement which will
inform the board as to where It stands
and whether there will be sufficient
muney to make the proposed improve
ment.
President Barrington has a surprise In
store for the board at its next meeting.
He would have sprung it yesterday had
he been given an opportunity. The presi
dent says that he considers the recent ap
pointment of twenty-three additional
teachers to have an illegai aspect. He
will move to have at least six of them
stricken from the roll. Speaking of the
matter yesterday he said: "The rules of
the board only permit thirty teachers to
he placed In the day substitute class. Yet
are now thirty-six enrolled, as a
of the recent wholesale elections.
:;ot know just what is the wisest
course to pursue in relation to the sub
f superfluous teachers, but I will de.
clde this w.-^k. Perhaps I might refuse
to si^ii salary warrants. There is no
doubt that a number of special teachers
w< re appointed in addition to the surplus
I the day substitute list whose services
not needed."
(â (â  President Carew also had an opin
to express. Said he: "1 am decidedly
lavor of abolishing the PoJvtechnib
Hi*h School. It is not needed. \VÂ« have
too many high schools. The Polytechnic
is in an unfavorable location fnr one
thiiiÃr. and is certain to go down with the
advance of time. There are plenty of
other high schools for the needs of the
cityâ the new Mission, the Lowell, the
Girls' an<l the two outride Institutions,
Lick Polytechnic and the Cogswell School.
"I hold the same opinion a* President
: ington regarding the number of su
perfluous teachers. We have altogether
too many." .
N.n interesting feature of the day was
unexpected appearance of Supervisor
ttanzi before the committee of the
ole as an applicant for a position as
i teacher. The Supervisor did not
want the job for himself, but for a com
petent young lady frimd. It Is not known
whether he held out sufficient Induce
ments to the bonrd to appoint his pro
tege, but the next meeting will tell the
tale.

BATTERED A SCHOOL BOY.
Policeman Marlowe, Already Accused of Cowardice,
Assaults a Child.
OFFICER T. MARLOWE has again distinguished himself. That brave po
liceman, who is now on trial before the Police Commissioners for deserting
Lieutenant Burke when he was killed in the discharge of his duty, is likely
to shortly appear before the commission on still another charge, which will
probably extinguish him.
Marlowe's latest bid for fame was the arrest of Eddie Duggan, a 16-year-old
schoolboy, whom- he disgraced by compelling him to ride to prison in a patrol
wagon for standing in front of his school.
Marlowe's beat is In the neighborhood of Flllmore and Hermann streets. It
has been his duty to stand in front of the Hearst Grammar School, which is lo
cated on that corner, and assist little children to cross the street in safety, and
to see that they do not loiter about the schoolhouse. In the discharge of his
duty he has made himself very unpopular with the scholars and their parepts
by his domineering conduct, and complaints have been frequent. On Tuesday aft
ernoon Marlowe saw a chance to swell his record of arrests and he grasped It.
Young Duggan, who Is a bright and gentlemanly boy, was standing in front of
the school talking to his companion, Tom Simmie, when the minion of the law
swooped down on them and ordered them to move on. Instead of doing go Dug
gan walked back to the school yard for the purpose of waiting for a friend.
Marlowe, believing this to be an open defiance of his authority, followed Dug
gan into the yard and roughly grabbed him by the arm, kicked him and pulled
him out on the sidewalk. He swore at the boy and said if it was dark he would
"break his back." Marlowe then took the boy down to a patrol oox, much to
the amazement of teachers and pupils, and even rode some distance in the
wagon to abuse his prisoner, and then ordered the officer who accompanied the
vehicle to place a charge of obstructing the streets against Duggan. The boy
was further disgraced by being placed in a cell to await release.
As soon as the principal of thu school, Mrs. N. A. "Wood, heard of Duggan'a
arrest she visited Captain Spillane at the Southern station and asked for the
boy's release. As the arrest was made by an officer connected with the Seven
teenth street station, he telephoned to Lieutenant Price and stated the facts to
him explaining that there was a rule In the department which expressly prohib
it, d the arrest of schoolboys except in flagrant cases: otherwise they were to be
taken before their principals to be dealt with. Lieutenant Price immediately re
quested Captain Spillane to release Duggan, which was done. Yesterday morn
ing young Duggan appeared before Judge Low, and despite the testimony of
Mariowe was discharged.
Eddie Duggan lives with his parents at P2O Herman street, and bears a good
reputation in the neighborhood. lie said yesterday that his arrest was due to a
grudge Officer Marlowe bore him. "About a month ago," he said, "Marlowe ar
rested a working boy named George Duncan and placed a charge of vagrancy
against him. I testified that he worked and he was discharged. This made Mar
lowe angry at me, and since then he threatened to arrest me if he ever caught
me out at night. I did nothing to anger him yesterday. I was only standing
In front of my school when he ordered me away. I went inside, and he then
nulled me out and kicked me. He swore at me, and also said he would break my
back if it was dark. My arm is a.ll black and blue where he pinched me."
Mrs Wood principal of the Hearst Grammar School, is indignant that one of
her pupils should be so maltreated. She stated that arresting young Duggan
not only in.iur.-d him but hurt the school. She gave another instance of Mar
lowe's 'tyranny. "A pupil threw a piece of chalk out of the window one day "
she said "and instead of coming to me he went to the classroom, and before the
whofe class said if he knew who did It he would drag him out and lock him up.
This neighborhood bears a harsh name, but it is due to the boys who work and
who create noise at night. My pupils are all well behaved, and I am capable of
looking after their welfare. I think Officer Marlowe s action entirely uncalled
Â° r The parents of Duggan are Indignant. Friends are advising them to brine
the tyrannical officer before the Commissioners. They dislike the attendant no
toriety, but will probably do so.
GIFT OF CASH
FOR THE FIRE
DEPARTMENT
Insurance Companies
Donate $14,635 52.
IT IS FOR NEW EQUIPMENT
EXPLANATIONS FROM COMMIS
SIONER CLUNIE.
Sends a Letter "With Check for the
Money to" City and County
Treasurer C,
Be is.
The Fire Department Is to be financially
assisted by the foreign insurance compa
nies. This surprising information became
noised abroad in the city buildings yester
day afternoon, as the result of a letter
received by City and County Treasurer
Reis. from State Insurance Commissioner
Clunie. Accompanying the letter was a
certified check for $14,636 52, as an earnest
of the intentions of the companies con
cerned. It appears that the Insurance
companies are not satisfied with the pres
ent equipment of the Fire Department
and they openly criticize Che Board of Su
pervisors for diverting money from the
fund for fire protection to other purposes.
Just how far the insurance companies
may assist the Fire Department in future
Is not stated in the communication sent to
Treasurer Reis, but a substantial start has
been made in the $14,635 52 donation.
The letter is given in 'full as follows;
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 5. 1898.
Hon. Christian Keis, Treasurer City and
County of San Francisco, City Hallâ Dear"
Sir: I herewith hand you a check for $14,
635 62, payable to your order, the proceeds to
be deposited by you to the special credit of the
Fire Department fund of the city ami county
of San Francisco, and to be disbursed by order
of the Board of Supervisors and Fire Commis
sioners of said city and county for the benefit
of Its Fire Department. This money consti
tutes part of a fund voluntarily paid to me by
fire Insurance companies, organized under the
laws of foreign countries, and of the State of
Connecticut, doing business within the State
of California, estimated at 1 per cent upon the
net premiums received by said companies upon
business transacted by them within the State
during the year ending: December 31, 1897. The
terms of this compromise are set forth In the
agreements signed by said companies and â  ray
self, now on file In my office, and are bo
lenpthy as to preclude their insertion here.
Suffice it to say that these payments have been
made and received by me upon the distinct
understanding and agreement that the same
are wholly ;. voluntary and not made by virtue
of .the mandates or requirements of any law
or laws of the State of California. .The share
of the moneys net aside to . San Francisco ap
proximately represents 1 per cent of the pre
miums received by such companies during such
time on 'business within the city and county.
In view of , the fact of the payment of this
money having been purely voluntary, I have
deemed it but ! Just that In exercising the dis
cretion conferred upon me in the distribution
of ' the same that . as far as compatible with
the interests of our citizens, the money so re
ceived should be expended in sucn a manner
as to best subserve the interests of the people
and also those of the companies making the
payments, and accordingly I have set the same
aside to the Fire Department : fund. I am In
formed that the Fire Department is in urgent
need of certain apparatus for the extinguish
ment of fires, which It has been Impossible for
It to obtain by reason of the shortage in its
accounts arising ' from the overdrawing by
other departments of the city government of
moneys properly belonging to, and which had
heretofore-been set aside for, the use of this

department, and that this money can and will
be utilized for the purpose or securing the
needed articles.
This disposition of the money has been ap
proved by a committee representing the com
panies contributing, acting In conjunction with
me. Accordingly I trust this money will be
accepted by you as herein provided. Very truly
yours, ANDREW J. CL.UNIE.

WIDBEFTS CASE
NEARLY ENDED
ARGUMENT WILL BE OPENED
THIS MORNING.
It Is Thought the Jury Will Deter
mine the Fate of the ex-Treas
urer To-Morrow.
The defense In the Widber ease closer!
late yesterday afternoon. At 10 o'clock
i this morning counsel will open the ar
gument, and it is thought that Friday the
fate of the accused ex-Treasurer will be
decided by tho jury. The greater part
of the morning: session yesterday was de
voted by the defense to an effort to show
that the property which "Widber stated
In his confession was acquired with sto
len money was secured by him prior to
the time the money was taken from the
vaults of the treasury. A number of
deeds were introduced showing 1 that Wid
ber acquired the Contra Costa property
and other holdings many years ago.
Louis Jacobs, alter tho matter of the
property was disposed of, took the stand
and related how Widber had exhausted
every effort to make up the Heaney
shortage of $5000. To his knowledg-e Wid
ber had paid up $3800 toward meeting- the
shortage when Heaney absconded.
George A. Lowenberg, of Sutro & -*?r>
then testified that his firm had sold stock
belonging to Wldher that he might re
alize money to meet the Heaney short
age. Other witnesses testified to similar
facts, and then the aged and heart
broken mother of the accused man took
the stand.
She stated that In April last she gave
her son permission to take $1500 from the
vault where she had her money depos
ited, which was used toward making good
the shortage of $1500 which was discov
ered by Chief Deputy de la Montanya
Harry T. Creswell, ex-City and County
Attorney, then stated that Widber had
willingly placed all his property at his
disposal that the city might lose as little
as possible through the shortage*
Widber then took the stand. In sub
stance he stated that he did not take the
property; he never substituted silver for
gold, and never examined the sacks of
coin as they came into the treasury
to see whether or not the amounts were
as stated on the Mint tags. It was not
his custom to interfere with the routine
of the officeâ a fact which he now re
grets. The prosecution endeavored to
shake his testimony, but he rigidly ad
hered to his statements made in direct
examination. W T hen he left the stand
the case went over until to-day for ar
gument.
Troubles Still Follow Her.
George Goettinger has sued Mrs.
Amanda Fennell and Gerald Fennell for
$207 for merchandise delivered by George
A. Moss. Mrs. Fennell has figured ex
tensively in the public prints as a result
of her unsuccessful ventures in the field
of matrimony. She married Mr. Fennell
about three years ago.
