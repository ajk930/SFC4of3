The debate on the Hawaiian treaty
began in the Senate to-day. After the
transaction of morning business, Sen
ator Davis of Minnesota, chairman of
the Committee oii Foreign Relations,
moved that the Senate go into execu
tive session, which was agreed to. The
. galleries were cleared and the doors
locked. The treaty was not taken up
Immediately, as considerable time was
consumed in the consideration of Pres
idential nominations. The nomination
of Mr. McKenna as Associate Justice of
the Supreme Court to succeed Field
â was referred to, .-nd the chairman of i
the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hoar !
of Massachusetts, said it had not been
-considered in the committee, because
some of the members wished first to
dispose of those nominations to which
no objection was offered. He said the
committee would take up the McKenna
nomination and consider it to-morrow.
The' annexation treaty was then
taken up. Senator Pettigrew of North
Dakota, who is opposed to annexation,
immediately offered a resolution pro
â  viding that the treaty be debated in
open session. He supported his resolu
tion in a speech, contending there was
â¢ no' need for secrecy, that the people
were greatly interested in the question,
and had a right to know what was
taking place from day to day.
:â â .; Senator Davis opposed the resolution,
saying it had been long the custom to
-. con^id-er treaties in executive session,
â¢.and there was now no reason for de
parting from this time-honored cus
.. torn.
/_ OiheF Senators supported the reso
: lution, declaring that the whole ques
tion had been discussed in the public
press; that the people had become fa
. miliar with the terms of the treaty and
.'there would be no new points exploited.
-It â¢".was said by other Senators that
there would certainly be new questions
presented, and that the situation in the
'^Chinese Empire would be discussed,
and that this was a matter not for
open discussion since it involved ques
tions of. diplomacy of vital interest to
the United States.
; The debate on the Pettigrev resolu
tion continued for about two hours.
, "Gray of Delaware. Mason of Illinois!
â¢and. White of California being conspir
.uous. White made a vigorous speech
in favor of an open session. The speech
,^of Senator Spooner of Wisconsin op
posed an open session, but at the same
time Its tenor clearly indicated that
he was strongly opposed to annexa
tion.
It was finally decided to consider the
treaty in executive session. The ayes
and noes were not called, and as no
record was made of the vote, which
was viva <â¢â >â¢. it Is impossible to give
the standing of the Senators. The fact
that the Senate - decided in fa
vor of executive sessions is not an in
dication of the sentiment on the ques
tion of annexation itself. The opinion
is now generally expressed among Sen
ators familiar with the situation, that
the necessary two-thirds cannot be se
cured. The opposition has at least 35
votes, while there are only 83 Sena
tors in all. Senator White.' in conver
sation to-night expressed a positive be
lief that the treaty would be de- <
feated.
Gorman of Maryland is very active
in favor of annexation. Morriil of Ver
mont, who is very influential, is pre
paring a most exhaustive speech in op
position, which he will deliver in a
few days. Hoar of Massachusetts, de- i
spite all reports to the contrary, will
probably oppose the treaty.
Senator Morgan was the principal op
ponent of the proposition for on open
debate. He talked at length upon the
Importance of obeying the Senate, rules
in discussing this question, contending
that as the Senate was acting only in
advisory capacity to the executive it
i would be an act of bad faith for it to
* throw open the doors to the public.
Most of th- Senators who spoke in
opposition to open sessions referred to
the probability that the action of the
European powers in their evident pur

China would form the basis of much
of the debate on the question of Ha
waiian annexation. All who referred
to this phase of the question mani
1 a disposition to regard it as a
delicate and complicated on-, and one
which it were better should be venti
lated behind closed doors. It was
also intimated that The Monroe doc
trine would come in for a fair share ol
discussion before the close of the de
bate, and it was asserted that this was
a question which could be more freely
discussed in executive than in open
session.
Senator White whs among those
who replied to thesp statements. He
spoke spiritedly and in sarcastic vein
of the folly of attempting to keep < x
ecutive secrets within ihÂ»- control i f
the Senate. He made reply to the sug
gestion that the control of publicity in
regard to the treaties should be left to
the Executive, saying that thÂ»Â» treaty
itself had been made public, also the
President's message on the subject.
Mr. Merrill contended that the ques
tion of annexation was one of much
public interest and said that on this
account the public should be fully in
formed of the reasons for and against
annexation.
Senator Mason took advantage of
the opportunity to make a sp< ech di
rected against executive sessions. He
announced his intention to support the
motion for an open session and sail
he would take advantage of all such
openings to exercise his Influence to
break down the Senatorial rule for se
cret sessions.
Senator Davis announced his pur
pose to call up the treaty again to
morrow and press it a? rapidly as pos
sible. -1 â¢ probably will make a speech
in general advocacy of the treaty at
to-morrow's session.
The annexationists now claim lifty
nine votes for the treaty, lacking only
one of the number to ratify it. On the
other hand the nppositi<.*Â» say the
ratifiers will fall short from three to
five votes.

The lounpers in the saloon made a run
toward the dance hall to see the cause
of the alarm, and the dancers rushed
toward the saloon. In the jam men
swore and women screamed. The jam
was broken in a few minutes, and men
and women made their way into the
street?.
Flames shortly came from the upper ,
windows Of the building. an<i it was
seen that it could not be saved. The ]
next building south was the opera
house. There was a masquerade ball
in progress. The ball had been under
preparation for weeks, and costumes
had been rigged out of every available
material. The dance hall was crowded
with maskers, and the saloon with
men and women. The cry of fire here
had the same effect as in the M. & M..
and in a few minutes saloon and dance
hall were almost emptied.
The thermometer registered 52 de
grees below zero in the street, but the ;
thinly clad maskers, men and women, ,
leaving their furs and wraps behind
them. fled. There was little wind, but j
the flames soon created enough to toss |
the torch that lifted itself above the j
big frame building first to one side and
then another, as though in doubt !
whether to spring upon the Alaska j
Commercial Company's big store and j
warehouses within half a block north
ward, or go down the line of saloons
and gambling houses southward. The
opera house could not escape.
The gambling paraphernalia and
portable furniture of all the buildings
in the block were piled out in the snow j
on the river bank as rapidly as possi- (
ble, and then an attempt was made to
break the path of the fire by blowing
up the Dominion saloon adjoining the :
opera house on the south. Twelve cans
of powder were placed in the building I
and exploded, but their only effect was
to shatter and shake it up. It did not j
fall. The fire moved down upon and \
ate it up.
There was a gap between the Domin
ion saloon and next building and there
the fire stopped, a number of dwellings
and shacks in the rear of the big build
ings being destroyed on the way. There
is now a big charred square where was
a few days ago the business center and
the center of the "life" of the town. Ta T
hi*, chairs and stoves, faro layouts
and roulette wheels, and the general j
wreckage of such a fire are still strewn (
about the streets around the charred ,
square. ' The men whose business was
interrupted have already found new j
quarters further down the water front
toward the police barracks, and are fit
ting them up for the resumption of the
game and the dance. There were only a
few people who made their homes in the
buildings destroyed, and these were
principally the proprietors or 'women '
who were under their care, and who i
readily found shelter elsewhere.
As in the fire at the Klondike church
building, a large quantity of provisions ;
was destroyed, the cache of Pete Bfo-
Donald of the M. & M. being one of the
largest of any individual in the city, i
The loss is difficult to estimate, but j
probably $150,000 would not replace it. ;
There was no means or method of com- I
bating the fire other than to remove in
advance what it might feed upon, and j

deserted and things that could he were
taken out <>f it.
To he sure. I. Gordon Kettles, one of
the bonanza kings, did climb on a
building with a bucket of water, but
that was because Mr. Settles was in a
mood to be reckless. When .he got
out on the roof, the ice slid him down
to the ground as though he had been
shot from a catapult. He struck in
a snowbank, and was picked up and
carried to the Pioneer saloon, where he
soon recovered. The scene at the fire
was a remarkable one. but it is dwelt
up. in in my diary some pages from
which I shall add hereto as they pre
sent the details of the most important
happenings of the city in their se
quence since my last dispatch.
Joaquin Miller arrived yesterday
from Circle City, having came up with
a sled. He is in a badly frozen con
dition. His left ear is sloughing off,
he his lost a. part of the great toe of
hi? left foot, and both his cheeks are
frozen. He also suffered severely from
felling on the ice. He was thirty-five
days coming up from Circle City. He
was unable to get to Fort Yukon and
brings no news from that point, noth
ing having been heard from it at the
time he left. He says that no less
than TOO men without provisions have
gone there, fiOO having passed down
from here and about 100 from Circle.
Since Captain Wray of the United
States army took a bargeload of forty
men from Circle, bound through the
Flats to Yukon, October 16, no com
munication has been had with that
northern post. Very many people here,
and especially among the new comers,
have friends and relatives at Fort Yu
kon, where they were compelled to
send them for lack of provisions, and
tiny are, of course, very anxious about
them.
Mr. Miller brings a story of great suf
fering along the river by parties who
were caught in the ire on their way
to Yukon, but who had not yet reached
Circle. He reports also the death of
Charles Anderson, a young man from
Brooklyn. X. V.. who accidentally shot
himself while in a boat about fifty
milos above Circle. The body of young
Anderson lay in the boat, the ice
jammed about it, and the boat was
carried far out in the stream with open
water or thin ice between it and the
shore, so that the party consisting of
five, whose names Mr. Miller did not
have, could not reach it. They made
their way along shore to Circle and re
ported the facts. A party returned
and found the body doubled up in the
boat and were compelled to dig it out
of the ice. They carried it to Circle
where it was properly buried. Young
Anderson shot himself, says his friends,
while raising his revolver to shoot at
a raven flying over the boat. The bul
let entered his neck just under his
chin and death was almost instanta
neous. The dead man kept a diary
in which he makes frequent reference
to his mother. He was evidently edu
cated and refined.
Numbers of men came or were car
ried into Circle City frozen. " One man,
a miner named Ryan, had to have his
feet amputated. When the ice jam
came many were wet and some started
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
to walk on in that condition. They
were soon frozen. He found suffering
all along- the river. He says they passed
one or more boats in the ice every day
of their trip. Mr. Miller is in excellent
spirits, despite his severe experience.
He is stopping with Captain Hanson
of the Alaska Commercial Company
and is g-ettinpc thoroughly rested up.
H^ had intended Koins out over the ice
at once, but has boon persuaded not to
think of such a thins for some time
at least.
Mr. Miller's companion on the trip up
was Harold Cnnovan of Ottawa, lately
attached to the <-oast Burvey. Mr. Can
ovan suffers from a frozen knee.
Captain Geiger of Puget Sound ar
rived the same day with Mr. Miller in
company with two Indians, Kitka and
Zuriska. the discoverers of gold in the
circle City district. Both the Indians
had their cheeks frozen. Miller and his
companion left Circle City for this
place on the morning of the I'Tth of
October. They were unable to buy
dogs, because of the great scarcity of
the animals and the large demand for
them for freighting. They offered
fancy prices, but were compelled to
start away pulling their outfit on a lit
tle sled by hand. They fell in with
freighters soon after their start and
secured assistance from them. They
also hired Indians with dogs to help
them on from camp to camp. The
story of Mr. Miller's trying experience
I will tell further along under the date
of his arrivel here, when he tells it to
me.
The steamers Bella and AVeare, old
liners, and the little new steamers Vic
toria and St. Michael, are at Circle
City, frozen up in a slough- for the win
ter. The latter two were caught there
on the way up by the ice and the other
two on their way to Fort Yukon
from this city for another cargo of
provisions and could get no further.
Nothing has been heard of the May
West, the steamer built at St. Mich
ael during the summer, and which
started up the river loaded with pro
visions by the passengers of the Ex
celsior â San Francisco people. Mr.
Miller started to go to Fort Yukon in
a small boat when his steamer stopped
at Circle City, but the boat was caught
in the ice fifty miles below Circle City
and he and his two companions re
turned to that town. It was after that
that 100 men were sent there for lack
of provisions in two barge loads, the
last in charge of Captain Ray of the
United States army, the officer sent
here with power to act for the Govern
ment. When the Weare stopped at
Circle the "Pirates," as they were call
ed, protested and urged the captain to
go on. He thought it unsafe, however,
in the condition of the river, and
ran the boat into a slough, where she
was quickly held fast by the ice.
Then there came a spell of warmer
weather, the river being free of ice and
the boat was chopped out and the
pirates declared if the captain didn't
go on to Yukon and attempt to bring
more provisions they would take pos
session of the boat themselves and run
her down. That night, before any move
could be taken by anybody, the mer
cury dropped and the boat was frozen
in fast. Captain Ray then set himself
the task of getting the surplus popula
tion to Fort Yukon. He sent the first
barge of sixty men with the promise
that he would himself follow in the
next barge. He did so a few days later
with forty men. Nothing has been,
heard of them since then.
Mr. Miller says they have plenty of
moose and caribou in the vicinity of
Circle, and he insists there san be no
fear for lack of provisions.
A great deal of feeling has been,
aroused in this city and district in the
matter of the commission of three dele
gates to carry the miners' memorial to
Ottawa protesting against recently
adopted mining regulations. One of
these delegates is the representative of
the Examiner-Journal, K. J. Livernash.
He was appointed by the committee of
ten, as the others were, but a bitter op
position to him has been active among
the miners from the. beginning. He waa
openly and strongly opposed when2
nominated in the miners' meeting, the
reasons given being that h|; candidacy
was simply a play for the advertising
of his newspaper, it was urged that, if
he were selected to to Ottawa, the
government would look upon the whole
affair in the li^lit of a newspaper fake
and would simply throw the memorial
in the waste basket.
Livernash took this reference to him
as a personal insult, he said, and made
a violent Bpeech in which he declared
that he represented as much capital as
any man in the room, that he was ac
tiveiy interested in mines, owned a
claim, and had interests in several
others, and that he was not a mero
newspaper reporter, but was the. as
sistant managing editor of one of the
greatest newspaper in the country.
This speech only quickened the op
position and in order to get the quar
rel out of the way of the meeting and
adjust the difficulty with the least of
fense to anybody, it was proposed that
a committee be appointed with power
in select the three delegates. Liver
nash at first opposed this, declaring it
was dear to him that the committee
would be stuffed against him. He
wanted the meeting to name the dele
gates. The committee was appointed,
however, and he was placed on it him
self.
I made no reference to any of this
in my dispatch that reported the meet
ing because I deemed it a detail of
smali importance, the business having
been concluded and Livernash named
as one of the three. It becomes impor
tant, in view of the general expression
of protest that has since been made as
ii gainst his going to Ottawa.
A petition circulated in town and on
the creeks, asking the committee of ten
to reconsider his appointment and to
name some other in his stead, secured
in a few days 2000 signatures. It was
being actively pushed for even a larg
er list, and in the meantime members
of the committee were informed and
asked to get together and decide upon
tu>me other man.
Livernash was to have started out
to-morrow. That was the date he had
fixed. Hearing of the movement
against him, he got together what of
his outfit he could quickly and left town
last Friday. He went up the river a
few miles and made camp there to
await his party. Frank Slavin, the
prize-fighter, who is going with Liv
ernash, is still in town, and says he
hi iâ¢s to get away to-morrow. The
miners who signed the petition are
greatly incensed at Livernash's action,
and it is more than likely a meeting
will be called to make informal protest
to < >ttawa.
Captain Hanson, the local head of the
Alaska Commercial Company, told me
to-day that his clerks have an average
cf 100 requests for food every day that
he is unable to grant. Men not only
offer to pay for provisions, but offer the
< lerks all manner of bribes to fill their
orders. It sec-ir.s impossible, he says,
to make the people believe that there
is nothing in the store to sell in the pro
vision line.
"I have at times been worried be
cause of the responsibility I took in
urging men to go to Fort Yukon," said
Captain Hanson, "but I am now con
vinced that I was right. If there were
600 men more in this place without pro
visions there would be certain starva
tion. Relief cannot be brought here by
teams. The best dog team in the
country isould not land more than 2')o
pounds, and no team can make more
than two trips. There are not dogs
igh in the country to make any
material Impression in, case of famine."
Xoth withstanding the signs of great
scarcity of food, there is nevertheless a
much easier feeling here in this matter.
The great exodus of men, first down
the river and now up. has brought re
lief i n two waysâ there are not only
fewer men to feed, but nearly every
man going out has swelled the stock of
provisions here by leaving his surplus.
This has been such a material quan
tity that three restaurants have
i : ened. The price of a meal In any one
of these i onsisting of a very slim piece
of meat, .t dish of some one vegetable,
bread without butter, pie and coffee, Is
|3 50. Pie and coffee is $1 50. These res
taurants do a good business. They are
backed by the gambling fraternity, to
whom they are a godsend. With no
place to get a meal, the miners on the
creek did not dare to come to town.
The terrible march over the ice is
now fully under way, and there are
now over 400 men or. the trail. Very
many go without any equipment for
such an undertaking and apparently
without any conception of the danger
they must encounter. I have seen half
v dozen start out with nothing more
than what they carried in their pack
straps on their backs. One man I saw
Mart in this way aloneâ no tent, no
bU,v-. little clothing and little provi
sion. His name is Henry Pellet of Sioux
Palls. A score of men start out every
day. The great majority are without
dogs ami "have their outfits on clumsy
pleds which they have made themselves
and which are scarcely fitted for the
work they will be required to do. These
sleds are often loaded so that the men
haul them with difficulty over level
ground ; indeed, they must be so loaded
if the person carries with him an
equipment in any wise in keeping with
the requirement of his journey. How
they expect to make their way over the
heaped up masses of ice that lie in their
way only desperate necessity can sug
gest.
For ten days the temperature has
ranged from 40 to 57 degrees below zero,
at no time rising above 40 below. There
is little wind at any time and the in
tense cold is still and in its effect
stealthy. One does not appreciate how
cold it is. The air is perfectly dry and
exhilarating, there is none of that
searching shivering sensation that at
tends the cold weather of Cape Cod.
Men who know the weather, and it does
not take long to get acquainted with it.
go about dressed in furs, with head,
hands and feet especially well protect
ed. Others will venture considerable
distances from a lire in their shirt
sleeves. The careless soon wear weath
er marks. They are frozen before they
know their danger. The faces and fin
gers tingle a little. It is to be expected,
as all cold weather has that effect, but
a moment later the face or fingers are
discovered to be frozen.
A friend of mine had his hand frozen
through allowing it to get from under
the cover while he slept. A man got
his feet frozen in his cabin before he
got his tin stove working in the morn
ing. It is in weather like this that the
army of the unprovisioned tramp to
salt water and the outer world. Re
ports come in daily from those still
headed this way, who were stopped by
the closing of the river. George Welsh
of Waverley, N. V., was taken into the
police barracks yesterday with a frozen
arm. He had come down from his
camp ten miles up the river to secure
â¢r prepare a safe cache for his goods
here. Welsh's arm was frozen on the
tramp down. He was tarrying a pack
<>n his back, and the straps on the
shoulder checked the free circulation in
his arms. There are two others in his
party, both of whom are severely
frozen; one of them, George Winters,
an old man, has both feet frozen, his
ankles being swollen and the flesh
broken. James Sironaeh, the third, is
also badly frozen. The party was
caught in the ice crush thirty miles up,
and has ever since been plodding on
toward this city, having in three weeks
made twenty miles with their entire
outfit.
Welsh says there were days at first
following the jam that they struggled
the entire day chopping a passage
through the ice to make a distance of
one mile. In their crippled condition
they are going to try to bring their
goods to this city without moving camp
again until they move it finally here.
Qeorge Winters is an old soldier of the
Union army and James Stronach of the
Confederate army, and both are suf
fering in the same tent. They say that
the war developed no such hardships as
they are now undergoing.
James Carter, who came down after
! the ice stopped running, tells the story
of the loss of a boat with three men,
Judge Sullivan, Dr. Harvey and a Mr.
Dillon, all of Colfax, Washington.
Carter says he and his party had made
a landing before the ice jam took place
and that from the shore he saw a boat
caught out in the stream between two
lloes, crushed and carried under, and
that the three men went down with it.
The men were all fellow-passengers of
' Carter on the steamer Klder, that
failed from Portland on the 2">th of
July. The fatality occurred only about
twenty miles above the city, from
which point Carter walked to town.
With the slacking: of the tension in
regard to provisions, interest in mining
has intensified. There is a stampede
at least once a week to some creek in
the district near or far, and the work
in the commissioner's office has grown
very heavy recording newly staked
claims.
Reports of new discoveries come from
all quarters. The reports from the
creeks where systematic prospecting is
going forward is of such a character as
to create and sustain this excitement,
t 'ii l'pper Bonanza, as high as 122, very
rich gravel has been found and the
greatest expectations Â»are sustained
with regard to bedrock. The twenty
per cent tax proposed to be levied hy
the government on the product of the
Claims has had the effect of stopping
all boasting about the great yields of
the mines, and it is now very difficult
to get at the product of any particular
claim. However, a very rich strike has
the effect of driving the lucky miner
to drink in most cases and then he
talks. It was through this agency that
rich pay was reported from r?ear Creek.
a few days ago, and another sweep of
excitement spread through the camp.
George Howard took $76 from one pan
on his branch claim No. 4, on the right
side of Skookum Gulch, a few days
ago. He tried a second pan and got
$86. This is the first report from the
right side of Skookum. The left was
repDrted quite as rich some months ago.
Deadw 1 Creek is known to be very
rich, as heavy covered gold has beÂ»n se
cured in the gravel. The Deadwood
empties into the Yukon four miles be
low Dawson, but from the opposite side.
The sale by Louis LePlant to Jim
Haggen of a half interest in 43 on
Hunker frrr $30,000 has precipitated a
very pretty race between dog teams to
Circle City. Fred Trump, now in Cir
cle, offered a half interest in 46, three
claims above Haggens, for $2000 last
summer. Since then 43 has developed
big prospects, and the sale to Haggen.
a Snohomish, Wash., man, quieted all
doubts as to its wealth. Two parties
started on Monday to go to circle City
to find Trump, who is not supposed to
know the value of his property, to buy
it from him for those $2000 perhaps.
Tom Lynch got out with five dogs last
night. He will travel as nearly all the
time as he can. He goes on behalf of
a gambler mimed "Goldie." There are
several others about to attempt to
overtake him.
Despite the depth of snow that cov
ers everything: and the Intense cold, a
good deal of prospecting is being done
for quartz. Quartz in the Bonanza or
El Dorado hills is held to be the thing
most to be desired, and parties are
spending the winter among them, look
ing for the white rock with the yellow
metal in it. Several finds have been
made, which the prospectors believe are
the foundations of great fortunes.
James Pyle yesterday filed a quartz
claim on the point of the hill rounding
out from Skoo-kum Gulch to Bonanza
Creek, and covering some 90 placer
claims. The placer claims, however,
have prior right under the law, and
must be worked out before the quartz
claim may be worked. The All-Gold
group of quartz claims and the Too-
Much-Gold group, covering the two
lodes extending through the hills from
one to the other of the creeks of the
same names, are said to have shown
very rich prospects. The following
pages from my diary will take up the
story of life in Dawson where my dis
patch of November 21 left it:
Nov. 21â Nigger Jim walked into Jim
mie. Kerry's saloon, scene of the recent
robbery of J22.000, this morning about I
o'clock and called for a drink. As the
whisky was placed before him Jim SHid:
"Now, I don't want you people to pet ex
cited, but I have come for that SSifft that
I left here, and that you stole from me."
As he said this Jim drew a revolver and
presented it at the breast of the bar
keeper, Ed Lord. Lord tried to langli
over the uselessness of the pun, and pro
tested that he knew nothing of the
money and could not give it up.
"Then 111 kill you." said Jim. cocking
the revolver. Lord raised his hands anrl
made oath that he did not know where
the money was.
"Give up the money," cried Jim, "give
me the money or I'll kill you. I came in
here to get that money or commit mur
der. Give me the money."
Lord gave him the money, handing the
sack with $SOOO of gold dust over the
bar.
"Now," said Lord as he did so, "kill
me; you might as well kill me new, any
how."
"No," said Jim, "the other fellows may
do that. I've got all that I wanted out
of you. Now everybody in the house
come and take a drink."
They went and took several drinks
Jim went down the line later and "trfn
ned" up the town. It was net long before
everybody knew that the robbery ai
Keery's, which had been under suspi
cion, was the act of attaches of thÂ»
house. Subsequently Lord conducted the
officers who arrested him to the hiding
places of $12,000 more of the Itoieti
money. That left him but J2OOO to be ac
counted for, and Lord said he could not
do that. He was then taken to the lock
up at the barracks, where he has since
been confined.
While Nigger Jim was entertaining the
town further up the Btreet a man stag
gered into the lodging-rooms over the
Klondike church. He lighted a candle
in a miner's candlestick and tried to
thrust the iron point In the wall. The

There were twelve men lodging in the
house. They ail had their caches Hut*',
and there were besides two other caches.
All the men were In bed and the fire de
veloped so (ast that they had no time
even to save their clothes. Many of
them left their goldÂ«*acks In their trou
eer pockets and escaped Into â  tempera
ture of 32 degrees below zero In their
stocking feet. The building and its con
tents were completely destroyed and the
adjoining building, occupied by Trett,
Crawford A Dupras, was badly scorched.
Those who were burned out took refuge
in this building and Crawford and Colo
nel Trett supplied them with clothes fir
the time being. These twelve men, all
of them previously well supplied, were
rendered wholly destitute by the tire.
Eleven thousand pounds of provisions
were destroyed, which at the current rate
of $1 a pound means a loss to them of
111,000, exclusive of clothes, guns and
other equipments and the money that was
burned. Later in the day the Chamber
of Commerce and Mining held a meeting
to take action for their relief. A com*
mittee was appointed composed of Colonel
Trett and Falcon Joslyn of Seattle and
Edgar Misner of Pan Francisco, to secure
subscriptions of food and clothing for
them. Their names are: Joseph Harris.
Frank Walstons, McAfee and his part
ner, Captain (irÂ«<n of Seattle, and Messrs.
Berry Lloyd, Davidson, King, Jones and
a partner of th<- las! Dami d
The building destroyed was owned by
Napoleon Dupras of Seattle, as Is also
the adjoining building. The burned build
ing had only been completed about a
month, and had been temporarily rented
by Rev. Wells Young as a Presbyterian
mission, and servta i had been held in
it only two or thr.-.- times. Mr. Young
was also about to start a pu). lit library
in the building. Mr. Dupras had planned
to connect this and the adjoining build
ing and open a large hotel there next
spring. He was going out over the ic..
to bring in certain things needful to this
purpose.
The tire has changed hi.- plans some
what, but he still contemplates the jour
ney ( U t. There was at the time of the
lire stored in one of the rooms sixty-live
pounds of dynamite, together with a
quantity of caps and giant powder. The
dynamite and powder burned before the
caps began to explode, it is presume.;, or
otherwise thire would have ) ti still an
other story. The caps kept exploding at
intervals for hours after they began.
At b o'clock this morning, 1 started
"out" with the Barnes party. I traveled
With them all day in order to get a prac
tical idea of the trip that ho many are
taking. Half the days travel was over
and through ice piled in such confusion
as to keep thÂ«Â» Sled bottom up much of
the time. A large part of the days jour
ney was through a slough of the river,
one of those horrors to the men poling
up stream, but where the ic t > was com
paratively smooth. We made camp at 4
o'clock, as it was then too dark to travel.
The temperature was 4r> below.
We camped in the WOOda on a high
bank, up which we carried the tent and
camping outfit and left the sled on the
trail. The snow w;ts a foot deep. We
felled a fir tree to get "feathers" for a
bed. found plenty of dry wood and the
inside of the tent was made warm and
comfortable in a few minutes. The dogs,
upon being released from harness, played

them taken into the tent, for the night
was very cold, and Dobson got up Jltctig
toward morning and built a lire, which
he kept going.
November Bâ Broke camp at 7 o'clock,
though still dark, and I started back,
while PaiUSS and DobBOB went on to
gether on their long tramp toward Dyea.
I passed two camps of men who had
been caught in the ice and who are mak
ing their way toward Dawson. I also
passed three men, each dragging a sled,
going out. They were Dr. K. \V. Croup
and R. H. Johnson of Walla Walla and
Henry Pierce of Arizona. They were
when I met them in the slough on the

undertaking, but there was nothing left
for them to do. They hail plenty Of pro
visions for the trip, and although they
would be compelled to travel slowly, ex
pected to get out all right.
November 24â A meeting was held this
evening at Pioneer Bali called by the
Pioneer* and the Chamber of Commerce
and Mining for the purpose of taking
steps toward the. establishment of a pub
lic library. A committee was appointed
to secure the loan or subscription of
books from those who have them.
Thursday. Nov. 2.'â The cries of men
rendered faint by distance awakened *me
early this morning. I heard what seemed
to be the crash of timbers also. I turned
toward the window. A faint red plow
tinned the frosted pane, and I knew that
another lire was in progress. My cabin is
on the hillside, just enough above the
level to command a complete view of the
town, that from this point extends under
the line of the river. The white roofs of
the little city were glistening in the light
of a blaze that it seemed must certainly
carry it out of existence this Thanks
giving morning. The flame rose from the
very center of the town, rolling from side
to side, like a fleeing snake. The cries
that announced the fire ceased and the
red blaze waved in the sky, silently.
Smoke, rendered dark and dense out of
proportion to the blaze by the low tem
perature, rose in immense circles, spread
ing and remaining above the city. From
liaek of the hills eastward, beyond the
Klondike to the white hills on the fur
ther side of the Yukon, across the hori
zon, the shimmering fingers of the aurora
reached up to the zenith. On the slopes
of the hill to my right and left the little
cabins of the new-comers were half bur

ness within of what was passing here.
Tlier.' was no wind: the night was as still
as it was silent. The thermometer regis

1 followed the trail down the hill and
out upon the frozen swamp and there
heard the scream of the snow under the
hurrying footsteps of some others too dis
tant to be seen, who bad been rouse, \ by
the tire and felt enough interest t<> come
out into this weather at this time of
night. Following First avenue straight
down its length parallel with the river,
! came to the scone of the tire. The

two-story building, was burning and the

of the opera-house adjoining. Roulette

mass, s of bedding and bedroom furniture,
pianos from the dance halls and heaps
of provisions were strewn along the edge
of the fire in the front and rear.
Although the streets were tilled with
people there was no noise save the r ,, ar
of the (lames and crash of the timbers
as they f,ll in the fire, or as men tore
them from neighboring buildings. A few
men, led by George Poster of Spokane,
swung a timber to batter down the burn
ing uprights of the M. and M., but the
Umbers were still ton tirm. There was
nothing to be done to save the buildings
already on tire, and excepting the few
engaged in carrying goods out of the
threatened houses all were spectators.
moving about to get the changing vl. Wfl
of the fire, speculating as to where it
would end and what effect the losses
would have upon the food situation.
Th- intense heat did not melt the snow
from the street Immediately about the
fire further than to cause a surface
dampness that impnr-^1 it under the feet
of the crowd and gave it the hard con
sistency Of j< c.
There had been a masquerade ball in
progress at the op. ra-house, which the
tire intÂ«>rrnpt-d. ThÂ« masqueraders had
been driven into the street In all the gro
tesque variety of t iHr costumes. With
them had mmc the girls from the other
dance halls and the men in furs almost
as grotesque as the masqueraders. Ifosi
of the women had run out wearing only
the light dothing in which they dance.
This queer crowd moved about the edsre
of the lire, compelled by the Intense cold
to keep close within the circle of warmth,
for just outside the touch of the weather
was most ; cute.
A little il. nkey *hat was brought In
this spring, and has become a familiar
figure beside the stove in the M. and M.
ran continually so close to the blare that
his hiiir whs singed.
As the flames took permanent hold on
the opera-house and ate through its
northern wall, three windows of the B6C
ond story were thrown suddenly out of
the shadow, the light of the tire b. ing
behind them. In the middle window
stood Mephisto of the masquerade ball,
throwing boxes and packages containing
certain treasures of the saloon to half
a dozen workers on the ground below.
The northern lights kept up their
dance overhead, and on the heights of the
white mountains to the east a line of
skeleton fir trees stood out distinctly
against thr night sky. The tossed and
broken Icefloes of the Yukon lay on the
westward side, and here and there, within
:i narrow circle, the fire touched some
.lagged point into bright distinction, but
the broad sweep of the inhospitable ice
stretched north and south into darkness.
The majesty and immensity of the setting
made the crotesquenesa of this act in the
great tragedy most notable.
Nov. 19.â The story of Alfred Anderson,
who has a lay on El Dorado, developed
to-day. He came down from the creek for
a little "time," did some drinking, went
round into one of the little red-blinded
houses in the back street and there mot
his wife, whom he had not seen for sev
eral years. Ho had built a home for her
in Wisconsin, then went to San Francisco
with the purpose of going "with a whaler,
got drunk, missed his boat, drifted to
Circle City and then came here. She went
to San Francisco, looking for him, learned
he had come to this country, followed
him, became discouraged in her search,
and so tin y met again in this house of the
abandoned. They decided to remain apart
hereafter.
Dec. l.â Wise Mike, the little donkey,
froze to (1. uth last night. His body
was found in the street this morning in
front of the El Dorado saloon. Wise Mik.
could not keep warm. He had the liberty
of the saloons to a great extent, and kept
so close to the stoves that his hide was
constantly being singed. He was also a
great nuisanco to the men who wanted to
get near the stove. At the burning of the
opera-house he ran into the fire several
times. It was too cold for Wise Mike.
Dec. 4.â J.iaquin Miller and party ar
rived from Circle City at 11 o'clock this
morning. Mr. Miller is badly frozen but
in good spirits. He came with a miner
and trader known as "Montana," and was
accompanied by Harold Canovan of Ot
tawa, with whom he started from Circle.
These two started without dogs, pulling
their outfit on a little red sled. I had a
talk with Mr. Miller
"I have had a severe experience," he
said. "I have lost a toe of the left foot
and my left ear is sloughing off. I have
to wear my hair down over it. How
ever, it does not matter. I shall not need
ears much longer. My cheeks are also
frosted. We got into all thi^ trouble jusi
about Forty Mile. We encountered a
blizzard there, the breath of which was
death. It v.as like confronting a bayonet
charge. We were at the time within a
mile and a half of a cabin, the location
of which we knew and we were eight
miles beyond Forty Mile. Rather than
face that wind for the mile and a half
a team that had kept with us turned back
over thy eight miles. Canovan, shortly
after we met the wind, complained that
his knee was freezing. He began to limp
and lean forward. I saw the dogs in
the other team turn back. I knew that
Canovan could not walk that eight miles.
It wag death to turn back or to stop for
a moment. Our dogs hesitated. Napoleon
could not have watched that charge at
the bridge at Lodi with closer interest
than did I the action of those dogs. In
watching the hank for the cabin I was
compelled to keep my head to one side,
the left being more exposed than the
other and there my ear suffered. We
passed on and with a turn of the river
we saw the smoke of the cabin curling
up to heaven like Incense. It was a little
cabin, built by two miners who had been
snowbound there. They presented it to
the Miners' Association for the purpose
to which it was devoted, refuge and res
cue. "We found the cabin so full that
there was no room to lie down, and we
had to take turns at sitting up by the
fire even after the three Indians had
generously withdrawn, going across the
river into a protected gulch to make camp
until the wind should subside.
"Yes, I have had enough of it, but I
cannot remain here. I must go on out.
There are so many claims on me out there.
I am getting old, I have no time to waste.
I cannot remain in here. I built my lit
tle home you know upon the Heights and
I want to go and enjoy it. That view of
the Bay of San Francisco has a fascina
tion for me.
"About my trip up the river? Well,
we lf-ft Circle City on the morning of the
27th of October. They brought a dead
man in there, the body having been
chopped out of the ice, and another
whose feet were frozen and had to be
amputated. There was something of a
panic in the camp. It was thought that
there must be great numbers OB the rivi-r
probably frozen. They were going to hol<i
a miners' meeting to keep me from start
ing out. but I told them to go to the
devil; that I was determined to tarry
there no looser. The more of death and
suffering there was on the rtvei, the
mi>n- 1 would have to go. Well, we could
get no dogs that were worth having, and
so determined to come without any. We
had rol.es and everything of the lightest
character; two tents for protection
against snow, hut used only one. It was
a little tent. o(*>n in the front. We car
ru-.i no stove, but built a campfire every
night ami slept with our feet toward it.
We did not suffer at night, but slept
comfortably enough. We carried crack
ers and canned meats and bad little
cooking or baking to do, but. oh, how
one <ats on the trail. And I have made
a discovery. Perhaps it is not a discov
ery, bat it is new with me. While I was
working along the trail, keeping the sled
rlKht side upâ that is really the hardest
job â while I was at that tor hours, with
no one to talk to, I would see things here
and there that appealed to me in my
trade. I would be forever putting them
in place, arranging them in older, you
know. Well. I discovered that that sort
of thine: was most exnaiisting: I would
suddenly feel that some one had touched
the hem of my garment. This is a won
derful and 1-eautiful country. There is
endless material here for my trade.
"It Man like a providence that the
story of this country should be reserved
for me to the last. Well, we traveled to
the place where the body of Anderson
hail been found and saw a valise there
and some candles, also s.imc flour, cooked.
A raven was flying overhead. His croak
was like chunks of Ice. You could hear
th*m falling on the floes. We tented
there under a bluff and an avalanche of
snow on <>ur tent tauKht ub to keep away
from Muffs. We moved along very slow
ly on the river Ice. We got in the water
once and directly sat on the sled and
changed our footwear. On the seventh
day we saw MMM people on the other side
of the river and we spent the day cross
ing over. There we found a trail and
plenty of wood. We gathered some high
bush cranberries also. They were so
thick that we scooped them Into our
hands. They were delicious. I saw a
woodpecker there also. The second day
.after we crossed, the river gorged. It
was terrific. We were on the Ice above
the gorge. It rose about ten feet and
then the water fell. The ice piled up
while, underneath the river panted and
gasped like some fearful and unheard-of
monster. At times it kept up what seemed
like the discharge of artillery. Our sled
was wholly submerged in the water once.
We saw some horses that had been on
a barge as we were making our way
out for a long time. The camps were
very monotonous. We fed witÂ»Â» Indians
several times, and were glad of the
chance. We hired Indians to help us
alÂ«">ng over certain stages.
"We passed boats almost every day that
had been caught in the Ice. We began to
meet numbers of people, especially trad
ers. They nearly all feed their dogs
frightfully. One trader had a beautiful
hound, a Newfoundland and a Mameluke.
The hound cried pitifully under the treat
ment and he beat It for crying. He beat
the hound to death. He left the New
foundland at Forty Mile. The Indian
dogs endure everything, but the others
can't. I know that this cruelty is not
necessary, for I asked 'Montana,' the
man who brought me in, how often he
beat his dogs. He answered: 'Never,
that is why they are so fat and work so
well.* The dog beating must stop.
"We had a most terrible experience at
the whirlpool below Forty Mile. They
may speak of cold waves in other parts of
the earth; I would call them 'streaks.'
Here are places where the cold takes
hold of you like the hand of death. You
feel it instantly you enter it, and again
when you leave. At the whirlpool the
wind has polished the ice smooth with
the sharp points of snow. We struck the
cold streak, and everybody cut loose and
ran for shelter, but we went on to the
cabin. We were two days making the five
miles between the wreck of the Arctic
and Forty Mile.
"At Forty Mile we were treated like
Princes. They gave us a musical enter

"A young man named Alfred Thayer.
a freighter, who reached Forty Mile about
the same time we did, fell in the same

the third day we started on again, and it
was that day I was so badly frozen and
that we found the little cabin, greatly to
our relief. It shall be my one demand
that a train of these cabins be built at
convenient intervals along the Yukon by
the Government. It is through such
means that this country must be con
quered, not with guns. These cabins
should have a man stationed who would
be ready to lend aid to those who need it.
They might be utilized as postoffices. We
miners have begun this work, and the
Government should nnish it. In the cab
ins established by the miners every man
entering there finds wood and matches
ready for him, and ,no man has been
found so mean as to neglect to prepare
for the next man what he has found
prepared for him.
'"The small cabin up from Forty-mile
is one of these. We found there Cap
tain Geiger, a Puget Sound man, Purser
Ball, late of the Bella, and h.is partnor,
two small traders, one of them from Ma
rin County, Cal., who had a wrist so
badly frozen that I was sure he would
lose it. From Forty-mile I came on with
'Montana.' He had dogs and a light load
and I rode a part of the way. I shall
rest up here at least a month."
Tom Nash was arrested to-day on the
charge of having tired the M. and M. sa
loon, resulting in the destruction also of
the opera-house and the Dominion sa
loon. Nash was formerly bartender ar.d
gold weigher or cashier in the Jf. and M.
McDonald suspected him of dishonesty
and discharged him. Nash was very
angry and made open threats that he
would get revenge; that he would bum
the place. That was a few days betore
tho tire.
In ill.- r.cantime Nash bought a half
interest in another saloon, paying $10,000
cash for the same. The tire started in
McDonald':; own room while McDonald
\v;:s downstairs. Mitchell, his partner,
saw the smoke, ran in and saw the oed
on fire, but was unable to extinguish it.
He found the rear door open when it was
supposed to be and should have been
locked. Nash retained his key to th;:t
door, and is said to be the only man
other than the proprietors who had a
key. TnN is the circumstantial evidence
upon which the charge is bastd. Nash is
still in the lockup.
VAST FORTUNES ARE
BEING DUG FROM
DOG CREEK CLAIMS.
James Glover Writes of the Riches of the
Klondike, and Predicts That $7,000,000
Will Be Brought Down in July.
POMONA, Jan. 10.â William Glover
of Ontario, in this locality, has received
a letter from his brother James, dated
Dawson City, December 2. The letter
was taken to Seattle and mailed from
there. James Glover writes that he is
among seventeen men who have located
claims on a very small stream tribu
tary to the Klondike River that was
not known until June. It is now
known as Dog Creek. Glover writes
that every one in the camp is making a
fortune; that the best pay gravel there
is but eighteen feet below the surface.
He says that before the cold, freezing
weather came on several miners on Dog
(.'reek were each able to wash out $200
worth of gold every day. and none got
less than ten ounces a day. He says
he believes that over $7,000,000 will be
brought down from Dawson City be
fore next July. Several men who have
been mining continuously on El Dorado
and Bonanza creeks since the first
Klondike discoveries in September,
1596. art: going to come down on the
earliest boats on the Yukon River.
These men have each about from $150,
000 to $175,000 in nuggets and dust.
Glover says that he has now two oil
cans full of gold, preparatory to send
ing down to San Francisco next sum
mer.
BRING NEWS OF
THE DISCOVERY OF
THE MOTHER LODE.
Returning Klondikers Tell of the Wonderful
Finds of the Quartz Origin of the
Piacers of the New El Dorado.
SEATTLE, Wash., Jan. 10.â The
steamer City of Topeka, which arrived
here this afternoon from Juneau, Alas
ka, had among her passengers nine men
who left Dawson City December 9.
They were: W. J. Jones, Port Towns
end, Wash.; D. D. Stewart, Juneau,
Alaska; A. Solder. Nova Scotia; E. C.
Arnold, Sun Francisco; W. G. Stenper,
Colville, Wash.; Harry Miller, Col
ville. Wash.; J. Cordroy, Denver, Col.;
George Anderson, Tacoma, and Robert
Johnson, Tacoma.
They bring news of the discovery of
what is supposed to be the mother
lode and quartz origin of the placers of
the Klondike district. The discovery
was made within twenty-four hours at
four different points, one of them at the
Dome, a high mountain to the east of
the source of El Dorado Creek by
Frank Slavin, the second one at No. 31
El Dorado by A. H. Jose and partner,
the third one on Nugget Gulch at No.
16, and the fourth somewhere in the
twenties on Bonanza Creek. The trend
of the vein is northwest by west, west
erly from the Dome. It is found at
about thirty feet below the surface and
under the muck and alluvial deposit.
The ledge is about eighteen inches wide
and makes a uniform width. It is gen
erously sprinkled with free gold. One
of the men brings down samples of the
ore and every one who has seen them
says the rock is precisely the same in
character as found in the Comet mine
at Berners Way, Southeastern Alaska.
In no instance was the quartz discov
ery made by the men who owned the
placer claims, and the locators of the
quartz ledge thus acquire a separate
and distinct title from the locators of
the placer.
The discovery of the ledge on No
31 El Dorado was made by a man who
was working the placer for the owner.
A shot was put in and about fifty
pounds of ore blasted out. The great
est excitement prevails and no man will
listen to any suggestion to sell his
claim until further development has
been made.
Another Klondiker says: "The out
put of gold in the spring will be from
$15,000,000 to $25,000,000. This opinion is
concurred in by the transportation
companies 1 managers and Alexander
McDonald, the richest man in the Klon
dike. Five millions of dust is now
stored in Dawson. $3,500,000 of which
would have come out this fall had the
boat reached Dawson "

BOSTON, Mass., .lan. 10.â F. D. New
ton, a prosperous farmer, his wife.
Sarah, and their 10-year-old adopted
daughter, Ethel, were butchered in
their houso about two miles from
Brookfield Centre, on the road to Stur
bridge. The crime was discovered by
neighbors, who heard the lowing of the
cattl â¢ and made an investigation. The
three members of the family were
found in their blood-soaked b>ds. hav
ing l>e*-n horribly killed with an ax.
A hire. l man. who lias been employed
!,\ Newton, is missing, and the author
ities are making a sharp search tor
him. He was known only by the name
of Paul. He was last seen Friday nigh;
just before midnight by neighbors
who were returning from a grange
meeting. He was then more than a
mile from the Newton house and was
going in the direction of Brookfield.
Prom this it Is believed that the mur
der was committed between 1" and
II p. in.
When Newton did not appear, the
neighbors made an Investigation.
As they passed the parlor windows
one of the men rio'ioed that a
pane of glass had been broken. They
opened the window and crawled into
thi- room. As soon as their eyes rested
upon the apartment they saw that
some one had thoroughly ransacked the j
place. Following their search the
neighbors entered a small bedroom at
th>- real of the house. On a blood
stained bed lay the bodies of Mrs. New
ton and the little girL They were
dressed hut their clothing was torn and
biood-st.-un.-. 1. Near th< bed was a
blood-stained ax. which evidently was
the weapon used. Upstairs in the
chamber usually occupied by Mr New
ton, which connected with that oc< u
pied by the hived man, Paul, lay the
body of the farmer on ih" bed. Ail
about were evidences that he had !>â¢â¢.â ::

or' his family. He was also dr.
The coverings of the bed bad been
drawn at his head so as to conceal any
wounds which might be thereon. The
bed in Paul's room had been occupied.
but there was no other trace of the
hired man.
Paul is a foreigner but his national
ity is not known. IiÂ»- was about 30.
short and compactly built, and has
been employed on the Newton farm
for about two months. The motive of
the crime is not known. Robbery has
been referred to as a probable cause,
but that, it is thought, does not account
for the slaughter of the whole family.
Moreover. Mr. Newton's gold watch
was found in his vest, which hui-.g over
a chair-back in his chamber.
Duiing the forenoon if i eveloped that
the tired man, Paul, had b.-.-n heard
to call himself Miller, but whether thaf
is his true name or not it cannot be
ascertained at present. All trace
him as far as the officials could learn
was lost after he passed George Pik â 
and Arthur Ki.-e. who were the young
men who saw him Friday nigh. Both
of these men recognized Paul and spoke
to him. they say. but he seemed to
wish to avoid recognition and. turning
away his head, did noi respond to their
greeting.
An attempt was made to conceal the
murder by setting fire to the house.
Kerosene was discovered on the Boor
of the woodshed, and a lamp was found
bo placed that it would have set fire to
the woo,]. One stick was burned
through, but for some unknown reason
a blaze was averted.
A man answering the description of
Paul Miller, w Ik > came into station 2
af Worcester as a locger, has been
held pending an Investigation. He is
a farmhand and dressed shabbily, and
in many respects answers the descrip
tion of Miller.
HIDDEN SECRET
COMES TO LIGHT
The Late Joseph T. Middleton
of San Jose Left a
Daughter.
After Many YearfiShe Is H^ard From

the Estate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 10.â Some interesting
hidden history in the family life of
Joseph T. Middleton has come to liÃht
since his death and will soon lÂ»o aired
;in court. This was brought out by a
, petition Bled by Attorney Scheller in
the estate proceedings to-day for the
purpose of determining the heirship of
Mrs. Isabel Martin of Dundee, Scot
i land, who has advanced an almost in
disputable claim to being a daughter.
Middleton died a couple of months
| ago, leaving an estate worth $IÂ»s,<iqo. At
' that time it was not known there was
; a foreign heir, but since then an inter
esting story has come out. Middleton
! was twice married. His lirst wife
i died in Scotland, and thirty-five years
ago he came to the United States, leav
ing behind him a girl child, the issue
!of his first marriage. Thirty fears
: apo he married the woman who' sur
vives him. In this time he accumu
â  lated about $lfi.oo<i worth of property.
ThÂ°re were no children by the second
marriage, and as Hlddleton never told
his wife that he had been married be
; fore she believed aerself to be tho sole
heir until Mrs. Isabel Martin pro
; claimed herself a child of Middleton
and claimed half of his estate.
The matter will be settled on Janu
ary "21. tor if Mrs. Martin can estab
lish her relationship to Middieton a con
' test will be useless.

ARE LOST AT SEA
Two Boats and Their Crews,
CoQsistiQg of Thirty-Six
Men, Â£Jre Given Up
for Dead.
BOSTON. Jan. 10.â A special from GlOacester, Mass.. says: After
hopinp against hope that the passing days might bring some tidings of
the overdue schooners Hustler and John EL M'Kenzie, their owners
nave been breed to the conclusion that thÂ»- vessels have foundered and
that their crews of thirty-six men have perished. The Hustler was
owned by James EL 'l air & Brothers and left h<*i August I,'N to engage
in the bank cod-fishery under command of Captain Alexander J. Mc-
Fadden. On the tÂ»th of October the Hustler put into Harbor Maine, N.
F., and procured a supply of bait. Captain IfcFadden wrote home that
he had HO tubs of fish on board and would return to the southern
part "f the banks to complete his trip.
Since leaving Harbor Maine absolutely no tiding* of the vessel have
ever been received, and it is thought sho foundered in the great gale
which swept the (Jrand Ranks on October 19 anil which created such
havoc among the lishing fleet.
The Hustler was a stanch craft of 92.7 tons, built at Essex in ISP9,
valued at $>"<J and insured for $4571 on the vessel and $1700 on outfits.
She carried a crew of eighteen men, two of whom were married and
the owners state they were as fine a set of young men as they ever
had in one vessel.
Messrs. Hugh I'arkhurst & Co., owners of the schooner John E. Mc-
KeiUEie, give up all hopes of that vessel ever returning to port. Twelve
weeks ago the vessel sailed from this port on a bank halihuting trip
under command of Captain Andrew ICcKenzie. and from that day to
this not a single word has been heard from her and as she was In

saunas. Jan. 10.â a severe wife
beating affair has <>>niÂ«' to light, hap
pening m this city last evening. The
wife, it is claimed, has been left desti
tute and with two small children. The
husband has been on a protracted spree
for some time, and yesterday afternoon
he returned hnmc His \\ if <â¢ was not
well, anyway, and the children, it is
said l<y neighbors, were crying '>n ac
count "f tin cold, there being no tin- in
ihÂ«- house ti> warm them, and no fuel
to build one. The wife remonstrated
with her husband at his conduct and
t Â« Â»i Â«J him Imploringly of' his family's
wants. He became angry and attack
ed her fust by slapping her face. She
attempted to defend herself by several
means, but her husband being much
more powerful, easily silenced her Into
submission. When she could stand the
mistreatment no longer she screamed
l<>ud!y. The woman's cries were heard
t>y a man who ii\.-d n>ai. and he im
mediately ran t<> the hou.=e. TaKing in
the situation quickly he pounced upon
the wife-beater. The rescuer, however,
was no match for the husband and re
ceived many bad blows from the now
thoroughly Infuriated husband.
As soon as the husband ceased beat-
Ing his wife in order to attend to the
other man she ran from the house and
to town as last as possible. She found
City Marshal Joyce and told him in
few words the trouble. He could easily
imagine th>- necessity of his services by
the woman's condition and he lost no
time in reaching the house where the
disturbance occurred. The marshal
found things in a bad state, and he
forthwith attempted to arrest th>- man.
But the man resisted the officer very
forcibly. There was aunt her struggle,
which proved to be quite a bloody af
fair. Th- marshal Â«ks trying all the
time to place h naii' of handcuffs on
his man, but could not do so. The fel
low would strike th" officer again and
again.
Although quite an old man Joyce was
v< ry aÂ«tive, and would not give up.
The fellow s>-*-i i. jj he could not beat the
officer by striking him. tried t<> bite
him. and succeeded in horribly lacerat
ing the officer's hand. The frenzied
man was finally taken prisoner and
lodged in jail to await trial, which will
be on Wednesday before Judge Brown.

FUGITIVE TOM SAWYER
TURNS UP IN IDAHO.
Or.c of the Three Ruffians Who Murdered
Old Man Tuilisâ The Other
Two Hanged.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 10.- Sheriff
Frank T. Johnson is in receipt of a tH
pÃram to the effect that Tom Lawton,
one of the *janÃ th.it murdered old man
Tuilis in I*7B, has been seen in Idaho,
and can be arrested as soon as requisi
tion papers are received.
Lawton is the third of the nang <rf
Tuilis murderers, of which Troy Dye,
the public administrator, and Edward
Anderson, both of whom were hanged
for the crime, were the other two. In
their confession Dye and Anderson Im
plicated Lawton, but Lawton skipped,
and the officers were never able to lo
cate him.
It is believed that there will be preat
<-r difficulty in convicting Lawton, even
if he is found, as the crime was com
mitted nearly twenty years ago, and
the evidence which could he marshaled
against him at this tlmÂ« is very meag
er.

port a bold attempt at highway rob
bery as having taken plai c last even- ;

driving to this city when a highway
man stopped them. San Miguel Can

road near a steep lilii through this
canyon proved to be the most appro

his ciime. A long scantling was placed
across the road and about two feel
from the ground. The highwayman
was dressed In sacks and was at one
end of th" scantling, and being clothed
in sui !i material could not be distin
guished ten feet away.
The team was ascending a hill in the
canyon. It was quite dark, the moon
not having arisen at that hour, and the
shade of the trees of the canyon made
the road still more gloomy. Just at

McKINLEY WILL SEND
ANOTHER COMMISSION
TO THE NATIONS.
The President Yet Stands Firmly for Bi
metallism and Intends to Continue
to Work for It.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10.â Senior
Chandler's interview with the President
this morning and subsequent declara
tion that President IfcKinley stands
firmly for international bimetallism,
and that he intends to send envoys to
Europe again as soon as conditions
Change, created much comment at the
capital and pleased those Senators and
Representatives who are opposed to
taking up the Gage bill at a time when
there is no possibility of enacting it
into law.
Senator Chandler declared that
President McKlnley is earnestly in
favor of the use of both metals as is
the Senator. The statement is regarded
as a rebuke by the President for the
self-constituted Republican "bosses,"
who have been threatening with venge
ance all Republicans who are not ready
to vote for the retirement of gren
backs and for the Gage bill.
The President explained his position
in regard to the sold reserve by say
ing that when the greenbacks were
used to deplete the supply of yellow
metal they should themselves be treat
ed as gold and only paid out in lieu of
gold. He disavowed any intention of
retiring greenbacks. This statement is
regarded as a declaration of war by
the President on. Secretary Gage.

But It Is Already Indicated That Im

Not Bo Aided.
Ppecial Dispatch to Th* Call.
PAKIS. Jan. lo- Tho trial by court
martial of Major Count Ferdinand Wal
ter Knt"! hazy, th>- retired officer of the
French army who fame into promi
nence in the latter part of November
through the publication by Figaro of a
number of letters which inn Count is
alleged t" hay,- written reflecting i"
strong language on France ami the
French army, was opened this morning
under the presidency of Genera! iv
Luxer.
Among those who rilled the hall were
Mmc. Dreyfus, wife of Albert Dreyfus,
the former Captain of the French ar
tillery now undergoing imprisonment
for life for having been convicted i>l
selling important French military plans
t" agents of a foreign power, with
which affair Esterhasy is said t > have
i n connected, also thÂ«* brother of
Mme. Dreyfus. Senator Tralrt ux, the
former Minister of Justice and Depu
ties.
<â ' rnt Bsterhasy appeared in uniform
ami was escorted by Republican
guards.
The clerk of the court said the court
martial was held in order to end the
contradictory rumors which had been
spread by the excited pubiic. There
upon Mauri- la Uorie, counsel for Mme.
Dreyfus, asked permission to take part
in the argument. The counsel for .\>.i
thieu Dreyfus also a.sked to appear
during the proceedings. The court re
ject""! both applications, ami the taking
of testimony commenced.
Counsel for the (Government said
thai a public trial might be inimiral
to the Interests Â«>!' the national defense
and demanded a secret bearing.
'I be court decided by a majority of
five i" two that the trial should be pub
lic until the moment when publicity
might appear to prejudice the national
i be court having thus yielded t<Â» pub
llc opinion, the report of the Investi
gation officer, Major Kavarry, vas
read. Ii completely whitewashed
Count Bsterhasy and was generally re
garded as being a serious Indictment
of Colonel PiCQuart, whose arrest when
this trial is finished is anticipated.
Colonel Pfcquart, according to the
Intralsigeant, wus In the tatter part of
November sentenced to thirty days' de
tention In a fortress. He was an otti
cer summoned from the United States
to Paris in connection with the Drey-
Ins affair, and his statements were re
ported to be the basis of the accusa
tions brought against Count Ksterhazy.
The report of afajor Rlvarry does not
adduce much evidence except the dec-,
laration of the experts that the famous
borderau (note) was not written by
Count Ksterhazy. It contains the
Count's protest against the "calumni
ous imputations" made by Colonel Pic
quait. who, it appears, without author
ity, caused him to be shadowed. The
colonel, observes the report, is the soul
of the preseni agitation, and declares !
he is guilty <rt serious shortcomings and
indiscretions.
I pon one occasion, it is pointed out,
when hi? superiors urged him not to
persist, he exclaimed: "(>h, they won't
do anything up there, but I will com
pel them to act."
The report continues with the state
ment that Colonel Picquart, in 1896.
was surprised while examining; secret
documents belonging to the general
' staff, and concludes:
"Every st--p taken in this sad affair,
which caused so much anguish to all
really French hearts, is Intended to ob
tain a reversal of a judgment legally
and Justly pronounced. Xo tangible
proof of Major Esterhazys guilt is
forthcoming, nor is there adequate cvi
â  deuce to support the charge erf high
treason."
The court then adjourned until 2
1 o'clock. When the trial was resumed
Major Ksterhazy testified that he be
came aware of the plot against him j
through anonymous letters which led j
to his meeting an unknown veiled wom
an. He had communicated the results
of that meeting to General Billot, the
Minister of War, and President Faure.
The judge put a series of easy qu<:3
'â  tions to Major Esterhazy. to which the
latter evidently had already made an
' swers. The major ended by following
Major Ravary's cue and accused Colo
nel Picquart of burglarizing his resi
dence and stealing letters.
Mathleu PreyfUfl was then examined.
He was asked to state the basis of his
I accusation against Major Esterhazy.
I and replied that, without being an ex
pert, it was only necessary to compare
i the writing in the bordeau antl Major
' EJsterhasy's handwriting, in order to
be convinced that they were identical.
; Continuing. Mathieu Dreyfus made a
learned graphologlcal statement. More
over, he pointed to the fact that Major
Esterhazy had subsequently tried
to modify his handwriting, as a con
firmation of his suspicions.
In reviewing other suspicious actions
; of the maj>r. If. Dreyfus quoted a let
ter in which Esterhazy said: "I am in
, such a plight that I can only recover
myself by crime."
'This.' said M. Dreyfus, dramati
cally, "was written by an officer who
has the honor to wear the uniform of
i a French officer."
Here "Oh's" were heard among the
| audience.
Counsel for Major Esterhazy there
upon asked M. . Dreyfus who was pay
ing the "enormous costs of circulating
i pamphlets respecting Major Ester
basy." to which M. Dreyfus replied:
"That is my business, not yours."
This remark caused excitement
among those present and brought forth
shouts of "miserable."

SAN DIECiO. Jan. 10.â The storm'j
that has prevailed in this county Cor
the past three days reached its height
to-day, when copious showers fell in
city and country. Snow covered the j
mountains around about, making a
beautiful and novel sight. The temper
ature is normal, in spite of the preflii â¢- i
tions of a dangerous frost to-night.
Lyons Peak, the bold headland that :
stands out from the smaller mountains
east of the city, is covered with snow.
This is the second time that snow has
fallen therÂ»- in the memory of the old
est inhabitant. Indian or white. Th>'
peak is high, but only twenty miles
from the coast, and within ten miles of
it are thousands of acres of land that
have never felt the touch of frost. Lem
ons and oranjies are flourishing and
ripening there, with the snow's cold
breath menacing them, but unless the
weather turns completely upside down
there is no danger. In the higher moun
tains, within view of the city, ranging
back to sixty miles from the coast, th;'
snowfall has been quite large, reaching'
a loot at Cuyamaca, in the Laguna
mountains.
Even at Morena Dam. 3100 feet above
sea level, eight inches of snow fell to
day. The rainfall previous to the snow
fall was over two inches, insuring an
immense catchment in the new reser
voir. Cuyamaca Lake, the feeder of the
city. <ontained only a few hundred
thousand gallons before this storm, but !
it is now rising and the danger of a wa
ter famine is believed to be past.
Four-fifths of the barley and wheat
of this se-tion is in the ground and
was starving for rain before this storm.
! The rainfall means prosperity instead
of hard times. The deficiency of pre
cipitation in this city is still two inches i
below normal, but the experience of
former years indicates that it will be
made up, and even surpassed during
January and February. The present
downpour is worth hundreds of thou
sands of dollars, but it will not be
enough to place crops beyond the need
Â«>;" more moisture in due time.
The view from the city of San Diego
was marked by strangers as being the
most superb they had ever seen.
Palms, lemon groves, and all kinds of
green growth, roses and violets bloom

RIVERSIDE. Jan. 10.â There was a
1 >i ii surprise in store for Riversiders
this morning when they peered out of !
doors. Lawns and roof tops were
everywhere covered with snow, and or
ange trees hud added to their burden
of golden fruit a considerable weight. "
I The hills and mountains, of which
I glimpses could be obtained when the
clouds lifted, had their rugged outlines :
softened by a coat of snow several
I in<hes deep. The snow fell between
midnight and morning. A heavy rain
followed and melted the snow in town â 
! by 16 a. m.. but the adjacent moun
tains are still covered. The snow did â 
; no damage to either fruit or trees in :
j this valley. Reports from Moreno, j
i Alessandro, Perris and San Jacinto are
i to the effect that over two inches of
I snow fell at these places last night
i It disappeared with the advent of the

â  heavy clouds indicate a renewal of the
I storm to-night.

INDEMNITY
His Claim Argued Before
the State Department
at "Washington.
Efforts to Cause the United
States to Compel the
Payment.
But the Whole Question Hinctea
Upon the American Citizenship
of Dr. Herz.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Jan. 10.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following:: Another chapter in the
great Panama canal scandal was in
augurated to-day by efforts set on
foot to have the United States compel
France to indemnify Dr. Cornelius Hera
to the extent of $5,000,000.
Solicitor of the State Department
Penfield heard arguments submitted in
behalf of the claimant by his attor
ns*. Edward Lauterbach. A. J. Ditten
hoefer and Herbert R. Umburser of
Xe\v York. The department declined
some months ago to press the claim of
Dr. Herz on the ground that he was
not an American citizen, but the argu
ments made by his attorneys to-day
seem to show he is a citizen, and if his
citizenship is proved the probabilities
are that the matter will be laid before
the French Government.
Dr. Hen's claim for indemnity wa*
based upon the arbitrary arrest he suf
fered as a result of the action of the
French republic, his detention, pro
longed prosecution, and alleged extor
tion, blackmail and confiscation of
property.
In support of Dr. Herz's claim to the
protection of the United States, his
counsel said he was brought to this
country by his parents when 4 year 3
old, was educated here, and the French
Government recognised him as an
American citizen. Dr. H'-rz was in
England in lfc!Â»2. when the Panama
< anal scandal first began to attract the
public attention of France. He was \ir
genily appealed to by Baron de Rein
ach and various members of the exist
ing French Government to return to
Paris for a few days, in order, through
his influence and ability, to help put an
end to the scandals. He went to Paris,
but matters did not improve, and he
returned to England, where he became
seriously ill.

HANNA SHORT ONE VOTE.
Lively Skirmishing Before the Battle
in the Legislature Which
Will Begin To-Day.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLUMBUS, 0., Jan. 10.â Senator
Ilanna is believed to be short to-night
one vote of election. The opposition is
not sure of 73 .votes for any one man
as against only 72 for Hanna, but they
feel confident, at least, of preventing
Hanna's election.
Last night the Democratic steering
committee demanded of Mr. Kurtz that
he furnish at least eight affidavits to
night from Republican members that
they would stand with the sixty-one
Democrats in voting against Hanna.
The Democratic'steering committee re
ported to-night that they were satisfied.
Representative Gayman, chairman of
the House Democratic steering com
mittee, went so far as to say that Han
na's defeat to-morrow is assured.
There is no doubt that Senator Han
na was beaten for a week previous to
last Friday, when Representative Man
uel of Montgomery County changed in
his favor. On Saturday the Hanna
men secured Representative Griffith of
Union, but they made no accessions
yesterday and to-day, and it is the gen
eral belief that they are short one vote
to-night.
It has been agreed by a conference
committee that the balloting in the two
houses will not begin until 2 p. m. to
morrow, and there may be several
changes in that time. The real work
of the fight on both sides is being done
to-nijjht. The workers will nut sleep
now until after the balloting begins.
There is a feeiin^ among many of those
opposing Hainui that if he fs not de
feated on the first ballot, or rather, by
the separate ballots to-morrow, he
will not be defeated at all. These anti-
Hanna workers say they had a major
ity of five against Hanna when they
exposed their strength in organizing
the Legislature last Monday, and, if
they come down to a majority of only
one against Hanna to-morrow the
coalition may not hold together for
another day.
While the opposition still insists on
Kurtz as the candidate against Hanna
yet they say that Bushnell, Kurtz, or
any other one will be dropped U s soon
as it is demonstrated that he cannot
secure all of the votes of either th"
anti-Hanna Republicans or the Demo
cratic members, one of the names
most prominently mentioned to-day
â was that of Representative John P.
Jones, who represents Srark county,
the home of President McKinley. Mr.
Jones is a Republican and a prominent
man in the Miners 1 Union. He is for
free silver and is advocated as the la
bor candidate against the capitalist.
While the mass convention of the
Republicans this afternoon was the
largest and most indignantly enthusi
astic assemblage ever known in this
State, the doubtful Republican mem
bers of the Legislature did not see it
or feel it. They were closely and lib
erally entertained by the opposition at
the Great Southern Hotel during the
afternoon and they were there to
night.
Representatives Manuel, Griffith.
Snyder and others are having the un
divided and constant attention of the
other sides. There are at times lively
scenes when the Hanna members in
vade the com in i t tee's room at the
Great Southern Hotel and also when
the hustlers for the opposition come
to the Neil House after some of the
doubtful members or their friends.
There is to-night doubt also about the
final vote of some of those on whom
both sides have been depending. The
result really hangs in doubt more
than in a balance.
With the result pending upon one
vote either way there are several who
want to be on the winning side and
may at any time change, according to
their belief, as to which side has the
necessary seventy-three votes, or for
some other cause.
Owing to the apparent closeness of
the vote, there are still rumors of
bribery for another vote either way.
It is noted by some of the more con
servative'observers that as soon as no
further changes were announced each
day the contending factions alter
nated in daily reports of bribery. The
Hanna men claim to have steno
graphic notes of an offer of $5000 by
two prominent members of the oppo
sition. The opposition in turn claim
that B. D. Hollenbeck, a member of
the Republican State executive com
mittee, went to Cincinnati Saturday
with $10,000. Representative Otis is a
Republican who was elected on a fu
sion ticket in Hamilton County. He
has voted with the Democrats in the
organization. But it is claimed that
he made friendly overtures to Hanna
workers to entrap them into an offer
for the purpose of exposing the same,
and he will do so on the floor of the
House. It is said that Representative
Otis will pile $10,000 on his desk to
morrow and make a sensational speech
when his name is called on the Sena
torial ballot. The Hanna men make a
general denial of the Otis charges and
say that they anticipate other dra
matic performances to-morrow before
the balloting begins.
Outside the opposition Senatorial
quarters the city is filled to-night with
â¢xewÃipnists yelling jthemsolvjes hoarse
for Hanna. The crowds and th^ px
citement surpass any of the usual con
v.-nt lon scenes.
Colonel T. C . Campbell, Jerry P.
Bliss and others opposing Hanna ar
rived with Representative John C.
Otis from Cincinnati to-night. Several
thousand words of Senatorial matter
was soon after given out to members
of the press about the offers of bribery
to Representative Otis. It was pre
pared by Colonel Campbell, and makes
two pages on a late extra edition that
was gotten out during the night by
the Evening Press, the organ of the
anti-Hanna combine.
A summary of the long story, ac
cording to Colonel Campbell's "state
ment, is that Henry X. Boroe of New
York and formerly of l,os Angeles,
Cal.. called on Colonel Campbell last
Friday at the tatter's office in Cincin
nati and offered Campbell (10,000 for a
fee to get Representative Otis to \<>t<
for Hanna. Campbell and Otis had
frequent meetings with Boyce, who
claimed to be representing J. Plerpont
Morgan and others who have interests
In Ohio that might be affected by leg
islation in Ohio. Colonel Campbell and
Representative Otis say they deter
mined to give Boyce all the latitude he
wanted and set a trap to catch him.
Hollenbeck. who was snid to be the
middle-man, was also taken into their
counsel according to the statements.
Campbell and Otis say the money was
produced and that they are holding it
in trust, and that a statement accord
ingly will be made in the House to
morrow.
Following the publication of this
statement to-night a statement was
given out at the Hanna headquarters
in which they say:
The charge that Representative Otis
has been .ottered a bribe by a representa
tive of l an a is denounced at Senator
Hanna s headquarters as not only false
th/ 7ry D^oular. but characteristic of
the campaign Of tricks and treachery
that Kurtz Myers and their associates
..n^tiV," 1 ' On eVe slllce the Senatorial
question came up. It has been known to
me Republican managers for a consid
erable time that this stage play for ef
fect was contemplated it is known posi
tively that Allen O. Myers said several
days ago . that he expected to see some
member rise in his place on the day of

Â£000 or $10,000 which he Would state had
been given him as a bribe to vote for
Senator Hanna. This statement was
made a week or more ago, but it is now
asserted that the proposition upon which
it is Intended to build this stage effect
was made to Representative Otis only
three days since. The fact that the an
nouncement of a programme of tins sort
was made long before the day on which
it is now charged that the incident took
place, shows clearly that the whole story
is a prearranged one and simply manu
factured by .Myers and his associates for
effect. There is not. say Mr. Hanna's
friends and managers, one single word of
truth in these statements. â¢ â¢ â¢
It is also known thai a New York news
paper which has fought Mr. Hanna vi
ciously from the time that he assumed
charge of the national campaign in Is%.
dispatched a mysterious messenger to
Ohio recently with large sums of money
and it is not Improbable that numerous
other bribery fakes will be sprung upon
the public from day to day in the effort
to play to a linHh the desperate game
begun months ago. â¢ â¢ â¢
Mr. Hanna's friends hold in their hands
absolute evidence that offers of bribes
were made to Republicans by men com
ing direct from Uliss and Kurtz, and
know the value of them too well to be
afraid to show their hand before they
are ready to make use of them. â¢ â¢ â¢
Mr. Hollenbeck. about whose visit to
Cincinnati a vast amount of mystery is

denial as relates to himself will be forth
coming as soon as the statements reach
him.
The opposition insist that Hollen

ROCKIIILL FOR THE
CHINESE MISSION
Probability That the Present
Minister to Greece Will
Be Chosen.
The Transfer Would Be Agreeable to
Both Himself end Charles
Page Bryan. Â«
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. Jan. 10.â A Washington
special says: Assistant Secretary ft
State Day this afternoon telephoned
the Senate, asking that Charles Page
Bryan's nomination for the Chinese
mission be not taken up for considera
tion for several days. No explanation
is given for this request, but it is in line
with developments at the White House
for a week. President McKinley has
made several efforts to transfer a more
experienced Minister to China and to
find a safer berth for Bryan, and it is
said he still hopes to be able to do this.
He began with Minister Newell at
The Hague, but he did not desire to
make the change. He also considered
Minister Conger, now in Brazil, but he
found that not practicable. Last week
there was strong pressure made for the
transfer of Minister Rockhill from
Greece, and it it is reported on high
authority that the President is serious
ly considering this transfer. It would
be acceptable to both Rockhill and
Bryan, for while Rockhill sought the
mission to China, Bryan wanted to go
to Greece, if he could not get the
Netherlands.
Rockhill has qualifications for the
Chinese mission possessed by few
Americans. He spent some years in
Peking as first secretary of legation,
and spoke the Chinese language. He
also spent some time in traveling in the
East studying Oriental questions and
people and has written much on these
subjects. His experience in the State
Department is considered a great ad
vantage and he has the confidence of
Secretary Sherman.

Loudly Hissed.
Ppwlal Dispatch to The Call.
COLUMBUS. Ohio. Jan. 10.â Re
publican maâ -meeting at the Audito
rium in this city this afternoon -was
the largest assemblage ever known in
the history of the city. The capacity
of the Auditorium is COOO. All the
standing room -was taken and many
thousands were unable to gain admit
tance. The meeting lasted from 3 to
6 p. m., with unbroken enthusiasm
and intense indignation throughout its
proceedings. There were repeated
scenes of hinging when the names of
Governor Bushnell. Mr. Kurtz and
others were mentioned. The terms
"traitors," "Judas" and the like were
frequently used in response from the
audience. Several of the speakers re
ferred to Senator Foraker in connection
with the opposition to Hanna. The
audience was in deep sympathy with
the intense and bitter utterances of
most of the speakers. The Columbus
Glee Club, which refused to partici
pate in the Inaugural ceremonies, con
tributed largely to the enthusiasm of
the occasion by its singing. As Chair
man Nash and Congressman Weaver
came upon the platform the Tippe
canoe Club of Cleveland and the Busi
ness Men's League of that city enter
ed the hall and there was a wild scene
for some minutes.
As Kfion as order cmild be restored
Judge Nash addressed the audience as
follows:
Republicans of Ohio: For the first time
in the history of the Republican party in
this State, you have bren called by your
executive committee to meet In mass con
vention. This extraordinary action on the
part of the committee can Â«>uly be justi
iii-d by the existence of grave dancer.
Such peril not only to you, but t-vt-n to
popular government by the people, your
committee conceived, was lurking in the
legislative halls in Columbus. As your
sentinels placed on duty by you. we de
termined to lay the situation before you
and ask you to take such action as you
might deem wise.
Last spring and summer the Republi
can county and district conventions of
Ohio instructed their nominees for Repre
sentatives and Senators, if elected, to cast
their votes in the election for United
States Senator for the superb leader and
general wllo planned and organized vic
tory for the Republicans of Ohio and the
nation in the vital campaign of lS9ti. Mar
cus A. Hanna. This was the exercise of
a right and a privilege guaranteed to the
people by our constitution, which, says,
â¢'the people have a right to assemble to
gether in a peaceable manner to con
sult for their common good and to in
struct their representatives." In June the.
Republican party, by its duly authorized
agents, assembled in state convention at
Toledo, and made a covenant with the
people that, if successful, the Republicans
would return Mr. Hanna to the Senate.
In the campaign which followed, at every
meeting held, every speaker from Gov
ernor Hushnell down to the humble
speaker in the log sehoolhouse pledged
himself that this covenant of the party
should be kept. On this issue, among
others, the campaign was conducted, and
the people returned an ample majority of
Republicans to the General Assembly.
All during the campaign certain men,
claiming to be Republicans, fought our
candidates for the Legislature from un
der cover and from the bushes. They did
not make an open, manly tight in the
light of day and where the people could
see what they were about. This charge
is amply proved from th<* election re
turns* on file in the office of the Secretary
of State. However much we must de
spise the methods of these men and d^nb-t
their party loyalty and republican prin
ciples, we must concede that as Amer
ican citizens they had a right to vote
against our legislative candidates. Here
the contest should have ended. But it
did not. The last returns from the elec
tion had not been received when these
men disclosed the existence of a conspir
acy with our open and avowed enemies
to bring shame upon the Republican
party and to lead her trusted and hon
ored representatives into paths of dis
honor. Behing barred and locked doors,
through which no sound could escape to
alarm the honest people they sought to
have our great party, which through all
her glorious history never did a dishon
orable thing, break her faith, pledged to
the people of Ohio. With the whimpering
and insinuating wiles of dishonest poli
ticians they tempted your representa
tives to disobey your instructions and
disregard the will of the peooie.
On Monday last they captured the out
Â§osts of our citadel in organizing the
enate and House of Representatives of
Ohio. Then the extent and strength of
the conspiracy first dawned upon the
people of Ohio. Then the question was
tiot whether Mnrk A. Hanna should con
tinue to be a I'nited States Senator. It
was "shall the honor and integrity of the
Republican party be preserved unsul
lied?" It was "shall the will of the peo
ple be done?" In thiff emergency we ap
pealed to you. A storm <>f indignation
hag ewept over our great State and has
culminated in this meeting to-day. Re
publicans of Ohio, you know n^w the
situation. It is now for you to deal with
it as your consciences may dictate.
Congressman Walter L.. Weaver of
BprtftgAeML the home of Governor
Hushnell, was then introduced as
chairman of the meeting. He made a
most vigorous spewh against those
whom he accused with schemes for the
disruption of the party. The hissing
of the name of Governor Bushnell. Mr.
Kurtz and others, that began during
the address of Judge Nash, reached a
much higher pitch during the address
of Congressman Weaver. At the con
clusion of Mr. Weaver's address Con
gressmen Grosvenor, North way. Kur
ton and Southard and Judge Ooble of
Cincinnati were appointed a commit
tee on resolutions.
While the committee was out Colonel
R. Nevin of Dayton spoke. Colonel
Nevin has always been the close per
sonal and political friend of Senator
Foraker, Mr. Kurtz and others who
are at this time opposing the election
of Senator Hanna. His speech against
the action of those whom he charged
with demoralizing and debauching the
party caused the greatest demonstra
tion of the afternoon. Almost the en
tire audience rose to their feet, and
while standing on chairs threw their
hats, handkerchiefs and other articles
wildly about the hall. At the conclu
sion of this remarkable address the
resolutions were read by John K. Mal
loy. who had been defeated by the
bolters for Clerk of the House. The
resolutions were unanimously adopted,
as follows, by a rising vote and the
most enthusiastic demonstrations of
approval:
This mass meeting of Ohio Republicans
sends greetings to the people of the State
of Ohio and declares that notwithstand
ing the verdict of the people of this State
In favor of the Republican party and its
candidates expressed in the November
election, after a lair, full and compre
hensive discussion of all the Issues in
volved, has now discovered that a con
spiracy, organised and promoted outside
of the members of the General Assembly,
has been formed to thwart that expressed
will. Designing men in the State of Ohio
are making- strenuous efforts, which we
do not care to specially characterise, to
the accomplishment â¢** the various pur
poses of this nefarious scheme.
The conspiracy contemplates and has
for its ultimate purpose the transfer to
tin- Democratic party without limitation
th<- control of the organization of the
Senate, and to take from the regularly
constituted majority of the House the
control of its organization and to confer
upon the Democratic party power to limit
and circumvent Republican legislation
and thereby make possible such legisla
tion as is desired by the parties to the
combination. It contemplates the defeat
of Hon. Marcus A. Hanna, th* regularly
nominated candidate of the Republican
party of the State for Senator of the
United States, and it contemplates the
sending to that body of either a free
silver Republican, pleased to stand by the
interests and principles of the men who
elect him, or the election of a. Democrat
or both.
The scheme further comprehends and
proposes a reapporttonment of the State
for Congressional purposes to the end
that an additional number of Democrats
be elected to the Fifty-sixth Congress,
and in that way defeat the purposes of
the Republican "party, which carried the
country in UM in favor of William M< -
ECinley for President and the sound money
and protective tariff views of the great
party to which we belong.
Further than this, vla scheme con
templates the ripping up of the judicial
districts of the State to the end that
faithful judicial ottlcers may be turned
out and their places 'given to Democrats,
and bills are now prepared for both the
foregoing purposes. And still further,
we believe and charge that there is in
contemplation such a transfer of power
through legislation to * rtain men con
nected with this conspiracy as that evil
consequences will accrue to the, people
of the State.
â¢Unconscious, as we would fain believe of
the scope and far-reaching consequences
of their acts, certain members of the
Legislature elected by Republicans and
by Republican votes and pledged to Re
publican Interests, have been so far mis
led as to Join in making possible the suc
cess of this conspiracy so far.
Now, for the purpose of arresting the
further progress of this baneful con
spiracy and to prevent its complete and
almost important accomplishment, we ap
peal to every Republican member of the
General Assembly, to every Republican
of the State of Ohio and to every person
interested in the fair name of the State
of Ohio to use their influence that further
progress ma) be now checked and
thwarted. - â¢
We recognize that there Is a distinction
between a number of the Legislature
voting against his party nominee on the
organization of that body and voting
against his party's candidate for United
Slates Senator, which whs made by the
people in their primary capacity and rati
fied by them at the polls. The one, a
violation of party duty, the other involves
a breach of the highest trust and a viola
tion of the principles of our Government,
such us has never in the history of the
Republican party occurred. There have
been bolts from Senatorial nominees made
at caucuses, but since the nomination of
Abraham Lincoln against Stephen A.
Douglas, more than torty years ago, by
the people of Illinois, in State convention,
to that of Marcus B. Hanna, by the
Republicans of Ohio, in State conven
tion in 1897, there has absolutely not been
one member of. the Legislature, be it said
to the glory of our common country, who
has*- refused to ratify a nomination so
made by the people, i
The member of the Ohio Legislature,
elected as a Republican, who this week
first casts his vote against Mr. Hanna (if
there he one) will have the distinction of
making the first example of such perfidy
in his party's, and, We believe, his coun
try's history.
As the infamy of such a breach of trust,
should It occur,' would thus first stain the
fair name of our beloved State, we feel
Justified in appealing to all the people and
to all in public authority, without regard
to past or present party affiliations or
sympathies, to stay this present blow. It
would be the severest ever administered
in civil affairs against our governmental
system; it would consist of a plain viola
tion of the spirit if not the letter of the
Ohio constitution, which members of the
General Assembly and State officials have
taken a solemn oath to support.
We must reject the reports that any
supposed " or actual personal grievances
or other consideration will swerve him
from this manifest path of duty. There
fore, :â '. J .
Resolved, first, that we condemn, with
out reserve or qualification, this most
unholy conspiracy and protest in the
name of the people of the State of Ohio
against its further progress and further
rocceâ â 
Resolved, further, that we call upon
â¢ very Republican member of the Gen
eral Assembly to ho present in his scat
on next Tuesday by voice, act^and vote
to carry into execution the fulfillment of
the obligation Assumed by him when
elected as such member; and.
Resolved . finally, that we will welcome
most cordially to full co-operation the
Republican members of said General As
sembly, however they may have voted or
acted thus far in relation to the subject
matter of this declaration.
Congressman Burton of Cleveland
made one of the most vigorous
speeches of the afternoon and present
ed a mammoth petition with over 10,000
signatures from the home of Hanna In
favor of his election. Among the other
speakers were \V. W. Peabody of Cin
cinnati, D. K. Watson, S. H. Southard.
J. Warren Keifer, R. W. Taylor. W.
S. KÂ»Â»rr and \V. R. Warn**ck. Hon.
James Hoyt of Cleveland, ex-CJovernor
Foster of Fostoria and HÂ«.n. Emmett
Tompkins of Columbus made most vig
orous speeches, after which the meet
ing closed with three cheers for the
Republican party, followed by three
cheers for Hanna. After the meeting
Senator Hanna was serenaded at the
Neil House and responded in several
speeches. Senator Hanna did not at
tend the mass convention nor the in
augural exercises earlier in the day.
He was busily engaged in conference
with his coworkers, and the frequent
calls for him by the visiting delegates
were evidently an interuption to much
more Important matters at this time.

A VERY BRIEF ADDRESS.
In It No Direct Allusion Is Madeto the

Progress.
Sperlal Dispatch to The Ca'.l.
COLUMBUS, Jan. 10.â The Legisla
ture reconvened this morning and the
Inauguration of Governor Bushnell
occurred at noon.
This has been the most exciting in
auguration day over known in Colum
i bus. Long before noon thÂ» streets were
> thronged with excursionists from the
| country. They poured in from every
i direction. At noon the railways
' mated that there had been llj,OtO ar
rivals during the night and day. Kush
nell badges wen in the majority, as the
Hanna excursionists were not booked
to arrive until afternoon, in time for
I the procession. During the forenoon
the State House was surrounded by
J crowds yelling for Tiushnell. It was
Impossible for the crowds to get inside
the Capitol building, and the Governor
was called outside on the grounds,
where he addressed the multitude, one
delegation after another.
The first delegation to which the Gov
ernor responded was from his home at
Springileld, and included hundreds of
workingmen from Bushnells shops,
bearing written greetings of confidence
in him. These demonstrations contin
ued until noon, when Governor Hush
nell was escorted to the rotunda of the
State House, where the decorations of
Moral designs and bunting were more
elaborate than ever before. The mem
bers of the Supreme Court and all
other State officers had reserved se"ats
and the crowds occupied all the space
In windows, galleries and everywhere,
while the street and State House
grounds were crowded with shuulers.
A very small percentage could gain
admission to the house, but when
cheers were heard Inside the echo was
taken up on the outside, and the air
was tilled with loud responses.
The Neil House is directly across
HiKh street from the State House and
Senator Hanna witnessed the forenoon
scenes in the Capitol grounds from his
rooms, but these demonstrations did
not interfere with the Senatorial skir
mishing.
During the forenoon there were no
cases of violence reported, although the
noise was loud and continuous.
The exercises in the rotunda were ac
cording to the usual programme. The
oath of otiice was administered by Chief
Justice Burkett, who was re-elected on
the. ticket last November with Gov
ernor Bushiu'll. The Governor was
given the usual ovations when he first
appeared on the platform and again
when he appeared to deliver his inaug
ural address.
The inaugural contained no reference
to the contest of the Senatorship, un
less the following can be so construed:
"fey so legislating and acting for the
people, to secure the best results with
the least possible friction, much can be
done to make the general respect for
government higher and more enduring.
It is certain that our aim must be so to
regulate and conduct the matters com
mitted to our charge as to earn this
tacit commendation from the citizen
ship of all degrees. An appreciation of
the gravity of the task, of the difficul
ties to he encountered and the neces
sity for sincere and honest service, will
do much in the aid of those who desire
it to deserve the good will of their
fellow men for faithful stewardship
rendered."
As Governor Bushnell was inaugu
rated to-day for his second term, and
had a week ago sent an elaborate
message to the Legislature, his address
to-day was unusually brief. He was
most loudly cheered at the close, and
the ovation continued as long as he was
in sight. All who could get into the
push followed him to the executive
chamber to congratulate him.
Arrangements were made at once for
the Governor's staff to proceed to the
grand stand on the north side of the
State House to view the parade.
The public reception given by Gov
ernor Bushnell to-night was a quiet
affair. A platform, handsomely deco
rated, had been placed in the rotunda
of tho Capitol, and here the Governor,
assisted by Mrs. Bushnell and sur
rounded by the members of his staff,
received first the reception committee,
the members of the Legislature, State
officials and their ladies: then the
public was admitted, and about 2000
people passed through and were greeted
by the Governor and his wife. There
were no incidents to mar the pleasure
of the evening.
TooK Poison While Demented.
Mrs. Mary Duffy, a widow 24 years old,
living with her mother at 321Â»-i Broadway,
committed suicide last evening 1 by tak
ing 1 a dose of carbolic acid. Her brother,
Joseph Brown, found her unconscious in
her room and had her taken to the Har
bor Receiving Hospital where she died.
Mr. Brown says that his sister was out
of her head when she took the poison.

and Administered in Cowardice.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office. Risers House,
Washington, Jan. 10.
The opponents of the civil service
law had much the best of the debate
in the House to-day so far as the
number of those engaged in it were
concerned. Nine of the eleven speak
ers were of the opposition. The
friends of the law are very anxious to
shut off further debate, and in this
will have the co-operation of Speaker
Reed and the Rules Committee. Mr.
Moody, who has charge of the bill,
gave notice that he would test the
sense of the House to-morrow on a
motion to close debate. The opposi
tion immediately sent word to all in
their ranks to be on hand, and they
say they will have no difficulty in de
feating the motion.
The attendance in the House was
light to-day, but the galleries were
well filled. The civil service debate
was resumed, and C'ooney (D.) of Mis
souri took the floor. He opposed the
whole civil service reform idea, which
he denounced as a choat and a nar
row swindle. A civil pension list and
office holding class, he argued, were
logical and inevitable if it was to be
continued.
DOR <R.) of West Virginia followed
with a set speech in opposition to the
law.
Cox (D.) of Tennessee said he was so
utterly opposed to civil service reform
that he would vote to strike out the
appropriation for the committee and
for the repeal of the law.
Little (D.) of Arkansas antagonized
the principle, theory and practice of
the law.
Brumm (R.) of Pennsylvania also op
posed the "reform system." He doubt
ed, he said, whether the President of
the United States, members of the Su
preme Court, Senate or House ccmld
pass some of the civil service exami
nations. He defended what was known
as the "political pull," which he said
ought to be cultivated. Kvery young
man should have such influence, and
if he did not have it, it was the best
evidence that he was unworthy of
political privileges. He was ready to
vote for the repeal cf the law.
McCall (Ft.) of Massachusetts was the
first speaker to-day to defend the mer
it system. In reply to the criticisms of
some of the opponents of the system,
he raised a laugh at the expense of
Grosvenor, who. according to his
(McChll's) calculations, wanted over 115
per cent of the offices exempted from
thf operation of the civil service law
Cowherd (D.) of Missouri called at
tention to some alleged violations of
the civil service law in his district. He
said that it is inconsistent for the Pres

" It's no use; I've tried dozens of places and it's simply impossible

Good cigars, you mean. If you'd invest your nickel in Piper

your teeth." ;; . Â "
Judges of good tobacco everywhere are unanimous in
their praise of

â  l It is not only the best chewing tobacco on the market,
but since the recent increase in size (making the new plug

ident to play to- the grand stand with
support of the law while his subordi
nates were entertaining the bleachers
by "turning the rascals out."
"Sulloway (R.) of New Hampshire
proudly proclaimed himself a spoilsman
without any mental reservation. The
civil service law, he said, had beon con
ceived in iniquity, born in infamy and
administered in cowardice and by
Democrats. He believed the Govern
ment belonged to its friends. Sullo
way's remarks were very picturesque,
and kept the anti-reformers in a con
tinuous roar of approval.
After some further remarks by Park
er (R.) of New Jersey, in defens.- of
the law, and Low of New York, in fa
vor of a modification of the law, the
debate closed for the day.
Moody (R.) of Massachusetts, in
charge of the bill, gave notice that to
morrow he would make a motion to
close the debate. Much opposition was
manifested, but no test was made.
At 5 o'clock the House adjourned.
WILL PLANT SUGAR BEETS
IN THE PLACE OF GRAIN.
CHICO, CaL, Jan. 10.â Report has
become current here, and it is from
good authority, that the renters of the
Walsh and Finnell ranches in Clenn
County have been instructed not to
summer-fallow any lands this cominar
year. There were no explanations
given, but those who have kepi abreast
with the times expect great realiza
tions in the near future for Butte, Oo
lusa and Glenn counties, A few weekfl
ago Eastern capitalists secured bonds
on some of the best lands of several
of the largest ranches in these counties
and intend erecting sugar factories this
coming season. This is why there will
be no grain raised on these particular
lands the coming year, but instea-l
beets will be planted and cultivated.
This will lead to the growing of thou
sands f>f acres of beets, as it has been
shown by tests that the land around
Chico is particularly adapted to beet
culture.

WILLIAM LOWELL.
THE SCANDAL
IN THE SCHOOLS
YET GROWING
Los Angeles Is Deeply
Stirred at Devel
opments.
One More Warrant Has
Been Traced toÃraly's
Bank.
This Makes Four of These Very
Peculiar Transactions
of Record.
DAVIS IN AN ODD LIGHT.
Chairman of the School Board Pay*
Interest on Money Held in
Tru^t.
Special Dispatch to the Call.
LOP ANGELES, Jan. 10.â Those
dragnet affidavits asked of the
teachers of the schools of Los Angeles
;is part of the defense of Walter L.
Webb, the School Director charged
with "holding up" teachers, are proving
a veritable mine of unexpected devel
opments, but not of th^ kind the prose
cution is looking for.
The latest result of this phase of the
h :- ;â¢â â¢â¢ n to place another promi
nent leader of the League for Better
City Government on the defensive.
This time it Is Charles Oissat Davi6,
chairman of â¢ the Board of Education,
v. h >se election was heralded as a no
table victory in behalf of the league,
and presumably in the interests of
P'mml government.
In the affidavit flleti by Carrie M.
Blanford, a primary school teacher,
that lady stated she had transacted
legal business with Charles C Davis
In 1894 and in 1897.
Investigation developed the following
facts: During the years 1892 and LBM
sums uf money were placed in the
hands of Mr. Davis by the mother of
Miss Blanford for safe keeping. In the
aggregate these moneys amounted to
.>;â "'. m place uf a simple receipt Mrs.
Blanford was given notes by Mr.
Davis.
In July of this year the daughter
made an arrangement with her moth r
by which Miss Blanford became the
possessor of these notes. This transfer
was made for the reason, as alleged,
that Miss Blanford^ by aiding in the
support of the family, had become en
titled to the moneys represented by the
notes.
Previous to these various payments
had been made on the notes by Mr.
Davis, amounts called for from time
to time by Mrs. Blanford. At the time
the notes were transferred to Miss
Blanford th<.- amount remaining due
was only $200. The notes had become
outlawed, but Mr. Davis called atten
tion t" the fact and Mut-d that he was
ready at any time t<Â» renew them.
Meanwhile he continued to pay interest
on the amount that remained, in his
custody.
Ordinarily a transaction of this kind
would nut call for any particular nu
tice, but the Leagu< for Iv-tter City
Government will probably want some
explanation from School Director Da
vis and from Miss Stanford, particu
larly in view of th-- fact that about the
time ;!;â¢â¢ notes were transferred to
Miss Blanford by h<-r mother thÂ«-
Board of Education had just made its
appointment <>f teachers for the new
Bchoul year.
Another ouestion likely to be asked
us. why. if th.- money was placed with
Mr. Davis simply for safe-keeping:, did
he pay interest on the sum intrusted
to him. <>r in otht-r words, why did he
make compensation for a favor pre
sumably conferred by him on the per
son whom he compensated?
This development also recalls with
significance the Btrong protest made
by chairman Davis at the last ;%Â«sÂ»i">n
â¢if the board against the manner in
which the defense proposed to put in
its case. The plan of Webb's counsel
was and is to make (very teacher and
employe of the School Department
state under oath whether <>r not he
had paid for a position, if any ap
proaches had heen marie to do so. and
to relate any business transactions
v. ith any School Director.
On the evening in question, lost
Wednesday, chairman Davis voiced
a protest as follows: "I want to make
one statement to the board and to the
defense. I f'-el that in justice to my
self I cannot allow thÂ» examination
as it was carried on at the last meet
ingâ the bringing out of simply nega
tive testimony â without a protest.
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JAXUART 11, 1898.
."his method of proceeding is an abso
. ite waste of limp and money. Nega
tive testimony has absolutely no i
hearing on the issues of the case. I do
this individually because the expense.
Is a large one and the inconvenience i
to the teachers here is great. I sim
ply wish, to enter this as a protest."
Added interest is given by these facts
i>< the homily delivered to-night by
Chairman Davis on the duties of those
Intrusted with the welfare of the pub-
Is â  schools. In part he said: "It is
not improper, I think, that as I ai
sumo the chair this evening I state
briefly the objects we shall endeavor to
carry out this year, in order to place
ill-* schools upon a different basis from
that occupied by them for some years,
and especially during the past year.
The puMic schools are cherished as ;
aiming the most sacred of our Institu
tions; attack them, impair their effi
ciency, use them for political ends, or
l<>t extortion or corruption worm into
them, and every mother and father of
the community is alert and resentful.
"The people have intrusted to the !
School P.oard the guard and guidance
of this branch of our (Jovernment; in
it is vested the power to make or un
make any one of the hundreds of teach
ers and employes; to add to or do away
with studies; and to control, almost
untrammeled except by public opinion,
the education which the children shall
receive. As a natural but unfortunate
result of this power, the Board of Edu- \
cation, composed almost invariably of ;
new men each term, who are often Ig
norant of the duties of the office and
as often so small as to be inflated with
pride in the power, have an influence
over the school department and over
the teachers individually, wholly un- j
warranted in reason, and which may
grow demoralizing and even dangerous
in its effects: and if. in addition to ig
norance on the part of the board, there
be added a willingness to sacrifice the
schools to political or personal ends, or
to use the insidious power over the
teachers and employes, to plunder or
coerce them, the effects may be unjust
and outrageous.
"It is my fÂ«-elinc that there should
bo a radical reform in all matters
where our experience shows there is
wrong which may be righted; and that
especially there should be a change in
the matter of employing and continuing
teachers. They should be employed
only after a careful examination :tnd
the preference, other things being
equal, should he given to those having
the most liberal education. The to.ich
er. once accepted, should be assured of
a certain permanency of tenure, de
pendent upon efficiency.
"The business side of thÂ»- department
also needs Improvement. The method
of purchasing supplies is unsatisfactory
and sometimes open to suspicion, be
cause it apparently affords easy oppor
tunity for crookedness, with difficulty
in detecting it. Other cities employ
methods that give good results and I
feel it is our duty to adopt them or
some other plans which will satisf> the
public and ourselves that th>se affairs
are managed with the same care as is
employed in any properly administered
ti list
"Our people demand these reforms:
they demand that thÂ»> schools be kept
free from the withering touch of the
politician or the self-seeker; and they
demand of us further that a detper.
broader, more patriotic spirit shall
henceforth guide and control the board
"I feel assured that a majority, if
not all. of the board will give cheerful
aid in accomplishing this work. Our
duty is plain. Let no man falter, but
let each bear his r>art in the work of
improvement which has fallen to our
lot, to the end that we may r*Â»de^m th^
school department from the shame of
the nast yf-ar, and that we may leave,
at the end of our term, a department
with work so systematized and iru.ird
ed that a repetition of that sad history
shall be impossible."
Investigation before the Board of
Education will be continued to-mor
row night.
JIM'S OFFER
TO LANKY BOB
Corbett's Final Effort to
Secure One More
Battle.
Willing to Give Thirty-Five
Thousand Dollars for
the Fight.
The Champion Is Duly Taunted, but
Refuses to Consider the
Challenge Seriously.
Special Dlfpatch to The Call.
ST. LOUIS, Jan 10â At the close of
the second act of James J. Corbett's
play, "A Naval Cadet," at Haviin's
Theater to-nipht. Corbett stepped be
fore the curtain, and announced that he
offers Fitxaimmons 135,008 for a finish
li^ht, the entire sum to *-â " to Fltzsim
mona if <"orbett fails t" put him out in
ten rounds. Corbett Intended to issue
this challenge on January 17. but de
cided to make it public ti'-niyht. The
challenge reads ;Â» s follows:
Kobert Fltzsimni"iis: Neither of us is
qualified for oratory, and the public is
nut entertained over your wrangling over
what :s palpably an bonesi proposition,
more to your advantage than mine. As
a. last Inducement to overcome your ob
vious reluctance t" meet me again, I will
make that prop till more 1 Lvora
ble, thus: Your j â  1 â¢ - l i i -^ from your four
greatest battles wer< : Battle with Demp
sey, $12,000; battle, with Matter, $10,000;
battle with Hall, $5000 (the offered purse
was $40,000. but tin club failed); battle
with Creedon, i- , n aking a total of
$32,000.
You made nothing oui "f your fight with
me, for, having ii<> hop< of winning, you
sold your chance for the purse for 15 "per
cent." of th.- profits on the vettocope.
Therefore, $32,000 represents your reward
In gross for the five greatest contests of
your life. Now list* n t>> what I otr.-r:
A purse of t-',. 1 '" 1 stands ready to Â»â¢â¢â¢
offered as a prize foi a meeting ta tru
ring with you. To this 1 will add $10,000
of my own, conditionally that you agree
to box me t<> a finish. This makes $35,000.
I offer you this entire sum if I fail to stop
you in ten rounds; with two provisions
viz.:
Firstâ That the contest must continue
to a finish: and
Becondâ That I shrill havo something: to
say in regard to the appointment "f â 
referee who will not l>e unfairly preju
diced in your favor.
This Is my final proposition. Take it
or leave it. If YOU r.-ally want li^ht â it
offers it. if you want moneyâ a sum is
ready, exceeding your Kmss receipts in
live great battles. If rou want reputa
tion, you can make II better by meeting
me than by meeting all others together
if you <loubt this, ask the public each
nlpht when you exhibit. That is my ul
timatum. I am tired of this chatter, l
want work, not ttiik Paper gabblings do
not suit me. and abuse is a coward's
weapon.
If this, my lost offer, will not make you
m<-et me like ;i man. it is because your
Carson bruises are still aching so pain
fully that $35,000 cannot tempt you to en
dure their certain r< â¢ wal. This Is the
only excuse you i in offer or that the
public will accept. The tree or' success
is too hard to iliinb. i admit. It may !â¢â¢â 
that V"U are satisfied with the small fruit
ripening '>n the lower limbs. The great
prize can only b<- v by reaching to
where my name Was, is. and shall he.
But whether you w , venture or not,
this, my last challenge to youâ and to
bind which I shall post JiO.OOu forfeit the

DISCOVERS A
NEW METAL
Wizard Edison May Rev
olutionize the Iron
Business.
This Latest Achievement, How
ever, Is Purely the Result
of an Accident.
Pigiron Made Malleable by a Process
Known Only to the Great
Electrician.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 10â Thomas A.
Edison, the electrical wizard, has made
a discovery which gives promise of rev- i
olutionizing the iron business of the
world. It is nothing less than a new i
metal which admixed with iron renders
cast iron as tough and strong as i
wrought iron. The discovery was made j
purely by accident. Edison has been j
at work for years at the mines in Edi- !
son, N. J., in bringing his great mag- j
netic ere separating process into prac
tical commercial shape. He has prac
tically solved the problem and got
the plant into full operation. During |
the last few months he has run through \
the mills experimental test lots of from :
BOM to lO.uOO tons each. Most of the !
products of the mills have been mar- j
keted at the great blast furnaces at !
Catasanqua, I'a. The last lot, shipped j
to Catasauqua about a month ago, de- j
veloped curious characteristics. It is
well known that after pig iron is run ;
out of the blast furnace it is broken up ;
by sledge hammers into pieces for ship- !
ment and for handling, but this lot !
proved refractory. After the pigs had i
been broken off from the "sow," as the
main line leading to the pig molds is
called, the pigs were covered with sand j
and allowed to cool as usual. Upon be-
Ing thoroughly cooled and taken out j
into the yard, workmen were set to
work to break the pigs up into conven
ient sizes. To their surprise the pigs !
would not break. Fifteen-pound sledge j
hammers were used with all the force
the sturdy men could employ, and re
peated blows failed to break the pigs.
Twenty-five-pound sledge hammers
were then used with the same result.
Edison was at once notified of the re
markable discovery. Sections of the re
fractory pigs were submitted by him to
half a dozen eminent chemists, whom I
he keeps constantly. Edison formed the
theory that there was some hitherto
unknown substance in the iron which j
caused the difference in the output. He j
suspected that it was a new metal. Re- j
ports of the analyses by chemists have
| been made and all coincide with the
wizard's theory. Edison declines to say !
! whether it is an entirely new metal or
j one whose existence was hitherto
known. He is having a new analysis :
made on a larger scale, and will not as- |
, same more than he is prepared to sub
stantiate.

Patrick Savage Gets a

Judge Smith Attributes His
Crime to the Drinking
of Whisky.
Dramatic Scene Between Mothar and
Son in the Los Angelas
Courtroom.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 10.â Patrick
Savage, a young man 27 years of age,
was to-day sentenced by Judge B. N.
Smith to serve twenty-five years at
San Quentin. He murdered William
Roche a few months ago at San Pe
dro. Savage had been a rather wild
young man, but he had given no evi
dence of any vicious tendencies. At
the time of the killing he was in
liquor. If he had been sober it never
would have occurred. In sentencing
him Judge Smith said:
"You have been convicted of a sud
den and almost unprovoked murder.
When you sent a young man into
eternity it was nothing but a sort of
crazy, insane idea. You called this
young boy, William Roche, to the
back porch and shot him down with
this big 45-caliber revolver. I am con
vinced that but one thing Is responsi
ble for this awful deed, and that is
whisky. The jury has been merciful
to you in declaring this to be murder
in the second degree, and the court is
disposed to be merciful also."
The Judge thereupon gave him a
quarter of a century of imprisonment
as punishment. Savage's mother and
sisters were in the courtroom, and the
scene that followed the pronounce
ment of the sentence made by Judge
Smith was most dramatic. The moth
er grasped her son and placing her
arms around his neck wept must bit
terly, at the same time crying, "Oh,
my boy, my darling boy, has it come
to this?" Other relatives who had
gathered in the courtroom began to
sob, and there was not a dry eye
among the half a hundred present.
Finally the time came for the last
parting, and the mother, bracing her
self and drying her eyes, said: "Go,
my boy, my dear boy: go, but remem
ber me and be good."

THE HATPIN'S NEW RENOWN.
THE hatpin seems to have engrafted itself upon
modern civilization by embedding itself in the
muscular tissue of the race. As a mere imple
ment devoted to the laudable purpose of keeping the
feminine hat on straight the pin could never have at
tained to renown. The best it could have hoped for
was a moderate popularity. But soon the pin was
found to be available in many directions. It would,
when intelligently guided, pick a lock, open an ink
bottle, furtively spear a pickle. In fact there would
be difficulty in naming all the things it was able to
do. Then all at once the sphere of the hatpin
widened. If a man in a public place crowded more
than the exigencies of the jam seemed to warrant a
sharp prod awakened him to a sense of error and
suggested sudden reform. The pin became a weapon
of defense. Far be it from us to say that it ever was
a weapon of offense. Let the men who have been
punctured by it examine their own consciences and
make plaint if they can.
But just now the hatpin is at the zenith of its
fame. It has vanquished a robber. He had invaded,
with evil intent, backed by a gun, a Chicago street
car, and he fled thence with a tiny drop of blood
narking the place where the hatpin had pointed out
to him his mistake. There was a woman in the car
when he entered, and she drew her hatpin so hastily
and employed it so well that all he could do was to
say "ouch" and go away from there. What recks it
if the woman's hat sagged sideways the while?
What if it even fell off? This was no ordinary occa
sion. The hatpin forever!
THE LOS ANGELES SCHOOL SCANDAL.
BIASED to the verge of vicious partisanship
must have been the Los Angeles Herald when
in a recent editorial it said: "The articles in
the San Francisco Call of last Tuesday relating to
the School Board scandal in this city formed one of
the most contemptible pieces of work of which an
alleged great newspaper was ever guilty. The Call
apparently placed its columns at the command of
Webb in order that the latter might distort the facts
and confuse the minds of the paper's readers with
respect to his own questionable actions."
To refute that wanton misrepresentation there is
needed only a plain statement of the facts. When the
first disclosures in the Los Angeles school scandal
â¢were made The Call recognized the importance of the
issue to the people of that section ar:<i indirectly to
the State at large. It thereupon set about making a
full and fair investigation of the charges and counter
charges on both sides. Its representatives and special
correspondents gave much time and careful study to
the proceedings as they developed from day to day,
and The Call itself gave much space to their reports.
The first notable feature of the case was the
testimony given by Axtell and Adams, which
incriminated Webb. Full reports of the evi
dence of these men were published in The Call, and
then Webb asked for a hearing. The charges
of the accusers having been made public, it
was only fair to give the accused a chance to be
heard before the same popular tribunal. To have re
fused his request would have been * denial of fair
play repugnant to every sentiment of justice and
false to the settled policy of The Call of acting in all
affairs of this kind with judicial impartiality.
Mr. Webb, having been accused of gross offenses
in office, had a right to be heard. We pub
lished his statement as an essential part of the pro
ceedings in the investigation of the truth. He
claimed that he did not have a fair hearing at home,
and the violence with which the Herald attacks The
Call for permitting him to be heard at all goes far to
justify the claim. That fact was an additional reason,
if any had been needed, why The Call should permit
him to make the best defense he could against his
accusers. When a charge is well founded justice suf
fers nothing by that liberty which gives the acciised
a chance to defend himself.
The Call is eager and earnest in the performance
of the duty of exposing every corrupt practice that
exists in official life. It desires to maintain, as far
as possible, the highest standards of honor in the ad
ministration of all public trusts, and to that end gives
prompt and powerful assistance to every movement
designed to expose rascality and turn the rascals out.
It does not intend, however, to act from biased mo
tives, prejudice or passion. Nor will it condemn any
man unheard. It seeks the truth and in all cases acts
fairly, impartially and justly by giving a hearing to
both sides. To do otherwise would be to
perform what the Herald calls "one of the most
contemptible pieces of work of which an alleged
great newspaper was ever guilty."

UNSAFE LEADERSHIP.
"" | 'HE policy of following the lead of Senator
Morgan in annexation or any other serious
matter has doubts cast upon it by the conse
quences which are upon the country through listen
ing to him in the past.
The United States had claimed exclusive owner
ship of Bering Sea and all that swam therein. To
make this claim good we had forbidden other na
tions to take seals in those waters, and when ships
went sealing there under the British flag wo
captured and sold them as prizes. Eng
land disputed our claim of a closed sea
and denied our right to make prizes of the property
of her subjects. Finally the dispute was left to ar
bitration and the nations were asked to sit in judg
ment upon our claim and its denial by Great Britain.
Senator Morgan was appointed one of the American
counsel. The tribunal met in Paris and after patient
and learned investigation found against us on the
claim of a closed sea and found us indebted to Great
Britain in a sum equal to the value of the ships taken
under her flag as prizes. We had agreed before the
arbitration to abide by the verdict. Our Secretary
of State, Gresham, and the British Minister at Wash
ington, after investigating the subject, agreed that
under the verdict of Paris we owed Great Britain
$4.2.4,000 for her ships taken as prizes. The Presi
dent sent to Congress a message apprising it of the
verdict and asking an appropriation to pay it. Then
was presented an opportunity for statesmanship of
the Morgan type. The Alabama Senator was chair
man of the Committee on Foreign Affairs: he had
been of American counsel at the Paris arbitration,
lie spoke by authority, and so speaking proceeded to
declare that in asking an appropriation to pay this
award the President was picking the pockets of the
American people to curry favor with Great Britain.
He declared that we did not owe England a cent for
these prizes and uttered much more bar room dip
lomacy. The appropriation was refused, and at Sen
ator Morgan's instigation a supplementary court was
created, subordinate to the Paris tribunal, to traverse
the subject again, take testimony and reach a verdict
as to whether anything was due Great Britain and
how much.
This court has just finished the labor, which occu
pied it nearly two years and involved sessions at Vic
toria, San Francisco and elsewhere, where numbers
of witnesses were to be had, and has reached a unani
mous verdict that we owed Great Britain $424,000, as
found by Gresham and Paunccfote, and that sum
with interest swelling it to $464,000 must be paid by
v?. together with the costs of this supplementary
court, the whole sum being $600,000. It has, there
fore, cost American taxpayers $176,000 to follow the
advice of Senator Morgan.
That is not the total cost. At the close of our
Civil War we claimed damages of Great Britain for
destruction of our merchant marine by Confederate
privateers built, launched and armed on the Clyde.
She denied responsibility and we asked the nations to
sit in judgment between us. That high court met in
Geneva and found a verdict for us and against Great
Britain in the sum of $13,000,000. Britain without a
moment's delay or word of complaint paid that
enormous fine into our treasury.
Is Senator Morgan capable of appreciating the
contempt and dishonor into which he brought this
country by inducing Congress to refuse to stand by
the Paris arbitration when the sum at stake was so
pitifully small in comparison to that which England
paid to us?
Do his admirers appreciate the loss of standing
and of character among the nations which we have
suffered by his leadership?
After this disgraceful incident should any one fol
low him into further smirch of the country's honor
by annexation of Hawaii against the protest of its
people ?
THE FIGHT FOR THE RIVERS.
| \ROSPECTS for the improvement of the river
y~-S system of California weir never brighter than
at this time. In both the Sacramento and the
San Joaquin valley the revived hopes of the people
have stimulated their energies and they are working
with vigor for the accomplishment of the enterprise.
The outlook is certainly promising. The State
officials are showing commendable activity. The
Attorney-General has approved the contracts let by
the State Commission for deepening Newtown
shoals, and that work will begin as ?non as a favor
able decision on it is received from the War Depart
ment.
The United States engineers recognize the impor
tance of the improvements and are co-operating in
the effort to obtain them. They have this year re
commended an appropriation by Congress of $280,000
for the purpose of deepening the Sacramento from
Newtown shoals to Sacramento, and as this is the
largest sum ever recommended for that section it is
an unmistakable evidence of the growing interest
taken in the work by the national officials.
Nor is it among officials only that we find evi
dences of an increasing purpose to bring about the
much desired results. The people are aroused and
are ready to do their share in completing the task
of saving the valley lands from the recurring floods.
According .o the Sacramento Bee the farmers of
Yolo are freely signing an agreement to buikl up and
connect the levee system to either side of a long and
substantial overflow weir. The effect of this will be
that no water will flow into Yolo County until the
high water mark is touched by the flood at the
city of Sacramento.
Each of these things will count as a factor in sup
port of the bill introduced by Congressman De Vries
appropriating $500,000 for river improvement, and if
all the forces now in movement can be brought to
work in concord we may reasonably expect the pas
sage of the measure.
Patent inside papers are yet passing about to an
admiring constituency accounts of the beautiful
presents Pugilist Fitzsimmons made to his wife
Christmas. These are diamonds and otTier costly ar
ticles such as the wife of the average man sees only
in a show window. And now comes an Australian
paper relating with frankness little less than brutai
how the parents of this liberal person have had to go
to the poorhouse. There is no doubt that Fitzsim
mons is a hard man to whip, but if the paper quoted
is not in error there is no doubt that he needs whip
ping as badly as any one who could be mentioned.
An evening paper known as the Bulletin has
the bad taste to speak of itself as a "rival journal."
Rival to what? The thing excites moderate
curiosity.
Though the actions of Rev. Edwards Davis at San

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JAM'AKY 11, IS9B.
A CHICKEN-HEARTED BOODLER.
THE prospect that one of its editors will soon
be compelled to appear at the bar of the Su
perior Court to answer a charge of criminal
libel seems to have completely unnerved the Mission
street Boodler. For several days the Boodler has
been writing up Judge Campbell's court in a vi
vacious way, printing at the same time extensive ac
counts of that jurist's jokes â the evident intention
having been to reach his heart by flattering him. The
Judge, however, has proved impervious to such
blandishments. On Saturday he expounded the law
of criminal libel contrary to the Boodler's expecta
tions.
The change in the attitude of the sheet was im
mediate. Not only does it now link the law of libel
with Judge Campbell's character and denounce both
as the aversion of all valiant champions of "the peo
ple." but "it does not fear the result." It is quite
plain, however, that the Boodler does fear the result.
Its talk is the merest bravado. The heart of the
Boodler is in its throat. It thinks that at last a
method has been discovered for making somebody
responsible for its libels and slanders which, when
made public, is certain to put an end to its irrespon
sible career.
As we understand the proceeding before Judge
Campbell, the Boodler sought to engraft the law of
agency upon the law of libel. It attempted to estab
lish the principle that the editor of a newspaper is
not criminally responsible for what appears in its
columns â in other words, that the proprietor's
agents, having no special authority to libel people,
are on the same footing as agents acting without the
scope of their authority. To acknowledge this doc
trine would compel persons libeled by the Boodler
to look to its proprietor, who resides in New York,
and who is therefore beyond the reach of the courts
ot this State. Under our laws execution in civil ac
tions cannot is^ue against a defendant who has not
been pecsonally served with summons, and as
the owner of the Boodler cannot be personally served
so long as he lives in New York, to grant its theory
of the law is equivalent to granting it immunity from
the laws of libel altogether.
We are glad that Judge Campbell has taken the
correct view of the law. A weaker man might have
yielded to the blandishments of the Boodler, which
is a fawner as well as libeler. There need be no fear
of the "liberty of the press" being interfered with.
The constitution guarantees every man the right to
speak and print his sentiments, so long as he exer
cises the privilege with a due regard for the right of
every man to have only the truth spoken and printed
about him. The Boodler's privilege of levying trib
ute upon corporations may, it is true, be curtailed,
but it cannot be said that this is one of the indus
tries of California which should be protected by law.
Holding up railroads for "advertising" contracts may
be a profitable business for the Boodler. and libel and
slander may be necessary instruments in prosecuting
it. but if the Boodler engages in that species of high
waymanry it must be prepared to take the conse
quences.
The Boodler ought not to be afraid of a jail. Nor
should it be guilty of perpetuating the chicken
hearted farce of telling its readers that putting it in
jail is a "serious matter." There i* nothing serious
about putting the Boodler's crew in jail. A jail is the
proper place for all journalists who commit unjusti
fiable libel.
SOMETHING GREAT FOR CALIFORNIA.
IZI^OR the whole United States this is a year of
j unusual opportunities. A thousand evi
dences of the coming of an unsurpassed pros
perity are to be seen on every side. All over the
Union men of enterprise and business sagacity are
preparing to make full use of the industrial revival.
Affairs more or less great are to be undertaken in
every State. The competition will be keen and
those who are ambitious to win the richest reward
for themselves and tluir communities must be
prompt, vigilant and energetic.
The prospects for California are brighter than
those of any of her titter States. In the wide
sweep of the republic there is no commonwealth
whose opportunities in this year of promise are so
golden as ours. We have every advantage of re
viving industry and increasing trade that other
American communities possess, and in addition
thereto we have the promise of the marvelous traf
fic that is to grow up on this coast out of the com
ing development of the gold fields of Alaska.
Men of light and leading among us have already
set about devising means to seize these opportuni
ties as they arise and profit by every benefit they
afford. Steps have been taken to draw the Alaskan
trade to this city and to hold it. The Golden Jubi
lee will be an enticement to tourists and the min
ing exposition will attract miners of all classes from
those who labor with pick and shovel among the
placers to those who have millions to invest in gold
bearing quartz.
The plans devised for the Jubilee and the expo
sition are of such excellence as to merit the sup
port of all Californians who have the ability and the
public spirit to support anything. The whole com
munity should join in the two movements with the
ardor of a genuine civic patriotism. There should
be no lack of active co-operating work, no lack of
liberal contributions.
This is the time to do something great for Cali
fornia. This is the time to show to the world the
bountiful profusion of her resources, the rich pro
docts of her labor and the industrial skill and energy
of her people. State pride and commercial profit
are alike at stake, and the issue appeals to both the
business and the bosoms of men.
Unless the Governor of Georgia interfere a woman
will shortly be hanged in that State. There will be
a general hope that the executive will exercise his
right of commuting the sentence to imprisonment.
Women are not prone to murder. They do not com
mit one offense of this kind while men are com
mitting a hundred. They do not so notably need a
lesson nor show the lack of restraint. And in so many
respects they do not stand before the law as the equal
of men that the mind revolts against holding them
equal in the matter of punishment.
Mrs. Nack of New York has been sentenced to fif
teen years in the penitentiary. Her offense, it will be
remembered, was that of killing a man and chopping
him into bits easily portable. She certainly has no
reason to complain. Not being old, she may be re
leased while yet vigorous enough to swing an ax.
Young Mr. Fair's bar room fight in New York was
perhaps worth telegraphing across the conti
nent. In other respects it was much like any one of
a dozen "scraps" the observant citizen who stays out
late may have the joy of seeing any night oreven of
participating in it such be his humor.
DR. CHAPMAN'S CRUSADE.
BY MIRIAM MICHELSON.
The members of the Market-street Congregational Church in Oakland are pro
testing against the retirement of Dr. E. S. Chapman, -who has decided to resign his
pastorate and accept the superintendeney of the Anti-Saloon League.
Dr. Chapman is a remarkable man. He has been a lawyer, a politician, a
Mf-thodist, a Presbyterian and is now a Congregationalism He has been in charge
of various churches in Oakland, where he has lived for thirteen years. He is a
most successful minister. He lives in a very pretty, comfortable home in "West
Oakland. His children are grown. He is no longer a young man, yet he is about
to resign the ministry of a church, the people of which are united in their affection
for him, and their desire to refuse to accept his resignation.
"It is simply a question of duty," said Dr. Chapman yesterday, running his
hand through his thick white hair. "A minister is a teacher. His mission is to
educate, to elevate public sentiment. If people find fault with the laws I tell them
to raise their own standard, and the standard of the law-makers must be cor
respondingly raised. And this is work for the minister. When I get through my
work here and go before God he will ask me whac I have done against the liquor
curse of California.
"â¢Well," I can say, 'I preached against it.'
" 'But before whom? To whom?' he will ask.
"And that I may be able to answer I must leave the church with which my
relations are of the kindliest, the closest. I must leave my home and go out all
over the State and preach against intemperance."
The words were spoken in a low, quiet voice. The doctor's manner is simple
and very earnest. His broad, kindly face is animated, alert. His use of words is
free and not cast in a stereotyped mold. And there can be no question of his
sincerity.
"The Anti-Saloon Alliance is a means for the union of all people who believe in
temperance; not necessarily prohibition, and not excluding prohibitionists. Our one
endeavor will be to do away with the open saloons, of which there is one to every
ninety-nine people in California to-day; thirty-five times the number there is in
Mississippi, which mean? that California men have thirty-five times the appetite
for liquor that Mississippi men have.
"Why? Because they have thirty-five times the opportunity to gratify that
appetite. It is the supply that in time will produce the demand. I'll admit that
the thing is retroactive. But do you remember what Beecher said about books.
'I never knew how many books I wanted, how many I needed, till I entered a
bookstore.'
"People say, 'Why, you can't regulate a thing like that by law; it's a question
of morality.'
"So it is, but so is theft a question of morality, and we make laws against
it. So is the relation between husband and wife a question of morality; yet we have
laws in that connection.
"Understand, I don't hope to do away entirely with drinking. There are laws
against murder, and yet men commit murder. But I do insist that it is an outrage
that Government should legitimatize immorality.
"This is the position of the league to-day. We believe that there is a majority
of the people opposed to saloons. We believe that that majority should rule; not
that the majority should rule in all things. It would be absurd for us, supposing
we're in the majority, to compel the minority to eat a certain kind of food and
abstain from another kind. But, in a matter of this kind, where wrong is done,
where the very best and brightest of our men are enslaved by their own weak
ness, it is the duty of the Government to protect them from themselves. You'll
observe that it isn't the close-fisted, stingy, pin-headed man who needs protection.
He's too mran to be a drunkard. But it's the man you admire, the man whose
generous, warm-blooded, lovable qualities endear him to you, the man of mind
and of heartâ he's the drunkard. Now, hasn't a State the right to interfere for this
mans benefit, the very choicest, the most perfectâ were it not for this one flawâ
specimen of her sons?
"We believe that we have the right to educate public sentiment up to believing
Â«â¢ we do, to make converts if we can. And we also hold that we have the right from
time to time to vote upon this matter, and, if the majority declare against the open
fealoon, that it should be abulished.
"This district in which I live voted overwhelmingly against open saloons, yet
there are saloons in this district. They accuse us of wishing to deprive others of
the privilege of living as they choose. They deprive us of our right when they
permit a saloon in this district in opposition to the wishes of all the people who
live in it. If District A, for instance, 'Votes that there shall be saloons, it should
have the privilege of regulating that matter for itself. But so should we. To'u
fee, something has been done in the fight, when on the train going up from New
Orleans to "Washington there are notices to the effect that no liquor may be sold
in passing through North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. Every point we
win is one of the enemy's outposts taken.
"Of course, you understand that it doesn't occur to me to try or to wish to pro
hibit a man from drinking. I don't believe that there is a set of cranks in the
world to-day who dream of such a thing. If I wish to drink there is no power on
earth to prevent my doing so. But if I wish to sell liquor there is a power whoso
business it is to forbid my tempting my weaker brethren. Why. in Dayton, Ohio,
where I .lived for a time I have seen a saloon-keeper pour whisky upon the side
walk in front of his place that the hot sun might cause the fumes to evaporate and
tempt the vice-ridden men who passed. What power to resist there is in a man's
heart should be strengthened, not delivered over to the enemy. No. this is our
position. Alcohol should be as subject to laws as is poison or damaged food-stuffs,
I may buy. I may swallow poison. There is no law to punish me. But there is a
law to punish the man who sells me that poison. Why, I may supply my table
with damaged meat that will sicken my family. I could not be punished for that.
But the man who sells such meat is amenable to law

drifted off along the unexplored paths of

to slumber and oblivion. I accosted one

the Baldwin Theater, wearing In tho
bosom of her gown a large bunch of vio
: lets, tied with a purple ribbon. Seated
in the place directly opposite to her was
; a frail little fellow, who could not have
1 been over twelve years old. He was evi
dently a sufferer from some sort of
spinal trouble, as his head and the upper
portion of his body were inclosed in a
frame of steel and leather, and an armed
brace was tightly strapped to one of hi 3
legs. Poverty, too, had set Its hand on
him, as his clothes, though clean, were
old and threadbare, and there were holes
in the fingers of the cheap cotton gloves
worn by his sister, who accompanied him.
The violets worn by Miss McHenry caught
his eyes, and, turning, he whispered
something to His sister, who blushed and
told him to wait a while. He remained
quiet, but continued to gaze at the flow

eyes. Just before reaching her destina

was wsaring, she took them, ribbon and

wear them for her sake, and got off the

seemed as if the sun came into the car

cert preceding the pro} â  â¢ai '1 last- 'â¢
Ing frowi 1 o'clock until 2.
Regarding the decoration '>Â£ Wood
ward's Pavilion, Mr. Ford said the
committee had contracted with Pratt
Â£â¢ *'â >. to transform the pavilion into
a classic temple of go.d. The dingy
old pillars will be covered with whit- 1
doth and lonic capitals will bo fash
ioned upon them. The ceiiing will he
of brilliant yellow bunting-, hiding the
rafters and forming a. dome "f gold.
The stage will be beautifully decorated
â¢with flowera rind f<-rns and waving
palms, find those who take part in the
programme will all be given seats
there. The c">st <-f these decorations
will be J-'To. Mr. Ford asked that the ,
committee be allowed to go to a fur
ther expense of $100 to provide extra
decorations on the stage. The desired
permission was granted, and the com
mlttee was further authorized to ex
pond its appropriation of $ITjOO as It
Bees Ml.
Tt was decided that reserved seats
should ho set aside for the pioneers, the
number to be decided later.
A communication from John Part
rifle^ was receded, asking that the
committee ad<>f,t a Jubilee guide he
Is Issuing as an official guide. The mat
ter was referred to the chairman of the
finance committee.
Tirey L. Ford read the contract for i
the big arch which will span Market
street opposite the Parrott building,
and also the specifications under which
the structure is to be erected. The con
tract was accepted by the executive |
committee and the sub-committee in i
charge of the building of the arch was '
empowered to sign the necessary pa- ;
pers. The arch must be finished be- ;
fore January 24. and it will be allowed
to stand one week. An order allow
ing the contractors a payment of $600
00 January 22 was referred to Mr. Ford
for consideration.
Mr. Coleman, chairman of the finance
committee, reported that while the
work of gathering funds was progress
ing favorably, some of the sub-commit
tees were not doing as well as he ex
pected. He reported $io,2r,i in sight,
which amount Includes the JICOO to be
subscribed by the Supervisors.
He reiterated his statement of last
Thursday that $17,000 be the extreme
limit expended by the committee.
8 K. Thornton of the committee on
publicity and promotion reported that
posters and communications had been
distributed all over the State, and the
Btock of posters was running low. As
to paying for posters ho reported that
the committee from the California Mm
ers' Association had declared that It
would pay but one-third of the ex
penses of printing the first issue of 20.
000. He thought, however, that this
decision might be reconsidered.
.T. H. Grady of the parade commit
tee reported that the music for the pa
rade would cost at least 12600, but thai
so far little had been, done in the way
of hiring the necessary bands. He also
reported that the Board of Education
had advanced the idea of giving a
week's vacation, the time to be (duct
ed from the two weeks' .vacation to
come later in the spring. A letter will
be addressed to the board asking that
such a vacation be granted, to com
mence with the holiday week.
Regarding badges it was suggested
to provide them to each member of the
executive committee, the officers of the
celebration and to representatives of
the press. The committee on colors and
badges was placed in charge of the
matter to report at the next meeting.
It was decided to appoint a reception
committee of ten and the secretary was
ordered to report the action to the .Na
tive Daughter? and suggest that simi
lar action be taken by them. The com
mittee will be appointed within a tew
days.
Mr. Ford reported for the committee
on conference that the Native Sons
would parade in a way to represent
the various epochs of the State's his
tory, commencing with vaqueros .and
Indians and ending with a float typify
ing the present time. it was suggest
ed that th" committee's float represent
ing the missions be made a part of the
Native Sons' allegorical parade. The
matter was referred to the parade com
mittee.
The subscription collectors have in
formed the committee that they are
much annoyed on account of the con
fusion in the public mind in regard to
the connection between the money con
tributed to the jubilee fund and money
paid for advertising in the official jubi
lee souvenir. The true state of the case
is that money contributed in the latter
way does not come at all into the
hands of the Jubilee finance committee.
After the meeting of the executive
committee the parade committee
vened and decided to allow the "Mis
" floal to be paraded with the Na
tlve Sons, as had be< :i suggested.
Tii" Young Mm's Institute has no-ti
fled the jubilee committee that it will
take part in the parade, and has asked
to be assigned to a suitable place in
the line. The membership paraded will
not be large, f,,r a great many of the
members of the Young Men's Institute
are also members of the Native Sons.
and in the Jubilee they will naturally
i/iv" the Native Sons the preference.
The executive committee <if the Â» ";i li
fornia state Miners' Association met
last evening in X. S. (1. W. Hall for the
purpose of receiving reports from
standing committees and to consider
the invitation of the Golden Jubilee
pi imoters to form a miners' division
in the parade.
A resolution passed by the Commer
cial and Merchants' <iubs <>f ( imaha
was rend. It was accompanied by a re
'.u^st asking that the mineral exhibit
be removed to the exposition at Omaha
following its presentation here in the
Mechanics' Pavilion. It was decided
to deny the request.
An invitation was presented request
ing the Miners' Association to take
part in the parade on January 24, and
after considerable dismission a com
mittee, consisting of <"<iioncl Stone and
Mr. Halloran and Mr. Cow dray, was
appointed by the chair to act in the
matter and make arrangements to
have a good showing of members on
that day.
WILL HONOR THE DAY.
The Jesuits Will Commemorate the
Anniversary of a Feast With
Special Cereroony.
Preparations are being made at St.
Ignatius Church in anticipation of the
Feast of the Sacred Name of Jesus, to I
be observed next Sunday morning in j
the church on Hayes street. Archbishop
Riordan will deliver the sermon and
will also administer the papal blessing
at the conclusion of the mass.
The beautiful gold monstrance do
nated to the church some two years or
more ago will be used at benediction,
which is to be said at the conclusion
of the mass.
Special music will be arranged and
sung by the male choir of sixty voices.
In addition to the organ there will be
instrumental music.
Instead of the ordinary high mass,
solemn high mass will be said, but as
yet, owing to possible engagements
that the different priests might have
for Sunday next, nothing definite can
be said concerning those who will be
chosen to act as celebrant, deacon and
sub-deacon of the ceremony.
The altars and sanctuary will be
decorated with candelabra, ferns and
exotic growths. The high altar will be
adorned with myriads of fairy lamps
and wax candles.
The usual vesper services â¢will be
held in the evening.

JilE SAN FttAKCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JAXUARY 11, 1898.
OLD SUIT
ALMOST OVER
Famous Hiller-Ladd Con
test to Be Settled
Here.
Bitter Allegations of Fraud in a
Celebrated Appeal Case
From Oregon.
United States Circuit Court of Appeals
to SettlA the Issues at the
Coming Term.
There will be a decision in the cele
; brated case of Hiller against Ladd at
; the next term of the United States Cir
cuit Court of Appeals. The final briefs
have been filed with Clerk Monckton
and there is little doubt that the court
will reach a decision which will dispose
of the large sums involved in the is
sii-s of the great Oregon case.
The record of the case consumes five
volumes of nearly 600 closely printed
to each volume, and the issues
have been fought with unabated fury
since I^7l. It Is of unusual interest in
San Francisco and Oregon as well for
the reason that the I,adds were well
known in business circles for a long
number of years.
The great contest now nearlng an
end is a suit in equity for an account
ing, growing out of the fact that J.
W. and W. S. I^add owned nearly 8000
shares of the stock of the Oregon Steam
Navigation Company, and that Mrs.
Hiller, who is one of the parties to the
suit now pending, was the "widow of
J. W. Ladd.
The light grows out of the fact that
Mrs. Hiller alleges that her late hus
band's brother. W. S. I,add, who was
â  >n>- of the executors of her husband's
estate, fraudulently procured a trust in
his favor, under which he took posses
sion of all her property and business;
that he fraudulently, and by means of
threats of expensive litigation, induced
her to sign an agreement by which the
will of J. W. Ladd was construed to
give her but half the â¦â¢state, including
the community property, instead of
one-half of the residue, excluding such
property.
Throughout the pleadings the allega
tions arc- fif the most serious character.
It is alleged that Ladd fraudulently
omitted from the inventory of his
brothel's estate 7GOO shares of stock in
the Oregon Steam Navigation Com
pany, and that other equally fraudu
lent transactions were indulged In from
time to time.
In all the many allegations and Is
sues at st;ike there arises the old ques
tion of the woman's delay. Accord
ing to all the evidence she knew of her
<-;;iise of action for more than twenty
years, yet did rot act. Judge Bellinger
decided in favor of the Ladd estate on
the ground of the delay and for other
causes which appeared In the record.
The record In the rase has many ref
erences to Bitch well-known matter* as
the historic Jay Cooke failure, in which
the Ladd interests figured to a large
extent. The .'qipellants ara very severe
In their briefs, alleging that the late
W. S. Ladd in no manner hesitated to
"pluck" his brother's widow in court.
The decision of the many issues in
volved In the case will be watched with
great interest. The case was submit
ted at the last term, but the amended
briefs were filed this week.

Two Warships, the Alert and Marietta,
Leave for Central America
This Week.
The auxiliary schooner Hercules,
built at B-nicla by Turner for a Ger
man firm, attracted considerable atten
tion on the water front yesterday. She
Is a handsome craft and will be used
exclusively In the island trade. Her
sails will be depended upon except
when head winds are encountered, then
her machinery will be called into play.
Gasoline is to be used as fuel and with
a fifty-horse power engine it is ex
pected that she will be able to develop
a speed cf at least 9 knots. The Hercu
les is the fir^t vessel to be built in Cali
fornia for a German firm and to at
once receive a German register. As
soon as she was launched the German
Consul issued .papers to her and the
German tin lt was hoisted over the
schooner. "When she leaves here next
month she will fly the German flag and
under it will go a general cargo for
German trader* in the Marquesas. On
h<T arrival in the South Seas the
schooner will be ;it once placed in com
mission and will begin regular monthly
trips among the iplands, collecting cop
ra, pearl shell and vanilla beans fur ex
port to Germany.
The Germans have secured a firm
hold on the trade of the Southern seas,
and. assisted by Knuland and France,
have almost driven American trade to
the wall. Noi â  < " many years ago San
Francisco was the home port for a
large fleet of Island traders, now the
vessels that char from this port for
Tahiti, the Marquesas, the Carolines
and F.imoa can be counted on the fin
gers of one hand.
Another vessel Is to be placed on the
berth for Copper River. The La Ninfa
is to be again placed in commission and
will leave for < hrca station on Febru
ary 1. If those who go up on her have
no better luck than those who made
the last venture their lines will not be
sown in pleasant places. The W. S.
Phelps, that took up a party several
months ago, has been due back here
for a week past, but as no definite news
was received from her the chances are
that she was not alile to get away as
soon as was expected. On her arrival
It will be known how the miners who
left hÂ»i>> last November in search of
gold on the river's banks have fared.
The sloop -of- war Alert Is to start for
Central America to-day, and the gun
boat Marietta Is expected to get away
for Nicaragua the latter part of the
week. The gunboat is expected down
from Mare Island to-day, and herstores
will be placed aboard at once. On her
arrival in Central American waters she
will bo expected to lend all possible as
sistance to the Nicaragua Canal Com
mission.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
City of Peking, which loft here Decem
ber IS, arrived at Yokohama on the 7th
instant. This Is th.> steamer's one-hun
dredth round trip, but nevertheless she
Is making bettor than the average time.
Bhe was delayed at Honolulu on the
way out.
The Plnta is bring got ready a? the
Mare Island Navy Yard for the San
Diego naval battalion. Her engines
have been taken to piece*, and will be
put in thorough order while the vessel
will be put In perfect order from stem
to Ptern. The Plnta will be a very
handy vessel for the boys in blue at
San Diego, while some think that the
Marion, a 2000-ton ship, will be too
large for the San Francisco division
to handle. The Camanche was taken
to Mare Island on Sunday In four
hours. She was placed alongside the
Marion, and a detail of men was left
at the yard to transfer the battalion's
coal from one vessel to the other.
The river steamers to Vallejo will be
kept busy to-night owing to the Oriffo-
McConnell fight. The Orace Barton
will leave Washington-street wharf at
4. and the Sunol at 6:30, the latter boat
returning to San Francisco after the
fight. The Pinta will run between the
California Powder Works. Selbys. Ro
deo and Crockett. Other boats will car
ry passengers, and it is expected that
San Francisco and Port Costa will send
fully l".0fl men to the fight.
A large Humboldt party, under the
title of the Alaska Mill and Prospect-

NO RULES FOR
POLICE COURTS
Meeting of the Judges
Ends in a Complete
Fizzle.
Judge Conlan Positively Re
fused to Concur in the
Suggestions.
The Points Raised by Chief Lees
Proved a Veritable Stumbling
Block to the Judges.
The well-meant efforts of the police
Judges to formulate a set of rules for
their gruldar.ee have ended in smoke.
Judge Conlan was the first stumbling:
block in the way. He did not attend
the meeting on Saturday afternoon
when the suggestions were made by the
other three Judges and prosecuting at
torneys.
A copy of the suggestions had been
sent to him and yesterday he expressed
his opinion very strongly against them.
"I am perfectly satisfied, " he said
yesterday, "with the existing order of
things. The proposal to take the as
signment of cases out of the hands of
the police department Is, In my opin
ion, unconstitutional. An ordinance of
the Board of Supervisors gives the
Chiof of Police power to depute one
of his offlcors for that duty and to fur
nish a transcript of the cases to each
Judge every morning. This has been
going on very satisfactorily and I see
no reason for changing it.
"The proposition to equally divide the
cases whether the arrests are made by
warrant or not is absurd. The swear
ing to the complaint and the Issuance
of a warrant in a court gives that par
ticular court Jurisdiction, and if the
change were made as suggested it
would not only be illegal, but would in
volve us in a maze of complications and
disputes.
"I am also unalterably opposed to any
proposition to limit the rights of a per
son arrested by refusing to accept
bonds for his release at any time,
whether midnight or not. I shall re
lease a man whenever satisfactory
bonds are submitted to me no matter
what time of night he Is arrested. In
regard to the releasing of a man on his
own recognizance unless the case is in
my own court I shall continue to do
as I have been doing. The old rule is
all right if judges will only take the
trouble to ascertain the class of citi
zens they are dealing with.
"I am agreeable to take my turn at
remaining in chambers until 5 p. m.
I would also agree to the suggestions
regarding the interpreters of the court,
the order of business nnd giving the
prosecuting attorneys alone power to
permit an attorney to assist them in the
prosecution of a case. Outside of these
propositions I think all the others are
wrong."
At 4 o'clock In the afternoon Judges
Campbell. Low nnd Joachimsen. with
their prosecuting attorneys, met In
Judts'e Joachimst/n's chambers to con
sider the suggestions made at the
meeting on Saturday. They had be
come conversant with Judge Conlan's
opinion and it was at once seen that he
had made them ponder. The first sug
gestion taken up was the changing of
the assignment of cases. Judge Camp
bell intimated that he was not to be at
the dictation of Chief Lees or the Po
lice Department as to running his court
and he thought the change should be
adopted. He admitted, however, that
the department could easily work its
own ends by keeping a man arrested for
a felony In the "tanks" until the entry
on the prison register would come In
the regular rotation to the court where
they wanted the case taken.
Judge Low referred to the Hoff case
ns an illustration of how the depart
ment could get a case assigned to a
particular court, which brought forth
a remark from Judge Joachimsen of
"no personalities."
An attempt was made to pass that
particular suggestion until the others
were considered, but Judge Low in
sisted that it should be decided upon
at once.
After some desultory dlsousÃion there
was a general feeling that without
Judge Conlan's consent nothing defi
nite could be done, and as he positively
refused to attend any of the meetings
it was decided to adjourn sine die.
Chief Lees, whose opinion was ex
pressed In yesterday's Call, smiled
when he learned of the outcome of the
meeting. He pointed out that he was
by law the executive officer of the Po
lice Courts, and that by an ordinance
of the Board of Supervisors he was au
thorized to detail an officer to assign
the cases to the different courts, which
had always been done equitably and
without bias.

The Preliminary Examination of
George Tauchi Commenced
Before Judge Low.
The preliminary examination of
George Tauchi, the Japanese charged
with the murder of Mary Castillo, at
901 Sacramento street, on December 26,
was commenced before Judge Low yes

Campbell appeared for the defendant.
The witnesses examined were the
same as at the Coroner's inquest, and
thÂ°ir evidence was practically on the
same lines.
The witnesses were Dr. Gallagher,
the autopsy physician; Louis Fau and
his wife, Maria, at whose house the girl
was murdered; Mrs. Lulu Hatfleld, Po
licemen Flynn. Peshon and Clark and
Detectives Gibson and Wren.
This was the case for the prosecution,
and a continuance was granted till to

case.
A GHOST IN THE
BLYTHE CASE
Answer to the Ejectment Suit
by the Kentucky
Claimants.
Florence Denies That One- Is a Blue
Grass Colonel or That the
Other Is an Arkansan.
The ghost of the Kentucky Blythes
stalked Banquo-like In the United
States Circuit Court yesterday after
noon, and it stalked with a grim air of
determination not to be downed. But
the enemy holding the coveted fort
sniffed scornfully at the warlike
wraith, and even went so far as to as
pert that the ghost was neither a resi
dent nor a citizen of Kentucky, nor of
Arkansas. This was too much for even
a ghost to bear, and it disappeared out
of the windows with a wild shriek.
Two years ago, or to s;;eak more pre
cisely, on December 17, 1895, Henry
Thomas Blythe of Arkansas and John
W. Blythe of Kentucky began a suit
in ejectment In the United States Cir
cuit Court against Florence Blythe |
Hincluey, the premises Involved being !
the Blythe estate. After the usual de
lays incident to the administration of !
the law an amended complaint was
filed, and the matter vas laid to rest
until the courts, both State and Fed
eral, had decided that the property be
longed to Florence as the rightful heir.
What was popularly supposed to be the
cleanup of the litigation was accom
plished about a month ago by Judge
Morrow, but only the court and the
lawyers on both sides knp\v that the
sult'in ejectment was lying in a pigeon- |
hole in the office of the Clerk of the !
I'liit.-d States Circuit Court.
Yesterday the first step toward clean
ing ui> this suit was taken when "W. H. |
H. Hart, on behalf of Mrs. Hinckley,
filed an answer to the amended com- j
plaint. The answer is lengthy and de- !
nles almost everything set forth in the !
complaint by the Blythes from Ken- '
tucky and Arkansas, and even denies j
that ' Thomas is or was a resident or!
citizen of Arkansas, and that John is j
or was a resident of the Blue Grass I
State. It sets forth the fact that all the i
courts that have had anything to do
with the case have declared that Flor
ence is the owner of the estate, and
asks that the plaintiffs be sent out of
court and that they be made to pay the
costs of the suit.
Struck his Father.
Daniel Conley, 411 Harison street, swore
to a complaint in Judge Joachlmsen's
court yesterday for the arrest of his son,
Joseph, who is 24 years of age. on a
charge of battery. Daniel says that his
son is too lazy to work, and when he told
him yesterday morning to go and get
something to do he struck him on the
neck, knocking him down.
Her Arrjbltloo Crushed.
Nora Sullivan, the young girl who ran
away from her home in Oakland to join
a local women's football team, was sent
to the Magdalen Asylum yesterday by
Judge Conlan. Her mother was in court,
and told the Judge that the girl was in
corrigible.

MAKE NO MISTAKE
There Is No Reason Why You Should if You
Follow the Advice Given Below.
"Indigestion is the curse of this coun-
try," says a New York medical jour-
nal in a recent editorial. "Both men
;.nd women suffer from this distressing:
complaint and it causes a tremendous
amount of misery."
This is all very true, but there Is no
reason why any man or woman should
suffer from indigestion when there is
a ready means of preventing it. Thou-
sands of people have discovered a sure
cure and some of them have given the
public the benefit of their experience.
Mrs. E. Tarlton, 345 Park avenue,
Cincinnati, says: "I had dyspepsia for
fifteen years and was entirely cured by
taking Duffy's pure malt whiskey. I
had tried almost everything and know
that this whiskey cures where all others
fail."
W. F. Anderson, 617 "W. Indiana
street, Chicago, says: "I used Duffy's
pure malt whiskey for indigestion and
dyspepsia. My stomach is now in bet-
ter condition than it has been for years
past."
These are only two cases selected
from thousands of others, but they are
sufficient to prove that dyspepsia and
indigestion can be always avoided by
the regular use of Duffy's pure malt.
It will not only keep the digestive or-
gans in perfect condition, but give tone
and energy to every part of the body.

tation.

card the opting day had a decidedly
strong Burns .<- Waterhouae flavor
about it. Tli" stable's rolt. Eddie Jonep,
captured th<- California Maiden Stake,
worth $700 to the winner. Col. Wheeler
led a good field out In the Gojden Gate
Ptnke, which also netted the winner
5700, Sweel Faverdale took the final
$400 purse on T I nd little M<
pitched the thii ! eveni off with Palo
macita, finishing s-von.l. This is a
pretty good showing for one day, anil if
the streak of luck continues ami the
snow holds off the stable ought to lay
some c< In. Nearly all of the oth
er owners have money to burn and are
pimply racing for the fun of it.
Evidently expecting â â¢ n exodus of vis
itors from the pumpkin country or
siime other place, twenty-five book
makers cut in and they found business
very slow. People did not play the fa
vorites with much gusto nor did they
nibble at the tempting prices chalked
against outsiders. It was simply an
off day, that was all. Th" first choices
split with th._- outsidi rs by taking three
of the purses.
In the California ?.7ai<]en Stake the
Morello colt, ]â¢:â : .. â¢ .i ties, had nothjr.g
t" beat, and going to the post a prohib
itive 1 to 6 favorite, galloped in ahead
of the 100 to 1 shot Ravelette, ridden by
Spencer. Bi .â . and Arrow, backed by
all tlv_- wise ones to get the place was

made a short cut on swinging Into th
stretch, taking the place from Sharp.
Willie Martin with the favorite played
in hard luck, getting cut off on the
back stretch and landing in fourth
place.
Of the original big list of entries in
the first race on the programme, a six
furlong sprint, but nine lined up at the
barrier. Don Fulano ruled a slipht
favorite over Sorrow In the betting,
going to the post 3to 2. Ferguson ex

rolt was an even money choice In the
riner. and taking the lead from Blar

difficulty in winning by several lengths
February, a 40 to l shot, was third be
hind Blarneystone.
A very poor crowd started in the mile

by Meany, ruled a T t" .", choice, but
was in poor demand, and so was Thel

means not later than 1 o'clock in the
morning.
The members were called to order
by J. Richard Freud, who served as
secretary of the Charter Committee
of One Hundred.
EL It. Taylor th^n moved that the
convention proceed to elect v chair

As there was no opposition to that
mode of procedure Freud declared
that nominations for presiding officer
srere in order.
"I don't see any need of making

Eoard of Freeholders.
nominations," said E. R. Taylor. "Let
every member write the name of his
choice on a slip of paper."
Tho BUggestiofl was adopted, and
the first bailot resulted in the election
r>f Joseph Pritton, who was Mayor
I'helan's choice for the place. The
vote stood: Britton 8, ex-Mayor
L. R. Ellert 6 and E. R. Taylor 1. On
motion of Eilert tho election of Brit
ton wan made unanimous.
IJritton has twice before presided
over Freeholders' conventions that
have framed charters afterward vot
ed down by the people.
On motion of E. v. Taylor the con
vention then proceeded in the same
manner to elect a secretary by secret
ballot. J. Richard Freud was chosen
on the first ballot. The vote stood:
Freud 11, P. J. Healy 3 and Wallace
Thompson 1.
Miss C. Stockton was unanimously
elected stenographer on motion of L.
R. Ellert.
After a short debate It was decided
that th^ ofQcefl occupied by the Citi
zens' Charter Committee of 100 were
too small for holding the regular
meetings of the Freeholders' Conven
tion and I. Outto and Joseph O'Con
nor were appointed by Chairman
Hritton to secure more commodious
quarters.
I. H. McCarthy thought It advisa
ble to fix the compensation of the sec
retary and stenographer, but the
Oth< r members wore of the opinion
that inasmuch as their pay would not
be provided for until the next tax
levy is made there was ample time to
consider that matter.
On motion of A. W. Thompson the
secretary was instructed to have 100
copies of the charter framed by the
Citizens' Committee printed for the
use of the Freeholders. The citizens'
charter will only be considered as an
advisory document, as several of the
members said that it contained pro
visions that would never meet with
their approval.
L. R. Ellert said It contained many
frivolous and impracticable ideas,
while 11. X. Clement stated that he
believed the Freeholders should act
free and untrammeled by the work of
the Citizens' Committee.
After an uninteresting discussion as
to the number <>f sub-committee
which should be appointed it was de
cided to leave the number and ap
pointment of the committees In the
hands of the chairman, who promised
to have his report ready to-morrow

Let the Illuminant
Alone.
Acrimonious Debate Over the
Lease of the Sailors'
Home.
The Mission Park and the Zoological
Garden Gets a Severe Set
back.
The Board of Supervisors decided
yesterday to refuse to Interfere with
the quality of the illuminating gas
that is furnished to the ratepayers of
fc>iin Francisco.
Supervisor Lackmann's order limiting
the quantity of carbonic monoxide was
reported upon by a special committee
composed of Supervisors Rivers, Shee
han and Delany, that had been ap
pointed to investigate the matter. The
following report offered by the com
mittee was unanimously adopted:
To the Honorable Board of Supervisors
of the City and County of San Fran
cisco:
Gentlemenâ Your Committee on Street
Lights, to which was referred a resolu
tion relative to the manufacture and lim
iting the amount of carbon monoxide in
tins used for Illuminating purposes, would
respectfully report that your committee
held an investigation which demonstrated
that all gas, if inhaled, is poisonous,
whether manufactured and known as coal
gas or as water gas:
That water gas, so called, is supplanting
what is known as coal gas principally
because of its reduced cost and greater
illuminating power.
The question of care is essential in the
use of gas, an( i it is certainly not the
function of this Board to stand in the
Way 01' attempts to regulate the manufac
ture of gas, when it is not disputed that
all large cities are â¢ gaged In its manu
facture and when it is shown that water
gas plants are rapidly being Introduced to
supplant the works by which coal gas
in manufactured, so that a higher lllumln
ant can be produced.
Your committee, therefore, recommend
the indefinite postponement of the reso
lution as being at variance with business
enterprise which is recognized as progres
sive in other cities, as in no respects will
that gas. when used, have disastrous re
sults if ordinary prudence is exercised In
its use. T. W. RIVERS,

WEDDED TWENTY-FIVE YEARS.
Mr. and Mrs. Charles Simon celebrated their silver wedding last
Wednesday evening at their r.-aider.ce, 2315 V;in Ness avenue. The house
was beautifully decorated with flowers, plants and delicate trailing
Vines, and the guests*, who numbered nearly 100. were composed of repre
sentatives of San Francisco's best Jewish and German element. Exquisite
music was rendered for the advent of the bride ami groom, who at the
proper time recounted the stc-jfs happily takt-n twenty-live years ago to
the strains of Mendelssohn's Wedding March. The evening was a most
joyous one to all concerned, tlx- discussion of a sumptuous banquet
being a feature second only to the happy felicitations for the bride and
Kroom, who are among the most popular people in the social circles in
whioh they move.
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL., TirESDAI, JANUARY 11, ISÂ»S.
THE LATE A. E. HECHT.
ThÂ« death "f Abraham K. Hecht of the firm <>f Hecht Bros, was an
nounced yesterday forenoon. The fteoeased gentleman was well and favorably
known, not only in commercial and banking circles of thâ¬ city, hut to the
various charitable institutions in and about Ban Francisco. Few, if any, of
the many movements got up for the benefit of the \Â»>>r and distressed
in this community were permitted to proce.d without the name of Hecht
Bros, being at the head of the list. N<Â» applicant for any worthy object was
ever turned aw;iy empty-handed from th<' banking counts* of Hecht Bros.
Abraham E. Hecht was born in HainsTii.lt. Germany, on May 23, 1838,
and nt the age of 10 years left his native laii'l and arrived in Haltimore,
where he remained until IS6I. Thence he came to San Francisco and at once
became a member of the firm of Hecht Bros., and also <>f the firm of Hecht
& Buckingham, thÂ«.- well-known boot and shoe manufacturer* About nve
yean ago he levered his connection with th" Buckingham interest and de
voted his time ;i!:Â«l energy to the tirm of Hecht Urns, in the banking busi
ness, with offices at 012 Pine street. The ele-ant residence at 1201 Van Ness
avenue was owned and occupied by the deceased up to the time of his
death. Tho doors of this mansion were open to all who came on errands of
charity or on social invitations.
The funeral of Mr. Hecht will take place from th.> family residence to
morrow morning at 9:45, and will be followed by his many friends to Cy
press Lawn Cemetery, where the remains will be ii-niHted according to
his express wish, fie not only was a believer in cremation, but was one of
the promoters on this Coast of this mode of reducing oodles to ashes after
death. His death was brought about by Blight's vi-- is*, from which he
has been â  sufferer for thÂ«- imst four years, hut only within the past four
months has hÂ«' been confined to his home. He leaves a widow and four chil
dren, two boys and two girls, to mourn the loss of a ioving husband and
father.
BEST FARCE
OF THE SEASON.
"The Man From Mexico"
an Almost Unbroken
Chain of Laughs.
Willie Collier More Than His

ing Part.
Nellie UcHenry'l New Piece â Alcazur
Cometly-DrÂ«nia, Orpheum Vh
ri^ty .-iiirl Others.
"The Man From Mexico," I ;im told,
is an old French farce l<>np since Eng
lished and now done into American by
H. A. Dv Souchet as th<- means of ex
plolting the farcical acting of Willie
Collier. Personally I know nothing of
th>* antecedents of the piece. There is
a suggestion of French craft in the
BituattonaJ scheme; but that su^gestiun
is not thÂ«- usual one. "The Man Prom
Mexico" begins to commence at just the
time of ailvi-nture when most French
farces begin to end. The awful night
of excitement, complication and veiled
Identity at the questionable house Of
entertainment Is all over when the cur
tain raises on the first act. Benjamin
Fltzhugh has had his night <>f it. to
gether with his friend Majors: and Mrs.
Fitzhueh has had hers while vainly
trying to follow them. The chasers and
the ilias.-t did not meet and now all
would be serenely over â only Fitzhugh
was arrested, sentenced to thirty days
on Blackwella 1-iand with the one
privilege of Brst going home to
straighten Â»>ut hie affairs.
The action canniences with Fitz
hugh In his >\\n house, under
charge or* a deputy, doomed to serve
thirty days and plausibly account for

plication and the beginning of the oth
ers is that he leaves borne avowedly
bound for the hind of Mexico. In bare
plot th*- ivst of it is thai be goes to jail
and endures â  Bolld month of comical
misunderstanding, and finally comes

even his eventual confession of part <>f

Thi.: ai rana*em< at may be an <>id one
but it is new i" me And the rush of
humor that Dv Sum bet has Riven to
the lines and counter complications and
thÂ«- real Caree-comedic enterprise with
which Willie Collier plays the part of
Fitzhuijh are new. valuable and Am~r-
Ican to everybody, [n apportioning the
honors of the fun it is hard to say
wh^re Dv Souchet ends and Collier
commences. As a performance it is the
funnlesi since Gillette's production of
To-, llucfa Johnson." In partsâ in all
of the prison sceneâ it is funnier than
anything in Gillette'" farce; and al
though the ending of the lirst act is
weak and many episodes are glided
over without attempt at .\en the li
cenaed probability of farce, it has. on
the Whole, a certain mirthful magnet
ism that makes it a fair lival to that
little masterpiece at:i In every way the
peer ol "My Friend from India."
I have never seen an audience laugh
louder and heartier than the audience
at the Baldwin laugh. d last night. Dur
ing the prison act, where â¢ very line is
a point and .-very point a swell in the
crescendo, thÂ«- laughter became a very
part of the playâ holding Lack its ac
tion in regard to actual time, and by
so doing quickening its excitement, em
phasising its drolleries and intensify
ing its comic suspense.
The acting devolves upon Mr. Col
lier, who acquits himself of the center
of everything without a struggle on his
part or a regret on yours. His humor
is deft. Spontaneous and always com
panion;. hie. Dan Mason does* a line
bit of (Jerman character; Maclyn Ar
bUCkle, always a valuable actor, does
the comparatively legitimate comedy
part of Fitz's friend with easy author
ity, and Louise Alien dances splashing
!y and plays the wife for about what it
is worth. The others are all more or
less good, but not necessarily mention
able. The engagement should be one
of the most successful of the season

if you go to see Nellie Mcllenry do not
get tired and leave at the close of the
first art. There is more to come and you
will forget the tiresomeness of that act
in the jollity that follows. Just what
"A NiÃht in New York" is would lie dif
ficult to say. but that it will make you
laugh is a settled fact. Yet if you are
asked next morning what it was that you
laughed at you will tird that you can't
remember. It is called "an enchanting
effervescent, lyrical drama novelty."
whatever that may moan, but no mat
ter what the name It la something new
quick and jollyâ jolly as only Nellie Mc-
Hf-nry can make â  play.
There {â  Just enough of a plot to hang
the specialty work on, and with one ex
ception the vaudeville turns are clever
and new. Billy Barry as an acrobatic
comedian is as clever as any who have
made their appearance on San Francisco
stages, and his changes were of a nature
that kept the audience guessing as to
what he would do next. His dancing and
tumbling are something wonderful in
their surprises, while his character work
is of a pleasing versatility.
Nellie MoHenry is just the same Nellie
that we used to admire and lautrh with
âwell, it won't do to say how long ago
for she looks just as young as she did
then and is just as chic, just us happy
and has just the same little quirk of her

I mouth that used to please us. She has
surrounded herself with clever people
and her play goes smoothly after the
first act. There is good dancing, high
kicking and singing that is above the
ordinary, consequently the engagement
should be a success all the week.
Orpheum.
What has been the loss to Parisians has
been the gain to theatergoers of San
Francisco. The booking of Paulo and
Dika by the Orpheum management shows
an endeavor to please that is appreciated
and the applause and recalls which
marked their appearance is sufficient to
show that no mistake was made in their
selection.
Barney and Russell, In their character
sketches, are clever and pleasing and
wen- greeted with applause and laugh
ter in each of their skits.
La Petite Lund is a little girl with a
sweet voice and catchy manner who sings
and ilances in a way that goes directly
to th<- bearta of the audit nee and marks
her. as she is billed, an infant prodigy.
ThÂ«* old favorites who have been re
tained were well received and have lost
none of their hold on the people.
Alcazar.
In their collaboration Mrs. Burnett and
William Gillette evolved a beautiful story
in the play of â¢"Etmeralda." It is a play
that appeals to hearts, and the company
have entered into the spirit of the au
thors and give a production that is well
worth seeing. The play is smooth and
even and the Aleasur company seem pe
culiarly adapted to it 6 phases. There is
a noticeable evenness In thÂ« playing and
from the rising to tho falling of the cur
tain there is hardly a part that is halt
ing or jarring.
The story of Esmeralda is a homely one
and the acting of the various parts is of
a character that Indicates that neither
Stockbridge nor his old support wore ab
solutely necessary for the good perform
ances which marked its first production.
The work of the present members of the
cast shows that they have a play for
which they are particularly adapted and
it also shows that no one can k<> astray
in going to the Alcazar it' desirous of see
ing a bit of work that touches the heart
strings without leaving a touch of bit
terness.
Morosco's.
"The Plunger" is not a novelty at
Morocco's, but it teems with the sort of
excitement that is ever new to the
patrons of this house, is sumptuously
staged and played for all it is worth by
a company that is expert in the business
of melodrama.
Tivoli.
New jokes, new songs, especially the
gavotte, "The Dames and Dudes of Long
Ago," sunp by the children, distinguish the
second edition of "Mother Goose" at the
Tivoli. This popular holiday spectacle
will soon five way to the new Irish ro
mance, "Brian Boru."

ANOTHER TOLAND WILL.
Second Testament piled by the

the Purport of the First.
In order to strengthen his claim to
the estate of his mother, and better
ward off the attack of a contestant,
Hugo H. Toland has applied to the Pro

mitting to probate the last will of lira.

April 13, ISM, to probate, that they may
stand together and better prove the in
tention of the testatrix in the disposi
tion of her property.
The will the court is asked to admit
together with the last testament of
Mrs. 'Poland provides for almost the
same bequests as the later one, but
favors her son to a greater degree. The
bulk of the $60,000 estate is left to Hffgo
H. Toland, and consists of all the tule
lands and docking place on the Sacra
mento River, known as "Tolands." In
the pricr will it is requested that the
property remain in the hands of the
devisee for his benefit. The executors
of the will are requested not to sell or
allow the property to be sold, if not ab
solutely necessary, as it is the wish of
the testatrix, as well as that of her
husband prior to his death, that the
property remain in the hands of the
son. that he might always have an in

DRIED APPLE TRADE.
A REVIEW OF THE EASTERN MARKET
LAST YEAR.
The New York Shipping List says of the
Dried Apple trade:
â¢â Probably the largest i pple crop ever known
was that of 1S:Â»6. and the production of evap
orated apt â  â¢ correspondingly large, exceed
ing the output of any previous year. It is said,
by at least 100 per cent. As a natural eonse
quonce prices ruled extremely low. and in
many case? the BnisheO product sold at cos!
and even below. The lowest ebb of values was
in February, when prime apples sold at 3' s c.
Prices hung along at about that figure until in
March, and dealers almost despaired of an
Improvement. The prevailing cheapness, how
ever, luduced a large export demand, and ship
ments abroad were no phenomenal that the
surplus product was absorbed and left small
stocks 0:1 hand when the new goods began to
arrive. Values soon felt the effect of the in
creased consumption and gradually rose until
in November prime wood-dried sold freely at
SHe, and some few sales were consummated at
-v c. The short crop of the year Just closed
materially assisted in elevating values, and
though the market is rather quiet at present
prices are firmly maintained ..t the current
quotations. Regarding the quality of the new
crop it is reported nut so good as the previous
years except in color and dry ness, and better
grades of apples being sold green, only small
and seconds being evaporated."

pressure to sell for. London account, and prices
of Americans were lower before the opening

belief that large lines of stocks are already

These holdings, It is argued, might be dis- |
lodged by a slight reaction and passed into i
the bands of large combined Interests. Doubt

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Jan. 10.â The Evening Post's
London rablfÃram Bays:
The stocks here to-day were Irregular and
with a less measured tendency. Consols and
kindred stocks sold lower on expectations or
gold shipments this week to Argentina, hence,
also, a further lift- In Arsentina stocks. â¢
Americans relapsed on .i New York cable to
the Times predicting a silver majority In the
next House, etc.. which, while regarded as too
pessimistic. Is none the less likely to disturb
the public here, as reviving the sliver scare.
The reaction would have, been more severe but
for the Continental support and arbitrage
houses covering shorts. New York also ab
sorbed stocks freely. '
Mines were steady. The settlement shows a
small account, but contangoes were fairly
high, despite cheaper money.
A feature to-day was the strength of Indian
exchange. The India Council sold telegraphic
transfers as hiwh as IG' . I am Informed from
good quarters that a scheme is being dis
cussed, Hie main point of which would pro
vide that Instead of gold being actually
shipped to India, It would be stored by the
Indian treasury on this side and rupees would
be Issued aeainst it In India. The entire
scheme is of the most Importance. It will not
pent-rally be known here until to morrow and
it la not definitely arranged. Russian ex
change to-day made an Important advance,
reaching 94.75.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 10.â Wheat opened weak at
I from He to %c below Saturday's closing
! prices. It held fairly firm during the greater
part of the forenoon at about starting prices.
First trades for May delivered were made at
from M%C to 90Â»ic as against 91% cat the
dose Saturday. The ran^e from that time up
to the publication of the visible supply state
ment was from Sic down to 90% c. The early
drop In prices was due practically to a \d de
clnie. at Liverpool and slightly easier quota
tions from Paris. A Liverpool Corn Trade
News cablegram said that an official Russian
report made wheat show a deficiency of â¢'â¢'.<.
000.000 bushels, compared with the previous
year's crop. The closing quotations in for
eign markets suggested Kreater heaviness than
there was any visible reason for at this dis
t trict. Liverpool closed at a decline for the
day of vid to Id; Paris from M to 60 centimes
lower for flour and 25c to 20c down for wheat.
The market became quite weak toward the
: end. Up to within half an hour from the close
May Bold around 9Â»\r, but the weak closing
cables caused renewed selling, which, com
ins: on an unwilling market, caused a further
break to 90\c. May was offered at 90'^c at the
close.
Corn was very slow and weak, closing; '/iSHc
lower.
Oats were weak from the start. May closed
=.' lower.
Provisions were dull and heavy. At the close
May pork was 10c lower. May lard 10'4c lower

NO BURGLARS
TO SHOOT
Ludwig Warnke's Alarm
Causes a Great
Scare.
An Oiled Clock the Basis of a
Sensation in the Quiet
Town of Alameda
Grave Doubts ns to Who Sent a Shot
Through the. Grocer's
Window,
Oakland Office S. F. Call.
f'OS Broadway, Jan. 10.
Ludwig Warnke, the well-known ten
or singer, is now trying to distinguish
the difference between a burglar alarm
and the alarm of an eight-day clock.
A confusion oi the sounds emitted by
these different instruments a few
weeks ago caused him a severe cold,
gave Mrs. Warnke an unnecessary
fright and necessitated the repairing of
a window through which neighbors say
Warnke shot at imaginary burglars,
which Incident Warnke denies.
Mr. Warnke keeps a grocer shop at
the corner of Railroad avenue and Wil
]cw street, across the estuary. He
has run his store for a number of years.
Mf-re recently he has been annoyed,
and has suffered somewhat by t;j? dep
redations of burglars on various occa
sions.
During thÂ«Â» past two yearn house
breakers have patronized his store to
euch an extent that he became tired of
th<Â» habit of waking in the morning,
finding himself robbed and reporting
the matter to the police. He decided
to make a change in his method of pro
tecting the store. H<Â» purchased a most
complete system of burglar alarm, and
bo thoroughly did he place these safe
guards around his store that the only
place a burgiar â¢ could come in was
down the chimney, and as soon as he
stepped out of the grate he would even
then Ftart the alarm.
A gof.'d deal of sympathy was ex
pressed for Mr. Warnke. He is well
known. Is a popular tenor singer, ar
range; â¢harity entertainments, has tak
en part in several operas and is a sing
er at St. Joseph's Church in Alarm-da.
It was on the advice of several of his
friends that he protected his house and
store with burglar alarms. He moved
Into the dwelling m-xt to his grocery
chop, and the thief-catching system
was connected with his bedroom. Sev
eral tlm^s he tested th" works, and on
each occasion the most hysterical noise
â was emitted in his sleeping chamber by
the alarm bell. After taking these pre
cautions Warnke felt safe.
The other night there was a violent
ringing of the alarm in Warnke"s bed
room. Freezintr as it was. Warnke
Jumped up. grabbed his revolver and
went forth to shont the burglars. He
had previously, so he says, studied thÂ«Â»
latitude and longitude and bearing of
every barrel and box in his store, fo
that he had no need to obtain a Hcht
to rush to the door in his wild rhase
for the thief. However, the usual ac
cident did happen, and if there were a
burerlar he escaped while Warnke was
paying his respects to his stubby toe.
Neighbors down the street heard a
few shots fired, and Mrs. Warnke
found a broken window, but her hus
band declares that he did not fire, and
that the shots were from somebody
else's gun.
An examination of the alarm system
found that It was Intact, nor had It
b^en disturbed, nor had the belt pound
ed. The police who were called in did
not find anything to Justify even a sus
picion of burelary, and Warnke believ
ed for a time that the store was haunt
ed.
A littlÂ«Â» lator an Investigation was
made, and the sinrrer discovered that
all the troubles had he^n caused by an
old rusty flock which had been kicking
around the house for several months
Durincr the previous day to the sensa
tion which aroused the neighborhood
one of the little Warnkefi bad tried to
make thÂ» clock cr 7 by pourlnar oil upon
the works. About 2 o'clock in the
mornine the oil pot in its deadly work
nnd released sufficient of the rust to
start the over-wound sprincrs and make
the alarm sound as it never sounded
before. This is the explanation given
by Mr. Warnke to-day.
But the people in the nniehbr.-rbood
are still trvlne to discover who fired
the shot that broke the window.

Extravagance to Indigents to
Be Supplanted by
Economy.
Supervisor Wells Anxiotts to Do All
in His Power to Remedy
the Evil.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, Jan. 10.
The recommendation of the Grand \
! Jury that some system be followed in
! looking after the indigents of this
county has borne fruit, and the extrav
agance of past methods will probably
soon be ended.
The ladies of Murray Township have
started a society which will probably
i result in a plan of co-operation be
' tween all the townships in the county
: and the Asociated Charities of Oak
1 land. The first meeting was held at
Llvermore Saturday and Mrs. Knox,
Mrs. Langan and Mrs. Pitcher were
appointed a committee on organization.
They reported in favor of Mrs. A. L.
Fuller for president, Mrs. Wendell Jor
dan, vice-president; Mrs. J. McKeon,
treasurer: Miss Pearl Pitcher, secre
tary, and their report was adopted.
Next Saturday the ladies will adopt the
constitution and by-laws and proceed
| to perfect their organization.
Supervisor Wells said to-day that he
would cheerfully co-operate with the
ladies of the organization in the sys
tematic distribution of relief. It was
Supervisor Wells' district while under
I the charge of ex-Supervisor Bailey that
j was criticized by the Grand Jury, and
Lromprises Washington and Murray
[townships. In this district $6000 less
60 cents was given away indiscrimin
ately by the Supervisor in one year,
and this is consl lered to !>Â»â¢ too much
to bo distributed without any system
or organised effort to discover the mer

Sunday Night Burglars.
ALAM?:DA, Jan. 10.â Hurglars fil
tered the residence of Ralph Kramer at
2169 San Jose avenue last evening and
ransacked the place thoroughly, steal
ing some articles of clothing and Jew
elry. The family went to church short
ly after 7 o'clock and returned at a
little past 9. As soon a? they entered
the house they found that some one had
been there during their absence, as ar
ticles of clothing were scattered about
on the floor and things were in confu
sion. A search showed that burglars
had entered through a front window by
prying it open with a jimmy, after hay-
ing unsuccessfully tried to effect an
entrance through a rear window.
They had burned a great many
matches and lÂ°ft them scattered
around, and had managed to find a
fiipii many articles of Jewelry and sil
verware. They must have become
frightened for some reason, for th-^y
did not carry off what they could read
ily have taken and only took a coat and
rest, a muffler, a ring and a lady's gold
watch and fob, the whole valued at be
tween $61 and $70. There was a Con
siderable sum of money in the house,
\fhich was fortunately not found by the
thieves.
There is no clew, but the burglars are
supposed to belong to the same gang
which has been operating In the sub
urbs of Oakland for some time past.
Lincoln-Avenue Condemnation Suit.
ALAMEDA. Jan. 10.â The condem
nation suit of the city of Alarvda
against the Cohen estate in the matter
of the opening of Lincoln avenue came
up again in Judge Greene's court this
afternoon and was put over till the
29th inÂ«t. Considerable curiosity is
felt as to whether the Cohens will not
come into court and agree to accept
the award of some $.">ioo for damages
made by the commission and paid Into
court for them and abandon their op
position to the opening. It is not be
lieved that the commission would
again make so large an award, as the
values of real estate have materially
decreased since it was made.
Attacking a Will.
ALAMKDA, Jan. 10.â Last summer
Kdouard Louis, a saloon keeper of this
place, was accidentally shot and killed
by a companion while on a camping
trip to Sunol. He left considerable prop
erty, which was all bequeathed by will
to his wife. His mother, Mrs. Mariana
Louis, has now come forward and filed
a contest, alleging that the will was
made and signed by her son while he
was in a state of intoxication, and
therefore it is not a competent docu
ment. She wants it thrown out and
the estate divided according to law
which would give her a share. The
widow indignantly denies the truth of
the mother's allegations reflecting on
the memory of her son.

FINE HEALTH
OF OAKLAND
Officer Dunn's Report Is
Full of Flattering
Figures.
Public Schools Said, to Be in a
Splendid Sanitary Con
dition.
The Growing City Needs Another
Inspector of Markets and
Foods.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 10.
The annual report of the Board of j
Health for the year ending June, 1597,
has just been published, and it shows !
that this city enjoys remarkable health '
In comparison with other large cities.
Health Officer Dunn says: "The
health of the city has remained at Its
usual high standard during the past
year. Comparison with other cities
shows that the death rate In New Or- {
leans is 23.34 per thousand, in NÂ«W
York 21.52, San Francisco 17.08, Sacra
mento 1.".60. while in Oakland It is 12.22.
The very low death rate from zymotic
diseases was v marked feature in last
years report, and when our marshes
are filled in and drained and some fur- j
tber improvements made in our sewers
this will fall still lower."
The health officer commends the san
itary condition of the schools, but con
demns vary forcibly the condition of
the city prise in ;m<l th^ marsh land. "He
advises that in view of the growth of
the city the office of veterinary sur
geon and market inspector should be
divided into two offices so that the
work can be better looked after. Dur
ing the year there were 7G4 births in
this city, and 1243 marriages, while
there were but 733 deaths.

"God's house is not a concert or lec

Twenty-five regular and fifteen special

WILL BUILD A
" BIG C " FENCE
Berkeley Seniors to Inaugurate
Quite a Unique Cus
tom.
The Structure to Stand on the Campus
Eabt of the Old North
Hall.
BERKELEY, Jan. 10.â At an infor
mal meeting of a number of university
seniors this afternoon a unique plan
for a "senior fence" was devised and
resolved upon. The scheme is to have
the fence in the form of an immense
"C," similar in shape to an octagon,
with one side missing. Each of the
sides will be 16 feet in length, and the
fence, it is estimated, will seat in the
neighborhood of 100, or flve-sixths of
tho men of the senior class.
The project has been received so en
thusiastically that there is little doubt
that it will be carried out. A com
mittee will probably be appointed soon
to request permission of the university
authorities, who will undoubtedly sanc
tion the scheme. In all probability the
"Big C" fence will be completed before
tho end of the present month.
The fence will consist of sixteen foot
lengths of planed hard pine boards, six
inches wide by three inches deep, rest
ing upon rodwofTtl posts, six by six
inches in size, placed at Intervals of
eight feet. The fenre will be four feet
in height. An iron foot railing will
run the entire length of the "C."
The suggestion has been made that
in the future when the permanent
buildings for the university are being
constructed, a monumental stone "C,"
with a fountain in the center and stat
ues in the angles formed by th sides,
be erected by the alumni of the present
senior class as a memorial of the class
rf '98.
The proposed location of the "Big C"
fence is on the campus just east of
North Hall, wh^rc one of the recita
tion tents used to stand.
QUEER DETECTIVES.

The letter says:
I am very sorry about the way these

ALAMEDA, Jan. 10.â A meeting will
be held to-morrow evening at the City I

there is a sentiment that it would be
better to build a new Grammar School,
as such a structure would accommo
date severrJ times ns many pupils as
there are no v in the High School, or
likely to be for a good while to come.
Invitations have been sent out to a

Law.
Contractors Will Not Get Their De
mands Audited Because of
Irregularities.
Auditor Broderick informed tho
Board of Supervisors yesterday that he
did not intend to allow the city to pay
for the street corner signs that were
ordered some time ago by the Superin
tendent of Streets for downtown cor
ners, and that if the contractor wants
his money he must look elsewhere. The
main reason why the Auditor objects
to allowing the city to pay for the ma
roon and silver signs that now adorn
the corners of many of the downtown
streets were set forth in The Call some
time ago, but in his veto to the board
he elaborates on the matter, and ex
plains his reasons fully. His letter is
in tho main as follows:
These demands I return for the reason
that I am unable to find any law that
directs their allowance and audit or
through which I can see any reason for
the charge being made against this, city
and count j.
The only law on the subject that I have
discovered in the search is an ordinance
of the Board of Supervisors, and known
as ordinance No. 1727, approved August
14. 1 9 >". "providing for tne erection and
maintenance of street guides throughout
the city and county of San Francisco,"
In which it is provided:
Section 1. AH owners of. real estate
cornering on the crossings or intersec
tions of any streets, etc., are hereby re
quired to erect and maintain at their own
cost and expense street guides. â¢ â¢ â¢
The Superintendent of Streets by this
ordinance has certain duties assigned to
him, etc.'
I do not find any power vested in the
Superintendent of "Streets by this ordi
nance to order street signs or guides
placed upon corner houses or buildings
and chargeable against this city and
county.
An examination of the bills accompany
ing the demands will show that the own
era of some of the buildings upon which
signs are charged for are amply able to
pay for tho same if the ordinance Re of
any virtue. The city has lately been gen
erally canvaHsed and many property
ownen have been induced to place street
guides on their buildings and have been
obliged to pay for the same from their
own pockets, and I can see no rea
son for drawing any distinction be
tween the moderately circumstanced
property-ownÂ«r and the wealthy. If tho
former has boon obligod to pay from his
pocket, why should not the wealthy and
millionaires, etc.. the same?
I look upon these demands as Illegal
and in conflict with the spirit of our laws
and form of government, and therefore
refuse t<> audit or allow the same. Re
spectfully submitted.
WILLIAM BRODERiriC.
City and County Auditor.
The Auditor also returned to tho
board, unsigned, warrants in favor of
Gray Brothers for work done fronting
on Lafayette square, amounting to
! $3578 08. and in favor of J. J. Dowling
; for work done fronting on Alamo square
1 amounting to $1495 35. He was unable
to find any law authorizing the pay
j ment of demands in the form in which
i they were presented.
EVANGELIZING
SAN FRANCISCO
Undenominational Revival
Meetings to Be Held
Here.
Mojor Hilton, the Evangelist From
the East, Will Lead the
Services.
The plans for holding large unde
nominational evangelistic meetings
wore discussed at the meeting of the
Presbyterian ministers yesterday morn
ing. They decided to invite all the
ministers of the various sects to join
with them in inaugurating these meet
ings during the time that Major Hilton
(the evangelist), who is now holding a
revival at the Howard Presbyterian
Church, is In this city.
One of the ministers stated that the
meetings would be an assured success
owing to the fact that it has been five
or six years since there had been an
evangelist in this city.
It was then decided that a committee
be appointed to communicate with the
ministers of the other denominations
and a central locality be chosen in
which these meeting* may be held, if
the other churches agree.
Major Hilton addressed the Presby- :
terian ministers yesterday morning,
and those that had the pleasure of lis
tening to him did so with marked at
tention. He spok,e on the converting
of those who did not belong to the ;
church. He stated that it was not only
those that were not of the fold, but also ;
the stylish member of the church, that
had no more faith and had God less in i
his heart than some poor old soul who j
had never entered a church. "If any !
of you wish to take up ..j.^sionary j
work," he said, "do not go to China or \
Japan. Stay right in San Francisco; j
or. If you do insist upon leaving home !
go to Chicago, New York or Pittsburg.
There are plenty of souls that need
saving in all these places."
The Bay Association met yesterday
at the Y. If. C. A. building and dis
cussed "The Methods of the Associa
tion." The result was that a commit
tee was formed to look into them.

A STARTLING ERROR.
City Giver) Big Damages by Mis-
taKe, but thje MistaKe Has
Been Rectified.
In the caso c-f the City and County
against John Center a mistake has been
found and rectified that might have re
sulted in endless entanglements and lit
igation. It was a case in which the
city and county sought to quiet title to
a strip of land along the old Mission
Creek bed. The section had been cut
up in small holdings, and was occupied
by 209 tenants, who were made defend
ants in the action. As the property
was valued at $150,000. the City and
County Attorney, when he instigated
suit, demanded restitution of the prop
erty and $150,000 damages for unlawful
concession. Judge Slack, before whom
the trial took place, decided that the
property must be returned to the city
and county, but held that no damage
had resulted through its detentio-n.
Rhodes Borden, who represented the
plaintiff in the action, was instructed
to draw up a decree In accordance with
the findings of the court, and in doing
so he inadvertently concluded with the
words: "I^et judgment be entered for
the plaintiff, as prayed for in the com
plaint." This allowed the damages;
prayed for contrary to the decision of
the court, but as Judge Slack did not
notice the difference he signed it when
it was presented. Fortunately, no ap
peal was taken from the judgment, and
the mistake was discovered and recti
fied before the record became seriously
tangled.

CRUSHED BY
MISFORTUNES
Josie Kelly Is Now a
Wreck of Her Former .
Self.
A Year Ago Her Husband Was
Sentenced to Ten Years
for Burglary.
SineÂ© Then H~r Only Child Was
Killed Almost Before Her Eyes
and Her Sister* Have Died.
It Is an old saying that "misfortunes
never come singly," and an apt illus
tration came to light yesterday in the
case of Josie KHly who is in the City
Prison awaiting her sentence on the
charge of vagrancy.
About a year ago Josie'g husband,
Patrick Kelly, was sentenced to ten
years in San Quentin on the charge of
burglary. He and two others broke
into several residences on Pine street
and the surrounding locality. At the
time Kelly was arrested he w;is wi;h
his wife and as a quantity of the Btolt :;
property was found in their room she
was also taken to the City Prison and
detained fur a few days.
While K<-lly and his companions were
in the City Prison awaiting their pre
liminary examination, Kelly had pre
pared an ingenious scheme fur mak
ing his escape. < >ne day when his
wif-- called ui>.'n him she was observed
to secretly pass something to him. Af
ter she had gone Kelly was searched
and a key made of zinc ami an .-xaot
duplicate of the key for opening the
prison door was found upon him, be
sides four fine fll< s. It was strongly
Btispected that by some means or other
Kelly had obtained an impression of
thf- key and had eriven it to his wife
to take to a locksmith. As there was
no absolute proof of her guilt no action
was taken against her.
About this time Jonie was a tall.
handsome, healthy woman, devoted to
her husband. His sentence of ten â 
years came a few months later and in
March last while sh.' was living with
her boy. a bright little fellow of *ix
years of age. In the Brunswick House,
Sixth and Howard streets, she met
with her greatest misfortune. She had
Just left h*T room on the fourth door
to call upon a friend when the boy,
who was amusing himself by sliding
down the banisters, lost his balance and
fell to the basement, being Instantly
killed. A friend ran after her and
brought her back. She has never re- j
covered from thÂ»^ terrible sh". k and it
was the cause of her downfall. She
nursed h^r sorrow for a time and then
nought solace In drink. To add to h-r |
misery a favorite sister died in May
last and two or throe months later her
other sister died.
Recently sh>* has b^en doing odd j"bs
in a saloon kept by Mrs. Gu^rs. 722
Howard street, but as her conduct
could not be overlooked. Policeman
Say arrested her about 1 o'clock yes
terday morning and locked her up in;
the City Prison on a qharge of va
grancy.
Sly presented a pitiable sight ns sh-">
appeared in Judge Conlan's court yes
terday morning. Her face was swol
len to an unnatural size and her cough-
Ing was painful to hear. She had no
defense to offer and the Judge con- ;
victed her and ordered her to appear
for sentence this morning.
"I am not a vag." Â«aid Josie in the ;
prison yesterday. "I was intending to
go to the City Hnd County Hospital to
day as I am suffering from bronchial
troubles and was in Mrs. Otters' sa
loon when the policeman came in and
arr^st^d m<\ Mrs. Overs and some
othÂ«r friends will go before the Judge
to-morrow morning and ask that I be
discharged. I have had my troubles
and It Is hard to bear up under them,
but I will promise to do my best and
all that I want is a good position where
I will be away from temptation."
AN ORDINANCE
CALLED INVALID
It Prohibits Merchants From
Giving Gifts to Their Cus
tomers.
Judqo Campbell Decides That It Is
Legislation Interfering With the
Liberty of the Subject.
A few days apo A. Swppt, manaper
of th" Great American T<-;i Company,
was arrested f'Â«r violating ;i recent or
dinance passed by the Board <>f Super
visors prohibiting the giving of prizes?
by local merchants to their custoi â¢
AVhen th<-- case was called in Judge
Â«'ampb<>ll's court last Friday. Sweet's
attorney entered a demurrer and moved
to dismiss tlie c;is.- on the ground that
the ordinance under which the com
plaint wns made was unconstitutional
and Invalid.
Judge Campbell rendered his derision
yesterday. In whicb be declared th;it
the ordinance is unconstitutional, on
on the ground that it Interferes with
commercial liberty.
â¢â¢This legislation," said the Judge in
his decision, "is evidently of that kind
which has been so Frequent of hueâ a
kind which Is meant to protect some
class in the community against the
fair, free and full competition <.f somÂ»
other class, the members of Xh>- former
class thinking it Impossible to hold their
own against Bach competition and.
therefore. Hying to the Legislature
to sf( ure some enactment which shall
operate favorably to them or unfavor
ably to their competitors in the com
mercial, agricultural, manufacturing or
producing flelds. I>y the provisions "f
this act a nuiii owning articles of food
which he wishes tÂ«> sell or dispose of is
limited in his powers of sale or disposi
tion. A liberty to adopt or follow (or :i
livelihood a lawful industrial pursuit
and in a manner not injurious to the
community Is certainly infringed upon,
limited, perhaps weakened or destroyed.
by .such legislation. It Is certainly
lawful to Bell, as In this instance, cof
fee and tea. It Is an article of food and
Is now one of the necessaries of life to
a lartre number of people. A person ph
sjaged as a retailer of coffee or tea
might very well think. that he could
Rreatly enlarge the amount of his trade
by offering some inducement to the
purchaser.
"It should be here stated that th<- ele
ments of a lottery do not enter into
the ordinance here in question, but
Order Ho. 14. Sub. .1, of the Hoard of
Supervisors provides for any gift de
pending on a contingent issue."
Convicted of Counterfeiting.
Stephr-n Rosenbaum. alia* "Pinkf-y,"
one of the notorious Ropers Kane of
counterfeiters, was convicted by a jury
Yesterday In United States District Judge
de Haven's court. . The charge was pass-
Ing counterfeit $5 pieces. The jury recom
m.nd.d the prisoner to the clemency of
the court. He will be sentenced next
Saturday. Rosenbaum was, one of the
gang tl^it passed the counterfeit money

ROBBERS CONFESS.
The Davis Brothers Will Throw
Themselves on the Mercy
of tr)e Court.
The coursp of justice will not be slow
with John N. Davis and Edgar L. Da
vis, hla brother, arrested recently f<Â»r
attempting to rob a stage on Christ
mas night near Willetts, In Mendo
clno County. Mounted on horseback
and disguised, they called upon the
driver to stop, but ho whipped up his
h>-rs.-s and escaped them, the robbers
firing five shots at him, fortunately
none of them taking effect
John N rode his horse into town at
full speed, and arrived there ahead of
tl\e stag. . This- was done in order to
establish an alibi, but it happened that
Miller, the driver, rt-eognized his voice
when he called upon him to stop the
staire. Ife communicated his suspicions
to Sheriff Stanley, and the Davis broth
ers were placed under arrest. After a
little waiting and when they found that
the Sheriff had a good case ngainst
them they confessed. They were taken
y sterday before United States Com
missioner Heacoek and identified, and
their cases will lie brought to the at
tention of the United States r.r.ind
Jury to-day, when they will be indict
ed.
The brothers will plead guilty of at
tempted stage robbery, and will throw
themselves upon the mercy of the
court.

Alexander Duncan, was taken with a

and was removed to the Harbor Receiv
ing Hospital, where be died almost Im

FATHER LAGAN BELIEVES
DURRANT WAS GUILTLESS
The Priest Says the Condemned Man,
Speaking in Friendship, Pro=
fessed Innocence.
Makes an Excuse for the Murderer if He Passed
Into Eternity With a Lie on
His Lips.
There Is a. peneral impression that
Purrant just before he stepped <>n the
trap of ih" scaffold confessed his suilt
of the Emmanuel Church murders to
Rev. Father Lagan, the Catholic priest
â¢who stood by him in his dyinÂ« hours.
If he did or if he did not the \v.>rld will
never know it- The reverend father
says Dorrant always protested his in
nocenre to him. and mako? an excuse
for him even if he died with a lie on
his lips. Futhrr Lagan tolls .>f his con
nection with the hanged man as fol
low s.:
â¢â¢I have grained more notoriety in thl?
case than 1 anticipated or thought of,"
said Father Lagan yesterday, "'and a
great dru.l more Than any priest ran
relish or desire. As a great many peo
ple do not Beetn to understand the un
expected conversion of Durrant to the
Catholic faith on the morning of his
death I will simply state the fans of
the cape and the matters that led up
to his conversion.
"I never saw Durrant until I met him
at Son Quentin. I never re:?d more
than three columns of the history of
hip case as it was published in the pa
pers. When he came to San Quentin
I called on him as I call on all the un
fortunates who are taken there, irre
spective of race or religion. ?.nd he re
ceived me kindly nnd told me of his
happy experiences with Father Jacquet,
who called on him frequently in the
County Jail in San Francisco. I called
occasionally nftÂ»-r that first meeting,
but we rarely talked of matters of re
ligion at our meetings.
"In the beginning: of our acquaint
ance we never discussed religious sub
jects. About nine months ago he told
me that he desired to have a Catholic
Bible, and he asked me to mark for him
the special passages that refer to the
great controversial questions between
the Catholics and the non-Catholics.
I grave him the Bible and pointed out
to him some of the principal passages
which he wished to study and investi
gate. I also gave him Cardinal Gib
bons' book of "Faith of Our Fathers."
and some other books explanatory of
the Catholic faith and practices. For
months afterward religion was not
mentioned between us. As Durrant's
confidence grew in me he became more
confidential and talked more freely on
various matters, particularly regard
ing his religious convictions. He com
plained of receiving unkind treatment
from his own ministers and clergymen
and I advised him to send for them and
have an understanding. I have never
yet asked any condemned man in San
Quentin to join the Catholic faith and
I would not make an exception with
Durrant. He asked me on a few oc
casions to explain the Catholic doctrine
of religious confession and sacramental
absolution. He inquired particularly
about our devotions to the Mother of
God and about purgatory and several
other questions of Catholic teaching. I
think I explained them to his satisfac
tion.
"During his occupation of the con
demned cell in November last I did not
visit him. After he returned to his
old cell in the main building I railed on
him and he asked me why I did not go
to see him at that time. I told him
he knew perfectly well the reason. If
I had prone t<> Bee him he might think
I was following him to convert him to
Catholicism. On that occasion he told
me he was thoroughly convinced of the
principal teaching of the Catholic
church and said: 'I cant become a
Catholic now. In my present position
I will be misrepresented and misunder
stood.' I said, 'Mr. Durrant, I have
never asked you to embrace the Catho
lic faith. If you are honest in your
present convictions you should follow
them to the logical end.' "
"I saw him again on the Sunday
after Christmas. The conversation
naturally turned to the same subject.
I advised him to read and pray for
God's guidance and direction. I saw
him again on the Wednesday before
his execution in the condemned cell.
Rev. Dr. Rader and Prison Chaplain
Drahms were just after visiting him.
He expressed sorrow that I did not
come earlier in the day. He said things
might have been different. I replied,
'Durrant, you are in good hands and
all right. If the worst comes, die like
a man in peace with God and the
world.'
"That was the last I saw of him un
til 1 was summoned on the morning of
the execution. 1 wont immediately to
San Quentin and discharged my duty
to the best of my ability i<> the unfor
tunate man. I stayed with him to the
last moment and stood over his hang
ing body till the doctors pronounced
life extinct.

protested his innocence to me.
"As to the reports of Durrant havinp
made a confession of the murders to
me during religious confession I have
nothing to say. A question asking me
if he did or not is one that I cannot
answer. No power on earth can com
pel a priest to diselosp anything heard
in sacramental confession. His lips
are sealed for or against his penitent.
Therefore I cannot answer such a
question. I can pay, however, that on
every occasion when he talked openly
to me as a man and a citizen and a
friend he protested his innocence, and
while in the beginning I was more or
less prejudiced against him I confess
that in the end he so gained my con
viction that 1 believed him thoroughly
innocent.
"Lately many people, and amonc
them prominent lawyers of San Ra
fael, told me that Durrant did not re
ceive the trial he should have had, and
that they would not bans him or any
other man under the circumstances by
which the dead man went to the scaf
fold.
"Purrant always treated me in a
most respectful and gentlemanly way.
I must say the same of Mr. Durrant.
the father, and also of Mrs. Durrant.
I will also publicly state that most of
the newspaper reports of the proceed
ings in the condemned cell were
REV. FATHER LAGAN, DURRANTS CONFESSOR.
grossly exaggerated or made out of
whole cloth. Durrant went to his
death with feelings of forgiveness in
his heart for all people, as he expect
ed and hoped for from his God. He
received the sacraments with a do
cility and the simplicity of a child,
and on his bended knees he told the
story of his life to his God and his
confessor.
"Now about the belief of some that
he died with a lie on his lips. He ever
proclaimed his innocence, and how
could I believe he died with a lie on
his lips? Some people exaggerate this
into the malice of a mortal sin that
would damn his soul. I do not take
that view of the case, and I think
many people who talk of him create a
greater sin against charity that he
did against truth, even admitting that
it wasalie. Remember, l do not justify
lying. Durrant injured no one by it.
even if he did tell a lie. He had no
blame for any person. He cast uo
suspicion on any one. He did not in
jure the State. The State and the
people got their pound of flesh and
made him atone for his crime if
guilty. I have already said tuo much
on this matter, and this will be my
last reference to it. Now that I have
spoken I think it best to give the
whole story as it is. Now that he is
dead I hope that a morbid public will
let his memory rest in peace."
WILL BE INCINERATED.
The Body of Durrant to Be
Shipped to Los Angeles.
The body of Theodore Durrant will
be sent to Los Angeles this afternoon
for cremation. Last night arrange
ments were made with the Southern
California Crematory Association for
the disposition of the remains of the
executed murderer. Porter Bros., the
undertakers who have charge of the
work of preparing the body for its re
turn to earth, were notified to arrange
the remains for shipment south, and
to-day early they will take all that is
left of the dead man from the residence
of the Durrants, on Fair Oaks street,
and place it In a metal-lined casket
and send it away on the afternoon
train. Mr. Durrant said yesterday that
he had a faint hope of the crematory
of the south accepting it. Late in the
afternoon a dispatch was received from
the managers of the Crematory Asso
ciation of the south that the body
would not be received by them, but a
few hours later another message was
received, saying that the body would
be cremated at Los Angeles, and it will
be sent on to-day.
On the receipt of the first message
from the south Mr. Durrant commenc-
THE SAX FRAXCTSCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 11, 1898.
Ed arrangements to dispose of the body
in the sea. He said he was afraid of
interring it in Holy Cross Cemetery on
account of vandals.
Will Not Stop With His Death.
Louis P. Hoardman. one of the coun
sel in the Durrant case, will remain in
Washington until Wednesday and then
leave for San Francisco via the South
ern route. He said to-night that al
though Durrant's attorneys had failed
to save him from the gallows, they
woul'l at least continue thfir efforts to
establish his inno< ence. and expressed
the opinion that there micht now be a
reaction of public sentiment, and that
his prosecutors might show a different
spirit. It is believed that Mr. Hoard
man and his associates will make a
thorough investigation of the alleged
confession of Rianther.
Mr. Hoardrnnn expressed indignation
When he read the report from San
Francisco that the erematorifs there
objected to ineerating Durrant's
remains. "I have a burial lot of my
own in San Francisco," said he. "and
the body can be buried there if his
parents wish it."

the property as he sees fit. The tes
tator directed that $4000 of his estate
be set aside from which his sister,
Mrs. F. liarron, might monthly
draw |200 until she had settled her
financial affairs. After that time when
she saw her way clear she might re
turn the money to Dr. Gallwey, but in
the will it was requested that no incon
venience should be caused her in the
repayment of the money. The will Is
dated December 26. 1^97. two days
prior to the death of the testator, and
shows that a hand trembling with dis
ease directed the pen that told the
wishes of the deceased.
On the face of the will it would ap
pear that Dr. Qallwey had been the
only party to be remembered to any ex
tent, but as the deceased had given
large amounts to various relatives pri
or t.i his death, \t is easily understood.
During; his lifetime Dr. Stanton had
oft<-n expreFPnd his belief that he would
rather leave the property as a gift than
to hay any one unnecessarily troubled
concerning the probate thereof.
SAYS DOW WAS MURDERED.
(\ Brother of the Dead Man Scouts
the Police Theory of
Suicide.
William Dow. the brother of John H.
Dow, who waÃ found dead in hia shoot
ins: gallery at 815 Kearny street on the
evening of the 2d instant, arrived here
from Nebraska City. Nebraska. Sun
day and is thoroughly convinced that
his brother was murdered. "Working
on this theory it is his intention to em
ploy r very means he can to ferret out
the guilty party and bring him to jus
tice.
"Jack," h-=> said, "was not the kind of
a man to think of killing himself, and
I don't believe he did. Some of his
friends here havf* told me that he was
despondent a short time before his
death, but I doubt this very much, as
he was a man who always looked on
the bright aide of everything.
"I believe that Jack had more money
th?n has been discovered so far. I
know that ho was paid in Ihe neighbor
hood of $80 only a few days before his
death, and this has not be^n accounted
tot ;it all. He had three rings and
nun" of these have been found, so if
the police want a motive work on the
robbery theory as a chutee shot.
"We had a letter from Jack about
two months ago and ho was in the
best of spirits then and evidently had
plenty of money, for ho said that if we
needed any he could help us out. 1
h:ive not seen the books kept by my
brothpr. but as soon as I look over them
I can tell whether he had been doing
any business, as I used to be with him
and knew his system of keeping his
accounts.
"When I was coming out here last
week I met a gentleman on the train,
whose name I do not care to give at
present, who told me that he had seen
the girl. Babe' Wilson, in the city but
a short timf before Jack was "sho-t
From this I doubt the report which has
been circulated that she is in China.
"I understand that the police force
think Jack's death was a case of sui
clde, but nothing can convince me that
he killed himself, and until the contra- i
ry is proved I will always believe that i
he was murdered. Believing as I do,
I intend to employ detectives to inves
tigate the matter, and will leave no
ptono unturned to find out the truth,
and if it was a murder I will f-ndeavor
to have the guilty one brought to jus
tice."

HIS NOSE
BROKEN BY A
POLICEMAN
Serious Charges Pre
ferred Against Offi
cer Crowley.
Accused of Brutally As
saulting W. Gillmore, a
Bookkeeper.
After the Beating He Is Thrown
in Prison on Two Misde
meanor Charges.
BOTH CASES DISMISSED.
Officer Peter Oillen Also Accused of 1
Similitr Misconduct by Charles
VVillinms.
W. IT. Gillmoro. a bookkeeper, vis
ited polico h-adnuaru-rs last night, and
preferred charges against Officer John
Crowley of the Seventei nth-street sta
tion.
According to GOlinore's story he was
walking along Howard street on New
Year's morning, accompanied by seve
ral friends. Meeting policeman Crow
ley, Gillmore, who is acquainted with
him, started to 'josh" him. For a re
ply Crowley, it is claimed, drew his
club and struck Gillmore across the
face, breaking his no.se- and discoloring
both his eyes. He then handcuffed
him and took him to the City Prison
where he was charged with vulgar lan
guage and disturbing the peace.
When the case was called next day
in Judge Joachimsen'fl court GUlmore
was discharged. In telling his itory
last night Giilmore declared that Crow
ley owed him money and as he re
fused to pay him he threatened to
bring him before the Commissioners.
"After learning of my intention," re
marked the injured bookkeeper, "he
told a friend that he would do me up
at the first opportunity. My friends
and 1 were walking along Howard
street, celebrating the advent "f the
New Year, when Crowlej appeared. He
ordered us to stop singing and when
1 made some flippant reply he drew
his clul), and with an oath struck me
across the face.
"Although partly dazed by the blow
I told him that the assault was wholly
unwarranted and asked him for an ex
planation. F< 1 a replj be seised me
by the throat and aft> : choking me he

wa.- then taken to the City Prison and
formally charged. After bearing '),.

termed his unseemiy conduct."
Gillmore sti!l bea:> 'he nurKs caused

hopelessly broken and a discoloration
under the left eye bears silent testi

he received. To-day he will formally
prefer charges against his assailant.
police;), an Peter Gillen of Captain
Wittman's division has been cited to
appear before the Police Commission
ers to-morrow night. Like Crowley he
is accused of breaking a mans nose
during a row. His victim is Charles
Williams of 1324 Pacific street.
Williams in his complaint, which was
filed yesterday, leclares that Gillen on
New Year's morning struck him with
his clfnehod fist, breaking his nose. He
then placed him under arrest for dis
turbing the peace. Desk Sergeant
Brown refus- '1 t<> receive him until his
nose was patched up, and he ordered
him taken to the Receiving Hospital.
To the Burgeon who Pressed his nose
Williams gave his name as Joseph Kel
ly. Ho waa afterward taken to the
city prison :;t!<l formally booked. The
following da) hifl case was heard by
Judge Conlan. and he was discharged
from custody.
The accused "fticor is th*Â» brother of
Captain Qlllen of the Seventeenth
street station md is held in high
esteem by his superior officers.
