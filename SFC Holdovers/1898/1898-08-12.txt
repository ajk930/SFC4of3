PROTOCOL

Cabinet.
Proclamation to Be Immediately
Issued for the Suspension of
Hostilities. â¢
NEW YORK, Aug. n.â The Herald's Washington corre
spondent sends the following: It's all over. Hostilities in the
.Spanish-American war will end to-morrow, when Secretary
Day and Embassador Cambon will attach their signatures to the
protocol already approved by the two countries, and an
armistice will be proclaimed by the people of the United States
and the Queen Regent of Spain, to endure until the final treaty
of peace is signed.
Embassador Camdon received a cablegram late this even
ing announcing Spain's approval of the protocol and directing
him as the diplomatic representative of Spain to attach his sig
, nature to the instrument. The ceremony of signing it will take
place in the diplomatic reception-room at the State Department
to-morrow morning-.
In addition to making public the terms of the protocol the
'President will immediately issue a formal proclamation setting
; -forth that, whereas Spain has accepted the terms of the peace
;. /negotiations proposed by the # United States, all military and
: ; : naval commanders are directed to suspend further operations
against Spain pending the work of the peace commissioners.
This armistice has already been prepared, thus furnishing
â¢ another evidence of the accuracy of the Herald's exclusive an
. .ncuncement of two days ago that Spain's reply was satisfac
-.- ton-, and that the war was at an end.
Although it has not been doubted for a moment since Em
â . bassador Cambon's call at the White House on Tuesday that
. . peace was certain, there was a feeling of relief among the offi-
: :cials of the administration to-night when word was received
: that Spain had authorized Embassador Cambon to sign the
. protocol. The authorities are all congratulating each other on
' the successful outcome of the peace negotiations, and particu
. larly upon the wonderful success of the American army and
. navy which has brought about this result.
The next step after signing the protocol and the issuance
Â of the proclamation of the President announcing an armistice
will be the appointment of five commissioners by each of the
two countries. It is definitely known that Secretary Day will
â¢ bead the American commissioners, and that the Minister of For
.. eign Affairs of Spain will head the Spanish commissioners. The
selection of the other American commissioners will be from
' among those whose names have already appeared in these dis
. patches. It is probable that the commissioners will not be an
â¢: riounced before Monday.
While Paris will be the first meeting place of the commis
, sion, it is not improbable that it may go to the Philippines.
The expectation is that it will conclude its work about
November I, and that an extra session of the Senate and the
; ' Spanish Cortes will be called to ratify the work of the commis
.-... sioners. *
â¢";.."':. After the protocol is signed to-morrow morning the full
â â¢ text will be given out for publication. It is comparatively brief,
â '.' considering the importance of the document, comprising less
than eight hundred words. I was told by a State Department
! official to-night who assisted in drafting it that it does not con
â  ' tain a single new feature that has not been fully covered by the
Herald. It is not the intention at present to make public the
. notes that have been exchanged between the two countries.
APPROVAL IS QUICKLY
GIVEN BY THE CABINET
â  . MADRID, Aug. 11 .âThe Government
has received th<- protocol, and the Cabi
n.et council rose at 9:40 p. m., -having
â  approved it. The Go>ernmcr.t will wire
M. Cambon to-night empowering him
to sign the prc-liminar^a of peace.
: i The day has been diplomatically one
of the busiest since the outbreak of
. the war. There have been no fewer
than two Cabinet councis, in addition
. to various diplomatic cor.f er e,, ceK .
Though the text of the protocol was
.not received until the evening was well
advanced, the Governmeit had been
made fully acquainted with its contents
through Paris.
"the matter was practically settled at
: the Cabinet meeting this afternoon, and
â the receipt of the actual locurncr.t.
therefore, only required a rreetinw of
. the Cabinet for a formal acceptance.

tlon of the original terms, but only new
suggestions.
They expect it will be signed at
Washington to-morrow (Friday), and
that a suspension of hostilities will be
announced.
Duke Almodovar de Rio, Minister of
Foreign Affairs, assured the corre
spondent of the Associated Press that
the negotiations for the peace treaty
will take place in Paris, but he says
the commissioners have not yet been
appointed.
The terms of the protocol will not be
published until the instrument has been
signed.

Spain. He said: "I fear the United
States are about to impose terribly se
vere and harsh terms upon Spain.
Every one in Spain wants peace, and
I don't believe any minister exists
strong enough to prolong the war, but
if the United States makes things bo
harsh as to utterly break Spain there
Is every possibility of a war of despair,
and it would be well that the United
States take this into consideration."
My informant, who is mentioned as
a possible member of the peace com
mission, said on this subject:
"Under the present conditions I
would not Join it if the appointment
were offered me. What does the com
mission mean? Nothing at all."
In another high official quarter I
found a sentiment prevailing that the
United States is pushing a very hard
bargain, and that if the Philippines
matter is made so, too. international
complications may follow.
According to the best authority of
fers of positions on the peace commis
sion will be made to Senors Moret,

INSTRUCTIONS FOR MILES
TO CEASE HOSTILITIES
NEW YORK, Aug. 11.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald tel
egraphs: As stated exclusively In the
Herald this morning, an order had been
prepared Instructing General Miles to
cease hostilities In Porto Rico. The
authorities were on the eve of sending
this order, a3 I am informed, but for
some reason did not do so. The text
of the order is of course withheld, but
I can confidently state that the admin
istration felt fully assured peace would
result from the present negotiations
and the intention of the President was
to inform General Miles.
Furthermore, Secretary Alger had
definitely determined to direct General
Miles to suspend hostilities and inform
the Spanish commander of his decision.
Had negotiations been ripe enough
this cable would have gone to General
Miles last night, but it is quite certain
from the activity to-day of the troops
in Porto liico that the dispatch did
not go. In fact, it can be almost cer
tainly stated It did not go. But the
moment the protocol will have been
signed a dispatch of this tenor will be
sent to General Miles.
Should the peace negotiations pro
gress as rapidly as they have prom
ised to during the past few days, it
Is not likely General Miles will be able
to forcibly occupy San Juan before the
signing of the protocol. In fact. It
looks as if the order to cease will be
sent to him before to-morrow night.
I can confidently state that no such
order was even prepared for General
Merritt, but it is not improbable that
it will be duplicated to him should the
protocol be signed to-morrow.
The city of Coamo, captured by Gen
eral Ernst's brl- ide, is about twenty
miles northeast of Ponce. This leaves
General Miles about sixty miles dis
tant from San Juan by the macada
mized road.
Sugar Imports for July.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 11.â The advance
statement of sugar imports, issued by the
JUiroau of Statistics, shows that the to
tal imports of dutiable sugar during July
were $5,249,070, as compared with ' 12.281,
287 for July, 1897. The amount of sugar
withdrawn for consumDtlon amounted
to $3,2i>6,545.

SANTIAGO, Cuba, Aug. 11.â General
Garcia, who, in anger, because this
city after its surrender was not turned
over to the Cubans, severed relations
with the United States army and
withdrew his troops, indicates a de
sire to reconsider his determination, in
a letter that was received to-day by
General Shafter. The letter is dated at
Gibara, August 5. It is in response to
a request made by General Miles on
July 19, when he was planning his ex
pedition to Porto Rico, that General
Garcia detail fifty Cubans from his
army to accompany the expedition as
guides and scouts.
In his reply General Garcia said that
as he understood General Miles had
already sailed, he supposed it would
be too late to comply with the request.
He stated, however, that he was will
ing to furnish the fifty men if they
still were wanted, and inclosed an or
der for them. A Cuban courier who
arrived to-day from Manzanillo states
that General Rabi with 5000 insurgents
is now before the town.
Lieutenant Miiey of General Shaf
ter's staff will go to Baracoa to-mor
row to receive the surrender of the
Spanish garrison there. He will go
alone on the steamer San Juan.
ATTACK ON MANILA
MAY HAVE COMMENCED
Monitor Monadnock, Which General
Merritt Awaited, Is About Due
at Cavite.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 11.â Inas
much as it haÃ been reported from Ca
vito that General Merritt was simply
awaiting the arrival there of the double
turre'ted monitor Monodnoek, it is pre
sumed the attack on Manila will soon
follow, if it has not been made already,
for according to the calculation of the
Navy Department, the Monadnock Is
about due now at Cavite. While not
quite clear as to General Merrltt's pur
pose in deferring his attack until the
vessel arrives, it is the opinion of the
military officials that his plan is to plant
the two monitors, the Monterey and the
Monadnock, directly within range of the
Manila batteries, and if a demand for
surrender is refused, to batter down
these defenses. Only fully armored ves
sels can be fiafely employed on such
work, hence the delay on account of the
non-arrival of the Monadnock.

COAMO, Porto Rico, Aug. 10, by Call-
Herald dispatch-boat to St. Thomas,
D. W. 1., Aug. 11.â General Miles'
troops are restingâ all save the en
gineers, who are repairing bridges on
the roads between here and Aibonito,
which Is the next point to be attacked
and where the Spaniards are waiting
in strong force to check the advance
on San Juan. Scouts have been sent
far out from the main body to locate
roads and paths leading to Aibonito
and find whether any of the enemy's
soldiers are between General Miles'
camp and the city.
Troop C of Brooklyn on Tuesday
pushed forward to within three miles of
Aibonito. It was discovered by Span
ish outposts and were fired on by the
enemy's artillery, which is in fortifica
tions on a high hill that enables them
to cover the military road. ThÂ» Amer
ican troopers replied to the n"iv\ but
they were too far away to be effective,
and had nothing but rifles. There was
a sharp skirmish with the Spanish out
posts. None of the Brooklyn soldiers
were wounded. Troop C now forms the
extreme advance of General Miles'
army.
Corporal Barnes, who was severely
wounded in the fighting at Coamo, is
now out of danger. The other men
who were wounded are doing 1 well.
SPANIARDS ROUTED

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SHANGHAI, Aug. 12.â A dis
patch from Peking dated to-day
says that an imperial edict has
finally issued, sanctioning the
Belgian- loan for the construc
tion of the railway line from Pe
king to Hankau, despite the pro
tests of Sir Claude Macdonald,
the British Minister.
LONDON, Aug. 11.â In the House of
Commons to-day Mr. A. J. Balfour,
first lord of the treasury and Govern
ment leader, admitted that the state
ments in the Peking dispatch to the
London Times to-day were substan
tially correct, and said that the matter
was "engaging the serious attention t-t
the Government." This statement waÂ»
received with cheers. The correspond
ent of the Times cabled that the Tsung
Li Yamen had given formal assent to
all the conditions demanded by the
Russian Charge d'Affaires regarding
the contract for the Niu Chang Rail
road extension loan, these conditions
being in direct conflict with the terms
of the signed contract and designed
as a blow at British concessions.
The Peking correspondent of the
Times says: "Baron de Vinck, the
Belgian Minister, yesterday sent a dis
patch to the Tsung Li Yamen, assert
ing that M. Pavloff, the Russian Charge
d' Affaires, and M. Gerard, the French
Minister, had joined him in urging the
Tsung Li Yamen to disregard the at
tempt of the British Minister, Sir
Claud Macdonald, to prevent the rati
fication of the Peking-Hankau con
tract.
"It is confidently asserted that, de
spite the British endeavor to obtain a
revision of the contract, an imperial de
cree will issue forthwith for its rati
fication. The unfriendly role of he
Belgian Minister throughout merits the
strongest condemnation."

Steam Launch.
LOST A MAN TAKING A PRIZE
ATTACKED FROM THE SHORE
BY SPANIARDS.
Fierce Fighting on the South Coast
of Pinar del Rio, in Which the
Enemy Was Badly
Punished.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KEY "WEST, Aug. 11.â One more
name has been added to the small list
of tin- navy's war victims. Emanuel
Koulouria, a coal passer on the gun
boat Bancroft, was shot and instantly
killed during a sharp engager.. -nt with
Spanish riflemen at a point of land
jutting out into Cortis Bay, on the
south coast of Pinar del Rio, on August
2. It is not known how many Span
iards' lives paid for his, but the Span
ish loss was undoubtedly severe.
The Bancroft was cruising about Cor
tis Hay on blockade duty when a sail
was seen close to the land and about
ten miles to the northward. The gun
boat's steam launch was armed with a
. >under and .Lieutenant Henry B.
Wilson, with fourteen men, all carry
ing ritles, was sent in to intercept the
stranger. She turned put to be a Span
ish schooner. When fust observed the
Spaniard lay near the wreck of the
Santo I>omingo, recently sunk by the
Eagle. By the time the steam launch
reached that point the schooner had
worked into a port and a party .if
Spaniards, including a body of soldiers,
was attempting to haul her ashore.
The launch stood boldly In and a brisk
fire from her one-pounder speedily
scattered the crowd. The Spaniards
took refuge in high grass on the right
shore, but in spite of the fact that the
men in the launch were ignorant of the
enemy's strength the Americans went
ahead with their work with admirable
coolness.
James Munroe, a first-class appren
tice, swam to the schooner and made
a line fast to her In order to pull her
out. At the same time Valdemar
Hohengren, an ordinary seaman,
dropped over the side of the launch and
a pier, where a small sloop
â i boat was moored. The launch
then commenced to haul off the schoon
er, but the- line parted, and while an
other wa.; being run to her the Span
iards, who had sought shelter in the
woods, poured in a murderous ritle ftre.
Koulourie, who was leaning over the
side of the launch, was shot thr.o-ugh
the breast and fell dead. Furtunately
no one else was even injured.
Instantly the men in the launches be
gan a rapid return of the tire wi,th
their rities, while Lieutenant Wilson
maneuvered the launch so as to take a
line thrown by Hohengren from the
small boat, which he had shoved off
from the pier. Her bow was pulled out
and the one-pounder was opened on the
ambuscade with such a well directed
aim that the Spaniards were routed
without a chance to return the Ameri
can fire. The schooner had in the
meantime gone hard aground and be
ing so damaged as to be almost use
less enough shells were sent into her
to finish her destruction. She was load
ed with green corn, grain and rum.
Commander Clover warmly praised
the gallantry of the launch party, the
members of which did not falter under
heavy fire, but directed all Us energies
to rescuing Hohengren, who, alone on
the wharf, was in a perilous situation.
Koulourie was buried at sea the same
afternoon.
The next morning the Bancroft
started for Sigunea Bay. where the
gunboat Maple had gone to blockade
and sound out a passage. On August
4 Commander Clover, who was senior
officer there, transferred his flag to the
Maple while the Bancroft's boilers
were undergoing repairs. He took the
launch with him under Ensign Vogel
sang, still armed with her one-pounder.
They proceeded to the northwest ex
tremity of the Isle of Pines and there
naw a sloop and a large schooner
anchored in shore. The launch went in
after them, but as soon as she was ob
served approaching the crew of the
Spanish vessel took to their small
boats. The sloop was aground and to
ward this vessel Ensign Vogelsang
headed the launch. As the latter drew
near to the sloor> a party of Spaniards
on shore opened fire on the Americans.
Then the launch's one-pounder again
opened on the enemy, but before she
bad rired many shells the Maple opened
with her six-pounder ai:d swept the
brush-lined beach. While the dense
foliage aphorp gave the enemy a de
cided advantage no Americans were
hit, but it is safe to say that undor
the Maple' 3 heavy fire a large number
of Spaniards were killed or wounded.
The sloop turned out to be a trading
vessel with no cargo on board and not
worth the trouble of sending to an
American port. A few shots from the
Maple put her under water.
The schooner, however, proved to bf>
of value. She was the Carmita, loaded
with wood and charcoal. She was
hauled out and anchored until the next
morning, when the Maple, towing the
schooner and launch, resumed her jour
ney to Sigunea Bay.

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 12, 1808.
PLANNING FORMS
OF GOVERNMENT
New Possessions Under
Consideration.
PORTO RICO AN EASY TASK
BUT CUBA REQUIRES SERIOUS
THOUGHT.
President and Cabinet Carefully Dis
cuss the Situation â Many Com
plex Questions to Be
Handled.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 11.â Plans for
the temporary government of Cuba and
the territory which will be acquired
from Spain as a result of the war are
now under serious consideration by the
President and members of the Cabinet.
Porto Rico, as an actual acquisition to
the territory of the United states, will
be placed in charge of a military gov
ernor \\h> will exercise a supervisory
control of all the functi overn
ment, under the direction of the Pres
ident, until Congress shall determine
upon a permanent form of government
for the island. The President under
the constitution has no authority to no
beyond this preliminary or temporary
stage of the establishment of any sys
tem of governmental control, ami. al
though it is altogether probable that in
his message to Congress on the sub
ject h<_- will exercise his constitutional
privilege of making recommendations,
upon Congress alone will devolve the
responsibility and duty of determining
the character of the political relations
which Porto Rico shall permanently
bear to the United States.
There are reasons why the President
himself favors a colonial form of gov
ernment,'-, and this, view is shared
by members of the Cabinet. Canada
is noted as being a model colonial Gov
ernment, satisfactorily alike to the
majority of its people and to the
â mother country. This system, how
ever, it fa believed, can be put into ope
ration only after the lapse of a con
siderable period, and after the people
have demonstrated satisfactorily their
ability to govern themselves intelli
gently in all local matters.
Upon the evacuation of Cuba it is
believed to be the intention of the Pres
ident, to establish for the whole island
a temporary military government, sim
ilar to that now in operation at San
tiago. When order has been fully re
stored' and the people have, settled
down to their peaceful occupations, it
is Iteved to be the view of the Pres
ident that a convention of the repre
sentatives of the people should be sailed
to vote on the question of a form of
government for the island. The pres
ence of the army of. the United States
would be a guarantee that every citi
zen who would subscribe to an oath,
hi. ing himself to support whatever
form of government that would be de
cided upon, should have the unques
tionable right to vote for whoever he
pleases to. represent him at. this . con
vention. .The action! of : , this,, body
would', however, have to be submitted
to the United States for approval or
disapproval. .
It is pointed out that this convention
of representatives of the whole people
in the free exercise of their choice
might express a wish to become a co
lonial dependency of- the United States,
or might favor a republican form of
government, or possibly a majority
might ask to be annexed to the United
States. . In any of these' contlngi
it is .believed that their wjsh would
meet the approval of the President. and
his advisers. ' * .*;

WHAT IT COST
TO WHIP SPAIN
Uncle Sam'l Must Pay
for His Fun.
NEARLY A MILLION A DAY
EXPENDITURES WILL NOT END
WITH PEACE.
For Some Time to Come the Ameri
can Army and Navy Must Be
Maintained on Their
Present Footing.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 11.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Peace
Is now assured and Uncle Sam, who, in
equipping fleets and armies, and send
ing- them against the foe, has plunged
his hands deep into his strong box,
spending money without stint, can sit
down and figure out what it h;^ all
cost. It may be many months before
the money cost of the war will be fig
ured up even approximately. Should
the army and navy be reduced to :i
peace footing to-morrow, there would
still be many millions paid out for odds
and ends of all kinds and on contracts
which have been entered into.
But the army and navy cannot yet be
reduced. Both must be kept on a Avar
footing until the finaJ treaty of peace
has been ratified and until means are
provided for maintaining order in Cuba,
Porto Rico and the Philippines. All
this means that expenditures are still
to go on for many months at almost
the same rate as if actual hostilities
were in progress.
Only a rough estimate can be made
of the amount of money that the war
has cost up to the present time. Actual
payments made up to date on account
of the war, as nearly as they can be
estimated by treasury officials, foot up
about $U5. 000,000. Of the total expendi
tures thus far about $61,000,000 has been
paid out on account of the army, and
about $34,000,000 on account of the navy.
As the war has existed since April 21,
or 113 days, the average daily expendi
ture a have been about $840,700.
During the month of July the average
war expenditures were about $1,000,000
a Say, and this average is being kept
up during August.
When the total coat of the war crimes
to be figured up and divided by the
number of days hostilities were actual
ly in progress it is probable the r.sult
will show the daily cost has been fully
$1,500,000.
TRADES PLANNED
BY GAGE'S MEN
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 11.â There was
a noticeable scarcity of petty politi
cians in and about the Hollenbeck. the
Hatters of Henry T. Ga^e, to-day.
Many of them had returned to their
respective districts fully instructed re
. ;,h. selection of delegates to be
voted far at the primaries to be held
throughout the county next Monday,
and there is no doubt about the carry
ing out of the programme as pre] ared
by the managers of the local candidate
for <;nvniior. The interest o-f every
other candidate for office is being: made
ndary consideration, and the plan
of the Gage forces is to make any com
bination possible to insure his nomina
tion at Sacramento.
Trades are freely spoken of by men
who arc ctede to the aspirant for gu
bernatorial honors, and some are bold
enough to assert that if Â£.ou Brown
will keep out of the light for Governor
he can have the vote of the Gage forces
for a renomi nation for Secretary of
Realizing the weakness of the ticket
headed by a man from the south, they
are looking toward San Francisco for
help. Tirey L. Ford has been sug
i as the most available candidate
to strengthen the ticket, and the Gage
d- legates will be for Ford if he can be
Induced to throw his strength in the
ntion in the right direction.
The Young Business Men's Republi
can Chub of this city opened the cam
paign to-night by giving a reception to
the various Republican candidates, and
Music Hall was crowded to overflowing
by enthusiastic Republicans. Frank
Davis presided and addresses were de
livered by Truman Reeves of San
Bernardino, Judge Work and State
Superintendent Of Public Instruction S.
T. Black.
STOCKTON DOWNS BUDD MEN.
Harbor Commission Employes Shut

STOCKTON, Aug. 11.â As predicted

ployes of the Harbor Commission, James
Byrnfts and John Fox, who came up here

beaten out at the preliminary meeting
lasl night, and when two of the San
li uihihco men pot in then the boys, who
:iic solidly for Maguire, declared they
would do up the outsiders to-day, and
they did. The winners say they will send
Magulre delegates to the State conven
tion. Two local men who were believed
to be with the Budd men from the Har
bor Commission were also defeated.

GREATER HONOR IN
STORE FOR DEWEY
Grade of Admiral May
Be Created.
HE WOULD GET THE PLACE
HIS EEWABD HAS NOT YET BEEN
SUFFICIENT.
Was Advanced Only Two Numbers
for His Victory, While Samp
son Went Forward Eight
Numbers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 11.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Elerald
telegraphs: There is a strong feellnfa
in Washington that Rear Admiral
Dewey should receive a greater reward
than has been accorded him, and there
is a strong probabilty that the Presi
dent in his message to Congress will
urge the revival of the grade of vice
admiral, and that Rear Admiral Dewey
be appointed to the office when it au
thorized by law.
For his victory in Manila Bay Dewey
has advanced only two numbers while
Rear Admiral Sampson has been ad
vanced eight numbers, and liear Ad
miral Schley six for the fight off San
tiago. If the grade of vice-admiral had
existed eight numbers would have ad
vanced Rear Admiral Dewey to that
rank.
Naval officers generally hope that not
only will the grade of vice-admiral be
revived, but that Congress will i
the grade of admiral. It' this is done,
Admiral Dewey would naturally
be appointed to fill it, not only because
of the part he played in the battle of
Manila Bay, but because of his treat
ment of the vexing questions which
have :iri:-Â«-n since his victory.
What officer will be designated to fill
the grade of vice-admiral if the higher
rank were revived, cannot be authori
tatively stated, but the adminlstr
would undoubtedly select Rear Admiral
Sampson while the friends of Rear Ad
miral Schley would urge his appoint
ment. In any event, as soon as Con
gress convenes there will be a bitter
controversy In the Senate and House
. n the friends of the two officers
as to which is entitled to the credit for
the victory off Santiago.
KILLED AT MANILA
BY SHARPSHOOTERS
Dr. John Barron of Coketown, Pa.,
Receives a Cablegram Telling
of His Brother's Fate.
NEW YORK, Aug. 11.â A Pittsburg
special to the Herald says: Dr. John
Barron of Coketown, Westmoreland
County, to-day received a cablegram
from Manila announcing the death of
his brother, Professor George Barron,
principal of the Llgonler Public Schools.
Professor Barren was first sergeant of
Company E, Tenth Pennsylvania Vol
unteers. The cablegram merely stated
that he had been killed by sharpshoot
ers. As the name did not appear in the
official list of killed and wounded in the
battle of Malate sent by General M"er
ritt to the War Department it is
thought Professor Barron was killed
after the battle. ' Citizens of Mount
Pleasant are talking of erecting a mon
ument to the memory of members of
Company E who fell at Malate.

SUMMERLAND OIL
MEN UP IN ARMS
Southern Pacific Rob
bery Resisted.
RIPARIAN OWNERS AROUSED
BRAZEN ATTEMPT TO DRAIN
THEIR WELLS.
Company Builds a "Wharf to Bore
Into the Ocean Bed and Angry
Citizens Chop Down the
Piles.
BANTA BARBARA, Aug. 11.â The
whole town of Summerland, five miles
east of Santa Barbara, is under arms,
ready to protect its interests against
Southern Pacinc encroachments. For
three days a number of armed men
have been employed chopping down
piles and otherwise destroying South
ern Pacinc property, and as yet they
have met with no resistance from the
company.
For some time post it has been
known that the oil wells drew their
supply from the rocks or ledge dipping
at a well-defined angle. Lately it was
shown by actual experience and tests
that the real reservoir bottom was
some little distance below low-water
mark, and to reach it one must go even
out into the waves to bore. It was also
known that a well out in the waves
would soon exhaust these inland wells.
This is what has caused the fight be
tween the riparian owners and the
Southern Pacinc Company.
J. B. Treadwell, a mining expert, who
has openly asserted that he is working
under the Southern Pacinc Company's
instruction, obtained a wharf franchise
from the Board of Supervisors of Santa
Barbara County and has run a wharf
out 400 feet into the ocean, which he
claimed was for the shipment of oil by
steamer and also to ship or land other
commodities for the town of Summer
land. It now develops that this wharf
is solely to be used as a platform for
drilling oil wells and also as a means to
enable the Southern Pacific Company
to get control of the rich oil fields.
Treadwell has run out arms parallel
to the coast from the end of the wharf,
about low-water mark, and threatens
to extend thpni along the whole front
of Summerland. a distance of 2000 feet,
thereby cutting off all the riparian
owners from tidewater facilities, with
the intention of boring wells which
riparian owners claim will drain their
wells. This will also enable the South
ern Pacific Company to run their road
in a straight line, saving many sharp
curves and grades. If they are suc
cessful Summerland will be at their
mercy and they will secure all the oil
necessary for this division of their
road.
Treadwell left to-day for San Fran
cisco, and it Is supposed from remarks j
he made that he has gone for the pur
pose of securing the aid of the Attor
ney General to enable him to run over i
State lands below high-water mark.
This is regarded here as the most
brazen attempt at seizure of property
without compensation evpr attempted j
by any corporation. The owners of
property on the beach have men con- j
tlnually on the nrnvp resisting Tread
well's attempt to build his barrier in
front of thpm. Treadwell'B pile-driver,
which has been used for building plat
forms for oil wells on the arm of the
main wharf, stands this evening a soli
tary monument In the ocean, the piles
having been chopped down between it
and his wharf by the riparian owners.
Among the riparian owners are
Thomas B. Wood, son of the Iron King
of Pennsylvania, who has unlimited
capital behind him, and William M. S
Moore, an Eastern capitalist, who has
invested $16,000 already. which if
Treadwell and the Southern Pacific are
Buccessful will be n Jr.ss to him. Charles
Newman, H. L. Williams and A. Hope
Doeg are others who are interested and
have much capital invested.

Los Angeles Also Suffers, but the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Aug. 11.â The weather ob
server said it was 113 degrees in Fres
no to-day, but there is an impression
hereabouts that he keeps his thermom
eter on ice. Though the mercury has
been up to 114 twice this season, the
heat to-day was felt more than on
either of those occasions. This was
probably due to a [greater degree of
humidity. While tnere was consider
able suffering from the heat, there
were no prostrations â at least none
have been reported. The heat is said
to have been even greater in Aladera
and Merced than here.
STOCKTON, Aug. 11.â This has been
the hottest day of the year, and ther
mometers held up their hands until
close to sundown, when It began to
moderate somewhat. The highest re
corded here was 108 degrees, though
there are reports of other glasses
somewhat higher. Reports from near
by towns were as follows: Lathrop,
109; Elliott, 113; Farmington, 115 and
122; Clements, 115; Woodbridge, 105;
Bellota, 115, and Ripon, 112.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 11.â This was
the hottest day ever experienced in
Sacramento since it was settled by
Americans, at least of which there is
axiy record. For two hours the mercury
stood at the 110 mark. Nobody has
suffered, however, and men and horses
were about their work as usual. In
deed, the average estimate of the heat
was about 100 degrees. To-night there
is a comfortable breeze from the south,
and a change in the temperature is
looked for.
It is feared that the hot wave has
injured grapes in vineyards not irri
gated, as the fruit is less protected by
the foliage of the vines, owing to the
ilry season. Irrigated vines have heavy
foliage, which Drotects the grapes.
TRACY, Aug. 11.â To-day has bwn
the hottest of the season, the ther

LOS ANGELES, Aug. 11.â The high
est temperature in this city for the
present month was experienced yester
day and to-day, the maximum temper
ature reaching 91 degrees. The heat
was extremely oppressive, owing to
the humidity. The heat will have the
effect of hastening the ripening of
peaches, pears, plums, grapes, etc.,
and owing to the extreme moisture in
the atmosphere the fruit will In no
way be injured.
IMPALED UPON A
JUNK'S BOWSPRIT
Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C. Aug. 11.â The
steamer Victoria, which arrived this
evening from Yokohama after a swift
though stormy passage, brings news
of a frightful accident in Yokohama
harbor, whereby two lady missionaries
of the American Mission Board. Mieses
Simmons and Allen, lost their lives.
The two ladies had a number of friends
wh<> were journeying to this side of the
Pacific by the R. M. R. Empress of Ja
pan, and they went out in the launch
belonging to the Canadian Pacific
Steamship Company to see them off.
The grood-bys being said, the two la
dies were going ashore in the launch
when a junk which was sailing into the
harbor running swiftly before the wind
collided with the launch. The Junk's
bowsprit was driven against Miss Sim
ons with terrific force. It struck her
in the abdomen and impaled her, kill
ing her instantly. Her companion. Miss
Allen, was .struck about the shoulders
and head by the unwieldy bow of the
Chinese vessel and she was terribly
cut and lacerated. She lingered in
pain for the greater part of a day in
the Yokohama hospital and died on
July 30, a few hours before the Vic
toria sailed.
Both ladies were well known in mis
sionary circles, they having been work
ing in Japan for a number of years.
Miss Simmons shortly before the tragic
occurrence had applied for and ob
tained a furlough. She was to have
come here en route to the United
States by the next Empress steamer.

New Line Backed by the Great North

York Have Been
Fixed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Aug. 11.â Arrangements
have been made to place the steamer
city of Columbia an the route between
Seattle and Hawaii on a twenty-five
day Bchedule, beginning August 25. The
company that will operate this steamer
is known as the Seattle-Honolulu Steam
ship Line. The owners are the Scandi
navian-American Bank of Seattle, rep
resented by John P. Jacobson and Cap
tain Russell Co-legrove of Washington
City.
It was practically decided to establish
this line cm Saturday last after a con
ference between Captain Colegrove and
President James J. Hill of the Great
Northern Railroad, he being in the city
at that time. All the prestige of the
railroad company will be exerted In
behalf of the new line.
The straight through passenger fare
from Xew York to Honolulu, via Seat
tle, has been fixed at $100 for first class
and $G2 seccmd class. The fare from
Seattle to Honolulu on the City of Co
lumbia will be as follows: $75 first
class, $37 second class and $25 deck
passage.
The company has assurance from the
Postofflce Department that a mail con
tract will be entered into. It is further
contemplated securing a sister ship, so
as to make the run between Seattle and
Honolulu every twelve days. Although
only announced this morning by even
ing the new line had its cargo and pas
senger list filled for the first trip.
The City of Columbia was brought
around the Horn from New York to go
on the St. Michael run. Accidents and
bad management resulted in tying up
the steamer shortly after arriving in
this port. She was recently ordered
sc-ld and went for $40,000. being bought
in by Captain Colegrove. Since then
$30,000 has been expended in repairs
and she is now rated by Lloyds' agent
as Al for five years.

SAVES SKAGUAY
Special Dispatch to The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Aug. 6. by steam
ship City of Topeka to Port Townsfnd,
Wash., Aug. 11. â Skaguay has not been
wlmlly consumed, thanks to the wind

yon after the fire started last Thurs
day afternoon, instead of chansriner to
down the canyon. The loss is confined
the extent first stated â between
twenty and thirty small frame houses
and log cabins which bordered on the
trail beyond Twelfth street. The stead
fastness of the wind to the one direc
!iciii of safety is the only thing that
saved the city.
No additional particulars as to the
amount of damage or Insurance have
been received. No small steamer ha.s
arrived from the head of Lynn Canal
with any fresh particulars, and the
Topeka, which had just arrived from
Sitka, left Skaguay Thursday after
noon, four hours before the fire broke
out. The powder house of the railway
company is reported to have cauÂ«ht
fire and exploded, but the bridjre over
the river, the switch tower and the
frame round house were saved. No
lives are known to have been lost.
Twenty-five deaths have occurred In

KIRKLAND HAS A
FIGHTING CHANGE
Dr. Taylor Is Hopeful of
His Recovery.
SUFFERING FROM WEAKNESS
ORIGINAL TROUBLE HAS BEEN
OVERCOME.
Some Difficulty Experienced in Drain
ing the Wound Made by the
Surgeon's Knife â Still
ness at the Yard.
VAT,T,E.TO, Aug. 11.â The condition of
Admiral Kirkland still continues favor
able, though he had a severe attack of
weakness this morning. His symptoms
were so unfavorable that Dr. Taylor
was summoned by wire from San Fran
cisco, arriving about noon. The trouble
in the patient's abdomen and the in
cision made by the surgeon's knife
caused no uneasiness, as both were do
ing as well as could be expected. The
admiral was very weak, however, and
was unable to raise the mucus forming
in his lungs and congestion was begin
ning to develop. This trouble was ob
viated by an injection of hydrogen, and
during the afternoon his condition was
reported greatly improved. Some
trouble is experienced in draining the
wound caused by the operation, as the
patient is not able to sit up. but it Is
not believed that this will have any
lasting effect.
Dr. Taylor returned to San Francisco
this afternoon, leaving Dr. J. R. Wag
goner and Dr. C. T. Hibbett in charge
of the case, one of them being within
call at all times. Dr. Taylor told The
Call representative that the original
trouble in the patient's abdomen was
responding to treatment, the difficulty
this morning being caused by conges
tion of the lungs. He stated that the
patient has a good fighting chance of
recovery.
Commander J. J. Brice, who was re
called from the retired list during the
continuation of hostilities with Spain,
Is in command of the yard during Ad
miral Kirkland's illness. Everything
about the yard is kept as quiet as pos
sible, so that the admiral will not be
disturbed. The prolonged ringing nf
the bell calling men to work has been
stopped, a few taps sufficing for the
purpose.
POSTMASTER HOBSON.
Popular Appointment Made by the
President.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 11.â The Presi
dent to-day appointed Judge J. M. Hob*
son. father of Lieutenant Hobson of Mer
rimac fame, postmaster at Greensboro,
Ala. Mr. Hobson Is a Democrat, and the

Freeport's Postmaster Arrested.
SACRAMENTO. Aug. 11.â Deputy Unit
ed States Marshal Henry M. Moffitt of
San Francisco to-day arrested Philip G.
Riehl, the Freoport Postmaster, who had
been indicted by the United States Grand
Jury for alleged diversion to his own use
of $340 of Government funds. Riehl de
nies that he has used public funds. He
has been Postmaster for the little ham
let of Freeport for many years, and the
sum alleged to have been misappropriated
would seeem to cover the entire receipts
of the poatofflce for a very lone time.
MAYOR ARCHER KNEW
LITTLE OF MRS. ORR
Made the Woman's Acquaintance
Through a Correspondence
Bureau.
CALDWELL, Ohio. Au<r. 11.â Mayor
Arthur < ). Archer to-day mr. .Ie the follow
ing statement regarding the Orr affair at
Clarendon, Ark. :
"I have had some correspondence with
Lorllla I-\ Weaver, whose name I secured
through a correspondence bureau of Cin
cinnati. She represents herself to be a
French lady of wealth and leisure, and I
never heard of infname orr until I saw
It in the press in connection wth the ter
rible tragedy at Clarendon, and I am
dumfouiitiod that my name was connect
ed with it in any way. The manner In
which the correspondence began is this:
" "A Dumber of young men were in my
office one evening, ana one of them had a
circular from a correspondence bureau,
and it was sti"~ested that for the fun of
the thing a correspondence be opened up
with some one. A letter was written to
the bureau, and the name of and descrip
tion of the person representing herself to
be Lorilln F. Weaver was secured In this
way. which information I now have in my
possession, together with all letters re
ceived from her. three in number. Your
correspondent has read these letters, and
there is nothing in them suggestive of
any wrongdoings in any way. and they
appear to have been written by a lady
of education and refinement.' "
The unenviable notoriety is very em
barrassing to Mayor Archer and his
friends.

MAIL SERVICE THROUGH
THE YUKON COUNTRY
Magnitude of the Contract Which a
Seattle Man Has Undertaken
to Carry Out.
WASHINGTON, Aug. il.â The Post
office Department has not re
ceived reports on its newly established
mall routes in Alaska, but is not sur
prised that advices have not come. The
contract is with P. C. Richardson of
Seattle, and the service did not begin
until July 1. It will be seen, there
fore, that a report on the service could
scarcely be expected so soon. The con
tract provides for two round trips a
month from Juneau over the Chilkoot
Pass to Dawson and Circle City, and
thence down the Yukon to Waare City,
at the junction of the Tukon and To
nana rivers. From Weare City down
the Yukon to St. Michael a monthly
service only is required. It is pre
sumed the contractor began the ser
vice simultaneously from St. Michael
and Juneau, so that a monthly mail will
be carried from St. Michael up to
Weare City. Thence the service up
the Yukon to Circle City and Dawson
and down to Juneau is to be bi-month
ly. Nothing but letters and light
packages are to be handled, the con
tractor agreeing to provide dog trains
and reindeer and such other methods
of transportation as the exigencies may
require for pood service. He is also
required to establish intermediate sta
tions. The contract is made for four
years and costs annually $78,000.
It is likely a report on this service
is coming by mail, but should the Post
office Department find that the mails
are not being properly carried a tem
porary service will be â¢ut on to ac
commodate the people along these 2500
miles.
Inspector Clum of the fourth assist
ant's office has recently returned from
Alaska, where he arranged for the es
tablishment of seven postal stations
along the Yukon. In addition to this
service the Postottice Department has
a contract for four trips by steamer
during the summer months, from Ju
neau to St. Michael and thence to
Weare City. Newspapers and other
heavier mall matter are to be carried
by Bteamer.
An idea of the proportions of this
service may be had from the fact that
the contract provided for a ton and a
half of mail matter on each trip,
whereas the first steamer to St. Mi
chael carried three and a quarter tons.

BAD SPILL AT THE
NATIONAL MEET
Four Cyclists Go Down
in a Heap.
GARDINER BADLY BRUISED
KNOCKED OUT OF THE GREAT
AMERICAN HANDICAP.
Continued Record-Breaking and Sen
sational Finishes Mark the
Second Day of the
Racing.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
INDIANAPOLIS, Aug. 11.â More
record breaking and more sensational
finishes marked the second day of the
national meet of the League of Ameri
can Wheelmen. One serious accident
knocked Arthur Gardiner out of the
final of the Great American 51000
handicap race, and nearly placed
plucky "Bill" Martin hors de combat.
This happened at the close of the sec
ond heat of the contest. Martin was
at the front of the bunch and appar
ently a winner, when he slipped over
the pole and slid along the track. Gar
diner went over him, Ed Stevens fol
lowed and then Lou Coburn went down
in the heap. Cooper and Me Far land
were In the finish, but escaped from a
spill, Cooper dismounting from his
wheel, as white as the wheel itself.
Gardiner could not ride in the great
final, but Martin did ride to show his
pluck. From sixty yards he gained
fourth, leading the back bunch over the
tape.
Bald, Freeman, Becker and Cooper
followed Martin, who took hia hands
off the bars and sat up to relieve his
poor strained back as he made his
finish. After circling the track part
way he dismounted, for he could ride
no further. Martin was the hero of the
meet, for he came out to ride as badly
a cut up and jarred man as has been
seen on the track this year.
Fred Costello, the St. Louis ama
teur, who qualified to-day for the great
live-mile amateur championship, took
the handicap, with Maya of Erie, sec
ond, and L. R. Hall, Philadelphia,
third. This same trio maÂ»Â»jhe hack
mark men look foolish in their third
heat by working together.
Owing to the withdrawal of Gardi
ner, Bald went from scratch alone, his
great rival, Cooper, having twenty
yards. The race was a pretty one, hut
the generosity of the handicapper to
ward the ex-amateur, who has beaten
Peabody, in giving him 250 yards, en
abled the limit ln-^n to prevail and to
prevent the back men closing in the
time they had cut out. TJald finished
fifth in 4:09, a new handicap record by
nine and four-fifths seconds. He broke
it also in the heat, doing It in 4:15 2-5
very handily. The new rule allowing
handicap records in a class by them-
Belves Is the explanation of why these
urii handicap records.
Gardiner and Martin were not the
only big men to fall, as Collett, the New
Haven amateur, fell in the five-mile
championship through the foul riding
of C. S. Porter, the Detroit amateur.
Porter was disqualified for the meet
and censured by the chairman. <'<>!
lett, however, took the quarter-mile
championship, his third win in the
championship contests, and with his
partner he made It four by cleverly
winning the handicap championship for
tandem teams at the mile distance.
Earl \V. Peabody, the Chicago amateur,
took the five-mile championship by a
good clean-cut win, and Ertz and
Kraemer followed him across the tape.
It was the Eddie Bald of old that
shot into the lead in the final of the
half-mile national championship, his
first win of a championship race at a
national meet since 1895, the start of
his career. Gardiner claimed to have
been crowded over the pole by MeFar
land, who took necond to Bald, with
Freeman third and Cooper fourth, and
protested the Californian to the chair
man of the racing board. The protest
was not allowed.
As a close to the great day of sport,
Harry Gibson did a mile, paced, in
1:45 3-5, the quarter in :26 2-5. half in
:53 2-5, and the three-quarters In
1:19 3-5. He was paced poorly by a
triplet and a quad.

IS READ TO
HIS CHILDREN
The "Heights" and Magnificent
Library Are Not Bequeathed
to the City.
Mrs. Kluge, the Alleged Widow, Must Fight
for Any Share She May Get From
the Estate.
The will of the late Adolph Sutro was j
opened by the legal advisers of the mil- ,
lionaire's children In the parlor of the
family residence at Sutro Heights yes- j
terday morning. In addition to Attor
â¢ neys Reuben A. Lloyd and E. W. Me- i
Klnstry there were present Edgar Sutro, j
' Charles Sutro, Miss Clara Sutro, Dr. j
. Emma Laura Merritt and Mrs. P. A. j
Morbio, children of decedent.
. â¢ The testament was found in Mr. Su- ;
tro's private safe in his office on Mont- I
' gomery and Washington streets. It had i
â¢yellowed with age, having been executed
in 1882. The Sutro Heights property and i
â the great library are not deeded to the j
city, as It was expected by many that i
they would be. The library was not in j
' existence as an entirety at the time the j
" -will was drawn.
The various members of the Sutro fam
ily, hfs own children and those of his
brothers and sisters, have all been liber- ]
ally provided for. Prominent members
. of the House of Representatives of 1870 j
are remembered in recognition of the po
sition taken by them in behalf of the ,
dead man.
' The will is naturally silent on the
claims of Mrs. Kluge, who. it Is affirmed,
Will claim the widow's share of the vast j
estate. Edgar Sutro is authority for the j
statement that the relations of the va- !
â  rious parties at Interest are of an arnic- j
ble character and that no contest is ex- j
pected over the distribution of the es
tate On the other hand persons in a ,
position to know claim that the chil
dren do not take kindly to the appoint
ment of W. H. R. Adamson as joint ex
ecutor with Dr. Emma Merritt. Some
opposition is expected to develop on that
score. The will in its entirety reads:
I. Adolph Sutro, do hereby make, publish and
declare the following as and to be my Â»ast
â  will and testament:

[Seal] W. R. H. ADAMSON,

Indorsed on back of this page: Last will
and testament of Adolph Sutro.
Dated, San Francisco. May 22, 1881
Much surprise was expressed at the date
of the will, it being thought that Mr.
Sutro would have brought It up to the
present time while he retained his busi
ness faculties. The value and extent of
his properties have changed greatly in the
Bixteen years that have elapsed since the
will was drawn.
Intimates of Mr. Sutro explain the mat
ter to their own satisfaction. They af
firm that, like many other rich men, he
had a presentiment that if he made a will
he would die shortly thereafter. Again,
with all his wonderful energy, he was a
"manana" man, always ready to put off
action on any matter until to-morrow.
The paragraph relating to Miss Hattie
Trundle, also known as Mrs. George Al
len has revived an incident that in" its
day shook the social fabric of the Corn
stock to its very center. Mr. Sutro leaves
her $50,000 as reparation for a scandalous
charge made against her at Virginia. City
in 1579. The affair that led up to it took
place in the old International Hotel. Mrs.
Sutro made serious charge.-; against the
woman, resulting in a personal encounter.
The Sutro library, which it was thought
would go to the city, will now form part
of the estate. It consists of nearly 300 .0 M
volumes, stored in Montgomery Block
and on Battery street. Outside of the
great public libraries <>f Europe there is
nothing to compare with it. Mr. Sutro
was a shrewd buyer and accumulated a
remarkable collection of books at ordin
ary cost. When the possessions of the
mad King of Bavaria wer.- sold he bougnt
largely and secured many rare volumes.
It was partly on the promise that the
library would go to the city that the
Afnlia"ted Colleges were located on the
land south of Golden Gat.' Park.
It is intimated by persons close to the
family that the children will acknowledge
that Mrs. KlUge, the alleged widow, has
rights, and will settle with her rather
than fight the matter in the courts.
Mrs. Kluge has two children. Adolph
and Adolphine, both of whom are said to
bear all the striking characteristics of the
Sutro family.
BANCROFT FAILED TO
PAY SALESMAN STONE
ASKS BACK PAY AT THE RATE
OF $350 PER MONTH.
Circuit Judge Beatty Enlightened on
the Way History Is Made in
California and Massa
chusetts.
Before United States Circuit Judge Be
atty of Idaho yesterday a jury was Im
paneled to try the suit t>f H. B. Hambly
(assignee of N. J. Stone) against H. H.
Bancroft to recover $8833 33 salary, to
gether with interest at 7 per cent and
the costs.
The complaint recites that on August
20, 188fi. N. J. Stone and the defendant
entered Into a contract, whereby in con
sideration of the services rendered by
Stone In taking the publication and sale
of the hlstoriepl works of 11. 11. Ban
croft, the History Company sold to Stone
one-tenth of the stock of the conpany and
other property. Stone agreeing to de
vote, his whole time for ten years to the
publication and sale of the Bancroft his
torical works. The company contracted
in addition to pay Stone a salary of $350
per month, and he was to engage In no
other business, but to flevote all his
time and attention to the work laid out
in the contract.
Stone alleges that for the period begin
ning on April 1, 1594, to August 20, 18ftfi.
the defendant refused to pay him his
salary, although he presented himself
daily at the office to tender his services
in accordance with the terms of the con
tract.
The suit was brought originally In
Judge Seawell's court in April. 1897, but
was transferred to the United States Cir
cuit Court on June IS, 1897, on the peti
tion of Bancroft, who alleged that lie
was a citizen of Massachusetts.
Mr. Stone occupied the stand during
the whole of the afternoon, and told the
Jurymen how at various times within the
period set forth In the complaint he had
demanded his salary from Mr. Bancroft,
and had been refused; Imw he had regu
larly announced himself as ready for
work, and how. just as regularly, the de
fendant had refused to give him work
to do.
An admission of the wltnesfi that he
had sold a certain patent medicine on bis
own account during the life of the con
tract and before the iiling of the com
plaint in this suit provoked some dis
cussion between the opposing counsel.
Plaintiff's counsel, Messrs. Eddy and Met
son, insisted on knowing how much
Stone had earned by selling the medi
cine, and the defendant's counsel object
ed. The latter argued that the suit was
for salary under an alleged contract; that
it was Boi 8 suit for damages for viola
tion of contract, and that, therefore, it
was not material whether he earned any
thing or nothing by selling the medi
cine. If he had violated the contract he
was not entitled to recover.
The case wilf be resumed this morning.

SOLDIERS TO
GO TO THE
GOLD FIELDS
Battery A to Garrison
Fort Yukon.
TO KEEP PEACE IN ALASKA
WILL BE DISPATCHED WITH
ALL POSSIBLE SPEED.
It Is Said That One Company of the
Sixth Regiment May Accom
pany the Expedition to
the North.
No time will be lost by Major General
Alerriam in dispatching troops to Central
Alaska. He will gazette an order this I
morning relieving Battery A, United j
States Army, from duty here, with in- j
structions to make ready to proceed at
any early day to Alaska. Lieutenant Me- j
Manus will be the officer in charge. Sev- j
eral subordinate officers will accompany
him. The battery will number one hun
dred and ninety-three men. The full com
plement of arms will be taken, except,
perhaps," heavy guns, which It would be
difficult if not impossible to transport. In j
addition there will be large quantities of 1
supplies for the troops and such needy I
miners as may require assistance during j
the winter.
It is possible that one company of the !
Sixth Regiment will also be dispatched, j
though this is not known to be necessary
as yet.
The announcement that troops would go
to Alaska, as made exclusively in the
Call yesterday, aroused much speculation |
and Interest in army circles and there was
a noticeable anxiety to find out which
company or companies would be designat
ed by General Merriam for the Alaskan
service. In part this curiosity is now set j
at rest. Later developments may require
an increased body of troops, either in the j
Copper River or Yukon districts.
The date of starting from San Francisco ;
has not yet been set, but it will probably j
be within a week. The notice is a sudden ;
one and much must be done in the way of 1
preparation. A complete Arctic outfit
for one year must be secured for alL^i
the men. The purchases of materi^..
clothing' and provisions will be pushed \
with all possible dispatch and will not j
consume over four or live days.
The matter of transportation will also
have to be arranged. Some steamer now j
in port will take the battery to St. Mi- '
chael. There the real responsibilities of j
Lieutenant McManus will begin. If he can,
by the use of persuasive words, secure |
the services of all the river boats needed
to take his expedition up the Yukon, good I
and well. If the boat owners are refrac- !
tory, or try a gouge game on the Govern- '
ment, then McManus will have to seize
the craft necessary for his purposes. Ho
will press on up the Yukon with all pos- (
sible speed, trying to reach Fort Yukon in 1
September, as the floating ice later in the j
season practically puts a stop to naviga
tion before the final freeze-up. Having
reached his destination, the Lieutenant's
first duty will be to secure the safety of
his supplies and to build log cabins for
his men. This of itself will be a hard un
dertaking, as large timber is scarce
there. Last winter the few cabins at Fort
Yukon were In such demand that the poor- j
est kind of a shack rented easily for $50 a 1
month. It is possible that the lieutenant I
will see fit to establish headquarters some
little distance away from the trading post,
where more suitable timber can be found. j
It is believed that the battery, with :
nearly two hundred men, will be strong
enough to cope with any lawless mob t
that may attempt to make trouble on the
river. Of course the Canadian mounted
police will attend to the job of preserv
ing order on the Upper Yukon In the Do
minion's territory. Lieutenant McManus
will, however, have a stretch of over one
thousand miles of the Yukon Valley under '
his control. The chances are that mill
tary law will be declared, so as to enable !
him to act with the authority that the
circumstances require.
At the present time there are several
boats in the harbor of San Francisco, ;
either one of which would be available j
for the transportation of the troops.
General Merriam has the matter in I
hand, but will make no statement of his
intentions at this hour. , "The battery
will go as soon as I can send it," was his
summary of the situation.
There is considerable excitement among !
the boys of Battery A over their assign- .
ment to duty on the Yukon. â¢ Up to twen
ty-four hours ago It seemed as likely as '
not that 'they would be dispatched to the
torrid Philippines for garrison duty, or '
possibly active service In suppressing out
breaks of the Insurgents.
RED CROSS IN PEACE
AS WELL AS IN WAR
Successful Meeting Â«f the State Asso-
ciation â An Address by Judge
Sheldon.
The oprninp meeting: of tho California
Red Cross Association, held in Golden
Gate Hall last evening, was largely at-
tended.
The band of the Seventh California
Regiment played the "Star-Spangled
Banner," after which Mrs. W. B. Har
rington, the president of the association,
delivered a brief address of welcome and
Introduced Mrs. John F. Merrill, presi
dent of the San Francisco Red Cross So
ciety, who Bald that the object of the
meeting was to give the State society
an opportunity to report upon what It
had done.
Mrs. I>. I* Dunbar, secretary of the
State R*kl Cross, thereupon delivered her
report showing that there are 91
auxiliary' societies in the State, and that
the badge of membership Is worn by
20,000 Californians. About $90,000 had been
collected in California, of which sum a
large part had been expended for sup
plies of various kinds. There have been
21,000 men received and entertained.
There has been turned Into the State
treasury $80,000 for membership due?.
badges, etc. A hospital of 125 beds and
supplies has been sent to Manila.
Mrs. MeKinstry, who has charge of the
supplies from all over the SiaiÂ»-, made a
detailed report of her departm-

assistant treasurer, showed total receipts
of $22,119 74. disbursements of $10,472 Si,
and a balance on hand of $11,647 11.
The band gave the various bugle calls,
and then Judge Sheldon of New York,
representing the National Red Cross So
ciety, was introduced. He gave an Inter
esting history of the origin of th> society,
and spoke at length upon the principles
upon which It is founded, the good that
it has accomplished and Its future work.
He maintained that it has as much to
do in times of peace as in times of war.
and cited instances of distress rell< .-.:
among the victims of floods, earthquakes,
plagues and epidemics, great, conflagra
tions, forest fires, appalling accidents and
calamities. He urged that the State Cal
ifornia Association, which had already
accomplished so much good, be perma
nently maintained. To be prepared in
time of peace was a duty, as then we
should always be prepared for war, and
there was no telling when war would
break out. The work of the Red Cross
Is simply military humanity.
Brief remarks were made by Rev. Dr.
Stehbins, l>r. Voorsanger and General W.
H. L. Barnes, the meeting concluding
with the playing of "America" by tho
band.
Among those who occupied seats on
the stage w-ere Bishop Nichols and
Father Otis of the Paulists. Among the
delegates in attendance -were Mrs. f>. G
Stephens, vice-president, Los Angeles-
Mrs. Sarah A. Wentworth, Redwood
City; Miss Mary A. Brignole, Sutter
Creek; Mrs. Sarah T. Fox, Redwood
City; Mrs. George Ballou, San Diego;

ISAAC BROMLEY DEAD.
The Well-Known Editor's Life Ended
at Norwich, Conn., Yesterday.
Telegrams were received last evening
announcing the death yesterday, at Nor
wich, Conn., of Isaac H. Bromley, a
brother of Uncle George T. Bromley, and
uncle of David Williamson of this city,
l aac Bromley was one of the best known
;i id ablest editorial writers in the United
States. He was the founder of the Nor
wich Bulletin, and subsequently editor of
the Hartford Post. He went to New York
during the lifetime of Horace Greeley and
became connected with the editorial de
partment of the New York Tribune. For
many years prior t<> his death he was one
Of th." editors Of the Tribune. His ac
quaintance with the leading public men of
this country was wide, and at Washing
ton he was the welcome guest of Presi
dents Cabinet officers and United States
Senators He was a graduate of Yale
College a classmate of General W. 11. L.
Barnes and a close friend of Chauncey M.
Depew. , . . _
Isaac Bromley was appointed a Govern
ment director of the I'nlon Pacific Rail
road by President Arthur. Hi* official
tours of inspection brought him several
times to San Francisco, and while here
he mad' a bOSt <>f friends and was elected
an honorary member oi the Bohemian
ciui>. Mr. Bromley was a scholarly, com
panionable man of ran- geniality <>f dispo
sition. In conversation he was gifted
away beyond the common lot of mortals
as lie possessed a sense of humor that
was captivating. Mr. Bromley was 66
years of age.
Yesterday's Fires.
An alarm was turned in from box 51fi at
8:15 yesterday afternoon for a fire In the
dwelling: of M. Nlcholls on Michigan
street, between Twenty-first and Twenty
second. The damage is estimated at $500
and the fire was caused by children play
ing- with matches. Box 95 at 7 o'clock was
for a $25 blaze in the restaurant of G. Ce
laps at 11 Taylor street, caused by an
overheated range.
THE EMPORIUM.
DENOUNCE THE
SOUTHERN BRIGADIER
TYPOGRAPHICAL UNION WILL
ADOPT RESOLUTIONS.
Eighth Annual Convention of the
State Typos in Session at the
Supervisors' Chambers.
The eighth annual convention of the
California State Typographical Unlo;i was
convoked in the chambers of the Board of
Supervisors yesterday morning, and will
continue to-day and probably adjourn to
morrow noon. The sessions are presided
over by S. 11. Jenne? of San Francisco, the
president. The other officers are: M.
Henry Argall of Grass Valley, vice-presi
dent; Cyren E. Fisk of Los Angeles, or
ganizer; M. A. Mclnnls of Oakland, secre
tary-tre.-isurer; A. J. Read of Oakland,
James Marr of San Jose and S. L. Rob
bins of San Francisco, executive commit
tee.
At the afternoon session Cyren E. Fisk
made a strong appeal to the convention
for a resolution condemnatory of the ap
pointment of Harrison (i. Otis of Los An
geles a brigadier general in the I'nited
M;ii,s Volunteers, He was bitter in his
denunciation of the Southern editor and
waa seconded by ether members. There
was some objection to the resolution on
the ground that in time of war the Gov
ernment should be. permitted Its own
choice of generals, and there was a
chance to thus be rid of Otis entirely.
A committee composed of William Min
or, L. P. Ward and William Hill was ap
pointed on motion of Mr. Fisk to recom
mend some action in the resolution.
The committee on credentials. S. L.
Robbins, William Hill and James Benson,
appointed by the chair, reported the toi

THE DUTY OF CITIZENS.
|.|i T ATIONAL patriotism, State pride and all the
1 \ thousand personal interests that are insepara
â¢' . bly bound up with the welfare of the nation
ifcad.'the State combine to impel citizens to the per
formance of their political duties, and yet, in spite
*>f all and to the neglect of all, a very large propor
tion of the people of this city have as yet failed to
Register as voters and thus assure their right to vote
fet- the coming elections.
There seems to be something like the deadness of
fipathy among a considerable number of citizens with
respect to politics. The registration at the City
Hall has been the lowest for many years, and but
three days remain for precinct registration. Unless
there is an immediate awakening of the laggards to
3 sense of their responsibilities as citizens it is cer
tain .that many will fail to register and thus by their
own fault forfeit the privilege of having a voice and
a vote in the election of Congressmen and State and
county officers this fall.
â¢ The worst feature of the situation is that it is al
most a certainty that those who have neglected to
register arc members of that class to which a com
munity has to look for support 1 against the machina
tions of bosses and the corrupting elements of poli
tics. . The henchmen of the bosses always register.
Their votes never fail at primaries, or on election
day. If. then, the citizens who are independent of
machine domination neglect to register, to attend
the primaries or to vote, the control of our politics
falls necessarily into the hands of the bosses and
those who arc willing to co-operate with them.
â¢ â  Three days remain for registration. The time has
come to make the last appeal to the laggards to
rouse up fn>ni their apathy and attend to their polit
ical duty. If they continue to neglect the trust the
Government reposed in them when it established
universal manhood suffrage they will surely regret it.
All citizens are concerned in the maintenance of
{good government and all should help to sustain it.
. ThjE CriEST-EXPANSION TEST.
DR. OLIX F. HARVEY of Pennsylvania, who
is reported to have recently examined more
than "a thousand applicants for admission to
the volunteer army, has embodied the results
pf his observations in a statement that the defects
jriost frequent among the applicants were those of
the eyes, of the teeth or of chest expansion.
Concerning defective teeth, or eyes, there are not
likely to be any great differences of opinion, but it
is questionable whether the chest expansion test is
fcfair one. According to reports of the statement
that have come to us, Dr. Harvey says: "Strange
jas.it may seem, nearly ail who had narrow chests
(were young farmers. Brought up to run a plow
tor hoe and scrape the ground with long-handled
tools, they had very strong arms and backs, but were
muscle bound and bent over. Theii- chests had been
contracted, and few of them could expand on inhala
tion the requisite two inches."
The very fact that young men brought up to work
ftn farms could not stand the chest expansion test is
one that tends to show there is something wrong
.with that standard of measuring strength or vital
ity. As a matter of fact, a great many people prac
tice abdominal breathing. Their chests are exer
cised only by labor. Therefore, the chest, while big
enough for the lungs and strong enough to enaMe
a man to work all day at a threshing machine, is not
elastic and does not respond easily to attempts at
â¢expanding it. On the other hand, some man who
has practiced chest breathing may have a great deal
of 'elasticity and expansion, and yet be but a weak
ling in comparison with the abdominal breather of
the harvest field.
â  Any set of muscles can be developed by exercise.
Continual piano playing will make a man's fingers
'supple and strong, but it would be absurd to assume
therefore that the hand of a piano player is stronger
than that of a farm boy who has been handling a
hayfork, and whose fingers are not nimble at all.
The elasticity of the client muscles and the conse
quent enlargement of the extent of chest expansion
arc undoubtedly desirable, but there is such a thing
as overrating their importance to the human organ
ism. " The greater portion of the Tungs are below
'the chest, and abdominal breathers are in most cases
possessed nf a larger lung power than the chest
breathers. There i.s many a gymnasium athlete who,
'if set to work in a harvest field, would get out of
wind, while the farm boy would be singing as he
worked, and much the same difference of condition
might result if the two were set to making quick
time on a long march.
As a general rule, it may be stated that any test
that excludes the American farmer's boy from the
ranks of a vitally strong manhood is very apt to be
wrong. It may appear that his chest is contracted
and his shoulders humped, according to city stand
ards, but he is nearly always of perdurable tough
ness, and whether at a fight or a frolic is a match
for any man he meets.
"JIM" REfTS TRIUMPH-
THE success which so far has attended in Santa
Clara County the efforts of James W. Rea to
defeat the Republican party of California this
year will be received by readers of The Call and Re
publicans generally, throughout the State, with re
gret and alarm.
Mr. Rea objected to an open primary altogether,
because such a thing would compel him to resort to
unfair methods for depriving the people of Santa
Clara County of representation in the State conven
tion. He much preferred to appoint the delegates,
and had he been let alone he would in so doing to a
great extent have concealed the nature of his politi
cal leadership. But the Republican State Central
Committee ordered a primary and Mr. Rea's follow
ers have been forced to disfranchise his constituents
by stuffing ballot boxes, suppressing legal votes, bull
doting respectable citizens and carrying things gen
erally with a high hand.
The affidavit of Charles J. Cornell, a resident of
San Jose, that one of Rea's heelers deliberately
pocketed his ballot and refused to deposit it in the
box typifies the methods of the boss. He has car
ried Santa Clara County by the most practical and
disreputable of political tactics.
But the questions which now demand an answer
are: Has Mr. Rea thereby won the votes of the
Republicans of that county? Can he, on election
day, secure their support for the ticket which the
men he has succeeded in sending to the Sacramento
convention will aid in nominating? Are these dele
gates to be received into the counsels of the State
Republican party with favor and will their opinions
with reference to platforms, policies and candidates
carry weight with the respectable Republicans who
must sit down with them at Sacramento on the 23d
inst, to choose a winning ticket?
The Republican party of California has begun
every campaign for many years with a bird of evil
omen perched above its head. "]\m" Rea, it now
seems probable, is to become the somber raven of
the campaign of 1808, unless events shall develop a
larger and more formidable imp in San Francisco.
We think it is time for the Republicans of Cali
fornia to note what every intelligent man in all par
ties now accepts as the truth, namely, that their party
cannot win so long as its Reas are permitted to con
trol its counsels. No stream ever rose above its
source. It will be impossible for Mr. Rea to nomi
nate a winning ticket. If his delegates trade or
combine with Pardee, Gage or any other candidate
that will kill him.
Xlie Republican Convention which
meet* at SacramentÂ© on the Â«3d inst.
must face the great Issue at last. Bo** and
corporation control muÂ»t be repudiated.
The people will never vote for candidates
which are the product of railroad com
binations and political bosslsm. This
fact is so conspicuous that It cannot l>e
gainsaid. The Republicans must cast out
their bosses and corruptionlsts or they
cannot hope to win this battle.
STUDYING THE LESSONS.
WAR is about over, at least so far as the West
Indies are concerned, and in that part of the
field we are now studying the lessons that
have been taught by the campaign. This, it is al
ready evident, is not going to be a pleasant task for
us, for despite the weakness of Spain she has given
us some things to learn that will seem bitter after the
glory in which we have been indulging.
The scope and intent of some of these lessons have
been made public even at this early stage of the
study. In the first place it has been shown that this
progressive nation actually sent to the field an army
equipped with out-of-date arms and ammunition, and
that the sluggish Spaniards were better supplied in
that respect. In the second place our facilities for
transporting troops, for feeding them, for equipping
them with arms and uniforms and for properly caring
for them when wounded, were all inadequate to the
requirements of the emergency.
The controversy now going on between the com
manding general at Santiago and the chief of the
medical staff as to the responsibility for the lack of
sufficient medical supplies at the front during the
fighting is one of the evidences that much has gone
wrong in the conduct of the campaign. Nor does
that controversy disclose the whole extent of it. Re
ports of other officers abound in statements of our
shortcomings. In fact it is beginning to appear that
our victorious march was due almost wholly to the
untiring energy and dauntless valor of our troops
rather than to any other superiority over the foe.
When we remember how proudly we have boasted
of our mechanical skill, our vast resources, our mas
tery of all the forces of science and art known to
civilization, and how often we have derided the
Spaniard for his medieval backwardness, it is dis
agreeable to learn that the Spanish outclassed us in
everything of that kind, and that we won simply be
cause we are the better fighting animal.
It is useless in prosecuting these studies to seek
to place the responsibility and the blame for our
shortcomings upon the shoulders of any particular
man or set of men. To do so would be to lose the
whole profit that we can otherwise derive from them.
The officers in command did the best they could, and
probably the best any one could, with the means at
their disposal. It is not their fault that the army had
old-fashioned rifles, no smokeless powder, no suffi
cient means for transporting artillery. Nor is it the
fault of the Government that adequate transports for
the troops were not at hand, that the army mail went
astray and that other evils happened.
The fault is in ourselves and not in our Govern
ment or in our officers. We have gone on in the
belief that this country has no need of an army. We
have permitted such nations as Spain and even
Turkey to surpass us in the efficiency of military
weapons. We have relied upon our isolation from
Europe to maintain peace and upon the inherent
valor of our people to win battles. This reliance has
not failed us utterly, but it has cost us much. We
ought therefore as a people learn the lessons of this
war and profit by them to such an extent that we will
not be caught so unprepared hereafter.
When Arkansas goes into the lynching business
there is nothing small about it. We are bound to say,
however, that the spectacle of five people, three of
them women, dangling from convenient limbs, is not
of a character to reflect credit upon American civili
zation.
It is a little early in the game to accuse Alger of
senrjing men to the front for political reasons. Of
course there are symptoms of peace, but they are
more apt to become impressive if there are plenty of
troops to encourage them.
News accounts speak of "busted" miners in the
Klondike. The expression may not be correct.
However, no better one has been suggested.
Aguinaldo and his followers are reported to be
sullen, but their state of mind is really a matter of
secondary importance.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 12, 1898.
THE CRITICISM OF SOFTER.
YELLOW jealousy and yellow journalism com
bine to gird at General Shafter. He and his
old regiment are Californkins and our people,
regarding them as our fellow citizens, are interested
in their honor and welfare.
In the first place, General Shafter has been criti
cized for putting his men into battle so soon after
landing at Santiago. Every one familiar with that
tropical climate knows that, especially in the rainy
season, which was on when our army landed, men
from the temperate zone rapidly weaken and sicken.
Shafter was highly wise when he fought his men
as quickly as he could, for he had the use of the
strength they brought from the North, which ten
days later had been sapped completely by the tropi
cal heat and poison. There were many casualties.
Yes, but if the men had lain in camp for ten days
the Spaniards could have massacred them all, for
their strength would have been gone and they would
have been incapable of defense, to say nothing of
aggression. Again, the casualties were numerous
because it was the only real land battle fought (hir
ing the brief war. There have been gallant dashes
and heroic resistance to wild assaults, like that at
Malate, wherein the finest results of discipline and
the highest exhibitions of personal courage have
gratified the country, but at Santiago was the only
real, set battle of the whole war. There our troops
met an entrenched and stubborn foe. It was not a.
Spanish skedaddle, but a contest to the death on
both sides. It was a sustained action. Our troops
pressed forward step by step, and died to hold what
they had gained. Many fell, heroes all. and the
swart soldiers who fell under their fire were heroes
too. It was not an action with heroes on one side
and poltroons on the other.
Shafter and his council of war planned the battle
and it was fought out to the line on which they
laid it. The desperate attempt of Cervera to escape
and the destruction of his fleet hastened conclusions.
It is probable that, without that event, to have car
ried the city by assault would have required a con
siderable addition to our forces, fresh from the
North and bringing strength with it to replace that
which, was rapidly ebbing from the regiments first
landed.
General Shafter was not responsible for the lack
of equipment of the medical and hospital corps. He
was not responsible for the theft of what meager
stores there were by our ignoble allies, the thieves
tinder Garcia. Equipment is the business of the
quartermaster general and the surgeon general of
the army. Shafter is no more to blame for its lack
than he is for the poison climate of Cuba which
felled his men when Spanish bullets failed.
Shafter commanded in the single land battle and
won it. He received the surrender of a city and a
province and its guarding garrisons of 24,000 men.
He maintained civil order, set up a government and
promoted the resumption of commerce and the arts
of peace, so necessary to avert starvation of the
people. Carping and yellow criticism cannot alter
these facts nor tarnish his image in history.
OUR VANISHING FORESTS.
AT this season, when we are preparing to elect
a new Legislature, when progressive men are
considering what legislation to ask. on behalf
of the general welfare next winter, and when forest
fires are sweeping away thousands of dollars' worth
of property every week, it is pertinent both to the
politics and the industrial interests of the State to
iterate and reiterate the importance of providing pro
tection for our woodlands. For that reason, though
we have repeatedly directed attention to the subject
of late, we return to it this morning with a new argu
ment.
A few days ago we showed the interest taken by
the Eastern States in the problem of forest preserva
tion by extracts from a discussion upon the i>sue at
the recent meeting of the wood pulp paper manufac
turers. To-day we direct attention to the same prob
lem considered from the point of view of the Eastern
lumber industry. In reviewing the growing scarcity
of lumber woods and the increasing value of forests
as far west as Michigan and Wisconsin in a recent
issue the Timberman says:
"The greatest obstacle to a proper utilization of our
forest resources is that there are so many operating
lumbermen who arc carrying on their business, solely
for the present, with no regard for the future. They
should be brought to an appreciation of the fact, how
ever, that twenty years, or even ten years, is likely to
bring great changes in values of timber resources,
and therefore that within the life of the ordinary
lumber industry of to-day there is likely to be an in
creased value to the timber as it now stands which
will repay present care in its preservation."
According to that estimate, and there is no reason
to doubt its accuracy, the cost of forest preservation
in the East would be compensated for in twenty
years by the increase alone in the value of the timber
without counting anything of the gain of saving the
trees from destruction. If that is the condition of
affairs in the East that of the Pacific Coast cannot be
widely different. In our indifference to forest preserva
tion we are permitting the destruction of that one of
our natural resources whose comparative value is
most rapidly increasing with every year that passes.
If in the older States more serious and earnest
thought is given to this subject than with us, it is not
because the conditions there are widely different from
our own, or because the problem there is more im
portant, but solely because they have had a longer ex
perience of the evils of forest destruction and are now
suffering more acutely from the results of past negli
gence.
Not long ago the Philadelphia Record, in com
menting upon the waste of woods In that part of the
Union, said: "Within the past forty years vast tracts
of walnut, oak and other valuable forest trees have
been ruthlessly destroyed in this country, and some
varieties of these woods are now almost extinct." A
similar waste is going on in the great forests of the
Pacific Coast. It will not be long before we also shall
have to bewail past folly in this respect if we do not
profit by the experience of the older States and apply
at once the remedy of adequate protection to our
forests. Our woodlands are far-reaching, abundant
and prolific, but they are not inexhaustible, and the
question of their preservation is one of the most im
portant economic problems in the whole range of
practical legislation.
School Director Waller would be snfc even if some
one were really to shoot at him. It is believed by
those who saw him sprinting from imaginary danger
that he can outrun any bullet yet known to military
science.
Now the Spaniards are showing a disposition to
court-martial Toral, a circumstance proving that for
a Spanish general to exhibit any symptom of com
mon sense is the height of rashness.
We are hardly prepared to believe that having
polished us off Spain is preparing to try a round or
two with England.
FATHER YORKE REPLIES TO DR. CLINTON.
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir:
The letter of the Hon. C. A. Clinton,
published this morning, demands a few
words from me. He accuses me of mak
ing "erroneous and misleading state
ments" and he demands the justice of a
correction. If I made "erroneous and
misleading statements" concerning Dr.
Clinton I shall be most happy to with
draw them. I desire to further no cause
by "erroneous and misleading state
ments."
The first "erroneous and misleading
statement" of which I am accused is
my charge that Dr. Clinton has attack
ed me. He says, "I have never either
directly or indirectly attacked the rev
erend gentleman."
Permit me to transcribe a letter
which I received from the honorable
Supervisor last May
SAN FRANCISCO, May 21. 1898.
Rev. Father Yorkeâ Editor Monitor:
The article in to-day's Monitor in which
my name is used in connection with the
Sailors' Home does me a gross injustice.
It is false, cowardly, contemptible, un
grateful, uncalled for and totally unde
served. C. - - CLINIUJN.
I do not know what ideas the honor
able gentleman may attach to tne
words used in that note, but to me it
seems a very serious attack to be called
an ingrate, a coward and a liar.
The second â¢'erroneous and mislead
ing" statement of which I am accused
is my charge against the Sailors' Home
The honorable Supervisor declares that
the Mayor and the Board of Supervi
sors thoroughly investigated the man
agement of the institution and found it
faultless. I beg to state that no inves
tigation, thorough or other, was made
by the Mayor and the Board of Super
visors. Such investigation to deserve
the name should have been made by
the board in the light of day and with
due notice to the persons concerned.
To merely hear the pleas of those in
terested in getting the lease, to listen
to the attorn- ys of the old society or
the officers thereof In a private room,
to stroll alone through the corridors
of the institution, these private and un
official actions do not constitute an in
vestigation.
Let me say h>rc, Mr. Editor, that the
facts which X have published about the
Sailors' Home have never been contro
verted. I have shown it to be a secta
rian institution. I have proved that it is
not a charitable institution. If the Hon.
Dr. Clinton, if his fellows on the Board
of Supervisors were acting in good
faith, why did they not meet these
charges? The facts arc backed up by
sufficient testimony. They have never
bt â¢i; explained away. No efficacious
means have been taken to prevent a
recurrence of them. The only answer
that has ever been proffered concern
ing tlu-m has been the Ipse dixit of Dr.
Clinton. The honorable doctor may be
a very great man, but he is not so great
that his mere denial will abolish facts.
That denial is of the less weight that it
is couched in such terms as "false, cow
ardly, contemptible, ungrateful, uncall
ed for and totally undeserved."
Let me tell Dr. Clinton that I am not
in the habit of making rash and reck
less assertions, and therefore I am not
to be turned from my purpose by rash
and reckless denials. I have made use
of many more opportunities than Dr.
Clinton has at his disposal to study
the question of the Sailors' Home. Were
I accustomed to deal in mere assertion,
to take rumor for truth, or to set forth
-itions that are not demonstra-
Ith certainty, I might have said
many more things about the Sailors'
Home, about the Board of Supervisors
and about the Hon. Dr. Clinton. I have,
v.-r, confined myself to hard facts
and they are sufficient to prove my con
tention.
The third "erroneous and misleading
Btatement" of which the honorable doc
â mplatns is my accusation that he
is the moving cause in this latest at
tack.
I have shown how much faith is to
li.- plared in his previous general de
nial, that he never attacked me, al
â  tly. Prom his own let
ter you may judge, Mr. Editor, how
much credence is to be placed in this
specific denial ay to this new attack.
It may be well, however, to remark
that ho attributes this late letter of the
Seamen's Friend Society t(. the fact
that: "In a recent number of the Mon
itor the subject was again brought up
and again the management of the Sail
ors' Home was attacked. This 'last

THE NEWSPAPER MAGAZINE.
The modern newspaper Is In many ways
a real magazine At its host it presents
illustrations of undisputed artistic ex
cellence, many of which tflve as good an
ldoa of the happening's thoty depict as
need be. A ttrst-r!:iss illustrator can catch
the spirit of an occurrence and portray it
as .satisfactorily as if it had been done
with a camera and published in the form
of a half-tone cut. Indeed, a pen-and-ink
â ketch is often superior to a photographic
reproduction. As for the literary quality
of the newspapers, In spite of all that has
been said derisively about newspaper
Efrigiish, the mass of the work of the
modern correspondent Is not so far below
that of the magazine contributors in
merit as to make comparison impossible.
Indeed, many of the best-known con
tributors to the monthly publications are
at the present moment engaged In work
straw' was pr.Wably the immediate
cause which moved the board, etc.,
etc.
The ingenuousness of this plea may
be judged by the fact that the manage
ment of the Sailors' Home was not at
tacked in a recent number of the Moni
tor. The only reference to the subject
made in a recent number of the Mom
tor is contained in this sentence: The
Supervisors who elected Reis .the in
dorsee of Apaism. and delivered over
the Sailors' Home to a sector an so
ciety, together -with Ragan a tail in the
School Board, are not fit men to be
nominated by any convention
This is an attack, not on the man
agement of the Sailors' Home, but on
fhe SuDervisors. The Supervisors,
therefore *Â£d he who was the most
guilty the Hon. Dr. Clinton, were the
Parties who needed defense. That de
fense was delivered from behind the
TiVttk-oats of the Ladies' Seamen s
end Society, and Dr. Clinton to the
contrary notwithstanding, was engi
neered by those whose political future
depended on the efficaciousness of the
Â£tt S me remind you, Mr. Editor, that
the following account of the proceed
ings appeared in your paper: exclaimed
"I offer as an amendment,' 1 exclaimed
Supervisor Clinton, "that the communi
caUon be spread in full on the minutes
of his meeting. I ask this in justice
to myself and to the other members of
the board who have been unjustly ac
cused The charges of the Monitor are
false and characterized by gross mis
representation. My character has been
attacked and I want to be placed right
on the record."
The Hon. Dr. Clinton was willing then
to stand sponsor for the bantling which
he would now disown. It was his
"apologia" and he would have it on
the records for all time. When three
months ago the management of the
Sailors' Home was criticized that man
agement did not dare reply even
though the uninitiated might have sup
posed that the lease was in jeopardy.
Now when the lease is secured the Sail
ors' Home is trotted out with an un
necessary justification of its actsâ and
why? Because Dr. Clinton is in danger.
When we remember this and bear in
mind the value of the former denials
of the honorable gentleman it requires
no gift of second sight to estimate at
its true value his disclaimer of connec
tion with the letter signed Nancy
Cooper and Anna McAnney.
For the honorable doctor's pious
prayers for my future welfare and con
version I am humbly grateful. As to
the value of such ostentatious suppli
cations you, Mr. Editor, may be doubt
ful when you remember the divine
1 warning, "And when ye pray, ye shall
not be as the hypocrites that love to
stand and pray in the synagogues and
corners of the streets that they may
be seen of men. Verily, I say unto you
they have received their reward." 1
sincerely hope the honorable gentleman
will not be defrauded of his due.
As for me I have no desire to quarrel
personally with him or to pay any at
tention to personal attacks on myself.
I have no recollection of having met
Dr. Clinton more than twice, once in a
street car and once on the occasion of
a sick call. Why, therefore, he should
claim to have been my friend passes
my comprehension; but, whether he
were friend or neighbor or even enemy
I have no desire to do him wrong. And
that I do him no wrong his manner of
action convinces me. When he meets
my facts with arguments other than
bare denials couched in abusive lan
guage and based on his unsupported
j say so I shall give him credit for good
! faith. Personal charges of untruth,
! cowardice and the like do not bother
me. I am afraid I have too many sins
of my own in the matter of personali
ties to answer for to be justified in re
plying to mere personal charges. But.
Mr. Editor, this is not a mere personal
matter. It is a great. question of prin
ciple â question of sectarianism or
non-sectarianism, for which thousands
of citizens of this city sacrificed party
and friends and office in order to set
tle it once for all in the sense of the
constitution. That this principle has
been betrayed by Dr. Clinton and by
his associates on the Board of Super
j visors is the sole conclusion deducible
' from the uncontroverted facts I have
placed before the public. Something is
; needed to offset these facts besides big
words, profuse professions and unctuous
! prayers. Yours truly,

OUR TREATMENT OF PRISONERS.
Good gunnery and dauntless valor nre
not the only features of our fighting that
have astonished the Spaniards. Th<\v ;ir>;
amazed at our courteous treatment of our
prisoners of war.
The Spanish press has contemptuously
characterized our soldiers and Bailors as
"American pigs." The Spanish editors
nave pictured our officers with all the
brutal attributes of barbarians. Hut
Spanish prisoners have found our officers
chivalrous and humane. They find that
a/nong the lirst concerns of an American
admiral or general after an engagement
are the safety and comfort of the pris
oners.
The conduct of the victors toward the 1
vanquished after the destruction of the
Spanish fleet at Santiago was magnani
mous In the extreme. Admiral Cervera
was more impressed by the courtesy of i
the American fleet officers and their en- ;
thuslastic congratulations than by any
other Incident connected with the crush
ing defeat. He was so elated over the
generous treatment accorded him that he
took especial care to acknowledge It in
his official dispatches to the Spanish au
thorities.
It is a pleasure to record the fact that
the American policy of dealing with pris
oners, was fully reciprocated in the chi
valrous treatment of Lieutenant Ho
and his crew 'of the Merrimac by both
Admiral Cervera and < '.â¢â â¢'.< â¢ r â¢ L i L,lnai
The Spanish officers at the front know
more than Spanish editors about the gal- i
laritry an( ' humanity of the American
soldier. They know that in battle he can
flsrht like a demon; that after the battle â 
he can act like a Christian.â Chicago i

THE VOLUNTEER ENGINEERS.
More than two hundred persons applied
for enlisting papers the other day at th&
recruiting office of the First Regiment,
United States Volunteer Engineers, 335
way. The engineer corps is to be
made up of electricians, linemen, steam
engineers, railroad men, track men, sur
veyors, lumberman, carpenters, masons,
sailors, boatmen, riggers, dock builders,
blasters, pipe calkers, blacksmiths,
wheelwrights, cooks, tailors and, shoe
makers.
"Such a regiment." said Adjutant
Biamwell, "will be entirely new to the
United States service. It is the plan fol
lowed in the European armies, and its ad
vantages will be at once apparent. Here
tofore the men in the engineer regiments
in service here were drilled and instructed
as miners and sappers, and their ability
ran chiefly to the construction of fortiil
cations. We want experts in thr^
rious lines, and our chief aim Is to have
each squad commanded by a sergeant
who knows how to work the men in these
various branches. Drilling and tactics
will be of secondary consideration, but
will receive sufficient attention. One> idea
is that if bridge building is required we
can at once call on one. or more squads
for the work, and so in every other
branch of work. It is my impression that
battalions of the regiment will be sent
into service soon after being sworn in,
and when it is completed the servi. â 
have the finest body of practical men
composing an engineer regiment that it
is possible to obtain."â New York Com

The.-: an- the delegates to the Demo
! cratic State Convention, elected at the
club primaries held in Alameda County
this afternoon and evening. There were
i no contests except In the Third and Sixth
war is in Oakland and these wore purely
local in their nature.
A majority are claimed for Magulre first
and last, although there are some who be
wlth W. \v. Foote, that it would be
better for the party to suffer temporary
Li than to submit to the dictation of
i the Populists in the matter of the guber
; natorial nomination. But if these dele
or a majority of themâ will support
the "Littlee Spotted <;iant." It is equally
certain that everj one of them will also
BUpport any plan that may be inaugurated
by the Interior delegations for the unseat
ing of the McNab sang from San Francis
co. It Is doubtful If there is a Democrat
in Alameda County who does not de
nounce the work of the political outlaws
across the bay, and If there is any possi
ble chance to overthrow them, Alameda
County partisans may be safely counted
on to assist in- the purification of the par
ty. Mast of the delegation will go to Sac
ramento Sunday night, ready to enter into
the thick of the fray.
In all the scheming and jobbing essen
tial to a ward politician conducting his
own campaign for Governor, Dr. Pardee,
as he stops to "spit" on his hands, pre
paratory to talcing a fresh "holt," finds
one thing to exult over, and, naturally .
he has to tell the world all about It. Like
a child with a stick of candy, all his sor
rows of yesterday are forgotten in his
newer Joy, and Dr. Pardee may now
justly claim that his fight is progressing
beyond his most ardent expectations.
To-night, with all the eclat of bold
faced type and (laming headlines. Dr.
Pardee announces to his admiring con
stituents that at last he has been able
to draw a crowd without the aid of either
a brass band or bonfire.
This is gratifying, indeed, for hereto-
It has been generally regarded as
essential that he have both accessories
in order to get anybody to listen to him.
Now that he has tried the experiment,
and found that freaks will call the cu
rious, even without flaring brass and blaz
ing tar barrels, Dr. Pardee. will probably
dismiss the half dozen musicians who
have nightly escorted him on his weary
rounds, while the Alameda small boy
will find a steady sourer' of revenue from
"hooking" fence boards and other com
bustible material cut off.
Let all rÂ«jolce with the doctor, for.
poor man, his enemies have got him
headed down a mighty thorny trail just
at present, and are goading him on to
such a pace that he tlnds little enough to
joy over.
STes, there Is one more source of com
fort to the doctor. In the same issue of
his organ that tells of his capabilities as
a museum attraction, Dr. Pardee finds
time and space to chortle mildly over his
fine work In the Bnclnal City in "stock
ing" the unpledged delegates, so called.
But this x:< ' la destined to end in woe,
for the Pardee tactics have thoroughly
aroused every Republican In the town,
and an opposition ticket will be in the
field, and not a nanio on it will be a Par
admirer.
The case of Alameda Is an Illustration
of the revulsion of sentiment that has
taken place in the past few weeks. When
Pardee first announced himself a candi
date, he had many warm friends over
there, who would have remained loyal
through thick and thin had it not been
for his arbitrary methods. But Dr. Par
eemed to regard Alameda as his by
right of Conquest and would not brook the
mention of Davis or any other aspirant
for the office. His friends grew restive
and the revolt came when Pardee impu
dently told thorn and his friends else
where that he would not trust them to
name delegates, hut would make up the
lists himself. The Alamedans declared
they would throw off the Pardee yoke and
name delegates, through their clubs, un
pledged to any man. but who would go
to Sacramento entirely free to work for
the best Interests of the county. By some
hook or crook, Pardee managed to .^neak
in six of his friends on this club lint, giv
ing three to Brown, thereby shutting Da
vis out entirely, besides throwing three
votes in the county to an outsider. Da
vis' friends were furious while the great
majority of Pardee's former admirers
openly denounced the job. They deter
mined to put up another ticket, and Deed'
less to say. no man svho is under the
slightest suspicion of being friendly to
.. will find his name on it. This
ticket will be elected beyond a doubt and
Pardee will Und to his cost that Ala
meda's nne delegates will be for Davia,
whereas had he kept his hands off ho
might have had them, should the eitu
ation at Sacramento show at any time
that they would do him any good.
This Is only one instance of how Pardee
is beating himself. Jn the Fourth Ward
in Oakland, where six weeks ago nobody
but Pardee was heard of, the shouts have
become stilled since the doctor baa given
out his little list with orders to his fol
lowers to vote for them blindly. There
are names on that list that good Repub
licans cannot and will not accept, and as
Hcans cannot and will not accept, and
as Pardee refuses to change them
there are rumors of discontent heard
now where formerly only joyous huzzas
rang out before. In the First, Third and
Sixth Wards the situation is about the
same as in the Fourth, while in the
Seventh, Pardee'a old home, the Davis
men are openly claiming they will carry
the ward. Berkeley and Washington and
Murray Townships are BOlid for Davis,
while Eden is debatable ground. Pardee'a
Bhouteraâ that Is the courthouse push,
which the doctor denounced nve years
ago as unclean and corruptâ still make
brave assertions that the doctor will get
anywhere up to 60 per cent of tho dele
gation, but it is painfully evident they
are whistling in the dark and that their
assertions merely voice their desires.
R. W. Snow is announced with a flour
ish as Pardee'S candidate for delegate
at-large from Alameda County. This
means that Mr. Snow has been promised
Pardee'a support in his light fur Mayor
of Oakland next spring.
J W. Nelson was the last man to re
ceive the doctor's doubtful support tor
the Mayoralty, and though he had the
indorsement of almost all the political
bodies, the Pardee handicap was bo great
that ho was badly beaten by J. L. !
who was only incumbered by ihe Populist
nomination.
Following is the complete list of the
officers of election for the different poll
ing places at the Republican primaries
to take place to-morrow. The polls will

that the paralysis has entirely disappeared. I have full use of my arm and feel
better In -every way. I had been troubled with pains in my back and head, but they
have also disappeared. I can truthfully Bay that 1 owe my health at the present
time to the use of your "Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt," and will always be willing to
recommend It to any one suffering as I was. You can refer any one to me and I
will gladly tell them the good I have received from the Belt. Very truly,

THE COUNTRY SUKK < IF AN ABUNDANCE
OF THE Vi:l.I."W MKTAL.
The circular of Henry Clews, under date of
New York, August 6, says: "The Stock Mar
ket maintains a very strong undertone in spite
of limited activity. Peace prospects, of course,
strengthen values; but the i.pproachlng ces
sation of the war had relatively little effect.
The sltoatio.i Is, however, relieved of very
serious doubts; there Will be no further big
bond Issues, and the possibility of international
complications is more remote than at any
time since tha war began. Home conditions
axe unchanged. We have so frequently re
marked upon the improved agricultural. Indus-
trial and commercial condition of the country
that repetition is unnecessary. Nothing ex
cept unforeseen troubles can prevent a higher
slock market. At the moment the marki-t re
fuw B to move upward with any degree of force,
because the big leaders are not prepared to
take the Initiative. Many are away; and the
best leaders wisely prefer to wait until the
critical period of the crop situation is safHy
passed. Should no vigorous damage happen,
the upward movement Is likely to be vigor
ously renewed without opposition.
' An important factor In the situation will be
the large Increase of gold production. Accord
ing to the Mint Bureau at IVushington the j
World's product of gold In 1537 was JIi4O.UOO.iKK).
and the product #f IS9S Is estimated at $275. -
Â©OO,OOO, an increase of $35,000,000. Africa leads
as a gold producer, and is expected to turn
out J7J.ouo.ow this year. Australia and the
United .States are close competitors as gold
producers, each being expected to turn ont
about $60,000,000 this year. The Klondike Is
not proving of the importance anticipated.
The most careful estimates are for a product
of $10,000,000 in 1898, which is smaller than
either California or Colorado; allfornia's prod
uct this year being estimated at $17,000,000 and
Colorado's nt J1'3,000,000. Ten years ago the
â worlds gold product was (110,000,000. Since
then It has been more than doubled, and now
amounts, as Just said, to about $275,000,000.
This does not look like any scarcity of the
precious metal, especially considering the pros
: new supplies and the Increasing use of
other forms of money. Certainly there -will be
no scarcity of gold in the United States; for In
addition to our Increasing output and the
Klondike supply we are likely to have a large
influx of gold in settlement of our trade bal
ance. The latter can be settled by returning
our a<Â»curtties. which Is not likely; by an out
flow of American capital into foreign coun
tries, which may occur to some extent now that j
the war is over: or by the sending of gold, j
that being the most probable outcome. Evi
dently, then, we are sure of having an abund
ance of gold In the country. At the same time
the banks are anxious to expand their circula
tion as soon as they can secure sufficient of
the new 3 per cent bonds; so the prospects are
for an abundance of cheai> money for some
time to come, and- we need hardly Inform our
clients that this is a powerful aid to a rising ;
market."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Aug. 11.â Today's business on
the Stock Exchange was the largest for many
months. Trading was very broad and compre- I
henslve and the tone of speculation extremely
varied. The general undertone continued un
usually strong. The decline in prices was not
allowed to proceed to any great length before
dullness ensued, and In a short time a renewed
demand would carry prices upward again, gen
erally on a much smaller volume of business
than on which they had declined. Business
was so large and so widely distributed that
movements of special stocks had little Influence
on the general list and the market at times
showed excessive Irregularity. Even while
large realizing was going on at one point an
eager demand would spring up at another and
keep the balance about even. Considering the
large total of the day's transactions net
changes are small. Orders placed with com
mission houses to buy stocks were large this
morning and more generally distributed than
at any time since the rise set in. This outside
demnnd was fed with a Steady stream of
stocks which obliterated the opening gain be
fore the end of the fir^t hour. A large part of
the outside orders especially In the grangers
were attributed to Western account. This buy
lag was induced by the unexpectedly favorable
ter of the Government crop report.
3ti-:ilizing was on a greater scale In Burlington
and Hock Island than In the other grangers,
jK-.ssibly due to the comparatively less favor
able showing of the corn crop. The advance In
Atchison preferred brought out such a flood of
offerings that the demand seemed to be.
abandoned largely and turned to other low
priced stocks. A number of preferred railroad
stocks which have not yet come to the full
dividends to which they are entitled and some
of the Junior stocks on which a surplus over
preferred stock has been earned but not dia
: were especially prominent. Northern
Pacific common was the leader In the late
speculation at an advance of 2 points, and
Denver preferred rose at one time 1%. The In
dustrial specialties were irregular. Sugar was
at one time above 140, while Manhattan fell as
low as lor. and was depressed all day.
There were heavy offerings of bonds at times,
especially of recently reorganized roads, a con
elderoble part of the selling being attributed to
foreign account. Total sales $4,320,000. United
Btatea new four? coupon declined % and the
threes when issued advanced l /i in the bid
price.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Aug. 11.â Instead of showing de
terioration in the condition of â¢ spring wheat
during the month, as expected, the Government
crop report made an Improvement of 1.5 points.
That caused the price of September to drop %c
under yesterday's close, opening trades being
at CsVi@Csc. After this expression of bearish
feeling, the market commenced to mend . a
little, the receipts at various Western markets
indicating that no Increase in the movement
had yet set In. The aggregate at the principal
primary markets was 380,500 bushels, against
807,000 bushels the year. before. This striking
deficiency, together with an eager demand for
shipping parcels, worked the price of Septem
ber up to 65% c. It was reported from Kansas
City that No. 2 hard was up 4c a bushel there,
and as there appeared a probability of another
decrease in the visible 'the market became very
strong after many changes of front. December
was depressed from beginning to end and
wound up %c lower for the day. â " September
closed Â£c higher.' ..'â '.â  â¢ , -
. â¢ Corn was influenced by the Government re
port, showing only 3.5 reduction in condition
after all that had been heard of serious dam
age. The recuperative buoyancy of wheat near
the close brought out some buying orders In
corn and the closing figures were the best of
the day. September closed \*@%c lower than
yesterday. . Oats followed the other grains,
closing unchanged to I^c down. Provisions
started weak with corn. A good cash demand
later, however, turned the market strong.
Pork left off unchanged, lard gained 2>Â£ig;sc
and ribs 2V4c.

NEW TO CHICAGO.
A night scone in Chicago painted by the
Tribune of that town:
"Dressed all In bliick. clutching a great
bunch of roses in each hand, and bending
low over the handlebars of his bicycle, a
figure wildly Bcorched down one of tho
driveways of Lincoln Park on Thursday
night. A long, black pennant fluttt ed be
hind it.
" 'I>i<! yon sop it?' yelled the park police
men to each other. 'Did you see its tail?'
"They had. Some of the policemen grew
paie and commenced swearing off things.
"Policeman Bland sprinted acro-.s a
short cut to head off the black rider as
he rounded a curve. "Devil or man, I
commiviid you to stop.' shouted he, as he
caught the wheel and stopped it."
The black rider was arrest, d. He was a
man in evening dress, and hurrying to a
wedding. He was fined. As evening
clother; become more common in Chicago
the present fear of them there will die
away. â New York Sun.

MYSTERY OF A
LAD'S DEATH
Roy McClymonds Found
Dead in an Office.
WAS KILLED BY A BULLET
TRIENDS ASSERT THAT IT IS
NOT A SUICIDE.
. jjhe Boy Left Home in a Happy
. .' . . Hood and One Hour Afterward
He Fired the Fatal
Shot.
â¢'â¢"â â  Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
.â¢j.- â  Broadway, Aug. 11.
â 'â .'. Roy McClymonds. son of the City Su
perintendent of Schools, was found dying
":â  this morning In Dr. Rodolph's dental of
..ftce. When discovered a bullot wound in
â¢â¢his head showed plainly the cause of his
'..:. condition, and ho was at once taken to
: . the Receiving Hospital, whom he died
. le?s than an hour later, without recover
.!â¢ Ing consciousness.
." Th<~- death of young McClymonds, who
.'.' Is. but 19 years old, is a mystery. The
'â â¢â¢theory of suicide has been advanced, and
.-.also the probability that it was an accident,
While It has been vaguely hinted that the

Result of Suicide or Accident.
shot may not have been flrf-ri by the I
; . but by another person. This last th
â â '.baa nothing to corroborate it. Neither Is
.': there any known reason why the lad
. should commit suicide, and there !s a ;
slbllity that the shooting was accidental.
ftoy Mri'iymonds was a dental student
: -in the office of Dr. Rodolph on Broadway.
.-H' 1 went to his work about ff o'clock this
. ; njGrnlng, and was teen to enter the office
by Dr. Edwards and William J. Yore, the
â â  ' manager of the ljullding. He returned
. . .their .salutations cheerfully, and six mm'
". ut.es later, as nearly as Dr. Edwards can
..â  reckon, a shot was heard. Dr. Edwards
'-..and Mr. Yore started to loc irce
-." of tbe shot and discovered young McCly
./ monds lying inside the lavatory, with his
â ''head outside. Coroner Baldwin, whose of
"ftte la in the same building, promptly did
â¢ '.jail possible for the lad, but it was at
"apparent that his breathing would Boon
. -iee&se He died a quarter of an hour after
â ;..Vard. .mm ,
"â â  ". In the lavatory was also found a pistol,
.: With one chamber discharged. The boy
â¢ was never known to carry a pistol, and
â ;tniÂ« incident lends strength to the theory
.ef suicide. Dr. Edwards, who examined
wound, says there is as much t
â  -that it was an accident as a suicide. He
â -.thinks MoClyroonds was probably load
i.lng 'and playing with the weapon, for
there is .-ome blood on the knee, which
rfehowfl that be was sitting down when the
:.' BBot was fired.
.' . ".I cannot account for this affair in any
â  -way." said Superintendent McClymonds.
â¢â f'Ros was always the same frolicsome,
I boy. He never showed any signs
{Si despondency or any dissatisfaction
..'with life. He has never, so fur as I
â¢.know, been anything but strictly upright,
and Dr. Rodolph has told me that he was
: doing nicely at his work. He liked the
â  study of dentistry, and was preparing to
''"resume his work at college next wee*.
Be has been filing in his time with Dr.
â¢â¢' Kodolph during vacation.
.â¢â¢-This morning at breakfast we w<re
'. laughing and joking together as usual,
and my wife tells me that Hoy left home
' in. a happy mood. She accompanied him
-""to the porch, and he referred to a party
'â¢â  '.he was to att< nd this evening, from which
' -be was anticipating much pleasure. The
,". .. shooting must have been an accident, for
â¢ -the boy would never commit suicide. Roy
' was not likely to be troubled by love af
â  fairs. He had Borne young lady friends,
but he never wi nt with any one in par
ticular. 1 am <â < nvinced that he had no
""trouble that would make him despondent.
â¢ 'He had absolutely no reafeon for wanting
â¢ to end his own life, but, instead, had
i . everything to live for. It must certainly
. ba.ve been an accident."
The deceased wa a graduate of the
Oakland High School oi the class of June,
â  â  ' HÂ» ;*, and was also vice president of the
. High School Aegis Publishing Company.
'Coroner Baldwin conducted an inquest
â¢ in the case at 8 o'clock this evening, and
tbe jury returned a verdict "f "death
; caused by the accidental discharge of a
pistol which the deceased was handling."

CHARGED WITH MURDER.
Etta M. Payne Swears ta a Complaint
Against Frank H. Cheesman.
OAKLAND, Aug. 11.â Miss Etta Payne,
one of the victim's of Frank H. .Chees
man's thirst for blood, and who is still
under treatment at the Receiving Hos
pital, swore to a complaint this morning,
charging Cheesman with the murder of
her stepfather, Henry J. Brooke. Chees
man will be arraigned before Judge Allen
to-morrow morning, and a date act for his
preliminary examination.
Cheesman was not present at the in
queÃt held last night, but when told by
the police officials what the verdict was
he expressed no surprise. The prisoner
still acts in a sullen manner, seemingly
caring little for the probable outcome of
his dastardly crime. He has not made
any outbreaks since his arrest, but pro
tests against watch being held by the two
men Captain Fletcher has placed over
him.
MELROSE POWDER WORKS.
The Supervisors Powerless to Pre
vent Their Reconstruction.
OAKLAND. Aug. 11.â It developed to
day at a meeting of the Board of Super
visors that the fuse works that caused
devastation, death and ruin at Melrose
may be rebuilt if the company so desires,
j the Supervisors having no prohibitive
powers in the matter.
A delegation of Fruitvale residents was
present at the meeting to protest against
the rcbuiding of the works of the West
ern Fuse and Explosive Company. The
Supervisors Individually expressed them
- aa opposed to the reconstruction
but declared that the board has no power
to prevent the company rebuilding.
Is. H. Marwedel, on behalf of the pro
testants, stated that President Lukens
had lost $75,000 in the explosion, which
gave an idea of the amount of powder
kept at the works, and he vainly hoped
that the Supervisors would pass an ordi
nance against a repetition of the recent
explosion. . , ,
â  of the residents present declared
that if the board could not give their dis
trict protection they would petition to
join the city of Oakland to enjoy munici
pal benefits.
District Attorney Snook .rendered an
(.pinion to the effect that the Supervisors
could not hinder a reconstruction.
It was finally decided that all parties in
terested in the matter meet next Tuesday
at 10 a. m. in the board's rooms. The
Judson Dynamite Powder Company, Mcl-
ETuse Works and Judson Chemical
Works will be requested to be represented
at this meeting.
REV. FATHER M'AVOY
PASSES FROM EARTH
END OF ONE OF THE OLDEST
PRIESTS IN THE STATE.
For Over Twenty Years in Charge of
the Parish at San Leandro and
San Lorenzo.
For over twenty years Father McAvoy
has been in charge of a parish in this
priests in the State, died this evening at
the Clergy House at San Leandro.
For over twenty years Father McAvoy
! has been in charge of a parish In this
i county. When he was first placed in
; charge his parish Included San Leandro,
I San Lorenzo, Mt. Eden, Elmhurst, Red
wood Canyon and Haywards, but as the
territory became settled he had to be re
lieved of a large portion of it. Lately
his parish has consisted of the towns of
j San Leandro and San Lorenzo. The priest
j has grown up with the neighborhood and
was known and beloved throughout the
large territory over which he served.
Father McAvoy has been in ill health
: for a long time, and only a week ago he
resigned and was to- take a long rest. He
w;us preparing to go away when his final
attack of sickness came.
During his pastorate Father McAvoy
has rendered faithful service to his
I church. He has built a convent at San
L*-andro aond a church at San Lorenzo. Ho
also was made the beneficiary of much
valuable property which, it Is said, he
willed to the Archbishop for the use of
the church. Father McAvoy was also ac
tive in civic work. He subscribed to and
was an active advocate of the cannery at
San Leandro. He saw that there were
many vacant houses in his parish and he
desired to fill thf-m and he never tlrfd of
making the argument that the most per
manent way to improve the town would
be to establish manufactures that would
provide work.

OAKLAND, Aug. 11.â Mary L. Wheeler,

THE SA:Sr FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 12, 1898.
SOCIETY HAS
TAKEN SIDES
Meeks' Chinese Cook Is
Not Without Friends.
SOLDIERS TO STAND TRIAL
WILL SHIMAN AND HARRY
BAKER MUST EXPLAIN.
Objected to Being Shot by a Kodak
and Are Charged With Break
ing a Chinaman's
Leg.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 11.
Society at San Ijcandro Is considerably
i disturbed over a preliminary examination
j for felony that Is to be held next Satur
â¢ day before Judge Qutnn. The prisoners
are Will Shiman and Harry Baker, and
they are charged with willfully and felon
iously attacking a Chinaman, to wit, the
cook of the Meek family, and breaking his
leg.
Will Shiman and Harry Baker come
from two of the best-known families In
the interior of the county. Mr. Shiman.
I Sr. is an old rancher who is credited with
j being comparatively wealthy. His family j
Is one of the leading ones of this county I
and William and Harry Baker are two
social lights. When the present war
broke out nothing would satisfy these
young men but to enlist in the Eighth
California Regiment, now stationed at
Camp Barrett. Lasjt Sundiiy the young
privates were granted a leave of absence
and went to San Lorenzo Junction on
their way home. While at the Junction
the Chinese cook came along on his wheel.
The Meek cook is a very intelligent, well
educated Chinaman. He is Americanized j
to a degree, even to the point of being a
kodak fiend. On the day mentioned the
cook went oiu with his kodak intending
to take some pictures. At San Lorenzo j
Junction he met the two privates from i
Camp Barrett. Just what transpired !d
somewhat doubtful, and will be told under
oath before Judge Quinn next Saturday.
The Chinaman .^iys ho was wheeling j
peacefully by when the two young sold- |
fers upset him, beat him, threw him down
and broke his leg. He la now in a hospital
with his broken limb in splints, but ho [
swore to a warrant charging Shiman ana
! Baker with the crime.
The boys were released on bonda of j
$1000 each, and Attorneys Nye * Kinsell |
and Frank Brtarty have been engaged to
defend them. The Chinaman has been
with the Monk family many years, and
his employers have expressed ti.> ir deter
mination to press the case, and if It <
should appear to be one of cruelty no lon- â¢
lency will be shown on the 'part of the
f>rosecution. and the Chinaman will not
ack for special counsel to take care of his ,

OAKLAND HAS SCORED
AN IMPORTANT POINT
MAP SHOWING THE WATER
FRONT OF EARLY DAYS.
Evidence Introduced in the Famous
Suit That Carries With It Great
Weight.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Aug. 11.
Evidence was admltte 1 in the water
front case to-day that tw trs wry strongly
Dn the question of street openings through
the disputed territory In 1868. The admis
sion of the map in question Is a (Strong
point on behalf of the city of Oakland,
for it shows the dedication of certain
West Oakland streets and opens the way
to the other exhibits which establish the
city's claim to other streets. The exhibit
Is a copy of the one filed with the County
Recorder in IXC4, and bears the Indorse
ment of A. M. Church, then County Re
corder. It Is a plat of land kn><wn an
Oakland Point, at the old railroad ferry
landing, and describes certain land near
Willow street, along which the Alameda
local now runs.
Attorney A. A. Moore mule strenuous
objections against the introduction of the
map, and later, when it wms being used
as the basis for Engineer Sforgan's testi
mony, more objections were made. Judge
Ogden, however, ruled in favor of the city
on ail points.
The importance of this evidence is very
marked, because under the decision of the
Supreme Court the city of jOakhU d is en
titled to all streets through water front
property which hnd ever been dedicated
to public use. The map is said to prove
that several of these streets were dedi
cated prior to 1868.
W R Davis, who is making such a
strong fight on behalf of trie city, assorts
that Oakland will probably establish her
claim to streets opened to low-water mark
along that strip of territory extending
from Market street to the north arm of
the estuary. The city's attorneys also
hope to establish the city's right to Ado
line street and a number of streets in
West Oakland.

FOUGHT FOR
TWENTY YEARS
Ole Madsen Loses His
Wife and Home.
A NEAT LEGAL SKIRMISH
TROUBLE ALL CAUSED BY A
QUARREL OVER TITLE.
She Lost Her Property by Careless
ness and Regained It Through
Her Husband's Negli
gence.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 11.
Twenty-seven years of married life,
twenty of which according to the
testimony have been passed in fighting.
Very few complaints in the Alameda
courts contain such a history of alleged
Inhumanity as that of Caroline Madsen
against her husband.
Not only has Ole lost his wife, but ;
he has also lost that which he seemed
to prize a great deal more â the home at :
Eighteenth and Market streets. In the
recovery of his home a very interesting
legal battle was conducted. In the first
place Mrs. Madsen lost the property le- â 
gaily by allowing the statute to lapse. \
Then 010 lost the property legally by j
his attorneys failing to include In their
complaint the fact that the lapsing of
the statute had caused the property to
revert to him.
The two suits for divorce and for the
property hinge ontt on the other, and in
the latter more personality and more in- '
side history of their quarter of a cen- '
tury of married unhappiness came out !
than In the divorce stiit. The testimony
showed that soon after their marriage :
.Mrs. Madsen gave Ole $3000 with which
to buy a homo. After five years she
learned that the property stood in her :
husband's name. Then their trouble com- |
roenced. and they have been lighting j
since 1877 over the $3000 house that was;
bought with her money.
Mrs. Madsen intended to bring suit
to assert her personal right, but she
permitted her husband to induce her
to take no action und finally she found
that the time had passed in which she
could seek redress. Madsen filed hU suit
to quiet the title in himself, but in his
complaint he failed to show the main
point of his contention. Attorney Fry,
on beJfalf of Mrs. Madsen, objected to the ;
plaintiff bring allowed to amend his com
plaint a second time, and made a novel i
argument that as the woman had lost j
the property by her own carelessness
and had regained it through the care
lessness of her husband it would be in
consistent on the part of the court to
take sides. Judge Greene took the saracj
view, and granted the woman the prop- ,
erty as he had previously granted the
decree of divorce.
BELIEVE IT WAS CALKINS.
He Was the Boy Who Jumped From
the Oakland Boat.
BERKELEY Aug. 11.â The family of
Charles Calkins, the missing schoolboy,
have reached the conclusion that the sul
ctde who Jumped from the ferry Tues
day morning was the lost lad. It has
... learned that the youth took the
T.I- urruph-avenue cars Tuesday morn
â  half-past 8 and got off at Four
teenth street. This would Rive him Just
time enough to walk to Franklin street
and take the narrow gauge train which
connected with tne boat upon which the
tragedy occurred.
A friend of the Calkins family took
the boy's picture to Alameda and showed
it to Mrs. Smith, the Witness of the jump,
who positively identified it as a likeness
of the suicide. When it was also ascer
tained that tii" description of the cloth-
Ing of the two as identical, the mother
and brothers of the lost boy gave up all
and now are certain that he was
the unfortunate.
The mystery of the death Is the ab
of any reason for the act. It Is
attributed to temporary insanity, it
having been his habit to moan and cry
cut in his Bleep of late. A schoolmate
to-day Informed his teacher that a week
oj s<Â»' ago young Calkins was struck bo
:ly on the head with a ba
while at piny in the yard that he was
knocked down and stunned. After this
1,,. i-,,i been noticed to have been dull
and listless. This probably so aiTected
his mind that he wandered away on
Tuesday and took a means of ending his
Tho deceased was well liked by all ac
quaintances for his cheery manner and
Bunny disposition. Many of his friends
refuse to believe that he made away
with himself, but rather think he has
gone to join .the army.

SECOND BRIGADE REVIEW
Fifty- First lowa, First Tennes-
see and Twentieth Kansas
Make a Fine Showing.
Major General Merriam reviewed the
Second Brigade of the Philippine Island?
expeditionary forces at 10 o'clock yes
terday morning upon the golf grounds of
the Presidio reservation. Hundreds of
Interested people witnessed the review.
The Second Hripade was under the com
mand of Brigadier General Charles King,
aad that distinguished olucer has every |
right to feel proud of the men whom he j
has the honor to command, for the Fifty
first lowa, First Tennessee and Twen
tleth Kansas regiments made a showing
that has not been surpassed by any vol
teers now in the service.
In addition to Generals Merriam and
King and their respective staffs. General
Marcus P. Miller and staff were also
present. Lieutenant Colonel Stacpole of
the First New York, and a number of j
prominent National Guard officers like- j
â wise witnessed the review. First Lieu
tenant Floyd W. Harris, adjutant of the
Fourth United States Cavalry, and for
merly military attache for the Govern- '-
ment at the court of Belgium, was in the ;
reviewing party.
General Merriam was attended byTroop
B Fourth United States Cavalry, under
First Lieutenant Lockwood, in the ab- :
senco of First Lieutenant John M. Neall, ,
as an escort of honor, and his presence
was further recognized by a salute from !
the guns at Port Point. "When the gen- '
eral and staff arrived the regiments were :
formed In line of masses on the brow of
the hill facng Camp Merritt. with lowa
on the right, Tennessee in the center and !
Kansas on the left. The reviewing
party first rode around the brigade, after
which each regiment, headed by its band,
passed in review before Generals Mer
riam, Miller and King in columns of com
panies, and afterward in columns of
fours. ,
At the conclusion of the review Gener
als Merriam and Miller complimented
General King both on the appearance and
thÂ© condition of his brigade. The an
nouncement made to the brigade by Gen
eral King that it would be sent to Ma
nila as soon as the necessary transports
could be secured caused the wildest ex
citement, and the regiments cheered their
commanding officer to the echo.

A School Girl Missing.
The disappearance of an 8-year-old school
girl from the residence of her parents, 735
Broadway, is causing much anxiety. The
child, I,upe Saucedo. Is the Btepdaugh
ter of Secundino Soto. She attended
stepdaughter of Seeundino Soto. She
the Broadway Grammar School on Mon
day last. On her return from school at
3 o'clock pho went out on the street to
play. Since then she has not been seen.
)l< r parents have made diligent Beach for
her but so far nothing- has been ascer
tained as to her whereabouts.

SHIPS FOR THE
SOUND TRADE
Improved Steamer Serv

TRIED TO END HER LIFE
A COLORED WOMAN ATTEMPTS
TO JUMP OVEBBOARD.
Jules Hansen, an ex-Sailor and Now
a Soldier, Causes Trouble on
the Water Front â Notes
Here and There.
There is to be a semi-weekly steamer
Bervice between San Francisco und Puget
Sound ports in the near future. The 3'a
clric Coast Steamship Company has been
contemplating the change for some time,
but the opening of the war and the con-
Bequent withdrawal of the steamers Sen
ator and City of Puebla delayed the mat
ter. The steamer Corona will Ije rÂ» ;,<s>â¢ for
service In a few days, however, and as
soon as she is put In commission the new
schedule will commence.
The Corona, it will be remembered, ran
ashore while on her way from Dyea and
Skaguay, but she was afterward got off
the beach and patched up. Temporary re
pairs were made at Seattle and the
steamer came to San Francisco and has
been overhauled at the Union Iron Works.
When completed she will go on the south
ern run, taking: the place of the Santa
Itosa. The latter vessel will be put on
the Puget Sound route and will run in
conjunction with the Umatllla, Walla
Walla and Queen. Steamers will leave
San Francisco Wednesday and Saturday
of each week and will arrive at Victoria,
B. C. each Monday and Friday and Seat
tle every Tuesday and Saturday. Return
ing the steamers will leave Seattle every
Sunday and Thursday, arriving here ev
ery Wednesday and Sunday. The return
of the Senator and City of Pueblo, will
make a change in the vessels of the Sound
Beet, but it will make no change In the
sailing days. The increase in the passen
ger and freight business between San
Francisco and Puget Sound ports has
made the addition of another vessel to the
fleet an solute necessity.
The schooner Hattie Phillips, which
brought the Blackburn party of Klondik
ers from Gloucester, Mass., has been sold
to W. Loanza & Co., for Mexican parties.
The vessel is at present in Oakland Creek,
but she is to be pulled out to-day and
overhauled, after which she will be put
under the Mexican flag. The Phillips will
be engaged in trade on the Mexican coast.
The British bark West York will get
away for Sydney, X. S. W., to-day. The
trouble over her deckload of lumber has
been adjusted. The captain of the bark
was willing to allow 25.000 feet of lumber
on the deck, but the charterers wanted to
put double that quantity aboard, so the
matter ended In none at all being taken.
The members of the State Typograph
ical Union are to make an excursion
around the bay to-morrow. They have
secured the tug Governor Markham from
the Harbor Commissioners and will leavo
Mission-street wharf at 9 a. m. All
points of interest on the bay will be vis
ited. *.
The river steamer Zinfandel is kept very
busy these days. Napa County Is sending
out more products than any other place
in the State, and nearly all of it is coming
down by steamer. Yesterday the Zinfan
del brought down 22,000 gallons of win*
and a large consignment of hay, beside*
quantities of fruit. The Zinfandel trans
ers her hay to other river steamers and
most of It goes up the San Joaqutn and
Sacramento.
Jules Hansen, an ex-sailor, but now a
volunteer soldier, made considerable trou
ble on the front yesterday. He raised a
disturbance at Main and Harrison, and
Special Officer Fitzgerald had a great
time In securing him. He finally got him
tied up with some hay rope, and sent
to the Harbor Receiving Hospital for the
ambulance. At the hospital Hansen ran
amuck as soon as his bonds were severed.
He seized a chair and began chasing Drs.
Hill, Green and Zabala around the operat
ing table. Finally one of the doctors
tripped the crazy follow up, and in a few
minutes he was strapped to a cot. All
that could be rot out of him was that
his name was Jules Hansen, and that he
was a soldier, but had been a sailor.
The United States steamer Albatross
Bailed for Guatemala at 2 p. m. yester
day. She Will StOP at Acapulco for (â ..:â !
and will then hurry to San Jose. The
chances are that the rebellion in Guate
mala will be over by the time she reaches
Ban Jose. The departure Of the Alba- :
tross leaves Lieutenant J. 08. Gunn in
temporary command of the mosquito
fleet, and he is, in consequence, the proud
est man afloat. He will be relieved of his
authority when the gunboat Bennington
comes down from Mare Island.
Edith Quinn (or, Sadie Stanley), a col
ored woman, attempted to commit suicide
from the ferry steamer Piedmont yester
day morning. Charles Nelson, one of the
deckhands, saw her and frustrated the at
tempt. When the Piedmont landed her
passengers on this side Miss Quinn was
turned over to Sergeant Mahoney. who
took her to the Harbor Police station.
She promised Captain Dunleavy that she
would not again attempt to commit sui
cide, so he let her go, but told Officer
Charles Callahan to keep a lookout for
her. Soon after this Callahan saw her
at Clay-street wharf, getting ready to
jump into the bay again. He put her un
der arrest, and acting under instructions j
from Captain Dunleavy took her to the
new City Hall, where *he will be exam
ined by the Insanity Commissioners. Miss
Quinn has a brother working on the
steamer Newark.
Captain Tom Lockyer came back to San
Francisco from Seattle on the bark Ger
mania yesterday. Since he left here In
command of the steamer "Whltelaw, Tom ,
has been in a peck of trouble. He was
bound for Dyea and Skaguay with Klon
dikers, and the passengers rose in revolt
over the provisions, and mode him put I
into Port Angeles. There was more trou- '<
ble at Skaguay. and to crown all, the
"W'hitelaw caught fire and was burned to
the water's edge. Lockyer lost every
thing he had in the world in the blaze and
has been In hard luck ever since. Tom is
a first-class navigator and one of the best
known tugboat men in California. He has
a host of friends, and all of them sym
pathize with him in this ill turn of for
tune's wheel

disappeared from their usual haunts soon
;iftÂ» r the fatal shots were fired.
No one could be found who witnessed
the deed.
The report of the pistol shots was
heard coming from the end of the K>iiK
wharf, where the picturesque boats of the
fishermen He, by sonu- boys who wore
lounging near. A moment after the
crouching form of a man was seen =link-
Ing sway in the darkness and disappear
ing in the tortuous alleyways at the base
of Telegraph Hill.
Ikying half concealed behind a pile of
boat gear was the body of the murder
er's victim. There was a gaping bullet
wound, scarred with powder burns, al
most.in the center of the forehead, nnd a
portion of the upper lip waa torn away,
marking the track (ft the other bullet
lired by the assassin.
Tightly clutched in the right hand of
the murdered "man was a long, thin, keen
edged dagger, whose blade glistened In the
glint of the lantern, carried by the f< w
who rushed to the end of the wharf to
Investigate the cause of the shooting.
A murder had taken place and the mur
dered man apparently had some knowl
edge that his life whs in clanger Just be
fore the fatal shot was fired. The
ence of the dagger clutched In the life
lingers told plainly that when the
foe was met it was a duel to the deaih.
I'ntll late this morning the police were
divided in opinion as to whether the mur
der was the result of a quarrel or whether
the killed man, knowing an enemy was
waiting to kill him, drew his dagger and
prepared to sell his^ life as dearly as pos
sible.
Life was not extinct when the murdered
man waa first found and word was sent
to the Harbor Hospital, but before the
ambulance was started on the way, it
waa recalled and the morgue wagon sent
for.
The news of the murder =oon spread
around the colony of fishermen, who live
near the wharf, and before the police ar
rived the body was surrounded by grief
stricken relatives of the dead man.
It was a heartrending sight. In the dim
light of the lantern the wailing relatives
of the murderer's victim knelt around the
body, and when the police arrived they
fought for the possession of the' remains.
Mothers with babes in their arm;!, men
frenzied by the death of their friend,
brothers and sisters crazed with grief,
fought back the men who would deprive
them of the body of their loved one.
Sergeant Cook and Officers Donohuo,
MoGowan and Gwin were bustled about
like so many shuttlecocks h-"- tho fre zjed
le, and' it took them nearly an hour
to convey the body of the murdered man
from the wharf. On the arrival of the
Morgrue wagon the howls were renewed.
and the struggle grew intense. The wife
and sisters of Scraffino knelt beside his
dead body beating their breasts in grief.
while the brothers, with hands and faces
covered with the blood that was oozing
out of the wounds of the dead man,
struggled for possession. The rfflcers
pushed them back, and as the receiving
coffin was placed alongside the body it
was kicked out of the wny. Again it
was brought close to the body by Depu
ties Hallett and Smith ami the body hur
riedly thrown into it. but again it was
thrown out by stricken relatives, who
tried to drag the remains to their homo
and nt the .same time fight off the police
and the Coroner's deputies. The peace
officials again tried to drive away the
frenzied friends and relatives of the mur
dered fisherman, anu thin tlmo they were
successful in getting the body into the
box and in the Morgue wagon.
At the home of the murdered man
women were lying on the floor, beating
thfÂ»lr heads against the wall?, wailing and
Fobbing, while the men, exhausted from
their struggles, rested their heads on their
arms and sobbed bitterly.
Scraffino was but 27 years old and ha^
only been married a few weeks. His bride
was a pretty girl whom he brought from
Italy on tho Ist of July. He loved her in
tho "land of olives, and when he had by
dint of hard work become the owner of
his own crab-boat he sent for her.
Some of the friends who were at the
wedding of the young couple say that the
murder was committed by a Jealous rival,
who. mad with love for the young girl,
followed her from her native land but ar
rived after the marriage ceremony had
been performed, and in his wrath wreaked
his vengeance by taking the life of tho
happy husband.
The police, however, who care little for
romance, were hunting last night for a
brother-in-law. Antonio Gulseppi, who
answers the description given of the
crouching figure that waa seen slinking
away from the wharf after the fatal shot
was fired. Guiseppi was absent from his

away from ih<- scene of the crime are

streets, and \\ . Smith, whose home

The murderer was also seen running

They describe the murderer as wearing

SHIRKED THEIB, DUTY.
Police Judges Compelled to Deal
With "Drunks'' in a Proper
Manner.
Captain Seymour and the Police Judges
had a meeting yesterday morning that
promised ;it first to be a stormy one, but
finally ended in a proper understanding
for future business.
The "drunks" have hern In the habit
of not bfing taken before a Judge , but
Sergeant Wolf of the City Prison without
authority has been constituting himself
a Judge, and every morning discharging
them or dealing with them as the fancy
struck him.
Oiptain Seymour happened to drop into
the prison Wednesday morning and was
astonished when he saw. his subordinate
holding court over the "drunks." He ask
ed for an explanation and at once gave
orders that the drunk cases should be
assigned to the courts the same as the
other cases. The result was that yes
tterday morning each court had its share
of the "drunks." Hence the meeting.
The Judges agreed to take week about
to be at the prison at 9:30 o'clock each
morning to dispose of the cases, and the
friction was over.
YOUNG MEN'S INSTITUTE.
The Grand Body Will Meet in San
Jose on the 29th Inst.â The
State of the Order.
The next session of the Grand Council
of the Young Men's Institute of Califor
nia will be held In San Jose, commencing
on the 29th of the current month.
The grand officers are at this time pre
paring for the great event, and the mem
bership in the Garden City is arranging
for the proper reception of the delegates
i)ii<l their entertainment during the ses-
Bion.
During the past year the order has lost
two councils and has added two â No. 508
in this city and No. 520 in Redwood City.
The membership at this time is about
the same as it was at the time of the pre
vious .session of the grand body, but there
haa been a marked gain in its finance.
From the several reports that have been
received from the entire jurisdiction it
appears that the prospects for a notable
Increase during the coming year are very
bright.
Land Office Records Destroyed.
The lire at Susanvllle, Lassen County,
I which, acording to the dispatches to The
i Call yesterday, destroyed the larger part
of the town, has thrown the local office
of the United States Surveyor General in
to confusion. Surveyor General Gleaves
yesterday received information that the
fire had destroyed the Land Office of the
unfortunate town and all of the land
records had been consumed in tho blaze.
This will make It necessary for his office
force to furnish certified copies of all the
records and plats and other data relating
to the lands In the northeastern part of
the State. Certified copies of the land en
tries will have to be obtained from Wash
ington. Mr. Gleaves believes that he will
have to increase hia force, and that even
then it will take at least six months to
finish the extra work caused by the de
struction of the Susanville records.

Patrick Burke, the brother of the dead
lieutenant, was present ana listened with
interest to the proceedings.
Robert Graham, who conducts a store
near the scene of the shooiing, testified
that he telephoned to the police, as he
feared that Haynes intended to kill some
body. After Lieutenant Burke arrived he
I cautioned him against Jiaynes, as he be
| lieved he would not hesitate to shoot the
officer. Burke replied that he was aoie
to take care of himself, and at once
staried for the tinker's cabin.
Robert Cole, the next witness, said that
he was Informed by a friend that there
was trouble at Haynes' cabin. He started
for the place and immediately afterward
Lieutenant Burke drove up In the patrol i
wagon. Wilkinson and Kennedy were
standing a short distance from the cabin.
The witness declared that he heard
Burke address Haynes, asking him to
surrender, otlicer Marlowe atooa on Peral
ta avenue, and when Burke was shot he
emptied his revolver at Haynes, but
failed to bring him down. Contrary to
his testimony in the Police Court, the
witness declared that Marlowe did not
retnat alter Burke had been shot down.
Cole admitted that he was on friendly
terms with .Marlowe, but denied that he
had been Influenced by him to swar that
he had not acted in a cowardly manner.
The witness also saw Kennedy and \\ !l- ,
i klnson tire at Haynes. They were a con
i siderable distance away, and made only
| a faint attempt to avenge the murder of
! the brave ofhcer.
John Hopkinson, who lives about B<
ty-flve f<-<-t from Haynes' cabin, testified
that he telephoned to the police tint the
.-ir;;tU- tink.-r was on the warpath.. Wil
kinson and Kennedy subsequently ap- â 
i peared, and, afn r learning the cause > t
the trouble, proceeded to arrest Eiaynes.
Kennedy went to the tatter's cabin and
rapped "fur admittance. Haynes threw
open the door and placing his revolver
under Kennedy's nose ordered him to "get
out." Kennedy lost no tun.- in complying '
with his reqaest, and walking over to
! Wilkinson he told him of his reception.
Wilkinson then essayed to arrest the mur
derous tinker, but when Haynes aimed
bis revolver ai him he promptly took to
his heels. A few minutes later Burke ap
peared and was warned by the witness to
look out for Haynes. as he was a dan- 1
man. The brave lieutenant replied i
that lie was able to take care of himself, |
and at once started tor Hnynes' cabin, i
After he had been shot Marlowe and Ken- :
nedy retreated to a place of safety and
began shooting at Haynes. Wilkinson got !
behind his house and blazed away at the ]
tinker. Marlowe, after emptying his re
v< Iver, called for somebody to take
Burkes body away, as he was afraid to
do it himself. Mr. however, announced ;
! that he would "cover the door" to prevent
i the murderer from getting away. Hop
kinson then recounted how Haynes, who
was his neighbor, fired two shots at him â¢
! a short time prior to the killing of Burke.

MADE THE HIT OF HIS LIFE
Fell During His Act ; Caught in a Chandelier and Bounded on
the Stage, With Smiles and Bows, Amid a Shower
of Broken Glass.
TORA. a little Japanese who performs on the end of a long: pole that Is
balanced on the shoulder of his acrobatic partner, Mizuna. at ths Co
lumbia Music Hall at Eddy and Mason street!;, turned an accident, that
for fi moment looked as though It might be serious. Into a pretty flnalo
of their wonderful balancing feat that brought him fame.
The stage of the music hall was not intended for acrobatic exhibitions
and down the center of It hangs a large and glittering chandelier contain
ing a myriad incandescent lights. The Royal Tokio acrobats, of which
Tora is a member, came to the city without having first secured an en
gagement at any of the regular amusement places where such perform
ances are specialties, and they tqok the first opening that was offered. In
their pole balancing feats the acrobats are obliged to dodge all around the
chandelier.
On Wednesday night little Tora was squirming about on the end of tho
balanced pole, twenty-five feet in the air, apparently enjoying himself and
amazing the audience, when Mizuna, who was balancing the pole on his
shoulder, slipped. The pole began to totter and Mizuna was unable to
save the little fellow on the top of it from a fall. Some ladies in the audi
ence screamed and men shuddered at the impending catastrophe. Tora
felt the pole going from under him but he retained his presence Oi mind,
and with a graceful swing Jumped for the chandelier. It was about fifteen
feet from the floor of the stage. There was a crash as he landed among
the incandescent lights and smashing glass fell in a shower about the head
of Mizuna. Tora was unhurt, but the chandelier was a wreck. The littlo
Jap waved his hand reas.*>>ringly at the audience, then, with a swing, he
bounded from his perch and turning a somersault as he went through the
air, landed smiling and bowing in the middle of the stage. The frightened
Mizuna hugged the lad in his delight at his escape from injury, while the
men cheered and the women wept in their gladness.
ANOTHER NATIVE DAUGHTER CHOSEN
MISS EVA DENNISON of Sacramento, Who Will
ADDear in "Trilbu."
The latest aspirant to histrionic honors from California, which has fur
nished more than its quota of prominent actresses to the stage, is Miss
Eva Dennison of Sacramento. She has been engaged by Manager T. Daniel
Prawley, and will make her first professional appearance in the revival
of "Trilby," to be given at the Columbia next week. Miss Dennison Is the
daughter of Dan Dennison, the well-known horseman of the capital city,
and who was at one time actively engaged In business in San Francisco.
Miss Dennison is young, petite and graceful, and has an attractive person
ality. Furthermore, she is self-possessed, and if she fulfills the promise
of her amateur work will prove an acceptable addition to the list of profes
sionals.
The young lady will appear as Honorine, and her friends expect her
to do justice to their estimation of her abilities.
Burkp'g body had been taken away by
CasÂ»hel, the " patrol wigon driver, she]
a boy call to one of the officers to
.nit' 1 as everything was all right. 'â 
Tin- officer then emerged from her yard.
,! a pistol in his right hand. The
a was unable to Identify any of the
policemen >h.- saw leaving her yard. i
Miss Nellie Johnson tnstilied she heard i
Cashel call to the scampering policemen
to assist him in taking Lieutenant Burkes
body out of the range of fire. Jsot any or
them resp< Caahel was com-;
pelled to do the work unassisted. Further
bearing In the ease was continued until i
o'clock this evening.
During the proc< -dings Chief Lees vain
ly att< tnpted to shield the accused officers. I
His questions to the witnesses were to
show thai the men did not desert Burke,
but that the latter had acted in a fool
hardy manner.
BAD SCHOOL FACILITIES.
Residents of Noe Valley Indignant
Over the Actions of the
School Board.
Residents of Noe Valley are indignant
over the manner in which the School
Board has provided for the children in
that district. At the last meeting of the
board, prior to adjournment for the an
nual vacation, a committee from tho West
of Castro-street Improvement Club ap
peared and culled attention to the fact
that the present school building is not
large enough by half to accommodate the
children of the district. They also point
ed out a building conveniently located,
which Is large enough to accommodate all
the children turned away from the regu
lar schoolhouae. A promise was made
that this, or some other building, would
;ted to accommodate the overflow.
Instead of keeping to their promise, how
ever, tf 1 >_- members of the board rented
seven small buildings scattered tirough
out the district, each of which was large
â ] to accommodate one cl.ips and the
result is that the children are scattered all
through the district. Jt is also said that
tho sanitary condition of many of the
buildings is very bad and they are alto
gether unfitted for occupation as schools.
