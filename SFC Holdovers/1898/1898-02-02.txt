Their Accusers.
There have been so many charges
of fraud lodged against the present
'Board of Supervisors that the Grand
Jury his little time for any other
business than the investigation of
alleged crimes committed by the city's
lawmakers.
V?e stormcloud of accusation has
now so focalized that the following
four matters are pending and will be
investigated in the order named :
First â Charges now lodged before
the Grand Jury to the effect that Su- ;
pervisor Delany tried to blackmail
the Society for Prevention of Cruelty
fro Animals.
Second â The charges of John Her
get (Young Mitchell) that Super
visor Haskins sought a bribe of two
hundred and fifty dollars before he
â¢would favor the issuing of permits
for a boxing contest. In this con
nection the charge that Ned Lanigan
is the broker of members of the
board when privileges are for sale
â will be investigated.
Third â The entire board will be
brought before the indicting body if
they do not decide the fender ques
tion by the 14th of this month.
Fourth â The board and the city
architect will be" brought before the
jury and disciplined for illegal con
duct and gross negligence in the
building of the new Hall of Justice.
â â â¦ â
Young Mitchell's charges of corrup
tion against Supervisors, published ex
clusively in The Call j-esterday, were
the talk of the city.
So far-spreading was the interest in
this grave matter that The Examiner,
little as it loves The Call, induced
Young Mitchell to make an affidavit
that The Call story was the truth and
nothing but the truth. But Mitchell
also says there is more. He says he
has cards up his sleeve and that the
truth has not half been told.
"Let the Grand Jury call upon me
and they will get it all, for they have
Vhe right to ask questions. There are
â  thers who can tell an interesting story
if they dare come out and tell the
whole case as it is."
The Grand Jury will bring the matter
up without delay and give Mitchell and
others an opportunity to do all they
can to throw light on the methods of
the committees involved.
The Call's account of the matter will
be brought before the body to-day.
In sporting circles the charges made
by Mi;<~hell were apparently no sur
prise, for scores of well known lovers
of glove- contests had heard them made,
and there seems to have long been a
genera! understanding that "something
was doing" with the bupy members of
the Committee on Health and Police,
which is said to have looked strictly
after the welfare of its own members.
Seen in reference to the charges yes
terday Mr. Herget said:
"I simply repeat my charges and
say that I have not made the case as
bad as it is. Haskins may make all
the denial he wants to, but the facts
are as I state them. They wanted the
earth and I simply got tired of being
Imposed upon. If the jury will call
upon some other people whose names
1 will give them they may get some
strong facts to aid them in their in
vestigations."
Supervisor Haskins made the fol
lowing statement relative to the serious
charges against his integrity as an offi
cial:
"There is not one particle of truth
in the charges against me. No offer of
*.oney was made, and if one had been
the request for a permit would never
have been brought before the commit
tee. This matter dates back to the
time when Mitchell put in an applica
tion for a permit in the Griffo-Lavigne
n>bc He asked me to put In the peti

tion for him, and as I have known him
since boyhood I did so, and I asked that
the permit be granted. Delany 6p
posed the matter because he said he
understood that Griffo had been in
some drunken brawls in the East and
had been ordered out of various cities.
He said we did not need that kind of
cattle here, but I did all I could for
Young Mitchell. I told him I would
vote for the petition, but he said that
would not do, as it would have to be
reported on by the committee. â 
"I suppose Mitchell: was mad because
his last permit was not granted, but
that was largely because of the fake
Walcott-LavJgne fight. It was not. I,
but Captain Delany whr> took his mnt
ter away fmm the committee and
changed the dates because there was a
conflict. Another point I want to make
"All that I have said is true.
There is much more to tell, and
there are others who could speak
if they dared to tell the truth.
I have known Haskins a long
time, and I know no good of
him, either. The whole gang
are as crooked as a ram's horn.
I never visited Haskins' place
but once. If the telephone com
pany keeps a record of its mes
sages it can be shown that it
was from there that I tele
phoned to Ned Lanigan regard
ing what it would cost me to
get the permit. They threw me
down hard. I didn't kick then,
but when it comes to stamping
on me after I am down I draw
the line."â YOUNG MITCHELL,
(JOHN HERGET), in an inter
view.
I is that I. have not been rubber-necking
around his place, as he states it, but he
; has been coming down here." \ '-"r : ':'-'' v
The Grand Jury has been dogging v
I the footsteps of â  the Supervisors for
\ weeks on the car-fender : question and
j has decided to indict the body if they
I do not act on the propositions involved
; In the fender controversy by! the 14th
i of this month, the time specified by
themselves as the . limit of ' time ; re
quired to complete the investigation. v
It is generally understood that the
railroad company stands V ready â ; to :
adopt any fender ' suggested by the
Board of Supervisors, and that, they
will put the designated fenders on the
cars as soon as the ordinance requiring
j them to do so. is passed. Committee-
I men from the Grand Jury have been
j urging the Supervisors daily, and the
j lawmakers have made many excuses
| and many promises. : First Dr. Clinton ;
was away in Europe. Then somebody
else was ill, and next there was a de
sire to humor every crank who had a
scheme.: The jurors, however,. are ask
i ing whether there is an attempt on the
part of the board to "shaked own" the
owners of fenders before they pas*, a
law on the subject.
Another matter that Is urgent is the
completion of the Hall of Justice.
> There has ben a hitch, they say, be
tween the Supervisors arid the city: ar- :
chitect, who refuses to proceed on the:
plans and under the instructions : of
the board. If something is not done
soon both the architect and the Su
pervisors are to be called before the :
Jury and forced to give: explanations 1 ;
that will be ; satisfactory, or explain to
a ; trial Jury after indictment for mis
feasance in office. 1 : : ;.; ;. ,:::/;;

The Parafflne Paint Company brought an Injunction suit against the
State Harbor Commission to restrain them from awarding contract for .
the treatment of piles to :be used In the construction of the Green- '*
street wharf, and against awarding contract for the treatment *
for preservation of piles to be used by the. board during the ensuing 3
year. The company avers it was the lowest bidder In a fair competition, <S
and that it brings the action toy enforce-". acknowledgment of Its fights, <Â«
on the ground of fraud and collusion bftwe^n th<"> commission and Â
the San FrVncisro Timber Preserving -.Company to favor the latter.
The last-namr-d company appears to be one of a number of private .
concerns doing business under corporative titles with the commission.
P. P. Dundoh, S E. Slade and Darby Laydon are the managers of the
combination.
It is shown by the records that contracts awarded them concealed the <â¢
manipulation of- prices and the payment for materials. <$
It is shown that the State is suffering losses in consequence of con- j
tracts persistently awarded the combination.
â  It is shown that, the hooks of Darby Laydon & Co. were doctored be- *
fore having been taken into court. Even then they disclosed the fact that
money had been paid regularly to Patterson, the construction superintend- J
ent of the board, for having done "secret service" for the firm. Many im- J
portant books of the combination have disappeared. The witnesses who 4
should remember all about the business done by the contract pool with 4
the commission have lost their memories aa to these matters. <s
It has been brought out that materials have been paid for, to at least <j
one pool company, without having been delivered.
It has been proved that certain injunction actions brought against the *
board, on grounds similar to those on which the Paraffine Company rests *
its case, were dismissed under an agreement whereby two high bidders
of the pool w-ere allowed to enjoy annual contracts for material which <3
they now dispose of as middlemen after receiving it from the contesting 4
Pine Lumber Company. <J
If the investigation went no further enough is now legally ascertained <j
to warn the Goyernor and the people that a pool of private operators en-
Joy especial advantages and profits in their dealings with the Board of ,
State Harbor .Commissioners,
pieces. From the moment that she |
struck there was no possible chance for j
the members of the crew to save them- !
selves, as the rough sea rendered the
saving of life impossible. The body of j
one of the crew, a man about 35 years j
of age, was found this morning among
the wreckage. It was frozen to a
plank and was much disfigured.
In the business district it was nearly
noon when many employes reached!
their places of employment, all subur- j
ban trolley lines having been aban
doned at midnight and the steam rail
roads being unable to run more than
two or three suburban trains during
the forenoon. All through trains from ]
New York and the west, as well as !
those from the east, were from four to j
six hours late, and many did not get |
in until late In the afternoon. Tracks
vrere not only blocked with snow, but :
masses of broken poles and wires were
encountered at many places. To-night
the few trains moving are running
without a telegraphic service. The city j
arid suburbs are covered with broken
poles and tangled wires. Many horses
were killed in the streets by stepping
upon the end of telephone wires which
had fallen across the streets.
To-night the situation assumed such
a dangerous aspect that Mayor Quincy
ordered that none of the electric lights
be turned on except in districts where
the wires are underground. It will re-
quire weeks to restore the telephone
and telegraphic service. Not a single
telegraph wire out of Boston was in
operation all day, and the telephone
wires were in almost as bad condition, i
This afternoon a telephone service as
far as Worcester was established. The
wholesale and most of the business dis
tricts of the city were deserted all day.
The Stock Exchange was lifeless and
transactions were very limited.
Shipping in the harbor was damaged
Ereatly. and it is feared that many dis
asters to coast shipping will be report
ed when telegraphic communication ia
restored.
The center of the storm appeared to

Significant Revelations in
the Harbor Commis
sion Case.
Amazing Development of a
New and Undescribed
Mental Malady.
i â  . â  -. . .
CLASSED AS COLNONCITIS.
Proof That the Pacific Pine Com
pany Suits Were Dismissed
Com prom ise.
The peculiar malady introduced by
Chairman Colnon of the Harbor Com
mission into Judge Belcher's court is
apparently of a contagious nature. In
the lexicon of pathology it has not
found place as yet for want of proper
diagnosis. It haS some of the traits of
an involuntary cerebral infirmity indi
cated by the psychologic term meton
ymy; that is to say, a heedless and un
conscious impulsion to express the op
posite of what one means to utter. But
neither dread nor fear, nor intent to
cheat the truth is Involved with this
unsentient mental operation.
Metonymy is not a disorder communi
cated by one person to another; carried
about in old clothing, or conveyed by
over-ripe fruits or water surcharged
with microbir mysteries. How far the
Colnon epidemic may be traceable to
these channels of transmission science
has not hac'. time to determine.
Of the origin of the complaint, of its
pathological beginning, Mr. Colnon
himself has vouchsafed the best Inti
mation on the witness stand. His ex
planation was, a collapse of memory
from something like v- rtigo, the result
ant of which is a recurrence of collapse
of memory without the something like
vertigo attachment. Ever since the
stroke of something-like-vertlgo, hia
memory for "dates, names and se
quence of events," as Attorney Strat
ton developed by advisoi^ examination,
has been bad, in fact wretched, though
his "memory for principles" remains as
good as ever. As to the scope of the
latter mental facility of Chairman Col
non, the tortursome inquiries of the
Harbor Commission case affords no
light.
It does not appear from the testi
mony up to date that any of the suavo2
Chairman's successors in the witness
chair were attacked vertiginously,
' though nearly all of ; them bore.;
the unmistakable effects ;of the,
snmething-like-vertigo tragedy â  from
Which fee : suffers. While they were.;
not interrogated as to their -memory of
principles/'. they frankly, in fact enthu
â siasticaliyi -avowed failure of memory
: as ; to "name?, dates, sequence of.
events," causes, realities, combinations,
or any old thing of which the Court is
V anxious to gain knowledge. They sud
denly: manifested, indeed, to an alarm*
; ing degree, all the paretie symptoms of.:
\ Mr. Colon's affliction, without: making
any showing as to primary influence or.
â '.: provocation. Hence the conclusion that
Mr. Col^on's lamentable- condition is â /Â£ \
contagious one, likely to spread even
to greater magnitude before the pres
ent trial comes to a close.: ;. ; :; 'â :â â  'r : -
Granville M.Stewart, manager for the
â : Pacifies Pine Company, did not develop
as bad : a. case as other witnesses, for
after a long period of forgetfulness he
was persuaded that he did remember:
'. something about an agreement where
by the suits of his company against the
Harbor Commission were dismissed:
and that as a consequence), the Pacific
: Pine Lumber Company is now selling ; ;

which disposes of it to the commission

. One of those distressing revelations -,
that will mar Â«the ; placid course of in

came to the surface: Not -only had sev
eral books essential to a proper in
quiry into the contract transactions of

the Harbor Commission â  disappeared
from view and memory; principal wit- ;
nesses had slipped away into invisi
bility, among them the confidential
record-keeper of Dundon and Slade,
and the much wanted Mr, Darby Lay
don. Mr. Dundon himself had thought- :
fully obtained permission from j ; the
court to go out of town until Thurs
day. Finney the. bookkeeper was re- :
ported to have been taken seriously ill
three weeks ago, and is supposed to be ;
at Modesto, or somewhere. Heed, .the!

business affairs of the complicated

â . It was the purpose of counsel for the
Pafaffine Company yesterday to prove
that certain moneys were paid .; by.
Darby Laydon & Co. to Mr. Patterson,
the former superintendent of the.Har

ceived from the commission for piles
never delivered was "divided"; that the
books of Darby Laydon & Co. had been
"doctored," and that the suits of; the
Pacific Pine Company against 'the
board were dismissed in keeping with
an agreement whereby the Slade Lum
ber Company and the Darby Laydon &
Co. bureau of the Dundon-Slade pool
bought the materials they furnished

the Pacific Company. Though Attor
ney Stratton insisted that the evidence
produced was "irrelevant" and "sec^

The first witness on the stand was
young : Townley, formerly bookkeeper
for Darby Laydon & Co. It transpired
that he had not been discharged from
employment, as alleged, but that . he
had resigned to form the firm of Gal^
loway, Townsley & Co. They secured
a small contract for repairs on the
water front, and gave bond for its per
formance v after' having arranged for
implements and materials with which
to do the work. â ' The implements: and
materials, controlled by the Dundon-
Slade combination, were then refused
them; â  they failed .to- carry out their
contract in consequence, were; adjudged
liable for a penalty by the ; commission,
and suit for ' recovery was instituted
â¢ against their bondsmen. ;
The pile book ' which Townley kept
â  with others for. Darby ; Laydon -v & Co.
cannot be found. It; would show that
the firm Â«ojd ' to the commission â [ and
received pay .at regular Intervals â¢ for
piles never delivered. , For .-. example,'
when 5000 feet of piles were supposed
to have been delivered, and for which
: pay was received, only 4000 were deliv
ered, the pile ; book would show a gain
to the firm of 1000 feet of piles. ;It was
the peculations represented by these
figures that Townsley. testified were di
vided between the firm and l Patterson.
| The presumption is, and both the. rec
ord and the assertions coming from the.
Pacific pine Lumber : Company j bear : it ;

i . nect these very acts - with . the Commis
sioners at â  the present time; and ; the
statement was made by counsel, as I take
: it, in good faith. Now, I ask if a delivery
! of a less quantity of piles to Patterson,
;â¢ or. anybody else, if they intend to . bring
i that to the knowledge* or connivance or
i collusion of the present Commissioners,
who are defendants in this action? -' -
: Mr. Sullivan, we Intend if your. Honor
please, to prove circumstances '. from
which your Honor may. infer that certain
Commissioners were parties to the . fraud
perpetrated by Darby Laydon & Co. : .
; Mr. Strattonâ This is delightful for the
press, but I don't believe it is evidence of
any fraud that any inspector or superin
tendent of repairs took $10 in March, 1894.
, The courtâ l feel bound to say to coun
sel unless this proof is brought home in
some-fair way to the defendants thatâ
' Mr. Sullivanâ expect to bring it
home, as we state. It is very difficult in
cases of this kind to prove beyond any
question or knowledge/ ; â¢â¢â¢: â¢--... l ; 'â  -^ â¢â¢ ...

Mr. :.: Sullivanâ ; intend to introduce
circumstantial evidence. '. â â¢:'. .â¢â ?.. v* â¢
The courtâ But the circumstances must

and say you Intend to such a case-
Mr. Sullivanâ We intend to prove cir
cumstances which: would be â  inconsistent
on the part of certain Commissioners. ;:
The courtâ don't want this to run Into
merely a school for., scandal, of: course:
but I do intend to let the plaintiff prove
his case, ;if he can. ':â¢'.;â ;â  : '.-. â¢â¢â¢â¢..:â¢â ,.:.â¢: '.- :
â  Mr. Strattonâ l understand the ruling

I i with meat the present; time, nevertheless
! has reserved the right to â  strike out, and'
S : to â  that : extent, and so far as : the law is
concerned , save whatever rights .I â  have. .
But would appear as though simply -to
prove these isolated facts ;. and < without
any intentâ least- without any state
ment from counsel ;â¢ that he : has evidence .
which j will connect â  the , present Cpmniis-.
;,sioriers with it. or in some way make it
competentâ l ought to be. introduced, for :
the reason that I ; think:: that these. Com
missioners, as public officials, are en
titled to some consideration in so far as:
â  .the ' public â¢- attitude of .this .case; - is ; con- â 
â¢ cerned. : ; I . don't â  intend to try ; the : case >in
the newspapers, if your Honor : . please;
but, after all.the mere .fact that less piles
were delivered r than were called i : for by

spector; is taken in the public sense to be
somewhat evidence lof collusion and I dis
honesty on the part of all â  public officials
that may be even, remotely connected by
appointment, with v those particular per
sons. So, as I say, taking thatinto consid

to the evidence. I asked counsel if he in

to answer . the ,< statement â¢I . take it he

himself from a situation in which he
found neither entertainment nor In

was that he left court In company with
the Darby Laydon volumes of crypto
grams. .. ' .
: In the afternoon Mr. Chadbourne, a
member of the board, displaced Mr.
Harney, who has been a constant at
tendant at the side of Attorney Strat
ton. Mr, Chadbourne was concerned
about the disclosure made by Book
keeper Townley: as to moneys paid
the board in 1894, prior to Mr. Colnon's
appointment. One itexn of $300 was
identified under the letter "C," a pri
vate mark of the bookkeeper, and at
this point the investigation was cOn
nned, by the ruling of the court, to the
period comprehending the life of Chair
man Colnpn as a member, beginning in
March, 1895. The amount named, it
was testified, was paid to some mem
ber of the commission, and an intima
tion that '"Q" meant Chadbourne es
caped counsel fpr the Paraffine Com
pany. The name of another member
of that year has the same Initial, Mr.
Coles. tVhich one of the: two members

though he is certain he was Informed
the irioney was for one or the other,
George T. \y right; accompanied by
his client, S.:E. Slade, with more books,
sat all day in the jury box.
Books everywhere!
Mr: J. J, Keegan, secretary of the
Harbor Commission, sat; deferentially
in the rear of the court with the rec
ords of the board in his charge.
When recalled to the stand after re
cess it developed that ex-bookkeeper
Townley had acted as assignee for
Darby, Laydon & Co. several years ago
in actions for recovery. The cases
were entitled Darby Laydon & Co. vs.
City of Benicia, same vs. Sacramento
Bank, same vs. City and County of
San Francisco. Dundon was then a
silent partner of Darby Laydon & Co.
and Supervisor. For the purpose of
concealing his relations Townley was
requested to serve as assignee in pros
ecuting the claims. The one against the
city of San Friancisco was for the re
covery of about $8800 for work under a
contract secured to the firm of Mr.
Dundon, as Supervisor. Mayor EUert
held up the payment, hence the suit.
In all these cases Mr. Stratton ap
peared as attorney for Messrs, Laydon
and Dundon. or was consulted as Such.
Tovvnley afterward laid claim to col
lection In the suits for commission, and
in the case .of the judgment obtained
against the city of Benieia attempted
i to collect. Mr. McEnerney threatened
to ''make It hot for him" if he persist
ed, and on the advice of his attorneys
he abandoned the action.
The present bookkeeper for Darby
Laydon & Co., Mr. Reed, was recalled
and admitted that he made the erasures
and alterations in the firm books,
under the direction of Mr. Dundon. He
did hot know any of the " â attersons,"
but did know Mr, Patterson. He sub-
stituted the word "advertising" for
"Service" at the head of the secret ex
penditure page, but stuck to It in
spite of the rigid examination of coun
sel for the, Paraffine Company and Of
Judge Belcher; that he made the al
teration of his own volition, because he
wanted "to combine the two accounts"
He could not explain to the court satis
factorily why he had not opened
a separate account for the firm's ad
vertising, which is trifling; why he
did riot let the"servire" account stand
if his desire, as he averred, was to
save paper, and., place the advertising
account tinder its separate head-on the
same page; of why he had not indexed
the advertising account after having
erased '/service.."
lie: did not know what the "service"
account meant; never asked; didn't
want to know, and set : could hot ex
plain why he; had methodically eri
deayored to blind ( i" destroy it. There
was no other bookkeeper; he was the
only oxie. Wher pressed he did
. remern\be-r there â  '^'as. account
fin t named A* 2*. Finney, who has been
absent Sick for; three weeks at Mo
desto or thereabi ruts. Finney keeps
the: present pile record, but witness did
riot know where the previous one was
to be found. He did not know that it
ever had an existence. Judge Belcher
toasted the witness for a while and
their dropped him. '.:-â â 
The present pilebook disclcrsed an
item, "104 piles by recount." but the
witness could not tell Its meaning. He
knew of no record in existence show
ing measurement of piles delivered to
the Harbor Commission and the meas
urements charged. Reed's positive Ig
norance and. forgetfulne;ss made ex
cellent evidence for the Paraffine
Company's case. :
Granville W. Stewart of Sauaallto. the
manager of the Pacific Pine Company,
after a long spell of uncertainty as to
the facts about the relations between
his company and the Dundon-Slade
combine, admitted that the four suits
of his company were dismissed as the
result of an agreement. The Slade
Company is now buying from the Pa
cific Company their lumber and Darby
Laydon & Co. their piles. In fact the
latter company has gone out of the
pile importing business as one of the
conditions of the settlement. When
the question as to who made the com
promise was propounded the witness
had another attack of what Chairman
Colnon suffers from since he had the
stroke of something like vertigo.
S. E. Slade was the last witness of
the afternoon. He started out by af
firming that he had no partner in the
lumber business, but he did own a half
interest in the unincorporated San
Francisco Timber Preserving Company,
Formerly the Slade Company was an
Incorporation; now he is it, and they
are Slade. The first person singular
non-incorporated company of Slade &
Co. could not tell what had become of
its books of the period prior to Feb
ruary 1, 1895;
The:others, covering the intervening
period, he identified; He also identified
two books, journal and ledger, of the
San Francisco company, but avowed no
cash account had ever been kept, either
in book form, in loose or bound paper
or as memoranda,
Mr. Slade promises to be the most in
teresting case of Colnoncitis yet de
veloped at the trial. He will resume
the stand this morning.
Everything indicates that counsel for
the Paraffine. Company have some
thing up their combined sleeve that will
make this case celebrated, if not no
torious, after the contagion of Cblnon
cftis has expended its fury.

asked to investigate the reasons of Os
born's displacement from the manage
ment of the institution and the appoint
ment ot Holbrook to the office. Then
the Grand Jury will be requested to
look into the action of certain eight of
the members of the Board of Super
visors whose votes at a meeting on
Monday took the pound out of the
hands of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals and placed it as
a machine of corrupt politicians. Hol
brook's complaint Is a sweeping one
that calls for a complete investigation
of the whole matter.
During that Investigation an effort
will be made to show that one of the
reasons why the pound was taken out
of the control of the society was be
cause the orders of certain Supervisors
asking for the release of the animals of
their friends without the prescribed fee
to the city were not recognized by the
Poundmaster, who was responsible to
the society for the proper conduct of
the institution. Persons whose dogs
were impounded because they had neg
lected or refused to pay the necessary
license would, when the animals were
caught roaming about the streets, go
to some one of the Supervisors with
whom they had a political pull and
get an order on the Poundmaster de
manding: the release of the dog. Before
the society took charge of the pound
such orders were honored. It had the
effect of giving those so favored im
munity from the ordinance prescribing
a tax on dogs. The officers of the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals took the stand that the ordi
nance was made for all citizens alike,
and they refused to honor such orders
or requests. That brought on them the
wrath of several of the Supervisors,
and it is claimed that it had much to
do with the action of Delany and the
rest of the solid eight when they voted
to take the management of the institu
tion from the society and placed it in
the hands of the politicians again.
Osborn, who was given charge of the
pound by the Board of Supervisors at
the meeting of th? board on Monday,
has been voted out of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
Osborn still claims membership in the
organization, but the members will
have nothing to do with him.
There is considerable speculation as
to what the city will now do for a
pound. The corporation owns no place
suitable for the purpose, and there is
no appropriation sufficient for such
purposes. At the beginning of the fis
cal year $500 was set aside for the ex
pense of the pound, but at that time
it was understood that the Humane So
ciety would take care of it on their
premises at Sixteenth and Alabama
streets. It is now said that with the
$500 and a levy from the urgent neces
sity fund a pound will be fitted up. It
will require about $20,000 to properly
equip the place, and it is said if it is
run on political methods it will always
be a source of great expense to the
city. Persons with Supervisors for
friends will be relieved of paying li
censes for their animals, while those
less fortunate will be compelled to pay
the tax. The officers will be open to
corruption and no check can be had on
them.
The foregoing four charges are all
grave in character. Those affecting the
integrity of members of the Committee
on Health and Police are the most
urgent at present and â will be investi
gated ahead of the others, though no
time will be lost in calling the Super
visors to account for their failures in
the case of fenders and in the building
of the Hall of Justice. It would seem
that the storm cloud of wrath and ac
cosatiOn had about settled over the
heads of members of some of the more
important committees of the city's law
making body. The fact that the Grand
Jury is active may spur the board to
act in matters now pending, but noth
ing can stop a thorough investigation
of the charges that crimes have been
committed in the past. The result of
all these accusations will be watched
wltii more than usual interest.
CONSIDER DOUGLAS

CARSON, Feb. I.â There Is a proposi

County with Ormsby, and thus wipe it off
the map of Nevada, because ofthe no
toriety the State has received in conse
quence of the unpunished Ãber lynchers.
A bill will be introduced in the next Leg
islature to do away with the county of
Douglas and merge it into Orrnsby. It
is probable that when this Is done the
District Attorney of Ormsby County will
bring the I'ber case before the Grand

TACOMA, Feb. I.â Richard Hem
broth, a workman at the Tacoma Lum
ber Company's sawmill, met a terrible
fate this afternoon. While at work
about the machinery he was caught by
a large belt and whirled around the
bull wheel, making nearly 100 revolu
tions per minute. His body had to
pass, through a space less than fifteen
inches wide, resulting in serious inter
nal injuries for the unfortunate man,
who was above medium size. In some
manner his feet got caught in the wheel
and in a twinkling both were torn off
below the knees.
An awful scene met the gaze of his
fellow-workmen when the machinery
was stopped and Hemroth lifted from
his agonizing position. Strange to re
late, he remained conscious, and when
the patrol wagon arrived to convey
him to a hospital he quietly directed
that his feet be sent up by the next ear.
Hembroth thought his life might be
saved, but this was found impossible,
all the doctors could do being to ease
his sufferings up to 6 o'clock, when he
died. His wife reached his bedside and
ministered to his last wants.
He leaves several children and no
property.
The Signal Corps.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 29.â The Signal
Corps, Third Brigade, Lieutenant Fred L.
Martin commanding, had a grand outing
on Sunday, the 23d. Apart from the
signal practice and other work accom
plished, the field day was a most profit
able and interesting one, as Jt demon
strated in a practical way the utility of
the bicycle as a means of conveyance for
the signal service. All the members or
the corps were mounted on bicycles and
a full signaling equipment was carried.
The corps commissary wagon accom
panied the boys, and at noon a genuine
military meai was served, consisting of
the usual provender of bacon, beans,
hardtack, coffee, etc., cooked in the
"Buzzecott" oven now in use by the Na
tional Guard.
A start was made from the armory
about 9 o'clock on Sunday morning, the
Folsom wheelway being taken to a point
near the American River, about fifteen
miles from Sacramento. There temporary
camp was established, and signal sta
tions were deployed to surrounding
points, establishing communication with
each other. Pistol practice was also part
of the work of the corps, and served to
sharpen the sights of the soldiers for
their annual shoot, which will take place
to-morrow.
Major Douglas, signal officer of the
Third Brigade, accompanied the corps as
far as Perkins.

last fall. Upon his arrival here he was
met by almost the entire population of
the city and tendered an enthusiastic
reception.
The manner in which he was received
upon his return home gives only a
slight idea of the warm friendship that
existed for him in the hearts of the
citizens generally, not only here but
throughout the State. His record js an
honorable one, and white his end is
not what his friends would have had it
! and not what he himself would have
contemplated when in his right mind.
disease and the knowledge that he was
afflicted will cause this act of suicide
â  to be forgotten, overshadowed as it is
by his many noble deeds and acts of
kindness.
Mr. Thompson leaves a widow, four
daughters and one son, Hugh, who is
! stillln Brazil.
For several years Mr. Thompson had
been suffering from an affection of the
ear, which gave him much pain and
caused deafness. While attending, the
funeral of Major Tuttle a few-days ago
he caught a cold, and this aggravated
the ear disease. Several physicians
expressed the opinion to-day that this
had undoubtedly affected his brain,
producing partial insanity. â¢';

BITTEN BY A MAD
DOG A CHILD DIES
OF HYDROPHOBIA
Little Lucy Olevria of Santa
Monica Passes Away in tf)e
Agony of Rabies.
SANTA MONICA, Feb. I.â The seven-year-old child, Lucy Olivera,
who was bitten by a mad dog twenty days ago, died to-day of hydro
phobia.
The child was horribly mangled, but with extra care had seemingly
recovered, and the wounds had healed. On Sunday she was taken ill,
the. first serious symptom being a violent twitching. Her throat hurt
her, and she refused to- eat or drink. As her horrible malady increased
she developed intense fear of all persons, going into spasms on their ap
proach. Even the members of her own family were not excepted. The
pupils of her eyes were much dilated, and froth oozed from her mouth,
while the convulsions Increased rapidly. She emitted many sharp,
frightened cries that seemed hardly human, and it took strength and
extreme care to manage her. Her mouth snapped viciously.
This morning she seemed a little better and called for water, but
could not swallow. At noon, about forty-eight hours after the symp
toms began, there came a sudden change err collapse, and death very
soon released the little sufferer.
Dr. Lindsay, the attending physician, says it is the first case, to
the best of his knowledge, of genuine hydrophobia in Southern Cali
fornia.
TWO HACKMEN
ARE HEARD
Examined Before the Ohio
Senate Investigating
Committee.
But Their Testimony Utterly
Fails of the Purpose
Intended.
They Tell of Driving Men Around
Town, but Do Not Connect Them
With Boyce and Rathbone.
Bpeclnl Dispatch to The Call.
COLUMBUS, 0., Feb. I.â Two hack
men were examined by the Senate
committee investigating the alleged
bribery charges this evening. The pur
pose of the testimony was to attempt
to show that H. H. Boyce, who is al
leged to have attempted to bribe Rep
resentative Otis, came to Columbus on
the afternoon of January 10 â inaugura
tion day â and met Major Rathbone,
one of Senator Hanna's lieutenants.
The testimony failed utterly of its pur
pose. The hackmen told of having
driven two men around the city, but
could not describe either of them, nor
did they hear any conversation that
would give any clew to the identity of
the two men,
Charles Steitz. employed by the Co
lumbus Transfer Company, testified
thatonlnaugurationjdayhe took a man
from the Neil House to the Union Sta
tion about noon; that after waiting
there a short time he was instructed to
drive to Broad street opposite 263.
After waiting at the latter place a
carriage drove up in front of No. 263,
and his passenger told him to go oVer
to the carriage and tell a man on the
inside to get into his (Steitz') carriage.
The man in carriage No. 2 had two va
lises, which he deposited in Steitz' car
riage, and then Steitz drove the two
men around for an hour or two. Steitz
said he was instructed in case any one
followed them to drive fast. Once he
thought he : saw a carriage following
and he whipped up the horses and was
soon out of sight. One of the passen
gers subsequently left the carriage on
Third street, opposite the Capitol, and
the other left it near the depot.
George H. Brown, another hackman.
told of driving a stranger to 263 East
Broad street and of the passenger be
ing transferred to another hack. Neith
er of the men could describe the alleged
mysterious passengers and neither of
them knew Boyoe or Rathbone. Brown
contradicted Steitz by stating that the
man left his cab and had started into
the house before he was called by
Steitz. ____________

FIGHTS WITH
FIVE OUTLAWS
One Arizona Officer Puts
the Quintet to
Flight.
Wounds Two Men and Effects
the Capture of One of
Them.
Brave Attempt of Deputy Sheriff
Bargeman to Serve Warrants
of Arrest.
Special Dispatch to The fall.
HOLBROOK, Ariz.. Feb. I.â Deputy
Sheriff Joseph Bargeman has returned
from Tonto Basin, whither he went to
arrest Arthur Ferrall and Ernest Gen
try, outlaws who "shot up the town"
of Heber, near here. In December.
Bargeman heard that his men and sev
eral" others were hiding with the In
dians on Canyon Creek on the Apache
reservation. After scouting for a
week he succeeded In tracking one of
the bandits, W. W. Walker, to the
rendezvous. The white men were
damped in a little valley In company
with the John Dazin band of Cibiou
Apaches. Bargeman found the camp
late In the morning and identified about
the fire besides Ferrall, Gentry and
Walker, Bob Anderson and Bob Pen
rod. This Quintet is believed to be re
sponsible for many robberies and cattle
depredations in this vicinity.
Bargeman rode toward the camp fire
shouting to Gentry and Ferrall that he
had warrants for them. Instead of sur
rendering the outlaws grasped their
guns and opened fire on the officer.
Bargeman found cover and sustaining
no damage himself succeeded in wound
ing Gentry and Walker and driving the
five desperadoes from the field.
The officer obtained aid in Pleasant
Valley and returned. Walker was
found at an Indian camp, wounded in
the shoulder. Gentry, who was wounded
in the abdojnen, escaped, and the posse
did not deem it wise to pursue him and
his companions farther into the Indian
country. Walker was taken to Globe
and charged with grand larceny, as a
stolen horse was found with him.
Dazin's band is the one that had the
running fight with Deputy Sheriff
Ketchterside and posse last year. The
Indians are reported very ugly over
Bargeman's attack for Gentry is a
member of the tribe by adoption and
marriage. : . ,-,' ;
SOMETHING SERIOUS
IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
Scientists Puzzled by the Strange
Conditions of the Earthquake on
the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.
OAXACA, Mexico. Feb. I.âEarth
i quakes in the region of the City ox
! Tehuantepec, in this State, are puz
zling the local scientists. The localiza
tion of the seismic phenomena is re
l markable, fully 90 per cent of the
\ movements being confined within a
'. space of fifty miles in one direction and
twenty-five miles in another, and one
of the noteworthy things is that the
subterranean roaring and rumbling are
frequently heard without any commo
tion on the earth's crust. Fortunately
no loss of life has been reported.
That something- is proing to happen is
believed. It js entirely within the
limits of possibility that the eastern
part of the isthmus will sink, allowing 1
the sea to come in, which would reduce
the width of the isthmus considerably.

sending telegrams to 'President McKin
iey and to the Italian Consul at San
Francisco asking them to send him
money. His actions indicated that he
was insane, so the City Marshal was
summoned to take him in custody.
When searched deeds; and. other docu
ments were found showing that his
name is Peter Blurello and that he has*
been residing in Washington. He is an
Italian and we!! dressed. He will be
taken to San Jose in the morning to be
examined by the Insanity Commission.
KELLY MUST SERVE TIME.
SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 1.-Pntriek Kelly's

will run its course, for to-day Superior
Judge Angellotti remanded the convict to
the custody of Warden Hale and dis
missed the habeas corpus proceedings.

GLOVERSVILLE, N. V., Feb. I.â
The Alvord House, one of Gloversville's .
landmarks, as well as the largest hotel
in Fulton County, being a handsome
four-story structure, was destroyed by
fire this morning.
The fire strated on the ground floor
about 7 o'clock, and shot up through
the upper stories with lightning-like
speed, the broad stairs and hall ways
furnishing great flues which carried the
flames upward. Almost immediately
after the flames were discovered the
alarm was sounded through the house,
and the big hotel was soon the scene of
the wildest confusion. There was a
wild scramble on the part of the guests
to escape from the building with their
personal property; but many were
forced to flee without saving anything.
A few of the guests marie their escape
by the stairways, but the smoke soon
cut off this retreat. The next resort of
the imprisoned people was the windows.
As their terror-stricken faces appeared
the great crowd below watched breath
lessly, hoping against hope that all
would be saved. The guests who were
thus entrapped did not long hesitate to
take the risk of jumping, though some
were rescued from their perilous" posi
tions by the firemen. Others leaped
from the windows, several being more
or Jess injured. Findlay Morrow, a
traveling salesman for an Albany
house, clad only in his nightshirt and
trousers, jumped from a window, land
ing safely in the snow.
Among the seriously injured are:
William Malonick, traveling man,
residence unknown, sprained ankle.
B. A. Ross, traveling man, Rochester.
N. V-, badly bruised.
The total loss on the building, furni
ture and property of guests will prob
ably amount to $100,000, partly insured.
The fire started near the laundry, but
from what cause Is not now known.
The firemen searched all day in the
ruins for the remains of victims, but
their efforts were unrewarded. Elec
tric lights have been strung over the
ruins, and a large force will continue
the search all night.
Dr. D. D. Davis of Westfield, N. V.,
jumped from the third story. He
struck the wires opposite the second
story and was thrown to the ground,
but was not seriously hurt. J. H.
Barry of Troy Jumped from the third
story and was only slightly injured.
Elwood Delong, a fireman, was serious
ly frozen. Andrew Watson of Toronto,
Ont., jumped from the fourth floor to a
shed and was only slightly hurt.

LOST TO PACIFIC GROVE.
Career of Rev. Thomas H. Sinex Closed by the Hand of Death.
PACIFIC GROVE, Feb. I.â Rev. Thomas 11. Sinex, D.D., who for many
years has been one of the most prominent figures among the Methodist clergy
of the Pacific Coast, died at his home in this city this morning at 3:30 o'clock.
Being one of the makers, in a measure, of the town of Pacific Grove, and for
Feme time head of the moral and prudential management of the town, his loss
is a serious one to the people, and the Hags at half-mast and other signs of
mourning that have already appeared illustrate the general grief..
Born in 1824 in New Albany, Ind., he was educated at the Indiana Asbury
University at Greencastle, and graduated there in IS4B. He then entered the
ministry of the Methodist Episcopal church at the age of 19 years,
and came to California among the early pioneers. He was, successively, presi
dent of the University of the Pacific at College Park, president of the board
of trustees of that institution, presiding elder of the Stockton district (now
San Francisco) of the California M. E. Conference, pastor of the Bush-street
Church of San Francisco and moral and prudential manager of Pacific Grove
under the Pacific Grove Retreat Association. In ISS9 he succeeded C. L. Boyer
as superintendent of the town and as secretary of the Retreat Association,
which positions he. occupied at the time of his death. He built the handsome
Methodist Episcopal Church and assembly hall at this place, and through
out his term as superintendent here has been the promoter of public improve
ments.
Dr. Sinex suffered from a heart affection for several months past, and
two weeks ago was laid upon his bed in a most critical condition. Since Sat
urday morning he had been sinking rapidly. About 4 o'clock yesterday he
lost consciousness, never regaining it before his death. He leaves a widow
and one daughterâ Mrs. E. S. Gay of Philadelphia, who is now in Pacific
Grove. ; â â .â '.;'â  -â -;.â ; â 
As Dr. Sinex Was ex-past grand chaplain of the Grand LiOdge of Califor
nia, I. O. O, F., his funeral will be conducted under the auspices of the State
Grand LiOdge, and will occur here at 2 p. m. on Thursday.

Blackmailer Williams Gains
Freedom Through a
Window.
Is Given Permission to Take a
Bath and Uses His Tims to
Advantage.
SpÂ«elal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, Feb. I.â A. M.
Williams, a notorious blackmailer, who
was confined in the County Jail await
ing trial in the United States Court on
a charge of using the mails for fraudu
lent purposes, made a remarkable es
cape from the jail at 3 o'clock this af
ternoon and has so far eluded the offi
cers. Jailer Case and Deputy Marshal
Pourade, who made the arrest, were in
the jail at the time. Pourade was just
about to start to Los Angeles with Wil
liams and another prisoner.
Williams was loose in the corridor
and asked permission to take a bath.
He hung up a blanket as a screen and
pulled the bars from a window, having
previously filed through the wrought
iron rivets. He then kicked off a wire
netting from the window and lowered
himself to the ground with a rope im
provised from a blanket. Not more than
ten minutes is supposed to have elapsed
from the time of his escape until it was
discovered. All the officers and several
hundred citizens began a search, and
within an hour Sheriff Johnson of
Riverside was in the city with a pack
of bloodhounds to Join in the search.
So many persons had in the meanwhile
walked around the Jail that the trail
was obliterated and the dogs proved
to be useless.
Williams is the man who wrote
dozens of letters to people all over the
country enclosing small sums of money
tempting them to dishonesty, and then
under the guise of a detective extorted
money from his victims.

is uncle sams superior?
Hostilities Would Not Be Brief, and in
Any Event Cities Would BÂ©
Laid in Ashes.
Copyrighted 1898 by Jaiwa Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, Feb. I.â The Herald's Euro
pean edition publishes the following:
Lieutenant Mario Rubio Munez spoke
golden words in an article written for
the Spanish Illustrated El Mundo
Naval, which the Herald reproduced.
He says: "It seems, it is, in our
opinion, well to form comparative data
with other navies as the best means
of appreciating the relative value of
national forces." Wars are precipi
tated by ignorance. Had the people of
France realized the preparedness
of thÂ»lr enemies in 1870 they would
probably not have shouted "A Ber
lin" so viciferously. The Northern
States cried "On to Richmond," and it
took four years to get there. Now it is
just as well for the United States to
face a Spanish crisis with its eyes
open. A war with Spain will not be
a walk-over, nor will it be ended in a
month. The data given in the Herald
yesterday are very instructive. They
show that Spain is also getting ready
for a fight with the jingoes of both
countries are doing their best to hurry
on. The tables which Lieutenant Mu
nez gives satisfies him as an naval ex
pert that Spain is not as defenseless
as some people imagine. A well-armed
man will put up a good fight even un
der disadvantageous circumstances
and though Spain may be weaker at
many points than the United States
she also sees that on the other hand
America too has a vulnerable side.
If, therefore, war does take place,
both s'.des will suffer. American jin
goes have decided that the United
States should meddle in Spain's do
mestic affairs, and Spanish jingoes
have been egging on their Government
by the very same method that their
brothers in the United States have been
using. Now, if the peopfa decide to
back up this sentiment, rightly or
wrongly, it is as well that their eyes
should be open to whftt they have to
fight. Spain has a navy, of which some
vessels, according to one of her experts,
"are absolutely superior to other for
eign antagonists.
"Eloquence of figures," he says,
"should be sufficient to calm even the
incredulous and pessimistic and close
the mouths of those who are constantly
stating that the Spanish forces are de
ficient, and of those who so freely criti
cize the resources of our country."
On the other hand American experts
think that the United States navy is
superior, and that it would have an
easy time of it with Spain. This re
mains to be proved. What is certain
is that if war does break out a few
cities will be laid in ashes, and whether

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Feb. I.â Several months
ago A. J. Robinson, his wife and
adopted daughter, Ida, the latter just
budding into attractive womanhood,
returned to Belmore, five miles from
Olympia, where they had formerly re
sided, after an absence of three years
in Southern California. Several weeks
later William J. Marshall, who calls
himself a "California guy," appeared
upon the scene as the affianced lpver
of Miss Robinson. The whole party
was headed toward the Klondike, ex
pecting to sail on the steamship Queen
this week.
For some time the Bellmore neigh
borhood has been /more or less agitated
over What has seemed to be an attempt
of her foster parents to coerce Ida Into
a matrimonial alliance with young
Marshall. The girl has been wearing
an engagement ring, but refused longer
to wÂ«ar it. Her foster mother having
attempted to compel her to wear the
ring, the girl deliberately burned her
finger so as to make the wearing of
the ring impossible, and the neigh
bors, judging from Marshall's per
sonal appearance, are said to justify
the girl in her rebellion.
At this stage of the proceedings Miss
Robinson appealed to Jesse Ferguson,
an old and respected citizen of Olym
pia, for assistance. To him she detailed
her parents' attempt to make her
marry Marshall, and said that she
feared Bhe was to be taken to Klon
dike for evil purposes, In which event
she Would rather die than go. Fer
guson sent Miss Elsie Israel to take
Miss Robinson for a drive. When out
of sight of the Robinson domicile they
drove rapidly to Olympia, where Miss
Robinson was taken charge of by Mr.
Ferguson's daughter.
Yesterday, on her father's urgent re
quest, she consented to return home for
one night In order to get her clothing.
There she remains, while Belmore and
Olympia are wondering what the out
come will be. Marshall swore dire
vengeance against several persons, in
cluding Ferguson, who to-day had him
bound over to keep the peace. Being
unable to furnish $300 bonds, Marshall
was locked up.

MOST DRAMATIC
SCENES ATTEND
PEAN'S DEATH
In an Hour I Shall Be Dead/;
Said tl)e Famous F renc^ Sur
geon, and He Passed Away
at the Moment Fixed.
PARIS, Feb. I.â The Herald's European edition publishes the fol
i lowing: France is Just awakening to a realization of the loss she has
â¢ sustained in the death of Dr. Pean. He was an operator of marvelous
I skill and nerve, and was probably the first surgeon In France who
Â» dared to- perform abdominal operations and ovariotomy, which are
i nowadays so common and so little feared. Antiseptic precautions were
i then hardly ever observed, and patients ran great risks, but when Dr.
i Pean operated his cases rarely ended fatally, and he quickly obtained
i a great reputation. Numerous pupils followed his instruction at Saint
i Louis Hospital.
i His death was dramatic. On Saturday evening pneumonia set In,
i and he began to Bhlver. He said to his friends around him, "I am a
> lost man." He at once sent for a priest from the Madeleine, who ad
1 ministered the last sacraments to him, Dr. Pean saying: "I shall die
â¢ in the faith nf my father." The fever Increased. He counted the
i beats of his pulse, saying, "I never saw any one who survived what I
Â» am now gong through. In an hour I shall be dead." He then said good
l by to his friends and died in the full possession of all his faculties at the
I very moment he had fixed.
Dr. Albert Robin writes an editorial in to-day's Herald on Dr.
Pean's death, and gives valuable advice about the treatment of pneu
monia. He says: "Professor Pean died last Sunday of infectious
pneumonia. Only on Tuesday he was at the Academy of Medicine, full
of life and health. He took influenza, but persisted in going out to
visit his patients, with the result that pneumonia attacked him and
carried him off. This is a cruel instance of the havoc wrought by
pneumonia in cases of the grip.
"Doubtless in the case of Professor Peah everything was done that
ought to have been done, even the impossible; yet what can be done
against infectious pneumonia, which kills in forty-eight hours. We
know only of one remedy â that is cold baths, the only treatment which
has had any success in these terrible cases. Here is a method to be
followed: 1. Begin with a dose of 0.40 gramme of calomel. 2. As soon
as the calomel has acted draw off 250 grammes of blood. 3. Administer
a dose of 0.30 gramme of sulphurate of quinine, morning and evening.
4. Apply camphor blister of eight centimetres square. 5. If the patient
becomes worse despite the above measures, order cold baths every
three hours, just as wcruld be done in case of typhoid fever."
DIVIDED OVER
AN INNOVATION
Stanford's Council Has a
Vexed Question
to Solve.
Shall the University Abolish
the Degree of Master
of Arts?
Four Professors Say Aye, One Is
Opposed and the Others
Have Not Spoken.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PALO ALTO, Feb. I.â The Stanford
Council, consisting of the heads of de
partments and associate professors, is
at present divided over a measure
which even for this university in Its
thoroughgoing academic simplicity is
considered decidedly radical. The pro
posal comes from the committee or.
graduation, In the shape of a recom
mendation urging strongly that the de
gree of Master of Arts shall be abol
ished.
The majority report was signed by
Professors Elliott, Jenkins and Has
kins. A minority report presenting the
reasons why such a degree should be
retained at Stanford was handed in by
the remaining member of the commit
tee, Professor Pease. The question was
voted on to-day and the vote was a
tie. The opinions of the nine absent
professors will be obtained before
Thursday, when the question will be
finally decided.
The majority of the graduation com
mittee contends that the Master's de
gree has the least significance of any
of the academic degrees and is least
uniform in its requirements through
out the universities. It is held to be a
purely honorary degree, historically,
and for all practical purposes obsolete.
Another argument against it is that
it does not stand for the well-defined
academic ideas represented by the de
grees of bachelor of arts and doctor of
philosophy.
Those who favored retaining the de
gree felt that its abolition would drive
many graduate students from Stanford
and work a great injustice. The popu
larity of the degree and its intrinsic or
commercial value were considerations
in its favor. To them it represented the
award for original research and for this
reason should not be done away with.
Of the colleges in this country Johns
Hopkins is the only one that has, up to
this time, put an end to the master's
The council decided that summer
work done at another college or on the
outside will not receive more than six
hours' university credit and will have
to be approved of by the faculty before
undertaken.
Examinations will have to be taken
in the work so done within one month
after the student re-enters the uni
versity. This action was taken more
to anticipate the rush of petitions for
outside work now that the summer
school at Stanford has been abolished
than to correct any existing abuse. The
entrance requirement known as Eng
lish A, which covers the regular prepa
tory work in English poetry, drama
and prose, was made optional instead
of compulsory for full university
standing. Only those students who have
worked during their whole courseâ and
they are manyâ to remove such a de
ficiency in standing can appreciate the
full import of this move. â¢
The student athletics committee to
day recommended that an Eastern
coach be engaged for next season's
football team. This action is directly
opposed to the feeling of the faculty
athletics committee on this point. The
faculty committee believes that Stan
ford has reached, the stage, where she
can furnish coaches from her alumni
and develop her own game. The stu
dents would like to believe this asser
tion, enabling them to spend their
coach money for other purposes, but
do not think the time has come when
the West can cut loose from the East
In football affairs. It is also believed
by the students that the Influence of an
Eastern coach In setting the men down
to work is as beneficial as the play he
teaches
ENGINE ROLLS
INTO A DITCH
Disaster to a Southern
Pacific Train Near
Ravenna.
Engineer Prevents the Coaches
From Following the
Locomotive.
Fireman Her Is Slightly Bruised, but
the Passengers Escape
Injury.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. I.â The engine
of Southern Pacific train No. 17, which
left San Francisco at 4:30 p. m. yester
day, was ditched about two miles
south of Ravenna this morning at
11:20 o'clock, but, aside from a few
superficial bruises sustained by Fire
man Her, no one was injured. The
train was running- at the rate of about
twenty miles an hour, and, while
rounding a sharp curve on an embank
ment in the Soledad Canyon between
Ravenna and Lang, the forward
trucks of the locomotive left the track.
With remarkable quickness and pres
ence of mind Engineer Ferguson ap
plied the air brakes and brought the
cars to a sudden stop, but the engine
and tender broke from the coupling
and rolled down the embankment a
distance of forty feet.
Just before reaching the foot of the
embankment the engine turned bot
tom side up, and Engineer Ferguson,
who had stuck to his post, was thrown
through the cab window a distance of
thirty feet, and landed on his head in a
heap of sand. Aside from a severe
shaking up he was uninjured.
Fireman Her was engaged in clean
ing the bell of the locomotive when the
accident occurred, and immediately
jumped. He rolled down the em
bankment and was somewhat bruised
and scratched in his rapid descent.
The passengers expressed their gratl- I
tude to Engineer Ferguson, whose time- I
ly action in applying the brakes pre- :
vented a serious disaster, and in recog- j
nition of his bravery a sum of money '
was subscribed, which will be used in j
the purchase of a token of their ap
preciation. A purse was also made up
for Fifeman Her.
A wrecking train was dispatched
from this city to the scene of the acci
dent, and the train is expected to arrive
here about 2 o'clock to-morrow morn-

HOLDERS LOSE
Bankers' Alliance of Cali
fornia Goes to the
Wall.
Possessors of Certificates Not
Likely to Realize Re
turns.
Threaten to Sue Capitalists Who Per
mitted Use of Their Names by
the Organization.
Bperlal Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. I.â The Bank
ers' Alliance of California, a life insur
ance corporation doing business
throughout California, has gone to the
wall, and many dupes who were certi
ficate holders will suffer financial loss.
The Bankers' Alliance was organized
in 1888 under the California law gov-
erning assessment and fraternal organ
izations. It had no capital, but was
run on an assesment plan.
The Bankers' Alliance secured the
Indorsement of a number of local bank
ers throughout Southern California by
various and sundry means, interest
ing them as directors, officers and
agents. Among others General E. P.
Johnson, Dr. W. G. Cochran, F. C.
Howes, Dr. H. H. Maynard, W. F.
Bosbyshell and G. B. Shaffer, all promi
nent business men and bankers, were
interested in the Alliance. The cor
poration branched out and did a large
business all through California, par
ticularly in Los Angeles and San Fran
cisco.
Finally, about a year ago, the struc
ture commenced to crumble and those
who had been so prominently inter
ested began to drop out. The decay
had set in and it could not be stopped,
and now the officials have asked that a
receiver be appointed to wind up the
affairs of the company.
The outstanding liabilities in the way
of accrued death claims are $120,000.
The holders of certificates in the Bank
ers' Alliance are offered certificates in
a Chicago concern of similar repute. A
great many, however, will suffer, for
there were numerous clerks and mid
dle-class people who had certificates in
the alliance that they had kept up for
a long period of years. They are out
every dollar they put in.
Some of the certificate-holders who
claim they have been duped are com
plaining bitterly of what they term the
misrepresentation upon which they
were persuaded to put their money into
the Bankers' Alliance. A great many
of those bankers and capitalists who
permitted their names to be used as
officers of the corporation to get busi
ness for the Alliance, but who with
drew before the crash came, may be
made parties defendant by some of
the duped certificate-holders, who are
advised that they can recover the
money they have put in as against the
officers of the defunct corporation.

f The Hawaiian . annexationists, now
thoroughly disheartened, are convinced
that the treaty will fall several votes
short of the necessary sixty. The visit
lof President Dole. has not benefited
j them, as expected. : They have been
wining and dining him, and have In-
I vited those Senators who were con
sidered doubtful to meet him at these
dinner parties, but the. result is dis
appointing.. The situation, remains the
same as it did two. weeks ago. The an
nexationists will lack at least, five
votes of the necessary number. Sena
tor Davis, chairman of the Committee
on Foreign Relations,, consulted with
his henchmen in the Senate restaurant
to-day, and it was agreed among them
that unless recruits from unexpected
quarters were secured the treaty was
doomed to defeat. The prospects are
that the treaty will soon be abandoned
and the joint resolution taken up. It.
is said that several of the influential
Senators , on the Republican side are
endeavoring to persuade Chairman
Davis to drop: the treaty and take up
the joint resolution or bill, but Mr.
Davis well realizes that the : abandon
ment of the ; treaty would be a confes
; sion 1 of weakness and could not fail to
prejudice the chances for passage of
the joint resolution.' : . â¢â ;â .;./.â 
- : ' lndeed, he is well aware that several
Senators now counted in favor of the
treaty could not be prevailed upon to
vote 'for annexation by the irregular
method of a bill or joint resolution.
They are sticklers for "Senatorial pro
priety" and.time^hpndred customs, and
cannot be induced to depart from them.
The prospects are that the treaty will
be. talked to death unless >if is aban
doned. At least fifteen: Senators op
posed : to- annexation have given notice
of their intention .of -making- lung
speeches against it. Among them are
several long-winded Senators like Allen
â of Nebraska, -who;: in': the last Congress,
made the longest speech ever deliv
ered .in that body. The speeches : of
White of California and Pettigrew of
Dakota in executive session to-day gave
their brethren an inkling of what they
may expect. White and ',. Pettigrew
: have not- fairly, started â â  yet, and both |

taining, as the Senator said, the same
point. A large part of Senator White's
remarks were given up to quotations
from and comment upon Secre
tary Sherman's utterances upon
the subject of annexation of Hawaii.
White read liberal extracts from Mr.
Sherman's book, in which the Secre
tary dwells upon the unwisdom of
making the islands a part of the Unit
ed States, and he laid especial stress
upon the Secretary's remarks in the
latter part of his book to the effect that
he hoped there would be no further ef
fort to annex the islands during his
lifetime.
Senator White had not concluded his
argument when the Senate adjourned.
He took occasion to remark, in reply to
Senator Platt's statement, that the su
gar trust was opposed to the treaty.
PRESIDENT DOLE
AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
Beautiful Decorations a Feature of
the Most Elaborate Entertain
ment of the Present Season.
WASHINGTON, Feb. I.â The most
elaborate entertainment of the present
official season marked the welcome of
President Dole of Hawaii at the White
House this evening. The decorations
were extremely beautiful and in the
most perfect artistic taste. The party
was much too large to be accommodat
ed in the state dining room, and the
table was laid in the corridor behind
the great stained glass screen.
The length of the board was occu
pied by the great golden-edged mirror,
the traditional accompaniment of so
many official dinners, from which rose
a peaceful trocha of delicately scented
and delicately arranged orchids, white
and purple. A corsage bouquet of the
same {lowers was at the place of each
lady, while each gentleman found by
his plate a single white orchid for a
boutonniere.
The mirrors in the corridors were
veiled in smilax. arid garlands of me
same delicate plant shrouded the chan
deliers. At each end of the table were
large plaques of white hyacinths.
In the east room the President and
Mrs. McKinley Vice-President and
Mrs. Hobart. the guests of honor,
President and Mrs. Dole, and the mem
bers of the Cabinet received the <>thÂ«r
guests for a short space before repair
ing, to the table.
MEANS THAT ARMOR
WILL BE CHEAPER.
Ordnance Experts Predict a Satisfac
tory Result From the Chase-
Ghantt Process.
NEW YORK. Feb. I.â A Washington
special to the Herald says.: If expecta
tions of the ordnance experts as to the
ballistic properties of the plate being
manufactured at the works of the Car
negie Company are fulfilled, it will
be possible for the Government to pur
chase armor at a cost below the limit
of $30Q a ton imposed by CongTess. This
plate in question is being manufac
tured by the , Chase-Ghantt process,
under Government supervision.
The Bethlehem Iron Company manu
factured the Chase-Ghantt plate about
a year ago, which showed ceftaln good
qualities, but was brittle. Promoters
of the Chase-Ghantt process . accused
the Bethlehem company of having
burned the plate. By the Chase-Ghantt
plan the processes of cementation and
reforging are not employed. This
means a saying of both time and
money. The plate now in the; course
of manufacture was originally 18 inches
in thickness, but it has ben forged
down to 10 inches. Tests made with
specimens of the plate show that it sp
far equals Harveyized armor.

twice Stelzner seemed Jo be in distress,
but he recovered very quickly.

kept away from Stetzner's swings,
many of which he cleverly ducked. In.
the eighth and ninth rounds Stelzner
forced matters, landing repeatedly on
Casey's wind.

Trouncing.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
PORTLAND, Or.. Feb. I.â George
Harvey, mate of the ship George Stet
son, who Is charged by members of the
crew with having driven Amos Stone
crazy by brutality, was arrested in As
toria to-day and will be brought to
Portland to stand trial in the United
States court. The arrest was made by
Deputy United States Marshal Howe,
who acted on a telegram from W. T.
Shanahan, secretary of the Oregon Hu
mane Saciety.
Eight of the crew, including the col
ored cook, were arrested in Portland
and will be held as witnesses against
the mate.
They were brought before United
States Commissioner E. D. MeKee,
and, being unable to give $250 bonds
for their appearance, were committed
to jail. .
Mr. Shanahan left for Astoria last
evening to inquiire into the circum
stances of the affair and the condition
of young Stone. The ship was to have
left up the river this morning. The
crew was paid at Astoria a few days
ago and Captain Murphy went to San
Francisco, leaving the ship in charge
of the first and second mates. After
the crew was paid off a lot of the
seamen went aboard the ship and gave
the second mate, thf> only man they
could find, a trouncing.
The greatest indignation has been
aroused in Portland by the published
accounts of the brutality on board the
Stetson, and Mr. Shanahan was be
sieged by visitors yesterday morning
who requested :hlm to investigate the
affair. When he finally consented to
takÂ« the matter up he found that the
United States authorities had decided
to do bo, but fearing that they might
delay until Harvey had an opportunity
to escape he telegraphed that the ar
rest be made immediately.
The members of the crew agree that
the mate was exceedingly cruel to
Stone and that the latter was out of
his head from the time Harvey dealt
him the first blow. ;

PORTLAND, Or., Feb. I.â The Re
publican League of Oregon, in State
convention, to-day Indorsed the finan
cial plank In the last National Repub
lican platform, and approved President
McKinley's administration and the
course of Secretary of the Treasury
Gage on the financial question. The
resolution, which was almost unani
mously adopted. Is as follows:
Whereas, The paramount issue which
is now "before the American people, di
viding political parties and engrossing the
attention of all patriotic citizens. Is the
financial question; therefore be it ,
Resolved, That this League of Repub
lican Clubs cordially approves and re
affirms its belief in the financial plank of
the last Republican National Convention;
and be it further
Resolved, That we accept and approve
of the speech of President McKinley at
New York on the 27th of January, 1898.
as a correct exposition of that plank and
the monetary policy of the Republican
PS Resolved, That we are in hearty accord
with the administration and its wise and
efficient Secretary of the Treasury, Ly
man J. Gage, in their efforts to resist sil
ver monometallism and to give additional
stability and strength to our present
financial system.
The factional flght among the dele
gates from the city of Portland threat
ened for a time this afternoon to dis
rupt the convention, but their differ
ences were finally adjusted and har
mony prevailed.
The committee on credentials work
ed all day and at 7:30 o'clock to-night
presented its report. It showed that
2018 delegates were entitled to seats in
the convention. 969 of those being from
Multnomah County, which includes
the city of Portland. The committee
in its report stated that fraud had
evidently been practiced and that rolls
had been stuffed in the election of del
egates from Multnomah County, but
that it was unable to segregate the
legal from the illegal delegates; there
fore it was compelled to recommend
that all delegates be given seats.
After an acrimonious debate of two
hours on a motion to throw out all del
egates from Multnomah County the
motion was voted down and the report
of the credentials committee, seating
all delegates, was adopted.
Claude M. Gatch, Mayor of Salem,
was elected president of the league by
acclamation. He was called to the
platform and in a brief address an
nounced his unqualified belief in the
single gold standard. He said: "It is
an honor to be elected president of the
Republican League of Oregon. It was
not because of any personal worth nor
for the reason that I have not
been connected with any faction of the
Republican party that this election
came to me, but because I have stood
for a gold standard of value."

Ada L. Carlisle was granted a divorce
from her husband, Charles Carlisle, yes

OWES HIS LIFE
TO HIS WATCH
Assassin Fires Four Shots
at a Fresno Saloon-
Keeper.
One Is Well Aimed and It
Shatters the Intended Vic
tim's Timepiece.
The Assailant Makes His Escapa
Unharmed by Bullets Sent
After Him.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Feb. I.â A cold-blooded at
tempt was made at 4 o'clock this morn
ing to assassinate Thomas Maloney,
the proprietor of the Laurel Palace sa
loon, at the corner of E and TularÂ»
streets. A gold watch saved the Ufa
of Maloney, as the bullet of the only
well-aimed shot struck the watch. In
denting the case and shattering the
works.
The attempt upon the saloonlst'3
life was made shortly after he had
opened the fence gate to pass Into tha
side stairway leading to his apart
ments, which are over his saloon. Fout
shots were fired at him. and he dis
charged five at his assailant after tha
latter started to flee.
Maloney had hardly opened the close
boarded gate when an individual within â 
one foot of : him fired â  the ' first shot,
burning the pocket on the left side
of his coat. The impact, coupled with : .
the suddenness of â .'â  the attack,'; caused
Maloney to fall upon his :â .: knees, and
while in that position : the unknown
assailant discharged three more, shots v
at him. These were aimed -wildly ano:
all passed over the fence. : Maloney is .
crippled in the right arm, but before
arising to his feet he managed with his
; left hand to draw a revolver, ; and then /
pursued his assailant to the rear of
the house, firing five ; shots after him, ::
but losing him finally in the darkness.
The assassin escaped at the; rear in he ,â â 
direction of F street. He had left pVn .';.
j the back fence gate into the passage
way. Â»
This gate, which is some fifteen feet
! from the one on Tuk â¢'c street, is al
ways kept closed.
p.- There are evidences that Maloney ;'â 'â 
was ; ; waited for, the intention having
been to murder him. The ground floor
of the saloon : building :in which Ma- 7
f lony lives is vacant, but one of the
I back rooms is used â 'â¢ for .': storage pur
,poses,; and for that reason the back
door and : also the side door, right
.where the shooting at f; the \ outside
stairway ends, have been kept locked.
They were both found open after the ;
shooting, and the supposition is that : ?
the : assassin had secreted : : himself in
the unoccupied saloon floor and.;
watched : for Maloney to cross the street
; from the: saloon. Maloney's fall upon : ;
his knees barred the way to : escape ;:
through the unoccupied saloon, and the
assassin, who had â provided for every
t available means of flight, chose then
the other one by way of the ; i gate
which he had left open to the rear of
the premises.
' : The officers are mystified as to who ;
; made the attempt on the saloon-keep
â¢ er's life. Maloney will give them no in-.;
formation, although he claims to have
>a^ strong suspicion as to who the fel
low is. He denies, however, that ]â  he :â 
recognized him. , This is not Maloney'a
first experience with bullets popping -at ;
him, for about ; five ; years ago he ;â  was
shot five : times on Mariposa street, near
Front, a woman being the cause of the
shpoting. At that time Maloney refused
I to prosecute the shooter. : ,â . ..â ..;â .â ,

THE FOOL fIND THE GUN.
THE time is hereâ in fact has long been hereâ
when the particular fool who kills a friend
through the impulse to point a gun, presumably
unloaded, should be treated as a criminal homicide.
The presumption that any gun, under any circum
stances, is unloaded should not be permitted to
stand.
When the friend is dead the fool goes into spasms
of grief, from which, unfortunately, he ultimately re
covers, and while he may have been reformed by the
experience, other fools have not been impressed, and
they go right on swelling the mortuary record. The
latest instance of this sort occurred at Stockton. The
killed will be duly buried in a day or so, and among
the mourners will be the killer. He is reported now
to be almost crazed with grief.. He ought to be
entirely crazed, then he could bat his empty head
against the walls of an asylum and be deprived of the
weapon wherewith to blow holes in the anatomy of
acquaintances. The better course would be to send
him to jail and send every other of the same brand
of idiot to keep him company.
BOODLE RAMPANT.
THE action of the Board of Supervisors on
Monday in taking the public pound away from
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals and placing it in the hands of a politician
who will conduct it in the interest of lawlessness and
boodle is the last of a long line of offenses against
decency which have been committed by the present
supervisorial ring. Captain Delany is responsible for
this stroke of statesmanship. He is chairman of the
Committee on Health and Police, and it is he who
has made the other Supervisors "dissatisfied" With
the administration of the pound. Members of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals de-
Clare that his dissatisfaction has arisen out of a
failure to blackmail them to the tune of $500.
Captain Delany's committee is the same one that
issues permits for prize fights. According to an ex
pugilist quoted in yesterday's Call he and his col
leagues are issuing these permits for coin. "Young
Mitchell"' is willing to swear that a broker claiming
to represent members of the Committee on
Health and Police demands that every promoter of
a ring contest shall disgorge from $250 to $500 before
the necessary permission to victimize the public is
granted. The evidence of Delany's attempt to black
mail the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals is positive and direct. Moreover, its source
is eminently respectable. "Young Mitchell's" testi
mony is equally positive and direct.
- If it be true, as is thus specifically charged, that
Captain Delany and his colleagues on the Committee
on Health and Police are speeding their tj/ne holding
up citizens for money, instead of continuing in offi
cial positions where they may misrepresent their con
stituents their proper place is in jail. Surely there
is a law against the sale of prize fight permits as well
as against attempted official blackmail. Where
is the Grand Jury? Is it possible that
body will pass these charges by un
noticed? Has the moral sense of the people of
this city become so blunted by constant contact with
boodle Supervisors that it cannot be aroused when
it is discovered that the dirty coin of bribery and
blackmail is being jingled under its very nose?
So far as the public pound is concerned its trans
fer to the domain of politics once more is in the na
ture of an official crime. The boodlers in the Board
of Supervisors who have brought this about deserve
no consideration whatever. They are a band of
highbinders over whom none of the moral restraints
which keep ordinary rascals out ol Jail possess any
influence. What should be' done with them is to
prosecute them. They have unquestionably taken
the pound away from the decent people who were con
ducting it because they could not make it pay tribute
to the corruption fund which they have established.
An investigation of the prize fight permits may be
left to the slow processes of the Grand Jury, but the
subject of the pound should be taken up by some
body who will instantly land Captain Delany and his
collection of official bandits'in jail.
There is a limit beyond which it is intolerable to
press human patience. -We think this limit has been
reached in the pound matter.
Fault is being found because the crews of Oak
land ferry boats are slow in rescuing would-be sui
cides. No very good reason appears for haste in
this. It is because of the possibility that non
suicidal people may tumble overboard that there ap
pears a reason for the crews to learn to launch a sav
ing craft without indulging in so much deliberation.
It is said that the purpose of sending the Mohican
to Samoa will be to give the natives an object les
son. This is playing on the simplicity of the natives.
If they get scared at the Mohican they would prob
ably fall in a dead faint at the sight of a real modern
ship.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1898.
WHERE BLAME RESTS.
VIRTUALLY the whole responsibility for the
numerous accidents resulting from the fender
less street cars in this city, rests upon the Su
pervisors. They have the power to compel the com
panies running the cars to adopt suitable safety ap
pliances, but they refuse to exercise it. More than
two years ago they adopted an ordinance requiring
all street cars in the city to be equipped with suitable
guards for the protection of the public. This ordi
nance i's to go int.oeffect thirty days after a form of
fender is approved by the Supervisors, but from that
time to this they have never decided what form- of j
guard should be adopted norgiven approval to any
suggested by the companies, .:.
Not long ago the San Mateo electric line for
mally notified the Supervisors that it would at on.cc
equip its cars with a safeguard if they would ap
prove it and declare it to be suitable within the
meaning of the ordinance. The Supervisors, how
ever, neglected to do so. They are seeking a fender of
their own, it seems, and until they have found one
the cars are to be left without safety appliances and
the people are to continue exposed to the danger of
death at almost every street-crossing. .
Under these circumstances public indignation will
not waste its force on the street car companies. It
may please the groundlings and the mob to howl
against the officers of these companies, but inteHi- |
gent citizens know that the true offenders in this case
are the Supervisors, who for more than two years
have failed to perform their duty, and who, even in
the face of the present storm of indignant grief over j
the killing of little Hulda Johnson, have once more I
postponed actionâ even the pretense of actionâ for
two weeks' longer.. . .. â 
1 The way in which the Supervisors have dealt with
their duty in the case would have been a farce if
the rapid succession of fatal accidents resulting from
their delay had riot converted it into a series of
tragedies affecting a hundred households^ They have
played at making tests with dummies of straw and
gone through a dozen other foolish antics to delude
the people into the belief they were about to take
action. Each successive death by the trolley has
been followed by some such performance of folly
or fraud. The talk goes on, the tests continue, and
so do the deaths, but we are apparently as far from
the adoption of suitable safeguards to-day as we were
a year ago. . . . . â  'â â '
Unless all evidence is at fault there is but one ex
planation for this shameful and criminal delay on the
part of the Supervisors, and that comes so promptly
to the mind of every citizen it is hardly necessary to
state it. The Supervisors are clearly waiting for an
arrangement with some company that manufactures
fenders. They are not making tests to see which fen
der is the best, but holding out to see which com
pany will pay the highest price for their approval of
its goods. Every delay bears all the marks of being
nothing more nor less than a bid for boodle.
The situation is too plain to be mistaken. The lives
of the people are endangered while corrupt officials;
dicker for coin and seek to make a profit out of the
blood of the victims crushed befieatn the wheels of
the fenderless cars. It is an issue for the Grand
Jury. The Supervisors must he made to act whether
they get their price or not. 1; ; ; .
LAW AND EXPEDIENCY.
1N his speech on the Teller resolution Mr. Bailey
for the fiatists said: "There is not a lawyer in the
United States or any other country -who will ven
ture, on his professional reputation, to dehy that our;
national bonds can be paid in Btlver."
Mr. Baiiey has therein the singular experience of
stating a fact Every one knows that the United
States can pay their debts in silver, for the Govern
ment is a sovereignty and there is no power to com
pel it to pay at all. It can give its bondholders
something or nothing, just as it pleases. It can re
pudiate every penny it owes and its creditors will be
absolutely without recourse.
Therefore, of course, it can pay its debts in dollars
worth only 50 cents. Mr. Bailey has made no discov
ery. Repudiation of the half or the whole of the
national debt cannot be prevented. There is nothing
in the constitution to guard against it. There is no
tribunal before whose bar the nation can be sum
moned to plead if impeached for the dishonor.
Whenever the people elect a President and a maj
ority of the House and Senate in favor of repudia
tion every obligation of the Government will be
come worthless in the hands of its holder. Mr.
Bailey and those who stand with him desire at pres
ent to repudiate half of the debt. But in a little while
they may seem to stand where they now accuse the
sound money men of standing, for by teaching the
safety and expediency of repudiating half the national
debt they invite into the field the past masters of
demagogy, who will challenge Mr. Bailey to give a
good reason why the whole debt cannot be re
repudiated, as well as half of it.
It is the knowledge of the absolute correctness of
Mr. Bailey's position that the debt can be half re
pudiated that drives into common association in
politics the men who know that repudiation, while
not prevented by law, is canonized against by ex
pediency. Whether practiced in whole or in part, it
finally destroys our public credit. A nation without
credit is a nation without hope. It may lose credit
through exhaustion of resources and be comforted
by the world's compassion. But if it lose credit by
willful repudiation while solvent and abounding in.
resources it wins the world's contempt and its citi
zens may be spat upon by slaves.
It is the ambition of Mr. Bailey's party to control
the next Congress by a majority large enough to
override the veto and enact repudiation of half the
debt. If this be done the Fifty-seventh Congress will
be elected on the issue of repudiating the other half
of the debt, and Mr. Bailey can safely ask the same
question and his challenge will get the same answerâ
The United States can repudiate 50 per cent of its
debt.
While the Police Commissioners are planning to
shift a few captains they would be wise to shift a few
patrolmen entirely off the force. Policemen who
without warrant assume the right to invade private
houses ought to be treated as burglars, and if the
householder abstain from shooting them, to be glad
of no worse penalty than dismissal.
Sacramento is likely to be left without a police
court, but the loss will be less than San Francisco's
would be under a similar experience. Sacramento
has no Judge Campbell, and its judicial whiskers are
of an ordinary type.
A Detroit capitalist proposes to prove that the
Bland- Allison bill: is unconstitutional. Possibly it is.
If it stands in the way of the capitalist undoubtedly
it is. Gradually a suspicion is arising that the con
stitution is unconstitutional. â¢ â '. _â â 
There is something almost pathetic in the State
ment of the Spring Valley Water Company that it
lost money during the last year. Has the gas com
pany also suffered the buffeting of poverty? .
THE OAKLAND WATER COMBINE.
IT is now evident the exposure made by The Gall
of the proposed combination of the rival water
companies of Oakland was most timely and op
portune to the interests of the people of that city.
Warning having been given, the citizens of Oakland
are on their guard and prepared to contest every
effort that may be made to fix water rates at exces
sive amounts for the spoliation of the public and the
enrichment of the combine. . â . â 'â  .-â ' . '
Under our law, as construed by the courts,
municipal authorities in fixing water rates
are compelled to allow the water companies a
fair degree of interest on the capital invested.
It is therefore of prime importance to the people of
every community to see to it that investments in
public utilities are honestly and legitimately made, for.
if two companies can combine their capital stock at
the amounts fixed by themselves it will be equally
possible for a dozen to. combine and demand rates
sufficient to return a profit on the whole. .
The proposed combination in Oakland, if carried
out, will have a capital stock of about $12,000,000, and
rates, fixed to yield 5 per cent interest on that amount
would compel the people of Oakland to pay $600,000
annually for water. Moreover, the way would be
prepared for another set of capitalists, or perhaps
the same set, to start a third company and eventually
add another $6,000,000 to the stock on which interest
must be paid. It would be a bonanza io the water
companies, but death to the consumers.
The danger of excessive capitalization by means of
combination and reorganization of companies con
trolling public utilities is by no means a remote one.
More than one community in the United States is
suffering now the evil effects of just such trans
actions. It is an easy methotf of settling controver
sies between competing companies and has proven so
profitable to the owners of the companies that all
of them are more or less inclined to adopt it.
All evidence points to the conclusion that the two
companies which have been supplying Oakland with
water are now ready to pool their issues and com
bine at. the expense of the general public. A year
ago, when water rates were under consideration by
the Oakland City Council, a representative of one of
the companies said to the Couricilmcn: "If you.
do not abide by the law and give us a fair rate of
interest on our investment, there is but one resource
left to capital; that is combination."
Thq Call has taken up this question as it: did that
of the water contest in Los Angeles in the interests
of the general good. It has no antagonism to in-;
vested . capital. It will give continuous : aid to the
cause of justice and fair dealing with â the : public, but
the battle in each city must be fought by the citizens
themselves. The warning has been given to Oak
land, and the scheme of the combine exposed. Now
let the voters see to it that their Counciirnen do not
betray them on any point involved in the contest.
THE NEWS FROM THE ORIENT.
p-Ny OUBTLESS the dispatches from European
I J capitals concerning the situation in-. China are
* â ' as amusing to the gifted. gentlemen who con
coctthem as to the American reader. To send an
nouncements at one time that the Kaiser has the
upper hand on the Chinese coast, on the next day
that Great Britain is dominant and on the third day
that Russian has grabbed and holds everything in
sight, must be a pleasing occupation to a man who
is paid for it and has nothing el?e to do.
In the meantime the situation in China is ail affair
of gtaye importance, in which serious people take ari
interest. That interest is riot satisfied by the ever
changing reports and rumors of European capitals.
It dpes. not require a telegram every day to let us
know that British papers claim Great Britain has
won a diplomatic victory, that German papers as
sert the supremacy of Germany in the Orient to be
an assured thing from this time on, and that Russian
newspapers say nothing. One might as well read the
startling interviews with Pope and Queen and Kaiser
which the yellow journalists write as they sip their
beer in the dives of New York.
Under these circumstances it is gratifying to be
able to announce that The Call will soon receive its
news from China direct and not through the medium
of European journals. This is to be accomplished
by the alliance of The Call with the New York Her
ald, a special correspondent, J. L. Stickney, repre
senting the two papers, being now well on his way to
the scene of European aggression on the Chinese
coast. His dispatches will not have to pass under the
supervision of diplomatists and official censors.
They will give to the public definite information con
cerning the situation and enable the reader to form
an intelligent opinion of the movements of the rival
powers.
In a time comparatively short the special letters
to The Call and the Herald will be forthcoming.
No expense will be spared to get these accurate and
full reports as swiftly as can be accomplished by the
use of steam and electricity. Mr. Stickney is one of
the most energetic as well as one of the most pains*
taking and reliable of the younger generation of cor
respondents and can be counted on to forward the
news of every important event in his field of action
as soon as it is possible to do so.
Although the dispatches which have reached this
country of the situation in China have Â«been contra
dictory and confusing, enough has been made known
to show the serious nature of the complications there
and the imminent danger of a general war which would
involve nearly all Europe as well as China and Japan.
It would be difficult tinder such circumstances ta
overrate the value of reliable news from the scene of
the impending conflict,, and The Call and Herald dis
patches will be of vast importance since they will
afford the only information open to the general pub
lic oh which an intelligent estimate may be made of
the prospects of war or peace so long as the present
crisis lasts.
Women have been recognized at last. New York's
new State House is to contain in marble the faces of
Captains Molly Pitcher and Susan B. Anthony. But
where is Charlotte Smith? Now there's a. female who
in justice to herself and humanity ought to be turned
into stone right away. ,:.-.";
The observant spectator cannot help but wonder
whether Vining does not experience a sense of dis
appointment when one of his justly celebrated cars
merely bumps a citizen and does not kill him.
C. P. Huntingdon's tendency to confound his iden
tity with that of the United States will soon result
in his contributing his mortal parts to the creation
of a dull thud. ..
It would be gratifying to be able to state that the
charges of blackmail against certain Supervisors
came as a surprise. :
There is no avoiding the conclusion that the time
for Senator Teller to shed, a few more tears has ar
rived. ...
The pound is now in politics, and a iot of politic
cians ought to be in the pound.

pay day he had not been allured by the
blandishments of the fickle bookmaker.
On that day the two boys'were given
a half-holiday in addition to their month

financial affairs, deploring the fact that
his wages were So low and tips so few

here is a story upon a reporter who, in
consequence of the printer taking affairs
into his own hands, was suspended for
two weeks from the benefits of the pny
roll. In Richmond, Va., there is a large
organization known as the Hollywood
Memorial Association, and every June
the ladies set aside a day for the deoorn
tion of the graves of the many Confed
erate dead who are buried in the ceme
tery from which the organization take*
Its name. The society has many adjunct
societies that work under its direction.
The president of one of those is Mrs.
Blank, a rich society leader, who aspires
to literary attainments. Her Immediate
branch of the organization held its an
niversary meeting- last spring and she
read before it an especially prepared nd
dress, in which she said: "Lot us never
forget that as a society we owe our ex
istence to the Hollywood Memorial As
sociation." She had abbreviated tho
name and used in her copy the letter 3
"H. M. A." When, with an air of pride,
she turned the address over to the pa
tient reporter he thankfully accepted it
and assured her that it should appear in
its entirety.
In editing- the copy the reporter drew
a ring around the letters "H. M. A.," as
a sign to the printer to spell the name
out in full. The next day when he came
down to the office he found upon his desH
a note from the managing editor asking
for a few moments of his valuable time.
He entered his chief's sanctum to fln<l
there Mrs. Blank, who with a deeply inÂ«
jurcd air was telling how she had been
made to appear ridiculous in the eyes of
her friends. Then the reporter was in
formed in no uncertain terms that ha
could work for two weeks just for the
fun of the thing.
It occurred to him that he might find
an explanation In Mrs. Blank's address,
and he did, for there, in hard, cold type,
the printer had set up the sentence, "Let
us never forget that as a society we owl
our existence to the Holy Master Above. "*

on his farni at New Rochelle, N. V., and
they were allowed to remain there until

by William Corbett, a then prominent

publican: notions he favored would be
fostered by that act. In that he was
mistaken and eventually, in 1.836, the re

were buried there.

MR. STEWART AND PINE PILES
Befuses to Give the Lowest Price for
Such Timber.
George W. Stewart; the manager of the
Pacific Company, Jri alluding to the
allegation that he was receiving a larger
price for piles than is usually paid by the
Harbor Commissioners, would neither af
firm nor cjeny the report.
He claims to have quoted prices to the
board in direct competition with the
other lumber dealers whose names were
mentioned In the original bid, and his
price being the most favorable to that
body tor what reason he will not Say
he was awarded the contract.
He emphasizes the fact that he did not
receive more than the jobbing price for
his lumber by entering into a long dis
cussion of the relative prices of pi)<Â»s and
the competition war that is being waged
by the lumber companies of the State
for the disposal of this kind of ma
terial.
Mr. Stewart was extremely taciturn on
the subject of the value of pine lumber
for the months of October, November
and December of last year, and he re
fused to cite the lowest price for piles
during that time, giving as an excuse
that it would involve several hours of
fatiguing search of the records. The
price at Which piles were disposed of,
however, during those months is as fol

Stewart claims that last month prices

James Hprrigan, the Drunken Father,
:â¢: Arrested for. Cruelty to
Children.
James Horrigan, a shoemaker living
on Felton and Cambridge streets, Sil
ver Heights, wa3 arrested at an early
hour yesterday morning by Policemen
Belyea and White on a charge of cru
elty to children. He appeared before
Judge Low and the case was continued
till to-day.
Hprfigari went home drunk Monday
night, and as usual, when in his cups,
commenced to abuse his wife. As he
had often threatened "to do for her"
and acted in a threatening manner she
became scared and fled from the house
with her three children, Herbert, 12
years of age, Birdie, 9, and Chester, 7.
The boys had not time to put on their
shoes or get- their hats, and the mother
and children v.andered around for
hours in the run without knowing
where to go for shelter.
About 3 o'clock in the morning they
came to a vacant house near Bartlett
and Valencia streets and thought of
taking shelter there, but the Children
were afraid and finally they took ref
uge under a sidewalk at Army and Mis
sion streets. The children were cold
and hungry and the elder boy suggest
ed that he should go to the restaurant
on the opposite corner and buy a bot
tleful of hot coffee and some bread. He
crawled from under the sidewalk and
got the coffee and bread, As he was
returning he was met by Policeman
Bel yea. who questioned him and
promptly Tang for the patrol wagon
and the mother and children were
taken to. the Seventeeth-street station
where they were properly cared for by:
Lieutenant Burke. A few hours later
they were taken to the City Prison
and placed in* charge of the matron.
Policemen Belyea and White went to
Horrigan f s house and found him in a
drunken sleep in bed. He was com
pelled to put on his clothes and accom
pany the officers to the police station
where a charge of cruelty to children
was registered aganist him. He felt
bitter against his wife for being the
means of causing his arrest, and she
told the police yesterday that if he got
out of prison She believed he would
kill her.
"He is a quiet man -when he is so
ber," said Mrs. Horrigan, "but unfor
tunately that is not often, and when
he is drunk he quarrels with every
body, including myself. He has sev
eral times taken the pledge, but in
every instance broke it almost imme
diately. I want to get away from him
with my children, as I don't believe he
can ever stop drinking."
Officer McMurry of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
is looking after the case and will see
that the mother and children are pro
vided for. They will be kept in the
prison until the case la disposed of to
day. ; ''â¢â â ' .- -. . â ' .
EIGHT MEN IN THE BOX.
A Jury Slowly Being Gathered To
gether to Hear the Case Against
Theodore ITigel.
Eight jurors now occupy the box to
hear the evidence against Theodore Figel
for the murder of Isaac Hoffman Yes
terday morning a special venire of fifty
talesmen was examined, and out of that
number only one juror was found. Wil
liam Hinckley of 3708 Seventeenth' street
was examined at length as to his ideas on
crime and criminals, his emotions regard
ing capital punishment and other rele
vant Issues, and was found not wantine
Talesman after talesman was examined
but as no others were found competent.'
Judge Cook issued an order that 100 more
be summoned to appear in courtâ fifty to
morrow morning and fifty Thursday
morning. It is thought that the box may
be filled by the end of the week and the
taking of evidence will then begin.
Savings Society Wins a Suit.
By a decision handed down by Judge
Seawell yesterday the Savings and Loan
Society regains $2,329 83 from the city and
county, that amount having been paid
into the treasury under protest as a tax
levied on school and State bonds. In
his decision Judge Seawell held that as
it had been proved during the trial of the
case that the asesed bonds referred to
as "State bonds" were "municipal bonds' I
the Savings and Loan Society was en
titled to recover, but had the Assessor
simply referred to the property taxed
as bonds the tax would have been sus
tained. An Increase of 20 per cent on
school bonds was also held to be Illegal
and judgment was given accordingly.
Sues for a Settlement.
Michael Hawkins has commenced suit
against Eleanor Martin and J. Downey to
recover $10,575 alleged to be due him from
the estate of the late Annie Donahue.
The defendants are the executors of the
Donahue estate, and the plaintiff alleges
that they decline, to settle; hence the
suit.
FINANCIAL REPORTS
THAT DID NOT TELL
EVERY TRANSACTION
Oaklanci Water Companies Had Some Ex
penses "Which. Were Not Down on
the City Clerk's List.
A Large Item of Gommis
sions That Was
Left Out
Little Pumping Episode Which
Also Failed to "Be Shown
as Expense.
DANGEROUS IGNORANCE.
Old Members of the City Council
Show a Remarkable Want of
Knowledge.
There are some things regarding the
finances of the two Oakland water
companies which the reports filed with
the City Clerk of that city lasÂ£ Mon
day do not show.
For Instance there is nothing in the
report of the Oakland Water Company
showing the amount of money paid for
waterbacks for the stoves that have
been injured by the alkali in the water.
Notwithstanding this discrepancy it is
a well-known fact that when subscrib
ers have complained that the water
Was ruining their stoves, the president
of the company promised to replace all
the waterbacks that were injured.
Not only did he make these promises,
but it is said by those who are in a po
sition to know that the promises were
so well fulfilled that for a while it
looked very much as if there would be
a deficiency in the funds of the com
pany because of the frequent demands
far making over stoves.
Then, again, there is nothing in these
reports to show how much money was
paid out for negotiating loans of vari
ous sorts or for selling stock, yet it is
well understood that both companies
have paid good commissions to various
people for their assistance in obtain
ing financial aid for the erstwhile war
ring corporations.
For instance it is reported, and on
very good authority, too, that a gen
tleman named Moffatt got quite a lit
tle sum of money and would have got
ten quite a deal more had he succeed
ed in getting the plant of the Oakland
Water Company unloaded upon the
city for the neat sum of $6,000,000. Of
course the fact that the plant was hot
worth one-sixth of that suni made no
difference in the contract. Unfortu
nately for the plans of the company
and Mr. Moffatt and Mr. Dargie a re
form Council took hold of affairs and
the whole matter fell through. It fell
through so far in fact that the com
pany was compelled to sell water in or
dÂ£r to keep up appearances. These lit
tle things will happen to pf event pro
moters from carrying out their
schemes. ;
Had it not been for the reform Coun
cil putting a stop to the proposed sale,
it is possible that the Contra Costa
Water Company would not have had
time to get that large centrifugal
pump to work on the pond where the
Oakland artesian wells are located.
It may not be generally known, but
It is a fact, that the artesian wells
which are supposed to supply a perpet
ual and unlimited quantity of water of
the purest sort are located in a little
fresh water pond at the mouth of a
creek Which rushes down with such
force that it keeps the salt water of the
ocean out of the wells. The encroach
ment of the sea upon these wells has
been noted, however, and the result
has been that It was necessary to dig
other wells farther back from the in
coming tides.
The little fresh water pond in which
the wells are located is a delusion and
a snare so far as keeping the water in
the wells free from saline pollution ia
concerned, as was conclusively shown
when the Contra Costa Water Com
pany took it upon itself, for the good
of f he public, of course, to see just how
much of a defense the pond was. This
friend of the public, at considerable ex
pense, sent across the bay to San Fran
cisco and hired one of the largest cen
trifugal pumps. A corner of the pond
was leased and the pump set to work.
From late in July until early in Octo
ber, in the year .1893, the residents of
the vicinity were annoyed by the con
stant thumping of the big pump, but
what was a little annoyance to a few
when the welfare of a whole commun
ity was at stake? The pump kept on,
and suddenly: the people who wereac
customed to the clear and pellucid
water of the Oakland Water Company
began to get a bad taste in their
mouths, and many a dinner was spoiled
and many a man used words that are
considered improper In polite society,
and rushed to the nearest dispenser of
liquid refreshments in order to get that
tired feeling from his mouth. The wa
ter was decidedly brackish. The pumps
had done their work well, and the
fresh water pond had disappeared in
the bay and the salt water had come
in and contaminated the wells.
The Oakland Water Company's wa
ter had been proven bad by that great
friend of the public, the Contra Costa
Water Company.
Had Moffatt. â  and Dargie attempted
to make that $6,000,000 sale and inci
dentally rake in that $200,000 the Con
tra Costa Water Company, in the ordi
nary parlance of the day.wouldn't have
done a thing to the sale.
The company that had those artesian
wells then hus the same wells now, and
in the present "agreement," as it is
called by President Dingee, the com*
pany which, posed as the benefactor of
the public at that time, and the com
pany which was held up as a horrible
example, now lie down peacefully to
gether,, and have formed a combina
tion, or "agreement," which means that
the city of Oakland is in danger. .
The people have great: confidence in
the personnel of the City Council, but
stranger things have happened than
that people have trusted officials to
their sorrow. If the indications as
shown by Interviews go for anything

then the people must look out for the
members of the Council who think that
there is a possibility that the rates
need adjusting.
When one trusted member of the City
Council is not only the bosom friend of
the manager of the Contra Costa Water
Company, but also has a large amount
of that company's stock, if reports are
true, it is time that his actions were
given close scrutiny. When another
member of the Council who has been in
his seat through all the changing vi
cissitudes of party affiliations and in
whose back room every water rate has
been adjusted that has been fixed for
years says that he knows nothing
about water rates it begins to look as
if something were wrong.
And there are others who will also
bear watching. It does not look right
when the oldest members of the Coun
cil show the densest ignorance regard
ing matters that are of Vital interest
to their constituents.
Chairman Henneberry of the Fire
and Water Committee will call a meet
ing this week for the purpose of start
ing the readjustment. What this com
mittee may do will have its effect on
the action of the Council, and it is in
this committee that the arguments of
water companies will be made. It is
incumbent upon the people, if they de-
Fire to protect themselves from an ex
tortionate rate, to see to it that the ac
tion of this committee be open and
above board.
Military Social Club.
The second grand ball of the Presidio
Social Club will be given at Union Square
Hall on Tuesday evening, February 8. In
the membership of the social organiza
tion the First Infantry, Third Artillery
and Fourth Cavalry, U. S. A., are repre
sented. The band of the First Infantry
will discourse music at the dancing func
tion next Tuesday evening-. The club was
organized to promote social entertain
ment by giving one ball a month during
the season.
Charged With Burglary.
Bernard O'Connell was booked at the
City Prison yesterday by Policeman Hy
man on a charge of burglary. He broke
into the residence of J. Hogan, 3400 Fol
som street, last Saturday and stole some
blankets and other articles.

SUDDEN SURGE
OF SYMPATHY IN
THE HEARSTLINGS
Silly Play to Make Capital Out of the
Sorrow and Suffering: of the
Unfortunate.
A Warrant Sworn Out Against a Man They Knew Was Not
Here and Based Upon an Ordinance Which They
Knew Was Long Inoperative.
â VHiat will the Examiner and its man
aging editor do next? .â 'â '
The latest feat of the one acting for
the other has been to swear out a war
rant for the arrest of H. E. Hunting
ton on the charge of violating a city
ordinance requiring all street cars to
be equipped with safety guards, the
alleged reason for the action being that
the Examiner and its managing editor
â¢were moved by the death of little
Hulda Johnson to do something to en
force the law, to save Hy.eSi and to pun
ish the street-car magnates for the
habitual practice of homicide.
The alleged reason sounds lofty and
noble, the action seems brave and self
sacrificing. It i 3 a pity that both are
fakes. . â  â  â â ...)â â ":â ': : \ ',- â 
At the time the managing editor of
the Examiner swore out the warrant
for the arrest of Mr. Huntington, he
knew that Huntington was on his way
East, thousands of miles out of reach.
He knew that the ordinance which he
charged Mr. Huntington with violating
had been amended so as to make it in
operative at present, and, therefore,
that it had not been violated either by
Huntington or any one else. He knew
that the officers of the railway compa
nies are not responsible for the lack of
safeguards on the cars inasmuch :as
the Board of Supervisors have taken
upon themselves the responsibility of
determining what device shall be used
for that purpose.
The managing editor of the Exami
ner knew all of these things, and he
knew another thing: he knew that he
was playing a lying, brazen game to
make profit for himself and the fugi
tive Hearst out of the public sentiment
aroused by the death of little Hulda
Johnson.
To < oin money, to acquire a false re
pute for humanity of spirit out of the
general sorrow caused by the dreadful
accident that deprived of life a little
child, all this elaborate fraud, this
shameful false pretense, this lyintr
show of prosecution was planned out.
arranged, put into practice and bla
zoned to the world. â  ' .-..
There is no courage displayed in
swearing out a warrant for the arrest
of a man who is so far out of town
that he cannot be. injured enough to
move him to wrath nor strike back if
he feels Insulted. There is; no intelli
gence displayed in charging a man with
violating an ordinance .''which is inop
erative. There is no honor shown In
accusing an absent man of an offense
of which it is known he is not guilty.
There is no decency in trying to turn
the bereavement of a stricken family
into a source of pecuniary profit.
There is no sense in playing before an
intelligent public a trick which is cer
tain to be exposed next day. But when
did Hearst, his managing editor; or any
Of the Hearstlings, ever show courage,
intelligence, honor, decency or sense on
an occasion that promised them a
profit by a display of hypocrisy, mean
ness, indecency and low cunning?
The managing editor who devised
this scheme of posing as public prose
cutor on the part of the people and the
owner of The Ivxaminer who /misem
ploys him as a means of insulting San
Francisco, are both of them charged
before our courts with violations of
law. Hearst is virtually a fugitive from
justice. He dare not come to the land
of his birth for fear of the law officers
that await him. His managing editor
is under indictment for criminal slan
der. This same editor has known be
fore -what it is to be jailed. The two
are just the kind of men to raise rail
ing accusations against others when
they have a sneaking belief they can
escape the consequences.
The game has be^n played for what
it is worth. It was blazoned forth with
a blare of lurid language under scare
heads by The Examiner yesterday and
it is closed up and ended to-day. The
sensational fake devised to make a
profit out of the death of the poor little
victim of the trolley has served but to
illustrate again the depths t the de
pravity of the demagoguo organ, and
to cause intelligent peo>,.t. to ask again:
TVhat will The Examiner do next?
The falseness of the bluff of the man
aging editor of the Examiner is dis
closed by the following records show
ing the original fender ordinance

quent order of July 2f>, 1595, which ren

Attorney Frank Kelly appeared In
Judge Conlan's court yesterday morn
ing and stated that H. E. Huntington,
president of the Market-street Railway
Company had gone to New York,
which was known to the managing edi
tor; of the Examiner when he swore to
the complaint Monday for Mr. Hunt
ington's arrest. The warrant was re
turned to the clerk of the court to be
held till Mr. Huntington returns to the
city.
These records not only expose the
falseness of the managing editor of the
Examiner "in his pretense at prose
cuting: Mr. Huntington, but also show
that the Board of Supervisors Is re
sponsible for the lack of fenders on the
street cars. The order of July 29, 1895,
clearly states; that the fender ordi
nance shall not go Into effect until
thirty days after the adoption by the
board of the particular device or de
vices to be used."
It is a common rumor on the street
that a fender device has not been
adopted because eight members of the
Board of Supervisors are holding out
for iqQQ apiere In payment for approv
ing a particular fender. So far as these
men are concerned until the boodle is
forthcoming the cars may be run free
without fenders and the people left ex
posed to the danger of . being maimed
or killed. : : /
If this rumor is correct it is only a :
sum; of $4000 that stands between the \
people and the fatal accidents that
have become so common.
Had $500 each been paid to eight men '
little Hulda Johnson might to-day be i
alive. . â ...:â¢ â ' â¢ . j
While the records show that the Su-.l
per visors are responsible for delay in
providing fenders the street car com
panies are not wholly free from blame. !
The directors of the Market-street line
have now decided to equip their cars ;
with fenders without waiting for the i
action of the Supervisors. They should '
have done this before.
GOING AHEAD ANY HOW.,
The Market - Street Railway |
Decides to Have Fenders.
Yesterday the directors of the com- j
pany considered the subject of attach- !
ing fenders to the electric cars. The
discussion turned largely upon the re
peated delays of the Board of Super- I
visors. Time and again the board has
been urged to take some definite ac- !
tionâ to designate some fender or
device, but one delay has followed an
other until the patience of the railroad j
company is exhausted.
At the meeting Vining submitted ai
communication to William F. Herrin,
chief counsel of the corporation, in j
which he reviewed all the communica- j
tions sent to the Board of Supervisors
from May, 1895,uritil January; 1898. All
the tests made, all the tests '.reconi-'i
mended, and all the agreements to ob- ;
serve tests Were enumerated.: The ac- j
tinn of the board in rejecting devices
recommended by the railroad company j
-vas particularly noted.
When asked yesterday what action
j the company proposed to take in the
i matter of providing safety device."' Mr. i
j Herrin said: -'At a meeting of diree- j
tors to-day we resolved to put on at I
once the best device obtainable. Our i
patience In waiting on the Board of Su- . !
pervisors is exhausted. We have tested j
everything the Supervisors have sug
gested. They asked us to introduce the
model of fenders used in Eastern cities,
and at our expense we brought such
devices here, but still they refused to
adopt one. We now propose to exer
cise our best judgment in applying a
! device to save human life and will I
i equip our cars with fenders. Should j
j the Board of Supervisors hereafter pass
I an ordinance requiring our company to
I put on some other fender or device we
i will go Into court and fight the propo
j sitlon on its merits. The Supervisors i
j will be compelled to p^Â»ve that they I
I have found something better than we j
introduced."
E. P. Vining, manager of the Market
street system, said: "We have been
awaiting the action of the Board of Su
j pervisors since 1895. In July of that
j year the Supervisors passed a resolu
tion extending the time for equipping
cars with fenders until thirty days
I after some particular device or devices
had been adopted and approved by the
! board. In November, 1897, the Super
visors adopted a resolution referring
the matter to the Committee on Health
and Police, with notice that said com-
I mtttee would test devices. We have
tested thirty fenders, among them
many of the kind that had been ac- j
oepted in Eastern cities. We tested the i

\ Providence, Pettitt. Bodemartn, Marke- !
i ley, Reeve, Market street, Blakestead-
Barnes-Riggs, Sickels, foreman, Craw
ford. Boston, West/Jones and others. I
We have complied with every sugges
! tion and request of the Board of Su
; pervlsors. : . :
"We have expended more money In
'â  making tests than It would cost to I
equip every car on our Bystem with the '
; best device known. We now propose '
to select the best fender exhibited, the i
one which in" pur judgment will afford
the greatest protection to hun.an life, j
and equip our cars with the accepted I
device. We shall wait no longer on the \
Board of Supervisors."
Mr. Vlning Is squarely set against !
the use of any projecting fender and
Is armed with; statistics from various
roads to show that the projections harm \
\ more people than they protect. He con- i
, tends that hundreds of thousands of
; people daily take the chance of cross- j
j ing the tracks In the face of approach- |
i cars. They measure the distance by a ;
'glance at the body of the car on an
.even line of their vision.
A: miscalculation Is seldom made j
when there is ho projecting object near j
the surface of the ground. A fender!
ahead of the car Is frequently un- j
noticed and the result is that the per- '
son. seeking to cross Immediately In
1 front of the car Is knocked over by the
i projecting object. Mr. Vlning contends
that the fenders placed on the cable- |
cars here shortly after the introduc- ,
tlon of the cable system were taken off.
as experience taught the managers of :
the lines that the fenders increased
the casualties. Mr. Vlning believes j
that a dropping scoop attachment to i
the truck is a good safety device.
Warning From the Mayor.
Mayor Phelan has sent the following
communication to the manager of the
Market-street Railway Company:
SAN FRANCISCO. Feb. 1, 1898.
E. P. Vining. Esq.. Manager Market
street Railway Companyâ Dear Sir: A
resolution was introduced in the Board of
Supervisors yesterday calling attention
to the fact that your cars run at a sy*ed
THE SAX FKAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUAEY 2, 1893.
in excess of eight miles an hour, which
Is the limit allowed by law. and also re
questing that the proper officers enforce
the law:
I have to-day verified the complaint and
find, for Instance, that cars No. 1010. 1012 and
1164 were running on Mission street at the
rate of twelve miles an hour. In the ab
sence of proper brakes and fenders, this
rate of speed, aside from the violation of
the law. adds very much to the danger of
the public:
I therefore call upon you to bo modify
your schedule as to require the cars to
run within the legal limit and request
you to advise me at once of your inten
tions In the premises and when such a
schedule will be put Into effect. I call
your attention In this connection to sec
tion 501 of the Civil Code, sections 15. 16.
17. 1390 and 1357 of the Penal Code, under
which I will be compelled to proceed un
less within a reasonable time, not ex
ceeding one week, that is to say by Tues
day, February 8, you have taken such
action as the law indicates and requires.
Yours truly,
JAMES D. PHELAN, Mayor.
MEXICAN CIGARS.
Customs Inspectors Mullen and
Richardson Frustrate an At
tempt of Smugglers.
Customs Inspectors Mullin and Rich*
ardson, detailed to guard the Orizaba,
which arrived from. Guaymas and Ma-
ZRtlan at midnight of Monday, had their
attention attracted at 4 o'clock yesterday
morning by a splash near the stern of
the steamer. They found that some one
on board had attached a line to the ves
sel's stern and had attempted to throw
It. with a hook at the end, to the wharf,
expecting that the hook would be caught
on a stringer or that the end of the line
would be caught by some one on the
dock. But the line fell short and into the
water.
The inspectors Immediately boarded the
vessel and found on the deck, close to
the end of the line, two sacks containing
boxes of Mexican clpars. A more ex
tended search revealed In a closet two
more sacks of clears, making 4000 In all.
They were seized by the inspectors and
will be confiscated.
Three gallons of mescal were found
later in the day on a passenger who was
landing- from the steamer. The passen
ger did not know he was violating the
revenue laws and made no attempt to
conceal the fiery juice of the pulque. The
stuff was seized.
THE CONTRACT LET.
Work on the Masonic Widows' and
Orphans' Home at Decoto to Be
Besumed at Once.
The trustees of the Masonic Widows'
and Orphans' Home that Is to be built
In Decoto, Alameda County, met yes
terday and after hearing the report
of the sub-committee appointed at a
previous meeting awarded the contract
tor completing the main building to '
R. P. Hurlburt, and the amount is
Shortly after the foundation was pre
pared the cornerstone was laid with all
the impressive ceremonies of the Ma
sonic order by the Grand Lodge of Cal
ifornia and the work of building con
tinued until the basement story walls
were up, when work was discontinued
for want of sufficient funds to complete
the structure. The Grand Lodge, at its
last-held annual session, came to the
rescue of the enterprise by donating
; $20,000 to it.
That, with the amount on hand and
j some in sight, placed the trustees in
a position to continue the work, and
therefore the action of yesterday was :
: had. As soon as the preliminary de
tails are arranged the work of finish
ing the main structure will be com- !
' menced and continued until the three
â¢ story building is finished, and, when it
i Is, it will be one c-f the finest of its
kind in the United States.
The Order of the Eastern Star and
the subordinate lodges will lend their
aid in the near future to raise money :
for the building fund, so that addition- '
I al structures, which will be necessary,
â maybe added to the main one. Among
ideas suggested, one is that under the
; auspices of the Masonic fraternity
: there shall be got up a grand fair in
| the Mechanics' Pavilion in this city, to
I continue for ten days or more, but as
yet nothing has been determined upon.
OIL BUSINESS PAID BETTER.
Experience of P. J. Torloting of St.
Louis in the Occupation of a
Bookmaker.
P. J. Torloting, a young- man, who gave
lip an oil business In St. I,ouls to try his
hick as a bookmaker, told a tale of woe
to Judge Gonlan yesterday, which result
ed in the Judge issuing a warrant for the
arrest of W. O. Pr.rcell on the charge of
felony embezzlement.
Torloting's tale was to the effect that
in the month of October last he got intro
duced to 'Purcell by a friend, and soon
Purcell proposed a scheme whereby they
could make lots of money. The scheme
was to form a sort of copartnership in
the business of bookmaking on the races,
and it resulted In Torlnting putting up
$1000, J. W. Ters'>hluse $1000 and A. Schlitt
$500, making $2500 altogether. Torlotlng
was to be cashier and Purcell would make
the books, getting his share of the profits.
They went to Chicago, but could not do
business there. Lexington was tried with
the same result, and finally Purcell and
Torloting came here.
By this time the $2500 had dwindled
down to $1750. When they arrived here,
Purcell being accompanied by his wife
and children, they put up at the Inter
national Hotel; but a few days later Pur
cell Tented the house 2227 Pacific avenue.
Torloting alleges that on Thanksgiving
day Purcell took the package containing
the $17d0 from his overcoat pocket with
out his knowledge, Intending to keep it,
but Torloting raised such a row that he
confessed he had the money. Purcell went
to the races the following three days,
and produced a statement that he had a
net loss of $1117 50, leaving a balance In
hand of $632 50. Since then Torloting has
been endeavoring to get from Purcell his
share of the balance, but has failed, and
now he wants him arrested.
W. O. Purcell was arrested last even
ing on a warrant, the complaining wit
ness, being P. J., Torloting. He will be
held awaiting an Investigation.

San Francisco and regularly appointed
by the Board of Police Commissioners.
Sec. 2. It shall be unlawful for any per
son or persons, corporation, organiza
tion or detective agency to ask for, so
licit, demand, collect or receive or cause
others to do so for his or her benefit any
money or valuables upon the pretense of
guarding or protecting the said person's
property from whom the same shall be
asked, demanded, solicited or received,
under the guise that they are special
policemen, duly appointed by the Board
of Police Commissioners of the city and
county of San Francisco.
Sec. 3. Any person who shall violate
any of the provisions of the above sec
tions shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,
and upon conviction shall be punished by
a fine of not less than $50 nor more than
$500, or by Imprisonment in the County
Jail not less than fifty days nor more
than six months.
Supervisor Rottanzi will father the
ordinance. He is bitterly opposed to
private watchmen representing them
selves as special police officers, and
will do all in his power to have the
proposed ordinance passed by the Su
pervisors. The Judiciary Committee of
the Supervisors will meet to-day and
consider the proposed ordinance.
It Is claimed that the men employed
by the several private detective agen
cies have been representing themselves
as special policemen, and thereby get
ting the business which should fall to
the specials appointed by the Board of
Police Commissioners.
The attorneys for the regularly ap
pointed special officers will also submit
to the Supervisors the following amend
ment to the Political Code passed by
the Legislature in 1883:
: T'pon the petition of any person, firm
or corporation to appoint a special officer
to do special service, to be paid for by
such firm or corporation, specifying the
boundary or locality at or within which
he is to act as such special officer, which
boundary or locality shall be described
In the warrant of appointment, provided
that no special officer shall be appointed
to act In the Chinese quarters, and pro
vided further that all special officers
shall report dally to the Chief of Police
and be subject to the ordinances In case
of emergency, and in no way shall such
officers be paid by the city and county.
At the meeting of the Police Commis
sioners to-night Attorneys Treadwell
and Sweeny will give notice of their
intention to aim the first blo.w at pri
vate detective agencies.
MONADNOCK ORDERED
BACK TO MARE ISLAND.
"Will Be Placed in Reserve and Her
Crew Distributed Among
Other Vessels.
If It is a fact that the Navy Depart
ment intends placing the Monadnock in
reserve and distributing her crew among
the vessels now fitting out at Mare
Island, the activity displayed in ac
complishing so unimportant a matter
would work wonders if directed occa
sionally in channels where dispatch is
a matter of some consideration.
The monitor left the city about a
month ago for Magdalena Bay, where
it was intended to hold target practice.
Yesterday the wires were hot bearing
messages from headquarters ordering
her immediate recall.
An attempt was made to catch her at
various points down the coast, but all
of the messages arrived at their desti
nation Just in time to miss the vessel
they were expected to detain.
The Government yesterday contract
ed with the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company to have the Orizaba call in at
Magdalena Bay on her next trip down
the coast and deliver to Captain Clark
of the Monadnock orders that will im
mediately bring that vessel back to this
port.
Inquiry at the various naval offices
and at the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company's place could elicit no further
information than the admission that
telegrams had been received urging the
vessel's recall, but for what reason no
one seemed to know.
Inquiries at Washington and Mare
Island brought the following replies:
WASHINGTON, Feb. I.â The Monad
nock has sailed from San Diego for Mag
dalene Bay, for target practice. The
department has decided to place this
monitor in reserve, as there is need for
her crew in manning other naval vessels
fitting out at Mare Island.
VALLEJO. Feb. Iâ The Monadnock
has been ordered back to Mare Island,
and will be placed in reserve. Officers
and crew will be cut down to a skele
ton crew to keep her In order and re
pair, in readiness to fill up the comple
ment and place her in full commission
at a moment's notice. Several ships In
the East have been placed in a similar
position.

THINKS HE HAS
A SMOOTH CROOK
Arrested by Officer Rooker and
Locked Up Until His Rec
ord Is Known.
It Is W. A. Davis, Who Is Believed to
Be a Sure-Thing Gambler
and Bunko Man. .
Officer Rooker of the California-street
station did a bit of shrewd detective
work last evening, and landed a young '
fellow who 1b believed to be a smooth j
crook and all-round confidence man. On
Monday evening a man giving his name
as W. A. Davis went into the saloon of i
Garcia & Dletz on Montgomery street i
and presented a check for $95, drawn on
a Los Angeles bank and signed by a man
named Walker, and asked the barkeeper
to cash it. Aa Davis was not known, the
request was refused. Last evening Davis
was at the saloon again, and Mr. Dietz
informed Officer Rooker of his actions of
the night before. The policeman shad
owed Davis, who went into several sa
loons in the vicinity, never spending a
cent, and, thinking 1 him a suspicious
character, took him to the station and
placed his name on the small book.
Subsequent investigation revealed the I
fact that Davis had come to this city on
the 27th inst., and registered at the Lick
House under the name of \\\ A. Ander
son. An examination of letters found in ;
his possession showed that he was in
touch with a number of gamblers of the
"sure-thing" kind. Among these was tho
following from a Frank Strong of Rands
burg, whom Davis acknowledged to be a
gambler:
"RANDSBT'RG. Jan. 17, 1898.
"Friend Kid: Received your letter, and
Will state ft is very dull here. There is
only one chance here to cop anything,
and that is to deal bank in the Verita
Theater. I have got a chance to deal.
The Ist: is payday, and I may get a hold
of a hundred for my bit. I sent for my
tools to-day. Crawford will take them
out. Write and let me know what's at
Bakersfield. If. there is anything I will
come; if not I will stay here for two
weeks. Don't forget to tell Tim about
Moore. May sends regards, and says, ;
don't drink. As ever, your friend.
"FRANK."
Another letter was from Wallis Clark,
who is a well-known tinhorn gambler.
Davis is known as being a friend of
Clark's at the haunts the two have, fre- â¢
quented. and it is said by those who know
them that neither would stop at any
thing if there was a chance of money in
Davis is a well-dressed fellow, and has '
a very oily tongue. When arrested he
did not have a cent of money on his per
son, but had a number of blank promis-
BOry notes and checks on several banks. !
In a grip in his room were several decks I
of cards, a .set of dice and a box of poker
chips. Thwe was also a bottle contain
ing a mixture of chloroform and chloral, i
which the prisoner says he kept so that
he might kill himself if he should wish
to do so.
The prisoner denied that he was a
crook, and claimed that he was an agent
for the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance
Company, and he had some of the com- :
pany's circulars in his possession. He I
gave as his reason for registering under:
an assumed name the explanation that â 
he did not want his wife to know he was
in the city, for fear she might ask him to i
send for her.
VOLUNTEERS REJOICING.
Have Received a Valuable Donation
From a Philanthropic Lady.
The Volunteers of America are rejoic
ing over a windfall which has just come
to them. An elderly philanthropic lady
who has given a great deal to charities
and whose modesty has prompted her to
request that her name be not known last
week deeded the army a valuable orange
grove located near Thermalito. The tract
of land includes some twenty acres, ten
of which is planted with bearing trees
8 or 9 years old. The grove is valued at
between $8000 and $10,000. Colonel Stur
geon, the commanding officer of the Pa
cific Coast Division of the Volunteers, is
in the city and is much pleased at the
work the officers have been doing here.
Three new missions have recently been es
tablished, oiie at Kearny and California
streets, another at Third and Howard and
the other on Ninth between Market and
Mission. The officers for the establish
ment of a new post at Sixteenth and Mis
sion are on the ground, and Post No. 5
will be in running order in a few days.

Do.g Team for Dawson.
An exhibition of dogs hauling a sled
over the frozen Alaskan trail to Dawson
was given by Fred W. Fox and his. com
panion, Al Swanson, at the foot of Market
street yesterday afternoon. Eight stout
and well-fed' dogs of the Newfoundland
species were harnesed to a Klondike sled
containing 2000 pound?*, a supply for Fox
and Swanson during their trip to. the;
frozen north, where they go in the inter
est of the Dartmoor Manufacturing Com
pany with a patented thawer, which will,
as is claimed, send heat sufficiently in
tense downward to thaw out the frozen
surface to a depth of several fpet in the
course of a few hours. The dogs were
well trained and took to the traces with
an evident determination to "reach Daw
son or burst." Fox and his companion
expect to cross the British boundary
lnslde the next forty days. They carry a
complete equipment for the trip weighing
about 2000 pounds. Should the San Fran
cisco thawer fulfill the expectations of its
inventors a great demand will be created
for hundreds of them In the Klondike dls
trlCt before next winter.
Liquor for Indians.
The TTnlted States Grand Jury yester
day found indictments against Raymond

JEFFRIES WILL
FACE JACKSON
â 
The Heavy- Weights Are
to Fight Before the
Olympic Club.
Graney Issues a Sweeping Chal
lenge to Jackson on Behalf
of Choynski.
Ryan Has Consented to Fight Choyn
eki on the. lOth of this
Month.
The Chinese puzzle does not com
pare In intricacy with the pugilistic
puzzle of the present.
The fighters, the fighting clubs and j
the City Fathers are mixed up in such j
a heavy-weight stew that it may be j
weeks before they will discover where j
they are "at."
Yesterday "Tut" Ryan positively an- ,
nounced that he would not fight ;
Choynski, and he stuck to his ulti- j
matum until late last evening, when i
the Empire Club agreed to deposit $1000 j
as a guarantee of good faith on its i
part to carry off the fight between j
Ryan and Choynski, provided that
Ryan would deposit $250 as a guarantee ,
that he (Ryan) would enter the ring j
on February 10 fully prepared to meet
Choynski.
Ryan objected to this in very em
phatic terms and declared the match |
off so far as he was concerned. At 11:30 !
o'clock last night "Tut" changed his I
mind and promised Manager Elling- j
house of the Empire Club that he I
would deposit the amount required in
the hands of Harry Corbett before noon |
to-day. Ryan was wroth yesterday j
morning over an article that appeared j
in a morning paper which stated that
at his training quarters he was j
knocked out by Lansing and in a letter ;
to The Call he said that there was not i
a word of truth in the article and that j
it was manufactured out of whole ;
cloth. He further stated that he was |
ready at any time to prove to the sat
isfaction of Lansing that he (Ryan)
is his master at the game of smash
and miss.
Director General Ellinghouse of the
Empire Club has announced that the
Ryan and Choynski fight will now take !
place, as already announced, on the I
10th inst., and that Ryan will journey ;
to his training quarters to-day to com- i
plete his training.
Last evening the directors of the Olym- j
pic Club matched Peter Jackson to
fight Jim Jeffries twenty rounds on the
evening of March 21 for a percentage i
of the house. Jackson will continue to j
train at Alameda and Jeffries will re- j
pair to Oakland, where he will be
handled by Billy Delaney.
The announcement of the match was
not made until late last evening, and
when Eddie Graney learned that the
Olympic Club had securtd the plum
he asked if the club had secured a
permit, but as Supervisor Delany has !
assured the club that it could go ahead j
and make the match the directors feel
confident that there will be no opposi
tion to the granting of the necessary
permit by the remainder of the powers
that be.
Graney said that he had been locking
for a game like Jackson for some time,
and that the colored champion would
not stand many rounds in front of
Choynski.
"I'll tell you what I will do," remark
ed Graney in the presence of several
sports who had Assembled in the tele
graphic room of the Baldwin Hotel:
"This man Jackson is not in the race
any more, and I will deposit right now |
in the hands of Charley Asher the sum i
of $250 that Choynski can stop this great J
colored fighter in twenty rounds or less
and If Choynski fails to accomplish
the job why then Jackson can take
every dollar that the house will bring, j
"Now, if his manager is game enough !
to cover this money I hope to hear
from him to-morrow."
Graney deposited $250 with Asher,
and if Jackson will not notice the chal
lenge there may be broader challenges
issued in the near future.
In case Ryan had not changed his
mind concerning his proposed fight
with Choynski, the Empire Club in
tended to offer Joe Goddard good in
ducements to take "Tut's" place, but
now everything looks bright again for
the Empire Club.
Continental League.
The usual monthly meeting of Continen
tal League will be held at Saratoga Hall,
814 Geary street, to-night. Business of

SESSION OF THE HOUSE.
Anti-Civil Service Bformers Win a
Slight Victory.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 1.
The House devoted most of the ses
sion to-day to the District of Columbia
-'-priation bill, but had not com
pleted it at the time of adjournment.
Some politics were ejected into the de
bate just at the close, the feature of
which was a bitter denunciation of W.
AA. Stone of Pennsylvania by Mahany
â¼fR.) of New York for the former's po
sition in favor of the immigration bill.
Stone did not see fit to reply. Before
the District bill was taken up several
bills and resolutions of minor import
ance were passed.
The Military Academy appropriation bill
was reported to the House to-day.
The anti-civil service reformers won a
Plight victory wnen Perkins (R.) of lowa
â nted a resolution for printing the
hearings before the Civil Service Com
mit!'---. Grosvenor antagonized the reso
lution. He said the hearings had taken
an ex parte turn, and hf desired to sub
mit some facts In refutation of certain
statements before they were printed.
Perkins, however, refused to withdraw
the- resolution until the House, by a vote
6* 55 to 90, had refused the previous ques
tion. He then yielded.
A bill was passed authorizing: the Sec- '
retary of the Treasury to build or pur- :
chase a suitable vessel for the revenue
cutter service on the Yukon River, to coat
not exceeding $40,000.
A resolution was adopted which re
quested the Secretary of War to submit
to the House tne report of G. McD.
Townsend of the Corps of Engineers, â 
dated Peeember 33, 1897, concerning cer- !
tain proposed improvements of St. Joseph
and Benton harbors, Mich.
Mahany (fe:) of New York presented in
open House the protest of 10,000 German-
American voters against the Lodge im
migration bill. He made an impassioned
speech against the intolerance of those j
who desired to close the gates to immi
gration, and wben.W. A. Stone (Rj of
Pennsylvania interrupted him he turned
upon the Perins.ylvan.lan and denounced
him as one who desired to precipitate
a race question; as one who ha<i attacked
the Irish, the Germans, the Poles and
every- othr-r nationality.
"I commend you," he shouted, "to the
voters of Pennsylvania as one whose
Americanism cannot stand the test."
m- "Is the sergeant-at-armp present?" was
r the <>n)y comment of Stone when Mahanv
concluded. â¢â  , . . i

Will Continue to Do Business, If Pos

Expires. . : .'
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELEB, Feb. I.â The people
of this city are thoroughly Imbued with
1 the idea that the fifty-two stockholders j
}of the water company have not . the.
; slightest intention, of going put of busl
ness when their lease of. the present
' plant expires on July 22 next. This be
lief is founded up-n experience in deal
ing with the corporation in the past,
and upon certain facts which tend to
prove beyond any reasonable doubt
that the officers and directors are not
making the slightest preparation to go
out uf business at the expiration of i
their contract. On the other hand the
water company is making every prepa
ration to continue in business,
For instance, the water company,
! through its president, W. H. Perry, is
n.>w dickering with the Fulton Engi
neering Works for a pump to replace
the machinery it now has at its Ely
sian Park Station. The new pump is
to have a capacity of 6,000.000 gallons
in twenty-four hoursâ just three times
; the capacity of the present plant at
Elysian Park.
The company is also going ahead
with numerous other improvements to
the city's plant, none of which is
being made in good faith or for a good '
purpose, but merely to stick the muni
cipality and to impede the transfer of ,
1 the plant to the city. It was to estop
moves of this kind that Councilman ;
Hutchison, at the request of the mass- 'â 
, meeting held Saturday evening, intro
.duced a resolution in the Council last
night, which the representatives
of the city government then present
permitted to die without a second. If |
. Councilman Hutchison's resolution had !
been adopted the water company would
have been legally notified not to make
any save absolutely necessary im- :
provem^nts to the city's plant between
now and the expiration of the lease.
Then the corporation would be pre- â 
verited from making additions in the
interim which %vould interfere and not
accord with the general plan for the
improved municipal plant which it is ;
designed this city shall have.
The stockholders of the water com- \
pany are figuring on obtaining an ex
tension 0-f their lease. They have not i
entered into negotiations to turn the
plant back to the city in good faith,
nor with the intention of doing any
thing of the kind.
In their designs the great point is to
keep the people in the dark as to what
their plans are and also as to how ;
they are to be consummated. They
are receiving the same support from
men in public office that they have in
the past, and if, through the aid of a;
syndicated press the people can be led
to believe that everything possible is
being done for municipal ownership
when really nothing is being done, then
half the fight ts won for the water ;
monopoly. The syndicated dailies â the'
Times, Herald and Expressâ are doing j
well the work of the corporation, and!
so are the majority of the City Council
men.
But the people of this city have al- ,
ready had one lesson taught them
which they should profit by. In 1893.
the city had an option to purchase the i
Hooker-Pomeroy land at the mouth of ',
the Tehunga River, about 435 acres, for |
a head works site for $30,000. The deal i
was all but consummated and it would j
have been the initial step for a muni- ;
clpal water system. Daniel Innes, a j
member of the City Council at the time, ]
tells the story of how the deal was j
blocked by the water company and its j
tools.
"We had discussed the matter thor- |
oughly among all the members," said
Mr. Innes to-day, "and it was agreed i
I that we should pay the $30,000, and!
then we would have had the finest I
headworks site it would have been pos- i
sible to obtain for the city's water |
plant. The money had all been obtained i
and was in the city treasury. On Mon- !
day, June 5, 1893, Acting City Attorney]
William E. Dunn came in and told us I
that the money could be voted by reso
lution to take up the option which ex
pired on June 7. The resolution was
accordingly presented and received six
votes, Councilmen F. G. Teed and John
T. Gaffey alone voting nay. It was
carrFed, and we supposed that the
transaction was closed. Councilman
PeÃsell, a strong supporter of the reso
â  lution and of the proposition, desired
I to go East to the World's Fair, and as
we supposed the transaction was set
tled. v.c gave him leave of absence. He
departed, but he had no sooner got
out of the State than Acting City At
orney Dunn came in and informed us
i that it would require an ordinance to
; vote the money. He knew that we were
then short the vote of Councilman Peg
pell, which was required to give an or
dinance voting money the necessary
two-thirds vote.
"It was a trick, and it worked. A
meeting of the Council was called to
pass the ordinance so that we could
; take up the option, an we had been
notified that it would not be renewed.
The ordinance failed by one vote. The
scheme had been successfully carried
out and this city's purchase of a head
works site wan defeated."
Councilman Nickells, who had been I
absent when the vote was taken on
the resolution appropriating the
money, was present when the vote was I
taken on the ordinance appropriating
the money. It was his vote against the
ordinance that carried the nefarious
job to a consummation, and he Is the \
present chairman of the committee on
water supply. Litigation that has ex
tended over five years and that is not !
yet ended would have been avoided ii
Nickells had voted right on that June
day in 1893. and the present City At
torney, Will E. Dunn, can never con
vince many people that his position
was above criticism. When questioned
to-day JUr. Dunn declared that he
acted in good faith.

The Displays of Mineral Wealth the
Great Attractions at the
Exposition.
The Mining Fair and Klondike Ex
position is now in full swing, and the
great Mechanics' Pavilion, where it is
being held, is crowded daily. The ex
hibits are proving to be far more at
! tractive than it was expected they
i would. Particularly is it so of the
! mineral displays from the mining coun
ties. Crowds linger about them all day
and then go away without seeing all
that there is to be seen.
The miniature placer mine was put in
operation yesterday for the first time,
and it was a great attraction to the
visitors. Two giants sent four-inch
streams of water against a gravel bank
and all the features of placer mining
j were fully demonstrated.
The performing bears were the spe
cial attractions during the afternoon,
and in the evening six stalwart miners
\ and mountaineers gave an exhibition of
; how supplies are carried over the hills.
j They were each given a hundred-pound
pack, and a course of about 2500 feet
was arranged along the aisles of the
j building with several trips up and
i down stairs, and they were given a
race. "Klondike" Kelly was first over
the course and he won the first prize,
j J. T. Kewish was second with Wil
! Ham Jones third. The others who en
tered for the race were William Down
ing, James Reed, Edward Engel, Harry
Howard and George Wilson. The end
of the course took them to the Klon
dike kitchen of the second floor, and
there an Alaska miner's dinner was
ready for them. It was cooked by Miss
Edna Davles, a graduate of Mrs.
Rorer's cooking school of Philadelphia.
Miss Davies has for months been ex
perimenting with suitable foods for
Klondikers. The meal commenced
with evaporated pea soup. It was
made frn a kettle over a camp fire.
Beans cooked In the Mexican style
was the second course. While the
miners were eating the soup and beans
the cook made Indian bannock. The
dough was mixed in a tin can before
the fire and then put in the frying pan
to bake. When it was only partially
done the cook needed the frying pan
to cook the bacon. She took the half
cooked bannock and propped the loaf
close to the flames and there completed
its cooking. About the time it was
ready for the table the bacon was
fried and the red-shirted miners made
a hearty meal.
The food before it was put in an edible
shape by the cook did not weigh more
than one pound, yet it made a hearty
meal for the six men, and each one of
them had a good appetite. The Klon
dike cooking kitchen has become one of
the most attractive exhibits to pros
pective Alaskan gold seekers.
It was intended to have a whipsaw
ing contest last night, but the logs that
the miners would cut into boards did
not arrive, and the feature was post
poned until some night next week.
The Klondike wedding that was an
nounced to take place on Friday even
ing has been postponed until Tuesday
night of next week. When the pros
pective bride was told that Friday
night had been selected for the cere
mony she protested.

Mamie Gilmore, the pretty and petite
leading lady of the 'Girl From Paris"
Company, who has for the past few
weeks thrilled the male members of her
audiences by the luscious kissing that
she indulges In during the play, will
soon change her name and the stage is
to lose one of its brightest soubrettes.
The happy man on whom Miss Gil
more has bestowed her affections is
said to be Dr. Francis W. McNamara,
the City and County Physician for Chi
cago. The engagement has a spice of
romance attached to it. Through over
study Miss Gilmore became seriously ill
while the company In which she ap
pears was in Milwaukee. She was
hurried on to Chicago, where the best
of care could be given her. Her sick
ness became serious and Dr. McNamara
was called in to attend her. His visits
became frequent and within a short
time their natural affinity ripened into
love.
Miss Gilmore was seen last evening
and coyly answered that it was true
that she was engaged, but denied that
it was to the man of medicine. When
asked for a photograph of her fiance
she stated that she never carried one
as his features were Imprinted on her
memory. Miss Gilmore expects to join
her intended in New York at the end
of her present engagement, which will
be some time in June. After her mar
riage she will appear no more before
the footlingts.
According to the same rumor it is
said that Miss Gilmore contemplates
appearing in some of A. M. Palmer's
successes and will receive backing from
some prominent Chicago men. Her
idea is to make enough before her
marriage so as to permit her mother to
live in ease for the rest of her days.
It is also said that her sister Effie,
who made such a success in the "Gay
New York" Company, will soon become
the wife of Otis Harlan. the clever de
lineator, the principal character in
Hoyt's "A Black Sheep."

The executive committee of the Golden

noon to close up the accounts of the cele

In consequence of the great amount of

Kowalsky Lost.
Judgment was entered in Justice Cook's

suit brought by Mrs. Mary Madden of
Amador County. The plaintiff's house
hold goods were lost in a railroad wreck,
and she retained Attorney Kowalsky to
obtain damages. A compromise was ef
fected with the railroad company, and
Mrs. Madden claims that her attorney re
tained the money paid. Attorney Kowal
sky placed a receipt for $100, purporting
to have been, signed by Mrs. Madden, in
evidence, but the court evidently thought
the plaintiff's contention that the signa
ture was not genuine was good and gave
judgment accordingly. The attorney was
granted a five days' stay of proceedings
in which to arrange for an appeal.

CATARRH OF THE STOMACH.
A Pleasant Simple, but Safe Effectual
Cure for It.
Catarrh of the stomach has long
been considered the next thing to in-
curable.
The usaul symptoms are a full or
bloating sensation after eating, accom-
panied sometimes with sour or watery
risings, a formation of gases, causing
pressure on the heart and lungs and
difficult breathing; headache, fickle ap-
petite, nervousness and a general
played out, languid feeling.
There is often a foul taste in the
mouth, coated tongue, and if the in-
terior of the stomach could be seen it
would show a slimy, inflamed condi-
tion.
The cure for this common and ob-
stinate trouble is found In a treatment
which causes the food to be readily,
thoroughly digested before it has time
to ferment and irritate the delicate
mucous surfaces of the stomach.
According to Dr. Harlanson the
safest and best treatment is to use af-
ter each meal a tablet, composed of
Disatasf, Aseptic Pepsin, a little Nux,
Golden. Seal and fruit acids. . .
These tablets can now be found at
all drugstores under the name of Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets, and, not
being a patent medicine, can be used
with perfect safety and assurance that
healthy appetite and thorough diges-
tion will follow their regular use after
meals. *
Mr. N. J. Boober of 2710 Dearborn
street, Chicago, 111., writes: "Catarrh
is a local condition resulting from a
neglected cold in the head, whereby
the lining membrane of the nose be-
comes inflamed and the poisonous dis-
charge therefrom, passing backward
into the throat, reaches the stomach,
thus producing catarrh of the stomach;
Medical authorities prescribed for me
for three years for catarrh of stomach
without cure, but to-day I am the hap-
piest of men after using only one box
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. I can-
not find appropriate words to express
my good feeling.
I have found flesh, appetite and sound
rest from their use.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is the
safest preparation, as well as the
simplest and most convenient remedy
for any form of indigestion, catarrh
of stomach, biliousness, sour stomach,
heartburn and bloating after meals.
Send for little book, mailed free, on
stomach troubles, by addressing Stu-
art Co., Marshall, Mich. The tablets
can be found at drugstores.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NETW TORK STOCK MARKET.
XF.W TORK. Feb. Iâ The stock market to
day had a load of liquidation to carry still
heavier than yesterday and there were fewer
prominent stocks to exercise sustaining; force
by tholr strength. The heavy offerings were
weli absorbed and net declines are for the
most part confined to fractions, but are gen
eral. For a time after the opening there
seemed to be no diminution from yesterday's
activity. There had been apparently a large
accumulation of outside orders over night and
London wan also a buyer of stock. This de
mand was satisfied, however, without effecting
any marked advance In prices, the offering:* be
ing very large. Later prices began to yield
under the weight of continued offerings, but
the pressure was not great and the market
fell Into dullness, holders , apparently being
content to await a rally to continue the liqui
dation. ; The rallies were helped by the con
tinuing strength of a number of stocks, es
pecially Union Pacific and all its securities.
The strength of these was held during the day
and Union Pacific closed at the highest at a
net advance of over a point. Western Union
and General Electric showed periods or
strength, but the order of the day was profit
taking and this tendency extended even to
Northern Pacific preferred, upon which there
was a quarterly dividend of 1 per cent declared j
late In the day. . London bought some stocks |
early In this â¢ market, but sold them later,
which probably had an . influence in giving a
somewhat higher tone to the market. It is to
be noted, however, that a part of the cash
from the interior which is being received in
New York is due to remittances on account of
Australian gold received at San Francisco to
the order of New York houses. The rates
for call loans worked to a lower basis â¢In
spite of the withdrawal of thÂ» second 10 per
cent installment of the Government's deposits
of the Union Pacific payment. This with
drawal was called ' for to-morrow, but . most
of it was made to-day.
In the bond market the Kansas Pacific con
sols were the most conspicuous feature with
an advance of B<fc per cent to 118. Other bonds
of the Kansas Pacific advanced 1 to 3 points
on the belief that they would be Included in
the Union Pacific reorganization with or with
out arrangement with the Government. Th
bond market generally showed a continuance
of activity and prices continued to advance
Total sales. $6,140,000.

:: NEW. YORK. Feb. I.â The total of the bank
clearings at leading cities for January, as re

immense volume of business- representing com
mercial,-financial and speculative transactions
passing through the banks during the open

seventy-seven cities of the United States, a
few Eastern cities being estimated, owing -to

feature of- the month. , At New York an in

. CHICAGO, Feb. I.â The opening ,in wheat
furnished a : genuine surprise to traders. Â. It
was generally believed that following the
heavy liquidation of last week and the closing
out f of long lines by many of the more promi
nent bulls the market was in a period
of reaction, some traders even predicting : 90c
for May again. News from â  Liverpool, how
ever, . completely upset these calculations ar.fl
caused a general scurrying of shorts for cover.
Liverpool opened %@l%d lower, responding
well to yesterday's decline, but by 2:30 p. m.
showed a complete reversal of form, prices at
I that time being %@%d over yesterday's prices.
I The sensation of the day's news was the de
| crease for January of 1,248,000 bushels In the
I stocks at Liverpool. Stocks there now amount
to 1.521,000 bushels, or only two weeks sup-
I plies. This was what . started the buying
| furor. The market was further strengthened
I by New York advices of good foreign buying of
i wheat futures. May shot up to 96% c before
stopping. Then it slowly declined. No real
! weakness developed, however, until ' Brad
j street's world's visible 1 report was posted,
showing an Increase of 66,000 bushels. Liver
! pool closed *i(fjHd higher, but Continental
! cables were rather weak, and Bradntreet's and
I that turned the market in the last hour. May
fell to 95% c. but closed steady at 95%Â©96 c.
There was a fair trade in corn at a narrow
i range of prices. May closed unchanged.
In oats the market was steady. ! May closed
I a shade higher.
The market for provisions was weak, the
packers selling. At the close May pork was
10c lower and May lard and ribs 5c lower. .
! The leading futures ranged as follows:

DRIED FRUIT MARKET.
NEW YORK. Feb. I.â The Journal of Com
\ merce says: While there has been no quotable
change In spot market prices for Currants, It
â  is reported that sellers who have been holding
I out for prices above peneral spot quotations
have been constrained by continued lack of
I demand to reduce their pretensions, and In
i fact thÂ«-re seems to be more pressure to sell
j than has been noted for a week or two past.
\ Buyers, however, show little interest, prices
' even at inside figures seeming to be consid
i erahly above their views. Spot stocks are
] said to be moderate, with the bulk In a few
i hands, and the quantity on the way Is reported
fi be comparatively smnll. Cable advices as
, to the stock left In Greece vary, some claim
ing that tt is not over 12,000 tons, while others
state that It amounts to 16,000 tons. Either
j figure, it Is claimed, represents a comparatively
; small quantity for requirements of the trade
! of the world until the new crop is available
next fall. It Is also said that the not Incon
siderable quantity of stock left in the primary
market Is of Inferior quality, and In view of
j the experience of buyers here with shipments
; made early In the season American Importers
i at least would be very careful In purchasing
further supplies until convinced that the stock
is of good quality.

over : : the action of the student body j
yesterday requesting . President Kel- I

bitterly j denounced by a number '' of i

.requesting President Kellogg to recon
stitute the committee openly displayed
.their aversion to a fair hearing and made,
their ignominious assault under coyer of
.the righteous : principle that students
should conduct their own athletic affairs.
That refusal to submit the resolution to

THE MARSHES
SEEK DIVORCE
Sequel to the Hasty Wed
ding of Miss
Snyder.
Left Her Husband the Same
Day They Were
United.
There Is Not Likely to Be Any Con
test to the Suit Just
Brought.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Feb. 1
Divorce proceedings were filed to-day
by Lillian A. Marsh against her hus
band, F. Marsh. This Is the outcome
of a secret marriage that occurred
some months ago and which was kept
secret until the beginning of this year.
Mrs. Marsh was formerly Miss Lil
lian Snyder, and having met a fash
ionable young fellow who was well
known in gambling circles, although
his connections were unknown to her,
they went to San Francisco after a
short acquaintance and were married
by Judge Bahrs. The same afternoon
Mrs. Marsh returned to the home of
her brother in East Oakland, and since
that time she has never met her hus
band. She was greatly surprised to
discover his reputation, and deter
mined at once to be free from him as
soon as possible.
Special Treasury Agent Harris of San
Francisco was appealed to for evidence
regarding Marsh's transactions that
would substantiate a suit for divorce,
and he had no difficulty in providing
ample material to satisfy Mrs. Marsh's
attorneys.
It is not known at present where
Marsh is, but a few weeks ago Agent
Harris said he could produce him at
short notice. There is no probability,
however, that there will be any contest
to the rait.
Defense Will Be Outlined To-Day.
OAKLAND, Feb. I.â The prosecution in
the case of W. A. Knowles, charged with

Martin, a regent of the State University,
Edward W. Davis, the secretary of the
Board of Regents, and Louis Greenbaum,
a clerk of Regent Louis Slohs, the treas
urer of the board, were on the stand to
day. Most of the time was occupied In
arguments over the admlssibillty of cer
tain records.
Ex-Judge Frick made vigorous objec
tion to the introduction of some evidence,
but the court permitted it to go in. From

of the State's witnesses, It would appear
that the defense would be largely based
on technicalities.

SMALL PANIC IN A THEATER.
Bursting of a Gas Bag Causes Fire
and Alarm in Thomas Hall.
OAKLAND, Feb. I.â The bursting of
one of the bags of gas connected with a
stereopticon apparatus caused a fire and
a small panic at Thomas Hall in East
Oakland to-night. No one was hurt, and
the damage to the stage was slight, but
for a time the prospect was good for a
lively blaze, and the confusion among the
crowd threatened to lead to serious con-
sequences.
A lecture with views was being given,
and toward the close the accident oc
curred. There was a loud report, followed
by a blaze, and the audience at once be
came excited. Thomas Hall will hold
about 5-X> people, and It was well filled.
As soon as they recovered from the
shock of the explosion the audience
moved toward the doors, and for a few
moments it looked as though there might
be a serious accident.
An alarm of fire was turned In, and the
ringing of the bells, added to the excite
ment, created a belief that the danger
was greater than it was in reality. The
lecturer and some assistants proceeded to
fight the fire, nnd had about succeeded
when the chemical engine arrived. The
damage to the apparatus will not be
heavy.
THE OMAHA EXPOSITION.
Steps Taken by Local Business Men \
to Have the State Properly
Represented.
The committee appointed from the !
State Board of Trade, Manufacturers' '
and Producers' Association, Chamber of |
Commerce, Merchants' Association, San |
Francisco Board of Trade, Miners' Asso- j
ciation and kindred organizations met
yesterday afternoon to discuss the rep- I
resentatlon of the State at the Omaha j
Exposition, but nothing definite was ac
complished.
A communication was read from the
managers of the exposition, giving the
State 10W) square feet of space to present ;
a mineral exhibit and a concession on
all additional space required at the rate
of 75 cents a square foot of ground floor ;
occupied.
The matter of the cost of giving a min
eral exhibit in conjunction with a display
of the products of the several counties of
the State was discussed at length, and
it was the opinion of those present that
a display as contemplated could not be
made for less than $20,000, and that on 1
consideration that there would not be any
charge for transportation of the goods
either way.
After discussing the matter for two '
hours, It was decided to empower the
chairman, A. A. Watkins, to appoint a
committee of three to ask the Supervis
ors to make an appropriation; to ascer
tain the amount of space required and, If
possible, give a Joint exhibition with the
county of Los Angeles, which will be
represented at th* 1 exposition, and defin
itely learn from ;he railroad officials on'
what terms the exhibits may be taken to
Omaha and back again after the fair.
Chairman Watkins appointed Mayor i
Phelan, J. W. Kerr and John T. Bell a j
committee to promote the affair and so
licit outside assistance.

esters, swore to a complaint In Judge
Conlan's court yesterday for the arrest 1
of Charles Wetzell, financial secretary of:

ment. , â¢ .
"Wetzell has been financial secretary
for the past six years." said Chief
Ranger Ward, "and we had so much faith
in him that we did not require him to â 
give security. We now find that for the .
last two years he has been collecting
dues from members and appropriating the
money. We have asked him to bring his
books to the lodge meetings, but he re
fused. He has : deposited no money with
the treasurer since October 4, and we
have the books of from twenty to twen- :
ty-live members from whom he collected
dues since then. .He would go to the
membersV houses at all hours of the day '
or night to collect dues from them The
total may reach $400 or $500, but we can't i
tell until we get possession of his books " j

The Recorder Comes
In for Some More
Charges.
The Accused Proceeds to
Open Vigorous Fire
in Return.
Copyists Alleged to Be Assessed
for Nearly Everything
on Earth.
STARTLING DISCLOSURES.
Two Versions of Why a Phaeton
Was Not Boughtâ Glynn Says
"Blackmail."
Now comes J. G. Maloney again In
response to the answers made to the
charges he has filed against Recorder
Glynn, and after denying the fact that
any of them are tenable, proceeds to
stir up the pool of trouble worse than
ever by making a few additional
charges, some of them of a drastic na
ture.
"I had not intended to say anything
f.urther in this matter," he stated yes
terday, "but am forced to do so by the
way in which the former charges have
been met. I know well that all the
odds are against me, and that every
device will be resorted to in order to
place me in a false light."
After explaining that he was in no
wise ungrateful for what Glynn had
done for him and the alleged fact that
he did not discover his double deal
ing until long after this letter referred"
to by the Recorder, he proceeded, in
substance, to make the following
charges:
First, that in 1595 the Recorder gave
all the co^pylsts what was called fund
work In order to raise money to ex
pend in his re-election, and that when
it was ruled that the Recorder would
hold over for two years in common
â with others the only explanation forth
coming of where the money went was
that it was used in fighting the case
before the Supreme Court.
Secondly, that in the same year it
was decided to make the Recorder a
present of a phaeton, harness,, and
other accessories, and that he (Ma
loney) was one of those who took a
paper round among the copyists get
ting subscriptions of $10; that Mr.
Glynn was supposed to know nothing
of this, but when it was learned that
he had gone to Studebaker's and picked
out one worth $250, objection was made
and Mr. Glynn was presented with a
music box costing $100.
Thirdly, that in 1897 twenty copyists
put in $6 each for one month, and
something for the second month, and
the deputies also contributed money
toward the boulevard and carnival
fund, but the carnival was dropped
and only the sum of $100 -was given to
the boulevard fund.
Fourthly, that all the copyists were
assessed for a charity rund, but that no
money was ever drawn out of this
fund, and when the solicitors for char
itable undertakings came round they
had to go to the men and ask them to
contribute personally.
Fifthly, that four others, in addition
to Maloney, were permitted to "square"
themselves by having additional
work given them in the month of Jan
uary.
Sixthly, that at his (Maloney's) so
licitation and on account of his politi
cal power a friend named Piercy Hen
derson was placed in the office Â«s u-.i>
uty at a salary of $150 a month, but
that Glynn complained that Hender
son was paying a Mr, O'Connor $25- a
month for getting him the place, trou
ble resulting that ultimately ended in
Henderson being "fired."
Seventhly, that the copyists were
permitted to use certain print books
in which the names of the corporations
for whom they were printed were
erased and others substituted, a dan
gerous practice according to Maloney
and one that will not stand in law.
In addition, there were other charges
of a minor nature.
Mr. Glynn was very angry yesterday
when he heard that Maloney had pre
ferred additional charges. He said:
"This looks to me like a case of
blackmail. This man is acting like
the ungrateful ingrate that he is, and
will not dare to take oath to any of
his statements. In the first place, he
has never been in a position to know
the least thing of what he has been
talking about. Any man who has been
before the Grand Jury and caught in
a lie like Maloney has ought to go
slow."
The charges preferred by Maloney
against Glynn were then given the Re
corder in question form and he an
swered them severally as follows:
"I did not levy any assessment for
election expenses. The boys held a
meeting nnd assessed themselves for
the primaries. I know no more of it
than that Maloney was given some of
Ihe money to ppend and that nobody
know whether he did It or not.
"I didn't tell him or anybody elsÂ©
that it cost anything to fight my case
before the Supreme Court. That is
as black a lie as any he has told.
"I went to Ptudebaker's when I heard
the boys proposed to fret me a phaeton
and when I learned that, it would cost
$non I positively refused to have them
get it. Then they wanted to give it
to my wife and I would not stand for
that either. Maloney was the very
man that started the thing. I let the
boys get me a music box for a Christ
mns present because it was much
chfaper.
"Not one copyist was aware that we
were going to give anything to the
boulevard fund and when the office
contributed the sum of $100 they were
all surprised.
"Money was paid out of the charity
fund for many things and principally
charged to 'cash.' Maloney knows this.
"Only one other man besides him was
ever permitted to 'square himself by
getting extra work. Maloney was
worse in the hole than any.
"Henderson was not discharged for
the reason that Maloney states. I be
lieved Henderson when he told me he
was giving no money to O'Connor. Ma
loney was the man to blame for the
discharge.
"As regards the print books, we did
erase certain names. It was perfectly
regular. For instance, the German
Bank has mortgage blanks that the
California Title Insurance and Trust
Company used to use when it gave
mortgages and assigned them to the
German Bank. They would use the
bank prints and erase the name with
red ink, substituting their own. We
would take them to volume 1138, an
old German form, and make a record in
the same way by using the German
Bank prints and erasing the name and .
making substitution in the same way,
thus making a true topy of the origi
nal. This will stand any law on earth,
"I want to say here that after I
helped Maloney out of his fix his wife
came to me crying and had not seen
him for some time and had been, given
no money. I gave her a warrant -on
the broker for $40 and sent him word
that In future he. must cash warrants
for the wife only.
"Maloney also said in : his former
charges that the trouble between him
and myself was owinjr to the fact that
he would not support Dimond's cahdi-.
dacy as against Pheian's for Mayor.
Yet four months after the fight, for the
Mayoralty was over he sent roe the
letter saying he was: so glad I was a
friend and asking, fop assistance. This
is not all I know about him by half
and I shall make him sorry he ever
dared to try to defame me In this rhan-^
ner." .. \ .-. â  â  â '' :.

to a Jammed Audience at

Metropolitan Temple /was so crowded
last night that admission was refused to
the late-comers to Rev. D. J. Mahony's
i lecture; on "Christian Socialism." Two
burly policemen guarded the entrance
and :as' early as half-past 8 the building
held as many as could safely. ; be In it;
Those; however, who were; lucky enough
to gain admission had a. treat, for a more
delightful, more humorous or more phil
osophic speaker San Francisco has not;
heard for some time. ....- â 
Father Mahohejv -S. : : $.;. showed
thorough knowledge of his .subject, and
strove to show the people, that socialism
as generally accepted : was not logical.
However, there were parts, he said, which
he agreed with; for instance.: the great
injustice of the wages paid irien, for he
claimed that no man should receive less
than would keep a wife and two children.
He went on to say that many would an
swer that all men were not married: but
he replies that all men are not married,
but nature has provided that they should
be, and they are liable to be at any time,
and they should have this salary in ad
vance.
The programme for the evening was as j
follows: : ;

The story of Mrs. Mass* swindling op
eratons, which was published exclusive
ly in yesterday's Call, brought several
people to Judge Conlan's court yester
day, who admitted they had been her
victims. Among them was A. J. Wilkin
son of the Mills building. He was for
merly in the furniture business and h*
attributes his failure to the loss of thÂ«
$700 which Mrs. Mass, who was then
known as Mrs. Sophie Mendel, secured
by false representations. He said he
would willingly testify against her. and
he was told to go and see Attorney Ross,
who is prosecuting Martin's case.

Among the indictments returned by the
United States Grand Jury yesterday were>
three which were placed on the secret
file. One of these three is understood to
be against ex-Collector Welburn.
Special Agent Thrasher, who has been
at work on the matter for several
months past, said that he did not know
that the Grand Jury had brought in an
indictment against Mr. Welburn. Where
was Mr. Welburn now? Well, ho hadn't
the slightest idea. Did he think that any
one else had been indicted with Mr. Wel
burn? Didn't think, and didn't know,
and couldn't say.
His assistant. Bert Thomas, was equally
uncommunicative. He did not know
where the ex-Collector was, and hadn't
the slightePt idea of his whereabouts.

BUCK MASSIE
AGAIN DEFEATED
Ostler Joe Downed the
Eastern Crack With
Ease.
Briar Sweet, a Speedy One,
Beaten Out by Mont
gomery.
Old Roche Led Out by Montgomery.
Five Choices Fell by the
Wayside.
The victory of Fleur de Lts over
Buck Massle some days ago was not
such a wonderful one after all. On that
occasion the Maxim mare downed the j
Eastern crack without effort. Yester- '
day the black horse Ostler Joe showed i
a clean pair of heels to both Buck |
Massie and Libertine, which duo were J
the only contenders in the mile purse
event. The winner was favorite in the j
betting and won eased up to a walk. |
It was a bad day for favorites, Mont
gomery being the only winning choice, t
Willie Martin carried off the riding,
honors by piloting two winners. j
Fourteen maidens, all suffering from :
a lack of class, started in the opening I
six-furlong run, and long odds were;
laid against all of them. The winner â 
turned up in Ed Purser's Mus.cularlo,
ridden by O'Donnell, which, coupled
with Approbation, went to the post at r
odds of 6 to 1. In front nparly the |
whole distance, the gelding beat NHhau
a head in 1:18%. Aprona, the favorite, |
was unplaced. ... â¢â¢: . ;â [
Briar SwÂ»t was carded as a warm I
one in the five- furlong sprint, but '.
Montgomery disposed of his chances
in handy fashion. The latter went to i
the post equal choice with Caesarian. !
and in a mild drive led Briar Sweet '
out a neck in . lrOl I*.1 *. Caesarian hiing â¢â â 
on gamely, finishing a close third.
Old Roche came out in the third ;
event, a six-furlong sprint, after ;a-;; a-;
long retirement, and was made the me- !
dium of a big plunge. Opening up at !
4 to 1, he was pounded down to eVens ;
and 9 to 10 quicker than it takes time to ;
tell. He was a bit too heavy headfd â 
for little Clawpon, and in a drive was
beaten a nose on the wire by Bow a.nd
Arrow, ;. a 5 to 1 chance weil-ridden ; by
Gray. With a stronger boy up he could j
hardly have lost. ;S 1 â  ; : ',
A quintet of bad ones started in the
mile run, decided under selling coridi- â¢
tions, with the. Burns. &.Waterhouse'
entry, Mistleton, a 9 to li} favorite, go
ing to the post. Dr. Bernays, played
down from 6tol to 9, t0 2, led througH- â¢
out, winning easily from The E>ipper. '
The favorite struggled in third. 'â â -â  ''' '.â '"â ': i
Fashion Plate was favorite for the
mile and a furlong run, but the "syn
dicate" strung their -cbecks. qu ' rhe
chances of Can't Dance, the. Corrifan
entry, and he won handily. "Emperor"
Martin rode him on his last disastrous '
essay, as well as en yesterday's gam- ;
boU but he was a better horse j^ester-:
day and won with something to spare
from the first, choice, j Leria was a
good third. \? ':.â =': : â  .' â

SHOT FIVE
TIMES AT
HIS WIFE
John Lynn Declares
He Acted Under ;
God's Orders.
Because of His Cruelty
His Wife Had Left
Him.
- :
Without Any Warning the
Crazy Husband Blazed
Away,
HE NOW FEIGNS INSANITY
A Suspicion That His Duties in
Asylums Unhinged His \.
. : Mind.
Mrs. John W. Lynn was shot yester
day by her husband at the home of W.
J. Roth oil Seventh street, Oakland.
The woul-be murderer emptied a five
chambered revolver at his wife, every
bullet entering her body, and it is very
doubtful if she can recover. The as
sassin declares the Lord ordered him to
commit the deed. } :
Whether Lynn is insane or not is a
matter that is now puzzling the police
officials. His actions of late have given
rise to the suspicion that his mind has
been unbalanced during his many years
of companionship with lunatics as a
keeper in the I'tica Asylum at New
York, and for the past few months at
Agnews. . : .: '/'â  .;' j:
The Lynns were married in New
York about ten years ago, and after
five years of married life trouble arose.
Gradually Lynn commenced to act in a
peculiar manner, and at times was very
cruel. This method of treating his wife
became more marked with succeeding
3-ears, and in 1594 Mrs. Lynn was com
pelled to leave her husband. She
brought with her their little boy, now
8 years of age, and lived with her sister
and her husband, the Roths, in this
city. Last May Lynn followed his wife
to the coast. He had frequently be
sought her to return to him, but she
steadfastly refused. On his arrival in
California he obtained employment
at Agnews as a keeper of the insane,
bringing with him good references for
eleven years of similar service at Utica.
Last Saturday night Roth says he
had a long conversation with Lynn,
and the latter left the impression that
he Intended to commit suicide. "He
asked me to make his wife promise,"
said Roth "that if anything hap
pened to him she would take care

of the boy Harold, and always treat
him kindly, I thought after the con
versation that he was thinking of tak
ing his life. We also talked in a gen
eral way about religion, although he
was not at all religious and belonged
|to no churchy He wa*. however, well
; behaved, with the exception of his
stinginess and cruelty toward my sis
i ter-in-law. He mentioned the fact that
1 he had a couple of hundred dollars, and
suggested that he get himself a pistol,
; but I never saw him with one and do
[not know where he procured the pistol
[which he used to-day."
Monday night Lynn and Roth occu
: pied the same room. Roth got up and
â  had his breakfast, which was prepared
; by Mrs. Roth, as Mrs, Lynn was sick.
After Roth had gone but Lynn ap
peared and made a plea to his wife to
go and livei with him again. She de
clined to do so. and while she was tidy
i ing up her bedroom he went into the
\ apartment with a gun and quickly fired
five shots at her. They hit her neck,
her shoulder blades, the right ribs, left
i hip and one passed through the abdo
[ men. All but one have been extracted,
| and Unless it has pierced the lung the
i woman may live.
After the doctors had attended to
[Mrs. Lynn, police officers were sum
moned and arrested the murderer, who
i was calmly, sitting on : the side of the
â  bed' in the room where he had shot his
| wife. He kept repeating the state
j ment that the Lord had commanded
; him to shoot his wife, and did every
i thing possible to convince the officers
that he is a lunatic. When taken to the
,; City Prison he was visited by Health
Officer Dunn; and the doctor's opinion
is that Lynn was shamming insanity.
It is said that it Is not a difficult mat
ter for a mah so familiar with the ac
j tjpns of insane people to imitate them
j sufficiently to deceive even a doctor.

tention was to take her dying state
ment, but the patient was under the
influence of opiates and not in a condi
tion to make a statement that would
be accepted as evidence.
As soon as the arrest was made yes
terday and before Lynn was taken
to jail. Detective Holland took him be
fore his wife and she said, "That is
my husband, and he is the man who
shot me." In his cell in the after
noon Lynn tried to commit suicide.
He climbed up on the bars, put the gas
jet in his mouth, and turned on the gas.
His actions were seen by a trusty and
he was quickly taken down none the
worse for his mouthful of gas. Pre
cautions were then taken to prevent
him from making another attempt.
Mrs. Lynn was very low last night,
but the doctors have not given up hop<Â»
of her recovery.

Specifications Which Will

Allegations That the Present System
Retards the Growth of the
City.
One of the most Important matters
that have as yet been handled by the
Association of Improvement Clubs will
be taken up at the regular meeting
that is to be held at B'nal B'rlth Hall
this evening. The association will de
mand important and far-reaching im
provements in the present method of

Officers of the association have been
studying up the present cost of street
lights and the resolutions are based on
their report. The preamble will recite

streets will expire August 1; that the
attention of public officials has been
called to the fact; that the present sys
tem of lighting is inadequate and im
proper; that from $290,000 to $300,000 is
paid annually for street lighting; that
many streets are unlighted, and that
San Francisco is far behind the times
in the matter of public lights.
The resolutions then go on to pro
vide that the associations shall urge
the Supervisors to provide immediate
improvements in the matter of street
lights and that a committee of the or
ganization shall attend not only the

A Veteran Appointed.
"William C. Howard, an old soldier, wan
appointed yesterday to assist P. T. M.
Waite in indexing the Chinese certificates
on file in the office of the Collector of
Internal Revenue. There are 40,000 of the
certificates, issued under the act of Con
gress requiring all Chinese laborers then
within the limits of the United States to
register themselves and to append their
photographs. Chinese may have a dupli
cate, making proof of loss, and these du
plicates are made up from the originals
on file. In the revenue office, the holder
being required to find the original at his
own expense, the search for the same be
ing long and tedious, owing to the fact
that no index has been provided. The
absence of an index has been a fruitful
source of scandal, for persons â customs
brokers and othersâ favorites of the Col
lector, have enjoyed a monopoly of this
work and have charged their Chinese
clients all the way from $5 to $20. The
lndexers have been allowed three months
to complete the work, but this time is
believed to be much too short.
