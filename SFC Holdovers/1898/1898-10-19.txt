PHELAN'S COLONIZATION SCHEME
AND HOW THE "BOSS" WORKED IT
Five Wards in Which No Man Was Found
Good Enough to Associate With the
"Hefting" Mayor.
Bartlett, Byington, Gutte, Deasy and
Murphy Left Their Homes to
Live a Lie for Politics.
\ STERNBERG'S CRIME
! The crime for which
he was convicted was
; the procuring of resi
! dents of the city who
were legal voters
thereof to register in a
Senatorial districtoth
er than that of their
residence, it not being
charged that they vot
ed more than once.
James D. Phelan, Mayor of San Fran
cisco, denounced the State Executive for
commuting the sentence of Louis St ember s,
who was sent to the State prison for coloniz
ing voters, and said that tJte offender should
be punished with imprisonment for life
without power of pardon. James D. Phelan
induced Lewis de F. Bartlett of 607 Post
street to change his residence and register
from jfll Sansome street, Isadore Gutte to
change from 217 Lcavenworth street and
register from the Occidental Hotel, Lewis F.
Byington to change from IJ/,12 Post street
and register from the northeast corner of
First and Harrison streets, Eugene P.
Murphy to change from 130 Â£ Guerrero street
and register from 536 Third street, Jere
miah Deasy to clian^e from 812 Fulton
street and register- from 2Â£ Sixth street. He
denounced the crime of Sternberg and laughs
at his own act.
When confronted with the charge of
colonizing residents of San Francisco
for election purposes James D. Phelan
laughed.
When the sentence of Louis Stern- j
berg for colonizing voters was com- j
muted Phelan denounced it and said
the offender should be sent to the
State's prison for life.
For Sternberg to colonize voters is an
unpardonable crime. For Phelan to
colonize voters is a laughing matter.
This is the status of the man who is
asking the votes of the citizens of San
Francisco to elect him to the office of
Mayor on the Democratic ticket and
who is posing as the exponent of purity
In politics.
The Call yesterday morning: told the
story of how Eugene P. Murphy was
Induced to change his residence and
how Murphy refused to live a He for
political advancement. Murphy was
not the only one who was induced by
the "holier-than-thou" candidate to
change his residence and register from
a ward other than that in which he
lived. Lewis de F. Bartlett, who lived
and still holds a room at 607 Post street,
Â«n the Eighth Ward, was Induced to
change his residence and register from
the Coso House, at 411 Sansome street,
in the Third Ward; Isadore Gutte was
Induced to change his residence from
217 Leavenworth street, in the Eighth
"Ward, where he lived and still holds
a residence, to the Occidental Hotel in
the Fifth Ward; Lewis F. Bylngton
vr&a induced to change his residence
from 1412 Post street, in the Twelfth
Ward, where he lived and where he
Btill has a residence, to the Nob Hill
House, on the northeast corner of First
and Harrison streets in the Seventh
Ward; Jeremiah Deasy was induced to

In commuting the sentence of Louis

In commenting on this James D. Phe

SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1898.
rests on the purity of
the ballot - box. If a
man's vote cannot be
fairly cast and hon
estly counted the Gov
ernment is a fraud,
and the ballot-box, in
stead of being a refuge
from official corrup
tionists, becomes a
trap. I cannot believe
that any sane and
patriotic citizen would
countenance election
frauds. There can be
no higher crime against
the State. It is trea
son, and from the be
ginning every Gov
ernment has punished
treason with death.
Instead of a sentence
of three years an of
fender should be pun
ished with life impris
onment without power
of pardon. A pardon
restores a criminal to
his civil rights; it puts
him back into the cit
adel he treasonably
sought to destroy.
The men mentioned as having
changed their residences and regis
tered from wards other than those in
which they live are all candidates for
the office of Supervisor of the city and
county of Sv a Francisco, all having
been on Phelaii's slate and all having
been nominated at his behest. It was
for the purpose of mnking them eligible
as candidates that thpy were colonized.
In addition to those named the register
shows that Osgood Putnam had moved
from his old residence at 3009 Sacra
mento street, in the Twelfth Ward to
1020 Washington street, in the Fourth
Ward. Mr. Putnam is absent from the
city and his political manager, Sydney
Van Wyck, talked for him.
Mr. Van Wyck confessed that the
colonization of Democratic Supervisor
ial candidates had been done by a pre
arranged plan. As one of the Commit
tee of One JLundred he was oualifled to
speak. He said: "Yes, a good many
of the Supervisorial candidates were
moved from wards in which they had
been living to wards in which it was in
tended to make their fight. There is
Commodore Gutte, for instance, and
Lew Byinrton and the others that you
have mentioned to me. It was sug
gested to them that they move for the
reason that in some of the wards there
were no men who were desirable from
our standpoint, as candidates. Ido not
care to say who suggested this policy.
It was not of the committee, for it was
suggested to them. I want to say that
Mr. Putnam was not one of those who
was colonized. The place that he
moved to, 1020 Washington street, he
was born in, and lived there up to four
years ago when he was married. Last
May his stepmother died, and his
father, who is an old man of 70, asked
his boy to come and live with him in
his later years, and on August 1, before
Mr. Putnam dreamed of running for
Supervisor, he moved there."
Here is the direct admission of one of
the members of the committee which
made the nominate- that a coloniza
tion scheme was suggested to the com
mittee and carried out. Every infer
ence given in this interview is that this
suggestion was made by Mayor Phe
lan, the man who selected the candi
dates.
It is a plain statement that
Phelan could not find a single
man in either the Third, Fifth,
Seventh, Ninth or Tenth
wards who was fit to associ
ate with this "holier than
thou" candidate for Mayor.
The men who were colonized by Louis
Sternberg were not sentenced to State
prison. That punishment was meted out
to the man who procured this violation
of the law. The men who were induced
by Mayor Phelan to change their resi
dences for political purposes are not
the ones who to-day receive the con
demnation; that is reserved for the
man who suggested the scheme.
These candidates who were colonized
by Mayor Phelan were seen yesterday
and the facts of the changes in their
residences investigated. Lewis de F.
Bartlett could not be seen. Inquiry at
his former place of residence, 607 Post
street, elicited the fact fiat he ttlD
had a room there. The landlady of the
house did not know that he had
changed his residence. At the Coso
House it was learned that Bartlett had
a room there also and occasionally oc
cupied it.
While Isadore Gutte is ostensibly a
resident at the Occidental Hotel he can
be found at his residence, the neat lit
tle cottage at 217 Leavenworth street,
almost any time out of business hours.
Commodore Gutte was bubbling over
with good nature when asked about his
multiplicity of residences. He, like
Phelan, laughed. "Yes, I've still got
the Leavenworth street place, although
I've taken rooms at the Occidental," he
said. "I also stay over at Sausalito oc
casionally, so I suppose you might call
that my home, too. I went to the Oc
cidental before I was nominated for
Supervisor, and I don't think you can
make much political capital out of it,"
and the Jolly commodore chuckled at
something, possibly at the same thing
over which Mayor Phelan laughed.
At the Byington home, 1412 Post
street, it was announced that Lewis
Byington lived there; that he came
there every night; that he could be seen
there any evening at 6 o'clock. At the
Nob Hill House, at First and Harrison
streets, the statement was made that
Lewis Byington had a room there; that
he was not there at the time; that it
was difficult to say when he could be
seen there as he only slept there once
a week. Byington himself stated posi
tively that he lived at the Nob Hill
House and that he slept there every
night. Byington did not laugh. Possi
bly the spectacle of one of the swells
of the latter day Nob Hill occupying
a little back room in a cheap lodging
house in the precincts of the old Nob
Hill away down near the docks and
surrounded by decaying residences of
old-time swells was not as pleasant to
him as to Phelan. "Of course," he said,
"I don't eat there," and the look of dis
gust as he said it told the story more
eloquently than words. As to his change
of residence he had what, to him, was
a full and adequate defense. It was
legalâ he is a lawyer and ought to
know. He was indignant that his pri
vate affairs should be made subject of
a newspaper investigation and thought
that it wou.u be better to look into the
character of candidates rather than
into their places of residence, appar
ently forgetting that committing elec
tion frauds belongs to the character of
the man. He attributed the publica
tion of this matter to what he was
pleased to term "the usual mendacity
of reporters."
Jeremiah Deasy, with hia brother,
has a shoe store at 20 Sixth street. His
family resides at 834 Fulton street,
where they have lived for several years.
Mr. Deasy is essentially a home man,
who cares more for the pleasures and
comforts of his fireside than for all the
political emoluments a grateful con
stituency could bestow, yet Mr. Deasy,
at the "suggestion" of Mayor Phelan,
has taken lodgings at 24 Sixth street.
He has not entirely forsaken his family
residence, however, for he takes his
meals with his family and it is but na
tural that he should now and then ac
cept of their invitation to stay all
night, leaving room 11 In the Sixth
street lodging-house vacant for the
nonce. Mr. Deasy frankly admitted
that he had changed his residence for
the sole purpose of becoming eligible as
a candidate from the Tenth Ward, and
said that after the Bth of November,
whether he was elected or not, he would
return to his Fulton street home.
"I took up my residence on Sixth
street," said Mr. Deasy, "at the sug
gestion of my lawyers, and on their as
surance that it was perfectly legal and
proper. I undoubtedly shall return to
my Fulton-street home after the elec
tion. I don't see that there is anything
wrong about that. I formerly lived in
the Tenth Ward, and I know 800 men
in that ward to every one I know In
the Twelfth."
Mayor Phelan's ideas on the subject
of colonization of citizens for political
purposes have undergone a change since
he so emphatically denounced the com
mutation of the sentence of Louis
Sternberg. Then it was a crime â no
less a crime than treason â and should
be punished by imprisonment for life
without the power of pardon. Now it is
a laughing matter, and should be done
in the interests of "purity in politics."
"It has been known all along that
candidates for places on the Board of
Supervisors had moved into their wards
in which they intended to run in order
to qualify themselves for election," said
Mr. Phelan last evening when asked to
explain his ideas on the subject of such
colonization. "When the committee on
nominations for Supervisors made its
report to the convention there was a
statement included which informed the
convention that where suitable men
could not be found In a ward others
had been asked to qualify themselves
by establishing a residence In the ward
from which they were nominated. They
had time to do that and they did so.
"The idea was that at the last Legis
lature a law was gassed abolishing the
wards of San Francisco, but this lav/
is considered by many to be unconsti
tutional because it is special legislation
for San Francisco. To avoid any com
plication therefore it was deemed ad
visable to have the candidates who did
not live in the wards for which they
were nominated establish a residence
there at once.
"I was not consulted on this matter,
but had they consulted me I certainly
would have advised the course taken.
I would have done it myself had I been
in their position."
Here Is a plain statement from the
man who poses as the purifier of poli
tics that he would have advised candi
dates to colonize and to live a lie, and
that he would have colonized himself
had he been in their place. And his es
pecial Subsidized organ, the Bulle
tin, announced that "Mayor Phelan
laughed" when he read in The Call that
he was charged with inducing citizens
to change their residences for political
purposes.
Of course he laughed. It was his own
Joke. And when Phelan laughs it is in
cumbent upon his Subsidized Bulletin to
laugh. Not exactly a "horse laugh,"
but one from another kind of animal of
the equine species. Something in the
nature of a bray. This combination of
Phelan's laugh and the Subsidized Bul
letin's bray rings badly in the ears of
the voters who will be the ones to de
cide the question of who shall look after
the affairs of the city after November
8. The laugh and the bray are not in
harmony with the fierce denunciation of
the deed of Sternberg, and the people
are wondering that desire for office on
the part of one man and greed for more
subsidizing on the part of a paper
should so change the ideas of right and
wrong in the short space of a year.
And you voters of the Third, Fifth,
Seventh, Ninth and Tenth Wards who
have had your affiliations with the
Democratic party, what do you think of
this silk hat boss who says that in all
your wards there is not one man who
is fit to associate with him?
How do you like it that this "hefting"
Mayor goes into the hallowed precincts
of swelldom and gets men to live a lie
in your wards in order that he may
have men around him who belong to ths
aristocracy?
Is it possible that there Is not a Dem
ocrat in the Third, Fifth, Seventh.
Ninth and Tenth wards who is fit to

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 18.â The United States has been
formally placed in sovereign possession of the island of
Porto Rico. The War Department has received the fol
lowing dispatch:
"SAN JUAN, Porto Rico, Oct. 18.â Secretary of War,
Washington: Our flags have been raise*d on the public
buildings and forts in this city and saluted with national
salutes. The occupation of the island is now complete.
"BROOKE."
A copy of General Brooke's dispatch was sent to the
President at Chicago immediately upon its receipt.
SAN JUAN DE PORTO RICO, Oct. i
18.â Promptly at noon to-day the Amer
ican flag was raised over San Juan.
The ceremony was quiet and dignified,
unmarred by disorder of any kind.
The Eleventh Regiment Infantry,
with two batteries of the Fifth Artil
lery, landed this morning. The latter
proceeded to the forts, while the in
fantry lined up on the docks. It was
a hot day for San Juan, and there were
many people in the streets. Rear Ad
miral Schley and General Gordon, ac
companied by their staffs, proceeded to
the palace in carriages. The Eleventh
Infantry Regiment and band, with
Troop H of the Sixth United States
Cavalry, then marched through the
streets and formed in the square oppo
site the palace.
At 11:40 a. m. General Brooke, Ad
miral Schley and General Gordon, the
United States Evacuation Commission
ers, came out of the palace with many
naval officers and formed on the right
side of the square.
The streets behind the soldiers were
. thronged with townspeople, who stood
waiting in dead silence. At last the
city clock struck the hour of 12, and
the crowds, almost breathless and with
eyes fixed upon the flagpole, watched
for developments. At the sound of the
first gun from Fort Mnrro, Major Dean
and Lieutenant Castle of General
Brooke's staff hoisted the stars and
stripes, while the band played the
"Star Spangled Banner."
All heads were bared and the crowds
cheered. Fort Morro, Fort San Cris
tobal and the United States revenue
cutter Manning, lying in the harbor,
fired twenty-one guns each. Senor
Munox Rivera, who was president of
the recent autonomist council of secre
taries, and other officials of the late in
sular government were present at the
proceedings.
Congratulations and handshaking
among the American officers followed.
Ensign King hoisted the stars and
stripes on the Intendencia, but all other
flags on the various public buildings
were hoisted by military officers. Si
multaneously with the raising of the
flag over the Captain General's palace
many others were hoisted in different
parts of the city.
The work of the United States Evac
uation Commission is now over, and all
the reports will be forwarded to "Wash^
ington on Thursday next. The labors
of both parties have terminated with
honors for all concerned. The Ameri
can Commissioners worked without the
least delay, and in the most thorough
and effective manner.
GENERAL HENRY'S
WORDS OF WISDOM
PONCE, Oct. 18.â To-day's celebra
tions in connection with the formal
surrender of the island of Porto Rico
were, as had been expected, most en
thusiastic. After the parade the bands
and various trade organizations went to
General Henry's headquarters to be in
troduced to him. General Henry, in
the course of a brief speech, said:
"Alcalde and Citizens: To-day the
flagof the United States floats as an em
bletai of undisputed authority over the
island of Porto Rico, giving promise of
protection of life, of liberty, prosperity
and right to worship God in accordance
with the dictates of conscience. The
forty-five States represented by the
stars emblazoned on the blue field of
that flag unite in vouchsafing to you
prosperity and protection as citizens of
the American union.
"Your future destiny rests largely
with yourselves. Rer-^ct the riehts of
each other, do not abuse the Govern
ment which accords opportunities to
the individual for advancement. Po
look after city affairs?
You men of the tabooed wards are not
good enough to associate with the man
who wears a silk hat except when he is
out seeking votes, and who then adorns
himself with a workingman's slouch, but
you are good enough to bow to the dic
tation of this "hefting boss" and vote
for the rulers he has placed over you.
If one of you presume to do a little
colonizing like Sternberg the peniten
tiary for the rest of your natural life is
your portion, but "Hefty" Phelan col
onizes your wards with his satellites,
and then you are expected to throw up
your hats and hurrah for the aris
tocrats and laugh at the Mayor's col
onization.

Board of Supervisors, and he
now denounces them as thieves,

litical animosities must be forgotten in
unity and in the recognition of com
mon interests. I congratulate you all
in beginning public life under
these new auspices, free from govern
mental oppression."
The Alcalde replied in part as fol
lows:
â¢'To-day destiny has written the last
page of Spanish dominion in Porto Rico
and the prologue to the entrance of the
noble American Republic, whose flag is
a sign of a new era. We hope to see
another star symbolic of our prosperity
and our membership of the great repub
lic of States. Porto Rico has not ac
cepted American dominion on account
of force. She came willingly and freely,
hoping, hand in hand with the greatest
<->t all renublics, to advance in civiliza
tion and progress and to become part
of the republic to which we pledge our
faith forever."

American flags.
CITIZENSHIP OF
THE PORTO RICANS
WASHINGTON, Oct. 18.â In view of
the fact that at noon to-day, with the
acquisition of the island of Porto Rico
by the United States, about 800,000 in
habitants of that island lost their
Spanish citizenship, the question as to
what shall become Â»of these people po
litically becomes of importance.
Madrid advices report that leading
citizens in Porto Rico have already ta
ken steps to become naturalized as
United States citizens. This is an er
ror, for existing laws provide no way
in which the change of citizenship can
be effected by the residents of the isl
and. There is no United States Court
there before which a declaration of in
tention can be filed, ' and, in fact, no
machinery at all which can be put in
motion to change citizenship.
Inquiry into this subject at the State
Department discloses the fact that it
has been usual to provide a bodily
transfer of the citizenship of people
conditioned as those in Porto Rico in
the treaty of peace which terminates a
war. It may be prudent for the com
mission at Paris to avoid any reference
to Porto Rico again, in which case
Congress will be called upon by the
President to confer citizenship upon
the Porto Ricans in the same act as
that which must be passed to nrovide a
stable form of government for the isl
and. Should either of these courses
be found impracticable, however, it is
said at the department that interna
tional law in its operation would con
fer American citizenship upon these
Porto Ricans. the general principle be
ing that where a treaty of cession is
silent upon the subject citizenship
changes with the soil. In the case of
the acquisition of New Mexico, the res
idents of the Territory were given
American citizenship by specific provi
sion of the treaty.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
JUNJEAU, Alaska, Oct. 14 (by steam
ship Dirigo to Victoria, B. C, Oct. 18).â
Considerable gold is being brought out
of the new diggings at Lake Atlin by
*he latest outcomers, arriving here and
at Skaguay to spend the winter and
make arrangements to return early in
the spring. An occasional nugget is
exhibited, but they are scarcer than
are found in the Dawson mines. It is
mostly coarse gold from the new dig
gings, clean and bright. L. McKinnon,
one of the first locators near Discov
ery, and Dr. Lovett and Mr. Wheeler
arrived here this morning. McKinnon
made a neat clean-up on a quantity of
provisions he took in by pack train
<over the Taku trail.
A line of small steamboats will be
put on the Taku Inlet run from Juneau
next spring. Enough men are going
In from the coast towns of Alaska to
make a camp of three or four thou
sand people soon after the ice breaks
lip In the rivers, and there will be con
siderable movement of supplies to At-
Un City over the snow this winter. No
-new strikes have been made, but all
reports continue favorable.
The caravan of 180 men with horses,
who struck across the country for At
lin from Teslin City, the Stickeen River
trail and Glenora has not been heard
from or seen since it started out. They
eet out to follow a large valley run
ning across country, in which there was
said to be grass for the horses. Sev
eral parties have arrived out from Lake
-Teslin by way of the Taku trail. They
learned of the departure of the cara
van, but saw nothing of them. The
attempt was a dangerous one with win
ter so close at hand, and it is feared
that the entire expedition will perish.
That will certainly be the result if the
party gets snowed in, as tney were not
burdened with provisions. On account !
of the lack of horse feed they were able
to purchase the horses for as low a
price as $1 each.
A party of eighty Klondikers came
Up the river on the little steamer Clara
and arrived at Skaguay in time to
catch the Dirigo. Some of them re
port an increasing interest in Pine
Creek and Lake Atlin country. A
number left the party when they ar
rived at Lake Marsh and went over to
Atlin by way of Tuku Arm to take a
look at the country. The Klondikers
bring out about $60,000 in dust, and an
unknown amount of checks and drafts.
Most of the party on the Clara are
men who went to Dawson in the rush
last winter and spring, locating noth
ing of value and are returning home
empty handed.
The death rate was sti!l very high
ten days ago. but winter is expected j
to kill the typhoid epidemic soon. Daw
sonites are interested in suppressing
news of the large amount of deaths,
and for this and other reasons it is
probable that the whole number will
never be known.' The steamship Ex.
celsior was towed up here last night
from Valdes and other ports to th% i
westward. She brought down about !
100 Copper River argonauts, who tell |
the same hard luck story of their exÂ»
perience in the Copper River country-*
no gold, except a coior now and then.
This is the last batch of Copper River
gold seekers to come out this season.
About 400 people in all will winter In
the country and next summer go up th&
river and over the divide down into thÂ»
Tanona and White River country. They
are camping at the head and foot of
Klutena Lake, at the hÂ«ad of the can
yon, and a few at Valdea.
Captain Abercrombie of the Govern
ment military expedition has about a
dozen men on his hands at Valdes who
have neither money nor food. He will
send them to Pupet Sound or San Fran
cisco on the first Government vessel.
One of the latest parties to com* j
over the glacier, lost two men in crev- ;
lc>"*s. Their names arÂ» not known. Ons j
man was never heard from after h*
broke through the snow crust and dis
appeared. The other man was heard
calling for help down in the black
chasm. Everything possible was donÂ«
to rescue him with the means at hand, j
A rope with a rock tied to the end was j
lowered, but he could not reach It,
either on account of his position or be
cause it was not long enough. The
cries of the poor fellow in his prison
of Ice became fainter after several
hours. Ho seemed to realize that hÂ»
was beyond help. The party left him
still screaming for rescue.
The man who told me nbout this said
he would remember to his dying day
the cries of the poor fellow, homeward
bound, probably to wife and children,
a? they turned from the brink of thÂ»
chasm and took thf trail again.
The Excelsior sailed for Sltlta and
will take the outside passage for the
Sound.

STEAMER BRIXHAM WRECKED
ON A BLASHE ISLAND REEF
STEAMER BRIXHAM, WRECKED ON BLASHE ISLAND.
SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. 18.â The steamer Brixham is the latest vessel wrecked in the treacherous waters of
the North. She struck on a reef early las? Thursday morning a quarter of a mile off Blashe Island, near
the head of Clarence Strait, and thirty miles south of Wrangel. All the passengers and crew were res
cued. Officers of the steamer Dirigo, just In port from Lynn Canal, report that the Brixham is lying
on the rocks on an even keel, with her bow stove In and her hold full of water. Her cargo Is be
lieved to be destroyed. Hopes are entertained that the steamer can be saved unless southeast gales set in.
Wednesday night, prior to the disaster, was exceptionally dark, and the lowering clouds shut off the
vision of anything save a big black mantle of gloom. The nassengers and those of the crew who were off
watch were below asleep and all unconscious of impending danger, when suddenly a cannbn-like crash aroused
them. The steamer struck the hidden reef and her engines were almost shaken to pieces as they swung her
shaft around in an endeavor to drive her forward, notwithstanding the barrier of jagged rock which cut
deeper into her prow with every revolution of her propeller.
An examination of the steamer was made by the officers and It was found that her hold had filled with
water. The passengers were Immediately put ashore without the slightest accident. A camp was at once
formed. The day after the steamer Al-Kl hove in sight, and in answer to the signals of distress came along
side and at the request of the Brlxham's captain took a number of the wrecked wayfarers into Skaguay.
When the Dirigo was bound down she hove to some distance from the wreck, which then appeared to be
well filled with water and hard and fast on the reef, and a boat put out to her from the camp with a num
ber of the passengers and crew who asked a passage downward for the wrecked men. As, however, the
Dirigo was already crowded to her limit â she had 190 passengers â the request was necessarily without avail.
The reef on which the Brixham lies Is four miles off the regular course to Wrangel.
The Brixham was built in England in 1885. She was wrecked about three years ago on the Atlantic
Coast and was purchased and repaired by American parties and put under the Stars and Stripes. She was
183 feet long, 27:1 feet broad and 14:2 feet deep. She was owned by the Boston- Alaska Transportation Com
pany and came here from Baltimore to go into the Klondike trade. There is $50,000 insurance in Coast offices
on her. Her purchase price was $75,000.
DELAY THE
GAME OF
THE DONS
Want to Tide Over
the Elections.
HOPE FOR EASIER TERMS
"MANANA" POLICY OF SPAIN IS
THE LAST RESORT.
It Is Now Definitely Stated That the
Question of the Disposition of
the Philippines Has Not
Been Taken Up.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 18.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Believing the forthcoming
elections in the United States, and es
pecially in New York, will show the
American people are opposed to the ac
quisition of onatlying territory, and that
President McKiniey will consequently
modify his demands with respect to the
Philippines, the Spanish commissioners
in Paris are exerting all their efforts to
delay action on the various points at
issue until the middle of November.
Information Bent to Washington by
Judge Day, chairman of the American
commission, has convinced the offi
cials that this Is the object of JLhe
"manana" policy now being pursued by
Senor Montero Ricrs and his associates.
Mr. Day lias peremptorily informed the
commissioners that the United States
expects negotiations to be concluded
with the utmost dispatch. It is not
meant by this that progress has not
been made. As a matter of fact the
negotiators have agreed upon several
points, and such action is very encour
aging to the officials here. But Senor
Montero Rios and his colleagues appar
ently do not understand or do not want
to understand that matters settled by
the protocol are not open to discussion.
It can be stated on authority that the
question of control, disposition and gov
ernment of the Philippines has not yet
been taken up by the commission. When
the commiaÃion held its first session the
programme to be adapted for discussion
of various questions was discussed, and
the Spanish commissioners attempted
to ascertain the intentions of the Amer
ican Government with respect to East
ern islands. Upon Judge Day's repre
sentation that it was the desire of the
American commissioners that the first
question to be disposed of should be
relating to the Independence of Cuba
and the cession of Porto Rico an/i Guam
Island to the United States the Spanish
commissioners acquiesced, but have
since been endeavoring to draw out
Judge Day on the subject of the Philip
pines. But Judge Day has been ex
tremely cautious and it is not believed
here that he yesterday informed the
Spanish commissioners that the sur
render of the Philippines would prob
ably "be demanded irrespective of the
Cuban or any other debt.

THE SAN FK AN CISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 19, 183 a.
COMMISSIONS
CANNOT AGREE
Americans and Span
iards Far Apart.
AS TO CUBAN EVACUATION
SO BUTLER AND PARRADO WILL
PRIVATELY CONFER.
However, Uncle Sam's Representa
tives Are Not Yet Ready to
Charge the Dons With
Double Dealing.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, I&SS,' by James Gor
don Bennett.
HAVANA, Oct. 18.â The two commis
sions are to-day as far as ever from an
agreement concerning the date of the
final evacuation of Cuba. Last week the
Spanish Commissioners announced that
it would be impossible to withdraw all
the troops before January 15, which
date It was then believed, would be
agreed upon.
Misunderstandings arose, and now
the commissions are so far apart that
an agreement between them seems un
likely. Colonel Glrauta to-day told me
he thought the 'matter would be re
ferred back to the Governments in
Washington and Madrid.
The Americans will make a final at
tempt to reach an understanding by
arranging an informal conference be
tween General Butler and General Par
rado. These two will meet . with no
one present save two Interpreters, and
many subjects will be discussed with
more freedom than could be permitted
In formal session.
It would seem unfair to charge the
Spaniards with double dealing, and the
Americans place no confidence in. the
reports from Paris that Premier Bn
gasta has ordered General Blanco not
to evacuate Cuba until the Philippine
question is settled. The Americans
point to the complete plan of Cuba's de
fenses placed in' their hands by General
Blanco, as cabled yesterday, as evi
dence of honorable intentions.
More than that the Spanish troops
are evacuating the island as rapidly as
possible considering the ships at their
command. The Americans flrst as
sumed control in Santiago, and since
then evacuation has been going on from
east to west. Havana will be the last
point under Spanish control.
POKER AT LOS ANGELES.
New Ordinance Against the Game Is
Declared Valid.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 18.â The new poker
ordinance, which Mayor Snyder allowed
to become a law without his signature, is
valid, according to a decision made to
day by the Supreme Court.
The question of the validity of the ordi
nance was brought before the â¢ court
through a petition for a writ of habeas
corpus directing Chief of Police Glass to
set at liberty one Wilson who, the peti
tion recited, was being unlawfully re
strained of his freedom under the opera
tion of the new ordinance, which aimed
to suppress the vice of gambling as prac
ticed In so-called club rooms throughout
the- business sections of the city.

CONSTANTINOPLE, Oct. 18.â At 8:30
a. m. the German imperial yacht Ho
henzollern, accompanied by the Ger
man warship Hela and the Sultan's
yacht Izzedin with the Turkish Imperial
Commission on board, and followed by
a number of special steamers chartered
by members of the German colony or
conveying sightseers, appeared off Old
Seraglio- Point, and the guns of the bar
racks thundered, a salute. The Hela fol
lowed with a return salute and the
Turkish b-tteries ashore and tha
guardship off Tophaney promptly re
sponded.
The Hohenzollern anchored at 8:45 a.
m. off Dolmabagtche Palace, with the
Heretha and Helva above and below
her. Soon afterward the Emperor and
Empress entered the Hohenzollern's
longboat and were rowed to the palace
landing station, where they were re
ceived by the Sultan, who was sur
rounded by a brilliant suite.
The meeting between the Sultan and
his guests was most cordial. The Sul
tan warmly shook hands with the Em
peror and Empress and, offering his
arm to the Empress, led the way to a
pavilion off the palace, where the party
had a brief rest.
Emperor 'William engaged in an ani
mated conversation with the Sultan, the
Grand Vizier and other members of the
Sultan's suite.
The route from the Dolmabagtche
Palace to the Tildiz Palace was cov
ered with red carpeting and lined with
troopÃ in new uniforms, prominent
among them being the Sultan's body
guard and the imperial body guard, in
new white uniforms embroidered with
black, white helmet, and having a
waistband of Germany's colors. The
whole made a magnificent display.
Standing: a little apart from the crowd
were large gatherings of Turkish
women who ocupled a slope facing the
Dolmabagtche Palace. In the rush of
the people to secure noints of vantaire
they climbed trees, railings and posts.
The Sultan has presented to Emperor
William a magnificent sword and to the
Empress a diamond necklace of almost
priceless value. He has also authorized
a German syndicate to construct a com
mercial post at Haidar, opposite Con
stantinople, a concession long sought
by German promoters.

PARIS, Oct. 18.â In the Paris edition
of the Herald on Sunday was published
a communication giving the result of
the University of California architect
ural competition held at Antwerp.
Eleven competitors received prizes. The
plans will come up for final judgment
before an international jury which
meets in San Francisco.
Mrs. Hearst is at present In Paris
and the correspondent of the Herald
saw her on Monday In the hope of ob
taining some idea of the scope of the
plans and cost. J. B. Reinstein, regent
of the University of California, who
represented the institution at the Ant
werp competition, presented me to Mrs.
Hearst and explained my errand.
"You really must not ask me about
anything," exclaimed Mrs. Hearst. "I
do not want to talk about the matter.
Mr. Reinstein will tell you everything."
"But Mrs. Hearst," I said, "will you
not give me in a few words an idea
of what you propose to do and an es
timate of the cost?"
"Ask Mr. Reinstein; he will tell you
everything," were Mrs. Hearst's last
words.
"Mrs. Hearst always refuses to be in
terviewed upon what she does or hopes
to do," said Mr. Reinstein. "She is ex
ceedingly reticent in regard to her gift
to the University of California,
"To B. R. .Maybeck, instructor of
architectural drawing, belongs the
credit of originating the scheme. Then
Mrs. Hearst came forward and made it
Eosslble for the idea to be developed,
he has selected as trustees to carry
out her wishes Governor James H.
Budd of California, Professor William
Carey Jones of the faculty and myself.
Mr. Maybeck was granted a year's
leave of absence. He and I visited all
the principal cities of the United States
seeking information rrom the best
known men in educational circles. A
meeting of architects and artists was
held in New York at which tne project
was discussed and at which about two
hundred and fifty gentlemen were pres
ent. Mr. Maybeck then came to Eu
rope, visited all the great seats of
learning in the British empire and on
the Continent. I joined him here and
then we returned to San Francisco and
arrangements were made for the com
petition which has just been held at
Antwerp."
"Will Mrs. Hearst give all the money
needed to carry out the plan?" I asked.
"Oh, no. While Mrs. Hearst is a great
friend of the university there are others
who intend to assist at this work."
"About how much money will be re
quired?"
"It is impossible to state any amount.
I can say that the State of California
has set aside $1,000,000 for the buildings.
Generous friends of the university have
promised the funds necessary to erect
several other buildings and Mrs. Hearst
in addition to Tarnishing the money for
the new buildings for schools of mines
and for the endowment of its faculty
will present the institution with one or
more additional buildings."

Captain Blame Hears Some Pointed
Talk From Secretary of
War Alger.
WASHINGTON. Oct. IS. â Captain
James G. Blame, Assistant Adjutant Gen
eral of Volunteers, was at the
War Department this afternoon and
had a long and animated con
versation with Secretary Alger. Af
ter Captain Elaine's escapade at Ho
nolulu on his way to the Philippines the
War Department cabled him to return
here and make such defense as he might
against discharge from the army. Sec
retary Alger declined to state the nature
of the talk between Captain Blame and
himself, but It Is understood the Secre
tary handled him without gloves. As
young Blame had but a feeble defense to
make of his conduct, both at Honolulu
and Manila, his discharge from the army
is likely to occur soon. It is not proba
ble that he will be court-martialed.
Pensions have been granted as follows:

California Athletic Club's Monthly
Entertainment in Franklin Hall.
The California Athletic and Swimming
Club gave an athletic show last evening
in Franklin Hall. The event of the
evening was an eight-round contest for
the alleged amateur lightweight cham
pionship of the coast (the rules of the j
American Athletic Association of tne
A. A. A. have made boxing professional in I
all events) between Charles Rochette and
Kid O'Brien. Jack Stelzner was selected
to referee the bout, and, being unable to
decide which of the boxers was entitled
to a decision at the end of the eighth
round, he ordered another round. Ro
chette, evidently angerod because Stelzner
did not favor, him with a decision, went
right at his game in hammer-and-tongs |
style, and O'Brien was receiving such a j
heavy bombardment of rights and lefts \
that Sergeant Anderson, anticipating a j
slaughter, stepped into the ring and or
dered the contest stopped, which mandate I
was obeyed. The referee then awarded
the fight to Rochette. *^ V
The preliminaries consisted of . a four
round . bout between Frank Ely and M.
Meyer, which was as uninteresting as
could possibly be, and a six-round con
test between Frank McGinnis and Emll
Dahl. This terminated in the third round
â¢by a knockout, McGinnis being the man
who was hard hit.. .â - Â- , .

AMERICA, SWEET,
BELOVED PEACE!"
Formal Opening of Chicago's Great
Jubilee With Impressive
Ceremonies.
President McKinley, Archbishop Irelarjd and
Others Eloquently Teli of tbe War in
Bebalf of Huroanity.
â¢CHICAGO, Oct. IS.â Five thousand !
people packed within the walls of the
Auditorium witnessed the formal
launching of the peace jubilee to-day.
It required the uncorking of six viala
ot eloquence to make the launching a
distinct success, and no vessel that ever !
slid down the ways was dumped Into
moretdampness than the peace Jubilee.
A heavy drizzle that changed into rain
and then back into drizzle was falling,
the streets were filled with puddles of
water and the cold wind blowing off
Lake Michigan made walking unpleas
ant. Notwithstanding these obstacles
the opening of the jubilee proper was a
distinct and brilliant success.
It was announced that the ceremo
ftiles would commepce at 10:30 a. m.,
and fully an hour prior to that time
the street in front of the Auditorium
;was packed with an enthusiastic crowd.
'After the doors had been thrown open
there was a long wait for the speak
ers. Owing to a misunderstanding, in
â¢which the President had no part, it
was past 11 a. m. before the President
entered the hall. Upon his entrance
he was escorted by the Chicago Hus
ears and mounted police. As the Pres
ident entered the hall his appearance
was the signal for an outburst of en
thusiastic cheers that lasted for several
minutes. With the President were ex-
Governor Richard J. Oglesby of Illi
nois, Lafayette McWilliams, President
Harper of the Chicago University and
Thomas B. Bryan of Chicago. The
party composing Mrs. and Miss Mew 11
fiams and Miss Duncan were in the box
adjoining that of the President In
the first box at the left of the stage
was General Miles, and in the boxes
next to him were the members of the
various diplomatic corps. Secretary
Gage was in a box in the second tier
almost directly opposite to the box of
the President. Almost immediately af
ter the narllamentary party had taken
their seats, the Rev. Frank W. Gunsau
lus, chaplain of the meeting, offered
Chairman Charles Truax, on behalf
of the Jubilee committee, then made a
Bhort opening address and introduced
George R. Peck as presiding officer.
Mr. Peck made a brief address, and
Introduced Mayor Harrison, who deliv
ered the formal address of welcome to
President McKinley and the strangers
who had come to Chicago to witness
the ceremonies of jubilee week. The
President, who received a most enthu
siastic welcome as he entered the
building, made no formal reply to the
addresses of welcome, notwithstanding
loud calls for a speech. Following thf
ad'lrpps of Mayor Harrison, Archbishop
Ireland of St. Paul spoke.
In concluding his address Archbishop
Ireland said:
"Welcome to America, sweet, beloved
peac**; Welcome to America, honored,
elnrinus victory! Oh. peace, thou art
heaven's gift to men! When the Savior of
humanity was horn in Bethlehem, the
sang forth "Glory to God in the
highest, and on earth peace. good will to
men." P-raee was offered to the world
thr-i'iph Christ, and when the spirit of
Christ )s supreme there Is universal peace
âpeace among men, peace among na
tions. ,
O. peace, so precious art thou to hu
manity that our highest ideal of social
felicity must ever be thy sovereignty upon
earth. Pagan statesmanship, speaking
through pagan poetry, exclaims. "The
best of things which it is given to men
to know la peace; better than a thousand
triumphs is th" simple gift of peace.
The regenerated world shall not lift
Bword against sword, neither shall they
be exercised any more In war."
Peace is the moral flow of humanity's
life, the healthy pulsation of humanity's
social organism, the vital condition for
humanity's growth and happiness. Re
duce to the smallest the sacrifice on the
battlefield, one has died and some one
has hppn bereft. "Only one killed." the

TO CURE NERVOUS DYSPEPSIA.
To Gain Flesh, to Sleep Well, to
Know What Appetite and Good
Digestion Mean. Make a
Test of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets.
Interesting Experience of an Indi-
anapolis Gentleman.
No trouble is more common or more
misunderstood than nervous dyspepsia.
People having it think that their nerves
are to blame, are surprised that they
are not cured by nerve medicines and
spring remedies; the real seat of mis-
chief IS lost sight of; the stomach is the
origin to be l<.<>k.-d after.
Nervous dyspeptics often do not have
any pain whatever in the stomach, nor
perhaps any of the usual symptoms of
stomach weakness. Nervous dyspep-
sia shows itself not in the stomach so
much as in nearly every other organ;
In some cases the heart palpitates and
Is irregular; in others the kidneys are
affected; in others the bowels are con-
stipated, with headache; still others
are troubled with loss of flesh and ap-
petite, with the accumulation of gas,
gour risings and heartburn.
Mr. A. W. Sharper of No. 61 Pros-
pect street, Indianapolis, Ind., writes
as follows: "A motive of pure grati-
tude prompts nre to write these few
lines regarding the new and valuable
medicine, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
I have been a sufferer from nervous
dyspepsia for the last four years; have
used various patent medicines and
other remedies without any favorable
result. They sometimes gave tempor-
ary roli.-f until the effects of the medi-
cine wore off. i attributed this to my
sedentary habits, being a bookkeeper
with little physical exercise, but I am
glad to state that the tablets have ov-
ercome all these obstacles, for I liave
gained in flesh, .shop better, and am
better in every way. The above is
written not for notoriety, but is based
on actual facts. Respectfully yours
..c-, r>- J' A - W - SHARPER,
"61 Prospect St., Indianapolis. Ind."
It is safe to say that Stuart's Dys-
pepsia, Tablets will cure any stomach
weakness or disease except cancer of
the stomach. They cure sour stomach,
gas. loss of flesh and appetite, sleep-
lessness, palpitation, heartburn consti-
pation and headaches.

headline reads. The glad news speeds.
The newsboys cry "Killed only one!"
"He was my son! what were a thousand
to this one â my only son?"
It was Wellington who said, "Take my
word for it, if you had seen but one day
of war you would pray to Almighty God
that you misht never see such a thing
again." It was Napoleon who said, "The
sipht of a battletlfld after the fight is
enough to inspire princes with a love of
peace and a horror of war."
War, be thou gone from my soul's
sight! I thank the good God that thy
ghastly specter stands no longer upon
the thresholds of the home of my fellow
countrymen in America or of my fellow
beings in distant Andalusia. When, I ask
heaven, shall humanity rise to such
heights of reason and of religion that war
shall be Impossible and stories of battle
fields but the saddening echoes of primi
tive ages of the race?
Yet a Just and necessary war is holy;
the men who at their country"s call en
gugf In such a war are the country's
heroes, to whom must be given unstinted
gratitude and unstinted praise. The sword
in their hands is the emblem of self
sarrince and of valor; the flag which
leads them betokens their country and
bids them pour out in oblation to purest
patriotism the life-blood of their hearts;
the shroud which spreads over the dead
of the battlefield Is the mantle of fame
and of glory-
Judge Emory Speer of Georgia fol
lowed with the closing address. At the j
conclusion of Judge Speer's address, I
which concluded the programme, there I
were loud calls of "McKinley, McKln- j
| ley!" The President had risen and j
was just about to leave the box, but he <
turned and came back to the front. He i
waited for a moment until ex-Governor j
Richard Ogelsby brought the assem- j
blage to something resembling quiet, j
Then the President spoke as follows:
My fellow-citizens: I have been deeply '
moved by this demonsrtation. I have j
been deeply touched by the words of pat- I
rlotlsm that have been uttered by dis- ,'
tinguished gentlemen so eloquently in j
your presence. It is gratifying to all of j
us to know that this has never ceased ]
to be a war of humanity. The last ship >
that went out of the harbor of Havana
before war was declared was an Ameri
can ship that had taken to the suffering
people of Cuba supplies furnished by (
American charity. (Applause.) And the '
first ship to- sail into the harbor of San
tiago was another American ship bearing
food supplies to the suffering Cubans.
(Applause.) And I am sure it is the uni
versal prayer of American citizens that
justice and humanity and civilization
BbaU characterize the final settlement of
peace, as they have distinguished the
progress of the war. (Applause.)
My countrymen, the currents of des
tiny flow through the hearts of the peo
ple. Who will check them, who will
divert them, who will stop them? And
the movements of men, planned and j
designed by the master of men, will j
never be interrupted by the American
people.
During the afternoon five meetings
were held in different parts of the city.
A large meeting at Studebaker Hall
was addressed by Albert J. Beveridge
of Indianapolis and President Cyrus
Northrup of the University of Chicago.
At the Columbia Theater General Miles,
General Henry M. Duffield of Detroit
and Booker T. Washington addressed
an audience limited only by the size
of the theater.
At the First Regiment Armory Secre
tary James Wilson and Mayor David S.
Rose of Milwaukee comprised the list
of speakers. Samuel Gompers spoke at
the Second Regiment Armory and
Charles Emory Smith delivered an ad
dress at North Side Turner Hall. The
public schools, all of which were pro
fusely decorated, devoted the day to
jubilee exercises and to hearing ad
dresses by prominent educators and or
ators.
GRAND BALL TO AID
SOLDIERS AND SAILORS
CHICAGO, Oct. 18.â Four thousand
-eople danced at the Auditorium to
night for the benefit of the suffering
sailors and soldiers, and it was a per
fect success. A small festoon of Ameri
can beauty roses hu.i? before the box
from which President McKinley viewed
the ball, and directly opposite a similar
decoration was Placed beneath the box
in which the Chinese and Korean Min
isters were seated. The hour for the
reception of the President and the dis
tinguished guests was 10:30 p. m. The
hall was draped with red, white and
blue strips across the entire roof.
Punctual to the minute the President
appeared. Chairman Truax and the
jubilee committee were also present.
Mayor Harrison wai on his left. The
orchestra rendered "The Star Spangled
Banner," and all in the hall remained
standing as the Presidential party
made its way across the floor.
The ceremony of presenting being
over the President made his way to the
box reserved for him, the audience ap
plauding enthusiastically. He left the
hall after midnight, going to the resi
dence of Captain Williams. About $25 -
000 was realized for the benefit of the
soldiers and sailors.
Professor Cox of the Signal Service
Bureau to-day had little in the way of
cheering prognostications for the next
thirty-six hours to offer Chicagoaris,
who have been hoping for fair weather
to-morrow, the day of the big parade
He said there would be "unsettled
weather, with rain, Wednesday."
PRESIDENT M'KINLEY
MEETS THE MIDDIES
CHICAGO, Oct. 18.â About 11:30 the
President left the Auditorium and was
driven to the hall of the Illinois Naval
Reserves, in the Medinah Temple,
where several naval reserves all in
uniform had gathered. As the Presi
dent, arm and arm with Mayor Harri
son, and accompanied by Captain Mc-
Calla of the Marblehead, Admiral
Brown, Commodore Ide, Captain W. J.
Wilson, Lieutenant J. A. Ãbdell and
Ensigns W. D. Flood and D. R. Col
lins, came on to the floor of the hall
they were greeted with hearty and pro
longed cheering. For ten minutes the
middies filed past the PresWent, shak
ing his hand. Then taking a position
at the end of the hall he addressed the
blue Jackets briefly. While the cheer
ing still continued the President ex
cused himself and departed. He was
driven at once to the McWllliams resi
dence on Lake avenue and retired soon
after.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1898.
MAJOR TILDEN
HAS RETURNED
Tells of Affairs at
Manila.
INSURGENTS NOT DANGEROUS
THEY WOULD HAVE NO CHANCE
AGAINST AMERICANS.
The California Officer Praises the
Bravery of the Call's Special
Correspondent During the
Fighting.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C. Ov-t. 18.â On board
the steamer Empress of Japan, which
arrived this afternoon from the Orient,
was Major Tilden of the First Califor
nia Volunteers and Dr. Lewis of the
Red Cross Society, two well-known
San Franciscans who are on their way
home from Manila on leave.
Major Tilden says things are still In
statu quo at Manila, in fact they have
changed but little since the armistice
was declared. As for the fears of
trouble between the Americans and the
Philippine insurgents, he thinks that
there is scarcely any need for uneasi
ness on that score, for although the in
surgents might have done well with
the backing of the Americans against
the Spanish, they would not last longer
than an iceberg at the equator In a
conflict with the Americans.
A large number of Callfornlans, some
sick and some wounded, are en route
home, the major says, on the hospital
ship Rio de Janeiro, which left Hong
kong several days before the Empress.
He speaks in glowing terms of Sol
N. Sheridan, The Call's correspondent,
whom he met for the first time under
fire in the rebel trenches, where, not
withstanding the danger, the brave cor
respondent had gone in search of re
liable news for his paper.
The Empress of Japan brings a bud
get of Manila news. There was con
siderable excitement there prior to the
departure of the last mail for Hong
kong over the reported sale of Palawan
and part of the Sulu group to Germany
by Spain. The story of the sale was,
however, afterward denied by the Ger
man Consul, but still many of the Ori
ental papers refused to take his denial,
and many lengthy editorials appeared

NARROW ESCAPE OF HER SON
PARTOOK OF BOTH MTTSH AND
CANNED OYSTERS.
Mush Made of Refuse Meal by the
Old Lady, Whose Son Had
Bought It for Chicken
Feed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESIw, Oct. 18.â An old lady, Mrs.
Resilla Russell, died at her home on
Harvey avenue, Belmont Addition, this ;
evening from the effects of eating
poisoned food. It is not known whether
her death was due to the eating of
tainted oysters or poisonous mush. It
is quite evident, however, that her
death was paused by partaking of ;
either the oysters or the mush, as she
became deathly sick shortly after
breakfast and an invalid son of the old
lady was similarly affected, but in his
case the illness was of a milder form.
Last night one of her sons brought
home from a restaurant some canned
oysters. The can had been opened and
a quantity of the contents used. The j
son thought, that the remainder would j
be nice for his aged mother. It is quite
likely that the oysters became tainted
on account of their exposure to the air.
It might have been the mush, however,
that was the death-dealing food, as one
of the sons had bought the meal, which
was refuse stuff, for chicken food. He
did not intend that it should have been
cooked, but he placed it where his
mother saw it and as she was near
sighted she made mush of it, which she
and the son who was taken sick ate.
She died several hours afterward.

GAGE GREETED
WITH GREAT
ENTHUSIASM
Sacramentans More Than Ea^er
to Listen to the Republican
Leader.
Discussed the Gubernatorial Nominee of the
Parties of Confusion and Exposed His
Treacherous Record.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 18.â Henry T.
Gage, Republican nominee for Gover
nor, arrived in the capital city of Cali
fornia at 3 o'clock this afternoon. He
came from the mountain counties of
Calaveras and Amador, where the
meetings surpassed all previous politi
cal demonstrations in that region.
The enthusiasm for the Republican i
standard bearer was not confined to the !
meetings, but was exhibited by the j
people as Mr. Gage journeyed through j
the Sacramento Valley to-day.
Among the miners in the mountains, i
as among the farmers and fruit grow
ers of the San Joaquin Valley, he
gained outspoken supporters by reason
of his manly and unassuming manner i
In meeting and talking with the peo- j
pie. Mr. Gage is the kind of a man
that the masses respect. They recog
nize in him a man of the people, dif- j
ferent from the office-holding aristo
crats who have grown sleek and fat at
the public treasury.
The tour of the Sacramento Valley
opens under the most favorable aus
pices. In expectation of the coming
of the standard bearer the Republican
organization made ready to receive j
him, but no one anticipated that the
reception would take the form of a
great popular uprising, such as was ex- j
hibited in Sacramento to-night.
A committee of leading Republicans ;
went down the road to Gait and there j
met the standard bearer on his return j
from the mountains. Immediately on j
his arrival at Sacramento he was es- !
corted to the Golden Eagle Hotel. An
informal reception lasting two hours, !
from 3 o'clock until 5, was held at the \
hoteL Seven or eight hundred citi- i
zens of the capital city clasped the i
hand of the man of the people.
So many came that Mr. Gage barely
had time to exchange a word with each
comer. Before dark delegations began j
to arrive in Sacramento from Folsom, i
Gait, Davisville and other places. It j
became apparent to the committee that \
the pavilion on Sixth street would not !
hold or begin to hold the vast multl- j
tude that was beginning to assemble j
to cheer the Republican standard- j
bearer and listen to the eloquence of i
the matchless orator, General W. H. L. j
Barnes.
Among the Republican organizations j
that participated in the procession
which escorted Gage and Barnes to the j
pavilion were: State Capital McKinley j
Club, W. G. Govan, president; Army j
and Navy Republican League, Colonel j
George M. Mott, commander; Resolute
Club, Major W. H. Sherburn and Harry i
Rogers, president and vice president; I
Club of Ninety-Eight, F. F. Tebbets,
president; First Ward Club, W r . A. An- j
derson, president; Second Ward Club,
George Staacks; Third Ward Club,
William Hall; Fourth Ward Club, Wil
liam Avery; Fifth W r ard Club; Sixth
Ward Club, James Henderson; Seventh
Ward Club, W. D. Knight; Eighth
Ward Club, Thomas James; Ninth
Ward Club. J. H. Dolan; Oak Park
Club, L. S. Gertner; Gait Republican
Club, F. H. Harvey, president; Folsom
Republican Club, Captain Murphy;
Central Republican Club, Sacramento,
F. R. Dray.
The procession was handled by
George H. Clark, grand marshal.
The marching clubs in line. steDDine !
to the music of brass bands and drum
corps and saluted by the cheers of
thousands and thousands of spectators ;
who lined the street on either side of
the route, inspired the Republicans of
the capital. Rockets, red fire, banners I
and transparencies were features of I
the great demonstration. While count
less hundreds were viewing the parade J
those who knew a thing or two about i
the limited capacity of the old pavilion
went there early and secured seats.
When the head of the column reached
Sixth and M streets every chair in the
house was occupied and standing room
was at a premium. Later thousands
sought to gain admission, but they
were turned away. "An overflow meet
ing on Sixth street, near the pavilion,
was large and enthusiastic. It is esti
mated that 5000 people assembled on
the street near the pavilion entrance.
The vast assemblage in the pavilion
was called to order by A. J. Bruner.
chairman of the Republican County
Central Committee. He named as pres
ident of the occasion Captain W. H.
Stamens, commander of the Army and
Navy Republican League of California,
under the auspices of which the meet-
Ing was called. Mr. Bruner read the
followin- list of vice presidents:

Charles BaJne,
Captain W. H. Seamans, commander
of the Army and Navy Republican
League, spoke as follows:
Mr. chairman, comrades, ladies and
gentlemen: By the courtesy of the Coun
ty Central Committee, this meeting is
held under the auspices of the Army and
Navy Republican League. It is for this
reason, I suppose, that the chairman of
the committee has invited me, as the
head of the State League, to preside and
introduce the speakers of the evening.
The organization is a political one and
numbers more than 5000 active working
members in the State of California, and I
may say, fairly represents more than
nine-tenths of the 15,000 Union Veterans
In the State, who, with their family con
nections, will cast 20,000 votes at the com
ing election and place our friend Henry
T. Gage in the gubernatorial chair.
I am not expected to make a speech on
this occasion, and I shall not attempt It,
but I desire to say a word to my com
rades, many of whom 1 see in the audl-
Comrades, did it ever occur to you,
while fighting the battles of your coun
try upon land and upon sea, while in the
Bilent watches of the night froiy your
midnight bivouac you were thinking 1 of
home and friends, while suffering in nos
pitals or starving in Libby and Ander
sonville, that you would ever find an
American citizen so lost to all patriotic
sentiment and grateful remembrance aa
to assail your citizenship, apply to the
courts to disfranchise you and place you
upon the plane of paupers because by
virtuÂ© of wounds and disease incurred in
the service of your country, or from the <
infirmities of age, you might feel con- j
strained to accept the home provided for |
you by a beneficent government, where i
you might spend the remnant of your I
days in peace and comfort.
Huwever incredible it may appear to
you such a man has been found within
the limits of our own State, in a Demo- j
cratic leader who lives in Los Angeles !
County, where he has brought an action j
in the courts, which is now pending, to
disfranchise the Inmates of the National
Home at Santa Monica. Why? Because a
majority of our comrades there are Re
publicans and vote the Republican ticket.
Tiiis Democratic statesman aspires to
represent you in the upper house of Con
gress as the successor of the Hon. Stephen I
M. White should, by any possibility, I
the Democratic ticket be successful- at |
the coming election. Do you want him to
succeed?
My fellow-citizens, who are these men
that this Democratic leader would thus
rob of their citizenship; a right dear to
the heart of every old soldier? "They are
those who fought with Grant in the West;
who rode with Sheridan in the valley;
who marched with Sherman to the sea;
who were with Farragut, the invincible,
when he took his fleet of wooden ships
through that cyclone of shot and shell at
New Orleans, past the frowning batteries
of Vicksburg and Fort Hudson and into
the harbor of Mobile, teaching a lesson
in naval warfare which has enabled the
gallant Dewey, his lieutenant, to anni
hilate the Spanish fleet before Manila;
and Sampson, Schley, Clark of tho
Oregon, and fighting Bob Evans to sweep,
as with a West India hurricane. Cervera
and his ships from the face of the Carib
bean Bea.
They are thase who were at Gettys
burg, Petersburg, Chickamauga, Chan
cellorsville, Antietam, Shiloh and
Cold Harbor on that memorable
day in June, 1864, when 10,000 went
down in twenty minutes, and many
of them were participants in a hundred
other battles. These were no skirmishes,
but battles royal, in twelve of which 188,
000 men were lost to the Union arms.
This was war, grim-visaged- war, in which
350,000 of our comrades laid down their
lives and twice as many more were
maimed for life to the end that the na
tion might live.
Now, comrades, in these piping times
of peace, for the Spanish war is practi
cally over, you have duties to perform as
citizens only less important than those
rendered by you as soldiers of the repu
llc. and if you do your duty to your com
rades and to yourselves now as well as
you did it then you will relegate, this
Democratic statesman to private life and
save the State of California to the Re
publican party by your votes, on thft Bth
day of November, 1898, as you saved the
nation by your bayonets at Appomattox
on the 9th day of April, 1865. Will you do
it?
In closing, Captain Seamens intro
duced Henry T. Gage. The audience
responded with tremendous shouts of
applause and prolonged demonstrations
of welcome. When the tumult subsided
the standard bearer thanked the people
of Sacramento for the magnificent re
ception. He said he did not take the
greeting as personal, but regarded it as
an exhibition of the devotion of the
people to Republican principles.
There was an unmistakable design on
the part of persons in the pavilion, near
the entrance, to embarrass Mr. Gage
with noise and talking. Chairman Sea
mens, observing the interruptions, said
a few words to the audience, asking
that the privilege of talking be granted
exclusively to the regularly appointed
speakers.
Mr. Gage, after dwelling upon the
prospects of a great victory at the polls
on the Bth of November, proceeded to
v discussion of single tax problems. The
points against Maguire's pet scheme
were made in a style that challenged
the attention of his hearers and called
forth rounds of applause.
In a forcible manner Mr. Gage re
pelled Maguire's assault on the In
tegrity of the Republican State conven
tion.
The railroad settlement question was
considered and the Congressional Rec
ord produced to sustain the assertion
that Maguire did not object to the set
tlement at the time when objection
would have defeated the measure. Mr.
Gage did not ask the people to take his
word for this declaration, but invited
particular attention to the debate in
Congress. The points in this regard
were presented here in Sacramento as
they were in Los Angeles, San Diego,
Fresno, Stockton and other cities. Mr.
Gage dwelt -with special emphasis on
the fact that Senators Morgan and
White, recognized Democratic leaders,
scanned the measure carefully and sug
gested an amendment to give it greater
strength, and that the amendment so
perfected received the unanimous sup
port of every Republican, Democrat and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1898.
Populist in the United States Senate.
Here, as elsewhere, the people listened
with profound attention to the story of
Maguire's double-dealing on the rail
road question.
In closing his masterly address the
standard-bearer talked in the plainest
fashion to the audience. He assured
the people that he would give them a
fearless, economic and clean adminis
tration. The assemblage applauded the
sentiments expressed in the promise.
The Sacramento Athletic Club Quar
tet entertained the audience and re
sponded to an encore. .
General W. H. L. Barnes was greeted
in a most cordial and enthusiastic man
ner by the vast audience.
After paying his respects to Judge
Maguire in a fashion that evoked peals
of laughter at the expense of the office
holding giant, allusion was made to
Maguire's refusal to discuss the money
question or the platforms which he
straddled; it was said that he simply
shouted railroad and sat on the fence
howling at the cars and making faces
at the conductor.
Maguire crankism engaged the atten
tion of the eloquent exponent of true
Republicanism, and the danger was in
dicated of electin- to high office of
Governor one who entertained sym
pathy and admiration for anarchists.
The beautiful word painting, the elo
quent tributes to American institutions,
and the noble flights of oratory which
distinguished the efforts of the speaker
in his recent Southern California tour
were features of his splendid speech at
the pavilion to-night. He inspired the
audience to a high degree of enthusi
asm. He closed with a superb perora
tion on the love of country, and won
mighty rounds of applause.
The meeting inside adjourned with
great cheers for Gage and xsefr ana w.
H. L. Barnes. ,
The outdoor meeting was addressed
by local talent. In every respect the
demonstration to-night far surpassed
the fusion gathering at the pavilion last
Saturday night. Not more than three
thousand people assembled to hear Ma
guire and Hutchlnson. It is estimated
than ten thousand people sought to
hear Gage and Barnes to-night, lhat
number assembled at Sixth and M
streets, hoping to gain admission to the
pavilion. The success of the demon
stration has inspired Republicans with
renewed confidence and zeal.
Gage and Barnes go to Auburn to
morrow. ________ââ
BIG DEMONSTRATION BY
POMONA REPUBLICANS
Largest Assemblage in the History
of the City Listens to Elo
quent Speakers.
POMONA. Oct. IS.-No political meeting
in Pomona Valley has ever compared with
that held here this evening by the Gage
and Neff Republican Club of Pomona. It
was the biggest and most enthusiastic
assemblage ever grouped in this locality.
Henry T. Gage has been known intimately
by hundreds of Pomona citizens for near
ly a quarter of a century, and no candi
date for political office was ever so uni
versally and thoroughly popular in Po
mona Valley as he. It has therefore been
an easy task to get up a mammoth meet-
Ing here for him and the whole Republi-
When the special train from Pasadena
bearing the famous Republican marchinff
club, the Americus, rolled Into Pomona
station, there was a roar ot saluting
cannon and cheers by the multitude.
From sunset till after 7 o'clock people
came into Pomona city by every rural
road and every sort of vehicle. The bu.si-
I ness streets were packed when the parade
! of the Americus Club and local Republi-
I cans clubs took place. As the white unt
! formed company proceeded down the
I streets a storm of hand clapping by the
jostling throngs of spectators accompan
ied the marchers.
Because the Pomona Opera House was too
small to hoid oven a fraction of the multl
! tude of people who had come to attend
i the meeting a large circus tent had been
hired, and when Chairman Albert Dolo
rose to call the meeting to order the tent
was jammed and packed with men and
women. So large an audience had never
before been seen here. Hundreds of men j
could not get ntarer than twenty foet of
the large tent and went home.
Russell J. Waters, Republican candidate
for Congress in the Sixth District, spoke
i half an hour on the issues in his canvass.
i Several times he was so tumultuously
cheered that he had to cease speaking for
a full minute or more. .
Will H. Harris, who has been
a lifelong Democrat and an old
Democratic stump speaker in Southern
California and who now supports the
whole Republican ticket, had such a
demonstration and enthusiastic reception
that he could hardly proceed with his
speech When in an eloquent passage he
referred to the President the multitude
rose and cheered and yelled for several
minutes.

EDITOR BRETZ
FAVORS THE
GAGE TICKET
Best Way to Defeat
the Fusionists,
TEAGUE HAS DRAWN OUT
HAS NO DESIRE TO DEFEAT A
REPUBLICAN.
On Saturday Evening the Alliance
Will Swell the Procession at
the San Jose Demon
stration.
Oakland Office San Francisc Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 18.
Ex-Assemblyman Bretz, who has al
ways been a stalwart Populist, swerving
neither to the right nor to the left, has
openly advised his party to transfer their
votes to Henry T. Gage. In his paper.
Industry, he publishes the following sig
nificant editorial:
Before fusion killed the People's Party the
Socialists could find no sayings slanderous
enough to apply to the party. They strove
equally hard with the fusionists and Demo
crats to kill us. Now what will we do, go
to either the fusionists or s-oclalists?
No, no! Long may the Socialists live, but let
us Join the Republicans tn the warfare against
the sinful combine â fusion.
Some Populists say we will now vote the
Socialist ticket. Not this year, boya. A vote
for the Socialist ticket helps the fUÃionists.
Kill fusion this campaign by voting the Re
publican ticket and vote Socialism after fusion
Is dead.
God speed Socialism, but kill fusion first.
So vote the Republican ticket, as bad as you
hate the gold bugs.
Kill fusion, If it is the last act of your life.
There is only one way of doing itâ vote the
Republican ticket.
The Republican Alliance of Oakland will
go to San Jose next Saturday evening to
take part In a big demonstration at that
city. After the parade and meeting there
will be a banquet to the visitors and the
following day an excursion to Santa
Cruz.
Benjamin James of Brooklyn Township
has filed his petition to be placed on the
ballot as the Independent candidate for
ConÃtable.
Mr. Bennett, a Democratic candidate
for the Assembly, has made some state
ments about Assemblyman Howard
Wright Mr. Bennett challenged Mr.
Wright to a debate, but Mr. Wright paid
no attention to it, telling his friends that
Mr Bennett had the same privilege as
he (Wright) had of expressing himself to
the voters, and that the latter were in
telligent enough to make a choice. Re
garding the criticisms of Bennett on the
university revenue bill, the Enquirer says
to-night:
Assemblyman Wright not only introduced the
bill but labored effectively for its passage. He
was indefatigable In getting it approved by
committees and In > smoothing down the objec
tions of members who were disposed to dispute
its passage. He worked as faithfully for the
University bill as an Assemblyman could work
for anything, and It Is a great mistake for My.
Bennett to try. to belittle the candidate against
him, especially in connection with this matter.
Aside from the University bill, Mr. ' Wright
made a record as a faithful member, and one
who was progressive, alert and Independent.
The voters of the Fifty-first District will do the
proper thing If they return Mr. Wright to the
Assembly.
John F. Teague, who was nominated at
the Independent Convention, has written
the following: -; ,. 'â  Â; .' , > Â
Editor Morning Call : i Allow mÂ« through the
columns of your valued Journal to notify the
electors of the Forty-ninth Assembly District
that I have ceased to be and am not' a candi
date for the office of 'member of the Assembly
from said district.
The reasons which move me to this decision
are as followB: I have been for the twenty
three years last past a stanch Republican, and
am Buch now, and If I were a member of the
next Legislature would vote for a Republican
United States Senator. .' . . I
After a careful canvass I am not satisfied
that I can be elected, while, on the other hand,
my candidacy might have the effect of defeat-
Ing the Republican candidate, A. A. McKeon,
and of electing a fusion candidate.
i I am bo thoroughly imbued v. th the prin
ciples of the Republican party and am such an
ardent admirer of Its record and policy, and of
Its great standard-bearer, William McKlnley,
that I will not by any ambition o* my own.
make It possible . for one to be elected who
would not firmly support his '. policy and that
of the ReDUbllcan Darty. â .

ADVERTISEMENTS.
ManiWPower
Restored by Prof. Jules Laborde's Marvelous
French Preparation of Calthos.
FULL 6-DAYS TREATMENT FREE
BY SEALED MAIL.
No C. O. D. or Deposit Scheme.
All persons who suffer from the harrowing
effects of nervous disease should write the
Yon Mohl Co., Cincinnati, Ohio, at onoe, and
receive by return mail their five days trial
treatment of "Calthos" free of charge. This
is no C. O. D. or DEPOSIT scheme, but a gen-
erous offer made to unfortunate sufferers by
this long-established concern, which is the
largest Importer of specifics for nervou3 and
sexual diseases in the world.
The Yon Mohl Co. have the sole American
rights for Prof. Laborde's French preparation
of "Calthos," the only remedy known to ad-
vanced medical Bdence that will positively
cure nervous debility In young or old men.
This remedy has for years been used as a
specific in the French and Germai* armies:
and â¢ slnoe Its Introduction into the United
States its remarkable success In Europe has
been repeated in this country. Lost vitality
creeps upon men unawares. Do not deceive
yourself or remain in ignorance while you are
being dragrgred down by this insidious disease.
No matter whether this weakness is caused
WILL MAKE
THE FIGHT ON
REAL ISSUES
Republican Campaign
Plan Complete.
SPEAKERS IN THE FIELD
WILL NOT PLAY ON PASSIONS
OB PREJUDICES.
Charles L. Patton and D. A. McKln
lay Will Speak at a Mass
Meeting To-Night at Me
tropolitan. Sail.
The executive committee of the Repub
lican State Central Committee and the
campaign committee of the County Com
mittee have now completed their plans
for enlightening the voters on the real
issues of the campaign. Both the local
and State committees are working in har
monious accord, and no voter will be able
to offer the excuse, if he votes wrong on
November 8, that he did not thoroughly
understand the issues involved. The Re
publican party is making a straight-out
and open nght. Every orator and every
candidate on the stump will tell the peo
ple just what the real issues of the fast
approaching battle of ballots portend.
There will be no playing on the passions
or prejudices of the voter. No false is
sues will be raised. The real and great
issues cf the campaign will be distinctly
and clearly set forth, so that all who
are anxious to be enlightened will receive
the information they seek.
The speakers will indulge in logic In
stead of misleading and blinding flights of
rhetoric. Every county in the State
will be visited by men of note who are
thoroughly acquainted with the political
situation of the day. Here in the city
the local candidates will expose the
methods of the "job chasers" who are
being led on to defeat by the master of
demagogues, James D. Phelan.
First Assistant Secretary of the Inte
rior Webster Davis, who is on a visit to
this State, will take the stump next week
and discuss the national Issues Involved
In the present State campaign. He Is
an able speaker and bears the record of
having never used his power of oratory
unless In the cause of right and justice.
He will speak at Sacramento on the 22d
inst.; Oakland, 24th; San Jose, 25th; Mo
desto, 26th; Frasno, 27th; Bakersneld,
2Sth, and at Woodward's Pavilion In this
city on the 31st.
A mass meeting will be held In Metro
politan Hall to-night, when Charles L.
Patton, the Republican nominee for
Mayor, D. A. McKJnlay and other promi
nent speakers will discuss the Issues of
the campaign. The meeting will be .pre
sided over by W. J. Brady of the Eureka
Boiler Works, who has heretofore been a
Democrat.
E. F. Preston, who accompanied Henry
T. Gage during his triumphal tour
through the San Joaquln Valley, will
speak on Friday night at Odd Fellows"
Hall.

Southern California Climate and Crop
Bulletin.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 18.â The United
States Department of Agriculture, Cli
mate and Crop Bulletin of the Weather
Bureau for Southern California, for the
week ending October 17, IS9B, reports:
The weather was generally warm and
dry during the past week, except In some
of the coast sections, where morning fogs
occurred. The warm weather was bene
ficial to raisin making, but It was detri
mental to orchards, which are suffering in
some places, though in others oranges and
lemons are doing well under the unfavor
able weather conditions, and well-tilled
loam soil will yield a crop of fine fruit.
Farm work continues at a standstill and
will remain so until the much-needed
rains come generously and copiously.
State Supreme Court Adjourns.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 18.â The Supreme
Court adjourned to-day for the October
term, having completed its work for the
session. Most of the Justices went north
on the train to-night.
by early abuse, excesses or overwork and
business cares, the results are the same â
premature loss of strength and memory, emis-
sions, Impotency and enlarged veins (varlco-
cele) and diminutive parts. "Calthos" will
cure you at any stage before epilepsy results
with ensuing consumption and Insanity.
The beneficial effects of "Calthos" are felt
at once in the manner most desired, and the
remedy being of pure vegetable origin is
harmless to the most delicate person. It
greatly increases the circulation of the blood
through the small arteries, thereby generat-
ing immediately a warm exhilaration felt
from head to foot, that makes possible results
that have heretofore existed only In the Imagin-
ation; bringing to the married more perfect
union and harmony, and to the unmarried a
sense of new delights. It is a scientific fact
that a continuous rapid circulation of blood
through the smaller veins makes muscle and
Increased development in any part of the body
where this* condition can be induced. "Calthos"
acts directly at the seat of trouble, no matter
of how long standing, and restores strength and
vitality and develops the parts permanently and
naturally. All feeling!? or bashfulnesa and lack
of confidence toward the opposite sex are ban-
ished by this wonderful treatment, and a man
becomes thoroughly his own maeter by his full
control over his desires and actions.
The Yon Mohl Co. ia continually receiving
the most astonishing testimonials from per-
sons who have taken only five days' treatment
of "Calthos," and from thousands of others
who have been permanently cured after having
been given up by doctors, misled and ruined In
health by disreputable medical schemers and
when they had given up their last hopÂ« for
health and happiness. Some Irresponsible ad-
vertisers are using "made-up" testimonials but
the Yon Mohl Co. invariably declines to make
public the names or correspondence of any na
tlents who have been cured by "Calthos " FTva
days' treatment of "Calthos' r will be piaced in
your hands free of cost by sealed mall and you
are earnestly urged for your own Bake to send
for it without delay. Write to-day and send
your address. It is not necessary to give em
barrassing details of your symptoms The book
â¢ent with the five days' treatment will enahla
you to take the medicine in private and treat
yourself at home. It coats nothing to try thi
remedy. It may coet you a great deal to let
this offer go by. Write to-day M

Belief That M. H. de Young
Is Seeking Senatorial
Honors.
A large nnd enthusiastic meeting was
held at Metropolitan Hall lust night un
d'-r the auspices of the Maguire Lreague of
Clubs. Governor James H. Budd was
cimlrman of the evening- and Walter P.
Stradley the orator of the occasion.
Stradley spoke for nearly two hours on
the State and national issues of the cam
paign as viewed from a Democratic
standpoint. He was frequently inter
rupted by outbursts of applause. Gov
ernor Budd made one of his usual happy
addresses, and received an ovation when
be appeared on the stage.
The meeting was called to order by
Oscar Hooks.
Alfred Donton Crldge of Hanford made
a brief addnss in which he predicted the
success of Maguire and James H. Barry
at the polls.
John P. Dunn, candidate for member of
the State Bi ard "f Equalization, was
next introduced, but had not proceeded !
far in his remarks when he was cut short I
by the arrival of Governor liudd, Walter
P. Stradley, William P. Lawlor, T. B.
Treacy and Charles H. Holcomb. presi
dent of the Maguire League of Clubs, j
Preceding- them was a band playing mar
tial airs, while behind them came sev
eral hundred members of the League un
der the marshalship of James D. Powers.
There was not sufficient room to accom
modate the new arrivals with seats, and
>f them were compelled to stand on
the platform and in the side a.
:: Governor Budd was Introduced
.irman, he was greeted with a storm {
*-rs. He said:
Well, It does not appear to me as though i
any soiit in the Democratic party has lost ue
any Democrats. [Applause.] This 1s the larg
est meeting that I In my exrorience have ever
seen gathered in or in the vlcintly of this hall.
[Applause.]
Later in the campaign I intend to address
the citizens of this city on the issues, at least
what I consider issues of the present campaign.
At the present time it is my duty to preside
over this meeting and introduce to you the
gentlemen selected to discuss those Issues to
night. There is one thins-, however, which con
cerns the Democratic party of this city more
than any other. We may differ upon methods
In the past; we may differ upon procedure that
haÂ« been had, but we are now. lined up bÂ»
fore a common enemy and it Is the duty of
every man who claims that he* belongs to the
democratic party and holds its success dear to
his nrt to either get in behind the Demo
cratic banner or walk rut of the party forever.
Goverr.cr Budd thon addressed himself
to the Senatorial fight. He called special i
attention to the Importance of electing a
Democratic United States Senator.
Walter P. Stradley, who followed Gov
ernor Budd. dealt principally with the f
financial issues of the national campaign. |
He said that the Democratic party was |
In the right to stay until the> single gold I
standard was driven into the sea. He j
then said that the opposition was black- j
guarding- and vilifying James G. Ma- j
quire because they feared him. "If elect- !
el Governor," said he. "Judge Maguire i
will not be under corporation control or I
rule. He will give a government for the
people and by the people."
In dealing with the recent war with
Spain Stradley said that in his opinion it
was unavoidable and that it had been
fought by the American people on non
partisan lines.
Edward J. Woodman, candidate for
State Printer, and Edward L. Fitzgerald, j
nominee for Public Administrator, made !
ehort speeches, after which the meeting
adjourned with cheers for Budd, Stradley
and Maguire. "â¢â â .:â¢-â¢'â

THE MAYOR AS HE IS
AND AS HE APPEARS
WOULD REDUCE
THE WAGES OF
THE LABORER
Says Lamp-Lighters Should Be
Paid Twenty-Five Dol
lars a Month.
QUESTION ASKED BY DISCREDITED
DEMOCRATS.
Plain Facts Concerning the Way in
Which the Tearing Up of Street
Car Tracks on Market Street
Was Done.
Since James D. Phelan, the "heft
ing" Mayor, constituted himself the
Democratic party of San Francisco, and
by his acts and declarations has given
publicity to his belief that he is the
only honest man within the confines of
the State, there has been a growing
desire in the minds of the voters of
the city to know more of the man who
appeared as a political bud two years
ago and has now blossomed into a full
blown boss who does not want anything
but office.
Unfortunately for Mr. Phelan. this
curiosity on the part of the public has
resulted in bringing to light facts that
are not at all to his credit. The pic
ture of Mr. Phelan, as presented by the
facts, when contrasted with the like
ness of the "hefting" Mayor, as etched
by his own ready tongue, shows him
to be a mean and petty schemer; a man
who, though wealthy, resorts to the
most miserable subterfuges to further
add to his wealth at the expense of the
public; a man who has used his offi
cial position to promote his personal in
terests, and a man who is the willing
tool of designing persons who do not
hesitate to delude the public in every
way possible, if by doing so they can
further their own selfish Interests.
So marked is the difference between
Phelan, the candidate for office, and
Phelan, the office holder, that the con
trast is apparent even without the most
cursory examination of the man. The
one dons a slouch hat and an air of
good fellowship and goes among the
laboring men with a tale of his love
for them and his earnest wish to pro
mote their welfare; the other sits on
his throne In the City Hall and makes
public declaration that he believes $2o
a month is adequate remuneration for
the services of the men who light the
city's gas lamps.
Be it understood that the grasping
corporation that employs the gas lamp
lighters â the men who cover the end
less miles of city streets through wind
and rain and fog every night and
morning in the year, that the safety
of the after-night pedestrian may be
assured â pays them but a pittance of
$40 a month for their hire. This fact
came to light during the proceedings
that attended the recent fixing of gas
and water rates by the Board of Ku
pervisors. The admission was made
by an official of the gas company.
Those who heard it, having in mind
the Mayor's ante-election utterances*,
expected* him to launch forth in a with
ering condemnation of the greed that
induced the corporation to make such
miserable recompense for faithrul ser
vice. Nothing of the kind. The Mayor
gave evidence of great Indignation, it
is true, but it was for a different rea
son. He announced with some show
of spirit that to pay the lamp lighters
$40 a month was nothing more or less
than gross extravagance, and that in
his opinion the sum of $25 a month was
amply sufficient.
Think of it! A beggarly $25 a month
for a laboring man, and out of this
he must pay house rent, provide for his
family and rear and educate his chil
dren that they may become good
American citizens. And this from a
man who is the possessor of millions,
through no effort of his own, and the
Mayor of a great city that boasts r.f
being the choicest blossom in \he gar
den spot of the world. A Chines*
cook who would accept such a sum for
his monthly wage would be boycotted
by his tong â and rightly so.
It Is in connection with this same
proceeding of fixing the gas rates that
THE SA^T FEANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1898.
another query is being made, and It is
one that perhaps the Mayor will see his
way clear to answer and thus set at
rest a grave suspicion that may result
In the loss to him of many of the votes
he is so industriously seeking. It will
be remembered that the Mayor vetoed
the gas rate as fixed by the Board of
Supervisors. Possibly he was justified
In so doing, as it is not recorded that a
corporation like the gas company has
ever done less than rob the city in the
matter of rates. But this fact does not
answer the query, which is, in brief:
"Was not the Mayor's act in vetoing
the gas rate influenced by the fact that
he is a large holder of stock In a rival
gas company that would be greatly
benefited if paid a subsidy and given
the contract of lighting the city's
streets and public buildings?" The
ways of Providence and "hefting"
Mayors are inscrutable.
Many persons have watched, with
varying degrees of interest, Mr. Phe
lan's efforts to make capital out of his
action in ordering the removal of the
horse-car tracks on Market street and,
incidentally, the subsequent paving of
that thoroughfare. To those who are
acquainted with the facts the compla
cency with which the Mayor has ab
sorbed the compliments that a subsi
dized press has showered upon him in
connection with this matter, as well as
the manner in which he has arrogated
to himself all the credit that attached
to the action, has been instructive. It
shows the man in a different light from
that in which, without doubt, he views
himself and his actions, and in which
he wishes the public to see him.
The facts are these: Some time be
fore the removal of the tracks was ac
complished Governor Budd sat at lunch
with a party of friends at a down-town
club. One of these friends was a well
known attorney who, by the way, is
also a very prominent Republican.
During the course of the round-the
table talk the subject of street railways
was introduced. The attorney, who is
a recognized authority on matters per
taining to street railways, stated that
he had recently made an exhaustive
study of the point and had ascertained
that there was no law to warrant the
maintenance of four car tracks on Mar
ket street by the Market Street Rail
way Company. A few days later Gov
ernor Budd called on the managing
editor of the Examiner and detailed the
conversation just referred to. "Here^is
a chance for you to make some political
capital, " said the Governor. "Phelan
Is your man and you can advise him to
tear up those tracks and he will get
the credit for it. Send down to Judge
Brldgford and get an opinion from him.
If the opinion corresponds with what
I have told you turn Phelan loose and
he will get the credit."
E. A. Bridgford represented Colusa
County in the last Assembly, but is
now a member of the Committee of
One Hundred. He was called into con
sultation and after studying the law on
the subject rendered an opinion in ac
cordance with what Governor Budd had
been told by his friend at the club.
Phelan was then taken into the con
fidence of his protectors and told to go
ahead and win glory and the undying
gratitude of an appreciative public.
Such is a true statement of how the
Mayor lays awake nights studying out
plans for the betterment of the masses.
It may also be stated in passing that
the tearing up of the tracks and the
subsequent paving of the street added
materially to the value of Phelan's
property on Market street.
Like all true tales there Is a sequel
attached to Mr. Phelan's act in clearing
Market street of the horse-car tracks.
The tracks having been disposed of the
question of repavlng the street waa
next in order. Bitumen was the kind of
pavf-ment selected for doing the work.
It is here that query No. 2 comes in.
It has been propounded by many curi
ous people who have, during the past
three weeks, watched the laying of the
block pavement in front of Mr. Phe
lan's premises on Market street. These
curious people want to know what in
ducement was offered by the proprie
tors of the block pavement company to
enable them to secure the use of sev
eral hundred feet of the principal
thoroughfare of the city for the pur
pose of setting up a sample of the goods
they have for sale. It would be as in
teresting to know if the Mayor owns
stock in the block pavement company
as it would be to know if his official
acts have been unconsciously influenced
by the fact that he holds stock in an
opposition gas company.
The spirit of Inquiry is In the air.
The Democratic voters of San Fran
cisco have been debarred from having
any voice in the selection of their can
didates for office on the ground that
they are unworthy of such a trust. This
being so It is not without reason that
these same voters should make inquiry
as to the purity of the man who has
impugned their honesty and good inten
tions. Up to the present time the in
quiry has not developed anything to
the credit of the man who has consti
tuteu himself the Democratic party of
San Francisco.

AN EVENING
WITH MANY OF
THE CANDIDATES
A Rousing Republican
Meeting.
CHARLES L PATTON SPEAKS
CHEERS FOR HENRY MARTIN,
McKINXAY AND MTJRPHY.
Interesting Addresses Made by Those
Who Will Go Into Office
After the Coming
Election.
The people of the western part of the
city, those living near Golden Gate Park,
had an excellent opportunity of meeting
and getting acquainted with the Republi
can candidates lust evening. A rousing
meeting was held under the auspices of
the Associated League of United Labor
Clubs in Cyclery Hall, 506 Stanyan street,
at which Edward Howe presided.
Long before the time for calling the as
sembly to order every chair In the big
apartment was occupied by people whose
Republican enthusiasm could not be
doubted, Judging from the manner In
which every candidate was welcomed as
he entered the hall. There was plenty of
musical talent there as well. Probably
what attracted the most attention v. as
the anouncement that Charles L. Pat
ton, candidate for Mayor, and D. A.
Mc&lnlay of Santa Rosa were to be pres
ent and address the gathering.
Theso were by no means the only per
sons who aspire to office. In tact th^
whole platform was tilled with candi
dates and none left feeling that lie 1 had
not been welcomed. The first to speak
was Mr. McKlnlay, who said that he pre
ferred to discuss matters of national and
State importance than those municipal.
He said that this campaign is being con
ducted upon entirely new lines from any
in the past. All sectionalism had been
â wiped out forever by the recent war
where North and South fought side by
side for the honor of the nation and the
glory of the flag. He urged his audience
to uphold the administration by sending
baok to Congress men who would see that
none but Republicans are favored at the
hands of the legislator*. As a reason why
the present administration should be up
held he cited the fact that since President
McKlnley went Into office more men :iro
at work and more factories are in oper
ation than for many a long month pre-
The' speaker paid his respects to Candi
date Maguire, saying that the latter has
endeavored to make the people believe
that the railroad was the only issue in
the present campaign. That ie not so.
If such was the case. Mr. Maguire would
be asking to be sent back to Congress, In
order to get his name into the papers as
an anti-railroad man. Instead of urelnK
the people to elect him to the position
of Governor of this State. Mr. McKln
lay also pulled the candidate for Gov
ernor over the coals on the single tax
proposition.
\\ hile he was speaking there was a
great shout in the roar ot the hall, which
announced the arrival of Mr. Patton. Tho
latter took the platform at once, and In
one of his simple characteristic speeches
told the audience what they might ex
pect of him if they elect him to tho high
position of Mayor of this city. Ills posi
tion in favor of the new charttr, dol
lar limit, public ownership of public utili
ties, park Improvements, etc., were stated
clearly and met with Urn approval of
those whom he addressed. At the con
clusion of his short address Mr. Patton
said that the Republican party will d>
more for the laboring man than the Dem
ocratic party will, and finished by refut
ing the statement that he is the creature
of any boss or corporation.
D. J. Murphy, candidate for District At
torney, made a rousing speech, in which
he dlaeusst'd the merits of the many who,
under the Republican banner, are seek
ing the votes of the people. Before fin
ishing he had a few words to say of hi
political opponent, Barclay Henley, who
he declared is not? to be trusted, judging
from the man's past life. Henry S. Mar
tin, who aspires to be the next Sheriff,
received an ovation that would flatter
any one. The crowd cheered him from
the time he entered the hall until he left.
Among the other candidates present
who made a few remarks were Edward
H. Algeltinger for Supervisor, John D.
Siebe tor Assessor, Martin F. Fragley for
Superintendent of Streets, Charles Curry
for Secretary of State, William A. Deane
for County Clerk, 1. J. Truman for Treas
urer, A. C. Berthler for Recorder Ed
ward I. Sheehan for Tax Collector.
Thomas Graham for Police Judge, Police
Judge C. A. Low for re-election, Thomas
F. Dunn for Justice of the Peace and sev
eral others. â¢ It was voted as one of the
Golden Gate Republicans.
The Golden Gate Republican Club met
laÃt night at the lower hall of the Met
ropolitan Temple. M. H. Morgan pre
sided. The club was addressed by W. A.
Kemp, who Bald that although a nominee
for School Director on the Republican
ticket he was not going: to make a tirade
against the present board.
Frank Brill then took the platform and
placed Julius Kahn in nomination for the
club's indorsement as Congressman, which
was given with a will, amid cheers. Mr.
Brill claimed that It was the most im
portant part of the election to strengthen
the President's hand by electing a Repub
lican Congressman.
Lawrence Mulranen placed the name of
J. G. Edwards before the club for its in
dorsement to the position of member of
the State Board of Equalization. He
dwelt at some length upon the merits of
the candidate, and his ability to (111 the
position. The indorsement was made by
acclamation.
The club intends to hold a smoker next
Tuesday evening to which all of the Re
publican clubs will be invited.
Another Labor Ticket.
Registrar Higgy Is In a quandary over
the receipt of another United Labor tic
ket, acompanied by 3311 names. Political
Manager Grace 1b the sponser for this
one, and he informed the Registrar that
the other United Labor ticket presented
by Attorney Nagle was not the real ar
ticle. The Nagle ticket has a Democratic
aspect, while that of Grace is a sort of
omelet of all parties. It is claimed that
certain candidates have been offered
places on the ticket for $75 a head. One
of them made this statement to the Reg
istrar, but the latter declines to glvo
names. It is openly alleged that the
multiplicity of tickets in this campaign
had been caused by an overweening de
sire on the part of certain politicians to
Bell places thereon to the highest bidders.
Meeting of Republicans.
The regular weekly meeting of the
Fortieth Assembly District Republican
Club will be held at the corner of Post
and Fillmore streets this evening at S
o'clock. The voters of the district, with
their lady and gentlemen friends, are ex
pected to turn out in force, as Charles
L Patton and other prominent candidates
for local offices will be present to ad
dress the assemblage. Owing to the
large number of aspirants for political
honors on the municipal ticket and their
desire to show themselves and meet the
voters of this district, these weekly meet
ings will continue up to November 4. on
which date the club will hold a grand
rally and mass meeting at the Franklin
Hall. .

Some thirty odd years ago Showman B.
E. Wallace was in partnership for a brief
season with James Whltcomb Rlley. At
that time James was not a developed
poet and Wallace was not the proprietor
of a big circus. The latter tells the story
in this way:
"Rlley came tramping into Peru, Ind.,
one day. He was out at the elbows, out
at the knees and generally out of luck.
He came to me for assistance. I was run
ning a small livery stable, and it was a
1 hard Job to make ends meet. So when
Riley, who was an utter stranger, braced
me for a horse and buggy for several
days, saying he had a scneme to make us
both richer, 1 was in considerable doubt
as to whether 1 should venture or not.
Riley stated that he was a painter by
trade, and that he would contract with
tea or more of the merchants in town to
pafnt< signs on the farmers' fences alor> nr
j the country roads announcing that 'This
is the way to Jones's!' and 'Smith has
the best boots!' etc. He would charge $1
apiece for the signs and paint at least
forty of them, provided that 1 would find
him in white paint, pay for his lodging at
a hotel and give him a buggy for several
days, taking naif of the gross receipts for
compensation.
"Trie fellow was so earnest and looked
po hungry that, for the life of me, I could
not refuse him, so at the business we
i weiit. I secured the paint and guaranteed
i his bill at one of the small hotels. I also
i loaned him a horse and buggy. He went
j at the Job with a will and soon secured
! contracts from half of the merchants In
town to decorate the country fences. At
that time roadside signs were Just begin
> nlng to come into use, and around Peru
none had been painted up to the time of
Rlley's advent. But, bless you. it wasn't
long before the whole region was bedeck
ed with trite sentences telling- of the won
; derful cheapness of the goods of Smith
and Jones. The merchants were well
pleased, especially as on some of the
signs there was a display of rhythmic
sentences like this. To secure sound sleep
buy of Cheep.' Rlley took in $40 within
1 two days, for he was a swift artist with
the brush, and I received half and was
Wfll repaid for my venture. Rlley went
from town to town painting signs upon
the fence boards and earning a comfort
able living, I have no doubt.
"Only last year near Peru some carpen
; ters were tearing down a barn that bad
been built up against an old fence, and
they came upon one of Rlley's signs, long
obscured from view and with the paint
I comparatively bright, tilling the multi
tude to go to Jones' cheapest store on
earth.
"Things have changed since th<">=e (lays.
Riley made his reputation as a poet and
did not have to paint fences any longer.
1 got out of thp llv.-rv business and began
; running a show, ami my former partner
was seen no more. But I sometimes think
1 of him and wonder what wo-ild have been
, his fate If he had not had that rhyming
twist to his brain. Perhaps he would
! have been painting fences all of his days."

Tabules that the formula has long been in favor with
medical men, but the method of preparation in the pres-

lately spoke of them to me in these very words : " I
always keep a vial of the Tabules upon my dressing-

arises. For a disturbed condition of the digestive or-

CROTHERS WEEKLY EXPLAINS.
THERE has been some doubt among the few
who pay attention to the attitude of the Bul
letin on political questions as to the excuse
Crothers has for his conduct. Others among the few
have never had any doubts.
The Bulletin says it favors Julius Kahn for Con
gress because he is the nominee of the Republican
party. An excellent reason, Mr. Crothers, a con
vincing reason, one which does your perspicuity
proud. You might have added that he happened to
be the best man for the position.
But the Bulletin in its feeble way is for Phelan for
Mayor. Why? Phelan is not the nominee of the
Republican party. He is a Democrat. It might al
most be said that he is THE Democrat. He is the
whole party, brains and appetite. Surely he is not
being supported because he is a Republican, or do
the Bulletin heathen in their blindness bow down
to the little god of Democracy and not realize what
they are doing? If the fact that Kahn is a Republican
is a sufficient reason for supporting him, it ought to
be sufficient reason for supporting the whole ticket.
From the diadem of the Bulletin editor there is lack
ing the jewel of consistency.
When a paper throws its trifle of influence to one
man because he is a Republican, and at the same time
whoops things up for another candidate who is on the
other ticket, it ought to be more explicit. Other
wise unkind people will think that it has been pur
chased. Such a suspicion would be painful to a per
son so delicately sensitive as Crothers. Another ex
planation is due, even overdue. The Bulletin has
given no reason for being Phelan's creature. It must
have a reason. Why not be frank? If there was a
price paid there would be a $Ã¼bdued $atisfaction in
knowing what Crothers thinks himself worth.
SWEARS TO ITS OWN DECfIY.
THERE are few occasions on which any neces
sity appears for believing anything the Exam
iner may say, but we are inclined to think it
truthful when it swears to its loss of circulation. For
months it has been going down hill, and with
tender regret we have called attention to the fact.
During September the daily circulation, according
to its own affidavit maker, was 2184 less than during
August. This is a great decline. Details are lack
ing, however. There is no showing of what part of
this circulation went to the garbage crematory. Such
circulation may justly be termed "paid," for the
burning of it entails an expense of 20 cents a cubic
yard. â¢
While this falling off has taken place the Examiner
has been making desperate efforts, through the pub
lication of stupid puzzles and the promise of prizes,
to popularize itself. Doubtless this scheme has re
sulted in the sale of many extra copies, and without
it the showing would have been worse by far for the
paper itself, though better for the community.
When it is reflected that the present Board of Su
pervisors is made up of the personal selections of
the Mayor, when the fact is recalled that it has been
corrupt and inefficient, the circumstance that the
Mayor declares there are four wards in the city from
which no fit citizens can be selected as Supervisors
does not seem to be in the nature of a compliment.
The army has won nothing in esteem by glossing
over the offense of two officers at Honolulu who,
while drunk, placed themselves on exhibition. It is
not even probable that the army can square itself by
being severe with privates who are similarly obstrep
erous.
Mayor Phelan laughs at a practice for which Stern
berg went to San Quentin for a term of years, al
though at the time he said the offender ought to have
a life sentence. The difference is that now the of
fender is Phelan.
According to the Mayor there are four wards in
this city which cannot furnish anybody fit to repre
sent them in the Board of Supervisors. There must
be a better excuse than this for "colonization."
One boy has shot another at Quincy, as usual em
ploying an empty rifle for the purpose. The Coroner's
jury returned a verdict of accidental death, but the
death was not accidental. It was criminal.
Since the Examiner has its spy system in opera
tion, it might keep track of Phelan as well as of Pat
ton. The public is really interested in the way the
Mayor spends his time.
Spanish officials seem to be sorry that they yielded,
but the time is too late for any but vain regrets. How
ever, if they want an opportunity to yield again, in all
likelihood they can get it.
PURITY OF THE PHELfIN STONDORD.
\yi ANY people have believed that the Mayor,
/ \ whatever his fault of arrogance, regardless of
* * his absurd assumption of power, was guided
by an honorable intent. He has prated of purity in
politics, and they have blindly overlooked base
methods to which he has resorted. They could not
think he would be capable of false pretense. They
chose to consider him as having been maligned.
To The Call has fallen the task of unmasking
Phelan. It was not a pleasant task. Neither was it
one to be evaded. It has found the purified and
purifying Mayor guilty of practices for which men of
less influence, unequipped for doing as much harm,
have been sent to prison and stripes, and it has told
the story. When Sternberg went to San Quentin
for the crime of colonizing voters, one who most
roundly condemned him was Phelan. When he was
pardoned, after having served two-thirds of his term,
the ground being that he had been the tool of others,
who had wholly escaped, it was the Mayor who most
loudly voiced a holy indignation, declaring that
Sternberg or anybody similarly reprehensible merited
a life term.
It seems to us that the act of the Mayor in in
ducing Eugene Murphy, an honorable citizen, to
"colonize" in a ward other than that of his residence,
was a greater crime than that perpetrated by Stern
berg. At least the hollow hypocrisy of it gives it a
worse look. Sternberg did not stand forth as a re
former. He was not the talking apostle of nobler
and loftier politics. He was not a man of wealth and
standing. He had not been trusted by the people with
a great office. Phelan did not colonize a mere voter,
but it was his design to have Murphy elected a Su
pervisor. He made a specious plea that the course
was legal, in the interest of good governmentâ was,
indeed, laudable* So well did he present the case
that for the nonce he convinced Mr. Murphy that no
evil was being done.
But to the colonist there came a second and wiser
thought. He reflected that the course was morally,
even if not legally, wrong, and withdrew. He went
back to his home and left the Mayor to handle the
purity business without him. Mr. Murphy is an up
right citizen, his word acceptable wherever he is
known. Moreover, it is in this instance enforced by
circumstantial evidence. There is no escape for the
Mayor from the conclusion that he has been caught
in a deliberate attempt not only to colonize a voter,
but a candidate. If Sternberg merited a life term,
what shall it be said Phelan merits?
The Mayor is backed by the unclean Examiner
and the equally nasty Bulletin. Possibly he could
have officially survived the handicap of such friend
ship as this, but when he is exposed as a trickster,
his insincerity made plain, his virtuous words robbed
of their effect, his pious attitude shown to be a cant
ing pose, it may be said that he has brought about
his own defeat. Neither the throwing of mud nor
money can save him now.
PHELfIN'S WATER RATE DIVERSION.
THE case of Fitch vs. the Board of Supervisors,
which filled so large a space in the public eye
about this time last year, having been decided
by the Supreme Court in favor of the officials whom
Mayor Phelan ousted from office, it will be interesting
to observe the comment of our reform Democratic
fellow citizens upon the reasoning of the Judges.
An evening contemporary remarks that the scheme to
oust the Supervisors for failing to fix water rates in
February, 1897, was an attempt to Mexicanize the city
government. By this it is intimated that the Mayor
endeavored to change the local government without
resorting to the formality of an election.
If it be true, as alleged, that the Mayor actually did
contemplate Mexicanizing the city, he must have been
acting under the advice of his esteemed Mexican fel
low citizen, Barclay Henley, now his candidate for
District Attorney. Mr. Herrley, as is well known, was
formerly a Mexican Marquis, and is therefore prob
ably familiar with the Mexican method of overturn
ing governments.
The decision of the Supreme Court, however, will
not be likely to promote the political aspirations of
Mayor Phelan. On the contrary, those who take the
trouble to read it will perceive that between the lines
it administers a deadly blow to the species of dema
gogy upon which he has been making politics in
this city, and by means of which he has hoped to lift
himself into the Lord-Mayoralty under the new char
ter. The court declares that proceedings for ousting
officials for dereliction of duty under our law must
be criminal in their nature, that no crime was com
mitted by the Supervisors in making a water rate in
vestigation which ran over the month of February,
and that if a valid water ordinance can be passed in
any other month â which the court has already decided
could be done â when the constitution declares that
rates shall be "fixed" in February it means that pro
ceedings shall be commenced in that month.
The monstrous feature of Mayor Phelan's theory of
fixing water rates under the constitution and the act
of 1881, however, receives little attention from the
court, perhaps because it was not necessary to con
sider it. Reference is made to his idea that innocent
Supervisors must be punished along with the guilty
for malfeasance in office. It will be remembered that
Lackmann and Rottanzi opposed laying over the or
dinance of 1897. They protested against Dr. Clin
ton's motion to postpone and declared that if adopted
it might endanger their official tenure. Yet when the
proceedings to oust the board came along they were
included among the guilty and Judge Wallace held
that they must also be punished by being deprived of
their offices.
Subsequently the Mayor reappointed them, but the
precedent he sought to establish was clear. This pre
cedent was that innocent men must be punished in
order that the guilty might be reached â a principle
so abhorrent to all justice as to approach perilously
near barbarism. The purpose of Phelan and Fitch
in adopting this theory was, however, ill-concealed.
They were. forced to save Supervisors Clinton and
Dodge, who had been chiefly instrumental in post
poning the fixing of water rates, and they ousted the
board as an entirety to do it. Then Phelan rose to
the occasion by appointing the four anti-Spring Val
ley Supervisors to his new board.
Now that the Mayor and his assistants in this
scheme to obtain possession of the government by
force are on record as a pack of fools, the people
should not fail on November 8 to express their
opinion of all of them who are running for office.
The Rev. Mr. Nead w/is not convicted of vagrancy
because there was no evidence against him. Eleven
jurors out of twelve thought him innocent, and what
the other juror thought is a matter for speculation.
When Mayor Phelan is detected in an act which
seems contrary to the spirit of the law he explains
that it is in the interest of good government.
Phelan has had one Board of Supervisors. He is
trying to pick another. There is no reason for
thinking his judgment has improved.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1898.
A COftIBINfITION OF SLANDERERS'

Democratic State Committee, the Examiner
and certain anonymous persons who clearly
represent the notorious school book ring has begun
a campaign of slander against State Printer A. J.
Johnston, who has been renominated by the Republi
can party and who will be supported by all citizens
whose minds are too honest to be affected by slander
and who desire an efficient administration of the
office.
Fortunately for Mr. Johnston, the record of his ser
vice has been made public by an official investigation.
The slanders put forth against him by the writers of
an anonymous circular in the interests of the school
book ring, and supported by Maguire, hi 9 henchmen
on the Democratic State Committee and his organ,
the Examiner, have all been thoroughly inquired into
and disproved. The refutation of the slander is to be
found in the official records of the State.
When the charges were originally made they came
almost directly from the school book ring. The last
Legislature appointed a committee to investigate
them. That committee was composed of three mem
ber*, of each House, and represented both political
parties. For the better performance of its work the
committee appointed four experts â two Republicans
and two Democrats â to examine the work and the
accounts of the office. Two of the experts were
skilled accountants, and two were experienced in the
printing and bookbinding trade. Their report was
unanimous, and concludes as follows:
"The testimony taken has been very full, and much
time has been devoted to this hearing. And, having
given the whole subject careful consideration, we are
of the opinion that the office of Superintendent of
State Printing has been conducted on business prin
ciples and with economy and due regard for the pub
lic interests."
The object of the school book ring in making the
fight against Mr. Johnston is to brfeak down the State
school book system and leave the schools and the
people of California once more a prey to their plun
dering. Our own experience taught us what that
ring wa* in times past, and the reports that come from
the East at every session of the State Legislatures
there show it is even worse now in its greed and in
its corrupting power than it was in the days when
California was one of its victims.
It is significant of the cunning and the trickery of
the ring that it has not made an open attack upon
Mr. Johnston. It has prepared an anonymous cir
cular and arranged to get Maguire's State Committee
to circulate it and indorse it. The circular was sent
out by the committee accompanied by a letter signed
by Seth Mann, chairman, indorsing it and requesting
the Democratic press to copy it. Notwithstanding
this indorsement by Seth Mann, the Examiner said
yesterday: "Concerning the authenticity and author
ity of the original circular we are unable to speak, for
we do not know who is responsible for its appear
ance." If the Examiner will inquire of Mr. Mann
it will probably find that Maguire is responsible for
its appearance, and that back of Maguire is the
school book ring.
The animus of the whole thing is revealed in the
sneers of the Examiner at the State School Book
League. That organization, representing California
labor and California schools and having no other ob
ject than that of protecting our people from the
rapacity of a ring whose corruptions are notorious in
every State in the Union, is recognized to be, like the
State Printer, a dangerous foe to the ring. Hence
the combination.
Meantime Maguire poses as a friend of labor.
Meantime the Democratic State Committee claims to
be opposed to corrupt rings and monopolies. Mean
time the Examiner protests it does not know who is
responsible for the anonymous slander.
\A ISS GENEVIEVE RANSOM of Nebraska
/ \ is to be congratulated. She got as far as the
* * altar with a young man, and there he left her.
Of course she fainted, for the surprise was consider
able, and the wedding feast had been prepared re
gardless. The almost-groom balked because he de
tected on the breath of the pretty-near-bride the faint
and yet significant odor of a cigarette. He turned
upon her, spoke the accusing words and then turned
upon his heel and went away from there.
Fortunately she did not attempt any defense. Per
haps had she pleaded tearfully he would have re
lented. Possibly if her big brother had given him a
kick he would have braced up. In which case. Gene
vie ye, instead of being free and at liberty to smoke
cigarettes, would have been tied until death or divorce
to a* tyrant. Undoubtedly the deserter has all the ele
ments of a domestic boss. He would have ruled the
house with a rod of iron and probably placed his wife
on an allowance of one print dress a year. Now she
can pucker her rosy lips around as many cigarettes
as she pleases.
It seems that she had promised to cease the prac
tice, but just an hour before the time set for the cere
mony had been induced by a bridesmaid to take a
farewell whiff. In swearing off any habit the reformer
is accorded the privilege of tapering. There is no
wisdom in giving the sensibilities a violent wrench
when they can be trained to new ways by pleasant
degrees. The surprise in the whole matter is not so
much the conduct of the groom, who must be reck
oned a crank, but the fact that Nebraska girls indulge
in cigarettes. There has been an idea that this habit
among American women was confined to cities, but
never that the pastoral stretches of the Middle West
contained yellow-fingered bachelor maids with
breaths redolent not of the wholesome onion, but of
tobacco. Nevertheless, while in no manner lending
approval to the course of the bachelor maids, they
have a right to follow it if they choose, and any man
to be scared from the altar by it does not constitute a
grave loss.
According to the Examiner the present Board of
Supervisors is a "vile crew." Perhaps the allegation
gives little ground for dispute, but it must be re
membered that this same crew was selected by Mr.
Phelan.
As all of the bad Indians but have agreed to
surrender there is hardly a probability of a general
war. The troops available ought, with the raw mate
rial, to be able to make the solitary renegade good.
Vanderbilt remarked that the public might be
damned. Phelan echoes the remark, and an unrea
sonable public objects, for times have changed.
Nobody can blame the Mayor for laughing when
charged with illegal acts. In fact his only chance to
laugh is between now and November 8.
Misled by an exaggerated idea of his own impor
tance, Phelan says, "The King can do no wrong."
Only Phelan isn't king.
When Dewey shall reach this city the people will be
too busy welcoming him to inquire as to his politics.

FATHER OTIS'
GREAT PROJECT
The project to cleanse the city In the
vicinity of Dupont and California streets
of vice and moral pollution is receiving
the support of the public, but not the
support of the city officials. Father Otis
of St. Mary's Church, when asked if he
knew anything about the ordinance clos
ing' the streets, said:
I do, and very much that Is hard to be ex
plained. We have taken an interest in the
closing of Bacon place because it has a direct
influence upon the work -which St. Mary's Park
Association has undertaken, besides being an
open violation of the law and In opposition to
decency and morality. We have taken more
than an interest; we have taken action. Some
three or four weeks ago, after consulting, legal
authorities, we were Informed that Bacon place,
appearing upon the official maps of the city,
was In consequence a pubiic street, and, there
fore, no individual has a right to obstruct this
public tstreot by erecting gatea or other ob
stacles. Mr. ' Shadburne called at the office of
Superintendent of Streets Ambrose and re
quested him to remove the gates, as they were
there In violation of the law. Mr. Ambrose
was absent at the time. His deputy promised
to lay the matter before him on his return and
volunteered the assurance that he would un
doubtedly take action at once. We waited a
few days. No action was taken. Mr. Shad
burne, our representative, called several times
at Mr. Ambrose's office, but failed to meet him.
After a week or ten days I called Mr. Ambrose
by telephone and aaked htm If he intended to
take action or not. I simply wanted an answer
from â yes or no. He expressed himself as
willing to do so, but that he was not certain
that Bacon place was public or private, and
hÂ» wanted time to consider It.. I requested him
to give me a direct answer whether he would
act or not act. He said he could not. I bade
him good day. Since then he has taken no
action, and evidently, from his standpoint, the
question la one that cannot be decided in a
month. It was stated that If Mayor Phelan
would give the order to have the gates re
moved it would be acted upon. Why public
officials cannot take action in a case in which
their duty seems clear without receiving orders
from the Mayor to do so is something I cannot
understand. Mayor Phelan has shown himself
to be in favor of every movement for the im
provement of the city, and we honor him and
acknowledge our debt of gratitude for his as
sistance in the work of eradicating the nuisance
which ha 3 so long defiled the fair name of San
Francisco.
We did more than appeal to the Superintend
ent of Streets. We called the attention of the
Society for the Suppression of Vice to the state
of affairs existing on Bacon place and re
quested it to take action against the open vice.
Mr. Kane at once took an active Interest in
the matter. We concluded first to ask the
Chief of Police to take action. As a repre
sentative of St. Mary's Park Association Mr.
Kar.e called upon Chief Lees and asked him
to abolish the nuisance. He stated that the
existence of public vice In the Immediate
neighborhood of the condemned property had
a retarding effect upon the purchase of the
same- that certain owners pointed to Bacon
place "and declared that St. Mary's and Quincy
streets would be reopened. The Chief refused
io take any action. He declared that he would
iot be made a tool to depreciate the value o
thÂ« adlolnln* property, and told Mr. Kane it
the matter was to be discussed to tell the prin
because it was a standing scandal. Th : result
of the interview was that the Chief refused

HOW TO COUNT
PUBLIC FUNDS.
The class In city politics was in session
and the master asked a number of ques
tions that were pertinent and of decided
importance to the voters of this city at
this time.
Define president of the Board of Super
visors in San Francisco.
The Mayor, elected by the city and
county at large, is the president of the
Board of Supervisors, and it is his duty
to preside at all sessions of the board
without the right to vote.
What are the specific duties of the pres
ident of the Board of Supervisors of San
Francisco?
The law says: "H shall be the duty of
the president of the Board of Supervisors
vigilantly to observe the uffiqial conduct
of each Supervisor in his district, and of
all public officers of the city and county,
and take note of the fidelity and exacti
tude, or the want thereof, with which
they execute their duties and obligations,
especially in the collection, custody, ad
ministration and disbursement of the pub
lic funds and property."
What must he do in the carrying out of
his specific dutlp*?
The consolidation act says: "The presi
dent of the Board of Supervisors, in con-
positively to take action. He asked why the
Board of Supervisors had not passed an ordi
nance condemning the place, and at the same
time declared that even if it did he would not
act under the ordinance, as the State law was
sufficient and yet he would not act at all.
Mr. Shadburne thanked him for what he had
done and withdrew. Chief Lees cent to me a
representative, who Informed me that the Chief
paid It was better to delay action regarding
Bacon place until after election, but that he
would not promise to act even then. I stated
that we would have to take action Independent
of him; that It was his duty to see to the in
forcement of the law. We had requested him to
do so. He hud demonstrated his ability to cope
with the evil by the closing of St. Mary's,
Quincy and Morton streets and Berry place,
and therefore his refusal to act was not due
to lack of power, but due to some other rea
son, and what that reason may be we do not
know.
No matter how capable and well-intentioned
officers of the police force of Y his city may be,
if they have at their head a man who will not
Instruct them to enforce the laws they are pow
erless to effect any material change in ex
isting evlU. Why we should be compelled to
do the work of the Chief of Police is another
thing hard to be explained. Ills representative
Intimated that the Chief would declare that he
was aaked to take action In order to depre
ciate the value of the adjoining property.
That was but one of the arguments used. Mr
Shadburne did not advance that argument, nor
did I. We requested him to act in accordance
with the law, which Is 4 sufficient argument in
itself and Mr. Kane simply mentioned that an
an additional argument. And it is an argu
ment. If Immorality Is permitted to be pro
tected openly in proximity to the proposed park
grounds it rives hope to the owners of the
places that were formerly used for the same
purpose that they would be able to use this
property for the same purposes again. Why
does the Chief not act? Can he not proiure the
evidence against these people? The owners,
lessees and occupants are known to others and
the evidence against them will be produced
in court and they will be prosecuted independ
ently of the Chief. We have reason to complain
about his inaction and we do complain! He
claims the honor of having closed St. Marys
and Qulnry streets. We freely concede it to
him and have asked him to take the additional
honor of closing Bacon place. Why has an
ordinance not been passed? That is another
question. We do not think an ordinance neces
sary, although It has proven a moral force
heretofore.
The majority of the Supervisors have shown
their interest in the suppression of vice by
passing several ordinances. We have not asked
them to pass an ordinance closing Bacon place
because we discovered that an ordinance was
already before the health and police committee.
The history of that ordinance is somewhat pe
culiar. It was discussed at a meeting of the
above mentioned committee on October 7. The
dally papers declared that the committee had
agreed to report favorably upon It. But It has
never come before the Board of Supervisors.
Bacon place Is running wide open. Dupont
street is returning rapidly to its former condi
tion, and how are we to preserve the good
effectedâ lf we accomplish no more â unless the
Chief actively assists us? The prosecution of
owners, lessors and inmates on these streets
will be begun at once, and what will then be
revealed remains to be seen. Parties Interested
In the maintenance of vice on Bacon place have
held meetings on Saturday evenings. These
meetings will prove interesting matter when
discussed later. We can afford .to take our
time. Endurance will prove an important ele
ment In peourinjr success, and we are giving
our attention to the best methods of developing
this factor.
Junction with the County Judge (changed
by a subsequent act to a Judge of the
Superior Court) and Auditor of said city
and county, shall, every month, examine
the books of the Treasurer and other
officers of said city and county having the
collection and custody of public funds
and shall be permitted and it shall be
their duty to SEE and count over all the
moneys remaining in the hands of such
Treasurer or other officer."
Who framed the consolidation act?
Horace Hawes.
What was his purpose in inserting the
words "see and count?"
The framer of the act named was a
Bhrewd old man. who believed that the
proper way to keep a public official hav
ing: the handling and custody of public
money honest was to make him be hon*
est, and see thnt he was not tempted.
He knew that if the president of the
Board of Supervisors did his duty as re
quired by law and saw the money with
his own eyes, no gold bricks or iron to
kens in bags could be foisted on him
for genuine money, and he knew that- if
the Treasurer or other official had to show
once a month the amount of coin his hooka
called for as a balance he could not
have an opportunity to play the flim-flam
game andTipproprlate the people's money.
Who is the president of the Board of
Supervisors of San Francisco?
James D. Phelan.
Did he do his duty as such officer as re
quired by the law?
In one matter he did not. He willfully
neglected to SEE AND CO I 'NT themoney
in the hands of the City and County
Treasurer, and allowed him to play the
flim-flam game and at the same* time
cast a stain on the fame of th^ city
by proclaiming to the world that it
had a dishonest official.
Can a man who will neglect a plain
duty of the highest importance be
trusted in the administration of public
affairs?
A man who can be false to his trust in
one matter can be false in every matter
and therefore should not be trusted with
further opportunity to mismanage pub
lic affairs. E. C. S.
Sutro Railroad Assessment.
An order was made by Judge Coffey di
recting Mrs. Emma Merritt and W. H.
R. Adamson. executors of the will of the
late Adolph Sutro, to pay an assessment
of |2 a share on 21.310 shares of the cap-,
ltal stock of the Sutro Railroad Com
pany, owned by the estate of the dead
capitalist. It was shown that through
the anxiety of creditors of the road to
enforce payment of claims it was neces
sary that the assessment should be paid.

WHAT IS
CREAM OF TARTAR?
It comes from grapes and is yielded in
the process of wine-making, most
extensively in France and Italy.
Cream of tartar is brought in a crude state to this
country, where three-quarters of the entire importation is
refined to the highest grade in the works of the Royal
Baking Powder Company.
' This highly refined, pure cream of tartar â the product
of the healthful grape â is the material from which a
pure and healthful baking powder must be made. More
expensive, of course, than other ingredients frequently
used, but being healthful itself it adds healthfulness to
the food instead of degrading it as do the baking powders
that are degraded in quality to meet a degraded price.
The celebrated Royal Baking Powder is made of
highly refined, pure and healthful cream of tartar. Its
great qualities have made it famous in every country in
the world, and it is the most appreciated of all baking
preparations by all good cooks and up-to-date house-
keepers.

Major General Merriam has received
the official report of Brigadier General
King, commanding at Honolulu. It con
tains much intonating data concerning
the health and discipline of the troops,
and an account of the recent dis
turbance that occurred between the sol
diers and citizens. The report completely
exonerates IJt-utenunt Merriam, son of
General Merriam. who was reported to
been under the. influnce of liquor

Just after leaving the Denver House,
Owen came up to him and without say

Babie went to police headquarters to

Owen, who was placed under arrest by

Owen had the appearance of a man who
was in an Incipient stuere of delirium

Babie presenting a revolver at him on thÂ«

A SPIRITED AND
EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGN
HENRY S. MARTIN IS A MOST
POPULAR CANDIDATE.
His Peculiar Fitness for the Office
Generally Acknowledged.
Amons the candidates on the Repub
lican-municipal ticket there is not one
who is making a more spirited and ef
fective campaign than Henry S. Mar
tin, the nominee for Sheriff. That he
will be successful by a large majority
is a foregone conclusion. Personally
Mr. Martin is and always has been a
very popular gentleman. His genial
personality has won for him hosts of
sincere friends during his life-long resi
dence in this city, and these friends
will be glad of the opportunity of prov
ing their friendship by casting their
ballots on election day for plain, every
day Henry Martin.
Mr. Martin has been identified for
years with many benevolent anc l char
itable institutions, notably the French
Hospital. He is president of this in
stitution, and during the encampment
of the troops at Camp Merritt he was
among the prime movers in the prop
osition to give to sick soldiers the use
of the hospital gratis.
Mr. Martin's substantial property In
terests in this city make him peculiar
ly alive to the responsibilities of the
office he is seeking, while his extensive
business experience makes him emi
nently qualified for the discharge of its
duties in a highly satisfactory man
ner.
With candidates in general this is the
tlmf; when the "glad hand" is freely
offered, but in many cases, after elec
tion, the voter receives instead the i
"glassy eye." It is not so, however, !
in Mr. Martin's case. He has always i
been noted for his affability, and has ;
always been easy to approach at all
times and under all circumstances. As
voters find this gentleman during his
campaign, so have they found him be
fore and so will they find him after his
election, plain and unassuming, yet al
ways courteous and obliging; a man in
every respect deserving of the confi
dence, esteem and suffrages of his fel-
low men.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 19, 189 S.
GAS VETO IS
LAID OVER FOR
THREE WEEKS
No More Political
Capital In It.
ROTTANZI WANTS SOME LIGHT
THE "SOLID EIGHT" BECEIVE A
SHOCK, BUT RALLY.
A Canadian Lady Faces the Supervis
ors and Gets Her Pet Dog
Cheaply Released From
the Pound.
A special session of the Board of Su
pervisors was held yesterday afternoon
on the call of Mayor Phelan. The only
absentee was Supervisor Morton, who
was out of the city. It was quite evident
that the gas veto recently sent in by the
Mayor was the inciting cause for this
gathering of forces, as it was scheduled
to come before the board for final action.
No time was lost In reaching it. The
veto was read, declaring that the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Light Com
pany was not entitled to the payment of
Its street lighting bills for August and
September, aggregating about $15,000, as
there was no legal contract In existence.
Supervisor Smith at once moved to
postpone consideration of the veto for
three weeks. "That â will carry It past
election time," explained the Supervisor.
"I understand that some people ure try-
Ing to make political capital out of the
gas contract, and I object to such unfair
procedure."
Supervisor Rottanzl, who had voted to
overthrow the Mayor' 6 first veto of the
gas bills, took the floor and announced
that as the second veto was apparently
based upon more tangible grounds than
the first had been he was in favor of
having the City and County Attorney
render an opinion on the legality of the
gas contract and on the special objec
tions that the Mayor raised 10 it. "In
case that this legal opinion is favorable
to the Mayor's veto I shall probably vote
to sustain it," remarked Rottanzi. This
statement produced something of a sen
sation among the other Supervisors, as
it was by Rottanzl's vote last time that
the veto was overridden.
Sheehan wanted to have the veto laid
over for three weeks from next Monday.
By that time Supervisor Morton will be
home, and his vote is counted on against
the veto. Lackmann, Clinton and Dodge
advocated Immediate action on the veto.
Finally after several ballots Sheehan,
Britt, Devarry, Hasklna. Rivers, Delany
and Smith carried the day. and the veto
was laid over for three weeks.
Scarcely had this matter been disposed
of before Supervisor Clinton sprang a
surprise upon the entire board by stat
ing that a lady was present who had a
grievance against the Poundmaster wh!ch
she wished to explain to all of the Super
visors. He asked the vcourtesy of the
board to allow the lady a few moments.
Haskins was on his feet to protest, but
seeing no signs of objection on the part
of his confreres, he subsided with a pro
test that "such matters ought to go be
fore the proper committee."
A moment later Dr. Clinton brought
forward a very pleasant looking woman,
of rettned manners, " who spoke cleurly
and to the point. "I wish simply to
state," said she, "that yesterday after
noon my fancy pet dog was out in front
of the house near the door, when a rep
resentative of the poundmaster came
along, seized the animal and carried him
away. As the dog was a valuable one I
at once set to work to secure its release.
Some one told me that if I went to a
Supervisor and secured an order I could
get the animal out by paying 60 cents,
whereas if I simply went to the pound
without an order, it would cost me $2 60
to secure my pet's release. As I am a
Canadian, recently arrived in San Fran
cisco, I supposed that the advice was cor
rect and I went to Supervisor Clinton,
who happened to be the most easily
reached. I had never met him before,
but he very kindly gave me an order on
the poundkeeper, made out on a regular
printed blank, asking for the release of
the dog. Armed with this document I
went to the pound, where I was met by a
deputy, to whom I presented my paper.
He glanced at it for a moment and then
handed it back to me with the remark,
'It don't go. We don't recognize any per
mits hero that are signed by Clinton.
Only permits signed by the solid eight
are received.' Now, I don't know any
thing about the solid eight and I don't
see how I am to get the dog, unless I pay
the $2 60, or the Supervisors order - the
poundmaster to honor Dr. Clinton's per
mit."
The eight looked at each other In si
lence, not knowing whaft to say, while the
audience in the Supervisors' chamber
laughed aloud. Finally Brltt arose with
the inquiry, "Are you sure that he said
'solid eight?' "
"Quite sure , sir; those were his very
words," responded Mrs. Simpson.
"Then come over here, madam," ex
claimed Captain Delany, "and I will
make it all right," and escorted by Dr.
Clinton, Mrs. Simpson crossed the room
to the captain's seat and secured his sig
nature below that of Clinton's, request
ing the poundmaster to liberate the dog.
"That will go, ma'am," explained the
captain, "but I wish you to understand
that this thing of liberating animals
from the pound on a Supervisor's request
is not obligatory upon the poundmaster.
It is only a favor."
With this the scene came to a close,
with suppressed comment throughout tne
The board appointed Alfred Fuhrman
collector of delinquent taxes. Edward W.
Williams was reappointed Justices' Clerk
for a period of two years. An order was
passed prohibiting the sale of theater
tickets by any person not holding a li
cense, the rate for a license being fixed
at $25 per quarter or JIOO per yenr.
A leave of absence for forty days was
granted to Park Commissioner A. i>.
Spreckels.
The board killed the resolution prohib
iting bicycles and vehicles from approach
ing within five feet of a street car when
stopping to take on or let off passengers.

was granted a license to hold an amateur
boxing exhibition at B'ne B'rith Hall.

MRS. RICHARD BURKE DEAD.
Cablegram From Ireland Announces
Her Demise.
Michael Meagher has received a cable
message announcing the death of his
niece, Mrs. Richard Burke, at Fethard,
Tipperary, Ireland.
Mrs. Burke was born In this city In
1860. She was a daughter of James Dona
hue, who with his brothers, Michael and
Peter, established the Union Foundry in
this city In 1849. He was, until the time
of his death in 1862, the president of the
San Francisco Gas Company.
The late Colonel Peter Donahue, who
built the San Francisco and North Pacific
railroad, was Mrs. Burkes uncle. Her
brother, Peter J. Donahue of Laurelwooa
Farm, Santa Clara County, is now trav
eling in Europe.
Mrs. Burke, whose maiden name was
Margaret Donahue, was married at St.
Mary's Cathedral in this city to Richard
Burke, barrister at law, of Clonmel, Ire
land, in ISS2. Their married life has been
a most happy one. She leaves a husband
and four children to mourn her loss.
Mrs. Burke was known to a large circle
of friends in this city, who will mourn
her loss. She was noted above all things
for great gentleness of character and her
never falling Bymjpathy for the poor.
WHERE THOSE
MEDICOS TAN
HUMAN SKIN
Mr. Peterson's Candid
Admission.
HE USES SALT AND ALUM
DR. TUGCH.ES OF TOLAND'S IS
VERY NON-COMMITTAL.
He Denounces the Practice as Based
on Theft, and Hopes The Coll
Will Succeed in Stamp
ing It Out.
The expose of the unlawful use of hu
man skin purloined from autopsy and
dissecting rooms has caused widespread
fear in the breasts of the students of the
colleges. The professors and higher med
tcal men universally denounce the prac
tice of tanning the human skin. Any
student convicted of the crime will be ex
pelled from college.
The demonstrator of anatomy of Toland
Medical College, Dr. Samuel G. Tuggles,
when interviewed yesterday, could not
deny the truth of the statements of The
Call, and said:
"What stand the university may take
in the matter I cannot say. For my own
department I can say that I do not know
any particular student who may have
tanned or caused to be tanned human,
skin. The subjects are skinned before
being dissected. I am not always in the
dissecting room, and I suppose some of
the skin gets tanned. The Call seems to
know more about that than I do. I have
been very much Interested in what it had
to say, and I hope It will put a stop to
this disgusting practice.
"The students are obliged to attend the
lectures three times a week under the
different physicians who lecture at the
City and County Hospital. They do at
tend autopsies and probably have oppoK
tunities to remove the skin. It. is steal
ing- and against the rules of the college, !
and when a student is going to break a
rule he does not tell the professors be
forehand.
"Yea, 1 know that medical students do
such things, but If they do it at Toland
1 dt> not know anything about it."
There is a tannery at :Ul2 Army street,
Just back of thi? Cogswell College, run by
Poetsch & Peterson. A physician gave
this place as the one which does the tan
ning for the young physicians connected
with the City and County Hospital.
At the tannery Mr. Peterson described
again the details of the business as revolt
ing as the smells which live around his
place. He F;<id:
"I have tanned plenty of human skin
for the medical students and dot-tors who
cut up the people to see what killed them
before they died."
"You are sure you can do it well; I am
very particular."
"Oh. yes: I have been doing It for two
or three years. It is not a hard thing
to do. I just soak it one day in strong
salt and waterâ plenty of salt. Then,
when it gets pretty soft I soak it for
aluiut a week in some alum and salt and
water. Then if it must be dark I smoka
it."
"I see. Can you show me a piece?"
"I have one little piece, but ft is not
so good. You see it was poor skin to
begin with."
"Do you know where this skin came
from?"
"A doctor who was just cutting people
up at the county hospital. It was wrapped
up in a paper and was fresh."
"Did he say he was from the City and
County Hospital?"
"Oh, yes. They all Fay they come from
there. You see it is not so far away. Can
not I tan some for you? I can do line
work."
An old man, a Mr. Booth, who has
worked in the tannery and lives at Ilry
ant and Twenty-sixth streets, said he had
seen human skin in the office of Poetsch
& Peterson, and that they could tan it
because they did not use bark.
"Won't bark tan the skin?"
"Makes it as rough as a bear's back."
"Do they tan much skin?"
"Yes. They try to keep it secret-like,
but the doctors and young medical stu
dents bring in pieces to tan every little
time. They handle it in the office, but
the doctors don't makf any sreret of it.
They want the leather for slippers or
razor strops, or something like that."
"What do you think about this tanning
of human skins?"
'Poor folks can't afford to think of any
thing. "Taln't no use."
A shoemaker at Twenty-sixth and
Howard streets pays he has seen human
skin in the office of Poetsch & Peterson.
"The boss showed me a piece of skin
a few days ago and asked me if I knew
what It was. It looked just like pig skin,
but I knew it was tanned human skin,
bocaupe the pores are larger. He said
the doctors from the City and County
Hospital had brought It to him."
The internes of the City and County
Hospital are mostly young physicians,
and upon them rests the accusation of
the tanners. Over them are Dr. F. W.
Dudley. Dr. J. O. Hirshfolder, Dr. W.
W. Kerr, Dr. C. N. Ellin wood and Dr.
R. A. Mcl>oan. Yesterday afternoon the
only interne at the City and County Hos
pital who was visible was D. V. Lu
chetti, who Pays he has no Christian
name. He is a young mnn,- very young.
He has an idea, apparently that the au
topsy room as well as the entire hospital
was founded and Is maintained for the
benefit of young doctors and students.
He said: "Why, I never saw any skin
Jn the autopsy rooms, did you? Do you
want to have some tanned? I do not
know anything. So Mr. Peterson says we
give him skin to tan. I can't say. I have
all of mine yet. Come down town and
lett have a good talk over the matter.
I never have a word to say to such peo
ple as Peterson; my time is too valua
ble. I just go to the autopsies and see
what I want to see, but never anything
else. See?"
"But, Dr. Luchetti. this is not a joke."
"Is it not, though?"
EMEBIC CONTEST DISMISSED.
An Action in Equity Now Relied
Upon to Determine Title to the
Property in Dispute.
The contest and amended contest of
Harry Emeiic to the- application for the
probate of the will of his late wife, Eu
genic Emerlc, were dismissed yesterday
by stipulation. This ends the litigation
in the courts of Ban Francisco, but a suit
in Contra Costa County yet remains to be
disposed of.
By the dismissal filed yesterday Mr.
Emerlc relinquishes his claim to Borne
$10 000 worth of jewelry bequeathed to
Lorena Myrtle Barbier by the will of Mrs.
Emeric. Mr. Erneric will now concen
trate his efforts in an endeavor to estab
lish hiÃ contention that the Contra Costa
property, valued at between $tW,OOO and
$80 000 was held in trust by Mrs. Emeric
and consequently she had no power to
dispose of it by testament. Emeric al
leges that several years apro, when as
he supposed, he was on his death bed.
he deeded the property to his wife to
hold in trust, the trust to be dissolved In :
event of his recovery.
When he recovered his wife refused to
suraln place the property in his hands, and
ifter her death It was found that she had
beaueathed it to her sister. Miss Barbier.
Mr Emeric now seeks to obtain Judg
ment of the Contra Costa court, declar
ng that the property was held by his
wife In trust and that Miss Barbier is
not entitled to the f state by reason of
the title vested by the will or her de
ceased "later.

NEW YORK DRIED FRUIT MARKET.
The New York Commercial, under date of
October 11, says:
"There la little perceptible difference as
compared with previous conditions. All dried
fruit men are willing- to admit that even
though prices are held firm, trade is dull and
demand much smaller than is usually expect
ed at this season.
"The raisin situation is not cleared at all.
Buyers are holding off, waiting for the an
nouncement of the association, and movement
Is restricted in consequence. There is gener- t
ally brisk tra<le in raisins at this season, but â ,
present circumstances prevent that, and the
entire trade has assumed a waiting attitude.
"Prunes are unchanged from last week.
Large sizes are wanted, but large sizes are
unobtainable. Buyers do not care to pay the
price aske<" for small sizes, and holders prefer
to keep their large ones to assist In moving
the undesirable stocks. The result is restric
tion of movement, which shows little Indica
tion of Increasing.
"Spot stocks of Valencia raisins are small,
â¢nd stocks to arrive are held at 6%e. There
Is some demand for old crop seeded, and prices
have advanced to G^c for 1-pound cartons, j
â while 3-crown are held firm at 7c. The first j
arrivals of new crop are expected about tha
middle of the week.
"The market is barely supplied with flgfc.
Estimates of yield are being reduced, and ]
from an early statement of 35.000 camel loads j
the figure is now down to about one-third that !
number, or one-sixth the yield for 1597.
"Apricots and peaches remain in virtually i
the same position as at last reports. Stocks !
are small; prices are ftrm; buyers and hold- !
ers appear to be apart in their views. The I
result is restricted trade and small movement, j
Some expert demand is noted, but no Import- j
ant sales reported."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Oct. 18.â Prices of stocks
drifted sluggishly and to all appearances aim
lessly all through to-day's session. The almost
stagnant condition of the market was scarcely
relieved by a single feature. Even the "trust"
stocks fell into neglect after a long period of
fluctuations. Tobacco was forced down at the
opening on explicit announcements that the
much-talked-of plug tobacco combination had
once more fallen through. There was injected
Into the dullest portion of the day's tra<i:ng two
successive transactions of 12,500 shares and 6000
. shares respectively of Tobacco preferred at 115
"eeller 30. " This represented a transaction of
over $2,0u0,000 and was supposed to show the
disposal of tt.-a company's treasury stock, ap
plication for the listing of which was made
yesterday. The common stock was rather fever
ish for a time aftsr this, but settled down into
steadiness and neglect. There was an upturn
In sugar aIBO during the day, which was ex
plained by the news that certain grades of soft
sugars had been advanced in price. Realizing
subsequently wiped out practically all the ad
vance. The railroad list held generally firm
throughout the early part of the day, but sub
sequently eased off in sympathy with sugar and
the Northern Pacifies. The dally attack on the
coalers lacked vim and the decline only reached
a point in New Jersey Central. The traffic
statement of St. Paul for the second week in
October, showing an increase over last year' 3
earnings of nearly $140,000, is undoubtedly a
pretty fair indication of what is going on In
the grain-carrying roads. All reports agree
that it is difficult to secure enough cars to
meet the demand for the freight movement,
both east and west bound. The speculatlva
public apparently views these developments
â with apathy. The same apathy existed to-day
In all the security markets of the world, the
pause in London being attributed to waiting for
more settled political conditions and the com
pletion of liquidation In Berlin. The process of
accumulating exchange here is going on from
day to day and the banks continue to gain cash
from the sub-treasury. The final allotment of
Government 3s from Washington makes It
probable that Government deposits in national
banks will soon approach the $100,000,000 mark,
after which the deficit In the revenues is ex
pected to steadily diminish their account.
Bonds were dull but firmly held to-day. Total
sales, $1,345,000.
T'nitPil States old 4s registered advanced %,
United States old 4s coupon and the Es % in the
bid price.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 174,500
shares, Including: Burlington. 3389; Manhattan,
8775; Metropolitan, 7500; Northern Pacific, 9555;
St. Paul, 9015; Union Pacific preferred, 4332; To
â  barcn, 14.955; Tobacco preferred, 18.559; Sugar
40,770.

wheat at Liverpool over night, the reported
concentration of a large body of Russian troops
accessible to Peking, In addition to reports
! from New York that there were forty-two boat
i loads of wheat engaged for export, stirred the
opening market for wheat and made a strong
and lively affair of it. The stormy_ weather
In the Northwest was an additional influence.

of thl6. Influential people here were selling
through brokers and commission firms. Then

primary market receipts Indicated that the
big export business could be supplied and leave
a surplus here besides. The early sales caused
a drifting down of the price and December,

â  about 40 per cent of the amount expected and
â¢ caused a recovery to 65% c. Reports of serious
i frost damage to wheat in Argentine gave the
I market near the4close quite a little strength.
There was a considerable short interest and

1 The strength developed by corn at the start
was due largely to a sharp advance at Liver
pool. The storms also promised to check the
arrivals and gave the bulls a chance to oper

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 18.
Ground will be broken to-morrow for
the building of the "Dottle Gooke" Annex
to Fabiola Hospital. This annex is to bo
built partly with money that was the per
. sonal property of Miss Dottie Cooke, who
died last spring. During her lifetime,
which ended so soon. Miss Cooke was al
ways interested in children, and when she
died her private account amounted to
$3000. When conscious that death was not
far off, she requested that her money be
spent in some manner for the benefit of
little children. Her mother, Mrs. Har
riet Lee Cooke, after some consideration,
offered to build a children's annex to
Fabiola, and to endow it in such a man
ner that it will accommodate eighteen
children, which is one for each year of
her daughter s life.
The offer was formally made to the
lady managers of the Institution, and ac
cepted. The plans have bet-n prepared by
D. F. Oliver, the architect, and work will
be commenced right away.
The Dottie Cooke Annex will be two
stories In height and there will be one
large ward on each floor, with several pri
:ooms. A large playr. >om has been
arranged, which will be fitted with toy
and shelves and everything to make
the little unfortunates happy. The exte
rior of the building is of the Grecian style
of architecture and embodies all the latest
Improvements that have been developed in
similar Institutions. The connection with
the main building will be by an elevated
glass corridor from the second story.
A feature of the exterior will be the
porch entrance, which will be spanned by
a heavy arch supported on pillars. On the
face of this arch will be a tablet of stat
uary bronze, bearing the inscription.
"Dottle Cooke." The keystone will unfold
the words, "Her wish for children."
Prominent in the interior will be a mem
orial window, which will be placed at the
end of the playroom and will contain the
portrait of the donor, surrounded by a
Wreath of flowers with a ribbon, on the
flowing end of which will be written, "For
my sake let the little one 3 be tended."
The contract for the building has been
already signed and It will be ready for a i
dedication by Christmas.

Mrs. Ottn Lange did not stay long with
her husband after her return from the
elopement with Mr. Barclay. She has
gone again, and her destination is un
known to her husband. He does not know
whether she has returned to Barclay,
but he prophesies great trouble for Mr.
Barclay should he discover that the err
ing pair are once more together.
Although Mrs. Lange returned to Oak
land last Friday, she disappeared the next
day, and has not been seen in this city
since, although some letters hays been re
ceived from her. Last Saturday she wrote
to her husband from San Francisco and
told him she was not yet ready to return,
he was advised not to worry over her.
and informed that when all the troublo
has blown over she may come back.

I was compelled to give up my occu-

conGtantly taking medicine of some

constipation, causing loss of sleep, and
running m e <j own serloU sly in weight.

years, who Is detained at the Receiving

He resided with his mother, Mrs. Mary
Bell-Kelley, at 861 Harrison street, and
has for some time been employed as a
waiter at the Maison Piedmont Bakery.
He says he was taken to the Receiving Hos

He appears perfectly rational, yet admits
that, though 19 years old, he has spent
two years at Agnewa Asylum. His father

PROSECUTION CLOSES
IN MEADOR'S TRIAL
FOSTER TESTIFIES TO PRISON
ER'S PREMEDITATION.
Attorney Deuprey Says the Prosecu
tion Has Assisted the Defense,
Which Will Close To-
Morrow.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct 18.
The prosecution has closed in the case
of James Nathaniel Meadors, who is on
trial for the murder of Jonas Ury, a pri
vate of Company C, Eighth Regiment Cal
ifornia Volunteers. The trial was re
sumed in Judge Kllsworth's court this
morning when George Fouls testified.
But very little additional light was
thrown on the killing.
There was a long delay when the court
opened this afternoon, owing to the tardi
ness of Attorney Deuprey'a appearance,
and when Meador's counsel did appear an
other delay was occasioned through the
difficulty of locating H. G. Foster, who
when he was finally brought into court
proved a very damaging witness against
Meadors. His testimony was to the ef
fect thai Meadors, when first persuaded
to put up his knife, had said, referring to
Ury: "Never mina, I'll get you yet; and
you won't be the first one, either." Wit
ness, on cross-examination, said that he
had been to Piedmont baths with Mead
ors, but he denied that he had ever at
tempted to create opinions unfavorable to
the prisoner. During the afternoon Pri
vate Jarvis was recalled.
At the conclusion of Jarvis' testimony
Deputy District Attorney Harry Melvin
arose and caused a surprise by announc
ing that the prosecution closed. "But,"
said he, "Mr. Dtuprey and I have stip
ulated that when Dr. S. H. liuteau can
come he be permitted to testify as to
the location and nature of the wound
which caused Ury's death."
This was admitted by Attorney Deu
prey, who thereupon also caused a little
surprise by announcing that the defense
would probably close by to-morrow after
noon.
"I hope that there will be no misun
derstanding as to the prosecution clos
ing. I thought it would close to-mor
row, and under the circumstances have
not marshaled our witnesses together;
but I feel satisfied th>t the defense will
close its case to-morrow. The prosecu
tion has assisted us greatly in ascertain
ing what took place prior to the morn
ing of August 16. We might save time
by adjourning until to-morrow, and in the
meantime 1 will prepare my instructions."
Before the matter went over, however,
Attorney Deuprey called Deputy Sheriff
Smith to the witness stand. He wished
to bring out a conversation that he claims
took place between the deputy and wit
ness, H. G. Foster, in which the latter
seemed anxious to create an unfavorable
opinion as to Meadors. Deputy District
Attorney Melvin, however, stoutly ob
jected and hie objections were sustained.

THE W. C. T. U. IN SESSION
REPORTS SHOWING THE WORK
OF THE ORGANIZATION.
Mrs. Sturtevant Peet Gives an Able
Address â How to Make the
White Banner
Popular. .
BERKELET, Oct. 18.â For the nine
teenth time in its history, the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union of California
met In annual convention to-day. The
full number of expected delegates have
! now arrived, and when the State secre
tary called the roll this morning, it was
found that enough were present to almost
fill the First Presbyterian Church in
which the conference is being held. The
white ribbon is everywhere conspicuous.
The delegates cling to their symbol of
purity, and the rules of the convention
require it to be worn upon all occasions.
With the opening session this morning
began the discussions of reform In which
the union is engaged. The temperance
workers are full of enthusiasm, and they
Bhow it at every opportunity. They cheer
for woman's suffrage, for prison reform.
fur the abolition of saloons, for prohibi
tion, for social purity, and for the raanl
foid movements in behalf of which the
white ribbon stands.
Mrs. is. Sturtevant Peet, the California
president, called the conference to order
shortly before 10 o'clock. A committee on
credentials was appointed consisting of
Mrs. R. A. EmmonÃ, Mrs. D. J. Spencer
and William W. Bangs, and on resolu
tions, consisting of Mrs. E. G. Greene,
Mi.ss S. M. Severance, Mrs. F. Bennett,
Mrs. Hardy and Mrs. A. J. Wheeler.
The secretary's report showed that there
are now 126 societies in the State, having
altogether 3047 members. From the re
port of the State Treasurer it was learned
that these had contributed a total sum of
$4890 39 during the last year. An increase
in membership of over 400 had been added
since the last convention. Reports from
the State superintendent of different lines
of special work showed that Interest in
them is on the Increase.
In a paper on "How to Help the "Work
Individually" Mrs. S. Vnn Lennep told
the white-ribbonists that their small white
tanm-r should be worn on all possible oc
casions. She argued for the instruction
of all children in the principles of scien
tific temperance, and paid a glowing trib
ute to Mrs. Hunt of Pennsylvania as the
originator of this branch of study.
The feature of this afternoon's session
THE HEINRICHS IN A
DISTINGUISHED RECITAL
â Â»TOT since the Henschels were here last season have we had a song re
|\ I fltfil as artistic and distinguished as the one driven in the Sherman A
11 Clay Hall last night by Mr. and Mrs. Max Heinrlch and their
daughter, Miss Julia. Mr. Heinrlch Is first of all a musician
sympathetic and informedâ after
that he Is a singer. It la
his interpretation and the de
lightful authority of his accom
paniments that enthrall ytÂ»u
rather than any special beauty 01
his voice, which Is somewha
elderly and in places worn. This
latter fact you cannot help bui
discover, but It is never made ob
trusive, for Mr. Heinrich makes
no wanton . vocal display. He
never exceeds himself; hi 3 aim is
to bring out the full value of the
scoreâ the air, the text and the
accompanimentâ which he does
with splendid inspiration and
analysis. His reading of Schubert
and Schumann songs is poetic
and musicianly to the last note
and in last night's programme he
paid a pretty tribute to several
American composers. His idea ol
"The Erlking" Is the most thrill
lngly impressive that I have ever
heard.
The same artistic spirit Is mani
fest In the singing of Mrs. and
Miss Heinrich. The voice of the
former is not a carnival of gay
color nor notably fresh, but the
art Is there; Miss Heinrich has
a sumptuous contralto, finely pro
portioned and warm and rich; she sings with copious color, and her enun
ciation, like papa's and mamma's, is faultless. The Heinrichs will give
other recital* In thÂ© same hall on Thursday evening and Saturday after
noon. o.
MAX HLIINRICH.
was the annual address of the president.
Mrs. Sturtevant-Peet said:
"It Is because of unnatural and irra
tional conditions tliat the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union exists. This
is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the
crusade with which the movement orig
inated. For twenty-five years we have
Btood for purity and prohibition, ignored
by the courts and ridiculed by politicians.
It Is true the world takes little heed ot
our efforts. Our labor has been for free
dom. We look upon evil as the sole and
only cause of evil; It is only lack of back
bone and moral courage that tolerates
the saloon and perpetuates Its misery.
"There is too little sympathy and sup
port for the workers of prohibition. Too
many people are disposed to palliate the
evil which it combats. People who have
nothing but convictions upon this subject
are traitors, for it is treason for them to
ignore their duty toward existing condi
tions. The world brands us as fanatics.
But if to promote purity, to help the
fallen, is fanaticism, may God make us
all fanatics. Public opinion lauds deeds
of charity, yet It brands as fanatics
those who try to remove and eradicate
the causes of all this poverty and vice
which make this charity necessary."
The president was followed by the Rev.
W. W. Scuddor of Alameda, who, In an
address upon "The Responsibility for the
Status of Temperance To-Day ," laid the
blame for intemperance at the doors of
the church. "The fault was," he said,
"that the church sanctioned saloon li
censes. Even ministers and respectable
members of their congregations fail in
this respect. The church itself Is the only
organization that can change this condi
tion of things. Yet the church seems In
different. It does not put forth its great
est effort. It alone should inaugurate so
cial righteousness, and leave the State to
support and enforce it."
The Rev. John A. Wilson, D. D., enter
tained the audience with many humorous
stories. He argued for concentration of
effort In temperance reform. But the
reverend gentleman did not believe that
the church was responsible for intemper
ance, because, he said, the church did
not originate the evil. He estimated that
intemperance kept at least 30,000 people
each year out of churches and sent ;tt
least 100 ministers to drunkard's graves.
The Rev. John Coyle, D. D.. of Berkeley
said some hard things about ministers
who drink. "Intemperate ministers com
promise the morals of their congrega
tions." he said, "and, as a stream never
rises higher than its source, so the re
ligious reeling of the parish never gets
above the same level as that of the min
ister in charge."
At to-morrow's session the officers for
the ensuing year will be elected, as well
as the delegates to the next national con
vention.
DEATH OF F. W. WICKER.
He Succumbs to the Effects of the
Shot Accidentally Inflicted
on Sunday.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 18.â Frederick W.
Wicker, who shot himself accidentally on
Sunday afternoon while cleaning a pistol
at hlB residence, corner of Grand street
and Enclnal avenue, died this morning
from the effects of the wound. He passed
a reasonably comfortable night, the phy
sician remaining with him moat of the
time. At 7 o'clock this morning, how
ever, there waa a change for the worse.
Hia pulse went to 160 and his tempera
ture to 102, while there were indications
of blood poisoning as well as pleuro
pneumonia. All the efforts of the physi
cians proved unavailing, however, and
the Injured man passed away about 10
o'clock. Deputy Coroner Fowler will
hold an inquest to-morrow morning at 9:30
o'clock. Decedent was a native of Bruns
wick, Germany, aged 50 years, and leaves
a widow. The time of the funeral has not
yet been decided upon.

A NEW TAX LEVY
GIVES SOME RELIEF
OAKLAND, Oct. 18.â The City Council met to-night and again took up
the delayed tax levy. For several days the Tax Collector's office door
has been decorated with a sign containing these words: "No tax bills
ready. Rate not yet tixed."
An ordinance was already prepared when the Council met, and It was
at once seen that it had the support of the same six votes that passed the
former ordinance vetoed by the Mayor. Messrs. Pringle. Cuvelller and
Girard attempted to make a few changes, but the weight of votes was
against them, and with an explanation that It being so late something
must be done, it was passed to print.
The new ordinance reduces the amount for dredging the lake from
$SO,OOO to $60,000 and raises several of the department allowances above
those in the vetoed ordinance. The free library fund Is such that one of
the reading rooms only may have to be closed. The High School will
be $3000 below last year's cost. The street fund is cut, but as the ordinance
taxing vehicles 13 now being enforced much income is expected from this
source. This ordinance will be amended so that the vehicle tax will go
into the street fund. The amount for the east and west side sewers la
cut from $38,500 to $17,000 and the police and flre funds will be below those
of last year. The new ordinance fixes the levy at $1 21.
Reliance Athletic Club this evening drew
a large attendance. In the eight-round
contest between George Gates of the En
c-lnul Recreation Club and Jack Dennis
of the Olympic Club, the former showed
to good advantage and was given the de
cision. The other eight-round contest, be
tween Phil Gretiie of the Presidio and
"Bud" Parker of New Orleans, proved a
walkover for the soldier boy, who
knocked the Southerner out in the third
round. The preliminaries were interest
ing. "Kid" Johnson and F. Arnold boxed
a clever four rounds, and in one of
the other preliminari.s Charles Tye made
a show of T. McCarthy.

GBAPE BUYERS IN TBOUBLE.
Gambitz & Dolheguy Call a Meeting
of Creditors.
Gambitz & Dolheguy, the produce com
! mission merchants of 216 Washington
; street, have called a meeting of their
j creditors for Friday. The firm has been
purchasing grapes round Geyservllle, and
j owing to a combination of circumstances
i rinds it difficult to fulfill its obligations
immediately.
HEALDSBURG, Oct. 18.â Gambitz &
Dolheguy began their operations in
Cloverdale just before the season opened
by contracting for grapes at $8 and $9 de
livered on the cars, cash in ten days. They
made purchases from Windsor to Clover
dale, but the bulk of their grapes were
i secured at GeyHerville. Some of those who
! sold to them became uneasy at delayed
1 payments, and one leading grape-grower
jat Geyservllle Bent a representative to
' San Francisco to look Into the matter.
! The result of this precaution saved him,
! for he disposed of the balance of his crop
i to a Healdsburg winery.
I A representative of a grape-grower here
returned from San Francisco yesterday
after interviewing Gambitz & Dolheguy,
and will be present at a meeting of the
creditors of the firm at San Francisco
on Friday next. While there will be many
sufferers In this part of Sonoma County
from the operations of the firm, there are
those well informed in the grape and
wine industry who maintain that Gam
bitz & Dolheguy have been a blessing to
the grape-growers of the county on the
whole, as they started the price at a
jrnod figure, and it is maintained that
had they not come into the field grapes
would have sold at a much lower price
compared to the good price received. The
loss pus* Ined in a few localities is ln
elgniflcar.t. _
Exhorter Nead's Case.
The question as to whether J. M. Nead,
the Methodist exhorter charged with va
grancy, will be tried again will be deter
mined by Judge Conlan on Saturday. It
Is not likely that a new trial will be
ordered, from the fact that the Jury stood
eleven for acquittal. Nead received a
letter yesterday from Chandler Bros.,
merchants. Rockford, 111., inclosing a cer
tificate of good character for the years
he was in their employment as salesman,
during which he handled thousands of
dollars. _. I

Grand Scribe Barnes' report gives the
number of encampments as ninety-one,
with a membership on December 31,
1897, of 5334 â a gain of seventy-one for

The grand representative's report
shows that there are 54 Grand Encamp
ments, 2656 subordinate bodies fend 128,
930 patriarchs; total assets of subordi
nate camps. $1,529,131 59. The assets
of California encampments are $156,
462 39, or more than one-tenth of the
entire assets of the national jurisdic
tion. Total relief paid by the patri
archal branch throughout the national
jurisdiction, $265,965 15; paid by Cali
fornia, $17,458 15. The new encamp
ments Instituted during the year were:

ter, San Benlto County; Redwood En
campment No. 67. at Fort Bragg. Men
docino County; Azusa Encampment No.
54, at Azusa, L, js Angeles County ,
The following past chief patriarchs

The reports of the grand trustees,

The following resolution. Introduced
by Grand Representative Duran, was
ordered forwarded to President McKln
ley:
Resolved, That the Grand Encampment.
I. O. O. F., of California, In annual ses
sion In the city of San Jose, send greet
lng to William McKinley, President of
the United States, and the soldiers and
sailors of our army and navy, congratu
lating them upon the wonderful and
speedy victories achieved by their brav
ery in the lute- war with Spain. To the
sick and wounded brave boys our heart
felt sympathy is extended. May their re
covery be speedy and their restoration to
home and family assured.
This afternoon the following nomina
tions of officers of the Grand TSncamp
ment were made: Grand patriarch. J.
W. Harris of San Francisco: errand
high priest, Joseph Foster of San
Diego; grand senior warden. P. D.
Gummoe of Nevada City; grand scribe,
William H. Barnes (incumbent) of San
Francisco; grand treasurer. Georce \V.
Lemont (incumbent) of San Francisco;
grand Junior wardens, C. H. Wever of
Alameda, A. C. Bates of San Jose. W.
E. Dubols of San Francisco, J. E. Har
ris of San Jose, James Ashman of Los
Angeles; grand representative, O. W.
Erlewine of Sacramento; errand trus
tees, H. S. Winn, F. A. Week. W. S.
Potter, all of San Francisco. The only
contest is over the office of junior war
den and the other officers will be elected
by acclamation to-morrow afternoon.
An amendment has been proposed by
which a patriarch wishing to Join an
other encampment can do so without
taking a withdrawal card or without
losing his membership In his original
encampment in the event that the en
campment he makes application to
should reject him.
I. O. O. F. Hall is crowded this even
ing with visitors. The patriarchal de
gree is being exemplified by Occident
Encampment No. 42 of Sacramento, and
the golden rule degree exemplified by
Oriental Encampment No. 57 of San
Francisco. Both degree teams are noted
all over the coast. The Oriental degree
team is sixty strong, has the finest
paraphernalia in existence and is said
to present its work in a manner unex
celled on the coast. A banquet follows.
ARGUMENT IS CONCLUDED.
A Decision in the Botkin Extradition
Matter Will Be Handed Down
on Saturday.
Whether or not Mrs. Cordelia Botkin
will be extradited to Delaware to stand
trial for the alleged poisoning of Mrs.
Dunning and Mrs. Deane will be decided
next Saturday. When the hearing of ar
gument was resumed yesterday morning.
Attorney Prank MeGowan proceeded to
make the concluding argument on behalf
of the accused. Mr. MeGowan confined
his argument to a repetition of the theo
ries advanced by associate counsel, George
A. Knight. He also Insisted that the
"constructive presence" of the prisoner
in Delaware was all very well in theory
but did not exist in law.
Taken altogether the proceedings
amounted to little more than a reitera
tion of the proceedings before Governor
Budd a short time ago. In which counsel
for the accused had all the best of the
matter. When Mr. MeGowan concluded
his argument the case was submitted
and will be decided on Saturday.
STOCKTON, Oct. 18.â W. A. Botkin of
this city, husband of Mrs. Cordelia Bot
kin, is much chagrined over the action of
Governor Budd in signing extradition war
rant, after what he had previously stated
in the matter. "I do not Delieve that they
will get my wife back to Delaware," said
he to-day, "but if they decide to extra
dite her, she might just as well be hanged
at once, for feeling overrides ail justice
there in this case. The people of that
State want some one to pay the penalty
for the crime committed and whoever
I might be taken back there will be con
1 victed beyond a doubt." J
SLANDER SUIT
NEARLY ENDED
Attorney Jarman Makes
His Argument.
DEFENSE SUBMITS THE CASE
EVIDENTLY A TRAP TO SHUT
OUT DELMAS.
The Latter Wishes to Be Heard, but
Rea's Counsel Vigorously Pro
testâMatter Taken Under
Advisement.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 18.â The opening
argument In the Jarman-Rea slander
suit was made to-day by Attorney A.
H. Jarman, son of the plaintiff. He
occupied the entire day. The facts of
the case were gone over and Kea was
referred to as a "pure-minded, high
souled" person, Interested in the wel
fare of the city, who stopped at nothing
crooked to attain his end. Rea's testi
mony was reviewed and the boss" falla
cies pointed out. Jarman finished a few
minutes before adjournment.
Judge Kittredge then asked Attorneys
Morehouse and Burchard if they wished
to begin argument. The defendant's at
torneys stated that they would submit
their rase without argument.
Delmas then wished to make a sup
plemental opening argument. This was
objected to on the ground that plaint
iff's attorney had completed his open
ing statement. Delmas cited authority
to sustain him, and Judge Kittredge
took the matter under advisement until
the opening of court in the morning.
It was evidently a trap set by Rea's
attorneys, but Delmas refused to fall
into it. By refusing to answer Jar
man's argument Rea's counsel ex
pected to shut out argument by Del
mas. If the court allows Delmas to pro
ceed to-morrow defendant's attorneys
will probably want to respond. The
case will go to the Jury some time this
week. _^_

OAKLAND CAN
CONTROL HER
WATER FRONT
The Southern Pacific Cannot Ob
struct the Building of the Mole
for the Proposed New Ferry.
The Recent Decision of the Supreme Court
Removes the Obstacles to Such Im
provements â W. R. Davis on the
Effect of the Judgment.
The Supreme Court of the United States
awards to the public of the State of California
all the navigable waters in the basin in the
estuary in front of Alameda and in front of Oak
land waterward from low-tide line. This gives
public control of every wharf, dock, slip or pier
ever to be used in developing the commerce of
the east side of the bay and the city of Oakland. â
Extract from an Interview with ex-Muyor W. R. Davis.
The Interest that has been created
among the progressive citizens acros3 the
bay, by the announcement of the Realty
Syndicate of their intention to establish
a competitive ferry system between San
Francisco and limeryville, has aroused a
large tribe of the genus obstructor, who
would feel deeply grieved if such an en
terprise should be successfully inaugu
rated.
Aside from their animadversions upon
the financial status of the corporation
that proposes to build this line, they have
a pet "hammer" that is being used in
dustriously on all possible occasions.
This is embodied in the allegation that
a competitive ferry cannot be. established
by reason of the alleged fact that tha
Oakland Water Front Company, other
wise known ;is the Southern Pacific, con
trols the wharf outlets to the bay.
The fact that the recent decision of the
Supreme Court of the United States prac
tically brings to Oakland and Alameda
freedom from the despotism of the Water
Front Company, and has opened up vast
possibilities, has been carefully lost sight
of by a large proportion of the people
over the way, who still believe they are
"bottled up " by Uncle Collls' once deadly
grip upon the water frontage of the mod
ern Athens.
This judgment of the court makes all
euch statements ad to the powers of the
Water Front Company nonsensical and
the sooner the people of Oakland aro con
vinced of the fact the better. Under this
Judgment on a retrial the city Is now
putting i:i evidence to secure still further
advantage over the once despotic corpo
ration by taking more water frontage
away from it in addition to the nine
tenths obtained through the former litiga
tion. The meat of the decision is the
fact th.it it assures public Instead of pri
vate control of the actual shipping front
age of Oakland and the eastern shore of
the bay for all time.
William Ft, Davis, senior counsel for Oak
land in the famous case, referred ytstor
day to the fact that the people or that
City do not roahze the importance of their
victory, and gave a concise resume of the
results of the decision, which will be of
particular interest at this time. He said:
"Horace \V. Carpentier and the Water
Front Company, his successor, claimed
for over forty years title to the Oak
land water front, which, as described in
the ordinances and deeds under which
they claimed, included twelve and a half
square miles of navigable waters and
chore strip up to ordinary- high tide line.
About nine-tenths of this area lay water
ward from ordinary low tide line. That
ancient claim extended under and in
cluded the whole bed of the estuary of
S;u: Antonio, the whole bed of the salt
water basin opposite Ea.st Oakland, and
the triangular area opposite Oakland and i
A!am.Â»dH. Into the bay to the depth of
twenty-five feet of water and along a
'ship channel' frontage seven miles long
In the bay.
"The Supreme Court in the recent de
cision decided that the title to about nine
tenths ot this tv hole area still remained
In the State, as it never had been grant
ed to thf: town of Oakland by the Y^.-giH
lature and therefore could not have been
granted by the town to Curpentier or the
Water Front Company. That conclusion
whs reached by holding that the words
'ship channel' meant low tide line, be
yond which the grant did not extend.
So the Water Front Company obtains
only the narrow, irregular strip common
ly called tide landâ really water lotsâly
ing between ordinary high and low tide
lines. This comprises about one-tenth of I
what was originally claimed by the com- |
pany.

SOLDIERS MATCHED
AGAINST COLLEGIANS
ME2J OF IOWA REGIMENT WILL
GO TO PALO AJLTO.
A Football Game on the Stanford
Campus Which Will Be Well
Attended by Blue Coats.
The campus at Palo Alto will present a
novel sight to-morrow afternoon when
the entire lowa regiment surrounds the
football field to shout for their team in
combat with the Stanford University
eleven. A football game has been ar
ranged between the soldier pig-skin chas
ers and the college men, and it will be
played on the university grounds.
A warm time is expected, as the blue
coats will bÂ« paid off to-day, and they
â¢will follow the team to the theater of
the gridiron warfare. So soon as it was
announced in camp that the lowa foot
ball aggregation intended to cross swords
with the cardinal cohorts the colonel of
the regiment was sought and an oral
petition made in behalf of the men in the
ranks for a day's outinr. The colonel
did not fancy the idea of being separated
from his soldiers for an entire day. but
he finally relented and gave a day's leave
to his regiment.
Special terms have been made \wlth the
Southern Pacific and the volunteers will
leave on an early train in the morning
for Palo Alto. Lunch will be served at
the university dining hall. The game,
which will begin late in the day, will be
the source of much noise on both sides,
especially from the soldier sections. The
Stanford team will be much stronger than
the eleven put in the field by the sol
diers, which, however, will not detract
from the interest of the match. Three
of Stanford's best men are laid on the
shelf â Dole, Wilson and Burmeister, the
latter receiving his injuries in the prac
tice game on Monday evening.
Gustav Walter's Estate.

land as to Its water front? In a most ex
cellent condition. Assuming that no
streets had been extended across this
strip between high and low tide and that
that strip is to be viewed as private prop
erty, there is no difficulty about the city's
condemning and opening as many streets
across this tideland strip as it may need
from time to time. That is the extremest
hardship the city can undergoâ really, no
hardship at all. This would bring traffic
from upland down to lowtide line, beyond
which ali wharves, docks, piers and land
ing places must of necessity be located
and all this frontage at the end of streets
and between them is now adjudged to be
State property, the same as the water
front of bun Francisco, where the State
Is exercising full power.
"Oakland's real water frontage, where
vessels land, is therefore under the abso
lute control of the State and within the
easy reach of the city by projecting Its
streets wherever necessary ' to that ship
ping frontage.
"The condemnation damages will never
be excessive, as they must oe determined
by a Jury of the county, who would
award damages according to the actual
value of the water lots in the strip and
not according to the shipping frontage
which belongs to the State.
"The foregoing supposes the city to be
in the position or having to condemn lands
at the foot of all streets, but *ueh is not
the case. The Supreme Court's decision
decided that wherever streets were opened
to iowtide line on April 1, ISoS (the time of
the compromise) the city still had the
right â¢without compensation or condemna
tion to proceed with the use of all such
streets out to the lino of Stata control,
which is lowtide line.
"There are many such streets," con
tinued Mr. Davis, "and upon the present
retrial of the cause testimony has been
taken for several weeks showing the stat
us and use of all the streets ending at
the estuary and those ending at West
Oakland, on April 1, 1868. The evidence
as to these thoroughfares Is voluminous
and will probably occupy the court an
other month.
"The exact situation, in a few words, I
is this: The Supreme Court awards to
the Water Front Company under the
compromise of I*6S:
"i- irstâ Nothing in tho basin cast of
that branch of the estuary which turns
up into Lake Merritt.
"Secondâ In the bed of the es
tuary of San Antonio except the narrow
strip on its north shore lying between,
ordinary high and low tide.
"Thirdâ Nothing In front of the city of '
Alameda.
"Fourthâ Nothing In the bay westward
from low tide line off West Oakland.
"Fifthâ The water lots or shoals off |
West Oakland to low tide line.
"Sixthâ The Supreme Court of the Unit- I
ed States awards to the public of the !
State of California all the navigable
waters In the basin, In tho estuary, in,
front of Alameda and In front of Oak
land waterward from low tide line. This
gives public control of every wharf, dock,
Blip or pier ever to be used In developing <
the commerce of the east side of the bay
and the city of Oakland.
"So there is plenty of room for build- '
Ing of ferries and all the docking facili
ties required for a great city.
"The hoodoo number 13 evidently had '
something to do with the settlement of
this famous case by which the Btate re- i
covered its property and the city of Oak- I
land gained access to the commerce of i
the Pacific," Bald Mr. Davis, with a ,
laugh. "Carpentler's famous grab of thÂ»
water frontage was made thirteen day.s !
after the incorporation of tho town of i
Oakland. In trying to maintain his hold- !
Ings of the property there were thirteen.
Buits, each of which invalidated the ef
fects of the preceding action. During the
final trial we put in evidence 13 000 000
people annually passed over this water
frontage, and I believe there were thir
teen attorneys and Judges engaged In the ,
wind-up of the action.'
THE FREE MARKET IS

RECOMMENDATIONS.
The Naval Beserve Vessel Marlon Is
to Be Moved Into the Stream
Some Time To-Morrow.
The Harbor Commissioners met yester
day afternoon and decided to order the

stream. Assistant Chief Wharfinger
Scott served the notice last night, and the
warship will be moved some time to-mor
row.
Major Harney made a voluminous re
port on the free market. He recommends
the setting aside of the wharves at the
foot of Market, Clay, Washington and
Jackson streets and the bulkheads. A
superintendent and all the necessary em
ployes are to be appointed, and the mar
ket Is to be in operation next spring.
Commissioner Herrold made a report on
the fire boats and hydrants. He recom
mends that five hydrants Instead of two
be put, and that a fire drill for all the
employes of the new ferry. depot be held
once a month.

Pacific Fruit Canning Company Be
comes Involved in Serious
Trouble With the Chief
Food Inspector.
The establishment of the Pacific Fruit
Canning CÂ«-Â«npany, at 804 Stockton street,
was raided yesterday by Chief Food In
spector Dookery, assisted by Deputies
Davis and Lahaney. About nine tons of
tomatoes ready for canning were seized,
and also 400 quart cans that had been
sealed.
The appearance of the Inspector was a
MUST CLAIM THE PRISONER.
JAMES FLOOD Will Be Released Unless Japan
Demands His Extradition.
IT IS expected that at 9 oclock this morning, James Flood, the mer
chant of Kobe, Japan, who was arrested on the Doric, on her arrival
here last Monday, by the United States Marshal, will be released by
the United States Court on habeas corpus proceedings, unless the
Japanese Government demands his extradition. His attorney, Thomas D.
Riordan, has prepared the necessary papers and will file them on the
opening of the Clerk's office this morning. The arrest was made on the
rather doubtful authority of a cablegram from American Consul Lyons
at Kobe, the charge alleged being "fraud." Marshal Shine was advised
by the State Department at Washington yesterday that Flood could not
be held legally on the authority of an American Consul in Japan, and
that he should be released from custody unless the Japanese Govern
ment requested his detention. The Marshal has been waiting three days
for some word from the Japanese Government, but up to yesterday
afternoon had received no orders. After a consultation between Mar
shal Shine, the prisoner and Mr. Riordan, it was decided to return Mr.
Flood to the Alameda Jail until this morning, in order to allow the Jap
anese Government an opportunity of taking somo action should it so de-
Blre. If the expected communication should not arrive, the defendant
will be brought into court and discharged from custody.
Flood was taken from the Alameda Jail yesterday afternoon and
spent three hours in the Appraiser's building, in the office of Marshal
Shine. He refused to make any statement, beyond the assertion that he
had been guilty of no offense and that he expected to secure his liberty
in a short time.
Mr. Riordan said that the firm of which his client was a member had
failed through mismanagement, but there was nothing criminal in the
matter. It was learned from another source that one of the chief causes
of the failure was the refusal of several Japanese subcontractors to car
ry out their contracts with the firm.
Flood has been in the carpet and matting business in Japan for five
years. He visited San Francisco last July. When he left Japan there
was no charge against him and he left openly and under his true name.
He is a son of Henry S. Flood of this city. His relatives are well-to-do.
surprise and the condition of the can
ning works was found to be most un
savory. Inspector Doekery tells of his
experience an follows:
"We entered the establishment at 11
o'clock yesterday morning and found sev-
enty Chinamen canning: tomatoes in an
Uncleanly manner. They were dumping
boxes of the vegetables into wooden re
ceptacles without sorting, allowing <ie
cayed tomatoes to go in with the rest.
About one-third of the stuff was untlt
for use. The wooden receivers were low
ered Into a vat of hot water to loosen the
skins on the tomatoes and the whole mass
was then given to Chinannn to prepare
for canning. The result was that every
thing went into the cans, or would have
gone if I had not neized the outfit. I
gave orders that henceforth the estab
lishment ahould not handle a consign
ment of tomatoes without sending for
ono of my deputies to watch operations.
If the offense is repeated I will take steps
to close the place.
"This concern has been handling eigh
teen tons of vegetables a day, putting
the same into cans fur various reputable
grocers. The cans do not bear the came
of the canning company, but the individ
ual brands of the customers. These to
matoes are not for cheap lodging-houses,
but for the tables of the people who buy
the best they can get in the way 01 pro
visions. I am determined to put a stop
to such doings in this city. The proprie
tors of the canning works begged the
privilege of selling the 400 cans that bad
been already put up, but I seized the
whole lot."

ADDS A NEW
STEAMER TO
ITS FLEET
Launch of the Ferry-
Boat Berkeley.
IT WAS A GREAT SUCCESS
MISS BTJBY RICHARDS DID THE
CHRISTENING.
Berkeley's Town Trustees Presented
the Vessel With a Hand-
Borne New Set o*
Flags.
The Southern Pacific has at last added
a new steamer to Its fleet of ferry-boats.
It took the corporation a long time to
find out that a n*w boat was required,
but when it did come to the knowledge it
spared no expense on the new vessel. In
consequence the steel ferry-boat Berke
ley that was launched from the Union
Iron Works yesterday was a credit aliko
to builders and owner?.
To show how long the Southern Pacific
has been making up its mind it Is only
necessary to state that the Piedmont, the
youngest of the fleet, wont into commis
sion fif't't-n years ago, and nearly all the
others are old enough to vote. The Ala
meda wm built in 1566, the El Capltan in
IS6B. Oakland in 1575, Newark in 1877, Bay
City in IS7B, Garden City in 1879 and Pied
mont in ISB3.
The launch of the Berkeley took place
at noon yesterday. There were a large
number of invited guests at the Union Iron
Works, and the seawall as far as the
Arctic Oil Works was crowded with peo
ple. The tugboats Rescue, Sea Queen and
Governor Markham were present with
parties of excursionists, and rowboats
and yachts were there in numbers.
The Town Trustees of Berkeley were
present In a body and the new vessel
was christened by Mlgs Ruby Richards,
daughter of the president of the board.
The set of flags presented by the town of
Berkeley were llown from the steamer' .-4
flagpoles. Other decorations were flown
ana the Berkeley presented a very pretty
Appearance a.^ she glidt-d gracefully into
the wtuer. Steam was up in her boilers
and she could have gone into commission
right away had the contractors so de
sired. She will have her trial trip on the
bay in a few days.
The Berkeley has seating capacity for
over 1700 people. On the hurricane deck
1135 people can be accommodated, while
the lower deck will seat 600 more. This {3
as against 1100 or 1200. the seating capaci
ty of the old boats. The entire space on
the main deck is taken up with seats for
passengers, except that portion occupied
by the engine hatches, the stairway to
the lower hold and the two gangways for
vehicles and trucks. The hold of the ves
pel contains the machinery, boilers, quar
ters for the crew, coal bunkers, barroom
and restaurant. The Berkeley is expect
ed to be the fastest boat on the bay, but
Captain Mackenzie says she will have to
travel to beat the San Rafael.
FROM SEA AND SHORE.
The River Steamer F. M. Smith Has
at Last Got Out of Alviso Creek.
The steamer City of Panama got away
for Central American ports yesterday.
Captain Crowell took his Bhotgun along
and Intends keeping a sharp lookout for
the Examiner's pirate. The Umatilla
sailed for Puget Sound ports and the Car
acas for Mexican ports. All three ves
sels took away large cargoes but not a
great many passengers.
The stern wheel steamer F. M. Smith
got out of her bed of mud In Alvlso
Creek and was towed to "Washington
street wharf by the tug Liberty. She
was not damaged a great deal, and will
be In commission again In a few days.
The trade to Suisun by water has
grown wonderfully, and the gasoline
sloop Alta Is now too small for it. "ies
terduy she was hauled off and the
Bchooner Jennie Griffin put on in her
place
The steamer Mary Ellen Galvln has
been moved again. Yesterday she was
moved around to Powell street wharf to
make room for the Aztec. The latter ves
sel is to have new boilers put in and Is
to receive a thorough overhauling.
Captain H. Smith left for Tacoma last
night to take command of the mail steam
er Tacoma. Captain Smith was for
merly master of a British sailing ves
sel Then he was master of the collier
San Benito, and was in charge of her
when she was wrecked near Point Arena.
Latterly he has been mate of the steamer
Bristol. He has a host of friends in San
Francisco, and they are all delighted to
hear of his promotion.
The schooner Abbie M. Deering arived
from Victoria, B. C.Â« yesterday to fit out
for a sealing and otter hunting cruise.
The captain reports plenty of seal in Ber
ing Sea, but the weather too rough to
hunt them.
Mrs. Barry Not Poisoned.
Morgue Chemist Morgan yesterday
completed his chemical analysis of the
stomach of Mrs. Richard Barry, who died
of hemorrhage of the lungs in a lodging
house on Anthony street last week. He

OREGON'S LONG
FIGHT FOR THE
SENATORSHIP
Joseph Simon, the
Victor, in the City.
WAS A TRIUMPH FOR GOLD
HOW THE LEGISLATIVE FIGHT
ENDED IN HIS CHOICE.
He Says the Republican Party cf the
Northern State Is Solid *or
Twenty Years to
Come.
After passing thrr-igh one of the long
est and hardest fought contests ever car
ried to victory In the Oregon Legislature,
Joseph Simon, the new Senator from Ore
gon, is seeking a short rest in this city
whiie he is trying a case before the Fed
eral courtâ for a law case Is rest toward
what has been going on among the north
ern legislators.
The fight brought the office to Simon,
victory to his friend Corbett and defeat to
the supporters of McÃride, the other Sen
ator. Corbett was the original candidate,
and among his most energetic friends was
Senator Simon.
The fight began when Governor Lord
appointed H. W. Corbett United States
S(*iator in default of an election by the
Legislature of 1897. which did not fully or
ganize In time to choose a candidate. Cor
bett's appointment was not accepted by
the Senate, so the election went over un
til the meeting of the Legislature elected
last June In special session called Septem
ber 26. Corbett had a large following, out
the influence of Senator McÃride. through
the Federal contingent, was too strong ior
him, and he lacked ten votes. There was
a deadlock, and then the Republicans
caucused. At the caucus Corbett with-

I drew from the fight, and at once Simon
was nominated. One ballot made him the
unanimous choice of the Republicans, and
at the session of the Legislature next day
he was elected Senator amid great excite
ment.
"It was extremely gratifving 1 to me to
have the election come as v did." said the
victor of this long fight yesterday. "I
received sixty-four out of sixty-six Re
publican votesâ the sixty-fifth being my
own vote, and the sixty-sixth that of an
absentee.
"Mr. Corbett and I have been friends
always and I would not run while he was
in the field, but when he withdrew and
they asked me I could not refuse. It was
the Federal influence wielded by McÃride
which kept Corbett out.
"The outlook for the Republican party
In Oregon never was better. It Is stand
ing solid and will do so for twenty years
to come. Populism Is on its last legs up
there and I do not think it will cut much
of a figure in the future political history
of the State.
"My election is really a triumph for the
gold "standard. It has been an issue right
along in Oregon politics, and I have al
ways been known as an out and out gold
man. The financial^ question has been
mixed up In all the recent campaigns, but
the silver men have met with so many ae
feats that I think the question is prac
tically settled so far as we are concerned.
Oregon is a gold standard State."
Simon has for years been a prominent
figure in Oregon politics. He was born
In Germany In 1851, and went to Oregon
with his parents In 1557. He was educated
In the public schools of Portland, studied
law and in 1572 was admitted to the bar.
since which time he has practiced hlÂ«
profession.
He became a member of the City Coun
cil in 1577, serving three years, being for
a portion of the time president of the
Council and acting Mayor of the city.
As secretary of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee In ISTB he managed the
campaign so successfully that in ISBO he
was made chairman of the committee,
in which capacity he served for six yearn.
He represented Multnomah County In
the State Senate from ISBO to 1891, and
again since in 1893.
He was president of the Senate dur
ing the session of 1889-91 and since 1893
has been repeatedly re-elected to that
fiosltlon, at present acting In that capac
ty He is one of the best presiding offi
cers that body ever had. In 1892 Mr.
Simon was a delegate to the National
Republican Convention in Minneapolis.
He was then elected to represent Ore
gon In the Republican committee. For
eight years Mr. Simon was a member of
the Board of Police Commissioners of
Portland. He was a law partner of the
late Senator Dolph, being a member of
the firm of Dolph, Bellinger, Mallory &
in his trip to this city Senator Simon
Is acompanled by George A. Steel, chair
man of the Republican State Central
Committee, and Graham Glass Jr., its
secretary.
"Go," she said, "and never dare
To speak to me as long as you live!"
He wentâ and that's what the maiden fair
Can never, no never forgive.
