MRS. BOTKIN, CHARGED WITH
MURDER, ASKS FOR JUSTICE

TO PROVE
AN ALIBI
facVey Brings the
Qrewsome Instru=

sassin's Work.
The Local Police Authori
ties Begin the Actual
Investigation.
Legal Proceedings Are Sus
pended for a Week â The Ac- JJ
cused Woman Outlines
Her Plan of Defense
for the First Time.
The tragic story of murder in which
Mrs. Cordelia Botkln Is now the cen
tral figure of interest reached yesterday
a dramatic climax. B. J. McVey of the
State detectives of Delaware reached
the city, and brought with him the
deadly evidence that may lead some
one to the gallows. The local authori
ties began their Investigation and
started on the trail. Mrs. Botkin was
formally charged with murder and
aroused to the terror of her situation
ehe -broke the silence that has sealed
her lips: She appealed to The Call as
a medium through which to proclaim
her .innocence and to demand an im
partial trial from the people of the
State.
In the events of the day Mrs. Botkin's
defense of herself was immeasurably
â¦he most important. The woman ex
plains her motive in maintaining si
lence under the terrible stress of accu
sation. She declared that the humilia
tion* and terror that she suffered when
charged with an awful crime made her j
fear the con?f-quences of speaking. I
â¢ a ail side* she says she did ;
not believe it to be safe to defend her- \
self before the tribunal of public
opinion. "With her name upon the
prison register and a double charge of
murder against her she hastens to pro
claim publicly her Innocence and to ask
the consideration of a fair trial.
In her assertion of ionocence Mrs.
Botkin is explicit. While at first she had
determined to suspend any attempt at
defense until she could be heard in
court, she says she feels now that the
jjublic should know what her friends,
her attorneys and the Chief of Police
already have learned. She declares that
she has made a detailed statement to
the Chief of Police accounting for every
movement and moment of her life for
months past. Her attorneys know fully
the. story of her life and her relations
\\ith the Dunning family.
â¢ Mrs. Botkin denies emphatically that
she ever knew Mrs. John P. Dunning
or had any reason to bear the dead
woman ill-will. She declares that she
knew Dunning and felt for him a
friendship strong enough to aid him in
his- necessity. That she ever wrote any
love letters to Dunning or entertained
for him a feeling stronger than friend
ship she emphatically denies. Unjustly
accused of a horrifying crime she asks
the right erf an impartial trial. The
woman's statement made shortly after
she was charged with murder is un
usually dramatic. When the officers of
the prison asked Mrs. Botkin for her
age and nativity to be entered as items
In the charge of murder she refused to
give the information. She seemed to
fear that even the slightest facts in her
career would be twisted to her disad
vantage, but uprrn the assurance of her
attorneys she did as she was asked.
A few minutes before B. J. McVey, a
detective from Delaware, had reached
police headquarters. He came clothed
in an atmosphere of mystery and was
armed with the evidence that a crime
had been committed. Beyond that he
had nothing except the information
that the people of Dover and of Dela
ware generally are excited to a great
pitch of indignation over the terrible
crime committed in their midst. De
tective McVey says the people of Dela
ware will have no peace until the poi-
Boner is brought to justice. He came
armed with two warrants, each charg
ing Mrs. Botkin with murder. Both
complaints were sworn to by John B.
Pennington before Peter L. Cooper, a
justice of the County of Kent, Dela
ware. These warrants wll not be
served, as copies of them are Included
In the application for extradition which
left Delaware yesterday and will ar
rive in this city before the end of the
â week.
Detective McVey brought with him
the box of poisoned candy that carried
death to Mrs. Dunning and Mrs. Deane.
In the shadow of the crime of which
this box of candy h^d been the instru
â¢ ment it looked grewsome. Chief Lees
handled it gingerly, lifting the cover
and with cautious touch of a penknife
tossing the deadly bonbons. The in
spection, slowly and deliberately made,
had the uncanny aspect of a post
mortem examination of the murderer's
victim. The chief lifted a small hand
kerchief from the table and spread out
the folds of dainty lace. In one corner
was the dealer's price mark â a small,
square, mucilaged bit of paper with the
figures 25 marked upon it. There are
countless thousands of such handker
chiefs in the stores and in the examina
tion, of Mrs. Botkin's effects a similar
one has not been found.
Then the death package itself was

Mrs. Cordelia Botkin Declares She Had Noth

Dunning and Mrs. Deane.
Asks What Should Be Granted to Every Accused Per
son, a Suspension of Opinion Until She
Can Be Heard in Court.
Editor Call: I believe the time has arrived when it is proper for me to speak, anil I tako
this method of request : n^ you to publish in your columns the following statement:
Up to the present timo I have maintained silence by the advice of my husband, who told
me when this awful suspicion was first brought upon me that in my hysterical and terrified con
dition talking could do me
no good, and that any
thing I might say would
undoubtedly be distorted
and misrepresented and
perhaps used to my disad
vantage by the sensational
reporters. Since I have
obtained legal counsel I
have beÂ«n told that this
advice was good. There
fore it has been through
no desire to keep from the
public information of my
defense in this matter that
I have remained silent un
der the most trying cir
cumstances, out because
in the humiliation and
terror of being arrested on
suspicion of having com
mitted an awful crime, I
felt that it was not safe
for me to speak.
Now, however, my
friends, to whom ,, T hft-^>
given a history of my life
for years past, advise me
that I ought to at least
publicly assert my inno
cence. To those who know
me and know that I am
incapable of committing
any such crime as has
been laid at my door, I
need, say nothing. They
will not believe a word
against me. To strangers,
who may think the news
paper reporters have made
out a case against me, I
only ask what should be
granted to every accused
person â a suspension of
opinion until I can be
heard in court.
I am a woman and al
most defenseless. I am
prostrated with grief and
humiliation. I am filled
with horror at the position
in which lam placed. Is It unreasonable tinder these circumstances to ask those who do not know
me to await the hearingP If given an opportunity I shall prove my innocence, for lam innocent
before God.
I have told Chief of Police Lees everything. I have accounted for every moment of my
life for months past I have told one of my attorneys, Senator McGowan, the whole story of my
life. He believes me innocent and says I need have no fear that harm will come to me. I thank
heaven that at least one strong and resolute man is prepared to defend me with all his talent, in
fluence and power. The newspapers, which should always espouse the cause of the innocent, and
the authorities of this city, who should ever sustain the weak and defenseless, seem leagued against
me.
I do not know the wife of John P. Dunning and have no feeling against her. lam not and
never was in love with Mr. Dunning. I befriended him when he was in trouble, and that is all.
My son was very fond of him and both of us believe that he is a true gentleman and that none of
the things he is reported to have told the Delaware officers against me are true.
I am incapable of committing any such crime as this. My relations with Mr. Dunning
were only those of a friend. I never wrote him love letters, nor has he written me such letters.
Chief Lees has all my letters, including those written by my husband for a year pask, and they
contain nothing which shows me in any other than a proper light.
What more can I sayP I deny everything. Can it be possible that lamto be convicted
by the newspapers of a crime of which I am innocent, simply because I was so unfortunate as to
enjoy the acquaintance of John P. Dunning and to help him in his financial troubles P
â¢What possible motive could I have for poisoning his wifeP He has told me that she was a
lovely woman and that he thought more of her than he could tell. I respected him for that. I was
not responsible for his troubles. I only did for him what other friends did for him while he re
sided in San Francisco. I aided him in my weak and humble way to retrieve his fortunes.
I have said ail this, not because I -expect to be believed, for I know that every hand is
raised against a helpless woman ia^ my position, but because I can no longer restrain my emotions.
In due time I know I shall come out of this ordeal unscathed. lam confident that a just God
will not permit an innocent woman to suffer and I have faith in Him.
I have read about innocent persons having been convicted upon circumstantial evi
dence which afterward turned out to be misleading and untrue, and the thought that I may become
a victim of such a thing fills me with horror and dismay. But I shall try to bear up and meet
manfully whatever fate shall have in store for me, conscious in my heart that I am innocent and
that the truth will in the end vindicate me.
Will you please publish this? You have given columns to my persecutors. Please give me
a word in reply.
closely scrutinized. It Is an ordinary
bonbon box, pale pink In color, withythe
Kllded letters, In script, "Bonbons"
across the glazed top. At each end is a
bow of pink silk baby ribbon. The box,
telescopic in make, Is seven and one
half Inches in length, three and three
quarters Inches In width and one and
seven-eighths Inches in depth. It is
the stock box of the confectioner, and
every candy seller in the country uses
It as a model. It offers but faint sug
gestion as a clew. The wrapper in
which it was enclosed is buff colored
and not blue, as the candy dealer of

Stockton suspected it might be. "Writ
ten in duplicate on the wrapper is tho
address, "Mrs. John P. Dunning, Do
ver, Deleware," the name of the State
being misspelled. There are five can
celed stamps, four 5-cent stamps and
one 2-cent stamp. Across the latter is
plainly seen the postmark of San
Francisco.
When the box was opened the allur
ing note of death was seen. "With
love to yourself and baby. Mrs. C,"
it read. It may be the scrap of cvi-
Kby which the poisoner will be
t to the scaffold. The poisoned
candy shows plainly the devilish work
of the assassin. A casual observer
might say that the surface of the
chocolate creams had been broken in
the long journey across the continent
in the mail. A closer examination
shows that the candies had been
drawn out to receive the poison within,
and had then, by a slight pressure,
been contracted to their original size.
In the operation the outer surface had
been broken. The box is still almost
full of candy, showing that the unfor
tunate victims of the assassin had par
taken but sparingly of the deadly
sweetmeats. i
Detective McVey brought also the
bundle of anonymous threatening let
ters that Mrs. Dunning had received.
These were carefully examined and
will be used for purposes of compari
son. In all the evidence brought across
the continent by the detective there is
not a single letter signed by Mrs. Bot
kin or known to have been written by
her. With the examination of the anon
ymous letters the Eastern detective ex
hausted his contribution to the case.
Chief Lees lost no time in having
made a photographic copy of every
scrap of evidence that he had received.
This task engaged the attention of the
Chief, the Eastern detective and an ex
pert the entire afternoon. Specimens of
Mrs. Botkin's known handwriting were
also photographed and will be com
pared with the handwriting received
yesterday from Dover. As soon as pos
sible photographic enlargements of all
the specimens will be made and then
the actual work of investigation will
begin. Notwithstanding the fact that
Mrs. Botkin has been charged with
murder the vital evidence against her,
if any exists, must yet be obtained.
One of the witnesses who believed
that he possessed information of the
greatest moment has become of great
er value to the defense than he is to
the prosecution. This witness who has
carried consternation to Chief of Police
Lees is J. B. Fennessee, who insists
that at quarter to 6 o'clock on the af
ternoon of August 4 he saw a woman
deposit a box in the mail at the ferry
postal station. Fennessee is positive
that he observed the incident. He is
quite as sure of the day and the hour.
He noticed what he believed to be the
woman's uneasiness and he is con
vinced that the box resembled that of a

The Fight for the Life of Mrs. Botkin Is On.
WILL FIGHT FOR MRS. BOTKIN.
The Delaware Authorities Will Make a Hard
Struggle to Take the Accused Prisoner
East for Trial.
DOVER. Del., Aug. 29.â "Mrs. Botkin will be fought for," Attorney
General White said to-day. "I have 1:0 doubt that the requisition will be
granted and Mrs. Botkin w.ll be surrendered for trial in this State.
While we are not demanding a surrenier as a constitutional right, be
cause she was not actually in the i^tate where and when she is alleged
to have committed the crime, nor has she been in the State since, she is
not, therefore, a fugitive in the sense contemplated by the constitution, yet
we do demand the surrender upon the ground of State comity. We pro
pose to place before the Governor of California sufficient evidence in the
way of affidavits of witnesses of this State and by oral testimony in Cali
fornia to convince him of her guilt."
with Acting District Attorney Hosmer
and Postal Inspector Irwin. The legal
phases of the case were again reviewed
and Inspector Irwin was asked to assist
in every way In determining beyond
question the exact time when the box
of candy was mailed.
As expected. Mrs. Botkin did not ap
pear yesterday either In the Police
Court or in the Superior Court. The
habeas corpus proceedings before
Judge Cook were postponed un
til next Tuesday morning to
give time for the arrival of the papers
demanding extradition. For the same
reason the trial before Judge Joachim
sen was continued until Wednesday
morning. For a week at least the legal
battle will be suspended, but in another
field Mrs. Botkin will be fighting for
her life. Her whole career is under
police scrutiny. Her every movement
in association with Dunning is under
investigation, and the events of the
first days of ,this month are being

IN THIS STATE
Mrs. Botkin's AtÂ«brnÂ«ys Are Confi

Not Be Extradited.
Anticipating the defeat of the attempt

ing her with murder and an effort will

l>e made to hold the defendant for trial In
this State. The complaint is drawn un
<ler the provision of section 27 of the
Penal Code.
An attempt was also made yesterday to
correct the errors made wnen Mrs. Bot
kin was arrested. The statute providing
for the extradition of persons accused of
crime says that the magistrate who Is
sues the order for arrest shall specify In
the document a reasonable time which the
defendant may be held pending the ar
rival of the requisition from the Stato
asking for the surrender of the fugitive
from justice. Judge JoachJmsen's war
rant did not contain this specification, but
on the contrary was an ordinary warrant
directing that "said Cordelia Botkin be
produced in his court forthwith." Mrs.
Botkin has not appeared in Judge Joach
imsen's court, although the police contend
that she is in the jurisdiction of the Police
Court. If the attorneys for Mrs. Bot
kin so desired they could demand and se
cure the immediate release of the pris
oner because the proceedings so far have
been decidedly irregular.
FORMALLY CHARGED
WITH THE CRIME
Mrs. Botkin Booked on the Prison
Register on Two Counts for
Murder.
At 10 o'clork yesterday morning two
formal charges oÂ£ murder were entered
In the big book at the Central police sta
tion against the ntoe of Mrs. Cordelia
Botkin. The prisoner was not present at
the desk when Sergeant Martin wrote this
first formal charge against her.
Nor was she present before Police Judge
Joachimsen when the hearing of the case
against her was called, and the great
crowd of morbid idlers that had grÂ«*hered
to see. !e Botkin woman on Â».er first
I public appearance since her arrest dis
appointedly drifted from the chamber*.
AY hen the habeas corpus proceedings
were called at 10 o'clock by Judge Carroll
Cook, Attorney George A. Knight asked
for a continuance of the case until Sep
tember 6. As the basis for his request
Mr. Knight alleged courtesy and an anx
iety that the prosecution should have
ample time in which to perfect its fight
for extradition. Chief Lees acquiesced in
the request of the defense and Judge Cook
granted the continuance. Later Judge
Joachimsen continued the preliminary
hearing to the morning of Wednesday,
September 7, upon the further request or

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Aug. 29.â The
Herald's correspondent at Camp
Thomas, Chickamauga, tele
graphs: A painstaking inquiry
and personal examination of the
â fiokl lead me to the belief that
the many inroads made by death
and disease in the camp can be
traced to four main causes.
Briefly these are: Inadequate
facilities for obtaining whole
some water, an overlong deten
tion of the army in one place,
inexperience of the volunteer of
ficers and their consequent in
ability to fully appreciate the
vital necessity for enforcing san
itary regulations and the inade
quateness of the medical corps

sickness which followed as a
natural sequence of the forego

and since they left there except those
who were killed in battle were mur
dered. They were half-starved and
neglected when they were ill, and the
day is coming when some one will have
to answer for it. For forty-seven days
the soldiers were on a diet of hard tack
and bacon and although many of them
could not eat it because their stomachs
turned against such food, nothing else
was given them, and they were carried
away to the hospital to die.
"For an army of 25,000 men there were
twelve ambulances in Cuba and one of
them broke down. The others did what
service they could, but that was very
IJ-ttle. When a man was taken ill on
the skirmish line or a distance from the
division hospitals he was carried back
tfe the hospitals by a detail of six men
through swam; s and. brush. The sick
man generally died and the six who had
borne him to the hospital were placed
in .the hospital to light the fevers their
half-starved bodies received on the
journey."

MILITARY COMMISSIONERS
WILLJTAKE CONTROL
Plans for the Government of Porto

President McKinley.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 29.â The instruc
tions to the Cuban and Porto Rican Mil
itary Commissions were , drawn up. and
approved by the President before he left
Washington, and are now re^arty to be de
livered to the President of each before he
leaves.
The instructions will not be made pub
lic, but their general terms are known to
be the same as those sent to General
Shafter regarding the government of
Santiago, and to General Merrltt regard
ing the Philippines. This will mean that
the Military Commissions will take con
trol of Cuba and Porto Rico, the same
as the Military Governor controls that
portion of Cuba surrendered to the Uni
ted States after the Santiago campaign.
The many minor details relative to the
evacuation of the islands are left to the
Commissioners, who will report any dif
ficulty or disputed points to Washington.
There has been doubt as to whether or
not the United States would take con
trol of Cuba, but the instructions to the
Cuban Military Commission settle any
question regarding the island, and means
that, for the present at least, the United
States will assume the government and
control of the remainder of the island,
as has been the case at Santiago.

LONDON, Aug. 29.â A special dispatch
from Shanghai says it is stated there that
the Chinese Minister at St. Petersburg
has reported to his Government that, in
his opinion, the Chinese question will pre
cipitate a conflict between Great Britain
and Russia. This state of affairs he
Bays, was brought about by the British
Embassador presenting a note at St.
Petersburg of such a peremptory nature
demanding freedom of enterprise in re
gions where Russian influence is sup
p.isi-d to predominate that Count Mura
vioff cannot accept it. The Chinese Min
ister, indeed, expects that a conflict will
certainly break out before the end of the

MARRIED IN NEW YORK.
Miss Lola Yberri becomes the Bride
of Seymour Fitch.
NETV YORK, Aug. 29.â Miss Lola Yberri,
the dancer, was married at the City Hall
to-day to Seymour Fitch, a lawyer of this
city. The bride is a native of Mexico, but
was educated at a convent in San Fran
cisco, and made her debut as an actress
in that city at the old California Theater.
Later â â -â¢he made a specialty of dancing',
and first came East in 1893 with Thatch
er's Tuxodo Company. She was last seen
on the stage here at Koster & Blal's in
1896. Since then she has been living
abroad. The wedding party at the City
Hall comprised Mrs. J. R. Jarboe and
Mrs. Jerome C. Bull of San Francisco,
friends of the bride, and J. H. Fitch of
Bronxwood Park, brother of the groom,
and wife.
SURGEON DUNCAN IN
CUSTODY OF A SHERIFF
And Now There Is a Prospect of a
Clash Between State and
Federal Authorities.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 29.â Captain L.oui9
C. Duncan, surgeon of the Twenty-second
Kansas Regiment, is held by the Sheriff
of Fairfax County, Virginia, to answer
an indictment charging him with dese
crating Confederate graves at Bull Run,
near Manassas. It appears that Dr. Dun
can, whose case has now become famous,
was not sentenced to five years' impris
onment, as reported from Camp Meade,
Pa., but escaped much more lightly at the
hands of the military court, there being
a lack of evidence to prove that he actu
ally took part in despoiling the graves.
The finding of the court-martial, ap
proved by General Davis, was that Sur
geon Duncan be deprived of his rank for
two months, be confined to the regimental
camp and forfeit half his pay for the
came length of time and that he be repri
manded by the commanding general.
It is understood that when the Sheriff
E resented his warrant for him under the
tate indictment Duncan voluntarily sur
rendered. A clash between the State au
thorities and the War Department may
develop. The case has not been brought
to the attention of Washington as yet.
FAILURE OF HARVESTS
CAUSES GREAT DISTRESS
Prompt Relief Can Only Prevent
Widespread Suffering in Many
Districts of Russia.
ST. PETERSBURG. Aug. 29.â Owing to
the failure of the harvests In seven dis
tricts of the government of Kazan and
in the provinces of Samaria, Saratof, Si
birik, Viatke and Perma, where the crops
are almost worthless, even the landed gen
try are beginning to ask the Government
for relief, and the authorities are adopt
ing measures to aid the sufferers. Tne
distress, however, is becoming more acute
every day. The peasants are denuding
their cottages of thatch In order to feed
their stock, but In spite of all that can be
done, cattle and horses are dying in great
numbers. The Government officials are
very slow in getting the relief measures
into effect, and the only aid thus far has
been the granting of permission to the
Foasants to gather faggots in the woods
or fuel and to collect dried leaves for
fodder. The peasants are exhausted from
lack of food, and unless the promised
suplies are speedily sent the suffering will
bo terrible.

The ocmmittee appointed several days
ago to investigate the charges of ex

Lodge officers and to secure, if necessary,
the name of the informant of a local pa

SLEPT ON THE TRACK.
Intoxicated Youth Horribly Mutilat
ed by a Train Near Acanipo.
LODI, Aug. 29.â A young man's thought
lessness caused his death at Acampo, two
miles north of here, at S:2O last night.
Byloan Denehy. aged 19, was run over by
freight train Xo. 106 and bis body horri
bly mutilated. The remains were found
scattered along the track for over a hun
dred yards. The supposition is that the
victim went to sleep on the rails. The
engineer did not see him until too late
to stop, and the whole train passed over
the body.
Denehy and a young friend visited Lodi
earlier in the evening, and when they
left town both were intoxicated. The
station agent at Acampo tried to per
suade Denehy to go to bed shortly before
he met his awful end. but to no avail.
The deceased was well connected, his
father owning a larg<' mercantile and
warehouse business. The burial took
place to-day ami the inquest will be held
to-morrow, when the train's crew can be
present to testify.
Miners Are Starving.
SKATTI.r, Aus. 2!>.â K. K. Beoston, the
p. neral Inspector of the Hudson Bay
Company, has returned from the North.
He says: "The miners on the Edmonton
route are in a starving condition. That
company's posts will have to help them
out to prevent serious trouble. Prospec
tors on the Ashcroft route arc in just as
bad condition. After reaching the Stick
een River they made a desperate attempt
to get home, almost giving their outfits
away."
FIRST WOMAN ARMY SURGEON
DR. ANiTA NEWCOMB McGEE.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 29.â T0-day, for the first time in the
American army, a woman was appointed a member of the
medical staff. Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee, wife of Profes
sor W. J. McGee of this city, and a daughter of Professor
Simon Newcomb, formerly of the Naval Observatory, was
regularly sworn in as an acting assistant surgeon. This, according to
Secretary Alger's general order, would entitle her to the uniform of
a second lieutenant, without designation of rank. It is not likely,
however, that Dr. McGee will avail herself of this privilege.
The appointment, while a novelty from a technical standpoint, Is
not the beginning of Dr. McGee's service with the War Department.
Throughout the war she has been in charge of the selection of the
women nurses, and of 700 or more now in the field most of them have
passed muster at her hands.
Assistant Surgeon McGee goes to New York to select thirty
graduate nurses for service in Porto Rico. She has regularly prac
ticed her profession in Washington for some years and is well known
in medical circles throughout the country. She contributed several
papers to the American Association for the Advancement of Science
and to other scientific organizations.

RED CROSS WORK
Surgeon-General Makes
Denial.
STATEMENT BY STERNBERG
ANSWERS CHARGES PREFERRED
IN THE PRESS.
Says He Has Been Friendly to the
Relief Association, but Did Not
Desire Woman Nurses
in the Army.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 29.â The fol
lowing statement regarding the medical
corps of the army and the American
National Ked Cross Society was given
out by Surgeon General Sternberg to-
day:
Owing to the pressure of my official
duties I have not heretofore felt Justified
in. taking the time to make an explanation
â with 1 reference to my attitude toward the
American. National Red Cross Society.
It has been repeatedly charged in the
newspapers that I am hostile to this or
ganization and have refused to accept' its
assistance ,in the care ;of our sick â¢ and
wounded soldiers and sailors and that. A3
a result of this refusal there has been un
necessary^ suffering. .Â«-- â¢ -,>.- >?&'*"' â¢_â¢-â â 
.. .These, charges are without : foundation,
. except' in so fax as 'It have objected to
i the sending. of female nurses with troops
in the field engaged in active operations.
We have a Red Cross Hospital Coipa
in the army of enlisted men, whose duty
it is to render assistance to the wounded
upon the field of battle and to i*are for
the sick In our division field hospitals, and
I have been of the opinion that female
nurses would be an lncumbrance to tne
troops during active operations; but so
soon as serious sickness developed in our
camps and it 5 became necessary to treat
typhoid fever In our field hospitals, I
gladly accepted the services of trained fe
male, nurses for the division field hos
pitals. In our general hospitals we have
employed them'Jrom the first. The gen
eral testimony from the surgeons in
charge of these hospitals has been that
their services have been of great value.
Very many of these trained nurses have
been obtained through the kind assist
ance of the Red Gross Society for Main
tenance of Trained Nurses, Auxiliary No.
3, and I desire to express my high appre
ciation of the valuable services rendered
the medical â¢ department of the army by
this organization.
My attitude toward relief organizations
Is shown by an indorsement, dated May 5,
upon a letter addressed by Rev. Henry C.
McCook of Philadelphia to the President
and referred to me for remark:
'"May 5, IS9B.â Respectfully returned to
the adjutant general of the army. The
plan proposed for the organization of a
relief. association, to be well con
sidered, and the object in view will com
mend itself to every patriotic citizen. But
It is a question whether the President
i should give special privileges to any par-
I ticular organization. Other prominent in
| dividuals in different parts of the country
: may be organized for the same purpose.
One such proposition has come from Chi
i cago. While I approve in a general way
of organization for the relief work pro
posed, it appears to .me that it will be
best not to give any one organization ex
clusive privileges. In case of need, as
sistance should be accepted from any or
ganization prepared to give it."
This has been my guiding principle
throughout â relief, when needed,
should be promptly accepted without ref
erence to the source from which it comes.
The relief afforded by the National Red
Cross at Slboney was promptly accepted
by the surgeons on the spot, but it is evi
dent that it was entirely . Inadequate to
meet the emergency.
A committee, of the American National
Red Cross Association called upon me in
my office in Washington some time in
advance of the landing of our troops in
Santiago, making an offer of assistance.
I received them most courteously and
advised them to use their resources in
fitting up a hospital ship, ; telling them
that a hospital, ship was now being-fitted
up for the use of the medical depart
ment, but that it was not at all Improb
able that an emergency would arise which
would overtax our resources, and that. in
such an event a hospital ship, properly
equipped, having on board a : corps of
doctors, and nurses, would be a valuable
auxiliary- 'â â¢â¢â â¢ '. ; ~r-'-'- :.. â¢*â¢â â¢. â¢:â¢.*.-.
Furthermore, the American." National
Red Cross Association has had full au
thority to send agents and Vupplie* to all
our camps since June 9, 18^8, and if ( there
has * been suffering for , want of needed
supplies, they must assume the respon
sibility with the medical department of
the army for such suffering.-
The following letter was sent by me to
every chief â  surgeon of a department or
independent army In the field on June
9, 1898:
"The Secretary of War has approved of
the following -proposition ' made by the
American National Red Cross Associa
tion, and the chief surgeons of army
corps and divisions will co-operate with
the authorized agents of this association
for the purposes indicated:
" 'We can put any desired amount of
hospital suppliesâ ice,- malted milk, con
densed milkâ into any of the volunteer
camps in a few hours. Will you be kind
enough to bring this letter to the atten
tion of Secretary Alger and ask him if
there is any objection to our appointing
a Red Cross representative to ; report . to
the commanding officer and the chief sur
geons in every camp, confer with them as
to their immediate needs, and, if anything
of any kind is wanted, open a Red Cross
station and send in the supplies. We can
do this, not in a few weeks or a few days,
but in a few hours, and can furnish any
quantity of any desired luxury or delicacy
for hospital use. We hereby tender our
aid and put our organization at the War
Department's service for co-operation in
To show my cordial relations with the
National Red Cross Relief Committee. I
venture to quote from a letter of August
11 received by me from Mr. â¢ Cleveland H.
Dodge, chairman ofÂ» the ; supply commit
tee. Mr. Dodge says: ' : ,
"I want again to assure you personally,
on behalf of our committee, of our earnest
desire to assist you in every possible way,
and to thank you for calling upon us so
frankly." Â __

PURSUED FOR YEARS
BY AN UNKNOWN FOE
Three Attempts Made to End the
Life of Murdered Mrs.
Morse's Son.
POIXT ARENA, Aug. 29.â The sons of
Mrs. Morse, the aged victim of an un
known poisoner, have concluded to sell
"their Interests 1 here and locate In San
Francisco. Fearing that his life is in
danger, Le Grand Morse, who narrowly
escaped sharing the fate of his mother,
has determined' to shake the dust of this
town from his feet, hoping that in San
Francisco he will be safe from the enemy
who has pursued him for years, and who,
he thinks, caused the death of his devoted
parent.
Three attempts have already been made
on his life. Who his pursuer is Morse is
at a loss to know. He does not suspect
anybody. Some years ago Morse was in
strumental in sending a criminal to San
Quen.tin. Before being taken to the peni
tentiary the prisoner swore vengeance
against "Morse. . The man was released
about a year ago, and was last heard of
in Oregon. Morse, shortly after the mur
der of his mother, thought the ex-convict
had planned the crime, and so notified, the
detective who is working on the case. In
formation received to-day, however,
shows that he had nothing to do with the
murder, as he went to Oregon immediate
ly after being released fr<T> Ran yuentin
and has been there ever since.
Man) of itae residenta regret that they
did not seize a letter which Mrs. Spauld
ing sent to Texas the day following the
murder of Mrs. Morse. Mrs. Spauldlng
quietly left the house in which she lives
and hurriedly walked to the postoffice.
On the way she dropped two letters â one
addressed to her daughter in El Paso,
Texas, and the other to the Postmaster
of that city. They were picked up by a
citizen, who sent them to the inspector at
San Francisco, asking him in the name of
justice to open them. The inspector opened
the letter addressed to Mrs. Spaulding's
daughter, who is the divorced wife of Le
Grand Morse, but refused to open the one
addressed to the Postmaster. Many per
sons here now believe that in the envelope
which was addressed to the Postmaster
of El Paso was a sealed letter which the
writer asked to be delivered to her daugh
ter.
Le Grand Mnrse to-day made known
the fact that his life is insured for $2000.
his daughter, Georgie. being named as
beneficiary. The policy was taken out
about fourteen years ago, when his j
daughter was a mere girl. Georgie is the
wife of Downs, the blacksmith, whose
name has been prominently mentioned in
connection with the murder of Mrs.
Morse.
"KID" M'PARTLAND
GETS THE DECISION
NEW YORK, Aug. 9.â Kid MePartland
of this city got a well-earned decision
over Jack Daly of "Wilmington, Del., af
ter fighting twenty-five clean rounds be
fore the Greater New York Athletic Club
to-night. The last time these two met
Daly got the decision on a foul in the
seventh round at the Lenox Athletic
Club, and since that time McPartland
has always claimed that he had Daly
whipped then. He insisted that on their
next meeting he would demonstrate his
superiority over the Delaware man, and
he did this very effectively to-night.
Both men were in splendid form and
showed, when they stepped in the ring,
that they had trained carefully. The
bout was devoid of foul work and was one
of the cleanest and cleverest exhibitions
ever given under the Horton law. There
was little to choose between the men at
the end of the go, but as McPartland had
done more leading than his opponent, the
referee's decision in his favor was fair.
Daly's friends lost a lot of money on
the result, and a few bets were made in
the early part of the fight at 2 to 1 on
the Delaware man. At no stage of the
contest were these odds warranted, and
it was evident at the. end of the twelfth
round that the ,fi&ht would go to the
limit. :

"It was this situation which deter

The day he sailed with reinforcements,
â  July 7, he sent the following dispatch

you Jointly agree upon. Matters should
be settled promptly. _
R. A. ALGER, Secretary of War.
"This dispatch recognized &..les as
the commander and gave him authority
to act. Shafter was entirely ignored.
In the face of this situation Secretary
Alger, through General Corbin. sent a
dispatch to General Shafter assuring
him that General Miles did not come to
Cuba to supersede Shafter in any way.
This dispatch General Miles refers to
as 'secret,' for, he says, he did not know
It had been sent, not having been noti
fied from Washington and General
Shafter saying nothing to him about it.
After the surrender General Miles still
retained control. He authorized Shaf
ter to appoint peace commissioners,
and, Judging from Shafter's report, that
all was over, he instructed him as to
the disposition of the troops.
"July 15 General Shafter wired
General Miles that the surrender was
not as complete as was thought,
and said: "Please do not Â£o
away with the reinforcements, as I may
yet need them.' Miles promptly replied
by wire from Balquirt that the sur
render "is complete' and the Spaniards
'must surrender.'
"On July 16 Shafter wired Miles that
the surrender was finally complete.
And General Miles replied through Ad
jutant General Gilmore as follows:
'The commanding general is very
much gratified to hear that the sur
render Is complete. He directs that
you telegraph anything of importance
and the condition of your command
dally.' General Miles then reported
the condition of affairs to the Secre
tary of War, with whom he had been in
conference.
"In one of his telegrams to Miles
Secretary Alger says: 'As soon as
Santiago falls the troops must all be
put in camp as comfortable as they
can be made and remain. I suppose,
until the fever has had its run.'
"Miles urged the return of the army
to the United States as soon as possi
ble. July 17 Shafter wired as follows
to General Miles:
SIBONEY, July 17, 8:48 p. m.
(received July 18). â General Miles,
on board Yale: Letters and orders in
reference to movement in camp re
ceived and will be carried out. No one
is more anxious to get away from
here than myself. It seems from
your orders given me that you re
gard my forces as part of your com
mand. Nothing will give me greater
pleasure than serving under you,
general, and I shall comply with all
your requests and directions, but I
was told by the Secretary that you
were not to supersede me in com
mand here. I will furnish the infor
mation called for as to the condition
of command to Gilmore, adjutant
general, A. H. Q.
SHAFTER, Major General.
"General Miles very promptly replied
as follows:
PLAYA DEL ESTE, Guantanamo,
July 18, 11:30 a. m. â General Shaf
ter: Telegram received. Have no de
sire and nave carefully avoided any
appearance of superseding you.
Your command is a part of the
United States army, which I have
the honor to command, having been
duly assigned thereto, and directed
by the President to go wherever I
thought my presence required, and
give such general directions as I
thought oest concerning military
matters, and especially directed to go
to Santiago for a specific purpose.
You will also notice that the order
of the Secretary of War of July 13
left the matter to my discretion. I
should regret that any event should
cause either yourself or any part of
your command to cease to be a part
of mine. Very truly yours,
NELSON A. MILES,
Major General Commanding United
States Army.
"General Miles .then gave Gen
eral Shafter final instructions and
left hurriedly for Porto Rico, for rea
sons already known to the readers of
the Star. In view of the situation as
revealed by the above telegrams the
following statement contained in the
New York Herald of recent date Is
quoted:
"If my cablegram to Major General
Shafter, informing him that Major Gen
eral Miles was not sent to supersede him
in supreme command of the troops in
the field at Santiaso de Cuba, prevented
the storming of the city on the day of
its surrender and resulted in the saving
lof lives which otherwise would have
been lost In the attack, then 1 am repaid
I for sending It a thousandfold."
This statement was made this after
! noon by Secretary Alger apropos of the
! publication in the Herald of yesterday
â  setting forth the doings of Major Gen
i eral Miles during his brief stay in Cuba.
: The Secretary told me he did not pro
pose to enter into any controversy re
garding the Santiago campaign with
anybody. The results spoke for them
selves, and they were a sufficient justi
fication for the policy which had been
pursued by the War Department in the
conduct of the operations against San
tiago.
"My cablegram to General Shafter,"
he continued, "was simply due to my de
sire to assure him that I intended to
be absolutely fair. Before his departure
from Washington General Mllee and I
talked the matter over, and he started
for Cuba knowing that he was not in
any way to interfere with the operations
which were under the control of General
Shafter. That there could be no doubt
whatever, I cabled to General Shafter in
forming him that General Miles had left
for Cuba with instructions not to in any
manner supersede him as commander of
the troops In the field at Santiago de
Cuba, and, as I have said. If my message
prevented a battle on the morning of the
day the city surrendered then I am re
paid a thousandfold."

AUCKLAND, N. Z., Aug. 29.âMalle
toa Laupepa, King of Samoa, died on
Monday, August 22, of typhoid fever.
The administration of the govern
ment is being supervised by three con
buls, L. W. Osborne, representing the
United States; T. B. Causack-Smlth,
representing England, and F. Rose,
representing Germany, with the Chief
Justice, William Chambers, acting
president of the supervisory committee,
an arrangement that will continue un
til the successor of the deceased King
has been chosen.
Malietoa Laupepa was born about
sixty years ago. He has held office
since 1889, being restored after two
years of exile, by the American, Eng
lish and German consuls, December 10,
1889. Malietoa was one of several chiefs
of clans and could rely only on the
obedience and support of his own peo
ple, the Tumasaga and a part of Savali.
A new pretender to the throne of Sa
moa arose every little while and a fierce
conflict with the tribesmen of Malietoa
would be the result. Last spring the
native followers of Tamasese revolted
and rallied to his support, and the con
dition of affairs became such that the
foreign war vessels were forced to In
terfere.

TACOMA, Aug. 29. â In connection
with the capture of the gunboat Leyte
by Admiral Dewey's fleet a few week's
ago, the Hongkong Daily Press says
there Is another incident not previously
made public.
The Leyte had towed three vessels
down the Pampangas River and along
the coast, with the intention of getting
those on board into Manila or surren
dering them to the Americans.
Rough weather compelled the Leyte
to leave them. She was on her way
to Manila, whither she was going for
assistance, when she was captured.
An American warship was sent to
look for the three vessels, but they
were nowhere to be found. The Insur
gents say they have not seen them and
there Is little doubt that they foundered
during the storm, with 900 souls aboard,
including sixteen priests. All were flee

would capture and massacre them.

OBSTACLES
IN THE WAY
OF THE CZAR
Stumbling Blocks in
Peace's Path.
POWERS COULD NOT AGREE
FRANCE WOULD DEMAND AL
SACE-LORRAINE.
Throughout Europe, However, the
Sentiment of the Proposition
Is Received With Hearty
Good Will.
Bpetfal Dispatch to The Call.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 29.â The
newspapers here declare that the
Czar's manifesto will probably consti
tute a turning point in history. The
Novosti says:
"It stands to reason that the dis
armament question cannot be solved
without a previous removal of the
causes for the armaments. The con
ference must accurately determine the
respective pretentions of the nations
and propose means for a peaceful ar
rangement, and it may come to pass
that at the close of the nineteenth cen
tury a liquidation may be effected of
the international policies which are so
prolific in troubles and dangers.
The Novoe Vremya says: "All true
friends of peace are naturally on the
side of Russia, but it is impossible to
guarantee that some of the western
Cabinets will not raise objections, pro
moted by the fact that the armed
peace which has existed since 18/5 is
the main source of their international
sirengiw.
Sviet says: "If all the powers ac
cept Russia's proposal with the same
earnestness with which it was made
the dawn of the twentieth century will
see the idea of universal peace tri
umphant over that of unrest and
discord."
The Viedomosti expresses the opin
ion that the note of the Czar is essen
tially "an attempt to introduce the ele
ment of trust into international rela
tions," adding: "Whoever believes <n
the creative power of ideas propounded
with conviction and clearness must re
joice tnat the note brings a new and
efficient course into the world s life
and groups anew the participants in
that life."
PARIS, Aug. 29.â The French news
papers generally distrust the practica
bility of the Czar's peace scheme and
clearly indicate that France would
make the restoration of Alsace-Lor
raine a prerequisite to her participa
tion in the conference.
The Temps says: "It is to be hoped
that Europe, like France, will consider
the Czar's proposal in a spirit similar
to that whereby it was inspired. Never
theless, it must not be forgotten that
if France owes it to hÂ«se!f to aid in
such an attempt there ia another por
tion of her moral patrimony which she
cannot abandon without abdicating the
very reason of her existence. France
cannot forget the eloquent words ex
changed between the Czar and the
President regarding the rights of peo
ples and justice. Count Muravieff's cir
cular seems a rejoinder to Mr.
Goschen's speech, whether or not it
was so intended. Therefore it lacks
neither wit nor appropriateness.. How
ever, it would be singularly belittling
the inspiration and meaning of the pro!
posal to see nothing else in it or even
to connect it with a wish to hamper
from the outset the conclusion of an
alliance between the United States and
Great Britain. What will the German
William think of the initiative of
Nicholas? That Prince will hardly con
sent to play second fiddle."
The Libertie remarks: "The gravest
questions which demand solution in
volve France, and the Czar has un
doubtedly considered these complica
tions and has consulted the powers
interested. It is tp be presumed he has
reason to believe his views will ' tri
umph."
The Masotte de France says: "Rus
sia made us go to Kiel, but to-day she
leads us to a conference which will
sanction a readjustment of 1871."
The Journal dcs Debate refers to the
past, "which we cannot forget," as be
ing a "stumbling-block" in the way of
the success of the conference.
The Patrie expresses the opinion that
Great Britain will never renounce her
maritime supremacy.
BERLIN, Aug. 29.â The North Ger
man Gazette, referring to-day to the
Czar's peace conference proposals, re
marks: "Our armaments were never
Intended for selfish ends, but only for
our own protection and for the main
tenance of peace. We are willing to
give a fair trial to another method of
attaining the object at a smarter cost"
The National Zeitung says: "The
Czar and his Ministers have not de
luded themselves with the idea that
they can rid the world of the causes
which for years have been responsible
for the growing armaments. When a
great power, however, addresses such
proposals to others they will be recog
nized everywhere as deserving of the
most serious consideration."
The Vosslsche Zeitung expresses the
opinion that the importance of the note
does not lie in the proposal for a con
ference, but in its conception.
The Post warmly eulogizes the Czar's
motives, which, it adds, "must every
where arouse sympathy."
The Kreuz Zeitung says: "No one
can yet appreciate the real significance
of the note. Its bitter-sweet reception
in France shows it will not meet with
universal approval."
According to the Hamburger Corre
spondentz the note will remain for
ever an imperishable monument to the
fame of Emperor Nicholas. Continu
ing the paper says: "It stands to rea
son that Germany welcomes the pro
posal In the most glad manner and is
prepared to co-operate in the sacred
work."
LONDON, Aug. 29.â General William
Booth of the Salvation Army sent the
following telegram to Emperor Nicho
las this afternoon:
"May it please your Majesty: I have
received with profound thankfulness to
God the news of your Imperial Maj
esty's wise, beneflcient and Christian
like proposal in favor of universal
peace. I cannot refrain from assuring
you of the admiration of the multitudes
of Salvationists in all parts of the
world, whose prayers will ascend to
Almighty God for your Majesty and
for the triumphs of those principles of
peace and righteousness after which
they are ever striving, and which are
moving you to seek the true welfare of
all nations.
"This great act of God's will must
forever add to the honor of your
Majesty's name, reign and country."
WASHINGTON, Aug. 29.â The extra
ordinary circular note directed by the
Russian Foreign Minister to the mem
bers of the diplomatic body at St.
Petersburg has attracted the earnest
attention of the officials here.
It Is believed that the victory

Between the Powers and the Reduction of Armaments.
achieved by the United States in the
late war was a contributing factor in
the preparation of the note. It Is sur
mised that that victory made it clear
at once to the European statesmen that
to maintain the balance of power they
would be obliged to redouble their ex
penditures on account of army and
navy, else they might be outstripped by
the United States. The official mind
looks upon the Russian project for a
general disarmament as Utopian at this
time, and while any statement as to
the attitude of the United States to
ward such a conference as that pro
posed is purely conjectural in advance
of the receipt of the invitation, the im
prespion prevails that our Government
would not care to take any active part
in its deliberations.
BILLS AT THE

The Tivoli Produces "ULignon."
"Fallen Among Thieves" at
Morosco's â Great Acts
at the Orpheum.
The audience at the Baldwin last night
was afforded a dramatic treat In the
presentation of "The Master." by Henry
Miller and the Frohman Company. The
play is a three-act English comedy, with
the lachrymose element predominating,
but enough of the humorous to lighten the
somberness and relieve the painful situa
tions with a good laugh. It is a picture
of that side of life which is usually hid
den behind the portals of the home, il
lustrating to what lengths the deliberate
pigheadedness and injustice the iron will
of a master mind will carry a man. how
he can deceive himself by reiterated dec
larations that he is right and all the rest
of the world fools; how adversity and the
loneliness of an old man can break that
adamantine nature and bring out of the
wreck the sterling qualities so long ma
in" the title role Mr. Miller does some of
his very best work, and ably displays
not only the flinty side of the old master
but gives flitting glimpses of the honest,
well-meaning heart that beats beneath
the proud millionaire's breast. He carries
the difficult role easily and with perfec
tion, showing how such a man as the
master can. because his will is thwarted,
drive son, daughter and wife from home
and bid them stay, banish the servants,
abuse his best friend and counselor, lose
his great fortune and still make a brave
effort to endure the gout and maintain his
indefensible position; how love finally con
quers and the sunny side of the erstwhile
tyrant shines forth for aye. The character
is so cleverly drawn that one cannot re
sist admiring the old fellow, notwith
standing his glaring faults
An admirable feature of the play is the
delightful portrayal of the part of the old
counselor by C. Leslie Allen. Mabel Bert.
a.s the loving, long-suffering wife acted a
trying part very capably, and Margaret
Dale as the willful daughter who marries
the man of her choice, threw a novel
charm into her work. TUe lesser parts
were skillfully handled, the result being
a beautiful picture that one wishes to
sre more than once.
The play Is handsomely mounted. It
will hold the boards this week only.
The Tivoli.
The ever-plraslng "Mignon" was pre
sented at the Tivoli last evening to a
large and highly appreciative audience.
The production ran smoothly, and in
every respect reflected great credit on the
management. AmÂ»ng the principal parts,
Mr Zerni sang Wilhelm Meister with
his usual sincerity. His voice is very flex
ible and sweet and under good control,
but his acting is not calculated to create
enthusiasm, nor is his English accent
captivating. However, his vocal efforts
won him a recall.
Mignon was sung by Mary Linek with
flittering success, her Gipsy song In the
first act evoking continued applause. Her
full rich contralto voice wns in fine tone
and her finished acting rounded out the
nurt in a manner to command admiration.
Anna Ltchter. as Felina, the coquettish
actress was charming and gave a bril
liant "display of her varied talents. Her
clear melodious voice and easy vocaliza
tion 'were greatly admired, and her re
ception showed that she has established
herself as a genuine favorite. Slgnor
Wa'nrell as Lothario, did some pleasing
work but he might improve on his artic
ulation W. H. West and Elvia Crox
were in congenial parts and sang and
a< To-night a double bill, "Cavalleria Rus
ticana" and "Pagliacci," will be present
ed.
The Columbia.
T. Daniel Frawley has produced many
plays in San Francisco of higher class
than "The Rajah," which is on this week
at the Columbia, but few contain a more
dramatic climax than is reached toward
the close of the last act. Although not
teeming with interest, is quite entertain
ing through the first three acts. The
Rajah a character well portrayed by
Frawley, arrives at Wyncott Lodge, '."ft
to him as a legacy by a deceased uncle,
and assumes control, together with the
guardianship of Gladys Wyncott, adopted
daughter of the former proprietor of the
lodge. She is willful, a coquette in fact,
and through a series of dramatic episodes
they form a mutual attachment. Finally
another will Is found bequeathing the es
tate to Gladys.
The Rajah is about to depart to India,
after turning over the estate to its legal
heir, but an escaped convict, whom the
Rajah identified and was about to turn
over the authorities, appeared at the
house bent on murdering the man who
would betray him. The convict Is dis
covered by Gladys. She saves the Rajah's
life, and the latter gives the escaped pris
oner a passport to liberty.
Miss Fanehon Campbell assumes the
character of Gladys and is deserving of
much credit for the manner in which she
delineated it. Others who played their
parts well are Miss Adora Andrews, who
took the character of Emilia Jekyll,
Gladys' best friend. Theodore Roberts,
the convict, Alfred Hickman, clerk or
Emilia Jekyll's father, and L,ouis Payne,
Jekyll's assistant, and echo.
The Alcazar.
"The Butterflies," as its name implies, is
a light and airy comedy, more or less
farcical and well calculated to bring out
the best work of the reorganized Alcazar
stock company in the laugh-creating
line. The love story on which it is based
Is not novel, but it develops situations
that create a great deal of fun. As this
is the sole aim of the autnor and â  the
management and the audience were well
entertained the presentation of "The
Butterflies" may be announced as a suc
cess. One of the features of the new
company that will not be overlooked is
the fact that nearly all the ladies are
blessed with faces fair to see. while the
gentlemen will not be accused of being
homely. All of which is valuable capital.
The people are well cast, fit their parts
well and are certain to win favor with
the patrons of the house.
Among the new members secured by
Mr. Belasco, and who appeared last night
were: Earnest Hastings, Wallace Shaw,
Francis Yale, iwiss Isls Maynard, Miss
Marie Howe, Miss Gretchen Lyons, Miss
Edna Ewen and Miss Marguerite Yost.
Chutes Theater.
The large audience at the Chutes Free
Theater gazed up In the air last evening
and saw a most thrilling, graceful and
daring trapeze performance Dy the three
De Novas. With utmost nonchalance one
of the acrobats swings from a trapeze en
tirely across the /building and into the
hands of another, and makes the return
in an instant. The act, in its way, is us
strong as that of the Hegelmans at the
Orpheum. Conlon and Ryder, acrobatic
comedians, and Dick Mack,, an eccentric
talker, who had a lot of original remarks,
were also new, and made hits. Busch, the
"Golden Vampire," Garden and Hunt, the
musical team, and Arthur Salvini, tenor,
had new numbers to offer, and were as
well received as last wppk. There were
many changes in the moving pictures, and
Cannon, who is in his last days at the
Haight-street grounds, was as great an
object of interest as ever. The big Aus
tralian snake and baby lions are the new
features in the Zoo.
Orpheum.
Five new acts were on at the Orpheum
last night, which, with changes by several
of the holdovers, made an almost entirely
new bill. Of the new people, honors were
djvided between the Pasquajis, operatic
singers, and Charles Alderich, a comic
Juggler, while Sadi, the Russian gymnast,
is one of the best seen on the Orpheum
boards. Charles Baron and his trained
Great Danes do a very funny act, in
which the dogs are dressed to imitate
lions, while their master appears as a
clown liontamer. Charles Case, the mono
loguist, won the appreciation of the whole
house. Barney Fagen, the one-time pop
ular minstrel, assisted by Miss Byron,
appeared in a medley of wit and songs.
Grand Opera House.
The drama, "Fallen Among Thieves,"
was the attraction at the Grand Opera
House last night. It Is one of the usual
vlce-virtue-vlllainy plays, virtue triumph-
Ing: in the end. The principal characters
were sustained by Fred J. Butler, Max
yon Mltzel, Landers Stevens, Jessie Shir
ley and Lorena Atwood. W. R. Dailey
and Leslie Morosco gave touches of light
comedy as an Irishman and Dutchman
throughout the five acts that were highly
appreciated.
Olympia.
The Olympia Music-hall has Trixedo,
the -wonderful contortion dancer, and El
Nido Eddy, the king of the bounding wire,
among its new attractions. These, to
gether with Kelly and Violette, Darrell
and Millar, Maude Rockwell, Anita La
Mont and others, make up an interesting
programme.
FLYING DISTRESS SIGNALS.

MOTHER DIED TO SAVE HER INFANT SON.
Mrs. Isabella A. Finlay Killed by the Carelessness of a
Drunken Driver of a Brewery Wagon.
A BREWERY wagon, driven by a
drunken man, ran over and killed
Mrs. Isabelle A. Finlay at the corner
of Bush and Larkin streets shortly
after 5 o'clock last evening. The woman
was wheeling a baby carriage containing
her year-old son at the time of the acci
dent, and when she saw that a collision
was Inevitable her maternal Instinct
prompted her to attempt to save the
child, and in so doing she was thrown
under the wheels of the wagon and in
jured so seve--ely that she died at the
Receiving Hospital, while the baby es
caped without a scratch.
The husband. Edward Finlay, a stew-
ard at the Pacific Union Club, had
â¢walked downtown with his wife and left
her at the corner of Sutter and Larkin
streets a few moments before the acci
dent. Mrs. Finlay proceeded up Larkin
street on her way to the home of her
friend, Mrs. M. Schultz, residing at 1200
Larkin street, and as she was crossing
Bush street John J. Heier, driving a
wagon for the Chicago Brewery, came
down the hill from Hyde street with his
horses on a trot. The mother, perceiving
the danger, snatched her child Just as the
carriage was struck by the horses. The
dress of the woman was caught by the
wagon pole and she was thrown directly
under the wheels. As the mother fell the
baby rolled gently from her arms to the
str^t, when.- ho lay uninjured.
After the collision Heier looked back,
but without stopping drove directly up
Pine street toward the brewery. He was
followed by J. Corbett, a driver for the
San Francisco Laundry, who overtook
him and learned his name and address.
He informed Officers A. M. Smith and
Rooker of Heier's address and later they
arrested him at his home 1420 Bush street.
He was booked at the City Prison on the
charge of manslaughter.
COMING HOME BY

Request of General Mer

SOON TO BECOME A BENEDICT
CEREMONY WTXL PROBABLY
TAKE PLACE IN CHICAGO.
Major General Otis, the Second in
Command, at Manila, Will
Become Governor
General.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 29.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: "Major General Wesley
Mt-rritt has made the request that he
be ordered home to come by way of
Paris, and this request has been
granted."
This statement was made to me to
day by Secretary Alger. The Secretary
thought General Merritt would be able
to furnish details which would be in
valuable to the Peace Commission, but
General Merritfs objective point is the
Un'ted States, and gossip is that he is
returning home to be married. On his
-v-ay to San Francisco General Merritt
stopped in Chicago to see his fiancee,
and an interesting speculation has
sprung up as to whether the marriage
will take place in Paris or the United
states.
As Secretary Alger explicitly stated
that General Merritt requested to be
ordered to this country, the conclusion
js that the marriage will take place in
Chicago. The members of the Peace
Commission will be able, however,
to take advantage of General Merritt's
counsel, as they will arrive in Paris be
fore October 2, while General Merritt
cannot arrive there before early in that
month.
t-eerÂ»>tary Alger stated that General
Merritt would be succeeded as Military
Governor at Manila by Major General
Otis, who is next in command,
Thero is no intention on the part of
ADVERTISEMENTS.

Soap not only for toil-
et and bath but for
shaving. Pears was
the inventor of shav-
ing stick soap.
Heier was noticeably intoxicated when
taken ,to the prison and admitted that he
had taken a few drinks. His statement of
the affair was considerably mixed, but he
attempted to exonerate himself from all
blame. According to his story the horses
were at a walk, the hind wheels locked by
the brake and Mrs. Finlay ran the baby
carriage between the front and rear
wheels of the wagon. The statement is
contradicted by S. Bowerinan, who wit
nessed the accident and who says the
horses struck the buggy first and then
the woman was dragged under the
wheels.
Mrs. Finlay was picked up by Louis
Schultz and placed on the sidewalk. The
ambulance arrived shortly after the acci
dent, and the doctors at the Receiving
Hospital found the woman In a dying con
dition on her arrival. The body was hor
ribly mangled. The chest was crushed,
ribs broken, skull and jaw fractured and
there were numerous lacerations of the
head and neck. Mr. Finlay was sent for,
and reached the hospital before his wife
died, but she did not regain consciousness.
Henry Van Marie, an employe of the
TiUrlin.' Baths, picked up the baby, and
his wife took charge of the child until the
arrival of Mrs. Schultz, who took him t<>
the hospital. To the matron she stated
that she had cared for the baby at times
when the mother was ill, and expressed
a desire to be allowed to tak* the mother
less child to her home. Sheiwas referred
to the father. Mrs. Hamilton, who had
been a friend of the woman, was
with him, and she also Wished to be given
the earo of the babe. Mr. Finlay said
that Mrs. Hamilton mipht take the boy
and Mrs. Schultz reluctantly gave up her
precious charge. The baby ,ho sooner felt
himself relieved from the protecting arms
of his foster-mother than he began to cry. j
Mrs Hamilton's efforts -to -soothe the i
child were unavailing, and she finally re
turned him to Mrs. Schultz.
A purse which Mrs. Finlay had when
she wns struck by the wagon could not
be found after the accident, and the police
believe it was picked up by some mis
creant in the crowd which collected after
the collision.
the President to relieve Rear Admiral
Dewey from his present responsible
duties at Manila. At the Navy Depart
ment it is announced authoritatively
that no orders have been issued to him
which require him to leave that port.
President McKinley long ago received
a detailed statement of the existing
conditions in the Philippines, related
with the characteristic directness of
Rear Admiral Dewey. As Avas stated
in the Herald at the time, the President
received this report before he decided
upon the personnel of the peace com
mission. In shaping his Philippine
policy, the President was guided mainly
by the comprehensive and able sugges
tions set forth in Rear Admiral Dewey's
statement of the situation. The Rear
Admiral touched upon the territorial
dimensions and race conditions, and
presented to the President such a
graphic picture of the situation that it
needed no verbal explanation. It was
stated at the Navy Department to-day
that Rear Admiral Dewcy is absolute
master of the situation at Manila, and
for the present the administration has
no intention of relleveinpr him.

SAYS THE SENATOR
Davis Would Keep Pace
With the Powers.
MUST HOLD THE GROUND WON
PACIFIC COAST NOW OUR MOST
VULNERABLE POINT.
If Outwitted in the Far East Uncle
Sam Should Prepare to Resist
Aggressions That Have
Humbled China
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 29.â "The Ameri
can people are aglow with patriotic
fervor, and the utmost calmness is
necessary in considering our future
course," said United States Senator
Cushman K. Davis to a World reporter
before leaving the city for his home
to prepare for his journey to Paris as
one of the five commissioners who are
to arrange the final terms of peace be
tween the United States and Spain.
"Events have made us one of the
great powers of the earth," he con
tinued. "Whatever we may have de
sired ourselves heretofore, destiny has
forced upon us responsibilities that we
must recognize and accept. We have
Jome a potent factor in the world's
gress. A greater actual naval and
itary power we are already. We
not strong enough yet, but not an
or must be lost in equipping our
â es to cope with any emergency that
may confront us. Our volunteer army
is as good, If not better, than any force
of the kind in the world, but we can
not rest secure in that thought. We
must have a large regular army ready
at call in the future. We must have
as good a navy as any nation on earth.
jWe have an excellent beginning. Ship
' for ship, we need fear nobody. But
: we must build sh'"Â« with true Ameri
can energy. Nothing must deter us.
We know that we have the men to put
behind the guns."
"How are we likely to be menaced in
, the future?" was asked. .
"Actually, we are not a whit more
exposed to attack as a colonial power
than we have been every hour since
the active advent of steam sea powgr.
The glorious victories of our navy have
brought us new responsibilities, but
the Philippines or the Sandwich Islands
are not more isolated than are parts
of our Pacific Coast. Hereafter our
power must be felt on the Pacific
Ocean. The mere addition of a few
hundred square miles of territory by
capture or treaty does not increase our
danger.
"China Is the coveted part of the
earth's surface to-day, but who could
have predicted six months ago that
Russia, Germany or Japan would not
have coveted a foothold on the North
American continent? Now we see the
trend of events in the east- Providence
has stepped in to point the future
course for us. We must police the Pa
cific Ocean. Its coast has been our
vulnerable point.
"You understand, I am on record as
favoring the retention of the territory
I which has been acquired by the splen
did victories of our arms. I am an
American citizen, speaking as such, and
my remarks have nothing to do with of
i ficial duties that I shall undertake in
! October as a Commissioner to the con
grem> of Paris.
"What that body will or will not do,
I would not predict if I could. lam
talking of the situation as it exists to
: day and as every American citizen can
I see it. The interests of the United
! States must be jealously guarded from
this hour onward. We have been re
! miss and indifferent in the past.
"But we have risen to a new plane â
to the level that we were really intend
ed to hold all along. Nothing but the
indifference of our statesmen has pre
vented the United States from occupy
ing the place to which it belonged.
"Japan's triumph over China was
robbed of most of its value to the vic
| torious nation by the intervention of a
stronger power. Are we to be weak
like Japan? Can we contemplate for
an instant the interference of any
power that shall abridge the majesty
and glory laid at our feet by the incom
parable Dewey? I say 'Never.' There-
I fore, you may quote me just as strong
ly as you can as Baying: 'More battle
ships, and after that, more cruisers and
battleships again. The men will step
forward as fast as we can build the
I ships.'
"The Asiatic situation Is one that
deeply concerns us. If we are outwitted
there we must at once prepare for the
| defense of our Western coast line from
i the same aggressions that have hum
| bled the oldest empire on earth in the
eyes of modern civilization."
GIFT FOR THE FATHER
OF FIRST SAILOR KILLED
John Meek Receives a Check Prom
Charge d' Affaires Quesada of
the Cuban Republic.
FREMONT, Ohi.o. Aug. 29.â John Meek
of this county, father of George B. Meek,
who was killed on the torpedo boat Win
slow at Cardenas. May 11, has received a
letter and a check for $100. The letter
goes to show that young Meek was the
first American-born sailor killed in the
Cuban war. The letter received by Mr.
Meek reads as follows:
"WASHINGTON, A.ug. 24.â John Meek
Esq. â Dear Sir: Some months ago a Cu
ban gentleman, who signs himself Cam
bresis, from the City of Mexico, sent Gen
eral Tomas Estrada Palma of New York
an order for $100, to be given to the wife,
children or parents of the first American
born sailor who should die in the war to
free Cuba. I have Just now been in
formed that your son, George B. Meek,
fireman of the first class, on board the
torpedo boat Wlnslow, was the first hero
to shed his blood for the independence of
our unfortunate and down-trodden people.
I beg to inclose to you the check in
trusted to my care, a proof of the grati
tude of the Cubans to their friends and
allies, the Americans. Please acknowl
edge the receipt of the same in duplicate.
Yours very respectfully,
"GONZALO DE QUESADA,
"Charge d'Affalres of the Republic of
The check is dated May 17 and is drawn
on the Bank of America to the order of
Thomas Estrada Palma and is sglned
Maltland, Coppell & Co. On the reverse
side of it is indorsed:
"Pay to the order of Gnnealo de Ques

Meek has not as yet had the check
cashed and has already been offered much
more than its face value by parties who
want it as a souvenir of the war.

FRESNO EXPOSITOR

May Not Be Published
To- Day.
FINANCIAL STUMBLING BLOCK
BACK SALARIES OWING TO THE
EMPLOYES.
To Insure Payment of the Men, All
Outstanding Debts Are Trans
ferred to Circulation
Agent Danke,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Aug. 29.â The Expositor
Publishing Company this afternoon
held a meeting and assigned all out
standing debta to P. B. Danke, circu
lation agent of the Expositor. The as
signment includes both advertising and
circulation accounts and it is made to
Danke as trustee. The object of the
transfer of outstanding debts is to pay
back salaries of employes, which in
clude everybody connected with the
paper from carriers to editor-in-chief.
Mr. Danke, in speaking of the action
of the directors, said that he desired it
understood that all money would be
paid those who had been employed on
the paper. There is due the employes
about $1000, and if collections will not
amount to that sum the money will be
prorated among the employes accord
ing to the amount of indebtedness to
each.
The directors, by their action, have
not relinquished their control of the
paper and do not propose to do so. A.
B. Butler, the real owner of the estab
lishment, holds a mortgage on the plant
for $17,000, but to regain actual posses
sion will be compelled to bring regular
proceedings in court to foreclose the
mortgage, which will take some time.
Whether the paper will be published In
the meantime is a question. One of the
directors, when asked about it, replied
that he was not a prophet, but he
doubted very seriously whether the
paper would appear to-morrow.
The employes, however, have been
told to appear as usual in the morning,
and it is whispered that something is
going to happen. Just what that some
thing is no one seems to know.
General Sheehan hus been in Fresno
for several days and has been looking
over the field with a view to taking
hold of the paper, it is understood.
But as the g-eneral is a Republican he
would find his position a rather anoma
lous one.

PAX JOSE. Aug. 29.-"Rah, rah, rah!
Rah, rah, rah. Santa Clara! Santa
a!" .
This yell of the San Jose High School
nts sounded through the streets this
morning, and people realized that the
fight to abolish politics In the San Jose
School Department was on in earnest. The
voices of about 100 boys and girls joined
!:. this cry, and people along the sidewalks
I their hats and 'kerchiefs and
â I the pupils.
Nev< r before has such a strenuous pro
t n entered against the high-handed
r in which the city Board of Edu
. has mixed politics with school af-
Tbls reluike given the trustees by
the High School students will be produe
: lasting good. The students" parents
have been amused, and a battle to the
finish with the Rea gang has been com
!. The support given the students
by the people is a direct slap in the face
to Bo;-> Rea and his methods of conduct
ing Ihe schools.
The history of the San Jose High School
,i long one. For the past two
or thn - :iere have been petty jeal

Led in a genoral dislike for Professor
Leigh R. Smith, vice-principal of the
!. and about the only one In that in

. The ether tf-achers held diplomas

.i school diplomas. Affairs .went
worse, and in May last the

was <l great favorite, and at a
student body they resolved

O'Brien and Kc-nyon- then promised the

iked out that the Trustees were not
Ith with the pupils, and a mass
: . ;;iz us was neld to protest
against the removal of Professor Smith.
Citizens and organizations took up the
petitioned the Trustees to
. Professor Smith in the school but
without avail, and Charles B. Gleason
: to Smith's position.
This settled it, and the students became
â â  than ever in their resolve to quit
hool. The action of the school board
denounced from the pulpits of tne
city and charges of immoralltv were made
nst members of the faculty.
Professor Smith was elected principal of
- mta Â«'!:tr.a High School, and ar
ments were made by the students to
i that school. That the strike^ is a
hest evidenced by the fact tnat
STRIDING PUPILS OF THE SAN JOSE HIGH SCHOOL STARTING FOR THE SANTO
CLARA INSTITUTION.
1.00 pupils from the city and Its suburbs
Will .attend th;it Bchool.
The Interest of the entire city was cen
ta this morning's events and when
the time came for the pupils to leave for
Santa Clara there was a large crowd in
front of Turn Verein Hal!. The pupils be
x-.n gathering at about 8 o'clock and at 9
fully 100 were present to go to Santa
.Clara. About >.ie same number whose
parents oblige them to go to the local
school fame round and cheered the stu
dents and told them they were with them
in the movement, but for obvious reasons
could not K<i to Santa Clara. Tho parents
>jf some were dependent upon the gang
pport and dared not let their children
go. and other students said they would po
mta Clara after the election. One
young lady said her father compelled her
to the San Jnse school, but she was
E"intf to play '"hookey^ to-day in order to
give hf-r old' schoolmates a good send-off.
I tie students at Turn Verein Hall pre
si nted bappy countenances and they were
as fine and bright looking a lot of boys
and girls as could bÂ« seen in the State.
Tl â â >â¢ were enthusiastic, too, for they had
the best wishes of the entire community.
At 9 o'clock the students were called
together by Arthur Fruhling, their leader,
who addresssed them. He said the pupils
were lighting for a principle and would
Stick to it to the last. It was not because
of Professor Smith's dismissal they left
the school so much as because of the
principle Involved. There were evil influ
ences in the school and these were nurt
! Ing the institution. He said that at least
one-half the students were with them
! and he knew the entire community was.
! Students were cautioned to act like ladies
and gentlemen and thus make records at
their new school that would attract atten
tion to them.
The students then took seats In the
three large carryalls provided for them.
In these vehicles were eighty-two boys
I and girls, while twenty more accompa
nied them on wheels. The people gathered
about gave three cheers for the students.
I The carryalls made a tour of the business
! streets, the students giving their yells at
intervals. In front of Boss Rea's office
and the Mercury office these cries were
given with renewed vigor. People turned
out of stores and dwellings and wished
the students godspeed in the fight for
right.
About half an hour was pleasantly
passed in the ride to Santa Clara. The
I school song and yell were given over and
over. The quiet little town of Santa Clara
was awakened by this lively crowd and
j an enthusiastic welcome given the stu
| dents. At the High School were found
about twenty-five pupils from the suburbs
who had preceded them.
Fully a hundred residents of Santa
Clara 'had gathered at their school to wel
come the pupils from this city. The stu
dents piled out of the carryalls and
stormed the school. They were quickly
assigned to their rooms by Professor
Smith and in a half-hour all were seated
and there was no apparent sign of the
previous rush.
A count showed over 160 pupils in at
tendance against 63 for the last month of
the term of last year. Of the 160 fully 120
were former pupils of the San Jose school,
and it is expected that within a month the
number will reach 190. A number of the
students were absent to-day, and many
are working In the fruit orchards to se
cure money with which to pay their
transportation to Santa Clara and tuition
at the school.
At the High School in this city the
scene was in marked contrast to that at
Santa Clara. Here there was no joyful
ness, and students and teachers went
about in a sullen mood. Principal Shu
mate said 210 pupils had registered, of
which 96 were new pupils. The enrollment
last term was 341. In the senior class only
34 pupils reported. This is just oi.e-half
the number in the same* class last year.
Other classes show nearly the same ratio
of falling off. The enrollment of the other
classes are: Third year, 32: second year.
22; first year 24. Last year the average
number of pupils to a teacher was 50. but
this year it will not exceed 30. Principal
Shumate claims that the number of pu
pils will be increased. Knowing ones deny
this. and claim that young people only
visiting in this city were inducted to go to
the school and register as pupils to-day
to increase the attendance.
Business men view this exodus of
pupils to Santa Clara with alarm. It
means the loss of many thousands of dol
lars yearly. Formerly many families,
came here to live so that their children'
could attend the High School, but now
these have removed to Santa Clara. The
tuition paid to the local High School by
non-resident pupils amounted to nearly
$3000 last year. This amount will now go
to Santa Clara, as will probably the
trade of these students' families. Now
that the students are in earnest In this
strike, the business men are also loud
in denouncing "Boss" Rea and the City
Board of Education.
The gang has adopted every means pos
sible to checkmate the students In this
affair. The scholars have been called
into Rea's office and coaxed and threat
ened. Injunction proceedings have been
brought against the Santa Clara trustees
to impede them in furnishing the school,
and now City Superintendent Russell is
about to aid the gang in its work. Rus
sell has discovered in the school law that
there Is some section that prohibits pu
pils attending school in another district
without obtaining permission from the
trustees in the district previously at
tended. He has proposed to the trustees
that injunction proceedings be com
menced to compel the students to attend
the local school.
[ The people of Santa Clara are rejoiced
over the addition of now students to their
High School. David Henderson, presi
dent of the school board, said to-day that
the gang: had tried In every way to hin
der the school. The trustees did not fear
the injunction proceedings begun last
week to enjoin them from using certain
school funds to Improve the buildings.
He said that Rea was at the bottom of
the suit. No money had been Illegally
used, and District Attorney Herinpton
and City Attorney Beasley of San Jose
had a few months ago rendered such an
opinion.
Another trustee said Rea was so thor
oughly disliked in Santa Clara that
should he put In an appearance there
he would probably be run out.
This strike of the students Is a novel
one. and shows what politics will do to
wreck a school. Efficiency is no longer
regarded in the selection of teachers In
the city schools, and those with the larg
est political pulls are giv^n the best
places. Professor Smith's dismissal was
purely for political reasons. A day or
two before the charter election last
spring Smith in addressing his class on
municipal governments statr-d that one
man power was the ruination of cities,
This was contorted as an address against
the gang, and this was the prime cause
of his dismissal. The gang then had the
Battlefield Veterans, a political organ
ization that does Rea's dirty work, peti
tion the school board for a dismissal of
Smith on the ground that he was un
patriotic. They claimed he had stated
that "Grant would have dl^d a poor tan
ner if it had not been for the civil war,"
and they interpreted this as casting slurs
upon the great general. This was merely
done to divert attention from the real
cause, which was that he had uncon
sciously given the gang a hard rap in
teaching his class the evils of one-man
power in city affairs.
Tom Rea, a son of "Boss" Roa, did not
attend the local High School to-day.
Much speculation is indulged in as to
whether he intends to stay at home or
go to the Santa Clara school.

prayer and devotion. Delegates from all
parts of California, Xevada and Arizona,
the States representing the Pacific Juris
diction of the Young Men's Institute,
were present and offered their homage to
God before commencing the duties of the
convention for which they nave or
ganized.
Of all the delegates present there can
not be noted onÂ« who has not his pet
scheme for the future distinction and edi
fication of the particular district which
he represents. From the opening of the
session, which was held immediately after
mass, the inference can be deducted that
the contest for the supreme honors and
ruling power for the coming year is dcs-
tined to be a hard-fought one. Although
little or nothing was done to-day beyond
organization, to-morrow will bring many
surprises to those who are directly in
terested in the appointment of the ruling
body of tne Institute.
The prevailing topic of argument cen
ters in the election of the new grand pres
ident. Rumor has It that J. J. Gildea is
the man, but this is denied by numerous
delegates, who aver that his hope is a
forlorn one and that another man is des
tined to win the position.
The convention was opened with the
cfl'-brntlon of solemn high mass at St.
Joseph's Catholic Church, immediately
opposite the headquarters of the Institute
on Market street. Promptly at 10:lo
o'clock the entire membership of the In
stitute at San Jose, together with the del
egates from all over the State, met in the

ident Hasklns. marched to the church op

sacred ed'tflee to offer up mass and prayer
before formally opening the annual con
vention.
The church, in honor of the occasion,
was beautifully and appropriately deco
ratea with banners of the Young Men's
Institute and American flags. The sanc
tuary was adorned with ferns, cande
labra and myriads of flickering lights, in
terspersed between which were Bermuda
lilies, and, in fact nearly all of the char
acteristic floral wealth of the Garden
Mass was begun at 10:30 o'clock and was
attended, in addition to the delegates to
the convention, who occupied the central
portion of the church, by a large congre

of the mass, being assisted by Fathers

munity, as deacon and sub-deacon. Spe

THE CZAR'S ENCYCLICAL.
NICHOLAS, the Czar and autocrat of all the
Russias, has met the reports of impending war
between his empire and any other nation by an
encyclical note addressed to the powers of Europe re
questing them to meet with his representatives in con
ference for the purpose of providing a way for the
maintenance of peace and the disbandment of the
large armies and fleets which now entail such a heavy
burden upon the people of all European countries.
The proposition was so startling that the first com
ments on it were hardly more than gasps of surprise.
A London critic calls it a dramatic stroke and says
its effect coming from the Czar was almost as great
as it it had come from the Kaiser at Jerusalem. In
Berlin it was said that the note would make a good
subject for discussion during the dull season. In
Paris they wondered how the Czar could propose dis
armament without first consulting France. In neither
of the three great capitals of Western Europe does
it appear that the proposal is regarded as at all prac
ticable. Everywhere it has been met with a cynical
incredulity and a criticism verging upon ridicule.
There are ample reasons for believing, however,
that the Czar is quite serious and that he will make a
really earnest and vigorous effort to arrange for peace
with the other European powers that will last at
least for the rest of this generation. He has nothing
to gain and much to lose by the outbreak of hostili
ties, and the cost of maintaining his army and navy
in readiness for war is a heavy burden indeed upon a
people so poor as those of his empire.
The ambitions of his Ministers, moreover, at this
time are not directed toward wars and military con
quests. They are now constructing a railway across the
vast Asiatic continent and are planning a canal from
the Baltic to the Black Sea. These enterprises entail
large expenditures, and his financiers would gladly be
relieved from the necessity of providing money not
only for them, but for an army and a navy besides.
It is furthermore to be remembered that the estab
lishment of the proposed peace would not in any way
check the advance of Russia in Asia nor prevent the
expansion of her empire. Now that she has obtained
from China control of a port on the Pacific that is
open all the year round she can afford to move slowly
and trust to diplomacy, colonization and commerce
to win for her all that she wishes in that part of the
world. As for the long desired extension southward
toward Constantinople, that is a matter that can wait.
In the meantime diplomacy can do much in that di
rection also and virtually make Turkey a dependency
of Russia.
The proposal of the Czar is therefore one well cal
culated to promote the interests of his empire. There
is no reason why he should not urge it with all his
force and influence. It is one that appeals to the
sympathies of good men, to the desires of the peas
antry of all countries to be relieved from heavy taxes
and military duties, to the interests of industry and
that great commercial class which has now become so
powerful in the world and finally it must appeal also
to the wisdom of statesmen who have been long
struggling with the complexities of the existing sit
uation. The coming conference, therefore, is likely
to be an important one. It has been met at first with
cynicism and ridicule, but it will be treated seriously
before long.
According to W. H. H. Hart, to himself is due the
fact that the President favors the retention of the
Philippines. Mr. Hart will be remembered as the
gentleman who glided into office on the strength of
having rallied a panic-stricken army by an heroic rata-
plan, and with his little drum leading them on to vie-
tory. The trifling circumstance that Hart had not
been on the scene was not permitted to interfere.
However, he may have converted the President. At
least there is no proof that he didn't.
â¢ Police Judges sometimes seem to get an idea that
they are collection agents and have a right to employ
criminal law for the expedition of civil business.
It is hardly necessary to state that they are mistaken
in this, and that when they strike a man with the
nerve to demonstrate the absurdity of their position
they will be brought up with a turn so sudden that it
will make their heads swim.
The doctor of a Kansas regiment has been sen
tenced to five years' imprisonment for having dese
crated the grave of a Confederate officer on the field
of Bull Run. The sentence does not at first glance
seem severe enough, but it must be considered that
the doctor will have to go back to Kansas to serve it.
Self-defense as an excuse for shooting an unarmed
man of 80 strikes the unbiased as being rather a weak
plea. However, it seems to be the best Cornelius Sul
livan can advance, and we have no disposition to in
terfere with the tribunals in which the administration
of justice is both an art and a profession.
An old-time bicycle champion was recently de
feated by a new racer, and the crowd hissed the loser.
It was an Eastern crowd, a fact which knocks the
spots out of the theory that civilization along the
Atlantic border is of a superior type.
A WORD WITH DEMOCRATS.
IT is evident that all the political fusions of this year,
made by the Bryan leaders in control of the Dem
ocratic party, are made to secure a show of strength
that will lead to Bryan's nomination in 1900 as a sort
of forlorn but star-spangled hope.
The New York Democracy has chafed under the
conditions of 1896. It elected last year a Cleveland
Democrat to the Court of Appeals and another Mayor
of New York City.
This is regarded as high and mighty treason by the
Bryan leaders, who now serve notice on the Knicker
bockers that they must this year indorse the Chicago
platform and dance the whole silver figure or take the
consequences.
It is interesting to note the paths into which fusion
is leading these people who follow a name and
tremble in the presence of "regularity" in conventions
and tickets.
In every fusion made this year the party commits
itself to an issue of irredeemable paper currency. In
California the strongest party in the fusion trinity is
undoubtedly the Populist. Take away from the Dem
ocratic ticket the gold or national Democrats, who
accept the Indianapolis platform as expressive of the
true faith, and the others who don't believe in fusion,
and the Popuiists outnumber both the Democrats and
silver Republicans. They were first in the field to
nominate Judge Maguire, and he has signed and ap
proved their platform, and declares that it is identical
with the Democratic platform.
That platform demands free silver at a ratio of 16 to
i, but it also, in more decisive tones, demands that the
Government issue irredeemable paper currency in un
limited volume and arrange for equitably distributing
the same among the people. Every man who votes
the fusion ticket votes for this paper issue. In the
stress and emergency of the Civil War the Republican
party was driven into the issue of the greenback paper
currency. The Government agreed to make that cur
rency good by converting it into money. But this
promise to redeem it did not prevent its fluctuation,
and the Democrats never tired of attacking it and the
party that was responsible for it. We suppose that the
party now will take strictly Democratic testimony as
to the effect of that paper currency upon labor and
tiade.
In 1864 there were two organs of Democratic
opinion in the country which never struck their flags
and held out to the end. One of these was "The Old
Guard," edited in New York by C. Chauncey Burr
and Thomas Dunn English. That magazine dictated
Democratic opinion. It said in 1864: "The issue of
any kind of paper promise to circulate as money is a
fraud upon the producer, because the tendency is to
give him less of moneys worth than he would get if
paid in specie. It is also a cheat to rob the working
man of the proceeds of his daily labor. This is un
doubtedly the effect of the paper system; but its first
effect is to cause an appearance of prosperity, which
lasts a little while, until revulsion ensues."
There being then $600,000,000 of paper circulation,
"The Old Guard" said: "This is a pretty abundant
currency, and the fact that it is so is manifest every
day in its depreciation. For instance, in Canada flour
is $4 25 per barrel in coin. Ten miles south of the
Canada line the same flour is $6 75 per barrel in paper.
The consumer is robbed of $2 50 by the depreciation
of the paper, showing its superabundance. The Gov
ernment is jeopardized by the infamous schemers who
seek through paper money to destroy not only the
Union, but what remains of popular rights, even the
right to live by labor."
If these were the direful effects of issuing a re
deemable paper currency, we leave it to the Demo
crats of to-day to say what will follow the issue of
irredeemable paper demanded by their candidate for
Governor.
"The Old Guard" continued its discussion of paper
currency, saying: "High wages do not long delude
the poor man, for he finds them to be very low wages
when he goes into the market to buy the necessaries
of life. He discovers that his paper abolition dollar
buys less than 37 per cent of what old-fashioned Dem
ocratic money used to. There is an average increase
of 45 per cent in the price of everything the poor man
must buy with the money he receives for his labor,
while the nominal increase in the price of labor is less
that 10 per cent, which leaves the workingman poorer
by 35 per cent. And prices are still going up, while
the value of the Republican currency is running
down. Let this policy continue three years longer
and the poor of this country will be brought to the
door of starvation."
In all that there was the element of a general truth.
The price of everything except labor, in an inflated
but redeemable paper currency, did rise as the cur
rency fell. The Republican party, mindful of the con
ditions that were created in the emergencies of war,
immediately prepared to redeem its promise of con
verting greenbacks into money, and made them worth
their face in gold.
But, we ask every reasonable Democrat if redeem
able paper currency brought the industrial disasters
of which they complained in 1864, what will be the
effect of the irredeemable currency which they are
supporting in their fusions of 1898?
CUBfTS PECULIAR PATRIOTS.
IF Dr. Castillo is a sample Cuban patriot the island
will be in a bad way after it has really fallen into
the hands of the natives. Yankees have been
termed "pigs," but if the appellation is deserved, what
shall the Castillos be called? This chap is in Wash
ington with a claim for $.15,000 for the destruction of
cocoanut trees near Siboney. He is not willing to
take his pay in the boon of liberty; he is after the
cash, and deserves not to get it.
Castillo does not state the manner in which his trees
were destroyed. Perhaps the boys in shinning them
for nuts barked them fatally. Possibly the trunks
were needed for the construction of roads. It may be
they were scorched to death when necessity arose for
burning Siboney to destroy the yellow fever germs
lurking there. But whatever the precise circum
stances, Castillo has not a good case. If it were a
first-class case his grandchildren might collect, but
there is no utility in Castillo's monkeying around
with his claim.
Americans did not go to Cuba with the idea of de
stroying anything but Spanish rule. That they suc
ceeded in this more than offsets the incidental dam
age. Castillo did not draw a sword himself, nor, in
deed, draw more than regular rations. So long as
he preserved a whole skin and a full stomach he ought
to be satisfied. It's a measley sort of patriot who is
willing to have an alien nation do his fighting and fur
nish his grub, and is not willing to donate to the
cause a few trees. Probably the trees were not worth
the sum mentioned, but if Castillo pins his faith to the
cocoanut as a source of income, his best scheme is
to go back to Cuba and plant some more.
This Castillo is a brother of the general who
imagines himself rightful Governor of Santiago, and
who is likely to have his material system materially
jarred unless he lay aside his pretensions. The first
the Castillo family knows it will be in disfavor.
While Dewey is calling for more ships there can
hardly be an absolute certainty that Merritt may not
call for some more men.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., TUESDAY, AUGUST 30, 1898.
THE LEGISLATIVE TICKET.
I I ARDLY less important to California Republi-
I I cans in this campaign than the selection of
* * strong candidates for State offices is that of
putting forward in every county a strong legislative
ticket. The issues involved in the control of the
coming Legislature are far reaching and are likely to
affect national as well as State politics.
There are at present eighty-nine members of the
United States Senate, Oregon being one Senator
short, and of these forty-four are Republicans. The
recent victory in Oregon assures that the vacancy in
the Senatorial representation from that State will be
filled by a Republican, and a Republican has also been
chosen to succeed Senator Gorman of Maryland. If
no other changes occur the party will have just a bare
majority in the Senate When the next Congress as
sembles, and that margin of superiority will hardly be
sufficient for the important legislation that is ex
pected to be undertaken. It is clear, therefore, that in
order to advance the adoption of the great national
policies of the Republican party witli regard to the
currency, the promotion of American shipping ami
other hardly less important matters, the Republicans
of California should make an earnest effort to send a
Republican to the Senate to succeed Senator White.
In addition to the national issues which may be de
pendent upon the vote of the Senator to be elected at
Sacramento this winter, there are a host of local
questions which render it imperative that the Re
publicans should have a strong working majority in
the Legislature. No matter what advantages nature
may have bestowed upon a particular community, its
prosperity is always more or less affected by the laws
which direct its affairs. No natural prosperity, how
ever great, can withstand the drain put upon a people
by a wasteful and extravagant Legislature if left to
run its inevitable course.
While the large national questions at stake upon the
election of a United States Senator, and the impor
tant local issues involved in the election of a Legisla
ture that will be at once economical and progressive,
will naturally incline men to vote the Republican leg
islative ticket, too much dependence should not be
placed upon those factors in the problem. Senatorial
and Assembly districts are comparatively small, and
the candidates in them are generally so well known
to the voters that personal considerations are often as
effective as political issues in determining results on
election day. The legislative ticket, therefore, should
be made up of men who are personally popular and
esteemed; men whom the people know and trust;
men who are not under the domination or influence
of corporations or bosses; men who are not pledged
or bound to any corrupting combination or personal
ity; men who can be counted on to do in office that
which they promise in the campaign, and whose can
didacy will add strength to the whole ticket in the
districts where they run.
THE SILVER "REPUBLICANS."
AMONG the resurrected political fragments
which go to make up the Maguire fusion party
none occupy quite so humiliating a position as
the Silver Republicans. Representatives of these laction
ists met in State convention at Los Angeles on Friday
last, adopted a platform and meekly accepted the mor
sel of patronage doled out to them by the fusion com
mittee which conducted the Populist and Democratic
conventions. But there was no enthusiasm, and no
interest, no exultant feeling of victory, no cheering â
nothing, in fact, except a feast of indigestible crow.
This may have been due to the circumstance that
out of the fusion division the Silver Republicans have
obtained but two offices. One of these is a Justice of
the Supreme Court who is without political pull or
patronage, and who cannot even stump the State â at
least, not without some sacrifice of judicial dignity and
neglect of duty. Walter Van Dyke, the nominee re
ferred to, is a Superior Judge of Los Angeles County.
The other crumb doled out to the Silver Republicans
was the clerkship of the Supreme Court â a position
which has been given to H. A. McCraney, an old line
stalwart, the better part of whose life has been ex
pended in scalping Democrats and putting Populists
to the torture.
But the Silverites have accepted what has been
given to them with thanks, and in return they have
swallowed the entire fusion ticket, unwashed and all.
How many of them will vote for the candidates other
than Van Dyke and McCraney remains to be seen.
If one may judge from the platform adopted by the
convention not many of them will do that. The
Silver Republican declaration "reaffirms" the prin
ciples and doctrines of the Republican party "as de
clared and promulgated by Abraham Lincoln and
James G. Elaine." These principles and doctrines do
not accord with those "declared and promulgated" by
Thomas Jefferson, who was set up by the Democratic
convention as the political deity of the day. How
can the Silver Republicans support a ticket which
represents in great part the antithesis of Republican
ism? How can they vote for nominees who regard
the Dingley law as the invention of the devil, seeing
that that law establishes the great principles for
which Rlaine contended all his life? How can they
vote for nominees who look upon McKinley as an
"enemy" while they commend him for his "earnest
ness and patriotic zeal in the prosecution of the war?"
On one point, however, the Silver Republicans
agree with their fellow fusionists. They are united on
the 16 to I theory, on their opposition to the retire
ment of greenbacks, on their aversion for bonds and
denunciation of international bimetallism, and on their
view that bankers are birds of prey who feed upon the
remains of the people. But all this has an ancient and
fish-like smell. Are the Silver Republicans aware of
the fact that these things were repudiated by the peo
ple in November in 1896, and have since been in
terred in the political graveyard? Evidently the poli
ticians of the Silver Republican party have just re
covered from a long nap, and yet their platform indi
cates that they are actually aware of the war with
Spain and have an inkling of the new issues which
have in consequence sprung up and which are now
engaging the minds nf men.
The only hope for the Silver Republicans, however,
is to keep awake. If they fall into slumber again they
may open their eyes after election and find themselves
dead.
Now all the officers of the police force above the
rank of patrolman want to be provided with swords.
It might have been known that something of this sort
would happen when the Chief insisted on riding at
the head of every procession with a glittering blade
spanking the flanks of his charger. He looked pretty
enough to be demoralizing.
In attempting to draw a parallel between the fa
mous Barnaby poisoning case in Colorado and the
Dunning tragedy the Chronicle might have added that
the man convicted of the former crime was convicted
on evidence on which a sensible jury would not have
hanged a yellow dog.
Sagasta declares that Spain is still at war. The
Premier has evidently become so rattled that he does
not know peace when he sees it

DEATH OF COLONEL
JOHN O'BYRNE
DISTINGUISHED ARISH-AMEBI
CAN PASSES AWAY.
A Man of Scholarly Attainments and
Great Versatility Who /lad uu
Interesting Career.
Colonel John O" Byrne died at Â«!:#*
o'clock last evening at his home. l- air Oaks
and Twenty-fourth streets, after an 111â
nr-s.s of several weeks, during which he
Buffered the most Intense pain. Th< .-ause
of his death was Inflammatory rheuma
tism. which went to his heart.
Colonel O'Byrne was one of San Fran
cisco's most prominent and distinguished
citizens, and as a leader of Irish-Ameri
cans he had a national reputation. His
history la an Interesting one. He was
bora in Dublin in 1825, four years before
the passage of the O'Connell emancipa
tion act. His ancestors wi re the
<ri:, rues, chieftains of Wi<klow. and he
was very proud of this fart. After re
ceiving a thorough education he at once
plunged into political affairs, and at the
; .};.â  of 2:; was a participant i:i the Irish
rebellion of 1848. Making his escape, he
came to the United States, locating in
New York City, where lie engaged in
the field of journalism for a few years.
Colonel O'Byrne then bored to Phila
delphia and there studied law in the of
iice of Benjamin F. Brewster, who subse
quently was Attorney General of the
United States. In the year 1864 O'Byrne
took a prominent part in the defense of
the Catholic- people in the Know-Nothing
riots.
When the Civil War broke out he went
to the front for the Union, serving in one
of the Philadelphia regiments commanded
by Colonel Gosland.
About th- year 1870 Colonel O'Byrne
purchased In Urandywine Hundred, a sub
urb of Wilmington, Delaware, a beautiful
and extensive estate, where he lived for
several years. Buying the Weekly Adver
tiser of Wilmington he converted it into
a daily morning paper under the name of
the Herald. This was the first morning
paper in the State of Delaware.
At the request of the Democratic Na
tional Committee Colonel O'Byrne stump

tial campaign of ISSO for General Hancock.
Hia experience in that campaign led him
to change his residence from Delaware to
New York, where he was soon appointed
assistant to the District Attorney, Hon.
John McKeon. the distinguished anti-
Tammany Judge. Colonel O'Byrne filled
this responsible position with great effi
ciency and success. Owing to failing
health he came to California in 1889, and
was soon recognized as a lawyer of great
ability and an orator of magnetic elo
quence. He was the orator of the day at
the St. Patrick's day celebration in 1S:<O,
and on that occasion delivered a brilliant
and memorable oration.
Colonel O'Bryneâ journalist, lawyer, or
ator, soldier, patriot â was a man of schol
arly attainments and great versatility.
He could address a political audience and
deliver a lecture before an astronomical
or geographical society the same even
ing, or engage in the defense of a person
charged with crime. His w:is a m"?t ac
tive life, and he was constantly in the
midst of political excitement. He was,
however, a man wh<> never carried for a
day any malice or revengeful vindictive
ness even against his most aggrtj.-.-iva
and mdHt bitter opponent.
Colonel O'Byrne was a patriotic man
both as an American and as an Irish
man. He was a participant In the fa
mous Fenian movement, and was the
last of the charter members of the cele
brated Philopatrian Society of Philadel
i phla. He also fok an active part in the
i Land league movement, headed by Par
nell.

Knights of St. Patrick, Ancient Order
of Hibernians. Knights of the Red

<l KOTAL HKINO POWDER CO., WIW VOW*.REPUBLICAN
ORATORS IN
CONFERENCE
"Spell-Binders" Who
Will Stump the State.
JOIN HANDS TO ELECT GAGE
TROUBLE IN STORE FOR THE
DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE.
Mr. Maguire Is to Be Informed
That He Must Take Care of
Others Besides the
Gallaghers.
An. eloquent company assembled last
evening in the law offices of General W.
H. L. Barnes. Republican orators who are
known to the masses as "spoil binders"
convened by appointment to meet Henry
T. Gage, the Republican nominee for
Governor, and exchange views with the
Btandard-bearer of the party on the topic
c|f campaign speeches.
/The orators present were: Joseph C.
Campbell, George A. Knight. Van R. Fat
erson, \Y. H. L. Barnes and Judge Car
penter. Some significance is attached to
the fact that two of the eloquent speak
ers are candidates for the United States
Senate to succeed Hon. Stephen M.
White.
The conference was a happy ono
throughout. Before the State convention
met Messrs. Knight, Campbell, Barnes
and Paterson were not advocates of Mr.
Gage's nomination, but iast night they
declared without reservation and with
enthusiasm that the nominee of the
convention should have their earnest, ac
tfve and open support until the ballots
were counted. Every one agreed to take
.the stump and speak for the Republican
clause and the Republican ticket.
. Mr. Gage submitted to them his ideas
or the line of battle, and they made such
suggestions as their judgment dictated.
The utmost good feeling prevailed from
the time the conference convened until it
dissolved.
Mr. Gage will leave San Francisco in
time to reach Los Angeles next Saturday
evening and attend the great home dem
onstration which his neighbors and par
ty friends are preparing in his honor. Be
fore leaving here he will submit the
names of twenty-one men to comprise
the executive committee of the Republi
can State Central Committee. Many of
...imes have been selected, and it was
paid by Mr. Gage last night that the en
tire list would be announced before he
left the city for his home.
When Judge Maguiro returns from the
South to-day he will find awaiting him
tuch a. budget of protests as will cause
him to awake from his dream and come
to a realization of the fact that if he
wishes to be elected Governor he will
have to consider other things than the
promotion of the single tax doctrine and
the betterment of the political condition
(if the members of the Clan Gallagher.
The Immediate cause of the rude awak
ening that awaits the much-pledged Dera
ii,' candidate for Governor is the
proposed personnel of the executive com
mUte-o of the Democratic State Central
O'ommittee. The Gallaghers, the Manns
and the Leggetts have formed a close
corporation and have named Maguire as
the mouthpiece through which is an
nounced the law as regards the conduct
of the present campaign. In this manner
It has been given to the world that tho
executive; commit toe is to be composed of
Gallaghers ana single tax-rs with Selh
Mann at the helm. The men who have
tax years had a voice in the councils of
the "party have waited in vain for a
BumHKHis to the council hall, and now
they propose to interrupt Maguire in the
pleasant occupation of accepting the plat
form and pledi; old party that
can scare up enough money to hire a con
vention hall and impress upon his intel
!â¢â¢ â . t the fact of their continued existence.
To sum up the situation in a few words,
the erstwhile leaders of the party demand
recognition and a chance to have Rome
Bay in how the campaign shall be con
ducted In the event of success they want
to .have a hand in distributing patronage
and an opportunity to profit by the <!<â 
feat of their political opponents. Being
firm In their convictions they have de
cided to Inform Maguire that unless he
consents to suppress the Gallaghers, over
look the Manns and give the cold shoul
der to the Lc-ggetts and the single tax
doctrine ' they will refuse to shout for
Hutchison, the Populist. Van Dyke, the
renegade Republican, and all the rest of
the motley crew who hail him as their
chief and whose, variegated sentiments he
applauds. These are some of the pleas
ant things that await the coming of Ma
guire, the Democratic nominee for Gov
ernor. _ ...
When Maguire., the Populist nominee
for Governor, returns from his southern
tri-p he will be brought face to face With
a full-grown protest from the handful of
Popuiists who sold their birthright at
Sacramento, in July, and are now reap
ing a rich harvest of regret. The hay-
Beed politicians have been studying Ma
guire's letter accepting the Populist party
platform, and at the same time the nomi
nation .accompanying it. and they have
arrived at the conclusion that the ac
ceptance of the platform was bogus.
They realize, they say, that Mriguire
dodged several of the most important
planks in the platform. They also want
to know what part, if any, they are to
play In the work of directing the cam
paign They propose to demand an ex
planation, and if they do not receive a
satisfactory answer they intenu to Bay
a few unpleasant things to Maguire, the
Populist nominee for Governor.
When Maguire, the Silver Republican
nominee for Governor, returns from his
. visit to Los Angeles he will be agreeably
Â«=urpri.sed to see th* manner In which tho
OeAocrata are whooping things up for
Hutchison. Maple. McCraaey, Runekel,
Van Dyke, Dryden and J. Aubrey Jones.
YOUNG REPUBLICANS RALLY.
A Rousing Meeting Held in the
Forty-First District.
Lively music and eloquent speeches
were listened to by a large number of
Republicans In Lougheau Hall, 1605 Polk
last night during the initial meet
ing of the Young Men's Independent Re
publican. Club of the Forty-first District.
P. D. Worth, President of the Conti
nental Republican Club, acted as tem
porary chairman, and in a neat speech
introduced Major C W. Kyle as the first
speaker of the evening. The major as
sured his listeners that by voting the Re
publican ticket they were voting fur a
ticket, which had representative citizens
as' candidates, and it was for their good
that they elect them to office. He then
spoke of Henry T. (ingo, the next Gov
ernor of California. The speaker closed
with a eulogy of the Republican candidate
and- told with what veneration he was
held by the people of the south, of his
ability as a lawyer and of his qualities as
a man.
Colonel John H. Roberts was then intro
duced. "We are just starting on a cam
paign," he said. "It is not going to be a
walkover. We are going to have enough
to do. We can only arrive at a .just con
clusion by havinr a knowledge of the
past." He paid his respects to Mr. Ma-
Kuire. and charged him with opposing the
passage of a tax on beer, tobacco, bonds
.and mortgages and stamps on checks as
I'eing hardships on the poor man. and of
) is opposing the annexation of the Ha
walian Islands for fear that an Influx of
Chinese would flow into this country and
revolutionize labor clrc!'
I "hidrnian Worth followed with a short
speech, in which he told the members to
get out and hustle, as there was good
yoilng" mat* rial In the district that needed
cultivation. Mr. Ballard followed in the
same strain.
51. H. Bheppard was elected permanent
chairman of the club and Charles Kend
ricks secretary.
It was stated that Mr. Gage would be in
vited to address the club some time next
month. . Â»

THE DEMOCRATS
WILL NOT HOLD
ANY PRIMARY
Followers of Phelan
Afraid of a Contest.
WILL APPOINT DELEGATES
STRUGGLING TO DISRUPT THE
HARNEYITES.
There Are Many Candidetes in the
Field Hoping to Be Struck
by the Political Light
ning Rod.
The suggestion made by the Democratic
State Convention, that a primary election
be held in this city to settle the differ
ences between the Harneyites and the
Sullivan-Phelan-McNab wing of the local
Democracy will nut be accepted. TII9
Phelan-McNab contingent will not meet
the Harneyites in a primary battle. They
are afraid of the result. They believe
that "a bird in the hand is worth two in
the bush," and are not going to take any
chances of losing the bird they now hold.
In other words, McNab and Phelan be
j lieve they now have full control of the
local political machine and consequently
are unwilling to risk the chance of los
ing it.
The Committee of One Hundred will not
call a primary for the election of dele
gates to the municipal nominating con
vention. The Harneyites are only too anx
ious to meet them at a primary, but they
will not be given an opportunity to show
their strength. The leaders of the Com
mittee of One Hundred have decided since
their return from Sacramento that they
have everything to lose by holding a pri
mary. They argue on the line that their
appointed delegates to the State conven
tion were recognized and that the dele
gates they will appoint to that municipal
convention will also be recognized. If
both factions were to go out of existence
and a primary were held to elect dele
gates to the municipal convention and
also elect a new county committee, it is
feared by the Sullivan-Phelan-JUcNab
people that they would be defeated* at the
polls. Under these circumstances they
will ignore the suggestion of the State
convention and appoint a municipal con
vention that will L>e composed of men who
will programme on every office.
The plan of the self-oppointed bosses is
to have a municipal nominating conven
tion of 200 members. The Committee of
One Hundred will form one-half of the
convention and the other 100 will be se
lected by them in about the same manner
as the delegates to the State convention
were chosen. They are of the opinion
that with a majority of the Board of
Election Commissioners to sustain the
programme, they will not experience any
dimeulty in having their nominees placed
,on the ballot as the nominees of the Dem
ocratic party. But to guard against any
break, they are now working on the mem
bers of the Hartley committee of 460. (jilt- I
edge promises of political preferment are j
being made to the vacillating members ]
of the Harney committee to have them
vote to adjourn the Harney committee
sine die.
There is every indication that there will
be a "hot time" in the Democratic camp
next week.- The committees of both fac
tions will meet, and the struggle for su
premacy will commence. The Phelan-
McNab faction feels confident that it will
be able to secure votes enough": to disrupt
the Harney committee. In that event it
will have clear sailing so far as the mat
ter of nominations is concerned. If the
leaders carry out their scheme It is al
most safe to say that the local Demo
cratic ticket will be snowed under on ;
election day. The Harneyites will stand ;
by the State and Congressional ticket, but
will stop there. If the McNab-Phelanltea 1
succeed in disrupting the Harney com- |
mittee they will not be able to weld the
party together again. Not a few of the
Harneyites say that they fought to the |
laat to receive proper recognition, and j
failing in that they will vote the local
Republican ticket rather than submit to
the dictation of the self-appointed bosses.
Neither of the committees will meet be- j
fore the middle of next week, unless there
is a change In the programme. The Har
neyites are awaiting the action of the i
newly appointed State Central Committee,
and are in hopes that it may decide to
take a firm stand in the matter anf
order a primary for the election of dele- |
gates to the municipal convention. In
that event they will be satisfied; other
wise they will give battle to the local
ticket if chosen by an appointed conven-
Mayor Phelan -will be renominated by
his faction for Mayor. lie- would like to
step out, however, and wait until the new
charter goes into effect He would then
run for Mayor and become the boss of the
so-called civil service reform movement if
elected Hut he cannot get out of tne
present struggle. To withdraw wou.d
probably result in the loss of the political
machine a year from now, and he does not
want to lose anything he has on hand
that will aid him in reaching the guber
natorial chair, which he ia looking upon
with jealous eye.
If the Phelan-McNab plan does not fail.
Judges Borden. Seawall and Wallace will
be renominated and the tourth place will
go to cither Frank Murasky or Stephen
V. Coatello.
Senator Mead is out against Public Ad
ministrator Freese for that office, and
Franklin K. Lane and James Gallagher
will contest for the nomination for City
and County Attorney. Gallagher, who be
longs to the Gallagher-Maguire clan, be
lieves that he has the inside track, by
reason of the fact that he now holds the
office, having been appointed by the Su
pervisors when Harry Creswell resigned.
License Collector Bonnet, ex-County
Clerk M. C. Haley and John A. Brown,
a salesman in the employ of J. J. O'Brien
& Co., are mentioned for the Democratic
nomination for County Clerk.
Sheriff Whelan would like another term
in office, and up to date he lias a good
fight on hand for the Democratic nomina
tion.
Tax Collector Block is said to have the
inside track for the Democratic nomina
tion for Assessor, and Eugene N. Dcu
prey is looked upon as the Democratic
slate candidate for District Attorney. If
Block is nominated for Assessor, Hiram
B. Cook, his chief deputy, will probably
carry oft the nomination for Tax Col
lector.
Recorder Tom Glynn is not satisfied
with a four-year term in office and ex
pects to be renominated by the McNab-
Phelanites. Ex-Senato* Thomas Pinder
will try conclusions with him for the
nomination.
The Republican county committee will
meet in the early part of next week and
arrange for a primary to elect delegates
to the municipal convention, which will
convene not later than September 15.
There are quite a number of aspirant*
in the Held for nomination. Ex-Mayor L.
R Kllert, ex-Chief of Police Crowley and
J B Stetson are mentioned in connection
with' the Mayoralty nomination.
William Deane, Henry Martin and Wil
liam Joost are out for County Clerk,
while Leon Jones. Supervisor Ed Smith,
School Director Ed Head, ex-Supervisor
Toe King and Supervisor Morton are in
hopes that the Shrievalty nomination will

John D. Siebe would not refuse another
term in the Assessor's office, but in the

THE SA:N FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 30, 1898.
FINEST AMERICAN STEEL SHIP AFLOAT.
The Erskine M. Phelps, now loading at Baltimore for San Francisco, is American from stem to stern
and from keel to truck. She was launched from the Sewall yards last July, and should arrive here next Feb
ruary. Captain Graham, who is well known nere as master of the W. F. Babcock, will command the new
crack.
COME FROM
ALL DISTRICTS
Minor Offices Causing
Unusual Strife.
CHURCH HAS COMPETITORS
AN ARMY OF ASPIRANTS TO
DISPENSE JUSTICE.
Constables' Fees Also Attract a
Large Number of Candidates
Fusion Appears to Be
in Favor.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
906 Broadway, August 29.
As there appears to be something in the
nature of a slate in connection with coun
ty offices, more interest than usual cen
ters around the district contests in which
it is apparent that so far no programme
exists.
Two Senators, Wo Supervisors, six As
semblymen and a myriad of Justices of
the Peace and Constables all over the
county have to be voted on at the coming
election, and a score of young lawyers
and as many active politicians are after
the nominations.
To succeed Senator Denlson Assembly
man Frank M. Leavitt and District At
torney Snook are the only candidates.
Leavitt conns from the oixth and Snook
from the Fourth Ward. In the latter
ward there are several candidates, but in
the Sixth there are practically none at
this time, and, of course, the smaller
number from any district increases the
chances ot its aspirants. In the Fourth
Ward Will 11. Church is a candidate for
Supervisor to succeed himself. He has a
very strong opponent in Joseph K. Kelly,
and a strong effort is being made by
Church's friends to pull Kelly down with
a promise of support should he run for
the Assembly. Kelly is not listening with
any too willing ear to this promise, and
at present shows no inclination to forego
hiÃ supervisorial ambition.
Dr. Simpson of Alameda, who some
years ago was prominent in politics, has
once more come forward ajid he also
would like the nomination for Supervisor,
the island being also in Church's district.
Supervisor Talcott is not yet threatened
with any opposition, no one having an
nounced that he Intends to compete with
him for the nomination. Roeth, Mitchell
and Wells hold over.
For tne Assembly nominations there is
much scrambling. In the Fifty-first Dis
trict Howard E. Wright wants to go back
to Sacramento, but William B. Pringle
and ex-Councilman C. G. Dodge are also
anxious to represent the district, and
each is looking around to see what com
binations can be made to further his
chances of success.
The Forty-eighth Assembly District
presents an open fleiu for a fight. Phil
M. Walsh, Frank Burnett, Will Friend
and others have been mentioned, but no
active work has so far been done by any
of them. In the other districts no formal
announcements of candidates have yet
been made, except by A. A. McKeen, who
would like to be the nominee from the
Forty-ninth.
Hut the great struggle for place is on in
the contest for Justices of the Peace of
Oakland Township. Justice Clift Is to re
tire and hopes to be District Attorney,
and for his seat have already appeared a
small army. Constable Cronin was the
first to express his desire to be a Justice,
and alter him came John W. Stetson, who
was nominated four years ago and beaten
by Fred Wood, who ran Independently.
Will D. Powers. A. W. Bishop and Judge
Talcott complete the list, while for city
Justices Harry Pulcifer, Mortimer Smith
and possibly Judge Wood are already in
the field.
There is no lack of candidates for Con
stable of Oakland Township, and it is not
a difficult matter to divine the cause.
Last, year the Constables of Oakland
Township received in fees and mileage
$8354, and this amount does not include all
foes paid for civil business, of which an
enormous quantity Is done in that court.
J. C. Williamson, W. J. Downing and Ed
AV'i'ller have so far put their names for
ward, and as Constable Cronin is after
another job. two of these three will prob
ably be elected.
In a few days it is expected that some
thing will be done by the Democrats and
Populists looking toward the naming of a
county ticket. It is almost certain that
the county will follow the example of the
State and adopt a fusion platform and
programme.
WILL SUPPORT THE TICKET.
There was a meeting of the Young
Men's Republican Club of the Forty-sec
ond Assembly District last evening, at
Turn Verein Hall, the object being to per
fect a strong organization so as to pre
sent a solid front on election day In the
interest of Henry T. Gage, and also to
father the candidacy of J. J. McCarthy
for Assemblyman from the Forty-second
District. The meeting was called to order
by R S. Glaze, who, after stating the ob
ject of the meeting. Invited the members
to present names for their consideration
to act as officers of the club during the
campaign. The following were elected:
R. 8. Glaze, president; Thomas Rothen
berger, vice president; Henry Kelling, re
cording secretary; Charles Birdsall, ser
geant-at-arms. The following executive
committee was appointed by the chair:
Peter L.earch, J. Gilbert, Charles Jami
son John Flaherty and J. T. Harding.
Mr McCarthy, in an address, advised the
members to proffer their services to the
State Central Committee to act as watch
ers during the count on the evening of
election day. and to stay at their post of
duty until the last ticket was counted and
recorded, so as to prevent a repetition of
that political treachery that took place in
some of the districts during the last gu
bernatorial contest.

The Erskine M. Phelps was built by
Arthur So wall & Co., of Bath, ivlaine, the
well-known builders of the ships Rappa
hannock, Shenandoah (now on her way
to San Francisco), Susquehanna, Roan
oke (the largest wooden merchant vessel
afloat) and the steel ship Dirigo, launch
ed in March, ISM. Arthur Sewall, the
senior member of the firm, was the late
Vice-Presidential candidate on tho Dem
ocratic ticket.
Erskino M. Phelps, for whom the ship
is named, is one of the best known of
Chicago's merchant princes. He is a
prominent member of tho National
Democratic Committee, and during the
recent campaign was one of Mr. Sewall's
strongest supporters.
Captain Robert J. Graham, who will
command the new vessel, is one of the
most popular masters that come to this
port He is an old navigator, and a very
clever business man. When last here
Captain Graham was in command of the
ship W F. Babcock. and was accompanied
by his wife and little daughter, Gladys.
Mrs Graham was one of tmt belles of
Berkeley, and her many friends will be
glad to hear of Captain Graham's pro
motion to the command of one of the
finest sailing vessels afloat.
Captain Graham went to sea when he
was 15 years old in the Bath ship Idle
Lily and gradually worked his way
up in the Sewall employ until he was
master of the ship Reuce. Two years
ago he was given command of the Bab
cock, and now he has been transferred
to the Phelps.
CAUGHT IN THE ACT.
Two Pickpockets Arrested on a
Mission Street Car by the
Harbor Police.
For weeks past the harbor police have
been trying to break up a ganr- of pick
pockets that has made the new ferry
depot its stamping ground. Several ar
rests have been made at different times
and Sunday night Officers Shaw and Bills
locked up Walter Nagle and Frank Wall,
who they think are the last of the band.
It was about 8:30 p. m. and the assengers
by an incoming ferry boat were crowding
into the cars. The policemen had been
watching Wall and Nagle and when they
caw them rush for a Mission-street car
they followed. Wall got on at one end
and in the crush put his hand in a wo
man's pocket, so the officers say. Nagle
got on at the other end but was not
caught In any overt act. Both men
wore placed under arrest. Nagle was and
is a clerk for C. E. Whitney & Co.. pro
duce merchants, 110 Davis street. Nagle's
employes refuse to believe the story told
by the police, and say that for the ; two
years and a half Nagle has been in their
employ he has been sober, honest and in
dustrious. They insist that there is a
mistake somewhere.
Wall was charged with vagrancy at the
City Prison yesterday and released on $100
cash bail. The Nagle case is still in abey-
ance.
The river steamer H. J. Corcoran sus
tained some slight damage when she
came off the drydock yesterday. When
the strain came one of her hog chains
snapped and the other soon followed suit.
The damage will be repaired in a few
hours and the steamer will not be delayed
by the accident.
Pacific-street wharf is back to its old
condition once more and the officers of
the Oceanic Steamship Company are de
lighted. The steamer Australia has got
rid of all the bunks and paraphernalia
that were put in to make her into a
troopship and will ho once again a first
class passenger steamer before she goes
out next Thursday. Chief Steward Pen
field and his assistants have worked won
ders during the last few days, and the
big steamer is once more beginning to
look like herself.
All the vessels of the fleet from Aus
tralia and the Islands are making long
passages. The bark R. P. Rithet that got
in yesterday was thirty-one days and the
schooner Transit was twenty-nine days
from Honolulu. The bark George F.
Manson is now out US days from Sydney,
and 20 per cent reinsurance has been paid
on her, but the chances are that, like
all the others, she is detained by light
winds and calms.
A TIMELY WARNING
TO BOXING CLUBS
FI3HTERS MUST BE IN CONDI
TION AND FLOORS PADDED.
Captain Gillen Refused the Hartford
Club Permission to Carry Out
Its Programme.
The so-called Hartford Boxing Club
pave an entertainment last evening: In a
tire trap on Hartford street.
The ring in which the exponents of the
manly art appeared was several feet less
than the regulation size and the padding
consisted of a cheap blanket.
Sergeant G. B. Griffiths allowed a few
preliminaries as a means or expenmt
but when his good judgment convinced
him that a heavy fall might bo the means
of a death in the family of untrained
sloggers he reported progress to Captain
James W. Gillen; who ordered the festivi
ties to come to a speedy conclusion so as
to avoid possible accident. The directors
of the club were nonplused at the orders
of the captain, but the few prominent
sportsmen who were in attendance eulo
gized the official for his timely Interfer
ence, and they did not hesitate to say
that the captains of the various districts
where hippodrome boxing contests were
held should emulate Captain Gillen s ex
ample and save the lives of poorly condi
tioned boxers by putting a stop to alleged
fistic entertainments.
Mushroom club boxing contests- are or
ganized solely in the interest of a few
rock-rolling politicians who live on the
proceeds of the entertainments to which
they charge an admission fee. The man
agers engage the cheapest fistic < talent
obtainable and as a result some unfortun
ate fellow who is anxious for a cheap rep
utation falls into a trap which may
cause his death.
Had a fire occurred last evening in the
Hartford Club scrapping trap there was
no means of exit < excepting through a
hole-in-the-wall which admitted but one
person at a time. .'"â¢â¢"â  *
Captain Gillen is certainly deserving of
recognition for the stand he has taken In
obliterating these so-called boxing clubs,
whose existence is of only one month's
'rhe contests of the Hartford Club con
sisted of a four-round bout between Jim
Little and Tom O'Leary and a two round
contest between Myers and Sweeney,
which contests were very uninteresting.
IMPORTANT TO DRUGGISTS.
Must Furnish Sworn Statements
Without Delay to the Col
lector.
Collector Lynch received from the Sec
retary of the Treasury yesterday a cir
cular of considerable importance to drug
gists and manufacturers. It is as follows:

cists and other dealers In articles subject to
internal revenue tax under schedule B, act of
June 13 1898, were unable to procure the nec
e-^iry revenue stamps for such articles on
hand July 1 IS9S, collectors of internal revenue
will at once notify all such druggists and deal
ers that a sworn Ftatement of all such sales
of unstamped articles made by them on and
after that date should be furnished without de

ONR CANNED GOODS ABROAD.
The fruit market continues bare of supplies,
and prices remain high, says the London Gro
cers' Gazette of August 13. A shipment of
over' 16,000 cases has just arrived at Liverpool
per Marlborough Hill, and they were all taken
up and distributed immediately on arrival.
No better reports are to hand from the other
side, and it is stated that packers ixrr paying
forfeit on ;i considerable portion of their con
tracts. Apricots are reported very scarce.
The Salmon market in <iuiet but prices are
unchanged. Reports from the other side speak
of the fishing as being of very unsatisfactory
character, and in consequence of packers re
fraining from selling this season's goods, the
tone of the market has been strengthened, the
few parcels that were offering at easy rates
having been withdrawn. It Is also tinted that
dealers who are not well supplied with stocks
are commencing to buy from those who are
willing to resell on the market. The supply of
half-pound tins is almost exhausted. The Dun
nerdale brought 7465 cases and the Marl
borough Hill and the Caiiforntar. 6616 and 500
cases respectively, the two last named to L'.v
.erpool.

FASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
' XEW YORK. Aug. 29.â Prices of stocks broke
sharply to-day and showed depression through
out. ' The first rally showed considerable vigor.
but later in the day the recuperative power of
the market became feebler and the close was
barely steady at slightly above the lowest. Net
losses ranged from 1 to 2 points in leading
Btocks. There was a growing disposition to ]
realize profits both by professional traders and
by "outside" holders. The latter was shown by
the stead ' stream of selling orders that came
from the commission houses all day. Pro
fessional traders quite generally took that side
of the market and the bears sold with grow
ing confidence, the demand to cover at the
close being very light, even with the sub
stantial reduction of prices. There is evidently
a large growth of the powerful trading ele
ment, which has lightened its holding of stocks
and is anxious for lower prices to buy back
again. There was palpable manipulation at
the opening to fix a low level for prices. In
some of the leading stocks the opening was
about the lowest of the day. Others held quite
firmly for the rest of the day's session, but
eventually yielded to the persistent demon
stration of the bears in other stocks. Buy-
Ing for London account was a distinctive fac
tor in the firmness in a number of international
favorites. There was a steady absorption of
stocks at the decline, which was especially
marked in Burlington and St. Paul. This
seemed to be the result of buying orders below
tne level of the market for trader's account as
â well as from commission houses. The same
thing was evident in the Pacifies and other
â stocks here and throughout the list. The ten
dency to sell was undoubtedly due to the pros
pects of tight money. The minimum rate for
call loans was held at 2 per cent and 3 per cent
was paid in some cases.
The London money market was marked up
a. sharp fraction to-day and there was buying
of gold in the open market there, said to bo
for shipment to New York. No engagement
was announced, however, In Wall street. The
poor rates fur money caused a depression in
the bond market even more acute than that in
stocks. Some of the speculative bonds that
have been recent favorites showed marked re
actions end heaviness predominated In all is
sues. Total sales, $3,725,000.
United States Ba, when, issued, declined %
per cent In the bid price and % per cent on
actual transactions. The new 4s, coupon, sold
at 126%, a decline of % per cent, but the clos
ing bids, except for the 3s, were unchane-Pd.

LONDON MARKETS.
. NEW YORK. Aug. 29.â Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The settle
ment here shows an Increased account, not
ably In Americans, but money is so plentiful
that eontangoes were quite light, those on
Americans being only 2% per cent. The tone
of the markets was generally good to-day on
the â¦Tzar's universal peace manifesto. A fur
ther rise in Brazils and Argentines was the
chief feature. Americans were irregular, some
of the active shares reacting on profit taking,
but the close was generally better. For the
moment I am able to report considerable pub
lic buying here, but whether it will last it is
difficult to say. St. Paul stock was scarce at
the settlement and there was no contango.
New York Is now buying gold freely. I learn
over 400.000 pounds has been bought. The Lon
don discount rate Is 1% per cent In consequence
and IS per cent is asked for American bills
for forward delivery.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Aug. 29.â Wheat experienced a
strong start because of disappointingly small
receipts in the Northwest and higher quota
tions from Liverpool, although the latter were
not unexpected in view of the advance on this
side Saturday. Visible supply statement showed
77 000 bushels increase for the week. Asa de
crease i had been expected the bullishness of
the market received a partial extinguisher.
People who needed September wheat and had
found considerable difficulty in buying were
now enabled to have their wants supplied with
out shouting for the wheat, sellers betas com
pelled to take a turn at the shouting. TV? esti
mate that carloads of wheat at Chicago nor to
morrow's inspection would be 406 was anVher
blow to the bulls in the market. That in\d
dition to the disappointment about the vlsltJlo
caused September to drop for a time all its
early advance. December was relatively firmer
and did not decline more than He, while Sep
tember was losing Ic. December was much
more largely dealt in than September, and has
most pronouncedly become the active trading
future. September was difficult to buy when
wanted and hard to sell when that was con
sidered desirable. September left off %tf%c
higher, and December gained *4@%e.
A good business was done in corn and In the
main the market was strong. The bone of
contention was the condition of the growing
crop upon which subject there was a wide dif
ference of opinion. The close Is unchanged to
%c up. .
There was. little done in oats, and the close
was unchanged on the day.
Moderate buying by English houses held
provisions firm. Lard and ribs were compara
tively stronger than pork. September hold
ings have been transferred or sold, and â  the
trade was no longer under the influence of op
â¢ erations by people who had no us*> for pro
visions on delivery day. Pork and lard are un
changed and ribs rose 7%<9>10c.

tion thai the will should be set a^ide on
lhe allegation that his â wife was insane
when she executed the instrument. lie
charged that Mrs. Garcia. Mrs. Gerrish
and frank Gerrish had poisoned his wife's
i;.. . l him. had made false state
â¢ jnents and led her to believe that he had
been guilty of Infidelity. By reason of
- this influence Mrs. Scott became jealous
â¢.: of her husband, and, as he alleged, treat
â â  edhim uniustly in her will.
The case was tried before Judge Coffey,
and was sensational to a degree when it
r- ferred to the disposition and conduct of
Mrs. Scott. As reviewed by the court in
the decision, "Mrs. Soott was a woman
â¢.. endowed with physical form of symmet
rical-proportions, with stately presence
and digniiied carriage, conscious of her
Charms, â  proud and vain of her beauty
and avaricious of admiration and jealous
' of attention bestowed upon others of her
sex, of whom she was not fond, having
. . little confidence in the virtue of women
and less faith in woman's virtue." Nev
ertheless, she was of sound mind, holds
the court, and was capable of disposing
of her property as her conscience die
. tated.
At the time of his marriage Scott was
In .financial distress. He, for some time,
had met with but little success in busi
ness, and new duties devolved upon him
when he came to manage his wife's es
tate, and as such manager he was not a
; success. The court, on the other hand,
.: finds that Mrs, Scott was learned in busi
methods and shrewd. It was nat
ural under the circumstances that she
should have been disappointed, states
Judge Coffoy, in finding that her 1; I
' was lacking in business ability. Her abil
ity and her disappointment that her hus
band was not so gifted are strong cvi- j
dences of her sanity. As to hÂ«r personal
'ttatnre, the court found that she was
coarse, oi.se^-ne and immodest. Although
â¢. â¢ proud and stately in public bearing,
. :ln.'her- home, states the court, "she
threw off hi r affe< tation of r"s< rye and
â ' reticence and assumed an abandon of act
â¢" and expression that would put Billings
gate' to blush and cause Its fishmongers
â  to hide their heads in shame." She used
;â¢ obscene language, indulged in nude gam
..:. .'tols before her mirror and was guilty of
â¢ departure from modesty in many ways,
â  but the court refused to consider such
â¢ characteristics as evidence of insanity.
â¢.. Another point in her favor was that she
had reason to believe that h<;r husband
was unfaithful to her, and reference was
â  made to an occasion when she caught her
husband fondling a servant girl.
' :'. The will also is strong evidence of the
sanity of the testatrix. She disposed of
her property in a natural way. remember
ing relatives of her first husband as well
as those of her second. She left her hus
band that portion that pleased her mind,
and that it did not please her husband is
no reason for setting it aside, Conse
quently, the will was sustained.
S^ott. it is believed, will take an appeal
to the Supreme Court.

OFFER OF A

AT HONOLULU
Not Far From the

IS SUPPLIED WITH WATER
TROUBLES OF THE SEVENTH
CALIFORNIA REGIMENT.
Another Emphatic Denial of an
Epidemic of Typhoid Fever Is
Made by the
Officers.
Just before his departure for Honolulu
General Merriam received a letter from
Colonel Barber stating that it was a dif
ficult matter to find suitable camping
grounds there for the troops that were to
be sent to the islands. A day or two later
there came instructions from Washington
revoking the order to forward troops to
Honolulu until the return of General Mer
riam, who would report upon a camp site.
When General Merriam comes back
from the islands, In about two weeks,
whether or not he has discovereu any
camping ground in or near Honolulu, he
will find awaiting him here an offer of a
suitable site. The offer is made by CL.
Wllcox, a. prominent business man of
Honolulu and a member of the Hawaiian
Senate. Mr. Wilcox, who is indorsed by
Senator Perkins, consulted with Colonel
Berry of the Seventh California in regard
to the matter and at the Colonel's sugges
tion he put his proposition in writing and
addressed it to General Merriam. It is
as follows:
Understanding that the forwarding of troops
to Honolulu, as ' contemplated, has been inter
fere! with because doubts have been created
as to securing a suitable camp ground, I would
respectfully submit that I am the owner of a
tract of land within two miles of the business
center of Honolulu, It being the unoccupied
portion of a block, and containing- about NO
l.y 4UO feet, of land adjacent to and bounded
by Sheridan and King streets, along one of
w hlch a Government water pipe Is laid, which
I hereby offer for use as a temporary camp
ground, from one to six months, at the option
of the Government, for any troops the United
States Government may desire 'to fjfward
there: the only condition being that when the
ground Is vacated by the troops it be placed
In as good condition as when the/ took pos
session of It.
NO EPIDEMIC OF TYPHOID.
Officers of thÂ© Seventh Califor
nia Again Make an Em
phatic Denial.
Regarding the article published In yes
terday's Chronicle in relation to the in
crease of typhoid fever in the Seventh
California Regiment, and the statement
that Major Choate and his assistants were
diagnosing the cases as measles, when
they were fever, in order to su-nress the
seriousness of the malady, Major Mat
thews, surgeon in charge of the division
hospital, makes the following statement:
"I want to say once and for the last
time that no epidemic of typhoid fever
exists in the Seventh California Regiment.
The percentage of sickness in the regi
ment is small. We have here the healthi
est army corps in the United States ser
vice. There is no reason Â£or the daily
publication of the sensational articles
that have been appearing, for there is no
truth in them. Tue statement published
by the Chronicle that the medical officers
of this hospital said that the surgtons of
the Seventh Regiment were diagnosing
cases as measles when they were fever is
not true, as that statement was not made
by myself or any of my officers. Let me
tell the public that there have been in the
Division Hospital two deaths from ty
phoid fever. The others have been most
ly from pneumonia and a complication of
other diseases with typhoid fever. The
fact that the hospital is so crowded is be
cause we are sending no patients away
now, and not that there is any alarming
â increase in any disease. These are the
facts in the case and there is no cause
for such alarm as the sensational articles
now being published would indicate. I
have given the facts to The Call once be
fore and I repeat them again so that the
public may know the truth."
Colonel Berry makes the following
statement: "I want to say through the
columns of The Call, for it is the paper
that has stood for decency and reliabil
ity ever since the war began, that these
articles that are being published in the
Chronicle, in which it is daily asserted
that my regiment is suffering from an
epidemic of typhoid fever and that my
medical officers are perjuring themselves
by diagnosing the cases as one thing
when they are another, is a personal at
tack upon me. The report that the regi
ment was kept at Camp Merritt when
the men were dying of fever, simply for
the re.-ison that we wanted to get away
to Honolulu, and that the fact that fever
was raging in the command was kept a
secret from General Miller is absolutely
false. I myself, at the suggestion of
Major Choate, went twice to see General
Miller and told him that if we were not
to be sent away the regiment should
be moved at once, as there was some
fever among the men, and I thought that
it was due to some local trouble.
"By no means all of the fever cases that
have been sent from the regiment are
typhoid; many of them are malarial with
tvphold symptoms, as will be borne out
by the reports of the division hospital
surgeons. Knowing that The Call has
been reliable in all of its statements and
that it has taken no notice of the yellow
sensations of the camp, but has simply
told the truth, I make this statement
because I want the public to know the
facts.
"The percentage of sickness in the regi
ment is very small. At present it is leas
than 10 per cent, while frequently it has
been the case that regiments have had
over 30 per cent of sickness, and not
much was thought of it."
THE "HOODOO" REGIMENT.
Little Chance of the Seventh
Seeing Active Service.
It looks as though fate was against the
Seventh Regiment of California Volun
teers and that it is destined to pass Into
history as the "Hoodoo Regiment." Its
members were among the first to enlist
in response to the call of their country,
but bo far they have only had the oppor
tunity of lighting measles and typhoid
fever In the most unhealthful place on the
peninsula. The Chamber of Commerce
urged the President of the United States
to do what he could to give the boys a
chance at the front and the answer re
ceived yesterday indicates that the sol
j diers of the Seventh are to become per
j manent residents of this city, the follow
' ing dispatch coming from the War De-
I partmtnt, which gives little or no encour
agement of active service:
Hugh Craigâ Sir: Acknowledging the receipt
of your letter to the President or the 29th
ultimo. In which you say that the Seventh
California Regiment of Infantry was the first
to leave their homes for the volunteer service
of the United States and are greatly disap
pointed at being held In California so long,
while Kastern regiments are being sent to the
front, the Secretary of War desires me to In
form you that the Dejiurtment does not at
present contemplate the sending of any troops
further WeÃt than Honolulu, Sandwich Isl

HURRY TO SHOW FIGURES,
From Three Dollars and a Half the

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug.. 29..
The Church of the Advent has enjoyed
an experience with the Contra Costa
Water Company that throws more than
a shadow on the methods in > vogue for
taxing property according to schedule. â¢
For a long time the church' has been
taxed $3 40 a month for its supply of wa
ter The trustees discussed the matter
and concluded that no such amount of
water could possibly be used. A commit
tee was appointed to visit the company
to see if better ' terms " could ' not ; be ar
ranged. There was a good deal of dis
cussion, but nothing . satisfactory --was
done until the company suggested that
the church put in a meter and pay by the
the bill might be high
er, but anxious to make the â experiment.
Treasurer A. J. Read accepted the meter
proposition. ' The machine was put in ana
the first month under the new method of, ;
measuring has passed. To the suprise of
all concerned the bill amounted to $1. As
this is the minimum rate allowed under
the ordinance for places where a meter is
used the committee suspected that it had
not used even the amount of water repre
sentel by the dollar. They went to the
company's office to satisfy their curiosity,
and the -following story, of the interview
was told to-day by one of the church otn
"On going Into the office the clerk, said
that as the bill was for the minimum
amount allowed on meter rates It should
be satisfactory. We told him it was emi
nently satisfactory, but â¢ that we were a
little curious. We -wanted to know the
exact amount of water the church had
used. The clerk fumbled hastily through
a lot of tags and finally told us that wo
hadn't used quite a dollar's worth.
" 'If it is not against- your rules, said
one of the party, 'would you mind letting
us know the exact amount? We are sat
isfied to pay a dollar a month, but after
all the Interest that has been manifested
in our water bill we would like definite
figures.' â  . I ,:'
"The clerk fumbled among some more
tags and- finally imparted the information
that the church during the hottest month
of summer had used 7do gallons of water,
which, at the schedule rates, is of the
value of fifteen cents." â â  : â¢â 
When making a plea before the Council
for the establishment of a minimum rate
for meters, the water company's officials
stated that it was necessary and just be
cause certain parties, notably Chinese
laundrymen, had been detected allowing
their faucets to trickle continually, thus
gaining a large .amount of water, > but In
such a manner that it did not register on
the meter. The church officers, however,
deny that they have descended to ' any
such subterfuge and are much-amused to
find that three nickels Is their Just rate

TO BUILD A NEW SCHOOL,

Be Waged to the Bitter End.

In Claremont,

Landstrom,' taught but seven children,
while her rival, Miss Mintle Gerow,
taught twenty-one In the tent under the
trees near the entrance to the Ainsworth
place. The school in the tent is to be lo
cated in more permanent quarters. Trus
tee Logan, who is the only friend on the

Messrs. Glrard and Earl entered into a

tame. This was renewed < several -^ times
during the evening, and on. more than
one . occasion â¢ the two - representatives
from the Second â¢ Ward shot the ' word

pare for the â¢ election -where they would
not interfere with business.
A resolution to rent quarters for the
poundmaster. was laid over. 'Another
resolution to provide a horse and buggy
for one of the sanitary inspectors' was

vote being against it the matter was laid
over. The ordinance imposing a license
on many kinds of businesses and reducing
the liquor license to $50 from $100 per quar

MONEY TO BE
PICKED UP
Lawyers Desire to Help
Alameda's Treasury.
WANT HALF OF THE BOOTY
THIBTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
OWED BY THE STATE.
Supervisors Will Hold a Special
Meeting to Consider
a the Matter in
Detail.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, Aug. 29.
It Is believed there Is a sum of $30,000
duo Alameda County from the State
treasury on account of rebates and other
charges that have not been refunded to
the county. This matter was called to the
attention of the Board of Supervisors by
ex-Judge Nusbaumer on behalf of Messrs.
Rogers, Paterson & Slack of San Fran
cisco, who offered to do the legal work
In return for 50 per cent of all .money col
lected.
District Attorney Church advised the
Supervisors this morning that they had
full power to employ counsel In the man
ner suggested.
Attorney Nusbaumer warned the board
that unless the money was collected be
fore January 1 the Legislature might pass
a remedial statute putting the money out
of the reach of the county. He said the
attorneys he represented would pay all
expenses and do all work for a contingent
fee. The attorney stated that the officers
who have been handling the revenues of
the State in this county have overpaid the
State, but he could not tell just what
money or what amount had been thus lost
to the county.
Supervisor Church thought the plan a
good one. He said the board would be
under no expense in getting the money, j
and If it was due it should be paid back. !
His remarks were supplemented by Mr.
Nusbaumer, who said it would be just like
finding money.
Supervisor Roeth wanted to know why
this money could not be collected by the
District Attorney, to which Mr. Nus- ;
baumer replied that the District Attorney
could, collect the money, but he would
have to be told where to find It.
Supervisor Mitchell said he had been In
formed that there is about $30,000 to be
thus collected, and he thought that $15,w0
was too much to pay the attorneys. He
suggested that vie board meet as a com- j
mittee of the whole and talk the matter
over, and this suggestion was adopted.

OPIUM FOUND IN
CANS OE LARD
How the Drug Reached
San Quentin.
AUTHORITIES MAKE A HAUL
RECOVER A QUANTITY OF THE
CONTRABAND ARTICLE.
Was Smuggled in by Convicts Who
Were Made to Work on a Farm
Which Supplies the Prison
With Provisions.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Augr. 29.-
It was only last week that the prison
officials were dumfounded at learning
the true status of the opium traffic
as carried on by the convicts inside
the prison walls. Their eyes were then
opened to a realization of the fact that
the trade in the soul-destroying drug
was not confined to a few of the more
vicious element, but that some of the
"trusties" were engaged in smuggling
goodly quantities of the contraband ar
ticle through the gates and dispensing
it to their companions at exorbitant
prices.
Now come to light the facts as to
how the famous ' 'redroom" discovery
happened to be made, showing what
was hitherto known only to the offi
cials in the "higher circle"â that only
a short time ago the authorities made
a haul of the largest quantity of opium
secured in years. It was a clew that
popped up i*n connection with the seiz
ure that led to the "redroom" raid.
About midway on the road leading
from San Quentin to Greenbrae is sit
uated a large farm, the products o{
which find their way to the prison
larder. It Is in charge of J. Jones,
who is entered on the prison payroll
as "farmer" and has the privilege at
any time of asking for a number of
convicts to assist him in his work.
Shortly before the opium was seized
a number of hogs were butchered and
several trusties assisted in preparing
the meat and trying out the lard. The
lard was placed in the ordinary cans
used for the purpose and sent to the
prison.
Certain peculiar actions of the con
victs in handling these cans led to a
quiet investigation. As a result small
quantities of opium were discovered in
three cans. Nothing was said of the
discovery, and it was decided to let the
opium enter the prison in the hope of
making a large seizure.
The vigilance of the officials was re
warded. The next consignment of lard
was searched and a large quantity of
opium found. There were only two
cans out of thirty that had no opium in
them. The aggregate quantity was
about seven pounds.
All this opium must have been hidden
on the farm by accomplices on the out
side. The accurate movements of the
convicts showed, furthermore, that
they must have been In daily commu
nication with the outside dealers. In
spite of the vigilance of the officials
and guards.
It was by keeping a close watch upon
some of the suspected "trusties" that
the opium was found in the "red
room." Other prisoners are under sus
picion, and it is believed the gang of
"opium merchants" Is in a fair way to
be broken up.

Postponement.
GOES EAST TO OBTAIN IT
WOULD LIKE TO RETIRE FROM
THE RING FOR GOOD.
Why the Ex-Champion Sacrificed His
Pompadour for a Society Hair-
Combâ His Future
Movements.
James J. Corbett is willing to keep his
fistic engagement with "Kid" McCoy.
Shortly before leaving for the East last
evening the ex-champion made this state
ment, but added that he would confer
with the directors of the Hawthorne
Athletic Club on his arrival In the me
tropolis with a view to having the con
test postponed.
The famous pugilist's happy and rol
licking spirit has been subdued by the un
timely taking-off of his parents. Traces
of grief are still apparent in his counten
ance and his manner of talking tells that
his thoughts are elsewhere.
"If it were not for the fact that these
men have gone to trouble and expense in
preparing for the contest," said Corbett,
"I would call the match off. Personally I
have spent hundreds of dollars for train
ing: but I would not mind losing the
money. Everybody thinks it but proper
that I should give up the business, and
although I feel as they do, there are some
things that one has no control over
"l telegraphed my manager, George
Constantine, to arrange a meeting with
the tMrectors of the Hawthorne Athletic
Club in New York on Saturday night, so
that we all could discuss the postpone
ment of the affair. I am willing that it
go over as long as they will allow, as the
news of my parents' death has been a sad
blow to me. _
"They want the fight to come off some
time between the 25th of Septpmber and
the Ist of October, and if no further delay
can be Had 1 suppose we will meet then.'
Jims attention was called to the change
in his appearance wrought by sacrificing
his pompadour to the latter-day style of
Darting it in the middle. He explained
the loss of the pompadour by saying that
when in training he wore a cap. which
pressed his hair down. When heated, the
hair naturally parted on either side of
his forehead, and on his return from ex
ercfse one night his wife took a comb and
tried parting his locks, with such good
results that he has allowed It to remain
that way. He is now minus the title
"Pomradour Jim."
Corbett Is looking well, despite his usual
sallow appearance. His eyes are clear,
and beneath his dark coat his muscles
show firm and active.
TIRED OF WAITING.
Board of Trade May Soon Move to
16 Post Street.
The directors of the California State
Board of Trade have about decided that
patience under certain circumstances
Is. not a virtue, but that It is nonsensical.
This conclusion has been induced by the
action, or rather inaction, of the State
Board of Harbor Commissioners. When
the exhibit of the Board of Trade was at
16 Post street it was decided to have It
moved to the Mechanics' Pavilion and
become a part of the big mining fair, af
ter which it was to be kept at the Pa
vilion for a few weeks until the new
quarters at the big ferry building should
be ready for its reception. It has been
at the pavilion ever since. Time and
again Manager J. A. Fllcher has been
before the Board, of Harbor Commission
ers asking for information as to when
the exhibit space and office room would
be ready, and each time the answer led
to the belief that the move could be made
before very long. It was particularly de
sired that the exhibit should be installed
while tho soldiers from the East were
here, the belief being that it would at
tract much attention, which would be
heralded all over 'the United States by
admiring warriors.
Very recently more inquiry was made
on the same lines, and as a move to the
depot seems to be as far away as It was
many months ago, the directors have
about decided to move back into the old
quarters at 16 Post street. If such a
move is made the Board of Trade will
be a little slow about making another
change. The place is centrally located,
and when the exhibit was there before it
attracted much attention. Whether or
not this change will be made will be de
cided within a few days.
In Self-Defense.
Juan Gomez was tried by a Jury yester
day in the United States District Court
on a charge of assault with a deadly wea
pon with intent to commit murder upon
the person of A. Anderson, a sailor on
board the American ship Occidental sev
eral months ago. Gomez and Anderson
had a quarrel, in the course of which
Gomez stabbed and seriously wounded An
derson with a sheath knife. Gomez set
up the plea of self-defense and the jury
believed him, for a verdict of not guilty
â¢was rendered.

SOUBRETTE EDITH HALL TOOK A STAR PART.
Judge Kerrigan as the Heavy Tragedian
Won Applause and a Sweet
Smile.
I DASHING young actress. Miss
/\ Edith Hall, played a star role as
/~\ "the claimant," in Judge Kerri
gan's court room yesterday.
Twelve interested men occupied the
front seats and numbers of other male
spectators lined up behind. The
standing room was all occupied.
Two other women besides Miss Hall
were present, one of them Mrs. Er
nestine Kreling, the proprietress and
manager of the Tivoli Opera House.
She was also In the cast, having most
unwillingly assumed the part of "the
fair defendant." The third lady had a
very small role, merely as companion
to the last one named.
The drama opened with Miss Hall in
a determined attitude, demanding her
salary of Mrs. Kreling. She claimed
$225 for three weeks' salary, stating
that she had signed a year's contract
with the defendant, who was to pay
her 175 per week, and was to assign
her only to soubrette parts. After
forty-two weeks of faithful service,
during which time she did her acts
with spirited energy and success, she
was asked to take the part of the
Pasha's wife In the comic opera of
"Fatinltza." It was not a soubrette's
part, not by a little bit.
"I would not take it!" exclaimed
Miss Hall, with flashing eyes. "Never!
The part was stupid and It did not fit.
Who ever heard of a soubrette as a fat
Pasha's wife!"
The juryâ that is, the front row au
ditors â looked sympathetic, and it was
quite evident that the clever little
actress was gaining gTound. The Idea
that she should be a Pasha's wife did

WARRANT SECURED FOR D. B.
DAVISON'S ARREST.
Accused of Having Broken Faith by
-Selling a Valuable Claim
and Pocketing the
lh Proceeds.
D. B. Davison of the Klondike Gold
Exploration Company, of Colorado
Spring's, Colo., is under arrest in Seattle
on a charge of felony embezzlement pre
ferred In this city by Henry C. Hall, one
of the directors of the company, at pres
ent a truest at the Palace Hotel.
The warrant for Davison's arrest was
sworn to before Superior Judge Cook on
Saturday by Hall, and in the complaint it
is alleged that Davlson embezzled $4000
belonging to the company. Detective
Harry Reynolds left for Seattle yester
day afternoon with the requisition pa
pers for the return of Davison to this
city.
. In the affidavit sworn to by Hall he
states that In July of last year a num
ber of residents of Colorado Springs
formed a syndicate to prospect for gold
in Alaska, and later incorporated under
the name of the Klondike Gold Explora
tion Company, with a capital stock of
$1,000,000. Davison and Gerald M. King
were selected to go to the Klondike to
prospect for gold for one year, and they
entered into a contract with the company
whereby they were each to be paid $100
per month salary, and between them to
hold one-fourth of tha shares in the com
pany. All the gold obtained by them
was to be paid into the bank to the com
pany's credit.
King and Davison were given $2400 for
their outfit and living expenses, and
King, who was treasurer, got also $600,
the balance of Davison's salary for the
year, Davison's wife drawing the other
$600 from bank in monthly installments.
On March 11 last $2500 additional was
sent to King, and about that time Davi
son located a claim on French Gulch. He
worked the claim and took not less than
$5000 in gold dust from it, and reports

not please anybody.
The defendant then spoke: "I gave
her the Pasha's wife because it was a
soubrette's part," she insisted. "Miss
Hall kicked. She refused to take it,
and I was firm. She violated her con
tract and was not entitled to salary,
as she has done nothing since."
Just at this point the heavy trage
dian, in the person of the defendant's
lawyer, made his appearance and di
rected a sharp fire at the claimant.
He said that soubrettes were only in
the world to amuse men and made
some uncomplimentary remarks con
cerning this special class of actresses,
which called forth a sharp protest
from Miss Hall, and which did not find
favor with the audience.
Experts now appeared upon the
stage. Dramatic Critic Ewer walked
over to the side of Miss Hall. Stage
Manager Lask lined up with Mrs.
Krellng. There was a sharp dialogue
pro and con between the experts.
Miss Hall seemed to have the best of
it.
Finally two tragediansâattorneys
came to" the footlights and engrossed
attention. Mr. Lowenthal spoke for
Mrs. Krellng. He said the case was
proved. Miss Hall was not entitled to
any more salary. She had refused a
superior soubrette's part. The Jury
would so decide.
Mr. Regensburger retorted. He was
for Miss Hall. He said: "There never
was a clearer case. Salary' is due and
should be promptly paid. An infe
rior old woman's part was offered and
refused. No soubrette would take it.
The Jury will so decide."
Justice Kerrigan, who had hereto
fore been denied a part In the drama,
grave the amount as high as $20,000. Davl
son sold the claim for J20.000 cash and
came to this city with the proceeds on
the steamer St. Paul, arriving here on
July 17. He took a bag of gold dust to
the Mint and minted It In the name of
D. T. Williams, a roommate on the
steamer, receiving $5000 in gold coin.
The coin was taken to the Bank of Cal
ifornia on August 8 and deposited, and
five certificates of deposit, each for $500,
were Issued by the bank in the name of
Mrs. Laura M. Davlson, his wife. Two
thousand dollars in cash was to be paid
to Davlson, but it is not known what was
done with the remaining $500.
The company, not having heard from
Davlson, sent Hall to this city to en
deavor to ascertain if anything was
known about him. He arrived here on
August 15, and it was by accident that
he found out that Mrs. Davison was at
the Baldwin Hotel. He called upon her,
but she denied knowing anything about
her husband. Hall was suspicious, and
employed private dotectlves on the case.
They ascertained that Davlson secretly
left the city on August 14. and last Sat
urday he was traced to Seattle.
Hall at once communicated with Chief
Lees, and the Chief wired to the Chief
of Police at that city to arrest Davison
and hold him pending the arrival of an
officer with the requisition papers. The
exact amount of Davison's embezzlement
is not known.
TO REWARD PATRIOTISM.
McKinley Veteran Club Suggests a
Silver Medal for Soldiers and
Sailors of the Late War.
The McKlnley Veteran Soldiers' and
Sailors' Republican Club at a 'regular
meeting last night adopted resolutions
Indorsing the platform of the Republican
State Convention and pledging Its mem
bers to the support of the nominees of
the convention.
The club is composed of ex-Union vet
erans and sons of veterans, and holds
in high appreciation the gallant services
rendered by the men of the army and
navy during the war with Spain. It de
monstrated this appreciation -by declar
ing by resolution last night that at the
next session of Congress there should be
formulated and passed a law authorizing
the Government to present a medal of
silver, suitably inscribed, to each and
every member of the army and navy
that served or was musfered into the
service during the war with Spain, and
remains in or has been honorably dis
charged from service. In case of death
the medal is recommended to be given
to the nearest relative of decedent.
The club also indorsed the name of
I^eon E. Jones as a candidate for Sheriff,
urging that he be nominated by the San
Francisco County Convention.

now spoke his lines. He read them
from a paper. He stated that on the
claimant rested the responsibility of
convincing the Jury that the salary
was due. If positive proof was lack
ing, if the soubrette aspect of the con
tract was not fully established, in
short, if the jury had any doubts
that the claimant's statement and
that of the witnesses in her favor
had failed to dissipate, then the ver
dict would be brought in favor of the
defendant.
At 3:45 p. m. the twelve men in the
frÂ«nt seats arose in a body and re
tired, not to take a drink, but to dis
cuss among themselves the merits of
the high class play that they had just
witnessed. It did not take them long
to ascertain that Miss Hall had scor
ed a distinct triumph in her new role
of the "claimant," and was entitled
to salary. Nine out of the twelve so
decided, and the whole party marched
back to see the curtain rise on the
closing act.
Miss Hall smiled her prettiest. She
wore a heightened color, and it added
to the charm of her presence. She
anticipated victory and It came! "We,
the jury, find the claimant is entitled
to salary," was the essence of the
statement. It carried peace and plac
idity to the heart of the soubrette. As
for the defendant, she sat unmoved.
The lawyers promptly added the
final dispute about costs, and the cur
tain fell on the words, "We claim a
stay of execution for five days."
Miss Hall goes to New York as
soon as she gets her money. "I hoped
to go to-night," she said. "There are
several openings there for me, but as
yet I have not accepted any of them."
BUTT'S FATE
IS ROSENAU`S
Autocrats of the Harbor
on Their Knees.
GIVEN A SHARP REPRIMAND
WILL NO LONGER BE ALLOWED
TO HARASS THE COLLECTOR.
Admonished by the Secretary of
the Navy That This Is
America and Not
Russia.
It is understaood that the letter from
the Secretary of the Treasury last week
to Lieutenant Butt, reprimanding him for
the non-performance of his duty as com
mander of Golden Gate, the cus
toms boat, whs accompanied by a letter
of similar tenor addressed to Federal
Quarantine Officer Rosenau for the high
handed manner in which he hns ignored
the orders of the Collector of the Port.
As a result of this action on tho part
of the department the customs officials
believe they will be enabled to perform
the duties of their respective offices with
out being further harassed by what they
term the dictatorial and Impertinent In
terference of the Federal Quarantine Of
ficer.
Ever since State Quarantine Officer
Chalmers was removed to a more distant
and more agreeable sphere of Influence,
Dr. Rosenau out-Heroded Herod, in fact
out-Chalmered Chalmers in the facility
with which he succeeded in making him
self an obstruction and a nuisance to the
customs inspectors. By misrepresenting
matters to the Treasury Department he
managed to obtain a ruling In his favor
in the matter of a dispute, a few months
ago, but the effect of this ruling was
marred subsequently by a full report pre
pared by Surveyor of Customs Spear and
his chief deputy, Chauncey Moriarlty St.
John, in which all the facts were pre
sented. Butt and Rosenau had stood in
together, so far as appearances went,
and seemed to have formed an alliance
to ha>ve things their own way on the
bay, irrespective of the wishes of the
customs officials. The downfall of Butt's
pride did not precede that of Rosenau by
a very long period of time. An investi
gation was made by the Treasury De
partment on the representations made by
the Surveyor of the Port and the truth
came to light. The caustic letter to Butt
followed, and was accompanied, it Is re
ported, by one addressed to the obstinate
doctor.
The climax was brought about by the
doctor's characteristic action in the mat

ter of the arrival of the Abble M. Deer
ing from Lynn, Mass. The Deering had
no passengers and was destined for St.
Michael. On the way out she stopped at
Bahia. Brazil, where there was some
sickness among the population. She ar
rived in San Francisco Bay on April 17,
of this year, 107 days from Bahla. There
was no one sick on board and the ves
sel was not subject to quarantine under
the statute, which provides, among other
things, that quarantine shall be enforced
on vessels having sailed from an Infected
port within thirty days.
The customs inspectors went on board
and performed their duty. When Rose
nau, who was late learned of their ac
tion, he sent a false and inflammatory
telegram to Washington to the effect that
the Abbie had arrived with several cases
of yellow fever and smallpox, and that
more than 200 persons had died from
those diseases; that the customs officers
had boarded the vessel and taken away
the papers so that the quarantine officer
was unable to perform his duty in the
matter.
When the affair was Investigated by the
authorities it was found there was no
case of disease of any kind on board the
Abbie and that nobody had died on board.
The doctor's explanation that he had in
tended to say that all those diseases and
all those deaths had been at Bahia and
not on the vessel did not avail him. for
it was evident that the intention of the
telegram was to alarm the department
The detection of this misrepresentation
brought down upon his head a stinging
rebuke from the Treasury- Department.
In addition to the complaints filed
against Rosenau were several in protest
against the doctor's action in destroying
several hundred dollars' worth of lemons
and other fruit by fumigating on ship
board without having takfn proper pre
cautions. It is expected that the officials
will have no more trouble from the acts
of Butt and his friend Rosenau.

NOTABLE FEAT
IN SURGERY
Remarkable Operation at
the County Hospital.,
JOHN RENNIE'S FIGHT FORLIFE
CANCER REMOVED UNDER DIF
FICULT CIRCUMSTANCES.
The Hight Half of the Stomach and
Several Inches of the
Large Intestine Cut
Away.
Hereafter John Rennie of 120 Second
street must struggle along with only half
a stomach and several inches less Intes
tines than he began life with. Rennie,
who is 50 years of age. was removed to
the City and County Hospital on the 7th
of the present month, suffering from
what he supposed to be some disorder of
the stomach, but which proved to be a
cancer of large dimensions.
Rennie was first placed In the medical
ward where he remained for several daya
until the physicians could accurately di
agnose his case, and then he was trans
ferred to the surgical ward, for it was
apparent that only an operation of the
most delicate nature could save his life.
Some days were necessary to prepare
the patient for the ordeal, and last Fri
day the surgeons pronounced the condi
tions favorable, and Rennie was placed
on the operating table. Drs. Ellinwood
and Rlxford, assisted by Drs. Trenholtz,
Hoffman and Gibbons, performed the op
eration, or rather xthe double operation,
known to the surgical world as pyloric
tomy and gastroentrotomy.
An incision was made in the abdominal
cavity, and the cancer located at the
junction of the stomach and large Intes
tine, completely surrounding the open
ing. It was found necessary to remove
the entire right half of the stomach as
well as the Intestine for several inches
from the junction, and this rendered im
perative the second operation of gastro
entrotomy. At the point where the first
operation was performed the intestine is
attached to the abdominal wall so tightly
as to be immovable, and It was necessary
to sew up both the stomach and intestine.
Then the surgeons picked up the latter
about six inches from where it had been
severed and where it is movable, and
making an incision there as well as in
the lower part of the stomach, joined the
two artificial openings, thus shortening
the channel something more than a foot
in all The abdominal cavity was then
closed and the patient again placed In his
cot He rallied rapidly and now eats
freely and retains and digests his food,
showing that the wound has healed and
the new channel performing its function.
Yesterday Rennie' s temperature was
nearly normal, and the physicians pro
nounced his chances of recovery- better
than even. ,
While the operation Rennie has under
gone has been performed before, it is
quite rare, and the conditions are neces
sarily such as to make it extremely haz
ardous. In the first place the prox
imity to the solar plexus renders it
exceedingly difficult for the surgeons to
operate without affecting that spot, for
the slightest touch would cause almost
certain death. Then the danger from
peritonitis is great, for the escape of
any of the germs from the open stom
ach into the system would bring on that
complication. But, thanks to the sur
geon's skill, Rennie escaped that dan
ger, and if all continues well he will t>Â«
as hearty as ever in a few weeks.
COMMERCE IN DANGER.
Important Dispatch Sent to the Am
erican-Canadian Commission.
From all appearances something has
happened at the American-Canadian con
ference in Quebec that nas caused some
alarm on the part of certain commercial
bodies In the eastern part of the United
States. The following dispatch was re
ceived yesterday from Boston by Hugh
Craig, president of the local Chamber ol
Commerce:
There Is great danger that the pressure
brc%ught to bear by certain special industries
against any concessions to Canada affecttn*
those interests may defeat commercial reciproc
ity with Canada. Please -wire American Com
missioners now sitting in Quebec, urging that
consideration of special interests will not bÂ«
permitted to prevent the negotiations of a
commercial treaty that shall secure to the
two countries the broadest possible measure of
reciprocity. I'rgently necessary that telegram
be sent at once.
VT. F. ROBINSON,
President Boston Chamber of Commerce.
Neither Mr. Craig nor Secretary Scott
have any idea of the nature of the danger
alluded to, but the president at once sent
this dispatch:
Senator Charles W. Fairbanks. Chairman
United States High Commission, In Conference,
Quebec, Canada: The Chamber of Commerce
of San Francisco urges the United States High
Commissioners that no consideration of special
interests shall be permitted to prevent the ne
gotiation of a commercial treaty with our
Canadian cousins upon the broadest possible
measures of reciprocity. They are our very
best foreign customers, purchasing more per
capita than any ether nation, consuming ex
actly what we manufacture for our own use.
Make the reciprocal arrangements such that
in a few years their own interests shall prompt
them to knook for admission as an integral
part of the United StatÂ«x>.; that the flag may
fly from the Rio Gran.le to the Arcticâ "na
flag one language, one tariff, one Government.
