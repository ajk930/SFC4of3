IPONCE, Porto Rico, Aug. 2 (by Call-
Herald dispatch boat to St. Thomas, D.
W. 1., Aug. 3).â American troops under
General Stone have been given a hearty
welcome to Adjuntas. Members of
the Fire Department there have
been armed by the Americans andnow
are acting as a local police force.' There
Is a disposition among the country peo
ple to torture the Spaniards, but the
Americans will not tolerate such a
course. . ; ; â 
In Juan Diaz and Cnamo the officials
have greeted the Invading forces as de
liverers, and American flags have been
raised over the principal buildings in
both places, .
IÂ£ is. General Stone's plan to advance
from Adjuntas to the northern coast of
Porto Rico as rapidly as possible. He
is making, his way toward Areclbo, in
the northern part of the island, at
which point the Spaniards have been
landing supplies, for there has been a
blockade of Areclbo and the Spaniards,
taking advantage of that fact, have
been landing supplies there without
hindrance. A railroad extends from
Arecibo to San Juan, and by this
method it has been possible to keep the
capital well supplied with all neces
sary articles. General Stone, by tak
ing possession of Arecibo, will be able
to prevent the transportation of fur
ther supplies to San Juan and the pre
dicament of the Spanish troops there
will be thus made most desperate.
Three vessels of the American fleet
operating about Porto Rico have been
ordered away. They are the Massachu
setts, Columbia and New York. The
Columbia, which grounded on a reef
near Guanica, has been taken off in
deep water again and all three vessels
have gone to Guantanamo.

BLOCKADE RUNNER
TAKEN INTO PORT
Clever Capture of a Spanish Schooner
by the Little Steam Launch.
of the Gunboat
Bancroft.
KET WEST, Aug. 3. â The Nor
wegian steamer Franklin of about 500
tons, bound from Vera Cruz with a
cargo of food supplies, was captured by
the converted yacht Siren on Monday
off Francis Key, near Calbarien, and
was brought here to-day by a prize
crew under command of Lieutenant
Littlefield. She had already landed a
portion of her cargo when caught.
The converted yacht Eagle, under
command of Lieutenant Southerland,
which arrived from the blockade off the
Isle of Pines on the south coast of Cuba
this afternoon, brings an interesting
story regarding the capture of a email
Spanish schooner by the crew of the
Bancroft. The Bancroft's steam launch,
unaided, effected the capture in Sigua
nea Bay, Isle of Pines, while the Ban
croft and the Eagle were reconnoitering
at Maugh Point, farther up the catst.
The little schooner, in charge of the
boatswain's mate and one seaman, was
sent to an anchorage near the place
where the steamer Santo Domingo was
sunk some time ago while attempting
to run the blockade.
Two hours later upon the arrival of
the Eagle and the Bancroft at their
anchorage the little prize was observed
close up to the wreck of the Santo Do
mingo with the Spanish flag flying at
her masthead. On the schooner's deck
several men could be seen, indicating
that the vessel had been recaptured by
the Spaniards.
Captain Clover immediately sent the
Maple to the rescue. On arriving along
side he ascertained that the mate in
charge of the prize had, by a clever
ruse, captured two more boats with
their crews, which were stripping the
Santo Domingo. Seeing wreckers at
work the mate had hoisted the Spanish I
flag, and, sailing close enough to the
Spaniards to get them under range of
his rifles he demanded and received the
surrender of the two boats and their
six occupants.
SPAIN'S REPLY
IN THE HANDS
OF McKJNLEY
Agrees to the General Terms as Laid
Down in the Note prom the
President.
SeeKs to Obtain Concessions on Certain Points,
but porn)al AcceptaQce Is Not Far
Distant.
NEW YORK, August 3.â The Washington correspondent of the Herald sends the
following: An early peace is assured. Spain's reply, formally presented to the President
late this afternoon by Embassador Cambon, leaves no further room for doubt that she
will accept the general terms as to the conditions for a cessation of hostilities laid down in
the President's note. Formal acceptance is all that is lacking. And while Embassador
Cambon is still arguing for additional concessions and asking for the details of the gen
eral terms proposed by the President his interview with Mr. McKinley to-day left no fur
ther room for doubt that a treaty of peace at an early date would be the result of the
pending negotiations.
It is probable several notes will be exchanged with Madrid before the treaty of peace
is finally confirmed. While Spain's latest communication leaves no room for doubt that
it is her intention to accept the general propositions laid down by the President she is,
through Embassador Cambon, arguing several important points.
For instance, the Sagasta Ministry wants to know what is to be done to prevent
the insurgents carrying on the war and committing outrages in other parts of the Phil
ippines while the United States occupies Manila and the immediate surrounding territory.
Spain wants more details as to the evacuation of Cuba. She insists that her soldiers
should leave both Cuba and Porto Rico with all the honors of war, and that the evacu
ation is not to be considered in the light of a surrender. The question of transportation
of her troops â who is to pay the bills and which nation is to preserve order in the island
pending evacuationâ are also matters touched upon in Spain's note.
There are no material changes, however, in the general terms proposed by Presi
dent McKinley, and as Spain has, clearly indicated a willingness to accept these terms
the authorities confidently expect to-night there will be an official announcement of a
cessation of hostilities before the end of the week.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 3.â After a
conference on the peace question last
ing just an hour this afternoon between
the President and M. Cambon, the
French Embassador, the latter acting
as the representative of Spain, Secre
tary Day emerged from the White
House and announced that to-day's
conference was Inconclusive, where
fore the parties to it had agreed tosay
nothing to the public as to what had
occurred. The Secretary did not ap
pear to be discouraged as he made this
statement, though he admitted that no
time had been set for another confer
ence.
From this it is gathered that the long
expected answer of the Spanish Gov
ernment to the President's note, upon
being received, had turned out to be

None of His Ships Fit to Go Into

NEW YORK, Aug. 3.â A dispatch to
the Tribune from Gibraltar says:
It is now an open secret that not a
single fighting ship of Admiral Cama

given out, the firing gear and turrets
of the Carlos V are unmanageable, the
Audaz is completely used up by the re

lamentably defective.
In case of any hitch in the peace ne

that the Spanish answer had not been

that has come to hand was one from
the Madrid Cabinet to M. Cambon, ask

that were not clear to the Spanish Min
isters. However, just after 3 o'clock the
Secretary of the French Embassy, M.
Thiebaut, called at the State Depart

possible. The meeting was set for 3:45

The garrison at Cadiz now consists

Intended Treasure-Seekers Sell Their
Outfits and Attempt to Reach

VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 3.â The
steamer Manuense arrived from St.
Michael, Alaska, to-day with 260 pas
sengers and between $150,000 and $200,
000 in gold dust. Of the list of pas
sengers only thirty-four were miners
who had spent as much as one winter
in the mines, the remainder being
those" who had gone there this spring
and concluded not to remain. The pas
sengers all agreed in the statement that
hundreds of men are arriving in St.
Michael daily from Dawson and vicin
ity seeking passage to the States, and
that there are upward of 1000 men in
that part who have lately come from
coast ports and are trying to get up
the river. Many are turning back af
ter learning the conditions at Dawson
and up river points.
A larger part of the Manuense"s pas

separated, having been unable to reach
a conclusion as to the acceptance by
Spain of the peace conditions laid
down by the President and binding
themselves to the observance of the
strictest secrecy as to the proceedings
until further progress had been made.
Thus it is practically assured In ad
vance that any attempt to state what
occurred at to-day's meeting at the
White House will be nothing more than
pure guesswork.
Meantime, in consonance with the de
clared purpose of the President at the
beginning of the overtures, this confer

The hotels on the shore are nightly
taxed to their utmost capacity in ac

craft in the harbor is utilized as a tem

been found on Kotzebue and Norton
Sound, too, adds to the discourage
ment of the general multitude.
In the harbor of St. Michael are
thirty-five steamers and sailing vessels,
all heavily laden with passengers, gen
eral cargo and knockdown river boats.
Several steamers have large lists of
passengers who purchased tickets di
rect to Dawson and other up-river
points, and on arriving learned that
arrangements had not been made for
their river transportation. The steam

PROMOTIONS ASSURED
HEROES OF THE NAVY

NEW YORK. Aug. 3.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says:
Full recognition of the meritorious gal
lant conduct displayed by American offi
cers and men during the existing war
Is given by President McKinley. That
there may be no just cause for con* lalnt
that the Navy Department overlooked
any meritorious cases Secretary Long
proposes to appoint a board of ranking
navy officers which shall carefully inves
tigate numerous cases brought to its at
tention and report tho cases of the men
to be advanced for heroic service. The
instructions under which the board, will
act will be carefully drawn. It Is not
intended that it shall pass upon the acts
of officers of flag rank or captains. The
President and Secretary Long feel they
can determine for themselves whicn of
these officers are entitled to recognition.
From the present indications the Presi
dent will promote Commodore Schley and
Acting Rear Admiral Sampson in the
order named anu the captains of ships
which participated in the battle with Cer

America May Find It Necessary
to Conquer the Native
Hordes.
' .'WASHINGTON", Aug. 3.â An Inter
est ing question and one of vital im
portance to the administration is the
. attitude to be assumed by the United
States toward the Philippine insurgents
-In the event that we reach an agree
' ment for the suspension of hostilities
â with Spain. 1 It is stipulated In. our
peace terms that the United States
military forces shall occupy and estab
lish a military form of government over
. the city of Manila and the bay, with the
â  surrounding territory. This involves an
immediate surrender of the Spanish
â  forces, riot to Aguinaldo, but to General
AT^rritt, and there is now apprehension
that the insurgents will resent this bit
terly and that It will be necessary to
' expel them forcibly from the territory
described. \
rCtÃeyocd this, it is said in some quar
ters that pending the decision of the
peace commissioners as to the future of
the Philippines, the United States will
be morally bound to maintain the statu
quo in the island at large. In other
- words, having deprived Spain of the
; means of resisting the onslaughts of
the insurgents, it has been urged that
the United States would be bound to
prevent the latter continuing their
â¢warfare.
There is a lack of information in
[Washington on many important points
as to the conditions in the Philippines.
It is not known, even
approximately, how extensive the revo
lutionary movement has been through
out the vast group of 1200 islands and
among the large population, estimated
to aggregate between 8,000,000 and 15,
000.000. If the revolutionary movement
is general and extends to very many of
the. islands, the task presented to the
United States military and naval au
thorities will be one of great magni
tude, in the event that it is decided to
be incumbent on us not to restore Span
ish sovereignty where it has been lost,
but to prevent its overthrow in sections

TACOMA, Aug. 3. â An enormous sal

Sound, causing rejoicing among can

none to pack. Last Tuesday, however,
ttie situation changed and fish have
been appearing In larger numbers
steadily since. The present run is of

Ma-uag.-r Morgan of the Pacific
Northwest Packing Company estimates
this year's pack at SO per cent of last
year's. Considering the lateness of the
'season cannerymen will be well satis
tied with the result. Last year's run
was phenomenal, it being a "fourth"
year, and every fourth year salmon al
ivays appear in greater numbers. Prices
are expected to be good, because of aji

here as giving Spain a chance to re

a leading editorial to-morrow, will say:
Mr. McKinley was forced into war. Is j
he now going to be forced into short-Jived
peace? From the outbreak of .this war
the Herald has. urged that it be made de
cisive; that when peace is concluded it i
should be a permanent one and not
fraught with dangerous possibilities for
the future. This is still a pressing ne
cessity. Peace must be arranged upon
a secure basis. If the Philippine prob
lem is not settled with clearness, firmness
and courage we shall have a heritage of
contention, misunderstanding and dispute.
Dewey's guns shattered Spanish sover- |
eignity . when they destroyed Montiio's
fleet. The destiny of the Philippines then |
fell into American hands. The United ,
States owes to itself. to the !
civilized nations of the world,
not to withdraw from the position !
her victories have won for her. Unless
we keep a firm hold on the Philippines
there can be no assurance either for the !
United States or Europe. Already Ger- i
many and Russia are looking upon the
Philippines with longing eyes as they did
upon poor China, Without the strong i
protecting arm of the United States the
Islands would become as weak as China,
and like it a prey to European greed.
The inevitable consequence would be war
and war in which England, and the United
States would be Involved. â¢ â 
Gratitude to our kin across the sea as
well as our own national welfare demands
that we do everything to avert such a
war and maintain the peace of the world.

HEADQUARTERS OF THE FIRST
DIVISION OF THE FIFTH ARMY
CORPS, NEAR SANTIAGO DE CUBA,
July 22 (Correspondence 1 of the Asso
ciated Press).â Major General Shatter
having authorized the publication of
the official report of Brigadier General
J. Ford Kent of the battle of July 1, 2
and 3, a certified copy of the report is
now furnished to .the Associated. Press.
' In his report, which is dated July 7,
General Kent, after detailing the move
ments which brought on the battle of
July 1, gives the first official statement
covering certain incidents of that en
gagement. 3 *
. During the advance General Kent re
ports the division suffered .heavy losses,
caused by the balloon near by attract
ing the enemy's fire and disclosing the
position of the division. Describing the
lighting in the vicinity of the main ford
of the. San Juan River the report says:
â  The enemy's infantry lire, steadily in
creasing in Intensity, now came from all
directions, not only from the front and the
dense tropical' thickets on our flanKÃ, but
from sharpshooters thickly posted in trees
in our rear, and from shrapnel, apparent
ly aimed at the balloon.
Lieutenant Colonel Derby' of Shatter's
staff met me about this time and inform
ed me that a trail or narrow way had
been discovered from the balloon a short
distance leading to the left of the ford,
lower down the stream. I hastened to the
forks made by this road and soon after '
the Seventy-first New York Regiment of
Hawkins' brigade came up. I turned
them into the by path indicated by Lieu
tenant Colonel Derby, leading to the
lower ford, sending word to General Haw
kins of this movement. This would have,
speedily delivered them into their proper
place on the left of their brigade, but un
der the galling- fire of the enemy the
leading battalion of this regiment was
thrown into confusion and recoiled in dis
order on the troops in the rear. " '.'.'.; :
At this critical moment the officers of
my staff practically formed a cordon be
hind the panic-stricken 'men ami urged
them : to again go forward. I finally order- j
ed them to lie down in the thicket and ;
clear' the way for others, ' of their own
regiment,' who were coming up behind.
This many of them did, and the Second
and. Third battalions â¢ -came forward in
better order and moved along the â¢ road
toward the ford. â '*:":
One of my staff officers ran back, wav
ing his hat to hurry forward the Third j
Brigade, who, upon approaching . the, I
forks; found the way blocked by men of ;
the Seventy-first New York. There were ;
Other men of this regiment crouching in |
the bushes, many of whom were encour
aged by the advance of the approaching
column to arise and go forward, â  . .. Â
As -already stated,- I 'had received orders
some- time before to keep in â  the rear of
the cavalry division. Their -advance was
much slower, resulting in frequent halts,
presumably to drop their blanket rolls
and due to the natural delay in, fording
a stream. .
â¢These delays, under a galling fire, grew
exceedingly irksome, and I therefore
pushed the head of my division as quick
ly as I 'could toward the river in column
or.files of twos paralleled on the narrow,
way by the cavalry. This quickened the
following movement and enabled me to"
get into position as speedily as possible
for the attack. â¢" Owing to the congested
condition of the road the progress" of the
narrow column was, however, painfully
slow!- . .:^c
â¢ I again sent a staff officer at a gallop
to urge forward the troops' in the rear.
The head of Wyckoff's brigade reached
the forks at 12:20 p. m. and hurried on
the left, stepping over prostrated forms
of men of the Seventy-first. This heroic j
brigade, consisting of the Thirteenth,
Ninth and- Twenty-fourth. United States
Infantry, speedily, crossed the stream and
were quickly deployed to the left of the
lower ford. While personally superintend
ing this movement. Colonel Wyckoff was
killed, the command of the brigade then
devolving upon Lieutenant Colonel
Worth, Thirteenth Infantry, who imme
diately fell, severely wounded, and then
upon Lieutenant Colonel Liscum, Twen
ty-fourth Infantry, who, five 'minutes
later, also fell under the withering fire of
the enemy; The command of the brigade
then devolved- upon Lieutenant Colonel
T. P. Ewers, Ninth Infantry. V;\
Meanwhile I had again sent a staff of
ficer to hurry forward the Second Brig
ade, which was bringing up the rear.
The Tenth and Second Infantry, soon ar
riving at the forks; were deflected to
the left to follow the Third ! Brigade,
while the Twenty-first was directed along
the main road to support Hawkins.
Crossing the lower ford a few minutes
later, the Tenth and Second moved for
ward in column in good order toward the
green knoll already referred to as my
objective on the left. Approaching the
knoll the regiments deployed/passed over
the knoll and descended the high ridge
beyond, driving back the enemy in the
direction of his trenches. I observed this
move from the fort on San Juan hill.
Colonel E. P. Pearson, Tenth Infantry,
commanding the Second Brigade, and of
ficers and troops under his command, de
serve great credit for the soldierly man
ner in which this movement was S exe
cuted. I earnestly recommend Colonel
Pearson for promotion.
Prior to this advance of the Second Bri
gade, the Third, connecting with Haw
kins" gallant troops on the right, moved
toward Fort San Juan, sweeping through
a zone of most destructive fire," scaling
the : steep and difficult hill and assisting
in capturing the enemy's strong position.
Fort San Juan, at 1:30 p. m. This crest
was about 125 feet above the general
level and was defended by deep trenches
and a loopholed brick fort, surrounded by
barbed wire. â  .
The greatest credit is due to the offi
cers of my command, whether company,
battalion, regiment or brigade com
manders, who so admirably directed the
formation of their troops, unavoidably
intermixed In the dense thicket, and
made the desperate rush for the distant
and strongly defended crest. .
General Kent praises the members
of his staff and urges that they should
at least be brevetted for gallantry un
der fire, and he particularly praises
the conduct of T. J. Kirkpatrick, as
sistant surgeon, on duty with the
Twenty-fourth Infantry, and First
Lieutenant J. D. Miley, Fifth Artillery,
aid to General Shatter. The conduct of
Brigadier General H. S. Hawkins is
also highly commended.
SOLANO'S GREATEST FIRE.
VACAVILLE. Aug. 3.â A fierce fire has
been raging in this vicinity s'nee July 27.
It started northwest of town at the head
of Miller's Canyon, within two miles of
Pirtha Creek, and has been burning ever
since. Between 30.000 and 40,000 acres have
been burned over and eight houses, and
as many barns and about 400 cords of
wood destroyed, to say nothing of the loss
of fences. The intense heat caused by the
flames has ruined half the grape crop and
damaged fruit trees In the valley to the
extent of at least $TiOOO. Hundreds of wild
animals of all kinds have been driven out
of the forests into the vicinity of farm
houses and cultivated fields. It Is cer
tainly the most disastrous fire that ever
occurred in Solano County.

The Oaks and Beeches Bismarck
Loved So Well to Canopy
His Tomb.
Special cable to The Call and the New Tork
Herald. Copyrighted, 1888, by JaraeÂ« Gor
don Bennett.
FRIEDRICHSRUHE, Aug. 3.â The
publication of Bismarck's memoirs Is
most unlikely for. years to oome, as
this has been left entirely In the hands
of Prince Herbert, and gratification of
public curiosity is about the last thing
in the world to influence him. Lothar
Brecher told me before he died that
Bismarck's memoirs consisted then of
two bulky volumes, already complete
in themselves, and that one would be
published during the Prince's lifetime
and another after his death. These
dispositions were as Indicated above
and altered since Lothar Brecher died.
Dr. Schweninger quitted Friedrlchs
ruhe at midnight. Before he left we
strolled up the hill together, on which
the mausoleum will be built, and sat
down on a rude -wooden bench on
which Bismarck rested, where he used
to lean on his stick and gaze over the
valley, and where, sitting -with Dr.
Schweninger, the idea struck him that
he would like to be buried at that par
ticular spot.
"Yes," the doctor mused, "here he
will have a cathedral all to himself,
arched over by the oaks and beeches
ho loved so well."
Dr. Schweninger tells me that his
life's work was over when Bismarck
died. This was his sacred task,
guarding that precious life. Bis
marck's bright humor occasionally
shone forth in all its radiance until the
last, but his animal spirits visibly de
clined during the final few montb.3.
The complete isolation in which he
lived added materially to depress him.
He used to long for Schweninger to
come. "I am glad you have come. I
turn to others, but they do not under
stand me; what I say is to them like
water running down the back of a peli
can," he would declare sadly.
One of the saddest features connect
ed with the last few months of his lite
was that his favorite hounds, his fond
est companions, died before him. No
one remains to-day to whine and sor
row beside his bier.

death of the man whom God, the Lorn,

the realization of the undying aspira

When Prince Herbert declined a sec
ond time the Emperor's proffer of a
grave in the Berlin Cathedral his Maj
esty indicated a plan for a national
monument. It is understood he pro
poses to place in the cathedral an im
mense marble sarcophagus, with the
figure of Bismarck in the uniform of a
cuirrassier.
Rather an unseemly wrangle has
arisen in the press concerning the ex
act causes and circumstances of the
Prince's death, and the fact that no
autopsy was held makes it impossible
to silence scandal-loving tongues.
Professor Virchow. interviewed on the
subject, declined to express an opinion
on the vague information available, but
said he was disposed to think that the
death of the Prince was painless.

NKW YORK, Aug. 3.â Accounts
the condition of affairs in Havana,
M.-itanzas and Cardenas have been
given by passengers of the steamer
Fridtjof Xansen, which has arrived
, from Sagua. She brought twenty-nine
refugees^ most of whom are Spaniards,
â¢who had made all sorts of sacrifices
to escape from the island in anticipation
of its being controlled by the insur
" gents. Many of them were well sup
plied with funds, having turned all
their available property into cash. They
paid $250 each for passage.
â  /Almost all those aboard being Span- |
ish sympathizers, a meAing was held i
In the saloon, while the ship was off
Bnrnegat, X. J., at which a majority
pledged themselves to refuse to give
â any information to Americans regard
ing the condition of things in Cuba, A |
fpw, however, consented to talk after |
thfy got ashore, but they were unwill
ing to permit their names to be used.
â  ; One woman who had reached Sagua j
by rail from Havana said that the con
dition of affairs In the capital was de
7\7 \ '.arable and v. - as daily growing worse.
. "There i.s ]!>nty of money," she said,
''but of what use Is it when It will hard-
ly -purchase anything? It is Impossible
to get beef at any price, ' and even
: horse flesh costs' sl a pound. .Bread

O'Reilly streets o are closed, as are the
GOOD men at the beginning; that he
took Ocos and San Marcos; that his
army has constantly grown by . deser
tions from the Government forces, and
that he Is rapidly advancing on the
capital.
Many men are being shot and Im
prisoned by Cabrera. Jose Leon Cas
tillo, leader in last year's insurrection
and now a candidate for President,
took refuge some days ago in the Mex
ican legation.
Last night . General Mendezabal.
commander of Barrios' forces last
year, died suddenly. He was sum
moned from his. plantation by Presi
dent Estrada yesterday ana died two
hours after the interview with the
President. His friends say he was
poisoned. He was most popular in
Guatemala. . . '
Last Saturday the President pro
claimed the country in a. state of siege.
Friends of Estrada Cabrera claim Mo
rales is backed by the Mexican Gov
ernment, and that his is a move to an
nex Guatemala to Mexico.
Morales. 4s reported to have a strong
force of Mexicans .with him as well as
foreigners of all nations. They have
plenty of munitions of. war, besides a
good supoly of field artillery.

Juan Zarragra Sarte said:
"I do not know anything 1 of the con
ditions In . Havana, but I do know
that there Is much misery at Cardenas
and Matanzas. Things, however,
might be worse, considering the strin
gency of the blockade. Much starva
tion has been avoided by the foresight
of the merchants, who. In. anticipation
of the outbreak of the war, laid in large
stores of provisions. 'Of course they
have sold at high prices, and I h^afd

ar-lval the Columbia will be given or

designated by Rear Admiral Sampson,
tie Massachusetts will be attached to
Commodore Watson's command and UiQ
Newark will, it Is said to-night, rece.vc
the Hag of Commodore Schley. lnia
ivonns that Commodore Schley will rs

be attached to Commodore Watsons

It is expected that it will be necessary
to make a few repairs to the Massachu
setts and when these are completeu the
Eastern squadron will be ready to start
ab-< ad. The retention of several armor
clads In American waters is conslde.-i
nest significant by naval officers with
whom I talked to-day, especially wh^ii
tnken :n conjunction with the repeated
statements of Secretary Long and other
officials that the original orders to the
fleet had not been modified. If the ad
ministration carries out its plan of dis
patching strong reinforcements to the
Philippines It will be a notice to all
Europe that the United States does not
propose to let any foreign complications
grow out of the final settlement in re
gard to the Islands.

IUI H l\l those who use thesr
liliill strength In a sensible
way never suffer as
those do who are foolish and goto
excess. There would be no weak
back, no weak kidneys, no puniness,
no dyspepsia, no prematurity, no
nervous disorders and no half men
but for the fact that so many peo-
ple do not use nature properly.
They abuse their powers.
fljl How many men can It be
I H said, "He Is perfect In
Ul strength?" Few Indeed,
Yet It should be true of all
the human race. Seeing that so
many men are weaklings, the Hud-
sonlan physicians spent years of
research finding a remedy. It has
long since been accomplished. It
Is "Hudyan." This great remedio-
treatment makes up to nature what
she loses from excesses.
TTTTIjI Is one thing weaklings
II I Jl/I have not. "Hudyan" fills
I llfl the system with It. Fire
they lack. "Hudyan"
produces It. "Hudyan" brings
sweet, refreshing sleep ; It brings
life and strength. 20,000 men
have been cured by It Write and
ask for absolutely free circulars
arid testimonials telling you all
about Its grand work. It will cure
you. It will make you a man.
_i
Those little ulcers that you see in your
mouth indicate blood taint. So do copper-
colored spots, falling out of hair and
outer things. "30-day blood cure" purifies
the system, drives every particle of the
poison out. Tertiary, secondary and pri-
mary forms all yield. No bad after ef-
fects. Ask for free "30-day" circulars.
And ask to-day.

PETTY SCHEMING
ONCE MORE FAILS
Each Separate Newspaper Bun
dle Must Carry a War Tax
Stamp.
WASHINGTON, 'Aug. 3.â "Wells, FargtJ & Co. are not to have things
their own way. No sooner was the war tax Imposed than they sought
to evade Its provisions. After an obstinate . strusrgle they have been
compelled to yield on one or two points and bear their Just share of
the war tax. .
Now comes a ruling to-tiny from Commissioner of Internal Rev
enue Scott that forces the express company once more to come to
time. It has been the contention of Wells, Fargo & Co. that where
a newspaper ships bundles of papers to its agents throughout Cali
fornia and other coast States but one bill of lading shall be issued for
each wagon load, the company refusing to issue a bill of lading for
each package. The ruling Is made on the appeal of the intelligencer
Publishing Company of Wheeling, W. Va. The Commissioner de*.
cides with regard to newspapers that the general bundle must have
one destination and packages cannot be taken therefrom and deliv
ered at intermediate points. â¢ â¢
The Intent of the art is ruled to be that each bundle, having a dif
ferent destination, should have a different bill of lading, and. conse
quently, its appropriate stamp. It Is, therefore, advised that each
package for each place should have Its bill of lading and its one cent
stamp.

GOLD HUNTERS
COMING HOME
Flocking in Droves From
Copper River.
SAME OLD STORY OF M 0 DUST
FIVE OAKLANDERS ARRIVE AT
JUNEAU.
Tell of the Straggling Mass of Hu
manity on the Valdez Glacier
and the Perils They Are
Subjected To.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
.JUNEAU, Alaska, July 28 (by Steam
ship Oregon to. Seattle, Aug. 3).â The
steamship Excelsior came in this even
ing and 130 more Copper River kickers
walked ashore here. The Oregon came
in s"nÂ«n after, bound south, and nearly
all of them, taking advantage of. a
special rate, left for the Sound on her.
Chasers of. the golden fleece are now
flocking back over the glacier from the
Copper River Valley in droves, taking
advantage of the remaining short sea
son only during which it is possible to
go either backward or forward.
W. Luckman of Oakland, Cal., Bays
there were not less than 1000 men on
the glacier and traveling for it when
he came out seven days ago. He says
that by this time there must be between
300 and 400 . at Valdez waiting for a
steamer. The price of grub has fallen
and this fact makes it more difficult,
in fact almost Impossible, for men who
have no money to- sell their outfits for
money to pay their passage home.
Flour, for instance, en the other side
of the glacier is $1 per sack and coffee
5 cent per pound. All other passengers
have the same story of no gold and
hard luck to tell, and all agree that
they might as well attempt to swim up
Niagara Falls as to get any kind of a
boat up the. Copper River, which is a
roaring torrent.
Two soldiers built a bridge across a
small stream. The bridge was washed
away and the soldiers remained an
the farther side for three days and
nearly starved to death because it was
not possible . to wade the stream or
otherwise get assistance to them. Cap
tain Abercrombie and his men are now
attempting to make a trail that will
make the exodus easier.
Others from Oakland besides Luck
man are B. Lueneburg, H. li. Schnoor.
F Coons and Al Wiseman. They were
among the party of forty-four which
left Oakland on the schooner Laulnfa,
September 22, 1897, for Copper River.
They are returning with but little
more than the clothes on their backs,
with their steam launch and whale
boat left in the Conner River section
they do not know where. Most of
this party of forty-four are still up in
the Copper River country, though a
few managed to return home earlier in
the season. Luckman said he did not
know Where, they all were, as they
were soon divided, scattered and lost
to each other.
The steamer Wolcott has DPen pulled
off the route and put on cannery busi
ness, and the Excelsior has now almost
a monopoly of the return travel from
Valdez. HAL HOFFMAN.
WHALER ALEXANDER
AMONG THE MISSING
ST. MICHAEL, Alaska, July 21 (via
Victoria, Aug. 3).â Grave fears are en
tertained for the safety of the steam
whaler Alexander of San Francisco.
The whalers Bayliss and Karluk from
north of Bering Straits, under date of
June 27, send a dispatch that the Alex
ander was last sighted off Fox Island
in the Aleutian group in April. She
was then in what might become a dan
gerous position. The fleet proceeded
north and did not become alarmed un
til late in June, when the Alexander
failed to show up. All other whalers
that were in the vicinity of Fox Island
have reached Bering Straits and re
ported.

NAMED A FEW HONEST MEN" FOR

Francis J. Heney Gives His Reasons
for Opposing the Programme
â¢ of ' the ""Whispering
' ';.- Boss." :
Dissension has entered the ranks of the
dissenters and another note of discord is
swelling the medley of discordant sounds
that are coming from the camp of the lo
cal Democracy.
It appears "Whispering" Gavin McNab

has blundered, arid that In selecting the
men who now comprise the hand-made
City and County Committee of the Demo
cratic party of San Francisco he made
the fatal mistake of naming a fewâ a very
fewâ good Democrats. He did not mean
to do it,- but even reformers sometimes
blander. It was at the meeting of the
committee Tuesday night that the whis
pering boss was brought to a full realiza
tion of his mistake, through the open
and earnest protest of a few members of
the committee against the proposition to
appoint delegates to the State convention
and thus prevent 80,000 voters of this city
from having a voice In the selection of the
men who are to represent them in a body
that Mill place In nomination all of the
candidates for State offices. Unfortu
nately for the aforesaid voters, the pro
tent was without avail, for the reason
that the honest men were In a hopeless
minority.
The man who led the revolt against the
programme of the whispering boss was
Francis J. Heney. He was supported by
seven members of the committee, all of
whom declared against the proposition of
appointing delegates instead of submit
ting the mater to the voters of the party
through the medium of a primary elec
tion. HÂ« now proposes to fight the pro
grammers on their own ground, for the
purpose oÂ£ securing a primary election
for the selection of delegates to the muni
cipal convention. His views on the sub
1 Ject are Buch as will prove interesting to
the followers of the whispering boss. In
discussing the subject yesterday he said:
"In making my 'light before the commit
tee of one hundred last Tuesday night I
was earnest and sincere. It Is true that
I failed to secure the holding or prima
ries for the selection of delegates to the
State convention, and as the time inter
vening between now and the time for the
holding of the said convention is short
it would be useleÃS to make any further
attempt to hold such primaries.
"The municipal election, however, is
another matter, and there is ample time
to hold primaries, to purge the rolls and
in every way by honest and fair means to
elect delegates who are the choice of the
people. I will earnestly fight for a pri
mary to elect delegates to a municipal
convention, and have formulated a plan
which I will present to the commuteÂ© at
its next meeting. The proposition is so |
fair and it has all of the elements .neces
sary to secure for the people an honest
expression of their will that the commit
tee will not dare to refuse to adopt It.
"The hue and cry made against the
holding of primaries on the ground that
they are not fair is foundeasolely on the
proposition that, the officers conducting
the primary elections have heretofore al
ways been corrupt and have permitted
fraudulent voting. Of course the election
officers cannot be expected to be any purer
or any more earnest and sincere In tneir
desire to conduct a fair election than are
those, from whom . they receive their au
thority to act; .
"If the election officers are appointed
by Buckley or are named by him directly
or indirectly no honest man will expect
that an honest expression of the will of
the Democratic party could be secured
through such a medium. I propose, how
ever that the election officers In each
and 'every club throughout tne city in
which a primary election is held shall t>e
appointed by John P. Dunn, the chaiwnan
of the committee of one hundred, and
that he shall make these appointments
by and with the advice of the members
of said committee who reside in the re
spective Assembly districts in which the
clubs are located. If the committee of
one hundred desires to get a true and hon
est expression of opinion of the will of
the Democratic party in this city as to
who shall compose the delegation to the
convention to nominate our city officers,
that committee can form Democratic
clubs In- each Assembly District and can
itself appoint a man to. act as president
of each of said clubs, he â to have sole
Dower to supervise and control the
enrollment of the Democratic voters in
hIR district.
"All the rolls can be closed a month
before the time fixed for holding the elec
tion of delegates and the rolls can be
thoroughly purged by the committee dirr
lng that month. On the night of the club
election the committee can have Its own
officers In charge of the ballot box and
there can be men selected from the resi
dents who are best acquainted with tho
members of the ctub.
"In any club where It might be ex-
pected that force would be attempted to
intimidate honest men or prevent them
from voting arrangements could be made
to have some of the police present to pre
serve order and protect the voter from
any hoodlum element that might try to
make trouble. â 
"The committee would of Itself be the
returning board and pass upon the elec
tion of all delegates and determine If a
certificate should be issued or refused.
In every case where the election officers
reported that they had failed to secure
an honest vote on account of fraud or
force said committee could refuse to is
sue a certificate of election to any dole
gate claiming one if it found such state*
ments on the part of the officers to be
true. The committee could then proceed
to elect a delegate to represent such dis
trict or could declare any of the candi
dates for election in such districts whom
it found to be defeated by such fraud or
force to be the duly elected delegate.
"If a fair expression of the will of the
masses of the voters of the Democratic
party of this city cannot be secured In
this manner it must be because the com
mittee of one hundred, of which I have
the honor to be a member, is Incapable
of governing the party through any of
the methods recognized as proper tor de
termining the will of the people under a
popular form of government.

Democrats Are Preparing for a
Parade and a Reception at

About fifty members attended the regu

opening of the meeting read a telegram
from the club's idol. "Little Giant" Ma

that he will arrive in this city Monday

date. The marching members of the
Iroquol* and other Democratic clubs will
meet him at the ferry and escort him to
Metropolitan Temple, where the oral
pyrotechnics of the occasion will be dis
charged. By a unanimous vote Walter P.
Stradley, ex-Commissioner of Im
migration, was selected to preside
at the reception. The Sailors
Union sent a letter of regret
that the organization could not partici
pate as a body in the welcome, although
every man before t ne mast had the great
est admiration for lr. Maguire.
The committee having charge of the
reception reported that it had been de

WELLS-FARGO CALLED DOWN.
' ZHJ VER since the imposition of the war tax, and
the effort of the Wells-Fargo people to evade
Iâ * payment of their share of it, this paper has
deemed it a plain duty to call the attention of the
corporation to the fact that the evasion was un
patriotic and illegal. It quoted the statute, cited the
example of other Jess greedy corporations, and strove
to awaken within the express company some com
punciion of conscience, some indication of a desire
to be honest. But al! in vain.
The company claimed the right to make its cus
tomers pay lor the stamp required to be affixed to
bili> of lading, and, to soothe any impulse toward
protest, offered to help the customer cheat the Gov
ernment. For instance, it said that it would accept
as one bundle enough bundles to constitute a. wagon
load, this generosity applying particularly to news
papers. The error was gently and firmly pointed out
to the sinning corporation, but it. manifested no
symptom of reform. â  . . .
Now Commissioner of Internal Revenue Scott has
passed r.pon the exact point at issue, and says
specifically that no such subterfuge is to be permitted.
Of course everybody knew this, but the company was
hoping for delay until the cruel war should be over.
Mr. Scott says there must be a bill of lading for each
bundle, and that a collection of bundles having dif
ferent destinations cannot be construed as one.
It will be recalled that Wells-Fargo had sought to
have the matter kept in abeyance in order that the
decision of the court might' be .handed down, that as
fast as such decision was handed down an appeal had
been taken to the Supreme Court, where there was a
certainty the matter would rest for a term of years.
It seemed to have an influence sufficient to keep Dis
trict Attorney Foote . from taking any action, and
meantime it was escaping its just share of the com
mon burden. From the Scott decision, however,
there is no appeal. Wclls-Fargo has an opportunity
to show how gracefully it can come down from its
untenable position. It has been called down. hard.
The public will be glad. The assurance of a
wealthy company, doing business under the protection
of the Government, acquiring extra dividends by rea
son of the troubles of the country, yet refusing to pay
any part of the expense, was an irritating insult.
That Wells-Fargo will be ashamed of itself is too
much to hope, but. like a burglar in the grip of a
policeman, it may lead a better life.
STANDING BY OUR GUN.
A WICK ED and ribald attempt has been made
to class the cannon of The Call among
nuisances. Of course everybody will recognize
in this effort the jealousy of the baffled . contem
poraries who neither have a gun, a place to put one
nor the enterprise to buy ammunition.
As a matter of fact The Call cannon is a useful
affair, nineteen stories high in the estimation of the
community. When it speaks from its lofty perch the
noise is merely distinct, and in no sense distressing.
It is a signal. At" the boom of the gun people rush
to their front doors, knowing that something is
happening and desirous of seeing it. That faithful
gun has said "Hail" to the coming soldier, arid to the
outward bound "Farewell." As it sends a puff of
smoke into the sky there is no report shaking win
dows and denting the auricular drum. There is
merely sound enough to attract attention. People
have learned the significance of it. They know the
artillery is not turned loose on any. such fool impulse
as may actuate a siren. It means business every time.
It is as true as the ball which falls at noon, melodious
as the peal of an organ, honest as the curfew bell. It
never gives false alarms, raises bogus hopes nor
booms a fake edition. .
Anybody who does not like that cannon, does not
admire its frankness, acknowledge its probity, either
has dyspepsia or is lanie in his patriotism.
Ever since the Examiner erected at Third and
Market streets a building of lath and plaster it has
boasted that other improvements in the vicinity are
due to the presence of its architectural . freak. The
suspicion cannot be avoided that the Examiner occa
sionally has fun with itself.
An Oakland man who killed his w v ife in cold blood
has been convicted of murder in the. second degree,
whereupon a question naturally arises as to What the
jury would be convicted of were it to be placed on
trial. â '. ".' : â¢
If the chap who rejoices in the title "King of the
Dudes" would grasp the conviction that he is. a harm
less but rather tiresome as.s he would have himself
correctly sized up.
People who received bribes from Hooley are busy
explaining that they came as gifts. Yes?
It is a little strange that the Kaiser should, regard
the Bismarck obsequies as any of his funeral.
THE MfIN AND THE OFFICE.
THE political situation in this State furnishes an
object lesson in the wide departure from primi
tive and purer methods.
Men pick themselves out for Governor, for Sen
ator, or for other office, and proceed to make organ
izations, combinations and programmes looking to
personal success. A candidate for Governor insists
upon naming the delegations to nominate him, which
amounts to the nomination of himself by himself.
Candidates for Senator desire the privilege of nom
inating candidates for the Senate and Assembly pre
pledged to vote for their nominator. The matter is
not left to the people for decision. They are not per
mitted to sit in judgment upon the merit of men.
That is passed upon by the men themselves. The
only choice left to the people is on election day, and
that is entirely between two sets of candidates who
have, by these processes, practically nominated them
selves and passed upon their own fitness for office.
It is to be hoped, from the beginning already made,
that the Republican party in California will exhibit
a better method; that it will pay no heed to these
various pretenders and self-seekers, and in a freely
chosen convention freely select candidates who repre
sent, not merely, time-serving and temporary devo
tion to its principles, but abiding belief in them. Let
it be established that in such a convention the office
is to s^ek the man, not the man the office. Let the
right of the people to select freely be restored to
them.
When a candidate has himself selected a delegation
for himself, taking it into a convention to trade for
votes for himself, let it be understood that such dele
gation, being personal property and in no party sense
representative, has no more influence than the can
didate's pocket-comb, penknife or other item of per
sonal property.
When this system of personal politics is destroyed
we ma}' expect a decided improvement in the atmos
phere of official life. The personnel of the public offi
ciary will undergo a change for the better. Public
administration will cease to be a game of personal
advantage and will appear in the interest of the peo
ple, who have instituted government as a means to
the wise and economical transaction of the public
business.
When this freedom is restored to a party to select
its representatives and command them instead of
being commanded by them, merit may hope for
recognition and men will seek preferment by deserv
ing it in the name of their talents and their virtues.
For a long time such qualifications for office have
been subordinated to the capacity for intrigue, and
the faculty of making personal organizations and
cabals strong enough to seize a nomination regardless
of the wishes of the great masses, which make up
parties.
The system too long in vogue has been copied
bodily from that which prevailed in decadent Rome.
The political prizes offered by the rich resources of
the mistress of the world caused politicians to organ
ize bands of retainers, who. opposed force to force
and walked, over the rights of citizens. The choice
â of men for the great offices of the Roman common
wealth came finally to be made by hard knocks in the
streets between bands of bravos. From these phy
sical contests on the plane of a street riot the tran
sition to civil war was natural and easy, and each
change in the great offices finally came to decision in
widespread civil strife. In this way, for three cen
turies. Roman politicians had prepared the way for
Caesar,, and Caesarism remained after him, the per
manent condition of Rome until her vast structure
fell into ruin.
.. From a candidate for Governor naming the dele
gates who are to nominate him. to the enlistment of
partisans armed to right for his elevation is a very
short step indeed. The long step is taken when his
right to practically nominate himself is conceded.
Let it be recorded to the glory of the Republican
party of California that it denied the right to take the
first step and therefore destroyed the possibility that
the second can ever be taken.
THE "HARNEY DEMOCRATS."
THE Maguire organ asks, "What sort of politi
cal species or thing is a Harney Democrat?"
It says it has heard of Jacksonian or Jeffer
sonian Democrats, but it confesses to entire ignor
ance of the peculiar animal known to the press and
people of this city as "Harney Democrats."
As the organ puts this question with considerable
earnestness and is apparently as ignorant as it pro
fesses to be, we do not mind illuminating its intelli
gence. Perhaps we might be in better business â but
let that pass. A conscientious view of one's duty
often compels the performance of disagreeable acts,
and if we were to do only those things which pleased
us we should fall far short of meeting the just expec
tations of the public. For instance, it is sometimes
the awful duty of a man to argue with a polecat, but
we know of no case in which the cat ever either ap
preciated or profited by the self-sacrifice of the per
son who attempted to enlighten it. On the contrary
â but let that pass also.
As we understand it, the Maguire organ grouped
Jeftersonian, Jacksonian and Harney Democrats for
the purpose of making a comparison at once ridic
ulous and striking. The idea of the organ was to
contrast the enduring principles represented by the
Democrats comprised in the first two designations
with the alleged selfish tendencies of those repre
sented by the last named.. Yet the Harney Democrat
pf to-day stands for principles as vital to the republic
as any expressed by the phrases "Jeflfersonian Dem
ocrat" or "Jacksonian Democrat." What are these
principles? . The organ is as familiar with them as
we are. They are the right of the people to a voice
in political party management and the inalienable
privilege of Democrats to protest against bossism
and usurpation â in other words, the principles upon
which political liberty repose.
As the organ well knows, three members of the
Democratic State. Committee have taken forcible
possession of the party machine in this city. They
have appointed a committee to take charge of the
local Demociacy and have authorized it to select
delegates to State and municipal conventions. They
have arranged a cut and dried programme and par
celed out the nominations of both conventions among
their friends. This has all been done by force and
against the will of the people. Demands by Demo
crats for a hearing on the merits of this policy of
outrage and usurpation have been met with sneers
and contumely. The three bosses have laughed in the
faces of those who have asked for open primaries and
from their lofty attitude have looked down with
scorn and contempt upon the struggles of all in the
prrty who have attempted to maintain their political
rights.
The Harney Democrat of to-day represents oppo
sition to this method of conducting popular govern
ment. The Jeffersonian Democrat of 1798 stood for
State's rights and a simple government; the Jack
sonian Democrat of 1832 stood for political equality
and the spoils system; the Harney Democrat of 1898
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALI,, THURSDAY, AUGUST 4, 1898.
stands for the right of the people to select their rulers
through the machinery of primaries and conventions.
Of the three we regard the Harney Democrat with
the greatest admiration. Jeffersonian and Jacksonian
Democracy have been exploded by time. The former
was disposed of at Appomattox Courthouse, and the
civil service reformers are rapidly getting away with
the latter. But the Harney Democracy will live for
ever. When it expires the republic will expire, for
upon its principles rest the very foundations of politi
cal liberty. If the organ had a spark of patriotism
left in its corrupt carcass it would laud the Harney
Democrats instead of deriding them.
STATEMENTS made by Ernest T. Hooley, the
insolvent promoter of all sorts of enterprises,
have given rise in London to what, taking all
things into consideration, is the gravest iinancial
scandal of the age. The extent of the corrupt oper
ations of Hooley is indeed inferior to that of the pro
moters of the Panama canal swindle in France, and
the number of eminent persons involved in the scan
dal is less; but, on the other hand, the social posi
tion of the accused parties in London is so much
higher than that of the men exposed in Paris that the
British sensation is unquestionably the more startling
of the two.
Hooley's statements, though given in court and
under oath, are of course not to be accepted with un
questioning credulity. The man by his own showing
has been a swindler, a liar, a bribe-giver, and an
all-round confidence man on a large scale. He has
handled millions of money representing the invest
ments of nearly all classes of the British people, and
has come out of his schemes bankrupt in purse, repu
tation and hope. He is now in his despair and malice
fighting back against the society that condemns him,
and seems determined to drag down with him
as many others as he can.
The testimony of such a man given in such a mood
and under such circumstances must always be re
ceived with suspicion. No man accused* by Hooley
ought to be condemned on that testimony alone.
There are some rascals who would just as soon lie
under oath for spite as to lie on the stock exchange
for money, and Hooley may be one of them. That
he is utterly unscrupulous is beyond question. More
over, according to his own evidence he is now try
ing to shift the burden of wrongdoing from his own
shoulders to that of others, and that fact tends to
weaken the force of what he says. It is known that
so long as his operations were successful he took all
the credit to himself, and now that failure has come
upon him the public will not readily believe the blame
must rest upon others.
Briefly stated, Hooley's claim is that his enterprises
failed only because he had to pay such enormous
tribute to blackmailing newspapers and such large
sums to noblemen to induce them to act as directors
of his various companies. The first plea is certainly
not good. Newspapers are not so much given to
blackmailing as certain rascals would like to have
the public believe. Moreover, honest business men
engaged in legitimate enterprises need not fear black
mailers either in England or in this country. If
Hooley paid any London editors for silence it was
only because he was engaged in something that would
not bear investigation, and in that case the so-called
blackmail was only a division of plunder between two
rascals, one of whom -was about as honest as the
other.
The chief, feature of the scandal is that relating to
the nobility. It will be noted that whereas the
Panama scandal involved a considerable number of
French politicians and statesmen, the British case
does not affect that class of men at all. The dig
nitaries accused by Hooley of selling their names and
patronage to worthless stock companies belong with
out exception to the so-called "smart set." That is
to say, thej' are members of that fashionable clique
that leads society and devotes itself, its wealth and its
energies to high teas, fancy dress balls and general
dissipation. With that class of people few persons
will have any sympathy. London will lose nothing
if some of these gaudy birds are stripped of their
peacock plumage. In fact, it will probably be a ben
efit not only for the British public, but for some of
our own people in New York, if a few members of
the London smart set should be sent to penitentiary
and the whole clique permanently retired to ob
scurity.
THE SUBSIDENCE OF POLITICIANS.
ADDRESSING the Republicans of the First
Congressional District of Maine on the occa
sion of his renomination for Congress by
acclamation, Speaker Reed is reported to have said:
"All over the country there is a dearth of political
feeling. I never knew less of it in all the years in
which I have known of such things."
Of course in making the statement the Speaker
used the phrase "political feeling" to signify that
condition of mind brought about among the people
by differences of opinion concerning the greater is
sues before the country. In that sense the statement
is as true of California as of Maine. Political divi
sions have almost ceased to exist among us so far as
national questions are concerned, and all that is left
for this campaign is to elect to office good men who
will uphold the Republican administration at 'Wash
ington and faithfully perform such duties as their
official positions require of them.
All over the Union the same condition of affairs
prevails. Even in Kansas and among the Populists
there is for a time a subsidence of the calamity howls
of agitation and discontent. Reports from that State
announce that all the Populist candidates for Con
gress in the commonwealth have agreed with the
State Central Committee that the war will furnish
the principal topic of discussion by them and their,
supporters in the coming campaign, that the silver
question and everything else is to be crowded into
the background, and that every speaker in the cam
paign will talk patriotism. Â» . .
This extraordinary change in public sentiment and
the political tone of the country from what prevailed
in 1896 may seem strange, and yet it is but the in
evitable reaction from the excessive agitations of that
year. Even had there been no war to distract popu
lar attention from home issues, the people would not
have paid much attention to the Bryanites or to
Bryan himself this year. Nations, like individuals,
occasionally get tired of certain .things, and this na
tion is tired of Populism, free silver, free trade, Alt
geldism and the whole band, gang and combination
of howling reformers.
The issues which now engage the minds of the in
telligent are those which are to grow up out of the
war. These, as the Speaker said, will be trouble
some and will demand for their proper solution the
highest wisdom and truest patriotism of all. On
these issues, moreover, the great mass of the earnest
conservative body of the people will join the
Speaker in his wish â "For my part I hope that all
these problems may be worked out consistently with
our time honored and dearly bought institutions and
with the traditions of our wise forefathers^
ThjE HOOLEY SCANDAL.
FABLES WITHOUT MORALS.
It befell that a certain corporation
possessed sundry rails wherewith the
street was sore encumbered so that the
people made lament, which the Mayor
hearing, pricked up the ears of him,
and to the corporation said: "Remove
the rails and see that ye delay not, lest
I come with my men, lo! an army for
number, and make a three-base hit by
doing it in my capacity of high cocko
lorum."
Now It befell that the corporation had
desired that the rails they be torn up,
but its members said one to another:
"Wist ye not that he/c is a snap, even
a Mayor who can be worked. Behold,
we would that this rusty iron be
yanked, and while we pause that the
cost of the undertaking is gTeat, he
makes promise to essay the task for
us." Then did they laugh merrily, tak
ing many drinks betimes, and the
Mayor did even as he had said. There
upon the corporation hirelings made
much ado to be wroth, but only alone
as to the Mayor was there a single man
in the whole city whom they befooled.
"Why do you walk backward?" asked
a policeman of a distinguished looking
citizen.
"Pardon me," answered the person
addressed. "I was unaware that there
â¢was anything unusual in my method of
locomotion. The truth is that I have
been on the Supreme bench so long that
reversal has become second nature to
me."
As a prentle corrective the policeman
started the pedestrian along, still fac
ing to the rear, and as he speedily re
ve/pfd himself he proceeded on his way
even as other men.
Receiving back his manuscript a con
tributor drew himself up proudly. "I
would have you understand, sir," he
remarked to the editor, "that I am a
poet and that poets are barn, not
made."
"No apology Is necessary," returned
the editor kindly; "I hope T am not so
brutal as to blame you for having been
born."
As the poet ambled thence he was no
ticed to wear an air of unwonted
thoughtfulness.J
War having come upon the land, a
tax was levied, but with great cheer
the people paid it, saying, "This is a
just war and a righteous; surely
each shall bear his part." But a great
corporation which had waxed strong
under the protection and patronage of
the people refused to contribute, and,
being pressed for explanation, frankly
made known the ground of its demur.
"In the first place," explained the good
man at the head of the corporation,
"we don't want to pay, and in the sec
ond place we don't have to pay. See?"
Yet in their blindness the people
could not see; on the contrary, pro
claiming aloud, "This is a bunko
game. Get you a shell and pea outfit
and make no further pretense of de
cency."
Kearirig that the mortality among
the soldiers encamped awaiting a
chance to goto : the front was appall
ing; a lady ventured to speak with a
general about the matter.
"Since you remind me," courteously
replied the general, "the men have been
dyfrng off rather fast. But may I ask
you, madam,' what soldiers are for?"
As the lady had not given this phase
of the subject consideration she -was
obliged to retreat leaving the query
unanswered. .â¢_ â¢
A Spanish warrior reached the gate
of Heaven and was stopped by the
guardian, who queried of him what
was in the package under his arm.
"That," said Blanco, "is my type
writer."
"You will have to leave it outside,"
replied the guardian, firmly.
With haughty mien the Spanish war
rior strode through the gate, but as he
saw an attendant carelessly throw
aside the beloved machine he mur
mured "This is hell," and though they
gave him a harp he refused to play.
After having conquered a city a
Shaf ter was invited by a Garcia, to turn
it over to him, but responded that he
did not see his way clear to do so.
"Then I understand," said the Garcia,
with evident feeling, "that you think
more of your own flag than you do of
mine. Such in- titude appalls me. Sir,
I shall decline to eat more of your ra
tions unless so be my men can lift a
few after dark."
To emphasize his disgust he stralght
way permitted a Spanish general to
knock the stuffing out of him.
A Barry being 1 smitten of ambition
desired greatly to go to Congress.
"What claim have you," demanded
the voters, "upon the suffrages of the
people?"
"Claim enougJi," averred the Barry,
with confidence. "I would lighten the
burden of taxation."
"But how?", they continued, thinking
to have found a good thing.
"Well," said Barry, i- I never pay
taxes myself, and in the position of
Congressman would have an oppor
tunity to benefit many others by my
example."
And he marveled greatly that later
they voted for the other man.
A correspondent havir~ been ex
pelled from Cuba paused at the border
to make protest.
"Why am I, a Special Commissioner,
treated thus with indignity?" he ex
claimed bitterly.
"I did not know you were a Special
Commissioner," replied the Command
ing General. "It is my ambition to
stamp out disease, and I mistook you
for a yellow f**ver germ."
Notwithstanding this frank apology
the corrrsporulent refused to stay, be
ing strengthened in this resolve by a
prod from a bayonet.
Having told the multitude what
should be done with the islands taken
from Spain an orator paused that th.c.
listeners might ply him with questions
for the enlightening of their ignorance.
"Sir," said a Voice from the audience,
"do- you regard the holding of the Phil
ippines as in accord with the constitu
tion?" . .
"In discoursing of affairs of state,"
replied the orator, "I am proud to be
unhampered by any knowledge of the
constitution. All the Information I
have. concerning it is that it is out of
date."
Straightway the Voice, was observed
to slink away. \ .
One whose whiskers wagged to his
knees entered the office of a physician
and made complaint to the healer. As
certaining by inquiry the symptoms of
the visitor the physician told him he
was merely suffering from indigestion,
and asked him what he had been eat
ing.
"I have to confess," replied the ailing
stranger, "to having been a delegate tn
the convention which swallowed the
Democratic party."
"In that case;" responded the healer,
"I advise you to consult an undertaker.
This is no miracle Bfaop."
So the Populist went his way, be
moaning fate. ___ i _ :
Once upon a time a Republic had a
Monarchy by the throat, and with

* city seven days j
I in the week. Ha
i is an inveterate
vwwww~~> ~* clear smoker and
has other habits. The bloom of youth ,
still mantles his cheeks and, strive as he
will to furrow his brow in order to show
to the world that he is advancing in
years, he has not effected a change In
his looks during the 'last decade. He is
a man with a family which, due to a late
addition, now numbers three. Three years
ago the physicians told him he was the
father of as pretty a- baby girl as this
world ever looked upon. Of course. ho
was happy, but he could not account for
the sudd-en upheaval of .things. . In his â¢
narrow way of â¢ looking at the workings
of nature, his wishes and desires .must
at all times be' fulfilled.- Therefore, ho
was somewhat disappointed. The pictures
that he painted for the future .President
of the United States who would bear his,
name- were" obliterated; But this, accident
might happen once. Twice in succession
would never do. At least that was his
frame of mind when he met a friend in
whom he could pour the full current of
his disappointment. The friend was con
soling, and" suggested a sure plan of at
taining the desideratum. He advised the
young father to start put on the morrow
and bet every friend he met during that
day and for -every day :of that month
that his next child would be a' girl. Dame â 
Fortune would certainly not favor him.
to the winning of all those bets, and
thus all would be satisfactory at the time
of the reckoning. .Acting on this advice
the father started to do the '.'line." "When
he retired that night he had placed waf
ers for at least ten. hats, as. many pairs
of gloves, for. canes, for boxes of cigars,
in fact for every . description . of portable
apparel. Those bets were held in the
balance for three, years. They were set
tled: yesterday. Just as before the phyÃi
ciaris announced a. daughter, and' now the.
father .is sitting on a fence,- for he does,
not know whether to rejoice or weep..
But .What 'grieves. '.him most -is to have',
each 'one of the .same, friends who lo&t.
tell him that he never" won a bet in his
life, and that" they ought to have known ;
better than to bet with such a "jonah."

A THRONG of spectators watched j
the loading of horses and mules on
board the ship Tac.oma at â¢Main
street wharf yesterday. , The -work
' â was expeditiously done, the troopers as
. signed the task handling the horses'
â  as though they were mere sacks- of
â¢- freight, Instead of nervous animals. A
rtanoh ,x. well pr.dded, but little 'â¢â¢jr. i
! than a horse and about as. high,- was pro
: vlded. This had doors at both ends.
: These were thrown open and a .quiet"ani
, xnal was led through.' Gerund this came
r another, and when the latter was well In
side both doors were closed.
' "In another moment the box swung high
; â in the air. The action up to this time was.
: so quick that the horse did not rebel.
When he found himself dangling In' the
. air he Invariably Strug] desperately,
' but to no avail. As the box swung back,
the. majority of the horses sank upon
their haunches, as though expecting a
fall. The work was done .without acci-.
dent. The mules were, if anything, more
' tractable than the horses.
.-.The ship has been splendidly outfitted
. .for -the long voyage, under the direction
' of. Lieutenant Cameron. Fourth â  United
' States Cavalry. All that modern science \
-. could suggest for the comfort of the ani
jiials has been applied to their quarters. j

which the Tacoma will be "lighted I

these, will be necessary after a .severe
storm, and will also permit of the horses'
resting at any time. The mules', more
hardy than their fellows, have- been
. placed on the 'tween decks, while- the
hoTses are on what was originally the
main deck. Above this, however, there
has been built a false deck that will make

of Its Heroic Conduct at

tf-rson of Baa .Francisco j sergeant major:
of the Sixteenth United States Infantry,
under date of July 9. in intrenchmentÃ In.
front of . Santiago de Cuba, from which
the following extracts are taken:
"For the past few days, wo have been
under a flag of truce, awaiting the result
ot H->me kind of peace, negotiations. It
was a great. battle. It lasted from 6:25
a- m. July i until 11 a. m^ July 3. . In
lucking over the battle-fieid we wonder
by what manner of luck so many of us
[.lived through the -fight. For .hours there,
was a hall of bullets.' Our regiment and
the Sixth, I am proud to say, did the
hardest and best. work of the whole army.
Put let me t<-H yu that war is. a .thing
horrible beyond all powers of description.
' I:' the united States is not proud of
Its regular army it. ought to. be. ' The. â¢
bravery and. fortitude displayed by it .has,
in my opinion, never been equaled. -You
must remember that this is -the iirst great

â¢ \/\/ This question has been asked
\l 1/ â  a thousand times in San Fran
. * .Cisco since the reports of the
; : fighting- around Santiago began
to arrive. .Letters' received from the front
during the past week clear up the mys
tery. One letter states that when the

placecl in a brigade along with the Fourth
arid. Twenty-fifth Regular Infantry Regi
ments, all under the .command of Colonel
Evan -Miles, of .tag First. When the troops
disembarked near Santiago General Shaf
ter detached the First from the brigade
â¢and placed it under his own Immediate
orders. Colonel Mil. led the other regi
ments, ".the Fourth and Twenty-fifth, into
the light at El Caney, and it was. never
his itiiije to lead more 'gallant meji into
â¢action. â¢ The- men " endured many hard
ships and were â¢ exposed to a severe; fire
of the enemy.- The Fourth sustained a
loss of one officer killed, three officers
wounded, eight nnlisted men killed and
thirty 'wounded. The loss of the Twenty
fifth was : one offloer killed, .three officers
. wounded, eight enlisted men killed and
â twenty-seven' wounded. The brigade
pressed, forward under orders to take El
at 4 o'clock and marched along the road
leading to Santiago, the. ground being
covered with very thick brush. At b

ON ALASKAN TRAILS.
A Year's Supplies Sent to the
Troops Who Are Performing
Important Work.
Major General Merriam in: performing
the duties connected with the Philippine
expeditionary forces, the organization of
the ncÂ» post at Honolulu, the sending of
supplies to Alaska and the transaction of
other business of the -Department of
California, certainly has his time fully
occupied. â  â¢
In the rush .to the Philippines, the
Alaskan country has been almost forgot
ten- by the public, but- it has not been
overlooked by General Merriam. He or
dered one year's supplies yesterday for
.the various ' detachments of troops in
Alaska to be shipped from Seattle to St.
Michael and Dyea. The soldiers now in
Alaska all belong to the Fourteenth
United States. Infantry. There is one
â Company stationed at Dyea and another
at WranÃf-T. â  . . â¢
Three officers and fifteen men are try
iHgtoÃo up Copper River to. make i trail
to the Belle Isle oti the Yukon River, and
three officers, and fifteen men are on
Suchitnay Creek, a- tributary of Cooks
Inlet, endeavoring to open a trail across

Eighth Ma-y Drill Hera.
CAMP BARRETT, Sather Tract, Aug.
3.â The large tract to the west of the
tented city afforded ample room to-day
for the regimental drill which was held
this morning. The : i.iree battslionÃ were
easily maved about with comfort,, a feat
ure which is not enjoyed at Camp Mer
ritt. . ' ' .
Colonel Hen.shaw has received an invl
ta-tlon from the Arm - and Navy Chris
tian Commission for a drill of the Eighth
to be held at Central Park shortly. The
commission has agreed to furnish trans T
portatlon free and otherwise arrange for
the comfort of the troops on this occa
sion. It is probable that the invitation
will be accepted.
By orders, all the National Guardsmen
vho are known to be good shots are
listed. Those recruits about whose
marksmanship nothing is known will be
tried out at the Alameda Company's
shooting range at the foot of High street
Immediately.
Colontl Guthrie of Sacramento wae the
distinguished guest of the officers of the
Eighth to-day. Colonel Guthrie is .the
colonel of the Second Infantry, N. G. C,
Caney and did not halt until the town
was captured.
A letter received at the Presidio yester
day says: "The First Infantry was gup
porting Captain Capron"s battery of ar
tillery. They did not lose a man. A
majority of the officers and enl^"ted men
of the First would have greatly preferred
to have served with Colonel Miles. The
condition of affairs prevents Colonel
Miles from recommending any Of his own
regiment for advancement." â¢ . â â  .
Other letters report that General. Shat
ter did everything- in his power to havo
Colonel Miles placed on the "retired list
before the campaign opened, and came
very near accomplishing his purpose. â 
When all the facts are brought out, it
'will doubtless- be found that General
Shatter had good grounds for holding the
First in reserve as an artillery support.
He commanded the ; regiment for' eleven
years and knew that it could be trust Â«-d
in the event of great exigence in battle.
As affairs turned out the regiment did
not Â£ft under a deadly range of fire, but
nevertheless the men performed thr duty
which they were directed to perform and
deserve credit for that performance. Per

The Utah Cavalry, which has been or

to move the wagons. As â â¢soon as thp

Beem to Interfere with its upward movement at j
this time. The big leaders 'are not active, cvi- 1
dently preferring a reaction on which to- accu- j
mulate a new line of stocks to carrying : on the j
advance without interruption.- Until they are I
ready it is useless to' calculate upon booming j

work which. In due season, will overcome all ]
artificial barriers, and compel even : the big
leaders to come into line. -We' refer to. the mul
tiplying evidences that the country has already,
entered upon an- era of. exceptional prosperity.
The war is now a factor of secondary impor- ;
.tance. The controlling influences juet now are \
the encouraging conditions in agriculture and
industry. Upon:' these our future prosperity
chiefly rests. .-War -may prove a 'stimulus to
trade, but genuine prosperity . was never built
upon a war basis. It is '-more important, to j
know that the farmers have had one prosperous

ishing rate. Another season of large crops, fair
" prices and good exports Is In prospect. Cotton
Is very low in price, and a large yield is antici
pated; but the cost of production ' has been
greatly reduced, so that growers will riot euf- Â

industrial conditions "there. In New England

satisfactory shape; but the situation is lmprov-:|

pig iron during the last six months was 6.000.000 ;
tons; much the largest- half year's production
in our history. Our foreign trade has resulted
In a heavy trade balance in our favor, which
â¢promises a large influx of gold, hot to speak of
the amount likely soon to.be received from- the
'Klondike. The extension of our territory also
foreshadows a more active â¢ foreign trade.
Money Is easy; confidence is rising, arid all the'

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Aug. 3.â There was no great
outburst of speculative enthusiaFm in the stock
market to-day as a result of the peace news.
The market broadened out materially and was
confidently strong all day, but inquiring -ob
servers feel considerable duubt whether the
peace prospects had much to do with the rise.
Of much more effect Is the generally growing
conviction that the dullness of the local money
mar'--* Is not at all due to sluggish trade con
ditions, but raiher to the abundant supplies of
money at interior points to meet the require
ments of expanding business and the move-
Best thus far of the crnps. Yesterday's gold
lmportÃ resulted In stiffening foreign exchange
ar.d In appreciably easier money rates for time
loans. Exchange experts are not able to figure
any profit on the g-->ld import operation at the
present level of exchange, and the engage
ments must be accepted as antlcipative of
future conditur.s. The general ti-nor of talk
heard in Wall street is all of expected Increase
of trade and industrial expansions. The gen
eral view in the street is unmistakably bullish.
The strength of â¢â¦*-â  market to-day was taken
advantage of to realize profits in some of the
recently manipulated Industrial spsclaltips. but
there was a broad and comprehensive demand
for the standard stocks, the grangers and the
favorite dividend payers leading.
I>ealir.ss in bonds were also active and wf-11
distributed. A feature of the day Was thÂ» rise
to par of the Northern Pacific fours. This ia
one of a large class r.f Fimilar bonds' issued
lately for reorganization, which have been fa
vorites in the bond market. The Northern Pa
cific mortgage Is the first of them to rise to
jar. There was a very large . absorption of
other railroad bonds, which have been gaining
added f-ecurity from the largely increased,
earnings b â  rallroadÃ In the last fiscal year.
Total salts. $5,575,000.

CHICAGO, Aug. 3.â Higher Liverpool cables
as a result of wet weather throughout. Eng
land gave Wheat a good start here. The do
mestic receipts were still more noticeably small
than they were yesterday. That was a further
reason for strength, and as the figures were
made known during the first hour of the ses
sion an addition was made to the advance.
Chicago received only 108 cars, against 136 last
year. Business in the pit was quite active at
times, but not much of It came from outside of
Chicago There was an active â¢ demand for
Wheat for shipment East. The quotations from
Paris were at about lc a bushel reduction. This
weakness caused a break in the bullishness
here, but the market Boon revived when It be
came rumored around that the quantity sold
here for prompt shipment East amounted to
400,000 bushels. September closed %c higher
and December gained %c.
Improved prospects for the Corn crop brought
about by plenteous rains weakened Corn. Mod
erate selling by the country caused prices to
fall off early. Later, however, the Initial loss
was partly recovered -on buying against puts
and a better export demand. The close was
lie lower for September. '^ ''Â»:,'
A- good shipping demand and considerable
buying for the outside account held Oats firm.
Crop damage reports were also an influence.
September rose %<S%c on the day.
Provisions furnished a sensation on excessive
selling by B.everal of the prominent packing
interests. At one time, pork was oft 50c, lard
20c and ribs 3 c. Covering by shorts to secure
profits resulted in a reaction, but the market
received no substantial support and the feel
ing remained weak throughout the session.
Traders generally were mystified by the sud
den demoralization, but several operators/were
of the opinion that the good prospects for
ending of the war with Spain were responsible.
September pork declined 20c, lard 15c and ribs

.DECIDUOUS AND CITRUS FRUITS. " .
. The- weekly report of the Weather Bureau
says that the high , temperatures have be.en
quite .'injurious to fruits In the Sacramento and
lower San Joaquin valleys. Some varieties of
grapes, especially Tokay, have been seriously
burned. In extreme cases.' one-half the crop
has been injured. The second crop. of figs has
also been very badly Injured. â¢ Summer fruits
are ripening very rapidly, and the weather hag
been excellent, for drying. : Fruit is generally
of small size, owing to drought. The fruit con
tinues to drop from the .trees in many sec
tions; however, the unusually high prices be-
In* paid compensate for. the diminished YMÂ°:
Peaches are higher. Pears . and .Apricots are
firm. Plums are slow. . Limes are lower, The
other" descriptions range about the same. -
Prunes aTe selling in the Santa -Clara at

DRIED FRUITS, NUTS, RAISINS, ETC.
Interest Is centering- on Prunes at the mo
ment. Buyers are slowly advancing their bids
for the new output and have got up to 3%e
and In a few' cases to -4c for Santa Claras, but
without success, as the growers decline to eet
a selling price. Fresh Prunes are bringing
as high as $35Â®'40 per ton for the good sizes,
and Silver Prunes are bringing $60. Growers
will- probably find no difficulty in getting good
prices for dried fruit this Year. All kinds are
stiff. As the season advances are crops seem
to get smaller, owing to the widespread, drop,
from dry weather. ' â .-â 'â :Â« :â â¢'â â

PARDEE'S HIGH
HANDED WAYS
Ignores His Friends and Deter
mines to Run His Own Po
litical Campaign.
Metcalf Watching With Anxiety the Grow
ing Signs of an Alliance Between the
Doctor and Hilborn.
OAKLAND, Aug. 3.â Dr. George C.
Pardee, aspirant for the Republican
nomination for Governor; in his desper- {
ation has overreached himself. In his ;
blindness he flounders on in the path j
. he has elected to. follow and in conse- j
quence there threatens to be a meeting :
among the rank and file of the lie- j
:. publicans of Alameda County.
./. Pardee's frank avowal that he in
, tends, to take the selection of-candi
dates for delegate* to the State Oon-j
ventlon entirely out of the hands of the
. clubs and make up a list favorable to
â¢ himself in each Assembly District is
an affront to the men who have loy
\ ; .ally supported him that they are not :
Blow to resent. But Pardee.. is one. of
the kind who, having decided upon a
.course to pursue, will not be turned
,' : aside, even though that course leads to |
disaster, and instead of heeding the
' protests of his friends who became ap- i
' prised of his intended action through
; The Call, this morning, the doctor at- i
. tempts to justify his course in his pa
per, to-night, and boldly declares his
determination to follow it out, advising
his opponent. .Mr. Davis, to do likewise
in these words:
.;â¢ "The obviously proper course is for!
. Mr. Davis to arrange a list" of candi- |
dates for delegates which will be satis- ;
â¢ factory to him, and for Dr.' Pardee to
arrange another list â  satisfactory to ;
himself. After that is done let . the
.voters decide between the two."
; . There is Dr. Pardee's own statement
published In his own paperâ plain
declaration that he will not trust his
friends in the clubs to select men who
â â 'â will remain faithful to him. And the
aforesaid club members are exceedingly
â  wroth thereat. All their labors" have
'. been in vain. They have spent their
, time and money, have buttonholed their
friends and lifted up their voices in
gladsome shouts for the doctor, and in
return are told that their work is not
appreciated, that their voices have not
. the true ring. They are denied even the
poor privilege of naming the men they
would have represent them in their
.party's council.
: The sentiment in favor of an unin
(Btructed delegation has grown rapidly
to-day and it will continue to grow
among those who have been classed as
Pardee supporters if the doctor persists
in his determination to stoop to the
small politics of the ward boss and per
sonally dictate who hid representatives
shall be, and seek to conduct the pri
â â  maries according to his own ideas.
.. .' Alameda is leading the revolt against â¢
! ' Pardee and tJiere seems to be nobody
who is able to devise any plan to check
the inclination of the Alamedans to
break away from the dictation of the
: ward boss with gubernatorial aspira
tions. Even the action of the Pardee
men in the county committee' last Mon
day in regard to Robinson's resigna- ;
tion was not at all calculated to con- !
.ciiiate the Republicans on the south
Btde of the estuary. In this matter the
â¢ .situation is somewhat complicated and
.altogether too delicate for a man of
.Pardee's caliber to handle with finesse.
: Alameda has two candidates for
county officersâ O. L. Rogers for Sher
â¢ iff and Joe Barber for Tax Collector,
the latter to succeed himself. "Robin-
Son is also a candidate for Tax Collec
tor, and it is because of this" ambition
that he was obliged to resign from the
â County. Committee. But Robinson did
â¢\ hot resign until Pardee had assured
â¢ : himself that his stanch supporter, Clar-
. ence Crowell, was safe for election, vice
.; Robinson. Now, the return for this
fealty on the part of the ex-committee
man was the assurance of the support
â '* of Dr. â¢ Pardee's paper in his fight for
:â  the nomination for the Tax Collector
ship; and naturally the Alamedans do
"not. take kindly to the turning down of
their own man, Barber, by the doctor's
.personal organ. It is not surprising
â¢.that they find their enthusiasm for Par
dee waning and the sentiment in favor
of an unlnstructed delegation to Sac
ramento growing in proportion in their
town. , â¢ ' ; ...> v
.. The past week has brought another
â¢.turn in the situation that promises
fresh trouble, and plenty of it, for Par
" dee. "When Victor Metcalf entered the
-lists for the Third Congressional nomi
nation he devoted all his energies to
' keeping that fight entirely separate
.from all other entanglements. It was
â¢ through Metcalf's efforts that the
â¢ county committee voted to hold sepa
rate primaries to- elect delegates to the
two conventions, and he has steadfast
ly refused to enter Into any alliance.
Therefore, it is with great disfavor that
aietcalf a*'l his supporters watch the
â  growing signs of a rapprochement be
â¢ tween Hilborn and Pardee. The Third
. Congressional District Republican con
:'vention will contain 112 delegates, of
â¢which Alameda County will contribute
â¢ glxiy-nlne, or eleven more than a ma
" jority of the whole. There is no dis
guising the fact that Metcalf has this
county splendidly organized in every
precinct, with an executive committee
of foremost Republicans in the county
" who are devoting their entire time
and energies to furthering Sir. Met
' calf's Interests. These men have stead
: fastly refused to mix up with any other
..political aspirant, but have worked out
GRAPE-NUTS.
WELL FED, WELL BRED.
Proper Food Makes Brainy Men and
Beautiful Women.
to know just what to cat is a prob-
Jem for many people who find their
â¢itreneth and health not keeping up to
â a proper stage. From food we must
expert our bodily nourishment and not
from drugs. True, a physician's care
is required ;it times, but the true phy-
Ulcian will always seek to put his pa-
tient on properly selected food and
drink.
.-... A food expert has discovered Grape-
Nuts by experimenting on the treat-
ment of grains to artificially pre-digest
the starches (the principal part).
Grape-Nuts as now made by the Pos-
turn Cereal Co., Lim., of Battle Creek,
Mich., and sold by grocer* generally.
Is a deliciotta duinty, suitable particu-
larly for the brain worker, as It <jnl* â¢ lc -
ly supplies the parts of food the body
needs to supply the daily loss produced
by brain work. Unless the right food
be furnished and pn perly digested,
the. individual discovers a gradual fail-
ing and some form of disease sets up.
Users of Grape-Nuts discover that
they assist in the digestion of cream
and- other food, and that a "well fed
feeliruz" follows their ut;?.
' their, plans for months, until now they !
confidently claim they will go into the |
convention with enough votes from
1 Alameda County alone to nominate
' Metcalf, even if they do not get a single
| vote from the interior counties.
Jlllborn, on the other hand, returned
from Washington two weeks ago to find j
' his forces badly disorganized. His per- j
â  sonal manager. Friend, had been forced |
by his appointment as postmaster to
drop out of active politics, so the only
thing left for Hilborn to do was to seek
to form some combination, to unite his
strength with that of some other can
didate: There have been unmistakable
indications of late that such an alliance
i-s In process of formation, if, indeed, it
has not already been consummated be
: tween the present member and Pardee.
The most recent of these signs to come
; to the attention of the Metcalf forces
was a scheme to turn down C. O. Alex
! ander for the position of deputy post
master under Friend. Alexander, who
i is secretary of W. R. Davis' general
committee in charge of his guberna
: forial campaign, had been selected for
1 the deputyship. by Senator Perkins, and
. had received positive assurance that he
would be appointed. Now Alexander's
i brother-in-law, F. S. Brigham, is a
warm supporter of Metcalf, and the
'< scheme- was to throw Alexander over
j ostensibly . on the ground that he had
failed to whip Brigham into line for
Hilborn, but In reality because he was
booming Davis, to the. great mental
anguish of Pardee and the hindrance of
i the Hilborn-Pardee combination.. The
prompt exposure of the plotted down
fall of Alexander brought out a denial
; all around, but it is a noteworthy fact
that Arthur L. Martin, Democrat, still
retains the coveted deputyship.
In addition to exposing the secret
alliance with Hilborn to the Metcalf
crowd, the attempted overthrow of
Alexander will have the effect of in
creasing the hostility of the Davis fac
tion, and taken altogether it Is no won
der that even Pardee's friends admit
that their man is not as strong as he
was a month ago, or as they Ingeni
ously put it, that Davis has gained
strength in that time.
A rumor was in circulation to-day
that Henry P. Dalton had determined
i not to seek re-election as County As
sessor, but instead, would go before the
Republican State convention as a can
didate for the nomination of State
Controller. Mr. Dalton was asked by
The Call correspondent to-night if
there was any foundation for the
rumor. â¢ â  ' â¢â¢
"Aboslutely none." replied Mr. Dal- ;
ton. "I do not want the office and am
not seeking -It. I would like another
term Â«s County Assessor and. am a
candidate for that office. I have no â¢;
idea how such a report could have \
star-ted."
In the big fights for Governor and
Congress, the county contests are lost !
pight of just now, and the people will '
pay little or no attention to them until
after the State convention meets.
DARRELL ORTH HAS
A NEW GUARDIAN
THE MOTHER'S PETITION DE-
NIED BY JUDGE HALL.
Mrs. Prescott Resigned and the Sen
sational Trial Came to an
Abrupt Termination.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 3.
Mrs. Prescott practically won In the
Darrell Orth case this morning and the
suit ended very abruptly. Yesterday a
bundle of subpenas was issued on vari
ous well-known citizens to appear at the
hearing of the case to-day, and It was
expected that some sensational matters
would be delved into.
When the case opened Judge Hall stated
that he did not care to hear any more
testimony and denied Mrs. Orth's peti
tion for a change of guardian.
The next step was taken by Mrs. Pres
cott's attorney, who asked the permis
sion of the court to file her resignation
as guardian of the child. This also was
accepted, and then on the application of
the lad's mother District Attorney Snook
was appointed his guardian. Mrs. Pree
cott seconded the proposal to make Mr.
Snook the guardian, saying that her so
ciety alwnya tried to relinquish guard
ianships in favor of reliable people.
This is a victory for Mrs. Prescott, as it
carries the presumption that the alleged
acts on her part making her an Improper
guardian were not sustained. Neither
w.i.-- the charge against her general repu
tation touched. On the other hand, Mm.
Hurt ell Orth hns gained her point by ob
taining a change of guardianship, which
Mrs. Prescott was willing from the nr>t
to grant. There is no doubt that had
the matter been fought out as bitterly
as it wan commenced much unpleasant
ness would have been engendered.

and, as? he said, "he would show them
how Dewey did it," proceeded to demol

the plateglass windows and smashed tne
showcases on the counter inside, besides
sending bottles and their contents flying.
The noise attracted the attention of
Officer Joe Leonard, who was on duty on
Mission street, and upon his arrival Wil

AN OVERDUE SHIP ARRIVES
Long Passage of the Henry Clement
Caused by Anti-Fouling
Paint.
The German ship Henry Clement ar
rived at Santa Rosalia on July 26 from
Hamburg. She was 235 days making the
passage, and 50 per cent reinsurance was
paid on her. In his report the captain
says the vessel's hull was coated with a
new anti-foullng paint before leaving
Hamburg, and instead of keeping the ves
sel clean it gathered every barnacle in the
Atlantic and Pacific. In consequence the
Henry Clement became unmanageable and
could only be steered when it was blow
ing a gale. Hence the, long voyage.
The new schooner Queen of the Isles,
built for the- Caroline Islands trade. Is to
be fitted with auxiliary machinery by the
Union Gas Engine Company. The en
gines are to be fifty horse power and
are expected to drive the vessel at a
speed, of ten knots. A four horse power
tender for use among the islands is also
to be put aboard the vessel. The Queen
of the Isles Is to have her trial trip on
the 10th inst., and will sail for Kusal a
few days later. Among her passengers
will be the Rev. Mr. Cannon and a num
ber (if missionaries.

richs and wife and Miss Virginia Fair,
and R. Y. Hayne and K. B. Mitchell for
W. S. Good fellow and the trustees;
The argument was on two appealsâ one
from the decision of Judge Slack quieting
title tv realty un Montgomery street and !
the other from the order i>!" the Probate I
Court granting a partial distribution to
the children of Fair. The appeals were
virtually taken from the decree declaring
invalid 'the. -wil* of Senator Fair. In this
decree Judge Slack took the position that
the will, on account of the. trust clause,
was invalid, the clause not being recog
nized as legal by the Code. The argument
hinged upon- the last clause of the will,
which created, the trust in that it pro
vided that the remainder of the estate, I
after bequests of about '$710,000 to certain
relatives and charities, should bo Intrust
ed to three trustees, who were to have
and hold the same In tru.st during tne !
lives of the decedent's two daughters and '
â¢one son. . '
Mr. Hayne took the position that tho
â¢ trust was legal and not outside the Code,
as it was only to operate during- the lives
of the beneficiaries, and that the will
could not be legally set aside. He main
tained that the . late Senator did not
think that, his children were capable of i
managing his large property, and Bo
placed It In the hands of trustees.
Judge .Wheeler made the point that the
first paragraph of the will was a direct
conveyance of tltl*- to the. trustees and
that the testator elected' to become and
was hiÃ' own. conveyancer. The s<>l.' ques- ,
tion for the Supreme Court to deride, he !
held, was the .intention of Senator Fair,
and that If that Intention was Illegal the
will Is necessarily Invalid. Judge Pater
son argued that it was not a trust to con- â 
vey but 'Â« direct devise. The trust clause i
invalidates the will In toto.
At 430 o'clock in the afternoon tho Jus- !
tlcos decided to take the- matter under
advisement.
Irish. Soil for Fair Arrives.
The lady ami gentlemen mfmbem of the
Knights of St. Patrick met last Night at
the California Hotel to arrange for the
American booth at the Irish fair, Mrs. J.
S. Fennel presiding.
It was decided to have a children's cor
ner in the booth, where toys and knick
knacks WOUld be on sale. The handsome
flag presented by Mayor Phelan was re
ported to have been received and will be
put on exhibition at some downtown
business house before the opening of thÂ«.
fair. The society which receives the most
votes will be presented with the flag.
During the fair there will be a minuet
danced on the platform of the American
booth two evenings of the week. Ar
rangements have been made to secure
dancers and the proper instructors. The
booth will also have a supply of goods
from H. S. Crocker, which will be for
sale. Small flags will also be sold in
this booth.
On Saturday evening, August 13, O'Con
nor and Kelfeher will give an entertain
ment, the prominent feature of which will
be Irish dancing, at Golden Gate Hall,
the proceeds to be given for the fitting
out of the American booth.
The genuine Irish coil that was ordered
some time ago has arrived in this city.
Wayward Boys in Trouble.
During the month of July sixty boys
were arrested by the police of the Seven
teenth-street station on San Carlos ave
nue and Minna street, between Eighteenth
and Nineteenth. In both of those sec
tions the youngsters have become so an
noying to" the neighbors that complaints
were lodged with Captain Gillen. He de
tailed a posse of his men to arrest them.
The gang in San Carlos avenue had be
come so daring that the milkmen and
drivers of bakery wagons refused to sup
ply their customers, as the boys took de
light in stoning the unfortunate drivers,
besides raiding the wagons and carrying
away a portion of the contents. The ages
of the boys range from 12 to 20 years.

Fire in a Cemetery.
By the careless throwing of a lighted
cigarette among the dry grass in the
Mission Dolores Cemetery at Sixteenth
and Church streets yesterday afternoon
a fir" started which necessitated calling
cut the department. The application of
water for a few minutes succeeded in ex
tinguishing what might have been a de
structive fire. The fenc-s -surrounding
a few of the graves and the crosses
which marked the last resting-place of
some old pioneers, were burned. Father
Brennan, the pastor of the churrh. was
weii pleased that nothing more serious
resulted from the fire.

were entertained by the members of Com
pany O, Z* C. C, at a low jinks given last

St. Mary's College. â¢
An Interesting feature of the evening's

IN AID OF ST.
PATRICK'S BAZAAR
SUCCESSFUL ENTERTAINMENT j
â  AT UNION SQUARE -HALL.
Nearly Every Parish in the City Rep
resented â Coming Event at i
Odd Fellows' HalL
Another successful entertainment in aid
of St. Patrick's Bazaar was given last
evening at Union. Square Hall by the
ladles of St. Joseph's Booth under the
personal direction of Mrs. . J. Kearney.
The hall was crowded to its utmost capa
city long before the indicated time for
commencement. People from nearly every
section of the city attended in large num
bers and showed their appreciation, of the
efforts of those under whose auspices the
entertainment was given by the unusual
patronage. >'
The programme presented was entertain
ing and instructive, there being many Be
lections of unusual merit. Among â¢ its
various features was a soprano solo by
Miss Margaret Ryan and another by Miss
Frances Hausman, various character spe-
I cialties by Master Fay Doughtery and a
number of popular songs by Miss Rose
Bennt t, assisted by her sister Miss Belle
Bonnet.
The Interest and enthusiasm manifest
i ed by the general public in the coming
bazaar which will be held in the last part
of next month seem to increase as the
time for its formal opening grows near.
As it is the first time that the clergy cf
St. Patrick's Church have asked for as
sistance in making the necessary re
pairs to the old edifice on Mission street â
the fundamental object of the bazaar â
Catholics as a whole and even those out
side the faith seem to have and are tak
ing an active Interest in furthering i tho
object contemplated. Entertainments
have been given and with success, : and
other means equally efficacious financially,
have been resorted to in order to realize
the necessary money in defraying the ex
penses of arranging the preliminary work
for the coming fair. The entertainment
given last night is the last but one to bÂ»>
placed . before the charitable public be
fore the bazaar Is formally opened. . The
final one is to bo held August 19 at Old
Fellows' Hall under the auspices of the
Indies of the Charity Booth. The pro
gramme as planned will include literary,
and musical selections,- an address by
Father Gallagher of St. Ignatius Church
and a comic opera by the members of tho
Olivette Opera Company.
A NEW PHASE IN
THE EMERIC CASE
SPECIAL ADMINISTRATOR A. C.
FREESE RESIGNS.
â¢ '
Could Not Get Control of All the i
Property Without Bringing
Suit, So He Quit.
Public Administrator Freeso now re
grets that he entered the legal arena as
an opponent to Lorena Myrtle Barbler,
who anxiously sought for special letters ;
of administration on the estate of her j
deceased sister, Eugenic Emeric. Acting
on the suggestion of Harry Emeric, hus
band of the decedent, and his attorney, i
Krnnk H.- Gould. Freese vigorously op- |
posed the application of Miss Barbler and!
came out victor. . Flushed with his sue- i
ci ss he turned for further aid to Emerle â 
and his attorney. Who had been instru- !
mental in his appointment, . and ;
asked them to turn over- the control and!
management of properties belonging to
the estate situated in Contra Costa Coun- :
ty. Ilia application wus refused/ how
1 ever, but Enteric and counsel insisted
thatthe administrator make a demand on
Miss Barbier for some $io,ouo worth of
diamonds and }VÂ»n> worth' .of personal
property which belonged to Mrs. ETmerlo 'â 
in her life time. ' FreeHO insisted that he
should have entire control of .the estate,
which was d.nied him, and rather than
sue those who had placed him in the po- i
sition of special administrator of the es
tate, he handed in his resignation to
Judge Troutt yesterday. It was accept
ed ,-iiid a new administrator must be ap- j
pointed at once. The application of Miss
Barbler Is still before tho court ami
Thursday it will be heard. It Is hardly
likely, however, that afiss Barbwr win be i
granted special letters, as Judge Troutt
held, when he appointed Frocsa, that, ow- 1
ing to the clash of Interest and the con
test between Emeric and Miss Barbli r,
an unbiased administrator should be ap- â¢
pointed to act until the conclusion of I
litigation.
Assessor Bailey Won.
The Jury In the case of James Bailey
against Assessor Bailey of Sacramento j
for $10,WÂ» damages for fraudulently over
assessing the old postolnce property on i
the corner of Fourth and X streets in that
city, returned a verdict in the United
States Circuit Court yesterday morning in j
favor of defendant. The defense set up. ;
was that the Assessor must take Into con- ; !
sideration the rent-producing value of the
property in making his assessment. El
wood Bruner was the attorney for the de
fendant.

TROUBLES OF
AN UMPIRE
Adventures of Charley
Sweeney at Fresno.
IS ARRESTED AND VILIFIED
OUTCOME OF DECISION AGAINST
THE HOME TEAM.
Jiaisin City Rooters Show Great Depth
of Feeling in All Matters
That Concern Their
Cluh.
BY JOE CORBETT.
At Fresno, last Sunday, the Sand Crabs
defeated the team representing the Raisin
City In a close and brilliant game, by the
score of 2 to 1.
The closeness of the contest necessitat
ed a keen sense of sagacity and a lack
of diffidence on the part of Mr. Sweeney,
â¢who was umpire. These qualities he had
In perfection, as was shown by him When,
In the last inning, he rendered a decision
which was extremely close In favor of the
Beachcombers. The decision was on a
play at the plate, and it gave the Sand
Crabs their first run, which tied the score.
Immediately after, with a man on third
base and another run needed to win the
game, Strieb hit a grounder to short stop.
Instead of throwing to the plate and en
deavoring to shut off that winning run,
this foolish short stop threw to first and
permitted the man on third to cross the
plate and win the game. So far so good.
Looks of disappointment greeted Sween
ey's rendition of the close decision at the
plate, but nothing more. The crowd
wended its way homeward, extolling the
work of the home boys, particularly that
-of Borchers, the pitcher, while the two
"teams filed their way to their different
tootles, and mind 3 r ou, nothing said about
that close decision; for both factions knew
Jt to be correct.
After a hasty bath, supper followed, and
then the usual promenade or congrega
tion In front of the hotel.
Mr. Sweeney, having nothing else to
do, strolled down the street, and with
out being previously admonished, was
Burrounded by a number of Fresno root
ers who had as their spokesman Catcher
Mangerina. Without any provocation
whatever he abuÃed ana Insulted
Mr. Sweeney. For this he received a slap
on the cheek, which was accompanied by
the remark: "If you were not so small
I would lick yon good," and adding, "if
'there is any one in the crowd who would
like to take this up 1 will accommodate
him."
It is needless to mention that they per
mitted Sweeney's challenge to pass un
noticed and dispersed. 1 am informed by
an observer that the rapidity of their
flight was indescribable.
The telegraphic account of this mix
up was Incorrect, stating as it did that
Sweeney knocked Mangi rina down. He j
simply slapped him. and for the trutn of
this statement I have the word of the en
tire Santa Cruz team, including its man-
ager.
Just as soon as this fight* or, rather,
chastisement occurred. Manager "Warde
of the Fresno team swore out a warrant
for Sweeney's arrest, and without a i
chance for an explanation he was put in
jail and his bail fixed at $250. Consterna
tion and confusion ensued for a brief pe
riod, as that amount of money was not j
to be had among the Santa Cruz play
ers or its manager. A prominent citi
zen of the town came forward, however,
and advanced the necessary amount.
Sweeney was allowed to go free with a
wink from the Judge that all was well.
He was also told to appear next morning
for trial, but this as a precaution, for he
was assured by his bondsman that it ;
was perfectly proper for hir-^to leave j
town with the Santa Cruz team. In ac
cordance with this advice Sweeney joy
fully accepted the proposition to leave
town, and boarded the first train for
this city in company with the Sand
Crabs.
On the way the deplorable and un
sportsmanlike behavior of the Fresno
manager was freely discussed.
When far into Merced County Tutle was
awakened by a severe tugging at his â¢
Bide. Angrily turning over and wonder- j
Ing who would have the impudence to
mar his rest, he was informed that the
disturber and tormenler was no other
than the constable of Newman, at which
town the train had stopped. On hearing j
the name "constable," compliance with
any old request v,-;us his first thought, and I
when told that orders had been received '
from Fresno to take into custody a Mr. |
Sweeney, Mr. Tutle was amazed, lie re- i
covered shortly, and directed the gentle- i
man to Sweeney's berth, which was dl- !
rectjy under his own.
It took but a second to- explain the Bit- j
uation to Sweeney. He was accused of !
jumping his bondÃ and must return to
Fresno. Explanations were unavailing,
bo he had to leave the train. He attempt
ed to dress himself, but time was precious j
with both railroad men and constable, j
and In consequence he was compelled to j
make a hasty retreat into the town of
Newman.
The train having 1 pulled away, and with
It all chance of immediate escape, a
dressing-room was sought in a neighbor-
Ing saloon.
The constable turned out to be a jovial !
chap, and was asked by Sweeney to have ]
a drink. Nothing suited his taste better,
and so it went on. Sweeney treating, then
the constable, then the saloon-keeper.
Believing Sweeney to be "all right,' as
he expressed it. he said "good-night."
adding that Sweeney must be on hand at
6 a. m.
This gentleman's recollections of Fresno
hospitality being fresh in his mind, do- j
elded that escape, and at once, was ex
pedient. A hurried conference was held
with the saloonkeeper as to the quick
est way to San Francisco, and It was
found that but one avenue of escape of
fered itself, and this included a long
tramp over the railroad tries to the town
of Tracy. "Anything other than a return
to Fresno" was (Sweeney's motto, and
the following story of his escape I re
ceived from him: "I started on my long
tramp for Tracy at about 3:30 a. m. and
arrived there lute in the morning. Hav
ing very little change, and not knowing
what to do, I walked up to the depot and
Inquired of a young lady in the office
what time the first train left for Stock
ton. I was informed tha*. the only train
for some time was a freight, and fearing
recapture told her that 1 was a drummer
and had fallen off the early train and
requested that she telegraph Immediately
to headquarters for an order which
would enable me to take the expected
freight train for home as I was Internally
injured and needed skilled medical at
tendance. I must have charmed her with
my story for she set to work and short-
Sy after came my order to board the
freight. This I did In due time and on
arriving at Stockton caught the first
train for the city."
go ended the trouble of an umpire.
What! oh. what: is this baseball world
coming to when an umpire dare not g\vi
a. decision against the home tc-um without
endangering his future prospects?

AN UPRISING
IS EXPECTED
Chinese Provinces Are
in a Ferment.
FOOD IS VERY SCARCE
G. E. SEVEY TELLS OF IM
PENDING MASSACRES.
There Is Great Danger to the Mis
sionaries in Northern and
Central China.
G. E. Sevey, president of the American
Inland. Steam Navigating Company, op
erating towing launches on the Grand j
canal of China, arrived on th* Doric on
Tuesday and brings with him interesting
news from the northern and central
provinces of China. He ,â  has traveled
through those districts and possesses
a thorough knowledge of the social and
political conditions now existing through- ;
out the Chinese empire.
He fears a violent outbreak among the ;
hordes of Chinese in both the northern
and central provinces and conscientious
ly believes that a great loss of life ami
destruction of property will result. no
missionaries scattered throughout this
country, he thinks, will be the chief suf- ;
f 6rcrs
"There has been a drought in Northern \
and Central China," he said yesterday at
the Occidental Hotel, "and there will be
trouble before i long In both those dis
tricts. The rainy season in China is in
May and June, but this year there- was ;
little rain. The rice crops, which the
people depend upon for subsistence, will
be so scant and meager that destitution
is certainly impending for millions of na- ;
tives. The poorer classes have been ,
squeezed by the mandarins and Chinese ;
governors to such an extent that noth
ing is left them now but mere existence.
This year there will.be nothing for the :
governors to draw out of the people. ;
"There are several, thousand American
missionaries working in Northern and
Central China and when the uprising
comes, as I think it will, for these fam
ine-stricken- Chinese will fight for food,
they "will be one of the first to suffer.
The* American missionaries . are well
treated in China, especially by the poorer
classes.but when a Chinese population bo
comes mad in their rage for food they
level all distinctions and set about sweep
ing everything before them. They are a
rabble without a head.
"In Chinking placards about the town
warned foreigners to escape the Impend
ing wrath of the mad populace. But no
riot occurred. In the latter part of June
of this year Yang Chow was placarded. ,
Warnings were tacked to the mission
aries' gates informing them of- a. pros
pective outbreak. This has been done all
through the Yangtse Valley district. In
\Vuhu an outbreak was threatened, -but
the English Governor, acting for the Chi
nese Government, dared the mob. He fur
nished his troops with rifles and is wait-
Ing for any attack that might come. He
In turn threatened . utter destruction to
the Chinese discontents should they at- ;
tempt any violence." . I
G F Sevey was the first operator of
any steam craft on the Grand canal.
He* has been in China for a number of
years, with headquarters at Shanghai.

CORA TINNIE
ADOPTS A NEW
SOCIAL GAUGE
A Bouillon Cup for the Fair
Comedienne's Escut
cheon.
Madeline Bouton Drinks Grotto Soup While
Miss Tinnie Sips Her Broth in the
Grillroom.
The breach In the Frawley Company Is
widening. Social conditions have crept
into the- melee. Hastily improvised es
cutcheons are being brought to the front
and aspersions are exist as to the secur
ity of the marble staircase that leads to
the Grotto. Tho vital point now to be
determined is. Which Is the more aris
tocraticâto sip your broth in the grill
room or to stay a weak and . fasting
Btomach .with nourishing Grotto soup?
Otherwise T. Daniel and his interesting
family are very well, thank you, with, of
course, the exception of Miss Madeline
Bouton, who' still occupies a cot In the
itfcNutt Hospital, suffering with an af
fection of the spine.
Miss Bouton was resting more easily
yesterday, and was strong enough to con
fide to a Cull- representative her mortifi
cation and unhapplness at the published
account of her dismissal from the Fraw
ley Company and the. association of her
name In the same column with that of
her sister artiste, Cora Tinnle.
To Frawley's erstwhile leading lady the
fair Cora is "that Tinnie woman," and
the very mention of the Tinnle name
Cora Tinnie and Some Suggestions for Escutcheon
Designs for the Warring Actresses.
makes Miss Bouton remember that- she
-the dsshing. sparkling Madelineâ has a
social position to maintain, and which
she must not jeopardize by Tinnie asso
ciations. PrevfoOs to yesterday Miss Tin
nie revvled in blissful unconsciousness of
social distinctions, and hatl not even
glv^n a thought to the dividing Bouton
rinnie line. However, when the matter
tvas railed to her attention sha puckered
tier brow and thought for a brief moment
a. deep, hard thought.
"Now that I come to consider It, there
s a difference," she said. "I gauge it by
i cup of broth. I take my cup of bouillon
;h the grill room. Miss Bouton drinks
Her soup in the Grotto, and the stairs are
?o treacherous; especially for one who is
jiven to falling."
Apropos of falls Miss Tinnie does not
-emember the fall at rehearsal, the pri
mary cause of Miss Boutori'B illness.
The story of tho sick actress 1 dismissal
'rom the Frawley Company still agitates
:he minds of her numerous admirers. The
ictress denies it, despite the fact of eye
witnesses who saw the leading lady re

looked like raw beef. Sometimes blood would
come and sometimes matter. He was awfully

"I was not dismissed," Miss Bouton
said; "the report Is as absurd and unjust
as it Is untrue. Why, Mr. Frawley and
the rest of the management are more
than kind to me, and the very best of
feeling exists between us. It was at Mr.
Frawley's earnest request that I. came
to the sanitarium. Anxious to see me re

And: so it Is only on account of Air. Fraw
ley and his associates that Miss Bouton
is anxlotis to see the report of her dis
missal denied.
Respect for Frawley Is a strong point
with Miss Bouton. She seems to have an
ardent desire to keep her thoughts in his
direction. On the snowy coverlid of the
bed on which she tosses lies a letter from
Frawley. On the table at her side repose
the Immaculate visiting cards of the
firmâ Friedlander, Gottlob & Marx. Miss
Bouton has but one regret â that she may
not faithfully follow the injunctions with
which the Frawley letter aboundsâ "Don't
speak to reporters."
In addition to all her troubles, Miss Bou-
ton finds time to nurse an old wound. The
published account .of how the Bouton
heart had passed into the possession of
one Sumner 8.. Hollander is a matter of i
constant anguish to the fair lady.
"I am an engaged woman," she ex- I
plained. "That fateful night I went to !
the Grotto with a lady friend. I had been !
weak and miserable all day, and she said.
'Madeline, you must come with me and
give your poor weak stomach something
Warm.' So I went to get a cup of broth "
And that is the cup of broth Miss Tlnnie
would use upon her escutcheon.
In the world theatrical there are all
sorts of rumors concerning the Frawley
trouble. Some insist that Miss Bouton
violated the "early to bed," etc., rule and
from that insignificant breach all tho
trouble sprang.
In the Tinnie matter everything is
moving .agreeably and .smoothly. It was
?l mplj m, a , case Â° r no suitable "parts for
Miss Tinnie. The management is doing
IV s , bes i, to re P a ir the unwitting wrong and

"UJCIA" AT THE TIVOLI.
Donizetti's Favorite Opera Pleasingly-
Presented.
Two essential-}, necessary for the success
ful rendition of Donizetti's tuneful lyric
opera, "liuci-i d! Lammermoor," are full
voice and arv3tlc costuming. That the lat
fer would be fr.nndat the Tivoli goes with
out saying, but just what the new mem
bers of the company could and would do
was a rhater of uncertainty until Tuesday
night. â 
Anna Liiehter, as Lucia, gave evidence
of pure, and high tones, but she showr-d
a stiffness that will probably disappear
to-night. Kdgardo Zerui, as Edgar of
Kavenswood, sang the part well, but the
flf-etlness of his upper register at times
bordered on threudiness and the notes
were rather too thin to give perfect har
mony.
Illan ?, Pruet *. as Henry Ashton, and
William Schuster, as Hide-the-Bent were
all that could be wished. The work of
the chorus in antiphonal as well as full <
singing gave evidence of a thorough ap

DISTURBED
THE BURGLAR
AT HIS WORK
Police Looking for a
Sleek Schemer.
ALLEGED THEATRICAL MAN
ENGAGED A ROOM IN A BUSH
STREET HOUSE.
The Landlady Returns With Friends
in Time to Prevent the Thief
From Looting the
Place.
The police are Investigating the extraor
dinary actions of C. 11. Nelson, alias C.
H. Fullerton, a young man who repre
sented himself to be a theatrical man, but
\ they have reason to believe that he Is a
i notorious crook, who would not stop at
| murder to accomplish his ends.
Lust Friday night he called at the lodg
iriK-house of Mrs. Russell, 616 Bush street,
and told her that .he came from Sacra
mento to accept an engagement at the
Tivoli, and as he had been recommended
by a friend, whose name he had forgot
ten, to put up at her house, he would be
I glad if she could accommodate him. He
! only had a hand satchel with him, but
explained that his "luggage" would come
later. He paid his first week's room
J rent, and soon made himself at home.
Saturday afternoon he gave Mrs. Rus
sell three tickets for the Orpheum, and
asked her to take the other two ladies-
in tho house with her. Owing to the re
cent death of her husband, who was
killed at Seattle, Mrs. Russell told him j
she could not go, and finally Mrs. Wade,
one of the other ladies, said she would !
get the tickets changed for Sunday night, j
which was done.
Mrs. Dora Kellerman, who occupies the
suite of rooms on the ground floor, found
Sunday morning that an attempt had
been made to force open the door of her j
room. The key had been In the door, and '
It had been twisted by the efforts to j
turn It. That afternoon Mrs. Russell j
went to Holy Cross Cemetery to visit the j
grave of her husband, and about 5
o'clock Nelson knocked on Mrs. Wade's
door, and when she opened it he apolo- j
glxed and said he thought it was Mrs.
Russell's room. His object evidently was
to locate Mrs. Russell's room, but Mrs.
Wade did not gratify his curiosity.
All the roomers had left the house by
8 o'clock Sunday night, except a Mr. Fel- j
ton, who occupies a room on the top floor. !
Mrs. Russell, after returning from the ;
cemetery, met a lady friend. Mrs. Gratto,
and a gentleman friend of her late hus- i
band, and went and had dinner With
them. They accompanied her home about ,
half-past 8 o'clock. Mrs. Russell, on go- ;
ing upstairs, hoard a peculiar noise in the
bath room, and on opening the door
found Nelson there. He made some lame j
excuse and disappeared from the house, i
taking his hand satchel with him.
When Mrs. Kellerman returned she
found hor trunk wide open. An examlna- I
tion showed that the lock had been forced ,'
open with a "Jimmy," and the contenrg
had b<;en turned over for money or jew- '
elry. She had- fortunately taken her j
purse and jewelry- with her. It was evi
dent that Nelson had been disturbed m !
bis work on the trunk and had slipped j
out of the bedroom door and upstairs
when he heard Mrs. Russell and her j
friends return to the house. He had lc?s
than half an hour to do his work In.
Mrs. Russell lias a valuable lot of jew- !
elry. and that was possibly knovn to j
Nelson.
Nelson Is described as about 5 feet 8 '
inches tall, about 23 years of age, smooth !
shaven, dark complexion, and wore a !
Prince Albert coat, dark trousers and i
black dicer. He was very pleasant In his
conversation.

DISASTROUS
ENDING OF A
GOLDEN DREAM
Collapse of the Klondike Boom.
Hits Hard the Humboldt's
Charterers.
Baron yon Schroeder Loses Heavily in the
Venture and Is Now Glad to Be Rid
of the Steamer.
The steamer Humboldt has been with
drawn from the Alaskan trade and the
people who chartered her are now wish
ing they had never heard of the gold
fields on the banks of the Yukon. Among
the sufferers Is the Baron yon Schroeder.
He Is said to be out to the extent of $100,
000 on the venture, but then the money
cannot be counted a total loss as his ship
ping experience, acquired while handling
! a "Klondike rush," is surely worth
something. The Baron went Into the
scheme with his eyes open, but now, ac
! cording to the water front, he knows a
j thing or two about steamboating that he
! never dreamed of before. Experienco
comes high in that line and the Baron's
cost him $100,000.
A year ago the rush to Dawson was at
its height. Men and women, too, were
tumbling over each other In the mad rush
i to reach the new El Dorado. All kinds of
vessels were pressed into service and
craft that had been In retirement for
years were pulled out of the different
creeks and put on the Dyea and Skaguay
runs. Coasters were hauled off th>ir
! regular routes and steam schooners were
| turned into passenger vessels. Colliers
haÂ«l bunks put In tfieir 'tween decks and
' steamers that had been used in the cat
| tie trade were fixed up to carry gold hunt
ers. A dozen Eastern steamers came
around the Horn to Join In the rush, while
in expectation of the spring stampede via
St. Michael and the Yukon the keels of
fully a hundred river boats were la;d and
1 ocean-going steamers were taken ofc their
regular voyages because bigger money
could be earned carrying passengers for
Of the steamers chartered at a high fig
ure the Australia was one and the Hui"
boldt another. Both were secured at $800
a day, but when the bottom began drop
' ping" out of the boom the Pacific Coast
I Steamship Company was able to cancel
| its charter of the Australia, but the char
terers of the Humboldt were not po ior- |
[ tunate. Under the terms of their con
tract they are bound to keep the vessel
for nine months at the rate of $24,000 a
month and only two-thirds of the time
has elapsed. Arrangements have now
been made, however, by which a certain
sum of money changes hands and the ves
sel Is returned to her owners.
The ostensible charterer of thP Hum
boldt was J. A. Magee Jr., but the back
bone of the venture was the Baron yon
Schroeder. An Ironclad agreement was
entered Into with the Humboldt Steam
ship Company after a great deal of bick
ering. Other people were after the
steamer so the owners set a figure and
would not abate a cent. Finally the
price was agreed upon, the Baron fur
nished a gilt-edged bond for the due per
formance of his part of the contract
and the Humboldt was turned over to the
n<:\v management.
Had the boom continued all would
have bern well, ?s the Humboldt is one
of the fastest and best equipped steam
ers on the coast. During her term of
service on the Klondike run she has
made more and faster trips than any other
vessel in the business, while the num
ber of passengers she carried has been
above the average. Still, she did not
carry enough to pay, and that was Boon
self-evident. However, the vessel was
kept going, and as each month came
around the sum of $24,000 was duly hand
ed over to the owners of the steamer,
while the charterers said nothing but
lived In hopes that business would pick
up with the opening of the Yukon River
in the spring.
In order to be ready for the rush to
Dawson via St. Michael and the Yukon,
the charterers of the Humboldt began
building two stern wheel steamers on the
Columbia River. These were named the
Came Cock and the Stag Hound. While
passing out over the river bar on their
way north the vessels were badly strain
ed, and on top of that a storm was en
countered outside. Both of them near
ly went to the bottom, and It was only
with the greatest difficulty that their
captains got them back to Astoria. They
now lie on the beach there of no use
to anybody while the owners and under
writers are fighting over them In the
The war with Spain opened before the
iukon River and the prospective gold
hunters enlisted in the army instead of
taking passage to the gold fields. The
Humboldt s first and only voyage to St.
Michael was made at even a greater loss
than was the last one to Dyea and
bkaguay, so Baron yon Schroeder decid
ed that it was time to wind up the busi
ness and get out. This he has done and
is now a poorer but wiser man.

Aydelotte's Business College.
OAKLAND, Aug. 3.â The popular
business and shorthand Institute of
Oakland has moved from the Y. M. C.
A. building back to Broadway and is
having a remarkable run of business.
The school has had a most prosperous
season since the first of January, but
the rush of business at the new location
in the Kohler & Chase block, Broadway
and Eleventh, is beyond all expectation
and all precedent for the month of Au
gust. The college moved at the close
of last week and was ready for busi
ness Monday morning, the Ist of Au
gust. .
Professor Aydelotte, the president and
manager of the institution, which is a
corporation, reports that there have
been more entries the first three days
of August this year than during the
entire month of August last year. The
friends and patrons of this local insti
tution who have watched its steady and
substantial growth for the past ten
years are glad to hear of its prosperity.
Nearly two hundred students have en
rolled since the first of January.

BAN FRANCISCO, .June 9. 1898.
DR. PIERCE & SONâ Gentlemen: Last Oc-
tober, while at Fort Bliss. El Paso. Texas, I
â sent for one of your famous "Dr. Pierces Elec- !
trie Belts." . for Rheumatism, etc.. and after
using 'it only two months -my complaints en-
tirely disappeared and I have not been troubled
â with any pain or discomfort since, r consider
your Belt to be the finest body-battery in ex-
istence, as the electric current Is both powerful
and lasting. I purchased your No. XXX .Belt,
and now, after using it several months, it is
as good as new.
I heartily recommend Dr. Pierces Electric
Belt to all sufferers. Yours gratefully .
JOHN P. ANDERSON,
Co. H. ISth Infantry. V. S. Army.
ICT: Buy no Belt till you "see Dr.' Pierces.
