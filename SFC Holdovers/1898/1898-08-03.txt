CHARLESTON, oft the island of Luzon, Philip
pines, June 29. â The long trip across the Pacific is al
most finished, and before the American army of inva
sion lies theiandthey have come so far to conquer, in which
some of them, it may well chance, have come so far to lay
their bones. â¢â -â¢;:
The California boys know now that going to w r ar is not
going to a summer-, encampment. It has been a cruise in sum
mer seas, this cruise of the Charleston and her consorts. Per
haps the summer arid the seas have been too tropical for the
perfect comfort of men bred in lands even so little frigid as the
Pacific Coast- of North America. '
These are the smaller discomforts. The greater are suf
fered by the soldier boys on the transports who, despite the
utmost care of .their officers and of the ships' officers, find
themselves improperly clad for cruising in the tropics, and con
sequently, as we. get glimpses of them now and again from the
Charleston's deck, in large measure go clad not at all; and im
properly fed by reason of the prodigality of the Government
in supplies of a quality calculated to enrich the blood in cold
climates and to irtajoe : men ill in tropic lands. Salt pork and
beans make a good basis for men to fight upon in northern
countries. Men in the tropics do not feed so highly.
This has been, altogether, a most remarkable expedition.
Never before in : the. world's history has an army been sent
over 8000 miles: of sea to invade the territory of a foe. One
third of the distance around the world we have sailed.
Genghis Khan ma rched his fierce warriors for thousands of
miles across the wilds of Central Asia; Alexander thought he
had reached the end of the world when his Greeks halted be
side the banks of the Ganges; Hannibal was credited with
breaking all records when he crossed the Alps and went down
upon the plains of Italy to find Capua; in more modern days
our British cousins have conquered and held an empire in In
dia. It has remained for the youngest and strongest of the
powers to reach put across the broad Pacific to strike at one
of the oldest and the most decrepit. It is an expedition which
will go down into history as unique. Even the humblest indi
vidual making up its components will achieve, by that partici
pation, immortality.
So much the soldier boys from California and Oregon re
alize of the main purpose of their long trip. They have, en
passant, made history by the way.
They have seen since leaving Honolulu an American
warship steani; baldly into a Spanish port, whose dangers were
an unknown quantity, throwing out her gaze of defiance ahead
of her in the .booming of her guns. They have seen the
Spanish Governor and the Spanish garrison of the island of
Guam surrender to an American show of force. They have
seen Captain -Glass of the. Charleston take his place in history
also by running up the stars and stripes on the Spanish fort of
Santa Cruz, saluting it with twenty-one guns. Finally, they
have seen the Spanish Governor of Guam and his garrison car
ried away as prisoners of war, and the fine harbor of San Luis
de Apra left for the American Government to establish a coal
ing station upon if it should be concluded, in the wisdom of
the powers that be, that the time has come for the great re
public to throw aside the outgrown swaddling clothes and
take its place as a power among the nations of the world.

to the captain's cabin, promptly told
that they were prisoners of war and
ordered to convey to the Governor of
the Ladrones, Don Juan Marina, a. de
mand from Captain Glass on behalf of
the United States Government that he
should come on troard. The gentle
men returned to shore considerably
more crestfallen than they had come,
promising:, however, that the Governor,
who was at his country house nine
miies away, would be on hand to -meet
the captain.
The Governor's secretary. Captain
Duarte, and" the Governor's interpreter
came back to the Charleston In the
afternoon with a letter from the Gov
ernor. This epistle forms a part of
the official correspondence, but it was
clear from what took place later that
its language was not at all satisfac
tory. The Spaniard was playing for
delay. Captain Glass was In a hurry
to proceed to Manila, He was not,
therefore, in a humor to accede to a
request that he come on shore to ne
gotiate, Don Juan Marina's envoy hav
ing represented that the Spanish law
would not permit that official to come
on board a foreign man-of-war. The
captain of the port, under parole, went
back to the landing at Pitl through the
coral reefs protecting the low island
of Apapa, and the interpreter was in
structed to return to the Charleston
early on Tuesday morning, June 22.
Early on Tuesday morning, In a small
boat, Lieutenant Braunersreuther, En
sign Evans, the Spanish interpreter,
myself and half a dozen stalwart Jack
ies, all well armed, pulled away from
the ship for the landing at Plti. Mr.
Braunersreuther bore a letter from
Captain Glass to Governor Marina, de
manding the surrender of the Ladrones
without condition. He had been In
structed to allow not more than thirty
minutes for the consideration of the de
mand.
In the meantime, out on the fleet
there was the greatest possible activity.
Captain Glass had not sent his navi
gator ashore without support, and we
saw later how completely we would
have been avenged had Don Juan Ma
rina-played us false at Plti. Even be
fore we left the ship all preparations
had been made for a landing party.
Oh the landing stage at Pitlâ which
is really the port of Agana, that place
affording no protection to shipping â we
waited -with what patience we might for
the Spanish officials to end theit con
sultation. Precisely twenty-five minutes
had elapsed when the Spanish Gover
nor and the three gentlemen who had
taken part in his deliberationsâ -the
captain of . the port, the doctor and
Captain Duarte of the Spanish infan
try, the Governor's secretaryâ came
down the landing with a sealed letter
addressed to Captain Glass.
Here a second surprise awaited the
dons, for Lieutenant Braunersreuther
promptly broke the. seal and handedthe
communication to an interpreter." It
was a surrender, In due form, without
condition, of everything in the way of
troops and military supplies on the
island of Guam.
Lieutenant Braunersreuther complet
ed at 4 oclock the work which he had
so well begun in the morning. Tak
ing the company of marines from the
Charleston, under command of Lieu
tenant Myers, in four boats, he pro
ceeded once more to Pitl.'
The Spanish garrison, its two officers*
Lieutenant Ramos and Lieutenant Ber
ruezo, of the Spanish naval infantry,
with guns not loaded, lounged about
the landing stage, and behind them
the Chimorro militia was lined up.
Lieutenant Myers, carrying the flag,
led his marines ashore, drawing them
up at present at the head 6f the little
wharf, covering the Spaniards. The
work of disarmament, although pa
thetic, was set about in businesslike
fashion and was soon accomplished.
Fifty-four Mauser rifles, all in good
condition, and four Spanish flags were
taken from the regulars and loaded into
the boats. Fifty-four Remington rifles,
also well kept, were taken from the mi
litia. There were also 7000 rounds of
ammunition. Then the militiamen were
set at liberty, the Spanish regulars, lit
tle more than boys, were loaded upon,
a sampan with their officers and the
Governor and all transferred on board
the Sydney, which vessel had been
called inside the bay to receive the
prisoners. C
The guns and ammunition and flags
were of course brought aboard the
Charleston. It was, all in all, as neat
a bit of work as was ever done in war.

. CHARLESTON, in the Harbor
of San Luis de Apra, island of
Guam (or Gaujan), June. 20.â The ex
pedition for the occupation of Manila
and the relief of Admiral Dewey be
gan making history very soon after
leaving Honolulu. We had done some
thing of that, possibly, at the chief sea
port of the Hawaiian Islands, but it
haa been in a small way and entirely
among friends. The whole character
of the play changed when we had left
our cheering friends, the Hawaiians,
behind us and breasted the long swell
of the blue Pacific, really en route at
last for the enemy's country- It was
the enemy's country, moreover, in grim
lament. The boys in blue nor the
Jackies of the Charleston were out to
do spectacular politics. -
It was on Saturday, June 4, the
Charleston, with the City of Peking,
the Australia and the City of Sydney
under convoy, sailed out- of .the harbor
of Honolulu bound for Manila. The
ships, per sailing orders issued by Cap
tain Glass, fell into the positions they
were to keep, on th-e Jong 0000-mile
cruise to Manila. The Peking took
position on bur port quarter, 800 yards
from the cruiser, and there she has
hung with marvelous persistence ever
since. The Australia was the same
distance away on the starboard quar
ter, keeping her position well at all
times, and the Sydney was, or should
have been, 800 yards off the starboard
quarter of the Australia. Sometimes
she was in position, at other times she
was almost haiH down -astern, and at
still other times she would be miles
away to starboard, and seemingly
headed to cross the bows of the Aus
tralia. The Sydney's erratic sailing,
in fact, was the one constant source
of entertainment for the squadron. She
behaved alike in no two days in suc
cession, and speculation was always in
order as to what she would do on the
next day. Her erratic sailing ended
after we left the island of Guam.
Captain Glass did not "know whether
a Spanish gunboat might have been left
at one of the Carolines, and did not
propose to take chances of losing ope of
his transports. The Sydney was given
orders accordingly, and kept her place
for the balance of the cruise.
On Sunday, June 5, it began to be
whispered about the ship that there
would be something of more than usual
Interest when the crew was called to
general muster at 9:30 a. m. It was one
of those whispers starting nobody
knows how, but the air of expectancy
about the ship when the crew assem
bled was visible in the faces of officers
and men alike. The rumor had basis,
moreover. The skipper had the officers
grouped about him on the quarterdeck,
and in the presence of the whole crew
stated that he had received from Wash
ington per the Peking sealed orders
which he had not opened until out of
sight of land. By these orders he was
directed- to proceed to the island ef
Guam, or Guajan, in the Ladrone group,
and destroy the Spanish shfps and for
tifications he might find there. It had
been reported at Honolulu that there
was ojie Spanish gunboat, possibly two,
at the port of Agana, or Guam.
In the meantime Captain Glass
changed the course of the squadron,
heading down for Guam. The Island

Is In 13 decrees north latitude, a little
south of Manila. The run down was
not without grim preparation for what
every man on the fleet believed! might
be a sharp battle. Executive Officer
Blocklinger, his hand upon every part
of the ship, doubled the drill of the
j crew without seeming to inflict any
I hardship upon the men. They jumped
to their work in a way that told of a
realization that the time for business
had come. On Monday, June 13, there
was more wigwagging to the fleet, and
presently the Peking steamed ahead of
the Charlest6n and began dropping
boxes overboard for targets. The crews
sprang to their guns in a way that
would have dane your heart good to
see, and on the Peking the soldier boys,
crowded Into the rigging, cheered the
Jackies on as the subcaliber bullets
from the big guns went skipping across
the blue waves. There was more of
this target practice on the 15th, and on
the 17th of June I heard on board, for
the first time, the boom of big guns.
The ships had been hove to in mid
ocean, and Captain Glass, calling away
his gig, was rowed across to the Austra
lia for a consultation with General An
derson and the fleet commander prior
to the attack on Guam, There he was
presently Joined by Captain Gilson and
Captain Smith from the Peking and
Captain Pillsbury from the Sydney.
Then the transports ran ahead a mile
dr. more while the Charleston dropped
a target overboard and proceeded to
demolish it with her main battery. It
was wonderful shooting. Sixteen shots
in all were fired, two from each gun,
and if a Spanish ship had been lying
where the target was not one single
shell of the lot would have failed to de
stroy her. It would have been wonder
ful work for any crew in the navy.
When it is considered that many of the
Charleston's crew were listening to the
roar of these guns for the first time the
matter goes beyond mere wonder. They
were green boys a month ago, and they
were behaving now like veterans.
Captain Glass came back to the ship
after a couple of hours, the several
commanders returned to their ships,
and the fleet was put in motion again.
The island of Guam was not far to
seek now. Two days more of sailing
would fetch it, and whatever chanced
there the line of action had been agreed
upon.
On Sunday afternoon, June 19, the
ships were hove to once more, and
PHot Hallett was taken on board the
Charleston from the Australia, and
Father McKinnon f.Eom the Peking.
Naval Engineer Leopold was also taken
from the Peking, to act on the cruiser
in case of emergency.
Then the ships were squared away
again. Navigator Braunersreuther had
figured that he would get the landfall
in the island of Guam at daylieht on
June 20. It was precisely ,5 o'clock on
the morning of that day when the cliffs
of the island came into view through
a tropical shower. The whole squadron
approached the coast rapidly to a point
where the houses of Agana were
plainly visible about three miles off on
the port bow. Here the transports
dropped behind, while the Charleston
ran close in shore to look for a gun
boat, finding no sign of one. It was
seen by the nature of the place that
if any Spaniard lurked about the
island, he would be found in the har
bor of San Luis "de Apra, six miles to
the southward. To San Luis de Apra,
therefore, the Charleston took her way,
the transports following at a safe dis
tance. The day's entertainment was
about to begin. , , â2

Evidence That tfye Boys' Most Despicable Foes

ABOARD THE TRANSPORT
CITY OF PEKING, CHINA SEA,
June 29.â When old General Sher
man ventured the suggestion that
war jv-as akin to the sort of hereafter
that overtakes the evildoer of this
earth he unconsciously gave a remark
abiy true prophecy in regard to the life
of the First California Volunteers
aboard the good ship City of Peking.
On the morning of June 4 we left
Honolulu and started, under the pro
tection of the Charleston, on what we
" then thought was to be an uninter
rupted trip across five thousand miles
of ocean to Manila. The discipline,
which had been greatly relaxed during
our three days' stay in port, was again
tightened; messes were organized,
drills enforced, 'inspections carried out
and all hands were commencing to set
tle down into the monotonous routine
of life aboard ship when on the second
day out a signal from the Charleston
eyed the news that our first stop
would be at Guam, aji island of the
Ladrone group. The place was to be
captured, the American flag raised over
it and we were the regiment chosen to
assist the Charleston in the work.
This is all that was positively known,
tvut it was enough. The' imaginations
of the boys supplied all the details that
;in Glass arid General Anderson
â â : t.ed to impart. The wildest ru
mors at once became the theme of gen
era! disrupsinn and for the next twelve
the only word heard on board the
Peking was "r.uam." As our own regi
mental officers, with the possible ex
ception of the colonel, were as ignorant
of Guam and all ta that
place as the privates and as I am here
aa an enlisted man and not as a cor
respondent r tried to find out some
thing by asking those who were doing
most of the talking. The result of my
investigations was rather startling.
I learned that Guam was a continent,
island, peninsula, isthmus and cape;
that it had three millions of inhabi- j
tants, and that not a person lived j
there; that there were two gunboats,
three forts and fifteen thousand soldiers
it the place. Also that no official save
Â« blind collector of customs had been
Ui Guam for over thirty years past;
that we were to capture the gunboats,
ttorm the forts and slaughter the Span
ish soldiery- Likewise that our mission
was one of peace and we were merely
going to drop in for a friendly chat, a
little fresh water and a few cocoanuts.
â  After collecting this information I de
sisted.
But the days wore on, work and drill,
gossip and play, retrospection and an
ticipation combining to help the hours
along.
; The hours for meals were changed
and the boys fed ala tropic. At 6:45
reveille was sounded, and all hands
lined up for rollcall. Then came break
fast, consisting of two biscuits that a
quartz-crusher would have had trouble
to digest, and a half-filled tin cup that
contained a mixture alleged to be cof
fee. Sometimes this decoction con
tained sugar; more often it did not.
Those among us who had money would
go down to the sailors' mess and pur
chase biscuit and coffee on which we
could make a meal. For, be it known,
that Uncle Sam feeds his regular en
listed men of the army and navy well;
moreover, he appoints officers and "non
corns" who know how to look after the
rank and file and see they get that
which is their due. Men who leave
comfortable homes and give up good
positions from motives of pure patriot
ism are left to get along as best they
may.
After breakfast comes an inspection
of arms and accoutrements. The man
] who has over an inch of rust on his
] rifle is sure to be punished by at least
I twelve hours in the guardhouse, where
â  he drinks cold water and gently re
i creates himself by pulling a punkah
| when the officers dine.
Following inspection comes setting
up exercise and then sick call. Those
who are ill go down to the doctor,
where they acquire a pill, the panacea
for all troubles, and considerable pes
simism, while their brethren of good
health and uninterrupted digestion take
to the bath.
The bath is a great institution, and
about the only consolation the enlisted
man has. Large cans, with their bot
toms punctured, are rigged up in dif
ferent parts of the vessel, a hose is
run into them at the top and a delight
ful saltwater shower is the result. The
hours for bathing are about 10 o'clock
in the morning and late in the after
noon. The boys strip naked, and, as
long as the water is allowed to run,
laughing, struggling, skylarking groups
of young soldiers are to be seen wrest
ling with one another under the sparkl
ing salt sea water that comes splash
ing down over them. ,
With the conclusion of the bath is

finished the last routine occurrence of
the day save the rollcall at retreat in
the evening. Meal hours in most com
munities and under most circumstances
are generally supposed to be routine
occurrences, as they generally come
around with more or less regularity.
But as on the Peking the regularity is
considerably less than more, I can
hardly class our mess as a regular rou
tine institution, whether speaking of
the hours at which the meals are served
or the material of which they are com
posed.
If things are propitious and there has
been no more than the average amount
of rascality around the commissary de
partment, we are sure of receiving
about half or three-fourths of a ra
tion of beans, salt pork and coffee with
anywhere from no ration at all to about
a one-half ration of sugar. Bread ac
companies this delightful menu when
we are fairly lucky. Sometimes it is a
little hard bread, sometimes it is a lit
tle soft bread; It is never enough of
either.
The hours at which thi - "atlon is
supposed to be served are 10:30 in the
morning and 4:30 in the afternoon. As
a matter of fact the men are- served
when the cooks at the galley have tired
of the pastime of quarreling with each
other and wish to experience a diver
sion by giving the food to the men and
then listening to those unfortunates in
turn curse the cooks, the commisary,
one another and everything else con
nected with the army.
There must certainly be something

wrong somewhere. Since the regiment
left home there has not been a single
meal served that has contained any
! thing like the full ration, and in several
instances the tupply has been so short
that, though no one was given enough,
I yet many went to bed without anything
I at all.
Moreover, the food that is served is
I so unsuited to the climatic conditions
! In this part of the world that many of
j the boys are covered by terrible sores
| from the top of their heads to their an
kles. The sores are generally accom
i panied by a painful swelling which, in
I some cases, has completely closed the
eyes of the unfortunate sufferers. The
| medical staff has termed this malady
"water pox," and they tell us it is quite
common on long sea trips. Perhaps it
! is, but I have had some little experience
afloat and have never known of a sim
ilar trouble on a thirty-day voyage with
two stoppages in it.
When not lining up for meals, bath
ing, or performing some duty assigned
to them the boys lie around the decks
and play cards, sing or teh stories. Reg
ulation costume is not insisted on in the
warm weather and as a consequence
! every sort of costume may be seen, the
favorite' one being a pair of trousers
and a smile.
From the way the rain falls in these
latitudes I am inclined to believe the
angels congregate near the equator to
weep over the sins of fallen humanity
and that the night is the particular
time chosen for the celestial lamenta
tion.
The atmosphere below is so hot, close
and foul that it seems like a cross be
tween purgatory and hades. As a con
sequence all hands would bring up
their blankets immediately after re
treat had sounded and proceed to make
themselves comfortable on deck. They
would get nicely settled when a weep
ing contest would be called and the
tears would fall in such profusion as
to form one solid sheet of water. Then
there would be a hurried bundling of
mattresses, pillows and blankets and
the boys would fall over each other
getting below.
On June -20 Guam was sighted and,
concealed by a heavy mist and frequent
rain squalls, the four /vessels, the
Charleston in the lead, stood in toward
the land.
We remained in the harbor of Guam,
which is called San Luis de Aprs Until
late in the afternoon. The men were
not allowed ashore in a body, only
those going who were sent after pro
visions. Colonel Smith took a trip to
the little native village of De Apra. and,
wishing to take in everything that was
coming, insisted on riding in a native
canoe. He was accompanied by Cap
tain Kelleher. They are both gentle
men built on rather a grand scale, as
becomes the exalted stations which are
theirs. Their united weight was too

much for the canoe, which went under
and the two officers were pulled into
another boat, presenting a picture more
watery than warlike.
The day before we left the Sydney
came Inside and anchored with the rest
of the fleet. One of the Oregon boys
on board her had died outside and was
buried at sea. Who he was or what
the cause of his death we did not learn
on board the Peking.
On the 28th land was sighted a little
before noon, and shortly afterward the
smoke of a steamer appeared on the
horizon. The stranger approached
rapidly and soon came near enough to
enable us to distinguish the Baltimore's
familiar lines. She sent a boat aboard
the Peking for her mail and received
it, though she could tell us nothing in
return save that she had been waiting
in the vicinity for eight days expecting
our arrival.
The Baltimore Joined the fleet forma
tion, and the five vessels passed to
gether through the Straits of Bashee
an 1 Into the troubled waters of the
China Sea.
During the night an j English tramp
steamer and ' a stranger, . whose na
tionality we did not learn, were sighted
and the Baltimore chased them until
she succeeded in satisfying herself that
they were what they purported to be. .
Shortly' after sighting land a very
sorrowful castrophe occurred. Private
Robert Allen of Company E, a young
man whose parents reside in Alameda,
became violently insane and had to be
taken below and strapped down. He
will be disabled and returned home as
soon as possible, as the physicians hold
out no hope of recovery for him under
the existing conditions. . What was .the
immediate cause of his misfortune I
cannot say, but when active cam
paigning under a tropical sun com
mences it will be fortunate: if we have
not many such cases to report.
Fortunately, with the number of men
aboard ship, the exceedingly hard de
tails, such as bunk scrubbing, guard
duty below, decks and kitchen police,
come so seldom that a man has plenty
of time to recover from the fatigues of
his twenty-four hours' duty.
Probably the hardest regular duty of
th_- life aboard a transport is that con
nected with the culinary department.
As soon as the man chosen for the de
tails awakens in the morning' he reports
to the galley and from there until long
after sunset he passes through a sort
of a horrible nightmare fraught with
l buckets of coal, water and refuse, j and
walks In the steaming mists of a labor
ious trance. Could some of the mothers
left at home see their delicate darlings,
almost as naked as the day their infant
smiles first gladdened the old home
stead. in the hold of the ship' packing
heavy boxes on shoulders burled under
an inch of coal dust, flour and dirt, or
could they take a glance into the gal
ley at meal time and see the scions of
their houses and hearts, stripped to the
waist, standing over the great caul
drons and ladling out steaming pans of
beans and reeking Joints of pork, while
the perspiration streams down their
bodies, soaks their trousers and forms
puddles of water around their feet, I
am confident they would come to" the
conclusion that war is not ; all glory,
powder, gold braid and the blaring of
trumpets. '
There is one thing that the boys do
complain of, and complain bitterly.
That is the manner in which the expe
dition has been outfitted. The only ar
ticle of clothing that is regulation and
is supplied to all is shoes. Aside from
this there is not one single company
that has a complete outfit of such cloth
ing that would' be serviceable in any
part of the world, and in the whole reg
iment there is not a single enlisted man
who is fitted out, in the slightest par

LITTLE TIME LOST BY
OTIS AT HONOLULU
HONOLULU, July 27.â General Otis
has decided not to go into camp here.
It is his intention to leave immediately
for Manila upon the arrival and coal
ing of the other transports, which are
expected to reach here oh July 30.
Every one In Honolulu expected Gen
eral Otis had come to perform the cere
mony of raising the American flag, and
many came from the other islands to
witness it. It was a great disap
pointment to the visitors when it was
learned that the ceremony would not
take Place until the arrival of Admiral
Miner an the Philadelphia in the early
part of August. The Hawaiian flag on
the Executive building is the only flag
visible in Honolulu that is not the Stars
and Stripes. This city is a bunch of
American flags and colors.
The Peru finished coaling yesterday
and moved to another wharf to make
room for the landing of the Doric.
General Otis called aboard the Mo
htean. which is lying In the harbor here,
the day following his arrival, and yes
terday made an official call, accompa
nied by members of his staff, in lull
uniform upon President Dole at the
ExecuUve building General Otis was
received by President Dole and the
members of his Cabinet. A company
S the Hawaiian National Guard acted
as a guard of honor before the Execu
tlvf building while the military band
furnished m^sic during the hour of the
"SJdS* all the men from both the
Peru and the Puebla were given lunch
on grounds. The ladles
of the Red Cross were in charge and
waited upon the soldiers while the na
tive band rendered patriotic airs. This
is the first time any large number of
the men have been allowed ashore to
gether. Heretofore only several de
tachments at a time from each trans
port have been given shore leave.
Colonel Kellogg of the Fourth Cav
alry is in command of the forces on
board of the Peru, and Major Robe,
Fourteenth Infantry, is in command on
the Puebla. A regular military order
of the day is observed each day. Guards
are stationed on the ships and a con
tinual watch and lookout kept. Oc
casionally there is a fire drill aboard
to accustom the men to their duty in
such an emergency. Instead of the
usual military drill the men are put
through setting-up exercises dally after
breakfast. Aside from these exercises
and the guard detail the men have all
the day to themselves. The trip was
longer than need be aa it was ordered
that the vessels proceed slowly. By
doing this some ninety tons of coal
were saved, representing about $800.
It is expected that the other trans
ports will reach here next Saturday, in
which case General Otis says he will
sail on Monday for Manila, reaching
there, he expects, about August 25.

ON BOARD THE U. S. S.
CHARLESTON, HARBOR OF
SAN LUIS DE APRA, ISLAND
OF GUAM, June 22.â While Lieu
tenant Braunersreuther was so ably
preparing- the task which had been set
him of taking everything in Guam to
which Spain had title, and while the
Peking was transferring to the bunk
ers of the Charleston 140 tons of coal
to help the cruiser on to Manila, Cap
tain Glass was quietly preparing a dip
lomatic stroke on his own account
which would seal the work he had come
so far to do.
It is 2200 miles from San Francisco to
Honolulu, and even without the com
pleted farce of annexation Honolulu
can never be other than a dependency
of the United States. It is 3300 miles
from Honolulu to the harbor of San
Luis de Apra, which has been called the
best harbor in the middle Pacific. It is
in round numbers 1800 miles from San
Luis de Apra to Manila. It is 1340 miles
from San Luis to Yokohama. Here is
the completed chain â and the nation
that has a store of coal at the island
of Guam would be in a position virtual
ly to control the Pacific. The nation
holding Manila, if that nation be the
United States of America, must hold
the island of Guam if the farther pos
session is to be considered safe.
As a strategist of experience, above
all as a naval strategist, Captain Glass
saw this possibility at once upon en
tering the harbor of San Luis de Apra.
It was his first visit to the place, but
possibly he was no more in ignorance
when he made his way so easily
through the. coral reef than had been
the authorities who sent him there. He
saw -at once all the possibilities of the
harbor, and to-day, just after Governor
Marina and has staff had been brought
on board the Charleston, the captain
wigwagged his purpose to Captain
Gibson on the Peking, and then called
away his gig to go and raise the star
spangled banner over the heavy walls
of Fort Santa Cruz, in factâ to raise it,
in effect, over the whole Ladrone
group.
The Charleston had been cleared for
action when she steamed into the har

bor. She was still cleared for action
when, with First Lieutenant Blockiin
ger, I accompanied the captain across
the harbor, threading; the coral reefs
that surround the island on which the
old fort stands, and as the flag was
run up on the ancient structure break
ing its beautiful colors to the breeze, 21
guns belched from the Charleston;
while from the transports rame the
shrill treble of the cheers of the men.
Spain had been deprived that day of
a group of islands. The action of Cap
tain Glass in raising the American ftag
does not, in international law, amount
to the annexation of the group for the
reason that he was authorized by his
orders to leave nobody in control, but
the territory was conquered territory,
the first, absolutely, to be so won
by an American force, and the title of
America to the Ladrones is better now
than can be shown by any other na
tion under the sun.
There is the whole case In a nutshell.
The Spaniards have been dispossessed.
The Americans are ifc>t in possession,
although by the mere act of raising and
saluting the flag Captain Glass has put
America In better position to assert a
valid claim than any other power pos
sibly can be.
Of course not all the men who saw
the flag go up over the Ladrones re
alized this. They cheered the banner
they had shown their readiness to
march to death under as they would
have cheered It under any circum
stances. The far-seeing leaders of the
great expedition know that there
has been made to-day In the
far-off bay of San Luis de Apra a
move that will be felt In the diplomatic
centers of the world â that may cause
commotion in all those centers, but that
will 'never redound to the attsvi-ciiit 'a*
the United States.

End of Spanish Dominion
Throughout the West
Indies.
Our porces to HÂ°'d Mar)ila Ur)til
tfye Basis of Settlement Is
Reached.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2.â The following is an offi
cial statement given out by authority of the President to
day as to the terms of peace offered by the United States:
"In order to remove any misapprehension in regard to
the negotiations as to peace between the*. United States and
Spain, it is deemed proper to say that the terms offered by
the United States to Spain in the note handed to the
French Embassaaor on Saturday last are in substance as
follows: v . .
"The President does not now put forward any claim for
pecuniary indemnity, but requires the relinquishment of all
the claim pf sovereignty over or title to the island of Cuba,
as well as the immediate evacuation, by Spain, of the island;
also the cession to the United States and the immediate
evacuation of Porto Rico and other islands under Spanish
sovereignty in the West Indies, and the like cession of an
island in the Ladrones. The United States will occupy
and hold the city, bay and harbor of Manila, pending the
conclusion of a treaty of peace, which shall determine the
control, disposition and government of the Philippines. If
these terms are accepted by Spain in their entirety com
missioners will, be named by the United States to meet
commissioners on the part of Spain for the purpose of con
cluding a treaty of peace on the basis above indicated."
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2.â Shortly be
fore midnight Secretary Alger, as he
l^ft the White House, after a confer
ence with the President, and the ad
ministration had received no official in
formation that the Madrid Government
had accepted the terms of peace pro
posed by the T'nited States.
Unofficially the President had been
Informed that the Spanish Ministry
had accepted the terms of this coun
try for a cessation of the war. The
unofficial news reached the President
Jn the form not only of press dis
patches, but of a private dispatch from
constitutional agents of the United
States.
While this Government has strong
reasons for believing that its terms of
peace have been agreed to by the Ma
drid Government, the President is tak
ing nothing for granted. Arrangements
for pressing the war to a successful
conclusion are going forward precisely
a? If no negotiations for peace were in
progress. Notwithstanding these war
like preparations, the belief in official
circles to-night amounts almost to a
conviction that active hostilities prac
tically have been concluded. A prom
inent official of the administration
said:
"The end is near, in my opinion. The
information thus far received is unof
ficial and meager, but that it Is accu
rate In the main we have no reason to
doubt. In fact, we have reason to be
lieve it is correct."
It is understood that the reason refer
red to is contained in the private ad
vices received by the President and
from private dispatches received by
representatives of foreign governments
in this capital.
Embassador' Cambon, who Is con
ducting the negotiations for the Span
ish Government, has not communicated
so far as could be ascertained with the
President to-night, and it is probable
that the official response to the terms
proposed by the United States has not
as yet reached the French Embassa
dor. Upon its receipt it will be trans
mitted to the President without, delay.
In the event of Spain's acceptance of .
the terms proposed by this country the
first report probably will be toward an
agreement to close active hostilities
pending the drafting of a treaty of
peace along the lines of the accepted
terms.
According to precedents ordinarily
regarded, an armistice wiil be pro
claimed, and under the circumstances
this would mean the practical close of
the war.
It is pointed out, however, that sev
eral precedents have been set aside by
this Government in the conduct of the
war and in the treatment of events
which led up to it. One notable in
stance in which the recognized diplo
matic precedents were swept away was
the personal demand made by Secre
tary Day upon Minister De Lome to
know whether the Spanish Minister
was the author of the letter reflecting
upon the President. Another preced
ent was relegate^o the past when the
Government deciden to return to Spain
the prisoners of war taken with the
surrender of Santiago.
Precedents have been disregarded in
other Instances by this Government. In
view of this fact, therefore, precedent
S may not govern absolutely In the con
duct of the peace negotiations.
After the proclamation of an armis
tice, diplomatically the next step would
be the designation by the President of
the Commissioners to represent the
T'nited States in the conduct of the
I final negotiations of peace. The terms
j proposed by this Government provide
' for a joint commission to draft a peace
treaty and to solve the difficulty rela
tive to the future government of the
; Philippines. Again, according to the
' best accepted precedents, this Joint
I commission would meet on neutral
j ground. It has been suggested that the
: commission may assemble in Paris, but
j as yet that Is the merest conjecture.
The commission might meet In either
of the belligerent countries.
Pending the conclusion of the work
of the committee, the probabilities are
j that the armies of both Spain and the
! United States will be kept in the field,
j their relative positions remaining un
1 changed during the diplomatic nego
i tiatlons. Here again, however, prece
| dent may be put aside by the United
J States, but it is regarded that this
; country will not withdraw any of the
troops from the field until a determlna-
I tion shall have been reached of all
questions in issue before the Commis
sioners.
SPAIN'S REPLY IS
IN CAMBON'S HANDS
NEW YORK, Aug. 2.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Embassa
dor Cambon received a lengthy dis
patch to-night, which Is understood to
be Spain's reply to the President's note
setting forth the terms on which the
United States is willing to begin peace
negotiations. Officials at the Embassy
were busy at a late hour deciphering
this message. They declined to state
whether or not they had received
Spain's reply, but the intimation was
clear that the Embassador would have
something to communicate to the
President to-morrow.
Up to a late hour to-night the Presi
dent had not received any official Infor
mation as to the nature of Spain's note,
which he expects to receive to-morrow.
Press dispatches from Madrid an
nouncing that Spain had accepted the
terms proposed by the *[Tnlted States
were received by the President. These
reports were generally credited by the
administration officials, and all hands
are now eagerly awaiting for confirma
tion.
ONLY THE SENATE
WOULD BE CONVENED
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2.â There will
be no extra session of Congress, though
the Senate will have to be called to
gether for the prompt ratification of
the treaty of peace. If the present plans
of the President prevail. It Is stated at
the White House that unless there
should be some extraordinary develop
ment the House will not meet until it
convenes in regular session next De
cember. This statement is made on the
authority of the President himself, in
answer to inquiries, and in contradic
tion of reports circulating among pub
lic men that Congress will soon meet to
draft legislation to meet the demands
that will follow the close of the war, as
THE SAN FRASTCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 3, 1898.
well as give formal assent on the part
of the Senate to the treaty. The mili
tary occupation of the territorial ac
quisitions of this Government will in no
wise necessitate further legislation ex
pressly authorizing the continuance of
a large military force, according to the
view of the President.
MATTERS OF DETAIL
YET TO BE ARRANGED
LONDON, Aug. 2.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Daily Mail says:
"The Government has accepted the
principal of the American conditions,
but the acceptance will not be made
public until inquiries to Washington
on matters of detail have been settled,
thus rounding off the preliminary ba
sis."
LONDON, Aug. 3.â The Rome corre
spondent of the Daily Chronicle says:
Spain, it is asserted here, has accepted
the American terms with unimportant
reservations, end the peace preliminar
ies will be signed before Saturday.
TO ASSUME LIABILITY
FOR CUBAN CLAIMS
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2.â lt Is under
stood to be the present intention of the
administration to assume all liability
for all the claims presented by Ameri
can citizens against Spain on account
of the injury to personal property in
Cuba. " Some part of this liability may
be imposed upon the Government of
Cuba later on, when that shall have
been established, to include such cases
as can be directly charged up against
the insurgents, where they have de
stroyed the property of American citi
zens in the course of their operations.
The amount of these claims against
Spain In behalf of American citizens
who suffered in Cuba was $15,000,000 at
the time of the destruction of the
Maine. It is estimated that this has
been increased to $20,000,000, and no
doubt Is entertained that there are
many other claims of large amounts
that have not yet been presented. Of
course it is not possible at this stage
to indicate what proportion of the
claims are Justly chargeable to the acts
of the Cuban insurgents, and it is
known that, in many cases, the claim
ants themselves were unable to tell the
source of damage to their property â
whether the Spanish troops or the in
surgents.
POSTMASTER GENERAL
MODIFIES AN ORDER
How Mails for the Army and Navy

WASHINGTON, Aug. 2.â Postmaster
General Smith to-day issued an order
modifying a former one prohibiting the
dispatch of mall to Spain or her de
pendencies, so as to permit postal com
munication with Ponce, Porto Rico. The
order Is similar to the one opening
communication with Santiago. Orders
have also been issued directing that all
mails for the army and navy at Ponce
be dispatched from Washington

CHICAGO, Aug. 2.â A special from
Washington to the News says: The
War and Navy Departments have re
ceived, through Cardinal Rampollo,
Papal Secretary of State, a cablegram
from the Pope expressing the keenest
anxiety for the safety of the Bishop
and clergy at Cavite. Information re
ceived at the Vatican is to the effect
that Aguinaldo and his forces have
planned the massacre of the priests
and nuns.
Immediately upon the receipt of the
Information cablegrams were sent to
General Merritt and Admiral Dewey
directing that they take every means
possible to prevent the insurgents from
harming priests. The receipt of the
news has caused much uneasiness here.
If an attempt of this kind is made by
Aguinaldo it will surely lead to a con
flict between the forces under him and
those of the United States.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2.â Officials
here make no concealment of their ap
prehension of serious- trouble to follow
the execution of our programme in re
gard to the Philippines. The reports of
the military and naval commanders of
late have contained warnings of ex
pected conflicts with the insurgents,
and no surprise will be felt at the re
ceipt of news of an outbreak at almost
any moment. The United States Gov
ernment feels that it has assumed a
moral obligation toward not only the
foreign residents at Manila, but toward
the unprotected classes of the Spanish
community â women, children, nuns and
priests.
Therefore, when the intimation came
that the insurgents were threatening
the lives of some helpless monks orders
were sent to the American military
commander to look into the matter and
to act in the interest of civilization and
humanity. As, according to report, the
insurgents have shown particular hos
tility toward the monks, it is a reason
able expectation that before long a col
lision will have occurred between them
selves and the American troops if the
latter undertake to interfere in the exe
cution of the vengeance of the insurg
ents.
Although the War Department ofll
oials will not admit that they have any
Intention of reinforcing further General
Merritt'e forces at Cavite, there is rea
son to believe that some of the troops
in Eastern camps, wl.o desire to see
active service, will sonn find the op
portunity unless the Government shall
change its present plans with respect
to the Philippines.
It is believed to be necessary, even if
our claim is limited to the terms stated
in the conditions submitted to Spain,
namely, to the military occupation ami
government of the territory on the
shores of the bay of Manila, to give
General Merritt a larger force than he
has now at his command. It Is realized
that 20.000 soldiers scarcely can be ex
pected to maintain United States pos
session and protect the inhabitants
over a territory of this extent; for It
must be remembered that the bay of
Manila is -twenty-five -miles deep from
the entrance at Corregidor Island to
the city of Manila, at its head. It will
also be necessary to possess and pro
tect a zone extending some distance
back of the city in order to make suffi
cient preservation of the water works.
Of course a considerably smaller force
would be necessary, if the insurgents
under Aguinaldo could be brought to
realize that their interests lie in per
mitting undisputed possession of this
territory by the United States. But it
would be expecting too much of the na
tive character to keep before the eyes
of the insurgents the rich loot to be had
in Manila without an adequate force to
protect the place.
Then, with the growing heat and
dampness, it is to be expected that ill
ness will develop among the troops, not
to the extent that it appeared at San
tiago, but sufficient to require some of
the men to be Invalided home and their
places to be taken by fresh troops of
the United States. At present a large
majority of General Merritfs force is
composed of troops drawn from the Pa.
ciflc Coast or far Western States. It is
presumed that, if he should be rein
forced, the Eastern troops will be given
an opportunity to make the long voy
age to Manila, as this will be in accord
with the policy that the War Depart
ment has now adopted of taking geo
graphical considerations into account
in allotting troops for service.
PROTECTION FOR
THE GERMAN COLONY
BERLIN, Aug. 2.â The semi-official
North German Gazette this evening
publishes a statement on the subject of
German policy at Manila, based on offi
cial reports, explaining that this was
done "with the view of correcting mis
representations in foreign newspapers."
It says that for the purpose of afford
ing the German colony immediate shel
ter in case of need some chartered
steamers would be anchored near the
German warship Irene in the Pasig
River under the protection of the armed
boats. The French and British colo
nies, the statement continues, followed
this example.
Aguinaldo. according to the North
German Gazette, gave Rear Admiral
Dewey a written assurance that the in
surgents would act humanely, and at
Aguinaldo's request, and w!th Admiral
Dewey's approval, the commander of
the Irene took four Spanish ladies and
six children from the province of Ba
taan under his protection and placed
them on board a chartered steamer,
every step being taken with a thor
oughly friendly understanding with
Admiral Dewey and Captain General
Augusti. The North German Gazette
then adds:
"The Imperial Consulate at Manila
has under its protection not only Ger
man residents, but subjects of Italy
Austria. Switzerland. Holland and Por
tugal, to all of whom protection of thf?
warships will be, if necessary, similarly
extended."
SAN MATEO TO BUILD
A FINE BICYCLE PATH
Will Cover a Stretch of Twelve or
Fourteen Miles and Be Six
Feet Wide.
REDWOOD CITY, Aug. 2.â An ordi
nance was passed by the Board of Su
pervisors of San Matea County yester
day providing for the building and
maintaining of a path on the east side
of the county road from what is known
as Uncle Tom's Cabin, above San Ma
teo, to within about a mile north of
Redwood City, covering a stretch of
twelve or fourteen miles. The path is
to be six feet in width and to be used
exclusively for bicycles and pedestrians.
Should the plan prove satisfactory the
board will no doubt extend the path
throughout the entire length of the
county. Work will be commenced on
the same as soon as possible.

GUAYAMA BAY, PORTO RICO,
Aug. 1, by Call-Herald dispatch boat
Mindora to St. Thomas, D. W. L, Aug.
2.â Guayama and Arroyo were seized
to-day. The American flag was hoisted
by Captain Goodrich of the St. Louis.
The Wasp and the Gloucester entered
the bay ahead of the St. Louis to re
connoiter. They left Porto Ponce early
this morning to meet the St. Louis.
When they found no opposition at
Arroyo a small detachment landed.
* Captain Goodrich entered the town
without opposition. Then he went to
Guayama, five miles to the west of
Arroyo and thirty miles east of Por.ee.
Guayama had been abandoned on Fri
day night by the Spanish garrison ol
300, who started to Cayey.
Arroyo and Guayama are intended for
supply stations and from them Cayey,
forty miles away, can be cut off on the
road to San Juan. It is probable the
entire second division will be landed at
Guayama with supplies. Two divisions
can effect a juncture at Cayey and
move to San Juan together on the mili
tary road to the junction point. Tho
plan looks toward placing the ontli?
southern half of the island under the
control of the army.
AMERICAN OUTPOST
ONE MILE FROM COAMO
Special cable to The Pall and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, IS9B. by James Gor
don Bennett.
COAMO, Porto Rico, Aug. 1. by Call-
Herald Dispatch Boat to Kingston, Ja
maica, Aug. 2. â The extreme outpost of
the American army now is^halted at a
point one mile from Coamo. This is a
village of considerable importance sjt
uated on the military road seventeen
miles from Ponce.
Colonel Hulings, Sixteenth Pennsyl
vania, with a small escort, left Juan
Diaz early this morning. They ad
vanced rapidly, but cautiously- Half
way between Juan Diaz and Coamo
they met Lieutenant Finnerty, who
was dispatched yesterday to recohnoi
ter along the military road with a de
tail of eight men.
Lieutenant Finnerty reported that no
sign of the enemy had been seen this
side, of Coamo, but that he did not
dare risk entering the town without a
larger force, although the Spaniards
were reported to have retreated from ;
there.
A delegation of citizens came out to
meet Colonel Hulings. They declared
there were no Spanish soldiers in
Coamo, and they tendered the freedom
of the city to the American soldiers.
Having less than twenty men, Colonel
Hulings thought it prudent to defer
occupation of the town until reinforce
ments had arrived.
The natives report that the Spanish
troops carried away all the money and
valuables not secreted in advance by
the citizens.
As the army advances further into
the interior it becomes more and more
apparent that the reports of Spanish
barbarities made by the Porto Rlcans
to General Wilson were much exag
gerated. The Americans thus far have
been able to find no authenticated in
stances of women being maltreated or
of the wanton destruction of property.
Alarming rumors as to the work of
the enemy continue to pour in from th^
natives, but they lack confirmation.
LOST THEIR PENSIONS
WHEN THEY ENLISTED
Civil War Veterans Who Sacrificed
Small Incomes to Join the Vol
unteer Army.
NEW YORK. Aug. 2.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: There are
now serving in the land and naval
service of the United States, but chiefly
in the volunteer army, a considerable
number of men who at the beginning
of the war were drawing pensions from
the Government on account of the war j
of the rebellion. All these pensions :
have been stopped by Commissioner j
Evans and he has been severely criti- ;
cized for this action. The commissioner
had no choice in the matter, however, J
as it would be illegal for him to con- [
tinue the pensions. An effort was made
before the adjournment of Congress to ;
have a law enacted which would permit I
the payment of pensions to pensioners
while serving in the present war, but it
failed and every veteran of the war
who was drawing a pension and accept- j
ed a commission In the volunteer forces !
forfeited his right to draw his pension \
as long as he continued in the military j
or naval service.
The theory, of the law as it stands is i
that a man who 3s capable bf serving j
in the army or navy is not sufficiently I
disabled to properly entitle him to a I
pension. In most or all of the cases the !
pensioners are serving as commissioned j
officers and in positions for which the i
medical examination was not as rigid |
as for recruits for the ranks.

CITY OF PUEBLA
AND PERU ARRIVE
AT HONOLULU
Volunteers Complain of the Fare
and Quarters on One of the
Vessels.
Hawaiian Planters to Import Thousands of
Coolies to the Islands Before Their
Coming Is Checked.
HO#sl/ULU, U. S. A.. July 26.â The
transports Peru and City of Puebla,
with Major General E. S. Otis' com
tnand <>n board, arrived safely in port
at 6rj() On Saturday morning, the 23d
: insÂ£ : V.They were off the island late on
Friday . night, but preferred to hover
abound until daybreak. It was 3:30
a; .fti. when the five signal whistles
Bounded, and 5 o'clock before the ves
sels were visible to the naked eye,
looming up through the fog-like cloud
banks on the southerly horizon. They
had the- advantage of the mysterious
fcfeituily ijf.our weird sunrise, which is so
different from that of most countries.
There Vis. no lingering roseate dawn
gradu^ly tantalizing one with rare col
oring.,; .jbu;t in the east under the deep
purple pftJl covering the sierra with
glocan suddenly breaks forth a pearlish
lipht which almost promptly takes pos
session, of the heavens in advance of
Apollo himself. The gloomy curtain
vanishes; and it is broad daylight. It
is doh^ in such a buslness-liks way
that o'netalmost feels ashamed of loit
ering under the mosquito bars.
The boys saw that sunrise and a
very few others, for the townsfolk were
very tardy in turning out, and both
ships had to do all the cheering them
selves until later on; but, theji, we
have- captured annexation and the re
ceptions may now be left for "shore
dutyi'V The City of Puebla rushed in
past the flagship, for which misunder
standing she was disciplined, being or
dered out again until the P.eru had
docked:. at the Pacific Mall wharf.
The troops came down in excellent
condition, there being but three or four
cases of sickness, from measles and ty
pho.jd, on the City of Puebla,
At 6:30 the band serenaded the Peru,
arid the citizens bombarded the vessel
with, pineapples and bananas. |On Sat
urday and Sunday shore leave "was
permitted the men in squads of sixteen
â of ..twenty from each company for a
few. hours at a time. The officers land
â¢ ed and enjoyed themselves at the hos
pitable quarters of the Officers' Club of
â¢ the National Guard of Hawaii.
It is unpleasant to publicly record the
fact that the accommodations and com
missary on the Peru have caused great
dissatisfaction among the troops, who
are loud and open in their denunciation
of the food supply. It is stated that
upward of 1000 pounds of meat had to
be/condemned and thrown overboard.
An investigation is being held, and,
while the accommodations cannot be
much improved, the rations will be.
The men last night were permitted to
sleep on shore under the sheds on the
..water front.
It is regrettable to state that our ex
cellent Red Cross Society has some
serious cases to attend to during the
construction of the marine or military
hospital on King street. They are all
typhoid fever cases. The names of the
patients are Privates Albert Hruby and
Isaac Strickland and Lieutenant Hunt.
Private Ferry of Troop L met with a
Serious accident on the Peru yesterday
through falling into the hold, some
thirty feet. He received spinal injuries,
but to-day is in a fair way to recovery.
An unpleasant story is told of two sick
privates being forced to walk to the
street cars and thence carried to the
Red Cross Hospital in the cars, reach
ing their destination in a fainting con
dition, when there were litters at hand
for their more careful conveyance.
A very interesting report as to the
condition of the plantation laborers on
the island of Hawaii will be made pub
lic next week. It will disclose accounts
of gross cruelty on the part of some
of the lunas toward their Chinese la
borers. Strange to say, these cruelties
have been perpetrated unknown to the
managers, who are highly humane, and
: jmich-esteemed men. The days of these
lunas will he numbered if ever white
labor succeeds to Asiatic on the plan-
tations.
The report -will also disclose the fact
that the desertions of Japanese labor
ers have been much greater than was
expected and will probably reach be
tween 400 and 500. It is difficult to trace
them all, but most of them have been
Ideated in the coffee belt, where wits
much less work and with much more
spare time they can readily earn $15 a
month in lieu of a net amount of $9 50
or $10 after the usual deductions. As
they have to feed themselves, and with
rice at a high figure, the gain to them
is an appreciable one.
The concerted action of the Japanese
merchants is expected to have a very
serious . effect upon commercial circles
beTe. It is admitted by their most in
fluential men that they have arranged
to import all their goods from the
United States instead of directly from
Japan, and to cut down their profits to
a uniform rate, underselling all other
merchants, which they can most read
ily do owing to their more economical
methods and less expensive establish
mente.
It is quietly announced also that there
irtll be quite an exodus of the educated
young Chinese, who, masters of the
English, Hawaiian and Portuguese lan
guages, with a smattering of Japanese,
have paved up money enough to give
them an excellent business start in
their own country. They belong prin
cipally to the progressive Young China
jarty and are strongly in favor of the
rebellion encouraged by their fellow
townsman, Sum Yatsen to the sinews
of whose campaign they have contrib
uted liberally. A number of the more
sedate business men and land-owners,
â  fearful of their future, are also con
sidering the wisdom of retiring from
business, as they seriously fear such
events as occurred in California during
the reign of Kearneyism.
From the President to the pound
keeper the only topic is the probable
â¢action of the commission to frame our
laws, but interviews with them result
only in as vague insubstantialities as
shadows fleeting over mirksome meres.
They know nothing and live in dream
ful hope. The Chief Justice, however,
has his mind fixed upon one hobby in
particular â the jury system. He does
not wish to see the Grand Jury system
Introduced, as he believes It will be
found impracticable outside of Hono
fulu. He favors the abolition of the
Hawaiian special jury, and the idea
that all intelligent citizens, no matter
what their nationality, should serve on
the jury. He does not believe, either, in
the unanimous verdict system, but pre
fers the one in existence here and
which experience has proved the best.
The President's hobby is naturally the
land system and homestead laws, in the
knowledge of which he is a past mas
ter. The military and the band live in
hopes that they will be taken into the
fold at their present pay.
There is one little matter that is
touched upon very delicately in con
versation tor fear that their interests
may be prejudicial by a too patent ef
fort, and that is a proper provision for
ex-royalty. It is sincerely to be hoped
that in this question the United States
will, taking all things into considera
tion, act judiciously and liberally. Gen
erosity and courtesy to their Alii will
have a marvelous effect upon the Ha
waiian men. and women, and more es
pecially upon the latter who are prac
tically the controllers of the Hawaiian
sentiment.
The condition of the Chinese, apart
from the labor question, after annexa
tion is causing: considerable discussion
in their ranks and among those who
pose as constitutional lawyers. There
are now probably 600 Chinese who have
been naturalized under the monarchi
cal regime. It Is understood that the
authorities of the republic claim that
their naturalization is void under
their constitution. But the Chinese afe
now making a rush to register at the
office of the Chinese Bureau of the
Foreign Office their Hawaiian born
children in the expectation that in j
some way or another they will be bene- j
fited even if they are not declared to
be American citizens. Over 600 have
been registered during the past week I
or so. In quite a large number of cases I
their children are born to Hawaiian
mothers.
A movement is on foot among anti
annexationists to prepare one more
protest to place before the Annexation
Commissioners. The wisdom of this j
policy is so much doubted as being un- j
necessary and futile (inasmuch as all j
previous protests have been Ignored, j
and yet their presentation has been le- j
eally sufficient to prevent any waiver !
of claims by parties in interest) that I
understand the matter will not be
pressed, but in lieu of a protest a pe
tition will be presented to the commis
sioners in the nature of respectful sug
gestions as to the general form and
character of a government which
would be considered beneficial to the
country at large and advantageous to
the United States, and which would
also be regarded as a peace offering
and pledge of harmony between the
conquered and the victors. It is said
that the points touched upon in the pe
tition will be:
Firstâ The labor question; providing
for the abolition of the penal contract
system, and yet safeguarding the in
terests of the planters, who, for the
present at least, must be regarded, in j
spite of their greed, as the financial life
of the land.
Secondâ The land laws; retaining a
practicable homestead law and pro
tecting as far as it is possible the na
tives in their vested rights, and pre
venting them from becoming the vic
tims of shrewd land sharks.
Thirdâ The form of government. This
is a difficult matter, for on the principle
that "what is best administered is
best," the mass of the people prefer
that all of their executive officers
should come from the United States.
They fear that otherwise they will be
ruled by the same "family compact"
that under one form or another has
controlled them, and, as they regard
it, swindled them from the dawn of
Christianity to the date of the trans
fer of their country. As corroborating
this sentiment, it is only necessary to
mention the fact that the American
Union party Is openly endorsing Har
old M. Sewall, the American Minister,
for Governor, in opposition to Presi
dent Dole, and further that the sug
gestion of General Barker for that po
sition Is received -with acclamation by
all shades of opinion (except the fam
ily compact) with the highest approval.
A territorial government with a home
legislature and a municipal organiza
tion for Honolulu and Hilo appears to
be desirable with a franchise based
upon manhood suffrage limited to Ha
waiian born, Hawaiian naturalized and
American citizens by birth or naturali
zation. This might, of course, debar
from the franchise many, men who have
enjoyed the privilege of voting through
denizenship and special service papers.
To strike off those who have voted as
"special citizens" would deprive the
family compact of a large, number of
alien voters, while on the other hand
a simple oath of allegiance to the
United States an the part of those who
were Hawaiian citizens by birth or
naturalization would add 10,000 voters
to the 'electoral register. It was not so
much the property qualification which
decreased the register as the non-tak
ing of the oath of allegiance to Dole
and Thurston's republic and the non
payment of taxes on a date different to
that of former years.
Should the natives be Intrusted once
again with the ballot they would be
American in sentiment, but they would
not vote with the family compact.
They would unite with the foreigners
who are determined, if a franchise is
given, to down them even in favor of
' 'carpet -baggers." Steps are now be
ing taken to organize Republican and
Democratic clubs, but there is also a
strong sentiment in favor of establish
ing an independent liberal Hawaiian
party for local politics, which shall pay
especial attention to legislative and
municipal affairs.
It Is almost generally conceded that
the planter's must have at the least
from five to ten thousand more Asiatic
laborers for their plantations, especial
ly those in process of formation and
projected, and that no restrictive laws
can be brought into operation for sev
eral years to come. In .the meantime
our mechanics and artisans and .our
merchants suffer greatly from their
competition. The Chinese are now
combining.mQre. strongly into co-opera
tive societies and the laundrymen and
domestic servants are especially and
most inconveniently showing their
power in this direction.

HORACE WRIGHT.
SEWALL ThTpOPULAR
CHOICE FOR GOVERNOR
HONOLULU, July 26.â The widely
expressed approval and satisfaction of
the community at the indorsement of
Minister Sewall by the American Union
party for the governorship of the is
lands is alike complimentary to him
and to the political sagacity of the
party.
Mr. Sewall this morning had no hesi
tation in expressing his gratification at
the political support that had been ten
dered him and the approval of this ten
.der by the press and individuals. He
has not, however, made any formal re
ply to the tender of this support, and
will not do so while he retains his dip
lomatic office.
As to what action President McKin
ley may take or has already taken
with regard to the temporary adminis
tration of the islands he has absolutely
no information. He inclines to the be
lief that the President has already
named, under the provisions of the
Newlands resolution, the person or per
sons to exercise "the civil, judicial and
military powers exercised by the offi
cers of the existing government until
Congress shall provide for the govern
ment of the islands."
These powers will naturally, pending
the report of the commission and the
action thereon by Congress, be con
tinued in the hands of those officers
now exercising them with possibly the
addition of a Federal representative,
acting in conjunction with them. But
of this he knows nothing.
Admiral Miller, he has been officially
informed, will bring full instructions
as to the formalities which will be ob
served in effecting a change of sov
ereignty. General Otis does not look
for the arrival of the Philadelphia, car
rying the admiral, until the 3d or 4th
of August. Mr. Sewall thinks the trans
ports due here now shortly will very
likely bring news of the determination
reached by the President for the pro
visional government of the islands.
EARLY DISPOSITION OF
HAWAIIAN CABLE BILLS
HONOLULU, July 26. â Annexation
having been accomplished, the next im
portant consideration is the cable to the
United States. Speaking on the pros
pects of its early laying. General Hart
well, the local attorney for the Serym
ser Company, said this morning:
"I received nothing from -, the com
pany by the last mail, sufficient time
not having elapsed to allow an answer
to ray letters and telegrams announ
cing the signing: of a contract with the
Hawaiian Government. My previous
information, however, leads me to hope
that the present Congress will make an
early disposition of the cable bills. In
deed, I may say that the 3 cable pro
moters have been assured by Reed and
others that the bills would receive
prompt consideration as soon as the
annexation resolution was out of the
way. And why not? The cable is
doubly important now, both from an
annexation standpoint and in the light
of the American occupation of the Phil
ippines. __^^^^^^^^^__
DE APRA VALUABLE AS
A COALING STATION
In a letter brought by the steamer
Doric yesterday from a naval officer
aboard one of the transports of the
first expedition the following interest
ing information regarding the taking
of Guam is given:
Agana, the seat of government at the
Ladrone Islands, is a town of 3500 in
habitants. The greater part of the
houses are cabins thatched with leaves
from the cocoanut tree, although there
are a few stone houses. The chief
buildings are the Governor's house, the
magazine, a church and a college, the
latter founded in 1673. The streets are
wide and fairly clean and regular. A
large part of the inhabitants are cop
per-colored Indians with light hair.
The town, while located on the sea
shore, has no harbor or anchorage for
large vessels and De Apra, which is con
nected to Agana by a trood road and
only five miles distant, is really the
port of entry. If the Philippines are to
be retained by the United States De Apra
will prove very valuable as a coaling
station. It could be easily fortified, the
harbor is large and deep and is well
protected from storms and is also very
healthy.
While at De Apra It was learned that
a small Spanish gunboat had been
there several months ago, but had
gone to the Caroline islands. As her
speed is only about six knots an hour
and her guns of small caliber, it is not
likely she will prove a very formidable
opponent should one of our vessels
chance to meet her.
When looking at the prisoners one
cannot help notice how much more
comfortable the Spanish soldiers are
clothed for a hot climate than ours.
While the uniform of our men is heavy
and dark in color, and therefore warm,
that of the Spanish is of lightweight
blue and white striped cotton goods,
which is cool and can be washed.
While our men were brown felt hats
the Spanish soldiers wear straw hats
of light texture. It may be necessary
to change the present uniform to con
form to the requirements of the cli
mate. â¢ â 
The Spanish officers captured at
De Apra say they will be court-mar
tialed and severely punished for not re
sisting our forces! and are of the opin
ion that the Governor will be shot if
they aie exchanged or at any tim^ re
turn to Spanish territory. With one
exception they all leave families at
Agana, who are without provisions and
are at the mercy of the natives and
several convicts sent from Luzon.
Previous to the blockade of Manila
pec pie living on the island of Gunin
were visited regularly by a steamer
from the Philippines, which brought
them supplies, but since the blockade
of Manila the steamer has been with
drawn and the people on ihe island
have been dependent upon flsh and
fruit and whatever other foo;I they
can raise in their gardens.
It would seem that according to the
terms agreed upon by all nations rep
resented at the Geneva convention in
regard to surgeons, hospital stewards,
nurses and other non-combatants wear
ing the red cross that Surgeon Aguilar
should have been allowed to remain at
Agana. However, when the facts of
the case are represented to the proper
authorities he will be allowed, no doubt,
to return to his home, provided he can
find a ship which will take him there.

Alice Rix Describes the Reception
to the Bluecoats at
Honolulu.
Statements Made By Soldiers That, if True,
Should Be Heard at Wash
ington.
BY ALICE RIX.
Honolulu, land of eternal summer
and perpetual afternoon. July the 26th;
hottest of days after yesterday and
before to-morrow. Midday; with Phoe
bus riding the heavens, Mars feasting
on the green, Venus with a red cross
pinned to her bosom standing at his
arm.
There may be â nay, there are â
those with energy to take them over
baking streets to watch the fete In
progress in the Palace grounds. But
one Is very well under a spreading
mango tree a block to the hither aide,
looking through the iron grill where
the National Guardsman keeps a broil
ing watch, watching the picture at en
chanting distance; and as for fine de
tails one may always figure' to oneself
the pleasure with which the transport
will devour his pie.
I meant to see the troopship come
in â first because I am accustomed only
to see them go out, and little differ
ences are pleasing to an idle mind;
second, because all Honolulu runs to
her docks to greet the coming and to
speed the parting guest. It is one of
the distractions of the place, and there
are not so many that one cares to Ig
nore any of them.
But the ships slipped In at dawn of
day. The Puebla rudely in advance
of the flagship, was ordered out again
by Major General Otis, and slunk back
deeply shamed to swing her anchor in
the stream. Whistles tooting through
my matin dreams Just before the hate
ful hour of six warned me that the
troops were in and I scrambled to the
docks to find no gang planks down, an
ugly rumor of typhoid on the Puebla
and measles on the Peru, a few na
tives and half-whites In withered
holikus to pass for the Honolulu fair,
the bay squirming with the beautiful
brown bodies of native boys scramb
ling for the poor transports' sparse
spare change. Our men hanging over
the sides of the ships weakly cheering
themselves. All the vaunted enthusi
asm, excitement and warmth of wel
come still tucked away behind its mos
quito bars.
At least I supposed that was where
it might be. Afterward somebody whis
pered to me that it was dead. Nothing
keeps long in Honoluluâ the climate is
against it.
By noon the little crooked streets
were glittering with brass buttons, gay
with artillery red and cavalry yellow,

DUMMY EDITOBS IN JAPAN.
A correspondent asks about dummy
editors in Japan. Such individuals
certainly existed when the old Press
Law was in force. The Government
had competence in the early days of
Japanese Journalism not only to sus
pend and suppress a newspaper without
recourse to a court of law, but also to
imprison the editor, publisher and
printer. Several years have elapsed,
however, since the administration was
deprived of power to Inflict criminal
punishments independently of the Ju
diciary, and with, the dlsapppearance
of that power the dummy editor, print
er and publisher ceased to have any
raison d'etre. Further, according to
the amended press 'law passed by the
Diet In. its. 1896-97 session, and immedi
ately put into operation, the suspension
or suppression of a journal can not
now be effected except by process of
law. With regard to a second state
ment â¢ quoted by our . correspondent
from a foreign magazine; namely, that
when a paper was suppressed it imme-..
dlately appeared under another name,
there certainly was once a case, about
which such- a story might be related
with some approximation to truth. Th>r
proprietors of the Nipponâ if we re
member correctlyâ published slmulta-.
neously another .paper called the Nlo
pon-jin. So long as the Nippon did not
fair under the displeasure of of official
censorÃ the Nippomrjin remained a.
very perfunctory kind of pubjicaiton;.
but whenever the Nippon was suspend
ed its Btaff devoted their labors to tIM
Nippon-jin, sending it also to the NiD
pon's subscribers.. We cannot vouch
for the accuracy of this tale, but it was
currently believed At the time of which
we speak. For the rept. it could never
, have been possible ' for an editor to
stitched and shoulder-strapped and
cuffed on canvas uniforms â a very hot
and ugly combination, by the way â the
midwinter dream of some New York
military tailor who never saw a tropic
sky. In the flare of it, the native taste
in holikus becomes a faded thing and
the gorgeous petals of the native flow
ers pale among their green.
The men got shore leave later, and
wandered warm, weary and complain
ing through the town. They rail against
the treatment on the transports, say
they are half-starved and wholly sick
ened by insufficient and improper food,
pine vainly for shore camp with its
open-air privileges and little chance
for change, and make statements that
If true should go on to Washington,
and if false should never have got so
far as Honolulu.
Yesterday Major General Otis and
his staff, beautiful and perspiring un
der pounds of gold braid, paraded the
town, called officially on President Dole
and were wined and dined all over the
place. Nobody except, I believe, Major
General Otis himself appeared in the
uniform of his rank. The colonels,
majors, captains and lieutenants, first
and second, of the regular army, who
have received commissions in the vol
unteer service, wore the straps and
epauletÃ of the rank they left behind
themâ higher or lower, as the case
might be. Nobody else cared if they
did not, and they were doubtless no
cooler on account of a decoration or
two the less. Sounds of revelry by
night float from the windows of the
Officers' Club, and the band plays on.
The Hawaiian Hotel is gayer for the
coming of the mllitairesâ as what place
is notâ and girls go down like grass be
fore them, in Honolulu as in other
climes.
The men are wearing their white
duck uniforms to-day. They look well
against the brilliant yet tender greens
of this enchanting isle. The women's
frocks of organdie and other thin, deli
clous shimmering stuffs lend to this
town the festal air of an unending gar
den party, are out in full flower to
day. The men are wantonly playing at
ball with the fruit they could not eat
and for which they will long in later
days upon the sea. The natives gather
barefooted and brown ' af the
fence. The band plays the national
Hawaiian air and swings from that
into the "Star Spangled Banner," and
so, unconsciously, perhaps, plays the
last chapter of American history. ,
"give his paper a new name and go on
publishing it" after its suspension
under the old title. A feat of that kind
was out of the question, for the pre
liminaries that had to be arranged be
fore bringing out a paper were both
tedious and expensive. Official permis
sion had to be obtained and a consid
erable sum lodged as security. LonÂ£
before steps to publish a remplacant
j could have been completed the ban of
suspension would certainly, havi> been
removed from the original Journal.
Finally, it Is necessary to correct the
idea that Japanese journals were never
"censured and suppressed for off ait "ling
the Emperor." We are familiar with
the career of Japanese journalispi

EPIDEMIC AT
CAMP ALGER
Due to the Loading of Sick Sol
diers On Illy Supplied
Transports.
War Department Orders an Investigation of the
Medical Corps at Santiago
de Cuba.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2. â General
Sherman truly said "War is hell." Nor
is it always at the battle front. Just
when peace appears to be in sight
troubles, are coming thick and fast and
the War Department is likely to bear
the brunt of them. Typhoid fever is
epidemic at Camp Alger and the medi
cal department at Santiago is to be in
vestigated for loading sick and wound
ed soldiers up. mi illy supplied trans
ports.
Even "to the lookers-on in Vienna"
the shameful condition of affairs at
Camp Alger is not surprising. The or
der that went out to-day fur the imme
diate disbandment of the camp had
been anticipated by those not in the
charmed circle of the War Department,
for from the iirst it was realized that
the camp site was illy chosen. Even
the authorized statement that the 27,000
troops in camp were to be reviewed
here oh Saturday, August 6, by the
President could not put a stop to the
reports of a widespread increase in the
fever epidemic.
Only yesterday the announcement
was made of a postponement of the re
view for one week on the ground that
the troops were to be given preliminary
practice in marching.
Now the veil is torn aside. Camp Al
ger is to be broken up immediately.
Five thousand of the troops are to be
cent to Porto Rico. Secretary Alger de
nies that any of these soldiers are to
be sent to Manila, but another Cabinet
officer said to-night that the situation
in the Philippines was very grave; that
Aguinaldo's course was exceedingly
harassing; that the administration
was sorely disappointed because Mer
ritt ami Dewey had not taken Manila
last Friday, and that reinforcements
would be hastened to Merrltt.
Some days ago General Butler took
the bit into his teeth and moved his
division to Dunn Lorlng, six miles from
Camp Alger, where he thought his
troops would be comfortably fixed. To
day, however, it appears that the camp
at Dunn Loring presents almost as
niany objectionable features as did the
old camp. All the wells but one sunk
6o far have been condemned. The ex
ception is that used by the Eighth
Pennsylvania. It follows, therefore,
that seven regiments of infantry must
all rely on one artesian well for drink- '
ing water. The situation is further
complicated because one of the drilling
machines is now disabled. Finally word
had been received at the corps head- j
quarters that stome of the regiments at j
Dunn Loring are on unhealthy ground. :
It is impossible to dig sinks, for in
stance, for the First Connecticut with

â¢> gone 'abroad j and maneuvered in Eu- -
. ropean especially for Germany's
which are alleged to be unsuitable for !
the work to which they were put. With
this end in view, Surgeon General
Sternberg has sent the following dis
patch to Major Havard, the chief sur- i
geon with Shafter's army:
"The management of the medical de- j
partment at Santiago is severely criti- i
cized. Sick and convalescent sent on i
transports are said to be overcrowded,
not properly supplied with medicines or
medical attendance or with suitable j
light diet. Who is responsible? Report j
in full and take measures to prevent
Bimllar occurrences in future. Acknowl- >
edge receipt."
This investigation of the causes j
which are responsible for the deplor- j
able condition in which the Seneca and j
Concho arrived at New York may lead ;
to a similar inquiry into the alleged ;
friction between the surgeon generals
of the department and the Red Cross
Society.
The arrival of the Concho with its
sick and wounded passengers, ill-fed '
and uncared for in every way, has only
aggravated the already intense feel
ing. It only serves to bring out the I
probable truth of the statement j
recently made by a prominent official :
that the conduct of the medical de- j
partment in Cuba had been a "sicken
ing failure." :
Returned wounded officers and men
from the front unite in their testimony '
to the efficient and heroic service of the
Red Cross physicians and nurses, with
out whose ministrations many of them
would have died. Not only were their
wounds dressed by these faithful work
ers, but they were literally saved from
starvation by the timely help of Miss
Barton's staff.
In connection with this inquiry there
will probably be an investigation into
the postal service at the front. The
entire control of this service has rested
in the military and not with the Post- j
office Department. It is only slno^ the
surrender of Santiago that the depart
ment itself has taken the matter in ]
charg-e. It is alleged that for weeks
after the landing of our troops in Cuba
there existed the greatest confusion
and- delay in the management of the 'â 
mail matter arriving at and mailed ;
from the front. Hundreds of thousands !
of letters and papers were said to have
been piled up at Daiquiri, with no at- ;
tempt having been made to distribute
or dispatch them. When this state of I
affairs was brought to the attention
of the military authorities it was said
to have been received with the utmost I
indifference.
The difficulties and hardships en- j
countered in the management of the ]
Cuban campaign may account for much I
of this confusion, but they can hardly J
excuse the remark said to have been j
made by the general in command:
"To â with the mall; we are here j
to fight* not to write."
During the afternoon Surgeon Gen- j
eral Sternberg received the following
telegram from Dr. A. Monas Lesser, i
the surgeon-in-chief of the American ;
National Red Cross Society, who was |
aboard the Concho on her trip from j
Santiago to New York:
"Every unfavorable criticism of per
sons belonging to the regular medical !
department of the United (States army;
or navy published as being my state- '
ment is not authentic and has not '
come from me. I have only the highest
praise for them."
This dispatch from Dr. Lesser was
entirely voluntary. Another dispatch i
which the general received late in the
day came from Chief Surgeon Havard,
on duty with Shafter's army, and
simply said:
"No ice needed; abundant supply on i
hand."
benefit. The assurances by Baron yon
Holleben of the Berlin Government's
good wishes caused the authorities to
change their plans so far as Germany
was concerned.
But it is still considered good policy
by many officials to reform the Euro
pean squadron as soon as possible after
peace comes and attach to it a force
which will make this country respect
ed abroad. It is felt in naval circles
that the quickest way to bring Spain
to an acceptance of the President's ul
timatum Is to/atart the eastern squad
ron on its mission, and it will be no
surprise if Spain <s not heard from
within the next few days, if the sail
ing of the fleft Is announced.
CHARLESTON'S ARRIVAL
AT THE PHILIPPINES
MANILA BAY, July I.â The Charles
ton and her convoy reached here yes
terday afternoon, after thirty days of
steaming across the Pacific, making an
average of ten knots an hour for the
entire distance. There was not a break
down nor an accident, and on the whole
trip the engines were not stopped save
when it was the purpose of Captain
Glass that they should be. Rather good
work that.
The situation at Manila is not greatly
different from what we had been led to
expect before leaving San Francisco.
There are 7000 Spanish troops shut up
in Manila by the insurgents.
The soldiers on the transports con

Condolences From Potentates and
Statesmen in Every Part of
the World
coffin of the Dead Prince Closed Down in
the Presence of the Imperial
Chancellor.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. 1898. by James Gor
don Bennett. â¢
FRIEDRICHSRUHE, Aug. 2.â Prince
Bismarck's coffin was closed down yes
terday between 7 and 8 o'clock in the
presence of the Imperial Chancellor,
who left Friedrichsruhe immediately
afterward. It was originally intended
that the consecration einsegnung, as
the Germans call the funeral service,
should take place this morning, but it
was deferred until 6 in the evening out
of deference to the Emperor, who ex
pressed a wish to be present and could
not arrive before.
The whole family, headed by Prince
Herbert, assembled in the small bare
death chamber this morning and par
took of the holy sacrament. The black
coffin, of unusually large dimensions,
with eight massive silver-plated han
dles, rested on trestles and occupied
exactly the same spot as that on which
stood the bed on which the Prince died,
the head of the coffin, as was pointed
out to me, being almost within touch
of the bell rope which the Prince used
when summoning his attendants.
The task of opening telegrams and
attending to those which, according to
etiquette, must receive immediate an
swer still continues from morning un
til night and keeps Count Rantzau,
Count Wilhelm and Prince Herbert
continually occupied. I noticed on the
table one layer of opened telegrams
about a foot high from every Prussian
Prince and Princess and almost all the
German federal sovereigns. Emperor
Francis Joseph, the King and Queen
of Italy, the English and Russian
courts and over 100 European states
man also telegraphed condolences.
Prince Herbert assures me that the
mausoleum which is to be built to re
ceive the remains of his august father
will be taken in hand by a large body
of expert workmen. The Prince ex
pressed the confident hope that within
six or eight weeks it would be far
enough advanced to receive the casket
in its permanent resting place, selected
by his father himself.
The state funeral service specially
commanded by Emperor William, an-d
in which the whole of Germany is to
participate, will take place in Berlin in
October in front of the Reichstag.
ARRIVAL OF THE GERMAN
EMPEROR AND EMPRESS
Sons of the Dead Chancellor Affec
tionately Greeted by the .
Kaiser.
FRIEDRTCHSRUHE, Aug. 2.â The
grounds about Prince Bismarck's
castle were thronged with people early
to-day, crowds of Hamburgers being
attracted there by the prospect of see
ing Emperor William pay a tribute of
respect to the dead. They wandered
about the woods, congregating in the
beer gardens, and sent home hundreds
of memorial postcards with portraits of
the decea&ed Prince and pictures of the
castle. Many of the people wore
mourning and hundreds came on bi
cycles.
Under the trees 60 men of the Thirty
first Infantry from Allona and the
sergeants of Prince Bismarck's regi
ment from Magdeburg had arranged
i their messes. The sergeants in their
white uniforms, with yellow ratings
and burnished helmets, furnished a
guard which was on duty on the ter
race facing the garden behind the cas
tlr. The latter remained stfictly
closed. A little side gate was opened
occasionally to admit messengers with
telegrams and wreaths, who were con
stantly arriving.
The Emperor and Empress of Ger
many arrived here at 6 o'clock this
evening, accompanied by Baron yon
Bulow, the Minister for Foreign Af
fairs. The Empress was in mourning.
The members of the late Prince Bis
marck's family received the imperial
party and the Emperor, on alighting,
kissed Prince Herbert Bismarck on
both cheeks and shook hands, with
Count William. The party then en
tered the castle, passing through the
detachments of infantry which were
drawn up along the road and up to the
castle gate.
The crowds on each side of the road
were composed of Hamburgers, who
had been arriving by every train, For
esters from all foreign countries, ven
ders of cards, photographs and medals
swarmed about the outskirts of the
crowds, and waiters from the neigh
boring beer gardens, bearing trays of
empty or filled glasses, circulated on all
sides and did a big business among the
thirsty. There were only a few gen
darmes present, but they were perfect
ly able to maintain order.
When the imperial train arrived here
the crowds were so anxious to see the
Emperor that they swarmed over tha
fences and upon the platform. The
troops, however, were able to keep a
space clear around the Emperor's sa
loon carriage.
At the railroad crossing, where the
Bismarcks' received the Emperor and
Empress, the presentations consumed
ten minutes, the Emperor shaking
hands with Count yon Rantzau, the
late Prince's son-in-law, and other rela
tives of the deceased. There was no
cheering, but an uproar was caused by
the exciting conversation carried on
among the crowds present.
What took place in the death cham
ber is not known, though an official
statement on the subject may be forth
coming. But there is no doubt the re
ligious service was most tmpresarw.
Pastor Westphal of Brunstorf con
ducted it according to the rites of the'
Reff.imed Church. The text, in comp
liance with Prince Bismarck's desire,
was from the First Epistle of Paul the
Apostle to the Corinthians, chapter 15,
verses 53 to 57, as follows:
For this corruptible must put on incor
ruptlon, and this mortal must put on
Immortality: so when this corrupt
ible shall have put on incorruptlon and
this mortal shall have put on immortal
ity then shall be brought to pas? the
saying that is written Death is swallowed
up in victory.
O denth. where is thy sting? O grave,
where is thy victory?
The sting of death is sin, and the
strength of fin is the law.
But thanks be to God, which giveth
us the victory through our Lord Jesus
Christ.
The mourners present, including the
Jmperlal party, numbered from thirty
to forty. Immediately after the ser
vices the Emperor and Empress and
those who accompanied them started
for Berlin.
The former Empress Frederick sent
a large laurel wreath with palms, lilies
and white roses intertwined and tied
with black.
President Kruger of the Transvaal
Republic telegraphed to Emperor Wil
liam and to Prince Herbert Bismarck
his condolences and announced that the
Government flags at Pretoria, the cap
ital, were half-masted In honor of the
deceased statesman.
The Emperor and Empress remained
forty-five minutes at the castle, and
were escorted back to the train by
the entire Bismarck fnmily. Brief fare
wells were exchanged at the . railroad
station. The Emperor, standing In his
saloon carriage, saluted the crowd,
which respectfully uncovered.
Throughout the service in the death
chamber the Emperor remained stand
ing, the Empress being seated. The.ser
vice concluded with a hymn. The Em
peror shook hands with Pastor West
phal and Pinnow, the valet of Bis
niarck.
POTSDAM, Aug. 2.â Emperor Wil
liam, accompanied by the Empress, ar
rived at the palace at 11 o'clock this
evening.
BERLIN, Aug. 2.â The Nenste Nach
richten to-day publishes a dispatch j
from Friedrichsruhe which says:
prince Herbert Bismarck is quite j
broken down by the worry and vigils of
the past few days.
Professor Tien bach says he has not
been allowed to paint a picture of the
late Prince and a cast of his features
was not taken.
As indicating how well the deceased
felt on Thursday it is said that on go
ing to bed at 11:30 he said: "Well, now
I shall have a sleep,"
The funeral service in honor of the I
late Prince will take place on Thursday I
morning in the Emperpr William Me- I
morial Church. The Federal Council, I
members of the Reichstag and of the |
Prussian Diet and the State and muni
cipal authorities will be invited.
A sensation was created during the
afternoon by the Emperor, who tele- I
graphed countermanding the Bismarck |
obsequies which were to take place in
front of the Reichstag building and or
dering Instead that mourning services
be held in the Emperor William Me
morial Church. .
The tradespeople and artists who had
taken orders in connection with the
former were badly disappointed.
The Vorwaerts, in its first article on
the deceased statesman,, denounces him |
and his policy from beginning to end,
thnnerh with an affected show of mod
eration.
THE PRINCE OF MONACO.
The Prince of Monaco has at length
attained one of the- ambitions of his
life, namely, a matrimonial alliance
between his family and one of the sov
ereign houses of Europe. For a mar
riage has just been negotiated between
his only son and heir, Prince Louis,
imw 2S years of age, and Duchess So
phia of Bavaria, second daughter of
Duke Charjes Theodore of Ba
varia, who Is a brother of the Empress
of Austria, as well of the ex -Queen of
Naples, and so celebrated throughout
the civilized world as an oculist.
Only those who are aware of the alto
gether anomalous position which the
reigning family of Monaco has until
now enjoyed among the sovereign
houses of Europe can realize what an
alliance of this kind means to the for
mer. Xot alone have the rulers of the
old world scouted the idea of any mat
rimonial alliance with the Monacos, but
have displayed a very marked reluct
ance to admit them to their courts.
In fact, the Emperor of Russia re
gards the Prince and Princess of Mon
aco with such undisguised contempt
that when some time ago they an
nounced their Intention of visiting Pt.
Petersburg he caused them to be in
formed in the most curt manner that
as he did not propose' to receive them
it was unnecessary that they should
take the trouble to come so far, and
that he had therefore forbidden his am
bassadors to give that visa to their
passports, without which they would
not be permitted to cross the Russian
frontier.
The present wife of the Prince of
Monaco is a daughter of the Hebrew
banker, Michael Heine, of Paris and
New Orleans. His first wife was a
sister of the late Duke of Hamilton, his
mother belonged to the Belgian noble
family of De Merode, while his grand
mother was the daughter of a Parisian
pork butcher, whom his grandfather
had married while earning his liveli
hood as a tenth-rate actor at the Am
blgua Theatre, at Paris, before the
death of a distnnt cousin brought him
to the pinchbeck throne of Monaco.
MUSIC AS A RELISH.
No one appears to know it yet, but
It is a serious and risky experiment,
this eating to music. Nearly every res
taurant In town that is a restaurant
has a string band or a mandolin quar
tet picking off "There'll Be a Hot Time
in the Old Town To-night" or selections
from "Cavalleria Rustlcaria" or other
favorites while the guests cat.
And it isn't pleasant to gome pen-pie.
There are those who are afraid of
lockjaw eating fish to waltz time, and
digging out a lobster to the melodic
strains of "My Girl's a High-born Lady"
isn't just the real thing. In one restau
rant here in Detroit the table d'hote
dinner is served to appropriate music.
With the soup the orchestra plays
"What Did Dewey Do to "Em?" and
when the fish comes the air is changed
to "Swim Out, O'Grady." That isn't all,
though. With the roast they play
"Tenting on the Old Camp Ground,"
and so on through the entire repertory
of dishes.
A visitor in town was particularly
struck with this system when he dined
in the place yesterday, and thought it
all very nice and appropriate. "I'll
come here often," he said, "whenever
I'm In town. It's great. It adds relish
to the meal." But when the cornet solo
ist played "She May Have Seen Better
Days" as a pre-Adamite egg was served
him he changed his mind and left the
table in disgust, even forgetting to pay
the waiter for what had gone before.â

Although bright prospects are ->redlcted

has been cheered but little during the
past week by the amount of business
done by local brokers. The cloud of busi
ness depression seems to have temporar
ily obscured whatever promise real estate
might have Indicated at the commence
ment of the month for better times, and
now seems to hang heavily as an Indica
tion of protracted dullness. Sales are few
and of small value. Whatever business
is done in this line is usually usurped by
the large firms, which control nearly
every Important negotiation.
Although city property is at a stand
still, there is a promise for more than a
bright future for country real estate, es
pecially the counties adjoining San Fran

been unusually good, winch means the

CHICKADEES.
When It is quite cold the chickadees
come. Their arrival always excites the
whole household, for they are dear old
friends. Fresh nuts are cracked, more
baskets put out, and, figuratively
speaking, the fatted calf is killed; not
that we regard the chickadees as re
turned prodigals, but because we are so
delighted to see again these little joys
on wings. Chickadee makes no com
plaint, no matter how many birds come
to share his nuts; he sits in the shrubs
or tre.es, a, bit between his claw's, and
sings his -song over and over, as mer
rily as if,, he invited all birdland to
come and be happy with him.
Last spring one pair of the six who
have been with us so long built nji the
place. I sat for a long time watching
the female come back and forth to pull
out the fine wool beneath the long hair
of the s"kfn rugs in the front hall. She
came in with a business-like little
womanly flutter, while- he frisked about
outside, evidently nervous, but deter
mined to protect her from all harm.
singing 1 all the whfle, or rather whist
ling, his sweet little mating song. His
voice sweetens in the spring, while she
loses hers almost altogether. He is
pompous and important at this time;
she is fussy and affected, reminding
â¢ybu of those women, who are subject
to fainting fits and are perpetually on
the hunt for their smelling salts. He
feeds her at this season with choice bits
and one would almost think her a new
ly fledged birdling, to see her open her
mouth, flutter her pretty wings and
talk" baby talk. A week ago she was as
independent and self reliant as if she
were th^ leader of a female birds"
rights movement.â Lippincott's.
If every man would fight as he talks
the earth would very soon be depopu
lated.

T^E PROMOTION OF -DEFEAT.
''I "HE ylaris of the .prompters of Republican defeat
I this year \have now become sufficiently apparent
* to enable, vis to .comment iipor. them intelligently.
Perhaps no'thiflg 'that :we..cah say will produce a modi
fication pl^ese'plajia.but we can at least lay the
foundation iprvteter on fixing the responsibility for
disaster. Next .to,. apologizing for and explaining a
Republican "defeat, :the:.:riiost pleasurable thing in life
for a party to.be able to accurately place
the blame where it belongs.
The plans; of tfie promoters of disaster this year ap
pear to coiftprisc the ..forcing upon the southern por
tion of the State 61. a: candidate fcr Governor which
it does not. Want. .The politicians and business men
of Southern . California are anxious to secure the elec
tion of a Republican successor to Senator White. A
representative in. the-, upper house of Congress of the
same .politics/, as President McKinley. would, they
think, be a desideratum, devoutly to be wished. Sen
ator Bulla has been named for the position. This
gentleman is not a great man,. nor a man with a very
long political record, but he is a Republican, an ac
tive worker, a legislator of recognized ability and
personally popular. " In the Federal Senate, it is
thought, he could render very efficient service to the
southern portion of the State.
But the defeat promoters object to Bulla, not be
cause he is a bad .liian or unfit for Senator, but be
cause they desire", the position for Mr. de
Youn.g, late general of the Midwinter Fair.
If the candidate, for Governor is taken from
the north Gemeral de Young's ambition will be
nipped in .. the bud. If, on the other hand, that
individual is taken from the south, the bodkin will be
thrust into the boom of Senator Bulla. Hence the
defeat promoters are asking each other the important
questions, Whence shall the Governor come? Shall
he be a southern man or. a -northern man? ' Shall his
name be Gage (south) or Pardee (north)? Shall he
represent the Senatorial aspirations of General de
Young or some other man agreeable to the pro
moters?
It does not seem to have occurred to anybody to
ask what sort of a man in either case the State con
vention is going to be requested to nominate. So
long as he is geographically located to suit the defeat
promoters, it appears, he is all right.
At this stage of the game, however, we beg to re
mind these gentlemen that their candidate for United
States Senator will not have much of a chance if the
Republican party loses the State fight. When the
organization indulges in the luxury of nominating a
weak and unsatisfactory candidate for Governor, the
entire campaign assumes a character which damages
the whole ticket. It is just as easy to lose the Legis
lature by bad management as to lose the governor
ship, and, it must be conceded, with a Democratic-
Populist Legislature in power neither General de
Young nor any other Republican could get to the
Senate. We trust the Republican convention will dis
pose of these defeat promoters at an early stage of its
deliberations. What the Republican masses want this
year is a good State and city ticket from top to bot
tom â in short, strong and active candidates, who can
be elected. With such a ticket in the field the Sen
atorship will take care of itself.
HEROISM OF THE WOMEN.
THERE can be no question but the women of
the country have arisen to the occasion of war
as bravely as the men. They could not go-to
the front themselves, but freely they have sent those
dear to them, and to the comfort of all they have
contributed whateyer they could. Now the girls
at Mills College do not propose to fall behind the
procession. Their patriotism has been aroused.
They want to do something for their country, and
so they contribute their butter. For a week they
will take their bread butterless, and if it prove un
palatable, will even consent to eat cake, the large
sum thus saved being devoted to the soldiers. Let
none speak lightly of the sacrifice.
College girls like butter. They will consume it.
regardless of the fact that it is bad for the complexion,
that the gastric juices have a hard wrestle to get
away with it, that by eschewing it entirely they would
be better off. Just what will be accomplished by I
the deprivation for a whole week has not been figured
out, but such a concession ought to lift a considerable
burden from Uncle Sam. Imagine a school full of â¢
girls going absolutely without butter, eating their
morning toast dry, munching the loaf just as it comes
from the bakeshop. There's patriotism of a high
grade. Such girls are an honor to their country, fit
to be the wives of warriors and the mothers of
patriots.
Without any desire to interfere with military mat
ters, it may be suggested that with Merritt calling for
more men the New York regiment ought to be per
suaded to cut short its picnic season at Honolulu.
Captain Bob Evans of the lowa explains his re
ligious views in general terms by demonstrating that
he hasn't any.
THE DEMOCRATIC PREDICAMENT.
IT is announced that in every respect the work and
action of the coming Democratic convention have
been concluded in advance. The ticket, platform,
committees and organization are all arranged. So
complete is the programme in every detail that the
party organ in this city is able to announce results
now. Never before in the history of parties in this
State did a committee self-constituted so com
pletely gag every voice in a party and substitute its
own intrigues for the popular will, as has been done
by the committee of one hundred arbitrarily ap
pointed to usurp the place of the legal organization in
this city. The power which it usurps, to appoint the
delegation from San Francisco, gives it control of the
convention. The three members of that committee
who are the trustees of its authority are the dictators
of the party in the State. For selfish personal ppurr r
poses of their own they have arranged to stifle Dem
ocratic principles under novelties accepted from the
crank wing of Populism, and every individual Demo
crat finds himself robbed of his birthright to a voice
in the action of his party. He is stripped of every
privilege but one, and that is the casting of his vote
to put in political power the conspirators who have
usurped his rights and violated every principle of self
government and fair play.
At the Presidential election of 1896 there were cast
in San Francisco 30,298 Democratic votes. Granting
that all members of the committee of one hundred are
legal residents here, 30,198 of those voters are disen
franchised in their party, disinherited of their right to
a voice in making its candidates and expressing its
principles, expelled from its councils and denounced
by their own organ as unfit to be trusted in the small
est particular in the management of its affairs.
The Pinto junta has done this, and has held 30,198
voters of the party up to public derision and distrust.
The party organ which is responsible for this usurpa
tion and tyranny does not pretend that it has been
done legally, nor in a spirit of respect for fair play,
but that it is an exhibition of power â the unlicensed
use of the authority of a committee which permits no
discussion of the rightfulness of its action. It need
hardly be said that a party which submits to such
usurpation, bows its neck to the yoke of such humilia- .
tion, pockets humbly the insult to its integrity and in
telligence, is a party unfit to be trusted with the oiii
cial. responsibility of the State and city.
No matter how violently these intriguing conspir
ators may protest in their platform, nor how florid
their professions of regard for the public welfare, nor
how lurid their challenges to influences which they de
nounce as inimical to the good of the commonwealth,
the system they have instituted, if it pass into a pre
cedent by indorsement at the polls, has in it the germ
and easy possibility of every political evil that can be
set a State.
The people need no self-chosen mouth to speak for
them. They have mouths of their own. They know
the good and evil which parties are organized to sup
port and oppose. They see in the characters and
records of these usurpers nothing that should exalt
them for either wisdom or virtue. They have no
record of fidelity to principles or pledges. Among
them are men who have been all things by turns and
nothing long. In times past they have torridly de
nounced the railroad, and. getting office thereby,
have been subservient to its purposes. In whatever
position any of them has had a chance to demonstrate
his self-boasted virtue, it has been found lacking.
They have sought office cravenly at the hands of a
party boss and discerned his imperfections only when
refused. They have flattered and banqueted him
when in power, and were first to spit upon him when
befell.
Under the law of natural selection none of them
could ever reach leadership. In a lair and natural
party organization they would never be called on to
write platforms, for they have no conception of party
principles. They would not be consulted about party
candidates, for their view of eligibility is limited by
their personal interest. Marty of these had their little
political training outside of the party whose control
they have usurped, and many others have deserted it
to follow any side movement that seemed to be
equipped with a barrel and a bung-starter.
Like their pinto candidate for Governor, they have
bolted their party when its best men were the cus
todians of its confidence, and have returned to its
ranks when its scum boiled to. the top.
The predicarrtent is a warning to men of all par
ties. The independent voter who frequently turns
the scale at elections cannot afford to support such a
scheme at the polls, for its method is at war with his
independent position. The home rule Democrat,
who believes in civil equality, cannot indorse a
usurpation which poisons the principles of home rule
and tries to stalk into power over its deathbed.
Republicans have set for them the double duty of in
fluencing their party to the path of success and walk
ing therein to victory, that the methods of usurpation
may be rebuked out of existence by defeat, the only
club that warns the usurper to drop his stolen power
that its owners, the people, may recover it.
WHO PAYS THE TOXES?
WHEN the war tax went into effect and the
Telephone Company found that it could not
avoid payment of its share it announced with
a blare of patriotic fervor that it would contribute to
the common fund. There was no way apparent by
which it could evade doing this, and some people,
paying their own taxes without a murmur, failed to
see wherein the Telephone Company could lay claim
to extraordinary virtue for doing what others did with
never a thought of winning praise.
Lately there have been reputable people to The
Call office with complaints that when tney have used
the telephone lines from points outside the city they
have been charged a sum beyond the ordinary tolls.
When they requested an explanation they failed of
getting it. The subordinates were merely acting on
orders.
'To be plain, this Telephone Company, after an
nouncing that it would obey the law, even at expense
to itself, thus reaching a moral plane above that ordi
narily assumed by a corporation, proceeds to take
the amount of the tax out of its patrons. It does
not strike the observer that such a course is patriotic
enough ,to brag about. As a matter of fact, the Tele
phone Company will be obliged to change its tactics.
That tax. is for it to pay, and as it only holds its
rights by suffrance, it will pay or be subjected to a
curtailment of the privileges it enjoys.
People who patronize the Telephone Company pay
taxes in other ways. They do not grumble at these,
but they do not propose in addition to pay the taxes
of a corporation which boasts that it is paying its
own.
Spain is said to be gloomy over the proposed
terms of peace, and it is no violation of confidence to
remark that the longer she holds out the more the
gloom will be accentuated.
A wise course would seem to be to disarm Aguin
aldo. If he could be given a toy pistol and a tin
trumpet he would be satisfied, and far less dangerous.
THE SAN FEAN CISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, ATJGrTJST 3, 189 S.
NOTWITHSTANDING exposure, 1 the Wells,
Fargo Express Company persists in its effort
to be dishonest. That it should be awkward is
not surprising, for this corporation has until recently
borne an enviable reputation for being square. It had
never been -subjected to temptation, and its repute re
mained unsullied; temptation came in the form of a
chance to cheat the Government out of a wa â¢ tax, and
it fell, the clatter of its downfall being considerable.
Now its protestations of good intent are recognized
as the merest folderol.
This corporation has claimed the right to force its
patrons to pay the tax levied upon it by the Govern
ment. Patrons have submitted, knowing themselves
to be the victims of an imposition, and yet unwilling
to make a contest over a matter that seemed small un
less the aggregate was considered. But the company
was also willing to cheat the Government as well as
customers. It made a proposition to The Call to take
from it a wagon-load of' bundles, and by the hocus-
I pocus of tying a string about the lot, or throwing a
i tarpaulin over them, designating the shipment as one
| bundle. That The Call refused to be accessory to this
j form of crime it is hardly necessary to state. On the
contrary, it demanded that each bundle be regarded
as separate, represented by a bill of lading, and that
! the bill of lading receive a stamp at the expense of the
corporation, as is the word and intent of the law.
This demand has been complied wkh, a circumstance
showing the company to know that it is wrong.
To illustrate the small meanness of the conduct of
the Wells-Fargo people attention may be called to
the fact that when its cars are robbed the machinery
of state is at once set to work to catch the robbers.
This the corporation regards as a right, and it has
never been denied. Nor is there any delay until the
robbers have been landed in the penitentiary. Now,
in an underhanded fashion, Wetls-Fargo is itself en
gaged in robbery, and the president of it asks that
nothing be done about it until the cases of other
robbers have been decided. A i>umber of such cases
have been passed upon, and in every instance the
corporation has been worsted. Instead oi yielding
gracefully Wells-Fargo asks for still more delay, as
appeals have been taken to the United States Su-
preme Court. Everybody knows that a decision can
not be expected for three years, that in the mean
time the war will be over, and the character of the
decision a matter of the utmost indifference, as dur
ing the interval the patrons of the company will have
borne all the expense.
There is no legitimate ground for postponing
action. If the corporation has an influence sufficient
to prevent District Attorney Foote from haling it
into court, there are other methods. At least the
facts can be laid before the Federal Grand Jury and
every offending official indicted. This will be done
unless Mr. Foote shall bestir himself, something he
displays no visible inclination- to do.
In a private capacity citizens can find a measure
of protection in sending by mail all packages weigh
ing less than four pounds. The method is both safe
and economical. In some manner the corporation
must bÂ« brought to realize that it is not greater than
the law nor above the people whose patronage it so
licits and whose pennies it illegally exacts.
(\ PORTO RICAN PATRIOT.
WHILE Garcia in Cuba is skulking and protest
ing against our military manners and methods.,
and Aguinaldo in the Philippines is threatening
resistance and bloody war rather than submit to the
authority of our army, it is gratifyirig to learn that in
Porto Rico at any rate there are dignitaries who ap-
preciatc us at our true worth and hail our advancing
troops as liberators, friends and brothers.
The proclamation issued by Francisco Miaga, the
Alcalde of Yauco, is indeed a notable document both
in language and sentiment. It breathes a patriotism
thoroughly American. Hardly in the United States
themselves could there be found a man who is more
deeply imbued with the spirit of this hemisphere or
expresses it with more force and vigor. Senor Miaga,
though of Spanish blood and holding a Spanish office,
is proud to be an American, and hails with gladness
the war which has separated Porto Rico from all con
nection with a European kingdom and made it po
litically as well as geographically a part of the West
ern World.
In the ardor of his American patriotism his lan
guage mounts up almost to the heights of poetry.
Proclaiming to his fellow citizens the arrival of the
United States troops and the establishment of their
authority over the city, he says: "To-day the citizens
of Porto Rico assist in one of her most beautiful
feasts. The sun of America shines upon your
mountains and valleys this day of July, 1808. It is a
day of glorious remembrance for each son of this
beloved island, because for the first time there waves
over her the flag of the stars planted in the name
of the Government of the United States of America
by the major general of the American army, Senbr
Miles. Porto Ricans, we are by the miraculous in
tervention of the God of the just given back to the
bosom of our mother, America, in whose waters na
ture has placed us as a people of America."
This address, so earnest and so eloquent, cannot
but be gratifying to the people of the United States.
It demonstrates that in some of the most intelligent
minds in the West Indian islands there exists a senti
ment fitting them to share in American responsibili
ties and making them worthy to receive the honor
of citizenship.
In closing his address with a date line fixing Porto
Rico as a part of the United States, the ardent al
calde may have gone too far. It takes something
more than a proclamation from the chief magistrate
of a town like Yauco to annex a rew territory to the
United States. There is much in the way of diplo
macy and treaty making to be done before that can
be accomplished. No one in this country, how
ever, will find fault with the ardor that prompted the
use of the phrase. On the contrary the universal
voice of our people will declare that as for Senor
Francisco Miaga, Alcalde, Yauco, Porto Rico, United
States of America, he's all right.
Miles seems to be advancing rapidly, but he ought
to catch up with the Spaniards engaged in murder
ing the people of Porto Rico and explain to them
that they are committing capital offenses.
For the man Rypcszynski, arrested for forgery,
there must be a shade of sympathy. A man possess
ing such a name would naturally rather write any
other than his own.
We hasten to congratulate the King of Spain on
his recovery from the measles. Had he been located
at Camp Merritt the chances are he would have had
no such luck.
Peru's threat to frighten us will cause no loss of
sleep. Some of our yacht clubs may be forced to
make a counter demonstration, but nofhing more se
rious seems likely to result.
Spain wants peace, but it must get over the notion
that oeace is to be offered as a favor.
WELLS-FARGO FOLDEROL.
AN AMERICAN OR BRITISH POLICY-WHICH?
Imperialism Death to the Constitution.
To the Editor of The San Francisco Call â Sir: after reading: your excel
lent editorials of the last week on the question, which has now become im
mediate, of acquiring Asiatic territory and Asiatic communities, I feel im
pelled to request ah opportunity to add some closing words to my previous
communications on this impoitant subject. When the thirteen colonies re
volted they were dependencies of Great Britain, subject to all the grievances
which were catalogued in the Declaration of Independence, and the underly
ing principle asserted in their proclamation and subsequently entrenched
In the constitution and In the consistent practice of the Government, aided
by the Monroe doctrine, so far as official action is concerned, down even to
the present moment, was the right of sovereignty, inherent in each individ
ual man, and limited only by the moral law and the necessities of aggregated
populations. The three phases of this fundamental truth, incorporated into
our institutions, were liberty, law and order. . ' -
Apart from the incident of the Maine, which was rather an incentive
than a cause, our just complaint against Spain was that, in the island of
Cuba, one of its dependencies, in the most aggravated form, it was contin
ually perpetrating, amidst other craelties which were unique, the very acts
that had justified our separation from Great Britain, and which furnished
irresistible temptations for breaches of our neutrality. The primary object of
the war, as avowed, was to secure to the people of Cuba the power to en
force fheir right of self-government. Leaving motive out of the question, our
attitude was not unlike that of France toward the colonies in our struggle
with Great Britain.
It Is now deliberately proposed that, as a result of a war, thus designed
to harmonize with o;ur political institutions, we should stultify our entire
history by doing the very things against which we are professedly fighting
and exercising the very powers we axiomatically denied in the most powerful
document that history records.
It seems absurd to suppose that any intelligent citizen could seriously
contemplate the conversion of the Philippine Islands into American States,
or that .they Could be held except as dependencies, by right of conque3t, and
through the exercise of force, which would involve the repudiation of the
very groundwork of our political system, as well as a distinct violation of the
Federal constitution. This part of the subject I have already briefly dis
cussed. But it is in place here to inquire, if we should keep the Phi' opines,
what shall we do with the nine millions who have not the faintest conception
of American institutions and American civilization, and who are aliens, not
only in locality, but in their physical, moral and intellectual constitution,
and.^till more pointedly, how will we govern a million of Mohammedans?
We kept Utah, which is on this continent and surrounded by American
S.tates and Territories, under Federal control for forty-six years or more,
because, among other things, polygamy could not be tolerated within the
republic. Shall we abolish polygamy in the Philippines? If we legislate to
that intent, are we prepared for the possibility of a holy war?
The absurdities, as well as the practical revolution, the terrible evils, the
blocktn.gr of human progress, to which the dream of conquest would inevit
ably lead our country, are so numerous that they could not be compressed
into a volume. But, there is one additional feature wrapped up in the
proposition which, so far as I have observed, has not yet been considered,
and to which I desire to advert.
If we abandon the Monroe doctrine and our constitutional system, and
enter Into the conflicts of imperial colonization, we will play second fiddle
to Great Britain, which will virtually obliterate all consequences that flowed
from the success of our Revolutionary War, and that country will, at least In
a moral and intellectual, and to some extent in a physical sense, recapture
Its lost colonies. : â  .
Is this idea visionary or the language in which it is conveyed too strong?
Let us see. Understand plainly that lam not only no enemy, but within
Just limits, an ardent friend of Great Britain. I believe the destinies of the
world, the loftiest achievements of humanity, are to be worked out by the
British and American Governments, and the composite race â not Saxon,
Norman nor Celt, but a mixture of the best strains of blood upon the earth
âby which' those Governments are sustained. But, as I have already en
deavored to prove, the missions of Great Britain and the United States,
though interdependent, are distinct, each from the other, and it is against
the unnatural blending of these missions that, first from an American and
second from a cosmopolitan point of view, I so energetically and uninter
mlttently protest. For centuries, and upon a plan steadily and successfully
improved, imperial colonizatio-n has been the policy of Great Britain, and her
possessions, which are not governed upon American principles, but through
legislation adapted to the special conditions of each, extend to every portion
of the globe. She can handle paganism, Mohammedanism and every as
pect of undeveloped humanity, without violence to her own political sys
tem. Her peculiar function, therefore, is to prepare communities, by grad
ual and elastic treatment, for ultimate freedom and civilization, and, in the
dim future, even Asiatic populations may become fit for American institu
tions. Meanwhile, however, the name of Great Britain is associated with
a rapid approach toward Justice and liberty at home and intelligent coer
cion abroad. . â¢ '
But the province of the United States Is to raise humanity to the stand
ard of a government resting upon immutable sanctions and ideally perfect
and we must perform this work on the American continent and among our
own people â we must bring theory and practice into correspondence on
American soil â or our experiment will fail, and that, too, at the very time
when Its triumph seemed to be assured. 1 repeat what I have said before-â
that facts and policies, within constitutional limits, may multiply and
change to an indefinite degree, but we cannot alter the fundamental law or
abandon the wisdom of Washington and his associates without revolution
izing the Government, and we cannot annex and hold the Philippines, or ac
quire and govern any dependency, ineligible to statehood, without treason
to the constitution and treachery toward the human race..
The exact point I desire to emphasize, without elaboration, is that the
United States should rigidly adhere to its own theories and practice in order
to hold the predominating influence which it should exert in the future his
tory of the world, and that thisi attitude would be defeated If, through any
sentimental considerations, we should allow ourselves to be seduced into
an alliance with Great Britain in which both should pull together in the di
rection of imperial colonization. I propose that the identity of each shall
be preserved, and that the two influences shall not be merged into an Inartis
tic combination in which the face of Britannia would obscure the features
of Columbia.
The missions of the United States and Great Britain are separate. If
the existence of either Government were in peril, the other might well rally
to Its support. An alliance for this purpose not only wou\d be tolerated but
would probably be right. It is a very different thing, however, to permit
our national individuality, so to speak, to be obllt rated, the War of the
Revolution to be recanted, and the United States to become absorbed in a
scheme of imperial colonization by or through British influences. The astute
and thoroughly trained diplomatists and statesmen of Great Britainâ not
her deepest thinkers, who are in touch with genuine Americanismâ have
availed themselves of the honest cordiality now existing between the two
nations to encourage and stimulate the conception of manifest destiny,
which has at least entered into the minds of the American people and
which class or local interests and superficial views of trade and commerce
may suppor*. This means nothing more nor less than the subversion of
our system and the relegation of our country to r subordinate position,
through a dazzlln and baseless dream. If our constitution were laid bod
ily aside, as Sir Boyle Roche once proposed to lay aside the unwritten
British constitution which interfered with suggested legislative measures,
we could not hold and govern dependencies in Asia or in any other part of
the world without an alliance with Great Britain, in which our part
would be secondary and subordinate. Such a policy would inevitably mean
the ascendency of that great empire in the twentieth century and the
forfeiture of our proud attitude as the exponent of the only true and dur
able form of governmentâ that of man by menâ which has been actually
framed and tablished.
It is clair. "d that the tide of public opinion in favor of the retention of
the Philippines has risen in every part of the United States and is flowing
with irresistible force toward Washington. I cannot believe this assertion.
In all our history, settled and definite public opinion In our country has
been right, but simulated public opinion, sounded and illustrated in a
thousand forms, by self-interest, by cupidity or by recklessness, is one
thing and settled public opinion is another. This was sharply illustrated
when, In 1896, the ne'.ton rang with the false cry of "free silver at 16 to 1"
a phrase, by the way, which was an absurdity, as silver at "16 to 1" could
not be. "free." Yet the election proved that the people had not lost their
heads and were true to their constitutional obligations. We all know the
extent and depth of British Influences and how easily resolutions can b
prepared an" adopted, which are used as if they were an expression f
public' sentiment that in reality is not behind them. The merchants t
the United States, the merchants of San Frar *co, are numerous int 111
gent and patriotic, and, were they actually cons-ilted, would often sacrifice
an apparent opportunity for immediate profit for the benefit of their count
and of humanity at large. It does not follow that they are faithfull
resented by the cut-and-drled action of a few men in a Chamber n/'n^
merce or a Board of Trade. I will venture to claim, on account f
knowledge of and respect fc r them, that if our local merchants were t "^

THE ORIGINAL OLD GLORYâ J. W. t
City. The story of the origin of Old
Glory as applied to the. American flag
has been told in a fragmentary way, but
the following told by Rev. John Wright
Buchanan }a the most complete account
that has ever been given to the world:
I opened the other day what proved to be an
unusually interesting piece of mail matteT, for
out fell a small square, cut from a I nitea
States flag, accompanied by a letter stating
that the incloeed was a piece of the original
flag named Old Glory. It was from a friefld.
to whom it had been given by a brother of the
man who owned the flag and who christened it
The ik>s'sesslon of bo valuable a relic led
me to investigate its history, and frbm tne
history of the Driver family I have gleaned
the facts. On the 27th day of February, lfeb-,
the Twenty-fifth Brigade, Union army, en
tered Nashville. Term. The Sixth Ohio Regi
ment, which was the first to land from the
transports, marched directly U> the Capitol,,
hauled, down the Confederate nag which waÂ»
flying there and hoisted their own regimental
colors in its Mead. It was a -glad hour for
many a loyal heart in Nashville, but tor nonÂ«
gladder than for the stanch Unionist, William
l>rlver. an old sea captain, who had come to
Nashville a few years previous to the outbreak
of the war. There was only one drawback to
the Joy of the occasion for such as loved tne
Stars and Stripes. The flag was small and tne
Capitol was high. Oh', for a flag large enrnign
to proclaim the Union to the whole city! There
was one such flag in the city, and but one,
and only one man knew where it was to
be found. Until that day, in the intensity or
feeling which war creates, it would, have been
the destruction of the flag and possibly of its
owner had Its whereabouts been known. That
man was Captain Driver, who lost no time In
informing the commander that if he would fur
nish htm an escort as protection he would pro
duce a much larger flag. It had been K've n
him by friends in old Salem to fly from nls
ship and a worthy name had he attached to it.
Not a Fourth of July or "Washington's birth
da.-- er one of his own birthdays had passea
since Captain Driver came to Nashville mn
that old Rag had floated from his house, until
the Confederate sentiment had become so
strong that Old Glory could no longer be dis
played with safety, and even Its possession
brought danger. Part with it the captain
would not: so he sewed it within the com
forter of his bed. where not even the mem
bers knew of its whereabouts. In vain did
the neighbors Inquire for and even search the
house for it. With eager hands on that day In
February did Captain Driver tear open tna
comforter, and taking the flag from its place
of concealment display It to the soldiers form
ing his escort, who greeted it with .three times
three and three more for the loyal captain. To
the Capitol marched the captain with his es
cort, bearing the sacred flag. He asked per
mission of the colonel of the regiment to raise

A BATTALION OF U. S. VOLUNTEERS
'-p HE official talk In Washington of
rushing reinforcements to Major
I General Merritt does not seem to have
. any effect at tb.is end of the line.
Even; day discloses a little more work
to be done In order to finish the equip- i
nient of the Arizona, Scandia and other j
transports. The/ Germ an system of light- ;
ing the 'Scandia must be changed to the j
American plan, and many other minor j
alterations must be made.
Major General Merritt may need more
troops, but at lkist accounts Major Gen
eral Otis, who was loitering at Honolulu,
was obviously uriaft'are that more men
were needed at the Philippines. The
transports Peru and .City of Puebla, with
regular artillery and.lnfan.tr>- for General
Merritt, sailing from this port on July 15,
arrived at Honolulu July 24. According
to advices received by the Doric, these
troops are to remain at Hawaii until the
10th met.
Major General Merriam, comanding the
Department of California, yesterday re
ceived authority from the President,
through the War Department, to enlist
Hawaiian troops in. the T'nited States
volunteer service. The force to be r,,ised
in Hawaii is limited to one battalion. The j
officers are to be appointed by General j
Merriam , but no doubt the recommenda- j
tion of Colonel Barber of the First New j
York will have considerable weight.

Twelfth the left. Lieutenant Nichols'
account of the light Is as follows:
â¢â¢\Ve advanced on the town from the
north. On our left,, on the top of the hill,
was a stone fort, with bastions on the
four corners and trenches about.- It was
hardly a. fortâ more like a stone block
house. While we were advancing through
a line of brush they opened lin.- on us
from both sides ana our "men began to
drop. We had to run down in a valley
and up to another ridge. For some reason
1 have not been able to fathom, we were
not tired on while we were crossing this
open space. The stone house on our left
could have annihilated us. We climbed up
the ridge, stopping to rest in a dugout road.
The block house on our right on this road
was silenced, but the stone house poured
a heavy fire into our lines. "
"We took a position along- the ridge
overlooking a stream running into the
Aguadores. On the other side was El
â¢Caney. Across the valley we could see
the church of El Caney, which was used
as a fort. Sharpshooters were up in the
steeple. To the right of (he church were
two block houses, and another lay away
over on .the rise of ground to the left of
the town. We lay there from noon to 2
o'clock, and It was there we suffered our
heaviest losses. We kept, peppering away
at the block houses when there was any
thing to shoot at. Soon the artillery lire
on the stone house drove the Spaniards
out, and they ran down the "hill across
the stream Into the town, reinforcing the
troops In the church and In the two block
houses to. the right*. We could see them
running, but the range was too great to
make firing at them effective.
"Then we advanced down into the valley
to the town. The Spaniards began re
treating from the church, and as they
ran our men picked them off. Afterward
I counted nineteen of them in one bunch,
killed by our fire. The enemy retreated
In the direction of Santiago, leaving their
dead and wounded, behind. Our regiment
lost thirty-one killed, including two of
ficers and " ninety-one wounded. Lieu
tenant Wansboro of Company C was shot
through the heart while we were on the
ridge. He stood up and looked out of the
trench. "We buried him. with some fifty
others, near the western block house. The
Spanish loss must have been very heavy.
"Three days later â Sunday morning â
we returned from before Santiago to El
Caney to care for the wounded Spaniards.
In the church were seventy wounded men,
who had been looked after by the people
of El Can*y. Some were terribly wounded.
Many of our bullets from the Krag-
Jprgensen rifles hnd rebounded from the
stone walls of the church and made
frightful wounds. The wounds were all
much worse than ours from the Mauser
headquarters and swore out a warrant
for his arrest.
Captain of Police Seymour Is satis
fied that Wood Is a clever schemer.
Yesterday he was notified that Wood
had visited the local office of the Casu
ality and Fidelity Company.of New
York and magnanimously offered to
release them frf>m any claim which he
mijrht have against the company.
"I'm tired of this newspaper noto
riety," he is said to have remarked,
"and rather than suffer further hu
miliation I have decided to call it off."
Captain Seymour has no hesitancy in
saying- that Wood had intended to Im
pose on the company. When he re
ported that his house had been entered,
and that he and his wife had been chlo
roformed by the burglars the police
ridiculed the story. Through the efforts
of Detectives Fitzgvrnld and Oraham
the gold watch, which he claimed had
been taken by the supposed desperate
housebreakers, was found in a store on
Montgomery street wh^re it had been
pawned by Wood. When confronted
with the evidence of his eruilt Wood
broke down, and announced that he
was willing to quit. Rather than take
a chance on being prosecuted by the
insurance company he gladly accepted
the proposition to sign the paper re
leasing them from all liabilities.

PUT A BULLET IN HIS BRAIN.
A DISORDERED MIND, EXCITED BY A QUARREL.
WITH HIS WIFE, DROVE A, LOZIER TO
SUICIDE,
A quarrel with his wife followed by an unsatisfactory telegram from
her in reply to one from him asking if he. might return home is the al
leged cause for the Buicide of A. Lozler, who killed himself at the' Russ
Housf yesterday afternoon by putting a bullet through his brain.
L,ozler registered at the Russ House on July 29 from Pacific Grove.
Yesterday afternoon, he told the clerk that he wished to be called at 4
o'clock as he desired to take the train for Los Angeles. Before going to
his room he received a telegram, which seemed to disturb him. When he
was called at 4 o'clock no response came to the knock on his door and the
clerk, looking over the transom, saw him lying on the floor. The door
was opened and the discovery made that he had shot himself in the right
temple, the bullet passing through the head and lodging under the skin
of the left temple. A .new hat was lying on the bed and an old one,
wrapped in paper, was on the bureau. This whs spattered with Mood]
showing that the man had stood before the mirror. when he shot himself.
A note addressed to the landlord of the hotel asked that the effects of
the dead man should be sent to M. T, Duslnbury of Oakland.. In the
grate was found a note, which had been torn to pieces. Thls| dated Au
gust 1, was addressed to Mrs. A. Lozier, Pacific Grove, California, and
was as follows: "Nettieâ Do you want that I should come home? I have
been quite sirk. A. L." This note leads the Deputy Coroners to believe
that Mr. Lazier had telegraphed to his wife Instead of writing, and
that she had replied in a manner to Indicate that she did not wish his
return. This opinion was corroborated by M. T. Dusinbury. a brother-in
law of the dead man. who went to the Morgue last evening to see the
body and make arrangements for Its removal.
"My brother-in-law has often left home before,'.' said Mr. JDuslnbury, .
"but heretofore . has always returned and settled his differences with his
wi.fe. I saw htm yesterday about two hours before he killed himself. He
told roe that he had decided to start a store at Hanford. From, his taik
I inferred that he and his wife had disagreed, but I thought nothing of
the .matter,. as. it had occurred before. However, his death was not a sur
prise to me, as we have known for some time that his mind was. affected.
He has Keen engaged in a number of business ventures arid always made
money, but was never satisfied and would sell out and start over again.
1 telephoned his wife- this evening and received word that she would be
.here tp-morrow':. He was not financially embarrassed, as he and his wife â¢
had over $3000 between them. I understand a bank book was found In his
possession, showing that he had $90 In the Union National" Bank of Oak
land, It is my belief that In a moment of melancholia, caused perhaps
by the telegram he received, he took his life."'
Mr. Lozler was engaged in' the grocery business at different places In
Oakland for many years, being at one time interested In a business" ven
ture with Supervisor Pelouze. He was 53 years old, a member of the G. A.
R. and A- O. U. W., and leaves three childrenâ a son of 13, a married
daughter of Â£4 rfsiding in New York, and a single daughter of 20 years
oldâ besides the widow.-
of Monti. The battery was recruited from
all over the State during the last of June,
and has since been In camp at Fort Doug
lass It is 103 men strong, three of the
men being left behind in the hospital.
The battery hns no equipments what
ever, but Captain Jennings expects to
have his men equipped in a short time.
The battery will consist of four 3.2-lnch
brrech-loading rifies. The men of the bat
tery are a hardy and sturdy looking body
of men. The addition of Battery C to the
service, with Batteries A and B, now at
Mnnila, will give Captain Young, com
manding the first-named battery, his ma
jority. _

Captain Baker and the mate and crew
of the American ship Kenilwnrth did not

by the Merchants' Exchange yesterday
says that th<> tire broke out among the

They were burled at sea the next day
and the ship was headed for Valparaiso.
The steamer Mackinaw arrlvea from

the Southern Pacific Company.
The British bark Iredale. " which left
here April 2 for Capetown with 54,544 cen
tals of wheat, arrived at Algpa Bay on
July 8. Her steering g-ear was damaged
and several boats and deck fittings were
smashed. The Iredale must have been
caught In a heavy gale off the African
coast.
A gang of men under Fred Raabe have
been doing excellent work in front of the
new ferry depot during the last few flays.
The old wooden sidewalks are being torn
up and the space underneath nlled in. Ah
soon as this has been accomplished a
concrete sidewalk will be laid down and
then work of preparing the remainder of

The San Mateo electric road was re
placing its rolling stock with larger and
better cars yesterday. They were brought
on truck?! to th*> terminus of the road, at
Market and Steuart streets and there put
on the tracks. The other cars then took
them In tow and took them out to the
cafhouse, where they will be fixed up for
Fftrvloe. The new cars are larger and
bettor in every way and will ad-d much
to the efficiency of the. service.
M. R. Roberts has thirteen rrfovable
coal hoppers along the "water frnnt. and
for some time. the Harbor Commissioners
have been trying to either- get the things
removed or else a rental of $2 each for
them. Roberts refuses to do either on*?'
thing or the other, so yesterday the Com
missioners held ; a meeting and decided to
remove all the hoppers from the front.'
The Johnson-Locke Mercantile Com
pany and the shipwrights' association
have locked horns. The former company
is fitting out the ste-amers Charles Nel

Colby is a son of A. B. Colby, a wealthy
liquor dealer of Portland. He was under
age when he enlisted, and his father re
fusing his consent the boy enlisted under
the name of Jack Franklin. Before he
disappeared Colby had acted as orderly
for Major Diggles of the Thirteenth Min
nesota recruits, hut no orders detaching
him from his regiment and ordering him
to Manila are on file. It Is the belief of
many of the men of his company that he
sailed with Diggles without official per
mission.
MANY WILL BE SENT HOME
Regimental Surgeons Weeding
Out Men Who Are Physi
cally Disabled.
All of yesterday the regimental and de
tachment surgeons at Camp Merrltt spent
in the rigid physical examination of the
men under their charge, and to-day their
reports will be examined by the Medical
Board of Survey.
That the examinations made by the re
cruiting surgeons have been almost crim
inally superficial is proved in that from
fifteen to twenty men will be dropped
from every regiment in camp because of
disqualifying maladies and old Injuries
that they suffered from on the day they
presented themselves for enlistment.
The work of ridding the ranks of weak
material will not require more than a
week.

will leave the Presidio August 5, by the
following route: Burlingame, Mayfleld.

house carpenters are being employed to
do the work. "Of course we would like
to have the job," said President McCon
nell of the Shipwrights' Association yes
terday, "but that Is not what we are
kicking 1 about. Ftrst-ctaM timbers are
being put In the building: up of those ves
sels, but what do house carpenters* know
about the fastening of them? Now if
during the voyage to Honolulu anything
happens to these vessels it is the ship
carpenters of San FraneiÃCO who will get
the blame for poor work and not the
house carpenters. Of course, all we can
do is to protest, and that we have done."
The Lakmc and Charles Nelson will be
ready for troops to-morrow. To an out- I
aider it looks as though the house car- \
ponters have done a good Job ,on both !
of them, and the soldiers will be com- I
fortable. The North Fork will not carry j
paFsenperrt, It is said, but will take down i
freight for the troops.

Colonel Smith of the First Ten
nessee Presented With a
Beautiful Weapon.
If the men of the First Tennessee, from
genial Colonel Smith down to his- lowly
Uttle striker, keep, aa weak a guard over
their bodies as they have over their
hearts, they are going to have sad times
of It when the fun begins over-seas.
They are already conquered, peacefully,
and last evening Colonel Smith surren
dered at their hrst capitulation when, in
a graceful speech of sunny Southern
courtesy, he accepted from the hands of
â Mrs.- A. S. Townsend as handsome ' a
blade of good sharp steel as ever graced
a dress parade.
The unstriped ranks were first to waver
in their allegiance to Southern hospital
ity. . . .
For a month past the kindly Mrs. Town
send has provided for their many wants
that unpaternal Uncle Sam does not look
out for.
A dinner to the officers followed and the
boots and spurs of the line and staff went
over in a body. Colonel Smith held out
till he found his command had left him
and he has now marched gracefully to the
winning lines.
The presentation was a pretty ceremo-
ny.
The full regiment was drawn up In dress
parade on the drill ground near the camp
and before the evening's manoenvers were
begun Colonel Murphy stepped forward
ana with assurances of Northern- delight
at the Southern invasion presented to Col
onel Smith, upon behalf of Mrs. Town
send, the sword which the (.olonel as
sured him would never be unslungr. Mrs.
Townsend, with a party of ladiete, was
present, but allowed Colonel Murphy to
perform the. -formalities of the ceremony.
Going to the Presidio.
Major Cheatham, with a detail of
twenty-four men, was hard at work at
the -Presidio yesterday laying out the
camp ground for the First Tennessee..
Colonel Smith expects to get his regi
ment moved by Thursday. The Kansas
regiment will go to the reservation on
Friday. â

The King of Dudes Has a
Word to Say on
Dress.
J. TValdere Kirk of New York, king of
the dudes, and his wardrobe are with us
again. The young man regrets the sum
mer, for his changes are limited to about
twenty full suits, on account of the con
ventions of swelldom, which has placed
a prohibitive ban on much display during
the warm season of the year.
"Yes," he said last night, at the Palace,
"I have brought very few clothes with
me this year. It is summer, you know,
and there is no necessity for a large ward
robe. The proper thing these times is the
double-breasted coat, with waistcoat also
double. I hare ten of these with me. The
frock is not so popular for evening wear
this year as it was last, and they are
eeldom worn. I only brought four on this
trip. But the thing for evening wear dur
ing the summer Is the Tuxedo. Last year
I had my Tuxedos faced with velvet. You
see. that makes a difference. It doesn't
look so much like your waiter's dress
then. Following out this idea, I had
my Tuxedos made this spring with fancy
black silk facing Instead of the old plain
black without any relief. All ther*e de
tails are of vast importance, you know."
J. Waldere Kirk arrived from Denver
last night in a buff traveling suit. It was
made last year, when he was "on the
other eide," and is the only suit he has
worn more than a einsle season. "Oh,
this is an 111-fitting suit." he continued.
"It was made in England, and they can't
fit you there: but it will do as a traveling
suit. That's all I use it for. Let us talk
of shoes. If you don't wear the military
high-heel shoe 1%, inches high, you are
not in it at all. I have just received
twelve pairs of shoes, iind they all ha^
this heel. You see, it's Quite the proper
thing these days."
The title of "king of the dudes" stf'.;
clings to him, although he lays no claim
to it. "I suppose I shall be obliged to
wear the crown for all time. I haven't
henrd of a successorâ one who has dis
placed me. Now let us talk about the
war"; and then the man of many suits
began telling why tobacco was high and
why you could not hope for a good cigar
until the war was over.

30,000 Democratic voters of "San Francisco
are shut out from taking any part in the
selection of the candidates of the party,
the whole matter being left in the hands
of the committee of one hundred con
trolled by Gavin McNab, W. H. AJford and
Frank H. Gould of the- State Central
Committee, who will virtually name the
164 delegates to be chosen.
The report of the committee recom
mending that no primaries be held was
vigorously opposed by the minority,
headed by Francis J. Heney, who said
that it; seemed there were men on the
committee who were seeking by shutting
out the people to nominate themselves
Into office. :'
"Your right to vote has become cheap
when you delegate to the committee the
power to act for. you. Do you want it
to go out that.-the fight was handled by
a committee of one hundred?
"Because another boss was not able to
Becure coÂ°ntrol of the State committee, do
you want to be controlled by Gavin Mc-
Nab, who, together with Eugene Deuprey,
appointed at lrast thirty of the commit
tee of one hundred?"
Mr. Henry offered a substitute to the
report of the committee of eighteen, mak
ing the argument that vie Democrats of
the city should have a voice in the se
lection of delegates to the State conven
tion, and that the only way to do so was
by the holding of primaries. The sub
stitute Was, after a hard fight on the part
of Max Puppt*?, James H. Barry and other
programmers, defeated.
The committee of one hundred will meet
In Native Sons' Hall next Friday night
to take the step called for In the pro
gramme by naming the 154 delegates to
the Btate convention.

Enroll for the State
Convention.
The Harney-Ralney contingent of the
campaign committee of the Democratic
party met last evening in the Baldwin
Hotel, Major J. P. Harney presiding and
John McGovem officiating as secretary.
The different district campaign commit
teemen reported that they had made ar
rangements for enrollment places for this
and to-morrow evenings in their respect
ive districts. The annexed resolution
upon the removal of the old horsecar
tracks on Market street was unanimously
passed:
Whpreas, Thp obstruction to transportation
on Market street, between Second and Sixth,
so long maintained by the Market Street Rail
way Company, to the detriment of merchants
and the traveling public generally, has, after
repeated efforts, been removed; therefore, ble it
Renolved, That the prompt and decisive ac
tion of Mayor Phelan In ordering the removal
of said obstruction deserves commendation and
that the energetic manner in which the work
was accomplished by Street Superintendent
Ambrose demonstrates his efficiency as an of
ficer and Is an added Instance of his alacrity
In the discharge of his official duties.
It was also decided that the enrollments
will be additional to the original enroll
ments that took place last April, and all
Democrats who will pledge themselves to
vote the Democratic ticket at the next
election are eligible to go on the list. On
Friday evening the district clubs will
meet at their respective places and nomi
nate delegates to the Democratic State
convention. On Monday evening the dis
trict clubs will again meet for the pur
pose of electing the delegates. The presi
dent stated that the Democracy of San
Francisco is entitled to 154 delegates.
After a little talk the campaign commit
tee apportioned the representation to
each district on the vote received in 1890
by J W. Martin. Democratic candidate
for Presidential Elector. Martin received
the highest number of votes reached in
San Francisco, which was 30,649. The apÂ»
portionment will be one delegate to each

Swearing in Registration Officers.
Reglstrar Biggy is busily engaged in the
work of examining and swearing in the
present registration officers selected by
the Board of Election Commissioners. He
expects that he will not be able to make a
complete report before next Friday. Reg
istrar Biggy has up to the present time
refused to accept thirty of the oltlcors who
came before him, as they did not live In
the precincts In which they were chosen
to serve. The reprecincting of the city
has caused considerable confusion and the
majority of the mistakes found by the
Registrar have been due to that cause.
Must Pay the Tax.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue
yesterday decided that restaurant keep
ers must pay the stamp tax on the bot
tles of wine they serve with the meals
they eel!. The wine is purchased by the
restaurant keepers in hulk and served to
the customers in the bottles. It was held
by them that in that case the tax would
not apply to them. The Commissioner
decided otherwise.

Tod Sloan was badly outridden re
cently at Saratoga by Willie Martin,
and yesterday Sam Doggett and Danny
Maher made him play second violin
over the Brighton Beach course. Maher
won on "Wine Press and Maximo Go
mez and the Captain was second on
Anitra and Banquo. Then Sam Dog
gett won on Miss Tenny and Tod was
a good second on Bonadea, while in the
last race Simms won on Ben Ronald
and "Toddy" was a fair third on Gun
Metal. All of these defeats must be
trying on the nerves of the midget and
his host of followers.
At Montreal, on July 29, two of the
six winners were bred at Rancho del
Paso. They were Mirth, by Imp. Mid
lothian, and Sleepy Belle, by Salvator.
In a communication to the New York
Spirit of the Times "'North Yorkshire
man" predicts good prices for the Hag
gin yearlings to be sent to England
and sold during the coming fall, and
declares the English sportsmen are
very much impressed with the useful
ness of the American-bred galloper.
Fast Black, the filly that recently de
feated Whiplash, is by imp. Watercress
from Abilone, and was bred at Rancho
del Paso. The same day that Fast
Black won (July 28) Marblehead (by
imp. Watercress-Madrid) was success
ful at Saratoga. He is a brown colt and
belongs to Philip J. Dwyer.
Kinley Mack, the bay two-year-old,
brother to Mary Black, is as yet unde
feated. He is raced by his breeders,
the Messrs. Eastin & Larabie of Deer
Lodge, Mont., who also race Mary
Black and own her dam, Songstress, by
Luke 'Blackburn.
Twinkler, raised (and owned until re
| cently) by the Messrs. Boots, won
' again at Saratoga on Monday for Sam
â  Hlldreth, his new owner, doing his mile
in 1:41% with the California lad, Dick
Clawson, in the saddle. He was also
victorious on the first day at Saratoga,
; as was Marblehead and Kinley Mack,
products of the Sacramento "Valley of
the Golden State. Marblehead wpn the
j Congress Hall stakes, defeating Satir
ist, Hungarian, Dr. Eichberg, Counsel
lor, Wernberg and others.
The fields were very large at the
Montreal meeting, where H. D. Brown
acted as starter and John J. Carter as
presiding Judge. There were seven
races on July 28, and every start was
pronounced good. Brown did his first
work as starter at the Bay District
track in 1893, and it was predicted then
that he would make his mark in the
cursing box.
Ninety Cents, a good winner at
Brighton Beach is an aptly named Cal
ifornia-bred gelding, being by imp. Sir
Modred from Trade Dollar.
The mighty Morello's brother, Moroc
co, bought as a yearling by P. Loril
lard, latterly the property of R. W.
Neilson, died a few days ago of inflam
mation of the bowels at Cheney, Pa.
His loss is a very heavy one. for much
was expected of Morocco at the stud.
Hamburg and Ornament may be
brought together over the Saratoga
track August 10. Marcus Daly, owner
of the former, is said to be willing to
make a match with Ornament's owner
and the latter can name his distance.
H. H. Hunn, who trained for W. S.
Hobart, the young San Mateo million
aire, for a couple of seasons, leaves
New York shortly for Venezuela with a
lot of gallopers. He expects to sell.
The success of the horses that raced
In California, especially of his black
horse, Judge Denny, has led the famous
Chicago detective, William A. Pinker
ton, to purchase a number of good
horses of Sam C. Hildreth, including
Hurly Burly, Fonsovannah and Toluca.
Hurly Burly divided sprinting cham
pionship honors with Mary Black at
the recent Washington Par) meeting.
Fonsovannah is a more than useful
selling plater, while Toluca is account
ed the champion two-year-old filly of
the Middle West this season.
Last Evening's Fires.
An alarm wos turned In from box 42 at
6:15 last evening for a fire in an unoccu
gied store and three-story dwelling in
hearer Place. The damage is estimated
at $1500. The cause of the blaze is not
kno'vn. Box 76 at 7 o'clock was for a fire
cau -ed by a defective flue in the dwelling
of G. W. Vogt at 1531 Market street. The
damage amounted to $5.
ENLISTMENT OF HAWAIIANS.
One Battalion to Be Formed and Mustered Into the
United States Volunteer Service.
UNDER the annexation proceedings, soon to take place, the national
troops of Hawaii will- as a consequence go out of service with the
extinction of the island republic. There are about 500 of these
troops, and many of them no doubt will desire to enlist In the ser
vice of the United States. This opportunity will be given them at once,
as the President, at the suggestion of Major General Merriam, in whose
department the islands have been placed, has authorized the enLiptment
of "one battalion. The formation of this battalion will be entrusted to
Colonel Barber of the First New York Volunteers, commandant of the
new post at Honolulu. Colonel Barber will then have under his com
mand three organizationsâ his own regiment, the third battalion of the
Second Regiment of United States Volunteer Engineers, and the Hawaii
ans. This will entitle him to a brigadiership, to which he may soon be
promoted. . .
The news that the Hawailans are to become a part of the Inited
States army will no doubt be received with a great deal of enthusiasm
at Honolulu. General Merriam will send full instruction tn Colonel Bar
ber on the next steamer! The telegram from the War Department to
General Merriam Is as follows:
WASHINGTON, D. C, August 2, 1898.
Major General Merriam, Commanding Department of California,
San Francisco: The President directs that if any of the military
forces of the Hawaiian Islands desire to become part of your volun
teer army, you are authorized to organize not to exceed one battal
ion of infantry, nominating- the officers anu causing the officers
and men to be mustered into the service and have them report to
Colonel Barber for duty.
H. C. CORBIN, Adjutant General United States Army.
THREE BARGE CREWS
MAY ROW AT ASTORIA
OARSMEN PREPARING FOR THE
REGATTA.
Ariels, Pioneers and South Ends Will
Enter Representatives in the
Outrigged Skiff Race.
At a meeting of the regatta committee
of the Pacific Athletic Association, held
last night, the following were present: A. j
H Rothkopf, of the Dolphins, in the ,
chair; S. J. Pembroke of the Alarm das,
J. R. Bockman of the Ariels, W. C. Espy
OÂ« the Pioneers, #and J. D. Mahoney of
the Sov*h Ends. It was decided that the ;
timers at regattas, should inform the sec
retary of the official times of all events,
for entry in the record book of the as
sociation. W. C. Espy, S. J- Pembroke
and J. R. Bockman were appointed a !
committee to procure medals lor tne ;
prize-winners at the El Campo regatta.
S J. Pembroke has been informed by
telegram from the secretary of the As- :
toria regatta to be held August 19, 20 and ;
22 that the races at Astoria have hither
to been for shells, but that if two or
more crews come from this city, a barge
or gig race will be arranged, and a valu
able trophy given: transportation will be
allowed for crew and trainer and coach.
In reply to this telegram S J. Pembroke :
said that the South End "Midget crew I
and the Alameda senior barge crew would ,
go to Astoria and row for the trophy.
Much discussion ensued as to the stand
ing' of R. McArthur of the Midget
crew, some members of the committee
thinking that the Alamedas could not row
against him without forfeiting their i
standing in the Amateur Athletic Union; j
as the trophy goes to the club and there j
are no prizes for the individual oarsmen
and no gate money, the standing of Mc-
Arthur does not matter. It was s*f- ted ;
that the president of the Paclflo Athletic j
Association has never declared McArthur
a professional. In the end S. J. I em
broke was given full power to go ahead ]
and make arrangements for crews and
single scullers to visit Astoria Coney
Ochs will probably represent the Pioneers,
J. Foley the South Ends and * rank VMI- |
son the Ariels, in outrigged skiffs; and
there is talk of H. Wittkoff representing
the Artels in the shell race. The regatta
committee is strongly in favor of send. ng
as good representatives as possible, b.
J Pembroke has telegraphed to the sec
retary of the Astoria regatta that two,
and possibly three, barge crews will en
ter, and four single scullers. He expects
to receive an answer from Astoria to
day.
Arrested for Assault.
Frank Knox, a volunteer soldier, was
arrested by Officers Holns and Edwards
early yesterday morning and charged
with assault on complaint of Ernestine
Gilgenkrantz. a 15-year-old girl. It is
claimed by the girl that she was awak
ened In her room at the Philadelphia
House, which is owned by her mother,
by Knox who was sitting on her bed.
She started to cry out but was pre
vented by the soldier who asked her If
she didn't know him. She says she never
saw the man before, and being frightened
alarmed the house. Her mother came to
the room and the soldier ran into the
street, where he was captured b> the
officers. The girl, who is quite frail and
looks younger than she is, says she will
prosecute the soldier.
A Seaman Killed.
Andrew Christiansen, a sailor on board
the ship Spartan, fell off the gangplank
last Monday and received internal inju
ries which caused his death in the Ma
rine Hospital yesterday. The deceased

Justices of the Supreme , Court wiU bo

arguments of one of the several branches
of the case of the estate of James G.
Fair, deceased. The matter for consid
eration iÂ« the appeal to test the trust
clause in the will of the lato millionaire,
wherein Charles L.. Fair brought action
against the trustees. The case was called
yesterday. but the attorneys asked for
one whofe day for argument.

MIDDLE OF THE ROAD MEN ARE OUTSPOKEN,
They Declare Formally That They Will Not Tolerate
Fusion,
Whereas, A State convention
of the People's party was called
to met in Sacramento on July
12, 1898; and
Whereas, An assemblage of
delegates purporting to repre
sent the People's party met on
said date and proceeded to en
ter into fusion agreements with
other political parties, in many
instances in violation of their
instructions, and did nominate
James G. Maguire, an acknowl
edged member of the Demo
cratic party, as a candidate tor
Governor, and did furtheragree
to give other political parties
the greater part of the places
upon the State ticket and in the
Congressional, Railroad Com
mission and Board of Equaliza
tion Districts; and
Whereas, Certain delegates,
almost equal in number to said
fusionists, after such action,
did withdraw from said assem
blage and organize as a Peo
ple's party convention and did
nominate a straight ticket of
known members of the People's
party; and
Whereas, Said convention did
create a People's party State
LOCAL POPULISTS HAVE A
LIVELY WRANGLE.
Cator and His Followers Proceed to
Organize a New Com
mittee.
The war started at Sacramento when
the Buckley-Maguire-Gallagher wing
of the Populists nominated Congress
man Maguire to head the pinto ticket,
is still on and there is every indication
that it will increase in bitterness until
election day. The Populist State nom
inating convention went to pieces at
the capital city and last night the lo
cal organization was disrupted. The
majority of the members of the county
committee of the Populists walked out
in a body, being unable to stand fusion
and Maguire, and reorganized with a
committee that is composed of Popu
lists instead of Buckley-Maguire Dem
ocrats.
The meeting of the county commit
tee of the Populist party was called for
the purpose of indorsing the action of
the delegates who were sent to the
State convention. The indorsement
came in the shape of a "walk out" by
the majority of the committee.
George D. Gillespie, the chief spicier
of the Popo-Democrats, realized that
there was terrible slaughter in store,
and tried to escape by firing the first
bomb. After the meeting had been
called to order by Chairman Louis
Chester, Gillespie asked for the read
ing of the minutes of the previous
meeting.
Carleton H. Johnson, secretary of the
committee, proceeded to read from sev
eral loose pages of paper.
"I object to the minutes in this form,
shouted Gillespie. "'I insist on having
them read from the minute books of the
committee."
"That is impossible," replied Johnson,
"for they have not been transcribed. !
was at the Sacramento convention, and
since my return I have not had time to
engross them in the minute books.
"Then produce the minute books," de
manded Gillespie, "and have the min
utes now entered."
"The books are not here,' replied
Johnson. â,, , _
"Are they not in the safe? asked
Gillespie.
"No. sir." replied Johnson. I found
out during the last campaign that the
safe was not a safe place to keep any
thing You and A. B. Kinne broke open
the safe, and I then thought it time to
place the books of the committee in
some other place. For that reason I
removed them to a place where tney
would be secure.
"The burglarious work is still notice
able on the safe."
"As financial secretary' and treasurer
of the committee," exclaimed Gillespie,
"I broke open the safe."
"Well, we don't want any more un
derhand work," shouted a committee
man in the rear of the hall.
"But I Insist on having the books
produced and the minutes read from
them," persisted Gillespie.
"How can you get your wish," asked
Committeeman Porter, "when the
books are not here and the minutes
have not been engrossed in them .
"Then I move that the reading of the
minutes be dispensed with." said Gil
lespie, "until such time as the books
are produced and the minutes of the
last meeting are entered in them." .
The motion prevailed, and (Tiliespte
again claimed the floor. "I wish to in
troduce the following resolution:
said he:
Whereas, on July 5, 189$. a Pop
ulist Convention was held in this cit>
for the DurpÂ°sp of electing twent>-nine
delegates to the State Convention of the
Populist party to be held in Sacramento
City July 12 W*. and whereas, said con
vention of July 5 instructed said twenty
nine delegates to favor a union of all who
will unite with the Populist party by
adopting and accepting its platform; and
whereas said convention' at Sacramento
I passed a resolution instructing all candi
| dates to accept said Populist party plat
| form, or their places would be declared
vacant: therefore, be it
Resolved. That we heartily approve of
the action of the twenty-six delegates who
carried out said instructions.
There was a whoop from the Ma
guire-Buckley henchmen, but it was
drowned by a chorus of noes from the
straight-out Populists and middle-of
the-road men.
Joseph A. Johnson, who was nomi
nated for Secretary of State by the
Populists who refused to swallow Ma'
quire and fusion at Sacramento, finally
made himself heard above the clamor.
"I hope that no middle-of-the-road
Populist." said he, "will vote either for
or against me resolution."
"That's right," exclaimed T. H. Por
Central Committee to support
its nominees, and did con
fer authority upon such com
mittee to reorganize the party
in any county where it might
be deemed necessary for
the welfare of the People's
party ticket; therefore
Resolved, That we repudiate
the action of said fusion assem
blage and its nominees; and
further
Besolved, That in recognition
of the fact that the past exist
ing county committee in San
Francisco was largely composed
of fusionists and traitors to the
People's party, thereby lessen
ing its efficiency and its loyalty
to the party; we therefore,
As members of the People's
party County Central Commit
tee, and under authority of
the State Central Committee,
do now proceed to organize
as the People's party County
Committee of San Francisco,
composed only of members who
will agree to support the nomi
nees of said People's party con
vention, of which the Hon. T.
W. H. Shanahan is the head as
the nominee for Governor.
ter "We nominated a straight out
and-out Populist ticket at Sacramento
with T W. H. Shanahan at the head.
"Congressman Maguire will accept
the nomination given him." replied Gil
lespie, "when he gets here."
"But when will he get here?" asked
Secretary Johnson. "After the Demo
cratic Convention adjourns. Shanahan
Is a Populist and Maguire is not."
The resolutions presented by Gillespia
were adopted, the middle-of-the-road
men declining to vote.
"I have a communication to read,"
said the secretary when the Buckley-
Maguire men had quieted down and
stopped cheering over the adoption of
; the resolution. The communication was
i as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 2, IS9B.
To Carleton H. Johnson, Secretary: We,
the undersigned, hereby withdraw from
and sever our connection with this body,
because we intend to organize to support
the straight Populist party nominees and
because we recognize that this body is
under the control of the Democratic
party.

Johnson was frequently interrupted
during the reading of the names of
those who would not submit to the
lash of the Buckley- Maguire Demo
crats.
"I would like to know what this all
means?" ventured one of the Magruire
men.
"Shut up you old blunderbuss,"
yelled one of the middle-of-the-road
men.
The blunderbuss was squelched.
"I challenge this list of names."
shouted Gillespie, "for there are names
on it of people who are not In the city."
"I'll have to call you down," said
Johnson. "I'm not a forger nor am
I a safe cracker."
â  "John F. Patterson Is not here," said
j Gillespie angrily, "nor has he been in
the city for several weeks." â  '. â â 
"Well, I'm here Just about this time,"
chirruped Patterson, "and I signed
that Hat." . . ;
The anti-Maguire men cheered, and
Gillespie looking very sheepish sat
down.
"Move that the communication be
laid on the table," yelled one of the
Maguire Populists. ;
"You can do as you please about
that, said Johnson, "but the men who
have signed it are firm in their determi
nation of standing- by the People's
party."
"Oh, let 'em go," exclaimed Gillespie.
\Ve will go," said Johnson in reply.
TVe joined the People's party not the
Buckley-Maguires."

and so we part till We' can -meet; again
as in the days when fusion was riot
tolerated in our party,". â¢â 
"And I aJsp.wish to be -.understood j n
this matter," added Chairman Chester
â¢As chairman of this . body?, and as Â»
I member, 1 withdraw and sever my con
> nection with it. â  I" entered the People's
party because I found that neither the
Republican nor Democratic party would
or could give the relief we demand.*.
"I did not suppose that the party
would go outside the party and nomi
nate a political opponent and an avowed
member of another party. It is- "breach
of trust and does not heJp the party.
The twenty-six delegates mentioned in
the preceding resolution accomplished
the breach of trust by voting against
explicit and unanimous instructions to
nominate only straight Populists. I
cannot longer recognize thfs as a Popu
list body nor associate with men who
have violated their instructions."
Chairman Chester, Secretary John
son and the other committeemen; who
signed the notice, of withdrawal then
left the meeting room in a body.
Gillespie called the few remaining
committeemen to order and suggested
that a temporary chairman be selected.
1 On motion of A. 13. Kinne, Dr. John
A. Miller was chosen to fill the vacancy
caused by the retirement of Chairman
Chester. He said that he regretted a
division in the Populist forces, and add
ed that he believed that those who left
were sincere and honest in their mo-
tives.
An adjournment was then taken af
ter the election of George A~ Clough as
secretary and J. M. Custer, George D.
Gillespie, A. B. Kinne,. George Silvey
and Henry Huppert as a committee to
draft plans for the reorganization of
the committee. .
The Populists who sq withdrew rath
er than stand fusion and. the. Buckley -
Magruires, immediately went to a hall
at 997 Market street and reorganized.
The meeting was cal.led to. order by
Carleton H. â Jdhnson, who said that the
action taken was necessary to save .'the
name of the party. ;-â 'â â ' . .
"We went to Sacramento," said he,
"to nominate a Populist ticket and dis
covered that we were in a Democratic
convention. We withdrew and nomi
nated a straight out-and-out Populist
ticket. We are gtfing. to stand toy that
ticket, and. fight the Biickley-Maguires."
Nominations" for temporary, chairman
were next' declared in' order, and Louis
Chester was elected by acclarrimation.
"We will shoW the Buckley-Ma
gvrires," said he, "that we are in the
fight, and in to stay."
A call of the roll sh-owed that forty
two .members of the old County Com
mittee -were present.' ." ,' â 
. Carleton H. Johnson was elected sec
retary and T. H. Potter treasurer.
Resolutions indorsing Shanahan for
Governor were then introduced and
unanimously adopted. The resolutionswill be found in another column of The
Call.
â \\V are notv on the right track," said
ConYmltteeman' Gore, "far fusion, when
used in connectfo-n with the Populist
party, is synonymous with treachery."
The utterance of Gore was received
with hand clapping and cheering.
An adjournment was then taken un
: til Tuesday evening, and in the mean
time Oarletdn H. Johnson, Samuel
..Smith. T. H. Porter, John C. Gore and
H. J. Colvjn .will draft a constitution
.and set of by-laws to govern the com

WALLING UP A CLUB.
It Is some time since a "spite house"
has been built on a alx-foot lot, but If
plans just filed with the Building De
partment are carried out a piece of con
struction will soon be begun which, al
though not actuated by spite will be
unique among the buildin" operations
of the city. The new house of the New
York Ahtletic Club at Fifty-ninth
street and Sixth avenue is to be brl<-kp<l
in on one side. Adjoining the club
house on the east is the ten-story
apartment house Dalhousle. The two
buildings touch each other for a dis
tance of about thirty feet back from
the building line. From that point to
the rear the wall of the apartment
house is about ten feet further east,
leaving a large open apace for light and
air.
The wall of the clubhouse, on the con
trary, runs straight back to the build
ing, covering the entire lot, the archi
tects evidently thinking that the Dal-
housle's court would furnish all the
light and air that the clubhouse needed.
Plenty of windows were put in on every
floor, and In reply to protests from the
owners of the Dalhousie the club peo
ple gave the assurances that the win
dows would be of ground glass and
would always be kept closed.
Thpre was little complaint durtng the
winter months, but just as soon as the
weather was warm enough up went the
windows and the trouble began. Oppo
site the sixth and seventh floors. of the
Dalhousie are the kitchen, wlneroom
and butler's pantry, and . long after
most of the tenants of the apartment,
house wanted to be asleep talk of ser
vants and clatter of dishes made the j
rooms aoross the court places for any
thing but repose. â 
The complaints were not slow â¢in
forthcoming, and' a considerable num
ber of the tenants on the side of the i

house next to the club announced their
Intention of getting out. The agent of
the apartment, Duncan Buchanan, who
represents the owner, Mrs. Barbara F.
Schurman of Ithaca, remonstrated
with the club officials, but seemingly
without effect, for last night a view,
from the Dalhousie showed every win
j dow in the clubhouse wide open.
Something had to be done, and after
1 a consultation In which William H.
, Burr, professor of civil engineering In
Columbia University, was one of the
participants, plans were prepared and
have since been filed at the Building
1 Department for . what Is modestly
termed a "brick fenc< 62 feet 6 Inches
long." â  The "fence" turns out to be
nothing else but a tw-elve-inch brick
Wall, which, unless some ar. icable ar-
r angement can. be effected, will be built
snug up against the easerly wall of the
New York Athletic Club house, and will
run from the ground to the roof shut
ting up every window as far back as
the rear of the apartment house lot. â

COSTLY DBOP CUBTAIN.
One of the pood stories about the fa
mous painter, Melssonier, which is not re
peated by his recent biographers, is in re
gard to his experience with a "new rich"
gentleman who had. erected a private
theater at his c-hateau. Meissonier was
Just then at the height of his fame, and
was- spending months in painting little
pictures a-bout 12 by 18 inches and selling
them f>r & thousand francs an inch. Thc
rioh man conceived the brilliant idea that
what his theater most needed was si drop
curtain painted by the famous Melssonier.
So he went to the artisi's studio and
proposed the matter to him. "How large
Is This curtain to be, Monsieur?" asked
Meiasonier. "It will be 10 meters high

said Meissonier- amiably; "it will take me

not completed.
MAMMA-IN-LAW IS RECONCILED.
Officer Michael Murphy and His Bonny Young
Bride Are Welcomed Home.
The romantic glamour that hovered over the recent marriage of Officer
Murphy and pretty Emma Lavelle has been torn aside by the ruthless
hand of no less a person than the happy groom.
Officer Murphy will not have it that there has been an elopement. He
views his mariage in a most matter-of-fact, prosaic manner. He will not
admit that he is*a hero of romance and that in his case a dashing, man
ly physique decked in blue and adorned with brass buttons made a beau
tiful girl forget for a moment all about home and mother.
Mrs. Lavelle also, now that the prodigal daughter has happily re
turned, is overwhelmed with amazement with all the talk about elope
ment. ' According to the lady's later version of the marriage, she knew
all about it, having been informed on Friday last by the happy, infatuated
bride-to-be.
The eloping couple returned yesterday morning, and at once sought
Mamma Lavelle and Mamma Murphy for the customary blessing. Neither
parent proved obdurate, and both bride and groom were received and
made welcome.
Mrs. Murphy had an interview with her mother yesterday afternoon,
and in the evening the gallant officer and his bride were the guests of
honor at the Lavelle family reunion. For the present Murphy is par
taking of the hospitality hia mother's roof affords. His bride is domiciled
with his sister until the young husband can prepare for her a home.
Yesterday Officer Murphy was busy receiving congratulations and ex
plaining to every one that he had not eloped.
"We just went to Sacramento." so he informed his friends, "and there
were married on Saturday by Father Henry. We are both of age, and I
told my wife to tell her mother that we were going to Sacramento to be
united. So, you see. there was no elopement."
Certainly, Mr. Murphy ought to know, and so his statement puts an
end to the matter.

sary for him to go into the basement and
use the sidewalk elevator. By ill chance
or thoughtlessness he got on the wrong
end of the cage and was jammed against
the elevator door in the. sidewalk.

place. They are on the way to the city
and will arrive to-day or to-morrow. The
deceased was 27 years of age.

complete fan-tan layout. An attempt
was made to capture fan-tan games by a
force from the Central station under Cap
tain Wlttman on Saturday night, but it
was unsuccessful.
ALABAMA STEEL.
The Iron Age publishes a letter from
A. M. Shook of Birmingham, in which he
gives an account of a great steel plant
which is to be erected at Enaley, six miles
from Birmingham.
An era of large and profitable steel
making is undoubtedly opening in the
Birmingham district. The latest processes
make the ores of that region perfectly
available for the production of steel, and
nowhere else in the world is there such
a juxtaposition of all the material needed
in this industry. The plant which Mr.
Shook describes will draw its pig iron, its
coal, its ores and its limestone from the
property of the company, without freight
charge on any of the raw material. The
plant has its entire output engaged in
advance, and It is believed that it will be
very profitable. Alabama produces iron
and steel cheaper than any other part of
the world, and ships iron to every conti
nent. There is no reason why Alabama
should not be one of the great industrial
centers of civilization.â Atlanta Journal.

Three "Women Relieved of Female
Troubles by Mrs. Pinkham.
From Mrs. A. W. Smith, 59 Summer
St., Biddeford, Me.:
" For several years I suffered with
various diseases peculiar to my sex.
Was troubled with a burning sensation
across the small of my back, that all-
gone feeling, was despondent, fretful
and discouraged; the least exertion
tired me. I tried several doctors but
received little benefit. At last I de-
cided to give your Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound a trial. The ef-
fect of the first bottle was magical.
Those symptoms of weakness that I
was afflicted with, vanished like vapor
before the sun. I cannot speak too
highly of your valuable remedy. It is
truly a boon to woman."
From Mrs. Melissa Phii.mps, Lex-
ington, Ind., to Mrs. Pinkham:
"Before I began taking your medicine
I had suffered for two years with that
tired feeling, headache, backache, no ap-
petite, and a run-down condition of the
system. I could not walk across the
room. I have taken four bottles of the
Vegetable Compound, one box of Liver
Pills and used one package of Sanative
Wash, and now feel like a new woman,
and am able to do my work."
From Mrs. Mollje E. Herbel, Pow-
ell Station, Term.:
1 'For three years I suffered with such a
weakness of the back, I could not
perform my household duties. I also
had falling of the womb, terrible bear-
ing-down pains and headache. I have
taken two bottles of Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound and feel
like a new woman. I recommend your
medicine to every woman I kn/vÂ«* "

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, "WEDNESDAY, AUCHIST :t, '.18QS.
EDWARDS DAVIS
UNDER THE BAN
Not Considered Fit to
Preach.
MUST LEAD A BETTER LIFE
EVERY CHURCH OF CHRIST IS
NOTIFIED.
Resolutions Unanimously Adopted at
a Mass Meeting of Clergymen
Now in Convention at
Santa Cruz.
Special Dispatch to The Calk
SANTA CRUZ. Aug. 2.â Edwards
Davis is no longer to be allowed to
preach in the pulpits of the Christian
Church of California. This afternoon,
at a mass meeting of Christian Church
preachers, the following resolutions
were unanimously adopted:
To the Churches of Christ Everywhere:
We, the Christian ministers of California,
assembled In mass meeting at Santa
[ Cruz, this Augvist 1. 189S, desire to in
form you. of the unanimous action taken
by us in regard to Edwards Davis of Oak
land. Cal., who. having been charged
with immoral conduct by the Central
Christian Church of Oakland, was ex
cluded from Its fellowship. He afterward
confessed to the Ministerial Union, about
â  the bay. his guilt.' and that he was Justly
i excluded; therefore.
Resolved, That, although he was re
stored to the fellowship of the said Cen
tral. Christian. .Church and granted a let
ter of commendation, yet since this act of
restoration was premature and was the
act of one of. the board. of the church and
not of the congregation, we most em
phatically affirm our conviction that he
should not be recognized by any of our
churches as a minister of Jesus Christ,
! nor permitted to preach in their pulpits
until such time as he shall have given
conclusive evidence of genuine repent
ance- and reformation of llfe^ â¢ â :
Resolved, That we deeply regret the ne
cessity laid upon us for taking this ac
tion, : and do now and Tshall continue to
pruy for him that he may yet become a
true Christian minister, tilled with the
spirit of Christ.
Resolved, That this action be published
in our church papers and In the Oakland
and San Francisco dailies. Wo take this
action in mass meeting because Mr. Da
. vis, not being a member of our State Min
isterial Association, Is not subject to
action by that body as such.

Special Dlspatoh to The Call.
WATPONVILLE, Aug. 2.â The article
nday f s Call which connected Miss
Ella Royite, late matron of the Agnews
â yliuxv, with the Inguglia di
vorce case, has attracted great interest
in this city, where Miss Hoyse was
bitira and has spent most of her life.
The people of this city and valley do
not believe the statements set forth by-
Mrs. Inguglia, and believe they have
inspired by the opponents of Man-
White of Agnews Asylum, who
lea here, and is a brother-in
â¢ M:ss Hoyse. The people of this
vÂ«iley believe that the unprincipled and
; utable opponents of Mr. White on
th* A.enews Board of Managers are
cowardly striking at him through the
fair name of his sister-in-law. Miss
se" and Edward White are most
highly respected in this section of Cali
fornia, and nothing their enemies can
do will lower them in the esteem of
their friends.
In an interview to-day Mr. White had
the following to say In connection with
tiro matter:
" lv behalf of my sister-in-law, Miss
c, 1 (I*ssre to say that she is in no
j.nanrier connected with Inguglia or his
ftlfeged scandalous conduct, and the
allegation made by Mrs. Inguglia is a
barÂ»--f;iced slander, originating, no
(It-vuht. with certain people whose ill
â will Miss Royse has incurred in con
|i*vU'pn with the late investigation at
as. These matters will, however,
hi- fully, investigated in court, and those
wvh'i art now attempting to blacken the
.. a-i'iri of a respectable young lady
wtH be. punished as they deserve.
â¢ Miss Royse was not discharged as
mat rorr.fr/> in Agnews for improper con
duct, as the' article states, but resigned
h<-T position last May of her own ac- ;
iebrtL These facts just stated in con
nection with Miss Royse I am prepared
to. and win substantiate."

party in the qounty, State and Con
gressional conventions. From now on
until the elections are held meetings
will be held throughout the county un
der the auspices of the club. In this
way it is expected to educate the voters
as to what is right and show them the
evils of corruption and boss rule in
politics.
Every precinct of the county has been
organized, and It is the thoroughness of
this work that predicts an overwhelm
ing success. The delegates are all
practically agreed upon, arid the list
will be published in a few days. The
men selected to represent the party in |
the conventions will be the cleanest and
most representative ever sent to politi
cal gatherings. Heretofore Rea has
named all the delegates, and it became
very nauseating to the better element.
Now the people have determined to
rule, and to accomplish this they- will
rally to the support of the delegates of
the Good Government Club.
The County Convention will be com
posed of 165* delegates. Of this num
ber 58 are from the City and 107 from
outside precincts. In the latter pre
cincts the Good Government Club Is j
especially strong and its organization
perfect. It is also doing good work in
the city.
The Rea gang Is working a new ruse |
to pull the wool over the unsuspecting I
voters' eyes this time. Dewey clubs j
have been organized in the First, Sec- !
ond and Fourth Wards, Alameda, j
Crandallville and Franklin districts, |
and into these the Rea lambs have j
flocked. It was thought by the i
Mackenzies and their superior that the j
patriotism aroused by the war would
cause many to be drawn into their
meshes through the formation of
Dewey clubs. But this plan has proved |
a failure, for there are few In these
clubs whose faces are not familiar at
Rea meetings. Their membership- 4s
about evenly divided between Republi
cans and Democrats.
There is a warm fight on for delegates >
in the Supervisorial. District represent- |
ed by George E. Rea, a brother of the j
boss, and the gang Is making every ef- !
fort to win out. "Jim" Rea has de- i
clared he must carry the district. Gil- :
roy is" in the district, and here a bitter
opposition has sprung up to Rea. E. j
H. Farmer is making the fight against !
the gang man and the prospects are ;
that he will beat him. Boss Rea ia so -
1 anxious to have his brother re-elected
I that he has declared he will spend $2500
to carry the district.
This evening the members of the
Good Government Club held an enthu
i siastic meeting at Los Gatos. Thursday
' night there will be a mass meeting at
; Moreland, at the school house, at 7:30.1
! A number of prominent speakers will
'be present. The campaign is now fair
ly opened, and r/eetings will be held in
various parts of the county from now
! until the primaries are held.
C. F. Freltag. a trustee of the Good
i Government Club, in an interview to
day, said; "The aims and object of the
club is good government without boss
rule. "We want good government by the
people, and want the people to select
material, for office and elect, men who
will perform their duties without hav
ing the boss dictate to them. The Good
Government Club is Republican, and is
working for the permanent advance
j ment of the Republican party in State
| and national politics. Heretofore the
I boss has endeavored to rule b <th polit-.
i ical parties and select such men from
, each as he wanted."
THE YEAR'S RECEIPTS
AND DISBURSEMENTS
Large Deficiency Due to Demands on
the Treasury Because of the
"War.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2.â Assistant
Secretary Howell to-day made public
the following statement in regard to j
the receipts and disbursements of the j
Government during the last fiscal year:
Receipts, including Pacific Railroad
items, were $405,321,335; expenditures,
Including Pacific Railroad items, $443,
368,582, leaving a deficit of $38,047,247.
If we exclude the receipts from Pa
cific railroads, amounting to $$4,751,223,
and the expenditures on this account of
$4,549,368, the account would stand as
follows: Receipts, $340,670,110; expendi
tures, $438,819,214; deficit, $98,249,103.
This large deficit is accounted for in
part by the extraordinary demands
upon the treasury to carry on the war
A conservative estimate of the war ex
penditures during the months of March.
April, May and June, is $56,000,000. If
we deduct this from the $'98,249,103 the
deficit would be $42,249,103.
In other words, the deficit would not
have exceeded this amount on a peace
basis. At the end of the first seven
I months of the fiscal year the deficit
! was $51,901,823. Deduct from, this $42,
i 249,103 and we find that the deficit has
i been reduced during the last five
! months of the fiscal year $9,662,719. It
'â¢ thus appears that during the last five-
I months of the year our receipts ex-
I ceeded our expenditures on a peace ba
sis over $9,500,000; or, to express it in
i another way, the tariff law of 1897 pro
i duced during the last five months of
i the fiscal year a revenue which exceeds
1 oar orainary expenses by over $9,000,
i ooe.

FROM ALASKA
Few Lucky Men Among
Her Passengers.
ONE BRINGS $30,000 IN DUST
TRAGIC END OF A YOUNG MAN
FROM CHICAGO.
Falls Two Hundred Feet Down the
Valdez Glacier â Three Thou-
sand Gold-Seekers Strug
gling to Return.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Aug. 2.â The steamship
Oregon arrived on the Sound to-night
from Sitka and Dyea. There were on
board nearly 100 passengers from the
Copper River country and Dawson.
Some few Yrom the latter had gold dust,
one lucky miner 'bringing out $30,000.
Passengers from Copper River report
the tragic ending of a young man of 22
years named Frank C. Fleming of
Chicago. Accompanied by his father
and a score of other prospectors, he
endeavored to cross the Valdez glacier.
Heedless of the caution not to go so
fast, Fleming distanced his compan
ions, who suddenly heard a penetrating
shriek. The young man had slipped
from the ice crevices and was hurled
into eternity nearly 200 feet below.
Search was made for his body, arid
when found it was. scarcely more, than
a mass of bruised flesh and broken
bones; The body was. interred at a
convenient spot in the neighborhood of
the accident. - "
Several returning fishermen from
Orca were on board the Oregon. They
report an extraordinarily good catch
this season by the Pacific Steam Whal
ing Company. Thirty thousand cases
of salmon have already been packed,
with fishing going on night and day.
The ship America, which left Departure
Bay a week ago with a cargo of coal,
is anxiously awaited at Orca. After she
arrives and discharges a cargo of fish
will be taken on for San Francisco.
The rush from Copper River con
tinues. Returning men state that there
are 3000 people on the glacier struggling
to return. The ice is fast melting and
streams are swollen so high and run
ning so swfft that it is now dangerous
to endeavor to cross them, but rather
than take chances cm starvation pros
pectors will risk anything in the effort
to return. Unless Government aid is
extended many will die from starvation
and exposure.
MOONLIGHT WRECKED
IN KOTZEBUE SOUND
Within Twenty-Five Miles of Her
Destination â Passengers and
Their Outfits Saved.
SEATTLE, Aug. 2.â The first news
received from the many vessels that
left here early in the summer with
goldseejcera for Kotzebue Sound, Alas
ka, came to-day in a letter from
Charles Thornton, announcing the
Wreck of the schooner Moonlight, July
2, at the entrance of the Kawayk River.
Her passengers' and their outfits were
saved. The vessel was wrecked on one
of the many small Islands that lie in
the entrance of Kotzebue Sound. The
skipper, who was unfamiliar with the
coast, refused to take on Indian pilots.
. The Moonlight Was one of the vessels
to sail from here this season for Kotze
bue Sound. She sailed on the same
night that the schooner Jane Gray, also
I bound for Kotzebue Sound. The Jane
Gray was wrecked May 22 a few hun
dred miles off Cape Flattery, with a
loss, of thirty-six lives. The Moonlight
succeeded In getting within twenty-five
miles of her destination. The Moon
light carried from here fifty-five pas
sengers. On the Moonlight was a large
amount of lumber. This was saved and
will be used by the shipwrecked pas
sengers in the construction of boats to
ascend the Kawayk River and contin
ue their explorations. ' .

PLATA DEL ESTE, Cuba, Guanta- j
namo Bay, Aug. 2, 2 p. m.â News has
been received here to-day from General
Calixto Garcia and the Cuban forces'
under him at Mayarl, near the Bay: of ;
Nipe, on the north coast of the prov- j
ince of Santiago de Cuba, The report
is that General Garcia has been in a
heavy fight with Spanish troops, who
were trying to effect a junction with
the main body of Spanish regulars at
Holguin. These Spaniards were prob
ably the force that evacuated Nipe Bay
during the recent naval bombardment.
A large body of Cuban reinforcements
had reached General Garcia and the im
pression is that he defeated the Span
iards in this engagement, or at least
held his own. The Cuban dispatch s-*ys
that two cannon had already been
taken from the enemy and the Spanish
cavalry had been defeated.
General Garcia had moved toward
Holguin, as it was reported that the
Spaniards were trying to open, their
way through the Cuban lines to the
Province of Puerto Principe.
The Inhabitants of Caimanera and
Guantanamo are now receiving Red
Cross supplies from Santiago.
The tug Manati. recently surrender
ed arrived here to-day from Cienfue
gos in charge of Ensign McFarland of
the gunboat Helena. Ensign McFarland
says that the reports from Trinidad,
Cape Cruz, Manzanillo and Clenfuegos
indicate great suffering and starvation
throughout the whole section where the
blockade is doing its Work, with much
expedition. It is believed Manzanillo
will have to surrender on demand to
the navy before many weeks.

Defy Detection.. ,/
SAN JOSE, Aug. 2.â During the past
week the city has been flooded wnth
counterfeit silver dollars and halves
that are made wholly of pure sliver.

practically defy detection. Their weight
is a fraction of a grain more than that
of the coins . minted by . the Govern

ItOS ANGELES, Aug. 2.â Following
Is the climate and crop bulletin sum
mary of the weather bureau for South
ern California: Clear, moderately warm
days and cloudy and foggy nights oc
curred in the coast sections, while in
the interior very hot, clear weather pre
vailed during the past week, some cor
respondents stating that the week was
the warmest of the season. No rain
fell, which is the normal condition at
this period of the year, but the moisture
from the fogs in the coast sections was
beneficial to vegetation. The lack of
irrigating water is becoming apprecia
ble, a report thi;s week stating that
orange trees are suffering from the
want of water and fear is entertained
that the fruit will drop unless the trees
are irrigated soon. Peaches are ripen
ing rapidly; the yield varies greatly,
some places reporting a light crop while
others state that the crop will be ex
cellent In yield and quality. The raisin
crop in the southern sections will be
light and grapes will be of an inferior
quality.

THE LUMBER TRADE.
â  " Pacific Coast Wood and Iron Bays of Lum
-â \je.r:: - â  -,' s â  ;
â¢'â¢'â  "There does seem to be an improvement In
â â¢'the-, lumber trade, although mill owners con
tinue to complain. â  Several of the Humboldt
mills during the last month received a number
.of large â  orders although at continued low
'"prices. Everybody seems waiting for the war
â ': to close "when an advance in price may be
..made,- for building will be resumed. One order
'"tor over 900,000- feet of redwood has been, placed
by one of the large firms In the city. This looks
â &s though some movement was on loot. \\ netner
â¢ this was for home or foreign consumption is
D nt 'âown. The lietall Association seems de
termined to keep prices down, and it Is re
ported that there will be a cut in prices early
â â  this month. The Government has placed sev
eral orders for lumber at ruling prices. .
"' â¢â¢'The general Eastern situation is similar
" to- that which usually prevails during this
-.season of the year. The consumptive demands
are, few aiid small, while prices remain as they
â were â  last month. In the north accumulated
â tack is finding a resnor.Mve market, especially
certain grades of specified thickness. Prices
are steady, with a strong tendency toward ad
â vancement. Excellent reports are being re
calved from the Southern markets, and prices
â arÂ« firm- with frequent and heavy demands for
â¢Â°yard : stock. Where the East, North and South
have a decidedly wholesome advantage, over
the West ie in freightrates, for the shippers
are well satisfied with the present situation."
" -"Hardwood In the West is unusually quiet,
and there is a marked contrast apparent be
: tween June and July business as compared
.with that of May. Business in the hardwood
circles seems certain to pick up with the com
â¢ ing- wet weather. Yard stock is plentiful here,
'while all reports from Eastern points seem to
,' agree on a perceptible shortage in their yards.
Fall business In hardwoods promises well.
â¢-: ; The prevailing shingle circumstances are
â¢not over and above pleasin<r. Business.. is mori
bund, although shingle transportations this
year exceed those of 1897 from Northwestern
points. The redwood shingle is making its way.
j steadily into the East and promises to be there
Ito stay. The excellence of the redwood shingle
: should* insure its attendance "at the finish.'
â¢ Taken as a whole, July business conditions,
' "Brlille not good, are far from bad, and prospects
are promising especially should next year be
': a prosperous one with a good rainfall. Look
' out for a war risÂ« in local wholesale lumber

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Aug. 2.â The tendency of the
speculation in railroad stocks to separate itself
from that in the industrial specialties became
more marked to-day than yesterday. The In
dustrials have not yet fallen to a minor place
in the speculation as they are likely to do at a
time when widespread general demand springs
up for standard railroad securities, but there
were evidences of a culmination of speculative
movements in some of them to-day and the j
realizing was covered by manipulative ad- :
vances in others. Brooklyn Transit and Rub
ber were the most conspicuous sufferers from
dlquldatlon and while Tobacco and Cotton Oil j
.. continued to advance, by far the most slgnifl- !
cant movement in the market was the enlarged 1
â¢ demand fox railroad stocks. This was most :
â  conspicuous in the Grangers, but the Pacific !
railroads also shared in the movement and
there was a distinctly broadening tendency on
. traffic all through the list.
The fact that gold imports were fairly inau
gurated to-day with the announcement that j
over $2,0<Xi,000 was engaged in London for lm
port and over SI.MKi.uOO shipped from Sydney !
to San Francisco had a sentimental effect j
In hardening the market. Thf-re was nothing
In the local money market, however, to Indi
cate the need of additional funds. The sub
treasury 1b again losing largely to the banks |
on account of war expenditures and there Is ;
no appreciable demand from the interior in '
spite of the large increase in business and the j
movement of the crops.
The bond market was active in middle low
grade issues, which generally advanced. Total
â ales, J3,24'.,000.
United States 3s touched JOS to-day on sales
and the Governments were strong all around
on the announcement by a Treasury official
that there would probably be no need of an
other issue on account of the large receipts
from the war revenue.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 283,100
shares, including: Burlington, 24.120; Louisville
and Nashville, 3225; Northern Pacific, 5420;
Northern Pacific preferred, 14.452; Rock Island,

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET:
CHICAGO, Aug. 2.â Better Liverpool cables
than expected, In addition to disposition mani
fested by fanners to hold their ne-w crop, for
advanced prices,' caused a bullish feeling in
wheat at the . opening. Chicago got only 130
cars, against 3SI a year ago. Minneapolis and
Duluth reported 82 cars, compared.. with 371
the year before. Receipts at other important
Western points being disappointingly small,
added to the firmness with which trade -com
menced. Not much attention was given to a
dispatch from "Washington saying that, the Rus
sian Government would probably iesue a ukase
prohibiting grain exports on account of small
stocks and crop failures. Some such report
was received here during the Letter deal, and
to-day' a rumor was generally believed- to- be tna
original, story polished by some -enthusiastic
bull, who possessed a knowledge of the â  gen
eral fcrgetfulness of the speculative .crowd.
Prices here were kept strong on statistical fig
ures until the continental â¢ markets turned
weak. Paris came lc a bushel lower and Ant
werp showed a decrease of from 1%-to 4c a
bushel. September, which was selling here At "
64'*c. declined to C4^c on that showing of
weakness abroad.- There was evidently lots of
short wheat to cover weak spots- and. the price
did not remain down for more than a few
minutes. The close was %@V4c higher for Sep
tember and %Â©%c higher for December. â¢ ,
The longs in corn could not stand -up against
the general bearish sentiment induced by the
liberal rains of the last few days. Holders of
puts and shorts were good buyers at the de
cline. September closed Tic lower. â¢
Oats suffered fractionally with corn. . Traders
who bought liberally last week were sellers -to
. day. The close was Ho lower for September. .
Lower prices for hogs at the yards,, together
with the, decline In corn, weakened provisitns.
Packers liquidated ' freely. ' Pork dropped -30c,

are selling: actively at the high prices, and the

PARDEE PUTS
NO FAITH IN
HIS FRIENDS
Dec I alas He Will Name His
O\vn Delegates to the
Convention.'
An Affront to the Republican Clubs That
They Will Not Be Slow to
Resent.
;;;;(9A*irA^;i>..Aug..2.â Pardee has
. taken the matter of selecting his dele
; gates. :tp.;thÂ« : Republican State conven
â  tion Into his -. own hands, and he will
not allow even his friends whose suf
â¢ frag* h-e seeks, the men who bear the
.. brunt; of keeping the party organiza
tion intact, .who carry the torches and
' do the: shouting, the. common courtesy
of selecting the men they are to vote
â 'for;;-: instead,' the doctor boldly asserts
that, he will select the delegates him
: :self. â â ,:.:" . â ..â â  .".',:
' In . other words, Dr. Pardee refuses
..to triist even his ; friends. He will ig
- nor<? .the rights of the clubs, but will
peddle out a list for each Assembly dis
;,trtci:ijid:. order his followers to vote
for -them. Nothing could be plainer
than. Pardee's intentions in the prem
ises. Here is his declaration : 7Â» : ;- s
â¢" "I ##l do my own selecting. The
clubs are all right, of course, but I
think I am the best Judge of the dele
gates who would ba most desirable
In tfc*. interests of my candidacy.
. "Sugg^BtioniS: would be proper enough,
but dub . elections I do not believe
; wouid obtain thÂ© best results."
>H6vt his;: humble followers in the
r an accept this â  aspersion upon
tjseir inteLJigenee and honesty remains
to be Been,-, but. that large numbers of
the m.ore independent men will resent
the affront in no undecided manner is
certain. ; Dr. Pardee will condescend to
permit them :to make suggestions, but
that- is all, After they have made their
suggestions, he will go right ahead and
act foir.hi.niii&elf -without the slightest re
gard fo-rh.is friends' wishes.- -"â :.â  "'â -.
:.-; iHis assertion â¢ that club elections
â  would Sot obtain the best results, in his
opinion,- is a simple declaration that he
places- no confidence in those he asks
.and' expects to : support him. Surely
Pardei?. ; cannot' expect to carry out
this,, high- handed proceeding without
.a "revolt, and the unholy alliance be
tw^en Pardee and the Buckley -
MagUires whereby that tong's hatchet
rften:-. -are to .be used at the primaries
In; doctor's interest, becomes all the
more apparent. .;'â¢. ' '. â  â¢ '. :
: : .M^ij. 'about town thoroughly versed in
the situation .and of every political

b:6.d>j; -else 'h-as' recognized for some time
r^-that.,is,..th;at he is not as strong now
as :"hfc : W'jEis .six-- weeks or two months
$&<>. V This Is true, and Pardee Is grow- '
ing' desperate, as is. further evidenced
by his: BuckJeyr-Maguire- Examiner a.l
: liai>Go". â ;;â :'. l\ â ;â ". : . .
:'- ; : . declaration has . had the
.efiect':bi ajarmUig Davis, and while he
lias pot yet. be.en able to figure out the
fullslgÃincahpe 6f his opponent's latest
â  H).6ve,''h.e, too- is. inclined to personally
supervise.: the selection of his own can
didates for the . ; convention. This is
what iDavis. says: ";'\ .' - '-."â "
4i The selectipn of delegates for the
prinlary â¢ ticket is a matter which
will not .concern me until my execu
tive Â° committee â¢â  concludes its work.
The : members of this committee from
|he; various sections will decide upon.
the name* best suited to my candi
dacy, ; and when the lists are complet
ed, of course,- they will be submitted
to me: fox final approval. The idea of
club elections will not p vail, though
whatever .-.I my ; ' executive committee
does is agreeable to me."
: The action of these two gubernatorial
candidates completely ignoring the par
ty .organization and descending to the
pitiful : expedient of personally handing
out ; the.. names, of those they want to go
to Sacramento will have the effect of
greatly extending the already rapidly
growing Sentiment in favor or electing
.an unjristructed and unpledged delega
tion from Alameda County. Within the
past week this sentiment has found
considerable favor among the more in
dependent Republicans and is becoming
more popular each day. In Alameda,
particularly; this plan has met with
such favor that it will undoubtedly be
carried out, and it is not at all improb
able that with Pardee and Davis both
assurhihg. the functions of a ward boss,
a solid-, uninstructed delegation will be
selected. ; - .. ;-t :^ '. . :
Those who favor the plan argue on j
this line; With two gubernatorial can
didates from the county, neither of
â whom has any outside support worth
mentioning, and with a divided delega
tion. Alameda. the banner Republican
county of the State, will find herself at
the close of the convention completely
out in the cold. She will lose the head
of the ticket and In bickering among
themselves the delegates will neglect to
garner, any of the other nominations.
This is sound reasoning, and many
of the supporters of both candidates
are. beginning i to - recognize its â  force.'
On the. other hand, it is urged, if the
delegation is uninstructed it will stand
a much better chance of forming, an
effective combination In favor oof one
or the other of the two candidates, or
if not, it will be-in a position to ask and
receive; almost, anything else it may
want. â  'â¢â ; .-. â . V^-H'A ;
In this connection it is worthy of
note that lloow o down in their innermost
thoughts there are lamentably few
friends of -either Pardee or Davis who
have any expectation of their man get
ting the nomination. They talk big,
but; sift the shouting and the tall/lng
down and it is found that the whole
fuss is merely over the capture of o the
county delegation. Some of the en
thusiasts seem to think that the Ala
rneda delegation will constitute the con
vention, and when apprised of their
misapprehension they stop and ask
themselves what they are making so
much fuss for if that is the case. Oth
ers seem to work merely for, the small
honor their candidate will accrue from
going : before the" convention backed by
a. majority his " county-delegation,
and have no expectation of any greater
faybr : falling to their- champion.
." Yes,- it- Is becoming more and more
evident that Alamedans realize that the
Republican â¢ nomination for Governor
will not come jto them this year. . N .
' The- -Democratic County Committee
met to-night and issued a call for pri
maries to elect . delegates to the State
convention. . The call fixes the date of â ;
the primaries for Thursday, August 11, J
between the hours of 3 and 8 p.m. In
: Oakland proper balloting will be by
dub roll, and in the outside districts
the County Committee is given the op
tion of ordering primaries or voting by
club roll, as they see fit. As the ma
jority favored the club. roll it is likely
that this plan will be adopted through
out the county. Rolls will be opened
to-morrow and remain open until next .
Tuesday night.
Under the State call the apportion
ment of delegates to Alameda County
was forty-three, including one at large.
Based on the vote of two years ago the
committee apportioned the districts as
follows: Oakland â First Ward, 3; Sec
ond Ward, 4; Third Ward, 3; Fourth
Ward, 3; Fifth Ward, 2; Sixth Ward,
3; Seventh Ward, 3. Aiameda, 5; Berke
ley, 3; Oakland outside district, 3;
Brooklyn, 2; Eden, 3; Washington, 1;
Murray, 3; total, 41, allowing two dele
gates at large. Alameda generously
offered to give up one of her delegates,
making three at large, and the after
was accepted.
Commiueeman Logan offered a reso
lution naming R. M. Fitzgerald, W. W..
Foote and M. F. Tarpey for delegates
at large, and it was unanimously
adopted.
S. Bachrach was elected secretary of
the committee and seven members were
chosen to fill vacancies, .as follows:
Fifth Ward, Oakland, H. C. McPike
and M. Ogarra; Sixth Ward, Patrick
Mullln; Seventh Ward, Dr. Fine; Eden
Township, Carl Iverson; Brooklyn, John
H. Riley; Alameda, T. C. Stodriard. The
committee then adjourned.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 3, 1898.
A DUEL WITH HORSEWHIPS.
'â¢'. â¢-'" Oakland Office â : San Francisco ..Call,
.... ' . ; : . . 908 Broadway, Aug. 2.
Mrs. Torres' horsewhip .was very much in evidence last Sunday morn
ing, when.she met young. Mr. Duple.sse, and for a few minutes, the crowd
in front of the Postofflce. at Dimond, were regaled with the spectacle of
a duel,, in. which horsewhips were 1 the weapons . . ; : .
â¢ Mrs. Torres- and -Mr. Duples-se are neighbors; and live some dlsta-ncÂ©
from the Postofflce. Last Sunday mornihg they were driving in to get
their letters. Duplesse was ahead of Mrs. Torres, and the lady was anx
ious to pass him. . He persisted in preventing her. althmigh her horse was
the speedier animal of the two. At a narrow part of the road- Duplesse
made himself particularly obnoxious, and Mrs. Torres -remonstrated, with
him. -Remonstrances passed, from one to the other for a. few minutes, but
finally Mrs. Torres took the lead and got to the Hermitage first. A. little
later Dupfesse drove up, and no sooner had he got out of his cart than the
quarrel was renewed, and Mrs, Torres started to use her whip. She landed
a couple of cuts, and then Duplesse tried to stand her off witn his whip.
For a. few minutes there was considerable fun. but finally ttvey weFe
separated, each threatening arrest, but so far no warrant has been issued.
WATER FRONT
FIGHT AGAIN
Hundreds of Reclaimed
Acres in Dispute.
SEEKING THE TIDE LINE
MONTHS OF TRIAL SAVED BY
USING FORMER EVIDENCE.
The First Skirmish Over an Old Map
Is Tetnporarily a Victory for
:. the Corporation.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
' . 908 Broadway, Aug. 2.
It Is very evident that a considerable
portion of the evidence in the second trial
of the water front case will be directed
to finding out where the tide land was in
1-852, for only after this is decided can the
instructions of the Supreme Court be fol
lowed. As water front lines have been con
siderably changed, owing to the immense
fills that have been, made between the
pieFS and the moles thousands of acres
once awash are now inside the tide line
and are of great value. â  â¢
The retrial of- the water front case- was
commenced before Judge Ogden to-day,
an-d will occupy perhaps a month.
It was agreed between .counsel that the
record of the case ae.it appeared io the
Supreme Court be considersd in evidence
again.. The last trial occupied about five
months. All rights, objections, and ex
ceptions of each, party, are reserved as.
before, and each party is allowed to in
troduce further' evidence- tn conformity
with the recent d-ecision.
There was a strong legal array present
at -to-day's proceedings. W. R. Davis, W.
Lair Hill, E. J. Pringle, H. A. Powell and
W A. Dow represented tne plaintiff, th.
city of Oakland, and A. A.. Moore ami
Harvey S. Brown opened the case for the
defendant .corporation!
During- this- afternoon Attorney . Davis.
on behalf of the city,- offered in evidence
a map from the United States Coast and |
Geodetic- Survey Office ait Washington,;
D C being a certified map tracing that i
showed th-e lln* of low tide (which the
Sapreme Conrt- held was ship channel) :
as that line existed In 1852, at which time
the State granted the property to the I
Town of Oakland; and when the Town of j
Oakland granted land to -Carpentler.
Judge Ogden sustained the objections ;
made by Attorney Moore and plaintiff's-;
â counsel "was not allowed to introduce such :
evidence nor was the map admitted.
The court, however, agreed that- when
the city shows the dedication of certain
streets this. question may be reopened and
evidence allowed.
The court also intimated that when a ;
decision is reached it will be so worde.d j
as not to run the line of. low tide or ex
tend any artificial fills. This would ex
clude the moles and piers.
Th-e trial goes on again at 9 o'clock to
morrow morning-- ' .
1 TAKES HIS OWN LIFE.
Emanuel Jonas Hangs Himself After
Calmly Preparing for the Deed.
BERKELEY. Aug. 2. --Emanuel Jonas

hanging himself shortly after 4 o'clock
this morning. â¢ . . '
At the time of his death he was living
with his brother at 1544 Addlson street.

Ing to a beam suspended over a gateway,

Mr. Jonas- and his. brother, Louis, in
vested the money which came to them as
heirs of the estate in a wholesale meat
market on Mission street, near Seventh.
Business reverses made the investment a
failure. For. several years decedent lived
alone on Stevenson street, dependent
upon relatives for support. He had al
ways suffered from rheumatism, and con
stant sickness wrecked his body. He
leaves neither wife nor children.

little' ones without food lie" 'declined- to
put them out. He rented a little house
for the unhappy woman,- and instead, of
putting her furniture on the street he
moved it to .the new home arid "paid- Its
modest rent, for one month. He then went
to Sanderson for the fee of $4 and to
night he refused to pay it. â¢ â  â¢ . .
"I will 'attach- his property, for the fee,"
said Constable Weidler to-night; -""for
when I asked him why. he objected to

" â¢ ' , 'â¢â â ;â  908. Broadway, Aug. 2.
Rev. U. S-. Hughes; formerly, of San
Jose arid more recently of this city, ls
'somewhere in British Columbia, and if he
eanbe reached with legal' papers he- will
have to answer a divorce suit brought by
his first wife,, and which may'- possibly
lead to his being charged with bigamy;
j. Last April Rev. Ural Surnrter Hughes
: married. Miss Lena. L. Taber at her
{mother's home on Hobart street. At
! that time he was. the husband "of Mrs.
i Mabe.l Hughes, whom he married at Chl
i cago in March; 1894. It was. While at
I school at Evanston',. 111., that HugheÂ» met
Miss Mabel Tyler, whom he married
I when . he- wu-s under age. He lived with
her for a couple, of " years and then â¢ de
i serted her, saying that he had to go. to
'â  Pennsylvania to settle up .his fathers
i estate. He never returned, and since that
i time Mrs. Hughes has been trying to^flnd
him.- Hughes, came to California, and on
, the showing that he was under. 19 years
; of age when he was married and that the
! ceremony was performed without the con
i sent of his parents and- that' he had never
lived with his wife, Ju-dge Troutt set tne
marriage, aside. ' .
At -the hearing of the. suit a deposition
I was read from Mrs. Frances Hughes, tn6
i mother of the young husband, in which
! she testified to her son's age. and to meet-
I ing him and his wife in New York, where
i the children told her' they had Tfcieen se
cretly married. She .also testified that
owing' to false' representations By Miss
; Mabel Tyler, she induced her so-n to marry
j her. The marriage was set, aside in May,
! 1596. When Mrs.' Hughes learned that she
r.waa divorced she at once communlaated
with attorneys In Sarr Francisco and told
her' story. She says that Hughes, induced
her to marry .him and secured the license
by swearing that he was 23 years of age.
! She -met his mother and livea with him at'
i her. house until he deserted her. Procefed
i ings ; w;ere commenced in San Francisco to
have the decree of annulment set aside on
. the 'ground of. fraud-.. Before Hughes
i could be served with the papers he- nis
aj)peared. and was later- found at the Pa
.cific Theological Seminary in this city. As
n result of the suit, J.udge Troutt in Au
gust of last year set aside the decree an
- nulling the marriage.
. Last April, while pastor, of the Metho
i dipt church- in San Jose, Hughes married
Miss Taber and a notice of the wedding
appeared lrv an Eastern newspaper and
was seen by the first Mrs. Hughes. She
'then filed & suit for divorce in. Chicago.
mid sent papers out here, to be. served
j on her husband. He offere.d to make a
cash settlement with his first, wife, but
she wired- back to" her attorneys that
be was a bigarhist and money- was no bb
j'i-et to her, and she wanted him arrested.
â  Without permitting his wife to call on
[ her parents in Oakland Rev. Hughes left
' hÂ»Â« church and headed north. He has
j been seen in Portland and British Co
. lumbla, but it i-s not known, where he. is
'. at- present, although should a warrant be
j Issued it is said the detectives employed
! by the first Mrs. Hughes will have no
; trouble In finding, him.
Mrs. Taber, the mother of the second
, Mrs. Hughes, keeps a boarding-house on
Hobart street. "It would have been bet
â¢ ter," she said' to-day, "to have investi-
I gated the standing of. Mr. Hughes before
I let my daughter" marry him, but I did
not notice how far the courtship had pro
gressed until it was' impossible to stop
I It. When he asked my .consent he re
ferred to Rev. Dr. Dille, and told me to
| ask him about his previous marriage. He
I acted in a very -straightforward manner
and' impressed mÂ«.with the idea that the
other woman was an adventuress. I do
not believe he tried to conceal, anything
from my daughter ana he read to her the
papers annulling his- first marriage. He
believed he was entirely free from the
oth-or woman, and as far as I can see he
was at liberty to marry again.
"The woman evidently intends to make
trouble- for him, and she has had several
deteetrves looking for Mr. Hughes. They
have been here. and talked with me. There
are,, of course, two sides to every story,
â  but we -are inclined to bell-eve in- Mr.
Hughes. He. has been frank and honest,
but I cannot, help wishing . that we had
known more about him before trusting
our daughter to him:" '.
Dr: E-. R. Dille,- pastor of the First M-
E. Church, is well acquainted with
HughÂ«s' past career, and in an interview
this afternoon he said:
The discovery of the .young man's past life
has. been the cause- of great sorrow. I
have known. Hughes fnr a Jong time, or at
least for a couple of years. I knew him before
\1 came to Oakland, and When he entered my
church U wag to a certain extent an probation.
At that time the' only cloud that' I knew that
was overhanging the young man war,- this past
marriage.- â  This was knows .to many erf the
ministers' in our association, but later I have
found out other matters that do nut reflect
altogether creditably ppon the young man.
â He Is .plausible and peasant, but I always
felt that- he could perhaps hear watching. He
came to the church from the Pacific Theolog
ical-Seminary, which I understand he left with
a cloud overhanging him, ami this' did not re
late to his past marriage entirely.
The fact that there had been trouble at the
Pacific Theological Seminary was not known
to me- until the morning of his marriage. Prior
to his marriage he had obtained tije consent
of- the hoard to preach and had a smajl church
in Tuolumne County. He kept, it only for a
short time, however. Then he returned to Oak
land, and- was married.
On the morning of his marriage I wa? told
cf-rtaln facts' concerning his life at the Pacific
Theological Seminary. I felt that it -was too
late to stop the marriage and said nothing
about them. I did not perform the ceremony.
1.. d0 not remember If I was asked to do so,
but in any. case I was going out of town and
couldn't. .
Later these stories of hie life at the semi
nary were formally laid before the Ministers'
Association, and Hashes was dropped from the
ministry. This action was taken after he
failed to appear to answer the. charges.
â Miss Taher I know well. She ls a charming
girl' and belpngsto a fine family. Her marriage
has been most unfortunate.- ' I told hex family
â of- Hughes'- former marriage, and he told the
young lady the story himself. Ho told me his
family was in Chicago, I believe. I do not
know where he is now. â¢ . â â

CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ACTS
BEQUESTS PRESIDENT McKIN
LEY'S CO-OPERATION.
Osborne Howes Delivers an Inter
esting Address Upon the Volume
of Trade Between the Two
Countries.
osborne Howes, a representative of the
Boston Chamber of Commerce, addressed
a- gathering of representative merchants
'; of this city yesterday in the rooms of the
Chamber of Commerce. His subject was
the reciprocal relations between America
" and Canada. President Hugh Craig in
troduced the speaker, dwelling upon the
friendly relations between the two coun
tries. Mr. Howe, who spoke extempora
neously, said, in part: â  ; J
â  We have to the north of us a country nearly
-as large as our own. but sparsely, settled by
about 5,000,000 people, who art by descent, tra
ditions ana cubioms closely similar to our own
. population. For nearly a century we have en
â joyed toother the commerce of the great
â 'â  lakes. â¢ â As It Is at the present time. Canada
. .possesser. through her enormous natural re
' sources, -many commodities that we desire. We
buy generously of the Canadians, while they,
on their side, purchase from us not only more
than they do from any other country, but
form a market for the United States superior,
when the number of people is taken into ac
count, to that which we possess in any other
part of the world. This can be best shown by.
a few comparative exhibits. The sales of
American merchandise in Canada â¢ during the
last- fiscal year, for which returns have been
â¢ "made up, represented purchases by them the
equivalent of $11 GO for every man. woman and
child living In the Dominion. Oreat Britain
has in the last year or two bought American
â¢. products to ' the value of $10 50 per capita. Ger
many has bought of us in recent years goods
to the value- ot $1 90 per capita; France to the
value of $1 25 per capita; Mexico's purchases
â¢' are approximately $1 Â»5 per capita; Venezuela
buys of us Jl 60 for each head of population;
the Argentine Republic Jl 15 and Brazil 8u
cents.
It will be 6een from this showing that th*e
countries of the world where we have appar
ently done the most, to stimulate trade, as, for
. example, the South American republics, .by the
1 an-American congresses and the like, are not
large purchasers of American goods. Li
â¢ In 18M a treaty for reciprocal, trade wire ar
ranged between Canada and the United States.
Under this treaty the following domestic prod
ucts were to be admitted duty free "into each
country: Grain, of all kinds, flour, seeds, vege
â¢ tables, rice and broomcorn; animal? of all
kinds, meat, butter, cheese, tallow, lard, horns,
manure, .poultry, eggs and fruits of all kinds;
cotton, wool, unmanufactured flax, hemp and
tow; timber. and lumber, hewed, sawed and un- I
manufactured, wholly or in part; bark, pitch,
tar. turpentine, ashes, plants, shrubs, trees and
firewood; coal, ores of tell kinds, .-tone and
â¢ marble in its crude state. gyi>sum, ground and
unground. â  and grindstones, hewn, wrought or
unwrought; n>h of all kinds and the products
of fish and fish oil; undressed hides, turs and
â¢ skins, unmanufactured tobacco, dyestuffs and
rugs. Those who read this list will probably
say that It must have been drawn in the Cana
dian interests, for while it represents a great
many commodities that a manufacturing coun
try such as the United States might expect
to buy in Canada,- it represents very little that
" a country like Canada would "be likely to buy
. in the United States, and yet* such a Judgment,
ba*e\i upon what would appear to be obvious,
conditions, would be altogether false. During
the eight years prior to the treaty of reciprocity
our annual sales In Canada were a little over
$9,000,000 a year. During the thirteen years
that tHe reciprocity treaty was in foÂ°rce our
annual average sales were more than $23,000,-
OCO, that Is. th'sre was an increase in our trade
i ( more than 150 penjcf-nt, and during the thir
teen years that the reciprocity treaty was in
force Canada bought -of us. 133,000,000 In goods
- more than we bought of her.
Gentlemen of the San Francisco Chamber of
.. Commerce, as the leading representatives of
the commercial interests of the Pacific Slope.
I appeal .to you to do all that lies In your
power to ai"d your sister association, the Boston
Chamber of Commerce, in placing the diplo
matic and trade relations between the Domin
ion of Canada and the United States upon a
better -and a permanent basis. You must real
. lie. as those making up the great business
communities all over the country are now
realizing, that in the future the people of the
""United States, must look for a large number of
markets outside of their own borders. There
ls.no part of the outer world which offers for
â  us. greater Inducements in- the way of trade
than the country Just to the north of us. It
is because of the eminently practical character
of the end proposed that I ask you as busi
ness men to do whatever lies In your power,
by encouraging' public sentiment and by
' bringing your influence to bear on Congress,
to aid President McKlnley in successfully car
rying out the work upon which he has started,
of bringing closer together, through a union
of common interest?, the English speaking peo
ple, of the North American continent.
At the conclusion of his address the
speaker was tendered a vote of thanks
upon motion of Charles de Haven. The
following resolutions were adopted upon
motion of Captain W. H. Marston, sec
onded by Colonel C. L. Taylor:
Whereas, For both diplomatic and trade
reasons It Is desirable that the most friendly
relations should exist between the United
States and thÂ» Dominion of Canada; therefore
Resolved, That the Chamber of Commerce of
San Francisco trusts that the international
commission, soon to convene for the purpose
of adjusting the differences now existing be
tween these two countries, will succeed In
making a satisfactory settlement of these, and
that this settlement will Include such a re
moval of existing barriers as will promote the
mutual Interests in trade and commerce of the
people living upon both sides of the border line.
Resolved. That copies of this resolution be
sent to the President and the California dele
gation, with the request that they do all In
their power to bring about an International
understanding upon the lines indicated above.

IB" guests at the different cafes and
restaurants about town experienced
difficulty, in securing the services of
gareons last night, it-was not to
be wondered at, and the delay could
only be borne with patience. The rea
son was that many of the prominent

explained President H. H. Hoffman.
"We live in dress suits, you know, and
we get tired of them."
While the pretensions of the club
are not so great a.Â« those of others.
It can boast of something not pos
sessed by them. It has as member*
no less than two Counts, a Baron and

the Men of Com

Two pie peddlers. H. K. Albright and
C. S. Stanton by name, were placed un
der arrest on Monday night, by Captain
H. B. Myers. Company G. First Tennes
see, on a charge of receiving property
stolen from the United States Govern
ment. Captain Myers later turned them
over to Civil Officers Mulcahy and Hart
ley, who booked them at the Central Po
lice Station. The men under arrest have
been selling their wares to the Tennessee
boys for a month past and yesterday
Captain Myers discovered that they were
exchanging pies with the men of his com
pany for blouses, trousers and numerous
other articles of Uncle Sam's wardrobe.
The captain held up their wagon and
found in it a couple of blue shirts and a
blouse, and upon this evidence he de
tained them.
Later the civil officers searched the
barn used by the men at 756 First avenue
and there found enough in the line of
uniforms to equip half a company.
A further search was made yesterday
of Albright's room at 3G4 Jessie street
and they found the place filled with Gov
ernment property of every description.
Two hundred dollars would not cover the
value.
A large portion of the stolen goods ;iaa
never been used,. and evidently had been
stolen from the quartermaster's stores.
A board of survey has been asked for
by Colonel Smith and an effort will be
made to locate the men who have had
their pie at so high a price.
Albright and Stanton were yesterday
turned over to the Federal authorities
and they will appear before United States
Attorney Foote at 10 o'clock this morn

GRAND FAREWELL TO
THE GALLANT SEVENTH
KNIGHTS TEMPLAR PREPARING
A BIG RECEPTION.
Colonel Berry's Men to Appear at the
Mechanics' Pavilion in Aid of
the Red Cross.
Scenes similar to those witnessed in
this city when the First Regiment of
California Volunteers departed for Manila
are about to be enacted again. On Satur
day evening the Seventh Volunteer Regi
ment, commanded by Colonel John R.
Berry, is to be given a grand farewell re
ception at the Mechanics' Pavilion, under
the auspices of Golden Gate Commander)'
No. 16, Knights Templar, in aid of the
Red Cross. Thousands of patriotic people
have attended similar receptions during
the past month, but it is thought that
Immense structure will not hold the as
semblage at the coming reception.
Relatives and friends of the men in the
ranks throughout the southern portion of
the State have availed themselves of the
half rate made by the Southern Pacific
Company, and will attend 4he affair in
large numbers. As the men will leave
a few days later for the dangerous shores
of the Philippines, it is expected that the
reception will be in the nature of an en
thusiastic and patriotic leave-taking by
the citiaene of the State.
Colonel Berry, mindful of the import
ance of the occasion, has arranged a
splendid military programme with a view
to showing his finely drilled body of na
tive sons off to advantage.
Immediately upon the issuance of or
ders that the Seventh would leave on
Monday Instead of Saturday a committee
of arrangements, consisting of Charles

duly admired and the knife and fork
design, with folded napkin emblem
above, had been Inspected In the buf
fet chamber, and the appropriate
decorations In the other seven rooms
had been seen, those present adjourned
to Bohemia Hall, where the "jinks"
were held. Pipes and cigarettes were
distributed and glasses of beer placed
in circulation.
President Hoffman delivered the ad
dress of welcome, and was greeted
with cheers. "Remember that it re
quires a gentleman to take a gentle
man's order properly," was the hint
thrown out by the speaker. Continuing
he told how the association had grown
until in a year it had Increased in
membership to over 400.
Thut the waiters were not lacking
in patriotism was evidenced by a large
American flag which hung on the
walls of the room In which the "jinks"
were held, and by a toast which was
drank, standing, to "the new State,
Hawaii." John Ellis, a native Ha
waiian, responded.
The "jinks" was a creditable affair.
It consisted of piano selections, mv-
â¢AND tHÂ£Y TALKED â¢
sic by the colored L.a Estrella quartet,
songs and recitations. Count yon
Tosca. Baron, Theiknerberg and Baron
yon Taupkirchner contributed to the
entertainment.
The officers are: President, H. H.
Hoffman; vice-president, Edward
Moss; treasurer, Peter Errett, and sec
retary, J. Bauffman. The committee
on amusements consisted of Fred
Green, Peter Errett and Edward Moss.
L. Field (chairman), John M, Peel and
Dr. Gassoway; conferred with the ladles
of the Red Cross with the result that a
supper will be provided the men In re
turn for their trouble. As the soldiers
haw already tasted of the good things
furnished them by the hospitality com
mittee they will add vim to their work.
Many Interior towns have come for
ward already with offers of fruit, flow
ers and delicacies. The ladies of the lo
cal society will be assisted by representa
tives from Oakland, San Rafael, San
Jose, San Mntoo. Sausallto and Napa.
The Pavilion is beiiiK handsomely dec
orated in preparation for the event, which
promises to mark another epoch in local
history.
Music will be a pleasing feature of the
reception and the greatest enthusiasm
will be aroused by the familiar strains
heard in these exciting times.
The heavy artillery. Major Rice com
manding;; the Sixth California Infantry,
Major Grant commanding, and the
Eighth California. Infantry. Colon.-! H<n-
Bhaw commanding, have been invited to
participate. An admission of 25 cents will
be charged, or a reserved seat can be
obtained f<>r ."" rents.

A chain letter has been sent out by
Mrs. G. M. Randall of Fort Russell, Wyo.,
for the purpose of raising money for the
Red Cross Society. Mrs. Randall is the
wife of Brigadier General George M.
Randall, l r . S. A., and is wÂ«-ll and favor

SUIT AGAINST
AN ASSESSOR
Charged With Overvalu-
ing Property.
ALLEGATIONS MADEOFFRAUD
BAILEY DISSATISFIED WITH
HIS ASSESSMENT.
The Defendant Contends That the
Revenue-Producing Quality of
Property Is the Standard
Value.
A peculiar case, one of the first of the
kind ever noted in this State, In which
the Assessor of a county is sued for dam
ages for the alleged fraudulent over
assessing of a piece -of property, is now
on trial In the United States Circuit
Court in this city.
The defendant is Thomas H. Berkey,
Assessor of Sacramento County, and the
plaintiff is James Bailey, owner of the
old Postofflce. building, on the corner of
Fourth and X streets, in the city of Sac
ramento. Bailey alleges that Berkey
fraudulently over-assessed the property,
and asks for $10,000 damages. He is rep
resented by Catlin & Mhoon, and Berkey
Is defended by Elwood Bruner.
Before Berkey took office the old Post
office building had been assessed for $27,
000. The University of California has a
mortgage on it for $30,000. Berkey did not
deduct the mortgage, but placed the as
sessment against the property.
Bailey aid not pay the taxes on this
assessment, and when Sheriff and Tax
Collector Prank Johnson sought to collect
by the usual legal methods the amount
due, Bailey brought suit against Johnson
to restrain him.
Prior to making the assessment Berkey
had inquired into the revenue producing
quality of the property, and had learned
that it produced a net rental of $4500 per
annum, over and above repairs, taxes,
insurance, water rates, etc.. excepting the
interest on the mortgage. This income, It
was alleged in court, was a fair and usual
rate of â namely, upward of 7 per
cent netâ on a valuation of $00,000.
On the first Monday in" March, 1896,
Berkey assessed the property at $50,000,
which, deducting the amount of the mort
gage, left $20,000, on which Bailey was re
quired to pay taxes. Bailey appealed to
the Board of Equalization, but the. board
sustained the Assessor. Bailey then
brought the present suit, alleging that
Berkey had not only made an Incorrect
assessment, but a fraudulent one.
On behalf of the defendant letters were
produced In court from E. K. Alsip, Bai
ley's agent, and from A. D. Bowley, a
real estate agent of Sacramento. These
letters were addressed to the Board of
Regents of the University of California
at the time Ba-iley was making applica
tion for the $30,000 loan. In one of 'the
letters Alsip wrote that the "property was
producing a net income of 6 per cent on
a $75,000 valuation, and that the property
would be worth $125,000 In a few years'.
Alsip followed this letter with another.
In which he wrote that a conservative
valuation of the property would ho $65,
000 spot cash.' Mr. Bowley corroborated
this statement, and Albert Gallatin wrote
that taking its income, as a basis of value
the property was worth $60,000.
On behalf of Bailey it was alleged that
Berkey had assessed the Odd Fellows
building on the corner of Ninth. irid-K
streets, and the Farmers' and Mechanics'
Bank building on the corner of . Fourth
and I streets at a much lower figure, al
though-the bank property "was of the'
same area with a" much better building,
and the Odd Fellows' building had twenty
feet more frontage than had the old post
office property.
Mr. Bruner argued to the court and
jury that the Assessor had been and
should be guided in his estimates of val
ues by taking Into consideration the rev
enue or rental producing quality of the
property. The case will be given to the
jury this morning.

RICH YELLOW
CORPORATION
PATRIOTISM
Wells, Fargo & Co. Defy the Law
and Cinch the Helpless
Public.
They State Their Position and Tell the
People How to Bunko Poor Old
Uncle Sam.
So far as the war tax law is con
cerned there is no question in my
mind whatever that the express
company should pay the tax. The
language is plain and unmistakable
on this point with reference to news
papers in particular, and Wells,
Fargo & Co. have no reasonable
ground upon which to maintain the
stand I am informed they have now
taken. The law says they must pay
the tax. â Collector of Inle-rnal Revenue
Lynch in an interview yesterday. .
The fact has at last developed that
all the protests of the general public,
the merchants and the pi-ess against
the attitude of Wells, Fargo & Co.. in
connection with the war tax, have been
of no avail. In this matter the com
pany has acted like a school boy who
has lost a bet and proposes to avoid
payment at any cost; and the squirm
ing of the great corporation to escape
the payment of its share of the tax
which T'ncle Sam has imposed for the
maintenance of the war with a foreign
foe. if almost beyond comprehension.
It is doubly incomprehensible because
up to the time that the impost was de
clared Wells. Fargo & Co. enjoyed the
esteem of the people of the entire. Pa
cific Coast, from whom the company
has derived the wealth arid power it
no . possesses. It has up to these times
been supposed to be the one corpora
tion on this side of the continent that
could be accused ' o.f possessing a soul,
but to-day such . an. accusation would.
be entirely baseless.
Â° " The methods that are being pursued
by the company to avoid bearing its'
share of the burdens of war does not
entitle it to the credit of having
even an emaciated patriotism, for its
loyally is only to the golden Hag (the
color of Spain) which waves over the
dividend column on the fa.t-profl.ts led- j
S er - . I
To protect that pet dividend they
have not only shown their disloyalty,
but have deliberately defied the Federal.
J;.ws in the hope that the war will be
vndud before they are brought to the
judgment seat and compelled to dis
gorge. They declare that they will not
pay the tax because their lawyers tell
them to right.it an-d take their chances
In, the courts. So far as profits are con
â¢1 this is good advice, for they are
making hay but of the helpless public
in a manner worthy of a Shylock
The law says that such a common
carrier mugt issue, a bill uf lading or
receipt, stamped and canceled, and de
liver the same to the shipper. If any
jbltizen thinks this once popular cor
poration is abiding ty the plain: law,
let him, go to the office, of the company
and ship a package. He will find that
before he receives his receipt he will
be required to furnish a 1-cent stamp
or stand and surrender a copper cent.
As a merchant put it yesterday: "It
â¢ reminds one of the man who was so
.mean and grasping that he would steal :
the coppers from a dead man's eyes
and let his glassy optics stare into
space for want of the humble penny."
What makes the case so exasperating
to- the patrons of the company is the
fact that it has grown opulent through
the K*-nc-rous support of the people of
this coast. There is no doubt of this,
fact, as the history of the company
â hows'. Wells, Fargo & Co. were in
corporated with a capital stock of $500,
Â©Qi>, all of which. was finally paid. in.
â¢The earnings were so great that it was
decided to dilute the shares, and with
out any further subscriptions the capi
tal stork w;ts increased; to.. $6,000,000.
F<ir many years the profits of the com
pany paid an interest of 8 per cent.
Still the gains grew, and at last the
stock was again subjected to irrigation,;
and it now Mtands at $3,000,000; and pays
on that vast sum 6 per cent, while the
public is glad to loan hundreds of
millions to the Government at 3 per
cent.
. -Six per centum on -eight millions on]
j an investment of $500,000 and the poor
old peverty-stricken corporation can
not bring itself to the point where it
â¢" will surrender a greasy copper out of ;
trie -minimum charge to the people of
25 cents on small packages.
â¢The man who has been caught steal
â¢ ing sheep could not possibly have more
" excuses for his fault than does this
; aggregation of greed. They call- at
tention to the fact that they employ r
EOO men in this city, to whom they j
â¢ pay $3500 per month; that they have \
160 horses they feed with fodder bought j
â oh this coast; that- they are putting up
a $600,000 building in San Francisco;*
also that they own a bank that pays
$1400 per annum to .the Government as
â¢a war tax. and that, by these presents
.- they should. "be permitted .to make the
â¢ citizen who pays war taxes in. every
.other direction, bear the burden which
â¢ the law says. falls to the express com

' ' The exact position of ' th : company
was stated yesterday for the first time
by H. .W. Titus, general agent, and I*.
F. Powell, manager of the Pacific de
partment, in the course of which it was
inferentially suggested that the people
ought to be grateful to the company
for not removing its headquarters to.
New York and for the fact that 'it
bought certain supplies- here that' could
he obtained in Boston at a slightly less
txjxn^e. Furthermore, it was declared
that "Wells, Fargo & Co. would not pay
the tax unless they were compelled to
do so by the courts. With reference to
the handling ot newspapers Mr. Titus
said:
"We have decided to issue the re
ceipts to the papers, attach stamps
and cancel them, but at the end of each
week or month we will send, in a bill
and collect the amount of the tax ad
vanced by us, We do this simp-ly.as a
matter of convenience jto the publish
ers. Our attorneys advise us that we
do not have to pay the tax, and .we
stand on the proposition that, we will
not do it. Why it is preposterous. If
we paid that tax it would reduce our
dividends one half, and we would have
to pay the Government $1000 per month
in San Francisco alone. Ju.st think
what it would be with all the system
included."
ECLIPSE OF TWO FRAWLEY STARS.
Madeline Bouton, Leading Lady, and Cora Tinnie, Comedienne,
Will No Longer Appear at the Columbia.
Mr. Titus overlooked the fact that all
this immense volume of business com.es
from the people of this, coast upon
whose shoulders his corporation is
shirking the burden of tax;
"I have rnad.t- a proposition to the
newspapers.", continued the general
agent, "so it will- make the tax easy on
them. I suggested that if they would
bring down a wagon load of packages '
tied up in a tarpaulin . th.c company
would receive it as one package, and
the publisher would â  have to pay but
one cent, tax-, instead of. three or four
dollars. I have talked with Internal
Revenue Collector Lynch, 'and he says
there is nothing In the law tq prevent
this." . â¢
In other words, it was regarded by
these representatives of : the company
as entirely proper to swindle the Gov
ernment out of its just dues if thore
was any trick by which it could be
done. â¢ â¢'..'.
The Call is not conducted on such
principles and will gladly pay what
ever tax the Government may impose,
but it sees no reasons, either in equity
or charity; why it should make a pres
ent to Wells, Fargo & Co. of several
hundred dollars a month, in order, that
their sacred dividends may not be im
paired.
"Just think of what we are doing."
said Manager Rowell. "We are giv
ing employment. to 800 people; we keep
100 horses in service; our pay. roll is
$3500 per month, and now we are put
tins up a building to cost about $600,
000. The people of San Francisco
should remember that had it not. been
for the officers here the headquarters
of the company would have been re
moved to New York. Then what
would they have said? The people say
we are not patriotic, but they should
remember that, we have to put stamps
on the checks We draw for supplies,
salaries, etc., .and the checks are drawn
on our own bank, too. Of course we
are as patriotic as anybody. The fact
is, that our bank pays' the Government
$14,000 per year, and that, ought to be
considered enough. We don't see. why
there should be so much fuss about this
matter, for in the fiast the Pullman
Palace Car Company makes the public
pay the tax on their tickets and the
law says that the company shall
pay it.". . ' â¢ .".'â .<
Manager Rowell is a very pleasant
and patriarchal old gentleman and
seems -.to. suffer great mental pain over
the fact that his company is expected
to pay a war tax. He really thinks
there Is nothing unpatriotic about the
attitude of his -corporation. If he
could know that the -public regard the
responsible members of the corporation
as yellow patriots and say that if they
maintain their present un-American
policy, they will be more welcome in
Spain than here, and that the trans
ference of their allegiance to the saf
fron emblem of the Dons would be the
proper thing for them to do, possibly
he would prevail on his .directors to
change their views as to what is

Americanism.
Certain it is that they have made
more enemies than they would care to
count, and are rapidly Increasing the
list each day, all for that measly one
cent piece.
That' the company is determined to
bear no portion of the war tax im
posed upon common carriers is shown
by the remark of General Agent Titus.
"If we are compelled finally to pay
this tax," said he, "we will simply
have to charge more for our service;
but instead of advancing; the tariff 1
cent to cover the tax we will have to
make it 5 cents higher on account of
the absence of change on this coast.
So you see the public would be the
losers arid the company the gainer in
the. end. That is our position."
Internal Revenue Collector Lynch
stated to- a Call representative yester
day that it was feasible for newspaper
publishers to bunch their .small pack
ages into one large bundle and thus de
feat the objects of the law.
"So far as the war tax law Is con
cerned," said Collector Lynch, "there is
no question in my mind whatever that
the. express company should pay the
tax.. The language is plain and unmis
takable on this point with reference to
newspapers .in particular; and Wells,
Fargo & Co. have n-b reasonable ground
upon which to maintain the stand I am
informed they have now taken. The law
says they must pay the tax. So far as
ray office is concerned I have no power
to enforce the statute or to compel the
company to accept packages without
the. prepayment .of the tax. That be
longs to the courts."
United States District Attorney Foote
stated that no evidence had been pre
sented' to him showing 1 a direct viola
tion of the law and that he was waiting
for the Merchants' Association to file
papers in the suit they had threatened
to bring: .
"So. far as I am concerned," said
Mr. Foote, "I am ready to take up the
matter at any time, but it is not the
duty' of a United States District At
torney to go out and secure evidence
upon which to base an action. Further
more, I have been advised by the At
torney General to not push any suits,
but to await the result of' the case in
N'.w York. As to his construction of
the law, he leaves me entirely in doubt,
and if a suit is filed here I shall ask
for his instructions before proceeding.
At present the â only redress for the
public I cim see is in an action for
damages for extortion in the civil
courts. That might cover the case."
. Secretary Freud of the Merchants'
i Association stated yesterday that he
;: was in receipt of a- letter from the
New. York association saying the suit
against the express companies would
. be instituted this week in "real earn
| est," and that for. this reason his or
| ganization would await the arrival of
a copy of the papers in the Eastern
suit before going further.
"If the New York case does not cover

EVERY SCHOOL IN
THE CITY CROWDED
NEED FOR MORE BTJTLDINGS
AGAIN DEMONSTRATED.
Primary . and Intermediate Grades
Are in the Worst Condition,
but All Are Bad Enough.
The opening of the public schools Monday
showed the same .conditions which .have
been forced upon the pupils for some
years past but which there has been little
or no effort to remedy. The buildings v.re
totally inadequate to accommodate the
children and hundreds have to be turned
away or quartered in makeshift school
rooms in rented buildings. Not only, are
the buildings too small, but the most of
them are old and rickety, and would be of
more use as kindling wood. There are
thirty wooden' structures over twenty
yean aid. which have been patched up
from time to time to prevent their utter
collapse and these are crowded to. the
doors with children who must bear the
discomfort of stuffy atmosphere and bad
sanitary conditions or stay away from
sehool altogether.
In most cases the upper classes are well
'provided for,, but the primary grades are
in every instance so full that even stand
ing- foom cannot be furnished for the ap
plicants. President Barrington and Di
rectors Waller and Webster, with Asslst
an.t Superintendent Stone, made the
rounds of the buildings and found the
same -bad " conditions prevalent every
where, the schools in the Western Addi
tion being in the worst condition. Presi
dent Barrington says that .at least -fifty
more schoolhousea. are needed, and the
most of the antiquated wooden structures
should be torn down and substantial
buildings erected in their places.
The Dudley Stone School was .very much
overcrowded, notably in the second grade.
Many, jvere turned away from the Crocker
and Freniont schools and the Spring Val
ley, Barrington, Park Primary, Richmond
and Clement schools are all filled.
It is known that there are many chil
dren who attended last year but have not
yet returned from their summer outing,
and these will be' obliged to stay out un
til suitable rooms can be rented for tem
porary quarters. This is particularly the
case at Pacific Heights school. The lower
pr ii- is overcrowded and there are 100
children who are expected back at the
school, within the next few days.

AND FRAWLEY
DOESN'T WEAR
A CRAPE BAND
Dashing Madeline Bouton and
Cora Tinnie Are No
More
Discord in the Ranks of the Popular Com
pany Followed by Petty Strife and
Instant Dismissal.
There Is a rift within the luteâ a dis
sension in the ranks of the popular
Frawley Company. With one fell
swoop all the delightful sentiment of
a happy, united and prosperous family,
the pride and the joy of doting Papa
Frawley, is ruthlessly swept away and
the unromantic fact remains that
theatrical families are much unlike the
'"little birds who in their nests agree."
The sorrow that has come to the
theatrical company strikes at its very
head. Manager Frawley wears no
crape band round his hat, though it is
his first born â speaking from the fam
ily standpointâ that he mourns. Dash
ing, sparkling Madeline Bouton is no
moreâthis time from a theatrical
standpoint.
Monday morning the crape was put
upon the door. Upon the bare un
sightly walls that lead from the rear
ertrance to the stage was posted the
customary two weeks' notice which in
formed the Frawleys that Madeline's
services were no longer necessary to
keep up the high standard of the Co
lumbia productions.
The whole company, or rather fam-
ily, sorrowfully read the funeral notice,
with one exception â Miss Cora Tinnie.
Mi.^s Tinnie wept at her own obsequies
nearly two weeks previous, performed
at the Thursday morning rehearsal of
"A Gallant Surrender."
Miss Bouton's discharge comes at a
most unpropitious moment. â¢ .
She is lying seriously ill at the Mc-
Xutt Hospital on Sutter street, suffer
ing from a severe injury to the spine,
the direct result of the sensational re
alistic falls, with which the lady used
to heighten the effect of one of her
scenes in a recent production.
In a darkened room, with a sweet
faced nurse for her oni" companion, the
well-known actress lies tossing on a
bed of pain. No one Is allowed to see
her, as it is feared the least excite
me,nt might tend to increase her al
ready high temperature.
Dr. Winslow Anderson, who Is at
tending Miss Bouton, is authority for
the statement that it will be many
weeks before the leading lady will be
able to tread the boards again.
"Miss Bouton is a very sick girl," the
doctor said. "Her temperature 1h ex
tremely high and consequently no one
is permitted to visit her. Her illness,
an injury to the spine and inflammation
of internal organs, will probably neces
sitate an operation before the lady can
be pronounced out of danger."
As Miss Bouton cannot be seen the
matter of her dismissal Is open to much
conjecture. All sart9 of stories are
afloat, and Borne are quite as sensa
tional as was the fall that caused the
unfortunate lady's undoing.
The discord in the ranks of the Fraw
ley company causes the management no
apparent discomfort. Friedlanderj Gott
lob and Marx, in perfect unison, like
the Well-drilled chorus of a crack show,
declare that they have ne- statement to
make. With delightful, ingenuousness
Mr. Gottlob inquired how Miss Tinnie's
and Miss Bouton's engagements or lack
of engagements can be of any interest
to the public. Mr. Marx extends his
sympathy and that of the entire firm
for Miss Bouton in her illness, and, con-
Bcious that he has done a noble thing,
supplements his generous sen.timents
by expressing sincere sympathy for the
entire mundane population of sufferers.
But as to Miss Bouton's two \yeeks' no
tice and Miss Tinnie's untimely dis
missal the firm has nothing to say.
Cora Tinnie, who came from New
York to play leading comedy roles with
the Frawleys, is sorely disappointed at
the treatment she claims to have re
ceived. Miss Tinnie has no complaint
from a financial point of view, but pro
fessionally she contends- she has been
treated' shamefully. Her story is that
{â he entered Into an oral agreement
with Mr. Frawley in New York to
come here and play leading comedy
parts, but instead of being given char
acters Jn her line, she has been cast in
serious and old women's parts, wholly
uneuited to her talents and her tem
perament, and' which naturally she
could not Interpret satisfactorily. A
llttla more -than a 'week aero. Miss Tin
nle was given a new role, which filled
her artist's soul with the proper thrill.
She felt she could interpret It intelli
gently and successfully and rehearsed
it until last Thursday. Thursday
evening she was informed by the man
age;- of the company that her work
was not at all up to the regulation
Frawley standard, and the part was
taken fiorr. her and given to Miss' May
Buckle.-. Miss Tinnie claims she was
humiliated without cause or justifi-n
tion and immediately notliled Mr.
Fr.iwloy and Mr. Marx thai- she would
not submit to such treatment. Since
this incident Miss Tinnie and the Fraw
ley management have been holding
daily conferences to arrive at an
amicable adjustment of the financial
end of the affair.
The lady demands payment of salary
to the end of the season for which she
was engaged. As Miss Tlnnie's ser
vices are no longer needed by the com
pany Mr. Frawley naturally objects to
a settlement on those terms. According
to Miss Tinnie she is not the only one
of the company who has been treated
unprofessionally by Mr. Frawley, and
she cites Mr. Comber, who has also
been released.
"MAMMY" ALLEGES
A BIG CONSPIRACY
CLAIMS LUCIUS L. SOLOMONS
HAS DEFRAUDED HER.
She Was Generous, She Says, and
Then Her Confidence Was
Ruthlessly Violated.
"Mammy" Pleasant, the aped but stal
wart negress who guards the portals of
the "House of Mystery." the home of the
Bells, has more trouble which she has
carried to the courts for settlement. This
time she appears as plaint. ff in an action
against a multitude of defenuants, of
which Lucius L. Solomons is most prom
inent, to set aside deeds {o two pieces of
real estate in. this city â one on Sutter
j street, near Jones, the other on Washing
ton, near Stone.
. On February 4, 1897, alleges the aged
"Mummy," while Solomons was acting as
her counsel, she was actuated by a desire
| to be generous, and without consideration
> executed a note for $3000, winch she pre
| sented to Solomons. She requested, how
ever, â  that the note should not become
payable until after her death, but not
withstanding her request she avers that
Solomons placed the note in a commercial
bank of this" city for collection. Subse
quently she received word from the bank
that certain interest was due on the note.
She informed Solomons of the word she
had received from the bank, and asked
him how it occurred that he had violated
the trust between them. He Informed her
that he had found himself in financial dis
tress and had given the note as collateral
to Julius Kahn as security for a loan. He
stated that he had hoped to reclaim the
note prior to the fact that it had been ne
gotiated became known, but as _^ahn had
deposited It for collection his wishes had.
Dcen defeated. Later Solomons called on !
Mrs. Pleasant and Informed her that in i
; some manner Kahn had ascertained the !
conditions under which the note had j
been made and had threatened to have
ium (Solomons) arrested and disbarred
for having procured a loan an a worthless
note. By reason of these facts Solomons j
stated that he was in great need of |
money in order to redeem the note and
save himself trouble, but that if he were
to have vested in him immediately . the
apparent title to valuable real estate,
which title he might show to his creditor, J
he would be enabled to placate mm and !
tide over his dirticulties. Solomons, she
alleges, begged her to execute him a con
veyance of the real pronprtles on Sutter
and 'Washington streets, which, she says,
he promised to reconvey to her when his
clouds of trouble drifted away, and she,
"out of commiseration for said Solo
mons," trusting In his veracity, conveyed
the property.-
Ail of Solomons' .story was false, con
tinues "Mammy"' in her complaint. Solo
mons never borrowed a sum of money
from Kahn, but deposited the note for
payment himself. , Ins.tead of reconvey
fng the property he caused the deeds "to
be recorded in his own name, and then
for the purpose of further injuring and I
defrauding her executed a deed of : trust
to Harry Block and Benjamin Harris,
thereby securing the payment to Leo
Block the sum of $4000. Subsequently,
claiming that Solomons had made de
fault in the payment of the $4000 alleged
to be due, Harry Block and x>enjamin i
Harris, in the manner provided in. the \
deed of trust, sold and conveyed the prop
erty to Leo Block. A short time later
Leo Block and his wife. Bertha W. Block,
deeded the property to Thomas R. Hob- ,
son, and Hobson mortgaged the real es
tate to the Hibernia Savings and Loan ;
Societi' "Mammy" alleges that tne prop
erty is valued at $40,000. and states that by i
reason of "the conspiracy" Â«he has been j
defrauded out of It. In consequence shel
prays that the court decide that her title]
to the property Is vanu. that a receiver be i
appointed during the litigation, and thÂ».V
the defendants be restrained from further
proceeding in an endeavor to. establish
their "illegal claims."

PHILIPPINES
BY FINESSE
State Board of Trade Is
On the "Inside."
W. H. MILLS' DARK PROPHECY
THIS COAST SHOULD HAVE A PO
TENT VOICE.
Instead of Petitioning for Annexa
tion We Should Ask for
Representation on Peace
Commission.
Whereas, The future rela
tion to the Philippine Islands
to the United States may be
largely determined by the con
clusions of a commission to be
appointed by the Government
of the United States and the
Government of Spain, and that
Whereas, The people of the
Pacific Coast have a direct in
terest in "the future of the rela
tion of the Philippines with
this country, therefore
Resolved, That the Califor
nia State Board of Trade re
quest the President of the
United States to appoint a citi
zen of this coast to membership
in the commission in behalf of
the United States.
Resolved, That other com
mercial organizations be re
quested to join us. in the peti
tion for the Pacific Coast rep
resentation on said commis
sion.
This resolution by the California a aw
Board of Trade, shows that its position
with reference to the annexation of the
Philippine Islands Is materially different
from that taken by the other commercial
and industrial bodies of this city vand the
Other cities of the coast, which urged the
President of the United States to do all
In his power" to add these islands to; Uncle
Sam's territory. A special meeting of e the
board was called by the president. General
N P. Chipman. and the directors assem
bling in his rooms in the Parrott building
.ve P terday were: General Chipman J. A.
tt R Maslin : C. M. Wooster, J. M.
Mr. Mills objected to sending such a re
auefit as the others to the President. He
said in substance: '.'The great drama of
nations is to be transferred from the At
lantic to 'he Paci no Ocean, and .the g reat
eÂ»t naval battles of the world will De
fought over these islands in the waters
that wash our shores. Whether or not we
hold the Philippines will have muoh to do
"c-oVtin'uiSrne^Shat the President
of the United States will not have the
settling of these matters: A commission
composed of representatives of this * nd
the Spanish Governments will attend to
. the I final ', disposition of the Philippines,
and all , that the President will have to do
in sthe5 the premises, will be the appointment
of the American Commissioners. All f that
California can do is to urge. the President
to \ see that -this â¢: State â  is . represented on
the i commission. The situation. I? differ
ent from what it was a few days ago.
The new situation is that Agulnaldo. at
the head of twelve million savages, is
bent upon murdering all the Spanish on
the islands, and henceforth Spain and the
"United States will stand together to pre
vent the contemplated slaughter."
â¢ Colonel Irish also took a decided stand
against the annexing of any outside terri
tory, and in his remarks he handled those
Western statesmen who voted for the an
nexation of Hawaii without gloves, stat
ing that they had to tear a big hole in
the constitution of the nation in doing so.
In his usual strong, forcible language, he
dealt with the evils that he said will fol
low annexing territory where the climatic
conditions, the people arid everything dif
fer so greatly. He declared that the Cali
fornia sugar-beet farmers would have to
abandon their farms, the sugar-beet fac
tories close down and a dozen other Indus
tries cease if California is obliged to enter
into competition with the cheap labor of.
those tropic islands.
As the arguments were all one-sided the
resolution offered by Mr. Mills passed
without a disenting voice.
Favor Territorial Acquisition.
The merchants of Monterey, to the
number of 100, have sent a petition to
President McKlnley to the effect that the
conquered territory in the present war
be made subject to, and incorporated
with, the United States. This wu dene
in response to a request from the Cham
ber of Commerce of this city.
IT WILL HE A GREAT MATCH.
