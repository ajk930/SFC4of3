TOLBERT LAfS THE
BLANk ON DEMOCRATS
WASHINGTON, Nov. 11.â R. R. Tol
bert, whose father and brother were
shot in the recent rare war at Phoenix,
S. C, was at the Department of Justice
to-day to secure an investigation by the
Federal authorities. He was accom
panied by some of the Republican poli- I
ticiar.s of the State. The elder Tolbert I
is now in the State penitentiary for i
safety from popular violence.
-Mr. Tolbert says that the true facts
of the rioting have not been given. The
facts are. he Raid, as follows:
"I was nominated for Congress by
the Republicans of my district. For the |
purpose of making a contest before the
House my brother, T. P. Tolbert, agreed !
to be present at the polling place at j
Phoenix for the purpose of witnessing I
the affidavits of colored men who were j
rejected as voters because of their in- j
ability to comply with the requirements j
of the constitution.
"My brother took no part in the man
agement of the polling place, which
was in the hands of the Democrats.
He simply sat on the piazza of Mr.
Lake's house and witnessed the atn
davits given him, depositing the affi
davits in a box prepared for the pur
pose.
"Mr. Etheridge, the white man who
was killed, was an election manager at
a precinct two miles away.- "He left his
own precinct and, with a party of men.
went to Phoenix. He walked up with
his party to where my brother was
Pitting at a table and deliberately
kicked over the table and box in which
were put the certificates. Then he as
saulted my brother. In a short while
the Democratic voters who were In the
same house rushed out and commenced
shooting into the crowd. The negroes
fled. My brother, who ip probably dead
by now, told me that Etheridge was
killed by shots from his own friends.
My brother did not have a weapon on
his person. "
Mr. Tolbert said that he was at Ab
beyvilje, twenty-five miles away from
the shooting. His father, J. R. Tolb rt,
â¢was at Verdry, another precinct. "Wh>n
the elder Tolbert learned of the riot he
started to the scene in his buggy, ac
companied by a little ten-year-old
nephew. Before he reached the scene
he was met by a mob, which riddled
the buggy with bullets and wounded
him and the little boy a number of
times. It is said that the boy was
killed by the shots.
T. P. Toll Kit, who was first shot by
the mob, was aided to his home, some
distance from the scene, and was pur
sued by the mob. "While lying in bed
in a dying condition the mob attempted
to make him give the name of the per- j
eon who had killed Etheridge. He said j
he could not because Etheridge had j
been killed by the Democrats them-
Eflves.

INSURGENTS OF
PHILIPPINES YET
FIGHT THE DONS.
They Have Taken the Island
of Negros and Are Now
Besieging Iloilo.
LONDON. Nov. 11.â Advices
have been received at the office
in this city of the Philippine
Commercial Company, Haying
that the insurgents have taken
the island of Negros, one of the
Philippine group, separated by
narrow channels from Panay
and Zebu, and that they are be-*
sieging lioilo, the capital of the |
island of Panay and the second
largest port in the Philippines.
THE MEN WHOM THE PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN TO MAKE THE CITY'S LAWS
SAN FRANCISCO'S NEW BOARD OF^SUPERVISORS.
Ed R. R. Tolbert procured a doctor, who
attended to the wounds of the senior
Tolbert. After placing his family in, a
safe place Mr. Tolbert came on to this
city.
Mr. Tolbert states that his brother
said that so far as he could see rt& shots
were fired by the negroes at Phoenix.
They fled as soon as the shoqting Com
menced, leaving T. P. Tolbert as the
target for the mob to sheot at.
At a late hour this afternoon Mr. Tol
bert, accompanied by Solicitor General
Richards of the Department of Justice,
called at the White House and had an
extended interview with President Mc-
Kinley. He related to the President
the story of his experiences in South
Carolina, substantially as given in the
foregoing, entering into minute details
of the trouble on election day. The
President listened attentively to tho
recital, but gave no indication of what
action, if any, might be taken. How
ever, he requested Mr. Tolbert to see
the Attorney General and make him a
full statement of the situation as he
viewed it.
Returning to the Department of Jus
tice Mr. Tolbert had an Interview with
Attorney General Griggs, who had just
returned to the city from New Jersey.
At the conclusion of the interview the
Attorney General said he would have a
conference with the President upon the
matter as soon as possible and it would
then be determined what, if anything,
would be done.
To-night Attorney General Griggs
spent some time with the President,
but so far as could be ascertained no
decision of the question presented by
Mr. Tolbert was reached.
In addition to the effort of the De
partment of Justice to secure definite
and official information concerning
Tuesday's rioting steps have been taken
to afford ample protection to the elder
Tolbert, who is Collector of Customs
at the port of Charleston. It is said
that, as a Government officer in the
exercise of his individual rights and
In the performance of his official du
ties, the Federal Government will not
permit him to be interfered with.
PLACED IN PENITENTIARY
FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY
ATLANTA, Ga., Nov. 11.â A Journal
Bpecial frc-m Greenwood, S. C, says: I
Everything was believed to have set- j
tied into its formal state at Phoenix |
City, but to-day a telegram says word
was sent to Columbia to hold John R.
Tolbert and his son Sidney, who are in j
the penitentiary there. The dispatch j
said affidavits implicating the Tolberts
in the recent race troubles were on the
way to Columbia, and it is row believed
It is the intention to bring them h-.u k
to Phoenix. If this la done it is feared
further trouble will result, although j
leading citizens are deprecating any '
further violence.
The Tolberts escaped to Columbia two '
days sgo, and after having their j
vÂ«ounds dressed were placed in the pen- !
itentiary as a precautionary measure.
FIRM OFFICIALS
PREVENT LYNCHINGS
WILMINGTON, N. C, Nov. 11.â This |
disturbed and lons-perturbed commu- '
nity seems at last to be entering upon i
an era of peace and order. The com- {
plete change in the municipal govern- j
ment effected last night with some (
suddenness, but with great unanimity, ;
has placed men in control of local af
fairs representing the best elements r,-f
the 'city. The firm hand of the law is
being laid upon the town and la hold
ing in restraint all classes which might
threaten disorder. The lirst act of the
new government was to swear in 250
special policemen. <'<><>l-headed men
were selected for these posts and werA;
instructed to prevent any attempts to j
terrorize the negroes, as well as to- frus. j
trate acts of lawlessness by the latter. !
Good government was put to a test j
yesterday and the new officials were
called upon almost before they had
taken their seats to make good their
promises to preserve order. A big !
lynching party was planned for the ;
night and it took all that the Mayor j
and his assistants could do to pre
vent it.
The negroes were in jail who had

SAX FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1898.
ANDREW CARNEGIE, THE
CELEBRATED IRON KING,
IS TO BE ARRESTED
Warrant Issued Because the Millionaire Manu
facturer Ignored a Summons to flppear
and Qualify as a Juror.
istW YORK, Nov. 11. â Justice Lawrence in the Supreme Court
to-day issued an order directing the Sheriff to arrest Andrew Car
negie, the millionaire iron and steel manufacturer.
The application for Mr. Carnegie's arrest was made by Assist
ant Corporation Counsel George H. Cowie, who appeared in behalf
of Henry Winthrop Gray, special Commissioner of Jurors.
Mr. Carnegie was served with a notice by Commissioner Gray
on November 1 to appear before him on November 10 to testify as to
his qualifications to act as a special juror. Mr. Carnegie did not
present himself, and Corporation Counsel Whalen directed a motion
to be made for his arrest. The warrant was placed in the hands of
Sheriff Dunn, and will be executed as soon as possible.
been arrested during the excitement of
the day, and some persons of the town
thought they should be summarily dis
patched. One was a prominent leader,
Thomas Miller, who was charged with
declaring that he would wash his hands
in a white man's blood before night.
Another was A. R. Bryant, charged
with being a dangerous character. The
others were less prominent, but had all
been under the ban of the whites IÂ«/r
conduct calculated to incite trouble.
Mayor Vv'addell and his associates put
a v?to upon the proposed lynching.
They said that good government was to
prevail in Wilmington from this time
and would commence immediately. The
would-be lynchera were so insistent
that the Mayor called out a guard and
kept the jail surrounded all night. This
morning" the six negroes were taken out
and escorted to the north-bound train
by a detachment of militia, to be ban
ished from the city. The citizens
cheered as they saw them going, for
they considered their departure condu
cive to peace in the future.
The men -were started for Richmond.
This is but the beginning of a general
movement to rid the town of the turbu
lent negro leaders. It is not proposed
to use violence, but to send them awaÂ»
with Instructions not to return. Squads
of men are out to-day searching for the
most notorious character^ and they will
be deported as soon as they are found.
Last night the white Republican Dep
uty Sheriff, G. Z. French, left the city.
He was followed to the train and nav
rowly escaped violence. A party of men
we"nt into the car, determined to take
him out. The arrival of Fred Stead
man, who is one of the most conserva
tive and cool-headed men in town,
while being at the fame time a leader
in the movement Cor white supremacy,
frustrated the attempt. He was joined
by two other citizens, and the three
persuaded the crowd to let French go.
French was prominent in Republican
politics and has been charged with" or
ganizing the negroos.
Several \Â£hite men of the community,
who have .become obnoxious from their
leadership of and association with ne-
Km politicians,, are also to be deported.
Notice was served upon three of them
this morning to leave within twelve
hours. They are ex-Chief of Police Mel
ton, Charles Gilbert and R. H. Bunt
ing. On Market street two pictures are
displayed from the branch of a tree.
One is labeled, "R. H. Bunting, white";
the other, a picture of a negro woman,
is marked, "Mrs. R. H. Bunting, col
ored." The three men have signified
their willingness to go.
"JUSTICE IS SATISFIED,
VENGEANCE IS CRUEL"
WASHINGTON, Nov. 11.â A special
to the Post from Wilmington, N. C,
says: This city is remarkably quiet to
night, the turmoil and terrible race
conflict considered. The military is do
ing police duty at the request of the
city authorities, although no martial
law has been proclaimed. There are
five companies on duty.
Mayor Waddell issued the following
proclamation to-night:
The comparatively few persona in this
city who seem disposed to abuse the op
portunity of carrying arms, which recent
events afforded, and who are doing some
very foolish talking, are hereby notified
that no further turbulence or disorderly
conduct will be tolerated. They are no
till- 1 1 that a regular police force will pre
serve order, and every peaceable citizen,
black and white, will be protected in ins
person and property. No armed patrol
except those authorized by the Chief ol
Police will appear on the streets. Justice
is satisfied, vÂ»-nyeance is cruel ami ;ic
cursod. A. W. WADDELL, Mayor.
Later the Mayor called a meeting of
the new Board of Aldermen. The pur
pose of iii> meeting was to devise ways
and means to suppress lawlessness and
stop "red shirts," "rounders" and se
cret committi es, who stem bent tipofa
forcing "objectionable citizens" to leave
the city, and the proclamation given
above is the outcome of the meeting.
The negroes are thoroughly terror
ized. Hundreds of them have left the
city, fleeing through the country in all
directions to-night. W. E. Henderson,
the most prominent negro lawyer here,
asked for a military escort to the At- I
lantic coast line station for himself and j
family. It is believed the race war is
about owr. Nobody has been shot to
day and none of the wounded- has
died.
WILMINGTON, N. C, Nov. 11.â The j
number of negroes kne-wn to have been j
killed in the fight Thursday is six. Nine j
negroes and three white men were
wounded. Only one of the white men,
William Mayo, if seriously hurt. Four;
of the negro* are mortally wounded, j
'i hi ) are tn ihe i !ity Eiospital.
The negroes \vh.Â» werfc kiileti are at [
an undertaking establishment and the
bodies were Vietved ty-day by largo
crowds of people. At 10 o'clock to
morrow the Coro%er*s inquest will be i
held: The Coroner i.^ a nepio. This;
fact, perhaps, together with the im- j
possibility of getting witnesses, pre
vented the Inquest being held to-day.
LAWLESS ACTS OF
NEGROES AT PANA
PANA, 111., Nov. 11.â The imported
non-union negro miners here are be
coming reckless and the union white
miners are growing restless. Troop B
of Bloomington remains on duty here,
but almost nightly, in the Flathall
district, the negro residents practice
shooting at any white man that passes
through. The negroes have been heav
ily armed by the mine operators. Last
night the residences of several white
miners were shot into by Winchesters
in the hands of the colored men. A
white widow's cottage was pierced re
peatedly by bullets, several charges
barely missing her three children.
The militia say they cannot appre
hend the culprits. Captain T. P. But
ler, in command, is apparently acting
entirely under orders of Sheriff Coburn
and is not following the instructions of
Governor Tanner given before election.
Captain Butler, when asked to disarm
the negroes, said it was useless, as the
Sheriff would arm them again. It is re
ported that a large contingent of out
side union white miners will soon ar
rive in Pan a.
A consignment of 100 rifles was re
ceived here to-day for citizens who in
tend protecting their property and fam
ilies. They claim that no protection is
given them by the Sheriff or troops.
PRESIDENT FOSTER'S
SUCCESSFUL COUP
Prevents the Absorption of the Dona
hue Line by the Worth Pacific
Coast Company.
SAN RAFAEL, Nov. 11.â When Presi
dent A. \V. Foster and his .associates
leased the entire stork of- the San .Fran
cisco anil North Pacific Railroad 'to the
California Northwestern Railway Com
! iiany for twenty years and made Gilbert
; Palache general manager, it was not lons
â  until financiers became aware pi the fact
! that by a weil-piÃiJii 'l stratagem j..r.
Fester bad avoided the threatened con
solidation which next January would have
j given the stockholders or the North Pa
cific Coast control of the Donahue lint-.
I The success or tins move is â¢;.',. apparent,
for .the I â â â :''â â  ' "â !â :>â â . â I ' have,' tis
urativcly speaking," "On-own up. v,â 
sponge."
On Wednesday evening the entire stock
of the Smith-Horel. syndicate was trans
: ferred 'to Mr. Footer and his associates.
Thirty-seven thousand and hundre I
â  shares changed hands. The price naid was
I $20 a shareâ cents less than that given
I at the boom sale of 1893â aggregating tne
! sum of $750,000.
By this deal Foster, Palache and their
! associates gain complete control of every
: share of the capital stock in the broad
gauge line, which insures an end of tne
: costly litigation that has brought the af
| fairs of the road so prominently before
i the public and for a long time has pre
i vented the company extending ita lines
into new territory.
The trouble began when Sidney V.
Smith broke with Foster and refused to
adhere to an agreement entered into in
( 1593, after 42.000 shares of stock were
bought by Smith Foster and Andrew
Markham. Then A. Borel and other nar
; row-gauge stockholders bought xH uuJ
i shares of stock from the Seligmans of
I New York, which would have given them
complete control of the line at the elec
, tion to be held in January next. The in
tention, after consolidating the lines, was
to discontinue the Tiburon branch lor
passenger service and have a single ferry
system at Sausallto. The leasing proposi
tion settled this plan, and the late sale
settles everything. i
-It Is asserted by Mr. Foster that a^soon
as possible the contemplated extension
from I'klah north to Eureka will be made
a reality. It is rumored that Mr. Foster
; will soon succeed Mr. Palache as presi
' dent of the new company.
COMPLIMENTARY BANQUET
GIVEN GENERAL MILES
In the Course of a Speech He Says
the Narrow Limits Are Be
ing Outgrown.
NEW YORK, Nov. 11.â The complimen
tary banquet given to Major General
Miles, commanding the United States
Army, at the Waldorf-Astoria to-night, in
point of numbers, extensive preparations
and brilliancy rivaled the gTeat banquet
given last year in honor of President Mc-
Kinley by the merchants and manufac
turers of the country. TTie leading per
sons, military, naval and business men
were represented, 700 being present. All
of the second floor of the Astoria portion
of the hotel was utilized for the dinner.
The grand banquet hall was too small,
and small tables were set in the adjoining
rooms. The banquet hall itself was a
marvel of beauty.
In concluding a speech General Miles
said:
We are ascending to a clearer atmosphera,
up to a higher mesa, where we should take a
stronger position than ever before occupied
by our Government and people. We cannot
longer confine ourselves ta the narrow limits
that governed us in the past. Much has been
said of what has been the ruling policy of the
people. This much, I think, is apparent to
all: That the grave responsibilities of the
nation are too great to be contaminated by
personal, partisan or sectional interests. Our
interests are national in the highest degree.
They embrace two hemispheres. They involve
the welfare of a hundred millions of the hu
man race. We are getting to that time when
we will require not only the ablest men, but
many of them in every department, to pro
tect and administer the affairs of the nation.
HUNTINGTON PLANS

CERTAIN RECORDS SENT FOR
BIGHT OF PHILIPPINE DISCUS
SION NOW THE ISSUE,
Madrid Newspapers Assert That the
Government Will Not Yield
Its Sovereignty- Over
the Archipelago.
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
PARIS, Nov. 11. â It is now generally
understood that the joint session of the
Peace Commissions which was ar
ranged for Saturday will be postponed
until Monday next.
At the joint session of "Wednesday
last it was agreed that the session fixed
for Saturday might be postponed until
Monday if the Spanish Commissioners
found themselves unable to prepare a
reply for presentation on Saturday, and
it now appears the Spaniards found it
necessary to send to Madrid for cer
tain records which cannot reach Paris
before 10 o'clock on Sunday morning,
and therefore their proper embodiment
into the Spanish memorandum cannot
be accomplished before Monday.
The next answer from the Spanish
Commissioners will deal with the right
of either to discuss the question of
Spanish sovereignty over the Philip
pines and with the American conten
tion that the retention of public
moneys and customs coilections at Ma
nila is justified by the fact of the mili
tary occupation of the place by the
American forces and warranted by thÂ«
protocol even if faulty, as claimed by
Spain because such action commenced
after the suspension of hostilities.
There is no truth in the statement
printed here this morning that the
Spaniards have decided to refuse en
tirely at the next session to discuss the
cession of the Philippine Islands.
Judge Day, president of the Ameri
can Commission, is suffering from a'
cold and had a slight chill last night.
Therefore, by his physician's advice, he
is resting quietly to-day. The Judge's
indisposition is in the nature of an at
tack of the grippe, from which all the
Commissioners have suffered more or
less, but he expects to be able to at
tend to business to-morrow.
MA>DRIB, Nov. 11.â The newspapers
assert that the Government of Spain
Is sending instructions to its commis
sioners at Paris not to yield on the
question of Spanish sovereignty over
the Philippine Islands which is asserted
to be entirely outside of the protocol,
wherefore the Commissioners are not
authorized to discuss it. It is further
asserted that the Spanish Government
will declare that it has not been au
thorized by the Cortes to negotiate the
cession of the Philippine Islands.
The Liberal advises the Spanish
Peace Commissioners to leave Paris
after lodging a protest against the de
mands of the Americans.
The Spanish newspapers are angry
at the Marquis of Salisbury, whose
speech at the Guildhall banquet on
Wednesday night they declare to have
been merely a glorification of brute
strength and a denial of the rights of
the weaker.
The Heraldo asserts that the Govern
ment has resolved to maintain Spain's
sovereignty over the Philippines. It
has been suggested also that Emperor
William be asked to arbitrate in the
event of the Peace Commission failing
to agree.
The Queen Regent presided at the
Cabinet Council v?ld to-day. Premier
Sagasta read a letter from Senor Rios,
president of the Spanish Peace Com
mission, announcing that the American
Peace Commissioners had refused to
recognize the Cuban debt and had ex
acted the Philippine Islands. The Cabi
net Council will meet again this even
ing and decide upon a reply.

Special Dlspati-h to The Call.
NASSAU, Nov. 11. â Wreckers have
ht ashore stores from the strand
.l vessel off Cat Island which estab
lish beyond doubt that she is the In
. Maria Teresa. As the vessel is
â¢i upon as being- a derelict tbv.
wrepkers claim the right to seize all th.
stores which can be saved. They re
port that the water is up to her be
ks; that she has a list to
ard, which side is damasred, am
that she is dismantled. The Vessel U< S ,
betwen two reefs, on a smooth bottom,
and has her anchor out.
The British Admiralty authorities
here are going to take possession of the
Maria Teresa as a derelict. The Ami r
ican Consul has protested against this
course, claiming everything less tho
salvage.
The steamer Antilla is leaving here
for Cat Island with customs officers
and i olice aboard.
Opinions differ as to the chance of
saving the cruiser. Although she has
aground since Thursday ' the
Maria Teresa rests in an easy position
and the weather is moderate.
NEW YORK, Nov. 11.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald Bays: Secre
tary Hay could not be seen to-nie:h
:rning the report from Nassa
that the British authorities will tak
i- Maria Teresa, ashor
at Island, and that our Consu
had protested. If such informa
tion )i;is (omo to Secretary Hay it ha
pressed, as a dispatch froi
consul McLain at Nassau, given ou
at the State Department this tv.-nincr
mad*.- no reference to any difficult
with the British authorities con.-ernin
the w recked ship.
Subordinate officers with whom
talked, while anticipating that Ba
hama fishermen will make a claim fo
salvage, do not look for any difficult
with the British authorities over th
legal status of the wrecked vessel. The
der that, the title of tbe United
States to the vessel is unimpaired, not
withstanding she was temporarily
abandoned. Furthermore, they are con
I that Great Britain, on accoun
of the friendly relations now existin
between the two countries, will waiv
any technical claims against the v
and allow her to proceed to the Unite
States, with the understanding that th
rs could later present their claim
through diplomatic channels to thi
rnment.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 11.â The Nay
-it has decided that a court 0
inquiry shall be held to determin
w hether the abandonment of the Ter
was j-i.-tifiable. and, if not
who was responsible. The detail for th
â¢ has not yet been announced, no
has the court been formally appointed
for it cannot take the testimony neces
sary to elicit the facts until the wreck
bo have gone to Cat Island return
with an account of the conditions they
found on board the Teresa. The report
that the water in the hull was up be- i
ks, taken In connection with i
the fact that the vessel was rolling'
when abandoned, ! s believed to make
very favorable case for the peo
1 the Teresa, unless it is
shown that this volume of water was
ted through injuries sustained on i
the coral reef after the vessel was ;
abandc-ned.

WASHINGTON, Nov. ll.â At the
Cabinet meeting to-day there was a
prolonged discussion of the sanitary
conditions at Havana, largely brought
out by a dispatch -which was read an
nouncing two yellow feÂ»er deaths In
the regular army. The fever situation
at Havana Is conceded to be very b< ri
ous and the administration is cognizant
of the necessity of a thorough sanitary
overhauling of the city before its oc
cupation by our troops is safe. Else
where than Havana there Is also.:
for assistance of this Government along
lines, and it is asserted that a
chartered steamer of the Government
will soon be dispatched to the island
laden with supplies, Including food. The
report made on the discouraging con
ditions at Havana was of a general na
ture, but it showed that an Immense
amount of work in cleaning up the city
will be necessary.

SAN JUAN DB PORTO RICO, Aup. 11.
The Spanish steamer Isle <\>t Panay,
from Cadiz, arriv. d here to-day with 292
Cuban political prisoners on board bound
for Havana. The prisoners left the Af

few sick men among. The Isle de Panay
is due to arrive at Havana November 15.
The Spanish Government is paying ttv

complain of the presence of the guard of
soldiers, declaring they are now free men.
They admit, however, that they have not
been ill treated on board the steamer.

ST. PAUL, Minn.. Nov. 11.â The two
most prominent ideas in this, the opening
day of the annual convention of the Na
tional Woman's Christian Temperance
Union, have been reverence for the mem
ory of the departed leader, Miss Willard,
and a reviving of the spirit and history of
the original crusaders of 1574. It is the
anniversary of the latter, and this con

the first coming together of the temper
ance women in national convention since
the death of Miss Frances Willard. v
life and work Were synonymous with the
union. Most of the day was devoted to
paying tributes of re.spect and love to the
"promoted ones" of the W. C. T. 1., a

noon. This evening was the occasion for
the formal welcome of the delegates.

CROKER COMING TO
THE GOLDEN STATE
The Tamroany Chief Will Mal^e a
Tour of the Pacific Coast
and Mexica
NEW YORK, Nov. 11.â Richard Croker will leave the city in a
day or two for California, where he hopes to regain some of the
strength expended in the recent struggle for political supremacy in
this State. The details of the trip, which comprehends a tour of the
Pacific States occupying several months, have been arranged by
Chauncey Depew, which accounts for the mysterious conferences of
the past day or two which have so alarmed the politicians. Croker
and party, which will be a large one, will travel in a special car
and take life easy. It is said a tour of old Mexico is also on tap.
The return will be made in time for Croker to sail for London be
fore the opening of the racing season In England. Croker admitted
this afternoon that he was to take a long trip, but refused to say
where he was going, on the ground that he was going for rest, which
he wouldn't get if the itinerary were published.
GOOD MAJORITY
IN THE HOUSE
Republicans Will Have
Full Control.
LATE COUNT SHOWS GAINS
OPPOSITION IN MINORITY BY
THIRTEEN VOTES.
Belief That It Will Be Necessary to
Hold an Extraordinary Session
of Congress Next
Spring.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 11.â "We have
received confirmatory Information from
every district in the United States."
said Chairman Babcock of the Repub
lican Congressional Committee to-day.
"This shows that the Republicans will
c rtalnly have thirteen majority and
I â  rhaps more than that over the com
bined opposition in the next House.
Any changes which subsequent re
turns may make will be in the direc
tion of increasing our majority. The
straight out Republican strength
shown will be 155."
Representative Cochran was at Re
publican headquarters to-day. On the
face of the returns so far received he
has beta defeated for re-election by
fourteen votes, but Mr. Cochran claims
that the votes of the soldiers of his dis
trict, now at Camp Meade, will give
him a majority and show that he is
elected. The Republicans are counting
this aa a strong probability, in which
case they would have fifteen majority
in the House.
Word has been received at headquar
ters that in the Second California and
the Twelfth Texas districts, which were
considered doubtful, the Democratic
nominees have been elected. Chairman
Babcock has received information in
dicating that the Republican nominees
in the Tenth Kentucky. Ninth Carolina
and Ninth Virginia will contest the
election of their Democratic opponents
and that George H. Higgins, the Re
publican nominee in the Twenty-sixth
Pi ansylvania, will demand a recount <>f
the official vote, which gave â¢ the
election to A. Gaston, Democratic can
didate.
It is not regarded as possible for all
qu< Btlona that are crowding for set
tlement to be disposed of during the
Bhort session of Congress, and it is al
most a certainty that the Fifty-sixth
Congress will be called into extra ses
sion next spring. The Republicans will
then have a large enough majority in
the Senate to insure the carrying out
of the policy of the administration in
spite of the possibility of two or three
Republican Senators not being in sym
pathy with It, and the Republican ma
jority in the House is strong enough
;ible the enactment of legislation
desired.
If a treaty of peace with Spain be
presented to the Senate during its com
ing Session it will be with confidence
<>:i the part of the administration of its
ratification; but it is by no means cer
tain the treaty will be prepared in time
for action by the present Senate. The
belief is that the ratification of the
treaty and practically all legislation
rendered necessary in consequence of
the acquisition of territory by the
United States will go over to the extra
session of the Fifty-sixth Congress,
most of the time of the coming session
of this Congress to be taken up with
appropriations and routine matters.
On account of the instability of Re
publican control of the Senate this ses
sion it is doubtful whether even legls
lati'>n affecting a. permanent increase
of the army will be accomplished, if, in
<]' !, it is attempted. The administra
tion does not expect difficulty in the
next House of Representatives on ac
count of the reduced majority, since the
B in the campaign just closed were
sharply defined and there Is no oppor
tunity for the existence of an anti-ad
ministration faction in the Republican
party in the House.
TERRIFIC EXPLOSION
DURING A CONFLAGRATION
', Four Volunteer Fire Fighters Killed
While Attempting to Save
a Building.
HANOVER, Mass., Nov. 11.â i<'ire in the
general store of C. A. Steams to-day was
followed by a terrific explosion, which
blew out the sides of the building, killing
four men. Following is a list of the dead:
Michael Robert Sylvester.
Edgar Adams.
C. A. Peterson.
C. A. Tolman.
Over a dozen were injured, among them
C. A. Steams, the proprietor <>f the store,
who had one arm and a leg broken, while
his shoulder is also crushed and his body
badly burned.
There being no fire department in the
town, the inhabitants turned out in an
attempt to save the building, while assist
ance was asked for from Roekland. The
volunteer tire fighters had been at work
about a half hour when a ternric explo
sion occurred. The roof was lifted from
the building and fell among the mpn who
were fighting the flames. Three of them
were dead when taken from the ruins
and another died before he could be car
ried to his home.
The explosion, it is thought, was caused
by powder and kerosene, which were
stored in the cellar.
Surprise Caused Her Death.
LAN'SIXG, Mich., Nov. 11.â Private
Robert Thorburn ot Company F, Thirty
first Michigan Volunteers, came home to
day on furlough, unannounced, thinking
to give his mother a surprise. "When he
rang the doorbell of his home the sum
moiu was answered by his mother in
person, and she was so overcome at see
ing him that she tank to the floor and in a
moment was dead. She was afllicted with
a weak heart.
BLAMES NO ONE
FOR THE DISASTER
Verdict of the Coroner's Jury in the
Case of the Steamer J. D.'
Peters' Victims.
SAN RAFAEL, Nov. 11.â Coroner Eden
held an Inquest to-day over the remains
of the six Chinese discovered in the hold
of the Stockton steamer J. D. Peters,
which was sunk in collision with the
steam collier Czarina on the evening of
November 2. None of the officers of the
tatter steamer were present and all the
testimony given as regards the circum
stances of the accident was furnished by
the officers of the Peters.
McNeill, the pilot,' became nettled when
Coroner Eden questioned him closely re
garding the signals given and the lights
on the boats. He asserted that he blew
two whistles and was answered by one,
which meant for the Peters to go to star
board. Again he blew two whistles and
was answered by one. He said he could
not change his signals or it would have
resulted in running the Czarina upon the
island. He claimed that the Czarina
steamed away after the accident and did
not proffer any assistance, â  although the
whistle on the Peters was kept going as
long as there was any steam. He said
he caw the sidelights burning on the
Czarina.
The Jury brought in a verdict immedi
ately stating that the Chinese came to
their death By accidental drowning while
the steamers were in collision on the even
ing of November 2. Nobody was criticized,
and it was clear that the jury believed
the deaths to have resulted from purely
accidental causes.
BENJAMIN HATHAWAY'S
STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE
Triends of the San Franciscan Fear
That He Committed Suicide
at Portland.
PORTLAND, Or.. Nov. 11.â Benjamin B.
Hathaway, sixty years of ago, who had
temporarily with friends on Wash
ington street, near Twentieth, has been
missing since last Tuesday.
Mr. Hathaway came from San Fran
cisco with his wife a month ago for his
I ealth. He was progressing so well that
Mr?. Hathaway returned to San Francisco
last Friday. <>n Monday Mr. Hathaway
c tmplained of a severe headache, and that
night he requested some one in the house
up with him, as lie feared he would
commit a rash act. The following- morn
ing he I qdlte rational, and at 10
o'clock went down town. Since then ho
has not been seen, lie U-ft his gold watch
and a purse containing $12u in his room.
His friends fear that in a moment of tem
porary aberration be committed BUicide
by drowning in tho river.
The missing man had resided in Cali
fornla since 1862 and made several large
fortunes in mining stock and realty spec
ulations. While he was unfortunate in
his ventures in late years he yet had a
fair competency for himself and wife.
During the great Nevada mining stock
boom he insured his life for $50,000, and as
he was a very methodical man it is not
! elieved that he allowed those policies to
lapse.
ELECTIONS IN DOUBT.
Many Results in Kansas Depend on
the Soldier Vote.
TOPEKA, Kans.. Nov. 11.â In a great
many counties of this State it will re
tuiiru the official count and the soldiers'
vote to decide the result on some of the
county officers. For instance, in Leav
t n worth County F. B. Dawes received a
majority of one for member of the Leg
islature. In Franklin County Peter
Kaiser, Republican candidate for Pro
bat.s Judge, received a majority of three.
Miss Mabel Martin, the Populist camli
i.ir County Superintendent in Sa
line County, received a majority of four.
All of these counties have a company or
part of. a company with the Twentieth
Kansas Regiment, now on the Pacific
Ocean, and the vote of these soldiers
may make a considerable change when
received. There are numerous instances
in other counties where the result hangs
on a few votes in either the Twentieth or
Twenty-third regiments.
HARBORED A MURDERER.
Awful Crime of an Outcast Who Had.
Been Befriended.
LONDON, Nov. 11.â A homeless Pole
named Schneider, who was given a night's
lodging in a North London bakehouse,
murdered the baker's assistant, throwing
him in the oven. The baker, alarmed by
the stench of the burning body, descended

murder him also, clubbing him on the
head and stabbing- him in the chest. The
shrieks of the baker brought the police
and Schneider was overpowered. The
bakehouse was splashed with blood and
strewn with tufts of hair. The charred
body of the baiter's assistant was found
in the oven. His skull had been smashed
with a hatchet.

DIXON DEFEATS
DAVE SULLIVAN
Blunder of the Irish
Lad's Brother.
"JACK" STOPS THE CONTEST
KEEPS oHIS MAN DOWN OVER
TEN SECONDS.
However, Had the Mill Gone the Full
Number of Rounds the Colored
Boy Would Have
Won.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LENOX ATHLETIC CLUB, NEW
YORK, Nov. 11.â Through the un
looked-for impulsiveness and stupidity
of his brother "Jack," Dave Sullivan,
the little Irish pugilist, lost the bout
with George Dixon, the colored feather
weight champion, to-night at the Lenox
Athletic Club. The lads were matched
to go twenty-five rounds at 122 pounds
and for nine rounds Dixon had the call.
He was Sullivan's master in nearly
every instance, and in the tenth round
ho more than out-pointed his adver
sary. A left-hand hook from Dixon,
which caught Sullivan on the head, al
most put Dave out of business, but he
pulled himself together, only to go to
the floor near the ropes from a push.
This occurred very near the end of the
round and "Jack" Sullivan evidently
thought that time was up. While Dave
was trying to regain his feet "Jack"
jumped through the ropes and then ran
back again.
A moment later, just as Dave stood
erect, Jack jumped into the ring again
and ran over to the referee shouting
"Time is up. Time is up." Jimmy Col
ville of Boston, who was referee, looked
at the impulsive youngster in amaze
ment and then spoke to the time
keeper, who said "Two-forty only," and
then Colvflle waved his hands so as to
tell every one that the bout was over.
Sulli\fan could not understand what
was up, as Dixon made no effort to go
at him, and then the whole thing
flashed upon him. He appealed to the
referee to continue, but Colville's hands
were tied under the rules and he had
no alternative.
This sudden termination of the fight
was a sad disappointment to the spec
tators, as Sullivan was not beaten
when the fiasco occurred, and would
undoubtedly have ' gone on for several
rounds; but Dixon had such an ad
vantage at the time that there is no
question that he would have received
the decision if the bout had gono the
limit.
Dixon was not so fast as of yore, but
was equally as clever, and at no time
during the contest did Sullivan h#ive
the upper hand.
Since the Maher-Sharkey fight the
Lenox Athletic Club has never hcJi
such a large number of spectators as

DISCOVERY NEAR KETCHIKAN
EXTENSIVE OUTCROPFINGS OF
FREE GOLD.
"With a Hammer and Small Mortars
They Take Out Over Three
Thousand Dollars in
a Week.
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
JUXEAU, Alaska, Nov. 3. â An almost
incredibly rich quartz strike was
recently made and is now being mined
near Ketchikan, over two hundred
miles south of Juneau. It is located on
Cleveland ppninsula of the mainland.
The claim was staked and is owned by
a man named Johnson, who lives at
Ketchikan, and Dyer, a young man of
Seattle, who has been prospecting in
the vicinity for some months. If the
rock continues to produce gold as it
has begun Johnson and Dyer have not
only the richest mine in Alaska, but a
fabulous fortune which nothing can ex
haust unless they shovel the gold into
the sea as fast as it is pounded out.
It is located ciose to salt water and in
a position easy to work. The authority
for the facts is no less a person than
Hon. A. P. Swineford, who was Gov
ernor of Alask- under Cleveland's first
administration. Ex-Governor Swine
ford lias within the last few months re
turned to Alaska from Marquette,
Mich., and made his residence here. He
Js interested in mining property in the
vicinity of Kc-tchikan and elsewhere in
Alaska. .Ex-Governor Swineford has
recently returned from Ketchikan. He
said:
"I never saw anything like that vein.
After <n\e week's work with an arastra

Previous to this Dyer wanted to go to
le. lie didn't have enough money
to buy a ticket and so he and Johnson
went over to the claim, just recently
try to pound out enough free
to pay his fare. Up to that time
did not know what the;. had.
Alter they had knocked a few hundred
pounds off the outcropping they came
to rock on which the free gold stood
out ;n spots as thick and big as perspi
ration on a man's brow. They began
to pound it out with hammers in small
mortars and the result in free gold was
tonishing and promising that they
kept up the good work for more than
a week. When they did quit they had
in g-old.
â¢ The formation is peculiar," con
tinued the ex-Governor. "The gold is '
not in the quartz vein, but in a sort
of schist alongside. So far as I know
it is unlike anything that has ever been
found in Alaska. The boys are now

LOSES A PRETTY FIANCEE
The Wealthy Youog Lady to WJ)om He Was

hjis Dismissal.
DENVER, Nov. 11 âRev. Dr. J. C. Mclntyre, the dismissed navy chaplain, is suffering from another
blow if gossip here says true. He has not only lost his place in the navy and in a certain sense his honer,
but he has also lost one of the prettiest girls in New York. This young lady, it is said, was soon to be
come the wife of the minister, but cs soon as he was found guilty by the naval court-martial that tried
him his fair fiancee canceled the engagement and sailed away to Paris, where she is now said to be consoling
herself with new scenes.
Dr Mclntyre, BO the story goes, met the young woman in Washington society. Her social position is
excellent and she is independently rich and in her own right. Friends of the chaplain positively refuse
to give out the name of the young lady. But it is said that she resides in one of New York's most
fashionable quarters and that her relatives in Washington are of very high standing.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MINNEAPOLIS, Nov. 11.â A Moor
head (Minn.) special to the Journal
says: Six of the men engaged in the
hold-up of the Great Northern coast
train near Fergus Falls were captured
here this morning by Chief of Police
Murphy. Four of them arrived at the
Exchange Hotel together and two
others came about an hour later and
inquired for the first four. Each man
had two large revolvers. Two sets of
burglar tools and two dark lanterns, to
gether with three sticks of dynamite
and four dynamite caps were found on
them. Each man had three handker
chiefs, and the six had about $200 in
, coin. They gave their names as W. C.
Ross, G. C. Hall, C. F. Huffman, B. L.
Minot, M. Morris and J. B. Edwards.
I No one of them is more than 30 years
'â  old All are bright and intelligent in
; appearance. Three claim to come from
1 Missouri.
â¢ There seems no doubt that they are
the men implicated and that they had
agreed to rendezvous at Moorhead. A
number of other robberies, including
that of an elevator at Evansville and a
bank at Battle Lake, are now credited
to this gang.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Nov. 11.â A Fergus
Falls (Minn.) special to the Dispatch
, says: During last night's hold-up Ex
; pressman McGrath, the messenger and
fireman, were compelled to sit in a row
' on the bank under cover of menacing
guns while the highwaymen were at
! work. While attempts to* blow up the
! large safe were in progress Conductor
i Smith sent Brakeman Otto Norsman
| back to flag any approaching trains.
I The robbers fired at him and a bullet
I passed under his arm. cutting the flesh,
, but not inflicting a dangerous wound.
i Norsman was later picked up by a
handcar and taken to Carlisle.
One of the robbers proposed to rob
] the passengers, but the others refused
] to go into the cars, as several men had
taken the alarm and were prepared to
resist. '. _, .
Frank Allen came down from Roths
Bay to-day and reported that the de
pot safe at that place was dragged into
the middle of the floor about midnight,
but that the would-be robbers were
frightened away. The attempt to rob
the bank at Battle Lake and th" rob
bery of the elevator agent at Evans
ville during the past week were evi
dently the work of the snme gang.
The Great Northern Express Com.
Dany to-day offered a reward of $5"00
for the arrest and conviction of the
bandits. The agents say the Express
| Company's loss was very small, the
safe not containing money.
ENGLISH COMMENT ON
TUESDAY'S ELECTION
London Weekly Papers Rsgret That
the Republican Majority Wa3
Not Larger.
London. Nov. U.â The weekly papers,
while they sp<Â» in Tuesday's election im
proved prospects "f currency legislation,
regret that the Republican success was
not more pronounced. They express a
fear that the result b will encourage con
tinental powers to increase the hostility
toward the annexation of the Philippines
by the United States, although they doubt
tnat there will be any more serious In
tervention than acrimonious protests, "as
the power? are aware that Great Britain,
would not allow the United States to be
overborne by a hostile coalition."
The Spectator Bays: "The statesmen
of the continent universally fear the ad
vent of the United Stat>Â»u in European
politics. They cannot rid their heads <>f
the Idea that, if they stand together, aa
when they coerced Japan. America wiH
similarly yield. "But their representa
tions at Y.'ashington are likely to Irritate
greatly thÂ«* national pride of the Ameri
can? "leading to a universal support of
;!ent McKinley in a reply which,
however moderate in tone, will, in effect.
be a clear defiance. The excessive fears
felt of an Anglo-Saxon alliance is shown
by the fact that the whole Continent
sees In Lord Salisbury's Guildhall refer
ence to America all manner of menaces."

MUCH TROUBLE AHEAD
FOR THE TOLBERTS
WASHINGTON, Nov. 11.â A special
to the Post from Columbia, S. C, gives
the following story of to-day's develop
ments in the race riots in that State:
Sheriff MoCaslam of Greenwood
County, in which Phoenix is located,
wires the Governor to-day:
"Things perfectly quiet and excite
ment all gone. You cannot rely upon
sensational rumors."
Late news from the scene of the re
cent lynchings indicates that the angry
passions of the' people are subsiding,
and no further bloodshed is now to be
expected unless two negroes, _ Circuit
and White, or Henderson, a white man,
all of whom the crowd wish to secure,
are found. There is every reason to
believe that all three have made good
their escape.
The feeling against the Tolberts
seems to be intense. An impartial
man. who has been at the scene of the
difficulty, says:
'If the Tolberta return to their home
any time soon trouble will inevitably
follow their presence in the neighbor
hood, which, for some time to come, if
will not be a healthy place for
thorn. They are looked upon as the
incit^rs of the trruble."
It is generally thought dangerous to
allow the two Tolberts her" t-> be taken
'â >ack tri Greenwood. One dispatch says,
in speaking of the prospects of further
trouble, if the Tolberts are brought
back there is no jail made that will
stand.
This morning notice was given James
Tolbert, whose wife is postmistress at
McOormick, that he would be allowed
thirty-six hours to leave, but that his
wir> and children will be cared for and
protected. Although James Tolbert is
not known to have had anything to do
with the recent troubles it is said that
he left, going no one knows where.
WIFE OF DREYFUS
APPEALS IN VAIN
Not Permitted Even to Inform the
Exile of the Decision of the
_ Court.
PARIS. Nov. 12.â Mme. Dreyfus, it Is
said, applied at the office of the Colonial
Minister yesterday (Friday) for permis
sion to send her husband some warm
clothing for his return home. Her re
quest was refused on the ground that the
Government would do what was neces
sary. At the same time the authorities
read to her a letter from her husband to
the effect that, having for live months
addressed appeals for a revision to Gen
eral de Boisdeffre without petting any re
ply and being wearied and exhausted by
his useless appeals, he would write no
more to his family or to anybody. He de
pcrlbed himself as ill and dying, and be
queathed "to the generosity of my coun
try the care of rehabilitating my
memory."
Mme. Dreyfus then asked permission to
telegraph to her husband the decision of
the Court of Cassation. This request
also was refused. Then, through a
friend, she appealed to President Faure,
but with no better results.
Her counsel will bring the matter be
fore the Court of Cassation.

"WILKESBARRE, Pa.. Nov. 11.â The
Buffalo Express, on the Lehigh Valley
Railroad, which left New York at 8:30
last night, ran into a New York and
Philadelphia eastbound train going
! east on Wilkesbarre mountain at 3
I o'clock this morning. The following
I are the killed:

FRED GLASSER, fireman.
J. C. McGREGOR, express messen

The injured are:
D. E. Price, engineer, New York, bad
ly scalded.
John Robblin, engineer, Wilkesbarre,
badly scalded.
Charles Morgan, express messenger,
scalded about head.
John Shanlleld, brakeman, cut about
head.
The train going east, which was com
posed of an express car, combination
baggage day coach and three sleepers,
. had the right of way on a single track.
The Buffalo Express, in charge of En
gineer Robblin, had orders to stop on a
siding on the mountain and let the New
York express pass. As Robblin ap
proached the siding he discovered that
; the air brakes would not work. The
] train was averaging about thirty miles
an hour, going down grade.
The engineer whistled frantically for
the hand brakes, as he knew the other
, train was, about due. He reversed his
I engine and stuck to his post, but could
! not avert the collision. In less than
i a minute the express from the west,
drawn by two heavy engines, hove into
! sight. A terrible crash followed on a
curve In a deep cut. Nearly all the
passengers on both trains were asleep.
Many of these were thrown fr<vn their
berths by the shock, but none were se
verely injured.
The engines and baggage and express
cars were piled up in a heap in the cut.
The pass-enters rushed from th-> cars,
i hearing the cries of the injured train,
1 men in the wreck, but it was almost
! Impossible to render any assistance.
Flagmen hastened to the nearest tele
graph office and sent word to Wilkes
barre. A wrecking train with a num
ber of physicians and a clergyman was
sent to the wreck, and soon the dead
and injured were taken from under the
; engine and cars. The passengers were
brought to this city, and later a train
was made up and sent over the "cut
off" branch road. The main road is
completely blocked and will not be
clepred for some hours.
An investigation shows that a heavy
windstorm prevailed on the mountain
last nieht. which caused the leaves
from the forest to accumulate on the
track. The engines plowed into the.sÂ»
lenves. which clogged the braking ap
paratus. -â  -â <â â¢ "

WASHINGTON, Nov. 11.âCommis
sioner Oenerai T. V. Powderly of the
Immigration Bureau, in his annual re
port to the Secretary of the Treasury,
gives the total number of immigrants
who arrived in the United States during
the last fiscal year as 229,299, a de
. as compared with the fiscal year
1897, of 1563. Of the whole number
135,775 were, males and 03,534 females;
10,037 came into the United States
through Canada. During the year 3030
were debarred and of this number there
were twelve insane, one idiot, 2261 pau
pers or persons likely to become a pub
lic charge, 257 diseased persons, two
convicts, seventy-nine assisted immi
grants and 417 contract laborers. One
hundred and ninety-nine were returned
within one year after landing.
Of the whole number over fourteen
- of age 1416 could not write, 43,057
could neither read nor write, 27,608 over
twenty years of age had J3O or over
and 9tj,200 had less than $30. The total
amount of money shown by immigrants
during the year was $3,872,077, but the
actual amount brought over was proba
bly greatly in excess of this amount,
ur the whole number of arrivals 55.613
came from Italy, 27,221 from Russia
proper, 25,128 from Ireland, 17,111 from
Germany, 16,659 from Hungary, 12,4i;0
from Galicia and Burkovvina in Aus
tria-Hungary. 12,398 from Sweden and
WB7 from .England.
The commissioner suggests . an
amendment to the laws excepting im
migrants shown to be aJHicted with a
loathsome or a dangerous contagious
ise from the right of appeal or of
a healing before the board of special
inquiry. He also recommends that the
head tax be increased from %i to $2, "so
as to furnish," he says, "a fund suffl
cient to enlarge the bureaus operations
to their full capacity for usefulness in
protecting American citizens from dis
ease, taxpayers from the imposition of
unjust burdens, the hospitals, chari
table and penal institutions from an in
tlux of aliens, native producers from
unjust competition and the social and
political institutions of the country
from demoralization by the corrupt
citizens of other countries."
It is also recommended that the act
which prohibits the expenditure of a
greater sum for immigration purposes
; tha.n Bhall be collected at the port be
repealed.
Mr. Powderly states that the natur
| alization laws of the United States
have been repeatedly violated, and inÂ«
his opinion each arriving immigrant,
when admitted to the United States,
should be provided with a landing cer
tificate setting forth the name, ace, sex,
birthplace of the immigrant, govern
ment to which allegiance is due, the
port from which the vessel sailed, the
name of the vessel, the line it belongs
to, the port it arrives at and the date
of landing. The immigrant should be
instructed by means of circular to re
tain the certificate for presentation
where applying for naturalization pa
pers.
A record of the facts stated in the
said circular as to each immigrant, to
be known as an immigrant directory.
should be kept for each fiscal year by
; the Bureau of Immigration. An act
| of Congress, authorizing such a course
j of procedure, and requiring of the alien
| presenting himself for naturalization
i to produce such a certificate or a dv-
I plicate from the immigrant directory, j
would facilitate the work 6t the courts
I and go far toward preventing the issu
| ance of fraudulent naturalization pa-
The Commissioner General expresses
I the belief that the figures given of the
I arrival of immigrants through Canada
represent only a part of the actual im
! migration through that country, and
pu^tr-pts as a remedy the enactment of
a law authorizing the Secretary of the i
Treasury to designate certain points
along the border separating the United i
i States from the Dominion to be the sole |
; ports of entry to this country of trans- ;
j Atlantic and trans-Pacific immigrants
and of all Canadians who shall not
i have resided in Canada for at leasÂ«
j five years prior to emigration to this
! country. It wou!1 be possible under
such a provision, he says, to abolish
the present official stations on Cana
dian soil and to transfer the officials
so placed to this side of the boundary.

AN ASYLUM
FOR INSANE
CRIMINALS
Plans to Be Discussed
at San Quentin.
NEED OF THE INSTITUTION
HOW GOOD AND BAD ARE NOW
HERDED TOGETHER.
Dr. T. W. Hatch of the State Lunacy
Commission Expatiates on the
Crying Necessity of
the Step.
F. TV. Hatch of the State Lunacy Ccm
misFion arrived in this city yesterday and
registered at the Lick House. He is
greatly interested in the plans /or a State
asylum for the criminal insane, which
will be discussed at a joint meeting of
the State Prison Directors and the Lun
acy Commission, to be held at San Quen
tin to-day. In discussing the matter Dr.
Hatch said:
"This State has long felt the need of an
asylum for the criminal insane, and if all
I goes well ye will hayÂ» it within a short
time. Ther" are a great number of crim
inals confined within our lunatic asylums
to-day arid the result is very bad. In
the first place their inSuence is demoral
izing to persons who are simply suffering
from a diseased brain with no morbid or
criminal tendencies. A great many are sim
ply shamming, and the result is that
they work among those who are actually
suffering from disease of the brain and
induce them to assist in plans for escape,
for almost every person confined â \vk.nn
the walls of an asylum is willing nnd
ready to escape at any time the oppor
tunity is offered; they simply need a loud
er, and the criminal insane make good
leaders. The idea is to have an Institu
tion as secure as a prison, with all the
modern facilities for the treatment of
diseases of the brain.
"Aprain, there are a great many people
confined in our State prisons who should
really be under treatment for disorders of
the brain. They are not- exactly insane.
yet they are near enough it to require
treatment which cannot be given them
in the prisons.
"This matter has frequently been dis
cussed at sessions c the Lunacy Commis
sion, and while it is agreeed that the
Slate needed such an institution and
needed it badly, no real, definite action
has been taken. It has generally been
conceded that the best place would be
Folsom. Stone, labor and water are all
there, and the cost of erecting the build
ings necessary would be very slight; in
fact. I think it would be a g^pat saving
to the Â£tate in the end. as the criminal
lunatic Is always trying to escape and
frequently does escape, and when he once
gets beyond th^ border:-! of the Slate it is
an expensive matter to bring him back.
I oari now recall three murderers who
have escaped from asylums and I am pos
itive that these are only a few cases. One
man got as far as Arizona and it cost the
State a considerable sum tr, get him back.
"As to the size of the building. I think it
should be large enough to accommodate
at least two hundred persons. According
to statistics there are now one hundred
and fifty in the State prisons v.-ho should
really be in asylums, but as there Is no
asylum provided for them they simply
get the treatment of ordinary criminals.
"There sf three plans which will be
brought before the general meeting to
day. The first is for the separate institu
tion: the second is to set apart wards in
the State prisons, and the third to pro
vide wards in connection with the State
institutions already established. It is
doubtful if we will get further than the
appointment of a committee from both
bodies to work in harmony. If we do this
I think there will be little difficulty in
procuring the small appropriation neces
sary from the Legislature."

CURING LEMONSâ G. W. M.. Wyan
dotte. Cal. Professor E. J. Wlckson, su
perintendent of the department of univer
sity extension of agriculture of the Uni
versity of California, to whom your ques
tion as to the curing of lemons was sub
mitted, has kindly furnished the follow
ing answer:
A good way to cure lemons, either on a
email or large scale, is to Dick the fruit while
it Is still greeii in color, with the greatest pre
caution against bruising, and place it in staal
low trays or boxes In a dry, moderate!;
and dark place where there is good ventila
tion, but no draughts or currents of air. Green
lemons thus treated will assume a beautiful
yellow color, and the nnd. which is at first
thick am: full of sap and easily bruised, will
become thin and silky, capable of mucn
handling without bruising. This is the com
mon method of curing iemonK. Various forms
of buildings and curtng-rooSM are contrived to
apply it. It is not a quick method, as it rt -
quires a few weeks, v.lth picking over of the
fruit at intervals, but a cured lemon will keep
for months, to be used or marketed at the most
desirable time afterward. The only method of
curing lemons which can be called a quick
process Is one devised at O vlna, LÂ«.is Angeles
County, and consists in placing the lemon? on
tray.' in the curing-room and sweating them
for seventy-two hours in a higil temperature
by means of steam or other artificial heat, at
the same time changing the air in the depart
ment rapidly by means of blowers, the air es
caping through ventilators in the roof. Thus
the lemons are progressively <lriÂ«d as they
sweat. It is claimed that in that way the
lemon can be cured In seventy-two hours so
that the moisture is all tak-^n out of the skin,
tr.aking it like a piece of buckskin. Some fa
vorable results have been secured by that
method during; the past summer, but fuller
trial is needed to demonstrate its value. It
is evidently not adapted to economical use
on a small scale.
SCENTED WOMEN.
The papers are amusing themselves by
discussing whether it is justitiable for a
woman to scent herself by means of hy
podermic injections. It seems to us that
there is nothing to discuss. Women who
money and no occupation will al
ways do loolish things. They are at the
mercy of every quack and charlatan, and
nothing that we can say is likely to have
much effect on their roily. People who
consult palmists and fortune tellers are
likely enough to take up any new craz-.
As a matter r.f fact, the custom of scent
ing the breath and the body oy the usÂ©
of drugs injected under the skin is by no
means new, and there are many estab
lishments in Paris and elsewhere which
exist solely for this purpose. The mas
sage shops would haVe adopted the idea
long ago, but their customers are ex
clusively men, and man's folly does not
run in this particular direction. We have
seen a neat little outfit consisting of a
hypodermic syringe and a number of can
nuUi" obtained from one of the Paris
houses, ar.d we have b&en made acquaint
ed with the formula of .c solutions em
ployed, but it would serve no useful pur
pose to make them public. We can only
express a hope that the apparatus is.
aseptic, or at all events thac it is occa
sionally washed, for if this precaution is
neglected there is likely to be a pretty
general dissemination of disease, and
some of the ladiea who now find time
hang heavily on their hands will be less
pleasantly occupied than they had an

Casslni, an Italian by birT*?i. was the best
known of the astronomers of the Paris
Observatory when founded by Louis XIV,
and, in consequence, posterity has very
generally supposed he was the director.
That he failed to be such was not from
any want of astuteness. It is related that
the monarch ence visited the observatory
to see a newly discovered comet through
the telescope. He inquired in what direc
tion the comet was going to move.
Tills was a question it was impossible
to answer at the moment, because both
observations and computations would be
necessary before the orbit could be
worked out. But Cassini reflected that
the King would not look at the comet
again, and would very soon forget what
he had told him; he therefore described
its future path ir the heavens quite at
random, and with entire confidence that
any deviation of the actual motion from
his* prediction would never be noted by
his royal patron.â Atlantic Monthly.

IN THE LOS ANGELES RAILROAD SPECULATION
How the McDonalds Were Led on
to 'Financial Disaster
and Dishonor.
Spies of the Pacific Bank Discover
the Conspirator's Plans-Pen
Studies.
The Call presents this morning a crlt- j
lcism of the Los Angeles Electric road â 
deal in which the Pacific Bank and the
People's Home Savings Bank became I
involved through the agency of Moses. j
H. Sherman. This criticism is as j
thorough and scathing as was that of |
J. H. Woodard, which was published j
yesterday morning in The Call. The ,
critic whose expert opinion is pub-;
lished this morning was George M. J
Mitchell, a confidential adviser of the j
McDonalds and a trusted employe of
the Pacific Bank. After the McDon- i
aids had been inveigled into the Los
Angeles Electric deal, Dick McDonald :
sought to fortify himself in his posi- j
tion or to discover some means through
Which he could retire without loss from j
the speculation. He delegated J. H. \
Woodard and George M. Mitchell to ,
make the necessary investigation. I
Woodard was more thoroughly in- !
formed than Mitchell, but the latter j
rendered a report that was extremely :
valuable, particularly- in the light of 'â 
subsequent events.
He showed, in the first place, that
Sherman resisted every effort of in^
quiry and objected particularly to any
mv Btigation that would reveal the con- j
dition of his books. Mitchell discov- |
ered at that time that the Los Angele* ;
manipulator was in collusion with A. |
F. Johns and closely allied with him
ki every affair that might prove of mu
tual advantage. When Mitchell sought ;
to obtain any information in reference
to the books he was quietly informed i
by Sherman that A. F. Johns had al- j
ready obtained every fact that could
possibly be of any benefit to the Pa- ,
cine Bank and its manager. When the
investigator found that it was out of j
the question for him to expect any co- ;
operation on the part of Sherman he in- j
stituted an independent inquiry and '
submitted his report to K. H. McDon
ald Jr.
This report should have led the de- :
luded banker out of the speculation, j
Its only material result wÂ»*3 to cost i
Mitchell his position with McDonald.
The young man earned for his labors
the ill will of the McDonalds and the
hatred of Sherman. He had the satis*
faction, however, of contributing to the i
secret history of the Pacific Bank one
of Its most interesting chapters. He
sketched three pen pictures and gave
to the public a most interesting char
acter study of Moses H. Sherman, J.
F. Crank and J. H. Woodard. This
criticism of Mitchell is of great value
to a thorough understanding of the
great Los Angeles Electric road deal
that led the McDonald banking insti
tutions to destruction. While engaged
in his inquiry George ML Mitchell met
Charles Dxinsmore, who was then a
member of the banking commission.
Mr. Dunsmore was a close friend of
M. H. Sherman. Through the agency
of Mr. Sherman a brother-in-law of
Mr. Dunsmore was placed in the Los
Angeles bank.
The report of Mr. Mitchell on the
attitude of Mr. Dunsmore might there
fore have been expected. Mr. Mitchell
reported to his employer that Duns
more, who is now secretary of the bank
commission, was very favorably dis
posed toward the McDonalds and was
very much pleased to know that they
had taken the awful burden of the
Riverside bank upon their backs. Dur
ing his investigation in the southern
part of the State Mr. Mitchell also met
Colonel J. H. Woodard, whose name in
variably had a paralyzing effect orÂ»
Sherman. Woodard had already re
ceived $1000 from the Los Angeles Eiec
tric Itoad Company and was at that
time engaged in hounding Sherman for
$1400 more. Mitchell's letters contrib
ute a very valuable element to the his
tory of the banks.
SHERMAN BALKED AT ANY INVEST-
IGATION OF HIS AFFAIRS.
George M. Mitchell was as unsparing
in his criticism of Sherman as was
Colonel Woodard. Mitchell was an em
ploye of the Pacific Bank, and in the
middle of 1592 was sent by R, H. Me- j
Donald Jr. to the eouthern part of the !
State to investigate the affairs of the j
Riverside Bank and of the Los Ans- ! s
Electric Railroad. At the very time
Mitchell was making his investigatidri !
Woodard was compiling his sensational
rep'Tt on the Los Angeles road.

report, as already indicated, revealed
to young McDonald the dangerous
character of the ground upon which
he was standing. While Mitchell was
not able to secure the detailed facts
that Woodard had obtained, he was
nevertheless able to see that considera
ble fraud and a great deal of misrepre
sentation: were being used to keep the
Pacific Bank in the gigantic scheme
that Sherman expected would bring
him a fortune.
When Mitchell arrived In Los An
i geles on his mission of inquiry he
; found that A. F. Johns had preceded
I him. Johns, as a matter of fact, was
I not only Dick's sycophant, but Sher
! man's ally. In a letter written on
August 2, 1592. Mitchell indicated the
1 difficulties under which he sought in
formation in reference to either the Pa
j ciflc or the People's banks. All of
: his questions were either parried or
evaded by Sherman, who declared he |
| had given all the information neces- j
i sary to A. F. Johns, and that nobody
i else wouldÂ»recp;ve it. This led Mitchell
;to believe that Johns and Sherman
were in a conspiracy to ruin the Pa
cific Bank and to misrepresent the true
. condition of affairs of th<^ Los Angeles I
Electric Railroad. In the letter that I
will follow Mitchell expressed his opin- '
1 ion. and in doing ?o exposed one of the !
essential facts of the history of the j
banks' ruin. Excernt? from this im- I
I portant letter are as follows:
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. Aug. 2, 1892.
R. H. McDonald Jr., V. P. Pacific Bank
âMy Dear Sir: This morning I called on 'â 
; Mr. Sherman: it was the first time I ever !
, had an opportunity to meet him. He re- ;
: ceived me very kindly and informed me i
â  that he knew of me and my intended visit ;
â  and informed me that there was nothing I
that I could do for him; that Mr. Johns j
had done it all. He was very sorry that ;
; I had met Mr. Crank or Mr. Spence be- I
fore seeing him. I was surprised, to say j
, the least, and in reply to my questions he !
assured me that Mr. Johns would be fur- !
i nishpd with statements, fierures. etc. i.xr. '<
Sherman insisted that I should do noth- i
j ing. In fact. Insisted, as the director ot
thÂ«Â» Pacific, that I should do nothing and
i said that the interference by a strnnge
man with his interests would not be al- i
! lowed.
I corfeps I was at a loss just how to !
proceed, so I sought again advice of Mr.
Crank and pave him In substance the In- I
I terviews with Mr. Spence, Mr. Clark and !
; Mr. Sherman. He admitted he did not i
I quite understand the turn affairs had I

After the Pacific Bank had been made insolvent by Its disastrous speculation In the Los Angeles electric railroad; R. H.
McDonald Jr. sent George M. Mitchell to investigate the affairs of the road and report its condition. In this report
Mitchell gave an extremely interesting pen picture of the three great, characters in the Los Angeles deal. Tho in

The fac-simile given above is an excerpt from that part of Mitcuell's letter which deals with M. H. Sherman.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1898.
BANK COMMISSIONER DUNSMORE WAS PROPITIOUS.
While George M. Mitchell was engaged In the Investigation of the affairs of the Los Angeles Electric Railroad he
devoted some of his time to an inquiry Into the condition of the Riverside Bank. This bank had become
practically a dead weight upon the Pacific Bank. The Bank Commissioners were watching it with suspi
cious eyes, and Mitchell reported to his employer that he had met Charles Dunsmore, who was then a Bank
Commissioner, and had found him extremely favorable in his attitude. Mitchell's report, in conjunction
with subsequent developments in the history of the bank, is extremely significant. Part of the letter which
he wrote to the vice president of the Pacific Bank is given in fac-simile above.
! delegated by Dick to look into, the af
i fairs of the Riverside Bank, that had
I become a tremendous burden to the Pa
! ciflc. In connection with this inquiry
j Mitchell met Charles Dunsmore, who
i was then Bank Commissioner and is
I now secretary of the commission. Duns
| more was at that time for a variety
! of reasons favorable to the McDonalds
I and their interests, and in the follow
ing letter Mitchell shows how extreme
i ly favorable Dunsmore was in refer
' ence to the Riverside Bank:
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 14, 1892.
R. H. McDonald Jr., V. P. Pacific Bank,
' San Francisco â My Dear Sir: I saw Mr.
i Charles Dunsmore, Bank Commissioner,
I this morning and had a fine talk with him.
I He was In my room. We of course talked
1 about the Riverside Banking Company.
! He seemed very much interested and as
sured me that the Commissioners were
pleased and felt easier now that they
know your bank was taking such an in
â  terest in getting the Dyers fixed up. He
' thought there was no danger for the near
j future and assured me that the Dyers as
well as all the directors knew exactly
I how matters stood. I am. yours truly,
GEORGE M. MITCHELL.
;the three great actors in
sherman's conspiracyâ a
character study.
On August 24, 1892. Mitchell wrote an
exceptionally important letter, in which
he drew a character word study of the
three leading figures in the Los An
geles Electric road deal. These three
men were Colonel J. H. Woodard, the
nemesis and implacable enemy of
Sherman, J. F. Crank and Moses H.
Sherman himself. Crank and Sher-
man were enemies. Sherman had
made a deliberate attempt to ruin
Crank and had failed. Woodard was !
a close personal friend of Crank and
was intimately acquainted with the af- ]
fairs of the Los Angeles Electric Rail- ',
road. When Mitchell wrote his lettev I
Dick McDonald was deeply concerned ;
to learn every fact in connection with ;
the road, and Mitchell told him at that
time that he did not believe Sherman
was acting honestly in his administra
tion of the affairs of the road. The
letter that will follow Is a very long
one, but is of vital Importance in a cor
rect understanding of how Sherman :
trapped the Pacific Bank into a sup
port of his gigantic scheme. If any
effort be made by the robbed deposi
tors to gain some of their money that
went into the Electric road this letter
of Mitchell's will be extremely valua
ble.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 24, 1892.
R. H. McDonald Jr.. V. P. Pacific
Bankâ My Dear Sir: What I am to
write to you may possibly exceed what
you may think may be the object of my
being: here, but I hope not and believe it
will show to you that I have not been
Idle. I also feel that whatever knowledge
I may be In possession of belongs to you.
I wish to write of the three particular
men connected dlrpctly and Indirectly
with the subject at hand. I wish to speak
first of Mr. Crank. I inferred from what
you told me that you not only considered
his ability as a business man, also his In
tegrity and honesty of purpose, but also
in the sfhcerlty of his iriendship toward
you. I have found him to be a very
pleasant person as well as a thorough
business man, studious, industrious and
faithful in the discharge of the duties
of his position. The management In my
opinion could not be more thorough and
no one could be more in sympathy with
the successful operation of his business
than is Mr. Crank. He is not a man that
favors any underhand arrangements and
seemed to be pleased when any proposi
tion Is presented that looks toward the
consummation of his plan of consolida
tion, -whereby all parties that are inter
1s presented that looks toward the
ummation of his plan of consolida
, whereby all parties that are inter
ested or have been interested will realize
the most for their original investment,
Secondâ Mr. Sherman impresses me en
tirely different. To be sure I have heard
of him a number of times before and a
great deal about him, but will say honest
ly that I was not prejudiced or biased
against him, as I had never had the
pleasure of a personal- acquaintance, and
I called at his office the first time with
the very I friendliest feeling. The recep
tion that was accorded me had a very
unpleasant effect, but as I have already
written and told you all about It, it Is
not necessary for me to repeat it here,
but I cannot help but think * time with
very friendliest feeling. The recep
l that was accorded me had a very
leasant effect, but as I have already
tten and told you all about it, it is
necessary for me to repeat it here,
1 cannot help but think now as I
recall what he said to me and how he
said it, I thought very differently of him,
of his ability, of his honesty and of his
intentions and desires from what I would
have done if he had been definite and
more frank with me.
Comparisons are sometimes very un
satisfactory and not very pleasant to
make, but when I make the comparison
between Mr. Crank and Mr. Sherman I
am convinced that there is between the
two nothing in common. I believe Sher
man to be visionary and imaginary in the
extreme, a man that is not capable of
planning so as to see the end from
the beginning; us man who has no from
beginning; a man who has no knowl
edge of details; a man who cannot con
line himself from anything else but
dreams without the ability or the stand
ing to be able or to have the influence
to have them executed.
I believe him absolutely incapable of
presenting a plan where business men will
be able to follow out with detail. I find
it is impossible for Mr. Sherman to talk
any great length of time on any one sub
ject. Not that he would not do it with
me, that cuts no figure, but Mr. Crank
says that he will not and could not do
it with him; that it is an impossibility
for Mr. Crank to engage his attention on
any one subject or scheme or plan for
even a few minutes in succession. I do
not know, so I will not say positively,
but I think and I believe that all the
transactions of Mr. Sherman's company
are not kept in regular business like man
ner, that is I mean that no complete or
systematic set of accounts are kept. I
am satisfied that Mr. Sherman does not
and will not tell to those that are interest
ed all that he knows with regard to the
disposition of funds or the incurring of ex
penses. I do not like*, to say and yet I
know you will excuse me for saying it
I do not think Mr. Sherman is honest with
you.
Third â I need only say a few words in
regard with Mr. Woodard. You know
i him but not, perhaps, quite as well as I
!do now. Let me say first that I think
j he is a smart man, bright and a regular
bulldog as far as determination â is con
cerned, but a man of the meanest de
scription of principle that can possibly
be had. He hates Sherman. He is bound
to ruin him for no purpose except a de
sire to ruin somebody. 1 do nut think
he has any just cause, but that cuts ho
figure with him. I am satisfied that he
has only friendly feeling toward you, but
to strike at Sherman he wishes also to
strike at Sherman's assistants, whether
it is you or anybody else, it makes no
difference to h.m. â¢ He has heard Sher
man say a great deal in regard to the
way he is being assisted by you. He
defends his act by saying that Sherman is
a dangerous man for the community and
ought to be out of the â¢ way, and that
you ought not to assist him, and that
you by assisting him enable the rascal
to still continue his rascality. All along
he has talked about suing Sherman fur
this $1400. He seemed to think that com
mencing the suit it would be impossible to
ignore the relationship that exists between
your bank and- Sherman, . but I was
pleased to learn last evening while talk
ing with him that he had got on to other
ground, Sherman's political aspirations in
Arizona.
I caught at the straw as quick as I
could and argued with him that if it was '
absolutely necessary for him to commence
suit would it not be well for him to take
up the Arizona matter exclusively and ;
leave the Pacific Bank out entirely. He
told me about having a talk with Mr.
Crank. Told 1 had urged him to postpone
any further action and to give you time
to think and act. I promised nothing,
only advised him; to wait, He said he
needs money. No "doubt he does, and he
put his feeler to me. "If Mr. McDonald
has the influence with Mr. Sherman that I
think he has I think he ought to insist on
Mr. Sherman making a settlement with
me." Now, he says, as a matter of fact
if they have not got the $1400 to give me
why let them give me $700. I asked him if
he would be satisfied with that, but he
would not commit himself. As I said be
fore Mr. Wooaard is a smart man and one
who has for the ,last two years been
studying these roads and tneir doings and
their intentions and certainly is- the best
posted, man, taking it all together, in re
gard to these roads of any one here. Now
as regards the railroads. Los Angeles is a
city of 60.000 and they have here 100 nines
of street railway. ' The city covers a great
deal of ground and from one extreme to
the: other it is a long way with block
after block between the extremes where
not a soul lives. 1 believe ! Log â  Angeles
will arrow. â  â  ,
There is no doubt of it and I believe it
will fill up. That it has got to do this
to make the railroad system a success and
protit. If the Electric Company is pay
ing expenses it is more tTian people here
think, and if it is only paying ex
penses it is running way behind.
Considering that if the city will increase
by a half, expenses then might be met,
but in live years the Bystem will be an old
worn out system and would have to, by
that time, bo replaced from beginning to
end So 'how can the future oe looked
upon .is a safe investment? Mr. Crank
telis mo that in San Francisco there is,
say, 2O'J miies of street railway. Their
daily income is $25,000â that is, at the rute
of $125 per day per mile. The expenses
of running these roads Is less than they
could possibly hope for fol some tÂ»me in
lioa Angelos. Now compare that with L"s
Angeles with 100 miles of railway. 60,wK)
at the greatest, source of Income $L 5 per
mile, so ti. â  -haif as many milts
rancisco and $15
I mile. The.se are
facts and must be considered when uis
counting the future of Los Angel
wish I was qualified to possibly make I
tliese facts more plain to you, but what I
wish to be understood as meaning and
j thinking is that in no way ran i sec that
! by perfecting this affair can you hope for
' success and further that to continue with
1 a man like Sherman cannot but make
' your condition and position worse.
Now, my dear sir, I hope you will ac
! cept this letter in the spirit in which it is
! given It is only Intended for you, for 1
' have oniy your interests at heart, with
: out any care for myself, for the results
i or any favors to ask from any one.
I sent you a paper yesterday arjd
i marked the item "Arizona Politics.' Sir.
Crank says he saw Sherman Monday
morning for the purpose of talking busi
ness but would only say a few words be
fore he would get off on that article and
walk the room and cussed the *~aper for
printing the article. Mr. Sherman was
completely off his base and as a matter of
fact disgusted Mr. C. completely. I am,
yours truly, GEQRGE M MITCHELL.
-JAYHAWKER- WAS IN PERSISTENT
DEMAND OF MONEY FROM
SHERMAN.
On September 3, 1892, Mitchell gave
his employer," Dick McDonald, a few
more facts in reference to Woodard
and Sherman, referring particularly to
Sherman's effort to get rid of Woodard
and to turn the newspaper man loose
on Dick McDonald. Woodard was still
in hot chase after $1400 from Sherman
and Mitchell informs Dick in the fol
lowing letter how Sherman is going to
make a hurried trip East and ship the
whole matter on the shoulders of Dick.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept 3, 1892.
R. H. McDonald Jr., V. P. Pacific Bank
âDear Sir: I saw Mr. Crank and
ard. Mr. Crank told me that Mr. Sher
man was going to start East next Tues
dayâwas going to New Hampshire or
Vermont after the money of an estate
that was being settledâ was going to put
up his railroad bonds as security or
would sell them if he could. He Sâ im
agines that he could do with them about
as he wishes to. Mr. Woodard is Quite
vexed and says he must have money.
Mr. Crank says he is doing all he can
with Sherman in order to get the matter
fixed before he, S., goes away, but can t
get anything definite out of him. How
ever, I promise to wire you to get per
mission to pay over the amount. That
looks as if Sherman wanted to lay all ol
the blame on you. And while Crank and
Woodard know you are not the one who
is standing in the way. Woodard so ex
pressed it to me. I told W. what you
had written me, to tell him, and I really
believe he is desirous to delay whatever
he has to do on your account. I am
yours truly, GEORGE M MITCH ELL.
The foregoing letter ended George M.
Mitchell's connection with the Los An
geles Electric Railway and the people
interested in the project. Mitchell re
mained in the service of McDonald in
the southern part of California for
I some time later, and made various re
1 ports on the condition of the Riverside
Bank. He declared that the Dyers
were simply using Dick for their own
private, seifish purposes, and did not for
i a moment intend to be either fair or
j honest with him. Miss Dyer was
! called all sorts of names and that end
! Ed Mitchell's investigation of her af
j fairs.
To-morrow morning The Call will be
; gin the publication of the diverting let
j ters of Moses H. Sherman. These let
ters form a most remarkable episode
in the secret history of the Pacific
Bank. They will show to what depths
| of sycophancy a man will descend in
his search for money. They will illus
trate how Bank Commissioners, courts,
Legislatures and high officials are used
to support and sustain tottering banks.
The letters of Mr. Sherman will give
the public a more detailed understand
ing of financial crookedness. Over the
signature of Mr. Sherman him
self The Call will show that
the great conspirator took mani
fest pride in his assumed ability to cor
rupt the bank commission and prevent
| it from closing the doors of institutions
that were systematically robbing the
public. _____________

BANQUET MR. LOUD
GAVE ROYAL FAREWELL TO THE
CONGRESSMAN-ELECT.
Good Meat, Good Wine and Good
Story Make Merry an Evening
at Marchand's.
"A few of his postal friends," as the
menu had it, entertained Hon. Eugene F.
Loud, Congressman that wasâ and isâ at
a banquet last evening at Marchand's.
There were just eleven who sat to table
and they made as jolly a party as ever
foreswore politics and grosser things for
the delights of good viands.
It was a farewell dinner to the Con
gressman-elect. During his administra
tion as chairman of the Congressional
postal committee, Mr. Loud won the sin
cere friendship and admiration of every
hard worked postofflce official in the land
by his consistent policy and numerous
reforms in the system. Out here on the
coast where he was known personally
to nearly all of the postal people, the re-i
suits of his good work were particularly
noticeable, and it was to do him honor
that Postmaster Montague and a number
of his co-workers invited him to the head
of the bright, flower-decked table made
ready for them last evening at Mar
chand's.
It was essentially an informal affair
with lots of good eating and drinking and
stories. Politics was tabooed; there were
no explanations of how it happened to
the Democrats, and Congress itself was
mentioned but once, and that when a
hearty toast was drunk to the continued
success and brilliant career of the re
turning member.
Those who sat down with the guest of
honor were Postmaster W. W. Montague,
H. P. Thrall, R. R. Munro, B. F. McKin
ley, W. A. Robinson, D. S. Richardson,
A. M. Cox, D. Coyne, L. H. Bricker and J.

CHICAGO, Nov. 11.â The heirs of Or
lando D. Hadsell, several of whom live
at Reedley, Fresno County, Cal., pro
pose to contest the will by which the
eccentric old pawnbroker devised his
estate in trust for 100 girl waifs of thia
city for 100 years, at the end of that
time to be divided equally between 1000
waifs of both sexes who may then be
chosen as final beneficiaries.
The will was filed to-day and is a
unique document. After making sun
dry small bequests to relatives as keep
sakes he explains why he leaves tha
property to the unfortunate poor, con-Â»
eluding thus:
Every moment of my life I have been

GRAHAM SAYS
HE HAS BEEN
COUNTED OUT
Claims Hoey's Seat
in the Assembly.
SOME OTHER CLOSE COUNTS
DOOLAN, MEAGHEB AND O'DON
NELL TALK OF A RECOUNT.
Leon Dennery Will Demand a Seat
in the i-enate â Post-Election
G-ossip and In
cidents.
Patrick Graham, the Republican candi
date for member of the Assembly froir
the Twenty-eighth District, declares he
was counted out by fraud and that he
will contest the seat claimed by Lawrence
Hoey, his opponent, In the next Legisla
ture. The semi-official returns give Hoey
a plurality over Graham of forty votes.
This result, Graham asserts, was brought
about by fraud during the count.
The frauds are alleged to have been
perpetrated in the First, Fifth, Seventh,
Tenth and Fifteenth precincts. Graham
is almost certain that the count was
corrupted in the Fifth. He says he re
mained in this booth for several hours
during the count and left when only
thirty-eight ballots remained to be tallied.
When he went away he was twenty-one
ahead of Hoey and he learned that after
his departure from the booth not
another ballot was counted for him.
While these thirty-eight ballots were be
ing counted Hoey, and several of his sup
porters, Jim Sutton, Larry Buckley, John
Connors and John Gurley, were there.
Graham had no one present to watch af
ter his interests.
The seat from the Thirty-ninth Assem
bly District will also undoubtedly be con
tested. In the returns J. S. Wardell,
Democratic candidate, is credited with
twenty-four more votes than Loon Jones,
Republican. Jones has not charged cor
ruption, but he thinks "errors" were
committed which, when discovered by a
legislative Investigation, will give him the
seat.
It is reported that Leon Dennery will
contest Porter Ashe's right to represent
the Twenty-fourth Senatorial District.
The only local contests probable, which,
of course, will involve a recount, are R.
P. Doolan for Superintendent of Streets,
Dr. O'Donnell for Coroner and Michael
Meagher for Recorder. None of the de
feated candidates have as yet decided
whether they will pay the necessary $300
a day for a recount, but they are con
sidering the matter.
Politicians have deserted the Registrar's
office, and Mr. Biggy and his deputies are
arranging to begin the official count on
Monday. It is estimated that the official
canvass will consume from thirty-five to
forty days. There are more offices on the
ballot this year than either two or four
years ago.
The Election Commissioners will meet
Monday to pass upon the warrants of
election officials. In the meantime Regis
trar Biggy is harassed and annoyed by
a largo number of men who served and
who are importuning him every hour to
| "fix" the warrants so they can be ne
j gotiated.
The aftermath of the campaign contains
j some matters of peculiar interest and
; others of an amusing nature. There was
a surprising absence in their various
haunts of the candidates who
were successful as well as those who were
thrown into the slough of despond. With
j the exception of Henry S. Martin, the at
tenuated Sheriff-elect, the headquarters
of the various candidates were closed.
Owing to the fact that this has been the
hardest and hottest campaign in the his
tory of the city, that mythical gentle
man. Mr. Morpheus, had taken charge of
nearly all the officeseekers who have been
through the stress of political battle, and
those who wore anxiously searching for
the winners in the hope of securing pref
erment fey? future appointments were left
in the tfuessing ranks.
At the headquarters of the Republican
County Committee the men who have
borne the brunt of the contest were in a
contented frame of jijind, ana while there
was some regret that they had not suc
ceeded in wiping the Democrats off the
map they found occasion to swell their
manly chests and call attention to sev
eral facts that should be of interest to
the public generally. ( rf
This has been proved to be the banner
campaign in the matter of organization,
and this Is attested by the Republican
success in a naturally strong Democratic
city.
For the first time since the County
Committee has been In existence they
were left to their own resources, not one
dollar having been contributed to the
funds of the local organization by the
State Central Committee; and it is also
the first 'occasion on which the County
Committee has emerged from the smoke
of battle with all debts paid. Further
more, the chief workers of the organiza
tion for the first time voted to not allow
any member money for expenses incurred
in the contest. These loyal workers
strove night and day, and are mutually
glad that they "have came and saw and
ronnuered."

A MAN, A GUN
AND A BALLOT
AT BELMONT
Cause Trouble in the
Pretty Suburb.
CASE OF PIONEER POLITICS
ALMOST A TRAGEDY IN THE
ELECTION BOOTH.
An Official Who Did Not Propose to
Be Bulldozed Carries Terror
Into the Camp of
the Enemy.
It is conceded that the late campaign
was one of the hottest in the history of
ihe State, but with a few mild exceptions
tne war was confined to ballots and words.
Strange as it may apnear, that quiet,
orderly and aristocratic suburb, Belmont,
where political passions are not supposed
to exist, has established the fact that it
is a warm number when it comes to a
campaign where some of the people are
determined to elect both candidates to the
same office.
There was little Interest taken in the
State ticket. The conflict was along the
trail leading to the office of Supervisor.
In that district the candidates were Will
iam Brown, Democratic incumbent, who
had the appointing of the election officers,
and J. H. Coleman. By some accident all
Brown's appointments were of the same
political faith except one, and they were
apparently imbued with the idea that the
other fellow had no rieht to be in the
race.
This belief led to complications before
the machinery of election had ceased run
ning.
The fight in the district was very close
and along in the small hours of the morn
ing it became evident that the fellow who
wanted to be re-elected was getting the
worst of it and the unpleasantness began.
The active animosity grew out of the dis
position of five ballots, the genuineness of
which was in doubt. The lone strange
Republican Indian among the Iroquois
braves in that booth insisted that those
ballots should not be counted. Finally
four of the disputed documents were har
moniously passed upon, but the bulldoz
ing majority went up against a hard for
mation when they reached the fifth bal-
lot.
Tne lone Republican regarded that inno
cent looking piece of paper as a delusion
and snare and declared on his honor as a
gentleman that it should not be counted
with his consent. This declaration of
Intention engendered Democratic wrath
and muscular demonstration thereof, in
which the lone champion of clean politics
was getting worsted in his own bunding,
wherein was the polling-place.
The argument became so strong that the
lamp was knocked over, threatening the
destruction of the property. This was
enough for the minority. With commend
able haste he hied himself homeward,
where he made close connections with a
gun and returned to the scene of contest.
His reappearance with lire in his eye
and death in his hand was the signal for
the other election officers to rapidly re
move their persons to a more comfortable
clime. The man who felt that his rights
and dignity had been trampled upon was
not mollified by this retreat from the bat
tle ground. The result was that he se
lected the man he considered responsible
for the trouble and, chasing him out of
the hall, gave the fellow some violent ex
ercise in the street trying to get out of
range of a gun in the hands of a very
angry man who was also a good runner.
Darkness and the other man's speed
prevented a tragedy and the polls were
closed without burning down the bulld-
ins?
The illustration of how pioneer politics
was done has furnished rich material for
gossip and conjecture in the pretty suo
urban village, but the thrilling event has
not hitherto been made known to the
public. ________________

LESSONS FROM THjE CfIMPfJIGN.
WHILE the dominant moral of the recent elec
tion is clearly perceived by the people, and it
is now well understood that the conservative
stntiment of California will not sanction anything in
politics that savors of revolutionary radicalism, there
are certain minor lessons taught by the result to
which it will be well to give attention before the sub
ject is dismissed and the thoughts of all are turned
to business and preparations for Thanksgiving.
One of the most interesting of these lessons is the
demonstration that at last the railroad issue is out of
California politics. This does not mean that railway
officials may not in future take an active part in po
litical contests and support their favorites by every
means in their power, but it means that the railroad
;:- a corporation is no longer regarded in the popu
lar mind as a dominating force in the commonwealth
â a monopoly so dread and so dangerous to public
welfare that in politics all other issues must be sub
ordinated to the struggle against it.
In the recent campaign every effort was made by
uire and his party to awaken the old fears of the
â¢le and the old animosity against the railroad, but
all in vain. The people laughed. The Southern Pa
cific was no longer a bugaboo. Cartoons of Hunting- j
ton posed as a political boss, as a bandit, as an oc
t( pus, as an omnivorous devourer of men and women
and things generally, failed to flutter the voters. It
i^ doubtful if as many as a hundred votes in the State
were gained for Maguire by all that was said, printed
or pictured of the old-time monopoly.
In this sense, then, the railroad is out of politics.
It no longer frightens the people. It is no longer an
available resource for demagogues. The construction
oi the San Joaquin road and the coming connection
of that line with the Santa Fe system assure a com
peting road which puts an end to the monopoly. The
intelligence of the voters perceives that the situation
has changed. anÂ«l as a consequence they are not to be
influenced any more in political contests by either
a fear or the favor of the Southern Pacific.
Another lesson to be learned from the contest is
the folly of attempting to dodge an issue which is
understood by the people. It was known throughout
the nation that the main point to be determined by
the contest was whether the people would sustain the
administration. It the Democrats had met that issue
fairly â if they had stood by their platform of free
tiade and free silver â they at least would have held
'their party together. As it was they met the fate
tl at befalls every force which attempts to retreat from
the field after the battle has been joined. The retreat
weakened the ardor of the rank and file, led to de
moralization and resulted in a rout.
The emphatic teaching of each of these lessons is
a matter of gratification to all who appreciate honesty
in politics. The elimination of the railroad bugaboo
from politics is really a blessing to the State. Here
after it will not be so easy for demagogues to attain
eminence among us. A better class of Democrats
and Populists will now come to the front, for the
opposition will need on the stump orators who can
seriously debate the issues of the time, and the loud
but empty mouthers about monopoly will have to
give way. Hardly less valuable is the demonstration
cf the futility of dodging. Altogether California will
be found to have benefited morally as well as na
tcrially by the results of the voting on Tuesday, for
the lessons are too clear to be either overlooked at
present or forgotten in the future.
MCLAUGHLIN'S GOOD WORK-
NOW that the campaign is over, the verdict ren
dered and approved, it is natural that those
who bore the burden and heat of the day should
receive proper acknowledgment. Prominent among
rhese is Major Frank McLaughlin, chairman of the
Republican State Committee. From the first he had
been active, and the closing hours found him un
wearied in the arduous work. When success crowned
hie "fl^ri; ~ v~Â» jubilant. His only hope had been
that the party to which he is devoted would secure
an affirmation of the principles it upholds, through
the election of the men who stand for these prin
ciples.
Possibly the position of Major McLaughlin is
unique. He is not in politics for the gratification of
personal ambitions. While the time he devotes to
partisan matters is something a man of affairs can
ill afford to devote to the interests of the public, he
freely gives this time. The highest honors within
the power of his party to bestow have been offered
him, and he has declined them. His declaration that
he desires no office is sincere, as his devotion to
bringing about the triumph of Republicans has been
unremitting and unselfish.
Apparently the most the party can do for the Major
is to tender an informal vote of thanks. . It has no
substantial rewards which it could induce him to take.
A large part of the credit of victory must be given
him, and with this, and the sense of duty well per
formed, he is content.
Among the particular reasons the community has
for congratulation is the defeat of John P. Dunn,
THE PASSING OF THE SANDLOT.
IN front of the new City Hall was an oval tract
covered with sand, ou which was organized, late
in the seventies, the sandlot party. It was a com
bination of ambition and violence which spread
alarm throughout the State, and for. a time seemed
to threaten the permanent destruction of its prosper
ity. The sandlot revolution was so pronounced and
so loud, and so effectually browbeat all opposition,
that it attracted attention all over this country, and
in Europe was really regarded as the beginning of
another Reign of Terror, such as turned France into
a slaughter-pen in the revolution of 1793.
Its theater, that oval area in front of the new City
Hall, has long been grass-grown, and a group of
statuary, provided by the will of James Lick, stands
there now illustrative of the progress and power of
California.
The principles of the sandlot, however, have
had a survival. The uneasy spirits which were trained
there have from time to time taken possession of the
Democratic party and made it a menace to the public
welfare. The disease that generated on the sandlot,
as cholera starts in the well Zemzem in Mecca, some
times went far abroad. Even California Republican
ism has had sporadic attacks of it. But its greatest
persistence has been in the Democracy. In 1896 it
took nearly full possession of that party, and tens of
thousands of Democrats fled from the pestilence and
aided in the political sanitation of the State. But
their flight left the surviving sandlotters in posses
sion of the organization, and, with the Examiner as
the sandlot organ, the campaign of 1898 was fore
doomed to be sandlot, by sandlotters and for sand
lotters.
The ticket was filled with them. Maguire, Barry,
Dunn, La Rue, Henley, Grady, Wallace, Menzies,
Hinton, trained in the sandlot school or inoculated
with its principles, in congenial companionship and in
joint cry for office, made a campaign which proved
that they were in the tertiary stage of the disease.
From the skin in and from the marrow out, flesh and
bone, they were sandlotters.
Heretofore the people had not enjoyed the chance
to quicklime the pestilence by catching it in a group,
where the caustic would harm so little healthy flesh.
They were quick to see the time for action. The dis
infectant was used with judgment, and the bubonic
plague of California politics was obliterated in one
day's work. The sandlot sleeps under the turf and
the daisies, and so does sandlotism. All of its ex
ponents are done for. .The people had been patient
with it, hoping it would die. They have been some
times indifferent to it, as one is to a lunatic who
thinks he is Jove and threatens thunderbolts. But
this time patience and indifference ceased, and the
cleansing and purifying ballot besomed the pestilence
off the face of the earth and left it clean.
The day is not distant when men will wonder that
they submitted to such leadership as this year rode
at the head of the fusion forces. They will wonder
why they felt party zeal for a movement that was the
first serious appearance of anarchy in this country
since the bombs burst in Haymarket square. â¢ The
quiet citizens of California will long recall the great
day on which the sandlot brigade rode to its fate and
fell in a heap, never to rise again.
SALISBURY'S SPEECH-
SALISBURY'S speech at the Lord Mayor's
banquet is reported to have caused no little
irritation among the European powers. The
fact is not surprising, for the speech was more no
table for a certain cynical candor than for diplomacy.
It touched upon every irritating subject in interna
tional politics, and the touch was not soothing.
The important statements of the British Premier
were that the present peaceful condition of Crete is
due more to the admirals who are in command there
than to anything done by statesmen; that Great
Britain's position in Egypt is not what it was before
the victory at Omdurman; that while Great Britain
sympathizes with the Czar's wish for disarmament,
her Ministers will not check their preparations for
war; that the appearance of the United States as a
factor in Asiatic problems may not conduce to the
peace of the world, but is likely to conduce to the
interests of Great Britain; that her Majesty's Govern
ment would take part in a conference of the powers
to determine upon legislation for the suppression of
anarchy, but had no hope that legislation could abate
the monstrous evil; and, finally, that while not de
siring either war or conquest, the Government has
resolved to maintain the empire Britons have re
ceived from their forefathers, and therefore would not
intermit naval and military' precautions.
Against all this array of troubles the frank and bluff
old statesman offered no word of comfort except to
repeat his belief in the efficacy of the European con
cert to maintain peace. He admitted that the pro
ceedings of the concert were not always admired,
nor had the full confidence of the public, but he
pointed out that "patient application, combined with
the moral strength of Europe," has in the past pre
served peace under difficult conditions, and drew
from that experience a hope that the concert would
continue to be at least equally efficient even if it did
not grow in strength and usefulness.
The portions of the speech most interesting to us
are those relating to the pioposed European legisla
tion against anarchists and the effect likely to be pro
duced by our active participation in Asiatic affairs. The
first contains a warning. A vindictive crusade against
anarchists on the part of all European nations would
drive a large number of the worst of that fiendish
crew to the United States for refuge. It behooves
us, therefore, to take heed of what is done in Europe
in this matter, so that we may guard our shores
against the incoming of the enemies of society â the
thugs of civilization who regard arson and murder
as acts of heroism.
In what was said of the result sure to flow from our
annexation of the Philippines there is much to
awaken the anxieties of patriots. When we become
an Asiatic power we are at once involved in all the
controversies now going on in that section of the
world. The war clouds which have long been over
hanging Europe will then threaten us as well. We
have little to gain by the annexation of those tropic
islands with their mongrel populations, but much to
lose. It would be like throwing away the substance
of prosperity for the shadow of empire. Americans
should give heed to Salisbury's frank declaration that
our appearance in Asia might not conduce to the
peace of the world, but would surely conduce to
British interests.
Telegraphic reports concerning the numerous
Texans who died in the vicinity of the polls do not
state whether they had been thoughtful enough to put
in their votes first. Doubtless, however, there were
willing friends to attend to this formality later.
A local snake charmer has been bitten by a rattler,
and while the consequences do not seem to have been
serious to him, it may be that the rattler suffered
acutely.
If the Teresa shall be recovered there will be scant
opportunity for writing on the list of the heroic the
name of the officer who abandoned the ship in terror.
THE SAN FRAK CISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1898.
AMONG the political frauds swept away by
Tuesday's election was Deacon Fitch's Non-
Partisan '"party." This hoary old delusion
has for years been the bete noir of the Republican
party of this State. Professing reform and disclaim
ing all knowledge of practical politics, its moral in
fluence among a small number of thoughtless people
has been considerable. It has been able on occa
sions, by indorsing regular nominees, to change a
few votes and thus aid in the election of an official
here and there. But this influence has generally been
exerted in behalf of Democrats. Seldom have the
Non-Partisans attempted to promote Republican suc
cess, notwithstanding their convention and voters are
made up almost entirely of members of that party.
It is gratifying to note that at last this Democratic
sideshow has overreached itself and come to grief.
Heretofore Mr. Fitch's convention in "doing" Demo
ctatic politics has been extremely conservative. It
has confined its efforts to indorsing weak Republicans
and strong Democrats, and in this way has concealed
from the public its true character as a "reform" body.
But this year, believing he had a cinch on the people
which could not be broken, Deacon Fitch flung his
banner as a, Democratic sideshow boldly to the breeze j
and indorsed substantially the entire Phelan ticket.
The effect on the public is shown by the returns.
With few exceptions every nominee indorsed by the j
Non-Partisans has been defeated by an overwhelming
majority.
Moreover, in the cases in which indorsed candidates
have been elected their success may be discovered in :
influences entirely divorced from Non^Partisanism. j
For instance, Asa R. Wells, chosen Auditor, was j
elected in consequence of the weakness and bad
character of his opponent. F. K. Lane, chosen City
Attorney, was elected because his opponent bore the
name of Fitzgerald, and thousands of Republicans
thought he was the unpopular Commissioner of
Labor, candidate for Public Administrator on the
Democratic ticket. So with the others. Lackmann
and Heyer, two of the Supervisors indorsed by Non-
Partisans, would have been elected anyhow. Deacon
Fitch indorsed them only because he knew opposi
tion wouid be useless.
Almost without exception every other candidate
nominated has been overwhelmingly defeated. Mr.
Fitch's favorite for Sheriff is 5000 votes behind his
opponent; his nominee for County Clerk is beaten
by 7000: his District Attorney â an especial pct â is
laid out by over 4000 majority; his Superintendent of
Schools, another pet, is beaten by a plurality of j
icooo; his candidate for Assessor has lost by nearly ',
Bcoo. Not a single Police Judge or Justice of the \
Peace indorsed by the Non-Partisan "convention"
has been elected, while nearly all the Supervisors and
School Directors who received its favor have been
sent to the political boneyard. An especially active
fight was made by the Non-Partisans against Sur
veyor Tilton. He wins by 5000 majority.
For a long time the Republicans of this city have j
had Non-Partisan sincerity under surveillance. The !
methods adopted by Deacon Fitch, which are founded :
upon a gratuitous assumption of political purity, were i
never entirely free from a suspicion of Democratic
job-chasing. But when the Non-Partisans went in with
Phelan openly, indorsed his entire ticket, copied his
platform and repudiated the best set of Republican
candidates ever presented to the people of this city,
an expose followed, which has resulted in the com
plete destruction of the Democratic sideshow.
It is a good thing that non-partisanism as practiced
here is dead. It always was a fraud.
GERMAN LABOR AND PROGRESS.
SOME British investigators into the causes of the
rapid advance of German industry have reached
the conclusion that the dominant factor in the
problem is not the legislation of the Government, nor
the instruction of the technical schools, but the char
acter of the German people. In their judgment Ger
many is beating Great Britain in all forms of in
dustrial competition mainly by reason that the Ger
man workingman is more faithful, more industrious
and more persistent than his British competitor.
The investigations have not been carelessly made.
No other foreign rivalry of any kind has so disturbed
British complacency as that of the Germans in the
trade of the world. In comparison with that the
average Britisher regards the Russian advance in
China and the French claims in Africa as matters ol
minor interest. The British empire would be little
affected if the Russians were lords of Manchuria and
the French of Central Africa, but if the Germans cap
ture the markets of the world for the manufactured
goods of Europe, the wide empire of the mistress of
the seas will feel the loss in every department of its
power.
Nor is the danger a slight one. The industrial and
commercial advance of Germany has been something
extraordinary. Without the vast natural resources
of the United States and without our swift increase of
population and wealth, the development of German
trade has been almost equal to our own. The growth
cA some of her cities has been as rapid as that of
Chicago. The trade of Hamburg has increased twelve
fold since 1870. The empire leads all European
countries in the extent of railroad mileage, and the
recent expositions of German machinery at Berlin
and at Leipsic are said to have shown something like
a revolution in the industries of the people.
The output of this industry is to be found in every
market of the world, and is rapidly supplanting that
of Great Britain. Even in England itself German
goods are crowding out those of British manufacture.
It is, therefore, not to be wondered at that the manu
facturers and the statesmen of Great Britain have
been inquiring most studiously into the nature of the
new competition and the causes of its success.
Some of the investigators, as we have said, find in
German character the main cause of the success of the
nation. One of these, the London Spectator, says:
"It is not protectionism; it is character, method, intel
ligence, which have won this great victory under
physical conditions less favorable than those existing
in France or England. If we have anything to learn
ir this respect from Germany â and we have much â
h is that we must insist on character, insist on edu
cation, insist on seriousness, on method, on diligence.
There is a real danger that, seeing what great results
have followed the splendid development of technical
teaching in Germany, we shall build numbers of tech
nical institutes without reflecting that in Germany a
great body of culture, of excellent secondary educa
tion, lies behind the technical school and renders its
achievements possible."
There is a lesson for America as well as for Great
Britain in this. The Spectator, being a free trade
theorist, gives, of course, less credit to the benefits of
protection irf Germany to her industry than should
be given, but none the less it is right in asserting
the value of character. In the great struggle for su
premacy in the industrial world that race will win
whose workers are most diligent, most faithful and
most steadfast.
Some of the colored troops who fought so nobly
at Santiago would find in North Carolina now a con
dition of affairs to test their mettle.
A DEAD SIDESHOW.
REAL ESTATE IS SLOWLY PROGRESSING
Outlook of the Mar
ket for the Future.
RECORD OF OCTOBER SALES
EXTENT OE VARIOUS PLEDGES
FOR THE PAST MONTH.
A Glance at the Records, New Build
ing Contracts, Recent Sales
and General Random
Notes.
Real estate at the commencement of
November indicated a slight improvement
on the general sluggish condition of the
market, which has been its main charac
teristic almost for a year past. Inas
much as it has begun well, it is certain
the month will close with a brighter hope
for the future in realty. Although there
have been no exceptionally large sales
negotiated, nevertheless, the increased
number indicates clearly that the valua
tion on sales is steadily increasing. x\c
cording to Thomas Magee & Sons' Real
Estate Circular, the sales for the month
of October in number amounted to Â«28
and In value to 1904,061.
Although this record falls considerably
below that for the same month in the
previous year, it cannot be taken consist
ently as a criterion that the market is
depreciating. The present year has been
fraught with nothing 1 but absolute lack
of progression, and considering this fact
the record of sales for the month of Oc
tober is considered large and an encour
aging proof that realty is on the upward
instead of the downward trend.
According to the authority of the real
j estate firm of Magee & Sons, however,
this impression is erroneous, although the
majority of bankers concede it to be a
fact. They claim that the monthly sales
are the best test of judging the exact con
dition of the real estate market. If they
do not Increase it is utterly- futile, they
claim, to say that the real estate market
is improving.
The number of mortgages for the past
month amounted to 2tÂ», with an aggregate
value of $1,70, The releases ana recon
veyances numbered in the | records 200,
with a total value of $509,155. The largest
number of both releases and mortgages
was taken by private individuals, me
aggregate pledge assumed amounted to
$214,758. Releases from various pledges
on property were valued at $276,752.

A ROMANCE PUNCTURED.
Sergeant Tendy and Nellie Fetters
Not Married After All.
It seems from the latest accounts that
the Tennessee regiment is shy one ro
mance accredited to it by one of the par
ties in interest. A week or so ago Mrs.
Nellie Fetters, of 1935 Mariposa street,
Fresno, became responsible for the pub
lished story that she and Sergeant Jessup
Tendy of the First Tennessee Volunteers
had been married just before the young
soldier sailed for Manila, and that she
was going to join him in the far away
islands of the Pacific as soon as she
could get there by steamer. While tell
ing the story the woman made several
statements that caused doubt of its truth.
It is true that Mrs. Fetters did ask
the Cupid of the County Clerk's office for
a marriage license, but she did not get
one. Soon after the soldiers sailed for
Manila she went back to Fresno and from
there she has been writing and telegraph
ing to John O. Huff, cousin of the al
leged husband and a member of the Ten
nessee contingent that has been sent
home. Since the alleged marriage the
woman has sent the following dispatch
from Fresno to Huff: "If you go to Chi
cago I will go that far with you. Answer
immediately. I pay. Nellie Fitters." An
other dispatch to Huff says: "Will vim
wait till Thursday night? I will go East.
Answer quick. I pay. Nellie Fetters."
Young Soldier Huff does not regard the
proposition with favor. He has a letter
from her in which she intimates that she
is very desirous of seeing Sergeant
Tendy's mother, and speaks of a great
wrong having been done her by the man
whom she says is her husband. Huff sent
the woman a dispatch that should set
tle her case forever. It was to the ef
fect that he does not want her to send
him any more letters or telegrams and
not to assert that she Is the wife of Ser
geant Tendy.
Miss Shields Owned the Shell.
The shell found by Harry Murray at the
late residence of Mrs. Shields on Virginia
avenue is claimed by Miss Julia Shields
as being her property.
She said it was given to her by a young
man named Sam Reed, who is in the navy
and at present on board the Petrel. Her
desire for curios prompted Reed to bring
her the shell about four years ago, an-1
during all this time neither herself nor
her mother had any idea that the shell
was loaded or in any way dangerous. It
was left at the residence in the hurry and
bustle oÂ£ the Shields" removal.
NOTHING CAN

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 11.
It is now realized that nothing- could be
gained by the fusionists by making a
contest against the Republican County
Clerk, Frank Jordan, who was re-elected
by over 500 majority. As the votes came
in the margin between Jordan and his op
ponent, T. L. Stoddard, was very narrow,
and there were whispers among the fu
sionists of fraud. At the close Jordan
drew well ahead, and as the fusionists
had watchers at the polls as well as the
Republicans, it is an admission of care
lessness and indifference to suggest tnat
their man was counted out. Especially
is this the case in view of u.e fact that
the Union County Committee boasted
before and after election of the wonder
fully successful efforts it put forth to pre
vent illegal voting and unfair counting.
The campaign of County Clerk Jordan
was the most bitterly contested of any
on the ticket. Jordan four years ago was
a prominent leader of the A. P. A. Dur
ing his term of office this organization
fell apart, and Jordan's half was fought
by the other half. The Independent Re
publicans also indorsed Jordan s oppo
nent. He also had to fight the Democrats,
Populists and Silver Republicans. In his
own ward he had the bitterest fight of
all. Owing to the unpleasantness in the
Hilborn-Metcalf contest Jordan only car
ried the primary election by six votes,
and the bitterness then apparent had not
died away last Tuesday, Jordan feeling
the full benefit of it. However, the
doughty Clerk did not despair, but by at
fability and hard work he won enough in
dividual votes in workshops, on trains, in
factories, in offices and in the hidden dis
tricts of the county to land himself a
winner.
Chairman Breed of the Republican
County Central Committee is preparing
for the grandest ratification demonstra
tion that Alameda County has ever seen.
"I intend to drive home the moral of last
Tuesday," said Mr. Breed this afternoon.
"This duty on the part of Republicans
cannot be treated slightly. We must once
and forever demonstrate that Maguireism
is a dead issue and that intelligence and
conservatism are synonyms for Republi
canism. Every Republican club in the
county will be 'invited to Oakland for the
occasion. There will be two mass meet
ings and enough fireworks to burn up the
town. The datf> has not yet been set. but
in all probability ir will be one week from
to-morrow â November 19.
Big Debt Compromised.
An order was made by Judge Coffey
yesterday permitting Mrs. June L. Stan
ford to compromise the indebtedness due
the Stanford estate from the estate of the
late Judge James Shafter. The amount
of the indebtedness is 177,551. The amount
is secured by a mortgage upon two tract?
of land and a chattel mortgage upon 700
head of cattle. The land was subject tn
the lien of a prior mortgage and has sub
sequently been conveyed to the Point
Reyes Land Company. Judge Coffey has
authorized Mrs. Stanford to accept pay
ment of p.ccrued interest amounting to
$4000 and a mortgage of $75,000 on a part
of the Rancho Tomales.

Trade with Hawaii Is on the Increase
and there seems to be a constant demand
fur sailing vessels to put in the sugar
/ trade. At the present time three new
vessels re being: built for the Honolulu
business and will be ready to go into
commission about the first of the year.
Two of the vessels will be four masted
i schooners and one is being: built at Eu
reka by H. D. Bendixsen and the other
at Alameda by Hay & Wright. The other
vessel will be a four' masted barkentine,
and she also is being built at Eureka.
The schooners will be sister ships to the
Muriel and Honoipu, now on a race from
San Francisco to Puget Sound, Australia,
Hawaii and home. They are 164. feet long-,
87 feet broad and 13.S feet deep, and will
be named the Robert H. Hind and James
Kolph, after the members of the firm of
Hind, Kolph & Co., who own the fleet.
The barkentine is 191.6 feet long, 39.10 feet
broad and 16.S feet deep. She has not
been named yet. All three vessels when
completed will load here for Honolulu.
The wrecked river steamer J. D. Peters
was rais.ed put of the mud in Richardson
isay yesterday and carried up a consid
. erable distance on the mud flats. Thurs
day night the chains and fixtures were
got under her keel and at low water the
barges were made fast. When the tide
began to rise it looked at one time as
though the barges could not overcome the
suction and immense weight of the water
combined, but at the last pinch the Pet
ers came. The tugs Sea Queen and Red
mond at once took hold of her and ran
her away up on the beach.
me Peters Is now In such a position that
fit low water her main deck is comnletely
f It will now be an easy job for the
divers to go down and make a bulkhead,
and in two or three days the vessel will
be pumped out and afloat.
The remains of six Chinese were got
out of the forward cab!n of the Peters
on Thursday, and there are still believed
t<>. 'be six or seven more there. No at
tempt will be made to recover the bodies
however, until the vessel has been bulk
headed and pumped out
The British bark Heathfield, which ar
rived at Port Townsend yesterday in bal
last lias had a very eventful time of it
lately She left Shanghai for the Sound
in ballast and on September 5 was caught
in a typhoon. It raged for three days
ana When all was over the vessel was

compelled to put into Yokohama in dis
tress and then the troubles with his crew
began. First one lot of men would de
sert ana then another, so the skipper was
constantly in hot water.
, Just before the vessel sailed from Yo
kohama Victor Hendrickson; an able sea
man, and R. XV. Gardner, the cook, de
. sorted and were taken before Judge R
Â«Â». E. Forster of Her Britannic Majesty's
court for Japan, after being- caught. Cap
tain McKenzie gave Gardner a bad char
acter, but said Hendrickson was a good
Vailor. He asked that both men be re
turned to the ship. After Imposing a fine
the judge made the order asked by i.,e
captain and then began to leave the
. bench. Gardner was mad and exclaimed"
â¢â¢The old man says I'm no good, and what
do you want to send me back to the ship
. for?" "With that he let fly a heavy hook
which narrowly escaped his Honor's head
and wrecked a glass globe. He was given
six months' Imprisonment with hard labor
for contempt of court, so the Heathfield
had to sail without her cook. She made
the run across the Paciric in the faÂ«t
k time of thirty days.
Repairs on the steamer Czarina that
â was run down by the river steamer J D
Peters are being rushed. While she is in
the hands of the workmen a new well

THE BERKELEY RUNS AMUCK.
Crashes Into Her Slip and Smashes
Seven Piles and Does Other
Damage.
The Southern Pacific's new ferry steam
er Berkeley ran amuck last night and
nearly scared the life out of the passen
gers who were aboard. Something went
wrong- with the machinery and the fast
ferry-boat went crashing into the slip.
Seven of the big fender piles grave way
under the impact, the planking of the
wharf was torn up and some of the under
pinning of the structure was carried
away. , .
The Berkeley was only damaged to i-^e
extent of some paint, and the passengers
escaped with a scare.

MISAPPLYING
CITY FUNDS
It Meets a Delayed
Death.
SUPERVISORS' SCHEME FAILS
IT WAS FOR REPAIRING POST
STREET.
Had Slipped Through the Board
Without Notice and Was Al
most Ready for Exe
cution.
The wealthy citizens who have their
homes on Post street, between Leaven
worth and Hyde, will not be favored with
a new bitumen pavement at the expense
of the city. The Mayor yesterday inter
posed a veto, which, it i 3 understood, will
be supported l.y Clinton, Dod~e, Lack
mann and other. Supervisors who were
hoodwinked into voting for a bitumen
pavement on the block In question.
Some peculiar jugglery has come to
light in connection with this matter. It
appears that certain well-to-do people
â with sensitive nerves, who reside on the
block, were disposed to object to the
rumble and roar of vehicles passing over
the substantial basalt surface in front of
I their residences. The pavement was one
of the best of its class in San Francisco,
and there Beemed little chance to secure
a new one of noiseless bitumen on the
pl< a that the basalt was worn out. So
iar as tlie residents could foresee they
wore doomed to endure noise in common
with thousands of other citizens also liv
iiiH ori basait streets.
But just at this juncture there came to
the front very quietly the man who was
I.- â â¢ ded to assist the afflicted people whose
turs were distracted by the rumblings of
the Post street basalt. He called upon
certain Supervisors of the Street Com
mittee and explained to them that the
sound waves from basalt, especially the
sonorous basalt of Post street, were de
cidedly injurious to the ear drums of the
property owners in his neighborhood, and
that it would be a humane act if the Su
pervisors would be so kind as to order
the pavement torn up at the expense of
the city and bitumen substituted.
One and all of the Supervisors who were
approached pondered long and seriously
ovi r the proposition. "What excuse could
they give for tearing up an ao
street, one of the best in the city, and
placing bitumen upon It at the expense
of the municipality, when miles upon
miles of other basalt paved streets were
not so treated? It was a knotf question.
If the property owners on other streets
found it out thoro would be a frigluful
howl. So the Supervisors of the Street
Committee reasoned in council until one
of their number exclaimed: "Well, how
do you suppose that the taxpayers are go
ing to know anything about It? We will
simply advertise for bids in the official
paper, and there Isn't one chance in a
thousand that anybody will see the ad.
You can tip off the word to the Pacific
Paving Company arid the job will be
doite.
The Street Committee chorused ap
proval of this wise advice and then took
tin- necessary preliminary stt-p of spoking
tl â¢ consent of mio entire board. Mixed
In artistically among a mass of inof
fensive street repair recommendations
tho resolution to repave Post street, be
tween Qeavenworth and Hyue. was put
through by the committee on October 18
without discovery, tho few wnteh dogs
in the txmrd failing to scent any job.
Mayor PhHan, iii tho chair, was com
plaisant. Ail went morry as a marriage
bell. Tho Street Committee proceeded to
advertise for bids, using the city's official
organ, and of course nobody saw the ad
vertisement. Tho conditions printed were
to the point. Bids were asned for on
the distinct understanding that the con
tractor was to be paid by the city and
county alone. It was so stated in the
conditions. The Pacific Pavlntr Company
was awarded the contract for $2657 34. less
1475 34 rebate for fine basalt blocks takon
up and classed as "old material." The
scheme had proceeded without a hitch,
and thfÂ» Supervisors who were instru
mental In putting it through Wfre each
pxpecling a littlo private smile of appre
ciation, when some meddlesome person,
nn me at nresent unknown, went to the
r and demanded that justice should
be "done tho other taxpayers of tho city
who did not live on the .selecteu portion of
Post street by vetoing the resolution
awarding the contract. To give tho
Mayor duo credit, he was fully of the
opinion expressed by his visitor as to the
unjustnoss of the repaying project, and he
sat himself down forthwith to writo a
v<Mo terse and stringent in its brevity.
This vfto was dropped into tho office of
the Supervisors' clerk late yesterday aft
ernoon. Now there will be kiekinjr and
bucking and a gruesome snort on the part
of the Streel Committee and the Post
street gentlemen who had promised each
of them an individual smile ac a reward
for tlioir earnest and disinterested labors
for the alleviation of noise on Post Street
at a time when the street fund was ex
hausted nnd nopded repairs on other
streets were held to be impossible.

BATTLE FOR WALTER'S ESTATE.
Judge Troutt Hears Two Applica
tions for Partial Distribution.
The fight for and against the partial
distribution of the estate of Gustav Wal
ter occupied the attention of Judge Troutt
yesterday. Josephine "Walter, widow of
the deceased, seeks distribution to her of
120,000 in money. In a second petition
August, Louis and Herman Walter, broth
era of the deceased; Frederlka Berken
bush, a sister; three children of a de
ceased sister, and six children of Mrs.
Schimpf, another sister, seek distribution
of $SOOU among them. These applications
are contested by Mrs. Emma Sterett, fur
years Walter's companion. A suit is now ;
pending In which Mrs. Sterett seeks to !
establish her contention that 12,500 shares [
of the Walter Orpheum Company, valued j
at $25,000; live bonds of the Market Street I
Railway Company $30,000 on deposit In !
various banks, $15,000 in dividends on the
Orphoum stock and other assets were â 
by Walter as her trustee, and she,
Since his death, is now entitled to tho <
property. Attorney Black of counsel for !
Mrs. Sterett also stated on the stand yes- '
terday that his client had further In- j
structed him to file a claim for an ac- i
counting against the estate.
When the case was called yesterday
Josephine Walter and Charles Schimpf
took the stand to establish minor allega- j
tlons. The various points involved were
then argued. Counsel for the petitioners
contended that partial distribution should
be granted even in event Mrs. Sterett's
claims were meritorious, which was
dnuhtod. as the estate, being valued at
$171,804 TO, was of sufficient magnitude to
stand the payment of the amounts asked
without jeopardizing Mrs. Sterett's claim.
Mrs. Sterett's counsel, however, con
tended that the order for distribution
might and in all probability would place
their client in an unenviable position, and
the court was asked to deny both peti
tions. Judge Troutt ordered the case sub
mitted on briefs, and the point will be
decided by the end of the month.
Becker-Creeg-an Cose.
Tho Becker-Creegan forgery case will
go to the jury next Monday afternoon.
For the past two days the case has been
argued. Attorney Ach made the opening
argument for the prosecution and was fol
lowed by Peter Dunno for the defense.
Dunne closed his argument last evening
and Monday morning Ach will close for
the prosecution. The case will then be
submitted for the consideration of the
jury.

From the Cole County Democrat, Jefferson

When la grippe visited this section,
about seven years ago, Herman H. Eveler

health began to fall and he was obliged to
discontinue work. That he lives tfe-day

"I was troubled with shortness of
breath, palpitation of the heart and a

DENIES THE BUMOB.
William M. Bunker Says the Daily
Report Is Not for Sale.
There was a rumor current yesterday to
the effect that the Scripps-McÃae syndi
cate of newspapers was negotiating for j
the purchase of the Daily Report and
that the sale was to be made at 1 p. m.
yesterday. The rumor was strengthened !
by the fact that Paul H. Blades, manag- |
er for the Scripps-McÃae syndicate, was
In the city and had called on the manage
ment of the Report on business of a more
or less private nature. _,â.
fcdward Booth, editor, and William M.
Bunker, president, of the Report, positive
ly deny that the paper has been sold or
that there is any negotiation for the sale
of it to the Scrippe-McÃae syndicate.
They further state that there has been no
transfer of any of the stock of the Report,
and that the paper will continue under
the same management as heretofore. Mr.
Bunker was busily engaged yesterday
with several gentlemen on business, but
said it was on matters pertaining to the
news service of the Scripps-McÃae syndi
cate, to which the Report Is a subscriber.
There are 2900 shares of stock in the
paper, and of this amount Mrs. A. C
Hiester owns nearly a half Interest. The
remaining bhares are owned by Mr. Bun
ker and others. The rumor was that the
Scripps-McÃae people were trying to ob
tain control of Mrs. Hiester's shares. Isa
than H. Frank, attorney for the Report,
also denies that there is anything in the
rumored sale of the paper. Despite these
many denials it was learned from other
sources that the Scripps-McÃae syndicate
is making direct overtures to the manage
ment of the Report for the purchase of
the paper, and it is stated that only the
question of the amount to be paid for the
paper has so far prevented a consumma
tion of the sale. It was learned that the
sale of the paper may occur this week as
goon as terms are agreed on by both par
ties. â¢

: SINGULAR STATEMENT.
1 From Mrs. Rank to Mrs. Plnkham.
1 '
The following letter to Mrs. Pink-
â  ham from Mrs. M. Rank, No. 2,354
East Susquehanna Aye., Philadelphia,
Pa., is a remarkable statement of re-
lief from utter discouragement. She
says:
" I never can find words with which
to thank you for what Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound has done
for me.
" Some years ago I had womb trouble
and doctored for a long time, not see-
ing any improvement. At times I
would feel well enough, and other
times was miserable. So it went on
until last October, I felt something
terrible creeping over me, I knew not
j what, but kept getting worse. I can
hardly explain my feelings at that
time. I was so depressed in spirits
: that I did not wish to live, although I
j had everything to live for. Had hys-
i teria, was very nervous; could not
j sleep and was not safe to be left
alone.
" Indeed, I thought I would lose my
mind. No one knows what I endured.
" 1 continued this way until the last
! of February, when I saw in a paper a
testimonial of a lady whose ease was
i similar to mine, and who had been
cured by Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegeta-
I ble Compound. I determined to try it,
and felt better after the first dose. I
continued taking it, and to-day am a
well woman, and can say from my
heart, 'Thank God for such a medi-
cine.'"

women to write to her at Lynn, Mass.,
for advice. All such letters are seen
and answered by women only.

"WINDY AND DISAGREEABLE."
When a man blows wind off his stomach, that is flatulence.
Sometimes people call it gulping arind. No matter what you call it,
the disease, for it is a disease, is an annoying one to you and disgust-
ing to your friends. I once heard a politician speak of a rival, whom
he did not admire, as a flatulent old fool. Flatulent means wmdy.
Usually we mean by it wind collected in the stomach. Wind in the
intestines may also be just as properry designated flatulence. It is
always caused by indigestion. A physician, who practices in a town
near Albany, New York, reports the case of an old gentleman who
had been so annoyed by a persistent condition of flatulence that he
had consulted all the doctors in the vicinity without securing any
benefit. 4< Finally he came to me and I prescribed several remedies
which failed utterly. I then prescribed Ripans Tabules, which he re-
ported gave him immediate relief, and he is now nearly cured. I think
it would be an excellent thing to make a strong feature of â¢ flatulence*
in all the R-I-P-A-N-S advertisements, for I find theaa cxceJJeoi in
almost every case of that sort,"

EASTERN MARKETS.
CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Nov. 11.â The opening trades In
wheat showed declines of %Â£J9Â»c, May starting
at from 60^-4 : i?Sor.jC- There was plenty of news
of a discouraging nature to buyers, but the
peiiing pressure was surprisingly light and no
further decline occurred. On the contrary the
market began to mend shortly after the open-
Ing, and though the advance was very slow
lor two hours it was sure. English consols
were up 3-lbU bid and an almost total lack of
foreign buying orders was reported from the
seaboard. Liverpool, which declined Id yes
terday, showed a further decline at the open-
Ing here to-day of Vtfld. and London reported
cargoes 3V*d lower. Shorts considered It
advisable to take the fronts on yesterday's
decline, and^ their buying soon sent the May
price up to d.'i^o. For a long time the market
hung between that figure and 65VjC. The vol
ume of trade was very moderate and fluctua
tions were Infrequent until after 11 o'clock,
when the tone 0/ the seaboard and foreign
news changed decidedly for the better and the
market here Immediately took notice of that
fact. Liverpool cables showed half of the
early decline recovered. Reports as to export
engagements were very conflicting for a time,
but the steadinss of New York convinced spec
ulators that good lousiness was being done. New
York anally claimed as high as 120 loads taken
at all points. The cash demand here and at
Northwest points showed improvement. There
was some talk of a possible squeeze In Decem
ber at New York, and this had an effect on
local shorts, who covered freely. As the ses
sion progressed the demand from shorts gradu
ally grew heavier and afternoon trading was
quite heavy in volume. May advanced steadily
to 66Vic and was bringing 66VsC at the close.
Corn was weak early on a decline in cables
and the Government report, which made the
crop 1,iC7.000,000 bushels. There was a good
cash demand and a lot of December buying
by shippers. There was renewed buying at the
decline by leading bull operators and the mar
ket became tinner, closing at the best prices
of the day. May closed a shade higher.
Oats were rather slow. Renewed selling by a
local ing, who has been selling heavily of
late, and sympathy with corn caused a rather
weak market early. Cash demand was good,
and whee the liquidation was over the strength
of car lot prices and the advance in other
grain markets was rejected by cats. May
closed a shade higher.
Provisions were stagnant. Early there was
some weakness with wheat and on lower hog .
prices. There was some demand from pack- j
erf, especially for lard, and shorts covered i
moderately, prices recovering the slight open- I
Ing decline. Cash demand was better. At the
close January pork was 2%c higher, lard and
ribs unchanged.

I CALIFORNIA FIGS IN NEW YORK.
NEW YORK, Nov. 11.â Journal of Com
merce says: Layer flgs in boxes have been and
will be throughout the season a scarce com
modity. California has to some extent sup
plied the shortage In Important varieties, but
! the bulk of the stock received has been packed
i in l-r>ound bricks. The best fruit has come
| from the northern part of the State and in tex
j ture and flavor has compared favorably with
| imported figs, but the objection made against
the average California fig by consumers is that
! It ia thick-skinned and is deficient in flavor
i and sweetness, and until considerable improve-
I ment in these respects is made opinion among
Eastern handlers seems to be that it will be
! diflicult to induce consumers to take them
jas a substitute. even temporarily, for im
: ported fruit. California, it is claimed now,
, has an exceptionally good opportunity to in
troduce her figs in Eastern markets, but while
buyers at present may be disposed to pay
comparatively high prices for them because of
the short Smyrna crop, next year, if there is
a good output of the latter. California growers
may find it a difficult matter to maintain a
foothold in Eastern markets unless they ma
terially improve the quality of their fruit la
texture and flavor and are ready to market
it here at reasonable prices.

Harrison's circular says:
".During the week there have been four de- !
liveries of coal from Washington with 11.950 |
tons, two from British Columbia, 6548 tons;
total, 18,496 tons. No cargo this week from
Great Britain or Australia, although there are
several overdue, ami the total arrivals this
week are considerably less than the quantity !
consumed. Very few vessels have been added
to our coal-loading list from foreign ports for
the past thirty days, and but lew will be
add) tor the next month if we do not have
a seasonable rainfall in the Intervening time.
Already coal charter rates have been advanced
from Great Britain, caused by the absence of
I local rains, although it is certainly very early
| yet to feel at all alarmed. In November any
changes in the f. <>. b. prices of Australian
coal for the ensuing year are always declared.
â¢So far the schedule has not been finally named
for 1899, although it nTgenerally conceded the
price for Wallsend will be 8 shillings per ton.
This has been the banner year for the northern
collieries, as they have had the fuel market
under their absolute control. The quantity of
I competing foreign fuel has not been sufficient
to disturb any prices they might establish.
"From Swansea and Australia there are
about 21,000 tons of coal to arrive In the noxt
thirty days, which is less than 'one week's
actual consumption; the deficit must be de
livered from the coast collieries. So far there
has been no intimation that any change of
values will be made In fuel for domestic uses

ON BETTORS
AT THE TRACK
Oakland Furnished a|
Few Sensations.
TENRICA FIRST AT 20 TO 1
ANCHORED, AT ODDS ON, WAS
BEATEN" BY LOTHIAN.
Fig Leaf, Defender and Kaiser Lud
wig in a Sensational Finish.
Amasa Beat a Fast
Field.
There were some twists and curves
rnlxed up with the racing at Oakland yes
terday that the talent found hard to
pcive. Probably the unkindest cut of all
was when Marplot finished absolutely j
last in a field of five, going a miie and a i
sixteenth. He opened a prohibitive
choice and receded to even money. It ap
pears the hooded horse had been slug
gish in his work, and was not fancied by
his etable people. Our Climate, with Rut
ter up, was the bottle of Tobasco sauce
the smart set all reached for. and they
made the books rub his price from fours
to 6 to 5. He appeared to have every
thing under cover through the stretch,
when Devin, on Tenrica, came with a
rush and won by a head. The winner
â was backed down from 20 to 12..
The Burns & Waterhouse representative
was not the only tired first choice. In
verary 11, Anchored and Ed Gartland
were also side-tracked at wayside sta
tions, all carrying big commissions.
In the opening six furlong sprint for
maidens Inverary had Rutter at the
helm and everybody got aboard at even
money. If Rutter did his best the Mon
tana horse has gone back, ror he flj
a fast-coming third. Stan lowers, with
Piggott in the saddle, won all tho way,
beating the 75 to 1 shot l'ungo handily.
The windup of the second race, decided
over the Futurity course, was the pret
tiest of the meeting. Fig Leaf, Df I
and Kaiser Ludwig striking the wire in
the order named, short heads apart. The
winner was a 2 to l favorite.
Lothian seems to have finally raced Into
shape and made easy work oi Anchored,
the short priced favorite, in the five fur
long sprint for two-year-olds. The
ridden by Rutter, looned to have thi
in hand at the head of the stret<
was outfooted and downed a length in
1:02 flat. Peter Weber was third.
The concluding sprint over the F M
coarse was gathered in by Amasa, the
ring going to 6Vi to 1 for the mom y. The
fast gelding was always in front, und led
Chihuahua out a l<^srth in 1:10%. Sport
Mc.-\l!ister was third.
Turf Notes.
Pat Dunne, the widely known "Western
turfman, Is r: and was a specta
tor at the races yesterday.
Hugh Henry purchased O'Fleeta from
Frisco Lind betv - and turned the
gelding over to Billy Short to train.
While the field was at the post in the
second race, O'Neil, who had the mount
on Defender, was kicked in the thigh and
severely cut by Kaiser Ludwig. He wuÂ»
replaced In the saddle by Eddie Ames.

Whenever I drink coffee it affects my
heart in such a way that I cannot get
my breath without great difficulty. My

trouble for some years, which we found
by experimenting with leaving off cof-
fee, came from the coffee directly. We
have now been usirrg Postum Cereal

Food Coffee for three years, and both
husband and myself are perfectly well.
We shall never use common coffee
again as long a3 we can get Postum.
The following people have to my
knowledge been greatly benefited by
the discontinuance of coffee and the
use of Postum:

One thing people must remember, if
they. expect to. get a fine flavor from
Postum. It must be allowed to boil
long enough to bring the flavor out,
and just simply setting the pot on the
stove fifteen minutes wont do: it. but
fifteen minutes must be allowed after
the real boiling begins. j

VIOLATING FISH LAWS.
Many Local Dealers Arrested for
Selling Undersized Bass.
Deputy Fish Commissioners Davis, Lowe
i and Vogelsang have been making things
â¢ -ting for the fishmongers of this city
I during tho past few days. Under the State
law of 1879 it is unlawful to catch striped
j bass under three pounds in weight. This
i was for the purpose of protecting the
: fish that had been brought from the East
for the streams of the "West. The lHue
fellows have thrived until now there are
thousands in the rivers and bay. If given
a chance they will grow as heavy as fifty
pounds and they are as gamy a fish as
swims. During the last week the bay
has been full of these tish and the fisher
; men have been taking them in their nets,
big, little and all. The only way of reach
ing the offenders is to punish the men
who sell the tish and thereby encourage
the fishermen to violate the law.
Within the past two days the officials
mentioned have been making an inspec
tion of the several fish markets and ar
resting all of the dealers who had under
sized bassâ under three poundsâ Ua their
possi ssion. Thi offenders were Arnold R.
Bi ydi n, Chinook ' market; Benanico,
Spreckels market; Ah Lum, Chinatown;
Hayes street; A. Frediani
Â«v Co., Hayes and Octavia streets; D.
et, and R. Maye,
ry market. The latter was con
victed and yesterday paid a fine of $-v.
In all places many bass weighing
less than a pound were found.
ANOTHER CHINESE TRICK
Collector Jackson's Ruling on an
Erasure Approved by the
Government.
The Secretary of the Treasury notified
Customs Collector Jackson yesterday
that it had approved of his decision in
the case of a Chinese section 6 certificate
on which there appeared an erasure.
Some weeks ago a Chinaman applied
for admission to this country and pre
sented a section 6 certificate in which his
former occupation was given as that of
ry master. His present occupation
tated to be that of a teacher. The
word "teacher" had been wruten over an
erasure. For that reason Collector Jack
son refused to allow the applicant to
land. The Secretary of the Treasury said
In hi* decision that erasures on Chinese
should be noted in the margin
In the same manner as erasures on other
documents, and certilied to. The appli
cant will be deported.
COOLIE TAILOR ESCAPED.
Broke Away From the Chinese Lega
tion and Now at Large.
The resident Chinese Consul notified j
Collector Jackson yesterday that Ho |
Nam, a tailor, employed by the Chinese
legation in Washington had come to San
Francisco for the purpose of returning
to China, but that on arriving at this
port he failed to report at the Consulate
and escaped. The Consul wants the tailor
arrested and" deported, for he has no
right to be In this country except as an
attache of the Chinese Legation in Wash
ington.
This Week's Wasp.
Full of bright and interesting jokes, sto
ries ;i tchea from original contribu
tors, the Wasp comes out this week a.s
tincttvely a fine number. The cartoons
are exceptionally good, one showing the
sad "Retreat to Jsew York of Napoleon
Hearst and his string of imported car
toonists and writers"â Davenport, Mc-
Ewen, etc. Another shows Barry, "Cus
pidor Jim," as not only being "turned
down, but nailed down." The "Social
Jus" column, by Teresa Doane, is
replete with timely comment and Mulroo
ney discourses inimitably on election mat
ters.
Dr. Shrady writes about the de
cadence of business 'men in next
Sunday's Call.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1898.
THOSE WHO
FOLLOW THE
PIGSKIN
The Great Football
Match.
BOTH ELEVENS FORMED
LAST GAME OF THE OLYMPIC
TEAM.
It Will Meet the University of Cali
fornia Team at Recreation
Park This After
noon.
In less than two weeks the Intercollegi
ate football match between the Cardinal
and the Blue and Gold will be lost and
won, and the usual excuses and explana
tions forthcoming from the sup
porters of the losing side. Even
the interest in the game has not
been shadowed by the engrossing topic ol
the public mind, politics, which has
buried everything with it but football.
The last time that either college will
appear in a match game this year will be
this afternoon, when the Olympics and
the University of California measure
strengths on the Recreation park. Stan
ford has run its full quota of matches
with the club men. The college men
from Berkeley will play their last sched
uled game to-day, and much depends
on the result. From this hour on the at
mosphere will be full of the football fever
which will be assuaged on Thanksgiving
day not to reappear for ten months.
At the time of this writing the respec
tive elevens of both colleges should be
well formed and solidified. This is prac
tically the state of affairs at Berkeley
and pretty much so at Palo Alto. Bar
ring injuries California will play a team
that will present no new faces in the reg
ular line-up. The varsity has been in
crystallized shape ever since the change
which sent Cornish to center and put
Grelsburg in the second eleven. This hap
pened after the last game with the Olym
pics, played in this city four weeks ago.
The only doubt about positions on the
Blue and Gold eleven is in regard to the
occupancy of quarter, one guard position
and possibly fullback. Hopper, who was
playing quarterback for the varsity when
he met with a serious accident to his
knee is now so far recovered as to ap
pear on the field for light work. He is
still weak and not in the best condition
on account of his several weeks' rest.
Whether or not he will be able to round
in shape for the big game is a question
which time alone can solve. Should he
not be in trim on Thanksgiving day Thane
will undoubtedly be played quarter. Thane
is a fair substitute to Hopper at his best,
and the team will not be a great sufferer
on account of Hopper"s absence, although
he is a very strong, reliable and steady
player It seems very probable that
Ahem will make the team, as he in now
playing a game that will win him the
choice. The other guard position will rest
between Hooper and Barnes. Who will
be the lucky candidate will be known
early next week.
Fairly good reports emanate from the
Berkeley campus. According to Coach
Cochran the team is playing a good qual
ity of football. The practice during the
early part of the week was encouraging,
as men showed spirit, animation and pro
found interest in work cut out for them.
The baneful practice of individualizing
certain players and practically preventing
team action which was so common at
Berkeley is not seen there this season.
The eleven which will face Stanford on
Thanksgiving day will, unless it falls to
follow the teachings of two months and
the daily vociferations of the coach, play
together as if there was a common end
in view This is the redeeming feature of
the California eleven at the present time
and what makes it a much stronger team
than the cardinal to-day.
Despite the fair reports of the practice
at California there Is a lengthy sick list.
The great sufferer is Pete Kaarsberg, who
Is now a victim of blood-poisoning.
Kaarsberg baa from the very beginning
of the season played a game that insured
his position as full back on the varsity.
At the last stage of the game he was vis
ited by a most troublesome illness. His
general play was of such a character as
to leave no choice for the coaches in their
selection of him for the guardian of the
back field. At present his condition is
such that unless some radical improve
ment is noted he will be unable to don
his suit to-day and possibly he .will not
appear in .the intercollegiate game. Sev
eral other men are suffering from bad
ankles and strained arms and shoulders.
The Stanford eleven is also in pretty
bad shape. Burmeister is by no means in
as perfect condition as he should be; Mur
phy is suffering from a bad knee and sev
eral .of the other men are running tho
gamut of injuries; however, without any
serious calamities.
The Stanford eleven Is giving Coach
Cross more or less worry this year. In
the first place there was no such thing as
spirit among the players until the begin
ning of this week. The candidates went
to work in a very listless way and their
playing showed for it with but very few
exceptions. On Saturday they played the
Olympics in this city and a tie game re
sulted. On Tuesday last the cardinal
team, weakened by the absence of the
ends and possibly. Burmeister at full,
were defeated by the clubmen with the
score of 12â0; which, however, is no basis
of comparison of the respective merits
of both teams. The Olympics played ail
round their opponents, and the score
would have been twice Its size had the
game lasted longer.
The great weakness of the Stanford
team is at the center. Oilman, who played
that position, may or may not make the
varsity, but the easiest mark for the
Olympics was the Stanford guards,
through whom gains were made- in most
regular order and for even distances. The
Olympic touchdowns were earned by
sheer line bucking, and as this was cer
tain to produce victory the clubmen rare
ly resorted to any other tactics. What
the Stanford eleven team lacks at present
is cohesion and unity. The material is
none of the best, and without team play
the cardinal will not have a chance this
year. The same thing may be said of
the blue and gold, eleven. The material
at Berkeley is of mediocre quality, nor is
it prolific; but there is a semblance of
team play in the California eleven. Man
for man, there is pretty much of a bal
ance in the two teams, but California's
concentration of effort makes it an. eleven
25 per cent better than its adversary is
at the present time. Of course the week
and a half of practice which Stanford
will have before the final meeting will do
something for it.
Stanford has the reputation of possess
ing a resurrecting ability. Season after
season has the cardinal team gone into
the mountains the last week of practice
before the Thanksgiving match and come
out of retreat a rejuvenated body of .men.
This may happen again, But the chances
are not as favorable as in former years,
when the coach had a number of first
magnitude football players to work on.
Two years ago, when Harry Cross was
coaching, the team at this time of the
season was in a very crippled condition.
They went to the mountains and came
back hale and physically perfect.
In order to get the men to work the
guard of coaches will be at Palo Alto this
coming week. Clemans, Downing, Fran
kenheimer, Code, Fickert and a few oth
ers will be out with the team every niri't.
There will be no fooling on the Palo Alto
campus from now on. The players have
now recognized that they must work to
hope to win and the result may be very
Inspiriting for the Stanford students.
What ought to be the very best game of
the season between the Olympics and a
college team should be played to-day. The
clubmen have been improving steadily and
should put up a game this afternoon
which should reach the acme of inelr
efforts. The first four games in which
the Olympics played were victories for me
opposing teams. Then they played a tie,
which was followed by a dazzling victory.
The Olympics this afternoon.if they meet
the best that California can produce, will
face the strongest team they have met
this season. And this is the very reason
why the game should prove the most In
teresting of the entire series. It is the
final appearance of the clubmen and last
showing of the California team but one.
The Olympics are hopeful of winning and
the California men are the same. The re
sult of this game will give the enthusiasts
an opportunity of forming judgments
more or less erroneous on the respective
abilities of the two college teams.
The Olympics and California elevens
will line up in this way:

LAWN TENNIS WILL
BOOM THIS WINTER
Politics and football have up to the
present time drawn the attention of many
players away from lawn tennis. The elec
tion Is already past and gone, and when
the great Intercollegiate football match
shall also have become a matter of history,
lawn tennis will experience a revival. The
California Lawn Tennis Club, which a
year ago had ninety members, has up
ward of 130 now. Many young people
have recently joined the club, and greater
interest Is being taken In the game than
for several seasons past. The round
robin tournaments, in which every team
plays every other team entered, and the
one winning most sets is victor, have
proved very popular. R. M. Whitney and
George Brads haw, popularly known as
"ihe invincibles," defeated R. J. Davis
and J. Hooper, and also S. Adams and H.
Weihe in the round robin tournament,
men's doubles, on election day, and are
now the club champions in doubles. The
Hardy brothers, Samuel and Sumner. are
the holders of the Pacific Lawn Tennis
Association championship In doubles,
which they earned by defeating Freeman
and Plcher on September 10 at San Ra
fiu'l. Sumner Hardy la at the University
of California, and Samuel is at Stanford:
when these meet, the best lawn tennis
ever seen In Intercollegiate games on this
coast will bÂ« played. On his first ap
mce on the Bush-street courts
or three weeks ago, Sumner Hardy de-
I. ated Daily, ami came out victor i
m" the double matches in which he p
Miss Alice Hoffman having- goni
Honolulu to spend the winter, Miss Wini
fred Mason is now the strongest lady
player on the California Club courts. K.
M. Whitney and George Uradshaw are
the strongest double team, while K.
Adams and H. Weihe, the "ponies," play
a hard and clever game. R. J. Davis, the
treasurer and mainstay of the olub, is
niv, reliable player, and W. R. Mc-
Gavlri. formerly champion, still wields the
let effectively. Werner Stauf, who
weighs 220 iiounds, is the best player
among the heavyweights. The first ten
players rank in about the following order:
George F. Whitney, R. M. V. r hitney, Wal
ter Magee. Sherwood Adams, !
Weiho, George S. Jiradshaw, J
Hooper, Dr. C. B. Root. Walter S. Mc-
Gavin and Arthur Cheestbrough.
WHAT LOVERS OF
GOLF ARE DOING
The Oakland Golf Club !s In a very
prosperous condition, having 225 members
on its roll. The course is in excellent
trim, having recently been rolled with a
twenty-ton steam roller. The links, -well
covered with grass and wild Sowers, pre
sent B very attractive appearance. Two
or three dozen players, among whom are
several ladies, are to lie found daily on
the links. The executive committeo will
make arrangement* to enlarge the dress
ing room accommodations, which are
quite inadequate to the requirements of
the members who play regularly.
Last Saturday several members who
to enter tho captain's cup competi
tion played two nine-hole rounds to qual
ify. The captain's cup 1s a silver trophy
presented by O. Pierce. Jt is the property
of the club, but the names of winners are
inscribed upon it. The average of the two
rounds was taktn, and all who ir.ade an
average of fifty or fewer strokes are
entitled to play for the honor of having
their names handed down on the cup.
The following players qualified: R.
CookÂ© 50, J. P. Edwards 50, B. fi. Folgt-r
4') i\ vl. Bowles 49, R. M. Fitzgerald 48
J. C. McKcc 47, G. D. Greenwood 47, F. S.
Stratton 4G and \V. P. Johnson 45. The
â¢ tition is held twice a year, and con-
Fists of two rounds, 18 hules. it will take
place this afternoon.

EIGHTY DOGS
WILL CHASE
THE HARES
Big Stake to Be Run
at Ingleside.
THE LARGEST YET GIVEN
PREPARING FOR THE GREAT
MERCED MEET.
The Drawing Will Take Place at
Pythian Castle This Even
ing at Eight
O'Clock.
The Ingleslde Coursing Park Directors,
anticipating: an exceptionally large gath
ering of the admirers of coursing at the
meeting of to-day, have made consider
able changes in the grand stand looking
toward the comfort and pleasure of their
patrons.
The stake is one of the largest ever
run in an inclosed park, consisting of
eighty high-class dogs.
Last week The Call tipped twenty-six
winners of the thirty-two courses run on
Saturday last, and unless something un
foreseen happens the selections for the
meeting of this afternoon, and which ap
peared in yesterday's paper, will doubtless
come near to the mark intended.
At 8 o'clock this evening a drawing for
the Ingleside Club's grand animal meet
ing at Merced will be held in Pythian Cas
tle, after which the club will give a ban
quet to its friends at a popular restau
rant.
When the club selected November 15 as
being an excellent time for coursing in
the open, it figured upon considerable
rain prior to that date, but o'.d Jupiter
Pluvius, Who handles the strings of the
flood gates on high, is seemingly taking
quite a long nap and forgetting us poor
mortals below.
But rain may fall between now and
Tuesday, and should a good sprinkle
strike the plains the pleasure of the out
ing will be enjoyed by hundreds, as the
Ingleside Club invariably carries a largo
following.
President Shannon is In correspondence
with Tommy Hall, the grand old sport of
Merced, and in case the weather remains
fine, grounds which have never been
coursed upon and which are s.-*!d to be
just fitting for the occasion, will be tried
on Tuesday next. However, the large
gathering of snort lovers who will leave
this city at 9 a. m. on Monday morning
may look forward to three days of grand
sport. Judge Grace has been in training
for the occasion for several weeks and
says that he will be up with the dogs
from start to finish.
T. McHugh, the popular field steward,
contends that at this coming meeting he
will introduce a scheme by which the
crowd will have to keep from crowding
the slipper and chasing the dogs after
they are slipped.
A band of music will meet the Ingleside
Club on Its arrival at Merced and escort
the officers to headquarters.
That grand dog, For Freedom, It is said,
will be permanently withdrawn from the
coursing fields and placed in the stud.
Santa Alicia will be bred to him and for
tunate will be the man who will secure
any of the stock, as there is nothing of
higher class extant. Hurricane, a New
Zealand dog, will appear for the first
time to-day in the new park. It is said
that he is another such dog as For Free
dom and that he will sweep everything
before him this afternoon, but those new
comers are so very unreliable, you know.
The proposed match race between Vic
tor King and Volunteer on the plains of
Merced is off. The backers of Victor
King failed to put up their coin.
YACHTSMEN WILL GIVE
A MINSTREL SHOW
The minstrel performance for the bene
fit of the San Francisco Yacht Club will
be Riven in this city, and not in the club
house at Sausalito. as was at first in
tended. The committee having the enter
tainment in charge consists of Commo
dore Dr. T. L. Hill, Vice-Commodore G.
T. S. White, Financial Secretary W. G.
Morrow, F. B. Madison and L. Q. Haven.
An excellent performance will be given,
the fonow!ng having promised their ser
vices: Alexander Rosbnrough, William
Hines, John Cathcart, J. Putnam Jackson,
Robert C. Mitchell, Julian Thorne, Regi
nald Mason, Benjamin Tarbox, Frank
Thompson, Albert Borlini and William
O'Brien. W. M. Edgell, J. Ogllvie, George
Starr and Herbert Martin will sing solos.
The Jones brothers will also appear. The
entertainment will take place at Native
Sons' Hall, 414 Mason street, on Monday,
November 21. at 8:15 p. m., and dancing
will commence at 10:30 p. m. Reserved
seats may be obtained at Sherman &
Clay's on Saturday, November 19, and on
the day of the performance.
The directors of the San Francisco
Yacht Club have forwarded a communi
cation to the directors of the Pacific
Yacht Club, expressing their regret at the
approaching extinction of the Pacifies,
and thanking them for their courtesy in
permitting the San Franciscos to use
their clubhouse, boathouse and landing
stage during the season of 1897, after the
San Franciseos had lost their quarters by
the disastrous fire of March 2L. The San
Franciscos have offered the use of their
clubhouse to the Pacifies for the rest of
the fiscal year.
Commodore Dr. T. L. Hill's sloop, Cyg
nus and E. Donohoe's sloop Speedwell
are moored for the winter in Corte Ma
dera Creek near Larkspur. L, Q. Haven's
sloop Sappho and l'Hommedieu and Pel
amater's sloop Phoenicia will lie in Oak
land Creek. The San Francisco sloops,
Will o" the Wisp and Catherine, are at
winter moorings off Hurricane Gulch.
The sloop Phoenicia will be raffled off in
the near future.
MARINE ENGINEERS
ARE IN THE FIGHT
WILL CONTEST BIGHTS OF NEW
MADE CITIZENS.
An Attempt to Be Made to Revoke
Licenses Issued to Deck Offi
cials of Foreign Boats.
Indignation is running high In local
marine circles over the action of the Seat
tle officials in granting- immediate citi
zenph'p to the deck officers and engineers
of the four British steamers, the Vic
toria. Olympia, Taooma and Glengare, of
the Nofthern Pacific Company that were
j recently granted American register. In
j granting immediate citizenship to the
! thirty-two officers of the foreign boats
j they were enabled to get American li
censes and hold their positions under
I American registration to the disbarment
I of native craftsmen.
The local Marine Engineers' Benevolent
I Association took official cognizance of the
matter at a meeting held yesterday, and
every measure will be taken to nullify
what the association considers an unwar
ranted and unjust action on the part of
I the Government. President O'Brien, of
the association, said yesterday:
"We have no reflections to cast upon
the ability or worthiness of these men.
What Cuba's Loss Means to Spain.
The loss of Cuba means to Spain the loss of
the very (sustenance of the nation. , Already
her tax ridden people are crying : for bread.
In the same way the loss, of your once vigor
ous appetite means poverty and starvation to
your body. If any reader of this paper wishes
to be as hungry again as when a child, and
wants to fully ; enjoy hearty meals, we â¢ can
recommend Hostetter'a Stomach Hitters. It
cures indigestion, dyspepsia - and constipation.
Our complaint is that these officers have
been given American licenses without
having to pass even the requirements
that our native born and home-trained
men are obliged to compiy with. The law
provides that a foreign engineer must
have had his first papers for two years
before he is eligible to American license.
"These men were given citizenship as
soon as the British boats were i
under American register. There are thir
ty-two of them, and our complaint is that
they are crowding thirty-tw.> Americana
out of positions that should justly fall to
them, and we are going to do everything
that we can to have the licenses revoked.
"We have witnesses enough to prove
that the men in question are not nor have
they been citizens of this country, and
we are going to prove it in open court if
necessary when the case comes up in
Seattle."
An affidavit which sets forth the testi
mony of a man now in this city is being
prepared and wia bo forwarded to the
Washington authorities. It will set forth
that witness knew ore of the officers ftf t
flve years and that he has been for three
years past in the Arctic regions. With
this evidence it is hoped to prove per
jury by those who swore to the naturali
zation papers.
United States District Attorney Foote
was asked yesterday regarding the case,
but he said that as it would not come
within his jurisdiction he had not taken
the trouble to look up the law points in
volved.
CAPTAIN SEARLES IS ILL.
The Well-Known Navigator Afflicted
With a Cancerous Growth.
Captain Robert R. Searles, the well
known shipmaster of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company, occupies a ward in
the McNutt Hospital, where he is being
treated by Drs. Anderson and McNutt for
a severe cancerous affection of the throat.
This affection has been rapidly develop
ing and has spread to the end of the
tongue, necessitating an operation. At
first an effort was made to conceal the
true nature of the captain's Illness, but
Its .seriousness leaked out when, by order
of the physicians, he was taken from his
apartments in the Palace Hotel to the
hospiial. His condition was reported bet
ter last evening.
Captain Searles is one of the best known
of pioneer navigators of the Pacific. By
long and faithful service to the Pacific
Mai! Company on their Oriental route,
he has earned the distinction of "commo
dore captain" in their fleet of vessels.
ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL.
Vampires to Play Against British
Sailors at Golden Gate.
This afternoon at the Golden Gate
ground the Vampires will play an asso
ciation football match against a team of
apprentices from British ships now lying

tained by G. T. S. White, and the sailors'
eleven will be gathered together by the
Rev. Mr. Fullerton, chaplain of the Sea
men's Institute.
The Vampires' team will be made up as

The Vampires will almost certainly pay
a visit to Redding on Thanksgiving day
to play against the Xeswlck team. Early
next year the Keswick men, among
whom are some who are well known
among San Francisco cricketers, will
pay a visit to this city to play the return

THE SPIDER
HAS PLENTY
OF CONFIDENCE
Training Hard for His
Next Match.
MULLER IS IMPROVING
McFADDEN THINKS HE CAN
WHIP KAYNAHD.
Gossip of the Corbett-Sharkey Mill
and the Prospect of the Po
lice Interfering With
the Tight.
On Tuesday evening the Western Ath
letic Club will give its second boxing en
tertainment in Woodward's Pavilion.
Manager Murphy has figured out a first
class bill of athletic fare, and it goes
without saying that a large and enthusi
astic crowd will witness the mills.
"Spider" Kelly has been training hard at
the ocean beach for some weeks, and it
confidence will help to land him a winner
he will certainly have easy sailing, but
the "Spider" will need something more
substantial than confidence to defeat hia
opponent Muller, who, although rather
slow in movement, is a pretty stiff punch
er and a good judge of distance. Muller
has improved wonderfully in the past
year, and he will have a large following
of friends who will back him strongly to
â¢whin the agile "Spider." At any rate the
spectators can rely upon getting "a run
for their money," as there are two first
class preliminary bouts which may prove
just as interesting as the event of the
evening.
Jockey Maynard and "Kid" McFadden
will certainly put up a stiff argument.
McFadden is confident that he can whip
Maynard in a ten-round "go," but May
nard laughs at the idea and says that
when he met McFadden In Woodward's
Pavilion he was out of condition and waa
consequently a bit weak at the finish,
but even so he scored five points to Mc-
Fadden's one in each of the rounds they
fought. Maynard now contends that ha
will be in fine fettle when he faces "the
kid" on Tuesday evening, and unless a
lucky blow places him out of the game he
expects to win easily on points.
Tom Sharkey is very confident of whip
ping Corbett on the evening of the 22d
inst., but good judges of pugilism think
differently.
Corbett is probably the cleverest big
man who ever entered a ring, not except
ing Jem Mace, who was considered in his
day the king of boxers. Jim will easily
avoid Sharkey's swings and rushes, and
continuous jabbing will certainly arouse
the sailor's ire and that will mean rough
fighting on the part of Sharkey.
It will not surprise many of the sport
ing authorities of this city to hear that
the police put a stop to the fight in the
early part of the battle, and that the ref
eree awards to Corbett a decision on
points. Still, if the sailor can be held
in check by his seconds the contest may
go on to the end of the twenty-five
rounds, and if so Corbett will certainly be
given the decision, as those who are con
versant with the game are aware that he
can outclass Sharkey in boxing, and
points must count if a knock-out is not
registered.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
F 90S Broadway. Nov. 11.
The State Industrial Exposition will
open at the exposition building to-mor
row. This evening 1 there was a trade and
labor parade on the streets participated
In by local manufacturers, merchants
and producers, and also by some of the
-political clubs.
The parade was in charge of Grand
Marshal A. H. Breed, with John Mitchell
for chief of staff. The following: promi
nent citizens were the aids: William B.
Prinze. Clarence Orowell. Abe P. Leach,
P. M. Fisher, Marston Campbell, George
W. Hoguet, C. K. King, Charles E. Snook,
Kay Baker, Warren M. English. Arthur
K. Wilson, A. S. McDonald. George F.
Xeece, J. W. Laymance, Robert M. Price,
W. V. Harrington, M. D. Hyde, Ed. G.
Vlnzent, W. 11. Dickenson, L.. A. Steph
enson.
Prominent in the parade were some of
the floats of Oakland merchants. Many
firms and breweries sent a dozen deco
orated wagons, and, with red fire, fire
works and music, the streets presented a
lively appearance for over an hour.
One of the features of the parade was
the Oakland Typographical Union, the
men of which marched as an escort to
the ladies in carriages. Several large
concerns from San Francisco sent over
delegations and also had exhibits at the
fair.
In addition to many floats the Fire De
partment, gayly decorated, turned out,
the Police Department led the procession,
and all the city officials and Supervisors,
members of the Merchants' Exchange
and Board of Trade were in carriages.
The trades unions and labor organiza
tions made a good .showing, and one of
the most interesting divisions was that
of the cycling clubs. The Acme and Re
liance, which made such a splendid show
ing in the Market-street parade in San
Francisco, repeated their success to
night.
The interior of the exposition is being
rapidly completed, and by Monday nearly
all the exhibits will be complete. The
programme for the first week is as fol
lows:
Saturday. November 12, has been named
Jubilee 'lay. November 14. Press Club day;

day.
Under the direction of William J. Mc-
Coy. the exposition orchestra will give a
concert each afternoon and evening.
CONTEST OVER A GIRL.
Craigie Sharp Appointed Guardian of
Ida Francis.
OAKLAND. Nov. H.â There was quite
a contest over the appointment of
a guardian for Miss Ida Francis,
In Judge Ellsworth's court this after
noon. The pirl is 16 years of a.ge,
and her parents, who reside on Central
avenue near Webster street, Alameda,
tried very hard to retain guardianship of
her. The girl, however, went on the wit
ness stand and testified that she had been
most cruelly treated by her mother.
"I refused to live with my parents any
more." said she, "because my mother
â¢would beat me terribly. My parents were
cruel to me. Why they would just as
leave kill you as not."
At least a dozen witnesses were exam
ined aa to the good character and fitness
of Mr. and Air?. Francis, to retain posses
sion of their daughter, but all this proved
of no avail, for lnte in the afternoon
Judge Ellsworth appointed Craigle Sharp
as guardian, at the request of the girl
herself.

Uninteresting labyrinth of complications, â

title to most of the marsh land and the I
city's water front is involved. Judge Og- I
den, before whom the case was tried, has |
given each side twenty deays in which to j

A TEST CASE
OVER MELROSE
EXPLOSION
A Corporation Sues
the Powder Works.
FIRST OF ITS KIND FILED
THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY ASKS
HEAVY DAIIAGES.
Hundreds of Suits Will Depend Upon
the Outcome, as Many Homes
Were Likewise Demol
ished.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway. Nov. 11.
The question of liability of the Western
Fuse and Explosive Company for the
damage ' n private property on account of
tho Melrose explosion will now be tested
in the courts, through a suit filed this
afternoon in the Superior Court by the
San Francisco Theological Seminary, a
corporation.
According: to the complaint filed by At
torneys Williamson and Livingston Jenks.
the plaintiff owned a two-story frame
dwelling and barn on Clark street, near
B street, Melrose, which on July 19, 1898,
was "shattered, overthrown, demolished
and destroyed" by an explosion on the
premises of defendant corporation, where
by plaintiff was injured and sustained
damages in the sum of $5000.
The complaint also sets forth that at
the time of the terrible explosion the
Western Fuse and Explosive Company
was engaged in the business of manufac
turing, storing and selling dynamite,
nitro-glyeerir.e, gunpowder, fuse a.nd oth
er explosives in the town of Melrose, in
: roximity to and within 100 yards
of plaintiffs dwelling, and in a thickly
settled and populous neighborhood. And
that tht 1 defendant negligently and care
lessly conducted said business, whereby
an .'xplosion occurred upon the premises
last July.
The horrible details of the explosion,
when liK'lu human beings were hurled
into eternity and nearly 1100,000 worth of
private proper^ destroyed, are still fresh
in tho memory 'of the public.
H- cently the Melrose Protective Asso
ciation whs organized for the purpose of
prosecuting a test Bult for damages
against the fuse company, and Nusbaum
er i'c Reed were retained as attorni ys, but
no legal proceedings were commenced, and
the present suit will now serve as a test
case.
CYCLIST'S NARROW
ESCAPE FROM DEATH
WAS SPEEDING TOWABD A
LIVE ELECTRIC WIRE.
Two Memoers of One Family Exposed
to Danger at the Same
Spot.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Broadway, Nov. 11.
The fearful tragedy that occurred in
Alameda a few weeks ago when a live
electric wire instantly killed a woman
was nearly repeated last night on Tele
graph avenue. Edwin DeGolia, an insur
ance man of San Francisco, was speeding
to his home on his wheel, when he heird
a shout from another bicyclist to (Un
mount instantly. Mr. DeGolia at first
thought he was to be held up by a high
wayman on a wheel, but this illusion was
soon dispelled when he saw a live wire
lying on the track sputtering out bright
sparks and showing that it was highly
charged.
DeGolia dismounted just in time to avoid
certain death, for it would have fteen ab
solutely impossible for him to have es
caped alive had the metal portion of his
wheel come in contact with the deadly
wire.
The wire was repaired, and to-day an
other member of the same family. Attor
ney Darwin C. DeGolia, had just as o.ir
row an escape at the same spot. While
Attorney DeGolia was riding down to his
office the wire again broke and fell just
twenty feet ahead of his wheel. He saw
the danger and managed to steer clear of
it. although in doing so he grazed his
wheel against an electric car. He was
not hurt by the collision.
Justice "Watson Injured.
OAKLAND, Nov. 11.â Justice John Wes
ton of Walnut Creek Township was seri
ously injured to-day by being thrown
from his cart near Hager's stables, oppo
site Shattuck avenue, Temescal. His
horse had become frightened and dashed
down the street, the rig iinally colliding
with a telegraph pole. The injured man
was taken to the Receiving Hospital and
his condition is believed critical. Blood
has been flowing freely from the right
i ar, indicating a hemorrhage In the head.
There is also a serious and ugly gash on
the back of the head.
Funeral of Bobert Conway.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 11.â The funeral of the
late Robert Conway, whose death was
caused by a fall from a train, took place
this morning. The services were conduct
ed at St. Joseph's Church by Rev. Father
O'Connor. Alameda Parlor, N. S. G. \V.,

ployes of the South Pacific Coast Rail
road. There were many handsome floral
pieces. Conductors Fielding and Sam
Davis were honorary pallbearers. The
casket bearers were T. R. Hansen, A. V.
Fisher, Conductor James Case, Judge A.
F. St. Sure and Charles Nelson.
An Instructor Stops r. Fire.
BERKELEY, Nov. 11.â But for the
timely presence of Dr. R. S. Norris, In
structor in the cr" >TV nstry department of
the University of California, the large
chemistry building on the college campus
v uui'i have gone up in flames. It appears
that one of the students in tne sophomore
laboratory had carelessly thrown into his
iocker a piece of not asbestos on top of a
rag saturated with oil. Late last night
ihe material took fire and th" flames
spread to the woodwork of the laboratory
desks. By chance Dr. Norris happened
to pass by the buiimng, and noticing tne
smail blaze inside hastened within and
extinguished it. But slight damage was
done.

HIS DIAMONDS
Charges Against Miss
Bissell.
SHE RAN OFF WITH PLEDGES
QUEER STORY OF ATWOOD'S
HOUSEKEEPER.
Bedecked With Gold and Diamonds,
She Took Flight From Her
Sacramento Domicile to
Oakland.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 11.
If ever the fondest affection, nursed In
the fields of dalliance, existed hetween J.
B. Atwood of Sacramento and Bernlce
Blssell, alias Alice Brannan, things have
mightily changed since then, judging from
the revelations of a queer category of
charges preferred by the former against
the latter in a suit commenced to-day in
the Superior Court of Alamcda County.
From a careful reading of the complaint
filed by Attorneys Pipher & Holl of the
Capitol City, on behalf of Atwood it would
appear that the latter is the proprietor of
a store tha portals of which are graced
by three gilded balls. And it Is sug
gestive of an intimation at least, that At
wood showered many golden and diamond
trinkets upon his fair housekeeper.
The complaint alleges that until a month
ago the cruel Bernlce was employed as
housekeeper by plaintiff, and was trusted
by him, but she fled suddenly one day,
and with her went gold earrings, a lady's
gold watch, a bracelet hung with 12 50
gold pieces, a band ring, a solitaire and
cluster diamond rings, etc., all of which
the complaint sets forth were tortlnusly
and wrongfully held, and were pledges
as security for the repayment of money
loaned by him to various persons in divers
sums.
Plaintiff had In due legal form asked
his fair housekeeper t<> give him back
his gold, but she refused and Is now re-
Biding In this city. He brings no crimi
nal charge against defendant, but prays
for the recovery of his golden trinkets
and $10) damn go?.
The caso, should it ever come to trial,
will prove a most spicy morsel for the
sensation monger.
BOULDERS WRECK A ROOF.
A Blast at the Laundry Farm Quar
ries Creates Havoc in the
Vicinity.
ATvAMKDA. Nov. 11.â The roof of a
house on the Fritz P>oohmer ranch on the
Redwood Canyon road, was stove In last
night by a shower of boulders. The house
is occupied by one of the ranch hands and
Ills family nnd were it not for the fact
that They were downstairs some member
would have been seriously injured. The
rocks and boulders were scattered over the
Boehmer ranch by a terrific blast at the
rock quarry, which is about 1000 feet from
the Boehmer place on the opposite side
of Laundry Farm Canyon.
Ont! mass of rock struck the roof of the
farm house, crushing it into kindling
wood and passing through the ceiling
into the sleeping rooms in the upper story.
I'laster and laths were scattered all over
the rooms and much of the furniture was
wrecked.
The occupants of the house were aston
ishf-d when the boulders came through
the roof, and thought their homo bad
been struck by a meteor. One of the
rocks weighed over lf>o pounds.

Employe.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 11.â George Smith and
James Cavanaugh, employes of the Street
Department, unearthed a box of dyna
mite yesterday afternoon near the north
erly approach to the Bay Farm Island
bridge. If it had not been for the fact
that Smith had had experience in han
dling the explosive, the chances are the
two men would have been blown into
eternity.
The men were leveling off a sand dune
wnen Cavanaugh's shovel struck some
thing that refused to yield. The sand
was cleared away exposing an old fruit
box crumbling with decay. Cavanaugh
drove his pick into the end of it to pull it
out of the way. The pick easily passed
through the box, but grazed something
underneath. Further investigation un
earthed a smaller box under the old fruit
ca. u (:.
As soon as Smith saw It he shouted a
warning to his companion. There had
been a label on the outside of the box,
but all save the word dynamite had been
obliterated. The box was removed with
the utmost care and opened with the
greatest precaution. When the lid was re
moved thirty-two sticks of dynamite
were exposed. The explosive was dumped
into San Leandro Bay.
Various theories are advanced to ac
count for the presence of the box of
dynamite. The police are Inclined to be
lieve that it is a relic of the railroad
strike of 1893. The narrow gauge rail
road bridge over San LeanUro Bay is but
a short distance away. The strikers
made considerable demonstration in the
vicinity of where the dynamite was un
earthed, yesterday, and during- the time
of the trouble information reacheu the
officials that an effort was to be made to
blow up the, bridge. It was Immediately
patrolled by a strong guard, both day and
night, and It is presumed the striker's had
no opportunity to carry out their terrible
plans.
Another theory is that the stuff was
buried by Chinese fishermen, who used to
carry on the unlawful method of catching
i;sh by discharging dynamite In the
water. While it was evident that the box
had been underground for several years,
its contents were In a perfect state of
preservation, and would undoubtedly have
made themselves felt if Cavanaugh's
pick had disturbed them.
Returned From Kotzebue.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 11.â F. E. Brow, form
erly engaged in business in this city, ar
rived here Saturday from an eventful trip
to Kotzebuo Sound. He says in all of his
party's explorations, which were very ex
tensive, only colors were found and no
gold was secured. Many of the prospec
tors were glad to sell their outfits lor suf
ficient to pay their passage back to civili
zation. Five members of Mr, Brow's party
lost their lives by the swamping of a
small boat in Hoffman Inlet.

SOCIETY FALLS
OUT OVER A
STATELY ELM
Mrs. Gifford Writes to
the Council.
NOT A NEIGHBORHOOD ROW
MR, STONE'S TREE SAID TO BE A
SOURCE OF DAMAGE.
The Lady and Her Friends and Mr.
Stone and His Friends Will
Argue Before the City
Fathers.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 11.
In an aristocratic portion of the city
an old elm tree has long been a bone of
contention. It lias now oecome a matter
to be Judicially determined as to whether
it shall be allowed to grow or be cut
down.
This fine old elm Is in front of the resi
dence of E. P. Stone. He has for a neigh
bor Mrs. W. M. Gifford, and Mrs. Gifford
declares that Mr. Stone's elm is destroy
ing her sidewalk, paralyzing the growth
of her lawn and doing various oth<-r ob
noxiour. things. City Clerk 'IVmpkina ha*
received from the lady the following loi
ter, directed to the City Council:
Not belne satisfied with the disposal of a
communication sent by myself to your honor
able body, dated August 22, IS9S, i would again
ask that action be taken In regard to the re
moval of a tree that Is destroying my prop
erty.
1 have been told by members of the Council
that the reason given for not removing the tree
Is that It was simply a neighborhood quarrel,
and that there was no great damage done. 1
know we are living In a wonderful age, but
I was not aware that a neighborhood quarrel
(of the existence of which I am in ignorance)
could cause the roots of a. tree to destroy side
walks and cover lawns. Therefore I would
again most respectfully petition that action be
taken In the removal of, said tree, believing If
you are able to demand of the property-owners
that street*, sewers and sidewalks be repaired
you are authorized to protect such property
when i>etitloned to do so by said property
owners.
Awaiting your reply. I am. very respectfully,
MBS. W. '.:. OIJTORD.
On file with the City Council is another
petition asking that the old elm tree be
allowed to grow in peace. The Street Su
perintendent has officially examined the
roots of the tree and has reported that
some of the roots have been cut, but that
they had not died. Mr. Stone has in
formed the Street Superintendent that
rather than let the city's woodman fell his
tree he would pay for any damage to
Mrs. GMfford's sidewalk or to her lawn
just as orten as she mfsht desire it.
Councilman Woodward believes the tree
should be cut down. It is in his ward,
and he says that it has injured Mrs. Gif
ford's sewer. The Council has decided to
hold a "tree night" and all the patlea in
volved in this aristocratic controversy
will appear before the city fathers and
show cause why the tree should and
should not be cut down. During the past
few years there have been several con
troversies over trees, and the general pol
icy of the Council has" been to preserve
all trees except where it can be definitely
shown they are doing positive damage.

SCHOOL BOARD
ORDERS DEBTS
TO BE SETTLED
Overlooks the Lack of
Money.
A FINANCIAL HOCUS-POCUS
CBEDITOBS MT7ST RECKON WITH
THE AUDITOR
The Queer Board Has Allowed Bills
for Eifty Thousand Dollars
While It Is Practically
Bankrupt.
The Board of Education, at an ad
journed meeting held last night, decided
to pay Its debts.
The conclusion was not reached, how
ever, without much dJscussion and many
misgivings. Some of the members of the
board thought that the procedure was un
wise, inasmuch as the aforesaid debts
were but dimly outlined in the report of
the finance committee and were therefore
imperfectly understood. Director Head
made the most pronounced kick:
"I understand," said he, "that there Is
a possibility that the bondsmen of the
members of this board will be held re
sponsible for the extravagances which
have marked the last two years. The
Grand Jury is investigating the bills of
the Board of Education and it is unwise
at this time, to act upon the accounts.
In the past, members of the School Board
have acted as though they were ac
countable to no one for their official acts.
Th y have carried things with a high
hand. .Bills have uten held back for many
months, of which the board knew noth
ing. Hire to-night the tinance commit
tee comes In with a formidable report,
giving a list of hundreds ..f debts which
it is alleged that the Board of Kducation
is responsible for. I don't know when
these debts were contracted, whether the
supplies wt re purchased this year or last
year. There is a niugnilicent jumble of
big bills and little bills. I ven
ture the assertion that there never
was before in the history of
Han Francisco Buch a remarkable finan
cial report handed in to any public board.
We are asked to vote to pass a thou
sand hills at once of which we know
absolutely nothing. I have heard that
some of the accounts represented in the
list were, Indeed, contracted last year and
the courts have held repeatedly that the
bills of one year shall not bo paid out
of the appropriation for another year.
while 1 was a member of the supply
committee of this hoard T never had a
word t" say about the supplies purchased.
The chairman ignored the "ther members
of the committee. It has become a habit
for the chairmen of the supply commit
tee and the buildings and grounds com
mittee to buy thousands of dollars'
worth of material without consulting the
board at aIL The system is wrong and
1 ph-ill vote against the resolution to pay
all of t.iis mass of bills in a bunch."
l resident Harrington stated that the
City and County Auditor would sefiise to
pay any more bills than the law permits
under the one-twelfth act. Dr. Ragan in
sis ed that the bills should all be paid.
The money was duo the merchants of
this city. Carew held the same view.
When the final vote was taken on the
question of paying all of the debts of the
board, aggregating Jih.'jTi. 1 ?. there were four
votes agalnsi the measure, viz., those of
President Harrington, Head, Hammond
and Derham. It was declared carried,
bowever, by seven votes.
Included in the list of debts presented
to the board last night were items for
school furniture aggregating over $7000
and another Item of $11,980 for a school
lot in Noe Valley district. It is under
stood that there will be a shortage of
$35,000 to $40,000 in the funds available for
paying these bills.
Miss f:. Orookham was transferred from
the Monroe Primary to a class in Han
cook School. A new class was formed in
the Fremont School. Miss N. Gambitz
was transferred from AVebster Primary to
Fremont School. Miss Roberts of the un
assigned class was given a class in John
Swett Grammar School.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
LEGISLATOR TO CAUCUS
Seek to Obtain Concerted Action on
Questions Affecting Their
District.
I,OS ANGELES. Nov. 11.â A caucus of
members of the Legislature elected in the
six counties of Southern California is to
be held shortly In this city for the pur
pose, ostensibly, of agreeing upon some
plan whereby concerted action may be
obtained at the next session on all meas
ures affecting Southern California. San
Diego County has a normal school and
Los Angeles has a similar institution.
San Bernardino County has Highland
Asylum and Los Angeles County has
Whlttier State School. The idea is to ob
tain as much consideration at the hands
of the Legislature for these institutions
as possible.
L. H. Valentine, who has been re-elect
ed from the Seventy-fourth Assembly
District by an increased plurality, is an
ay uved candidate for speaker of that
body. His friends will make an effort to
boom his candidacy for the speakership
\s ! eh tli- 1 caucus is convened.
There probably will be some little clash
of Senatorial interests. Seven Republican
members elected from Los Angeles Coun
ty are instructed for Bulla. U. S. Grant
Jr. has three votes from San Diego Coun
ty. When the caucus shall have been
convened there probably will be an ef
fort made by these two Senatorial candi
dates and their friends to bring into their
respective folds such Assemblymen and
Senators as may be willing to pledge
themselves for a few ballots on the Sen
atorship. The caucus will be held in the
rooms of the Chamber of Commerce in
this city.
To-morrow evening the Columbia Club
will tender a non-partisan reception to
Henry T. Gage, Governor-elect; Tirey L.
Ford, Attorney General-elect, and Judge
Walter Van Dj-ke, Associate Justice
elect. Citizens of Los Angeles have been,
invited, regardless of political affiliations.
The affair will be informal, but arrange
ments have been perfected to entertain
large numbers of people.
ELECTION FRAUDS IN
SANTA CLARA COUNTY
Good Government League Will Prose
cute Those Who Are
Deemed Guilty.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 11.â The returns show
th-it L-angford (Rea Republican) is elected
Sheriff over James H. Lyndon by 151
votes, but the latter's friends claim he
has been "counted out." It is alleged tnat
in one precinct thirty-five Bollinger votes
were counted for L.angford and in other
places similar irregularities have been
noted. J. W. Gas 3 has been elected City
Justice over W. T. Aggeler by twenty
four votes, and in his case the same
charges are made.
The Republican Good Government
League will begin a contest to seat J. H.
Lj in.on as Sheriff and Aggeler as City
Justice. The vote for City Attorney and
for Supervisor in the First District will
be recounted. â¢ It is claimed gross frauds
were perpetrated in an attempt to elect B.
A. Herrington Dis'rict Attorney and
George E. Rea, a brother of "Jim" Rea,
Supervisor. There seem 3to be abundant
proof at hand to substantiate the charges.
Citizens from all over the county have
volunteered their services and hundreds bt
dollars have been subscribed to defray
the expense of a recount. The league is
determined to punish election officers found
guilty of crookedness and steps looking to
that end are about to be taken.
Will Celebrate the Victory.
ALAMEDA, Nov. ILâ The Young Men's
Republican Club of West Alameda, which
played a prominent part In the late cam
paign will have a big jollification meeting
Saturday night at their wigwam, the old
Neptune Gardens. The invitations read:
' Our work is done, our battle won! and
you are asked to be present at our wig
wam Saturday, November 12. to join us in
our love feast and assist us in shaking
hands with ourselves."
Alleged Cattle-Thief Held.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 11.â The exam
ination of Harry Flournoy of San Ga
briel, accused of having been the organ
izer of a gang- of cattle thieves which has
operated successfully in the San Gabriel
Valley for a long time, was held before
Justice Young to-day, and he was bound
over to the Superior Court in bonds of
$2500. Romoldo Lopez, whose examination
was set for to-day and who turned State' 3
evidence implicating Flournoy, was taken
back to Jail without an examination. It
is hoped he will make a rurther confes
sion. He steadily refuses to make a
statement Implicating his brother-in
law, Aldetris, who was captured with
him.

Cases of Typhoid Fever.
"Wallace Bonaclnl, who has been seri
ously 111 for seven weeks with typhoid
fever in its worst form at his home in
this city, was able to sit upÂ»for an hour
or two yesterday. The disease was con
tracted while Bonacini was employed In
the mining camp of the Iron Mountain
Copper Company near Reddinpr, Shasta
County. The young man was unable to
talk very much, owing to weakness, and
â¢was disinclined to state the causes which
led to it, but enough was learned from
other sources to show that he was one of
many who have suffered from drinking
water that had either been contaminated
by defective drainage in the camp or was

The water impregnated with probably

of the mountain, and an iÂ«-ea of the im

when he is troubled with headaches, nerv-

These symptoms are by no means trivial,
and are indicative of disorders that may
lead to consumption, nervous prostration,
'malarial troubles or some serious blood
disease. Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Dis-
covery is the best of all medicines for men
and women who suffer in this way. It re-

Mrs. Rebecca F. Gardner, of Grafton, York

weighed 125 pounds. I was taken sick and re-
duced in health and broke out with a disease
which my doctor said was eczema. I fell away
to 90 pounds. I began using Dr. Pierces Golden
Medical Discovery, and now I weigh 140 pounds
and am well."
Constipation often causes sickness. Dr.
Pierces Pleasant Pellets cure constipation.
One little " Pellet " is a gentle laxative, and

It is practically a story of wholesale
poisoning, for it is estimated thai nearly
one hundred men left In various stages
of sickness out of the four or live hundred
in the camp, and all were more or less
attlicted. ,
It has been reported that two or three
deaths have occurred, the victims being
employes in the mines who had partaken
freely"of the water, but it was impossible
to verify the statement, although it is
highly probable. It suffices to say that
the water in Iron Mountain town is an
swerable for the dangerous Illness of a
large number of men emnloyed there.
Some were confined to the nospltal in
the camp, but lack of proper medicine
compelled them to leave. The druggist of
the camp, McLaughlin by name, is said
to be sick at St. Luke's HoPDitaJ in this
city, but the officials of that institution
denied all knowledge of the case. A man
named Peal is another who is suffering
in St. Mary's Hospital with typhoid fever,
superinduced by drinking the water in
Iron Mountain camp. Edward Blake was
ill two weeks with a bad attack of ma
laria, but he has gone back to brave the
danger again.
Another bad case is that of James Don
ahue, who has been at St. Gary's Hos
pital for two weeks with typhoid fever.
His attendant. Mr. Finnegan. says that
Donahue was in Iron Mountain town only
two weeks when he contracted the dis
ease. Finnegan says that if steps are not
taken to remedy the evil by introducing
a proper system of sewerage in the town
and pure water provided the Iron Moun

General Greely is one of the most dls
tingxrished officers in the service. He was
In active service throuciout the recent '
Santiago campaign, and his work was of
Inestimable value to the Government.
During the time when the fleets of Ad
mirals Schley and Sampson were seeking
to capture Admiral Cervera's vessels
the signal corps furnished much of j
the information as to the whereabouts of '
the Spanish vessels.
General Greely has risen from the ranks
to his present high position, for at th-*
outbreak of the civ,. War he joined the
Nineteenth Massachusetts? Volunteer In
fantry as a private in Company B. Sub
sequently he was promoted to corporal
and later sergeant. From 1861 to 1*63 he
served with the Army of the Potomac
ana took part in the siege of Yorktown,
the action at West Point and numerous
other engagements, being wounded in the
battle of White Oak Swamp. He served
also in the Maryland campaign, and at
the battle of Antietam was again
wounded.
In March, 15=63. he was promoted second
lieutenant of the Eighty-first Colored In
fantry. In April. 3864, he was made first
lieutenant, becoming captain one year
later. At the close of the war he "was
honorably mustered out of the volunteer
service-, having been appointed second
lieutenant of the Twenty-sixth United
States Infantry of Regulars. Later he
served with the Fifth Cavalry and was
brevetted major of volunteers for meri
torious and faithful services. In 1569
General Greely served on the Western
frontier and in 1871 was sent to Omaha
as a staff officer attached to the Signal
Corps. On March 3, 1887, he was ap
pointed to his present position, chief sig
nal officer of the United States army.
Irlor to this, however, General Greely
had gained additional honors owing to
his Arctic explorations. in 1881 he was
PlacecL in charge of an expedition having
for its" object the establishment of a me
teorological station at Lady Franklin
Bay. Jhe party unfortunate!-.- was ship
wreckod, and after having undergone ter
rible hardships was filially rescued. Since
thf-n General Greely has made many
searches liito Arctic conditions and has
furnished much valuable information to
the scientific world. During his stay in
California General Greely will pay a visit
to his brother-in-law, L.. G. Nesmith, U c
banker, of San Jose.

SHOOTING IN SUNNYSIDE.
Neighborly Disputes Culminate in
Shotgun and Rifle Practice.
The neighborly disputes of Herman Tie
gel ami William I. Colvert culminated in
the use of a shotgun and a rifle at 7
o'clock last evening, on Spreckels avenue,
in the Sunnyside section of the city. Tie
gel, who resides at No. 12, and Colvert,
who lives next door at No. 10, have wives
and children, and as a consequence neigh
borly disputes arose over the merits and
demerits of each household. These little
disputes finally Involved the wives of
both households and as a further conse
quence the husbands took the parts of
their better halves to such an extent as
to become enemies. From bad to worse
the troubles augmented until Tiegel is
said to have informed the wife and
daughters of Colvert that they would be
minus the head of the house, as he In
tended to make work for the Coroner by
killing Colvert.
This information was imparted by Col
vert's daughter to her father on his re
turn from work yesterday afternoon. Not
desiring to be killed without a chance at
his enemy, Colvert entered the back door
of his residence and armed himself with a
rifle. He had no sooner done so than Tie
gel appeared on the scene armed with a
shotgun. A few words were exchanged
between the two men, when, according to
Colvert's story. Tiegel raised his gun to
his shoulder. He had no sooner done so
than Colvert fired at him. but missed the
target. This caused Tiegel to make a
hasty retreat for the shelter of his house,
from which position he discharged his
shotgun. The reports of the guns at
tracted the attention of Corporal M. Shan
ahan and Officers A. Wingler and Thomas
O'Connell, who were on duty in the vicin
ity.
The guardians of the peace arrived in
time to prevent further hostilities, un
their arrival at the scene they were con
fronted by two excited armed men, but
the presence' of the men in uniform
quieted the bloodthirsty combatants ana
they peaceably submitted to arrest. They
were taken to the Seventeenth-street Po
lice Station, where each made his state
ment to Captain Gillen. Both were ordered
locked upâ Colvert for an assault with a
deadly weapon and Tiegel with threats
against life.

a group of quiet horsemen was turn

a white wooden ball.
The Reds were the most aggressive
and in a moment had the sphere in
their opponents' territory. They
worked it rapidly down the field with
but slight loss of ground and finally

one point.
The second goal was made by
"Joe" Tnbln. who secured the ball
and despite the efforts of Charley
Dunphy to head him off, scored
again for the Reds. Harry Simpkins

DEATH CAME TO
THEM IN OLD AGE
Three Friends of a Lifetime Pass
Away Within a Few Hours
of Each Other.
THE men of '49 are rapidly passing away and soon there will not
be a member of the old Vigilance Committee left. Jules David,
"No. 4," and treasurer of the organization, died at his home last
Thursday. His lifelong friend, Nicholas Van Bergen, followed him
a few hours later, and Victor David, who came here from Chico
to see his sick brother, fell dead upon beholding his corpse.
Jules David was born in New Orleans seventy-six and his brother sev
enty-two years ago, while Nicholas Van Bergen was born in Germany
seventy-seven years ago. All three came to California in the days of gold
and all eventually went into business. In 1853 Jules David was a member
of the banking house of Abel Guy & Co. and one of the foremost men
in San Francisco. V.'hen the Vigilance Committee was formed he was made
tn;i surer of the organization and worked hard to establish law and order.
In doing so he incurred the enmity of a number of Southern roughs who
thought he ought to have sided with them instead of the law and order
people because they all came from Louisiana. When everything was run
ning smoothly in San Francisco these Southerners began to make trouble
for the Davids, and in consequence Jules moved to Victoria, B. C. While
journeying through British Columbia some of the toughs whom he had
helped to drive out of California waylaid him, beat him, and left him for
dead. He was laid up for six months from the effects of his wounds and
carried the marks of them to his grave.
After a few years in British Columbia Mr. David decided to return to
California. On his arrival here he went into the wine and liquor business on
Front street, and was at work up to within a week of his death. He and Mr.
Van Bergen met daily and began to fail about the same time. Both had
rounded out their allotted span of life and for an hour each day used to
tell each other how this faculty was failing and the other was affected.
Both were taken sick about the same time and, as before stated, died with
â  In a few. hours of each other.
Victor David, whose home was at Chico, was informed of his brother's
illness by telegraph and at once came to the city. On his arrival at the
â¢ family residence. 1301 Laguna street, he was told that his brother had
â  passed away. He went into the bedroom to look upon the face of the
dead. He was seen to pass his hand over his forehead and then drop to
the floor. He was carried into an adjoining room and a physician sum
â  moned, but it was all in vain and in a few hours he* joined the great
â  majority.
Thus did these three old friends, all of whom had passed the three
â  score and ten limit, die within a few hours of each other.
Jules David leaves a widow and a daughter to mourn his loss. His
nephew, Charles J. Gaillard, is cashier of the Comptoir National D'Es
â  compte de Paris in this city, while another nephew, Albert H. Gaillard is
â  bookkeeper of the Hibernla Savings and Loan Society. The word of the
- deceased was his bond and no one stood higher In the community than he

Lutheran Church on Monday morning. Mr; Van Bergen, leaves four sons

- George of Stoll & Van Bergen, and William.
in their opponents' territory repeat
edly, but dashing "Joe" Tobin or
some one of his team mates would
always extricate them at the critical
moment. Mr. Baldwin drove the ball
down the field, and holding off Wal
ter Hobart, scored the first goal for
his team. He also scored the second
one.
Joe Tobin started the play, rushing
the ball up the field with Dunphy
after him. The ball was graduaJly
worked back, "Dick" Tobin, one of
the coolest and brainiest of players,
doing wonderful execution. At one
time Mr. Baldwin made a splendid
drive for goaJ, but missed the post by
inches. Dick Tobin then ran the ball
up the field and after a hot scrim
mage Mr. Baldwin finally scored.
This was all the Whites could score,
â while the Reds made seven goals In
all when time was finally called.
There were a number of pretty
filays during the game, which were
oudly applauded by the spectators.
In one of these Mr. Baldwin hit the
ball straight for the goal. It was
stopped by Walter Hobart, who
drove it back. Harry Simpkins
picked it up on the fly and drove It
on.
The players have promised to re
peat the 'game at some future time.
They are anxious to have the mem
bers of the San Francisco Riding
School take up the great sport and
play them a match game even with a
handicap allowance.
Many representatives of the fash
ionable set witnessed the thrlllLng
sport. Some came on bicycles, some
on horseback, while others were in
carriages. The players drove to the
grounds in the Burlingame Club
coach, Frank Carolan being the
relnsman.

NO SWEETS IN
THE BOXES FOR
THE SOLDIERS
Trouble for the Boys
in Manila.
DANGER IN CHRISTMAS GIFTS
ARMY OFFICERS SOUND A NOTE
OF WARNING.
Extreme Care Should Be Taken in
Sending Edibles to the Troops
in Tropical Coun
tries.
The steamer St. Paul, when she steams
out through the Golden Gate for Manila
next Thursday, will carry hundreds of
Christmas boxes to the boys in blue In
the far off Philippines.
The boys will appreciate these tokens
from home to the fullest extent, but their
reception will be the cause of no little
concern to the medical staff of the army,
for it is anticipated that the contents will
be apt to work more harm than good.
Indulgent parents, doting sisters and
lovt-lorn sweethearts, mindful of the
stories of scant rations that have come
up from the islands, are expected to take
full advantage of this opportunity to
tickle the palates of their absent ones,
with the result that the St. Paul is ex
pected to carry out the most indigestable
cargo that ever left this port, unless one
takes into consideration a load of scrap
iron or something of that sort.
People, in making up their Christmas
boxes, are unlikely to remember that
Yuletide in the tropics is in the midst of
the summer or unhealthy season, and will
send off enough candy, nuts, tinned plum
pudding, mince meat, pate de foie gras
cheese and such provender to make half
the army sick.
The feeding of the soldiers in the trop
ics has already caused the department
much concern,' The regular army rations

CantalnLynn of the Commissary Depart
ment returned from Manila and hurried
Sr, to Washington to confer with the au
thorities In regard to preparing a suitable
ration for the men in the tropics. Pork
Â»m beans corned beef and potatoes and
â¢?h articles of diet, while excellent in
?F2 â¦ a Â£nirftte zone, are the cause of much
sVckne mm s P in the Philippines, and it is the
fntention to provide rations in keeping
with the climatic conditions. not to be
With this fact in vfcw it is not to be
Jn^mi at that thUre is considerable
the shipping of delicacies by
friends to the troops in Mania.
Army officers who have returned from
thfre among them Surgeon Rethers of
the First California Volunteers; say that
every care should be taken to send only
what will agree with the men during the
helÃht of summer. Eschew all sweets, is
their advice, and send only such articles
as canned soups, canned turkey and
chicken, cocoa, lime juice, vegetables and
lunch meats, including tongue and
deviled ham. Canned plum pudding
candy and such delicacies should find noi
place In these Christmas boxes, although^
they would no doubt be hailed with joy
by the recipients.
It is a difficult matter to select proper
articles for such a purpose, but these re
turned army officers say it would be much
better to exercise care now and make
some denials than it would to have the
soldiers sent to the hospital with an at
1 tack of dysentery, the result of eating
improper food. They say the average sol
1 dier at best is none too thoughtful of his
own welfare, and after his long diet of
army rations he would be less likely than
ever to heed his stomach were a consign
ment of provisions from home to reach
him.
