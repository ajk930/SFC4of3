. ORT AU PRINCE, Hayti, May 27.â It is reported here that a
bpanish fleet of fourteen vessels passed Mole St. Nicholas, going
northward through the Windward Passage.
SPANISH FLEET OFF COSTA RICA.
Copyrighted. 189 S. by James Gordon Bennett.
PANAMA, May 27. â Passengers arriving here yesterday on an
Italian steamer from Cartagena report that they saw three warships,
supposed to belong to the Spanish fleet. One passenger, who had a
powerful marine glass, said he discerned four others. The ships were
apparently heading for Port Limon, Costa Rica.
The Herald's correspondent at Port Limon cables that at about 5
o'clock yesterday eight ships were sighted about ten miles from port.
Owing to a heavy fog it was impossible to distinguish the flags of the
fleet, but from the size and form of the vessels, it is believed that they
were warships. The eight vessels were going in a northerly direction
and at about 6:30 o'clock disappeared from view.
CERVERA YET fIT SANTIAGO.
CHICAGO, May 27. â A private cable to the Associated Press
from a reliable person in Port Au Prince, Hayti, dated May 25, asserts
that he had positive information that at that time Admiral Cervera's
fleet was in the harbor of Santiago de Cuba.
REPORTS FROM SPANISH SOURCES.
MADRID, May 27. â Blanco cables that Cervera's squadron is
still at Santiago and that the bulk of Sampson's squadron is blockad
ing that port. Schley's squadron is watching the Yucatan Passage.
Blanco cables that the destroyer Terror arrived at Fajardo, Porto
Rico. She intended to go to San Juan, but found four American war
ships cruising in front of the harbor.
SCHLEY'S CHALLENGE TO CERVERfJ.
NEW YORK, May 27.â A dispatch from Key West says: Schley
is reported to be master of the situation at Santiago and is seeking all
means to make the Spanish fleet come out and give battle. Yesterday,
it is reported, he sent a boat with a white flag into the harbor with
this message:
"The Spanish fleet has the alternative of coming out and fighting
or remaining in and starving."
Another Key West dispatch says: It is reported on the best au
thority that Cervera has escaped, having left Santiago on Saturday.
It is believed he intends to attack the Atlantic cities, and one of the
American fleets is watching for such a move. Cervera may possibly
go to Porto Rico, but he cannot get into Havana.
THE YALE OFF MOLE ST. NICHOLAS.
Copyrlfhted, IS9B, by James Gprdon Bennptt.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, May 27. â The steamer Beda, from Halifax,
arrived at Kingston to-day. She reports having passed the United
States cruiser Yale at 6 o'clock yesterday morning. The Yale was
then cruising in the Windward Passage, off the Mole St. Nicholas.
DISPATCHES FROM ODMIROL SAMPSON.
WASHINGTON, May 27. â There is reason to believe the navy
officials to-night received dispatch's from Admiral Sampson although
at 11:30 P. M. no bulletins had been made public. At 2 o'clock this
morning the dispatch-boat Dolphin of Commodore Schley's squadron
ran alongside the flagship New York, which was then off Havana, and
informed her that she bore dispatches for Admiral Sampson from Com
modore Schley. It was considered probable these dispatches contained
information of the precise whereabouts of the Cape Verde squadron t
and, quite naturally, the info'mation would be sent to the naval
authorities here as soon as boats and telegraph wires could carry it.
That the naval officials have received information is not doubted, but
as yet they have not admitted the fact.
CERVERA AWAITS RE-ENFORCEMENTS.
LONDON, May 28 â A dispatch to the Financial News from
Kingston, Jamaica, says: The master of the fishing schooner Jane,
which has arrived here, reports having picked up a yawl containing
two reconcentrados who had escaped from Santiago de Cuba. He
says they told him that Admiral Cervera's squadron was in the
harbor; that the vessels were coaled and victualed and were ready
to sail "when the Cadiz squadron arrives next week and breaks the
blockade."
The San Francisco Call
A Story That the Spanish
Fleet Has Never Been
at Santiago,
CHICAGO, May 28.â The Inter Ocean prints the following
this morning:
KINGSTON, Jamaica, May 26 (Held by Press Censor and re
leased on order of General A W. Greely, May 28, I A. M.)â Admiral
Cervera's fleet is not now nor has it been at Santiago de Cuba.
This is the statement of Lieutenant-Commander Marix, United
States steamship Scorpion, who boarded the Premier in latitude
20:3O, longitude T9, early this morning, after firing a shot across
her bows, i.Jistaking her in the darkness for a Spaniard.
Marix was on his way to Cienfuegos, where he believed Schley had
Cervera bottled up. Upon being toid that Schley had gone to Santiago de
Cuba, where he supposed the Spanish fleet to be, Marix made the state
ment that Cervera was not in Santiago now, and had not been, and said
he knew what he was talking about, as he had left there but a few hours
before.
He then returned in haste to the Scorpion, and crowding on all possible steam sailed
away in the direction taken by Schley's fleet.
The Premier has been with Schley's fleet since leaving Key West and a record of
the movements of the celebrated squadron may be of interest.
After being for three days on the razor edge of momentary expectation of doing
battle with the Spanish fleet, Commodore Schley's squadron, composed of the powerful
battle-ships lowa, Massachusetts and Texas, the armored cruiser Brooklyn, the commo
dore's flagship; the cruiser Marblehead. the gunboat Castine, the torpedo boat Dupont and
the torpedo destroyers Vixen and Eagle, sailed out of Cienfuegos Tuesday night.
Every man aboard was disappointed and cursing mad. For three days they had
watched the ioo-yard wide entrance of the harbor of Cienfuegos with every gun shotted
and fully manned, every moment of the night and day. They were almost positive that
the Spaniards were inside and that if they had any fighting blood in them they would
come out and take a licking.
Over a depression in the hills between the city and the Caribbean Sea the men
aloft could see the topmasts of four big ships that were in the harbor, and they watched
hungrily as reconcentrados might watch a shipload of food.
In the dark of the night a torp?do boat even sneaked inside the harbor to within
little more than half a mile of the ships, and the men aboard feasted their eyes on four
big, dark fcrms and twelve smaller ones floating in the bay.
They figured these out to be the four cruisers and the three torpedo-boat destroy
ers from Cape Verde and several small gunboats that that fleet had picked up along the
coast and further whetted the appetites of the boysoutside by telling them all about it.
It was not until dusk of Tuesday, when ihe Marblehead and the Eagle returned from a scouting ex
pedition, in the course of which they had communicated with the insurgents ashore, that it was learned
positively that the Spanish fleet was not inside.
There was nothing left then tut to start out again on the hunt, and this was done within an hour.
Schley's fleet left Key West Thursday night, May 19, and anived sixty m.les off" Cienfuegos
Saturday night. It lay there all night, and early Sunday morning ran in toward shore. The squadron
formed into line about eight miles (ff the entrance to the harbor. The fortifications at the entrance had
already been destroyed by the cruiser Marblehead when two of her boats' crews were engaged in cutting
cables there.
On Sunday afternoon cannonading was heard and in the evening searchlights were seen to
play over the harbor and town.
On Monday morning the British steamer Adula arrived from Jamaica. Her captain showed a per
mit from the State Department at Washington to pass the blockade and take eff several hundred refugees
under the protection of the British Consul.
The captain of the Adula reported to Commodore Schley that on the Friday night preceding he had
sighted seven ships in a bunch off Santiago, apparently bound for Cienfuegos. The captain of the Adula
said when he was at Santiago Saturday the Spanish fleet was not there.
Acting on this information and under the belief that the cannonading he had heard was an ad
miral's salute, Commodore Schley felt justified in remaining off the harbor.
Instantly the signal, "Clear ships for immediate action," was run up on the flagship. Then the
movable staff went overboard.
All the way from Hampton Roads the ships had been dropping things overboard. When they came
to Cienfuegos there did not seem to be anything left, but in a minute the bay was full of floating wood
work. On the Texas even I saw a chest take a header into the sea.
The ships were kept close together. Bugle calls and beating drums calling men to quarters were
heard from one ship to the other. The navigating officers ran up to the bridges.
There was not a "conn ing-tower captain" in the outfit. Every man from the commodore down went to the bridge to
fight the ship.
Next came the command, "Silence," from ship to ship. A little iater came, " Cast loose and provide."
Every gun was manned. All that could be brought to bear were pointed at the harbor's mouth.
The Massachusetts stood on with the heaviest batteries. The flagship twisted around, bringing her broadside to bear
on the entrance. The Texas brought her ei?ht-inch puns to bfar, and the others their heaviest. There were enough guns
pointed at the hole in the shore line to cut a new passage clear through to Cientuegos.
Then came a wait. Five, ten, fifteen minutes passed. There was a signai on the flagship, and a torpedo-boat cam?
around from behind the other ships where she had been hiding. She dashed up to the entrance, then away, and back again.
Firing was still heard inland, but she could not get sight of the enemy.
For half an hour the ships stood ready to pulverize anything that appeared. When "return from quarter*" sounded
the gunners were ready io cry from disappointment.
Some time afterward two Cubans came from the westward in a small boat and reported that there had been an
engagement Inland been the Cuban and Spanish forces. The Spaniards were forced to retire to the city. The Cubans
said the Spanish had lost 300 killed.
They also said that there were 12,000 Spanish troops in the city well supp ied with arms and ammunition, and that the
entrance to the harbor was a narrow passage twelve miles iong and well mined.
There were schooners inside that the Spaniards intended to sink in case of attack. The Cubans had not been in the
city for some oays and knew nothing about the fleet supposed to be hiding there.
Before dark there was a consultation
between the officers of the Dupont and
the Commodore. After dark the Du
oont disappeared.
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, MAY 28, 1898.
On Sunday Commodore Schlev's
ships moved up closer to the shore and
formed a crescent about the entrance.
The torpedo boat staved inside the |
crescent, patrolling close in shore. Ev
ery man on every ship, including the
chaplains, was on watch. There was no
lurht on shore. No smokincr was al-
lowed on the ships. White suits and
hats were laid aside. Every man wore
blue.
The gun crews slept beside their
guns. Fighting tops were manned. All
the officers stayed on deck. They
spoke only in . whispers. Everybody
was so on edge that in the gra dawn
the lowa narrowly missed bein-^ fired
on when she arrived from Key West.
She was not identified quickly in the
haze. There was a second call to
quarters and an order to pretare for
immediate action.
Preprations this time cc .sisted mere
ly of the men jumping up to the guns
beside which they were lying. The sig
nals of the lowa wo c made out before
any damage had been done.
Next came the Adula incident, when
the captain was taken aboard the flag
ship. Later on Monday the Hawk ar
rived with dispatches from Key West,
and the latest news there was to the ef
fect that the Spanish fleet was reported
to be at Santiago.
Commodore Schley sent the Scorpion
off to Santiago to scout about, and the
Hawk returned to Key West with the
news that the Spaniards were probably
bottled up at Cienfuegos.
During the day all the boats of the
squadron passed up and down in front
of the depression in the hills, so that
all hands had a chance to whet their
appetites with a sight of what were be
lieved to be the topmasts of the ene
my's ships
The night passed like Sunday night.
At 6 o'clock on Tuesday r..orning three
ships were sighted coming from the
south. When they were still almost
hull down the thunder of shots was
heard again and the signal "Clear for
action" went up on the' flagship.
Word went from ship to ship that
there was no doubt about it this time.
Nine shots were counted. That is the
ALL NIGHT CONFERENCE AT WASHINGTON.
WASHINGTON. D. C, May 28.â
News of importance, understood to be
from Commodore Schley, was received
by the Navy Depart ent late last night.
Contrary to his custom. Secretary
Long went to the department at a late
hour and was closeted with Assistant
Secretary Allen. Lieutenant Whittelsev.
the cipher expert of the Bureau of Navi
gation, and General A. \V. Greelv.
chief of the Signal Service, who has
charge of the military telegraph system.
They remained at the Navy Depart
ment until morning.
A cipher message was translated and
read at the conference.
In view of the arrange
ments made for giving to
LAND FORCE MAY
ATTACK SANTIAGO
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, May 27.
Secretary Long still Insists that
nothing has been received from either
Schley or Sampson, or from any other
official source, confirming a general im
pression that the Spaniards are in San
tiago harbor.
The dispatch-boat Dolphin arrived at
Key West to-night with dispatches
from Commodore Schley, dated "Off
Cienfuegos." They have not yet reached
the Navy Departmentâ at least have
not been given out for publication.
They will, it is thought, contain little
news, however, for it is well known
that Schley's squadron, when it left
Key West last Friday, a week ago,
sailed for Cienfuegos, believing that the
Spaniards were there.
Press dispatches have already related
how Schley's vessels steamed all
around Cienfuegos, that 30.000 rounds
of ammunition were delivered to the in
surgents on last Sunday, and that af
ter destroying several blockhouses
scattered along the coast in the vicin
ity of Cienfuegos, Commodore Schley
steamed for Santiago, 300 miles dis
tant, while the Dolphin made for Key
West with the dispatches. Therefore,
it is not probable that the Dolphin
brings any news from Santiago about
the whereabouts of the Spanish squad
ron.
It has been suggested that, if it seems
to be inexpedient for Commodore
Schley to land a party for the purpose
of ascertaining whether or not the
much-wanted Spaniards are in the har
bor, the big war signal balloon be used
for this purpose. It is now at Tampa,
whither it was transported from Fort
Logan for use in the Cuban campaign.
The War Department has a portable
apparatus charged with gas, by which
means it could be inflated from aboard
ship, and then elevated from the deck
by a windlass. The War Department
is willing to loan it to the navy for this
purpose, and unless some definite news
is received within a day or two the of
fer will be accepted. It will be sent to
Commodore Schley on a fast boat.
It was suggested to-day that the
Spaniards might shoot the balloon full
of holes with their rapid-fire guns, but
the Signal Service officers of the War
Department believe that if it were ele
vated to a height of about a mile from
one of Schley's vessels standing a few
miles out to sea, a good view might be
obtained of Santiago harbor and its
occupants located without any result
ant harm to the balloon or aeronauts.
InHhe absence of definite information
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Commodore's salute. "With a sigh of
disappointment Commodore Schley
answered from the flagship with seven
Runs and instantly issued orders: "No
more firing salutes."
The approaching ships were the
Marblehead, Vixen and Eagle. The
Marblehead and Eagle started on a
scouting trip an hour later and return
ed at 6 o'clock In the evening. Signals
went up on the flagship again, and it
was known that the watch had been
in vain.
Just at sunset the fleet lined up In
double column, the Brooklyn and Mar
ble head in the lead, next the Massa
chusetts and lowa, then the Texas and
Dupont, the Vixen and Collier and last
the Eagle and Castine.
The dispatch-boat continued with
the fleet for several hundred miles. A
g-ale was howling the rain was falling:,
the seas were high, and the smaller
boats of the fleet were having 1 a hard
time. The only light in the fleet waa
the stern light on the flagship.
The gale increased in fury, and abrmt
8 o'clock Wednesday morning the light
of the flagship was Vt. The dispatch
boat continued on h course long after
daylight, but got no further sight of
the fleet, and, short of coal and water,
put into Kingston to send the news
and replenish.
In latitude 20.30, longitude 79, the
Premier was fired on at close quar
ters by the Scorpion, which was return
ing from Santiago, supposing the fleet
to be still at Cienfuegos. Lieutenant
Commander Marix, the commander,
thought he had a prize and sent a
boarding party out.
The officer was surprised to learn
that Schley's fleet had left Cienfuegos
He said the Spanish fleet was not at
Santiago and had not been.
He learned the rendezvous point of
Schley's fleet from the correspondents
and started off to meet Schley as set
forth above.
the press any advices
from Schley to the ef
fect that Cervera's fleet
was still at Santiago, the
failure to make public
anything about the mes
sage would indicate that
Cervera has escaped.
No positive statement to that effect
can be made, however. The officers of
the Navy Department dcclii.c to say
whether anything cam; from Schlev.
The only answer to inquiries was "No
bulletins."
concerning Cervera's whereabouts the
War Department will proceed with its
preparation for invading Cuba, and. It
is believed, AdmiraJ Sampsn upon ar
riving before Havana will immediately
begin to bombard Santa Clara and
Morro batteries. Troops will be landed
at the eastern end of Cuba and will
join with General Garcia in a siege of
Santiago as soon as that can be done
after positive information has been re
ceived as to the location of the Spanish
fleet.
It is believed that the conference
between Secretary Alger and General
Miles and two members of General
Garcia's staff had some relation to this
plan for a land attack on Santiago.
Garcia's aids claim he has 8000 well
armed men within thirty miles of San
tiago and nearly as many more that he
could arm if he only had the rifles and
ammunition. There may be a combi
nation between American farces and
those of Garcia, which will close around
Santiago by land so as to shut it off
from supplies. In that event it will
soon starve out. It is said that there
are some high bluffs overlooking San
tiago harbor on which siege guns can
be placed so as to fire on the fleet in the
harbor, and that, owing to the height
of the bluffs, the guns of the fleet could
not be sufficiently elevated to make
any reply.
The War Department has arranged
for the departure of a second expedi
tion of 5000 men to the Philippines on
Sunday or Monday. Assistant Secre
tary of War Meikeljohn to-day suc
ceeded in chartering two more large
transports which will be ready to leave
San Francisco early next week. It
was at first expected to send 2500 men
on the second expedition, but the pro
curing of the two steamers, the Colon
and the China, to-day, will enable the
department to embark 5000 men. Mr.
Meikeljohn, who has charge of the pro
curing of transports, said to The Call
c,orresp<Jiiut-"in. .
"The department to-day secured the
transport Colon, now at San Francisco,
and the China, which arrived at the
same port from Yokohama to-day. I
succeeded in communicating with Mr.
C. P. Huntington in lowa en route for
New York, who, as president of the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company,
made a proposition to the department
regarding the chartering of the afore
mentioned ships, which I accepted by
wire this morning. This gives a fleet
of five transports, namely, the Zealan
dla, Centennial, Ohio, Colon and China,
which will carry about 5000 troops. I
hope to have them ready for sailing
from San Francisco for Manila early
Jn the week."2

Marshal Rivera Says Our
Flag Will Never Wave
Over Manila.
Declares the Philippines Have Not
Adequate Defenses, but Thinks
the Islands Will Not Be
Taken,
MADRID, May 27.â 1n the Senate to- |
day Marshal Rivera, former captain- :
general of the Philippines, defended his ;
administration of the colony. He said ,
he could not believe his ears when he
was told of the disaster at Oavite, add
ing "that rag called the American flag
shall never float over the walls of Ma
nila."
The Philippines, he continued, had
not had adequate means of defense.
He applied to the Government to sup
ply them, but the Government replied
that the Pope had intervened and that
there was no fear of a rupture. The
naval committee at Manila examined
Into the position carefully and reached
the conclusion that it was quite impos
sible to offer battle to the Americana.
"The Yankees are deceiving them
selves," Marshal Rivera declared, "as
to the situation at the Philippines. It
is absolutely impossible that they
should become masters of the islands,
for the natives, to an immense major
ity, are determined to defend the ter
ritory to the last and to maintain Span
ish sovereignty."

ANNEXATION
AS A RIDER
Amendments Made to
the War Revenue Bill.
MAY TIE UP THE MEASURE
SENATOR LODGE DECLARES HA
WAII IS NEEDED.
It Is Asserted That the Islands Are
Required as a Base of Military
and Naval Opera
tions.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 27.
The Hawaiian annexation question,
which has been the subject of no little
concern about the Senate for the past
few days, assumed definite slmpe to
day when Senators Lodge and Morgan
offered amendments to the war revenue
bill bearing directly upon the subject.
Senator Lodge's amendment is in the
words of the Newlands resolution, and
provides, in direct terms, for the an
nexation of the islands.
Senator Lodge was seen immediately
after he ba<! sent his amendment to the
desk, and announced it to be his pur
pose to press it to the end.
"Henceforth." said he, "the two
measures must travel together. Both
are equally important, and under the
circumstances it would be foolhardy to
forego our advantages in Hawaii."
Senator Lodge's action in presenting
the amendment was the result of mare
or less conference, though it was of an
informal character, among the stanch-
est advocates of annexation. They ex
press the opinion that the amendment
in the end will be accepted, but admit
that, in all probability. It will result in
delaying the passage of the revenue
bill. Incorporation of Hawaiian an
nexation in the revenue bill would, of
course, have the effect of forcing the
matter upon the attention of the House.
Advocates of annexation say all but
four Republican Senators and many
Democrats, Populists and Silver Repub
licans will vote for Lodge's amend
ment.
The assertion Is made by Senators in
favor of annexation that the adminis
tration Is more anxious than at any
previous time for legislation providing
for annexation. The condition of af
fairs in the Philippines and the neces
sity for a stopping place for our ships
on their way to those islands, they say,
is the reason for the present urgency.
It is asserted that to hold the Philip
pines without the possession of Hawaii
would be next to impossible.
Senator Jones of Arkansas, a Demo
cratic member of the Finance Com
mittee, expressed the opinion that the
Lodge amendment would not be ac
cepted.
"It would," he said, "certainly delay
the bill Indefinitely if pressed."

said it was inopportune to discuss the
war at present. He had neither ap
proval nor disapproval to express of
Marshal Rivera's administration, but
he considered it necessary to exercise
a certain reserve in the interest of the
country.

General Blanco cables from Havana
that Admiral Cervera's squadron is still

Sampson's squadron is blockading that
port; that Commodore Schley's squad
ron is watching the Yucatan Passage;
that the American vessels have left
Cienfuegos, and that thp American
fleet of blockaders are within sight of

General Blanco, in his dispatch, says
that he opposed the departure of the

EXTENDING
THE X RAY
Powerful Apparatus Has
Been Prepared.
PROF. TROWBRIDGE'S WORK
PRODUCES SPARKS VERY MUCH
LIKE LIGHTNING.
Experiments That Will Make Pos
sible Still Further Remark
able Attainments in
Surgery.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, May 27. â A new and power
ful apparatus has just been completed
by Professor John Trowbridge of Har
vard University for the experiments in
electrical force, his principal object be
ing to test further the penetrating pow
er of X-rays. The apparatus consists
of a series of 120 Franklin plates or
Leyden jars, mounted on a simple
wooden frame work and supplied with
power by a storage battery containing
10,000 Plante cells.
The voltage necessary for the experi
ments is 2,500,000. The apparatus is
capable of producing sparks in the air
closely resembling lightning flashes of
from six to seven feet in length. The
power is sufficient to draw sparks from
the brick walls of the room, and the
discharge creates somewhat the same
effect as a sudden cold breeze. Sparks
from thirty to forty feet in length can
be obtained by the use of glass tubes
in which the atmospheric pressure has
been reduced to about two and a half
pounds to the square inch.
Professor Trowbridge has already
made experiments which prove that
with the apparatus as powerful as this
the X-rays can be made to penetrate
not only human flesh, but also bones
and tendons, thus probably making
possible still more remarkable attain
ments in surgery by their aid.
FOUGHT WITH A PAIR
OF MONSTER GRIZZLIES.
British Columbia Prospector's Terri
ble Encounter With Two En
raged Beasts.
KASLO, B. C, May 27.â William Moir.
a well-known prospector living at the Pa
cific Hotel, was seriously injured in a
terrible encounter on Wednesday with
two grizzly bears weighing 750 and 600
pounds, respectively. Moir was on th><:
way alone to his claim and was three
miles from Sprowls Station of the Kaslo
and Slocan Railway, when he was at
tacked by the beasts. With nothing but
an ax as a weapon he fought dearly for
his life, and finally succeeded in dispatch
ing one of the animals, the other decamp
ing.
In the fight Moir was terribly lacerated
on the head, shoulders and limbs by the
claws and teeth of the animals. His
escape under the circumstances was all
but miraculous. Bleeding externally and
weak from loss of blood, he made his
way to Sprowls, where he was carefully
attended by friends, and he was brought
to Kaslo to-day for medical treatment.
It took Moir six hours to travel the three
miles, so nearly was he gone. Dr. G.
Harlin said that with care he would prob
ably recover.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 27.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: The
Spanish hospital ship, the Alicante, will
no longer be protected by the Congress
of Geneva flag. This has practically
been definitely decided by the authori
ties. The decision is the result of the
action of the Alicante's commander in
supplying the torpedo-boat destroyer

of that vessel from Fort de France,

that in future she will be looked upon
as a ship of the Spanish nary.
Notwithstanding the activity of the
American Consuls and scouts cruising
in the Caribbean Sea the latest report re
ceived in regard to the vessel came
from the Consul at St. Pierre, who
cabled that the Terror was heading
west when seen last. The authorities
have no idea she will be able to escape
the American vessels cruising among
| Windward Islands, but now that she
i has apparently been lost sight of, they
: are wandering where she has gone.
It is to be presumed that her com

I ply followed this course so as to de
i ceive the American Consul watching
! him from the island, and as soon as
I he got out of sight of land he changed
I his course.
Among naval officers the opinion
seems to be that the Terror went vo

Impossible for her to enter that har

BANCROFT PURSUES
A SPANISH CRAFT
She Is Believed to Be an Auxiliary
Cruiser on Secret
Duty.
KEY WEST, May 27.â The Bancroft
last night gave chase to a three-masted
steamer, apparently a merchantman of
large tonnage. She was first seen by
the Wilmington, which was on its way
for coal.
Shortly after sighting the supposed
Spanish craft the Wilmington spoke
the Bancroft, and notified her of the
presence of the vessel. As the ships
were lying to the stranger hove in
sight and the Bancroft Immediately
started in pursuit of her.
It is supposed that the Spaniards ob
serving the Wilmington's military top
mistook her for a battleship and
thought it safe to continue scouting in
the vicinity, trusting to superior speed
to escape. When the Bancroft ap
peared the stranger lost no time in
getting away and the race as seen from
the Wilmington was close and exciting.
GOVERNOR M'CORD TO
HEAD A REGIMENT.
Arizona's Executive to Go to the Front
at the Head of a Thousand
Volunteers.
PHOENIX, Ariz., May 27.â Governor
McCord has received authority to or
ganize an infantry regiment in Ari
zona, which he will lead in person. A
month ago he applied to the President
for permission to raise a regiment, but
was informed that the Arizona con
tingent of cowboy troops had exhausted
the Territory's quota. Under the new
call he renewed his application and
through the influence of the Secretary
of the Interior and others he was given
authority to proceed. He will be given
leave of absence. The President will
not accept his resignation.
SIX MEN DROWNED
IN A COAL MINE.
Drive a Tunnel Into a Drift Filled
With Water and Fail to
Escape.
POTTSVILLE, Pa_, May 27.â A fright
ful mining casualty occurred to-day at
the Kashu William colliery, near Middle
port, and six men were drowned by a
body of water breaking in from the "old
working." The victims were all Slavs.
A tunnel was being driven through an
abandoned vein. The men were working
in the tunnel. A large body of water had
backed up in the old '-working," which
the tunnel was designed to cut. The last
shot fired burst open the seams, and
through these the water suddenly poured.
All six were caught and drowned. The
bodies of none of the victims have been
recovered.
BENEFITS THE GRAIN.
Fall of Rain Reported at Central Cali-
fornia Points.
SACRAMENTO. May 27.â Rain fell here
most of the afternoon, but rather lightly.
Like the preceding storm, it will greatly
benefit late grain crops and small vege
tables. Ripe cherries will be injured, and
some hay, but the latter will be more
than offset by the benefit to alfalfa fields,
where several crops are cut during the
season.
STOCKTON, May 27.â The rainfall here
to-day was light, but it was good for the
country and did no harm in any direc
tion. With an occasional shower and
continued cool weather consfderable grain
is heading out well and crop prospects
have been greatly improved. The crop
will be light, but it has been increased by
favorable weather.
SAN JOSE, May 27.â There was a slight
fall of rain here this afternoon. It was
much heavier in the western foothills,
where the best orchards are located. The
effect, though slight, will be beneficial.
SANTA ROSA, May 27.â Heavy show
ers have fallen throughout Sonoma Coun
ty, and will benent the hay and graia
crop.

BRITISH CONSUL BADLY
BEATEN BY CHINESE.
British Consulate, Custom House
and Two Stores Burned by Riot
ers at Sha-Shi.
SEATTLE. Wash., May 27.â The steam
er Rio Jun Maru arrived here at 10
o'clock to-night, bringing meager news
of an anti-European riot at Sha Shi,
China, in which the British Consulate,
Custom House and the stores of Jar
ne, Mathieson & Co. and Butterfleld &
Swire were destroyed by fire. The British
Consul was severely beaten, and the Eu
ropean residents were forced to take ref
uge in the tea and silk hulks lying in the
river. No one was killed.
Sha Shi is a large city on the Yangtse
Kiang River, about 600 miles from its
mouth. It is one of the ports that was
opened to foreigners after the Chinese-
Japanese war. The feeling against for
eigners is said to be still very bitter. The
riot occurred on May S l , and the news of
it reached Kobe on May 10, just before
the Rio Jun Maru left.
Two British gunboats had been ordered
to Sha Shi from Hongkow, 100 miles down
the river, and Consul Harven at Shang
hai had sent a gunboat from that point.
They will restore order very quickly, as
the Chinese have great respect for them.
The Rio Jun also brought news that the
plague at Hongkong is making frightful
headway among the natives, large num
bers of them dying daily. Several Euro
peans have died from the scourge.

Special Dispatch tc The Call.
NEW YORK, May 27.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: The
War Department has been negotiating
with the Pacific Mail and Oriental
Steamship Companies relative to the
transportation of money for our troops
from San Francisco to Manila via
Hongkong and these companies have
offered to transmit it at I*4 per cent,
giving ainpje assurances of indemnity
from loss.
While it is probable that this method
would be economical in comparison
with the expense entailed by sending
money by paymasters the latter meth
od is favored by the department and
will in all probability be adopted, the
officers being sufficiently guarded. Pay
masters accompanied the first troops
for Manila, and the money then dis
patched is believed to be sufficient to
cover a period of three months. Tin;
Government favors transmission by
paymasters because it will enable this
country to keep in confidential com
munication with Manila.
The Bank of California has offered to
serve the Government as financial
agent at Manila, but as that city is
not in our possession nothing 1 can be
done in the matter at this time. It is
stated that as soon as possible a re
sponsible financial agency will be es
tablished at Manila, but until abso
lutely safe all money will remain on
board ship.
Paymaster General Stanton said to
day that all payments would be made
In gold, with silver as subsidiary coin,

orders and checks when they desire to
send money home. Payments will be
made by paymasters in person to every
man in the army and General Stanton
has urged the President to appoint a
sufficient force to enable him to pay
soldiers at the end of every month.

NEUTRALITY
IS IGNORED
BY HAWAII
Dewey's Glorious Victory
Vigorously Celebrated
at Honolulu.
Committees Selected to Welcome
the Boys in Blue While En
Route to the Philippines.
HONOLULU, May 21.â The war spirit
has captured Hawaii. Honolulu has
seldom seen such an enthusiastic gath
ering as that assembled in the Drill
Shed on the evening of the 18th. Amer
ican patriotism was rampant, and the
eagle of America screamed in harmony
with the bold bird of Germany and the
roar of the British lion, all in honor of
brave Dewey and the boys in blue who
are expected to touch at our port on
their way to the Philippines.
The American Minister and his Con
sul-General let flow the floods of im
passioned patriotic oratory, untram
meled with diplomatic discretion, while
Hawaii's Attorney-General forgot for
the nonce that he was the law adviser
of the Government. It was throughout
the meeting the ardor of the heart on
fire and not the cool thought of the
head, that had full sway and control
But in place of "Semper Eadem, the
banner of our pride," it was the glori
ous stars and stripes that was waved
over victorious Dewey and the sunken
Maine. It was "Old Glory" and a "Holy
War." Who cared for neutrality laws
on that evening? We shared the bene
fits and gifts of the United States in
time of peace and prosperity, and weak
and defenseless as we are, it was our
duty and right to cling all the closer
to- her in her hour of trial. The mouse
once saved the lion. All we had was
hers, and we would proclaim it in the
face of the world, with or without the
Government's permission. It required
but little persuasion for the hot-heads
to rally forth and hoist the flag, but
Harold Sewall and W. O. Smith only
smiled grimly at the suggestion.
Oratorical torpedoes and dynamite
phrases having been exploded to the
ear's content, the meeting got down to
business, and a committee of nearly
150 prominent men â Americans, Brit
ishers, Germans and hybrids were ap
pointed to make all necessary arrange

well-beloved Charleston, and to give
them such a reception and entertain

Hawaii through the weary watches of

I The Government's five Senators went

I was elicited that the President, with

favored the bill as arm-nded. It was in.
vain that Ministers Damon and Smith

They merely appealed to bitterly pre
judiced ears and the vote came with
even more crushing effect than they
had anticipated.
The Carter memorial fountain vote
I was another one which was obtained

i Cabinet, and still more curious is the

FREED FROM
TYRANNY
All Kern County Turns Out
to Welcome the Valley
Road.
A Vast Procession in Which All
Ranks and Callings
Joined.
BAKERSFIELD, May 27.â This has
been the most glorious day in the his
tory of Eakersfleld. It is but stating
a plain fact to say the Valley road
jubilee was a most complete success.
While the crowd was not what could
be considered a "jam," it was neverthe
less large and most enthusiastic, and
thoroughly representative of the best
interests of the community. All were
bent upon having a good time, and they
had it.
"It could not have been otherwise,"
eaid an old citizen. "They were of one
mind, and that was nothing short of
shouting and glorifying with their
neighbors at the release from a ter
rible and grinding tyranny that has
been painfully heavy so many weary.
long years."
This old citizen expressed the moving
spirit of the celebration better than col
- of "burning" words could tell it.
There is not a toiling farmer or pro

hearty "Amen" to the sentiment he ut-
tered. It was easy to read In the beam
ing faces.
The elaborate and extensive pro
gramme of the day was carried out to a
letter, with only a slight delay in the
nnlng-, this being caused by the
failure of the VaJley road excursion to
arrive at the time expected. This bore j
officials of the road and other guests. ;
Tlie day's programme was begun with
a procession of trades and ended with
"Home, Sweet Home" at the conclu
sion of a grand ball In the evening. The
procession was a most gorgeous one â
"the finest one we have seen yet," said
the officials of the Valley road and other
prominent visitors. It was fully a mile
in length and represented every phase
of industry in Kern County.
Strange to say, one of the most gor
geous and attractive features of the
procession was represented by Chinese
citizens. It was, indeed, brilliant in
its oriental magnificence. More than
200 Chinamen, who participated, were
adorned in rich silks of gorgeous col
ors, and all had something to carry and
do. They had two bands and numer
ous noisy and squeaky instruments
producing noise, if not melody. There
were great cars of fine ladies, chariots
of Kings and Queens, Judges and war
riors. The Great Dragon led the di
vision and was the center of much in
terest. All the trappings had been
brought from San Francisco and Chi
nese merchants here had to give a bond
of $5000 for their return. For weeks
local Chinamen have been wild with
interest in the celebration, and from
the fronts of their buildings waved
American flags. Hundreds of dollars
were spent by them and they appeared
eager to contribute. Eakersfield con

pork, mutton, alfalfa, lumber, mining
and other noted products of Kern
County being conspicuously displayed,
and many visitors wondered at the
richness indicated.
The procession started at the Valley
Road depot at 10:30 and wound through
various streets. It then passed in re
elew at the Arlington Hotel corner, on
the balcony of which stood the guests

The crowd Btood in the street below
and gave the utmost attention. Sena
tor Smith, after extending a hearty
welcome to the assembled throng, gave
a little railn.ad history, and then heart -
I'y expressed the appreciation of Kern
County at the coming of the Valley
Road. H<? characterized the event as
the most far reaching in the history of
the valley and State, and one which
would prove a blessing to unborn gen
erations as well as to the living. He
believed the people would give the road
thf-ir most sincere support. Senator
Smith's eloquent words were applauded
vigorously.
Following Senator Smith came Hon.
E. F. Preston. While the gentleman
was slightly indisposed, he made a
most eloquent address, and it set the
crowd wild. He expressed his appre
riation at the magnificent interest
phown at the coming of the Valley
[toad, and assured the people the road
meant to do its part, and expected them
to do theirs.
Then came Mayor Snyder of Los An
gles The Mayor gave many compli
mentary words to Bakersfield and the
Valley Road, and referred to the great
idvantages the road brought to their
â¢.ounty He extended the good will of
uos Angeles and spoke encouragingly
if the completion of the road to this
! city and pointed out the advantages it
would hp to Bakersfleld.
Following Mayor Snyder came San
Francisco's Mayor. He said many
; good things. He referred to the brave
'. task of building the road and the plans
of its operation, exhorted the people of
Kern County to give it their support
and stand by it under any and all cir
cumstances. He feelingly referred, as
: did all other speakers, to the absence of
1 its courageous promoter, Ciaus Spreck
i els. He asked the people to remember
i the brave leader while he was yet on
! the bed of pain. This simple allusion
was the cause of a great outburst of
i applause.
Speaking ended with an able talk
from Hon. C. C. Wright in behalf of
the Merchants' and Manufacturers' As
sociation of Loa Angeles. He said those
he represented were looking forward to
th-> great San Juaquin Valley as the
coming market for their products. He
favored completion of the road to Los
Angeles, and was sure it would give
Bakersfleld greater advantages. In
Baying this he explained that he meant
nothing to the disparagement of Pan
Francisco. All were of opinion that
i the building of the road marked a

grand era in the history of California.
At the conclusion of the speaking
President Mahon called for three cheers
for the road and its promoters. They
were given with royal good will.
In the afternoon an excursion on the
road was run into the rich Poso coun
try, to show the guests what rich fields
Kerh County can produce, and give a
glimpse at the Irrigation system. Those
who did not go were driven into the
country to view the principal places of
interest. Some attended the wild west
show and baseball game between the
Bakersfield and Hanford teams.
Early in the evening the crowd was
treated to a magnificent display of fire
works. Never before in the history of
the valley had such a display of pyro
technics been witnessed. Many appro
priate road emblems were shown, be
sides the blowing up of the Maine and
other special features.
After the fireworks the crowd
marched to the big warehouse. 60x400
feet, near the depot and indulged in
dancing to a late hour. The throng
filled the building which had been fit
tingly decorated for the occasion.
Among the contingent were the fol

SpÂ«>c!al Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 27. â The Press
Fays: J. J. Holland, builder of the Hol
; land submarine boat, has gone to
â  Washington with Colonel C. E. Crecy
I for the purpose of making an offer to
| the Government which, if accepted, per
| haps will solve the problem of how to
! destroy Cervera's fleet. Mr. Holland
will submit his proposition to the Sec
retary of the Navy at once. He is
i willing to undertake to sail his sub
i marine boat into the channel of the
narrow entrance to Santiago harbor,
i destroy th.c mines planted there and, If
| necessary, proceed into the harbor and
i deal a few blows at Cervera's vessels.
Mr. Holland declares that his plan
to do this is entirely feasible. The boat
is in shape and ready for the work, and
he will agree, if the Secretary of the
Navy thinks favorably of his proposal,
to obtain a crew of volunteers for the
enterprise. All that he will ask of the
authorities is transportation for his
vessel and men to Cuba. Once there,
he agrees to do the rest.
Mr. Holland proposes to take his boat
to Santiago, fitting her out and getting
everything in readiness under the pro
tection of Commodore Schley's squad
ron. Then, when the opportunity of
fers, probably just at dawn, the Hol
land will start on its mission. Before
it comes within sight of the fortifica
tions which frown on both sides of the
entrance it will sink beneath the sur
face of the water and steal quietly
toward the main channel.
When this is reached it will recon
noitre to get the lay-out of the mine
fields, and then, withdrawing to a safe
distance, discharge one or more of its
submarine torpedoes amonT the mines.
This is the regular process known as
countermining, which is similarly con
ducted by a vessel above the water,
which lays alongside the harbor mines
another series, which, when exploded,
opens up the whole channel. Mr. Hol
land believes that by this method the
channel into Santiago could be cleared
without great difficulty.
He is prepared, if necessary, after
this task is accomplished, to proceed
in his craft undernc "â  the water into
the harbor and to attempt to blow up
one or more of Cervera's battleships.
If the Navy Department has not an
other plan for disp< sing of Cervera's
fleet Mr. Holland's scheme may be con
sidered. "

WAR TAX AND
REDHOT TALK
Gorman Styles a Court
Decision "Infamous."
FAVORS THE BOND ISSUES
TELLEB CONCLUDES A MOST
SENSATIONAL SPEECH.
Declares the United States Ought to
Take Every Foot of Spanish
Soil Outside of
Spain.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rtggs House,
Washington, May 27.
A notable speech on the war revenue
bill was delivered in the Senate this
i afternoon by Gorman (D.) of Mary
land. In the course of an argument in
support of the tax on corporations, he
denounced as "infamous" the decision
of the Supreme Court declaring the in
come tax law of 1894 as unconstitution
al. Gorman took decided issue with
the majority of his fellow Democrats
upon their proposition to coin the sil
ver seigniorage and to issue legal ten
der notes, and made a powerful argu
ment in favor of the issuance of bonds
to raise funds with which to prosecute
the war.
Soon after the Senate convened at 11
o'clock this morning Carter reported from
the Military Affairs Committee a bill pro
viding for a second Assistant Secretary of
War, to be named by the President, and
to receive a salary of $4000. After a de
lay of fifteen minutes a quorum was se
cured and the bill was passed.
Morgan then offered an amendment to
the war revenue measure as follows:
When any of the islands of the Atlantic or
Pacific ocean? are owned by the United States,
or when they ar* occupied by the civil or
military forces of the United States, as a re
sult uf war with Spain, or as a necessary
means of conducting such war, to be deter
mined by the President as the commander-ln
chlef of the army and navy of the I nlted
States, It shall be lawful aÂ»d within his dis
cretion for the President to appoint a civil or
military coverner of such island, or any group
of iuch Islands, with full authority under such
ru!*-s ana regulations as the President shall
prescribe not Inconsistent with the laws of
civilized warfare, to maintain good order and
to protect lives and property and the domestic
peace of the people thereof.
And there shall be extended over such
islands and enforced therein such parts and
provisions of the tax laws of the United
States or of such Islands, with or relating to
customs duties or to internal taxation, as shall
In the judgment and discretion of the Presi
dent be Justly applicable to such islands dur- (
ing the existence of the war with Spain.
The currency of the United States, whether
of gold, silver or paper money, shall be a law
ful tender in said islands, so owned or occu
pied, in the same manner and to the same ex
tent that they are legal tender In the United
States, for the payment of all debts, public or
private. And the provisions of this act that
relate to such islands, together with such regu
lations as shall be made by order of the Presi
dent for executing the same, shall remain in
force until the same are altered, amended or
repealed by act of Congress. ,
Consideration of the war revenue meas
ure was resumed. Teller taking the floor
to continue his speech begun yesterday.
"Those who ought to know," concluded
Teller, "estimate that the present war will
cost $300,003,000 if it be preaecuted for one
year. It is not a war of conquest, but a
war of humanity. However, since we
have taken the Philippines we ought to
hold them until some decision can be
reached as to their disposition. We ought
to take every foot of Spanish soil out
side of Spain herself, whether it be in this
hemisphere or in the other. We ought,
I believe, to drive the Spanish flag from
the waters of both the Atlantic and Pa
cinc Oceans."
Other speeches were made on the bill by
Nelson, Cockrell, Gorman and Jones of
Arkansas.
Allison, in charge of the bill, proposed
that a time be agreed upon to vote upon
tho scries of amendments relating to cor
poration taxes.
Jones (D.) of Arkansas objected on at
count of the numerous Important amend
ments offered to the bill, which had ma
terially altered the situation. It was
agreed that the Senate should meet at 31
o'clock to-morrow. At 5:15 p. m. tho Sen
ate went into executive session and soon
afterward adjourned.

ism now swelling In the public breast
was punctured to-day by the ladles
comprising the league. For the past

AT HAVANA

Tood and Fuel Very Scarce at Cuba's
Capital and a Combined Land
and Sea Attack Hourly
Expected.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 27. â Among the
twenty-seven passeng-ers which the i
British steamship Arecuna, chartered j
by the Ward line, brought here from
Mexican ports, were three families of
refugees from Havana. With many
others, they escaped from Havana to
Vera Cruz on the French steamer
Lafayette. The refugees are: Jose
Otero, his wife and five children; Al
fredo de la Ferte, wife and two chil
dren, and Mia. F. C. de Meranda. They
say the Lafayette tried to purchase
coal, but General Blanco would allow
none to be sold. The limited supply
now there is being guarded jealously,
and at night the city is in complete
darkness.
The electric plant has been shut
down, all factories where coal is used
as fuel are stopped, and the gas and
water works are forced to get along
with as little coal as possible. For this
reason water is scarce.
When the Lafayette sailed for Vera
Cruz there was a stampede to get out
of the city. Fully 15,000 Spaniards and
Cubans had obtained passports to j
leave, but exorbitant prices for pas- i
sage were demanded, and only a part ,
of them could afford to pay the rate I
asked. As it was, the Lafayette
took 1200 men, women and children
away from Havanaâ all that she was
able to. carry. There were thousands
left who, although willing to pay the
price asked, could not get passage, and
they ran about like mad men, offering
the fortunate ones twice the amount
they had paid for tickets.
A passenger named Xiques paid $1400
for passage for himself, wife and two
children. Many others paid as high as
$1000 each, and then they were com- j
pelled to sleep on the decks or wherever
they could find room to lie down. Three
miserable days were spent on the
Lafayette, with only a scanty allow
ance of food for each passenger. Nearly
all the passengers were wealthy Span
ish merchants in Havana and others
Cuban citizens.
Jose Otero .who brought his wife and
three daughters to this city, was for
merly connected with the city govern
ment in Havana. He said: "When
I left Havana it was said that the in
surgents were only fifteen miles from
the city, and at night the lights of their
camp fires could be seen burning in the
hills. From fear of bombardment by
the United States warships and attack
by the insurgents the city is panic- |
stricken, and a combined attack is
looked for every hour. Food is very
scarce and fresh meat can scarcely be
bought at any price. The blockade is
felt more by the poorer classes, and as
they are the ones who have been most
loyal to Spain the suffering among
them is the worst."
Mr. Otero would say little about the
Spanish troops in Cuba under General
Blanco, but from other passengers it
was learned that the army is about as
badly demoralized and panic stricken |
as the civilians. Ammunition is scarce j
and many of the troops are clothed in I
rags and without shoes. Rations are j
being doled out to them sparingly, but j
the soldiers watch carefully all places J
where provisions are known to be
stored and the authorities will not al

Forces to Be Moved From Key
West When Schley Reports Cer
vera's Fleet Locked Up.
NEW YORK, May 27.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Active preparations for the occupation
of both Cuba and Porto Rico are still
progressing, although Secretary Alger
does not yet feel fully convinced that
the Navy Department has definitely lo
cated the position of the" Spanish fleet.
It is the intention of the War Depart
ment to move troops from Key West to
Cuba as soon as Commodore Schley
reports to the Government that he has
the Spanish fleet safe in the harbor of
Santiago de Cuba.
Secretary Alger assured me this
morning that the report that the first
army movement would be made upon
Porto Rico was without foundation. He
admitted that much pressure has been
brought to bear upon the President to
first send an army of occupation to
Porto Rico before making any move on
Cuba, but he further intimated that
such a plan was contrary to the policy
of the administration. The advocates
of the Porto Rico scheme advance the
argument that owing to the vast
amount of ammunition that has been
lately sent to the Philippine Islands, a
large army of invasion would not be
fully supplied if sent immediately to
Cuba. The only foundation for this is
that some of the volunteers at Chicka
mauga are insufficiently provided with
ammunition at the present time. The
troops at Tampa and other southern
points, however, are reasonably well
supplied, and the Ordnance Department
promises to provide for the Chicka
mauga troops by the time they can
reach Tampa.

cessary to send the army to Cuba In
two divisions. If it is the intention of
the Government to waste no time in
making the forward movement against
Cuba, it will be impossible to obtain
the troop ships necessary to carry an
army of 75,000 men. to Cuba.
At the pi-esent timo the War Depart
ment has thirty-two first-class ships
in readiness to take men from Tampa,
New Orleans and Mobile to Key West.
A preliminary movement of troops to
the point of embarkation has already
begun. It will take not more than
twenty-four hours to make two trips
from Key West to the point of landing
in Cuba; that is, if the work is carried
on without unnecessary delay. It may
be necessary, however, to first send the
army now on the Gulf to Cuba on ac
count of the time needful to move men
from Chiekamagua to the point of em
barkation and delay the second move
ment for two or three days.
The plan of sending 10.000 men to cut
off supplies from the fleet of Admiral
Cervera is now under serious consider
ation. The plan is to land troops
eastward of Santiago de Cuba and have
them pet around behind the city and
starve the Spanish into submission.
Major-General Miles will leave
Washington for a tour of inspection to
morrow or Saturday. It is now un
derstood he will not command the Cu
ban army of invasion.
It was announced to-day that Mr.
Holland, the inventor of the submarine
boat of that name, was expected here
to-morrow to discuss with Captain
O'Neil, chief of ordnance, the feasibil
ity of using that novel craft in an at
tack upon the Spanish squadron at
Santiago if the vessels are still there.
Love of the Peace Union to Senor Sa
gasta and the Queen Regent of Spain,
advising that the Spanish Government
make further concessions to the United
States in order that the present war
might be brought to a speedy termina
tion and expressing the opinion that
the sentiment of the United States was
against the war.
The resolution, which will be intro
duced by George W. Edwards, de
nounces the "unpatriotic, un-American
and disgraceful expressions of opinion,
especially emanating from and under
the Independence Hall, the 'cradle of
American liberty." "

EBANKS PAYS
THE PENALTY
Hanged at San Quentin
Prison.
TWO MURDERS AVENGED.
NO EVIDENCE OF FEAR ON THE
GALLOWS.
His Crime the Killing of a Woman
and Her Aged Father in San
Diego County Nearly Three
Years Ago.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN QUENTIN, May 27.â "N0, I
have nothing at all to say."
With these words, in response to a
query from a prison guard, Joseph
Japheth Ebanks, the San Diego mur
derer, stepped upon the deathtrap in
the execution chamber at 10:30 o'clock
this morning, and Hangman Amos
Lunt adjusted the noose about his neck.
One quietly spoken word, "Good-by,"
to his spiritual comforter. Rev. Father
Lagan; then the black cap was drawn
over his features, the hangman lifted
his hand, and Ebanks shot through
the trap in expiation of his crime. Life
was pronounced extinct by the physi
cians in ten minutes and thirty sec
onds.
The execution was witnessed by few
people, mostly guards, newspaper men
and several citizens of San Francisco
and San Rafael. Drs. E. E. Hill and J.
L. Zabala, of the Harbor Hospital,
were present by invitation of Prison
Physician Lawler, while Dr. Paul Alex
ander of San Anselmo was present by
invitation of Warden Hale.
Ebanks retired early last night and
seemed to sleep soundly, but was up
and dressed in his convict apparel at 4
o'clock. This garb was changed to cit
izen's clothing at 8 o'clock. Shortly be
fore Father Lagan arrived at 10 o'clock,
Warden Hale entered the doomed man's
cell and started to read the death war
rant. Ebanks grew impatient and said
he cared to hear no more before the
reading was a fourth finished. He re
mained in close consultation and pray
er with Father Lagan until the time
came to mount the scaffold. Preceded
by the priest, chanting the rites of the
church, the murderer, supported by a
guard on each side, ascended the steps
with a firm tread. His face was slight
ly flushed and it could be seen that he
was under a strong tension, but, in the
current slang of the day, he died
"game."
After the drop, Drs. H. J. Partridge
and F. Jones counted the heartbeats.
They ceased in ten and a half minutes.
After the body was cut down Ebanks'
neck was found to have been broken by
the fall. Under Father Lagan's direc
tion. Coroner Eden of San Rafael re
moved the body to his undertaking
parlors, whence it will be taken to
Mount Olivet Cemetery for burial.
The crime for which Ebanks forfeited
Ills life was the murder of Mrs. Harriet
Stiles, aged 60, and her father, aged 85,
both of Riverside, near Oceanside, San
Diego County, on September 10, 1895.
The evidence was purely circumstan
tial, but so damaging that the jury,
without much delay, brought in a ver
dict of guilty. His execution was de
layed until this time by legal technical
ities and appeals to the State and Uni
ted States Supreme Court, the same
procedure being followed as in the
case of Durrant.
The murderer was 33 years of age,
and though born in England, was
reared in the West Indies, where he
had a wife and three children. Negro
blood flowed in his velnÃ.
Ebanks protested his Innocence to
the last, though singularly enough he
admitted that his fate was just on ac
count of his having disobeyed Injunc
tions received at his mother's knee.

i
DISCREDITS ROBBERY TALE
ACCUSES THE DEPUTY TAX
COLLECTOR.
Believes Evidence of a Hold-Up Was
Created to Hide a Large Short
age in the Official
Accounts.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, May 27.â 1t Is said revela-
I tions of a sensational character will be
brought to light in a few days in con
' nection with the alleged Madera rob
bery- On the morning following the re
ported looting of the safe, after Deputy
Tax Collector William Krohn was said
to have had a desperate encounter with
two masked robbers. District Attorney
Larew sent for Private Detective John
Curtin, and the latter has been working
on the case since. He Is not yet in a
position to make known the result of
his investigation, but this much has
; been gfren out: A revelation will be
i made In a few days which will create
I a sensation such as Madera has not
j experienced for many days.
District Attorney Larew said to-night
i to a Call representative, over a tele
phone wire, that the views of the al
i leged robbery entertained by himself
! and Detective Curtin were widely dlf
! ferent from the published reports.
I Further than that Mr. Larew did not
i care to say anything at the present
! time.
Mr. Curtin was more communicative.
; He has a theory, which is given for
what it is worth. He says he does not
! believe there were any desperadoes in
i the office at all, and that all evidences
of a terrible conflict were created by
1 Krohn himself in an effort to give his
I robbery story a plausible aspect. He
j believes the Deputy Collector was fak
; ing unconsciousness and says that all
j the wounds were superficial, and, he
had no doubt, were self-inflicted. He
| also discredits the story that Krohn
tells about the attempt to lock him in
the safe, of the fight for his life and the
hurling of missiles at the robbers, cut
ting one of them.
But the strongest point in Curtin's
opinion is the fact that there was not
$8000 in the safe that night, nor an
amount like that. The Tax Collector
was supposed to bank frequently, and
on the 7th day of May he made a de
posit.
It is said that Krohn is not danger
ously ill, as reported.
Detective Curtin gives it as his be
lief that defalcations to the amount of
$8000 will be brought to light, and the
shortage, he thinks, will extend back
several years and will cover more than
one administration. lie has not been
able to find anything against young
Krohn's reputation. Krohn did not
spend money for liquor, did not gamble,
and, in fact, was engaged in nothing
that would consume much money. The
deputy was practically conducting the
office, as the Tax Collector is engaged
in business and turned over the office
to his brother. Further than signing
papers the Tax Collector did no work
in the office.
One of the peculiar features of the
mystery is that young Krohn is not be
lieved to be short to any great extent.
Curtin believes he attempted to shield
all parties, sacrificing himself In the
attempt.
CORNERING THE BRITISH
COLUMBIA HAY MARKET
Rival Speculators Have Already Ad
vanced the Price to Eighteen
Dollars a Ton.
VANCOUVER, May 27. --The oat market
of t"he province has been sucessfully cor
nered, and now an attempt Is being made
to corner the hay market. Two forces
are at work â Chicago operators repre
sented by J. P. AicLaughlin and a large
firm in San Francisco, represented by one
Jardine. The latter has t>een to Victoria
and Vancouver and is now at Seattle. His
purchases are said to be very heavy and
competitive buying between him and the
Chicago people has advanced the price
already to $18.
Jardine is said to have stated while here
that the California hay crop waH a com
plete failure. If he cannot set a big
price here he will take the hay to San
FranciÃco.
There is not fifty tons of hay for sale In
the province now, and the fight is very
bitter between the opposing speculators.
One Councilman Too Many.
VISALIA, May 27.â This city has six
Councilmen, when it should have but five,
and there is trouble among the members
of the Council as a result. It arose on
account of the absence of W. H. Ham
mond in England. He was elected a mem
ber of the Council recently, but has not
returned in time to qualify. Governor
Budd was requested to appoint R. F.
Roth to fill the vacancy, which he did.
But Charles G. Lamberson, a member of
the old Council, says Governor Budd has
no right to appoint and that he will hold
office until his successor is elected and
qualified. Mr. Lamberson is a prominent
lawyer and thinks he's right. Mr. Roth
is also a leading lawyer and knows he's
right. The courts will be asked to set
tle the difference of opinion.

MONTEREY, May 27.â The quail of
Monterey County have not paired this

ate quail in this whole section, and a pe
tition is being circulated for signatures
asking the County Board of Supervisors
to pass an ordinance prohibiting the kill
ing of quail during the year.

CITY OF SITKA
PROBABLY LOST
Alaskan Schooner Long
Missing.
SAILED TEN WEEKS AGO
.
TWO WHITES AND a CHINESE
ABOARD.
Knew Nothing of the Northern Wa
ters and Encountered Rough
Weather at the
Outset.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, May 27.â The little Alas
kan schooner City of Sitka has been
I given up as lost and three lives are
j believed to have been sacrificed. Ten
| weeks ago the schooner left Sitka for
I Fort Wrangel with three men aboard.
| They were Herman Thomas, T. H. Bale
and Ah Poy, a Chinaman. The schooner
was never reported after leaving the
Sitka harbor, and the friend 3of the
men who sailed on her believe 6he went
| down.
T. H. Bale and Herman Thomas, the
; white men on the schooner, were not
i acquainted with Alaskan waters and
, knew little about sailing a schooner.
j They engaged the City of Sitka for a
j trip to Fort Wrangel, where they hoped
to obtain work. Ah Poy, the China
man, wanted- to go down to Wrangel to
get a Job cooking. None of the three
knew anything about the inland pas
sage, and their friends tried to dissuade
them from making the trip.
No news of the wreck of the schooner
has been received, and the Sitka people
are now talking of sending a search
party to determine its fate. It is be
j lieved the vessel struck a rock some
j where in the inland na&jage during the
I bad weather early in March. If so all
j hands went down with the boat, or they
j would have communicated with Sitka
i before this.
It is not an infrequent thing in the
northern waters for a small expedition
like the one on the City of Sitka to start
out and never be heard from again.
Many men have lost their lives during
the past winter in this way and the
fact has never been recorded.
CENTENNIAL NOW FLIES

Newly Acquired Transport Will

SEATTLE, May 27.â The steamship
Centennial now flies the stars and

Philippines, and will sail some time
to-morrow afternoon for San Fran
cisco. This evening: and last night an
armed guard of six men In the uniform
of the Government patrolled the Cen
tennial to prevent possible attack or
meddling; by Spanish emissaries. Every
precaution was taken by Captain Rob
inson, the assistant quartermaster who
has charge of the vessel, to prevent in-
Jury to her machinery or hull.
Captain B. B. Whitney of this city
has been selected by the owners of the
Centennial as her master on the long
voyage to Manila. Captain Whitney is
an experienced nevlgator. He assumed
his duty as master of the vessel to-day.
The Centennial's bunkers are filled with
-coal, enough to last her to Manila,
where she will obtain a new supply.
Two barges laden with coal which the
Quartermaster Department recently
purchased in British Columbia lay
alongside the Centennial, and from
these her supply was taken.
On her arrival at San Francisco the
Centennial will be turned over to Major
Long, U. S. A., the officer in charge of
the Quartermaru-r's Department in San
Francisco. She will be able to carry
800 men and officers and their baggage
annd effects tÂ«r Manila.
The Centennial will go in company of
a fleet of transports, including the
steamships Ohio. China, Zealandia,
Nlng Chow and Peter Jebsen (renamed
the Brutus). The Ohio will probably
join the fleet of transports at San
Francisco within two or three days
after the Centennial's arrival there.
The Ohio is at present lying at anchor
in Elliott Bay, but is expected to begin
taking on coal to-morrow morning. Her
nominal passenger capacity is 600. but
she will be fitted to take at least 200
more than this number.

HAWAII'S TENDER
TO UNCLE SAM
If Accepted It May Involve This
Country in a Serious Con
troversy With Europe.
NEW YORK, May 27. â The Washington correspondent of the
Herald says: No official confirmation has yet been received here of the
dispatch from Honolulu saying that the Hawaiian Government has ten
dered the islands to the United States as a base of supplies and is await
ing a reply from Washington. The official dispatches are probably on
their way by mail from San Francisco.
The Hawaiian Government practically made this offer, however, in
the last mail received from Honolulu, when assurances were given to the
United States that the islands could be used in any way tha might be
desired to further the United States' success in the war with Spain. It
may be that the steamer which arrived at San Francisco to-day con
veyed a still more specific proposition from the Hawaiian Government.
At any rate, the United States proposes to make use of the islands as a
base of supplies, though some of the officials fear that they may get into
grave complications by so doing.
It was pointed out to me to-night that the United States had already
called upon other Governments and had insisted upon the strictest ob
servance of neutrality, and it was suggested that if the United States
should now proceed to use a neutral country as a military base some
European power like Germany, which has not yet declared neutrality,
might extend similar favors to Spain that the United States is receiving
from Hawaii, and involve the United States in a very serious controversy
with the German empire.

PACIFIC GROVE'S CONFERENCE.
Scholarly Discourses Delivered Ba
fore the Christian Students.
PACIFIC GROVE, May 27.â The work
of the Pacific Coast Students' Conference
was prosecuted with growing interest to
day, and the various lectures were well
attended by the students. In an outline
of the history of Young Men's Christian
Association work among college men, C.
K. Ober, field secretary of the interna
tional committee, showed how the work
had grown during the past twelve years,
and said that while last year $12,000 cov
ered expenses, this year the greater work
would require at least $17,000. In the Mis
sionary Institute the topics for discussion
were "Financial Support of Missions"
and "The Students' Volunteer Movement."'
A large subscription toward the coming
year's expenses was raised among the
students during the financial session.
After the lecture by G. C. Hiekener con
cerning association literature and the
Bible instruction by H. B. Sharman, the
address of Rev. E. L. Chapman, D.D.,
president of the California Anti-Saloon
League, was delivered. Dr. Chapman took
the somewhat odd subject of "The Honest
Doubter." and gave a scholarly discourse
upon the person who honestly believes he
does not believe.
To-day was the banner day, athletically,
of the entire conference, being the inter
collegiate field day. Some leading Pacific
Coast athletes contested for the day's
honors and some records were made

that he is only Ijalf a roan.
He has little or no pleasure,

has brought on the sad state
of affairs â the follies of early
days, or the abuse, instead of
the use of, some of nature's '
gifts.

HARRISON G. OTIS GETS A COMMAND
Itie Los Angeles Editor Nominated for Brigadier-
General bu the President,
President McKlnley yesterday terminated the long fight In this State for
military honor, by sending to the Senate, among other nominations, the name
of Harrison Gray Otis to be brigadier general of California volunteers. The con
test for this distinction has been long and bitter, the three principal aspirants
being Major General John H. Dickinson, Brigadier General R. H. Warfield and
Colonel Otis. As none of them could command the support of the united Cali
fornia delegation, the President took the matter in his own hands and named his
friend and former comrade.
General Otis served with distinction throughout the rebellion, entering as a
private and rising by successive promotions through all the Intervening grades
to that of brevet lieutenant colonel of United States volunteers, this distinction
being confrrr.il upon him by the President "for gallant and meritorious ser
vices throughout the war." This promotion, as also that of brevet major, was
given him at the close of hostilities upon the recommendation of Major General
taftprward President) R. B. Hayes.
I'uring his forty-nine months' service In the field, General Otis took part !n
fifteen engagements, received two wounds in battle, gained seven promotions, and
commanded his regiment while yet a captain, being at the time thp senior offi
cer present for duty. His military service was rendered. in two of the proud
est of Ohio's regimentsâ first in the Twelfth Ohio Volunteers for three years,
ami afterward In the famous Twenty-third Ohio Veteran Volunteer Infantry, to
which He was transferred In 1864 through the consolidation of the two com
mands. The Twelfth has its fame preserved in the archives of the War De
partment In the form of a battle roll embracing fourteen engagements, with
total losses in killed and wounded aggregating 556 officers and men. The Twen
ty-third participated in seventeen engagements, and lost In action, from first
to last, 567 officers and men killed and wounded, out of a total enrollment of 2230.
being more than 25 per cent. The Twenty-third Is classed in history with the
celebrated "Three hundred fighting regiments" whose military record is given
In < 'olonel Fox's work, "Regimental Losses In the American Civil War, IS6I
1565" â each of which 300 regiments lost over 130 officers and men killed and
wounded in action.
The original colonel of the Twenty-third Ohio was William S. Rosecrans; E.
P. Scammon succeeded him; Rutherford B. Hayes was the third colonelâ each
being in turn promoted to a higher command. Stanley Matthews served for a
time as major, and subsequently became a Justice of the Supreme Court of
the T'nlted States. Robert P. Kennedy and "William C. Lyon were officers In the
regiment, and later became L'eutenant Governors of Ohio. Russell Hastings was
captain and then lieutenant colonel, served on the staff of General Hayes, and
was desperately wounded at the battle of Opequan. President William McKln
ley served as a private, commissar}' sergeant, and as a commissioned officer re-
Fpectively; he was breveted by the President, upon muster out, for gallant and
meritorious conduct throughout the conflict.
General Otis served in Rosecrans' first campaign In West Virginia <1861> , and
subsequently with the Kanawha division, Eighth Army Corps; the Army of
West Virginia, mountain department; the Ninth Army Corps, Army of the Poto
mac, and in the Army of the Shenandoah. His service ended in 1865 under Han
cock, commanding the Middle Military Department.
General Otis came to California in IS7C, and since 1882 has controlled and con
ducted the Los Angeles Times. â¢
Yesterday afternoon Major-Oeneral John H. Dickinson sent a message
In the following word? to P.rigadier-General Harrison G. Otis:
Colonel H. G. Otis, Ban Francisco, Cal. â Dear Sir: I have heard at Cazadero
of your appointment. I congratulate you most heartily. I hoped to get the
place, but am very glad that you have received the appointment, seeing that I
could not get It. I wish you all success. Very respectfully,
JOHN H. DICKINSON, Major-General Division N. G. C.
OPPOSITION TO THE NOMINATION OF OTIS.
WASHINGTON. May 27.â The nomination of H. G. Otis of Los Angeles
as brigadier general of volunteers was not surprising to the Callfornlans,
for as stated in The Call it was almost a foregone conclusion that the Pres
ident would appoint him. but it came sooner than expected.
One of the maddest men in the Senate is Frye of Maine, who has har
bored a revongeful feeling against Otis since the Los Angeles Times made
an attack against him, editorially, in which the Senator's integrity was as
sailed. Mr. Frye made a bitter fight against Otis' nomination. Secretary
AlK^r. while not openly opposing it, resented the editor's personal attac-ks
made on himself, and doubtlesÃ would secretly be glad to see the confirma
tion defeated. There is no doubt that Frye will actively oppose confirma
tion, and as he is a power in the Senate It is barely possible that, with
the assistance of the Democratic Senators, he may succeed.
WORKINGMEN OPPOSE OTIS.
Any action favoring the nomination of Colonel Harrison Gray Otis as brigadier
general stirs up a hornets' nest In labor circles. A committee was appointed at.
the last meeting of the Building Trades' Council to formulate an open letter
which would outline labor's feelings on the matter. The letter 1b as follows:
To President McKlnley and Senators White and Perkins; The dispatches of
to-day announce the nomination by President McKinley of Harrison Gray Otis to
be brigadier general of volunteers.
This aotion has been taken by the executive at the suggestion and upon the
recommendation of Senators White and Perkins after they and also the Presi
dent had received resolutions passed by even,' laboring body in California,
which was the- only method which the then enlisting soldiers had of expressing
their sentimentsâ as when once mustered in their lips are sealedâ denunciatory of
this man and his attitude with respect to the laboring people, and calling atten
tion to the fact that with such a person in charge of the California division of
volunteers it would not only render recruiting difficult, but would lead to dis
satisfaction and discord among the troops already mustered In.
The flower of our California manhood, now on their way to Manila to fight
for and maintain the honor and dignity of our flag, opposed to a man the
appointment of Otis, and their protest has been ignored. .
To place a man at the head of troops whose cordial hatred he enjoys can only
be regarded as an insult to the people of California, and particularly those from
whom the material for fighting Is drawn. It is true Colonel Otis has a war record,
and an honorable discharge with the rank of captain after service performed
during the Civil War, but his colonelcy is only a rank derived from civil life as a
staff officer. Thisls mentioned simply toshow that the appointment is not upon the
ground of service performed in war, but it is based upon service performed polit
ically, and for valuable and consistent work for the Republican party that this
man is rewarded to the exclusion of other available men whose deeds of valor
during the Civil War. and their clean and honorable records since, would have
made their appointments far more satisfactory, and reflected far greater credit
upon the executive, who, by the way, announced a few days ago that the only
qualification that he would consider in making army appointments would be that
of military ability. It is to be sincerely regretted that the praise which this
remark occasioned is to be so rudely and abruptly overturned by the appointment
of Colonel Otis, who will not enthuse, encourage or Inspire to valor those who
will be compelled to do or die under him.
We realize that all has been done to defeat this appointment that could have
been done in the premises, but now that the wishes of the people of California
have been Ig^iominiously ignored, we can but condemn this action both by the
President and Senators Perkins and White. While we are forced to accept the
Inevitable, it will only be done with a burning desire at some future time to
roturn the compliment, and extend such a return as will be fitting in the case.

keenly appreciative of the work of the Red Cross Society, is shown by tho
following resolutions unanimously adopted yesterday. The members of the
regiment feel that they have been unjustly treated by those in authority
in their own State. The regiment was called into service May 7, and the
men should have received $2 per day until mustered into the United States
service, but they were mustered out of the State service almost immedi
ately, and for six days, or until they were sworn in as volunteers, they
performed military duty without belonging to either the State or National
forces. The resolutions are as follows:
Whereas, the members of this company, from the time of their advent
Into the State of California, have been the recipients of what is undoubt
edly the most kindly, well-timed and generous hospitality that was ever
lavished by any community upon a non-resident body of soldiers, and es
pecially have the ladles of San Francisco, in a thousand ways, endeared
themselves to us by their profouna solicitude for our welfare; now, there
fore, be It
Resolved, By Company G, of Cripple Creek, Colorado, First Regiment
Colorado Volunteers, that we extend to the people of California our most
sincere and cordial thanks for the boundless hospitality shown to us, these
thoughtful attentions being in marked contrast to the action of the Colo
rado authorities, whoever they may be, whom we consider robbed us each
of nearly six days' pay by a manipulation of the mustering out of the
regiment from the State service of Colorado.
Resolved, As a manifestation of our complete appreciation of California
generosity, we especially pledge ourselves to render to our California com
rades in the field the utmost assistance in our power In any emergency
that Providence may allow to arise during the pending war, being desirous
to partially repay some of the benefactions received by us in this State.
Resolved. That the newspapers of San Francisco and Denver be fur
nished copies of these resolutions and requested to publish the same.
Signed by all the privates of Company G, First Regiment Colorado Vol
unteers.
RALLY ROUND THE FLAG, BOYS.
j nor-General of the Philippines, has es
j tabllshed his temporary headquarters in
, rooms 78 and SO and adjoining apartments
: on the fourth floor of the Palace Hotel.
I His immediate staff is composed of Major
Hale, Major Strothers, Captain Mott and
Captain James G. Blame Jr.
General Merritt spent yesterday in ac- |
quaintlng himself with the situation and
condition of the expeditionary forces now |
encamped in San Francisco, his informa- j
tion being furnished to him by Brigadier- j
General K. S. Otis, who has had charge .
of all affairs connected with tho Philip
pines at this point up to yesterday. No :
time has yet been set for the dispatching
of the second expedition to Manila, It is
predicted that it will sail inside of two ;
weeks. It will require at least that much
time to properly equip the forces and gel
the transports in good condition and load
ed with supplies.
General E. S. Otis, who is to go with the
second expedition, has not yet moved his
headquarters to Camp Richmond, but will
probably do so to-day or Monday, as the
tents for himself and staff are all ready !
for occupancy.
The first regiment of Montana volun- i
teers, consisting of about 900 men, will
arrive in San Francisco about 8 o'clock j
this morning and proceed to Camp Rich
mond.
The Eighteenth and Twenty-third regi
ments of the regular infantry will reach |
San Francisco from New Orleans some .
time to-morrow morning, and will also go '
direct to Camp Richmond, where all the j
forces destined for the Philippines are i
being massed. j
A battal'on of volunteers from North
Dakota will arrive Sunday morning, and
will be followed on Monday morning by j
another battalion from the same State.
Company G of the Fourteenth Regular
Infantry, which recenuy came from
Skaguay. has been ordered to report to
General Otis at Camp Richmond-
THE SEVENTH SELECTED.
Troops From the Southern
Part of the State Will Go
With the Next Expedition.
The gallant Seventh will form part of
the second detachment of troops to be
dispatched to the Philippines. While no
order*- have been issued to that effect. It
is known that General Otis is greatly
pleased with the splendid body of men
brought up from Southern California by
Colonel Berry, and while the colonel is
discreetly silent, it is believed he has re
ceived assurances from General Otis that
his command will be one of those selected
to go out on the next transports to sail
to Dewey's relief.
The Seventh California is now com
pletely equipped and ready to move at a
momenfs notice. It is splendidly drilled
and composed of great, strapping fellows
capable of enduring any amount of cam
paigning in the trying climate of the
orient Rtar.u in troiÂ»cai cautoroia. IM
heat of the Philippines has no terrors for
them. With two full infantry regiments
and a detachment of artillery selected
from her offering to 'the cause for the
first expedition, California may well feel
proud of the compliment paid her sona by
the discerning army officers.
VOLUNTEER SUPPLIES.
Contributions of Clpthing For
warded to Soldiers in Camp.
L. W. Storror, Edmund Godchaux and
Thomas Cunningham, seeing the condition
of the Kansas volunteers, went among
the merchants and in two hours, Thurs
day, secured articles as follows, which
were delivered to Major Whitman and by
him distributed to his men. The shoe men
of the city offered to supply the Govern
ment a regulation shoe in five days at
about 1500 pairs per day, but their offer
was rejected, yet they did not hesitate
to donate to the Kansas boys. The con
tributors were:
United Wnrklngmen B. A S. Co., 12 pairs
shoes; Rosenthal, Feder & Co., 12 pairs shoes;
Cohn Hirsh & â  "2 pairs socks; Levi Strauss
&Co 60 suits underclothing; Neustadter Bros.,
100 pairs socks; Cahn. Niokelsburg & Co.. 12
pairs shoes; Buckingham & Heoht, 12 pairs
plioes- Sachs liros., assortment of underwear
and towels; A. L. Bryan Shoe Company, 12
pairs shoes; Meyereteln Company, 60 pairs
drawers: Greenbaur.i. .Weil & Miehels, assort
ment of underwear and socks: J. C. Nolan &
Co 12 pairs shoes; Brown Bros. & Co., 24
suit? underwear: Heyneman & Co., assortment
of underwear; Son Bros. & Co.. gross of pipes:
Murphy, Grant & Co.. 10 dozen undershirts, 10
dozen pairs drawers.
Mrs. Samuel Rainey donated a wagon
load of clothing to the volunteers sta
tioned at the Richmond Camp Thursday,
consisting principally of underwear and
shoes. The donation is one of the largest
made, as yet, toward alleviating the
wants of the boys in blue, and was glad
ly welcomed and appreciated by the
sturdy Easterners, who spared no time
In substituting the new apparel for the
old. In addition to the clothing several
baskets of food were sent out to camp
which will be followed by more to-mor
row.
A Prompt Response.
When Redington & Co., druggists, were
apprised of the fact that the Nebraska
regiment was badly in need of certain

RIVALRY AMONG
THE REGIMENTS
All the Troops at Camp Richmond Eager
for Active Service.
The question of which regiment, or reg
iments, will compose the next expedition
ary force to Manila is the all-absorbing
topic of discussion among the oflicfers
and enlisted men of the various com-
mands now encamped at Camp Richmond.
Nearly all of the different command rs
declare that their commands are pr-ie- |
tically equipped for field service or y 111 j
be In a short time. As a matter of fact,
however, it is well known that not more
than two regiments are in shape for im- j
mediate service, and even these are la.'k- ,
ing in some of their supplies. Nearly
all of the requisitions have been fiieo
with the department quartermaster, but
the sudden rush of orders that have flood
ed this department have sorely taxed its
capacity, and it will be at least three
weeks before all of the troops here are
thoroughly equipped and ready for the
field.
When questioned as to the chances of
their command going with the next ex
pedition the various commanders looli
wise, but say little. It is a fact, how
ever, despite the many current rumors
to the contrary, that at present the Gov
ernment has not definitely decided what
troops will go on the next expedition. !
While the ability, length of time in ser- j
vice and experience of commanding of- J
fleers of the various commands, will have ;
material weight In the selection of thÂ» I
next convoy of troops, still the main
question that will be considered will be j
a regiment or a battalion's state of equip- j
tnent, and with the choice brought down
to this basis the indications are that the i
Seventh California. First Colorado, the |
Light Battery from Utah and the First j
Troop of Cavalry from the same State
will be among the favored commands.
To-morrow night will practically see the
Seventh Regiment completely equipped,
while the requisitions of the First Colo
rado will be illled by the middle of next
It is known that it is the intention of
the Government to send a troop of cav
alry to Manila with the next expedition,
but It has not yet been determined
whether the selected troopers will take
their horses with them or purchase others*
there Captain Caine's Utah troopers
are equipped with the exception of re
volvers The troop also has a fund of
MOO and an order from the Alta Club of
Bait Lake City to draw for any amount.
The two light Utah batteries need some
clothing and about 1000 rounds of am
munition. From this it would^seem that
the troops named will be the ones to go
to Manila, provided the next expedition
sails in the near future, and the arrival
of the regulars does not alter what now
appears to be the slate as prepared by the
department commander.
The First Wyoming Batallion has its
requisitions in, and needs about 300 pairs |
of shoes, 250 suits of underwear and 120,
0(i0 rounds of ammunition to complete its
equipment.
The Kansas, Nebraska. Idaho and Penn
sylvania forces have their requisitions in,
and of these the Kansas soldiers are un
doubtedly in the most pressing need of
clothes, shoes and underwear. Colonel
Little admits that his men need these
supplies, but he Indignantly denies the i
rumors that his men are starving. The i
Government has supplied all troops now I
in camp with abundant and sufficient ra
tions, and there is no lack of food, while
the donations of the Red Cross and good j
citizens generally have given every man j
A SURPRISE IN LOS ANGELES.
Some Joy, However, in the Prospect of His
Having to Leave the State.
LOS ANGELES. May 27. â The appointment of Colonel Harrison Gray Otis
was received here with surprise by all and with regret by many. To some it
gave a great deal of satisfaction from the fact that if the nomination of Otis is
confirmed by the Senate it will b4 necessary for him to leave the city and to be
absent for some time. To many this will be eminently satisfactory. Among the
workingmen and the members of the local Labor Unions the appointment of Otis
is most offensive. Otis has bitterly antagonized and lied about them for years,
and it is now proposed by the organizations and their leaders to use every effort
to show the United States Senate that Otis is not a fit man to be brigadier general
of volunteers.
Otis, on the other hand. Is striving by threats and over-persuasion to insure
his confirmation. He is having all the local organizations, commercial and other
wise, send telegrams to Washington urging his Immediate confirmation.
Taken as a whole, the nomination of Otis was received very coolly by the
people here. It was a surprise, but the public did not look upon ft as tney would
have regarded a similar consideration shown by the President to citizens more
worthy and more fitted.
complete supply. They received the no
tire at 2:30 In the afternoon, and at 6
o'clock the case filled with all sorts of
drugs and appurtenances was deposited
In the Nebraska hospital tent at the
Richmond camp.
Charles Brown & Son also generously
responded to the call for 100 tin cups and
other hardware for the same regiment.
To these, as well as to the many other
donors the officers, for themselves and
their men, wish to express their heartiest
thanks.
There axe only rare exceptions where
merchants fail to respond with libejal
contributions. Cots and mattresses for
the sick seem to be one of the crying
needs for nearly all the companies in
camp.

COLLECT NO FARES FROM SOLDIERS.
The Presidio and Ferries Railroad Company Gives Free
Rides to Enlisted Men.
At last the volunteers who came to their country's defense have
been recognized by the railroad companies. For more than a month
every enlisted man at the Presidio who wanted to come to the city
was either compelled to walk a distance of flve miles or pay his fare
on tbe cars that traveled to his encampment. Many were without
funds and therefore had to forego the pleasure of coming down town
or visiting loved ones.
Pleasure was depicted on the faces of the men when informed by
their respective commanders yesterday that hereafter they would be
permitted to ride free on the Presidio and Ferries Railroad line.
This was due to the generous action of President Goorge A.
Newhall of the road, and. Is only another of those acts of kindness and
patriotism that have been shown the men since the present hostilities
commenced.

plies to every regiment in camp, and therÂ«
is absolutely no truth in the reports of
destitution that have been circulated by
misguided but kindly intending citizens.
The Nebraska and Idaho troops have a
mild form of measles among them, but
these have been quarantined, and thÂ«
regimental surgeons are not fearful of an
epidemic of this disease. The Marine
Hospital reports a case of diphtheria from
the First Wyoming Battalion, but this is
denied by Major Foote, its commander,
who declares that the only ailment among
his men, outside of a few colds, is a num
ber of sore arms, caused by vaccination,
which has temporarily disabled about one
fourth of the battalion.
Major Moore and Captain Mallory were
in camp yesterday supervising the erec
tion of General Otis' headquarters, which
were established fe&Â£j>rday at the extreme
southwestern end Ox the camp. Captain
Mallory stated that he could not say when
General Otis would move his headquar
ters to Camp Richmond, but from the fact
that Colonel Pope, Colonel Lippincott,
Major Moore and Acting Assistant Sur
geon Harold were busy yesterday laying
off the ground for the brig;ule hospital, it
is believed General Otis will come out
either to-day or to-morrow and establisn
his headquarters, and immediately bri
gade the camp. The field hospital will
be on Point Lobos avenue.
Private Henry Pruett, Company H,
Seventh California Regiment, who died at
the Presidio Hospital on Wednesday of
pneumonia, was buried in the Presidio
Cemetery yesterday morning. The ser

St-venth, and Company H escorted the
remains to their last resting place, where,
after the coffin had been lowered, tho
grave filled and the usual volleys fired
over it. the bugler sounded taps and the
beautifully sad service was ended.
The pupils of the Mission Grammar
School sent a wagon load of provisions
to Camp Richmond yesterday, with in
structions that they be distributed among
the several regiments.
Quite a number of the men in the Ne
braska regiment are suffering from
cramps in the stomach. It is believed that
their sickness has been brought about by
the indiscriminate eating ot cakes, pies
and fruit brought them by visitors. Au
order was issued yesterday directing that
in future donations of foods and fruits be
left at the commissary department.
The Fourteenth United States Infantry
recruited twenty-three men yesterday.
The majority of them came well equipped
from Fort Sheridan and Fort Douglass.
The Twentieth Kansas Regiment was
inspected yesterday by Captain Mallory,
who expressed himself as being well
pleased with the command. The men have
been drilling hard and faithfully since
their arrival here and are now counted
among the best drilled volunteers. When
they receive their equipments, they will
be ready to take the field at a few hours'
notice.

members, their friends and others who are
Interested in reviving a name which existed
before the civil war and at the same time do-
Ing honor to those who are on their way to
the front.
There is no doubt that companies well or

GOOD FOR THE UNION-STREET LINE.
HEREAFTER no soldier wearing the blue will
pay fare on the Union street line. This is a
generous concession, and will be appreciated
not only by the soldiers themselves, but by the pub
lic, to whom the comfort of the soldiers is a matter
of close concern. While many of the soldiers have
been moved to the Bay District, there are still hun
dreds who in reaching the city will naturally depend
upon Union street. All the boys in the Fontana ware
house and those in the Presidio barracks will espe
cially be grateful for the favor of the company.
The Union street line runs into the Presidio, and
is the only one approaching that point. It runs its
cars from the ferry. It has been noted for its freedom
from accidents, a breakdown being a rarity, although
it traverses some of the steepest grades in the city.
This kindness will tend to add to its popularity.
The pattern set is an excellent one for the Southern
Pacific. The Bay District track is reached only by
Southern Pacific lines. Of course this great corpora
tion, having the matter called to mind by the liberal
ity of an associate, will not hesitate to follow so good
a pattern. We cannot believe the Southern Pacific
would take the nickels of the soldiers, particularly
when the added traffic in carrying civilians must
notably swell its receipts. It would be a pleasure to
announce to-morrow morning that the Southern Pa
cific had taken the hint. '
LOOTING UNCLE SAM'S STRONG BOX.
THE Transcontinental Freight Bureau is prob
ably made up of gentlemen who never ,vent upon
the highway with a pistol to woo a purse from
the passer-by. They would be above such an act, and,
besides, the purse might have little in it. Kept by
principle from one avenue of thrift, they sought
another: the}' became a freight bureau.
Possibly Huntington originated the expression,
"Charge all the traffic will bear," but he has no mon
opoly of the practice. The same lofty sentiment in
spiring the utterance is the sentiment of the freight
bureau; indeed the bureau may be regarded as the
crystallization of the sentiment.
The particular bureau under consideration has just
held a meeting at Milwaukee and put itself on record
as a collective swine by advancing the rates on war
material. This is done just at the time when there
mast be a considerable carriage of this, whereas or
dinarily war material is a rare sort of freight. If in
1 vice a road can afford to haul cartridges for $i a
hundred pounds, it can certainly better afford to do so
in war. when offerings are sure to be heavy and con
linuous. Yet the bureau advanced th: rate 50 per
cent, and on every article demanded by the exigency
of the moment made advances, some of them even
more outrageous.
This is business, but it has a savor of treason. It
is thrift, but the unholy thrift of the Shylock. The
roads agreeing to the imposition deserve no good will
from the country. If need arise the strong arm of
the Government should take temporary control of
them and make them seem decently patriotic by de
priving them of the privilege of looting.
THjE SPANISH AWNING DOWN.
OUR yellow neighbor has at last removed those
flaring red and yellow awnings which have
been a source of extreme irritation to all pa
triotic citizens. Every time a soldier passed within
range of these awnings a strong impulse would seize
him to tear them down and trample them in the dust.
IJesides being about the most unsightly things to be
found in the city, these awnings too strongly re
mind one that there are Spaniards on the earth. The
Examiner has been compelled by popular clamor to
remove them, and it is to be hoped that they will soon
.share the fate of a large portion of the Examiner's
circulation and be wafted to the breeze through the
tall chimney of the crematory.
Murderer Ebanks, who was hanged yesterday,
served to illustrate the folly of procrastination. He
richly merited all he got, having, indeed, earned it
twice over, but he exhibited a most annoying preju
dice against mounting the scaffold. By balking at
frequent intervals and appealing to all the courts in
turn he managed to keep alive for months and until
nfter the opening of the war. Had he promptly taken
liis medicine he would have received considerable
?pn^<* in the papers, but now a murderer is of no in
terest.
Even if Cervera bombard an Atlantic coast city
there will be the conflation o f kpowinjj where he is.
IS THIS LOYALTY?
ON Wednesday Senator Stewart made a free sil
ver speech against the war revenue bill. The
telegraph wasted words in telling the country
that it was "a long speech." His speeches are long
and also numerous. The matter before the Senate on
which he cannot make a long free silver speech has
not yet been introduced to the attention of that body.
If it were a proposition to recognize God in the con
stitution Stewart would speak on free silver.
The war revenue bill is an administration measure.
The President and his constitutional advisers know
the difficulties raised by the war and- the plans neces
sary to meet them. They know that our so-called
"insurgent allies" in Cuba and the Philippines are, in
v military sense, a myth. The report of Lieutenant
Rowan on the insurgent situation in Cuba discloses
the lack of force, the insubordination to discipline, the
incapacity to fight in military formation, of the guer
rillas under Gomez. The quality of Philippine patriot
ism is illustrated by the history of the rebel chief,
Aguinaldo, who raised the revolution and sold it out
to Spain for $800,000 spot cash. Half of this was to
have been divided among the common soldiers who
were enlisted under this bandit. He gobbled it all and
ran away to Hongkong, whereupon his deserted fol
lowers renewed their revolution, probably in the hope
of another cash deal with the home government.
Americans will have to do the fighting. Already
we have under arms and under call to arms 280,000
soldiers. Their pay alone is over $4,000,000 a month.
Their arms, equipment and maintenance cost many
times that sum monthly. We will soon be spending
on this war $5,000,000 a day; and Senator Stewart
made a long free silver speech. The flower of the
country is being hurried to the front, over land and
sea. The merchant marine is being drawn upon, and
soon we may have to do as England did in the
Crimean war and charter our troop ships from other
nations; and Stewart made a long free silver speech.
The sentiments of mercy and philanthropy among
the people are vitalized and working together to pre
pare comfort and cure for the ill and wounded. Com
mercial bodies and financial institutions are already
pouring out money to fill the treasury cf the Red
Cross; and Stewart made a long free silver speech.
With the news of the first battle wives will be
widows and children will be orphans. The sweet foun
tain of pity is already affluent, and men and women
are organizing to assuage the sorrow and succor the
distress that will be upon many an American home;
and Stewart made a long free silver speech.
The administration is pressed for resources to meet
the emergency. The President and his Cabinet have
not only the task of calling and equipping troops,
managing the delicate diplomacy required in war,
watching the enemy and meeting strategy with strat
egy, but they have to concert the financial measures
which must supply the sinews of war; and Stewart
made a long free silver speech.
In that speech he said of the administration revenue
bill: "It is the most miserable, villainous piece of
legislation ever enacted by a legislative body."
The British Parliament during the civil wars passed
bills of attainder. During our revolution it provided
for the use of wild Indians as British auxiliaries and
hired Hessians to fight us, which moved Burke to
demand the performance of a lustration to purge
England of the crime. The Venetian Council of Ten
arrested, endungeoned and tore out the eyes of the
innocent. The French revolutionary assembly made
the streets of Paris slippery with human blood and
sent Mme. Roland to the guillotine. But Stewart
made a long free silver speech asserting that Presi
dent McKinley's war revenue bill is more infamous
than all these.
The United States hold the center of the world's
stage at this moment. The nations are the audience.
Europe. Asia and Africa are the proscenium boxes
from which they watch us. We are engaged in an
altruistic war to lift burdens and enfranchise men.
The great tragedy of war is in action. All bells ring
the tocsin. The bugle calls to arms. The long roll
is beaten through the camps. Dewey's tired hand
grips the standard at the Antipodes, 7000 miles from
our coast. It is grand, magnificent: and Stewart
made a long free silver speech accusing our own
Government of the greatest infamies in history!
It is a question just how long the fathers who
give their sons to the ranks under call and commission
of the President will tolerate these long free silver
speeches, in which the Government that has sworn
them to allegiance by a soldier's sacrament is de
nounced as worse than that whose tyranny we are
expelling from her colonies.
GOMEZ TO THE FRONT.
GENERAL GOMEZ has announced to the peo
ple and the army of Cuba that be has begun the
publication of a weekly war bulletin for the
purpose of keeping them informed of the progress of
his arms and those of his ally, the United States. The
first of these bulletins informs the Cubans that their
troops are to be known no longer as insurgents, but
as soldiers of the regular army of the republic, and
will be expected hereafter to submit to discipline and
conform to the rules of civilized war. Warning is
given that any soldier or officer failing in such discip
line will be punished.
While the world in these days does not value bul
letins from commanding officers as of any great im
portance and would rather have one victory than
forty of them, nevertheless this manifesto will be re
ceived with considerable interest. The conservative
element of the American people has not had any
very exalted idea of Gomez and his army, and the
lack of any action of vigor on their part against the
Spaniards since the American fleet appeared off Ha
vana has rendered that element more than ever doubt
ful of their fitness either for fighting or for freedom.
The Gomez bulletins are going to be looked for,
therefore, with a good deal of curiosity. There are
many people who will be glad to learn once a week
what the island patriots are doing for their freedom
and what difference is notable in their tactics since
they have been transformed by decree from insurgents
to soldiers of the regular army of the republic.
The fault may not be due wholly to Gomez and his
soldiers, for the whole West Indian campaign, when
contrasted with that in the Philippines, has been
one of exasperating slowness; but even the most
ardent sympathizers with the Cubans have been sadly
disappointed with the inactivity in the patriot ranks.
It had been so often asserted by the Junta at New
York that all the patriots asked for was the recog
nition of the independence of their country by the
United States and that when this was given they
would at once leap forward to drive the Spaniards
home there was a general expectation that when the
United States began open war with Spain the Cu
bans would strike some effective blow at once and
force the war to the walls of Havana.
Weeks of hostilities have come and gone, more than
a month has passed and nothing has been done. Now
Gomez comes with a bulletin instead of a battle.
It is pot what was wanted nor what was expected. If
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., SATURDAY, MAY 28, 1898.
is not even satisfactory in itself. The only redeeming
feature is that it was designed merely as a salutatory,
and that as such it saluted undisciplined bands of
raiders by the title of soldiers of the regular army of
Cuba, warning them that if they do not act as such
hereafter they will be punished. This promises to
put an end to the mere looting and raiding of the
past and gives encouragement to the hope that Gomez
and his followers may yet prove effective allies in a
civilized war for the freedom of Cuba and the cause
of humanity.
IT is" characteristic of the demagogues who ride into
political power on waves of popular discontent to
celebrate their victories by alleging that they have
overcome "corruption" after a hard battle. This is
now being done by some of the disreputable support
ers of the new charter, who have fought in the hope
that their schemes of blackmail will be furthered by
the instrument. The tremendous combination of
"corruptionists" defeated on Thursday by these in
dividuals may be understood when it is considered
that the total vote polled against the charter was
12,025. This includes not alone those who honestly
thought the charter a dangerous experiment, but the
school teachers, policemen, firemen and politicians
who regarded it as inimical to their personal interests.
The vainglorious shouting of these demagogues be
comes ridiculous when the awful "corruptionists"
whom they overthrew are reduced to a few hundred
votes. The truth is the new charter was adopted, not
because a majority of those who voted for it have read
and digested it, but because there is a general desire
for a change in our organic system. This was the
great influence which operated to carry the new con
stitution in 1879. The campaign for that instrument
was accompanied, as this one has been, by a weak
Grand Jury, a corrupt School Board, a rotten Board
of Supervisors and a disgraceful Legislature. Prob
ably the Legislature of 1878 was the worst that ever
assembled anywhere. It is unavailing to reason with
the people when such object lessons in coiiuption are
before their eyes as have been before the eyes of the
people of this city during the past six months.
But the whys and wherefores of the late campaign
are no longer of interest. The existent fact is one
fifth of the voters of the city have fastened upon it an
entirely new experiment in charter legislation. Should
the Legislature ratify it, everybody should thereafter
endeavor to elect honest officials under it â particularly
an honest Mayor. Since 1879 the Supreme Court has
delivered a thousand decisions interpreting the new
constitution, and yet that instrument, which is shorter
than the charter, is still in question. We practically
know nothing upon the subject of making charters,
and it is not improbable that when the document car
ried on Thursday comes to be subjected to legal
scrutiny much of it will be found unconstitutional.
One thing, however, may be set down as settled
beyond doubt Unless the people capture the Mayor
and maintain possession of him they will be undone.
Nearly all municipal power has been transferred from
the present sources and lodged in the Mayor. If the
predatory classes are permitted to control this official
they will make short work of the taxpayers. There
is not much reason to fear the bugaboo corporations,
but there is great reason to fear the political bosses
who know so well how to organize and win at trfe
ballot-boxes when there is plunder in sight. Under
the divided responsibility of the consolidation act
there has been during forty years very little waste
and corruption. We trust the centralized government
the people hate now adopted will make a similar
record.
JUBILANT BAKERSFIELD.
THE rejoicings at Bakersficld over the comple
tion to that city oi the line of the Valley Road
fitly celebrated the accomplishment of another
step toward the emancipation of the great San
Joaquin Valley from the long domination of the
Soul hern Pacific monopoly that has baffled its enter
prises, thwarted its energies, checked its industrial
development and prevented its people and cities from
attaining the full measure of the prosperity they de
served.
The significance of the new road and the competi
tion ft has brought to bear upon the old time monop
oly are well understood throughout the State. Es
pecial emphasis was given to it in all the proceedings
of the jubilee at Bakersfield as at all other points
which in succession have been reached by the road
in its onward progress. It was amply and amus
ingly expressed by a local merchant. One window
of his store was fitted to show the condition of
Eakersfield in 1888, when the farmer pleaded for
lower freight rates and was met by the railroad with
the reply, "Oh, my dear sir, you are unfortunately off
the line of competition.," Another window showed
the condition of affairs since the arrival of the Valley
Road. This year the railroader pleads, "Mr. Farmer,
can't I induce you to let me haul your wheat?" and
is met with the answer, "Oh, my dear sir, you are
unfortunate in being located on the line of com
petition."
The extent of the benefit derived by Bakersfield and
the surrounding country from the change wrought in
the conditions of transportation by the construction
of the road can be measured, so far as the present year
is concerned, by contrasting freight rates now with
what they have been in the past; but the gain sure
to come with the future is incalculable. With cheaper
rates for freight there will be left in the hands of the
producers larger profits from all crops, and these
will result in a more liberal patronage of the mer
chants and the artisans of the cities. A healthy growth
will be felt throughout the whole San Joaquin region.
The breaking down of the railroad monopoly will
mean the upbuilding of a hundred industries.
The rejoicing at Bakersfield is to be by no means
the last of the many celebrations which mark success
ive steps in the progress of the Valley Road. Even
while Bakersfield was taking a holiday for her fes
tival the work at the other end of the line was being
pushed westward from Stockton toward the Bay of
San Francisco. There will be further rejoicing when
this westward movement reaches its destined ter
minus, and beyond that there will in the end be a great
and final demonstration of public satisfaction when
the Valley Road accomplishes its full usefulness to
the commonwealth by becoming part of a larger
system, thus giving the people emancipation from the
monopoly by providing a competing line across the
continent.
Citizens who pined audibly because the first call for
volunteers was answered almost wholly by the Na
tional Guard will soon have an opportunity to show
whether they really meant it.
It is disgraceful for School Directors to fight, but
if they will make it a war of mutual extermination the
public will be inclined to promote hostilities.
Weyler talks of his eagerness to invade this coun
try, and there is probably nothing he could do which
would please this country better-

PIGEONS AS CARBIERS.
According to the report of the French
Transatlantic Company made in Paris,
the experiments lately undertaken with
carrier pigeons on board the Bretagne
have proved satisfactory, thereby con
firming the stories that were published
here about the birds a few days ago.
It will be recalled tEUI one bird liberated
half way between Havre and New York
was caught in Connecticut. On the return 1
voyage Captain Renaud took from New ,
York about fifty birds, which were re- |
leased one, two and three days out. O/ ;
these the company's office in Havre has
no news. The birds remaining in hand
Wen freed while the vessel was 250 miles,
IST miles and 125 miles respectively from i
Havre. Most of these were back in Havre
or Rouen the same day, the remainder ,
the next or following days. None was
lost. It has been demonstrated that the
safest fliers were those trained in the sea
coast towns, the inland birds being liable
to lose their way too easily.

THE FRENCH ALLIANCEâ A. L...
City. France sent 6000 men with La
fayette and Rochambeau during the
Revolutionary War. It was understood
for a long time that the French Govern
ment was advancing the sum of $400,000
quarterly with which to purchase arms
and supplies and for fitting out armed
vessels, but it was afterward ascertained
by Benjamin Franklin that the King did
not furnish any money, but allowed Beau
marchais the right to take supplies from
the arsenals with the understanding that
they should be replaced. This led to a
suit which was settled in 1835 by the Uni
ted States Government paying to the
heirs of Beaumarchais a little in excess
of $200,000.

The last of the Kotzebue Sound fleet of
sailing vessels has got away for the gold
fields. The fast barkentine Catherine Sud
den left port with one of the most en
thusiastic parties of gold hunters aboard
that has ever left San Francisco. They
had been living on the vessel for nearly
a week before sailing day, so they knew
exactly what to expect when they got
to sea. The accommodations were first
class and the food all that could be de
sired. C. Dickey, who engineered the
Catherine Sudden expedition, went out
on the vessel as far as the Nine Fathom
buoy, and was given three hearty cheers
as tie boarded the tug. The gold hunters
were in the host of sDlrits when he left,
and all of them expect to come back with
wealth to spare. Among those who sailed
on the barkentine were:

BENEWAL OF VOWS.
Gentlemen's Sodality Will Inaugu
rate the Ceremony on Sunday.
On Sunday morning, May 29. at the 7:30
mass, in their own chapel on Hayes street,
the Gentlemen's Sodality attached to St.
Ignatius Church will inaugurate there a
ceremony which has been held annually
by kindred organizations in Europe, that
is "The renewal of their pledges of con
secration to the Blessed Virgin Mary,"
which means the promising ot the leading
of a good life by charitable works, fre- j
quenting the sacraments regularly, and
the encouragement of devotion to the
Blessed Mother of God.
The chapel has been specially decorated
for the occasion, and the grotto, which
is a fac-simile of the one in ;Lourdes, will
be ornamented with fairy lights and a
profusion of flowers.
The membership of the Gentlemen's
Sodality at present is 700, from all walks
in life, and the Very Rev. Father Freiden,
S. J., president of St. Ignatius College,
has generously given them a large room
adjoining their library where they might
meet and enjoy themselves in a social
manner.
The Rev. J. Hickey, S. J., will preside
at the Sunday, morning ceremony, and all
the officers will be present.

SEWERAGE AT FOLSOM PRISON.
The Prison Commissioners Will Ask
a Loan From the State
Examiners.
The Prison Commissioners, at a meet
ing held in this city Thursday, decided to
ask the State Board of Examiners for au
thority to draw $15,000 for the purpose of
constructing a proper system of sewer
age at the Folsom prison. The amount
asked for would, if taken out of the reg
ular appropriation for the maintenance
of Folsom. leave a deficiency of that
amount; hence the directors concluded to
ask the (.xaminers to authorize its ex
penditure.
Should the examiners accede to the rec
ommendation of the directors the amount
will be used in the construction of a
proper system of sewerage at the Fol
som prison.
The water supply of Sacramento, which
has been recently discussed through the
public press and by the city authorities
of that municipality, is the motive which
has prompted the directors to appeal to
the Board of Examiners for authority to
expend the amount asked for.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAT 28, 1898.
SHE REMEMBERED THE POOR.
The Late Mrs. Frank M. Plxleu, Whose Heart and Hand Were
' Ever Open to the Needy.
THIS is the last photograph of Mrs. Frank M. Pixley, widow of the late editor
Df the Arjonaut who died suddenly of heart disease at her summer home
In Corte Madera on Thursday night. The news of her demise was received
with regret by all who knew her. as she was beloved by every one for
her kindness of heart and charitable disposition.
Although a sufferer from an affection of the heart she was otherwise enjoy
ing the best of health. On retiring she made no complaint, and the suddenness
of her taking off surprised and grieved every one. Dr. fa. S. Kahn had for some
time past treated her for the malady, and shortly after her death he was In
formed and was profoundly shocked.
Mrs Pixley's birthplace was Philadelphia, and she entered this world In 1833.
She was the only child of Captain and Mrs. John L. Van Reynegom, one of
the. Quaker City; s oldest families. She met her future husband In this city in
1553 and despite parental objection was married. While her husband was en
gaged in his chosen field during those stirring times Mrs. Pixley rarely went out
side her own circle. Her deeds of kindness and charity made tier known through
out the city. She was deeply engaged in church work and was a benefactor of
the Episcopal Church of St. Mary the Virgin.
Before her husband's death she adopted Herbert Harrington Weller, the 2
year-old son of Herbert B. and Fannie M. Weiler. The latter had been the
adopted daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Pixley.
HARMONY
FOR THE
DEMOCRATS
A Committee of One
Hundred Appointed,
MUCH TROUBLE EXPECTED
SULLIVAN FORCES CLAIM A
VICTOHr.
The Real Contest Will Come To-Day
When the Report is Brought
Before the State Or
ganization.
A committee consisting of one hun-<
dred Democrats has been selected to
take charge of the affairs of the local
Democracy.
The work of selecting the committee
was completed last evening by the nire
members of the State Central Commit
tee who were delegated ome time ago
with power to bring about harmony in
the ranks of the party in this city. Jt
was first projosed to decline to recog
nize the claims of both the Harney and
Sullivan factions and to appoint a new
County Committee, to consist of five
Democrats from each of the Assembly
districts. With a slight modification
this plan has been adhered to, but in
stead of giving each of the Assembly
districts equal representation it was
decided to select the members of the
new committee at large, regardless of
territorial boundaries. This was done,
and as the friends of the Sullivan fac
tion had a majority of one in the Bub
committee the majority of their ap
pointees are anti-Harneyites. This, as
a matter of course, is not satisfactory
to the followers of Governor Budd, and
as a consequence there is trouble brew
ing.
The real contest for the control of the
Democracy of San Francisco will be
made in the State Central Committee
when it meets to-day. The Committee
of One Hundred is not satisfactory to
the Budd faction, a fact that will lead
to an attempt to nullify the acts of the
Committee of Nine. This attempt will
take the form of an amendment to the
report of the subcommittee. The
amendment will be to the effect that
the Committee of One Hundred be in
structed to conduct a primary election
for the purpose of selecting the mem
bers of a new county committee which
is to have the direction and control of
the affairs of the local Democracy.
Should such an amendment be adopt
ed the Committee of One Hundred
would then be robbed of any power or
authority other than that of conduct
ing the primary. This being accom
plished it would then cease to exist.
Instead of being in itself the county
committee, as it was intended to be, it
would be only the instrument through
which the county committee is to be
brought into life.
This plan Is a bold one and is only
rendered feasible by the fact of the
supposed power of Governor Budd in
the Central Committee. If it be true
that he has control of the State organi
zation then it will be possible for him
to carry the scheme through and thus
rob his opponents of their apparent vic
tory. The Harney Democrats have
practical control of the party organiza
tion in the city and should a primary
for the election of a new county com
mittee be ordered they would no doubt
be able to secure the election of a ma
jority of their candidates. With such
a situation in prospect to-day's meet
ing of the State Central Committee
should not be devoid of interest.
FAMOUS BEAR KILLED
ON THE COTTONWOOD.
"Old Club Foot" Fights a Desperate
Battle Against Three Well-
Known Hunters.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., May 26.â The
gTeat, fat, powerful carcass of "Old
Clubfoot," the famous grizzly known to
all old California hunters and prospectors
on this coast, arrived In Bakarsuald thi*
afternoon. She was killed last Monday
on the head of Cottonwood Creek, near
the southern boundary of Kern County.
It required a two days' battle of three
men with long-range Winchesters to
bring down the monster, besides the as
sistance of a number of dogs. These men
had been hot on the trail of "Clubfoot"
more than a week. Last Sunday morning
two of them came in sight of her, and the
battle opened at a distance of 600 yards,
and ranged from that down to a few
yards. It was a most desperate and
thrilling encounter. Finally the hunters'
ammunition gave out. Late in the even
ing they called off their dogs and went to
camp. Early next morning they returned,
and with the aid of the dogs "Old Club
foot" was again found. The hunters
opened tire nn her, and the battle raged
all day before the monster gave up the
ghost." She weighed 11M pounds. Sh.' W9M
'<i.. feet long, ''â¢ feet across back, with head
ls'inches broad. The teeth of the animal
were almost worn oft", showing her srreat
age The plucky hunters were John A.
Johnson, Jean Pool ami James McKen
z!<\ who say that 'â¢Clubfoof has ranged
the mountains of Kern, Santa Barbara
and Ventura for the past thirty years.
She has killed a numbor of men In battle,
and a whole herd of cattle, in her day.
Eleven bullets were fired into her head
and neck. Nearly a hundred shots were
fired. _.
PLENTY OF FUN
FOR THE SPORTS
KNOCK-OUTS, TRY-OUTS AND
HURRICANE GOES.
An Interesting Entertainment of
Varied Delights Provided by
the Excelsior Athletic
Club.
Knockouts, tryouts and hurricane
flphting was the rule at the Excelsior
Athletic Club's fistic entertainment last
night. Nearly 800 sports sat around the
ringside and seemed to derive more en
joyment out of the bouts than "is g-enerally
had at one of the big SO**.
Jimmy Reilly managed to land his right
on Jack McMahon's Jaw during the lat
ter end of the first round of their eight
round go and ended his chances of vic
tory Before the final coup de grace was
delivered however, M< Mahon proved him
self the cleverer by repeatedly landing on
Reilly at will. His blows lacked strength,
and his more heavy opponent was able
to withstand them. McMahon weighed
124 and Reilly 130 pounds.
Sergeant Brophy ordered the eight
round bout between Pat Brown and Jim
Lee stopped in the middle of the second
round as he feared Brown might be hurt.
"Kid ' Parson, a young arrival from Ohio,
was tried out by Jimmy I-awler. Four
rounds of rapid sparring was indulP''d in,
resulting in Parson receiving a closed eye
and being knocked down by his more
Bhifty opponent.
Mr' Caveny recited "The Picture on the

culations. His work was so realistic that
the crowd was moved to repeated ap

A FARMER IS RUN
OVER BY A MOWER.
Robert Headly, a Prominent Man
Living Near Napa, Is Proba
bly Fatally Injured.
NAPA, May 25. â A distressing accident,
which will probably result fatally, oc
curred this afternoon on the county road,
three miles from here, near Carneros
Creek. Robert Headly, a prominent far
mer, while driving his mowing machine
from one field to another along the road,
stopped to talk with a neighbor. The
team suddenly became frightened and
commenced to run. Mr. Headly grabbed
the horses by the bits and hung on while
they dragged him along. He finally had
to let go, and the mowing machine passed
over his body. Mr. Brown, with whom he
had been talking, picked up the uncon
scious man and carried him to his resi
dence, where he still remains unconscious
up to a late hour to-night. Drs. Haun
and Kahn of Napa were summoned. The
Injured man has a wife and a large num
ber of children.

BISMARCK WAS
NOT INTERVIEWED
But the Correspondent of a News
Agency Made Him Say Con
siderable.
BERLIN, May 26.â Recent dispatches
from New York, stating that an Amer
ican news agency had interviewed
Prince Bismarck on the eventuality of
an Anglo-Saxon treaty of alliance
caused me to make careful inquiries
concerning the amount of truth in this
rumor, which bore on its face â at least
for any one at all familiar
with the habits of the Prince â
proof of its inaccuracies. As a
matter of fact. Prince Bismarck
would never for a moment talk with
the press men about such a subject,
and there are about two chances in 100
that the reporter of the American news
agency, in all events in his capacity as
a journalist, would get a word on such
a subject with Prince Bismarck. As
a matter of fact, the journalist in ques
tion was refused admittance to the
Prince's residence.
TWO OFFICERS AMD A
TRAILER ARE KILLED
Two Fugitive Train Robbers Whom
They Had Cornered Shoot

ALBUQUERQUE, N. Mex., May 26.â
Under Sheriff Frank Vigil, Deputy Sher

were killed yesterday by the two despera
does who held up the Santa Fe passenger
train last Tuesday. The two officers,
with a number of Pueblo Indian trailers,
had surrounded the camp of the robbers
on Alamosa Creek, sixty-five miles west
of Bclen. When the robbers were order
ed to surrender they opened fire with
Winchester rifles. One of the robbers is
thought to have been wounded, but both
escaped, leaving their horses. When the
news reached Santa Rita to-day another
large posse started in pursuit.

YOUNG AT SIXTY.
Serene comfort and happiness in ad-
vanced years are realized by compara-
tively few women.
Their hard lives, their liability to se- j
rious troubles on account of their pecu-
liar organism and their profound igno-
rance concerning' themselves, all com-
bine to shorten the period of usefulness
and fill their later years with suffering 1 .
Mrs. Pinkham has done much to make
women strong. She has given advice
to many that has shown them how to
guard against disease and retain vigor-
ous health in old age. From every cor-
ner of the earth there is constantly com-
ing the most convinciug statements
from women, showing the efficacy of
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound in overcoming female ills. Here
is a letter from Mrs. J. C. Orms, of 220
Homer St. , Johnstown, Pa., â¢which is
earnest and. straight to the point :
" Deab mW Pi.vkham: â I feel it my
duty to tell all suffering women that I
think your remedies are wonderful. I
had trouble with my head, diz y spells
and hot flashes. Feet and hands were
cold, was very nervous, could not sleep
well, had kidney trouble, pain in
ovaries and congestion of the womb.
Since taking your remedies I am better
every way My head trouble is all
gone, have no pain in ovaries, and am
cured of womb trouble, I can eat and
sleep well and am gaining in flesh. I
consider your medicine the best to be
had for female troubles."
The present Mrs. Pinkham* experi-
ence in treating- female ills is un paral-
lelled, for years she worked side by
side with Mrs. Lydia E. Pinkham, and
for sometime past has had sole charge
of the correspondence department of
her great business, treating by letter
as many as a hundred thousand ailing
women during a single year.

of Ripans Tabules, said : " I used to have lots
of trouble with my heart, caused, my doctor
said, from an imperfect digestion. Amongst other
remedies I used Ripans Tabules, and they are the
finest thing I ever tried. They ' knocked out ' the
indigestion, and relieved the trouble in my heart,
whatever it was. Since I began to use them, my
bowels are regular, and I feel ten per cent better.
I can't recommend them too highly."

MARKSMEN WHO ARE
DEATH TO SPANIARDS.
Amonp the fellows brave at heart and
strong of muscle who left snug positions
in this city to enlist in the volunteer
service were th% popular marksmen Al
bert Ehrenpfort, president of the Cali
fornia Schuetzen Club, and H. C. Man
gels. Into lieutenant of the San Francisco
Fusiliers, who enlisted a.s a private in the
First Regiment, which loft this city for
the Philippine Islands last Thursday.
Those two able representatives of the
Golden West will certainly not waste
much of Uncle Sam's ammunition if they
are called upon to give an account of
thomsnlvcs before the Dons, as they are
b<!h remarkably fine shots.
â  Ehrenpfort, who acted as range cap
tain of Company H, California State
Militia, made at the last monthly medal
shoot he attended on April 10 the highest
More ever recorded with a Springfield
rifle in Sehuetzen Park, namely, 49 out
of a possible 50. at 200 yards range. Young
Ehrenpfort is a son of the well-known
capitalist and founder of the California
Bchuetsen Club, William Ehr**npfr>rt, who
In IBW was a member of ;h" first Cali
fornia rifle team that captured the Cen
tennial trophy in Philadelphia from teams
of crack marksmen representing all
States in the Union.
When Philo Jacohy, the father of our
California champions of the rifle, visited
the steamer City of Peking prior to Its
depn.miro for a foreign country, young
Ehrenpfort and his companion Mangels
wero first to offer their hands to Philo
in a parting good-by, and the last words,
of Ehrenpfort. whioh still ring- in the ears
of Philo. wore: "Philo, old boy, we 'are"
oiT to fight the battles of our country,
and we shall not forget your old teaching
of how to pull a steady trigger with two
fingers. I hope my aim will be as deadly
on the Spanish foe aa it has been at the
buUseye. Farewell."
MAY CHANGE THE
DATE OF
THE 20-MILE RACE
A motion will probably be brought be
fore the board of governors o* the C. A.
C. C. at its next meeting, June 4, t^ post
pone the running of the annual 20-mile
road race from the second Sunday in
Juiy to the first Sunday after Admission
day in September. The July date is an
awkward one, as many of the best riders
are in the country or out of training at
that time. In September they are in con
dition for the September 9 races, or pre
paring for the October 10-miie race, and
this time of the year Is also better suited
for a long distance grind like tho 20-mile
affair.
E. A. Bozlo, formerly of the Imperial
Cycling Club, now of the Olympic Club
Wheelmen, will try for the world's five
mile record of 11:112-5, over the San Le
andro-Haywards course to-morrow, paced
jby tandems. Bozio has the speed, and if
j the course is good and the pacing fast
enough he should succeed in creating a
new mark.

Secretary Scovern has just received the
waterproof covers for the road book, and
they will be delivered free to members of
the C. A. C. C. on application, together
with the book. The new road book is
eliciting most favorable comment wher
ever it is seen. It is a work that should

Talk about amateur organizations win

Out of fifty games played they have
never met defeat, and owing to the un
certainty of baseball this record is re
markable. Manager J. A. McCarren, in
ppeaklng of his great team, says that It is
composed principally of boys who, owins
to their other business occupations, are
unable to practice, and yet put up as
strong a game as could Vie played under
the circumstances. "We are prepared to

this move will lose to the league over

Those who keep their fingers on the
pulse of the trade say that the value
of advertising in the dally newspapers
was never more clearly demonstrated
than during the recent dull period, when
those who advertised persistently were
practically the only ones who did any
business. Concerning the cause of the
dullness, the war and the unsettled
weather have been abundantly blamed;
but it is a question whether these twin
reasons are all-sufficient. It is a fact that
tin- 1896 models did not show enough im
provements over the '97 wheels to war

Center Fielder Pyne's deplorable actions
in Sunday's game at San Jose, where he,
from all accounts, deliberately let a ball
go by him. giving Iberg a three-base hit
on what should have been but a single,
is the cause of miu-h discussion among
both managers and players. It is a well
known fact that he has been endeavoring
to secure his release from Manager Cof
froth for some time, and falling, has re
scrted to work which is hardly in line
with his general make-up, and which will
never accomplish tho object desired.
Manager Coltroth is at a loss regard
ing Pyne's grievances. He says that a
short time ago he offered Pyne his re
lease, but after a little arguing the trou
ble was amicably adjusted, as Pyne left
him apparently satisfied with the new
arrangements. At San Jose, however, hos
tilities were resumed, on Pyne again ask
ing for his release, Coffroth refusingâ and
justly so â to give it. Then occurred the
little incident In the field. Pyne would
not field the ball, and instead of batting
as he- always does, turned around left
handed, greatly to the surprise of every
body. Whatever the real trouble is, Mr.
Pyne on finding that his release would
not be granted, should never have resort
ed to such ungentlemanly methods in his
endeavor to secure it anyhow. A con
tract Is binding. In baseball, whether it
be on tho Pacific Coast or in the National
THE GUN MEN
READY
FOR THE TRAPS
During the past week the sharp crack
of the shotgun (owing, of course, to the
smokeless powder) at the Ingleside trap
shooting grounds attracted the attention
of passersby, who inquired what was up.
The inquisitively inclined soon learned,
however, that the men who were prac
ticing at clay birds with shotguns were
not exactly getting into condition for a
race with the Spaniards, but instead were
simply practicing up for the annual tour
nament of the California Inanimate Tar
get Association, which will commence on
Sunday and will end on Monday.
Apart from the added money, which Is '
strong, the purses will be Increased by
entrance fees and the deduction from
pools of 2 cents a bird Instead of 3 cents,
as in previous tournaments. Three cents ]
will be deducted only in medal and trophy i
events, where the entrance money in j
whole or in part is to go to the winners j
of such events in the last tournament. !
The extra 1 cent a bird will bo applied
on account of the purses guaranteed by
the association. In all such events there -
will also be a side pool of $1, from which i
there will be no deduction on account of '
birds.
Under the new arrangement of pools,
wlih money added, the pool in every
event should run from $ I JO to $100, thus in
suring a very generous return to tho win
ners.
Purses will be divided under the regu
lar class shooting system. Three moneys
will be given in fifteen-bird events, and
four moneys in twenty-bird events. The
usual cash prizes are given for high av
erages.
The grounds, although owned by the
Olympic Gun Club, will be under the ex
clusive control of the association, which
ia to make all the profit to be derived
from the trapping of birds both in the
tournament and in previous practice
shooting. The team shooting will be on
an entirely new set of traps.
Shooters from the interior, visiting the
tournament, may arrange their trips to
participate in the State live bird tourna
ment, to be given by the Olympic Gun
Club on June 3, 4 and 6. Programmes of
this tournament may be obtained from
club secretaries, or at any gun store. The
two tournaments come within a few days
of each other, and combined, promise to
make tha greatest shooting carnival ever
held in the West. It is hoped that every
member of the association will aim to be
present.
The first event will be fifteen singles;
second event the same; third event will
doubtless be warmly contested, as it will
be for the beautiful E. T. Allen cup;
twenty singles, entrance $1, class shoot
ing and four moneys. This cup must be
won three times before it becomes per
sonal property. Fourth event, Olympic
Gun Club medal match, twenty singles;
fifth event, twenty singles for diamond
medal, which must also be won three
times to become private property; sixth
event, fifteen singles; seventh event, Rooa
trophy, three-man team contest.
On the second day of the tournament
there will be seven events contested, the
final being the grand twenty singles per
man team shoot for the association
trophy, emblematic of the club cham
pionship for t'-nms of six men from eacn
club. This trophy must also be won
three times before it becomes the prop
erty of any club. and. until so won, will
be shot for at each annual tournament.
As exclusively stated in yesterday's Call
the Empire Gun Club members feel aÂ»
happy a.s clams in blue mud. owing to
the fact that the Olympic Gun Club haÂ»
accepted a challenge to a team shoot.
League, a player has but two alterna
tives, when things do not suit himâ stop

and consequently the best and proper
thing for Pyne is to remain with the San
1' ranciscos, which is one of the best
teams in the league, and by all means
be happy. When a player affixes his sig
nature to a baseball contract, the rest
of the world should appear as v blank,
so far as his getting into It is concerned.
My own case should be a warning to all
young players aspiring to become Na
tional Leaguers. I signed a Baltimore
contract in 1897. and as far as baseball is
concerned I signed my life away. The
compensation offered this season was just
5900 below tho estimate which I placed
upon my services. But what 1 and
others think of my ability "cuts no Span
iards" with the Baltimore Club. I signed
a contract with them. I can play with
no other team of the National League
without my release, and I have not asked
for it, simply because I know they would
not give It. The reason they will not
come to my terms is because they real
ize my inability to play with another
club so long as they hold my signature,
not -because I am not worth the money
I ask. Way down deep they figure that

THE JUNE REGATTA
AT EL CAMPO.
The management of the El Campo pic
nic ground has decided to hold a regatta
for amateur oarsmen and scullers, under
the auspices of the Pacific Amateur Ath
letic Association, a branch of the Ama
teur Athletic Union.
The regatta will take place on two days,
June 26 and July 17. On the first of these
the single scullers will race; on the second
the barge events will be contested. There
will be senior and junior outrigger skiff
races and a race in shells for seniors;
also a special match between A. Pape of
the Dolphin Boating Club and William
McCausland of the Ariel Rowing Club.
The management of El Campo, with the
co-operation of the association, will offer
gold medals for the various events and a
handsome trophy for the winner of the
special match. On the second day of the
regatta, July 17, the barge racesâ senior,
intermediate and juniorâ will be held.
Crews, are going out every night pre
paring for the Ariel Rowing Club re
gatta, which will be held on June 12 in
stead of June 5, as at first intended. For
the senior outrigged skiff race at the El
Campo regatta the Ariel Club will enter
Frank Wilson, James Wilson and George
Pht'lan, and H. Wittkupf for the shell
race for seniors. There are several en
tries for the Junior outrigged skiff race
at the Ariel regatta, and from the results
of this race the representatives of the
Ariels at the El Campo regatta will be
selected. Work has begun on the new
barge for the Ariel Club, but it will not
be ready for use at the club regatta.
A crew of the Alameda Boat Club tried
the new bargejast Sunday, and made fast
time. The senior crew, consisting 1 of
Eugene Hadcock (bow), William Hansen
(No. 2), At wood Webb (No. 3), Fred
Ayres (stroke) and Ed Hansen (cock
swain), is the same as last year, and is
going out regularly for practice. The
Alameda Club will enter this crew for the
barge races at El Campo, and will be
represented in the snifcie events also.
Jack Lewis will probably enter in the
junior outrigged skiff race, and should
stand a very good chance of winning.
Coney Ochs of the Pioneer Rowing Club
goes out regularly in his skiff, and will
represent the Pioneers in the junior out
rigged skiff race at El Campo. The club
will also enter two or three crews for the
barge events.
Robert McArthur, Matt Breen, C. Jen
kins, "Doc" Flynn, J. Pallas, J. E. Scully,
and J. Lyons were at the South End Row
ing Club house on Sunday, but there was
not much doing. Many of the ciub mem
bers went out to the encampment at the
Presidio to visit and bid farewell to their
soldier friends.
The weather was so rough at Tiburon
on Sunday that only two or three mem
bers of the Olympic Club visited the boat
house, and no boats were taken out.
At the last monthly meeting of the
Dolphin Boating Club the following
amendment to the constitution was of
fered: "That the number of members be
limited to seventy-five; that any gentle
man of good moral character be eligible
to membership, provided he be 21 years
of age or over and an American citizen;
that no person who has been expelled or
suspended from any other boating or
athletic club be eligible to membership."
The nominating committee has sub
mitted the following candidates for office:
President, Joseph Laib Jr.; vice-presi
dent, Fred \V. Woerner; recording secre
tary, J. S. Earls; financial secretary, F.

hold out every year, will see the hope
lessness of fighting tho major league and
will eventually come around, but it is al
ways best to know the kind of a fellow
you are dealing with before jumping at
such silly conclusions. Mr. Pyne's case
is similar to mine. He cannot get away
from the Frisco team without the con
sent of Manager Coffroth, and, I would
advise him to continue playing where he
Is. The Frisco Club is not so strong that
it can afford to part with its good play
ers, and as every attempt of Mr. Pyne
to secure his release has failed he must
either finish the season with the San
Kranciscoa or join the volunteers, which
would not be a bad idea. On arriving
at Manila he could familiarize the na
tives with our great national pastime,
cultivate his hitting optics by batting
cannon balls, and then be appointed um
pire of the Philippines by President Mc-
Kinley through petition signed by all
handlers of the mystic sphere.
Pitcher Thomas is still the "real thing"
in Fresno.
Pitcher Harvey's feat of striking out
three men in succession with the bases
full, which he did in Sunday's game
against Santa Cruz, is the best piece of
box work that has been witnessed in Sac
ramento for some time past. This game
the "Beachcombers" lost by one run and
should practice up in batting. If they
cannot do better than this in a pinch it
is time that the "ancient order of ham
mer throwers" did break a few records.
GREAT IS THE
SPORT
OF COURSING
Although the weather indications are
not favorable for outdoor pastimes, still
it can be taken for granted that an enor
mous crowd will be present this after
noon to witness the run-down of the
largest stake that has ever been run at
Union Coursing Park.
The features at Ingleslde to-day will be
an open event for the flyers, a sapling
contest and a consolation stake for the
cracks unfortunate enough to go down in
their initial trials of the former. At
Union Park the interest will center In an
open, a puppy and a sapling stake. In
the number of contestants Union Park
greatly exceeds. At Ingleslde there mu3t
still be drawn the "consolation," but the
quality of the long-tails Is unprecedented.
The sport will commence at the usual
hour at both resorts and continue through
Sunday and Monday.
The chief stake at Ingleslde this week
looks to have many chances. The Dean
dogs were not at their best last week.
Lowe & Thompson's kennels are in much
the same condition.
At Union Park the Sullivan or Rosseter
dogs seem to have a good chance of win
ning the big event. It's about Curtis'
"turn," however, and Log Boy may push
to the front.
The puppy and sapling stakes at both
parks are liable to land "any old place."
Three days Is a long period of straight
work for youngsters.
Death has again visited a heavy hand
on the leashmen during the week, and
this time it was William Murphy who an
swered to the call. The deceased was one
of the oldest and most respected leashmen
on the coast, and the report of his demise
brought a sudden drooping of the eyelids
and a hush of stillness on many "thou
sands.
St. Patrick should make a hot bid for
laurels ana coin among the saplings at
Ingleside to-day.
Dave Hooper is beginning to cut con
siderable hay on the sward. WithKoolawn
he won $50") at Ingleside on Mayday, and
with the same annexed the stake at Union
Park again last week. He purchased
Bendalong ten days ago, and at Ingle
side last Sunday pulled down second
money, i'rior to winning the big Shea
stake, too, Koolawn had annexed a sec
ond and divers lesser moneys.
Leashmen should not forget that the
moneys taken In at Union Coursing Park
on Monday next will be handed over to
the ladies "who are connected with the
Red Cross Society, and as the cause is
good and noble It is to be hoped that the
lovers of coursing will turn out en masse
on that day.
The winners at Union Park, to
day look to be as follows: All
oge stake â Vanity Fair, Mystery, Fire
ball, Hettie M, Van Chloe. Log
Boy, Jester, Border's Valentine, Diana,
Glenwood, Tess'.e Fair. Metallic, Minne
apolis, Mira Monte, Commodore, Senorita,
Maud S, Forget, Sylvanus, Sportsman,
Arapahoe, Jesse Moore, Douglass, Flying
Buck. Llssak, Silkwood, Jimmy Hope,
McKniley, Magnet, Bonlta, Firm Friend,
Laurelwood. Lady Campbell, Mission Boy.
White Lily, Lord Byron. Winona, Move i
On, Rusty" Gold, Olga". Olrin. Eclipse.
Puppy stakeâ Thornhill, Daisy Dean, |
Killarney Lass, Jersey Lily, Morning
Glory, Royal Oak, Magnesia, Sunbeam,
Liberty Bell, Dempsey Lass, Meta,
Quiver", Rest Assured.
Sapling stakeâ Statesman, Royal Flush.
Sheridan, Petronlus, Lalla Rookh, Heather
Dell, Motto, Admiral Dewey, Trinket and
Flush.
At Ingleslde the probable winners of
the run-down are: Flashlight, Prince of
Fashion, Moondyne. Van Nida, Koolawn,
Firenzl, Occidental. Bendalong, Cross
patch, Pacific Queen. Lass o' Orowrie, Vic
tor, Master McGregor, Connemara. Little
Dorritt. Lady Jane, Benicla Boy, Sarcas
tic, Mystic Maid.
"Pitcher Hughes of the Baltimores, who
shut us out without a hit once and let
us down with throe hits in another game,
is a good pitcherâ there is ru> doubt of
thatâ notwithstanding all reports to
the contrary,* s;url Manager Selee of
Bostons. "But I doubt very much whether
he is a man who can stand lots of work.
1 think that if he is pitched about one
game a week he will do good work, hut
he must not be pitched more than that.
That, of course, is only my opinion."
There are other people who agree with
me regarding the amount of work Hughes
is compelled to do. and as I said on other
occasions, if be does not go slow for a
while something is liable to happen.
To-day" s game promises to be the
"warmest that ever happened." The
rivalry that has sprung up between these
two teams over last Sunday's fourteen
inning game of nip and tuck may, it is
hinted, lead to all sorts of trouble. Both
clubs are confident of winning, yet an
ticipate strong opposition, and in view
of this fact will put forth their very best.
The line-up is as follows:
Oakland. Positions. Fresno.
Sullivan Catcher Mangcrina
Russell Pitcher Thomas
Sykes First base Held
O'Neil Second base Karley
Lang Third base Moore
Schmeer Short stop Courtney
Mosher Left field Ferguson
Hardle Center field McCue
Donovan Right field Button
A SERIES OF
TENNIS
TOURNAMENTS
The event of the day in tennis circles la
the lnterclub tournament which will be
held on the Alameda Tennis Club courts
on Monday, May 30. Three teams will be
entered by each of the bay clubs respec
tively, and a general tournament for
handsome prizes will inaugurate the sum
mer season of tennis. Much rivalry has
existed between the clubs, and as this la
the first time in some months that tho
flower of the racket wielders has been
brought together on the same court much
speculation has been indulged in by the
players who will participate. The Cali
fornia Tennis Club will be represented
by the following teams: Code and Brad
shaw, Adams and Welhe and probably
the Whitney brothers; Oakland Club by
Nicholson and Stone, Hardy and Hardy,
Pratt and Spencer; the Alameda Club by
Bowen and Holmes, Jones and Murdock
and Wheaton and Heliman.
Owing to the inclement weather the in
terclub Saturday matches have received
a serious setback. The matches between
the Oakland and Alameda and the San
Francisco and Alameda clubs have been
put down to the end of the schedule.
This afternoon the second meeting of tha
series between the teams of the Califor
nia and Oakland clubs will take place oÂ«
the California Club courts.
From morning until night at the Call*
fornia Tennis Club to-day match game*
will be strictly in order. The first num.
ber on the programme will be the ladier
singles tournament. The entries are nu
merous, and it is very likely that the
tournament will run over several days to
complete the matches. Then will come
the tournament games of the interclub
series. The final event on the card will
be a special match between Joe Daily
and George Whitney and Robert N. Whit
ney and George Bradshaw. Much inter
est is centered on the outcome of this
contest. In practice games the honors
have been pretty equally divided, and
each team is vociferatlve in claiming
prospective victory. **. dinner and copi
ous beakers of wine have been wagered
on the result. Daily and Whitney ara
selling slight favorites.
The junior girls played a singles tour
nament at the California courts during
the latter part of the werk. Miss Ruth
Foster and Miss Edith Chesebrough nut
in the first game of the tournament, the
former winning by a score of 6â3. Miss
Middleton succumbed to Miss Eleanor
Eckart with a score of Bâ 3. The
third match was between Miss Foster
and Miss Eckart, which remains unfin
ished, each having a set.
Letters have been written to George
Wright, an Eastern tennis enthusiast, in
regard to bringing out crack players of
the country for the Fourth of July tour
nament. If arrangements can be satis
factorily determined Wrenn, Lamed.
Sheldon and Ware will he seen on San
Rafael courts during the summer.
During the week the following matches
cf interest were played: Root beat Brad
shaw, 10 â 8, C â 4. 6â4.6 â 4. but the compliment
was returned by Bradshaw a few days
later, when he defeated Root. 6â2, 6â2,
7â5.7 â 5. George Whitney defeated Bradshaw,
6â3,6 â 3, 6â2.6 â 2. ftâ 6; Walter Mapee and Goorge
Whitney defeated Robert N. Whitney and
Bradshaw, G â 4, 7â5.
CRICKETERS ARE OFF
TO PLACER COUNTY.
On the schedule of the California
Cricket Association May 29 is 6et down
as an open date. The 6 o'clock train
from San Francisco this evening will take
an eleven of cricketers up to Loomls,
Placer County, to fulfill an engagement
with the Citrus Colony cricketers. The
team will be representative of the Ala
meda Cricket Club, though it will also
comprise two or three men who are not
members of that club. The team will
be made up as follows: R. B. Hogue,
J. J. Moriarity, G. I. Ball, J. B. Croll. C.
Banner, I. H. Spiro, A. Dickinson, H. C.
Casidy, J. H. Sanders, H. Ward and J. J.
R. Peel, or G. Hellman. A. Dickinson
and H. C. Casidy are members of the
Pacific Club. The eleven are certain to
meet with a hearty reception from the
Placer County men, and to have a good
time, whatever the result of the match
may be. The Citrus Colony has a strong
team and has rarely, if ever, been beaten
on its own ground. The visitors will re
turn to San Francisco on Monday r.tght,
being due in the city at 8:45.
On June 5 the second match of the Ala
meda Cricket Club vs. the Pacific Cricket
Club should be played. It is to be hoped
that nothing will prevent the latter club
from getting together a full team on that
day. Though It would have been more
generous for the Alameda team to hava
resumed on May 22 the match left un
finished on account of rain on May 15, the
Alameda captain was undoubtedly act
ing within his rights in claiming it as a
draw game. All that was' left for tha
Pacific men to do was to bear with such
equanimity as they were able to staml
the loss of an almost certain victory. If
the Pacific Club does not cheerfully ful
fill its future engagements cricket for 1898
will be at an end, and a serious, almost
an irreparable, injury will be done to the
game in California.

Amidst cries f>t "Call it off, " "That's
enough," and "You'll have a dead man
there In a minute" Police Captain Carson
stepped to the ropes and stopped the
flght between Hugh Dougherty of Chi
cago and Frank Schouler of the San Fran
cisco Athletic Club to-night in the eighth
round. The battle had been hot , and
swift. Dougherty was manifestly out of
condition and Schouler had made him a
chopping block in the last three rounds.
Dougherty was game, but life had a
Berious side for him at that moment, and
the coming of Captain Carson was not un
welcome. James Fox refereed the bout,
but all blows looked alike to him and he
was loudly criticized for overlooking
serious fouls made by Schouler.
Joe McDonald of the California Swim
ming Club and Ed "Willie of the Klondike
Club of Sacramento fought six bloody
rounds of swift fighting to a draw.
Al Emory of Australia and Emil Dahl

PREPARING FOR THE IRISH FAIR
me Committees Rapidly Completing Preparations for the
Big Benefit.
TARA CASTLE, ONE OF THE MANY FEATURES.
The coming- Irish fair promises to be a success. Old Mechanics' Pavilion
â¢will be "old" Ireland itself when the doors of the fair swing open, If the plans
of the various committees are carried out. Among the features will be a
picturesque reproduction of Tara Hall, one of the famous landmarks of Ire
land, and within its walls the guests of the Knights of Tara will make merry.
Th^ responses to the requests to serve on the honorary advisory board of the
fair are pouring in most favorably, and all doubts as to its success are now
removed. At the meeting of the executive committee yesterday, Jeremiah
Deasv presiding, favorable responses were read from these gentlemen: Hon.
James D Phelan, Hon. Irving M. Scott, Mr. R. P. Doolan, Hon. P. J. Harney,
Hon. Tirey L. Ford, William R. Sherwood, Hon. J. H. Filcher, Colonel E. A.
Denicke Joseph A. Stulz, Hon. Niles Searls, Richard V. Curtis, E. P. Mogan.
J H Seawell. J. J. Donovan, Frank Conklln, Dr. M. J. Fottrell, James H.
Barry William M Bunker, Frank J. Murasky, Andrea Sbarboro, John H.
GradV Major William B. Hooper, C. H Crocker, Hon. Robert Ferral, William
Greer Harrison, Hon. James Leggett, Hon. J. J. Dwyer, Hon. C. L. Barrington,
John H. Spohn. H. Mulvihill, and others.
At the regular weekly meeting of the executive committee of the Celtic
Union in room 9, Phelan" building, it was decided to have a "tile" booth and a
booth where relics and '98 patriotic souvenirs could be sold by the ladles, and
the proceeds devoted to fitting up a Volfe Tone and a Robert Emmet hall in
the proposed Irish Societies' Hall, for the erection of which this Irish fair is to
be held next August. -._...__, ,_
Letters from ocean steamship companies, offering to bring over the soil and
turf from the "ould counthry" free of cost, were read and accepted by the com
mittee The Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Kerry, Queenstown and other Irish cities'
papers both daily and weekly, will be sold in the Pavilion during the fair,
and as' the boys run around the hall crying out the familiar names of th<?sÂ©
publications, it will take many a visitor back to the days of yore. Messrs.
Seaman and Landis, the famous scenic artists of Chicago, whose beautiful
electric theater, known as "A Day In Ireland," was bo popular in the Chicago
Irish fair have offered to send it on here. It is now in Buffalo at the A. O. H.
Irish fair this week. It will be placed in the north end of the gallery and
will occupy a space about 50 by 10) leet.
It was decided to give a handsome prize to the Celtic Union organization
having the handsomest and most original designed booth ready on the evening
of August 20 (opening night) A prize equally as fine will be given to the so
ciety not a member of the union, for a similar purpose. One-half of the main
floor space was set aside for the Industrial exhibits of Ireland and California,
Messrs Murray, Conley, Davoust and Sizer were appointed solicitors on floor
space and to obtain advertising in a beautiful programme. Thursday nights
w-ere selected as regular meeting nights for the executive committee. Messrs.
Purcell & Sons of New York sent on some photographs of Irish and American
Bishops and clergy, and it was decided to have them, together with views of
Ireland and photographs of American and Irish patriots and of heroes of the
present war on sale. It was announced that four Irish societies had picked
out floor spaces for society booths. Â»nd that they would at once take up vie
matter of obtaining articles to sell therein.
The following ladies will soon meet and form the ladies' auxiliary commit
tee extending invitations to other ladies to join in the good work: Mrs. Mary
T Menton, Mrs. P. E. McCarthy. Mrs. F. B. Lorigan, Mrs. C. B. Flanagan,
Mrs H. Mulvihill, Mrs. J. J. Donovan, Mrs. C. S. Laumeisfer, Mrs. Mary A. Mur
phy of 129 Liberty street, Mrs. Nora Dwyer. Mrs. J. Deafly, Mrs. Frances G.
Ferral Mrs William B. Hooper, Mrs. L. W. Buckley and Mrs. E. P. Mogan.
TO AID THOSE
LEFT IN WANT
Citizens Will Relieve Sol
diers' Families.
A SOCIETY IS FORMED
IT WILL COLLECT FUNDS WITH
OUT DELAY.
Membership and Belief Dispensed
Will Be Limited to People
in San Fran
cisco.
At a meeting of representative citizens
at the Occidental Hotel dining rooms last
night the following committee was ap
pointed to see to a permanent local or
ganization for the purpose of rendering
aid to the families of soldiers who have
gone to Manila: Walter K. Dean. Tirey
L. Ford, Mrs. William Alvord, Mrs. Hor
ace Hill and Mrs. C. M. Kinney.
The meeting was called to order by
Major Hooper, who made an address in
which he called attention to the fact that
there was great need for such work as
that outlined by the Red Cross. He said
there would be a great deal of suffering
unless some definite aid should be ren
dered.
Judge Morrow was elected chairman of
the meeting, and it was then decided that
the society should be limited to San Fran
cisco wholly, the aid of certain Oakland
ladies being refused on the ground that
each city would be expected to take care
of its own sufferers.
Speeches on the subject were made by
Dr Stebbins, Rabbi Voorsanger, Tirey L.
Ford and others, after which the meet
ing adjourned to convene at the same
nlace again on next Monday night. Word
was received that more than $12,000 has
been collected at Honolulu for relief work,
and that the sum will probably be doubled
by the time the troops reach there.
It is the intention of the local society
to co-operate with the Red Cross, and
to do all the work within its power at
once There will be subscription lists
forthwith, and committees will solicit
funds without delay.

THE SAN FKAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 28, 1898.
THE BAY STATE HOTEL.
Splendidly Appointed and Justly-
Popular.
The Bay State Restaurant is not un
known tn the public of San Francisco,
but the Bay State Hotel is a new factor
in the restaurant life of the city, come
into existence as the result of a de
mand for increased facilities and great
er accommodations by reason of public
favor bestowed upon its proprietor, Mr.
Adler, who has long been known as one
of the leading caterers of San Francis
co. The half-dollar dinner furnished
by Mr. Adler has become famous and
is unequaled in quality and service in
many places for double the price. The
Bay State Restaurant has simply in
creased its facilities to meet the de
mand of a growing patronage. While
formerly occupying the ground floor of
the General Keys building, it now, un
der its new name, includes the entire
building, consisting of fcur spacious
stories and 110 rooms. These are divided
into suites for private dining and sup
per rooms, and are furnished in the
most handsome and comfortable man
ner. The furniture is of a rich pattern
and a piano is found in each suite, and
each has its private dining service. The
general effect gives an air of luxuriance
and good taste. An elevator conveys
the guests to each floor and the entire
house is lighted by electricity. There
are three entrances to the hotelâ one
at No. 109 O'Farrell street, a ladies' en
trance at Iso. 17 Stockton street and a
general entrance at No-. 15 Stockton
street.
The proprietor, Mr. Max Adler, has
given his especial personal supervision
to each detail of this extensive cara
vansary, scr that everything in connec
tion with its management is as nearly
perfect as a liberal expenditure and
good taste can produce.
One of the most particular adjuncts
of an establishment of this kind is the
chef. He has much to do with build
ing up and sustaining the reputation of
a hotel. Mr. Adler has secured the ser
vices of a perfect treasure in this line
to take charge of his cuisine. Every
rarity and delicacy to be found in the
market undergoes his personal inspec
tion and is prepared under his watch
ful eye. The epicure knows what a
g-ood meal is, but does not always know
just where to procure it. Mr.Adlerisnot
an experimenter with people's stomachs
or other comforts. He is a veteran and
understands his business. He only asks
one visit from those who are fond of
luxuries to secure a continuance of their
custom. And with all, the patrons of
the Bay State Hotel will be astonished
at the reasonableness of the charge.
It is the enjoyment in the highest de
gree of luxuries at the most reasonable
rates. â¢
Fomer Failed to Appear.
Dr. W. 11. Forner failed to answer to
his name In Judge Joachlmsen's court
yesterday morning. Representing him
were Attorneys Allen, Grady, Gallagher
and Terry, and they individually and col
lectively explained to the Judge that For
ner was sick in bed. The police had infor
mation that he was drinking, and, after
a continuance was granted till next
Wednesday, the Judpe issued a bench
warrant for his arrest. Sergeant Mofflt
went with the warrant to the doctor's
residence but could not find him. The doc
tor is charged with betrayal under prom
ise of marriage by Miss Victoria C. Mar
tin.

Contributions are still steadily pouring
Into the coffers of the Red Cross Society.
As the days pass and the people awake
to the realisation of the importance of
such an institution in the present war
crisis an increasing interest in the wel-
fare and furtherance of the society seems
to grow upon the public. The total re
ceipts up to date amount to $JtO,7ID "5, and
are. steadily increasing.
Fifty regulars from Illinois arrived at
9:15 o'clock yesterday morning, and after
being breakfasted in the new depot at the
foot of Market street, were decorated with

Incoming and outgoing troops. In sending
coffee and lunches to the famibhed Ore
ton boys the expressman Invited the ladies
to ride down in his vehicle. One coura
geous society matron immediately accept
ed the Invitation, her example being fol

In this way with every wagon-load of pro

The ladles of Royal Rebekah Lodge of
the Independent Order of Odd Fellows^
who for severul days past have been
working on the lines of the Red Cross
bociety, yesterday afternoon obtained
permission from the colonel of the Idaho
regiment to erect a tent on the regimental
grounds, from which point they will be
enabled to continue the good "work in
which they are engaged. Tfie Odd Fellows
Becured a tent for them, and it was put
up lato in the afternoon. It is distinguish
able from the others by having the three
links, representing Friendship, Love and
Truth, placed over the entrance.
At 16 Post street the work of making
bandages is going on bravely. An army
of workers yesterday made short work of
the material provided. Ten thousand
more bandages are asked for. Flannel
and broad white tape are always in de
mand.
The French Hospital, through its vice
president, extended valuable aid to the
society in the hospital work at the Bay
District camp. A ward in the hospital
has been placed at the disposal of the
society for the sick, and countless other
favors have been accorded, for wmcu Hie
ladies are very gTateful.
The patriotic employes of the San Fran
cisco Postoffice have set fui example
worthy of imitation by other organiza
tions. They met in Judge Morrow's court
room last Thursday evening and proceed
ed to organize a Red Cross society. A. M.
Cox, superintendent of the city delivery,
was chosen as president; J. R. Rlnes, the
oldest carrier in the service, was elected
vice-president, D. S. Richardson secre
tary and E. A. O'Connor treasurer.
After many patriotic speeches, it was
unanimously resolved to contribute in the
neighborhood of *Â«W per montn to the
Red Cross cause as long as the war with
Spain shall last. This money will be de
ducted from the salaries of the employes
each month and forwarded to the Red
Cross headquarters.

The following was received from the

GROWLS THAT FOLLOW
THE BENCH SHOW.
The show is over, but not the work of
the bench show committee. The secre
tary has a particularly fine and large
Job on handâ he Is at present busy mak
ing out the checks wherewith to pay the
prizes. The accounts have not yet been
balanced, but from present appearances
It Is a moot question whether the San
Francisco Kennel Club will not have to
face a deficit. The rain on the closing
night played havoc with the receipts and
rendered all calculations nugatory. The
best that can be hoped for is a surplus
of a couple of hundred dollars, and that,
if it be proved to exist, will go to the
Children's Hospital.
The Judge of the show, Mr. George E.
Bell, has signed a contract for five years
with Emmett Sullivan of Menlo Park to
undertake the charge of the latter's ken
nels. There can be no doubt that Mr.
Sullivan has dune a very clever stroke
of business, for Mr. Bell's long kennel ex
perience should render his services In
valuable to his employer.
Mr. Bell has engaged Frank Robbins
to act as his secretary and assistant gen
erally.
Mr. Christenson's protest against the
winning of the bull terrier, Rastus, is lla
able to prove futile, as far as the San
Francisco Kennel Club is concerned.
Mr. Taits, under whose name Rastus
was entered, is able to show a clean bill
of sale for the dog, bearing date of April
20, and this settles the protest, as far as
the San Francisco Kennel Club is con
cerned. Any further contest must be
laid before the American Kennel Club for
decision.
The facts of the case, as developed
since the filing of the protest, show that
the arrangement for the loan of Mr.
Christenson's stud dog, Imp. Woodcote
Venom, to Mr. Foley, was made by Mr.
O'Brien of the Palace Hotel, and that
the pup agreed on, as the price of the
stud dog's service, was duly delivered to
Mr. O'Brien. This seems to remove all
doubt as to the legality of Rastu*'
awards, but Mr. E. S. Heller, Mr. Chris
tenson's adviser, is a stubborn fighter,
and it is beyond peradventure that he will
carry the matter for decision to the su
preme tribunal of the American Kennel
Club.
Mr. Heller's own bitch. Torpedo, has
been disqualified for deafness. By this
disqualification Mr. Folger's Fly takes the
first prize in open bull terrier bitches, and
Mr. Clinton E. Worden's Lady Jane the
second prize. It is due to Mr. Heller
to state that he advised the kennel club
of the bitch's deafness when he made
the entry. Not the slightest reflection
can therefore be cast on him.

country was $13,000,000, while last year thpr*
was an increase of more than 20 per cent, the

ber. In 1896 the value was about t3ii.ooo.nno,
and for several yearv previous to that year
the value was about the same. In 1860 it was
'$10,000,000.
EXPLANATION.
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure Is high in the Interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and couth along the coast, rain Is probable;
but v.-hen the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
lilaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In Eummer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
oi,j.Â«.site result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 27.â The stock market en-
Joyed a period of strength this morning. but
the early gains were practically all wiped out
before the day ended except in a few special
stocks which had sustained the list . all -day.
Even some of those closed at prices as low or
lower than last night's closing. The late
weakness was all the more remarkable on ac
count of the sustaining force exerted by the
buoyancy of People's Gas. This stock made a
remarkable display of strength and absorbed
a large proportion of the day's total dealings.
The extreme rise, almost 3 points, was effected
In the face of pronounced heaviness of thÂ»
general market, which was dropping under a
persistent dribble In realizing sales. The ad
vance In People's Gas was due to the very
confident buying on the interests on the Inside.
It may have been directed against short In
terests, which has been put out In the last
few days on the strength of the threatened liti
gation against the combination of companies.
After the stock touched par very heavy blocks
were .taken and there were prolonged periods
when it was practically the only stock appear
ing on the tape. Its net gain is nearly 2%
'points. Rock Island was advanced almost 2
points in the early trading. . but saved only a
little over a point of its net gain." The Grang
ers as a group shared in this early strength
and there was good buying also in the Van
derbllts. London was a buyer of the inter
national stocks in this market and there were
conspicuous gains, in the case of - several Iso
lated stocks. Later weakness In the : market
was undoubtedly due to : a growing doubt as
to the whereabouts of, the Spanish fleet.
There was some awakened activity nt times
In the bond market and prices were well held
throughout. Sales $2,675. (M). -
United States .old ,4s registered were ' %
'higher, and do coupon, 1 per cent lower and
the new- 4s coupon Vi lower, bid price.
Others unchanged.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 27.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were quiet to-day on the coming
holidays, but were firm and hopeful. Barring
the uncertainties of politics, the outlook Is
healthier and more hopeful than it has been
for some time past. The India Government
offered to-day Â£f.. 000.000 In treasury bills. These
were all allotted in twelve months' bills at 2.iÂ»
per cent, and I learn privately that Japan was
the buyer. This probably means a further re
lease of Japanese money goon. Argentines were
strong, as also Brazils, the latter on the debt
reorganization scheme.
Americans and Grand Trunks were good, clos
ing quiet at the best.
There is a revival in the Continental demand
for gold, the price of which Is now 77s S^d.

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, May 27.â Bradstreefs Financial
Review to-morrow will say: Irregularity in
the movement of prices this week has been at
tended by considerable bullish sentiment and
activity. The war continues to be the prin
cipal speculative factor and In a large degree
restricts the market by rendering the outside
public unwilling to take part In it until there
i are further and even decisively favorable de-
I velopments. This has left matters entirely in
professional hands, although the rank and file
of the Wall-street traders are at present bull
ish In their Ideas and disposition. Both the
regular professionals and the large financial
Interests closelj- connected with corporations
are disposed to pay more attention to the crops,
the prospects of another year of large railroad
tonnage and earnings and to the generally
favorable outlook than to the war situation.
The principal movements In prices this weekâ
the advances In t):Â»> Grander stocks and the
local traction securitiesâ were the result of in
fluences "entirely outside of war developments.
In the fir?t-named cape the incrense In the
Hock Island dividend and the probability of an
extra one was the moving factor in prices,
and In the latter Instance rumors of a connec
tion between the Metropolitan and the Third
avenue Companies were sufficient to materially
advance both stocks. Other parts of the list
also moved in obedience to circumstances or
developments hnvlng a particular bearing on
their values. It should be noted that this
week London has changed its position and
has bought our stocks Instead of selling them.
Its change of attitude is due partly to the de
cline of the money market there and to an
easier feeling about the relations between Eng
land and the continental rowers. The ad
vance of exchanr* rat^s h<-re seems natural
and attracted little attention on the stock
market, while the very easy rates for money
are an encouragement for holders of stocks,
and tend to emphasize the firmness with which
the market resists bearish pressure or falls
to respond to unfavorable reports.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, May 27.â The only buytng reason
at the start In the wheat pit was the expecta
tion that yesterday's sellers would be buyers
to cover shorts, but that expectation was re
alized only to a moderate extent. May and
July received from Letter brokers all the sup

September at from S6c to 86M;C.. appear to have
got all they wanted k- 12 o'clock, and the price
I began to yield for lack of buying. There was
' a vigorous trade lasting for about fifteen min
utes during which the price of September went
I down to 850. May at the same time dropped to
I $1 70, and July from fl 10 down to $1 07. The
I market touched bottom near the end of the
1 session, but reacted some before the close.
' July loot 3>-,<fr4o. and September mi@l%c. May
ranged between $1 70 and $1 76, the latter be
ing the final figure.
A large buslnes was done In the corn pit to
day. It was strong early, hut finally broke
with wheat. July closed lower.
In oats there was quite a good deal of chang
ing from July to September at a premium of
2%c for July. July olosed lÂ«c lower.
The dropping price of corn . and the Improv
ing prospects of a good crop of that cereal had
a tendency to weaken provisions. The de

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, May 27.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
The nation faces war with a reviving volume
of business. The West Is doing its part and
more, but at the East also the volume of busi
ness Is now expanding. Without abatement In
any important line, the great outgo of wheat
ai.d corn continues to stimulate business at the
West, and railroad earnings show an increase
over last year of 15.1 per cent In trunk lines,
8.8 per cent In granger roads and In the other
Western roads 14.6 per cent, while east-bound
shipments from Chicago In three weeks have
been 3SS.9OS tons, against 150,b12 last year and
1G4,1i23 tons in ISS>2.
This is largely because of the enormous
movement or hreail.stuffs. Atlantic exports ol
wheat. Hour included, have been 3,72H,442 bush
els for the week, against 1,536,607 bushels last
year, though Pacific exports were only 92,184
bushels, against 314,955 bushels last year.
Wheat receipts at the West do not diminish,
but run far beyond those a year agoâ for the
week, 4,625,253 bushels, against 2,0%,173 bushels
last year. In four weeks exports fr-im botn
coasts have been 13.691,874 bushels, against
6,704.334 last year. The marvelous feature Is
the enormous buying of corn, exports having
reached 5,550,955 bushels for the week, against
1.554.511 bushels last year, and in four weeks
the exports have been 20,255,057 bushels, against
it 3fiO,OiU last year. Yet corn closed 3.37 cents
lower for the week, although wheat flour, ris
ing from $1 56 to $1 66 for May, fell to *1 40 on
Friday while July options fell I<4 cents, ofli
clal and all other accounts agree In estimating
that the wheat yield will be remarkably large
this year in spite of the fact that the California
crop has been much damaged for want of ruin.
Starting this month with the gr.;u.tcst con
sumption ever known, the iron Industry has
made surprising progress In new orders, which
reached about 100.000 tons in bars alone, over
EO.OOO having been placed at Chicago and 15.000
at Wheeling, mainly resulting in the extraor
dinary demand for agricultural implements.
Heavy contracts for structural work amount
during the week to at least 15.000 tons, with
others reported at many Western cities. Plate
contracts, outside of the heavy demand for the
Government, are very large and Include st*n)
tons for ship yards In Glasgow and Belfast.
Many structural and bridge contracts at the
West are pending, with probability of large
orders during the coming week. A better de
mand appears for textile goods, with a slight
advance In print cloths and a substantial gain
In sales of staples.
Wool sales during: the week have been only
3.748,100 pounds, of which 2,459,100 were domes
tic, against 6,842,400 pounds a year ago and
4.221,000 pounds in the same week of 1892. The
manufacturers ' are largely supplied ' with ma
terial, although some who have heavy Govern
ment contracts are obliged' to buy different
grades of wool than those they have in hand.
Activity In the market is prevented by the tact
i that the Western holders almost universally be
! lieve in higher prices than can be yet realized
j In Eastern markets, so that purchasing 13 very
light.
The silk mills are all busy and the coming
] linen manufacture is making a g^od record for
Itself. â 
-Failures for -the week have b'cr. 245 in the
United States, against 214 last year, and 21 in
Canada, against 22 . last year.

BRADSTREETS FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, May 27. â Hradstreet's will say
to-morrow: A total volume of business fully
proportioned to or In excess of that usually
noted at this season of the year Is indicated
by reports to Brndstreefs this week. The ex
ceptions are generally where weuther condi
tions have made for irretrularlty and per
haps dullness. In most sections of the coun
try the situation generally remains satisfac
tory. The volume of bank clearings, as was
to be expected, shows the contraction us-ual to
ward the close of the month of May, but with
few exceptions the crop situation, the volume
of railway earnings and the reports from a
number or leaaii.g industries point to a maxi
mum volume ol business doing In most parts
of the country. Relatively the best trade re
ports continue, as for some time pant, to come
iroin the Centra] West and Nortnwest, where
the outlook, both as regards crop yield and
prices, continues eminently satisfactory to
agricultural interests. The wheat situation
shows little change in the week, but thuse and
next years delivery appear to have parted
company, as shown by the increased stringency
Of prices vi wheat for immediate use, pointing
to unimpaired strength in the near statistical
position, while, on the other hand, the large
yield foreshadowed tends to easiness in prices
for next years crop deliveries. The price of
corn reflects less anxiety about the crop, in
duced by the return of weather favorable to
planting and growth. Weather conditions do
n<t altogether favor the cotton crop, dry
weather being complained of throughout most
of the Southern and Gulf States. Reports from
the Iron and steel Industries are of very large
business being done by the mills and furnaces.
The demand (or merchant Iron and bars la re
ported very food, the latter particularly being
a reflection ot free buying by manufacturers
of agricultural implements, who report heavy
orders, based upon flattering cereal crop pros
pects. The market for plgiron is rathf-r more
quiet and prices at leading centers show gome
shading, confidence In a future large business,
however, being as yet unimpaired. Signs ac
cumulate that the long-looked- for Improvement
in the wool trade is nearer realization, rather
more business being reported at most Eastern
markets. This, in part. Is a result of good
buying against contracts for Government work
and partly also an outcome of the tlrn.er tone
and sllshtly increased activity at Western
market:-, where prices are reported firmer.
Cereal exerts still continue unpre< edently
heavy, wheat shipments for the week aggre
gating 4,809,133 bushels, against 4,064.000 bushels
last v.-eek. 2,081,000 bushels this week a year

J. W. Harrison's circular says: "During the ;
â week there have been five arrivals from British |
Columbia with 15.539 tons of coal; two from
Washington, 3691 tons; one from Oregon, 475 |
tons; total. 22.705 tons. The sale this week to <
the Government and to the transport steamers
has caused a stiffening of values, as our stocks I
In yard have become materially reduced, and it â 
is known that the department is now in treaty |
for several more steamers, all of which will be j
coaled here â¢in the near future. The with- j
drawal^ these steamers from the coal carry- i
ing- trade will assuredly advance coast coal
freights, and the sales for future delivery to-
Honolulu and Alaska already contracted by the
British Columbia colliers preclude their taking
any orders for at least sixty days. In addition
to these, we are uncerta-in what quantity and
when the Government may call for more, hence !
the holders of all foreign cargoes to arrive are i
unwilling sellers, unless at very full figures.
Most of our large consumers are fairly well |
provided for In the meantime. Later on they j
may find fuel a little more expensive. This |
year coal Is king emphatically, Its utility is
superseded by Its necessity, its value for the
sustenance almost of nations is being estab
lished at the present moment, showing the ab
solute necessity of their having national coal i
* stations not too far apart, well stocked. The j
British Government has shown Its usual fore
sight in this regard, being well provided with j
same, comparatively contiguous to each other."

THE QUEEN OF FLOWERS.
Of all blossoms the rose has received
the most honor and adoration. He
brew poets sung of the rose; St. Jerome
says the word Naazreth means a flower
and the rose is typical of the Virgin
Mary. St. Basil wrote that in the sin
less ages roses had stems without
thorns, but when men became sinful
the flower put forth thorns to guard
her from their touch.
Dante in his "Divine Comedy" Im
mortalizes the rose and some critics
say he received his idea from a book
of the Brahma ns, according to which a
silver rose is made the representation
of God's presence. One tradition de
clares Buddha was crucified because he
plucked a rose.
A Greek legend is to the effect that
the rose grew from the blood the
wounded Adonis shed, while the tears
of Venus formed the anemones. In
alchemy the rose was one of the chief
signs, being the symbol of light. One
possible origin of the connection of the
rose with alchemy is found in Hero
dotus, who pays that Midas, the Phry
gian King, had a garden of roses and
each rose had sixty petals. The rose
! was sacred to Bacchus and it was
; Bacchus who gave to Midas ihe secret
of transmutation of metal ;.
Religion and poetry have united to
make the Persian stories the most ex
quisite of all that owe their origin to
the rose. The Persians have a feast
of roses, beginning when the buds first
open and continuing throughout the
season. The Bulbul Nameh lauds the
rose as God's own flo .-er, and adds that
j he has set the nightingale to keep ward
over it. Whensoever a rose is plucked j
the bird gives forth a cry, the sweetest i
and the saddest cry that mounts to
heaven. In the springtime the night
ingale hovers over the fragrant petals
until it swoons in a perfumed ecstasy.
Nor is the flower less faithful than the
bird, for it does not bloom until the
nightingale sings to the bud. Then at
the marvelous strains the flower un
folds Its glories to the waiting air.

Attempting to Find Out Who Sent
the Bogus Subpena That Caused
Mrs. Struber to Leave
Her Home.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, May 27.
Joseph Taylor was taken to the County
Jail to-day charged with a serious crime.
It is alleged that some months ago he
abducted a young wife from Oakland for
the purpose of placing her amid disrep
utable associates.
Two months ago Mrs. Lemery Struber,
Â«. girl about 17 years of age, was taken
by her husband to a lodging house not
fitted for her as a dwelling. For this
offense Struber was convicted of a felony,
and Is now spending three years In San
Quentin. Not long after the trial the
young wife's mother notified the police
that her daughter had disappeared, and
Inquiry showed that a false subpena to
appear at an imaginary trial in Judge
Cliffs court had been served upon her.
end ihat advantage had been taken of her
leaving home to attend the court to ab
duct her. It was proved that there was
no authority for issuing the subpena, and
no case in which the girl was wanted
as a witness.
Joseph Taylor, who was suspected of
being a party to the abduction, was at
that time living at Fruitvale. working as
a broommaker. The young wife's brother
swore out a warrant for the arrest of
Taylor, charging him with abducting his
elster for immoral purposes. As soon as
the warrant was issued, Taylor disap
peared, and he has not been seen until
a couple of days ago. He then felt it
cafe to return, but only reached Oakland
In time to be arrested. He was unable
to account for his sudden flight, which
Is Indicated as bearing out. in some meas
ure, the suspicion of his guilt.
After Taylor's disappearance, the girl
was found in San Francisco and brought
home, and it is presumed that she has
confided in her brother, the prosecuting
â witness, who is responsible for her ab
duction. Taylor is held in $2000 bonds,
â which he has not been able to give, and
his preliminary examination will be held
before Justice Clift next Tuesday after
noon.
MYSTERIOUS DEATH
AT PIEDMONT BATHS
A MAN BaDLY SCALDED IS
FOUND ON THE SLAB.
Jahnigan'g Stomach to Be Analyzed,
as There Is a Possibility
That Hs Swallowed
Some Poison.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. May 27.
Gustave Jahnigan, a bartender, died at
the Piedmont baths early this morning
under peculiar circumstances. He was
resting on a marble slab after taking a
Hammam Â by
an attendant. For a few days Jahnigan
has been absent from his work.
After leaving the hot room at the baths,
James Gouterman proposed to rub Jahni
gan down, but the latter said he preferred
to rest on the slab and would call the
attendant when h>' needed him. As no
call came, Gouterman went to Jahnigan,
and found him dead. The body was re
moved to the Morgue.
Jahnigan was 4S years of age, and
leaves a widow and five children. He was
a popular member of the A. O. U. %V.
One of his sons recently enlisted, and is
now waiting for a cail to the front.
Alter tiic bouy \sas reuiovcu to the ,
Morgue Coroner Baldwin was greatly
surprised to find that the skin was
burned so severely that it would peel off. ,
No autopsy was held, but the organs
were found in a healthy condition and
there was nothing to indicate the cause
of death.
"1 intended to hold an autopsy to- i
night," said Coroner Baldwin, '"but after
closely examining: the body I decided that
it is scarce calling for a thorough exam
lnatlon. There is no organic disease that
may have caused death, so I suppose it
was caused either by the great heat of
the bath which has burned the body so
badly, or else the man must have taken <
?oison. I have sent the stomach to Pro-
Meor Colly at lite State University for
analysis, and have set the Inquest for
next Tuesday r.ight."

WILLOWS FROM ASIA MINOR.
Successful Experiments With Phe
nomenally Fast - Growing
Salixes at Chico.
BERKELEY, May 27.â At the Chico
forestry station of the agricultural de
partment of the State University the suc
cessful experiment has been made of in
troducing a new species of rapid-growing
willow from Asia Minor. Six-inch cut
tings of the new treeâ the Salix salmonei
â at the end of thirty-one months (ten
months in the nursery and the remaining
twenty-one months in a grove) reached
the height of 32 feet. The circumference
of the tree was 22 inches and the spread
of its branches 12 feet The wonderful
quickness of this growth is realized when
compared with that of the common bas
ket willow, which in the same period
reached a height of 7Vs feet, with a girth
of 5 inches and a spread of 5 feet. "Some
day," declares Inspector Charles H. Shinn
of the experiment stations, "for fuel, for
fence posts, for charcoal and for manu
facturing purposes, the new species of
salix which we have succeeded in intro
ducing will become of great commercial
importance."
Experiments with eucalypti and acacias
at the Chico station have not met with
such success. Even large trees of the
blue gum variety were killed by the frost,
and the only hardy varieties of the eu
calyptus which seemed able to endure
were the vimlnalls, the genokles, the
alpina and the Gunnel. Although gums
of all varieties grow well in Southern
California and around the bay. Inspector
Shinn has come to the conclusion that
they are more adapted to the low-lying
valley of the Sacramento. "The growth
of forest trees, however, proves that the
Chico district is as well adapted as any
in the State to a great range of deciduous
and coniferous trees, and particularly the
oaks and ashes and other hardwood
trees."

SUDDEN DEATH IN BERKELEY.
The Body of a Professional Woman
Nurse Found in the Cali
fornia Hotel.
BERKELEY, May 27.â Mrs. Mary Chat
field, a professional nurse, aged about 50
years, was found dead this morning in a
room of the California Hotel on the cor
ner of Shattuck and University avenues.
Certain peculiar circumstances surround
the death, which, however, was in all
probability due to alcoholism. Yesterday
afternoon the woman was brought, to the
hotel in a hack, while evidently under
the influence of liquor. She threw herself
upon the bed, where she lay groaning,
disregarding the chambermaid's sugges
tion that she disrobe and retire. Little
attention was paid to her groans, as it
was supposed that her conduct was due
to drinking. This morning the groans had
ceased, and when the room was entered
the woman was found to be dead. The
body was removed to the Berkeley
Branch Morgue, where an inquest will be
held.
The dead woman for some months past
has been employed as a nurse by Mrs.
Kimball Easton of Jefferson and Eleventh
streets, Oakland.
For the past week she had been
partially intoxicated, and yesterday Mr.
Easton discharged her and sent her to
the California Hotel in Berkeley, where
she had stopped on previous occasions.
After she had left it was found she had
consumed nearly a pint and a half of
wood alcohol, only a very small dose of
which is necessary to produce death.
Nothing was found about the person of
the dead woman that would tend to in
dicate suicide. Of her antecedents or
associates almost nothing is known.
Frightened Into Jumping.
BERKELEY, May 27.â Andrew Hansen,
the 8-year-old son of A. Hansen of 2417
Fifth street. West Berkeley, broke his leg
yesterday in jumping from a high fence
near the bay shore. The lad was playing
with some companions on the fence, when
some older girls threatened to give him a
whipping. The little fellow, fearing that
they would carry out their threat,
jumped to the ground, receiving a serious
fracture of the legbone.
Berkeley News Notes.

Recruiting for Company G.
ALAMEDA, May 27.â Captain Simpson
of Company G will open a recruiting of
fice in Haywards for the purpose of ob
taining volunteers to fill up the ranks of
Company Gof this city. Although there
is a population of 16,000 people in this city
for some reason the young men appear
loth to offer their services to their coun
try, and hence it seems necessary to go
outside of the town to raise the number
of men required. The company had the
full number just after the first call for
troops, but many of the volunteers on
finding that it was not going at once, en
listed with other commands. Hence the

ALAMEDA, May 27.â The City Trustees
will hold a special meeting to-night to
discuss the proposed franchise to the
Southern Pacific for a crossing on Web
ster street near the end of the estuary
bridge. Inasmuch as it will be necessary
to make quite a grade at that point, is
has been suggested that the street be
lowered a little and a bridge put in for the
steam milroad, allowing the electric line
and other traffic to go underneath. Other
wise the crossing will be a very dangerous
one and an obstacle to traffic in that di
rection.
Decoration Day.
ALAMEDA. May 27.â There will be no
celebration of Decoration day in this city
on Monday next. A squad of ten men has
been detailed from Company G to go to
the cemeteries in Oakland and do the
honors over the graves of two former
rr.-mbcrs of the organization, but beyond
this there will be no ceremonies or other
observance. _

Interesting Exercises at MacdonougJbi
Theater â His Grace Archbishop
Biordan Presents the
Diplomas.
Oakland Office San Francisco Cajl,
90S Broadway, May 27.
The Macdonough Theater was crowded
' to-night with the friends of the gradu
ates of St. Mary's College. Archbishop
Rlordan presided ajid presented the di
plomas to the graduating class, consist-
Ing of Thomas H. Donovan, Leo P. Tor
mey, James J. ODea, W. P. Sullivan, An
drew P. Finan, Edward T. Mallon. Frank
I A. Silva and John A. Young. â¢
The class essays were on Interesting j
' topics and showed much study and ;
thought on the part of the orators. W. P.
Sullivan dealt with 'â¢The American Re
public," and in his remarks said: "The j
unity and liberty of our republic must be |
preserved in order that we may attain to j
the elevation that Providence has dcs- ;
tlned for us. Wo must be ever mindful .
of our motto, 'E plurlbus unum,' for In '
'unity there is strength." We must ever I
keep in mind the grand idea of true lib
erty which it has been given our nation
to realize and ever strive to reach a po
sition that the God of nations intended
we should occupy â the peer among the
nations of the earth."
"Who Fears to Speak of '98?" was the !
subject handled by Andrew P. Finan, who j
said in brief: "Far from being ashamed '
of that eventful period of Irish history I
known as the insurrection of '98, we find ;
much in it to commend and admire. The
history of Ireland has been a checkered
one foV centuries. Still the shadows have â 
been brightened from time to time by the
light of faith and hope. Most other coun- !
tries have had seasons of prosperity and i
progress. But Ireland, rrora the landing !
of Strongbow, has had no such experi- ;
ence. For more than seven hundred i
years this devoted island, appropriately
termed 'first flower of the earth and first ',
gem of the sea,' has been the scene of
cruel persecutions and atrocious misrule, i
In consequence rebellions have been of \
frequent occurrence, though mostly un
successful, but hope has never died out
In the Irish heart."
Leo F. Tormey, in a clever thesis, re
ferred to the Monroe doctrine and said: ,
"Our republic has reached a point in its [
development where fear of European ag- j
gression may be disregarded Away,
therefore, with the purpose of those who i
would carry us back to the conditions j
from which we broke in the glorious i
days of the Revolution. Base is the ill !
disguised purpose of those who would |
Europeanize America. t"p with the glo- '
rious flag of independence. Long may it
wave over us ana our posterity, symbol
izing on its genial folds no base or de
grading foreign policies, but, untainted
and unpolluted, let it be transmitted to
posterity, upheld by principles American
in their origin, their nature and promul
gation."
"Pope Leo XIII and His Pontificate."
was the subject chosen by Thomas W.
Donovan. He said:
"Fired by the holy and ardent desire j
of drawing the human race nearer to
their Creator and aided by his remark
able abilities as a statesman, Leo XIII
has performed prodigies in the cause of
religion. He re-pstablished the Scottish !
hierarchy, secured the pardon and return i
of the Polish Bishops who had been ex
i!sd from their flocks, and secured for
German Catholic* the right to practice
their religion in peace.
"Of a remarkable personality, he at- 1
tracts with a magnetic force which is '
almost irresistible. His manner, though
kind, is firm and adamant and he displays ;
a remarkable force of character in all !
his undertakings; the ardor with which j
he performs every duty is infused into
those who come in contact with him, and
although he has reached the grand old ;
age of 88 years he continues to perform
the duties of his high office with an en
ergy little short of supernatural."
"The American Navy, Past and Pres
ent," is a timely subject upon which j
James I. O'Dt-a found much to say. He !
compared the navies of ISI2 and 1898 and
dosed as follows:
"And now we are In the midst of a
conflict with a European nation untried
before. We have taken up the gage of
battle in behalf of a starving, perishing
islandâ an upward striving nationality.
t*owever opinions may differ as to the
justness of the motives, Congress has de
clared for war; and if present omens au
gur anything of the future, the United
States will achieve one of her greatest
naval triumphs. Already the skies are
brightening with the prospects of dawn
ing victory and peace. The mantle of
the old commodore has fallen on one gas
lant man, the hero of Manila. The echoej
of Dewey's cannon have gone reverber
ating around the whole world, astounding
the nations at American pluck, ability
and triumph.
"Our destiny, In a great measure, is in
the hands of our seamen and we feei
confident that it is in good keeping. The
history of the American sailor makes
us trust that wherever national interests
may place him, they will be bravely, he
roically and triumphnntly safeguarded."
John A. Young presented an elaborate
review of the pioneers of missionary work
in America. He paid particular atten
tion to the work of those pioneers of re
ligion who laid the foundation of civil
ization in the Spanish territory that is
now the State of California.
Frank A. Silva dealt with the life and
work of General Rosecrans, who recently
died in Southern California. He referred
to the Christian character of the dead
warrior and of how religion dominated
his action both in war and in peace.
In dealing with public opinion Edward
Thomas Mallon said some very trenchant
things. He stated that much that is ac
cepted as public opinion does not deserve
the name, but is the worst form of dem
agogy. He also said that an able editor
can mold public opinion to a great ex
tent and thnt such opinion possesses
power enough to even compel vice to
hide its head, or if it persist in living it
shall only do so under the mask of
hypocrisy. ______________

CHRISINGER
VERY ALIVE
One of the Nail Case
Witnesses Irate.
HE WAS POSTET AS DEAD
THINKS THE ANNOUNCEMENT
WAS MALICIOUS.
In the Meantime Other Parties to the
Church Scandal Are Scouring
Around for a Beason of
the Humor.
Oakland Office Saij Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 27.
A little notice stating that P. B. Chris
inger, a resident of North Oakland, had
died, was sent to the newspapers last
night.
The notice was as follows: "Died, P. C.
ChriÃiuger, Wednesday evening, while at
tending a meeting of the Thirty-fourth
Street Methodist Episcopal Church; be
waa called upon to give testimony and
waa stricken down and died suddenly.
Cause, heart trouble. Arrangements for
the funeral will be announced later."
P. B. Chrisinger was one of the parties
who signed the formal complaint against
George Nail, superintendent of the church
Sunday-school, which resulted in the re
cent sensational trial. At this trial one
of the most interested witnesses was
Erasmus T. Leavell, an elderly man who,
it is said, is responsible for the notices of
Chrisinger's death. An investigation
showed that the death notice is entirely
false. There was no meeting of the
church Wednesday evening, and Mr.
Chrisinger is at present alive and enjoy
ing excellent health. He declares that the
circulation of the death notice is a plot !
to bring him into an unpleasant compli- ]
cation.
"Do I look like a dead man?" asked Mr. i
Chrisinger to-day. "I certainly don't feel
like a corpse, nor can I understand what i
under the sun could set people to circu
lating such a story. I was at the prayer
meeting Wednesday night, but no one
dropped dead. I would like to know what j
Mr. Leavell means. 1 suppose they are
still trying to draw me into the church
trouble. I was class leader there for two I
years, and while this cnurch trial was in !
progress they were trying to drag me into j
it. One women said I had made the as- j
sertion that there was not adecent woman <
in the congregation. When she was called
before the church committee to repeat it
she said it was some other man that
made the assertion. It happened that
there were two ladies present when she
said I had made the statement, and they
were ready to testify I had said nothing
of the kind.
"Now, I suppose, somebody wants to
prejudice me in the church. 1 was a wit
ness at the recent trial and told just what i
I knew and no more. The matter now |
rests with the committee, and nobody i
knows what the decision will be."
In the meantime the other members in
volved in the church scandal are trying
to discover a reason for the circulation of i
the report of Chrisinger's death. The bit
ter feeling engendered since Jhe filing of
the complaint is growing rather than de- |
creasing, and itis not beyond the bounds of ;
possibility that the unpleasant affair may j
yet have a tragic ending.

The Police Are Notified, and Every
Effort Is Being Made to Ap
prehend the Desperate
Men.
The police are investigating an unusual
ly bold robbery which occurred in the
Chinese quarter last Thursday morning.
The victim is Ting Sing, who conducts a
general merchandise store at 1020 Stock
ton street. According to his story, he was
seated behind the counter of his store,
when two of his fellow-countrymen en
tered. They claimed that they had ar
rived from Stockton and were anxious to
buy some provisions. While they were
enumerating a list of articles they de
:â !..: live other Chinese appeared. Rec
ognizing them as highbinders, the pro
prietor started to walk into a little room
in the rear of the store, when he was
attacked by one of the first visitors, who
struck him over the head with an iron
bar, cutting a deep gash.
me wounded ChmÂ«.*>e smarted to shout
for help, when two of the highbinders
drew their revolvers, and, placing them
in dangerous prnximity to his head,
threatened to blow his brains out if he
persisted in making an outcry.
Realizing that they would not hesitate
to carry out their threat he agreed to re
main qiiiet while they searched the store
for valuables. In a tin box which was
under the counter was $70 in gold and sev
eral articles of jewelry. After searching
for some time the leader of the gang
found the box and compelled the helpless
proprietor to open it. He then took the
money, and. followed by his companion
in crime, left the place, after threaten
ing to return and set lire to the store.
After satisfying himself that the de
spoilers had gone the wounded Chinese
visited the office of a doctor, where the
cut in his head was stitched. Yesterday
he appeared before Judge Low and swore
out warrants for the arrest of his as
sailants. As they are known the police
confidently expect to arrest them.
MRS. DR. LAPHAME IN
ANOTHER SCRAPE
MISS EFFIE MORRISON KILLED
BY MALPRACTICE.
Dr. Popper Mixed Up in the Case.
Railroad Company Exonerated
From Blame for the Death
of William C. Antissll.
In the case of Miss Effle Morrison,
killed by a criminal operation, which was
before the Coroner yesterday, the Jury
brought in a free and easy verdict to the
effect that the deceased had come to her
death from a criminal operation performed
by a party or parties unknown.
Mrs. Dr. Goodwin, alias Lnphnme, who
has been mixed up in similar cases, testi
fied that wl i she was called upon to at
tend the deceased there were evidences
that some other doctor had violated the
law and endangered the life of the de
ceased. Dr. V. Popper of Kearny street
had attended the patient before she was
called.
Dr. William D. Clark, a regular physi
cian, repeated the story which he had
told to the reporters and the Coroner a
week before, to the effect that the de
ceased told him that Mrs. Dr. Goodwin
had performed a criminal operation upon
her.
The jury, however. Ignored this testi
mony and brought in the verdict against
unknown parties.
Dr. Popper began by swearing that he
was ;i doctor, and when he was asked as
t" the name of the college from which he
might have graduated he said that he
was not a doctor and thnt lie would not
answer any more questions, on the ground
that his answers might criminate him.
Coroner Hawkins held several other in
quests yesterday, the most important be
ing that on the case of the death of Wm.C.
Antisc-11. who fell oft" a car of the Mission
str. et electric line arid whose skull was
fractured by the fall. The witnesses tes
tified that Antisell boarded the car at the
r ( i" Market and Third streets and
tork up his position on the front plat
form. When the car got about half-way
between Third and Fourth streets on
Mission Antisell attempted to get off
without notifying the conductor or the
grlprr.an to stop the car. and in jumping
off from the middle step of the dummy
he fell on his back in the street and struck
so violently r-n the fcteck of his head that
his skull was fractured and he was ren
dered unconscious.
The jury returned a verdict to the ef
fect that the deceased came to his death
from injuries following a fractured skull
anu "that death was caused by the de
ceased accidentally falling from a Ms
sion-street car while the car was going
at a moderate rate of speed, and we fur
ther exonerate the railroad company from
all blame."
A verdict of accidental death was ren
dered in the case of Capitalist William
Miller, who was asphyxiated at his resi
dence. 17D9 Sutter street, by the gas pres
sure diminishing during the night and ex
tinguishing the flame while the deceased
was asleep.
A verdict of suicide was returned in
the case of James C. Cary. a retired law
yer, who shot himself through the head.
j. ij. Cary, a son of the deceased, testi
fied that his father was T.i years old. and
had been confined to the house by sick
ness for about three years. The deceased
had not spoken of eomtnitting suicide,
but had often said that he would not
want to live If he got so old that he
â¢would not be able to lake care of himself.

Burying Indigent Dead.
The Health and Police Committee of the
Supervisors had before it- yesterday
morning the bids of * the Pacific' Under
takers, Joseph -JTnjran Â£â  in.. .T. P fi
deau, Edward ,. Kelly . and McAvoy & Co.
for the burying of the city's indigent
dead for the next fiscal year. The
amounts asked were: Pacific Undertak
ers, $6 97; Hagan & Co., $8 25; Godeau,
$8 99; Kelly. $8 05; McAvoy, $9 55. These
figures were based on permission to inter
in San Francisco, but otherwise there
was a uniform bid of $16 for each body if
interred elsewhere. Objections were made
to giving the contract to Hagan & Co.
and Kelly on the grounds that they had
not been engaged in the undertaking
business during the six months imme
diately preceding the advertising for con
tracts. To get on the right side of this
legal snarl the matter was submitted to
the City and County Attorney for his
opinion.

LITTLE DROPS COME
PATTERING DOWN
MUCH REJOICING IN THE OUT-
LYING DISTRICTS.
Light Showers All Along the Coast
Which Will Greatly Benefit
Farmers and Fruit
Growers.
Early yesterday morning the skies were
darkened, heavy clouds rolled over the
horizon, and, to the joy of hundreds, par
ticularly in the rural districts, the rain
came gently down.
Although very light, the Intermittent
showers which continued throughout the
day and night were looked upon as a
blessing. The rain conies too late in the
Beason to entirely save the crops, but
early enough to be beneficial. Much of
the "wheat, which otherwise would have
been entirely lost, may now attain a suffi
cient growth to make good straw, but
the grain will be very little benefited.
The rain is still early enough to help the
orchard crop, and will be worth thou
sands of dollars to fruit-growers.
Showers were reported all along the
coast and creeping steadily inland. There
was a large area of low pressure between
the Rockies and Sierras, which made a
strong indraught of air along the
coast At the headquarters of the
Weather Service in the top of the Mills
building the little electrical machine re
corded a rainfall of four-hundredths of
an inch and wind velocity of twelve miles
an hour. Light showers are predicted for
to-day and possibly to-morrow.

METERS MADE TO RUN.
The Fower of a Magnet Demonstrates
Strange Things at the City Hall.
It has been asserted that the electric
1 meters at the City Hall have been tam
pered with. This information was con
veyed to the Finance Committee of the
. Supervisors yesterday by a representa
i tive of the Gas and Electric Company.
Superintendent Smith of the Edison
Company attended the meeting and made
a practical test for the purpose of show
ing how it was possible to accelerate the
motion of an electric meter by bringing
i its mechanism within the field of a pow
1 erful electro magnet. A meter was set
1 upon the committee room table and put
in operation, when by a single applica
1 tion of an electro magnet Mr. Smith ac
' celerated its motion 21 per cent.
It was stated on behalf of the company
that it was absolutely certain that some
, person had Intentionally tampered with
i the meters.
A great many questions were asked by
I the members of tho committee regarding
1 the workings of the meters, and In order
! to get more light upon the question the
'. matter was continued until the next
meeting.

Here Is the grand record for California
for 1597 as the greatest mineral State of
the Union, all things considered. The in
crease for the year is near $1,000,000. This
State has for the first time in its history
now taken second place as a gold pro
ducer, but in the variety of its mineral
products California yet proudly main
tains its prestige. Its pre-eminence as a
i gold producer is certain soon to return
i to it. and meantime the variety of its
' mineral products is as great as the vari
ety of its fruits, and in both mineral and
horticultural fields it is matchless.
The figures here given are wholly those
of considerable present commercial im
! portance. The diamonds, amethysts, etc.,
of California, which treble or sextuple
the list of the State's mineral resources,
are not mentioned. In round figures the

MISS BARBIER'S ANSWER.
Alleges That Harry Emeric Struck
Her and Drove Her From
His House.
The Emeric will contest came up In
Judge Troutt's department of the Superior
Court yesterday morning. A simple mo
tion to strike out certain portions of the
amended complaint constituted the day s
proceedings, and those who came expect
ing to enjoy a sensation or two went away
disappointed. The case will alain,b^a l ain , b^
taken up next Friday, and the hearing
may proceed. Â , .^
Miss Lorena Myrtle Barb er, legatee
under the will of Mrs. Emeric, has hied
her answer to the contest of Harry numer
ic, husband of the deceased. Miss Bar
bier's answer intimates that had she de
sired she might have succeeded her de
ceased sister as the wife of Emeric. She
produces a number of love letters from
the contestant alleged to have been writ
ten within a week after his wife s death,
and has placed one in the hands of the
court. She denies that the contestant edu
cated and supported her. and that she in
fluenced Mrs. Emeric to make a will in
her favor. Miss Barbier alleges that she
was forced to leave Emerie s house on
account of his brutal treatment, and
states that at one time he struck her, using
a small dog as a weapon, and continued
to strike her until the dog was dead. Other
stories of a similar nature are expected
to crop up during the trial, and an inter
esting session Is expected.

robbery to Captain Spillane. beveral of
ficers were at once dispatched to the
scene, but they were unable to get a
trace of the desperate men.
Mr. Harrison describes the man who
struck him with the sandbag as being
about 35 years of age and having a red
dish mustache. lit- was poorly dressed
and wore a slouch hat, which was pulled
down over his eyes. His companion was
rather short, and had several weeks'
growth of beard on his face.
In telling his story to Chief Lees yes
terday, the victim of the thugs said he
had been visiting a friend, and was on
the way home, when he noticed the rob
bers. They were concealed in a doorway,
and as he passed them the taller of the
two men attacked him.
As he fell to the sidewalk the wielder
of the sandbag told his companion to
"search the bloke." Catching a gljmpse
of the diamond studs which adorned Mr.
Harrison's shirt bosom, the younger rob
ber hastily wrenched them from their
fastenings". After satisfying themselves
that they had secured all his valuables,
the thugs left the scene and immediately
disappeared in the darkness.
During the past few weeks several rob
beries have occurred in the same vicinity.
The police are inclined to believe that the
men who assaulted Mr. Harrison are re
sponsible for the hold-ups, and every ef
fort is being made to apprehend them.
TO SETTLE THE
UNIFORM QUESTION
AN APPEAL WILL EE SENT TO
WASHINGTON.
Labor Men Despair of Being Able to
Make a Satisfactory Agree
ment With Major
Long.
The publication of the fact that a num
ber of the uniforms for the volunteers
â wore being manufactured in Chinatown
has created a stir which promises to res
urrect the old question of Chinese labor.
During the past week every labor organi
zation in the city has discussed the mat
ter ar.d committees from both central
bodies have been conferring with Labor
Commissioner ruzgerald and Major Long
In an effort to have the matter adjusted
without appealing to the War Depart
ment, but no satisfactory arrangements
have as yet been made.
At the meeting of the Labor Council
last night its committee reported that,
while Major Long had promised to re
quest contractors to' give the work to
white people only, he would not agree to
imposing a fine for violation of such an
agreement. A committee from the Build
ing Trades Council was present and re
quested the sister body to indorse the res
olutions published in this morning's Call,
a copy of which ha.s already been for
warded to Washington by telegraph. The
council, after a lengthy discussion, in
dorsed the resolutions and ordered that a
telegram be sent to Washington urging
that in the future a clause be inserted in
all contracts which would effectually put
a stop to the work being done by Chinese.
Bo heated did the members become over
the matter that many are of the opinion
that, should the Government refuse to
grant this request, such action be taken
by worklngmen as would compel recruit
ing officers to go to Chinatown for vol
unteers on the next call for troops.
The routine business of the council was
very light. The Musicians' Union report
ed that the Society of Old Friends had
canceled its contract with a non-union
band and had agreed to have union music
at its picnic. The late Judge Campbell
â was president of this society, and he had
been appealed to to use his influence in
the matter. After his death a letter was
found in his pocket addressed to the
union, stating that he was a friend of
workingmen and would do his utmost to
give the job to union musicians. It was
at a meeting called chiefly to consider
this matter that he died. The letter was
forwarded to the union by Archie Camp
bell, and was ordered spreaa on the min
utes. It was further reported that busi
ness was fairly good, owing to the num
ber of musicians employea in escorting
troops from the depot to the camps.
The printers reported that the strikÂ©
condition was practically unchanged, and
that the union is constantly in need of
financial assistance, as the strike ex
penses average over $1200 per week. Semi
monthly donations are made oy many of
the local unions, which are very accept
able, and an appeal has been sent out to
Eastern unions.

COURTS TO BE INVOKED
CLARA AND CHARLES SOLICIT
OUS FOR THEIR FATHER
Rumor Persistent in Asserting That
a Strong Effort Will Be MadÂ©
to Change the Ole Man's
Residence.
There was a rumor current yesterday
that Charles and Clara Sutro, children
of Adolph Sutro, would resort to legal
proceedings to-day, with a view to having
the enfeebled philanthropist restored to
his home by the ocean. Some weeks ago
a gTeat deal of comment was occasioned
by his being forcibly removed from there
by his daughter, Mrs. Dr. Merritt, despite
the protestations of other children. Since
then he has been occupying apartments
in the Merritt residence, receiving the
care and professional skill of his daugh
ter. It was said that the other children
were opposed to his remaining there, as
he missed the ocean breezes and the fa
miliar scenes of his beautiful home, and
that this was retrmling his recovery.
Rumor also had it that the two chil
dren had combined against Mrs. Dr. Mer
ritt and -had instructed their attorneys,
Messrs. Bishop and Wheeler, to institute
proper legaJ remedies for the possession
of his person.
Miss Clara Sutro, a daughter of the ex-
Mayor, was seen at the family residence
last evening, and although not denying
that such a course would be pursued, was
reluctant to say anything in the matter
and referred her interviewer to her at
torney, Charles S. Wheeler.
When seen the latter did not deny that
he was going to file some papers, whether
to-day or to-morrow he could nor sa\
"There is not to my persona! knowledge
anything in the rumor," said Mr. Wheeler,
"that papers will be filed to-day to gain
possession of his person. It is my opin
ion Mr. Sutro will be in his home within
a short timeâ that is. as soon as his
strength and the weather will permit. I
am the attorney for Miss Clara, and as
such have not been called on to prepare
siu-h papers. The documents that will be
filed shortly relate to taxes and rmittt-r.-*
appertaining to the estate. I am not de
sirous at present to make known their
contents, as it would be unprofessional.
Everything is going along smoothly, and
I think that the children will reach an
amicable settlement and the old gentle
man will be removed to the Heights. I
can assure you that so far as I know there
will he no effort to have him taken there
by legal means."
PABST CAFE BEOPENS.
Hagerty & Leor.hardt Are the New
Managers Who Will Conduct
It to Success.
The Pabst Cafe at the junction of
Powell and Ellis streets is to be re
opened.
Such an announcement will undoubt
edly come to many of the people of the
city as a pleasurable surprise and the
consummation of a long existent desire.
Since its discontinuance some months
ago San Francisco has been deprived
of one of its most select, handsome and
most appropriate family as well as
private resorts and its recontinuance is
looked forward to by the general pub
lic with eager anticipation.
There are many cafes throughout the
length and breadth of the city, but
there is none that people can look to
with more pride than the gem of ar
tistic and architectural beauty on
Powell street. Its reopening under a
new management will most certainly
inspire the public with confidence in
the indefatigable efforts that are being
exerted by the present owners in open
ing the once popular resort on a larger
and more elaborate style and Bystem of
accommodation.
Messrs. Charles Leonhardt and Rob
ert D. Hagerty, two of San Francisco's
native sons, are the new managers and
need little, if any, introduction to the
public. For six years they conjointly
conducted the Golden Gate Villa at the
Ocean Beach and it Is needless to say
well and successfully. They are young
men who understand their business
thoroughly and intend to put this
knowledge and skilled tact of manage
ment toward furthering the success of
their new venture by first endeavoring
to please their patrons, as they have
been accustomed to do for years.
The accommodation of the Pabst Cafe
at present Is forty private dining
rooms, including one large dining-room
superbly decorated and adorned with
valuable and costly original oil paint-
Ings, depicting the principal character
istic scenery of California, Including
glimpses of Yasemite Valley, the su
perb beauty of our mountain systems,
etc.
The cafe is destined to spring into
popularity almost as soon as it is open
ed under the new management, as un
der a complete and more desirable ac
commodation, the lack of which has
been the cause of Its previous decay
as a popular resort. Its proximity with
the leading theaters and easy access to
almost the entire railway system of
the city will increase its popularity, as
it will be most convenient to theater
goers. *
Alleged Horse Thieves.
F. Buchignani. a teamster living at
1417% Dupont street, swore to a complaint
in Judge Joachimsen's court yesterday
for the arrest of C. Bacigalupi and Robert
Jlentz two boys, on the charge of grand
larceny. Buchignant alleges that he had
two horses grazing In a lot at Lombard
and Francisco streets, and Tuesday after
noon the two boys rode away with the
horses and it is thought sold them.
Will Examine the Books.
Judge Belcher yesterday granted City
Attorney Creswell permission to examine
the books of the City Treasury for the
purpose of securing evidence to be used
in the suit of the city against ex-Treas
urer Widber and his sureties, the Fidelity
and Deposit Company of Maryland. In
;>!! probability the suit will be tried next
month.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 28, IS9B.
A NEW PARK COMMISSIONER.
Dr, John F. Morse Will Succeed Irving M, Scott, Who
Has Just Resigned,
Irving M. Scott has been called East to consult the Navy Department forth
with on matters of grave importance. In order to make the trip without violat
ing that law which forbids park commissioners to leave the State he has for
warded his resignation.
Mr. Scott's term had really expired, though under the law a commissioner Is
allowed to hold office until his successor is appointed and qualified. It will
please those who know his sterling qualities to learn that Dr. John F. Morse
will probably be appointed to the position made by Mr. Scott's resignation, and
that the appointment will be made at an early date. Dr. Morse has a wide circle
of friends, and nobody stands higher among laymen as well as among mem
bers of his own profession than he. His education and habits have been such
as to carry out his esthetic tastes. He is a lover of good horses and an admirer
of art and landscape gardening, so he will bring to the duties of commissioner a
most thorough comprehension of the needs of the park and a skillful taste
in helping to mold it into various forme of use and beauty.
COMMISSIONERS
ARE PATRIOTIC
Golden Gate Park for
Military Drills.
PARADES ON THE ROADS
TBOOPS IN THE CITY'S PLEAS
UBE" GROUND.
Full Use of the Main Driveway Up
to 9 O'Clock a. m. â Side
Boads Are Freely
Accorded.
The volunteer troops !n camp at
Richmond find Golden Gate Park a de
lightful place for exercise. The broad
avenues and smooth place around the
music stand afford ideal drill grounds,
and the Park Commissioners in their
patriotism have ignored many idle ob
jections to the use of the park for the
purposes of military instruction and
given the regimental and company of
ficers much greater freedom than is al
lowed for purposes of drill on the Pre
sidio reservation, owned by the Gov
ernment. At the Presidio only the
drill plain can be used by the soldiers.
At Golden Gate Park the main drive
way can be used by the troop 3 until 9
o'clock in the morning. Use of the side
drives and the ample spaces around the
music stand is permitted at all times.
At the last meeting of thu Board of
Park Commissioners some protests
were made by persons who ride and
drive in the park against the use
of the main driveway for drilling
troops. The protests allege that the
evolutions of the various command.!
frighten the horses and increase the
danger of accidents. In order to ac
commodate the military people and at
the same time keep the main avenue
free for the pleasure and convenience
of the public, Irving M. Scot! intro
duced a resolution, which \va9 adopted,
giving the soldiers free use of the main
driveway until 9 a. m. each day, and
after that hour giving it exclusively to
the public use.
No restriction was placed on the use
of any other section of the park drives
by the troops. The lawns, of course,
are not used for drill purposes at any
military post and are not so used at
Golden Gate Park.
The generous use of the grounds in
Golden Gate Park accorded by the
Board of Commissioners Is appreciated
by the officers and enlisted men of the
volunteer army encamped at Rich
mond. It Is a beautiful sight to see the
men marching and drilling, and thou
sands of spectators enjoy the spectacle,
regarding it as an additional attraction
of the magnificent pleasure ground. It
will be counted to the credit of patriotic
San Francisco in years to come that
her superb park was practically given
to the Government as a camp of in
struction for the volunteer regiments.

El Campo.
The Ukiah was pretty well crowded the
day our boys sailed for Manila, but on
Sunday there is an abundance of room
for all comers. Four round trips give
plenty of deckroom for all. There is no
dust at El Campo. so the rain wasn't
really necessary. It made the trees look
fresher, however.
Dairymen Seek Pasture.
In consequence of the dry season and
the advance in the price of feed several
dairymen have sought new pasturage for
their stock. Among those who have de
cided to move their stock from San Fran
cisco is Richard Keller. Kelier has start
ed his entire herd for Marin County,
where he expects to obtain better and
cheaper feed. Several other milkirfen will
move their stock to adjoining counties in
the near future for the same reason.

NEWHALL
STANDS PAT
Olympic President Talks
of the Dismissals.
SAYS THEY WERE JUSTIFIED
BUT THE MAJORITY OF MEM
BERS ARE IN REVOLT.
They Strongly Object to the Methods
of the Management as Sacri
ficing Clean Sport to
Money.
Never in the history of the Olympic
Club has there been such Internal strife
as has been created by the discharge of
Professor Walter Watson and Professor
Hugo Beleau. Members have risen in
open revolt against the action of the
board of directors, and threaten all sorts
of things, while the board, believing as
it does that it has acted wisely and in the
interest of the organization, vows to re
sign if its action is not upheld.
The exclusive story of its action as pub
lished in The Call last Thursday has
created a deal of discussion among mem
bers and the large following of the manly
art in this city. It would seem that the
consensus of opinion is that the directors
are making- a grave mistake when they
discharge such a recognized exponent of
boxing as Professor Watson.
Charges of lack of interest on the part
of the leader, Howard Taylor, are fre-
I quenMy heard, and the directors are crlti
i cized for their bad management. It is
! said that if the latter had paid more at
; tention to the welfare of the members
I and not to money-making ventures such
| as professional fights there would be no
need to retrench by discharging Watson
and Beleau.
Howard Taylor's unpopularity with the
members is another reason advanced to
account for the present conllict. In
years past, it is said, the gymnasium was
crowdeil daily with gymnasts, boxers,
wrestlers and fencers, because the leaders
created interest by frequently holding
tournaments. During the past six months
members have been compelled to buy
their way into the club to see men pum
mel each other, while under other di
rectors they were able to witness clever
exhibitions" without charge. Under the
present leader the interest in athletics
has subsided, and now, as was pointedly
remarked by one dissatisfied member,
"the club has been turned into a good
bathhouse."
With a view to meeting the present
crisis President Newhall called a meeting
of the board in his office yesterday, but
owing to the inclement weather but one
put in an appearance, and he was "Billy'
Kennedy, a salaried employe. Another
notice was sent out by Mr. Newhall for a
special meeting, which will be held in the
club on Tuesday next.
When asked whether the directors
would be governed by the wishes of the
members, Mr. Newhall said: "We have
acted in this matter as we think proper,
and if the members are not satisfied with
what we have done it is about time we
resigned. The reason why Mr. Watson
was discharged was because of his slow
ness and inattention to business. We had
Occasion to remonstrate with him. but he
paid no attention to what was said. It is
said that DeWitt Van Court was slated for
the position of instructor, but it is not
so. He has been recommended by mem
bers, as also has Professor Bean. The
latter hns been strongly objected to, and
if we can decide on neither we will send
Kast and get the best to be had. Mem
!Â» rs have frequently complained of Mr.
Watson, saying that he went about a les
son as if he was conferring a favor. He
lias gone round to many prominent mem
beri who are my friends and asked them
to intercede in his behalf. They have
done so. but I do not consider them judges
of Mr. Watson, as they are not in the
habit of going into the gymnasium. The
reason why we let Mr. Beleau out is that
there is not enough for him to do during
the summer months. On June Ist the
juvenile class closes for two months. Then
again, a great many of the ladies are
away in the country, and it was thought
that Professor Meihllng was able to at
tend to these along with his other duties,
thus saving quite n sum to the club. I do
not care to say anything about Mr. Tay
lor's qualifications as a leader, as he is
acting as su^'n under my administration.
I do not think the directors will interfere
in the matter, as the change Is needed
and is the best thing fnr the club."

Bad Digestion, Bad Heart.
Poor digestion often causes Irregularity
of- the heart's action. This Irregularity
may be mistaken for real, organic heart
disease. The symptoms are much the
same. There is, however, a vast differ-
ence between the two: organic heart dis-
| ease' Is often incurable; apparent heart
disease Is curable if good digestion be
restored.
A case In point is quoted from the New
Era of Greensburg, Ind. Mrs. Ellen Col-
som. Newpoint, Ind., a woman 43 years
old, had suffered for four years with dis-
tressing stomach trouble. The gases gen-
erated by the indigestion pressed on the
heart and caused an irregularity of its
action. She had much pain in her stomach
and heart, and was subject to frequent
and severe ' choking spells, which were
most severe at night. Doctors were tried
in vain; the patient became worse, de-
spondent, and feared Impending death
- . r**
A Case of Heart Failure. .
She was much frightened, but noticed
that in Intervals in - which' her ' stomach
did not annoy her her heart's action be-
came normal. -Reasoning -correctly that
her. digestion was alone at fault she pro-
cured the proper medicine to treat that
trouble, and with immediate good results.
Her appetite came 'back,; the â¢â¢ choking
spells became, less frequent and finally
ceased. Her weight, which had been
greatly reduced,' was restored, and she
now weighs more than for years. Her
blood soon became pure and her cheeks
rosy. â 
The case Is of general interest ' because
the disease is a very. common one. That
others may know the means of cure we
give â  the I name of the medicine usedâ Dr.
Williams' * Pink Pills < for Pale . Peopfo.
These pills contain all the elements neces-
sary to give ! new life and richness to â¢ the
blood and restore shattered nerves.
