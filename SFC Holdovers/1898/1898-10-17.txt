Among the Victin)s of the Terrible
Disaster.
LONDON, Oct. 16. â The Atlantic
Transport Company issued the follow
ing statement this evening regarding
the fate of the passengers and crew of
the steamer Mohegaii, which was
wrecked last Friday off the Lizard,
between the Manacles and the low
lands:
"Of the passengers eleven have been
Bayed, ten bodies have been recovered
and thirty-three are missing-.
"Of the crew and cattlemen thirty
rine have been saved, fourteen bodies
have been recovered and fifty-one are
missing:."
Since this statement was issued nine
other bodies have been picked up, in
cluding two that have been identified
as those of passengers.
The reports of the various correspond
ents differ widely as to the rescues, re
coveries and losses, though none has
been able to obtain the exact number of
those saved or of the bc-dies recovered.
The bodies of the following passen
gers have been recovered:
T. W. KING.
F.DNA KING.
MASTER KING.
JAMES BLACKEY.
MISS H. M. COWEN.
MR FALLOWS.
B. FRANKLIN FULLER.

iÂ£>irmi\i*b. the others to the village
aÂ£ v at St. Keverine. The rescued
sseiigers are being sheltered at cot
tages along the shore and the crew at
the Sailors' Home at Falmouth.
Tugs have been cruising in the vicin
ity all day, despite the very rough
weather, in the hope of picking up
other bodies.
The cause of the disaster remains the
profoundest mystery. Nobody attempts
to explain how the Mohegan got so far
* north of her true courseâ six to
seven miles. There was no fog at the
time, while the wind on her port quar
ter was not sufficient to prevent her
answering the helm. It has been sug
gested that her compass was faulty,
but daylight lasted long after Eddy-
Btone light was passed.
The sailors say the fact that the Liz
ard light was not visible should have
served to give the alarm.
The masts of the Mohegan, which are
above water, show that her stern is
landward, causing a theory that the
navigation officer, on discovering that
he was in the bay, suddenly turned
seaward. Two engineers who were
saved declare, however, that they never
slackened speed.
Remarkable stories of rescue con
tinue.
Robert Barrow, a seaman, performed
the feat of swimming through the
Toughest water to Cove Rack Point, a j
distance of two and a half miles. He |
climbed up the rugged cliff, where a i
searching party found him early the j
next morning completely exhausted. A.
C. L. Smith of Oregon, a passenger,
surrendered to a woman in the water
wreckage that was supporting him and
swam ashore unaided. The woman was
saved. Her name is reported as Miss j
. "Webb, but no such name appears in
the company's list.
Messrs. Smith and W. J. Blooming
dale say there was the greatest diffi
culty in launching the boats. The ropes
were new and stiff and the blocks would
not work. Four or five times as many j
Bailors as should have been necessary j
struggled to lower each boat. The
lockers were hard to open. * .
The crew, in a chivalrous effort to
save the women, made a mistake of
undermanning the boats. There were
only four sailors in one boat, which
capsized as soon as it was launched.
Messrs. Smith and Bloomingdale say
that Captain Griffiths had appeared ill
all day.
The death of T. W. King, who was a
newspaper proprietor of Namucket,
Mass., and of his family, including Mrs.
King, her mother, Mrs. Weller, and his
sons, Rufus. aged 11 years, and An
thony, aged seven, has caused deep sor
row at Penzance, where the family had
a summer cottage and were very pop-
War.
Joseph O'Rourke, King's valet, who
â was saved, says he was on deck when
the crash came. The lights went out |
Immediately. Rushing to the saloon he j
heard Mr. King exhorting his family to j
keep cool. O'Rourke, with seven others,
clung to the rigging until 6 o'clock yes
terday morning, when a lifeboat took
him off. He identified the bodies of the
Kings and Mrs. Weller. and will have
them embalmed and taken to the
United States in accordance with ca
bled instruction^ from the relatives of
the family 'at Nantucket.
The description in the London dis
patch of Mr. T. W. King, as a news
paper proprietor at Nantucket. Mass..
Is probably erroneous.
Inquiry shows that the prop
rietors of the local papers In Nantucket
The San Francisco Call
and Its vicinity bear other names. In
Boston newspaper circles Mr. Kine's
name is unfamiliar. Probably he was a
wealthy summer resident of Nantucket.
THE DISASTER* IS
UTTERLY INEXPLICABLE
FALMOUTH, Oct. 16.â John H. His
lop, the New York yachtsman, who was
saved, in the course of an interview
this afternoon condemned the double
railing around the ship's boats, which,
he said, impeded the launching. The
masthead light, in his opinion, should
have been an oil instead of an electric
lamp, as in that event it would not
have been extinguished, but would have
furnished a beacon to guide the life
boats.
Mr. Williams, the company's mana
ger, says the disaster Is utterly inexpli
cable. The ship was new, he asserts,
while the captain and crew were most
reliable. He says the crews of the com
pany's vessels have constant boat prac
tice, and he is indignant at the insinu
ations regarding the condidtion of Cap
tain Griffith.
Up to midnight fifty-one bodies had
been recovered. Some were found miles
away, in coves; and it is expected more
will be washed ashore to-morrow.
Many persons undoubtedly were
killed by being dashed on the rough
rocks, who would have escaped if cast
ashore on an ordinary coast. Some of
the bodies are horribly mangled. A
great deal of jewelry and money have
been found.
As all the navigating officers were
lost, it is doubtful whether light will
ever be thrown on the cause of the dis
aster.
All the flags ashore and on the boats
in the bay are at half-mast.
SAN FRANCISCO WOMAN
ONE OF THE VICTIMS
CHICAGO, Oct. 16.â Mrs. S. C. Crane,
mentioned in the dispatches as the wife
of Stephen Crane, the novelist, lost on
the steamer Mohegan, is Mrs. Sophia
Cass Crane of San Francisco. Her
brother, Rev. F. A. Hall of Westfield.
N. V., is in the city on business, and is
stopping at the Palmer House. Mr.
Hall only learned of the disaster to the
Mohegan on Saturday night, and was
shocked to read the name of his
sister in the passenger list of the lost
vessel.
"I left my sister in London four
weeks ago," said Mr. Hall to-night,
"and there is no doubt in my mind that
she sailed on the Mohegan. She was to
have sailed about that time, and the
initials being the same makes it cer
tain in my mind that she has been lost.
I received a telegram from Mrs.
Crane's sister In San Francisco, and
she also believes Mrs. Crane drowned.
We have been traveling together in
England since July 1, and I left Eng
land September 1. She was to have
stayed in London four weeks, and was
bound for her home In San Francisco.
There is a possibility that she was
aboard some boat that has landed in
an out of the way place, but the
chances seem to be against it."
Mr. Hall is a clergyman of Westfield,
| N. V., and arrived in this city on Frl
i.day. He leaves for his home to-mor-
I row.
MRS. MARY FRASER
ABOARD THE MOHEGAN
TOLEDO. Oct 16.â S. W. Fraser. a
well known Toledo attorney has re
ceived word that his sister, Mrs. Mary
Fraser of Marion, Ind., was aboard the
ill-fated steamc-r Mohegan.
NORWEGIAN SLOOP
DRIVEN ON ROCKS
NEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE, Oct. 16.â
The Norwegian sloop Fremzad was
driven on the rocks at Blyth, about
eleven miles north of Newcastle, in a
fierce sea to-day. The crew was res
cued after heroic work by the life
boats, one of which capsized in the at
tempt.
FAIR MRS. COLGATE
TO WED A TITLE
From England Conies a Rumor of Her
Betrothal to the Earl of
Stafford.
NEW YORK, Oct. 16.â From England
comes the rumor that Mrs. Samuel J.
Colgate of this city is engaged to the
Earl of Stafford.
Mrs. Colgate is a beautiful woman, the
widow of Samuel J. Colgate, the New
York banker, who died here four years
ago, leaving to his widow and children a
handsome fortune estimated to be In the
millions. Mrs. Colgate has been living
abroad for the last three years, and for
two seasons past has been about a great
deal in the best English society.
Lord Stafford is the fourth Earl of
Stafford, having succeeded to the title last
March on me death of his brother. Pre
vious to that, as Hon. Henry William
Byng, he was an equery to Queen V ic
toria.' He is a widower, his wife, who
died in ISSO, having been before her mar
riage Countess Henrietta Danneskiold
Samsoe of Denmark, a direct descendant
of Christian V, King of Denmark, and,
therefore, related to the Princess of
Wales.

Lagaspl have prevented the American

PARIS, Oct. 16.â Senor Agoncillo,
special envoy of the Philippine insur

late this afternoon. He has apartments
at the Hotel Continental, on the same
floor with the members of the United
States Peace Commission, whom he
came to see regarding the fate of the
Philippines, but whom he has not yet
met.
MADRID, Oct. 16.â La Epoca, the
conservative organ, renews the sugges
tion of La Correspondencia (independ
ent and semi-official) regarding arbi
tration between the United States and
Spain. It says:
"The negotiations at present are go
ing on without touching the question of
the Philippines, which is most obscure,
and which lends itself to the gravest
dissensions. Owing to the vagueness
and lack of clearness of the proctocol
the Commissioners are meeting with se
rious difficulties. It has been said
that if our adversaries are obstinate
in their exaggerated demands, Senor
Sagasta should address the European
Governments, asking arbitration, at
least upon the points to which an
agreement could not be reached; but
in view of the election struggle now In
full vigor in the United States and of
the declamations of the jingo press,
which affirm without limit the rights
of the conqueror, it is safe to assume
that a request for arbitration would be
without avail and serve no other pur
pose than loss of time."
SULTAN RECEIVES .
MINISTER STRAUS
Hopes the American Will Soon Be
Elevated to the Bank of an
Ambassador.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Oct. 16.â The Sul
tan to-day gave an audience to Oscar S.
Straus, the new United States Minister,
with the customary ceremonies of re
ception, which was of the most cordial
character. His Majesty expressed pleas
ure at seeing Mr. Straus again, and his
hope that the excellent relations which
prevailed between Turkey and the United
States during Mr. Straus* previous term
at Constantinople would be maintained.
The Sultan added that he understood
the United States proposed to raise the
American Legation to the rank of an
embassy and to make Mr. Straus an Em
bassador, a suggestion which, he ob
served, was being carefully considered by
the Ottoman Government.
After the audience at the palace Mr.
Straus visited the Porte and then the
American colony.

A.merican Commissioners Told to Tell
the Dons That They Must Pay
the Price of Their Suit
for Peace.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 16.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: While firmly believing that
Spain will in the end submit to the de
mands of the United States before re
engaging In hostilities the authorities
propose to be in a position wheVe they
can make an effective demonstration
should such action be needed.
The evacuation of Porto Rico, the
repatriation of 9000 Spanish troops who
were stationed in the western section
of Cuba and the loading of others on
transports constitute evidence the ad
ministration officials say, of Spain's In
tention to continue at peace with the
United States.
The session of the Peace Commission
to-morrow is expected to be one of the
most important yet Leld, for the Amer
ican representatives are under instruc
tions to make the Spanish representa
tives plainly aware :hat their Govern
ment has sued for peace and must Day
the price of such suit. It is admitted
by the administration officials that for
the sake of public opinion and to give
the Spanish people and the world the
impression they are acting under dur
ess the Spanish Commissioners may re
sist the demands of the United States
until a naval demonstration is neces
sary. In such an event all of the armor
clads will be available.
The wisdom of the administration In
delaying the departure of the battle
ships Oregon and lowa, and of directing
them to participate in the celebration
at Rio de Janeiro in honor of the anni
versary of the establishment of the re
public of Brazil is beginning to be ap
preciated. These vessels under the
plan of the department will not leave
Rio de Janeiro before November 20. and
possibly even later. By that time it
will have pretty clearly developed
whether Spain purposes to comply with
the demands of this Government or will
undergo the humiliation of a naval
demonstration before accepting terms.

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Oct. 16.â The
meeting of the Cuban Assembly at
Santa Cruz is fixed for October 20. but
owing to lack of transportation facili
ties the members of the Assembly will
be unable to arrive at Santa Cruz on
time, and the end of the month probab
ly will have come 1 efore the election
of a President and Cabinet takes place.
El Cubano, a daily paper of Santiago
predicts the election of the following
ticket:
President â Gen. Maximo Gomez.
Vice-President â Senor Sartolome
Maso.
Secretary of Foreign Affairs â Dr.
Domingo Mendez Capote.
Home Secretary â Senor Benjamin
Guerra.
Secretary of Justice â Senor Jose
A. Laouza.
Secretary of War â Gen. Calixto
Garcia.
Secretary of Public Instruction â
Senor Enrique Varona.
The local papers are much wrought
up over propositions denying the right
of the Americans to grant concessions
which Cuba Libre would repudiate.
General Wood has received a letter
from Havti requesting permission by
many returning Cuban families to
bring with them agricultural im
plements free of duty. General Wood
replied President McKinley's prolama
tion permitted this.
The telephone wires in the neighbor
hood of Santiago have been broken
down by Cubans for use in binding hay
ricks. General Wood has ordered the
arrest of all persons found to be con
cerned in the affairs.
Many things have occurred which
tend to show that the Spanish land
system of registration is apparently
perfect. Judge Advocate Blount has
been agreeably surprised by finding in
many, instances his work simplified.

TACOMA, Oct. 16.â According to ad
vices brought by the steamship Tacoma
from China and Japan the (Mental
press is still in an excited state over
the triumph of the Dowager Empress
over the Emperor of China. The press
is unable to solve the riddle of the
transfer of po-wer. The Emperor's pro
posed reforms were widespread and not
at all satisfactory to the masses. His
last and most radical change was con
tained in an edict which proposed that
an annual budget should be Issued,
â which should set forth the annual ex
penses, so the people could suggest re
forms and means of economizing. The
Emperor advised the gentry to embark
in the newspaper business for the pur
pose of educating the people. His edict
confiscating temples and other places
of worship for educational purposes was
opposed from all quarters.
A band erf desperadoes numbering
2000, with 4000 disbanded Manchu sol

Farmers in the Kansu District, China,
ascribing the cause of the long-prevail

have demolished poles and wires.
An uprising has occurred in Hainan,
China, and the American Cansul has
been besought to protect the American
missionaries. The uprising was fo
mented in the band of pirates known
as the Triad Society and the local mili
tia joined the band of thieves. Soldiers
have been sent to the scene.
Floods in Japan have done great dam
age to- crops and many lives have been
lost. Aichi prefecture, which seems to
have suffered most, lost thirty-five
houses, washed away, 1200 overthrown,
170 partly wrecked, 412 damaged and
E6OO inundated. Seven lives were lost.
Twelve hundred acres of land were
flooded.
PRINCE JUN WILL
ASSUME THE CROWN
LONDON, Oct. 16.â The P<*king cor
respondent of the Daily Telegraph
says: It is said in the highest circles
that the Emperor will be formally de
posed on November 23, the birthday of
the Empress Dowager, and that Prince
Jun, a boy of 13, will be nominated as
his successor.
The Berlin correspondent of the Stan
<*ai^says. The Emperor of China was
to have taken refuge at the British Em
bassy in Peking, whence he would have
issued a proclamation declaring the
acts of the Dowager Empress void, but
the plan was discovered and frustrated.
The Peking correspondent of the
Times says: Prince Ching, president of
the Tsung Li Yamen, has informed Sir
Claude Macdonald officially f hat the
health of the Emperor is improving. He
declares that the Empress Dowager la
not opposed to genuine reform, but
only to such violent and impracticable
reforms as were hastily decreed. Her
Majesty will proceed on lines more
adapted to Chinese conditions.
The Baptist mission at Sing Ngan Fu,
in the province of Shen Si, has appealed
for protection.
DOWAGER EMPRESS
INSTITUTES REFORMS
PEKING, Oct. 16.â The reactionary
policy of the Dowager Empress seems
likely to return to moderation. An edict
just issued promises to attend to the
â¢welfare of the people and to do the best
to secure prosperity. The edict pro
vides for the appointment of two boards
of trade, one at Shanghai and one at
Hankow, having jurisdiction over the
â¢whole south empire and the Yang-tse
valley, including Shan-si. Although
eeparate the two boards are enjoined to
â¢work in harmony. Shang Chi Lung,
Viceroy of Hankow, is responsible for
the reform, which, though of doubtful
ability, is important as showing that
the Dowager Empress has embarked
upon a policy having tendencies toward
reform.
SAYS THE EMPEROR'S
HEALTH IS GOOD
PEKING, Oct. 16.â Prince Ching on
V v -ilf of the Tsung Li Yamen, has
given Sir Claude Macdonald. the Brit
ish Minister, satisfactory assurances
as to the health of the Emperor.

EXPIRING GREENLAND'S ICY
MOUNTAINS.
Reuters correspondent at Copenhagen,
announcing the departure on the 20th
irÂ»st. of Lieutenant Amdrup's expedition
for East Greenland, writes as follows:
"The members of the expedition are
Lieutenant Amdrup, commander; M.
Krause, botanist and zoologist; M. Poul
sen. medical man and zoologist; Petty
Officer Jacobsen, and Naval Artificer 8.
Nielsen. The vessel used for the expedi
tion is the Godthaab, which has been
employed in the Greenland trade. The
expense. 150,000 kroner, will be defrayed
by the Carlsberger fund. The object of
the expedition is to explore that portion
of the east coast of Greenland situated
between 66 and 70 degrees north latitude.
This region has heretofore only been vis
ited by Esquimaux. The expedition goes
directly to Angmagsalik, whence it will
proceed in canoes as far north as possi
ble in order to establish a base of sup
plies. On returning from this voyage the
expedition, which takes out with it a
wooden house and three observatories,
will winter at Angmagsalik. In the course
of the winter it will make as many scien
tific Investigations as practicable. As
soon as the ice permits the explorers will
penetrate on sledges as far north as pos
sible. Kayaks, mainly constructed on
Nansen's system, are to be used. In
this expedition, however, only three mem
bers will take part. The others will re
main in winter quarters and pursue sci
entific investigations. Supplies for three
months will be taken for the sledge expe
dition, which will survey the coast. In
the summer the five explorers will set
out in canoes northward with threw
months' provisions in order to complete
the surveys.
In the autumn of 1899 they hope to be
back in Angmagsalik,' and to return
thence to Copenhagen. The expedition
is provisioned for two years.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 1 7, 189b.
NATIONAL PEACE
JUBILEE OPENED
Thanksgiving Service at
Chicago.
MR. M'KINLEY PARTICIPATES
NATION'S CHIEF RECEIVES AN
OVATION.
Listens to Addresses by Jewish Rab
bi, Catholic Priest, Presbyterian
Clergyman and Colored
Orator.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Oct. 16.â The National
Peace Jubilee of Chicago was to-night
inaugurated with a 'thanksgiving ser
vice at the Auditorium. President Mc-
Kinley attended and listened to ad
dresses by a Jewish rabbi, a Koman
Catholic priest, a Presbyterian clergy
man and a noted colored orator. The
applause for the President was tremen
dous, and at one time he was com
pelled to arise in his box and respond
to the frantic cheering of the audience.
The services were, however, of a reli
gious character and at times the sol
emn silence of the vast assemblage was
much more eloquent than could have
been the wildest applause.
The President rested during a great
part of the day at the residence of Cap
tain Lafayette McWilliams, his rela
tive, where he is being entertained. He
did not attend church in the morning.
For a short time in the afternoon he
was taken for a drive, in company with
Mrs. McKinley, Captain McWilliams
and Mrs. McWilliams.
The party was driven to the Audi
torium at 8 o'clock and all along the
way people lined the streets to watch
the passage of the President's carriage.
Easily 12,000 people were within the
great Auditorium and probably as many
more were on the outside, unable to
obtain admittance. The President was
seated in a box' on the left side of the
Auditorium and with him were Alex
ander H. Revell, President William
Harper of the University of Chicago,
Captain McWilliams and Secretaries
Porter and Cortellyou. Among the oc
cupants of the other boxes were James
McKinley, the President's nephew; Sec
retary Wilson and Miss Wilson, Secre
tary and Mrs. Gage, Secretary Bliss,
Assistant Secretary Meiklejohn and
Postmaster Jordan.
Rev. Dr. Henry W. Thomas, pastor of
the People's Church, was chairman of
the meeting. Bishop Samuel Fallows led
in the recital of the Lord's Prayer and
Rev. Dr. Jenkin Lloyd Jones in the re
sponsive reading.
The first addresses was by Rabbi
Emil G. Hirsch, who brought out a
great burst of enthusiasm by a refer
ence to President McKinley. Dr. Hirsch
said:
"We are proud that when war was
imminent, the affairs of the
were in the hand? of a man "
Here Dr. Hirsch's voice was drowned
by a great wave of applause. When he
could be heard, the speaker finished his
sentence:
"A true American, one that loves
peace, a worshipper of the Prince of
Peace."
Loud cheers followed Dr. Hirsch's
statement of his sentiments in refer
ence to territorial acquisition when he
said:
"Constitutionalism, not colonial de
pendence, must be the watchword of
the war in regard to the country's de
liverence from Spanish rule."
Rev. Dr. Thomas P. Hodnett. a
Catholic clergyman, caught the fancy
and applause of the audience by re
peated references to Dewey, Sampson.
Schley and the Rough Riders, and
when he mentioned President McKinlev
by name the people became so demon
strative that the President was com
pelled to arise in his box and bow his
acknowledgments. At the conclusion
of his address Dr. Hodnett aroused
much enthusiasm by a philippic against
the "growing influence of monoDOlv
and the cohesive power of unjust corpo
rations."
One of the most stirring speeches of
the evening was made by Rev. Dr.
John Henry Barrows, who took a firm
stand in favor of the retention of the
Philippines, which sentiment appeared
to meet entirely the appropation of tlu
audience.
Booker T Washington was the last
speaker. He said in part.
This country has been most fortunate
in her vietorU-.s. She has twice measured
arms with England and has won. She has
met the spirit of rebellion within her own
borders and was victorious. She has met
the proud Spaniard and he lies prostrate
at her feet. All this is well; it is mag
nificent. But there remains one other vic
tory for Americans to wmâ a victory as
far-reaching and important as any that
has. occurred to our navy and army. We
have succeeded in every conflict except in
that to conquer ourselves in the blotting
out of racial prejudices. We can cele
brate the era or peace in no more effectual
way than by a iirm resolve on the part
of the Northern men and the Southern
man, black men and white men, that
the trenches which we together vug
around Santiago shall be the eternal
buriul-pla.ee of all which separates
us in our business and civil relations. Let
us be as generous in peace as we have
been brave in buttle. Until we thus con
quer ourselves, I make no empty state
ment when I say we shall have, especially
in the Southern part of our country, a
cancer gnawing at the heart of this re
public that shall one day prove as dan
gerous as an attack from an army from
without or within.
i ii this presence and on this auspicous
occasion I want to present the deep grati
tude of nearly' ten millions of my people
to our wise, patient and brave chief ex
ecutive for the generous manner in which
my race has been recognized during tnls
conflict â a recognition that has done more
to blot out sectional and racial lines than
any event since the dawn of our freedom.
When Mr. Washington had given ex
pression to these words, the most inter
esting feature of the evening ucurred.
The audience arose and cheered to the
echo, while President McKlnley. stand
ing in his box, acknowledged by re
peated bows the compliment of the col
ored orator.
To-morrow, for the first part r >t the
day, the President ill be the puest of
the University of Chicago, from which
institution he will receive the degree of
LL.D.

PATHETIC LETTER

HOLDING OUT.
Defenders of the City Were Sick and
Wounded in the Trenches and
Had Only Rice for
Food.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, Oct. 16.â A copy of a docu
ment of considerable historical impor
tance in connection with the war In
Cuba was left In the hands of Dr. G. W.
Galbraith by General Shafter just be
fore the latter took his departure for
Chicago yesterday evening. It is a
copy of a letter sent to the Governor
in-Chief of Cuba and the Minister of
War at Madrid by General Linares, the
commander of the forces in Santiago.
It was written some two weeks before
the surrender of the city. It is as fol
lows, in full:
July 12, 189 S.
To the General in Chief, Havana. To
the Minister of War, Madrid:
Although prostrated in bed by an acute
illness and suffering severe pains, the
situation of our suffering troops so pre
occupies me that I believe it my duty to
address your Eminence and the Minister
<>!' \V;ir In order to explain the actual
situation. The enemy's Jlnes are very
near to this place. Our lines are extend
ed fourteen kilometers. A considerable
portion of our troops axe sick and emaci
ated, but do not enter the hospital be
cause it is necessary to have them in the
trenches; the animals have been without
forage, in the middle of a rain which has
fallen for twenty-four hours in the
ditches. The men remain permamently
in the trenches with nothing but rice to
eat and they cannot leave to change
their clothes. We have lost a consider
able number of field officers, dead, sick
and missing, which deprives the force o.f
the necessary directions in these critical
moments. In this condition It is Impos
sible to move a step, because when at
tempting to do so our forces will be
diminished by a third part that are not
able to leave, and furthermore by the
wounded that the enemy will produce.
The end will be disaster without ac
complishing, as your Eminence desires,
the salvation of the eleven battalions. In
order to leave protected by the division
of Holquin it is necessary that we break
the enemy's lines in combination. This
force-breaking Is on one side and cannot
be accomplished. The .force at Holguln
must employ eight days in the Journey
and bring numerous rations that they will
not be able to transport. The solution
seems inevitable, the surrender unavoida
ble, and we are only able to prolong the
agony.
The sacrifice is useless. The enemy
understands this, knows our situation
and his iines are well established around
our forts and without exposing his own.
As he oid yesterday, he is able to can
nonade from elevate^ places without our
seeing his batteries at all. The fleet now
h;is perfect range and can bombard the
city with mathematical precision, San
tiago de Cuba is not Hke Gerola. a walled
city, a piece of the territory of thÂ« me
tropolis, defended step by step by her
proper inhabitants without the distinc
tion of Â»ge or sex, exposing- their lives,
moved by the sainted Idea of Inde
pendence with the hope of a. succor
which they receive. Here we are alone
and Isolated. The citizens and the public
officials, with rare exceptions, are gone.
The clergy alone remain, and they to
day wish to leave with the Bishop at
their head.
The defenders do not now begin a cam
paign full of enthusiasm and energy.
They are exhausted by struggles with the
climate, privation and fatigue, and in
these critical circumstances have neither
food nor physical force nor friends to
help them. They are In a critical condi
tion. Tbey lark the spirit to defend their
property, because in defending this prop
erty they are abandoned to the American
force by those who were their allies. The
honor of ;m army has its limits, and I ap
peal to the judgment of the Government
or of the entire nation to decide if these
suffering troops that have been bombard
ed at repeated times since the 18th of
May. when they suffered the first
bombardment, shall be abandoned. If it
is necessary that this sacrifice be made
that we may go, I know not whither, or
if it is necessary that some one assume
the responsibility of foreseeing the dis
aster announced by me tn several tele
grams, I offer myself loyally on the altar
of my country to the one or the other,
and I will charge myself with tho order
to make the surrender, becauso my
modest reputation is worth very little in
comparison with the national interests.

BRUTALLY EJECTED
FROM A CAR
T. J.TUOHEY'S ENCOUNTER WITH
A CONDUCTOR.
He Was Refused a Transfer and Was
Then Thrown on che Cobble
stones.
Thomas J. Tuohey, a teamster residing
at 742 Willow avenue, was brutally thrown
from a Howard street car late last night
and severely injured.
He was riding on car 683 Just before the
accident occurred, with a friend named
Thomas Jolly. As the car neared Fourth
street Tuohey asked the conductor for a
transfer, which was refused on the score
that he had not asked for one sooner and
at the time the transfers were delivered
to other passengers. Upon being refused
he remonstrated with the conductor and
demanded of him the transfer which in
his pre-occupation he neglected to obtain.
After telling Tuohey he could have no
transfer the conductor proceeded to eject
him from the car. Jolly, seeing that a
quarrel was imminent, jumped from the
car. leaving his friend In a eonUsst of
words with the conductor. A moment
after, however, Tuohey was thrown head
long from the platform to the street,
where he sustained an abrasion of the
scalp. Several blood vessels in his head
were burst in the contusion.
The injured man wa3 taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where his wounds were
dressed. No action as yet has been taken
against the conductor, who will probably
be held to account for the accident.
CALLS HIS WIFE VAGRANT.
A. F. Sweeney Has His Better Half
Arrested.
Martha Sweeney, a young woman, was
arrested last night on a warrant charging
her with vagrancy. The complaining
witness Is A. F. Sweeney, her husband.
Sweeney clams that his wife recently left
him, and as she refuses to return to him,
he decided to hcxe her arrested.
After the woman had been formally
charged at the City Prison, Sweeney
anxiously Inquired as to the amount of
bail necessary for her release.
When told that the court had fixed the
amount at $150, Sweeney hesitatingly re
marked that he would endeavor to get
her out to-day.
"She has been a bad girl," dwlarsd
Sweeney, when asked why he had caused
his Wife's arrest. "Some time ago she
ran away from home and did not return
for several days. Only recently she again
left me, and as I learned she was asso
ciating with disreputable people, I con
cluded to have her arrested. I will see
the Judge who issued the warrant and
have him dismiss the charge against her.
My object in having her arrested was to
frighten her so she would not run away
again."
FATHER CALZIA ON BAPTISM.
Explains the Necessity of the Sacra
ment for the Welfare of the
Soul
The announcement made that Rev.
Father Calzia would preach on the sub
ject of "Baptism" at St. Ignatius' Church
last evening caused every pew to be oc
cupied. The Father used as a prelude
to his sermon an explanation of the in
stitution of the sacrament and its period
of existence In the Catholic church. He
said:
"'The church has always taught the ne
cessity of baptism, and the penalty for
him who disputes it has been excommuni
cation. The doctrine of Christ teaches it
as well as the Bible, for Christ has said:
'Unless a man be born again of water and
of the Holy Ghost, he shall not enter
the kingdom of Heaven.' Baptism is
taught in the Old Testament. The Jews
of old practiced circumcision and severe
penalties fell upon the head of the man
who allowed his male child to live for
eight days without being prepared for an
entrance into the synagogue.
"Baptism is simply a remission of the
punishment allotted to every soul that is
born into the world for the sins of our
first parents. Without this remission no
soul can enjoy spiritual bliss forever in
the world to come, and hence we see the
necessity of infantile baptism so that
death may not overtake the soul and de
prive it of its chances of seeing God.
Another reason why the church enforces
the baptism of infants is because of the
purity of their little souls; one must be
in the state of grace to receive the divine
sacrament and how much more stainless
is the soul and heart of the new-born
babe than the soul of the grown persons
who requires penance to wipe away its
burden of sin."
STATUE IN MEMORY
OF SAINT ANTHONY
UNVEILED WITH SOLEMNITY AT
THE FRENCH CHUBCH.
The History of the Universal and
General Custom of Extending
Special Patronage to This
Saint.
Immediately before the high mass at
the French Church on Bush street yester
day morning the magnificent new statue
of St. Anthony, lately erected in the sanc
tuary, was solemnly unveiled and conse
crated. The service of blessing consisted
in sprinkling with holy water. The re
sponses to the prayers were chanted by a
specially augmented choir, which gave to
the entire ceremony a fuller sense of sa
cred impressiveness.
The statue, which is about five feet in
height, was made in. Paris. It is the gift
of Mrs. de Guigne, the daughter of Mrs.
John Parrott.
Statues In honor of St. Anthony have
been erecetd lately in several Catholic
churches throughout the city. One simi
lar to that erected yesterday in the
French Church will shortly arrive from
the East for erection in the Paulist
Church (St. Mary's) on California street.
The object of this special devotion to
ward St. Anthony is interesting. The
statue is so built as to contain a recep
tacle for the presentation of alms, called
"St. Anthony's Bread." â¢
The devotee at the shrjne asks that a
certain favor be granted, and if done de
posits a coin, which is given to the poor.
The origin of this charity, the fame of
which is spreading rapidly throughout all
the world, is thus described:
One morning in November, 1592, Mile.
Bouf fler, a storekeeper of Toulon. France, I
found It impossible to open her shop door. The
l^ck Heemed broken, so ahe called in a lock
smith. After trying all his keys he gave up
In despair, saying there -was no resource but
to break open the door. "While the locksmith
went for some other tools, the shop keeper,
prayed fervently to St. Anthony that the door
might be opened without violence, promising,
if her request should be granted, to distribute
In his honor a certain number of loaves to the
poor. She then begged the locksmith to make,
another trial with hia keys, and ; taking one
at random, the door flgw open without further
difficulty. " â .Â«â ""â â  â â¢â¢" â¢â¢ "â¢ -..'-:
After this Simple evidence of " St. Anthony's
power his clients Increased so rapidly In Tou
lon that Mile. â  Bouf fler, with the assistance of.
her friends, founded a work of charity called
the "Bread of St. Anthony." In a room be
hind the shop they, placed a Btatue of the
saint, with a lamp burning before it, and un
der the lamp two boxes â one â to receive the
written requests and promises made to St.
Anthony, and the other money to buy bread for
the poor.
In time rumors of .the .wonders wrought by
St. Anthony at Toulon reached Paris, Lyons,
Bordeaux, Marseilles and other large towns,
and many chapels in those cities very soon
contained the two boxes for the offerings.
St. Anthony's bread is obtained in a simple
way. All a member of a congregation has to
do la to write a request on a piece of paper,
adding a promise if, by the expiration of a
given time, the saint secures the fulfillment of
6uch request,' a certain sum of money will be
placed in the collection box to buy bread for
the poor. These written requests may bÂ«
either of a spiritual or a temporal character.
The request may have reference to thÂ« writer
only, or to relatives, friends or even strangers.
When the favor is obtained the sum of money
promised is to be deposited in the box. This
money Is devoted to purchasing and distrib
uting "St. Anthony Bread."
"St. Anthony's Bread" comprises not only
food, but also clothing and medical attendance
â It includes, In fact, everything necessary for
the relief of the poor in general, and of the
Blck and afflicted poor in particular.
"WOMEN IN POLITICS."
Dr. J. L. York Delivers an Interest
ing Address at Scottish Hall.
Dr. J. Is. York addressed a large crowd
in Scottish Hall last night, his subject
being "Women In Politics." He said:
"What we need is a thorough education
in the duties of American citizenship and
the enlightenment of the masses on the
principles and purposes of our Govern
ment. The higher Idea of political re
sponsibility must be taught In our
schools and colleges. Men and women
should have equal voice in our govern
ment. Every boy and girl graduated from
the higher grades of our schools should
be thoroughly familiar with political econ
omy and imbued with a spirit of loyalty.
Politics and science of government should
form a part of our school education: The
Republican party is the one to which we
must look for our civil and religious
rights."
The speaker, at the conclusion of his
address, advised his hearers to vote the
straight Republican ticket at the ap
proaching election.

correspondent of the Daily Mail tele
graphing regarding the anarchist plot
against Emperor William which was
discovered on Friday, says:
"The plot against the Kaiser is hour
ly proving more important, each ar
rest disclosing new ramifications. The
documents found disclose a plot to kill
King Humbert already well matured.
"Fifteen persons, all Italians, have
been arrested. The original plan was
to throw a bomb of gun cotton and ful
minate of mercury on Emperor Wil
liam's carriage in a narrow street of
Cairo. When the Egyptian trip was
abandoned, elaborate arrangements
were made by the conspirators to send
confederates to Jerusalem to carry out
the plot during the dedication of the
German Church of Our Redeemer."
The Constantinople correspondent of
the Times says:
"Two wornout war craft, patched up
for the occasion, have proceeded to the
Dardanelles to swell the naval escort of
Emperor William, and twenty-four-
Turkish officers have gone thither on
board a yacht. Emperor William on
the Hohenzollern is expected to reach
the Dardanelles this afternoon and to
arrive at Pera, where the German lega
tion is situated, on Tuesday morning.
VISITED OLD COMBADES.
Grand Army Veterans and Ladies
Spend an Enjoyable Day at the
Yotintville Home.
Lincoln Post, G. A. R., and Lincoln Re
lief Corps yesterday made a'visit to the
Vetrans* Home at Yountville, where all
were welcomed by the old. soldiers who
find there a home of comfort In their de
clining years. About three hours were
devoted to visiting the various quarters
or buildings occupied by the veterans.
Colonel Walts, commandant of the home,
together with other officials, among
whom were Directors Sol Cahen and J. H.
3arrett, conducted the party. ;
The library was found to be well stock
ed with standard works. In the quarter
master's department there was mani
ested an air of business which commends
the administration of Colonel Lyon. A
marked improvement is seen in the con
duct of the hospital where trained nurses
are now employed. The kitchens and
31ning rooms are marvels of neatness,
while food of the best quality is carefully
prepared and served in generous quan
tities. 'â 'â 'â  _ . ._-
Department Commander Cahen had ar
ranged for a hot lunch with which the
lisitors were refreshed. At its conclu
sion remarks were ' made -by ' Commander
Cahen Mrs. Edith M. .Comstock, preÂ«*- ,
3ent of Lincoln Woman's Relief Corps;
Commander Handley of Lincoln Post. i
General Salomon of Garneld Post, and
Dthers. Commander Harry W.. Mortimer
presented a handsomely engrossed testi
monial to the association, which Presi
ient Loop received on behalf of the home.
At the conclusion of dinner the visitors
a.nd members of the home assembled on
the parade ground, where a new garrison
Bag was to be for the first time unfurled.
Mrs. Comstock and Mrs. Mortimer pulled
the halliards, and as Old Glory floated to
the breeze the band played "Star-span
gled Banner," while nearly a thousand
heads remained uncovered as General
Salomon delivered a brief address, which
was replete with sentiment of the most
ofty patriotism. Adjourning to the social
hall an hour was spent in entertaining
the old comrades with vocal and instru
mental, music, rendered by members of
the Woman's Relief Corps, after which,
amid cheers from the veterans, the vis
itors departed for this city.
Had Her Arm Broken.
Mrs. Marcella O'Loghlen, living at 1554
Golden Gate avenue, while "coastini;"
along Broderick street yesterday after
noon, fell off her bicycle and sustained
a broken arm and other injuries. She
wag removed to her home, where she was
treated by Dr. Shumate.

STEAM TONNAGE INCREASED
CONSIDERABLY GREATER THAN
A YEAR AGO.
Alaskan Trade Has Added Numerous
Vessels to the Merchantmen
Plying on the Pacific
Coast.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16.â Complete
returns received by Commissioner
Chamberlain of the Navigation Bu
reau of the Treasury Department show
that the dx-eumentecl American mer
chant shipping 011 June 30, 1898, com
prised 22,705 vessels of 4,747,738 gross
tons, compared with 22.63:} vessels of
4,769,020 tons on the like date in 1897.
The decrease of 19,282 tons is more ap
parent than real, as 11.000 tons of this
amount is due to dropping fractions of
tonnage in the accounts and 66,713 tons
: were sold to the Navy and War de
partments to carry troops, supplies and
provisions ajid have merely changed
employers.
The total steam tonnage amounts to j
6712 vessels of 2.371,923 tons, compared |
with 6599 vessels of 2,358.558 tons for the j
previous year. The vessels sold to the j
Government were all steam vessels, so I
. the true increase is greater than theflg- j
ures indicate. Sailing vessels have de- ;
creased from 1,904,153 tons for 1897 to '
1,835,827 tons for 1S&8. Documented ca- ;
nal boats and barges amount to 541, 958 ]
tons, compared with 506,309 tons for the ,
previous year. The increase is chiefly in ,
barges, which are superseding sail ves
sels, especially in the coal trade.
Tonnage on the Atlantic and Gulf (
coasts has decreased from 2,647,796 tons :
-:<7 to 2,553.739 tons for 1898. The i
Great Lakes tonnage shows a slight in- j
crease â 1.437,500 tons, as compared w Ith !
1.410,103 tons. The new Alaskan trade |
has increased the Pacific Coast marine j
from 439.012 tons to 496,7*7 tons. West
ern rivers have decreased from 272,109
to 261.732 tons.
New York Slat.- retains the first Dlace
with tonnage reduced from 1. 311. 743 to
1,299,825 tons; Michigan is 3tlll second,
ivtth a reduction from 477,602 to 463.100
tons, and Ohio stands third with 395.- :
us, an Increi â  of about 6000 j
tons. The greatest Increase Ls in Wash
ington, from 97.790 to 152. 16S tons; ard
Alaska, from 3524 to 9755 tons. X^v
England shows a large decrease and I
the Gulf States an appreciable increase, i
Vessels registered for foreign trade I
number 1136, of 737,709 tons, compared !
with 1230 of 805,584 tons for 1897. These
figures are the lowest since 1532. The
decrease is wholly in sailing vessels, of
which 159 of 103,000 tons, or about 20
per cent, have been lost, laid up or gone i
into domestic trade during the year.
Registered steam vessels have increas
ed from 220,136 tons to 245.059 tons.
Through the greater efficiency of steam
vccvlo f\^vt fi-ir the fareisn trade (
does dm show â¢ decrease in carrying
power.
The effect of the war is shown in the j
sale of e:~hty-fnur vessels of 36,411 tons 'â 
to foreigners compared with sales of i
8243 tons the oreviotu year. The sales
were chiefly d-e to high premiums on j
A .lerican vessels and cargoes demand- j
ed by insurance companies during the
brief while mines and torpedoes \
were being placed in our harbors. The '
effect of the war is also shown in the
admission by i.cts of Congress of 27,- |
824 tons of foreign vessels to American .
registry, chiefly for transport purposes. I
During' the preceding eight years only ;
55.902 tons were so admitted.

VAN ALSTINE BACK WITH
WIFE AND FORTUNE
Reconciliation of the Klondiker and
the Woman He Pursued Across
the Ocean.
NEW YORK. Oct. 16.-Back from
Europe Is Charles Van Alstine with his
fugitive "bride of the Klondike," and
thus a romance of the Yukon resumes its
joyous career. With his wife and for
tune recovered, after a chase across the
ocean, the miner arrived on the L'mbrla
and he is ready to continue the "swing
around the States' on which he originally
set out with his "pile" made in the Klon
dike. Van Alstine was astonished that
the public had heard of his affairs.
"My own affairs are my own business,"
paid he. "and I don'r Rpe how such thlnflfs
get out. I never talk about them to any
body and nobody knows anything about
them."
He admitted he had traced his wife to
London and that they were reunited. Be
yond this he said the published reports
were wrong. In the first place, he said,
she had not taken his money. It was at
one time supposed she had done so, but
this supposition proved lnco|rect.

UNCLE SAM ABLE TO CARE
FOR SICK SOLDIERS
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16.â The follow
ing letter from the Surgeon General of |
the army was written in reply to one j
sent to the President by A. E. Orr, J
vice chairman of the Red Cross re
lief committee:
I have received the copy of your letter
to the President. In answer to jour ques
tion as to "Why the intervention of the
Red Cross relief committee should be
lunger needed, and why the Government ,
does not see to it thai its own sick are
provided for," I would say:
The emergencies of the war made the
assistance of the relief associations most
valuable, notwithstanding the fact that
it is the Intention of the Government to |
provide liberally for the care of sick sol
diers. But, as" you know, with ample ;
means and good intentions supplies cannot
always be provided at the proper place
and time to meet an emergency. More- |
over, at the outset of the war the ar- j
rangernents made for providing light diet |
for the sick, which had proved satisfac- i
tory in time of peace under the careful j
management of experienced medical ofli- j
cc-rs, were inadequate under the condi-
Uons which prevailed in our camps of in
struction and among troops engaged in j
active operations. For this reason the
presence of Red Cross agents with their ,
abundance of supplies of delicacies for
the sick has been of inestimable value.
But provision was muck- by a general
order published August lv (G. O. 116) by
which surgeons in charge of hospitals,
general, division or regimental, are ena- j
bled to draw CO cents per day for each
Bick enlisted man of the army in lieu of '
his regular ration. Up to that time the j
commutation value of a ration was only :
30 cents.
The medical department does not supply j
food for the sick in hospitals. This is â 
obtained from the commissary depart
ment, or by purchase wherever it can be
procured. I inclose herewith a list show
ing the articles which can be purchased j
from the commissary, which list, as you
will see, includes canned soups, tapioca,
crackers. Jellies, tea, butter, etc. Milk,
chickens and egg*, fresh vegetables, etc., |
are purchased wherever they can be ob- j
tamed. The medical department furnishes I
a few articles under the head of "Hospi- I
tal Stores," including condensed milk, *
sugar and tea. but no other food supplies j
are furnished by the medical department I
or can be properly paid for from the med
ical and hospital appropriation. Of course, !
if the commissary department fails to j
provide these supplies, and they cannot :
be purchased in the vicinity of the camp i
or hospital, the difficulty of providing |
proper food for the sick will be very great j
and under such circumstances the sup- I
plies of relief associations have been most j
welcome. But the amount now allowed I
by the Government is ample to provide I
everything necessary in the way of suit- j
able diet for the sick, and when there ia |
any failure to provide this, it is failure in
administration by those Immediately in
charge and not a failure of the Govern- i
ment to provide the necessary means.
You will no doubt agree with me that !
60 c^nts a day for the raw material from
which to prepare a proper dielV for the i
sick is a most liberal provision. The ex- :
perlence of medical officers shows that it |
Is not only ample but excessive, and that '
for sick men, living for the most part I
upon milk, weak soups and farinaceous
food, this amount Is much in excess of ;
any reasonable requirement.
Under these circumstances, I think that i
those patriotic and liberal citizens who i
have contributed bo freely of their money '
and time to aid in the care of our sick ,
soldiers may now leave the matter In the .
hands of the Government without any !
apprehension as to the result.
ALGER WILL PROTECT
ALL THE WITNESSES
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16.â Secretary
Alger was asked to-night if it was the
purpose of the War Department to take
any official action concerning the state
ments made by Major Seaman, surgeon
of the First Volunteer Engineers.
"Not at all," replied the Secretary.
"Not at all. I want it to be understood
distinctly that any officer or man in the
army may speak freely and unreserved
ly concerning his observations of the
war without the slightest fear of pos
sible consequences. While I am Sec
retary of War no man shall be the suf
ferer for speaking what he believes to
be the truth. Above all, the witnesses
who appear before the War Investiga
tion Commission shall be protected to
the fullest extent. The commission and
the country want the facts and no ob
stacle shall be placed In the way of
getting them. We are all Interested in
having the clearest light thrown upon
the conduct of the war and the standing
or promotion of no enlisted men nor I
comandlng officer shall be affected in !
the slightest way by any testimony or |
other assistance he may give the com
mission. We mean to keep absolute
faith with the commission and with the j
witnesses. I cannot be more explicit
than that."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1898.
THREATEN TO REOPEN
THE INSURRECTION.
Special Cable to The Call and the New
York Herald. Copyrighted, IS9B, by-
James Gordon Bennett.-
HAVANA, Oct. 16.â As I have
already cabled last night a
serious breach exists between
the army and civil authori
ties. Strangely enough, President
Masso seems to favor annexa
tion. At least he prefers that to
the domination of the military
element. He has threatened that
the present insurgent govern
ment will make overtures for an
nexation. Masso has had agents
quietly working in Havana for
weeks, which fact General Gomez
learned about ten days ago. The
result is shown in the number of
men wearing the uniform of
Insurgent officers. They de
nounce the Masso government
and threaten the American
forces with reopening the in-
surrection should Masso's coun
sel prevail. These things are not
w"hispered. On the contrary they
are shouted upon the streets and
in cafes, while Spanish officeia
look on and laugh. The friends
of Gomez are trying to force
matters to an Immediate issue,
while Masso's agents are work
ing for delay. The latter believe
the United States will lend strong
moral influence against Cuban
militarism. They point to San
tiago as an illustration. They
say the people of Santiago now
have full confidence in the Amer
icans and are in favor of annexa
tion. Santiago province has al
ways been a stronghold of the
Cuban party, and so they argue
that the public sentiment in the
western provinces will soon
be overwhelmingly opposed to
Gomez.
chief quartermaster of the Second
Corps, has been ordered to Philadelphia
by Major General Graham to aid the
peace Jubilee commission in arranging
for the care of the troops to be sent
from Camp Moade. General Graham
has directed the three division comman
ders to select a battalion from each
reeiment In 'heir command to take part
in the jubilee procession, in addition to
the Eighth, Thirteenth, Fourteenth and
Fifteenth Pennsylvania Regiments. The
Ninth Ohio (colored) Battalion and the
signal and engineer corps companies
have also been ordered to Philadelphia
to participate in the festivities.
General Graham has ordered General
Young to proceed to Augusta; General
Otis to Summerville. S. C; General
Davis to Greenville, S. C; General Ran
dall to Athens, Ga., and Colonel Klrbv
of the Fourth Missouri to Spartans
burg, S. C, to establish camps for the
commands designated by the War De
partment in recent orders. These offi
cers will start from here to-morrow
with three members of their staff and
will return in time to accompany the
provisional division to Philadelphia.
Chief Quartermaster Howard has
been ordered to Augusta to establsh
corps headquarters.
General Graham has been directed by
Secretary Alger not to begin the move
ment south until hospitals have been
established In the proposed camps, and
there is no danger of an outbreak of
yellow fever. This order was received
to-day, and General Graham immedi
ately suspended preparations for the
movement, which was to have besrun
October 27. He says the Second Corps
will not be sent South until cold
weather sets in; that by the last of the
troops will hardly get away from here
before the middle of November.
Special orders were issued to-day
granting an honorable discharge to Ma
jor Jackson, chief sursreon at the Sec
ond Division Hospital, and detaling Ma
jor Joseph K. Weaver of Norristown as
his successor. Major Jackson has re
signed to accept the chair of surgery in
the University Medical College. Kan

Two hospital cars filled with sick sol
diers were sent awa-*' this afternoon.
The Invalids were taken to Philadelphia
hospitals, which are now caring for
over 700 sick of the Second Corps.
THE FORTY-SEVENTH
LANDS AT SAN JUAN
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16.â The follow- j
ing dispatch was received at the War
I Department this evening:
SAN JUAN, Oct. 16.â Adjutant General,
! Washington: The Forty-seventh New
i York arrived at San Juan 6 p. m.
EDDY. Colonel.
It Is presumed by the War Depart-
I ment officials, inasmuch as nothing is
i said to the contrary, that the regiment |
i was permitted to land at San Juan. It j
i was feared that objection might be ;
: raised by the Spanish officials to the i
i landing of the regiment at San Juan !
: before formal possession was acceded ;
Ito the American forces on the 18th ]
; inst. The Forty-aeventh New York has j
; ths honor of being the first American
I organization to enter the capital of
1 Porto Rico.
General Brooke, chairman of the
Porto Rican Evacuation Commission j
i and In command of the American troops j
! on the island, is making arrangements j
i for the accommodation of the Americaji i
1 forces to be stationed at San Juan. The
! barracks formerly occupied by the.
I Spanish soldiers were found to be to
tally unfit for occupation by United
States troops. General Brooke is hav
ing them remodeled, adding officers'

At Last the Plan of Every Fortifica

Turned Over to American
Commissioners.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA (via Key West), Oct. 16.â
That the condition of the Cubans is not
so desperate or black as is painted, out
side the fact that they are short of ra
tions, is confirmed by Colonel Kowan
and Lieutenant Parker, who, after
crossing the island five times, covering
one hundred miles and visiting every
insurgent camp in the island, report
that the men in the camps are efficient,
well disciplined and officered by men of
a high order of Intelligence and educa
tion. From these men, who have strug
gled and suffered for three long years
for their ideal of freedom, resistance is
to be feared to any solution of the prob
lem not having for its basis independ
ence.
Drs. Lane and O'Reilly have made a
i report to the surgeon general insisting
, on the immediate establishment of an
American fever hospital here. The ex
isting hospitals do not isolate yellow
fever patients, and the result is that if
a person suffering from another com
plaint is removed to the hospital he
runs the risk of contracting the fever.
: This was the case with Stenographer
Dalbey of the American Evacuation
Commission, who is suffering from ma
i larial fever. His next-door neighbor is
ill with a fever of a different character.
Colonel Clous has received a plan of
every fortification on the island, each
one signed personally by General
Blanco. These plans had been re
quested by our commissioners ever
since their arrival, but were not deliv
ered until yesterday.
The transportation commission has
! begun work upon the plans for the cx
i tension of the railroad to the camp at
\ Guanabacca, which will be the first to
be got ready. They have asked for bids
and laborers are being employed to
push the work actively.
Colonel Waring has found Havana
: dirtier than he anticipated. He says it
will be necessary to tear open the
streets and lay drainage pipes and sew
j ers. He sees no reason to fear an epi
demic, as there was no spread of dis
ease when the streets were opened re
: cently to lay water pipes. He is satls
i fled with the excellence of Havana's
'. water supply. Industry and commerce
: continue at a standstill.
Many planters and merchants who
i recently returned here, anticipating an
j early resumption of business, are going
i abroad again to wait until affairs are
settled in Cuba, as they do not dare to
, embark in business ventures or risk a
cent in the present unsatisfactory and
: Indefinite condition of political affairs
ion the island. In the meantime the
country daily grows poorer. The sugar
1 and tobacco crops are unsown.
ALL IS QUIET AT VIBJDEN.

SPRINGFIELD. 111., Oct. 16.â Colonel
Young of the First Illinois Cavalry, com

FLAHERTY'S CHALLENGE.
Disputes Tommy White's Right to
the 126-Pound Championship.
NEW YORK. Oct. 16.â Martin Flaherty,
the Lowell, Mass., featherweiÃht pugilist,
is out with a challenge to meet any man
in the world from 126 to 130 pounds,
Tommy White of Chicago preferred.
Flaherty's manager, Charles J. Har
vey of this city, says that his man dis
putes Tommy White's right to the 126
pound championship on the strength of
his defeat of Danny McÃride at Coney
Island two weoks ago. He says that
Flaherty has beaten McÃride twice ate
that weight and also won from Larry
Burns of Conors. With these victories,
as well as a decision over Frank Erne
and "draws" with Spike Sulivan and
Jack Downey, to his credit, Harvey
claims that White must meet the lad
from Lowell before the championship at
12G pounds can be positively decided.

AMERICAN NAVY
Long- Will Advocate an
Increase.
OFFICERS AND MEN NEEDED
SKELETON CREWS FOR SHIPS
NOT IN SERVICE.
Melville's Recommendation That New
Vessels Be Built in Classes Is
Approved by the
Secretary.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 16.â The Washlne
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: In his forthcoming annual re
port Secretary Long proposes to adopt
the recommendation of Captain A. S.
Crowninshield, chief of the Bureau of
Navigation, for an Increase of the force
of enlisted men. The Secretary also will
strongly urge the passage of the Roose
velt personnel bill, which will Increase
the number of engineer and line offi
cers to the number demanded by the
needs of the service.
It was reported yesterday that Com
modore Higginson, chief of the Light
house Board, had been instructed to
prepare recommendations as to the
naval policy which should be followed
by the United States. The Secretary
told me there was no truth in the re
port. The need of a recognized policy
Is appreciated by Mr. Long, and he has
been carefully reading papers dealing
with the policies of European govern
ments. It is expected that he will en
unciate such a policy for the United
States in his report.
Captain Crowninshleld's recommen
dation regarding enlisted men provides
that the number shall be increased to
20,000 men and 2500 apprentices.
Secretary Long proposes as soon as
the treaty of peace is ratified to lay
up some of the armored vessels In re
serve in order to reduce expenses.
When this Is done a skeleton crew will
have to be maintained on each shic
and to supply all of the vessels it will
be necessary to get authority from Con
gress to enlist more men.
Besides urging the passage of the per
sonnel bill, the Secretary proposes to
better the condition of the enlisted men
of the engineering branch of the ser
vice if it is possible to do so.
He will also approve the recommen
dation of Engineer-in-Chief Melville
that vessels be built in classes. The
engineer-in-chief believes that the
highest efficiency would be secured by
building our ships as far as possible in
classes and making them alike in every
particular, so that men trained on one
ship would feel equally at home and
be as efficient on five or six others of
the same class.

customs authorities seized the emblem,

are about to send it to Mare Island. Mal
<strom is corresponding with the crew of

Was Supposed.
DISCOVERY BY SURVEYORS
EXISTING CHARTS FOUND TO
BE IN ERROR.
Yukon's Mouth Further Westward
Than Heretofore Shown and
Land Area 2500 Square
Miles Greater.
Special Dispatch to The CaJl.
SEATTLE, Oct 16.â The United
States coast survey party under Cap
tain J. F. Pratt, which has returned to
Seattle on the guboat Y/heeling. after
having spent the summer in making
surveys of the mouth, or rather mouths,
of the Yukon, made the discovery that
Alaska is larger by 2500 square miJes
than was formerly supposed. The delta
of the river extends much further out
Into Bering Sea than Is shown on the
existing charts. Cantain Pratt, under
orders from the Treasury Department,
to-night will open offices in Seattle and
spend the winter here with several as
sistants in writing up the notes of the
expedition, and incidentally of former
surveys of the northwest coast. This
city will thus become the North Paci
fic C >ast headquarter- of the United
States Coast and Geodetic Survey. Cap
tain Pratt's party consisted of himself
and forty-two men and officers.
The survey has determined that one
of the mouths of the Yukon River â the
Kusilvac. or couth mouth â Is twenty
five miles further out, and the Aphson,
or north mouth, nine miles further out
in the ocean than is shown on the pres
ent charts. The extension of the mouth
of the river with that of the adjoining
coast makes Alaska 2500 square miles
larger than it was previously siiDDOsed
to be. The information will be of great
value to mariners frequenting that nart
of the Berin" Sea.
LIBERIA ASKS FOR
AMERICAN PROTECTION
Little African Republic Sends a Rep-
resentative to the Washing
ton Government.
PITTSBURG, Oct. 16.â Bishop Joseph
C. Hartsell of the Methodist Eptsconal
Church, whose bishopric is in Africa, and
who is attending the meeting of the Phi
Del Gammi fraternity in this city, stated
to-night that he had been commanded by
the negro republic of Liberia to go to
Washington and ask that the republic oe
taken under the sheltering wing of the
United States. Threatened inroads upon
its territory by the Germans, French and
English have prompted the Government to
seek the shadow of the stars and stripes.
"I am on my way to see Secretary
Hay," he said, "as the special representa
tive of the republic of Liberia to secure
a protectorate, either quasi or actual.
What they want America to do is to say
to the European powers in Africa, 'We
have an interest in Liberia; this country
belongs to us.' Whether an actual pro
tectorate can be established or not will
depend upon how far the Liberian Govern
ment is willing to go, assuming that the
United States answers favorably."

THE COMMERCIAL FIELD.
TRADE conditions are rather disappointing this
fall. The markets seem to lack life, and yet the
bank clearings of the country are 6 per cent
larger than at the same time last year, when busi
ness was reported. This paradox is a puzzle to the
mercantile community all over the United States.
If there were any decrease in the volume of trade the
bank clearings would certainly show it in reduced
totals, whereas they are larger. And yet it is the gen
eral consensus of opinion that business is not up to
what was expected along in the summer.
Theories as to this peculiar state of affairs are as
thick as leaves in Vallambrosa. One is the pro
tracted warm weather in the East, which has extended
into October, and which restricts the demand for
goods. Another is the absence of speculative spirit.
Still another is the recent threatened stringency in
the money market, but as this condition has passed
and the market has eased off again, it is not to be
entertained. Possibly the impending elections have
a good deal to do with it. for there is nothing that
will deaden trade quicker than an average election.
But. whatever the cause, business is undeniably quiet,
and this in the face of circumstances which ought to
produce activity in commerce. Money is easy and
plentiful, the balance of trade is vastly in favor of the
United States, gold is coming in from Europe, the
demand for wheat has lately been increasing with an
accompanying rise in the price, the crop outlook is
fine, the railway earnings are larger than at this time
last year, the country has just emerged from a suc
cessful foreign war, which has added to our territory
rich foreign possessions at a cost which certainly is
not large â and still trade is quiet. The oldest and
longest heads in the business do not understand it.
There is occasionally a comical side to trade, and
one of them has just been presented by the weekly
review of R. G. Dun & Co., which gravely accounts
for the apathetic condition of business by saying that
"there is a great change, and perhaps a permanent
one, in the percentage of profits derivable from the
trade and manufacture, as well as in the profits ob
tainable by transporters. Progressive civilization
calls for a lower range of profits and of prices as
the volume of business transacted increases in order
to make possible improvements in the condition of
the working millions."
Just how narrow margins of profits are to bestow
such important benefits on "progressive civilization"
is a problem worthy of the profoundest consideration
of the gods. It has hitherto been the general belief that
the more money everybody makes the better off
everybody is â but the world may have been in error
en this point.
The staples show no particular change from pre
vious conditions, aside from the improvement in
wheat already noted. Wool is still very dull, and
prices are 10 per cent below those of last winter, and
it is thought they must decline more yet before the
manufacturer can increase the output. Cotton rules
very dull and weak, at the lowest quotations for fifty
years. Leather is inactive, and so low in comparison
with the price of hides, that the leather trust is talk
ing about closing down a number of Eastern tan
neries, and this has a depressing effect on the hide
trade. The iron trade keeps up its fine record with
out difficulty, orders being heavy and the mills run
ning to full capacity to fill them. The failures for
the week were 205, against 223 in the same week of
last year, and most of them were unimportant.
Local conditions are about the same as previously
reported. There is a fair trade in general merchan
dise and quotations do not fluctuate much. Provi
sions have declined and the market is quoted dull.
Dried fruits, which are the important product at this
season of the year, are disappointingly quiet, there
being no Eastern demand of any consequence, and
several of the more prominent kinds, such as prunes
and peaches, have declined during the past fortnight.
Wine and grapes rule firm, and the latter are bring
ing good returns to the growers. Wool continues ut
terly neglected. Hops are firm and selling well at
satisfactory prices. The demand for canned fruit
has been good all the season -and quotations are
above the average of recent years. Grain continues
to move off fairly at profitable prices, though there
is no activity. The State on the whole is in sound
condition, and there are few complaints from any
quarter. Money is plentiful, and the bankers say
they have rather more than they can lend to advan
tage, which is by no means a bad sign. With a
good rainfall this winter California will come to the
front again next year in the old-time way, there be
ing no drawbacks in sight at the moment.
The arrest of a lot of anarchists charged with in
tent to kill the Kaiser is much more satisfactory now
than it would have been had they succeeded. There
is not universal admiration for the Kaiser, but no
reason has appeared why plotters against his life
should not be promptly hanged
MOGUIRE AND THE FUNDING BILL.
ON his return home, and frequently since, Judge
Maguire has referred to the amendment to
the general dehciency bill, by which the debt
of the Central Pacilic Railroad to the Government is
finally disposed of.
He attacked his colleagues, Loud and Barham,
on that subject, and said that but for them the fund
ing amendment would have been beaten in the
House.
In the speeches and interviews of Loud and Bar
ham the facts as to the origin and passage of the
funding amendment have come to light, and they re
veal a curious and interesting history.
It was prepared by Senators Morgan and White,
and was intended by those gentlemen to be a Con
gressional finality upon that subject. In its prepara
tion these Senators held conferences, at which Cali
fornia members of the House were present. White
and Morgan sought and had conferences with Judge
Maguire on the amendment, and neither they nor his
colleagues in the House had from him any other im
pression than that he agreed with White and Mor
gan. The amendment originally extended the ma
turity of the debt for twenty years. To answer some
scruples on the part of Senators, White reduced this
to ten years. When it had been perfected by White
and Morgan in these conferences, it was turned over
to Senator Gear of lowa, chairman of the Committee
on the Pacific Roads, and was by him offered as an
amendment to the general deficiency bill. Now, un
der the rules of the Senate and House, no general
legislation can go as a rider on an appropriation bill
if any one member object to it. This amendment was
general legislation. A single objection in either
House would kill it. When it was offered by Gear
Senator Hale of Maine objected. That would kill it.
Senator White rose and said: "Mr. President, I
hope the Senator will withdraw his point of order,
for I can assure him that there will be no objection
made to it (the amendment), and that there will be
no debate upon it."
Senator Hale replied: "IF THE SENATOR
FROM CALIFORNIA WHO HAS IN DAYS
GONE BY OPPOSED MEASURES SIMILAR
IN CHARACTER TO THIS AMENDMENT AS
SURES ME THERE WILL BE NO OBJEC
TION AND NO DEBATE I WILL WITHDRAW
THE POINT OF ORDER," and it was withdrawn,
and the amendment was adopted by the unanimous
vote of the Senate. â¢
When the bill went to the House with this
amendment as part of it, Mr. Barham, who was op
posed to it on the ground of insufficient protection
to the Government, proposed an amendment to it,
which thoroughly protected every equity of the
United States. This raised the whole subject origin
ally in the House. It was again where a single ob
jection would kill it forever. Maguire made a long
speech against the amendment. He began that
speech by saying: "The incorporation of this Paci
fic railroad amendment in the general deficiency bill
is one of the most extraordinary proceedings within
my recollection or knowledge of Congressional ac
tion. Here is a measure delegating to a commission
of three public officers power and authority to do,
with respect to the Central and Western Pacific
roads, what the Congress of the United States upon
full debate and full consideration has twice by over
whelming majorities refused to do. It is brought up
for consideration in the House of Representatives as
part of a bill in which it could not have been incor
porated originally under the rules of the House, al
though the fact that it was made part of the bill by
the Senate makes it, by courtesy, superior to objec
tion at the present time."
This was not a truthful statement. It was artfully
inserted to make it appear that he could not stop
the bill by objection. Everything in the two houses
of Congress goes by rule, and not by courtesy. An
appropriation bill containing general legislation can
be stopped in either House, after passing the other,
by the single objection which Maguire could have
made, and did'not.
Continuing his speech, he entered upon a general
discussion of the history of the Central Pacific road,
in which he charged Stanford, Huntington, Crocker
and Hopkins with "gigantic frauds," and said:
"There is a principle in equity, as between man and
man, under which trustees who have fraudulently
diverted assets upon which the lien of a creditor
rests can be compelled to disgorge all money and
property and the proceeds of all property fraudulently
taken from the trust fund or trust estate through
contracts made with themselves, by which, without
right, without justice, without substantial claim,
they have enriched themselves at the expense of their
beneficiaries." He then charged that Stanford, Hun
tington and Crocker had fraudulently diverted to
themselves $80,000,000, and continued: "Whether
the Central Pacific road shall or shall not pay its
debt to the Government will be determined only upon
the sale of its present property under foreclosure. If
the foreclosure sale shall fail to produce an amount
sufficient to pay the claim of the Government, I have
no hesitation in saying that the Government has a
right of action against the living directors and
against the property left by the dead. In this discus
sion of a former funding bill it was suggested that as
Senator Stanford had devoted his fortune, however
acquired, to a quasi-public use in the establishment
of a university in California, it would be against pub
lic policy to disturb it. There is force in the sugges
tion, but it has no relevancy in a funding bill. What
Congress should do if in the collection of its
claims the Stanford University were likely to be
crippled or closed, I am not prepared to say. This
fight of the Government, now hardly subject to ques
tion, will be waived and lost forever by refunding,
because it is collateral to the claims of the Govern
ment as they now exist, and will not attach to the new
obligations created by refunding."
Here, then, we had a charge of fraud against Hun
tington, Crocker, Hopkins and Stanford. The charge
that the endowment of Stanford University was the
fruit of crime and fraud committed by Stanford. And
the charge that the Government would under the
White-Morgan amendment lose its right to seize the
Stanford University. At that point Mr. Barham of
fered his amendment to the funding amendment re
serving to the Government these equities, claims and
the right to seize Stanford University, and making
all these claims, based on Maguire's charge that
Stanford was guilty of fraud, collateral to the new
claims of the Government to be created by the White-
Morgan amendment. This was adopted by the
House, by Maguire's assent, when his objection
would have killed it, and the bill then passed, when
his objection would have killed it. The question of
the stability of Stanford University is again put in
the air by Maguire's charge that it is the fruit of
fraud, though he forgot to mention that to the Stan
ford students.
Now, to retrace a little. In the Democratic platform
the acts of Senator White are indorsed. In the Dem
ocratic convention Senator White seconded Ma
guire's nomination. Yet Magui- 1 is touring the
State asking Republicans to vote for him because
Congress passed this funding amendment, of which
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1898.
White was a joint author and for which he voted in
the Senate!
These are the cold facts, and if their existence is
consistent with Maguire's honesty or with the sincerity
of the parties which are supporting him, the old ideas
of honesty and sincerity must be revised.
WrifH" DOES THIS MEON ?
REPORTS of the proceedings of the recent
Democratic State Convention in New York
have roused the Louisville Courier-Journal to
a double-leaded, double-columned editorial almost
hysterical in its earnestness. The convention, says
the Courier-Journal, made its greatest demonstration
upon the mention of the name of William Jennings
Bryan, and yet refused to listen to the Chicago plat
form. "It rejected free silver by an overwhelming
majority. What does this mean?"
The Courier-Journal proceeds to say that the ap
plause of Bryan and the rejection of free silver
"means several things"; an assertion sufficiently as
tonishing, for on the face of the showing it appears
such self-evident contradictions could mean nothing
beyond the fact that Democrats are doing politics
this fall in a very meaningless way. However, the
Kentucky authority goes on to say:
"It means that sensible Democrats want to win
actual battles instead of sacrificing the party and
themselves upon the altars of a barren ideality. It
means that national Democratic victories can be won
only on Democratic lines." Then it goes on to add:
"To do this it must fly a banner bearing no such
illusory motto as 'Free silver at the ratio of 16 to I,'
and that other snare, dear alone to extremists and im
practicables, 'Down with government by injunction,'
but carrying upon its ample folds as it floats over a
restored Democracy these inspiring words, 'The le
gions of Jefferson and Jackson against the janizaries
of McKinley, Alger and Hanna!' "
Admitting that a banner with such an inscrip
tion would be inspiring, we fear it would itself re
quire an explanation. The country would continue
to ask, '.'What does this mean?" It would be easier for
the average man to decide what the New York
Democrats meant by shouting for Bryan while howl
ing down his platform than to guess at what the pro
posed war cry signifies.
Fortunately, the Courier-Journal goes on to ex
plain its explanation. It says there is but one man
who can save Democracy in 1900; that man is
Bryan. There is but one way in which Mr. Bryan
can save Democracy; that is by declining to run for
the Presidency.
The Courier-Journal reminds Mr. Bryan that he is
not now the captivating figure he was when he was a
novelty. As it says, in its beautiful, mellow, Ken
tucky style: "The bloom is worn away, the romance
of adventure and the beauty of youth quite van
ished. The time may come, indeed, when, sitting
among the ruins of his party and surveying the
wreck of his own ambition?;, this honest and ardent
gentleman may, if he wantonly pursues the ignis
fatuus of the White House, have reason to lament his
mistake, and in bitterness of grief exclaim â
â 'the tender grace of a day that is dead
Will never come back to me.' "
So the Kentucky guardian of pure Democracy
would have Mr. Bryan retire from the field. It as
sures him that if he cannot be President he can be a
maker of Presidents, and says: "The name of
Warwick echoes down the ages, whilst the pigmies
of York and of Lancaster, whom Warwick made and
unmade, are forgotten." It holds out to the boy
orator this high hope: "He may be the founder of a
new Democratic dynasty, taking up the line in 1901,
as Jefferson took it up in 1801, and conducting the
country through another century of constitutional
government and national development and glory un
der Democratic leadership."
And once more the country asks, "What does this
mean?"
rOR the office of City and County Surveyor the
Republicans have renominated the incumbent,
Charles S. Tilton, thereby giving the people an
opportunity to retain in office one' of the best officials
San Francisco has ever had. Of this opportunity
men who desire an efficient administration of the
Surveyor's office will avail themselves without re
gard to party lines, although Mr. Tilton's stanch Re
publicanism will be another argument why all loyal
members of that party should not only vote for him
but work for him.
Mr. Tilton came to San Francisco in his boyhood
and was educated at our public schools, graduating
from the High School. He served for a long period
as a clerk in the office of the City and County Sur
veyor, and was for a considerable time chief deputy
of the office before he became a candidate for elec
tion. He had thus made himself perfectly familiar
with the duties of the position before he aspired to
fill it, and as a consequence from the very beginning
his administration was one of complete success in
every respect.
At the present time Mr. Tilton knows every line
of our city and county survey by heart. No other
man could attend to the duties of the office with half
his efficiency, no matter how earnestly he might at
tempt it, for no other has that thorough knowledge
of the subject which Mr. Tilton possesses.
It will be recognized by all intelligent citizens that
this special store of information concerning the work
required of the incumbent of the office is a matter of
prime importance to the Surveyor. It is also of im
portance to the community. Bungling work, whether
due to carelessness, incompetence or ignorance,
would cost the city dearly in the Surveyor's office.
During the long time in which Mr. Tilton has
been identified with the work of the city "and county
surveys there has never been a scandal connected with
his name or his acts. He has not only been capable
of good work, but he has been faithful in the per
formance of it. He is known to the people. They
have seen him tested in private and in public life, and
they know him to be thoroughly reliable. In times
past the community has shown its confidence in him
by repeated re-elections, and it cannot be doubted the
same confidence will be displayed again in the
same way this year.
F. K. Lane announced in a political speech that he
believed in bosses, a circumstance making his posi
tion so clear that he did not need to take the trouble
to effusively indorse Phelan.
The trial of the Neads, husband and wife, has dem
onstrated so far that there are a lot of courtroom
loafers almost as objectionable as the pair will be
even if proved guilty.
It is too bad that Dr. Ragan should once more
have directed attention to the fact that there is some
thing rotten in the School Board, and that he is in
the midst of it.
"Are you for honesty or corruption?" asks the Ex
aminer. As the public seems to be opposing all the
Examiner advocates, it may properly answer that it
is for honesty.
CHARLES S. TILTON.
DAY BY DAY IN MANILA.
A Visitor Makes a Fruitless Search for Filipina
Beauties He Had Read of.
THE CALL'S Washington correspondent, C. C. Carlton, journeyed to Manila
via the Suez Canal, and below are given his observations concerning the islands
and the people, with especial reference to the city of Manila.
Time was when circumnavigation of the globe was considered a remark
able if not marvelous accomplishment, and the returned voyager felt
justified in printing a magazine story of his travels, invariably introduced
by that hackneyed Shakespearean quotation, "I'll put a girdle round the
earth," but in these days of fast-stoaming by land and sea such a trip is by
no means uncommon. Therefore I shall not attempt a letter descriptive of
scenery, etc., but will devote my attention to the Philippines and the man-
and customs of the peoples
â vho inhabit them.
I Six weeks out of New York and
one American flag visible, save
Bine which floated from the consul-
R.te in Paris.
I We longed for a sight of the flag
Rr something that was genuinely
Knrl truly American. On the morn-
Hngof September 1 we sighted Hong
â iong and soon were steaming up
â he harbor.
I From the Englishmen who crowded
â he decks of the vessel (for this was
Rin English ship) suddenly came an
Reclamation of delight, "There they
R.r^! There are our good friends,
Hhe Yankees!" And behold! riding
Rt anchor, gracefully, were the
Rlympia, Raleigh and' Concord, with
Rt;irry flags fluttering from their
â peaks! It sent a thrill through
R>very fiber when we few Americans
Riewed for the flrst time these naval
Rieroesâ our own men-of-war, with
Rur own naval officers on the decks,
us welcome!
And those Englishmen on our ship! England may be a mercenary na
tion; she may have seliish ends to subserve in extending the glad nana 10
America, but if I ever saw genuine pleasure expressed in a countenance it
was portrayed in the animated faces of our English fellow-passengers when
they beheld the warships of their allies and cousins.
And now for Manila! By the courtesy of Consul General Wildman, Cap
tain J. B. Coghlan and the Raleigh's officers I was provided transportation
to Manila. We left the next day, and on the third day out sighted the
island of Luzon, a long line of hazy, purple mountains. Somehow or other
it seemed like home, or a glimpse of home, for these were our own, our
very own, islands, or soon would be.
In the evening we approached Corrigedor Island. Then rose the moon,
and laid on the placid sea a path of silvery light.
Not a sound was audible, save the throbbing of the Raleigh's engines
and the soft swish of the sea against her sides. Every man aboard the
Raleigh was in a reverie. They recalled that night in May when they
steamed silently through the channel; when not a man of them knew what
the morrow would bring forth, or whether indeed there would be another
sunrise lor tnem.
"How did you all feel?" I asked. The stillness of the night was broken
by a laugh from the Raleigh's officers.
"Our thoughts alternated between home, far away, and the Spaniards
bo near us," said one. "But not much time for reflection, for soon sparks
from the McCulloch's funnel betrayed our presence and then the fun
began."
It was something of a treat to hear the story of this naval battle re
lated by the Raleigh's officers as we steamed into Manila Bay. As we ap
proached Mania Admiral Dewey^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
signaled for us to come aloner^ide.B
and then to steam to Cavite at sun-H

I took a hammer and wrenr
and knocked oft* a few bolts an
nuts from the Castilla to brin
home as trophies. We crossed atrai
to Manila on a ferry boat ownec
and manned by Filipinos. Thes
were the first natives I had seen
certainly an unprepossessing lot t
men and women crowded togethe
"Perhaps these are not fair types o
th.- Filipinos." I thought but the
were. All Filipinos looked alike t
me, and indeed, they were alik
in facial and all physical character
istics, in manner and dress. I never saw people who looked more alike than
they, unless it he the Chinese. The male Filipino is below the average in
stature, sturdily but not grossly built, with skin darker than a Chinaman's,
of about the complexion of a Japanese. Their short clipped hair, too, was
very black, very bristly and stood on end, pompadour fashion. The Fil
ipinos' eyea do not giant Hut for this one might believe they were descend
ants of the Japs instead of the Malays, albeit the old fellows among them
speak the latter tongue as perfectly as Spanish.
I longed for a sight of those picturesque Filipina beauties that I had
read about. The papers and magazines had represented them as charm
ing, dusky damsels.
"They have a manner of walking on the forward part, cr ball of their
feet," said one story, " and this imparts to the body a graceful motion and
a most bewitching swing of the haunches."
I traveled through the streets of Manila for nine days, eagerly looking
for a female "type" that I might describe to my friends at home. Not one.
All as upiy as sin. I am ready to believe that the graceful and attractive
Filiplna is like the beautiful Indian maiden, who since tl.e death of Poca
hontas, is nowhere to be found out of Fenimore Cooper's novels. The Fili
pino girls wear a costume that is especially adapted for that climate. Those
who can afford it dross in thin, gauzy stuff, a diaphanous and iridescent
fabric woven from j=ilk and a mixture of the pineapple leaf. It is called
jusi, and yet another fabric is known as "Pinta cloth." The Filipina girls
WÂ«ar their thick, black, glossy hair, done up in rolls, much like the Chinese
and Japanese women. On their fe<Â»t are wooden slippers which click, click,
click on the flagstones as they* trio along the street, sometimes with a basket
of something balanced on their heads, and again with a huge Manila cigar
between their lips, stained red with betel nut.
Two Filipina girls meet on the street, both bareheaded, as Filinlna girls
invariably are. One is puffing a big cigar. Girl number one says some
thing in Spanish to the other, who immediately removes the cigar from her
mouth, spits a stream of betel nut juice from between her lips, and hands
the cigar to her friend.
If I had been nei.r enough (and knew enough Spanish), doubtless I
should have heard this dialogue: "Senorita. give me a light, will you; how
is business? Are you going to take in the cock fight this evening?"
FÂ«>r chicken-fighting, as everybody must know, has until recently been
the national sport of the Filipinos. At the Oriental Hotel I was endeavoring
to inquire, in the best Spanish I
could command, where and when I
could see a cock-fight.
"Guerrer gallo â guerrer gallo.
Donde? y cuando?" I asked.
A mite of a Filipina girl (about
20 years old or so, I should say)
tripped up smilingly and offered to
escort me to a coek-flght if I would
pay the way. I surveyed her care
fully and concluded that I didn't
care to see a cock-fight But I said
to her: "After a while; must go up
town now." Would you believe it?
"When I got back, three hours later,
the Filipina girl was waiting for
me. I told her I had learned uptown
that cock-fights had been prohibited
(which was the truth), and then
purchased my release by paying her
a peseta. And now of the town it
iJust a rambling, ramshackly old
ace, with one (and sometimes two)
oried houses, built of wood, with
d tile roofs. Frequently the en
re upper story of the dwelling
juses is a sort of bay window,
hat is to say, they would be bow
windows if they were not square. But they are, like those you have in
Pan Francisco. These windows extend across the entire front and are pro
vided with sliding shutters. Frequently these small wooden dwelling-houses
are vine-clad. There are trellises of morning gl<-riesâ delicate tints of pink
and blueâ and hollyhocks, too, on either side of the door. And what flowers
(except old-fashioned rpses, celebrated in verse by our Hoosier poet, James
Whitcomb Riley) are sweeter and wholesomer than morning glories? In
the yards I saw flaming red blossoms of the pomegranate â and pepper trees
â and palms. These flowers, plants and shrubs do much to redeem Manila
and render life tolerable if not pleasant to the visitor.
Manila is not a compactly built town. These little houses are separated,
and, in some parts erf town, isolated, one from the other; but this is in
the outlying districts, where, too, may be seen many houses constructed of
bamboo, thatched with palm or palmetto leaves. The "streets" of Manila's
outlying districts are nothing more than country lanes, bordered by palm
trees, pepper trees and pomeKranate, with here and there, in the grass, a pro
fusion of tiny pink and blue blossoms. In the outlying districts you have
fresher air, the flowers breathe a sweet perfume; but in Manila proper â that
is to say in the heart erf "Binondo," or in the "Intra-Mura" â one's nostrils are
greeted with all sorts of noisome whiffs â the most offensive Bmells that ever
offended a man's nose.
The suits of white worn s by the Filipinos brig-hten the streets, which or
dinarily are somber enough, for they are patrolled by our poorly olad private
soldiersâ who act as policemen. Through the War Department's neglect or poor
administration they are clothed only inblue woolen shirts, woolen trousers,
coarse, heavy shoes and dilapidated broad-brimmed felt hats. "I am surprised,"
said an officer of the British Artillery who came over on the Raleigh especially to
see our soldiers, "that your Government should have provided her soldiers with a
dress so inappropriate to the torrid climate of Manila." So thought we all. and
wondered, too, why the poor fellows should be short of food (living on half ra
tions almost) when the holds, of transport steamers and the docks were loaded
down with boxes of provisions. a on d it
I saw but one line of streetc r ana Â«

more of them), and the motive PowÂ«'^
a poor, spavined, wind-broken old jade or
a horse. My car was stalled three times
in one block, so I.got off anclwalked.

American enterprise soon set up several
drinking saloons. The "PlonÂ«er,* the
"Alhambra" and the -Palace" are places
frequented by our soldiers and citizens.
Curiously enough our own silver money
of the same weight and fineness as the
Spanish or Filipino money was w0
twice as much, and even the natives "were
becoming to appreciate tills fact.
There are four or five "palaces m
Manila. In the San Miguel district, a con
siderable distance from Binondo, is Ma.!?
canan Palace, and near it is the admiral s
palace. These, like the other palaces, are
handsomely furnished. Malacanan is the
headquarters and dwelling place of the

A Prediction Which Is
Nearly Fulfilled.
CHINATOWN TO BE CLEANSED
THAT NEIGHBORHOOD WILL BE
IMPROVED.
Review of the Difficult Work of Clos
ing Objectionable Streets and
How It Was Accom
plished.
"Within ten years from the time we
took possession of St. Mary's Church, we
feel assured that the entire character of
the surrounding neighborhood will be
changed from that condition of loathsome
_ioral disease and corruption which has
bo long identified it, to a condition of pur
ity and an atmosphere of health."
Such was the expression of the Rev.
Father Otis of the Paulist community re
cently In discussing the suppression of the
houses of ill-fame which thrive in the ad
joining streets to the church and, in fact,
in front of the very entrance to the edi
fice.
It is generally known that that portion
of the city immediately surrounding St.
Mary's Church, before the advent of the
Paulist missionaries, was the home of all
kinds of vice. For years every possible
effort was made and wasted, it was
thought, in attempting to close these ob
jectionable streets. Influence was brought
to bear and adjacent property holders j
combined to suppress the evil, but met
with no better success than that, won
by Individual effort. The hope of ever j
accomplishing the object contemplated ;
was finally abandoned. i
Three years ago the Paulist missionaries
arrived in the city and took charge of the >
church, which was actually falling into
decay. It was remodeled and adorned and
an immense congregation attracted to it.
The scheme of bettering the surroundings,
although never discussed, was pursued
faithfully. Nothing was known of the
work of "the priests until the final climax
of ousting the denizens and closing their
brothels became an accomplished fact.
Father Otis, who is and has been the
prime mover and successful worker in
the enterprise, maintained recently that
the priests of the community are not
peeking the honor of the work, but its ef
fect.
The work of improving the immediate
surrounding? will not be confined to the
success already won. Chinatown is also
included in the section to be bettered,
and already has shown some signs of
losing its once powerful sway.
"If you are desirous of seeing an Im
provement or anxious to be presented
with an ocular exemplification of what
we claim, " said Father Otis, "pass
through Chinatown and see the number |
t f to let' signs in front of the various :
buildings. The Chinamen are not as
wealthy as they were formerly, and
scores of them are returning to China on
nearly every outgoing steamer. We don't
say that we are sending them, but they
are going, and our prediction is being
realized more fully as time passes.
"Hefore the ten years elapse we are
confident our church will be so surround
t (1 that none will fear to come to It and
all will look upon its environments with
pride."

MAD RIDE TO THE HOSPITAL
A Patrol Wagon Overturned in an Effort to Save a
Man Who Wished to Die.
WHILE taking a dying man to the
harbor hospital about 2 o'clock
yesterday afternoon, the patrol
wagon from the California-street
police station was overturned at the foot
of California street and Officers Silver
and Livingston were thrown violently to
the ground, the latter sustaining a frac
ture of the wrist. Patsy Stevens, the
driver, was hurled from his seat, but re
tamed his hold on the reins, and after
being dragged some distance brought his
horses to a standstill. Charles Lewis,
the prospective patient, who was under
the influence of morphine poisoning, was
the only pasenger on the hurry-up wagon,
and he was not thrown to the ground.
Shortly after 1 o'clock Lewis entered
the police station and irrforme'd Sergeant
Christensen that he had taken 50 cents'
worth of morphine. The sergeant doubt
ed his statement, but to make sure took
a tablet Lewis gave him to a druggist,
who pronounced it morphine. On his re
turn to the station the sergeant found
that the man had collapsed, so he order-

Major General Otis occupies the city of
Manila, The forces designated for the
transport Senator will go aboard of that
vessel about noon to-day. Those for the
Valencia will in all probability get aboard
that vessel to-morrow. The Third Bat
talion of the Twenty-third Infantry, the
recruits of the Second Oregon Regiment
and a hundred men from the California
Heavy Artillery are the troops that go
aboard to-day. The exact hour of their
departure from the Presidio is not
known. General Miller stated yesterday
that they would leave just as soon as
their tents were dry enough to be packed.
The tents became so thorougnly
saturated with the dew at nights that
if they were parked while damp and
then stored away in the hold of
the transport for a month they would
become mildewed and utterly unfit tot
use. If the day is bright and clear the
tents will be dry by 10 o'clock. It is
hardly possible that camp will be broken
before 10 o'clock, and in all probability it
will be an hour later before the soldiers
march away.
Privates Harrison \V. Bullock, Com
pany C, and James W. Phillips, Company
I First New York Regiment, returned
on the Pennsylvania from Honolulu
undÂ«r a guard. The men were sent here
by General King as being Insane. Ser
geant John Grant was in charge of the
men with a guard. The two unfortunate
soldiers were taken to the post hospital,
where they will be kept for the present
rending the decision of the War Depart

Major Edward Field. Second Artillery,
who has been weeding out the undesir

stated yesterday that the men who were
to be thrown out of the service would be
discharged upon the grounds of physical
disability and general unfitness and that
the married men of the regiment in some
cases would also be discharged. Ma or

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, MONDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1898.
Ed Officers Livingston and Silver to take
him to the hospital and gave Driver
Stevens instructions to make the trip as
quickly as possible. The horses were
pent down California street at a lively
gait by Stevens, who hoped to get the
man to a doctor before he died. At
the foot of the street one of the horses
shied, throwing the wagon into a rut.
"The next thing I knew, 11 said Stevens,
"I was bumping along on the cobble
stones with the wagon threatening to
strike me each moment. I knew If I let
go the reins I would get It worse than
ever, so I held on and finally stopped the
horses."
The wagon was righted as quickly as
possible after the accident and the trip to
the hospital continued with one patient
added to the original number. Living
ston's broken bone was set and a
stomach pump relieved Lewis of his sur
plus morphine, after which the officer
was sent to his home and the would-be
suicide was locked up for drunkenness.
Patsy Stevens has been driving a
wagon* for the police department for the
past four years and has the reputation of
being a careful whip. The accident yes
terday Ik the first one with which he has
been connected and is much regretted
by him. No one who witnessed the over
turning of the wagon places any blame
on him. The bituminous paving at the
foot of California street is badly cut up
by the heavy travel there, and the horse
shying just at this place, added to the
fact that the wagon was being driven
rapidly, according to orders, explains the
case fully.
Lewis gave the following explanation
of his attempt to end his life: "I robbed
a house of $35 in San Pedro," said he,
"and got away to Fresno. I knew the
police were after men and that it would be
only a short time before I was caught, so
I took the poison to fool them."

will not be much in excess of 1000 men.
General Miller yesterday Issued an
order assigning five privates of the
Twenty-third Infantry, in whose cases
applications for discharge have been ap
proved, to the Wyoming Light Battery.
Their time is nearly up and they will in
consequence be left behind to complete
their service with the Wyoming battery.
It has been about decided to send the
Wyoming battery to Angel Island for
garrison duty. It will go to that post just
as somx as the Second Battalion of the
Washington Regiment leaves.
In the case of Private Farrell of the
Second Washington recruits, who has
been serving a short sentence in the Pre
sidio guard house for some minor of
fense, General Miller yesterday issued an
order remitting that portion of the sen

and ordering him to report to his com

In addition to the two insane men from
the New York Regiment, who came here
on the Pennsylvania three other sick

taken to the post hospital yesterday.
They were Clement Atkins, Company I

REV. FREEMAN'S LAST WISH
SICK SOLDIERS FROM MANILA
AND HONOLULU.
Arrival of the United States Trans
ports Zealandia and Pennsyl
vania From Manila and
Way Ports.
There are now seven United States
transports In port. The arrival of the
Zealandla from Nagasaki and the Penn
sylvania from Honolulu last Saturday
has made it possible to send all the
troops at the Presidio away in a bunch
and the chances are that they will be on
the way before the week is very old
The Senator and Zealandia are at the
Oceanic wharf, the Ohio and Indiana are
at the sea wall, the Valencia is at
Howard-street wharf, the Newport is at
the Mall dock and the Pennsylvania is
at the quarantine station, being fumi
gated. The Senator and Valencia may
get away to-morrow and the other ves
sels will follow at intervals during the
week.
The Zealandla brought up thÂ© remains
of the Rev. T. S. Freeman, who com
mitted suicide in Nagasaki harbor. He
was chaplain of the cruiser Baltimore,
but was taken sick and was invalided
home.
"I never noticed anything very much
the matter with him," said Captain
Thomas Dowdell yesterday. "He looked
natural, but was very melancholy. I
did not think it necessary to confine him
and the only watch on him was to see
that he did not go ashore unless some
one was with him. No one was more
surprised than I when I heard he had
jumped overboard."
Quartermaster William Lowrath was
the only one who saw the unfortunate
chaplain take the fatal plunge. "His last
thoughts were of his wife," said Lowrath
yesterday. "It was early in the morn
ing and I went on deck to call the
! watch. I heard some one call out, 'Tele
! graph my wife the result of this and send
! her my money." 1 rushed around me
i house and there was Mr. Freeman stand
ing with one foot on the chock of the
davit, holding onto the side of the ship
I with one hand. He had a lot of lead
I sinkers around his waist, and as I ran
i toward him he dropped into the wakr.
We dropped a heaving line over the side
to mark where he had gone and after
! ward a diver recovered the body. He
i went down in forty feet of water and
j sank to the bottom at once."
The remains of Chaplain Freeman will
be shipped to Logansport, Ind., to-day.
A passenger by the Zealandia as far as
I Nagasaki was George de K. Foute.
i George wanted to see the war but he did
not want to be a soldier. He finally 86
curod a clerkship, and giving up a snug
berth in the railroad, he went to
Manila on the Newport. He did not fa
vorably Impress his superiors during the
voyage and the result was that he was
relieved from duty aa soon as the New
port arrived. After some maneuvering
he secured a return passage on the Zea
landia, but got into trouble the first day
out. Captain Dowdell brought him to
time with a threat to lock him, up and
j George behaved himself as far as N. k
asaki. While the Zealandia was being
repaired the China came in and Foute
was passed along to her and so reached
San Francisco. Sundry I. O. U.s still
floating around among the officers of the
Zealandia are reminders of George's
trip on that vessel.
The typhoon that did so much damage
to the Zealandia sank the German steam
er Trinidad. She was on her way from
Hamburg to Kiaochan with stores for the
German Government. Her crew was phk
ed up by the British steamer Rohllla.
When she sighted the wreck it was flying
the American ensign union down at the
main, the English Jack with a knot in it
1 and the Greek ensign underneath it for
j ward, and in the rigging there was a
( board with "We are sinking" painted on
lit in big letters. Twenty minutes after
I the crew was taken off the Trinidad sank.
! Chief Steward Seeley of the Zealandia
says he has been through some heavy
storms off Blanco and Flattery, but he
never saw anything to equal the typhoon
the Zealandia weathered in such splendid
shape.
The Pennsylvania was 33 days from Ma
nila, 23 from the I>adrones. where she put
I in to land the Spanish doctor taken away
from Guam by the Charleston, and 9 days
! from Honolulu. She brings up 13 soldiers
! from Manila and 18 from Honolulu. Dr.
: Smith, surgeon of the Baltimore, conies
up to pass an examination for promotion.
Among those on the sick list Is A. Hart
! well, a California boy. He is much better
| for his sea voyage. A sergeant major of
the Montana regiment comes up on a
furlough. His mother died while he was
in Manila and he has to attend to the es
tate. Four "time-expired" regulars and
three crazy sailors from the Baltimore
were passengers on the troopship. The
crazy mon are gradually improving, but a
long rest is expected to thoroughly re
store them to health.
The Pennsylvania brings up a trophy
from Guam in the shape of a Spanish
flag. It was flying over the boat that
came out from the Custom House, and
when one of the transport's crew offered
to buy it the Spaniards were only too
glad to sell.
One of the New York boys played a
joke on Colonel Barber while the Pennsyl
vania was in port, that ended disastrously
for the joker. While the Colonel was
waiting for the dinner bell, the soldier got
In through a wlpdow and passed the din
ner out to his waiting comrades. Every
thing went from the Colonel's leg of mut
ton down to his cup of tea and the wrath
of the warrior may be imagined when the
dinner bell called him to a table swept
bare. The offender was afterward located
and was living on bread and water when
the Pennsylvania left.
The ship Tacoma docked to-day at Main
street to get ready for another trip to Ma
nila with horses. Lieutenant O'Shea will
go out in charge of the consignment this
time instead of Lieutenant Cameron.
James <!. Maguire was a passenger on
the Humboldt for Eureka yesterday.
Strange to say there was not a corporal's
guard down to see him off. The "Little
Giant" has not a great following on the
front apparently.
Jt was rumored on the front yesterday
that the raft anchored off Melggs wharf
last week had been stolen during the
night. It was only taken to the Port
Costa Lumber Mills. The tug Rescue did
the job. and it was done according to in-
Btructions.

Death laid claim to one more of the

the great General Scott. This was Mat
thew White, who died at his late resi

thirty years, and all that was mortal of

MISSIONARIES
ON THEIR WAY
TO MOLOKAI
Five Young Clerics'
Life Work.
ARE DIRECT FROM FRANCE
TO EMULATE THE LIFE OF
FATHER DAMIAN.
They "Will Be Ordained at Honolulu
When They Beach the Age
of Twenty-Five
Years.
The Rev. Father C. M. Llmburg. the
provincial of the Marist community In the
Sandwich Islands, Is on a return visit to
this city from Paris and on his way back
to the seat of his labors in the islands.
"With him are five clerics who have given
up home and dear ones to work among the
lepers on the disease-stricken Isle of
Molokai.
These young men, ranging between the
ages of twenty-one and twenty-three,
were selected by Father Llmburg from a
class of clerics in the Marist Theological
Seminary at Paris. They will accom
pany their superior to the islands where,
upon attaining the age of twenty-five
years, they will receive their appointed
positions as missionaries.
It has been thought advisable to post
pone the ordination ceremony until they
attain this age, which entitles them as.
priests to preach the gospel.
Until that time, however, they will
teach among the lepers, doing good and
alleviating the sufferings of those rele
gated to the isle whose hope is abandoned.
Their only expressed hope on leaving
civilization is that they may, in a degree,
lessen the sufferings of the unfortunates
and emulate the noble life of Father
Damian, who gave up home and civiliza
tion for a life of sacrifice and a death by
loathsome disease, he having contracted
during his laboi?.
They express no regret at leaving the
world and speak of the future only as a
trial of duty and the peiformancs of
I good work among the lepers.
They will leave Wednesday morning fcr
Honolulu accompanied by Father I-im
burg; and, until that time, will reside in
the vicinity of the French Church. They
will hold with the priests of this church
a sor> of last communion, as it were, be
tween the world and death before llnal.y
I emcarking for the plague-stricken isle of
MoloKal.
if possible, when they reacn the ago of
'â¢ twenty-five years, providing thnv leave no
j trace of the disease, they will bo taken to
i Honolulu from Molokai to be thore or
' dained by the Bishop of the Sandwich
Islands. In the meantime, however, they
will act simply in the capacity of teach
! ers and not preachers.

PROMISE ME AND PEACEFUL
GLEN SHOW SPEKD.
Great Running at Union, and Ingle
bide Parks Witnessed by Many
Thousand Spectators â The
Detailed Results.
There were no sensations sprung on the
large crowd that attended Union Park
yt-sterd^y, but enough good sport was
presented to satisfy the most ardent fol
lower of coursing. Short enders were In
clover during the running of the large
card and broad smiles testified their
satisfaction in winning.
Quiver proved a stumbling block in the
path of the talent. She repeated her
performance of Saturday by beating
Bendalong in the second round when odds
were given against her at 4 to L . When
she was pitted again Montana In the
third round Quiver was again on the
short end with odds of 6 to 1 against her.
The black bitch carried the hones of the
short enders in this course and she up
held their cause by making a "no go"
with Montana.
When they were again slipped the odds
had narrowed down to 3 to l, with Quiver
still on the short end. This time Mr.
.Lopez' possession went out and won
handily. In the fourth round Quiver was
put out of the race for the stake by
Jennie Wilson. In the latter course she
was on the short end again and might
have beaten her more experienced rival
but for a bad fall. Quiver allowed Jen
nie Wilson to set the pace to the hare,
but on the turn she got close to the prey
and scored many points. Near the
escapes she made a drive, for the tricky
bare, who wrenched out of danger. This
Bent Quiver on her back and Jennie Wil
son began scoring until the kill and
earned a flag. Ip to her fall Quiver had
her rival beaten. Quiver's performance
was a remarkable one and created quite a
surprise. She possesses stamina and speed
and will surely be heard from in the fu
ture.
Douglas defeated Prince Hal at odds
of 7 to 1, the highest offered during the
day. Very few short enders got aboard,
as Prince Hal was looked on as v sure
winner. In the second run down of the
Reserve stake Glenstone beat Snapshot at
5 to 3, Bonita beat Victor at 3 to 1 and
Bendi^o beat Morning Glory at the same
odds.
In the fourth round Promise Me and
Douglas were slipped to the fastest
"jack"' ever turned loose at Union Park.
He led the dogs across the field full tilt
and gradually opened up a streak of day
light between his pursuers. Xear the
escapes he turned and shot toward the
kennels with the dogs straining every
nerve to get near him. He wrenched
when close to the fence and retun. to
the slips, and when half way up the field
turned round as if inviting his relentless
chasers to come on. When they neared
him he let out a few more links and made
the dogs look like selling platers. He
then ran into the escapes and chucklel
over his victory, as did the spectators
in the grand stand. Promise Me led
throughout the race, although he had lit
tle chance to score many points. The
hard course he had after the speedy hare
proved to his detriment in the next
round when Jennie Wilson easily downed
him.
The Reserve stake was captured by
Handy & Smith's Ida. She had Jennie
Wilson to contend against in the final,
and a merry race it was. Another lively
jack was turned loose and for three min
utes the two fought for supremacy. Ida
did not disappoint her admirers and got
in on the hare near the finish and scored
enough to earn her the flag and the. big
stake.
As was predicted, the Champion stake
proved close and exciting. In the first
run down short-enders and the talent
broke even. The first course proved a
eurprlse to every one. False Flatterer,
the ultimate runner up, was pitted against
Kock Island Boy. an IS-months'-old pup
py. False Flatterer barely led to the hare
and the course was a close one. The lat
ter was given the flag. Judges of form
Bee in Rock Island Boy a great dog and
prophesy great things from him. as he
possesses speed and staying^qualities.
In the second round wait a Little and
False Flatterer were led past the grand
stand by the hare. Th.c latter lea up.
Lut to the surprise of every one Walt a
Little made a drive and killed. Had the
bare lasted a little longer Walt a Little,
instead of False Flatterer, would have
yon.
Theron was beaten by FlAn Friend In
the first run down. Theron showed vast
improvement In this race and made a good
exhibition.
Short-enders made a winning in the
final of the Champion stake, when Firm
Friend beat False Flatterer, his old ken
nel mate, at odds of 5 to S.
Sir John Arnot was withdrawn by his
owner, T. A. Gaffn<-y, owing to his long
course on the previous day. Little hope
for his recovery is given, as Sir John
overstrained himself.

CAMPANIA WINS A STAKE.
Her Victory Was Witnessed by Sev-
eral Thousand Spectators at
Ingleside Yesterday.
Campania won the non-winners' stake
at Ingleside yesterday, handily defeating
Beau Peep in the finals by a score of 14
to 2. {The talent had all decided that
Royal Buck would capture the stake, but
the Buck was unfortunately defeated by
Glen Roy in the fourth round much to
their surprise.
In the first round Conqueror and For
give ran a long court that lasted 4 min
utes and 12 seconds, but Forgive won the
course by a score of 24 to 6. The sen-
Bational course of the day was run be
twen Daisy Hill and Maid of Hill. The
two fleet hounds pursued the hare past
the grand stand three times, much to the
delight of the spectators, and Daisy Hill
killed and won the course by a score of
24 to 11.
Counterfeit lost his first course yester
day to Jimmy Cork and should never
have been allowed to run by the club
Btewards. as before his course he showed
considerable lameness and after his de
feat literally limped off on three legs.
i Beau Peep, the iuriner-uj> in tb* etake.
was in great form yesterday and won
on the short end nearly every time he
ran. In the finals it was only the fleet
ness of Campania that put him out, ana
no doubt If the course had been more or
work and leBS of speed the tables might
have been turned. . . ,
The day throughout was a short ena
ers' day and most of the short enders tnat
won did so at good long odds. Among
them were: Miss Grizzle at 2 to 1, Black
Bess at 7 to 1. Las Falmas, 3 to 1; Sports

ST. MATHEWS VS. HOITTS.
A Football Game Which Was Uneven
but Not Rough.
There were several ina'.curaciea in a
report sent in for publication of a foot
ball game between teams of the Hoitt arid
St. Mathew'.s schools lant Saturday. The
report stated that the game stood 18 to 6
when stopped at the and of the flrst half
on account of the roughness of the St.
Mathew's team. Aa a matter of fact the
Hen; stood 17 to 0 when the game was
stopped, which was ju.st three minutes
from the end of the second iialf.
As regards the alleged "roughness" of
the St. Matbew'a team, Referee L. S.
(.'handler, who was chosen by Hoitt's for
that position, said yesterday: "It was a
hurd game, not a dirty one, tind the
Hoitts had no right to withdraw. Indeed
the Hoitt team would have preferred to
continue. In the Incident, which led to
stopping the game, a St. Mathew boy was
roughly treated, and in attempting to re
sent the attack, save the impression of
initiating violence, which is not the case."
I'mpire J. B. Osborn corroborated Mr.
Chandler's statement and entirely exon
erated the St. Mathew's School team of
the charge of foul playing.
Handball at Ryan's Court.
Eight spirited handball games were
played at Ryan's court yesterday after
noon, with the following results:

THE LEADERS
INGLQRIOUSLY
MET DEFEAT
After Securing a Lead
Harvey Falters.
AN IMMENSE CROWD PRESENT
THEY HOWL AND DO OTHER
PIUTISH THINGS.
How the Various Teams Fared Yes
terday at Towns Through
out This Glorious
State.
By Joe Corbett.
Of all the crowds that have wandered
into Recreation Park this season, yester
day's was indeed the banner of them all.
Not only did it take first place for size
it was without doubt the most cheerful
and enthusiastic audience that has at
tended a ball game In many a day. I
say enthusiastic, as it strikes me as being
more palatable, but in truth I at times
thought myself in an asylum, for never
did educated and civilized beings make
such a demonstration. Why, at times it
was something fearful. Yet there is a
cause at the bottom of it all, and, there
fore, much can be overlooked.
The Athletics defeated the mighty lead
ers. This brief statement in Itself will
convey the cause of why a mass of peo
ple, nearly 5000 strong, made of them
selves a band of Piutea.
But it was not principally in the de
feat that all this happened. It was the
manner in which it came about, and all
hats were off to Hilderbrand, Fitzpatrick
and Meeney.
These three, with the assistance of their
cohorts, of course, just stole a victory
from the Gilt Edges when it seemed al
most Impossible. , ,
Hilderbrand made three hits and drove
in as many runs; Meeney made two hits
and scored three runs; Fitzpatrick held
his clever opponents down to live hits,
and there you have it.
The game was beautiful, interesting
and glorious. It started off like a walk
over for the leaders, who made five runs
before the Athletics came out of a pro
longed trance. Knurs, principally, were
responsible for their runs in these lirst
two innings, but after that the Athletics
steadied down to real baseball, and by
persistent work and clever playing finally
emerged victorious.
In the sixth inning, with the score six
to Jive against them, they went to bat,
and never stopped hammering Harvey,
the "erstwhile wonder," until two men
had crossed the plate and gave them
a lead which was held through the mas
terjy pitching of Fitzpatrick.
The contest was easily the greatest yet
seen at the park, and was enjoyed im
mensely by all. The playing of Hanley
and Lockhead was sensational, and the
game was replete with many clever skits.
McCarthy's base-running also surprised
the crowd. The score follows:

The "Babies" Beat Oakland.
WATSOXVILLE, Oct. lo.â This after
noon in the presence of a large audience
the Watsonvilles defeated Oakland and
an umpire by a score of 7 to 1.
The only run made by the Oaklands was
when Cramer claimed to have been hit
by a pitched ball and advanced an Oak
land player in from third. No one else
saw the play as did Cramer. In the
fourth inning Francks of the Watson
villes battod Mosklmon for a home run.
Fourteen base hits were made off Mos
kimon and one off Donlin. Mosklmon
walked six and Donlin two. Donlin
struck out six and Moskimon two. Both
men played excellent ball, and Hartman
again performed gnat backstop work (or
Donlin. This is the fourth consecutive
victory for the Babies.
"Sand Crabs" Played Ball.
SANTA CRUZ, Oct. 16.â The hoodo Is
off the Beach Combers. In a game of the
best kind of ball here to-day they beat
the Ban Franciscos by a score of 9 to 2,
and they would probably have gooae
egged the visitors but for a missed fly
by Arreianes at second and a wild throw
from Fitzgerald, catcher, to Devereux at
third.
The Beach Combers batted Iberg all
ov<r the field, making nine hits off him.
Borchers, for the local team, pitched a
great game, striking out fifteen men and
permitting only two hits. Batteries: San
Franciscosâ lberg and Hammond; Santa
Cruzâ Daubenbis and Fitzgerald. Score:
Santa Cruz 9, San Francisco 2.
Newarks Were Defeated.
DECOTO, Cal.. Oct. 16.â The San Fran
cisco Golden Gate nine won a hard
fought game of ball from the Newark
Club to-day by a score of 12 to 11. The de
feat of the Newarks was due to their
wild pitching.

park and half-way to Muss.il Hock down

The advertisement canvasser for a St. Louis daily paper says of
Ripans Tabules :" Ever since I can remember I have been troubled
â¢with constipation in its severest form. So acute, in fact, at times, at
to produce dreadful headaches that, notwithstanding all the outdoor
work afforded me by my vocation, and the latitude it allowed me to
test my pedestrian abilities â which is supposed to be a successful
manner of displacing constipation â 1 was yery often compelled to
forego my pursuit of 'business.' Constipation with me seemed to
be hereditary rather than due to accidental causes, therefore much
harder to relieve. In my extremity I often resorted to most drastio
measures, but found* no cure to be permanent. In 1892, while con-
nected with the Times of El Paso, Tex., Ripans Tabules were brought
to my notice, and I used them with marked success. Nowadays I i
never suffer from such severe cases of constipation, and the violent
headaches I formerly experienced never worry me in the least. Some-
: ' times, though, when I allow myself to lapse - for a period into irreg- !
ular habits, I become shghtly constipated, but by taking the Tabules
according to directions, my bowels again pexform their functions in: a
*Uj|hlvj>fcasing manner.'^ /
to escape the masses of people that strug
gled around the centers of attraction.
After 1 o'clock not a seat was to be had
near the band stand and the crowds
lounged on the lawns within hearing of
the music. The programme was excep
tionally good, a selection from "Martha"
being- encored again and again.
"Within the course of the next few
weeks cyclists and equestrians will be af
forded greater opportunities for pleasure.
The bridle and cycle paths are well on the
road toward completion, and when they
are opened to the public a long desired
improvement will have been accom
plished. It is thought that the water
works, increasing the dally output from
the present capacity of 1,250.000 gallons to
2,000,000 gallons will be completed. This
will admit of many improvements tend
iiiK to further beautify the park.
During the last week several donations
have been added to the Park Museum.
The latest donations are two wooden rice
ladles from Japan, presented by John L.
Bard well; two large desert turtles and
one tarantula from the Mohave desert,
presented by Joseph P. Carroll; one an
cient cap pistol, presented by J. H. Cul
beiwon, and a historic china bowl, pre
sented by J. A. Cole.
The Chutes and Sutro's Baths furnished
amusement for thousands, as well as the
park and ocean. An interesting variety
performance in the big theater and the
ever popular chutes and scenic railway
entertained the visitors at the Chutes,
while the patrons of Sutro's Baths enjoy
ed the aquatic sports. In the 50-yard
dash for novices H. Miller was declared
winner, with D. Mackel second. The re
sults of other contests follow: 100-yard
juvenile, E. Bonnifield first, W. Browfatt
second; obstacle race for boys, J. Bevins
first. A. Best second; trick and fancy
spring board diving. Otto Schulte first,
B. Lacoste second; 75-yard tub race, two

UNUSUALLY WARM DAY
FOR SAN FRANCISCO
IT MEETS WITH AXMOST UNT-
VEBSAL APPROVAL.
The Entire City Seemed to Relax
Under the Influence of a Very
Unusual Sun.
While one was much inclined to ques
tion, yesterday, the truth of the oft
repeated statement that San Franciscans
are never obliged to seek the shady side
of a street, there there can be little douut
that the continued warm weather met
with g-eneral approval.
In short, the man who asks, "Is this
warm enough for you?" was conspicuous
by his absenceâ not having to work, he
hied himself to the park or Cliff House
and for a time forgot his woes.
The ferry-boats did an enormous busi
ness as did the vendors of cooling: drinks
generally, and the entire city seemed to
relax for a time under the genial influence
of a very unusual sun.
The maximum temperature was Rn de
grees. To-dayâ if we may behove the
weather manâ it will be somewhat cloudy
and cooler, with light variable winds from
the southwest.

Oakland O/flce San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 16.
Borne of the Republican candidates are
evidently laboring under a delusion. In
their speeches throughout the county
they have taken on an apologetic mood,
though why they 6hould do so is a mys
tery. There Is certainly nothing in this
campaign of the party in Alameda Coun
ty needing an apology. It is a mistake
to presume that such a necessity exists.
This is the time for an aggressive cam
paign. It Is a time when so little that Is
material and bo much that Is vaporous is
set up in the hope of defeating the Re
publican party that the opposition should
be met firmly and unflinchingly.
If any candidate has anything to be
ashamed of in his private life or in his
public capacity he should resign from the
ticket and not go around aplologizing.
Those candidates on the county t:ekei
are officeholders certainly have no
need to excuse themselves. Whai
Lave been their political pn-:
le their offices is no business of their
vi enemies, and there can certainly
be no objection raised to the manner in
office-holding candidates have- con
: their Jeparimentjj during the past
. ears.

â¢ r candidates are all stalwart

offices they are none the less
ng of the fullest support not alone
party but of all ttu.se who hon
: a ciean administration.
N'ett&er can It be denied that there has
. â  vat unity of action and desire
among all the candidates that there
1 be and which is absolutely neces
sary for the complete success of the en
cket. There is no such thing as de
n Republicanism. A man ia either
of the party or not of it. The platform
adopted at San Leandro and to which
feaity was pledged by every man who
received a nomination expresses perfect
loyalty to the principles of Lincoln down
to their recent developments by Presiduiit
McKlnley. No man who accepted that
rm should consider himself better
than any other man. Kach is but an in
tegral part of the unit, and the failure
of one is the humiliation of all. This
feeling has died out during the past week,
now that the candidates understand each
other's motives better. The great i
the dissatisfied element has always been
that men should be elected on account of
capability ;md iitness rather than because
of their political affiliations. Viewed in
this light there can be no argument ad
vanced why the entire Republican ticket
of this county and State should not bo
elected, as Dr. Pardee said at the San
iJeandro convention, "from Governor to
Constable."
Mayor Thomas certainly did right when
Jie vetoed the tax levy ordinance. Whether
ILake Merritt shall be dredged In one ;â  > ar
or two, or ten, is a matter of small im
portance to the weightier mat
ters of public schools, free library, street
Improvements and an adequate police and
fire department. Other cities sometimes
enjoy an innocent laugh at Oakland, and
during the past week Oakland has en
joyed a little joko on itself. The alleged
Jact has been heralded far and wide that
Lake Merritt is a detriment to public
health, that it threatens the lives of peo
ple tiling in its vicinity and that nothing
ehort of an expenditure of J105.500 before
;h of June would prove an adequate
.relief.
Now comes Dr. J. P. Dunn, the Health
Officer, who a couple of nights ago
f;;te<i his report to the Board of
â i. and solemnly and truthfully
that the death rate in this city is
remarkably low; in fact, that disease 1h
60 well kept in check, and that other
- operate to conserve the public
; to BUcb a marked extent, that
Oakland may truthfully be classed as the
] iest city in the State, perhaps in the
ry.
Now, this is very unkind of Dr. Dunn,
because it furnishes Mayor Thomas and
the opponents of the lake dredging prop
osition with all the argument they need
to show that the plague of death will not
ttaik through this City, oven should Lake
Llt-rritt not be touched for another year.
Of course, if, as It is said, years of sew
nge are deposited in Lake Merrltt, it
should be drc-dged, and sooner or later
â will have to be dredged. But it cannot
be forgotten that in West Oakland, where
dwell in the same space ten people for
every one that resides around j the lake,
v. marsh without any water on It existed
for a quarter of a century, and only a
year â go wÂ»S it reclaimed. This West
Oakland abomination was not only sew
age but a dumping: ground for all the filth
that the Scavengers collected, and which
they were permitted to dump within
breathing distance of dwelling houses, un
til an ordinance not yet three years old
prohibited their doing so. In the case of
Lake Merritt the conditions are more
favorable, for If the sewage now being |
Illegally emptied into a public water park i
be diverted from their course and con
nected with other sewers, a.s the Mayor
suggests. Lake Merrltt would certainly
not be polluted any more than it is at
present, and owing to its periodical flusli-
Ing, would undoubtedly gradually improve
and the dredging could safely be partly
left for another year, especially as during
this very dry summer Oakland has been
so healthy. A new tax levy ordinance
constructed on these lines will undoubt
edly give general satisfaction.
In a few days Oakland will have the
opportunity to express Itself
public parks. For many yearsâ Auditor
Enow says twenty-twoâ there has be- n an
annuaJ agitation in favor of a puMlc
play ground. When Oakland was young
It was all a park and consequently the
necessity for permanently acquiring a
public domain was not sufficiently press
ing to be considered a3 worthy of much
attention. Each year as the city has
built out In all directions, the parka have
disappeared, until now a long ride is nec
essary to reach a breathing spot. While
It would have been more practical to
have acquired a vast tract In the neigh
borhood ot Lake Merritt years ago, the

'â  accuire the sixty acres on Adams Point,
fo beaut v the Vest Oakland Park and
! to make attractive Independent Square in
Fast Oakland is a problem that must
fppoal with Vrce to all who desire to see
some permanent improvement acquired
by this city which will be not only a
' means of enjoyment to residents, but will
serve a.s an attraction to visitors. Should
Oakland acquire adequate parks there is
no doubt that many of her wealthy citi
zens wuuld g-enerously donate the neces
sary features to make such parks places
of note. This has been the rule in every
city where parks are acquired, and there
Is already evidence that Oakland would
not be behind other cities in this respect.
While it may seem a dream, the fact
cannot be disputed that with a beautiful
boulevard around the entire lake front,
wJth the marsh from Eighth to Twelfth
streets filled in. with the lake properly
deepened and cleaned and -with a large
park bordering upon it. handsomely
ornamented with statuary, conservatory,
aviary and other appropriate improve
ments, with the West Oakland marsh
obliterated and adorned according to
plans already prepared, and with Inde
pendence Square fittingly laid out, Oak
land would be, In the eyes of the West,
twioe the city that she is at present.
Oakland Is patting Itself on the back
to-day. It really begins to believe that
its audiences are of a superior order, and
it has good reason for so believing. Last
night General Barnes, assuming one of
his most earnest expressions and atti
tudes, said: "I like to come to Oakland.
I feel at home In Oakland, because of the
high character of Its audiences. I feel
like coming home when I come here."
a few weeks ago Judge Maguire said:
"It delights me to look at this extra
ordinary audience. It is of such an in
telligent order and marked character that
it is an honor to stand before it."
Job Harrlman, the Socialist-Labor
standard-bearer, said two weeks ago:
"This is the most characteristic audience
I have audrt-ssed In my campaign. Oak
land must Indeed be an intelligent com
munity when so many people of such
evident sincerity of purpose desire to
hear the truth."
All these speeches were made fro-n the
same platform with the decorations
slightly changed. But can it be possible
that the audience was the same on all
three occasions?
Oakland society demands an apology
from somebody. In a San Francisco pa
per last week, in an article relating to
the recent crusade against leaving a
theater before the play is over, it was
maliciously stated that the offenders
were Oaklanders, who were in a hurry to
catch the boat or to Insure enough time
to enjoy a little supper before the hist
boat leaves Market street. This is not
true, for humiliating as the admission
may be. the average Oakland audience
at home rises almost en masse about two
minutes before the curtain falls, and
marches out, without having the ghost
of an excuse in re the last boat.

ALAMEDA. Oct. 16.â Frederick W.
Wicker, an insurance broker of this city,
fifty years of age, accidentally shot him
self at about 4 o'clock this afternoon at
the residence of A. Lunt. his brother-in
law, corner of Encinal avenue and Grand

rear of the residence, cleaning a number
of guns and revolvers, part of his con
siderable collection, the last weapon to
be cleaned being a 38-caliber revolver,
which he supposed to be unloaded, but
which contained a single cartridge. This
latt<-r was in some way discharged, the
bullet entering his left breast, grazing his
heart, passing directly through the left
lung, and lodging under the skin of his
back.
When found he was almost dead from
loss of blood. Dr. C. L. Pisoale was has
tily summoned, and succeeded in extract
ing the bullet. At last, accounts Mr.
Wicker was resting # more easily, but his
recovery- is hardly expected.
He served with distinction in the Prus

of lieutenant. Many med&lfl testify to his
meritorious conduct during this service.

"Kid" Price Is dead. '-The Kid" does
not enjoy a reputation that will be em
blazoned on the ranks of fame, but he Is
one of the best known characters In this
city. I'rice was fated to be an orator,
and his gift in that direction was very
pronounced. He had a strong dislike ror
work, and for years he has never been
known to exert himself except In very
small politics, and then only enough to
Insure the barest existence. He was at
every convention, and was several times
at the same primary, and was known to
everybody.
"Kid" Price could make a good speech,
j and some years ago made several, but of
; late he has gone down the hill very fast.
! He contracted asthma and consumption,
i and two weeks ago a kindly Supervisor
I allowed him to watch for death in the Re
! celving Hospital. He recovered a little
i and was seen on the street last Friday.
! This morning he was found dead in the
i Newland House.
For some time past Price has not been
able to get enough to eat. His dayÃ of
usefulness as a ward heeler were over,
and the "Kid" was not wanted any more.
He was 35 years old, and a decade ago his
prospects of success in life were un
usually bright.
Joseph Leesman was found dead on a
brewery wagon near Kimniu^t iÂ»uÂ» n.u.n
lng.
The dead man had been in the employ
of the Oakland Bottling Company for
some time and was delivering goods at
an early hour along the county road.
At 6:15 o'clock the attention of pedes
trians and people in passing \'ehicles was
attracted to the manner in which Lees
man lay on the seat of his wagon, his
body partially reclining over several beer
while his team was leisurely moving
along near the electric car tracks.
iVaring that the driver might have mal
len asleep and that a collision with an
electric ear might ensue, several parties
tried to arouse Leesman by yelling lus
tily at him. This proving of n*> avail, par
ties stopped the horses, climbed up on the
seat, and, to their great surprise, found
i him dead.
Coroner Baldwin was notified and took
charge of the remains. An inquest will be
held. â '
Deceased was a native of San Fran
cisco, aged 25 years. He leaves a widow
! and thr*e young children residing on
i Twenty-second street, between Broadway
! and Telegraph avenue.
Clas Joel Arnbarg, a laborer, met with

' preparatory to the digging of a tunnel

He was picked up dead, with a good-
Klzod rock embedded in his chest. His
face was horribly mutilated, and his right

SPIRITUALISTS AT WAR.
The Truth-Seekers Held Their First
Meeting Yesterday Afternoon
and Outlined a Campaign.
War has been declared by a number of
San Francisco spiritualists, who call
themselves the Truthseekers, against the
State Spiritualist Association. The former
section fired the first gun of the campaign
yesterday afternoon by holding an "anti
fraud" spiritualist meeting at Scottish
Hall and denouncing the State board in
very hard terms. The Truthseekers de
clare that the greatest .grievance they
have against the State board is that they
do nothing to suppress the frauds and
fakers of this city who are doing a thriv
ing business just at present in the slato,
card and dark seance specialties.
William E. Coleman opened the meeting
and talked long and earnestly about spir
itualism and the curse of fraudulent me
diums. He was followed by Bishop A.
Beals, J. S. Loveland and T. E. Simpson.
This* was the first meeting of the Truth
seekers, but they are very enthusiastic
over their labors and declare they will
continue denouncing the fakers until they
drive them to other fields.

THESE HIGHWAYMEN

PROMPTLY " TTJRITED THEIR
SHOTGUNS LOOSE."

ford Receive Some of the
Leaden Pellets, but Finally
Escape.
OAKLAND, Oct. 15.â John Rutherford,
a carpenter, residing at SBG Milton street,
Harry MrManus of 763 Nineteenth street,
and Ralph Nordyke were attacked to
night by three murderous highwaymen
on the road back of Gill' 3 nursery, near
Berkeley.
Rutherford and his two companions had
been hunting in the hills and were home
ward bound. Darkness was setting in last
as they neared Gill's nursery, when they
heard a noise in the brush near the road.
"1 happened to look around," said Mr.
McManus to a reporter to-night at his
home, "and saw three men emerging. Just
after we passed the spot one of the high
waymen, pointing a shotgun at us, shout
ed for us to halt, but Rutherford then
whipped up the horse, and no sooner nad
he done so than a shut was fired. Some of
the shot took effect in my right side, and
Mr Rutherford was hit In one of his
arms. Nordyke was not hit. Soon an
other shot followed and the highwaymen
came running after ua, still commanding
us to halt, but, thanks to Rutherford, we
managed to get away without further in
jury."
McManus says the trio was made up
of one tall man and two short ones.

Tuesday night, Cyclery nail, Hafght
LOVE FEAST OF
THE IROQUOIS BRAVES.
Democratic Club Men Dine
Under a San Leandro
Grapevine Arbor.
THE annual love feast of braves
of the Iroquois Democratic
Club was held yesterday at
San Leandro. It assumed the
form of a bullshead breakfast under
the grape vine arbor of Estadillo i
House. The day was like one In
June, making dining undfr the
bluest of blue skies a delightful
fuiK tion, evr-n though the year be
waning; rapidly.
President Thomas J. Walsh looked
after the- comfort of the gnests, he
being assisted by the trustees of the
clubâ Louis Metzger, Fred Ruabe.
C. H. Holcombe, M. H. Mead.
Thomas Burns, L. V. Merle and \V.
J. Bryan. Under their watchful eyes
no hungry man was turned away
from the bountifully laden tables of
host Godchaux. A string orchestra
dispense)} sweet music, while be
tween t/e speeches of Democratic
spellbinders, the Iroquois Club quar
tet rendered vocal numbers appro
priate to the occasion. Their polit
ical songs were invariably cast to
the music of some popular refrain
with words changed to fit the crime.
James G. Maguire was not present
at the speech making. He crossed
the bay with the members, but re
mained in Oakland, as he purposed
leaving for the north early in the
afternoon. Many other notables were
absent. Among the speakers intro
duced by Toastmaster Fred Raabe
were T C. Stoddard of Alameda
County, T. F. Bonnet, Peter J.
Kelly, John P. Dunn. L. C. Bying
ton J. J. Tobin George H. Cabaniss,
Finlay Cook. Benjamin F. Debow,
Archie Campbell and William M.
Hinton.
No flights of oratory were at
tempted by the speakers, although
each reiterated the sentiments of
President Walsh that they had never
entered a campaign with such feel
ings of ultimate success. The father
of the Iroquois was not called upon
and Stayan streets; speakers, Hon. C. L.
Patton. D. E. McKinlay and others.
Wednesday night, Metropolitan Tem
ple, D. E. McKinlay will fully discuss
single tax and protection to Amercian
Vhere will be music and the latest
campaign songs as a reaction from tne
more serious business and rousing meet
ings are expected.
Forty-Third District Club.
The Forty-thifd District Republican
Club held its regular meeting at 412 Jack
son street Saturday night. President Ja
cob Dreyfuss was in the chair. After the
routine of business several short but stir
ring addresses were delivered by Jacob
Miller, S. Shaw, William Golden. J. J.
Applegate and others.
GLEN PARK OPENING.
Professor J. Williams, the Intrepid
Cliff House Bird Man, Walks
the High Wire.
Tho announcement that Professor J.
Williams would attempt to cross Glen
Park Canyon, 1000 feet in width, on a
tight rope, 300 feet above the ground,
drew several thousand people to the
opening of Glen Park and Mission Zoo
yesterday afternoon.
The ever-ready and courageous profes
sor, best known, perhaps.through his ex
hibitions of trained birds at the <~~/f
House, set out on his perilous walk at
about 2 o'clock, making the passage,
from bank to bank, in about ten minutes.
The playing of the Fourth Cavalry
Band was much enjoyed and Moro Castle,
with its wild animals, the donkeys, Punch
and Judy show, swings, etc., received
their full share of attention.
The balloon ascension to have been
made by Professor Charles Conlon, was
a dismal failureâ the balloon failing to
clear him from the ground and collapsing
ignominiously on an adjoining hillside.
A second attempt was even more dis
astrous, the balloon catching fire and be
ing totally destroyed.
It was but little regretted, having ac
quired the reputation of being unlucky
through its responsibility for the death
of a boy in Oakland and the accident to
ProfeSor Vosmer last Sunday. Shade in
the park was desirable, but scarce; and
the charge of 5 cents per glass for ice
water at the refreshment Dooth aroused
much indignation. J.he street car ser
vice was quite inadequate to meet the
demands upon it; but increased facilities
are promised for next Sunday.

THE SAN FEAKCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1898.
URGE ALLEGIANCE
TO PARTY CREED
An Address by National
Democrats.
DENOUNCES THE BRYANITES
SIXTEEN-TO-ONE THEORY DE-
CLARED FALLACIOUS.
Followers of Jeffersonian Traditions
Asked to Work for the Defeat
of the Chicago Platform
Candidates.
Special Dlipatch to The CalL
INDIANAPOLIS. Oct. 16â The Na
tional Democratic Committee issued tho
following address to-day;
To the National Democrats of the Unit
ed States: Your National Committee,
speaking for the National Democratic
party, congratulates the country on tne
empnatic and merited condemnation at
the polls by the people in lbifG of the ais
honorable and dangerous doctrines pro
mulgated by the Chicago platform, i-he
moral influence exerted by the Indianap
olis convention hits amply compensated
for the efforts made in behalf ot unal
loyed Democratic principles, as held and
taught by Jefferson, Jackson, Tilden and
Cleveland. And to-day this platform is
the rock and firm foundation on which
alone a Democrat can rest his political
faith. We, therefore, take this oppor
tunity to reaffirm with accumulated force
the principles of our party as enunciated
at Indianapolis in 1896.
We believe that the theory of so-called
protection, which, in its last analysis, in
volves the spoliation of the many for the
benefit of the few, is dishonest, and that
it directly and inevitably breeds trusts,
monopolies and those special privileges
by which the cunning and unscrupulous
prey on their unsuspecting and credulous
fellow citizens. The protective tax is not
only dishonest and oppressive but it ob
structs that free and natural interchange
of commodities which would increasingly
tend to lessen the cost of the necessities
and comforts of life to our wage-earning
classes. It has destroyed our merchant
navy. It has practically driven our flag
from the seas, and has forced us into the
humiliating necessity of paying vast and
constant tribute to other nations for
ocean carriage. We oppose the extension
of this insular system to any colonies
that we have acquired or hereafter may
acquire, and favor, as we always have
favored, the widest freedom of trade. It
is folly to think of securing foreign mar
kets unless we are willing to trade with
foreign countries. Especially do we de
nounce the Chicago platform for its virtual
abandonment of this great and time-hon
ored principle.
The doctrine of free silver is an exten
sion of the protective principle. Free coin
age is the protection of a few silver mine
owners, at the expense of our laboring
classes. This policy, were it adopted.,
would rob the workers of half their earn
ings, and, by unsettling values, would
bring about a paralysis of trade and com
merce and reduce us financially to the
level of barbarous and uncivilized nation*.
We are unreservedly for the single gold
standard, and oppose international bimet
alism, so called, as both impracticable and
undesirable. We believe that the theory
of one standard, and the selection of gold
as that standard, has been struck off in
the mint of human experience, as the re
sult of a slowly developed and beneficent
evolution in civilization.
More than ever do we believe that the
continued existence of our National or
ganization is desirable for the well-being
of our country. There is no other party
that represents the principles for which
we are proud to stand. Our work is not
completed. We are not only against free
silver, but we are for sound money.
The same causes that induced the In
dianapolis convention of 1K96 Still exist.
The financial relief expected of the pres
ent administration has not been given.
The recent utterances of no less than six
teen members of the Democratic National
Committee, declaring for free silver and
the renomination of Mr. Bryan, show
conclusively that efforts will be made 'o
fight the campaign of 1900 on the free sii
ver issue and under the old leader. Afc
long as the principles of the Indianapolis
platform remain disregarded by the old
parties, our duty to our country, to our
party and to ourselves, demands that we
should continue our fight against free
silver and keep up our efforts to secure
for this nation such financial legislation
as shall make us commercially the strong
est nation in the world.
We protest against the pollution of the
Democratic party by alliance with those
financial declarations which are at war
with its old and true creed.
With the situation as it exists In some
of the various States we have no prov
ince to interfere. The National Demo
crats of each State must solve their local
problems in such a way as may seem to
them moat likely to insure the triumphs
of the principles for which the national
organization stands, and to the mainte
nance of which it is solemnly pledged.
We seek no offices and wjsh for no re
wards, except those that flow from the
consciousness of duty done. Our prin
ciples, tho gold standard, monetary re
form, tariff for revenue only, civil serv
ice reform, rigid economy in the admin
istration of the Government, the mainte
nance of law and order, freedom of con
tract and the protection of all contract
rights must triumph if our representa
tive Federal republic is to be perpetuated.
In behalf of these principles we appeal
to the sober, settled judgment of the
American people. We should be prepared
now and at all times to defend them
against assault from any quarter.
It is our earnest hope that our fellow
Democrats in every nook and corner of
our land may realize their error in follow
ing the vagaries of the Chicago platform,
and may unite with us in the advocacy
and promulgation of those sound and
fundamental political principles which
will lead to a gratification of them by the
votes of the people, insuring a truly Dem
ocratic victory.
The National Committee of the National
Democratic party, by George Foster Pea
body, Chairman.
ANGELS CAMP'S RECEPTION
TO CANDIDATE GAGE
Twelve Hundred People Gather in the
Mountain Town to Bid Him
Welcome.
ANGELS CAMP, Oct. 16.-Flags,
streamers and bunting on business
houses and residences, bonfires and band
music, were in evidence when Henry T.
Gage, V. T. Gaskill and W. J. Foley en
tered the town to-night. The Angels Ho
tel was beautifully decorated within and
without in honor of the distinguished
guest. At 7 o'clock a committee of Pio
neers and the Angels band started up the
road and met the party. Flags were to
be seen everywhere and people lined the
road to welcome the candidate.
Mr. Gage was comfortably ensconced
in a carriage drawn by two handsome
grays, and preceded by the band, play
ing a patriotic air, a grand entrance was
made Into the town. Cheer upon cheer
rang out when the party alighted at the
hotel. Frank Egan of the County Cen
tral Committee was at hand and assumed
charge of the guests. A sumptuous re
past was served in the beautifully dec
orated dining room, while Mr. Egan ad
dressed the waiting crowd. He stated
that as it was Sunda.y Mr. Gage could not
address them, but would hold an informal
reception in the hotel parlors later and
would speak at 9 o'clock in the morning.
Mr. Gage estimates that fully 1200 peo
ple assembled to give him this rousing
reception. He was favorably impressed
with the band music and was surprised
that a mountain town should have such
splendid talent.
Garibaldi Guards Celebrate.
Tho Garibaldi Guards gave a ball at
their hall on Broadway last evening in
celebration of the 406 th anniversary of
the discovery of America by Christopher
Columbus. The hall was filled with the
numerous members of the organization
and their friends. Dancing, the principal
amusement, was continued until a late
hour.
GOSSIP OF THE
TURFMEN UNO
RACEHORSES
Grand Performance of
La Goleta.
HEADWATER ALSO A CRACK
TALK OP RIENZI HUGHES SOON
RETIRING.
Five California Horses Win in One
Day at Morris Parkâ Devon a
"Comer" â Grannan to
Book Here.
La Goleta, the Baldwin filly, by Amigo-
Rosebud, was easily the star performer
at the Los Angeles meeting, which closed
Saturday last. To her credit were live
furlongs in 1:00 (98 pounds up), seven fur
longs in 1:26^ (107 pounds up) and a mile
in 1:39% (111 pounds up). As the coast rec
ords are :59, 1:26 and 1:89*4 respectively,
and La Goleta won these races easily, she
must be accounted a real "phenom." Such
horses as Grady, Shasta Water and Mar
plot could not make the Baldwin filly ex
tend herself a little bit, and Judging by
this she should be a factor in the stakes
here next winter.
Headwater, who ran five and a half fur
longs in l:o7^s with 118 pounds up last
Saturday, was about the best two-year
old shown at the Los Angeles meeting.
He is a bay gelding, by imp. Watercress
(one of the first of that horse's get in
America), from Headflower, a young
Flood mare raced successfully by A. B.
Spreckels. Mr. Spreckels bred Head
water and he was foaled at the Napa
ranch. Hugh Jones secured him last
spring and made a great "killins" the
lirst time Headwater was started at St.
Louis last spring.
It is rumored that Rlenzi Hughes will
soon retire from the turf, his health be
ing anything but good. He owns such
good ones as Anne Page and Jennie Reid.
The appointment of Edwin F. Smith as
presiding judge at Oakland meets with
general approval, as he is a Calirornian
and has been identified with itÂ».cing (as
secretary of the State Agricultural Soci
ety) since 1879. He is thoroughly capa
ble, and for months acted as presiding
judge at Bay District track, giving per
fect satisfaction.
Norman Brough is said to be the new
member of the hrm of Killip & Co., which
will hold a few auction sales of thorough
breds here next winter.
It is probable that Mr. Leavitt of Oak
land, a candidate for the State Senate,
will secure the programme privilege at
both the Oakland and Ingleside track
for the coming long racing season.
Jimmy Michaels, the crack professional
bicyclist, is exercising Will Wallace's
horses these days at Hawthorne track,
and can "do" 9S pounds. Wallace says
of him: "He has a good seat, is anxious
to ride, and one of these days when I
have an easy horso to ride and the neid
Is small I am going to put him up."
In the Dixiana stakes, won by Briar
Sweet, every starter had won its last
previous race.
Of a race won by Basqull at Hawthorne
the, other day and of "Virginia" Carroll,
who is coming to California shortly, the
Daily Racing Form of Chicago has the
following to say:
Johnny McHale bet on Basqull at 30 to 1.
saying "My horse can beat Buckvidere." Vlr
fftnia Carroll was severely punlshe.i for his
kidding, as when a man bet $10 on Basqull
at 30 he port")! 40, Kot another $10 :ind going
to 50 was again winded. When McHaie bet him
$10 nt 30 to, 1 Carroll said "Thank you." and
Mi-Hale reciprocated the politeness when he
Kot the ticket cashed.
At Morris Park one day last week Cali
fornia horses were very much in it, live
of them winning out of six races run.
Tho winners were Julius Caesar (by
Tyrant-Stella), Toluca (by Nomad-
Sweet), Briar Sweet (by imp. Sir Modred-
Sweotbrian. Sir Walter (by imp. Midlo
thian-La Scala) and Scotch Plaid (by
imp. Midlothian-Mottle). Four of the five
were bred at J. B. Haggin's Rancho del
Paso in Sacramento County.
Midlo won a seven furlong dash at
Windsor, Ontario, last wÂ«ek. The Mid
lothian gelding now belongs to C. Scan
lan. Mldlo was bred by the late Simeon
G. Reed.
Ed Corrigan was disabled in a runaway
accident in Chicago the day that Alpen
won the stallion stakes. Sam Ecker of St.
Louis was riding with him and was also
badly shaken up and bruised. An old lady
on a bicycle scared the Corrigan road-
ster.
Mrs. Jimmie, a recent winner at Wind
sor, is by imp. Goldfinch-Delight, and
therefore a product of Rancho del Paso.
Jack Reavey, a well-known California
trainer, is very ill in this city.
Devln. who has been doing considerable
riding for Tom Boyle and B. J. Baldwin,
Is a "'comer." Experts say he is sure to
turn out a high-class horse pilot.
Cole Ullman, well known here, had a
eood day at Hawthorne on the 11th, beat
ing Hindoo's Dream (15 to 1) and winning
$2800 by the victory of Basquil.
Riley Grannan has announced that he
will make books in California during the
coming winter. The plunger swears off
on the Golden State racing regularly, but
is generally found at either Oakland or
Ingleside before the snow flies in Ken-
Charles F. Price, who will be chief of
the board of stewards for the California
Jockey Club during the coming meetings,
has gone on a visit to Los Angeles, where
he has some old Louisville friends Mr
Price is a very vigilant racing official and
quick to detect anything wrong about a
race. He watches the equipment of raN
lopers very closely. If a horse runs with
out blinkers one day, the next time has
them on and wins and the third time out
is noticed without them, "something is
liable to drap." The same applies to
spurs or whip. From the time the horses
come out of the paddock gate to go <n
the starting post until the winning post
is passed Mr. Price never takes his eyes
off the bunch of horses and riders, and
the probabilities are that his presence In
the Httle box of a stand in the Inclosure
at Oakland will be exceedingly beneficial
to those who want to "get a run for their
coin M and correspondingly disastrous to
the dealers in "mackerels AllyQ _ ââ,,
Pat Dunne's stable with Ail>ar and
other good ones in it, will be rullj as

two years since, when Salvable. Preston

Harry Kuhl, *ho will act as associate
to Ed Smith in the judges' stand at Ingle
Â«l<V has been secretary of the Hawthorne
Association for several years. He has

A Disastrous Spree.
A Lagasetti, who keeps a lodging
house on Jackson street, near Montgom
ery avenue, started out with some
friends last n nt for "a little time.
After considerable indulgence in spiritu
ous liquors, the party became boisterous
and in a scuffle Lagasettl was hit on the
head by a cane in the hands of one of his
companions. He fell across the car
track at the corner or Kearny and Mont
gomery avenue, and was taken to the
Harbor Hospital. Upon his arrival there
it was found that his skull had been frac
tured but the officers think that the rail,
more than the blow, may have been the
cause. He was unconscious and little
hope is entertained of his recovery.
Circus Drawing Crowds.
The second performance of the great
VTaKnc* Circus took place last nijfht at
Central Park. The tents were packed to
suffocation and the audience went away
satisfied. The wonderful acrobatic work
of ilir N'rlnrn family will 3O.lt.Â»':tuta tho

anything of ilfl Kinn ever preit-nt^d on the
coast. Large crowds view tho animals
r ail> and take in the various side Hhovrs
when the lights in the main tents are ex
tinguished. The wild man is the prime
attraction in the annex. He is fed every
night on raw meat and tears it in his long
teeth with the avidity of a tiger. He is
kept in a large cage with shackles on his
limbs.

WEBB DEFEATS PALLAS
DR. C. C. DENNIS WINS THE
SENIOR SKIFP RACE.
Barge Race Between Dolphins and
Pioneers Results in Easy Vic
tory for the Long Bridge
Oarsmen.
Even on Saturday Guerneville was full
of visitors from Santa Rosa, Petaluma,
Healdsburg and other neighboring cities,
who thronged the grand stand and wes
terly bank of Lake Bohemia to view the
barge and skiff races and other aquatic
events arranged by the oarsmen of the
San Francisco Bay clubs.
The first event yesterday was a
Ihe first event on the programme was a
barge race between the Olympics, the
Dolphins and the Alamedas. The Ala
meda seniors had been victorious at El
Cainpo and Astoria, the Dolphins had
practiced more regularly and faithfully
than any of the crews, and the Olympics
were said by a knowing one to be the
coming winners. The Dolphins had the
center station, the Olympics the outside
and the Alamedas the inside. Pape set
a very fast stroke at the beginning, and
the Dolphins jumped away with the lead.
After about two-thirds of the course had
been covered all the crews took the inside
water and the race became a procession,
the Dolphins winning by three lengths
and the same distance separating the
Olympics and the Alamedas. The crews
were made up as follows and finished in
the order named: First, Dolphinsâ Victor
Cagliert, bow; F. Schwarting, No. 2; W.
O. Patch, No. 3; A. W. Pape, stroke, and
Ed Bartman, cockswain. Second, Olym
picsâF. Grim, bow; J. W. Morton, No. 2;
Paul Sturdivant, No. 3; H. Collins, stroke,
and Roy West, cockswain. ThirdâAla
meda Seniorsâ E. B. Hadcock, bow; W.
G. Hansen, No. 2; Atwell Webb, No. 3;
F. W. Ayers, stroke, and Ed Hansen,
cockswain.
The second event, a canoe race, be
tween J. S. Earls of the Dolphins, and
L. Hammersmith of the Olympics, was
won easily by the latter.
The third event, the junior skiff race,
brought out J. Pallas of the South Ends,
Bert Guiid of the Alamedas and Atwell
Webb of the Alamedas, the winner of
Saturday's heat. A. Webb won gomfort
ably by four or five lengths, J. Pallas
finished second and Bert Guild of the
A.amedas third.
The fourth event, the final heat of the
Senior Skiff race, brought out C. Ochs of
the Pioneers. Dr. C. C. Dennis of the
South Ends and Fred Ayers of the Ala
medas. On Saturday Ochs had beaten
tho South End representative, and yes
terday he led him for a considerable dis
tance, but. after a game struggle, Ochs
was passed by Dr. Dennis, who won a
fine race b>t about two lengths. F. Ayers
did not finish.
The skiff race was followed by a water
polo contest between the Lurline and
Olympic swimming clubs. The Lurline
team consisted of W. C. Pomin (captain).
H. A. Widemann, J. A. Geddes, 11. de
Lyons, E. Smith, P. Sheppard and S.
ilacdougall. The Olympic team was
made up of J. Cosgrave, C. Kreling, W.
Taylor, C. M. Connelly, A. W. Taylor.
Lester Hammersmith and J. A. Jackson.
The game consisted of two fourteen
minute halves, and was very closely con
tested. C. Krellng kept goal for the
Olympics in the first half and L. Ham
mersmith in the second half; H. A. Wide
mann was goal keeper for the Lurlines in
the first half. Both goal-keepers stopped
some clever throws for goal, and no score
was made on either side during the first
half; in the second half the Lurlines
scored one goal.
The sixth and last event on the pro
gramme was the most exciting, and the
one about the outcome of which the
most doubt was felt. The Pioneers were
a strong crew, while the Dolphins had
won their heat earlier in the afternoon
by a considerable margin. However, as
soon as the barges came in sight it was
seen that the Pioneers were rowing
strongly and had a long lead, while the
Dolphins were rowing a fast stroke, but
not pulling it well through. The Pioneers
won as they liked by ten lengths. In
justice to the Dolphins it should be said
that their stroke, A. W. Pape, was in
disposed and reaaly not fit to row, and
that the crew had already had a hard
race.
Dr. W. Cole placed his launch at the
disposal of the regatta officials, and
worked untiringly. The event is the first
one of its kind that has taken place
on Russian River, and If. as seems highly
probable, the regatta should become an
annual occurrence, better provision will
doubtless be made for the comfort of
oarsmen and visitors.

Bodies of Unclaimed Dead Muti
lated for the Latest
Fad.
"Every person who mutilates the dead body of a human being
â¢without the authority of law is guilty of felony."
"Any person who removes any part of the dead body of a human
being . ... without authority of law, or from malice or
wantonness, is punishable by imprisonment in the State's prison
not exceeding five years." y
tions 2SO and 291 of the Penal Code of California.
THAT women will accept of and I
use presents made from the cv- I
tide of their dead sisters is bo
foreign to ordinary feelings of hu- i
inanity that it almost passes belief, I
consequently all conditions of people j
who read the grewsome story in yester- j
day morning's Call were discussing the
horrible facts so plainly set forth.
That raw medical students, in their 'â 
callow stage and desirous of appearing
hardened to all feelings of humanity j
would do outre thing% was not beyond
the pale of credence, but that young ,
women, pets of society, nurtured in re- j
fined homes and surrounded with all
that would naturally fill their souls
with tenderness, would not only decor
ate their persons with the grewsome
relics of the charnel house, but would
gloat over the treasured bits of dead
humanity as so many rare curios
Beems almost beyond conception.
But facts are stubborn, and facts were
given in the story told by Mrs. Alice
Rix yesterday.
There is a traffic in human skin.
Perhaps not traffic In the sense of bar-
ter and sale for mercenary purposes,
but the bodies of indigent dead are mu
tilated in order that a society fad may
be subserved, and these bodies are paid i
for ostensibly to further the ends of
scientific investigations, but in reality
in order that the cuticle may be re
moved and given to young women for
the purposes of adornment.
Reputable jewelers admit that they
manufacture purses and belts from
leather made of human skin; tanners
gay that they prepare the skin as they
would that of a monkey or an alligator;
women pride themselves in the posses
sion of pieces of leather made from the
backs of other women who were so un
fortunate as to have died in a charita
ble institution.
In all circles yesterday these facts
were discussed, and condemnation in
terms of severest censure was the
unanimous verdict. But, at the same
time, there was a disposition on the
part of the members of the faculties of
the medical colleges to decry the story
and put it on the plane of fiction. That
SUICIDE IN A PADDED CELL
Charles Whitelaw, While Suffering From Delirium Tremens, Hangs Himself
in the Receiving Hospital.
nHARLES WHITELAW, a mid
dle-aged man who gave his ad-
I . dress as 313 Folsom street,
v-< walked into the Receiving Hos
pital Friday night about 8 o'clock.
He said he felt sick, and as it was
evident he was suffering from deli
rium tremer.s he was placed in a
padded cell in the insane depart
ment facing Larkin street.
Nothing unusual was observed in
his cell till yesterday morning about
6 o'clock, when Assistant Steward
Fogarty and Attendant Kellv went
to the cell with a cup of coffee for
"Whitelaw. Kelly was the first to
enter the cell, and he was surprised
to see Whitelaw hanging in the air.
Thinking Whitelaw was playing a
joke Kelly said sternly: "Come
down out of that," but in a second
he rushed out of the cell exclaim
ing: "The man is dead." He re
entered the cell with Fogarty, and
it was seen that Whitelaw had
nangod himself. He had torn his
blanket in pieces, which he had
plaited into a rope. Lifting a por
tion of the floor which is in sections
he placed it against the wall, and
standing on top he tied the rope
around the iron bar on top of the
grating on the south wall of the
cell. After fixing the noose round
his neck he Jumped into space. His
feet were about two feet from the
floor.
Kelly and Fogarty cut down the
body, which showed signs of
warmth, and carried it Into the op
erating room in the hospital. Dr.
r war, ca'lr-d. and he pro
nounced lifr- extinct. The body was
sent to the Morgue.
Whitflaw was an unmarried man
and ha'! lived at 313 Fol?r>m street
â me time. He was formerly a
fireman at the City Hall, and later
was employed at the Corporation
jrardfl by the Flro Department. Re
cently he has been working for the
Keystone Boiler Works. Friends of
the deceased say that he was not a
hard drinker and are surprised to
the story is true The Call has every
evidence. It is possible that the offl*
rials of the colleges are unaware of the
facts, but if they are desirous of mak
ing an investigation, as they say they
will do, they need but extend their in
quiries to the business houses men
tioned in The Call and they will find
every statement made by Mrs. Rlx
borne out by a reputable business man.
Dr. Henry Gibbons Jr., dean of
Cooper Medical College, was seen yes
terday ar.d emphatically denied all
knowledge of the practice and said:
"I do not believe a word of it. It is
all imagination."
When he was told that The Call had
in its possession portions of the tanned
skin as evidence and was further re
ferred to the interview with a reputable
man whose business it is to tan leather
in which it is stated: "I have been
tanning human skin for medical stu
dents for two years. It is easy to get.
Ask a medical student for it," he said:
"I did not think we had such fools in
our college."
He was assured that The Call had
evidence that students of both the
Cooper and Toland Medical colleges
had been in the habit of haviner Dieces
of human skin tanned, and was asked
if it were not possible for this to be
done without the knowledge of the
faculty.
"We, of course," said he, "have bodies
to dissect. This work is done under a
demonstrator of anatomy. It is against
the rules for a student to remove even
a small piece of any subject. The law
allow us our pro rata of the unclaimed
dead of all public institutions. This Is
much better than the old custom of
students stealing dead bodies. We try
to keep the dissectin- room in the back
ground as much as possible, but dissec
tion is an absolute essential to a thor
ough knowledge of surgery or medicine.
We have in college always a class of
students in the verdant age who think
such grewsome things as this are
smart. They lose any sense of decency
they may have been born with. If a
student in any way whatever mutilates
or carries away any portion of a body
he is dissecting he knows well that he
offends against the laws of the colleee
as well as every law of decency and so
i clety. And what sort of woman is it
| that wears such belts or carries such
a purse?"
"Why, apparently decent, sweet

to the hospital. They can give no
reason for his Bulcide, as he had a

SELECTING THE SKIN BEFORE DEATH SETS HIS SEAL.
girls."
"They must be mentally and morally
depraved and of the very lowest grade
of character."
"But do you not think the boys are
just as bnd?"
"One expects more of women. I can
not expel them from society. I wish I
could er-el every girl or woman who
not only herself wears but counte
nances any one who dees wear in any
form, tanned human skin. We can reach
the students. A vigorous investigation
will be gone into at once. I shall bring
the matter before the faculty and pros
ecute it. Any student who is found to
have used, carried away or in any man
ner misappropriated even the smallest
portion of human skin â''A be expelled."
This, then, is the present condition.
The "unclaimed dead," the indigent
poor who die in the Almshouse, in the
orphan asylums, insane asylums and
penal institutions and whose friends
are unable or unwilling to see that the
corpse has decent burialâ these are dis
number of friends who would have
helped him out of any trouble which
might have been worrying him.
tributed "pro rata" to the medical col
leges and by them sold to the students
for scientific purposes. These scientific
Investigations are carried on "by au
thority of law." and are supposed to be
carried on under the guidance of a
demonstrator. This is the contempla
tion of the law. The interests of hu
manity are subserved through the
learning acquired by the students.
But to such an extent have the ends
of the law been misplaced that not only
medical students but young physicians
make th-ir selections in the hospitals
even before death sets his seal on the
one who is to be "unclaimed dead."
Even though the practice nullifies the
object of the law it Is continued. The
law contemplates the use of the bodies
of the "unclaimed dead" for scientific
purposes, yet when the cuticle Is re-
moved the inteeuments beneath are at
once rendered unfit for the purpose to
â which it is to be annlied.
Three physicians who were seen yes
terday replied in substance: "You can
have a good piece of skin from a hu
man body inside of twenty-four hours."
Dr. N. D. Robertson said: "Yes. I
can get you a fine piece. This is not a
very good time for not many of the stu
dents are dissecting now, but I can get
you a piece."
The medical students have access to
th City and County Hospital, and it
is no false t mmise which one made to
his fiancee recently:
"When a good skin comes In (I know
of one now at the County Hospital) I
will get you enough for a belt, purse
and card case."
"Do you really know the woman?"
"Yes. She has red hair, and the skin
Is smooth and fine and young. It will
mnkf a fine piece of leather."
While the law permits the use of
bodies of the "unclaimed dead" for
scientific purposes and for the good of
humanity there is another portion of
the law which deals directly with the
inhuman traffic which has grown up
among the students. Chapter VI, sec
tion 290, of the Penal Code of Califor
nia says: "Every person who muti
HE PAWNED THE WATCH.
Alexander Donovan Makes a State-
ment of the Death of Mrs.
Berry.
Alexander Donovan, the young man
whose name was connected with the
death of Mrs. Barry, yesterday made a
statement to Detectives Egan and Silvey.
After recounting their trip from Sacra
mento Donovan said that he and Mrs.
Barry took the flat on Anthony street.
She seemed despondent and sought to
drown her sorrows in the "flowing bowl."
According to Donovan's statement she
drank the contents of several bottles of
whisky from the time they occupied the
flat until death ended the debauch. In ex
planation of how he became possessed of
her jewelry the young man said that Mrs.
Barry had presented him with the ring
and watch and ordered him to pawn the
diamond pin. which he did. He also
pawned the watch, receiving $3, wnlch he
spent in liquor. It is expected that Don
ovan will be released to-day, as the detec
tives have nothing against him upon
which to base a charge.

The twenty-second annual picnic and
field day of the San Francisco Athletic
Club was held yesteruay at Shell Mound
Park. The attendance was good and the
dancing was kept up until the last train
left Berkeley at 11 o'clock at night. A
large number of gate prizes were given
to those who held winning tickets. Late
in the afternoon the club and its guests
repaired to the ampitheater, where there
were a dozen races for members and
open races. Over twenty prizes were
given to the winners of these contests.
Considerable amusement was caused by
the greased pig race, the prize being me

By the Sad Sea "Waves.
Mathews and Bulger, two of the fun
niest men on the American stage, come on
at the Columbia to-night In "By the Sad
Sea Waves," and if these two versatile
actors live up to the reputation that they
established in "Gay Coney Island," San
Francisco theater-goers are to have a
week of most excellent farce comedy. It
will be the first presentation of the r>ia"
In this city, and for its initial appearance
Mathews and Bulger, under the direction
of Dunne and Riley, have selected the
cleverest support to be had. Among the
notables in the cast are Nellie Hawthorne,
Josie de Witt, Marie Twohey, Bob Ver
non and Gus Mortimer.
"By the Sad Sea Waves," like "Gay
Coney Island," was written upon lines
suggested by the two funny leading men,
lates â¢ * â¢ the dead body of a hu
man being without authority of law is
guilty of a felony."
Section 291 says: "Any person who
removes any part of the dead body of
a human being â¢ * * from malice or
wantonness is punishable by Imprison
ment in the State Prison not exceeding
five years."
The mutilation of a dead body of a
human being with the "authority of
law" undoubtedly means the proper dis
section of subjects under the guidance
and tuition of regularly constituted in
structors. But when these subjects are
mutilated for the purpose of pleasing
the fair friends of the student then the
mutilation comes under the head of
"wantonness" and the perpetrator be
comes liable under the law to severe
punishment. Nor does the law hold
guiltless those who have aided and
abetted the sacrilege, for it specifies
equal punishment to all participants in
the crime.
The status of the case, so far as the
investigations of The Call are con
cerned, Is that students and physicians
get pieces of human skin for their
friends; reputable tanners prepare this
skin Into durable leather; jewelers
work this leather into card cases,
purses, belts and covers for bags; at
least one large manufacturing shoe
house has made shoes from human
skin; young society women carry the
purses and card cases and wear the
belts and shoes.
And the "unclaimed dead," the dead
of the unfortunate poor, the bodies of
men and women whose beings once pul
sated with the ho-pes and ambitions,
the loves and hates, the desires and as
pirations which even now animate the
souls of those who wear the grewsome
remnants of mortality, furnish the
means for satisfying society's latest
fad.
