majority of the Democratic voters of
the State. Thera was no other contest
ant for the place, his only rival having
withdrawn twenty-four hours before
the time of placing the names of
prospective candidates before the con
vention.
The nomination was by acclamation
and was the signal for an expression
of enthusiasm sufficiently emphatic but
not wholly In accord with what is
usually expected from a body of men
which was in perfect harmony as to
who should be the standard-bearer of
their party.
J. G. Maguire was placed in nomlria
tion by William H. Alford, chairman
of the Democratic State Central Com
mittee, a man who is presumed to be
in accord with the present principles
of the Democratic party and who is
supposed to be in touch with all of the
issues of the coming campaign. Hie
address, which is given here in full,
was a most happy one and touched on
such important subjects as will have
a material influence on the immediate
destiny of the party and its candidates.
Whether or not it was intended to be
so it will be taken as a declaration of
principles and the enunciation of
pledges the keeping of which will be
a matter for the care and attention of
Democratic voters.
The nomination of Judge Maguire
was seconded by United States Senator
Stephen M. White, Maguire's life-long
friend and political associate. He paid
a high tribute to the personal worth
and political career of Judge Maguire,
and gave something of the history of
the public life of the man whose name
will appear at the head of the Demo
cratic State ticket. He alfioitouchedupon
subjects relative to certain incidents
and acts of Maguire's recent career as
a legislator and a member of the Na
tional Congress. Some of these inci
dents and some of these acts bid fair
to cut an important figure in the cam
paign about to begin, and because of
this a relation of them by Senator
White becomes doubly interesting. This
address like that of Mr. Alford may
be taken in part as pledge of future
conduct, a guarantee of good faith and
a defense of those acts connected with
the important incidents surrounding
the beginning of the war with Spain.
For this reason, if no other, it will
form an interesting circumstance of the
events of to-day. It is given herewith
in full.

both these nominating addresses as
well as that which marked the appear
ance of Judge Maguire in the conven
tion hall and his formal acceptance of
the nomination that had been tendered
him are told in detail on other pages
of this paper. They will prove Interest

licans alike, and also may have some
passing interest for the Populists, or
at least that portion of them who have
joined with the Democrats in placing
the badge of leadership on the "Little
Giant."
ALFORD PLACES
MAGUIRE IN
NOMINATION
It Was Eloquent and Eulogistic
but Quite Ready
Made.
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the
Convention: I have the honor to propose
for your consideration a candidate for the
high office of Governor. The Democrats
of this State have conferred upon us a
great privilege, but in doing so they have
Imposed a grave responsibility. We are
about to select a general for the most
important political battle ever waged by
the people of California. It is tne first,
the imperative duty of every delegate in
this hail to cast aside as garments unflt^
for this presence, self-interest and fac
tional hate. Our duty is important, but
our path-way is plain. Behind us beams
the mellow lights of historyâ before us
gleam the camp fires of progress.
We must not act -without reflection, but
we must act without fear. Industrial free- j
dom is the only true object of govern
ment. Beyond its accomplishment, her
functions are lorniat, her problems are
solved. In this truth are to be found
both the origin of Democracy and the
origin of its discords. Call 1l by what
ever name you will, organize it into what
ever party you desire, clothe it in what
ever garb your fancy may dictate. Dem
ocracy ceases to be Democracy when it
has any other object than the industrial
freedom of mankind.
Democrats cannot differ up>n this, but
until they have agreed as to tne method
of attaining this end there will be dis
cord in Democratic organizations. For
as Christians, equally zealous, follow the
Cheat Author of their religion by dif
ferent ways, so the devotees of Democ
racy will disagree as to methods, while
their object is forever the same.
Great truths are parts of tne infinite.
Their reception by the finite minds of
men can neither be sudden nor regular.
They struggle for recognition, are de
flected by the atmosphere of environment
and appear from so many directions that
discords seem endless, harmony impossi
ble. This is the tiga of truth. It always
appears in disorder. Yet through this
disorder the eye that looks may behold
the beauty of arrangement, the ear that
lists may hear a perfect melody.
The fundamental trutn of Democracy,
that industrial freedom can and will be
accomplished, appears at times bo far
away that men lose hope in their at
tempts to reach it. But. gentlemen of the
convention, the time will never come
when they â will lose faith in the man
whom they are sure personific ; this truth.
Let him appear in the day of their pros
perity and happiness or in the night of
their poverty and despair, and by an im
pulse resistless as the power of truth
Itself they will rush to his standard and
follow him to the end.
In naming our leader we muff* not only
name a man who personifies this funda
mental truth of Democracy but we must
name a man whom the 'eople know per
sonifies this truth. We must name a
leader to whose hands the Democracy of
California is willing to Intrust its ban
ner. We must name a man who holds
the respect of every class, the confidence
of every faction. We must nominate a
man with whom Democracy is superior to
self, superior to friends, superior even to"
party. synonymous only with country.
We must nominate a man who is not a
Democrat because he votes tne Democrat
ic ticket, but who vote" the Democratic
ticket because he is a Democrat.
We must nominate a man whose life is
a challenge, whose record is a platform
and whose name Is an Inspiration. We
must nominate a man who is a Democrat
within himself, and if political parties
could be blotted out, if an his record
could be Bwept way, and he eouM rise
before us at this hour, his innate charac
ter would so shine out "That nature
might stand up and say to au the world
this Is a Democrat."
In this hour of commercial
gloom â in this midnight of indus
trial darkness â we must nomi
nate the man toward whom the
eyes of suffering thousands turn,
and in whom the light rays of pur
ified Democracy converge. Gen
tlemen of the convention, Demo
crats of California, I nominate
for the high office of Governor
the Honorable James G. Maguire.
Gentlemen of the convention, I know
by your applause that the man I have
named is your candidate. I might re
hearse his record, but eulogy stands mute
before its pure, white splendor. He is not
only your candidate: he is the candidate
of the majority of the Democrats of this
State; he is the candidate of the ma
jority of the voters of California.
Nominate him to-dayâ declare him the
choice of this convention, and then go
home, if you, will, and take no part in
the campaign. Retire to your farms,
your stores, your offices, your shops, and
never lift a hand from now until the 6th
of November. Surrender every fortress
and stronghold in the State. Construct
for him no breastwork and lift no shield
in his defense. Lay baTe his breast to
every shaft of corporate greed. Unloose
the filthy bloodhounds of monopoly.
Crowd the columns of every libelous and
blackmailing sheet with calumny and
lies. Hire the slander of every oratorical
prostitute that wallows in his own slime
at the feet of special privilege, and let
them concentrate their hell-born energy
upon the hero I have named, and you
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
will see the honest, grateful, patriotic,
liberty loving people of this State arise
In his defense, press forward as one man,
construct about him a human barricade
and follow him to battele and to victory.
But, Democrats of California, this will
not be your' course. From the moment
this convention adjourns you will conse
crate the energy and power with which
you are endowed to the noblest cause for
which mankind ran fightâ the cause of
human liberty. We have abolished chat
tel slavery in this country- At the price
of the life blood of a million white men
and billions: of treasure we set the black
man free, and yet we are fostering insti
tutions that are fastening upon white
men and black men alike a slavery that
is far more degrading, because It wears
upon its hideous face the mask of lib
erty. Industrial slavery is the offspring
of monopoly. It will perish when monop
oly is destroyed. We have achieved po
litical freedom; we have achieved relig
ious freedom. There is just one more
step to take, and across the banner of
Democracy, as it moves down the future,
I can read, in letters of living light, the
words. "Industrial freedom."
In the name of every enemy of trusts;
in the name of every foe of special privi
lege; in the name of every opponent of
monopoly; In the name of every cham
pion of industrial freedom; in the name
of Democracy in its highest, purest form.
I nominate for the office of Governor of
California the Hon. James G. Maguire.
HE STANDS
SPONSOR FOR
HIS FRIEND
Senator White Warmly Approves
the Nomination of the
Judge.
Gentlemen of the Convention:' It is
a Bubject of deep regret to mo that
I am unable, upon this most lra2
SOME VERY RAW PROGRAMMING
portiint and auspicious occasion, to ex
presfl my views to you am forcibly as I
might were I in ray ordinary physical con
dition, but I cannot permit this moment
to pass without seconding the nomina
tion of a man whom 1 have known from
his earliest childhood, whom I have fol
lowed in his early years, ana whom I
have seen pass from one place to an
other, until to-day he is superlatively en
deared in the hearts of the people of Cali
fornia.
For Governor, what do the people of
California desire? Do they wish an honest
aian?
A voice â Yes.
Senator Whiteâ lf so, they have that
man in James G. Maguire. Do they wish*
a man who has familiarized himself
with the interests of the people? If they
do, they have that man in James G. Ma
guire. From his childhood to his present
proud position he has been an honest, an
intelligent and an honorable toiler, ever
moving onward, ever moving upward.
Do they wish a man who has had ex
perience in public affairs? If they do,
.they lind that man in James G. Maguire.
Elected when he was but little more
than a boy to the legislative councils of
this , State, almost his native . State, he
performed those, duties. in that period of
comparative inexperience so that they
r^Ss' unchallenged to-day, and are this
moment the subject of. encomium. He
did not stop there. He showed that he
.bad legislative ability. Later on he was
chosen to the bench. Do the people of
California wish a man occupying the po
sition of Governor who possesses Judicial
attainmentsâ ability to weigh this
cause and that cause, this man and that
man, and to honestly enter a judgment
intelligently based upon the evidence be
fore him? If they do, they have that man
in Jam os G. Maguire. He was upon the
Superior bench in the city and County of
San Francisco for years. Ho adorned
that bench. I have heard many a lawyer
who dissents in toto from his political
views and from our -political views say
that if Judge Maguire were a candidate
for Judge he would vote for him in a
minute, because he knew that he was
able; that he was just; that he was clear
headed. and that he was competent to
discharge that most onerous, perhaps, of
all duties imposed upon American citi
zens. â  :
Furthermore, do you wish a man who
has experience beyond the limits of the
State of California, and has a proper con
on of the constitution of the nation
and of its bearings upon the Slate and
its relations to all those many avenues
through which public duties flow, which
are, to some extent, represented in na
tional affairs? If bo, you find that man,
too, in James G. Maguire. Elected, elect
ed and elected, never possible to be de
1. to the Congress of the United
-. he presents upon the national
escutcheon a proud and a stainless rec
ord. (Applause.)
In the council halls of this nation he
has been the defender of h's State and
the advocate of her interest. In that
council hall when national matters were
before â  he stood the defender of
thÂ«r public Interest, regardless of sedition,
locality "f special privilege. Who above
him stood In the Congress of the nation
in the matter o< the defense of the peo
leroachments of monopoly
and the influence of the railroad power?
No one. No one challenges his record.
No nni> doubts his pre-eminence. No one
questions his manly work, or the hpnesty
of his expressions ;<nd the ability of nts
vii w.-: which hi- th'-re announced. Fel
low citizens, is there anything in his per
eonal character which can be u.-':;au!ted?
For we must have a man stainless in the
performance of public duties, a power in
his persdfcal relations. No human being
In the midst of a fierce conflict and wild
ti cf party Btruggle will ever im
pugn honestly the personal or private
character of James G. Maguire.
These are rot ornate phrases. They
i.r>' not culled extracts of classical ex
pression, but they are the didactic facts
of solemn proof, which are presented to
the people of this State and upon which
we demand an issue, and regardless of
which we pledge ourselves to maintain
our case without any dispute in the evi
dence. Fellow citizens, some have callea
this .a mere ratification meeting, and our
political opponents have been wont to
pay. as they will hereafter assert, that
we' are following in the lines of the Popu
irty, and are submitting to its dic
tation because we nominate Judge Ma
guire. Mr. President, the Populist party,
the honest men within Its ranks find the
able and true men within its ranks who
votÂ»d for Judge Maguire knew that he
was a Democrat, and they knew no
Democrat in California but him would be
nominated in a Democratic convention.
(Applause. Â»
The sentiment of the people had been
recorded and little credit is to you or to
me for merely expressing our views
here for we could not do otherwise and
be loyal and faithful to those who sent
us here. Let the returns speak. Maguire
is a candidate, not particularly of a party
and not particularly cf an individual.
True he is a Democrat and we are pooud
to follow him. but he is a candidate of
the people of the State of California. <Ap
p!-use > And if all the conventions nomi
nate him. as they ail should, we cannot
be blamed or censured, nor can he be
impugned because ot that fact.
Mr Chairman, we will make th.s a con
test upon which every man can make a
fight We will make it upon his record,
Btate and national, and will make it per
haps upon the pre-eminent proposition
that heis a loyal and a true son of Cali
fornia and in the executive office will
honestly, economically, impartially and
democratically administer the solemn
trust submitted to his keeping. No dan

ger that we will be led away through the J
false influences and extraneous causes of
the peculiarities of present conditions.
We are told that the Republican party
must elect everybody from Governor to
Constable because the United States have
been successful in the war. The people
have fuught the war principally. (.Ap
plause.) On the land and sea, where our
flag has been carried, every soldier and
every sailor has performed hlsduty. "\V hen
the ennoke of battle and the doings of di
plomacy have passed away -we will find
who is responsible for the old coats and
the misfit shoes which have been palmed
off on the brave soldiers of the nation.
(Applause.)
Meyer has a soldier or sailor. Democrat,
Republican or Populist, or whatever else
he may call himself, been disloyal or
failed xr> perform his duty. If there have
been any failures they have been made
in the official circles, for which circles
the Democracy is not responsible. (Ap
plause.) The time will come when these
matters will be investigated, and they
will be pretty well understood by the
American people before election day.
There are many things, incidental and
collateral, regarding this struggle upon
which we do not all agree. But when the
great conflict was inaugurated there was
no dissent. Democrats differed in Con
gress, and Judge Maguire differed from
Congress, and so did I, as to the bill
which was passed regarding the
collection of the war tax. Why
did we differ upon it? We proposed
o measure to equalize taxation and to
make that wealth to which the blood of
the soldier and the sailor contribute fur
nish Its just quota toward the mainten
ance of the war. Upon the floor of the
Senate of the United States, and there
was no such power upon the floor of the
House to do anything, I succeeded in im
posing a Email tax upon the Standard Oil
Company and upon the sugar trusts. I
did not get but seven votes from the Re
publican side. (Applause.) And yet they
said that they were justified in their act
because they put thirty millions of money
upon beer, thirty millions upon tobacco,
and more than that upon proprietary

MAGUSRE'S PLAN OF ACTION
He Will Speak First to the Silver Re
publicans of LoSr Affgeles.
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: 1 have not
yet decided upon either the time or the place
of opening the campaign. We will probably
open it formally about the Ist of September. 1
am going to Los Angeles next week, upon the
invitation of the Silver Republican State Cen

their State convention, and will probably
speak there on August 27. Beyond that our
plans for the campaign have not been formed.

medicines and kindred things. They said
those are luxuries and they ought to pay
the tax. The man who takes a glass of
beer ought to have the tax double,
whereas the drinker of champagne can
rest upon the patriotism which he haa
manifested in retrospect.
Beer is a luxury and why cannot the
toilers get along without it, our friends
said. Tobacco! Why should a man chew
tobacco, tho filthy weed? j.c is a luxury,
our Republican friends told us. Luxury!
A man digging in fcue streets of your city
making it possible for you to get water
and gas, making your sewer connections,
toiling day by day under the hot. sun, the
sweat of his brow wetiing the arid soil,
chews his tobacco. It is a luxury and
you need not chew it unless you want to.
Fellow citizens, it is our opinion that
the tax was not justly distributed. We
thought there should be a general tax
upon the great corporations or this coun
try, and we proposed to levy it. We were
defeated, not by Democratic votes, save
for a very few, but by the Republicans,
the solid Republican column. As I have
.â¢ilready said, and I repeat now, when
we presented a single amendment direct
ed at the Standard Company and the
sugar trusts, then there were a few Sen
ators who were compelled to yield be
cause they could not face their constitu
ents, but the Republican majority stood
up like one man and refused to tax those
great industries.
I introduced an amendment to assess
the great Si eping-cars of the country, to
assess their gross receipts. ., lt was amend
ed requiring them to put a tax on the
tickets they Bold, and to pay for that
tax themselves. Inat was an exception.
Gentlemen, the great telegraph corpora
tions pay nothing. You are assessed for
telegrams, and when you go to send your
dispatch away, they congratulate you
upon your patriotism. (Applause.) Yet
you will hear Republican orators, during
this campaign, charge that tne Demo
cratic party was inimicable to the war
because it refused to vote for that bill.
"We had a measure of our own which was
defeated and we voted for the other.
"When the President called for* supplies,
whenever he asked for appropriations,
however large, we gave it to him. We
submitted to the elimination . of the river
nnd harbor bill, though it-was important
to all, in order that money I might be
contributed to the public, .cause:' The
great triumph that we have met- "will â¢ go

the achievements" of this war with 1 Inde
scribable pride.. To. me the greatest tri

the mere destruction of the foe and the

a,s the result of money. He died a rich
young man, that man with powerful sur
roundings, that man who nad no need
to go to war, who might have hired, as
young Astor, a battery and regiment, and
have destroyed the Spanish with them.
He died for "the cause of his country and
for liberty, and whether he was worth
one hundred or two hundred millions of
money, he contributed more ti the Amer
ican people to make it greater in its dis
tinction and greater in futurity than does
he who lived a thousand years. Of these
farts we all know. No partisan can dis
fuiae them, no partisansnlp can destroy
hem. No partisanship can doom them.
Tiny am a common heritage. They be
long to us all. I know how an attempt
will be made to make use of the g^eat
national events. Finally I repeat I sec

lence, and let us meet him once more in

were proposed and Hven in a hearty
manner.
Mayor Phelanâ Mr. Chairman and gen
tlemen of the convention, as a member of
your committee to escort Judge Maguire
to this platform, it is a matter of espe
cially great gratification for me to say
tnat" the principal service which Judge
Maguire has given to the State of Cali
fornia has affected largely the interest
i of the city and county which I in part
represent. There Judge Maguire was sent
i to the Assembly; there he was elevated
1 to the Superior bench, and from the
I Fourth Congressional DiÃtrict. with ever
1 increasing majorities, he was sent by a
' grateful and enthusiastic people to the
; halls of Congress. He has distinguished
himself in this, that as a public servant
:he has always served the public. [Loud
applause.] There is but one test which
we require of our public men, and that is
i that they shall serve the interests of the
j jjpqplfij and that i& what has mÂ»dÂ« Judge
Magulre conspicuous among our citizens.
Coming from the bay, we of San Fran
cisco thank tne convention for this recog
nition which it has given to its foremost
son and raised him to the highest pinna
cle within the gift of the pÂ»ople of the
State. I verily believe, so strong am I
convinced of the justice of -his cause in
the consciences of the people,' of his in
tegrity and fidelity to public â¢ trusts, - that
he will be elected the next Governor of .
the State ,of California. Gentleman, : your â

Judge Maguire stepped . forward amid
vociferous applause and cheers and said:
Mr. Chairman, fellow i-cD?ai > >crats,
members of the Democratic* atmJi con
vention, I thank you for the' great honor
which you have conferred i '^on me. I
feel a sense of personal Gratitude which
I cannot express to you in! words.,. I know
the answer expressing Imy gratitude
which you expect, and theft, is that I shall
be faithful to the trust Â»vhich you have
reposed on me; that I shall carry your
standard unsullied either to victory or to;
defeat in the coming campaign, without
flinching and without hesitation. | That. I
shall endeavor to do, with all earnestness
and all the energy of my life. I have had
the privilege, through the courtesy of the
committee on platform and. resolution, to
read the platform, which you have adopt
ed, and I say, after a careful reading,
that I indorse its every plank; â¢ that I
shall in the approaching campaign <do
everything In my power to vindicate its
principles and its declared purposes, and
after the campaign is over, and I shall
be charged with the ..execution .of its
promises as I believe I will (.loud ap
plause), I will endeavor faithfully to com
ply with the promises which you have
made therein to the people.. I can give
no further assurance of what I will do
in that behalf than to say that in all my
public career I have endeavored faithful
ly to comply with every promise that I
have made to the people; that 1 have en
deavored to do so earnestly and energeti
cally. In addition to saying that I In
dorse the platform, I am pleased to .say
that in the platform I find set forth some
of the most important principles and pur
poses, relating to the interests of the peo
ple of California, to whom I have been
devoted, during the whole period of my
public service in the past, and to which I
will be glad to devote myself in the fu
ture. I am pleased with the enthusiastic
spirit of patriotism manifested in the
opening planks of the platform, in the ab- '!
solutely unpartlsan recognition of the j
glory and the . honor of American man
hood displayed in the. war that has just
closed. (Applause.) -
I sharo In the sentiments of gratitude
and gratification expressed in the plat
form of the heroic services of our soldiers
and sailors in giving their lives, their
blood and their service for our flag and
our country promptly, bravely, enthu
siastically upon ' the first call In her
hour of emergency. (Prolonged ap
plause.) I shall not at this time attempt
to review the platform. I would not de
tain you in the great work which you
are here to perform, and which you have
so well performed up to this hour, ex
cepting of course the particular part of
the work to which I am here to respond.
(Laughter.) But I desire to touch briefly
upon one or two propositions in the plat
form. The great Democratic platform of i
1896, which you have specifically indorsed
and whose planks you have reaffirmed,
Was a declaration of war upon monopoly
such as had not previously been put forth
by any great political party in this coun
try. Tne platform adopted by this con
vention to-day presents propositions for
the detailed execution of a very import
ant portion of the Chicago platform. It
presents, in my "opinion, the principles
upon which the great question of railroad
monopoly must be settled throughout the
Union. If chosen as the chief executive of
the State I will take particular delight in
devoting my energies to the execution of
that plank of the platform. (Applause
and cheers.) It presents no mere theory.
It presents no proposition for mere ex
periment. It presents a well considered
plan which has been practically executed
fn one State of the American Union where
the Democratic â¢ party has practically
solved the railroad monopoly problem. . I
refer to the State of Texas (applause)
and to the 'glorious fight that was,, made
there for the principles which you have
laid down in the Railroad Commission
plank of your platform to-day. The
plank relating to the refunding, of the :
debts of the Central - Pacific .Railroad;
I will- deal with, of course, through
out the campaign- 1 Your plank upon that
question specifically represents my views
In your criticism of the war revenue bill
you have presented a proposition of
equity which no man, whatever may be
his political views, can answer. : â¢â¢_*'â â¢â 
The war revenue bill of the Republican
majority in the national Congress was a
measure such as never before found sup
port In' a legislative-body -representing
popular : sovereignty. ;It was, more than
any other piece of legislation of which
I have any knowledge, a measure of
class favoritism avowedly Intended- to
levy the ' burdens of the cost :of the war
upon the masses of the people to the ex
! ' emption of ' the accumulated wealth ; â  and
! great incomes of the country. It will not
! -be -defended and it cannot be. Upon all
other questions relating to the war I am
pleased to say that a common j sentiment
of patriotism prompted Democrats, Re
publicans and Populists in Congress to
act without regard for party differ
ences, to support our armies in the field,
our navy upon the seas, and to uphold
I every hand that was rais.ed for the de
fense of our country in its crisis, but in
levying taxes to pay the expenses of the
war this class-favoring measure was pre
sented, which could not receive the sup
port o* Democrats. Those who opposed
'(â W^kU vindicate their positions before the
I am gtad fhat in mnneetioa with this
platform, presenting great principles and
purposes to which every lover of his coun
try should be devoted, this convention has
recognized the patriotic duty of the re
form forces that were united in solid pha
lanx behind William J. Bryan in the
campaign of 196 (Applause and cheers)
to stand united again upon terms of hon
orable co-operation in the campaign that
is impending.
In all that I shall do in this campaign
I will endeavor faithfuly to follow the
spirit in that behalf which you have
manifested here to-day, and carryfng the
standard of my own party in the cam
paign as you have entrusted it to me. I
will endeavor to treat our allies in thi3
war against monopoly with all the cour
teous consideration and with every hon
orable regard to which they are so well
entitled in consideration of the sacrifices
which they, in common with this great
body of representatives of the Demoeraey
of California, have made for the purpose
i of union on behalf of the popular inter-
I est instead of dividing the votes of the
I masses of the people and braving the
common enemy to triumph. (Prolonged
AND A POPULIST, TOO.
Maguire Formally Accepts the Pinto
Platform and Nomination.
Call Headquarters, Sacramento, Aug. 18.â
Congressman Maguire was formally notified to-night
by the fusion committee of the Populists, the chairman
and secretary of the Populist convention and the
chairman and secretary of the Populist State Conven
tion that he had been nominated by the Populists for
Governor.
Burdett Cornell of Alameda, who acted as spokes
man for the committee, reviewed at great length the
aims and objects of the Populist party. He said that
the party was composed of men who had left the
rank and file of the Democratic and Republican parties
because the essential principles of democratic govern
ment were not then to be found in either party.
"Since the time the Populist party was organ
ized," said Cornell, "the Democratic party had com
pletely changed in its platform of principles." In con
clusion, Corneil said the Populists believed that
Maguire was the logical candidate to represent the
reform forces in the coming campaign.
Judge Maguire, in reply, went into a lenrtv
dissertation concerning the railroad Question and ques
tions of taxation. He said that heTgd carefully read
the platform of the Populist party and that he agreed
with it in all the planks renting v to the functions of
government. He said in' conclusion that he would
accept the platform, and if elected Governor will carry
out all the promises made in it. In conclusion, he
promised to forward his letter of acceptance to the
chairman of the State Central Committee before Sunday.

great evidence of yuur confidence, for the
great honor which a nomination by ac
clamation at the hands of such a splen

to me, and I shall not forget that I hold
that great honor in sacred trust In exe

PAUL P. AUSTIN.
Bea Will Swap Everything to Make
Him Secretary of State.
SAN JOSE. Aug. IS.â The Rea delega
tion to the Republican State Convention
voted solidly this afternoon to work for
Paul P. Austin for Secretary of State.
Everything else is to be sacrificed, and
the gubernatorial candidate who aids the
gang in this move will receive the deleÂ«
gation's votes. By putting Austin in as
Secretary of State Rea hopes to increase
his power and become a State boss.
This was agreed upon at a meeting of
the delegates this afternoon. Thirty-one
of the thirty-three delegates were pres
ent, and the two absentees are strong
Austin men. O. A. Hale was elected
I chairman and George T. Dunlop of Gilroy
secretary. The session lasted some time
' and the various candidates for Governor
were freely discussed.
A motion instructing the delegates to
â¢work in- every way honorable for the
nomination of Secretary of State for Su
pervisor Paul P. Austin was adopted
unanimously. This was Rea's only wish,
and the delegates obeyed the dictate or
the boss like lambs.
.. The delegation will leave for Sacra
mento next Monday morning in a body.
â Headquarters will be opened and a mart
established. Trading will be conducted
on all sides and empty promises given to
further Austin's chances. The boss is
certain of his man being nominated and
elected "and does not think Curry will be
a formidable opponent.
Rea is for Loud for Congressman, and
it is said that thirty out of the thirty
three delegates are inclined that way.
For Governor Lon Brown is the strong
est among the delegates, while Pardee
and Gape have a few followers. But if
any of the candidates will assure Rea of
support sufficient to nominate Austin he
will get thf> thirty-three votes.
Rea's delegates have all received thÂ«
following letter from Pardee:
OAKLAND. Aug. 15, 1898.
Dear Sir: I see that you have been selected
as delegate from your county to the State
convention. As you may perhaps know, I am
an aspirant for the nomination for Governor,
and will take with me to the convention a
solid delegation from Alameda County, con
sisting of 68 delegates. If you are not other
wise committed, I should like to have you
consider me in making up your mind as to your
choice for Governor before the convention.
Yours, etc., GEORGE C. PARDEE.
Rea and his men are confident of being
seated in the convention, and ridicule the
idea that the contesting Good Govern
ment League delegates will cause them
any trouble. Nevertheless, the Good Gov
ernment people will be on hand and put
up a good fight. Affidavits and witnesses
will be taken with them to substantiate
their charges of the grossest frauds at

Disreputable Trick of Mayor Phelan
to Defeat Judge Conley of Madera
by Falsely Stating the Vote.
: CALL HEADQUARTERS, Sacramento.
Aug. IS.â This has been an eventful day
. In the history of the Democratic party of
California.
It has witnessed the final passing of
Gavin McNab, the whispering boss of
San Francisco Democracy; the stepping
down of Mayor Phelan. also of San Fran-
Cisco, from his high perch on the pedes
tal of political purity and his acceptance
of the methods of a ward politician; the
â : attempt of a great political party to pre
vent young and honest men from having
!. a place in the plan of party leadership,
the futile attempt of the Examiner to
dictate the affairs of the party; the lin
ing up of the honest country Democrats
against the corrupt political organiza
tions of the three principal bosses of the
State, and the banishment of Senator
Braunhart.
â¢ : From the list of events as enumerated
'there has been omitted the fact of the
. ' nomination of James G. Maguire as the
candidate of the Democratic party for
â â¢" "Governor. This was not an incident
": either unexpected or particularly impor-
t ant. For two months past it had been
â  knpWn that Maguire would be the noml
; nee of this convention for the place at the
.head of the ticket. The formal tender of
â¢ the nomination was made to-day without
â pomp or circumstance as was to be ex
â  pected, because the facts had become
patent to even the uninitiated, and had
. been heralded again and again from one
end of the State to the other. Besides
â the Populist State mountebank slipped in
â¢aforetime and stole the Democratic plun
â¢ der. Thus it is that the nomination %f
IJMaguire was not an event â merely a cir
cumstance.
But there were other things and plenty
of them that are destined to occupy a
prominent place in Democratic history.
Chief among these, perhaps, was the final
passage of Whispering Gavin McNab.
F6r many months this personality had
been a disturbing factor in Democratic
politics, and his attempt to gain control
vf the Demecrattc organization of the
. metropolis and of the State and turn
. .it to hi.s own use had been matters
of much political importance. Me desired
to be, besides dictator, the nominee of
the party for Congress from the Fourth
Congressional District. His wish to oc
â¢ cup'y a seat in the. halls of the American
tops was due, he said, to a desire to
â¢purge hfms?lf from the accumulated tilth
fathered from his political associations.
â¢ 'To-day another man received the nomi
n WWcb he coveted. The Fourth
Congressional District Convention has
:; James H. Barry as its candidate
for Congress, and thp Whispering Boss is
left, free to pursue his devious ways and
cover his political character with addi
tional coatings of filthâ it bfing presumed
that he will not change his associations.
Yesterday McNab's friends took a poll
of the Fourth Congressional District's
delegates and found that his friends were
â '-. not sufficiently numerous therein to make
in certainty of his nomination in case his
name was presented to the convention as
a candidate. MeNab then announced his
intention to withdraw his name from the
list of prospective candidates, the fact of
this announcement being told exclusively
in yesterday's Call.
. When this became known Barry's
friends went to McNab and made the re
quest that if the Whispering Boss with-
drew his candidacy be should throw his
â strength to Barry. This McNab declined
to do as the fight between himself and
â  Barry for the nomination had been an
extremely bitter one. Barry then an
nounced his intention cf fighting McNab
on every proposition the latter advanced.
This morning: the latter sent for Bar
ry's- manapers and proposed to compro
mise. He said that he wished to receive
.ia vindication at the hands of his party,
. Â©.rid in order to make it apparent to the
public that he had vindicated himself it
would be necessary for him to receive
the nomination for Confess in order that
he mipht decline to accept, thus proving
that he was not actuated by ulterior
â motives In his desire to be the boss of
the Democratic party. In order to re
ceive the nomination he would have to
receive a majority of the votes of the
district convention delegates, and In or
der to do this he proposed that Barry
Jond him sufficient support to Insure him
the nomination, he on his part promising
to decline the acceptance of the honor.
The nomination would then, of course, I
.. go to Barry. McXab would be vindicated !
and Barry win the nominatioon without
the trouble of a contest. This programme
waa faithfully carried out, and it may be
that there are a few delegates present j
here in Sacramento who are not aware
of the fact and who are now laboring
under the delusion that McNab is aÂ« pure
as an anpel, and Barry a very lucky man.
The circumstance of Mayor Phelan's
fall from th<- hiph plane of political pur
ity was connected with the nomination of
the candidate for Associate Justice of the
me Court. Yesterday the Mayor
an ;i'!i]r<--ps V> the convention that
well received that there were

he would four yf-ars from now be the
standard bearer of the Democratic party.
To-day he descended to the lower levels
qf political chicanery-, and as a result the
jirophoirr-s (,f yesterday are without pre
judice. The Mayor's undoing was due to
id, effort on the pan of the San Fran
elsco Examiner to force the convention
fÂ» select Judge Jeremiah V. Coffey as Its
â¢jandidate for Supreme Judge. The Ex
aminer. forced him to enter into the fight,
and in !;ls efforts to Influence the conven
tion against its own will the Mayor re

It is sometirres true that all signs fail
In a Democratic convention. For days
and weeks and months there have been
rumblings and mutterings and open de
nunciations of the fusion agreement, and
yesterday some of the Congressional Dis
trict conventions openly rebelled against
the proposed combination with the Peo
ple's party.
.So ominous were the signs that Chair
man Alford of the State Central Com
mittee, the most radical exponent of fu
sion in the convention, predicted that
there would likely be much trouble to
day when the fusion agreement came up
for recognition. But the anticipated
trouble did not eventuate. A diligent ap
plication of the whip over night served
to force the malcontents into line and
when the fusion agreement was placed
before the convention this morning it
was accepted without a murmur. The
spectacle of a Democratic convention
indorsing the nomination for Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court of Judge
Walter S. Van Dyke, a radical silver Re
publican, who has in times past de
nounced the Democratic party as an or
ganization of thieves, robbers and politi
cal outcasts was extremely edifying. So
It went all along down the line of nom
inees, here a Republican and there a Pop
ulist, the whole of them swallowed at
one gulp by the convention.
Whether or not the Democrats are suffl-
ttly complaisant to cast their votes for
Ã¼blicans or Populists at the polls next
ember remains to be seen. It is cer
, however, that the dose of to-day
a very bitter one, and though no
is of protest were spoken the wry
s that were made attested the reluct
> with which the fusion mixture was
llowed.
its was a bad day for the San Fran
cisco Examiner. It put forward Judge
Coffey as a candidate and that Kentleman,
who has the respect and confidence of
men of all political parties, and who has
been forced into the position lie occupies
to-day by the would-be managers of the
California Democracy, was relegated to
the shelf.
Early in the day the yellow sheet was
held up before the eyes of thj assembled
delegates and branded as a purveyor of
lies. The man who was the instrument of
; the paper's humiliation and who had also
I been the victim of its maJipnlty was J.
:J. Dwyer of San Francisco. In order to
i so influence the minds and tne votes of
the delegation the paper had announced
j that Dwyer was a tool of Boss Rainey
and the originator of a ache ie to fur
ther the private interests of that alleged
manipulator of San Francisco politics.
Dwyer addressed the convention to a
point of personal privilege and denounced
! the statements in the paper as base false
i hoods and proved his assertion by a state
ment of facts backed up by evidence
1 that was not to be controverted.
The manner in which this convention
' has been conduct Â«\ is illustrated by an
; incident that occurred to-day, and which
i was brought out by the request that the
report of the committee on permanent
organization and order of business be re
ferred back to the committee for amend
i men t. It appears that when the report
of the committee was made yesterday and
before permanent organization was ef
fected a number of motions were made
which were confusing to Chairman Cas
stn whose knowledge of parliamentary
law is somewhat limited. The motions
that were put by him were put in such
a manner that the motion of the report
of the committee on permanent organi
zation and order of business was laid on
tiif tuble. This was not discovered until
this morning.
When the discovery was made, it was
realized that the convention had been
proceeding with business when, as a mat
ter of fact, it had no chairman, no secre
tary and no existence. The timÂ»ly amend
ment madÂ© thlÃ morning remedied thlÂ«

defect, and by great good luck the busi
ness transacted prior to the discovery of
the error was not of sufficient Importance
to render the invalidity of the proceed
ings of any great moment.
The details of the manner In which the
Examiner - McNab - Phelan contingent
Bought to force the nomination of Judge
Coffey are Interesting, as they make plain
the reasons why the delegates from tho
interior arrayed themselves successfully
against the delegations from the larger
cities. After the first ballot had been ta
ken, great pressure was brought to bear
upon the delegates from Alameda, Los
Angeles and San Francisco, to force them
into line for Coffey.
Los Angeles had on the first ballot vot
ed solid for Judge Hughes of San Diego,
and Alameda and San Francisco had
been split up between the various candi
dates.
The San Francisco delegation had been
pledged by the Examlner-McNab crowd
to almost every one of the candidates in
return for supoprt In seating the San
Francisco delegation. After the second
ballot had been taken the Los Angeles
delegation held a caucus. George S. Pat
ton, chairman of the delegation, started
that he was not In favor of changing the
vote from Judge Hughes to some other
candidate.
Senator White said that while he was
opposed to the unit rule it had been plac
ed on the delegation and it would have
to stand. A vote was taken and It was
decided to stand by Judge Hughes for
one more ballot. Before this ballot was
announced Judge Hughes released the
delegation and another caucus was herd.
Senator White announced that he was
In favor of having the vote of the dele
gation taken ,by roll call. He created a
sensation by stating that he had noticed
that within the past fifteen minutes every
railroad heeler he could see and whom he
had known for fifteen years was on the
floor fighting against Judge Coffey. This
statement had a decided effect and when
a vote was taken it was apparent ttiat
the pressure brought to bear by the Ex
aminer-McNab forces was having its ef
fect. _
When the "name erf Isidore B. Dock
weiler was reached that gentleman an
nounced that he desired to explain his
vote. John T. Gaffey made an objection,
but Dockweiler said: "Whether Mr. Gaf
fey desires it or not, I am going to ex
plain my vote. Three weeks before I was
elected a delegate to the convention I
pledged my support to Judge Conley.
Now Senator White comes forward with
a statement, or at least the intimation,
that the railroad company is Interesting
Itself in Conley's behalf. I have heard
enough of It. This railroad business is
making me very tired. 1 will cast my
vote and the two proxies which I hold for
Coffey. '"
When the result of the vote was an
nounced It was found that forty-two votes
had been cast for Coffey and thirty-eight
for Conley. The chairman was then in
structed to cast the eighty-one votes of
j the delegation for Coffey.
After the nomination of Ju.le"e Conley
had been made, a somewhat peculiar in
cident occurred. Mr. Dockweiler, who
had cast three votes for Coffey, walked
to the rear of the chairman's stand with
several friends. A discussion of the re
sult of the vote was entered into and Mr.
I Dockweiler was so affected that he ap
| peared to be upon the point of fainting.
j His friends succeeded in restoring him,
j but for a few moments the tears rolled
i down his cheeks and he appeared the pic
ture of despair.
While the third ballot was being taken
Mayor Phelan invited the San Francisco
delegation to caucus on the matter of
Judge Coffey'B nomination. They left
the convention hall with him and met in
the left wing of the building.
Mayor Phelan, speaking at considerable
length as to the strength Judge Coffey
would add to the ticket, Bald that he
thought It would only be paying him a
deserved compliment If he was given thÂ«
entire vote of the delegation.
Gavin McNab strenuously objected to
any such course. "While I respect Judge
Coffey as highly as any other delegate
here," said he, "it is not fair or Just to
the other candidates from the Interior to
cast a solid block of 154 votes against
them. You must remember, gentlemen,
that the country helped us out in our
fight, and If It was not for the support
received from the country delegates we
would not be sitting in this convention to
day."
Walter Gallagher, Mayor Phelan and
W. F. Stafford argued against the stand
taken by McNab and said that Judge Cof
fey would materially aid Judge Magulro
In his candidacy. They said they were
unable to see any reason why the coun
try delegates should In any way feel of
fended if the city delegates saw fit to
throw all their strength to him.
"I, for one," said L. Reavy, "desire to
say right here that I am opposed to a

was right and that they had slaughtered
Judge Coffey.
Jere Coffey, a nephew of Judge Coffey,
was displeased at the action of the dele
gation. "I do not see why the managing
editor of the Examiner should put Judge
Coffey in this false light," said he, "for
If Judge Coffey wanted the nomination he
would have had his name placed in nom
ination in regular form. I am not certain
that he would accept the nomination if it
was given to him."
All of the efforts of the would-be bosses,
however, proved fruitless, for soon as it
became apparent to the country delegates
that the city delegates were combining to
force the nomination of Judge Coffey they
themselves entered into a combination,
the result of which brought the nomina
tion of Judge Conley by a handsome ma
jority, much to the discomfiture of the
Examiner's political bureau.

REPORT ON
THE FUSION
Democrats Get the
Offices of Most
Patronage.
Only One Plank Recommended,
That of Sixteen to

The following â¢Â« the report of the fusion
committee:
Mr. President: Tour committee ap
pointed to confer with committees rep
resenting the People's and the Silver Re
publican parties on the question of the
union of parties, on the question of the
union of forces in this campaign, respect
fully report that at a conference of such
committees the agreement herewith sub
mitted was considered and adopted.
We find the representatives of the
People's and Silver Republican parties
in earnest in this fight, and from authori
tative reports received by them from the
various parts of the State, find that plan
of union contained in said agreement, if
ratlned by the Democratic State Con
vention, will be loyally supported by the
members of their respective parties. We
earnestly hope that in view of the great
issues at stake, and In view of the fact
that the three parties to this agreement
are in harmony on the essential prin
ciples upon which the perpetuity and the
success of our institutions depend, differ
ing only in non-essentials, this convention
will ratify this agreement and thus lay
the foundation for future success of the
principles held In common by the respec
tive parties to this agreement. Respect

To the Democratic State Convention:
At a Joint meeting of the conference com
mittee of the Democratic, People s and
Silver Republican parties, appointed by
the State conventions of their respective
parties with a view of a^ectlng a union
of Silver and other reform forces in the
coming campaign it was agreed as fol
lows : . ,
Firstâ That there shoui- be a union of
such parties and a united enort made to
secure economical government, the re
sumption of the free and unlimited coin
age of silver and gold at me present
legal ratio of 16 to 1, without waiting for
the aid or consent of any other nation,
and the administration of public affairs
on the basis of honesty and "Equal rights
to all, special privileges to none."
Secondâ That we recommend such union
to be founded on mutual concessions as
follows:
The Silver Republican party to be con
ceded the nomination for one Justice of
the Supreme Court and the Clerk of the
Supreme Court; the People's party to be
conceded the nominations for Lieutenant |
Governor, Controller, Superintendent of
Public Instruction, member o. the Board
of Railroad Commissioners of the Third
District; the Democratic part" to be con
ceded the Governor, Secretary of State,
State Treasurer, Attorney General, Sur
veyor General, Superintendent of State
Printing, one Justice of the Supreme
Court, the members of the Board of
Railroad Commissioners for the First and
Second Districts, the members of the
Board of Equalization in the First, Sec
ond, Third and Fourth districts.
As to Congressional districts said com
mittees respectfuny recommend that the
People's party be conceded the nominees
for Congress in the First, Sixth and Sev
enth districts, and that the Democratic
party be conceded fhe nominees in the
Second. Third, Fourth and l.rth districts.
We further earnestly recommend that
a union of said forces be made wherever
Â§ossible in the various portions of the
tate on candidates for the Legislature,
county and local officers.
The Democratic State Convention Is
hereby notified that the Silver Repub
lican party and the People's party have,
In pursuance of the agreement heretofore
entered into, accepted and ratified the
foregoing basis of union, and have nom
inated candidates for the respective of
fices conceded to such parties.
On receiving notice of the ratification
of this agreement the Silver Republican
party and the Peopled party, through
their duly authorized agents for that pur
pose, are prepared to make all final ar
rangements for the carrying Into full ef
fect the foregoing agreement.
The respective committees to this
agreement, in view of the combination
of all corporate influences inimical to the
general welfare under the protecting
auspices of the Republican party, and
in view of the fact that the Silver and
reform forces of the couutry agree on
the paramount and political issues of the
day, and the success and application of
which in the government of the State
and nation are dearer to parties than vic
tory under any party name, hereby ap
peal to this convention and to all citi
zens not only to effect said union, but to
make it successful at the polls, to the
ends that in the coming contest In 1900,
under the banner of Bryan and Silver.
as now under the banner of Maguire and
Reform, we will all be found fighting
shoulder to shoulder In a common cause
for the uplifting of the masses to their
rightful place in government.

HUGHES OF SAN DIEGO.
After Much Friction He Was
Nominated for Justice of the
Supreme Court.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. IS.â The Los An
geles county delegation during the morn-
Ing hour held another of lta memorable
caucuses to decide how the delegation
should vote for Associate Justices of the
Supreme Court.
A vote was had without much difficulty
or squabbling and It resulted as follows:
Judge Hughes of San Diego. 59; Judge
McKissick, 11; Judge Farnsworth, 2.
Just as the vote was announced, James
L. Gallagher of San Francisco appeared
on the scene and had a brief consultation
with M*. Dockweiler and Mr. Patton.
Mr. Dockweiler immediately appeared and
asked the caucus to delay action until
after lunch. His reasons he did not give,
but it was apparent that the Maguire
managers did not want Judge Hughes to
have the eighty-one votes of Los An
geleÃ County for the reason that they
wished to have the nomination come from
the northern part of the State. Judge

PYROTECHNICS AND ORATORY
STORY OF
THE JUDGE'S
WALKOVER
Dwyer Started the Elo=
quence and Then There
Was No Stopping It.
Throughout It All Not a Voice Was Audible
in Opposition to the Populists'
Nominee Maguire.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MBNTO, Aug. 18.â Shortly after 10 a. m.
to-day talking was renewed, along the
whole lino.
The oratorical engagement was opened
by J. J. L>\vyer. who spoke on a question
of personal privilege. "Time" was fre
quently called by impatient delegates,
who presumably desired an opening for
themselves.
Mr. Dwyer is an agreeable talker and
gained listeners as he proceeded to an
nounce that he had no desire to go out
of his way to advocate primary elections
for the purpose of consolidating the
Democratic party in San Francisco.
There is no room to doubt that J. G. Ma
guire Is very anxious for the restoration
of harmony in San Francisco, for Mr.
Dwyer did not hesitate to say that the
suggestion of primaries for the municipal
battle emanate.! from the Democratic
nominee for Governor.
Delegations appointed by the committee
of one hundred, governed by a whisper-
Ing boss, will answer for the making of a
State ticket, but in the opinion of J. G.
ilUfjuire the practice is not a good one
to carry into municipal politics. The poli
ticians of the Democratic" faith perceive
that it is necessary that something should
be done at once to arrest the defection of
Harney's followers and it is now pro
posed to give them local primaries since
they have been deprived of representa
tion.
Fusion talk followed the personal privi
lege. The plan of dividing the spoils of
office was ratified. The Silver Republi
cans get one Associate Justice and tne
Clerk of the Supreme Court. The Popu
lists get the Lieutenant Governor, Con
troller, Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion and the Railroad Commissioner from
the Third District. The rest of the fod
der goes to the Democratic crib. The
Populists surrendered all claim to candi
dates for the State Board of Equalization
and sent a message that they would in
dorse a Democrat in each district and
â would find it especially gratifying to rally
around R. H. Beamer's banner in the Sec
ond District.
The Congressional districts assigned to
the Populists are the First, Sixth and
Bt-vt nth. The Democrats take the Sec
ond, Third, Fourth and Fifth Congres
sional districts. This arrangement for
'â¢uplifting the masses" was satisfactory
to the convention, hence the report of
the fusion committee was adopted with
out expressed dissent.
Eugene Deuprey, who was in fine form, but
not in prime voice owing to the prolonged
engagement with the hosts of gab the day
before, desired that the convention should
go right along and put up a nominee for
Governor without waiting for the plat
form. No other inference could be drawn
from Deuprey' s remarks than that the
convention should indorse any platform
that J. G. Maguire proposed for the oc
casion. The convention went right along
with the Maguire programme â the rawest
programme- that was ever invented for
the uplifting of the masses.
Mr. Alford of Tulare, whose speech and
gesture had been carefully rehearsed,
went to the platform in good style. His
speech was full of fine "hrases. the key
notes of campaign oratory. A few of the
choice extracts were "Hell born." "filthy
slime" and "blackmailing press." He
borrowed from Shakespeare the tribute
paid by Antony to the character of Bru
tus and applied it with perversion to J.
G. Maguire. When Antony said that the
elements were so mixed in Brutus that
nature might say to all the world, "This
was a man," Colonel Brutus happened to
be dead in his tent. Maguire. will not be
politically dead until next November. Al
ford is premature if not polished.
Senator Stephen M. White made an ef
fective speech. Perhaps he had in mind
the "Hell born" allusions of Alford, for
he assured the delegates that he had not
"culled extracts of classic â¢ quotation"
to embellish his eulogy of Judge Maguire.
Mr. White sought to inspire a patriotic
response when he recalled the heroic
achievements of the American troops at
Santiago and Manila, but he soon per
ceived that he was casting pearls of pa
triotism before McNabs and switched to
another line.
Judge Maguire was nominated by ris
ing acclamation. White, Alford and Phe
lan were detailed to escort Maguire to
the platform. Then some one whispered
to Chairman Cassin that the committee
on platform had not reported, and hence
for form's sake Maguire should not be
asked to accept before he had seen the
platform. Of course Cassin knew that
Mngi.iire had passed on the platform and
fixed everything on it to suit himself, but
it was thought to be indecent to expose
the fact to the people. The work of "up
lifting the masses" requires delicate fln
l*h. Anxiety as to the whereabouts of the
Slatform began to i,e felt, but the chair
ecided to go along with the nomination
of a ticket and candidates for Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court were an
nounced.
Mr. Leake of Tolo named Judge W. H.
Grant, drawing a picture of an intellect
ual giant with judicial attainments. Mr.
Butts of Sonoma named J. H. Seawell of
Mendocino. Judge Robert Ferral of San
Francisco, with a Placer proxy in hand,
unfurled the banner of General Jo Ham
ilton. Mr. Church of Fresno named Wil
liam M. Conley of Madora. Mr. Church
Bought to arouse enthusiasm for the
young judge of Madera by mentioning
the name of another young manâHob
son, the hero of tho Merrimao. The ex
pected applause was not evoked, but the
mention of another young man's name
that of William J. Bryan, called out
hearty applause. The ratio of cheers be
tween Bryan and Hobson was sixteen to
,<\p In Bryan's favor. Frank Gould start
ed In to nominate EldridgeC. Farnsworth-,
but got mixed and eulogized Judge Con
ley, much to tho delight of the Conley
following. Walker C. Graves of San
Francisco named L. D. McKissick.
At this stag-? of the proceedings word
was received .that the platform designed
to "uplift tho masses" had been heard
from. Presently Seth Mann produced it
and It was adopted. Less than half of
the convention remained to hear It read
After the reading the convention fook a
recess until 3 o'clock.
Whon the convention reassembled this
telegram was read:
DT'LUTH. Minn.. An*. IS.â To Hon. C. M.
Cassln. Chairman Convention: Congratula
tions on mapnlllcent work of convention. Co
operation will r;irry California and aid cause
of people in whole country.
CHARLES A. TOWNB.
Planks were added to the platform In
favor of upholding the State University,
Improving the Sacramento River and in
dorsing the union labels of the allied
printing trades unions.
The first genuine outburst of applause
during thÂ»' session now occurred.
Judge Maguirp. on his way to the plat
form, escorted by Senator White, Mayor
Phelan and Mr. Alford. was greeted with
cheers, the delegates rising to cheer.
Mayor Pr.elan was detailed to intro
duce the convention's nominee.
Mr. Maguire is at home on platforms
and thoroughly understands the art of >
j public speaking. His speech to-day was
below his usual standard. The audience
did not respond with any warmth to his
allusions concerning the achievement of
! American soldiers on land and sea in the
: war with Spain. He sought to explain his
! own record and that of his party on the
! war tax measure, but the effort was \in
: fortunate, as it excited neither sympathy
'. nor admiration. It is obvious to every
; observer that the getting of office by fu
â¢ sion is the main purpose and thought of
this convention.
Edward L. Hutchison, the "Pop" nomi
nee fur Lieutenant Governor, now grafted
on the Democratic ticket, made an un
happy speech by casting reproach on
I Cleveland Democrats and calling them
worshipers of the golden calf.
If Maguire is elected It Is to be hoped
that he will live out his term.
The convention now proceeded to the
only work to date that had not been pro
| grammed for the delegates.
The roll call on the nomination for As
sociate Justice of the Supreme Court was
begun. There were changes, conferences,
tumults, withdrawals, demonstrations of
anger, cries of protest and a succeession
of exciting scenes until the contest nar
rowed down to J. V. Coffey of San Fran
cisco and Conley of Madera. On the
fourth ballot Conley was Dominated, s. -
curing 493, as against 347 for Coffey. The
nominee was called to the platform and
acknowledged the compliment of the
nomination in a graceful speech.
The convention adjourned until evening.
The convention was called to order
again at 9:10, the chair announcing that
next In order was the nomination of a
candidate for Secretary of State.
A motion to pass that order carried.
Proceedings were suspended for twenty
minutes to await the arrival of delegates.
The chair then announced that nomin
ations for State Treasurer were In order.
Cabaniss of San Francisco named for the
office of Treasurer Charles Edelman of
Orange. In speaking of the candidate he
said he was one who served his country
as a sailor three years during the Civil
War. The honesty and capability of Mr.
Edelman were spoken of.
D. H. Arnold of Colusa presented the
name of Will S. Green, editor of the Co
lusa Sun and the incumbent of the office
of State Treasurer. Mr. Green's worth as
a man and his long services to the Dem
ocratic party were eulogized. Nomina
tions closed and Green was nominated,
receiving 440 votes. Edelman received 340
votes.
Edelman thanked the convention for the
support he received and moved that
Green's nomination be made unanimous
Carried.
For Attorney General Judge W. J. Cur
tis of San Bernardino named George B.
Cole of that county. Thomas B. Dozier of
Shasta placed in nomination H. P. An
drews of Red Bluff. The ballot resulted-
Andrews 497, Cole 284. Andrews was de
clared the nominee. The choice was
made unanimous.
Senator White directed attention to
omissions in the platform in reference
to the administration of Governor Budd,
and therefore moved that the following
be Inserted:
"Although the tax levies of the last
three years of his administration aggre
gated over $1,300,000 under the pledges of
the platform upon which he was elected,
the rate of taxation for 1896 was the low
est In the history of the State, and the
rates for 1597 and 1898 would have-been
still lower had not the assessed valua
tions of property in the State been de
creased."
Senator White's motion prevailed.
For Surveyor General Mr. McNalr of
San Francisco placed in nomination
George H. Rogers of Napa. Mr. Baker
of Modoc named Irving M. Mulholland
of Inyo. Mr. Leake of Yolo Inquired if
Mr. Rogers was not the nominee of the
Populist convention. Mr. McNair ex
plained that Mr. Rogers secured the
nomination of the Populists on the con
dition that he would get the Demo
cratic nomination. He was not a Popu
list and never would be. (Laughter an-]
confusion.) Rogers was called for and
went to the platform and spoke of hi 3
Democratic record for forty years. The
history of Democratic loyalty as related
by Rogers refreshed the convention. He
said that he would be a Jeftersonian
Democrat as long as he lived and noth
ing else. He got a great ovation.
Mr. Mulholland was called to the plat
form. He said he was a young man but
had always been a Democrat and would
remain a Democrat. The roh was called.
A roar of laughter was caused by Butte
voting 6 for Mulholland and 6 for "Santa
Claus." The Rogers resemblance to Santa
Claus was so striking that the convention

caught the pleasantry at once. The bal
lot resulted: Rogers 280 Mulholland 503.
Mr. Mulholland was declared the nominee
of the convention.
For State Printer, Mr. Troy of Trinrty
placed In nomination John J. Curry of
San Francisco. Mr. Bonne of San Diego
placed in nomination R. Y. McÃride of
Los Angeles.
P. M. Wellin of San Francisco desired
to ask a question.
"I want to know if Mr. McÃride is a
union printer? A report has been circu
lated here that he is not."
Mr. Boone requested Mr. Rogers of
Los Angeles to reply to the question.
Earl Rogers of Los Angeles read tele
grams from the editor of the Labor World
and officers of the Typographical Union
of that city vouching for Mr. McÃride's
loyalty to union principles.
Smith of San Francisco read the fol
lowing telegram:
LOS ANGELES. Aug. 18.â To "W. B.
Benolst, State House, Sacramento: Mc-
Bride does not employ union pressfeed
ers, bookbinders nor union pressmen in
his office here. See Patterson at State
office. W. M. HAWKINS,
Secretary L. A. T. U. No. 174.
Rogers replied that McÃride did not em
ploy union bookbinders because he did
not bind books, nor did he employ union
press feeders because his presses were
self-feeding. This sally brought out a
laugh from the delegates.
J. R. Price of Colusa placed in nomina
tion Everi'tt J. Wooaman of Sacramento.
P. E. Zabola of Monterey named W. B.
Benoist of San Francisco. The baaot.re
sulted: Curry 16. MoÃride 317. Woodman
418, Benoist 21. The chair declared Mr.
Woodman the choice of the convention.
The choice of Woodman was made unani
mous on motion of Mr. Rogers of Los
Angeles.
The convention was addressed by the
nominee, who indorsed the platform and
the ticket.
For Secretary of State, Raleigh Barcar
| placed in nomination R. A. Thompson of
| Sonoma, an able and distinguished Demo
crat. Mr. Thompson w.as nominated by
' acclamation.
Mr. Arnold of Colusa moved that the
thanks of the convention be given to all
the officers of the convention and the peo
ple of Sacramento.
On motion of Raleigh Barcar the
amended plan of organization for the
State Central Committee was adopted.
Mr. Van Meter of he law committee
was introduced to say something of im
portance to the convention. He said as
chairman of the law committee of the
fused organizations he would state that it
was necessary for all the district con
ventions to certify respectively of the
nominations made, and that each district
convention must appoint an auditive com
mittee of five. Incidentally h mentioned
that he used to train with Democrats.
When Cleveland took the party away
from Democratic principles he joined the
People's party. The convention coldly re
ceived the statement.
On motion of Mr. Gould the convention

cheers for the ticket.
PROCEEDINGS IN DETAIL.
Work of the Convention as It Was
Transacted During the Day.
Chairman Cassin called the convention
to order at 11 o'clock. The secretary an
lounced the meeting of the dllierent Con
gressional district conventions.
Mr. Dwyer of Alamedaâ Mr. Chairman
and gentlemen of the convention: I rise
this morning with the permission of the
chair to a question of personal privilege.
Gentlemen of the convention, I had re
solved, after taking up so much of your
time yesterday, and the question in which
I was particularly interested having been
settled by a vote of this convention, not
to trouble you any further with remarks
from me, and that is my resolution at
this time.
1 have no desire to Interfere in behalf
of any delegates by speeches or to dis
cuss any of the uestions of platform and
resolutions that come before you. I shall
not do so, but I crave the indulgence of
the convention for a few minutes only
to speak to a question of personal privi
lege, and I think when I have finished
my remarks that nobody present will have
the slightest reason to take any excep
tion to any of them. It is based, gen
tlemen, on an article that appeared in
the San Francisco Examiner. It reads as
follows; "Sacramento, Aug. 17. â A warn
ing was sent at an early hour this morn
ing to the friends of reform and decency
in the State convention to remain in Sac
ramento until the close of the session of
that body. J. J. Dwyer threatens to
present a minority report on the resolu
tion ordering primaries for the election
of delegates to the municipal and legisla
tive conventions in San Francisco and for
the election of a new county committee
to succeed the committee of 100. Rainey
and his messengers are active in instruct
ing their delegates to remain and assist
Dwyer in accomplishing the purpose of
the boss."
Now, gentlemen of the convention, this
article is founded upon a total misappre
hension of facts. They arise upon an in
cident that occurred at the close of the
convention yesterday afternbon when Mr
Wright of Los Angeles, who was the
chairman of th 1 committee on credentials!
but who upon his own responsibility, as
he stated, introduced a certain resolution
yesterday and asked for its immediate
consideration. The resolution provided
for the calling of primaries in San Fran
cisco for municipal and legislative nomi
nations. Mr. Wright stated at the time
that he offered the resolution on his own
responsibility and not as coming from the
committee on credentials. On motion of
Frank Gould of San Francisco that reso
lution was referred to tho committee on
platform and resolutions. Upon that
committee I had been named, as I was
informed last night, at the request of
Judge Maguire. I was so informed by
Judge Maguire himself. When it came
to appointing sub-committees, the chair
man of the committee, Seth Mann, ap
pointed mo without any solicitation on my
part, as onf of the seven upon San Fran
cisco organization. Never having shirked
any responsibility and not yet being will-

the Persimmon.
ing to do so, I assumed that I was se
lected, and consented to act upon that
committee. That committee met at 11
o'clock last night and remained in session
until 2:45 this morning. We had be
fore us quite a large number of speakers
to represent the committee of one hun
dred and we had one there who sjpoke on
his own responsibility, Frank J. Heney.
These things are preliminary to the
statement that I am not the orieinator
of the Wright resolution. Mr. Wright
will substantiate my remarks in that re
gard. I knew nothing about it. I am not
the father of it. I am not tne champion
of it, and I am not the supporter of it. I
was informed on the way from this con
vention yesterday afternoon that vie en
tire Los Angelas delegationâ Bl votes
would be cast in favor of primaries in.
San Francisco for the municipal conven
tion. I was informed that Mr. Alford, one
of the principal supports and champions
of Judge Maguire throughout this cam
paign, was in favor of that proposition,
and so were his friends. I asked Mr. Al
ford on the platform this morning if it
was true that he was going to support
that proposition on the floor of this con
vention, and he snid it was true. â¢Mr.
Alford is here, or will be here soon, and if
necessary and called upon he will sub
stantiate that statement. This was yes
terday afternoon.
Matters were in that shape when the
committee met last night, and when the
arguments were made in behalf of allow
ing the committee to continue to do in
San Francisco exactly as it phased with
regard to the method of calling conven
tions. Ac the deliberations went on light
broke upon me that had not been present
in the early part of the evening, x saw
that, if I supported the proposition,
though it was in conformity with the po
sition tJtait l took yesterday here in favor
of primaries as the truly Democratic
method of representation, that I would be
totally misapprehended and perhaps mis
represented by some people who are not
as much interested in my welfare as I
am. Therefore at the conclusion of the
meeting at a quarter of 3 this morning In
the presence of Mr. Max Popper and Mr.
Samuel Braunhart, two of the chief
spokesmen of the convention last night,
and in the presence of Mr. Stith Mann,
the chairman of the committee on reso
lutions, of Mr. Joseph Leggett, a member
of the committee on resolutions, and of
Mr. Ben Maddnx, the chairman of the
committee on San Francisco organization \
âall of these, mind you, good friends and [
personal champions of Judge Maguire â I j
made the deliberate statement in these
words: "Gentlemen of this committee,
this proposition contained in the Wright
resolution is not my proposition. It Is not
a proposition of my friends. Tt is a prop
osition of those who were engaged in the !
fight yesterday to give the San r rancisoo !
delegation one-half of the vote. I want
all of you now to understand and I want
the gentlemen from the committee of 100 i
to tell their friends and go to them and j
say that I personally will not support the \
proposition of reopening any question of â 
San Francisco organisation uniesa Judge :
Maguire affirmatively accepts that prop
osition. [Applause.]
If Judge Maguire will come out In favor
of San Francisco primaries, that is one
thing that would have a great influence
upon my action, but if Judge Mugulre per
sonally and affirmatively will not come
out and make the fight in the open in
favor of San Francisco primaries, I will
be entirely opposed to reopening any
question settled by this convention, and
I personally will be opposed to primaries
In San Francisco. If he remnins silent
I will take the same position. I wanted
to clear my skirts; I did not want the re
sponsibility of botng charged, if anything
went wrong In November, with having j
mixed up the politics of San Francisco
and continued fights that are supposed to j
have been settled here yesterday. I am i
satisfied personally with the decision of
this convention upon that question for
the guidance of my political conduct in
this campaign just as much and to exact
ly the same extent as I will be satisfied
with the nominations put up by this con
vention. (Applause).
Now, gentlemen of the convention, I
want it understood that I am not throw
ing so much as a straw in the way of
the committee of 100 in San Francisco to
control and direct the organization of
the San Francisco Democracy for this
campaign in any manner in which their
judgment dictates. I have not done it
since the vote yesterday in any way,
shape or form. The only reason that
proposition was entertained at all was be
cause the friends of Judge Maguire in
San Francisco and outside of San Fran
cisco came to me and told me that they
thought that would consolidate the forces
of Democracy and insure the election of
Judge MaerJire :in<l Mr. Patton of Los
Angeles. Mr. Gaffey of Los Angeles and
others, all prominent members of that
delegation, told me that one of the chief
reasons that influenced u*e solid eighty
one votes to go in favor of the committee
of 100 yesterday was that there was either
an expressed, or perhaps more properly,
an Implied condition that after that was
accomplished they would then come out in
favor of primaries for the municipal con
vention in San Francisco. Now gentle
men, you understand my position. I am
out of that fight altogether. I am op
posed to opening wounds and rehashing
rights that have been settled. I won't do
it. If J'idge Maguire wants primaries in
San Francisco, If he thinks it Is neces
sary to the State ticket, he will come
out in the open and demand them and
then I will determine what my position in
that regard shall be. (Applause).
But until that is done, gentlemen, I am
opposed to reopening these questions, and
I pledge you my woru of hono^ that no
act of mine, now or until after election
day. shall contribute to interfere in the
slightest degree wit"h the control of the
San Francesco Democracy by the commit
tee of 100 to pursue their methods Mtactly
as their best judgment dictates). /
THE REPORT ON flg^N.
It was moved and seconded that the
plan of organization of the MI ate Central
Committee be taken from^the table and
referred back to the committee for
amendment. This motion was made at
the request of the committee. The chairâ
If there" is no objection it will be so or-,
dered. There being none, that will be the
order. The first order of business is the
reading of the report of the fusion com
mittee and action thereon.
Mr. Alfordâ Mr. Chairman and gentle
men of the convention: Before reading
the report of the fusion committee, ana
in accordance with the suggestion con
tained in the report of the committee on
organization and order of business, I
wish to make a statement, so as to give
the gentlemen of this convention all the
information I have relating to the history
of the proposed fusion or proposed union
in this campaign. At a meeting of the
Democratic State Central Committee, by
an almost unanimous vote of that com
mittee a committee was appointed for
the purpose, as contained in the resolu
tion and motion, of going to Sacramento I
to attend the Populist convention, which
was In session at that time, and arrang
ing a union between the Democratic
party and Silver Republicans and Popu
list party, if it could be done upon just
lines. I was a member of that commit
tee, and was elected chairman of It. We
came to Sacramento and met the Popu
lists here. The Populist party has been
placed in this position: Their State Cen
tral Committee, as It existed, was op
posed to fusion, or, at least, there were
enough members of that committee op
posed to fusion to force the convention
upon them at an earlier date than the
Democratic committee could, with con
sistency, call this convention. Therefore,
when the Populist convention met It
found that the majority of the conven
tion delegates made up from people in
these important positions, x have the
the Populist party were opposed to the
majority of their committee. They fa
vored -fusion, and as a result of that,
that party, without waiting for the re
port of any committee on fusion, and
stating specifically that thoy did not want
to force on the Democratic convention
any candidate for Governor, were will
ing under the distribution to allow this
convention to select its own candidate
for Governor, but anticipating, as all
si-nsible men anticipated who knew any
thing about the political conditions in this
State, the nomination of James G. Ma
guire, they nominated him for Governor
at that time. (Applause.)
We met their conference committee and
agreed upon the line which is contained
in the renort here. We told them distinct
ly that we had no authority to bind this
convention and they understood it. We
simply Dledged them under the direction
of the Democratic organization, as it was
stated in the State Central Committee, to
give them our moral support as a com
mittee in this convention to carry out
that principle. They aett-d upon the good
faith which they believed we stood in at
-that time and upon our promise as the
representatives of the Democratic organ
ization in the State Central Committee
acting upon it, nominated their officers
and took the resignation of the members
they expojcted under the agreement were
to come down in case this convention rat
ified that agreement. Here to-day is a
committee both l'rum the Sllv< r Republi
can and Populist parties, vestal with full
power to act in this matter and to ratify
their agreement and to nominate that
portion of the Democratic ticket which
has been distributed to this convention
according to the agreement if the agree
ment is adopted. I will read the report.
Mr. Alford then read the renort, which
is published elsewhere in these columns.
The report and the agreement were
adopted without discussion.
Mr. Deupreyâ What is the next order of
business. Mr. Chairman?
The Chairâ The next order of business
is the report of the committee on plat
form and resolutions.
Deupreyâ What is after that?
The Chairâ The next in order la the
nomination of the different officers. What
is the pleasure of the convention?
Mr. Deupreyâ l desire to submit to the
chairman's consideration and probably
ask the support of this convention in the
direction of such ruling as he may make
in the premises that we may save time
here by passing to the order of business
the nomination of candidates for office.
These candidates* are not called upon to
accept the nomination or indorse the plat
form until such time as they are notified
of the nomination and they are brought
here for the purpose of indorsing the
platform. It has been suggested to me
this morning by the gentleman whom I
believe will be your candidate for Gov
ernor that we should proceed with the
nomination of candidates for each office
without any interim for the purpose oj
obtaining or accepting speeches of any
of those nominees or the indorsement of
the platform; that In that way vre can
complete our ticket, and then if there are
those delegates who are absolutely re
quired by reason of business engagements
to bo absent they may not be held here
on that account; and I take it that it will
expedite matters and we will not interfere
with the proper procedure in the prem
ises. [Applause.]
Mr. Chairman. T now move you, sir,
that we pass to the new order of business,
to-wit* the nomination of candidates for
Governor of the State of California. The
Indorsement of the platform can be ob
tained later.
The motion was seconded and carried.
The Chairâ Nominations for Governor
are now in order.
MACIIIRF'S NOMINATION.
William H. Alford of Tulare went for
ward to the platform and made an ad
dress nominating James G. Maguire for
Governor.
SENATOR WHITE'S EULOGY.
Mr Alford was followed by United
States Senator Stephen M. White, who
seconded the nomination.
Three cheers were proposed for Hon.
Stephen M. White and were given with a
will. It was moved and seconded that the
nominations for Governor be now closed
and that the nomination of James G. Ma
guire be declared by a rising vote. The
nvÂ»*iorv was seconded and carried amidst
great enthusiasm.
The Chairâ Gentlemen. I declare James
G Maguire nominated as the candidate
of the Democratic party of the State of
California for the office of Governor. I
will appoint Senator White and William
H Alrord and Mayor Phelan of San
Francisco as a committee to notify James
G. Maguire of his nomination.
FOR THE SUPREME COURT.
We will now proceed with the next or
der of business, which is the nomination
of one Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court, while we are waiting for the com-
mittee.
Mr. I)euprey â Mr. Chairman and gen- |
tlemen of this convention, we have now
arrived at that point in the order of our
business for the nomination of candidate?
for the Supreme Bench of the State of
California, and I submit to you that the
one who should receive under any of
these circumstances at this convention
your voice of approval In the way of
"nomination for Associate Justice should
be possessed of the very highest qualifi
cations of educational attainment; he
should be possessed of a sound
body and a sound mind; he should
be possessed of unquestioned in
tegrity. As one of the leading jurists of
thia State asserted to me only the other
day, the position of Associate Justice of,
the Supreme Court of the State is really
of more importance than the position of
Governor in the State. You must remem
ber that the tribunal of last resort of this
State must pass upon the great constitu
tional questions that are constantly aris
ing by- reason of contests that will come
up as they have presented themselves in
the past, .and these propositions must be
dealt with by men whose legal attain
ments are of such a character and so
complete that when the decision is given
there shall be no possible chance of criti
cism or reversals. Your property rights,
your personal rights, your liberty and
your lives are placed in the poaeession of
those who shall finally determine in the
tribunal of last resort what the nature
and character of the protesting interests
shall be.
Pause then before you come to a con
clusion as to whom you will nominate for
has it been said by my eloquent friend,
honor to submit to this convention the
name of one whom I believe is in every
manner worthy of your consideration. Ha
was educated at the Richmond College,
founded by Thomas Jefferson, and he
came fully equipped for the study of his
profession by the education necessary to
cope with the problems that would be
presented to him. He, in l!</9, was ad
mitted to the practice of his profession,
and ever since he has been actively en
gaged therein, until in San Diego County
two years ago they saw fit, in a Repub
lican county, to elect him to the Superior
bench, which he has graced ever since,
and to whicn he has been a great honor,
not only to himself, but to the position
which he has occupied and the manner in
which he has acquitted himself in the
execution of the duties that were before
him.
I would submit to you that, as I am In
formed, to all of the members of the pro
fession in the southern portion of the
State as well as those from all portions of
California who have had the opportunity
to appear before him, hg has given the
greatest satisfaction; his integrity has
never been questioned, and his learning is
acknowledged. I now nominate as As
sociate Justice of the Supreme Court of
this great State of California John W.
Hughes, Judge of the Superior Court of
San Diego County. (Applause and cheers.)
The Chairâ John W. Hughes has been
placed in nomination for the office of As
sociate Justice of the Supreme Court. Do
JUDGE GRANT NOMINATED.
Edward E. Leake of Yoloâ Mr. Chair
man and gentlemen of the convention: I
present to the Democratic b^ate conven
tion of California to-day, for its consid
eration, as a candidate for Associate Jus
tice of the Supreme Court the name of
Judge W. H. Grant of Yolo County. From
a long personal acquaintance and close
and intimate contact with that gentleman,
I have had unusual opportunities for ob
serving his habits; his inclination of judgr
ing character; his ability and his integ
rity. As a result I have been profound
ly impressed with the idea that he is pos
sessed in an eminent degree of the quali
fications necessary to enable him to dis
charge with ability, with impartiality and
with wise discrimination, all the duties
and the responsibilities belonging to the
exalted position to which he aspires.
During a term of six years upon the
Superior bench of Yolo County his ser
vices were of such high order, his ability
and his legal attainment were so gener
ally recognized, his strong intellectuality
and his unswering integrity were so firm
ly impressed upon his constituents that
they predict there is no eminence in his
great profession to which he may not rea
sonably aspire.
Judge Grant is a hard worker, a pro
found and logical thinker, a faithful and
an efficient public servant in every posi
tion which he has been called to fill in
Yolo County. His decisions during his
term of office bore evidence of unremit
ting labor, of careful research and pa
tient application. He weighed with great
care every argument advanced, and ap
pealing to his reason before arriving at a
decision. When once that decision was
reached It was almost invariably sustain
ed by the highest judicial tribunal of this
State. Judge Grant's mind is a store
tfcouse of that useful information that la
so essential as the basis of an exalted
judicial lecturer. While he has been
original in thought and in idea and is
commendably Independent in marking out
his own line of action, he also has been
skillful in the utilization and adaptation
of ideas and principles that have emanated
from others. He possesses elements of
strength that Bhould apeal to the Demo
cratic party of California. He possesses
all the energy and enthusiasm of youth;
all the culture of education; all the learn
ing of a lawyer; all the wisdom and ex
perience of a judge; all the ability of a
statesman; all the convictions of a loyal
and consistent Democrat, and, better than
all, an honesty of purpose and a close
sympathy with the people. He also pos
sesses the prestige of hailing from a
county that has ever been and will ever
be one of the strongest pillars of that
glorious superstructure of California
Democracy.
Gentlemen of this convention, whether
you shall nominate Judge Grant or not,
Yolo County will remain loyal to her tra
ctions, loyal to the old faith, loyal to i
the Democratic party, but, with his name i
upon the ticket we of the Sacramento
Valley will feel Inspired to strive for
Democratic victory with an enthusiasm
and determination we have never before
felt. (Applause.)
The Chairâ Judge W. H. Grant has been
placed in nomination. Are there any
other nominations?

SENATOR WHITE EULOGIZING HIS FRIEND. MAGUIRE
for the office of Supreme Justice of the
State of California,
FUSION NOMINEES.
Hon. Stephen M. Whiteâ Mr. Chair
man, before going any further, it appears
to me from an examination of the rec
ord here that a possible complication
might ensue, or at least some criticism
be hereafter made, and I rise for the pur
pose of having the record put in a clear
condition. There was a report adopted
to-day called a report with reference to
fusion. In that report, which was adopt
ed, as I have said, by this convention,
the Justice of the Supreme Court and
Clerk of the Supreme Court were ratified
under the nomination made by the Silver
Republican party and the Lieutenant
Governor, Controller and Superintendent
of Public Instruction nominated by the
People's party, were also ratified, but
neither nominee was named, and, as far
as the record now shows, there is a sim
ple blank with reference to this subject.
To clear the matter from all doubt, be
fore there is any vote upon the subject
of Supreme Judge, and to relieve the sit
uation from any entanglement. I move
that Walter S. Vandyke is hereby nom
inated for Justice of the Supreme Court
of the State of California; that H. A.
McCraney is hereby nominated for
Clerk of the Supreme Court of the State
of California; that Edwin 1.. Hutchinson
is hereby nominated for Lieutenant Gov
ernor of the State of California; that F.
W. Maples is hereby nominated for Con
troller of the State of Califorla; that
Christian Runckel is hereby nominated
for Superintendent of Public Instruction
of the State of California.
There is also a nomination regarding
the Third District Railroad Convention
over which, of course, this convention
has no present jurisdiction. I make this
motion in accordance with a resolution
you have adopted and to make the rec
ord spenk for itself. The motion was sec
onded and passed, and the chair declared
the gentlemen named in the motion as
the nominees for the different offices
named. Mr. Ford of Nevada, in a short
speech, seconded the nomination of Gen
eral Jo Hamilton.
Mr. Church of Fresnoâ Mr. Chairman
and gentlemen of the convention: You
will observe by the badge I wear that 1
come from the glowing interior of this
great State, and we from that portion
of the State have a candidate whom we
are going to present for your considera
tion, and we ask from you for a moment
a most patient hearing. One thing is
settled, whatever this convention may do
during the remainder of its sessionâ it is
settled in the minds of every one of us,
if not in the mlnda of our opponents as
wellâ that James G. Maguire is to be the
next Governor of the State of Califor
nia. (Prolonged applause and cheers i.
His peculiar fitness for the duties of that
exalted station has long and univer
sally been known and recognized. Long
before this convention met, long before
this convention was thought of the peo
ple of the State of California had mark
ed J. G. Maguire for their own. They
demanded a man, and they secured him
for their leader, who is no politician in
the mere low cunning sense of that term,
but a statesman of large experience, a
man of wide knowledge, a man of great
judgment, and a man whom they can
trust and who has always been trust
worthy. Heâ this large-minded manâ
this nature's nobleman, genial, pleasant,
human-hearted, kind-hearted, large-soul-
I ed and large-brained â is now our leader,
our Ideal leader, and above all things
we want to see him elected Governor of
the State of California. We bring to you
the name of a man whom we are con
fident if you will select and place that
name 'upon the ticket with him will not
weaken that ticket, but will give it
strength from one end of this great State
to the other. It is the name of the gal
lant, of the splendid, of the superb Judge
of Madera County, Judge William N.
Conley. (Applause and cheers).
We "ask from you a support of him.
Now. gentlemen, I shall detain you bare
ly a moment. I shall indulge in no hack
neyed phrases with regard to this Judge.
such as are customary on occasions like
this I shall not tell you that he is a man
learned in law. The Supreme Court of
the State of California in reviewing his
decisions have already repeatedly said
that. I shall not tell you that he is a
mnn above all others, or equal to all
others in weighing conflicting opinions.
In sifting evidence. In going straight to
the heart of the difficult controversy, and
of always leaning to the side of justice.
Every lawyer and every citizen that has
hid a case in his court or knows any
thing about him knows that all these
things are true. I come directly to the
one great objection and most serious ob
jection that Is made against the candida
cy of Judge Conley. I acknowledge to
v'ou frankly here and now that when that
objection was first made I did not and
even vet do not exactly know how to
meet it. All admitted and recognized his
fitness his fearlessness as a Judge, his
honesty, his candor, his capacity, his
ability, his popularity; but the one great
objection made to him is that he is a
young man,. and that is all. It Is true,
gentlemen, that Judge Conley is a young
man. He Is not yet quite 33 years of age.
and that, I suppose, is young. But I re
member when a boy that I h*ard a poem
that ran something like this: At ten a
child; at twenty wild; at thirty wise if
ever; at forty rich; at fifty fat; at sixty
good or never. (Laughter.) Judge Con
ley then, has reached the age of 30,
which, if this poem Is worth anything, is
the ape of wisdom, and wisdom Is what
we wrnt upon the Supreme Bench of the
State of California. But. gentlemen of
this convention, is a man to be con
demned because he is young? Did not the
Democrats of the Second District of the
State of Californiaâ the Second Congres
sional Districtâ name for Its standard
bearer two years ago a man much young
er than Judge Conley, the Honorable Ma
rion de Vries (Applause and cheers), and
has he not fulfilled the duties of that ex
alted position with such distinguished
ability, with such marked vitality, that
the. democrats of that distriot have re
warded him again with a unanimous
nomination. I stood the other night with
5000 people In the great Metropolitan
Opera House in New York City and I saw
standing upon that platform a young
man superb In his personal appearance,
magnificent in his manner, his lips
touched with a coal of fire from the very
altar of eloquence; a young man who had
done more, perhaps, with one or two ex
ceptions, to make this great country of
ours glorious and famous in the war
through wh'ieh we have just passed, than
any other from the President downâ that
young man was Lieutenant Hobson (ap
plause and cheers), the glorious hero of
the Merrtmac.
I thought in the presence of such a
young man an that will any part of the
groat American people, In the face of
THE SAN FRANCTSCO CALI,, FRIDAY, AUGUST 19, 1898.
his deeds, ever object to a young man i
again. Is it not a stranger thing that a ;
Democrat should object to a young man,
when only two years ago we nominated a
man not "much older than Conley for the
exalted station of President of the Lnlted
States, the most superb, the most glori
ous leader that ever led the great politi
cal party into battle. Two years from
to-day we stand ready to repeat that deed
and name once more for our standard
bearer that magnificent young man. \\ 11
11 am J. Bryan of Nebraska. (Applause
and cheers.) With such facts as these to
confront us. with a history to look back
upon like this, I am sure v.at this one .
objection, the only objection that can be ,
made, the only objection that any one
dare make to the peculiar fitness, to the
remarkable fitness of William M. I onley
for a place upon the Supreme bench or ;
this State, must fall to the ground. AN ith
one other remark I shall leave you and
leave his name for your consideration, ;
and that remark is this: Nearly four |
years ago he was renominated for the i
position that he occupies on the bench
upon the ticket led by the , brilliant Gov
ernor of the State of California. He led
even the remarkable vote of Governor
Budd by 400, and he led all others by
nearly GOO in the county where he lived.
There Is no man in that part of the State
so popular. There is no man there bo
deserving. There is no man there or any
where that has made a better or a
cleaner record as Judge of any Superior
Court of this State. When you reflect
that the great valley of the San Joaquln.
that large and- growing portion <>f this
State has never, with all its litigation,
had a representative upon the Supreme
Bench of the State of California, we
think you will say and agree with us
that it Is time that it did have and that
Judge Conley is exactly the man. (Ap-

Mr -'Kjuldâ Not too long, the gentleman

will not talk too long. I will talk as long
as you wi I listen to me and then I will
stop â¢ I want to talk to you about a man
who Is a candidate for the Supreme
Bench He lives in Tul&re County and his
name is Eldridge C. Farnsworth. (Ap
plause). You have seen him about the
halls of this convention. When you have
walked down the aisles and have seen a
man that you thought was William Jen
nings Bryan, it was Farnsworth Born
in the county of Mariposa thirty-eight
years ago educated in the law school of
the State of California, That place
whore in the future will grow the most
magnificent institution of learning on
earth largely through the munificence of
one of the grandest women in America,
Mrs. Phebe R. Hearst. (Applause).
That applause is grateful, not to me, but
to every woman, to every man, in the
State of California who is familiar with
the magnificent character of that lady.
(Applause.) It ought not to be given,
however. In handclaps; it ought to be
given In cheers: Coming from that uni
versity, then, from which no man has
ever been seated on the Supreme Benchâ
I allude to th* affiliated college of law.
Mr Eld ridge Farnsworth practiced law
for' many years In a county up hero in
the mountains adjacent to Sacramento;
District Attorney of th*Â» county of Ama
dor for many years, endeared there to
the people by the performance of his du
ties and by the strict integrity of his
character. There ought to be that high
dignity of courage; there ought to be
that honor that is absolutely unimpeach
able: there ought to be those qualities
of decision, of determination of charac
ter, of manliness and of independence
that characterize the great men of the
world. Gentlemen of this convention, a
long and intimate acquaintance of Judge
Conley (laughter) â Judge Farnsworth
has led me to know that in every one of
those qualifications he stands a peer of
any man In California. Nominate Judge
Conley (laughter)â nominate Judge Farm
worthâthat is a good joke: the Judge Is
a good fellow, too â nominate Judge
Farnsworth, and you will have upon the
Supreme Bench of this State a man who
will stand absolutely and impregnably be
tween the people and the corporate In
fluences that are endeavoring to wrest
from them or decrease their liberties.
You will have a man in whom the peo
ple, can safely repose their every right
and be assured that the laws of this
State founded upon the constitution will
bo interpreted and enforced. (Applause.)
Gentlemen of the convention, I thank
you. â ' : -WÂ

nominations?
Walker C. Graves of San Franciscoâ
Gentlemen of the convention, though ;i
humble member of this great Democratic
convention, yet we feel that we have some
conception of the qualifications of the
man for the high office of Associate- Jus
tice of the Supreme Court, and we l.r-
llew that the man whose name we will
now present to you, the Hon. L. D. Mc-
Kisirk (applause) is pre-eminently fit
for it by his prreat natural ability. His
exalted character and his large experi
ence as a lawyer and a judge. He was
for many years the leader of the bar in
Tennessee and he Is the foremost lawyer
to-day In the State of California. He
served on the Board of Arbitration of the
State of Tennessee with entire satisfac
tion of the bar and the people of that
State and was elected by hIR associates
as Chief Justice thereof. He was ten
dered by the Governor of the State a
place upon the court of last resort,
but he declined to accent it to engage In
the practice of his profession. Owing to
an epidemic of yellow fever at Memphis
he emigrated to the State of California
and Immediately took his place In the
front ranks of the profession here. He
has been connected with the heaviest liti
gations In this State and has met and
vanquished some of our ablest lawyers.
He was the lending counsel In the great
Colton case and In the Mare Island case
and was lately associated with W. T.
Baprett in the now famous Halo & Nor
cross cases. He wns employed by the
Government of the United Stated to rep
resent the Government ana bring a suit
against the directors of the Central Pa
cific Railroad Company. Fellow Demo
crats I feel that I would be recreant to
mv duty here as a delegate on this floor
nn'd derelict In my duty to my profession
and to the people of this State If I did
not arise here in my place and give tes
timony as to the knowledge I possess of
his high fitness for this office. He has
been associated with me in litigation that
Involved a mass of facts and figures and
I was struck with astonishment at his
grasp of thought; the comprehensiveness
of his mind, his extraordinary memory
and his powers of discrimination, his in

fellow citizens, you should nominate for
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court
of this State tha Hon. L. D. McKisick.
Adopt the Platform.
Mr. Patton of Los Angelesâ Mr. Chair- I
' man, I move that we now suspend the
I nominations and read and adopt the plat- j
I form which has been prepared by the
I committee on platform and *-hieh is now ;
! waiting here. I move that we now suspend
1 the nomination of Judges and proceed to j
, the adoption of the platform.
The motion was seconded and carried. ,
Mr. Deupreyâ Mr. Chairman, before;
' reading the report I wish to say that it :
: has been brought to my attention that
the report of the committee, so far as
! that committee was concerned, would
place it in such a situation that the num- ;
I her of the State Central Committee would ;
; not be provided for; and having ascer- |
tamed that error. I would move you, Mr.
Chairman, if permitted, that the portion
of the report as to the State Central |
: Committee be taken from the table ana
' be referred back tq the committee upon
\ that subject, so that we may hear from
i them hereafter. . ,
The Chairâ lt seems to me that that
! motion Is out of order, Mr. Deuprey, un
less you make it as an amendment.
Mr' Deupreyâ lt is only tj take it from \
i the table and* send it back to the commit
tee. An error has been made in the State
â¢ Central Committee, the number has not j
been ascertained.
The (."hairâ lf there is no objection to i
1 that, it will be so ordered. If there is no i
, objection we will proceed to hear the re

It was moved and seconded that the re- '

AFTERNOON WORK
OF THE CONVENTION
The convention -was called to order by
! the chairman at 3:30 p. m.
Mr. Fitzgerald of San Francisco offered
; an amendment to the report of the com-
I mlttee on platform, which was read by
! the secretary, and stated: "Gentlemen of
I the Convention: The University of Cali

bead of the movement and we hope this
convention will assist to the full extent
j of its power in that movement."
It was moved and seconded that the
amendment be adopted. Carried.
Mr. Price offered an amendment to that
portion of the report of the committee en
platform relating to river improvements,
and stated:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the
Convention; I am not now connected
with this department of public work, but
have Its interests at heart. I believe it is i
necessary for this Democratic Convention
to declare itself upon this subject, and i
for that reason I offer this amendment.
It was moved and seconded that the
amendment be adopted. Carried.
The Chair â The question is now upon
tiie adoption of the platform and amend
ments.
It was moved and seconded that the
platform be adopted as amended. Carried.
Mr. Ryan offered a resolution in refer
ence to the cause of organized labor,
published elsewhere, which was adopted
by the convention.
At this point Judge J. G. Magulre was
t srr.r-ted to the platform and delivered his
address, accepting the nomination at the
hands of the convention, which address 'â¢>
published elsewhere.
Mr. llutchinson was then introduced to
the convention by the Chair, and spoke as
follows: Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen
of the Convention: I thank you for the
honor that you have conferred upon me.
I shall not take any of your time except
ing a ff\v moments to state, as I have
I seen them, some of the difllrultic-s that
have been surmounted in bringing this
about. Most of the people of this State
know that a few months ago it appeared
Impossible for the reform forces of the
j State of California to come together as
If now are. A month ago a gn-at con
tion was held in this city, in the Cap
building. We had difficulties to con
1 with that were greater than any
t have confronted you.
mi know as well as 1 that every in
nee that was opposed to us was there,
i know as wel as I that every monop
tir force in the State was there. That
v^ry Republican official in the State was
directly interested in our disunion and
they were well represented there. You
know as well as I that some of our own
people, some of the members of the Pec
pie's party that had fought many a bat
ile and had iought well, that were as
honest and upright zmd as sincere as any
man that lived did not believe in fusion.
You know as well as I that there were
others there who never had any belief of
any kind whatever who come at the beck
and call of others and who did the best
they could to do their duty. We there
began the work that you have carried
ii^ro, and hnve carried it out well.
You know as well as I that s tmc radical
measures must be taken, something must
be done. We could not have the first
place on the ticket vacant. We knew
what you would do, and we were to be
gin the good work. We simply did <iur
duty In placing at the head of "our ticket
the Hon. James G. Magulre. (Applause.)
A few years ago ft seemed almost im
possible' that the People's party and the
Demnerntie party could ever come togeth

of thought embodying a */ew considera

be f placed before this eoj ventlon prior
to the time of taking thÂ« vote. It has
been well said here that good Democrats
come from the State of -Virginia. It will
be remembered that John TV. Hughes is

to say that In the year ISJI6 ISe Demo

ThE PINTO POPULIST PLATFORM.
JUDGE) MAGUIRE was invited to sit with the
committee appointed to draw a platform for
the Democratic State convention. The coy
candidate said: "I would not presume to draft a
platform. There is one thing I would say, however,
and that is, that the platform should be so drawn
that it will not conflict with the platform already
drawn by one of the great reform parties."
Why, then, have a Democratic party at all? Why
not let the Populists, as "one of the reform parties,"
take the lead?
Maguire's opinion being that the platforms must
not conflict, of course they must be identical. As he
is under orders to accept the Populist nomination
and platform, and the time for such acceptance is
nearly up, he is naturally anxious that the two
horses he is to ride shall be going in the same direc
tion. His anxiety in the matter Is proof that the
Democratic horse, left to his sweet and equine will,
would go in the opposite direction to the Populist
beast, thus endangering the little Judge's political
anatomy. But the horse is not to have his will.
He must canter in unison with the Populist pacer,
while the Judge, with well chalked buskins, vaults
through the hoops.
Verily it is a spectacle for gods and men. the latter
being old-time Democrats, to see at the head of the
ticket a man who sprouted on the sand lot, bolted
the Democratic party in 1886, and formally and per
manently withdrew from it in 1887, and now informs
it that its principles are not in conflict with Popu
lism, which represents everything- against which
Democracy has arrayed itself for nearly a century.
Looking over Maguire's record as an office holder
under a Republican city administration, as a sand
lotter, as a chronic bolter, as a permanent fugitive
from the party by his own act, and as a Populist
nominee for Governor, the steadfast Democrat may
well ask himself. "What is the reward of party fidelity
and party work?"
If by bolting the party year after year, and cursing
and quitting it, a man can get three terms in Con
gress and the nomination for Governor, what is the
use of packing a torch, going around odorous of
kerosene and shouting for the regular ticket?
These questions are for the faithful to answer.
Our advice to them is to bolt the bolter, to quit the
quitter, and by giving him a dote of his own medi
cine perhaps win the same honors which now crown
his infidelity to every party obligation and his treason
to every party principle.
Some of General Wheeler's staff plucked a large
number of leaves from the tree he climbed to get a
view of the field during the march on Santiago, and
sent them to Alabama as campaign documents to
help the general in his fight for re-election. The
idea was a pretty one and is bound to win. When
the polls are closed it will be found that the general's
competitors are up a tree and he's all right.
"Lord Charles Beresford," says the Philadelphia
Times, "is the eldest son of the Marquis of Water
ford and belongs to a daring family. His second
brother, Lord William, married the widowed Duchess
of Marlborough." Enough said.
While it may be a fact that Dewey encouraged
Augusti to run away, there is no probability that the
admiral had to give the captain general more than a
gentle hint.
Officers of the German warships hovering about
Manila are said to be extremely reticent. They will
rot even go so far as to state what business they had
to be there.
Probably Congressman Hilborn, in his thoughtful
moments, has doubts as to the beauty and integrity
of the primary system.
There are methods by which the Tennessee boys
might have more fun than by tearing down houses
and paying for them.
They will be making Hay in the State office as
toon as Day is past, but what kind of way is that to
keep the proverb?
Democrats can comfort themselves after election
by claiming that it was merely a Populistic defeat
anyhow.
- We shall not have a full measure of honor to whom
honor is due in this country until Dewey is an ad
miral.
The Populist pill was swallowed, but there was no
attempt on the part of Democracy to conceal its wry
face.
Maguire may straddle two platforms in public, but
as soon as he gets out of public sight he will sit
down on one.
Blanco was for war to the "bitter end." The end
is here, and he still kicks. Isn't it "bitter" enough?
Fresno should not be discouraged. Chicago had a

BOSS McNflÃ'S "ARGUMENT."
THOSE who may be curious enough to examine
political bossism in some of its phases should
peruse the speech delivered at Sacramento on
Tuesday by Gavin McNab of the "reunited" De
mocracy of this city. The argument of this dis
penser of new and undefiled Democracy was unique,
original and persuasive, and we predict that when it
has been thoroughly circulated it will take high rank
among the forensic efforts of our time. It is certain
to stand unrivaled until some one can produce a
more extraordinary specimen of logic, or a conven
tion can be found which will encourage the creation
of a bigger fool political scheme than has been con
ceived by the whispering boss.
Mr. McNab declares that the arbitrary action of
the Democratic State Committee in wresting the
party organization in this city from the control of
the politicians who had won it by the usual methods
was justified by the alleged fact that the leaders of
the party had entered the employ of the Southern
Pacific Company and other corrupt and corrupting
corporations. In other words, according to this re
markable boss, the time had arrived when, in order
to prevent the Democracy from falling into the
hands of Rainey and the railroad, the State Com
mittee was authorized to resort to any means, no
matter how un-Democratic or despotic.
The notable feature of this argument is found in
the broad premises upon which it is based. Boss
McNab starts off by assuming that Gould, Alford
and himself are "honest"; that they may be trusted
anywhere; that they are moved by patriotism only;
that their motives cannot be questioned; that the
people confide in them and have appointed them to
rescue the Government from the hands of those who
would corrupt and despoil it â in short, that they
are the pure of the pure, and that they are com
missioned at all times to judge of the purity of
others.
Perhaps we need not remind Boss McNab that
the argument he has used to bolster up his case at
Sacramento has been used by every bloody tyrant
who in all history has oppressed the world. Boss
McNab knows this as well as we do. He has studied
that argument in school, and in youthful debating
societies has doubtless railed against it. He knows
that when once the right of a political leader to pass
upon the motives of his opponents is conceded there
is an end of civic liberty and tyranny supervenes.
He knows that his assumption of purity is illogical
and that his scheme for taking possession of a polit
ical party by force cannot be justified on any such
ground.
But it is probably useless to argue with Boss Mc-
Nab. A man who will lay before an intelligent
body of citizens such a case as he presented at Sacra
mento on Tuesday is beyond reason. Nor do we
believe the convention accepted his argument as con
clusive, notwithstanding it indorsed his plans and
agreed to divide the plunder of this city with him.
Boss McNab wants to get control of the government
of San Francisco, and he has succeeded in making
the Democrats of the State believe that his scheme
will work. It has been agreed to shut the Harney
ites out and divide the local plunder among the
members of the State Committee. This is addition,
division and silence, not logic.
THE NAVAL PROMOTIONS.
PUBLIC opinion is by no means satisfied with
the promotions thus far accorded to the naval
heroes who have in this war so gloriously up
held the traditions of our flag upon the ocean. The
press of all sections of the Union demand that further
honors be bestowed, and in this popular sentiment
is clearly reflected.
Concerning the promotions granted Sampson and
Schley there is, indeed, some difference of opinion.
Prior to the outbreak of the war Schley stood higher
on the naval register than Sampson. In promoting
them recently the President advanced Sampson eight
numbers and Schley six numbers. This has led to
a good deal of adverse criticism in some quarters, the
argument of the critics being that Schley, having
chased Cervera into Santiago and being in actual
command of the fleet at the time of the battle that
destroyed the Spanish fleet, his promotion should at
least have been equal to that accorded to Sampson,
and the relative ranks of the two maintained as be
foie.
Against the argument of the critics it is urged that
the President has a fuller knowledge of the com
parative services of the two commanders than is
possessed by the public, and it is therefore reasona
ble to assume he acted upon good and sufficient
grounds when he gave the higher promotion to
Sampson. Furthermore, it is pointed out that Samp
son directed the naval campaign in the West Indies,
and although he was not in command on the day
of battle, the victory is none the less his, since it
resulted from his strategy and was won by tactics he
had ordered.
With the exception of this controversy concerning
the relative deserts of Sampson and Schley, there is
perfect unanimity of opinion on the whole subject
of naval promotions. Eastern papers are as earnest
as are those on this coast in urging that Captain Clark
of the Oregon be raised to the rank of commodore.
He performed the greatest feat that nas been accom
plished with a modern battleship, and by his skill
displayed as a seaman in the long voyage around the
Horn, as well as by his courage in the combat off
Santiago, has merited a higher promotion than that
of advancement on the list of captains.
As regards Dewey, there is but one voice, and that
is expressed not only universally, but with ardor.
The country demands that for him there shall be
revived the rank of admiral, and that he be accorded
every honor given to the illustrious Farragut. His
services in the war have been greater than those of
any other man. He has not only won battles for
us and captured cities, but he has, by his skillful con
duct, maintained the prestige of the nation at Ma
nila under circumstances that required for the ac
complishment of that work diplomatic sagacity and
firmness of a high order.
Dewey has in truth proven himseff to be one of
the greatest naval commanders of all time. He has
shown high administrative abilities as well as fighting
qualities. He could govern the Philippines if called
upon to do so, and achieve in that work as great a
success as he did in taking them. He has fully
merited the title of admiral, and the nation will not
be satisfied if Congress does not revive the office and
bestow it upon him in time for him to receive it as
a Christmas gift.
People who have been predicting a war between
Great Britain and Russia have only to keep on in
order to make a record as prophets. The thing is
bound to happen after a while.
It is doubtful if there is any other such pay gravel
on earth as that which is found in this city by those
who get contracts for street improvements.
The final proof of prosperity is at hand. It is an
nounced that Kansas is out of debt.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 19, 1898.
BLOND AND BAILEY TURNED DOWN.
DURING the closing weeks of the recent session
of Congress abundant evidence was given
that the Democratic leaders had determined
to substitute a war issue for the money question in
the coming campaign. The vote in Oregon showed
them that nothing could be expected of the free silver
cry this year. A new slogan was needed to rally
the scattered clans, and, accordingly, they resolved to
go to the couiHry denouncing what they were pleased
to call the "imperialism" of the Republican party.
These tactics, adopted in a moment of desperation,
have not been found adequate to the occasion. On
the contrary, two conspicuous chiefs have been
brought to grief by them already, and the campaign
is yet young. Bailey raised the new cry in Texas
and the State convention of his party turned him
down. Bland raised it in Missouri and met the
same fate. The Democratic masses in those great
States are too patriotic and too loyal to follow a
fight against the administration on an issue that is
clearly one of the war problems of the country. In
those two States, at any rate, the coming contest
will not be disturbed by clamors against a fictitious
imperialism, and baseless denunciations of the foreign
policy of the President.
As a matter of fact, the cry of imperialism raised
by the Democrats in Congress was one of the most
foolish blunders ever committed even by that party
of blunderers. It has no foundation upon which
to 'rest. The administration has conducted the war
with singular moderation, and the Republican party
has taken no step that justifies even a suspicion of
anything like imperialism. The President has moved
slowly from point to point, as the emergencies of
the war required, and has had the support of the
great body of the people in every action from first
to last. To no single deed or word of his can the
Democratic leaders point' to justify a campaign of
opposition.
It is clear from what has taken place in Texas and
Missouri that the Democratic masses are becoming
impatient of the fatuous leadership of such men as
Bailey and Bland. They know that the conduct of
our foreign policy is in safe hands, and they are
sufficiently patriotic to say so. Moreover, most of
them have sense enough to know that for the Demo
cratic party to make the campaign this fall one of
opposition to the war measures of the Government
would be to invite destruction. No considerable
number of people of any party will vote to hamper
the hands of the President in this emergency.
It is reported that when, in his speech to the Mis
souri Democrats, Mr. Bland asked: "Are you going
to ratify a treaty here? Are you going to approve
in advance a treaty the Republican party has yet to
make? Are you ready to annex Porto Rico before
you know anything about it?" a voice from
the body of the convention shouted back, "You bet!"
The answer was sufficient, but it was made more
emphatic by the vote that turned Mr. Bland down
when the question was put. The campaign against
so-called "imperialism has therefore collapsed at the
start. Democracy in Texas and in Missouri, as
elsewhere, will make this fight on State issues only.
NOW f OR c MERCHANT MARINE.
ALL indications point to the conclusion that the
restoration of peace will be followed by a
marked increase of activity in our foreign
commerce. This is not because the war impeded our
trade and that a revival will come with the removal
of the impediment, but because new channels of trade
will be opened, new marttets provided for our prod
ucts and new fields for our enterprise.
For a long time past our commerce has been ex
panding, and recently the expansion has been one of
the notable features of the world's development. In
every nation on the globe the effects of our com
petition have been felt. Moreover our exports are
no longer confined mainly to agricultural products
or other forms of raw material. We are now among
the great manufacturing peoples of the earth, and
exports of our manufactured goods are increasing by
leaps and bounds.
In one respect only have we been lagging behind
the most vigorous nations of the globe. We have
not provided the merchant marine needed to trans
port our goods abroad. Our expanding commerce
is carried on chiefly through foreign ships. We still
pay a tribute to European ship-owners for carrying
our trade for us. Our products of farm and^ mine and
factory are seen almost everywhere, but our flag is
not conspicuous among the ships gathered in the sea
ports where the world's business is transacted.
At the present time we are prepared in every way
except one to advance in shipbuilding as rapidly as in
other lines of industry. We have the enterprise, the
money, the opportunity and the business necessary to
provide for an expansion of our merchant marine on
a grand scale. The one thing lacking is the legisla
tion requisite to place American merchant vessels on
an equal footing with those of other nations. So long
as European governments give potent aid to their
merchant marine and our Government remains neg
lectful to the claims of our own, so long will the car
rying trade of America be in foreign hands and our
commerce be forced to pay tribute to aliens.
The war itself has to a large extent stimulated ship
building. The employment of a considerable number
of merchant steamers by the Government for trans
ports diminished the tonnage available for commer
cial purposes, and as a consequence there has been an
increased demand for new ships of almost all classes.
This demand is in a fair way of being filled, for all
the shipyards of the country are busy. If Govern
mental aid can now be provided to assist the activity
already started the forward movement will attain
great proportions, and in a comparatively few years
will emancipate us from dependence on foreign ships
and make our flag familiar in all parts of the world.
It is pertinent to press this issue now. Time passes
quickly, and Congress will soon be assembled for the
winter session. At present the members of both
houses are at home among their constituents with
more or less earnestness studying the demands of the
people. It should be made clear to them that the
great mass of citizens are in favor of protection to the
shipping interests as well as to other industries of the
nation, and that a law fostering and promoting our
merchant marine is one of the measures required and
expected this winter.
As soon as Congress meets theie will be either
an investigation of the conduct of the Santiago cam
paign, or else Congress itself will be condemned.
There is a great deal of red hot music in the air on
that subject, and somebody must dance to it.
The suspicion naturally arises that many nominat
ing speeches were made yesterday simply because the
orators had kept their eloquence bottled just as long
as they could stand the pressure.
It Tinst be acknowledged that most of the adjec
tives used in the convention yesterday were misfits,
but some of them sounded well.'
Despite the heat, Montieth went to Sacramento
and got frostbitten.
MR. GAGE EXPLAINS.
To the Editor of The Call: I dislike to
discuss all of the details of the transac
tion concerning myself referred to in
the Chronicle, reports of which ft seems are
being circulated by my political enemies. The
controversy relates to affairs that arose more
than twenty-one years ago and grew out of
the partnership affairs of George Hinds and
D. W. Gage, owners of a band of sheep. D.
W. Gage was my uncle. Both he and Hindis
are dead, and most of the witnesses to the
facts of the case are also deceased. I do not
care, as I have said, to discuss all these de
tails. It Is sufficient to say that, as an out
growth of the controversy, Hinds brought a
civil suit against my uncle and myself to dis
solve the partnership, settle its affairs, dispose
of the property, divide the proceeds, etc He
also, through his attorney in this civil case,
procured an indictment to be filed against me,
charging my uncle and me with having en
tered into an unlawful conspiracy to defraud
Hinds of his interest in the band of sheep.
At the tame time Hinds made complaint
against me before Pentalpha Lodge No. 2U2,
of Free and Accepted Masons, of Los Angeles
City, of which lodge I was not a member, but
was and ever since have been a member of a
different Masonic lodge. The charges made
against me in thte complaint involved this
whole transaction, and the question was
whether I had in any part of the matter been
guilty of conduct unbecoming a Mason, or of
any wrong whatever. Mr. Hinds and his wit
nesses gave their testimony; I gave mine. The
reault was that the Masonic jury or commis
sion found a unanimous verdict in my favor,
and which fully exonerated and vindicated me
in every particular, as the affidavit of three
surviving members of this Jury, which I hand
you, shows.
The indictment was dismissed by the District
Attorney who procured it (who was also Mr.
Hinds' attorney), because he well knew that
there was no evidence whatever to sustain the
charge mnde. The civil suit never reached a
final judgment. An interlocutory decision was
rendered by the court In favor of Hinds, and
th(s decision was mainly predicated upon the
testimony of two witnesses who swore to a
conversation which they alleged I had with
my uncle, but which In truth and in fact never
did occur, nor had I ever laid my eyes upon
them until they appeared in court and testified
in that case. Thflr statement was bald per
jury. And from this decretal order I took an
appeal, but this appeal wns dismissed by the
Supreme Court because the interlocutory de
cision was not appealable. As I have said no
flnnl decision was ever reached in the case,
and hf>ncÂ»Â» no opportunity was ever given to
have the merits passed upon by the Supreme

That they are now and were at all dates
hereinafter mentioned, members of Pentalpha

That some time In the year IS7S a charge
was preferred In said lÂ»dge against Brother
Henry T. Gage by Brother George Hinds, of
unmasonlc conduct; that ficcnmpanying said
charge were several specifications, the K<n
eral effect of which was that Faid Henry T.
Gage had attempted to defraud said Hinds
of an interest in a certain band or flock of
sheep in which a relative of ?ald Henry T.
Gage, by the name of D. W. Gape, was inter
e*trd with said Hinds. That said lodge pro
ceeded according to Maisonic usages to elect
seven commissioners to investigate said
charges, and a regular trial was had : that
the undersigned were members of said commis
sion and participated In said trial. That said
Hinds and said Henry T. Gage and other wit
nesses appeared before said commissioners, and
a full Investigation was had thereon, and all
matters mentioned in the said several specifi
cations were fully and duly considered by said
commission; and after such full Investigation
the unanimous verdict of the cnmmlasi .m-ix
was that said Henry T. Gage was not guilty
of any of the charges preferred against him,
and he was thereupon exonerated, and there
after retained his good Masonic standing as
if no such charges had been made.

I for which, of course, other interests of

I of marine warfare as it haÂ« been revealed \
I by our recent encounters, its chances of

Long range will herea"fter be the usual
order of sea fighting, the superior marks

desperation, in which case his more hope

will virtually be over, with one side prac
tically defeated, before the winner will
incline to come within torpedo range.
The certainty with which torpedo boats
will be sunk by well-trained gunners, 11

value of torpedo boats pure and simple;

COUSINSâ F. S., City. The children of
brothers and sisters are called cousins,
cousins german, first cousins or full coua
ins. Often, however, the term second
cousin is loosely applied to the son or
daughter of a cousin german, more prop
erly called a first cousin once removed.
A first cousin once removed is the child's
first cousin; a first cousin twice removed
is the grandchild of one's first cousin; a
second cousin once removed is the child
of one's second cousin. A first cousin
once removed is sometimes called a sec
ond cousin, followed by a third, etc. The
relation of an individual to his father's
cousin is that of a first cousin, once re
moved, or second cousin, and his relation
to his father's cousin's child is that of
first cousin twice removed, or third
cousin. The communication relative to
A, B, C and D does not state the relation
of the principals clearly enough to admit
of an answer. The above rule as to con
sanguinity will, no doubt, help you in
solving the problem you want answered.
If thÂ«> parties do not come within the rule
quoted, then the children are not cousins.
DENSITY OF WATERâ T. S. M., Fort
Point, City. In view of the fact that the
depth of the ocean has never been fath
j omed, it is impossible to tell if a solid
piece of iron would go to the bottom. Close
to the east coast of Japan the current
flows through a marine valley, which in
1875 was sounded from the United States
steamer Tusuarora to a depth of five and
a quarter miles. . The heavy sounding
\ weight took, more than an hour to sink to
the bottom. A trial was made of a chasm
| still deeper where the lead did not fetch
; up bottom and that is said to be the only
ocean depth that remains unfathomed.
As to how far a solid piece of iron will
sink depends upon the size of the piece,
the depth of the water and its density.
Scientists assert that at a depth of 6000
feet in the ocean the wjiter is so dense
thi. t each square inch will support a weight
of 264.S pounds. If that is true a one- thou
sand pound projectile would not go to the
bottom where the depth is in excess of
6000 feet.
MERCIFUL WAR.
The Star is under the impression thÂ§t
it was General P. G. T. Beauregarcl who,
preparatory to the bloody battle ot Sbhi
loh, In general orders, cautioned his sol
diers to shoot low â to strike the lower
limbs of the enemyâ to wound rather
than to kill, for the reason that a wound
ed man almost invariably took from the
field two able-bodied attendants, while
Uit dead body was left to be cared for
at a more convenient time. The order,
bowever, whoever may have issued it,
v.'as based upon sound reasoning, and if
acted upon on every battlefield would
much more quickly put une side or the
ether hors de combat than where the
sole aim was to kill.
Evidently the inventor of the Mauser
bullet, used by the Spaniards at San
tiago, had this idea in view, and the re
sult has demonstrated the correctness of
his theory. Major Lagarde, in char^ft
of the hospitals at Siboney, states that
the number of wounded in proportion to
the killed is very materially increased,
a:id further, that the victims of the lat
est missile "show few of fhe injuries suf
fered from the old leaden bullet of larger
caliber, such as to." It is shown, also,
if such a thing is possible, to be a merci
ful bullet, for the major reports, that
while "the number of wounded is in
creased the dangerous nature of the
wounds has been wonderfully diminished,
and owing to the reduced caliber of the
projectiles amputation and resection has
been rarely necessary," and then, again,
he says, aside from wounds in organs
wtui fluid contents, the injuries lrvflicted
aie "trivial, and seldom serious enough
to compel the wounded men to keep to
tnetr beds unless the bullets should bÂ«
lodged." Even then the wounded merely
show "slight localized pneumonia."
We have heard much during our long 1
term of peace of an attempt to intro
duce more humane projectiles into the
cruel business of war, and if the re
ports of Maior Lagnrde prove to be well
founded many a wounded American sol
dier from in front of Santiago will have
reason to l>e thankful that the effort nas
proved successful.â St. Louis Post-Dis

BY HENRY JAMES,
CAL.L, HEADOUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 18.â Yesterday there
were plenty of Democrats swearing by
Uhe shade of Jefferson they would
.never submit to fusion. To-day they
meekly submitted. The ox and the
I ass are duly yoked.
â  lam bound to say the situation Is
not wholly pleasing to either member
of the team.
: ; The report of the fusion committee
was received almost as soon as the con
. vention had been called to order. There
was no opposition, no enthusiasm. The
Democrats who had threatened to
speak against it were silent, and when
a Democrat is silent he has been hard
Jtttl After fusion had gone through
with a rush Deuprey arose in his place
and- began to talk. The day was hot,
the electric fan was at rest and no
"body felt in a mood to hear remarks
from ' anybody but himself. Voices
suggested wearily that Deuprey go to
the platform and he went, despite the
;fact that Chairman Cassin declared
.thig unnecessary.
I digress to state that as a chairman
CaKsi-n is the most inadequate and
helpless person ever holding the gavel.
He does not have the faculty of con
trailing mon and he kn^ws no more
about parliamentary law than an ele
phant does of rope walking.
Po Deuprey tnnk the platform. He
explained hoarsely, for some of the
thunder he has hurled has strained his
vi-.ral. cords, that he did not think the
gamg- should be delayed until the adop
tion; of the platform, but should pro
ceed' at once to nominations.
â â â  Th'.e plan was accepted, for the can
aidWtes would have to stand on the
platform when they got one anyhow, j
There was a little noise, some talking, i
ho; attention to Cassin and then Al- j
ford came forward.
To this young man had been dele
gated 1 the task of nominating a can
didate for the Governorship and there
was a suspicion that Maguire would
â be the- choice. Such proved to be the
"casi?; .. . Alford had a speech all ready.
Considered apart from its delivery, It |
Vfis hot a bad one. It told of the |
mallow light of history and the camp- i
"hires .of progress, touched upon Indus- |
trial freedom, and to the accompani- j
merit of casual and modest applause,
finally reached Maguire. Then there j
.trere yells, but nothing indicating a j
wild, enthusiasm.
I was surprised at this.
Maguire being regarded as the only j
man on the cross-bred ticket sup- |
poRPd to have a ghost of a show of
election, there might have been an ex
cuse for noise. Alford proceeded to |
Say. that In the presence of Maguire
eulogy, stood mute, and then launched
into a wild encomium which boosted
Maguire far above the clouds and left
him bereft of human company, but
thrilled by the flutter of angel wings.
I had not known that Maguire was
so good. If all Alford said is true.
heaven is Maguire's home.
â¢â¢:: Senator White's seconding speech
was- dignified, marked by many strong
points and happy in its allusions to
th-e soldiers' and sailors' recent
triumphs by land and sea. It was not
lacking in quality of pathos and the
reserved tone in which it was deliv
ered added much to its effectiveness.
There was in it no trace of the bitter
ness which had marked Alford's, which
â¢seemed to have been colored by a no
tion that the press had been unkind.
"-â . Here came nominations to the Su
preme bench. I violate no confidence
in saying that they were a weariness
to the soul. Every man with a can
didate to propose had also a speech of
great length and inutility. He ap
peared to feel it incumbent to give the
biography of the aspirant, not only
.from the cradle to the glorious pres
ent, but for about three generations
.back and an eternity ahead. He would
'.amble on with a riot of words and
phrases, with laree chunks of personal
and wholly uninteresting history. The
speaker would express his own emo- j
tlons. perspiring the while profusely, j
growing red in face, bending, gesticu
lating, and in the audience others
woujd be waiting for a chance to do
. the same thing.
â .â  The speeches should have been llm- j
lted to two minutes. I did not time j
therft. Probably they averaged ten or ;
twelve minutes, but they struck the
senses as about an hour and a half |
each. Between the speeches Cassin j
would beg that order be preserved, but |
he could not induce any one to take j
his view of it. After all the speeches
devoted to eulogizing everything In j
sight, to memory dear, or extent In j
: the vague realm of hope, the flow of I
â eloquence was dammed, so that action
: .eoutd be taken concerning the plat
form. I. trust the esteemed compositor
will spell the word clammed correctly,
although, except for morality's sake, 'he
ought to spell it the other way.
. : The platform was read in a droning
monotone calculated to induce slumber.
It received little attention, excited
hardly a ripple of cheering and as it
conformed to the programme in all re
spects was adopted. Just as the norni- J
nation of Maguire was made by accla
mation. There was simply no other
course to take.
While the convention dragged along
â¢there were members outside who were i
attending to other prescribed details, j
Barry got the ' nomination in the j
Fourth Congressional District, but not j
until McNab had it offered to him with
a string attached. With a gesture
patterned after that used by Caesar,
when he rejected a crown, McNab mo- i
tioned the bauble away and the string
was pulled.
After recess occurred the event of
the dayâ Maguire's speech.
It was a sensible, moderate effort,
listened to attentively and received
with every token of respect. But still
there was a chronic absence of enthu
siasm. The cheers were perfunctory
and soon died away. Maguire's as
sociate on the ticket also appeared. He
was a stranger to most of the dele
gates and will probably remain so-
Kvertheless he was heard respectful
which may reasonably be construed
a compliment.
Thile a roll call on Supreme Court
idldates was in progress, Mr. Ma
guire was among his friends on the
floor.
I could not help wondering why he
should wait to enter what seems now
a hopeless race for the Governorship
when he could, If he wished, remain
in CongTess. The Governorship Is a
thankless job, with not enough patron
age to go around, and a term in the
chair certain to end amid the assaults
of a crop of enemies in one's own
party. And a campaign for the Gov
ernorship, backed by disgruntled Dem
ocrats and Populists who have grabbed
most of the places and regret not hav
ing grabbed all, does not seem to me
rich in promise.
A notable feature of the second roll
call was the effort of some of the Los
Angeles men to break away from gag
rule, by which they had been voted in
every proposition. They were not al
lowed the breakawa- Patton and
the other prominent members could not
understand why their fteretofore tract
able followers should haye presumed
to have minds of their own. The pre
sumption could not be sustained. Lo

leantime Dockweiler has assumei

the task too much for him. It re
luired Dockweiler about two second
Ktralghten out this disorderly rab
which was standing or moving
it, talking and laughing with total
disregard of the frantic plea of Cas
3in. Some people have greatness thrust
upon them and it proves a misfit. Cas
sin belongs to this class. During the
final moments of the struggle, and
after the fact had become plain that
Coffey would be defeated, I noticed lit
tle Andy Lawrence sitting in the atti
tude of despair. He had been the big
bug of the Coffey fight.
He had given odds to Mayor Phelan,
conferred with Tarpey and buzxed like
a bee, hopped like a cricket, as his
wont; snorted, ranted, tore his hair,
struck his Napoleonic pose; he had
scowled, been terrible as Jove, impll
cable as death, devastating as a cy
clone. People had looked at him and
trembled. He had looked at them and
they had shriveled vp â yet he got It
in the neck.
It is a pity that a man like Coffey,
impelled by a worthy ambition to seek
a place on the Supreme bench, should
be weighted, hampered, crippled, by
having to appear as the candidate of a
characterless nobody, whom luck has
foisted into a temporary show of in
fluence. When the convention under
stood that Andy was back of Coffey
opposition to Coffey gained strength it
could have obtained in no other way.
Matters were worse when Los An
geles came to the rescue of the San
Francisco contingent. In their eager
ness to rebuke the cheek of Andy and
teach Los Angeles a lesson, the other
delegates united, and the fate of the
Coffey boom was sealed. Both of
fenders deserved the rebuke, but It
was hard on Coffey. Los Angeles has
earned the distinction of being the
most unpopular delegation in the hall,
and Andy of being one of the most
shameless men in California.
So, for their sakes, the knife was put
Into San Francisco.
It was at this stage of the proceed
ings that Andy gathered himself Into
a darkened room and mourned as one
who could not he comforted.
During the closing moments of the
contest there was a remarkable scene.
With a little stronger element of anger
it might have been a riot. Poor Cas
sin pounded and shouted, and when the
people got ready they permitted quiet
to be restored. The sergeant-at-arms
had been instructed to corral the tur
bulent. He did not try it. They sim
ply came back when they got ready
and they turned a triumphant torrent
of votes In Conley's favor. The last
moments of this vote were marked by
a desperate struggle, a veritable pan
demonium, through which the thump
of the gavel beat an irregular anvil
chorus. Hats were thrown Into the
air, and men gesticulated wildly,
standing on their chairs until Jostled
off. But It was enthusiasm and some
thing of the kind had been needed.
When Judge Conley came forward to
make a speech there was quiet. It '
was a boon. There had not been any
worth remembering for several hours.
Thanks are due the "Examiner man
agement for the distribution of that
paper In the convention each morning.
It can be folded so as to make a very
acceptable fan, and drive away the
heat while one Is reading The Call. I
happened to see that an article in It
yesterday had been written by Al
phonso Murphy, and this morning that
there was one from Al Murphy. Mr.
Murphy explains that his name is real

called it Murphy for fear the Demo
crats would think him a dude, and that
while he descended from a Spanish
grandee, he does not believe in swell-

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 19, 1898.
| McNab and shining with the radiance
of Los Angeles' purity.
Th^re was an expectation that the
! evening session would be short, being
j based upon a belief that the lambs had
been selected in advance for the slaugh
ter and little remained but to name
them.
This expectation was not realized.
I Proceedings were matter of fact, with
!no greater tumult than was raised
when the chairman ordered the "gen
tleman with the white pants to 3it
! down."
Among the curiosities of the conven
tion is the nomination to Ccmgress of
J. Aubrey Jones, who 19 a Silver Re

Democrats do not propose to sacrifice
themselves, so long as the vicarious
method remains available. If there is
a fighting chance the Democrats tum
>ble over each other to get it. If noth
ing but the upholding of a principle is
at stake they want somebody else to
uphold it.
A convention is a good place for the
study of human nature. Men forget
their manners, as Mayor Phelan for

When a gentleman named Rogers
was nominated for Surveyor General
the fact came up that he was a Popu
list He was called for and 1 must say
that he manifested every outward
symptom of a Populist of the middle
of-the-road sort. But he told that he
had voted for Democratic nominees for
the Presidency from LewiÃ Cass to
Bryan and for Democratic Governors
from Burnett to Budd. They cheered
him shouted for him, waved their hats
and' then beat him. Now, according to
contract, he must get off the Populist
ticket. As a rule the evening was as
devoid of incident as a fish is of feath
ers Nominating speeches were limited
to three minutes and they would have
been improved by a limit of three sec
onds. As to the details of the various
little fights they are hardly important
enough to record. Members became
quiescent toward the last. To have
aroused them to a scrapping frame of
mind would have required more provo
cation than anybody had the energy to
give. They made a moderate and seem
ly uproar over Woodman's triumph.
There was a vote of thanks to the
officers of the convention. I did not
see why, but the resolution was
amended so as to include the people of
Sacramento. I could understand. Just
at midnight the chairman made his
last blunder, the convention came to
an end. Graveyards yawned and so
did most of the people in the pavilion.
DAVIS FQR PARDEE.
The Former Will Abide by the De-
cision of the Primaries.
CALL HEADQI'ARTERS, Oakland,
Aug. 18.â An effort is being made among
that large element of the Republican
party of this county that has
for years been the friend of
both Dr. Pardee and Mr. Davis, to
have the latter nominate the doctor at
the State convention next week. The
matter has not yet been presented to
either of the gentlemen, nor will it be
until it is certain that the idea will meet
with favor from all concerned.
Much good feeling has been created by
the fact that on Saturday evening as
soon as the result of the primaries was
known Mr. Davis went to his office and
wrote several very frank straightforward
letters to some of his leading supporters.
In these letters he positively stated that
he wanted no one who had worked for
him to entertain the slightest ill-feeling
over the result of the primaries, but to
do all in his power to furt-.er the can
didacy of Dr. Pardee. He requested that
no criticisms be made, no personal views
exploited, but that everytning be done
to insure the nomination of an Alameda
County man for Governor. It is conceded
on all sides that Mr. Davis has proved
to be the gamest loser Alameda County
has ever known. The idea of trying to
bring about such a situation by which Mr.
Davis would nominate Dr. Pardee is sole
ly for the purpose of fostering the fact
that Alameda, although lighting within
Itself for a year, is now a unit in its
choice of a man for the head of the
ticket. Mr. Davis Is well known as one
of the leading Republican orators of the
State, and the majority of the Alameda
County Republicans are anxious that he
should place the name of Pardee before
the convention at Sacramento next week.
The main topic of conversation to-day
is the great sweep made by Victor Met
calf yesterday, in which he completely
routed Mr. Hilborn's forces in Alameda,
Contra Costa and Yolo counties. There
is a very close vote in the Fiftieth As
sembly District which Mr. Hilborn's
friends declare will result in his favor,
should the district be recounted. There
are, however, but ten votes in the dis
trict, and even should they all be con.
ceded to Mr. Hilborn, Mr. Metcalf still
has more than enough to nominate in
Alameda County alone, without the seven
from Yolo, the nine from Contra Costa,
the three from Solano, and probably one
from Lake, of which he is certain. In
the Fiftieth District Is the Second Ward,
wherein lives Superintendent Leach of
the Mint, and Councilman F. R. Girard.
It Is the largest district geographically,
but one of the smallest In point of votes.
Last night Metcalf led Hilborn by two
votes, the figures being 891 and 893 re- \
spectively. A closer Inspection of a few
scratched ballots has made the figures
equal with two ballots that will probably ;
be construed as being favorable to Met
calf. It is not at all unlikely that pure
ly from political etiquette this district
will be allowed to Air. Hilborn, out of
courtesy partly to him and partly to Mr. ;
Leach.
Mr. Motcalf. discussing his success to- !
day, said: "The very handsome Indorse
ment which my candidacy has received
cannot be other than a source of pro- ;
found gratification to me. I do not, how
ever, for a moment forget the responsi
bilities which follow. It will be my life
long endeavor to justify the confidence
reposed in me. I know that the only
return desired is that I shall serve my
district and its people faithfully and ener
getically and that I shall certainly do.
I am not unmindful that my success is
Mr. Hilborn's defeat. Toward him I
have none but the kindliest feelings, and j
of him I have never said a word of dls- .
paraÃement. The choice was fairly left j
to the voters with such odds In Mr. Hil- j
horn's favor as belong to the man In of
fice against the untried candidate."
Judge NuHbaume.r, who has managed
Mr. Metcalf'B campaign, made a state
ment to The Call last Tuesday, In which
he said that Alameda would go solid for I
Metcalf and have twenty-three votes
from outsldo counties. He is now con- [
gratulatingr himself that his prediction [
has been verified with the exception that (
Metcalf has twenty-two Instead of twen- i
ty-three outside votes.
One of the warmest centers of the con- '
filet was Mr. Hllborn's home ward, the
Seventh. On the night before the pri
maries some of Metcalf's friends would j
not have bet a cent on that ward, but
the result showed that a complete change
had come over It, for Mr. Metcalf ob- I
talned a majority of forty-one. Postmas
ter Friend, who is chairman of the Third i
District Congressional committee, kept i
aloof from the war during yesterday. His i
son. W. Nat Friend, president of the
Fifth Ward Pardee Club, rendered faith
ful service to the man who had rewarded !
his father, and the result shows that his
precinct in the Fifth Ward gave Mr. Htl- '
born a majority of seventeen. The cam
paign made by Mr. Metcalf's managers
was undoubtedly the most perfect, ag
gressive and intelligent ever put up in
Alameda County. Those who worked
most actively in the successiul candi
date's behalf were Judge Nusbaumer.

CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Cal., Auk. 18.â In tho First Con
gressional District Convention there
were some differences to adjust before
the fusion programme could be carried
out. J. F. Farrahar of Slsklyou was
elected chairman and C. O. Dunbar of
Sonoma secretary. Mr. Dunbar wanted
to have a committee appointed to see If a
trade could not be made whereby the
Populists would take the Third District
and give the Democrats the First Dis
trict.
Delegate Cutler declared that the re
port of the fusion committee had been
adopted by the general convention, and
that the Congressional could not now
overturn that agreement. Mr. Cutler
said that the First District must nomi
nate a Populist and there was no way
out of it. Still Delegate Dunbar kicked,
but without avail.
T. B. Dozler of Shasta stated that
while he was originally opposed to the
fusion programme It had been adopted
and he was now in favor of standing by
it.
M. E. Dlttmar, the Populist from Shas
ta County, who nominated T. "W. H.
Shanahan for Governor in the Populist
convention, was then nominated for Con
gress by the Democratic convention. J.
C. Ruddlck of Mendocino and T. B. Do
zier of Shasta were chosen as members
at large of the State Central Committee,
and the convention adjourned.
SECOND CONGRESSIONAL.
The Second Congressional District Con
vention met during the afternoon and or
ganized by the election of A. Dlxon of
Placer as chairman and D. W. Carml
chael of Sacramento as secretary.
E. Thompson of San Joaquin placed in
nomination the name of Marion DeVries,
Incumbent, for the office. There was no
opposition to DeVries, and he was nom
inated by acclamation.
After the selection of Peter J. Shields
of Sacramento and J. D. Sproule of Butte
as State committeemen, and the appoint
ment of the regular committee, DeVries
thanked the convention for the honor,
and it adjourned â¢with cheers for the
nominee.
THIRD CONGRESSIONAL.
Although the Third Congressional Dis
trict had been accorded by the fusion
agreement to the Democrats, no Demo
cratic candidate could be found, so the
honor fell upon the shoulders of a Silver
Republican in the person of John Aubrey
Jones of Frultvale, Alameda County.
Chairman Ed E. Leake called the con
vention to order.
Nominations for Congress being in or
der, Delegate Lund of Alameda presented
the name of John Aubrey Jonea, a Silver
Republican.
John Nixon of Yolo said that he had
never seen John Aubrey Jones and he
would like to view him to ascertain
whether or not he ha<l "a Congressional
head or not."
Mr. Jones thereupon appeared and made
a speech, explaining how he had been a
Republican, a Silver Republican and now
a Democrat.
The following Congressional committee
was named:
Alameda, M. J. Laymance; Colusa, F.
H. Abel; Contra Costa, W. D. Woolbert;
Glenn, George Featherstone; Lake, Dan
Jones; Yolo, M. A. Nourse; Solano, J. T.
Ryan.
After naming the following auditing
committee the convention adjourned: F.
W. Voigt. M. J. Laymance. E. J. Lund, R.
M. Fitzgerald and W. C. Price.
FOURTH CONGRESSIONAL.
James H. Barry was nominated for
Congress in the Fourth District to-day
after Gavin McNab, according to pro
gramme arranged by the friends of both,
had -declined the nomination. The work
was carried out in neat shape. There was
only one-little hitch when one of , the del
egates who was not on the "inside" called
attention to the act-that more votes had
been cast in one district than there were
delegates present. It was explained to
him that it was a simple mistaKe, but he
asked for a rollcall ana It was shown that
McNab had , been given one more vote
than he was entitled to. A vote more or
less did not matter either way, as all that
McNab was looking for was a "vindica
tion." He tried the "vindication" with
the assistance of some of Barry's friends
and then carried out his part of the play
by declining the nomination. Senator
Sam Braunhart and W. P. Lawlor, who
were in the contest, did not receive even
a "mention."
It was a pleasant little love feast, and
when the programme was. completed and
Barry declared the "unanimous choice"
of the convention, he said some very nice
and pretty things about McNab. This
was all part of the play. : s. -;-
The convention met during recess hour
and went into permanent organization by
the election of T. W. B. Leland as chair
man and E. P. B. Troy secretary.
When nominations were declared in or
der Max Popper took the platform to pre
sent McNab name to the convention.
He , said McNab , was â¢ the equal "of Ma
guire in honesty, ability and integrity.
Barry was placed in nomination by
Walker C. Graves, who described him as
a bold, fearless and Incorruptible Demo
crat and a worthy successor of Congress
man Maguire. The nomination of Barry
was seconded by R. P. Doolan, L. - -M.
Manzer and Dr. C. C. Clinton. A call of
the roll was then ordered with, the fol
lowing result: - .". t
Twenty-eighth Districtâ Barry 6, Mc-
Nab 1. - . -P'2?**
Twenty-ninth Districtâ 2, Mc-
Nab 8.
Thirtieth Districtâ Barry 4, McNab 5.
Thirty-first Districtâ Barry 5. McNab 6.
Thirty-second Districtâ McNab 8.
Thirty-third Districtâ Barry 8, McNab 1.
Thirty-ninth Districtâ Barry 6. McNab 1.
Forty-second Districtâ Barry 1, Mc-
Nab 5.
Forty-third Districtâ 5.
Forty-fourth Districtâ Barry 2, McNab 5
Forty-fifth Districtâ 1, McNab 5.
Totalâ Barry 35 and McNab 50.
When the thirtieth District was called
the chairman of the delegation announced
the vote to be 3 for Barry and 6 for Mc-
Nab. One of the Barry delegates, in
acknowledging that an agreement had
been made to give McNaD a large-sized
"vindication." demanded a roll call and
thÂ« vote recorded was Barry 4. McNab o.
Senator Braunhart explained that only
a little mistake had hern made.
When the Thirty-third District was re
ported Deputy Sheriff Curtis an
nounced 9 votes for Barry. â¢
5 Max Popper objected, as he held one of
the proxies, and he wanted to cast it
for McNnb. Curtis explained that he
thought the unit rule prevailed. The ex
planation seemed satisfactory, for notn
lntr further was said about the matter.
When the result was announced the Mc-
Nab men gave throe cheers and were an
swered by cheers for Barry.
McNnb then stepped to the front and
paid that while he greatly appreciated
the honor conferred on him he was forced
to decline the nomination. "Nothing
would please me more than to work ana
fight for the people at Washington
paid he "as I have in the past fought
here to secure the overthrow of boPsiÃm,
and while I say it myself, the organiza
tion we now have is to a great extent due
to mv labors. I have worked unceasingly
for over one year and with the assistance
of others succeeded in dethroning the
bosses. Under these circumstances it
would leave me open to the charge of in
delicacy. I appreciate the honor, as much
as if I could accept the nomination. As
an honorable man. however. I could not
let the work of decency accomplished
be Impugned by any selfish motives."
These remarks were received with ap
plause and T.owry of the Thirty-first Dis
trict moved that Barry be nominated by
acclamation. The motion was carried and
again cheers were given for McNab and
""have Just listened to the remarks and
declination of Gavin McNab." said Barry,
"and they are so laudable that they must
commend themselves to his most bitter
enemies. He has enemies, bo have I. I
am glad of those I have and I presume
that he is also glad. When a man is
ready to sacrifice his dearest ambition for
a cause in which he believes sincerely,
he is entitled to the respect of all men. If
I am elected to Congress to succeed
James G. Maguire. I pledge you that I
will work Incessantly in the interests of
the people and true Democracy. I thank
you for the confidence you have shown in
me. and from now on until election day
my voice will be raised In the fight for
Democracy." ' i-;.*-;.. â¢;
McNab said that his district was enti
tled to two members of the State Central
Committee and that he thought that it
would only be a fitting reward to pay to
Clltus Harbour and M. H. Hernan to elect
them by acclamation. "Both of these
gentlemen." said he. "have been working

SIXTH CONGRESSIONAL.
The Sixth Congressional District was
programmed, and everything the conven
tion did after it assembled went through
in a perfunctory sort of a way for the
programme.
Charles A. Barlow, the Populist incum
bent from San Luis Obispo, was renomi
nated without opposition.
Dr. R. W. Hill of Los Angeles called the
convention to order.
Earl Rogers of Los Angeles was named
chairman and John Harrington of Santa
Barbara secretary.
Bryce Grimes, a silver-haired old gen
tleman from Ventura, placed Mr. Barlow
in nomination. He said that he had been
a Democrat for forty-six years, and that
he thought that his long years of service
entitled him to state that he never ad
vocated anything he did not think was
for the benefit of the party. Under these
circumstances he presented the name of
Mr. Barlow.
Senator Stephen M. White, in seconding
the nomination, said that two years ago
he had opposed Barlow's selection as the
Democratic nominee. But in two years,
the Senator said, he had changed his
opinion of Mr. Barlow. He had found him
to be an able Congressman â a hard-work
ing representative, and always voting conÂ«
sistently with the Democrats in the lower
house of Congress.
Senator White referred to Mr. Barlow's

The delegates evidently agreed with
Senator White, for they forthwith pro

There was a call for Mr. Barlow to come
forward, but the delegates decided they
would hear from him later and proceeded
with the business of the convention.

SAN RAFAEL, Aug. 18.â The county
convention for the purpose of electing

Congressional conventions at Sacramento

Mayor Phelan's Political Advisors
Charged With Breaking Faith
by San Diego Delegates.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 18.â Several members of
the San Diego County delegation were
much wrought up this evening. They as
serted that Mr. Fay, the private secre
tary of Mayor Phelan, had come to them
and assured them that if San Diego
County would cast its solid vote to seat
the delegation of the Committee of One
Hundreds from San Francisco, in return
for that favor San Francisco would cast
its solid vote of 154 for Judge Hughes for
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.
Earl Rogers of Los Angeles County
states that he was present at the time
Mr. Fay made this pledge. San Diego
County cast its solid vote for the McNab-
Phelan delegation, but when the roll was
called on the nominees for Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court, Judge
Hughes received only a scattering vote
from San Francisco. This was a surprise
to the San Diego delegates, and It waa
something they had not looked for.
Later they learned that Gavin McNab,
Mayor Phelan and Andy Lawrence had
determined to force the nomination of
Judge Coffey against that gentleman's ex
pressed desire. Upon learning of this, the
friends of Judge Hughes decided to with
draw him and throw their support to
Judge Conley. This they did and thereby
his nomnation was secured. The San
Diego delegates will not forget the double
dealing of Mr. Fay, and they claim they
will camp on the trail of the political
purists from San Francisco until they
have an opportunity to even up tha
score.

Judge Conleyâ Mr. Chairman and gen
Â«< men of the State convention: I cannot
find appropriate words to express my ap- I
preciation for the honor that has Just
" been conferred on me. I know that this j
â¢ convention has listened to lengthy ad
dresses to-day and I know that it is late
and that you probably desire to take a
recess. I want to tell you. however, that
a lot of talking has been done on the out- ;
side, and I hope at the time the next
Democratic State convention is in session
that the gentlctnen from San Francisco
.will have as high a regard for me as they i
have for that pure and able jurist. Judge
J. D. Coffey. [Applause.] All the gen
tlemen who were aspirants for this posi
tion are personal friends of mine, and I
know that when the delegates go to their
homes they can say at least that there
was one fight in this convention that en
gendered no personal differences. Gen
tlemen of the convention, i will not de
tain you any longer. I simply desire to
say that I am older than I was a week
. ago. [Laughter.] I am 32 years of age.
I went to the county of Madera a stran
ger and was elected to the position which
I now hold, and I pledge that Madera in
the coming campaign will give a rousing
majority for the Democratic nominee for
Governor.
A delegate from San Franciscoâ San
Franciscans want a little time in which
â¢to put a plaster on the wound which you
rentlemen from the country inflicted, and
I therefore move you, sir, that the con
vention do now take a recess until half
past 8 o'clock this evening. So ordered.

Judge Curtis of San Bernardino â Mr.
Chairman and gentlemen, for the office
" of Attorney General of the State I desire
to place before you the name of George B.
' â¢ Cole of San Bernardino. That office is
' next in importance to that of your Jus
tices of the Supreme Court. It ought to
â¢â¢' be filled by an eminent Iwayer, one who
â  has the courage and the learning' suf
â¢ flcient to meet other able men in the
handling of the important State cases. As
â¢ â¢ you are well aware, he has charge of all
â¢ the criminal cases In the Supreme Court,
and not only this, he is the adviser of the
â State officials upon all legal matters and
â¢" of the various boarda. Mr. Cole is a
lawyer. He has practiced his profession
in the city of San Bernardino for the last

' practice in Southern California. He is
able, he is conscientious, he. is strong, and

â¢ add strength to it wherever he is known
' In the south. I assure you that if he is
placed upon the ticket he will make a
thorough canvass of the State and will
make friends wherever he goes. The
south had hopes to have had Judge Curtis
' of San Diego nominctod as one of the Su
â¢ preme Judges, but he has not received
â¢ that nomination and we ask now your
support for George B. Cole of San Ber
nardino.
Mr. Dopier of Shastaâ Mr. Chairman and
Gentlemen of the Convention: This con
vention has passed resolutions which
. wer.; aimed at and intended to place the
reins of government of this State again
In the hands of the people. The office of

been frequently overlooked. That office
LÂ« the mean* by which the corporations
of this State, those corporations which
are operating in this State, can be con
â¢ trolled: and in the position of Attorney-
General you want a man of tried probity.
You want a man who is fearless in the
. discharge of his duty. You want a man
â¢ who has a record as an anti-monopolist,
. and which record has become established.
â  I come to you from the northern part of
the Plate, which, for some -unaccountable
reason, seems to have been wiped off the
. map, Democratically speaking. We ask
you to nominate a young man to that of
fice, %bose record is a household word in
that county. We are asking you to nom
inate a man who has made his mark at
. the liar. We are asking you to nominate
a man who i<= le.-irnod in the law. We
.. are asking you to nominate a man who
has shown that he is cnnable of handling

â¢ was fearless In the discharge of his duty

. the Hon. H. P. Andrews of Red Bluff.
I have been troing to Democratic enn
â¢-ventlnns for years and years. Personally
I never ask. <1 for anything at the hands
of the party, but I have been willing to
work as one among the rank and file
. Tear after year I have seen the great
'â¢ t-iMithern and tho great central portion of
this State recotrnized in Democratic con
. vemion by nomination after nomination
'.but never since the nomination of William
J.rvin for Governor of this State has that
= portion of California been recognized
; â¢ Notwithstanding that, howevere, we have
-.gone to our homes year after year and
planted the standard of Democracy upon
Jhe highest pinnacle Of old Shasta in
. order that it might be seen emblazoned
.â¢'out to the whole State. And now I ask
â¢ ' you in justice to consider these things.
â¢ There are Democrats there who are de
\ mnnding this nomination. It is Domo
. cratic votes that you want on election
â¢day. and we are asking you now to rec
ognize the First Congressional District
â  by nominating that honorable, straieht
â  forward, tried and trustworthy man. Hon
'H. P. Andrews of Red Bluff. (Applause).
The Chairmanâ Are there any further

FOR A GREATER NAVY.
Mr. "Whiteâ Mr. Chairman: It appears
from a further Investigation of the plat
form, that there has been omitted there
from the following-, and I move its adop
tion: "We appreciate not only the splen
did achievement of our naval heroes, but
also rejoice in the work accomplished by
American labor and skill in the construc
tion of our ships of war and their arma
ments. We are particularly gratified at
the interest j manifested in the Oregon,
Olympia and like vessels in California
I waters and insist that further similar
work Â£ hail be done Jiere. The necessity
of our growing: importTince, the extension
of our foreign trade, and the necessities
of our country and citizens abroad, de
mand such a navy as shall render ag
gression from foreign shores absolutely
futile. It is the duty of Congress to make
corresponding appropriations and to
give us a navy capable of enforcing our
rights wherever questioned." I move the
adoption of this amendment to the reso
lution. Seconded and carried.
Mr White â Mr. Chairman, I am also in-
I formed that the flowing has been
; omitted from the end of the last resolu
j tion referring to the administration of
j our present executive, which I move to
! add: Although the tax levies of the three
â  last years of his administration aggregated
over' $1,300,000, under the pledges of the
i platform upon which he was elected, the
1 rate of taxation for IS9S was the lowest
I in the history of the State, and the rates
! for 1897 and 1898 would have been still
lower had not the assessed valuations of
property in the State been decreased. I
i move the adoption of this addition. Sec
onded and carried. ... . â

Mr Rodgers â Mr. chairman: You can

Mr Smithâ Without any other remarks.
Mr. Rodgersâ Mr. McÃride does not em

the amendment was adopted.
The Chairâ Gentlemen, I want to intro
duce to you Mr. Van Meter of the law
committee, who desires to address you for
a few moments.
Mr. Van Meterâ Mr. Chairman and gen
tlemen of the Democratic convention:
Having been appointed by the Populists
chairman of the Populist committee, and
by the chairman of your convention a
member of the law committee, and hav
ing been made chairman of that commit
tee, and the work having devolved upon
me to prepare the certificates of nomina
tion for the People's party convention
and to see that all the committees were
properly made, and that they properly
certify the nominations, I have been
asked" to call the attention of the mem
bers of this convention to the fact that
it will be necessary for each of the con
ventions which have been held here to
appoint an auditing committee of five;
and it will be necessary for the chair
man and secretary of each Congressional
convention, the convention of the Board
of Equalization and Railroad Commission,
to certify to the nominations macie by
each of those conventions. There are
seven Congressional districts, four Board
of Equalization districts and three Rail
road districts. Each convention must
certify to the nominations and at the
same time the chairman of that conven
tion must appoint an auditing committee
of five.
It is important that you do not neglect
it before leaving this place, so that your
secretary will have the names of the
auditing committee signed and filed with
the Secretary of State. I thank you,
gentlemen. I used to be at home in
Democratic conventions. But at one time
when your people went off with Mr.
Cleveland, I went to the People's party.
It seems a3 though Mr. Cleveland has
been left to go a-flshing while we have
been getting together aKtiin. and under
the banner of Mr. Maguire we will elect
the whole ticket at the coming election.
The Chairmanâ Gentlemen. I desire to
introduce Mr. Thompson, your candidate
for Secretary of State.
Mr Thompsonâ Gentlemen of the con
vention, I am greatly obliged to you for
the honor of the nomination you have
given me this evening, and will do my
best for the ticket from the top to the
bottom. I heartily indorse your plat
form. I will not say any more this even
ing as the hour is very late and I know
everybody Is In n hurry to gpt away. At
this point a motion was made and second
ed that the secretary be instructed to cast
the vote of all those candidates whose
nominations were made unanimous. The
clerk cast the votes as directed. No fur
ther business appearing the convention
adjourned sine die amid three cheers for
the ticket.

ceHSful termination of the war for the ac
complishment of this purpose. We rejoice
in the success that has come to American
arms on land and pea and glory in the
bravery and skill of the aokliera and sailors
of our country. The sublime courage and
fortitude display"?*! by our land and naval
forces in achieving the victories of Manila
and Santiago have shown to the world the
value cf iree institution;-!, universal suf
frage and general public education in de
veloping the highest qualities of character
Intelligence and courage, making our vol
unteer soldiers trained in the schools of
the State militia organizations more than
equal to those who compose the great
standing armies of Kurope.
We favor the fullest investigation of all
conditions existing in the Philippine Inlands
affecting the Interests and obligations of our
country in the matter of their future treat
ment and disposition, to the end that final
action In relation thereto shall be intelli
gent and based upon a full knowledge of all
facts that can affect the interests of the
United States. While we do not favor an
aggressive policy of territorial expansion,
we are opposed to the surrender to Spain
of any of the territory that has been ac
quired by American valor and the expendi
ture of the blood and treasure of our peo
ple. And we do not favor the surrender to
Spanish dominion of the people of any of
the Spanish colonies who co-operated with
our forces against our enemy in the late
war.
We are unalterably opposed to the as
sumption by this Government of any por
tion of the debts of Spain incurred In
maintaining her sovereignty in Cuba and
to the Imposition of any portion thereof
upon the people of that island, or to any
recognition thereof.
One of the results of the war to our own
country has been the obliteration of all
sectional lines and differences among our
people resulting from memories of the civil
war. The people of all parts of our coun
try have united with a common devotion
a common patriotism and a common spirit
of self-sacrifice in support of our flair in
the crisis through which we have passed
and have thus forever banished sectional
animosities and made appeals to section
alism In future political campaigns impos
sible.
We commend the course of the Democratic
minority in Congress In having acted with
unanimity and without partisan division on
all measures for the support of our arms in
the war with Spain, and we commend the
course of the Democratic Senators and Rep
resentatives in Congress in opposing the un
just and discriminating- war revenue meas
ure of the Republican administration, under
which by far the greater portion of the cost
of war is levied upon the laboring- classes
of the country, and by which unnecessary
burdens in the form of bon3s have been im
posed upon the people of the United States.
We heartily, IndgrÃft and commend the
faithful and efficient services of our D?mo
crntic Senator nn.l Representatives In Con
gress from California.
Nicaragua Canal.
We favor the immediate construction of
the Nicaragua ship canal by the L,r.ite<i
States Government, and Its ownership,
operation and permanent control D> me
Government.
Pacific Railroads.
We denounce the measure recently adopted
by the Fifty-fifth Congress providing lor
refunding the debts of the Central i_ acme
Railroad Company to the United States
Government as an unusual and vicious aci
of favoritism to a powerful corporation, the
effect of which will be to extend for a long
period the Southern Pacific Company â  mo
nopoly of railroad transportation in Cali
fornia. We also denounce the propooit.on
to further extend the period of IÂ»7*Â«j* *Â«*
said debts, and pledge our candidates ror
Congress to oppose the same. Vv c aiho
pledge all candidates for the Legislature
not to vote for any candidate for tmtea
States Senator who is not opposed to any
extension of such time upon any terms
whatever. We favor the foreclosure of tne
Government's liens upon the Central Paclllc
and Western Pacific railroads and their sale
for an amount sufficient to pay the entire
claims of the Government, or if a pr.ee
sufficient for that 'purpose cannot De od
tained that the Government hid in said
roads at the foreclosure sales and now mem
as public highways for the benefit ot me
whole people.
State Railroad Commission.
We commend the efforts of the Democrat
ic majority of the present State Railroad
Commission to bring about a rair ana
reasonable reduction of freight and are
charges for railroad transportation witnin
the State of California, and we deprecate
the unreasonable postponement of those ad
vantages to the people of California by
dilatory proceedings instituted in tne
Federal and State courts by the Southern
Pacific Company in evasion of its obliga
tions to the State and in defiance of the
conditions upon which it holds its public
franchises. We condemn the action oi tne
last Republican Legislature in refusing to
appropriate the money necessary to enable
the State Railroad Commission to properly
defend its rights and powers in the btate
and Federal courts, and to properly in
vestigate the business methods, earnings
and expenses of the railroads subject to its
Jurisdiction. Â
We reiterate the position repeatedly as
serted by the Democratic party of Cali
fornia that in the limitation of freight and
fare charges by the State Railroad Com
mission no allowance should be made for
interest upon any fictitious capitalization
of railroad companlps; that reasonable in
terest should be allowed upon the actual
investment in the construction of the rail
road Including stations and terminals, and
upon the actual value of rolling stock and
other property used in connection with rail
road transportation, and no allowance
should be made as or for Interest upon the
value of any privilege given by the people
to such companies, and no allowance of in
terest upon any bonded indebtedness beyond
the actual value of the railroad measured
by the cost of reproducing it at any given
time at which rates are to be fixed.
In determining the allowance to be made
for operating expenses of railroads the
commission should provide liberally for the
waees of men employed thereon, and all
railroad companies should be compelled to
pay wages in accordance with such allow
ance.
Rivers and Harbors.
The preservation of the navigable rivers
and harbors of California is of the greatest
importance to the commerce and develop
ment of the State, and we therefore urges
upon our delegation In Congress the im
portance of securing liberal appropri.it i ms
for the maintenance of the navigability and
Improvement of the same.
Fully realizing the great importance of
early completion of the work undertaken
upon the Sacramento and San Joaquln
rivers, and the possibility of placing the
Improvement of these water waj> under the
contract system at an early day, we pleige
our representatives in Congress to exercise
their utmost endeavors to accomplish this
purpose and declare that the completion of
thin improvement should be expedited by
both State and nation.
San Pedro Harbor.
We denounce the persistent and long-con
tinued efforts of the present Secretary of
War to prevent the Improvement of the
public harbor of San Pedro, and his per
sistent efforts to divert the sums of money
appropriated by Congress for that purpose
to the improvement of the private harbor
of the Southern Pacific Company at Santa
Monica. California, and the Democratic
Congressmen from California are hereby
plpdppd to use every effort to prevent such
diversion of any portion of the $2.9W.000 ap
propriated for the construction of the har
bor at San Pedro to any other purpose than
the construction of the hrvakwater and the
deepening of the Inner harbor at that point.
Mining.
We congratulate the Democratic party
and the people of the State of California
on the fact that by the legislation initiated
by the Democratic party under the plat
forms of ci nventlons held respectively In
IS9O and ISO 2 the mining industry in all
its branches has received an Impetus which
to-day gives it a Reading position in the
developnif-nt and progress of the State.
We favor the continuation of the work
bo auspiciously Initiated by the National
and State Governments on the lines laid
down In the law to the end that aIK inter
ests involved be fully and adequately pro
tected, and each be given the recognition
demanded by the Important bearing each
has up"n the general welfare.
Inasmuch sis the legal Impediment to the
Immediate expenditure of the 1500,000 appro
priated. $2. r ,0.000 thereof by Congress and
f]SB,OOO therefore by the State of California,
for the construction of debris dams, was
removed by the present Congress, and the
whole of Bald sum is now available for that
purpose, we demand the immediate construc
tion of such restraining dams.
We condemn the rapacity of the Central
Pacific and other railroad companies In tiro
curing the issuance to themselves of pat
ents for large tracts of mineral lands not
withstanding the original grant under which
said patents are Issued especially exempts
from its operation all mineral lands, and
we demand that all such patents covered
thereby be restored to the public domain,
and thrown open to exploration and entry,
and in this behalf we favor an early enact
ment of the California mineral lands Mils
now pending before Congress and indorsed
by the California Miners' Association af
fecting both such patented and unpatented
lands.
We believe In fostering the mining In
dustry In all its branches, and favor the
rehabilitation of hvdraulie mining whore
ever It may be carried on, without material
injury to other vested interests.
Election of United States Sen
ators.
We demand the election of United .States
Senators by direct vote of the people of
the States, and we pledge our Senators and
Representatives in Congress to vote for the
submission of such an amendment to the
Federal constitution.
Government by Injunction.
We are In favor of a strict ad
herence to the rule that the legis
lative, judicial and executive departments
of our Federal Government and of our State
Government shall be kept separate, and
that neither shall encroach upon the powera
or functions of the other; and we particu
larly oppose and condemn the growing
practice of the judicial department of the
Fedora I Government In supplementing or
modifying the laws of the land by injunc
tions and other writs and processes not
basei upon constitutional or statutory law
enacted by the people or by the legislative
department of the Federal or the State
Government. â¢
Labor Legislation.
We favor the adoption by the Legislature
of this State of laws for the protection of
labor, nnd we pledge our candidates to
support the measures recommended by La
bor Commissioner Fitzgerald, or such legis
lation as will accomplish the purpose
Bought to be attained by said proposed
measures.
We favor the immediate extension of the
contract labor laws of the United Stntes
to the Hawaiian Islands, and all further
territory that may hereafter be annexed to
the United States.
We aro opposed to the employment of
convict labor in competition with free la
bor, and ni' favor the passage of a law
by the CongreFS of the United States con
fining the sale of goods, wares and mer
chandise manufactured by convict labor to
the State or Territory in which they aro
produced.
Good Roads.
We favor the efforts now being made by
public-spirited citizens throughout the
State of California for the improvement of
our public roads and highways upon mod
era, economical and substantial lines, and
we favor the encouragement of all such
efforts by the co-operation of the State and
county governments with the California
Good Road*! I^eacue and other organiza
tions intelligently and systematically pro
moting these purposes.
Primary Election Law.
We favor the enactment of a general pri
mary election law, fair and just to all par
ties and sections, providing for the election
by the Australian ballot, under State con
trol and at public expense, of delegates to
all party conventions called for the pur
pose of nominating candidates for public
office.
Food Adulteration.
We favor the enactment of such laws as
may be required to effectually stamp out
the vicious and dishonest traffic In adul
terated foods which menaces the health,
lives and prosperity of the people of Cali
fornia.
State School Text Books.
We are in favor of the continuance and
Improvement of the State text-book system
for our public schools.
San Fpancisco Charter.
We favor the ratification by the Leirls
lature of the charter recently adopted In
the city and county of San Francisco, ana
pledge thÂ« Democratic members of tne
Senate and Assembly to vote for the same.
Taxation and Local Government.
We favor a constitutional amendment
abolishing the State poll tax and giving to
counties and municipal corporations the
right to adopt and change their systems
of taxation for local purposes whenever a
majority of the people of any sucn county
or municipality shall so determine.
We favor the adoption of constitutional
amendment No. 10, now pending. Iâ¢?*
the right of local self-government to the
counties of the State. >Â»_i.io
We approve the principle of direct legisla
tion and favor its immediate adoption for
municipal and other local purposes.
Governor James H. Budd.
We indorse the administration of GoVernor
James H. Budd, and especially point to the
fuct that he has Inaugurated substantial
economies and has introduced system and
business methods into the management of
State institutions. Under his administra
tion taxation has been reduced When he
assumed office he found a State debt of
one and three-quarter millions of dollars
and will leave to his successor a surplus
of two millions.
California University.
We point with pride to the position of
the University of California in the educa
tional world and commend the progressive
policy which haÂ» characterized its admin
istration within the past few years, and
the Democratic party, as the friend of pop
ular education, pledges Itself to the liberal
support of the plans that promise H a
glowing future.
River Improvements.
Whereas, This is the first time !n the
history of our State, notwithstanding vast
sums have heretofore been expended In
making surveys for plans of improvements
and reports thereon, that anything practical
for the improvement of navigation has been
inaugurated by the State by the approval
of the United States Hoard of River Engi
neers and sanction of the Secretary of war;
therefore^ be it
Resolved, That we commend the commis
sion of public works and the auditing board
fer having secured concert of action be
tween Governmental and State authorities
In executing the long needed and practical
works now under the process of construc
tion on both the Sacramento and San Joa
quin rivers.
Organized Labor.
Resolved, That this convention give Its
indorsement for the case of organized labor
and recommends the general use of the la
bel of the Allied Printing Trades' Council
and other union labels.
The Navy Lauded.
The following additional plank ha 3 been
placed in the platform by vote of the con
vention on motion of Senator White:
We appreciate not only the splendid
achievements of our naval heroes, but re
joice also in the magnificent work accom
plished by American labor and skill In the
construction of our ships of war and their
armament. We are particularly gratified at
the perfection manifested in the Oregon,
Olympia and other like vessels bnilt in
California waters, and Insist that further
similar work shall be done here. The
necessities of our growing Importance, the
extension of our foreign trade and the In
terests of our country and citizens abroad
demand such a navy as shall render ag
gression from foreign chores absolutely fu
tile. It Is the duty of Congress to make
corresponding appropriations and to give
us a navy capable of enforcing our rights
wherever questioned.

A Miner Drugged.
John Harrison, a miner from Placer
County, Is the latest victim of the deadly
"knock-out" drops. He met a woman on
Barbary Coast who with deft fingers
doctored his drinkÃ and relieved him of
$40 and a gold watch. Officer Robert Sol
ver found Harrison lying on the side
walk at the corner of Sacramento and
Sansome street early yesterday morning
and locked him up up for drunk. When
the miner came to his senses he reported
to the police that he had been robbed.

BRAUNHART
TOOK WATER
Sammy Was Forced to
Swallow His Rash
Remarks.
Dwyer Gave Him the Lie and
Fanned His Nose With
His Fist.
CALLi HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 18.â Senator Sammy
Braunhart has been called down a sec
ond time since his advent in the capital.
J. J. Dwyer contributed to his humilia
tion. The little incident occurred during
the meeting of the special committee on
San Francisco organization appointed by
Beth Mann, chairman of the platform
and resolution committee, in the parlor of
the Golden Eagle Hotel, last evening.
Braunhart, In the heat of his arrument
in favor of the Committee of One Hun
dred conducting the primaries, told of
the means taken by bosses and their fol
lowers at such elections, and incidentally
admitted that the "end justified the
means," and he would do likewise if hid
party needed it. He stated that no other
than Mr. Dwyer had, in his office a year
ago, made that statement to him. â¢
Dwyer jumped from his seat as If he
were shot from a catapult, and his face
livid with rage and with his right fist un
comfortably near the nose of the rash
speaker, yelled: "You are a blankety
blank, blank liar, if you say I ever made
that remark."
Braunhart paled visibly and retreated
out of reach of the indignant attorney's
fist. â¢ Not a member seated In the room
stirred from his chair and not one word
was uttered to prevent a brawl, every
body present well knowing that Braun
hart would tamely submit to the "call
down."
"And I repeat," said the angry Dwyer,
"that if you impute the authorship of
that infamous lie to me, I'll ram the
words down your lying throat."
With a meekness that disgusted those
seated in the room, Braunhart swallowed
the rebuke and continued in his defense
of the primary system. He had hardly
uttered another sentence when he was
again interrupted by the irate Dwyer.
Braunhart was dwelling on the virtues of
the committee of One Hundred and men
tioned the name of "Whispering" Gavin
McNab as a gentleman whom he ae
llghted to honor. __
"Mr. Braunhart," laid Mr.- Dwyer,
shaking his finger at him. "Didn't you
come into my office a month ago and say
that Mr. McNab was the blank blankest
liar in the country?"
As Braunhart did not deny the charge
Dwyer vented his feeling against the
'"Whispering" boss by adding, "For once
in your life you told the truth. I knew
you did because I rammed those very
words down McNab's throat."
Braunhart then appealed to me speaker
for protection from the interruptions or
his Nemesis, but got little sympathy
from that person, as he wa3 cautioned
riot to deal in personalities but address
his remarks to the question.
Again he strove to enlighten the com
mittee on the underhand practices of the
bosses to obtain possession of the primar
ies, and again he was interrupted by
Dwyer. This time he was dwelling on
the probability of the various bosses in
the different Assembly districts carrying
the primaries. He went so far as to give
the names of those who would do the
job, but before he had enumerated them
all Dwyer landed a solar plexus punch by
accusing him of Inflicting the greatest
stigma on the local Democracy by being
the author of the "Isinglass Ticket" used
In a primary election.
Braunhart's only answer to the repeat
ed attacks made by Dwyer was, "I par
don you, I pardon you for your inter
ruptions and unkind remarks. I know
that you don't mean them."
Dwyer retorted he meant everything he
said and was willing to back it up. The
Senator from south 'of Market street was
loth to take up the cudgels in his own
defense, but tried to win the confidence
of the members of the committee by
grandiloquently saying: "Sam Braunhart
says these things on nls word of hon.jfc
Sam Braunhart, Senator from San Fran
cisco, whose knowledge of these things is
great, makes these assertions on his word
of honor."
The "honor" of the speaker seemed to
strike the committee as being a thing to
be questioned, as many tried hard to sup
press a smile. Not so with Dwyer; a
parting crack at the man who tried to be
smirch his good name for decency In pol
itics presented itself right there, and ho
sarcastically announced that he would
not give ten cents for his honor.
I'nfeazed by these remarks, Braunhart
continued his speech until the faces of his
listeners warned him that he was getting
tiresome.
Stole False Teeth.
Henry Graham, alias McCarthy, alias
Shorty Levres, was arrested last evening
for petty larceny. Albert Cohn. a barber
at 22 Montgomery avenue, the complain
ing witness, claims that Graham took
from his shop articles valued at $25.
Among the things missing are a set of
false teeth and an overcoat. The man is
known to the police.
Young People in Session.
The semi-annual convention of the
Toung People's Association of the Pres
bytery of San Francisco was held In
Westminster Church at Page and Gough
Btreets last evening, and the work and
progress of the society during the past
six months was reviewed. Reports of va
rious committees were forwarded and
considered and the work for the coming
half year outlined.

ALL PHILIPPINE
ISLANDS INCLUDED
IN THE CAPTURE
Sweeping Terms of the Capitula
tion to Merritt and
Dewey.
Entire Archipelago Said to Have Passed Into tr;e
Possession of tr;e An)ericar)
forces.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 18.â An important point on which the officials
are without definite information is to the extent of our present author
ity in the Philippines. Under the peace protocol the United States was
given the occupation of Manila, with the bay and harbor, until a perma
nent disposition of the Philippine question was reached. But according
to press dispatches which are so circumstantial as to be credited in most
official quarters General Merritt and Admiral Dewey received the capit
ulation of the entire Philippine archipelago.
There appears to be some doubt, therefore, even among officials, as to
whether our present authority and jurisdiction cover Manila only, as
providea by the peace protocol, or cover all the Philipines, as provided
by the reported terms of the capitulation to Merritt and Dewey.
There is a disposition to await fuller official information before lay
ing down a policy as to the extent of our jurisdiction in the islands.
Secretary Alger said to-day that he had heard nothing of the surren
der of the entire Philippine group. At the same time the Secretary did
not discredit the accuracy of the press advices stating that the capitula
tion had this far-reaching effect. Pending more definite information,
the attitude of the officials is to asssume that our authority covers Ma
nila city, Manila bay and harbor and also such other territory as may be
occupied by the military and navn.l forces.
The latter phrase is elastic enough to cover any or all of the Philip
pine Islands that may have been brought under our authority by the re
cent surrender. The instructions sent to General Merritt have in view
the expansion of our possessions beyond the terms mentioned in the pro
tocol, as they distinctly state that this Government is in possession of
Manila and that its authority to preserve peace and order will be ex
erted "within the territory occupied by the military and naval forces."

NAVAL ADVISER.
It Is Probable That When Congress
Meets the Grade of Admiral
Will Be Revived
for Him.
"~ Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 18.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
There la still uncertainty as to the
composition of the peace commission.
The President has not succeeded in
adding any names to his list to-day
and It stands as yesterday, with but
Secretary Day and Senator Davis upon
Jt. Rear Admiral Dcwoy has been sug
gested as a member of the commission.
I was informed to-day that it was not
probable he would be appointed,
though it was quite probable he would
be ordered to Paris as naval adviser to
the American commissioners.
It is probable that when Congress
meets Rear Admiral Dewey will be
honored by having the gTade of ad
miral revived for him, and that he will
be appointed to the grade by the Pres
ident in recognition of his unparalle'ed
.services during the war with Spain.
MADRID. Aug. 18.â The nomination
of Senator Davis on the peace com
mission would not be well received
here, owing to his strong and openly
expressed anti-Spanish sentiments. As
anticipated in my dispatches, Senor
Gamazo's project that the Cortes
Bhould meet almost immediately has
carried the day.
GENERAL MERRITT TO
ISSULi A PROCLAMATION
Scheme of Government for Manila

Country.

patch to the World from Manila, dated
August 14, via Hongkong, to-day, says:
General Merritt has prepared a procla
mation to the natives which provides a
scheme of government for Manila and
surrounding territory and the other island
places in our possession, the chief points
of which are as follows:
Rigid protection to all In personal re
ligion. , ,
Municipal laws, tribunals and legal In
stitutions for punishment of crime to re
main until further notice (except where
incompatible with military rule), subject
to the super%-lsion of the American gen
eral.
Provost marshal nnd sub-provosts to be
appointed with power to arrest citizens as
well as military officers.
Open trade for neutral nations.
Public property to be rigorously pro
tected.
No interference with the people so long
as they preserve peace.
General Merritt now occupies the cap
tain general's palace, having established
his official headquarters there.
CAPITULATION WAS
EFFECTED SECRETLY
Spanish Killed in the Land and Sea
Attack on Manila Number
Sixty.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
HONGKONG, Aug. 18.â Advices from
The Call-Herald correspondent In Ma
nila state that the Spanish officials
kept secret the proposed capitulation
of Manila so well that the inhabitants
of Manila were hourly expecting the
Americans to shell the city, and were
greatly surprised when the troops
marched in.
It was the Seventy-ttflrd Native Reg
iment that fired on the American troops
resting at the luneta.
Captain General Augusti's dismissal
is considered another deception of the
corrupt Ministry to shift the respon
sibility to the shoulders of a general
who had done his utmost to remedy
the effect of the glaring dishonesty of
his predecessors and their accomplices,
the Ministers of Spain.
The entire Spanish colony In Ma
nila disapproved of General Augustl's
dismissal. General Jaudemes was un
willing to supersede him and yielded
only under strong pressure.
It Is believed by The Call-Herald
Manila correspondent that the Philip
pines will readily accept American gov
ernment.
A proclamation printed In the Gov
ernment gazette, and also posted on the
street corners, prohibits any one In
Manila from leaving the walled city.
The Spaniards hoped till the last for
foreign intervention.
It Is now estlbated that only sixty
Spaniards were killed.

Special Cable to The Cnll nnd the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1898,
by James Gordon Bennett.
PAX JUAN DE PORTO RICO, Aug. IS.â At Ciales some of the
natives arcs..' in revolt against the Local authorities, but Spanish sol
diers and poMce promptly put down the rising, killing thirty-eight,
'.â wounding many and taking two prisoners.
Disturbances <'n the part of the country people are becoming so
. frequent and so serious against property and lives that the Captain
, General has telegraphed to General Miles on the subject, explaining
that many natives calling themselves auxiliaries of the Americans are
committing depredations. The Captain General will In every case se
verely punish such rioters and he hopes General Miles will do his
utmost to preserve order.
PONCE. Porto Rico, via St. Thomas, T). W. 1.. Aug. 18.â A mob of
disorderly natives thronged the streets last night and assailed the
Stores of pro-Spanish residents with stones, doing considerable dam
age. Several shots were fired and there was great excitement, but
no one was injured. The disturbance was quelled by provost guards.
All is quiet along the front at all points. Reports of Spanish out
rages in the northern part of the island are unconfirmed.
There was a serious riot at Yauco last night. Some Porto Ricans
assembled about the jail and attempted to lynch some Spanish volun
teers confined there. Their attempt was foiled and some of the Porto
Ricans were arrested.
Near a body of Spanish troops is reported to have at
tacked a small village and hacked citizens with machetes. These re
ports are usually exaggerated, but generally have some foundation.

X I have used Ripang Tabules and they have done me lots of
good, at least my wife says they have," asserts William Donaldson,
a blacksmith. "After a hard day's work I would eat too much, I
guess," continued he, "and suffer like everything. My wife's brother
told me that Ripans Tabules had helped him and he thought they
would help me. I believe they have cured me, but I still take them
regular, for I would not have them pains again for anything. My
partner said, after I was so much better, that I was ready to get well
anyhow, and that I would have got well without them. I believe
there are lots of people that are ready to get well just like I was.
They will get well when they take the same medicine I did, and not
before. 1 have worked hard all my life, first on a farm and then in a
blacksmith shop, and have been troubled with dyspepsia ever since I
was 1 8 years old. Now I feel like I was sweet sixteen. I think
Jfcipajis Tabules are a great mÂ«dicyaSsl'

dend put them to rout. Tbe subsequent up
ward surge of the market served to make it
all the more vulnerable to bear attack, and
they opened their guns this morning with an
onslaught on Brooklyn Rapid Transit. People' 3
Gas and Tobacco. Although this assault came
with very heavy realizing offers in the grangers
and Pacifies and some favorites, the outside
demand foe stocks was so enormous as to take
the market away from the professionals and
lift prices upward. But there came a time later
in the day when the outside demand was for
the first time satisfied, and when the recent
purchasers of stocks were still anxious to take
the handsome profits accrued upon them. The
.bears kept nibbling at the list and made an
aggressive attack In the last hour which car
ried prices, down sufficiently to wipe nut weak
margins and bring out stop lofs orders. The
group of low-priced railroad Mock? and in
dustrial specialties into which the tide of
speculation shifted this morning had not suffi
cient strength to hold the market in face of
liquidation, although they hMd stubbornly
through the most of It. Some of them finally
succumbed with the rest of the list, which fell
generally below last night's level. The bull
Clique apparently offered no resistance to the
derllne, but support was forthcoming before
It had proceeded to any great length. The
activity of the market greatly decreased and
the volume of business was materially smaller
than yesterday.
There was a good market for railroad bonds
to-day and a slightly yielding tendency to
prices in the late dealings. Total sales, $3,550,

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Aug. 18.â Wet weather In the
northwestern spring wheat territory, together
with higher cables from Liverpool, were re
sponsible to some extent for the firmness
which characterised the commencement of the
trading In wheat. An Increase In the arrivals
up north and a prediction by the weather
bureau of fair weather to-night and Friday In
the spring wheat country changed the tem
perament of the speculative crowd. When
weakness set in it was more prominently ap
parent In December, the disposition among
traders being to stay out of September in
view of the small stocks here and elsewhere.
The hope of higher prices Indulged in by the
bulls in the market have of late been largely
based on the expectation that the bears would
oversell themselves for September. The bean
also appeared to have some apprehension on
that score and transferred their ventures to
December, thus giving a nervous character to
the trading in September and reducing De
cember to an altogether unusual discount un
der such conditions as exist at present. The
close was IHc higher for September and hiÂ®
%c higher for December.
Corn opened weak and became very heavy
during the forenoon on liquidations b' - iongi
and heavy commission house dealings on stop
loss orders. Reports from the country, how
ever, about the probable yield of the crop
were far from corroborative of the Govern
ment figures on condition. September left off
unchanged to %c higher.
Oats followed corn, weak early but recov
ered later. The close was unchanged from yes
terday.
Provisions ruled dull most of the time, but
had a few redeeming intervals of moderate ac
tivity. The feature of the day's business was
liquidation by packers of products previously
bought and the ready absorption of offerings
with reduction In prices. Pork advanced sc,
lard declined 6c and ribs remained unchanged.

WAS HEAVILY
IN DEBT
Played the Races and,
as Usual, Lost.
WANTED TO BE A PLUNGER
MOTIVE FOR THE POPULAR
OFFICER'S SUICIDE.
.Went to His Home in an Intoxicated
Condition and Blew Out His
Brains With a Re
volver.
Being heavily in d-i>t and hnvlng lit
tle prospect ot settling with his cred
itors were the motives which prompted
Police Officer Tom Langford to commit
suicide.
Langford, during the racing meet in
this city, endeavored to add to his ex
chequer by playing "long shuts." He
proved a dismal failure as a plunger
and soon found himself heavily in debt.
Unable to meet the demands at his
. creditors he became despondent and
. determined to end it all.
Last Wednesday, the day on which
he blew out his brains, he met several
friends and told them of his troubles.
He had been drinking heavily, notwith
standing that he was on duty at the
time. After reporting off at thÂ»
fornia-street Station Langford went to
his hcrme on Octaviu street, and. con
trary to his usual custom, he did not
epd^k to his wife. The latter, realizing
. he had been drinking, refrained from
' addressing him and re-entered the
kitchen to prepare the evening meal.
Langford seated himself in the dining
.room and divested himself of his coat.
A few minutes later a shot rang out,
and Mrs. Langford, thinking that some
thing serious had happened, ran into
the room to find her husband in a dying
â â -.condition from the effects of a bullet
hole in the head.
. â¢ Chief Lees ridicules the story that
La-ngt'ord feared being taken before the
Police Commissioners for having "ar
rested Peter Cunningham, an old miser,
whom he had charged with vagrancy.
Cunningham has a large bank account,
,'â ". but for years he has passed as a -pau
per.
Cunningham, after being released,
threatened to prefer charges against
: .Langfbrd with the Police Commission
ers. Langford told his wife of Cun
. ningham's threat and seemed to re
â¢ â  gard it as a huge joke.
' Some time afterward word reached
: â¢ Commissioner Gunst that Langford
â aftd several of his fellow officers were
' in the habit of visiting a saloon at
...SJush and Montgomery streets and
\'. nightly enjoying a repast. flunst not
.'. â¢ lfied Captain "Wittman, and they de
: â¢. cided to visit the place at an oppor- j
tune time. Langford was informed of
.the intended visit, and he kept away
â  from the saloon. His companions,
however, were caught, and after being
trted for the offense, were fined 5100
â â  each. Notwithstanding that Langford i
was not present when the famous
raid was made, Wittman decided to
: prefer, charges against him. He was
.acquitted by the Commissioners after
ft 'trial, but warned to keep out of sa
. loons while on duty. His friends, who
Were aware of his financial troubles,
expected that he would do something
desperate.
THE PARK'S ELK SHOT.
A ; Fiend Ends the Life of the Noble
Animal With a Pistol Shot.
â¢ ' " . The big elk that for several years has
been the pride of the keeper of the deer
paddock at Golden Gate Park is dead.
â¢ The noble anima.l was shot by some per
â  pori that the park officials would give a
' ". good deal to know. The elk was a splen
â¢ '!did specimen of Its species, and it was
â¢ â¢â always much admired by visitors to the
.big . recreation ground. The shot that
â  kiiied the animal was not heard by any
of the park attendants. The dead animal
wae found soon after daybreak yesterday
:â¢ &rid its body was then quit<- warm, show
â  ing that the deed was done by thr- fiend
' early in the morning. The bullet that
â¢ ended its life pierced its heart, showing
that the act of the miscreant was a de
liberate one.
Several years ago a male and female
elk were purchased by the Park Commis
sioners, and the two animals soon became
â¢â¢ the pets of the park visitors. About two
years ago the female elk died and for
months the male was melancholy over the
loss of his companion.

The Proposed Convalescent Hospital of the Red Cross
Society at the Presidio.
The new Red Cross hospital for convalescents at the Presidio will be lo
cated just north of the new barracks on the driveway to Fort Point, In a
situation commanding a superb view of the bay and sheltered from the
west winds by the lofty bluff In the rear. The plans were only deter
mined upon yesterday, but It Is expected that in ten days the building
will be ready for patients. The hospital will be 104x34 feet in dimen
sions and be one story in height. The front will be occupied by physi
cians' rooms, kitchen, bath and nurses' rooms, dining room, with heaters
and other conveniences. The rear extension will be occupied by the officers
and rooms for nurses and a ward for fever patients. The center build
ing will be for the hospital proper and will contain beds for twenty pa
tients. Entrance from front, rear and Bides will be provided. The hos
pital will be constructed of wood in rustic style.
Inside the trimmings will be of Oregon pine. The wards will be heated
from colls containing hot water circulating around the walls of the struc
ture. Additional warmth will be provided by brick fireplaces of large
size. A sewer will conduct the waste water to the bay. The arrange
ments for ventilation are most cqpnplete. Though built In short order
nothing will be lacking to make the* hospital absolutely perfect in its ap
point ments.
The designer contemplates an Ultimate extension of the present build
ing double the size of this one, to be erected as soon as the emergency
requires it. The funds for the hospital are furnished by the Ladles'
Red Cross Society. Mrs. Major Long and Mrs. Farrington were the com
mittee appointed to supervise the erection. Messrs. Newsom & Myers are
the architects.
JORDAN PAYS
NO REWARDS
No Blank Certificates
Are Produced.
POSITIVE DENIALS ARE MADE
THE COUNTY CLEBK SAYS IT
IS MEAN POLITICS.
Deputy Dean Declares That .His
Name on Fraudulent Cer
tificates Is Bank
Forgery.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway^ Aug. 18.
Tt is being positively asserted to-day
and as positively denied that blank cer
tificates of registration signed by Depu
ty County Clerk Dean and bearing the
seal of the County Clerk's office were
placed in various saloons yesterday and
were used in the interests of Victor Met
calf. This claim, of course, is being made
by the friends of Mr. Hilborn, prominent
among whom are A. M. Benham and
Dr. Derrick.
This afternoon one of these blank cer
tificates bearing the seal of the County
Clerk was brought to the Clerk's office,
but It bore no signature. Yesterday Clerk
Jordan and Mr. Metcalfs managers of
fered a reward of $50 for each of these
blank certificates that could be pro
duced, but so far not one has been found
with a signature to it. It is said that A.
M. Benham had one in his possesion sign
ed by Deputy Clerk Dean, and Attorney
Ben Woolner stated in the County Clerk's
office this afternoon that he had been in
formed by Dr. Selfridge that thirty of
these blank certificates were In the pos
session of parties who would produce
them at the right time.
Mr. Jordan lined up his clerks this af
ternoon and satisfied himself that no such
underhanded work had been done. He
accounted for the certificate with the seal
upon it, but with no signature, by say
ing that the seal of his office is on a ta
ble where it is not Impossible for any
one desiring to put up a job to stamp a
few blank certificates. Incidentally Mr.
Jordan suggested that Will Hawkett
might know something about the stamp
ing of such certificates.
"This scheme is a most discreditable ef
fort on the part of men who cannot fight
fairly," said Clerk Jordan. "I am posi
tive that nothing was done to aid either
man in yesterday's fight so far as the
machinery of the County Clerk's office
is concerned. No doubt as citizens we
all had strong personal preferences, but
I defy any man to produce a blank cer
tificate with the genuine signature of
one of my deputies upon it."
As Mr. Jordan is a candidate to suc
ceed himself, his friends declare that
this charge is being made to Injure him
in his own ward. Mr. Jordan comes from
the Seventh Ward, where Mr. Hilborn
also lives and is particularly strong. Yes
terday Mr. Hilborn only lost the ward by
forty-seven votes, and should his friends
be induced to oppose Mr. Jordan through
the circulation of the story that Jordan
had used his office as he had used his per
sonal influence to aid Mr. Metcalf, the
consequences in the county campaign
would be very manifest.
Deputy Clerk Dean made a positive de
nial that he signed a single certificate
that was blank, and he unequivocally de
clares that any such signature Is a for
gery.
Along "politicians' row" this subject
has aroused the greatest Interest and
bitterness, and Its adjustment must now
undoubtedly cut some figure In the fight
for the County Clerk's nomination.

A MISSING WOMAN.
I ___ .
Writes a Letter From the Cliff House
Saying 1 That She Intended to
Drown Herself.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 18.â Mrs. Nellie M.
Holden of 2304 Buena Vista avenue is
missing, and is believed to have com
mitted suicide in San Francisco, If a note
In her own handwriting means anything.
This morning Attorney Ri B. Tappan,
â¢who had transacted business for the lady,
received a letter bearing the San Fran
cisco postmark and written on Cliff House
paper, in which she Bald that long be
fore he received the missive she would
be dead.
Among other things she said that she
had loaned money to people who had not
paid her; that ahe was worried more than
she could stand, and that "her brain was
reeling."
She inclosed some papers for Mr. Tap
pan, gave him some instructions about
business matters, and concluded by say
ing that the ocean was the best place for
her, and she had decided to leave the
world in that way.
Mr. Tappan at once notified the rela
tives of Mrs. Holden, and a search was
instituted. The Cliff House was visited,
and it was found that the stationery of
that place was readily obtainable by any
one who cared to use it. Inquiry snowed
that some of the attendants had noticed
a lady who might have been the missing
one, and that their attention had been
drawn to her several times of late be
cauÃe of her strange actions. However,
their description was somewhat vague
and was not sufficiently clear to make It
certain that it was Mrs. Holden.
The missing woman was employed as
bookkeeper and cashier in the real es
tate office of T. A. Smith, to whom she
was related by marriage. She left last
week â Thursday, August 11 â ostensibly
for a vacation trip to Sonoma County,
and the letter received by Mr. Tappan
was the first intimation that she had not
gone there. Absolutely nothing could be
learned that would throw any light upon
the cause of her conduct.
Mrs. Holden was about 45 or 50 years
of age, medium sized, dark complex
loned, with black hair mingled with gray.
She wore curls on the side of .her fore
head.
The missing woman was the widow of
ex-Governor William Holden of this
State. She had always been of a cheerful
disposition until within a few weeks,
when she had appeared to be suffering
from depression from overwork.
THE IBISH FAIR.
All Is Ready for the Grand Opening
on Saturday Night.
With a ringing of bells and a tooting
of horns the Irish Fair will be inaugu
rated on Saturday night. Everything
will be in readiness for the large crowds
which will surely gather to open one of
the most picturesque fairs ever held in
this city. The official beginning of the
fair will be the grand parade which will
be headed by Mrs. F. E. DunnÂ© as Miss
Erin, escorted by 8. S. Flynn In the habil
iments of Uncle Sam. -n-s attendant to
Miss Erin will be Daniel C. D. McCarthy,
carrying the Irish flag. Abreast of him
will be Benjamin McKinley, tae Presi
dent's nephew, with the American flag.
Every feature of the fair will be a nov
elty and at the same time relative to some
event or historic scene of Ireland. The
music, the addresses, the costums and all
that tends to relieve the monotony of a
stereotyped exposition will be of a bright
and attractive nature.

HINTS OF GOLD
IN KOTZEBUE
Encouraging News From
Treasure Hunters.
THE LANE PARTY IN LUCK
STRUCK PAY DIRT AT THE
RIVER'S MOUTH.
Accidental Killing of Rn Indian
Leads to the Murder of One
of the Prospecting
Expedition,
The bark Alaska that started for
Kotzebue Sound with 130 gold hunters
is all right, rumors to the contrary
notwithstanding. Private letters re
ceived here yesterday state that she
was at St. Lawrence Island on July 16,
and that it would take at least six
weeks to put her river steamer to
gether.
The stories that the gold fields are a
fizzle are also contradicted. Frank L.
Noonan, who went to Kotzebue on the
barkentine Jane L. Falkenberg, writea
as follows:
Arrived June 26 and at onca launched
the boats. Lane (C. D. Lane, one of the
owners of the Utlca mine and a passenger
on the Falkenberg> says the black sand
in the river is encouraging and is a good
indication of gold. A man named Black
who has had some miners grubstaked up
the Kowak. was taken away by them in
a hurry yesterday. 1 suppose they have
something good. The natives who speak
English say there is lots of gold.
July 19.â The barkentine Catherine
Sudden and Leslie D., barks Northern
Light and Mermaid and schooner Luiea
D. and several others are here and all
kinds of boats are running on the Sound.
A white man accidentally Killed an Indian
and it is now said that the Indiana have
killed a white man to get even. Lane's
party are getting 20 cents to the pan on
top of the ground at the mouth of the
river.
July 24.â An immense bush fire has
been burning around here for weeks. We
can see the tmoke and flames for miles.
The revenue cutter Bear called here on
her way north and gave us some mall.
Captain Wicks of the bark Mermaid has
come aboard the Falkenberg. I believe
they are short of grub on the Mermaid.
In a letter from Francis Tagliabue,
Deputy United States Surveyor, the
| following occurs: "The news here is
: quite encouraging. Several discover
: ies are reported on the Nootak and
I Kowak rivers."
When the steamer Grace Dollar left
Kotzebue Sound none of the river boats
had started, but the Falkenbergr's was
to leave the next day. No prospecting
could have been done, so it Is hard to
say where the news of the complete
failure of the new fields came from.
A big fleet of vessels got in port
Tuesday night and yesterday morning.
The British ship Waterloo made a
smart passage of 56 days from New
castle, N. S. W., while the Earl of
I Dalhousie was 76 days coming from the
; same place. Tha Waterloo was only 30
days getting to the latitude of Hawaii,
and the captain expected to make a
record-breaking run. The brig Galilee
was 36 days from Tahiti, the bark Al
bert 25 days from Hilo and the Roder
ick Dhu 26 days from the same place.
Both vessels left together. As the Al
bert ranks as a clipper, it will be Been
that the Roderick Dhu Is not slow. The
Ottlllie Fjord was 33 days from Kahu
lui and the schooner Aloha 28, and the
ship Marie Hackfeld 27 days from Hon
olulu.
The British ship FaJls of Halladale
and the Italian bark Macdiarnied left
Hull together on May 22. They are now
out eighty-eight days for this port and
| when last seen were making a very
close race.
Three schooners with gold hunters
are still scheduled to arrive from the
East. Of these the Mildred E., now
out 161 days from Boston, is the only
one likely to get here. The Actaeu
party^ when last heard from, was
stranded at Buenos Ayres and the Sto
well Sherman's crowd was in the same
predicament at Montevideo. The Ac
taea is 174 days out from New York
and the Sherman 268 days from Boston.
William A. H. Chenoweth and a
party of five left this city last spring
for the Klondike and yesterday a pri
vate letter was received stating that
they had arrived at Dawson after an
experience in which they nearly all lost
their lives. The party left Juneau and
at Big Salmon their scow was wrecked
and the entire outfit was lost. J. Jor
dan lost a restaurant outfit worth
about $6000 and the others felt they
were lucky in escaping with their lives.
While on the trail on the American
side they discovered the body of a man
who was identified as Dr. Brooks, a
dentist of this city, who left here last
February for Dawson. It was believed
that the man had broken through the
ice of the river and that the remains
had floated down the stream. They
had apparently been in the water about
ten days.
POLICE INSPIBE NO FEAxt.
Two Thieves Rifle the Cabin of a
Schooner in Broad Daylight.
While H. Kammermann was engaged
in unloading a schooner In the channel
of the San Joaquln Brick Company's
wharf yesterday morning two men
strolled aboard the boat, and claiming to
have known him before, engaged him in
conversation. After a few minutes one
of the men diflappeared and finally the
other shook hands cordially with Kam
mermann and walked away, promising to
"see him later."
When Kammermann went down into
the cabin half an hour later, he found

California. Judge Hayne pressed a
"voir dire" examination, to ascertain the
source of the witness' information on the
matters upon which he was called to tes

foundation for a legal objection to his
testimony. Attorney Pillsbury objected to
this line of examination and an adjourn

Btate of California an amendment to the Con- !
stitution of the State, amending article eleven, i
by adding a new section thereto, to â¢be known
as section "number five and one-half, relating to
consolidated city and county governments. The ;
â aid proposed new section to read as follows;,

to the satisfaction of all concerned. "The
promiscuous cutting and slashing of
freight rates," he says, "which is* detri
mental to the best interests not only of
the railroads, but also of the merchants,
will undoubtedly cease after the deliber
ations of the association, and I look for
a better feeling all around in regard to
the troublesome question. Of course ac
cusations of all kinds will be made at
the meeting. One road will charge an
other with having cut rates in the past,
while the other will retaliate in a similar
vein, but the end of it will be that we
will all agree to stick to the existing
schedule and promise to sin no more. The
business of thr meeting will be confined
to the discussion of freight rates alone,
and all other questions will be excluded
entirely.

THE SAN" FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, ATHEIST 39, 1898.
CALIFORNIANS IN
SPLENDID FORM
Astoria Regatta Will Be
gin To-Day.
MIDGETS STRONGLY TOUTED
ARE FAVORITES FOR SENIOR
BAEQE RACE.
It Is Expected Thirty Thousand Peo
ple Will Participate in
the Northern City's
Carnival.
Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
ASTORIA, Or., Aug. 18.â The As
toria Aquatic Carnival, the fifth in
the history of the city, begins to-mor
row. The celebration will last three
daysâ Friday, Saturday and Monday.
Sunday is being reserved for a regatta
excursion to the seaside.
With the exception of Frank Wilson,
who was entered in the senior skiff
from the Ariel Club of San Francisco,
all the entries from San Francisco are
here. The "midget" crew of the South
End Club arrived by train yesterday
and the Alameda crew came in last
night. S. J. Pembroke is with the
Alamedas. Both crews received an
ovation when they arrived at the depot.
They were escorted to the Murray Ho
tel by a large delegation of Astorian
citizens.
The people here think a great deal of
the San Francisco oarsmen. The boys
have made an impression with the As
torians by their sportsmanlike spirit in
helping each other while training. It
is no uncommon sight to see the op
posing skiff men and barge crews rub
bing each other down after a hard
row. Although the greatest rivalry
exists between all they have acted to
each other like members of the same
club.
The men are all In good trim. Their
work consists of five-mile rows dally
and cross-country running. The Ala
meda crew will be a little handicapped
in Its race with the "Midgets," as it
! has not rowed in a week. Al Webb,
No. 3 oar. has been In Astoria since
Monday, but the rest of the crew ar
rived only last night. They have all
been rowing singles in the Alameda
estuary during the week, however, and
are in good fettle.
The South End "Midgets" rowed over
1 the course yesterday at a racing pace.
j They were closely watched by the
northern oarsmen and their work has
already won favor. The Astorians
think them the neatest at oars that
ever pulled over this course.
The water around Astoria is the
same as on the California courses, be
ing choppy in the afternoon and com
paratively calm in the morning. The
races will take place as early as pos
sible to insure stll! water. The course
> will be a measured mile and a half
and will be laid out along the railroad
track, where observation trains will
follow the crews from start to finish.
A grand stand capable of holding 2000
people has been erected at the starting
point and a band of forty-one pieces
will be stationed there.
Boats and trains arriving from ad
jacent cities are crowded with pas
sengers. Room cannot be found to ac
commodate all that are coming. House
boats that have not been used in years
are being fitted as sleeping quarters
for the visitors to the regatta. It is
expected 30,000 people will be here, in
addition to oarsmen from Victoria,
Burrard Inlet, Vancouver, Portland
and California.
Alex. Pape of the Dolphin Club is
confident of winning the senior skiff
event. He has been trying like a Tro
jan, but Coney Ochs of the Pioneer
Club and Dr. Dennis of the South
Ends have been working Just as hard,
and the people will get their moneys
worth out <if this race. Dennis never
rowed in better form than at present
and the wonderful turn of speed Ochs
has been showing lately has caused the
knowing ones to regard him as danger
ous. For once this sculler has got him
self into proper condition. He is cer
tainly the prettiest rower of the tiio.
j and a great number of Astorians favor
â  hi* chances.
The "Midgets" look like a "moral"
for the senior barge race. The other
day they held the tug Relief, which was
once one of the fastest tugs on San
Francisco Bay, down for nearly a half
mile, the tug going at pretty good
speed.
The Ran Franciscans are talking of
doubling up after the barge and skiff
races and entering the Whitehall, tub
and swimming races. They are anxious
to take home as many prizes as possi
ble.

THE DEFENDER MAY RACE.
Iselin's Yacht to Try for the Honor
of Representing America.
NEW YORK, Aug. 18.â The Times to
day says: The varied rumors that have
been current for the past two weeks rel
ative to the formation of several syndi
cates to build as many yachts to partici
pate in the trial race for the selection of
a representative boat to defend the
America's Cup, have dwindled to one new
boat, which will be owned by the Whit
ney-Duryea*syndicate, in which it Is re
ported that Commodore J. Pierpont Mor
gan will be the largest owner. E. D.
Morgan is also said to be interested in
the new craft. Another boat which will
participate in the trial races will be con
trolled by Colonel Oliver Iselin, and will
be probably the Defender overhauled and
improved by the Herreshofl Company.
SLAIN IN A
CORN PITCH
Nathan Hollenbeck Was
Killed by Quong Mow.
THOUGHT HE WAS A ROBBER
THE CHINESE WAS WAITING
FOR THIEVES,
With a Loaded Revolver the Mon
golian Was Guarding His
Vegetable Patch From
Depredations.
OAKLAND, Aug. 18.â Nathan Hollen
beck, a poundmuster's deputy, was mur
dered late to-night by Quong Mow, a
Chinese gardener.
The murder oocurred at Parsons and
Adeline streets in North Oakland, in
which vicinity there are several large gar
dens owned by Chinese. For some time
the Chinese have been troubled by people
stealing from the gardens at night, and
to-night Quong Mow was keeping watch
armed with a big revolver. Less than an
hour before midnight Mow heard some
one in a corn patch, and on seeing a man
there he at once demanded to know his
business. Some angry words followed
and as the man started to run Mow aays
he flred a shot at him. The man then
fired two shots at the Chinaman and
the latter, so he says, replied with two
more shots, shooting the fleeing man
down in his tracks and instantly, killing
Quong Mow hid himself as soon as he
had murdered Hollenbeck, but when he
saw the patrol wagon fillea with officers
he came from his hiding place and wtll
lnSn 8e U a r r r c c hing re the road where the mur
dered man lay the officers found three
ears of corn, freshly broken from the
stalk and which lends color to the China
man's story that he found Hollenbeck
stealing from the garden. ..... _.
When Mow arrived at the jail his re
volver was examined and it was found
that all the five chambers were dis
charged. It is beleived the five shots that
were heard by people in the vicinity were
all fired by Mow. A search was made for
the Pistof with which Mow says Hollen
beck flred two shots at him. but no
weapon could be found and it is not be
lieved by the police that the murdered
"The^murdered^man was about TO years
old and lived with his wife and one child
at Twenty-sixth and San Pablo avenue.

launch and a wounded soldier are to
their credit.
The whole trouble has been caused
by the prisoners. Several of the men
confined on the Island were volunteers
and they consider themselves as being
harshly dealt with because they have
been sentenced to serve three years for
desertion during- the time of war. All
of them have relatives able and willing
to help them and the attempts at es
cape have been numerous. The plots
were discovered, however, before they
were ready to be syrung and the result
was a number of prisoners on bread
and water and a more rigorous watch.
All the attempts at escape were not
fruitless, however. One of them suc
ceeded last Tuesday night and the au
thorities on the island are now search
ing high and low for H. R. Beale, John
Meredith and Edgar M. Sweeney. They
got away in a small rowboat owned
by the son of Major Klnzie and reached
the mainland, but not before one of the
escapes had been wounded by the sol
dier on guard at the military wharf.
Sweeney is the ringleader of the
gang. He fell in love with a woman
v/ho lives at North Beach and it was
for her he deserted. This woman has
been in constant communication with
the prisoner and also with his friends
In the East. A few days ago she
wanted to send over to him a telegram
she hud received from Sweeney's
friends, but when told that It would be
read by the officer of the day on the
Island she decided to keep it until she
saw her lover.
Simultaneously with the arrival of
the telegram a small gasoline launch
called the Meteor began prowling
around Alcatraz. She was warned
away, but the next day about dusk
! she was back again. This time the
guard opened fire on her and the man
; who was running her quickly took the
; Meteor out of range. The >?xt even
ing she was back again and this time
the soldiers put a couple of shots into
the hull disabling the machinery. The
man In charge dropped into the bot
tom of the boat and remained there
until the Meteor had drifted out of j
range once more.
That means of escape was thus cut
off and to understand how the prisoners i
finally succeeded, it is necessary to go
a little into the daily routine of the
Island. Once a month, with the con- j
sent of the commandant, the prisoners
are allowed to give an entertainment.
The soldiers on the island are charg
ed 10 cents admission and visitors from
the city are charged 25 cents. The pro
ceeds go toward buying odds and ends
for the prisoners not in the prison fare.
The prisoners are locked up every
night at 5 o'clock, but when an enter
tainment is about to come off the per
formers are allowed to practice in the
library until 9 p. m. Next Tuesday j
night there is to be an entertainment
and as Sweeney and his companions
were to be among the performers they
were allowed to go to the library.
The prison, as every passenger to
Sausalito and Tiburon knows, is on the
eastern end of the island and the wall
runs clear down to the water. On the
wharf below a sentry patrols day and
night, while at the bend of the road and
on the hill leading to the prison two
other guards are stationed. Under the
wharf on -which was the sentry lay
Mr. Klnzie's boat. When the soldiers
made their escape from the library and
reached the beach, if they had made for
the wharf direct they would have un
doubtedly been discovered. Instead of
that they made a comple'.e circuit of
the island and coming up behind the
Bentry succeeded in getting into the
boat and launching it.
They had got a considerable distance
from the wharf when one of them
caught a crab and the splash attracted
the sentry's attention. He at once
opened upon them and at the fifth shot
one of the men dropped into the bottom
of the boat and began groaning hor
ribly.
Sweeney got up in the boat and shout
ed, "Don't shoot any more. Don't you
see we've got no oars? We surrender."
The sentry stopped firing and while he
was explaining matters to his superior
officer, the prisoners got out their oars
again and were off like a flash.
A prison-break alarm was turned In
and the five-oared boat belonging to
the island manned. It gave chase, but
in Bpite of the best efforts of Its crew
the prisoners got away.
The description of the prisoners is as
follows: H. R. Beale. age 21 years.
Height 5 feet 10 inches, hair dark
brown, eyes brown. He was serving
an eighteen months' sentence for In
subordination.
John Meredith, age 22 years, height 5
feet 8 Inches, hair dark brown, blue
eyes. Eighteen months for desertion.
Edgar M. Sweeney, age 24 years, dark
brown hair and brown eyes, height 5
feet 9% inches. Three years for deser
tion but the sentence was reduced to
two years by the adjutant general.
When he was taken to the Island he
was heard to remark that he wouldn't
be a prisoner for much over a month.
He has kept his word as he had not
been quite six weeks on the island
when he escaped.
WAR TAX ON LABELS.
Promissory Notes for One Cent Must
Bear a Two-Cent Stamp.
Commissioner Scott, of the Internal
Revenue Department, has notified Collec
tor Lynch that his decision has been sus
tained in the matter of the appeal of N.
Van Bergen & Co. of this city. Mr.
Lynch had ruled that a certain bitters
sold by Van .Bergen & Co. was liable
On addition to the 1% cents tax required
under schedule B to the further tax of
a 2-cent stamp for that portion of the
label which appears to be a promissory
note for 1 cent. The Commissioner holds
that "the promissory note for 1 cent is
bona fide, and made in good faith; that it
will be paid upon presentation at the of
fice of tba company, and hence is tax
able."

BIGGY'S TRAP
WAS SET FOR
SLY GAME
The Registrar Watch
ing for Stuff ers.
HOUSES FULL OF . VOTERS
RESIDENCES THAT ARE OVER
CROWDED.
An Investigation to Be Made and
Some Surprises Are Promised.
Queer Acts of Commis
sioners.
Registrar Blggy has prepared a big sur
prise for the Board of Election Commis
sioners and the voters of the city and
county of San Francisco. He has laid a
trap for would-be Illegal voters to the
number t>f a possible thousand or more,
which will be sprung to-day. The Regis
trar did not inform the commissioners as
to what he was doing, because friction
developed between him and the board
three weeks ago. which has rapidly ap
proached an acute stage.
Mr. Biggy has nearly completed a list
of all of the houses in San Francisco,
with the registered number of voters in
each one. He finds that in certain sec
tions of the city, noteworthy for election
frauds in the past years, there are from
seven to forty voters residing in some of
the houses, according to the registration,
lie has classified all houses by precincts
blocking them into squares and by to
night will be able to inform Interested
citizens as to whether one or forty gen
tlemen claiming the elective franchise
reside in any given house in the city.
"You would be astounded to know how
many voters are crowded into somÂ»
houses," remarked Mr. Biggy. "This, ton,
in the face of the fact that the registra
tion is lighter than before. We only have
62,9^3 names this year, as against 73,000
at the previous registration. "When the
registration was in progress I asked each
voter to fill out a little slip of paper on
which was printed a number which corre
sponded with a number on his registra
tion arlldavit. The registration blanks
and the little slips ran together in regu
lar Berial numbers. In lining out the slips
the voter gave his precinct, district,
name, address and description. By seg
regating these slips scores of houses are
revealed where an extraordinary number i
of voters reside. For example, there are j
forty-one voters who give their residence !
as the Palace Hotel. There are exactly i
the same number who claim to reside at |
715 Howard street. A small house, 614
Howard, where I myself resided some
years ago. turns in the modest number of
thirty-four voters.
"I propose to send my men out to each
precinct with these slips and let them
find all of the men who gave their ad
dresses. These slips run in regular or
der from one house to the next, so it will
be quick work, Just passing from door to
door. Where houses are found that do
not produce the exact number of register
ed voters called for by the slips, then I
will send citations for the missing per
sons to appear and explain. If they do
not come the register will simply be
purged.
"And what is more." continued Mr. Blg
gy, "men whom I have appointed myself
shall do this work. The commissioners
have been trying to make me agree to
turn over to them the selection of the
subordinates who are to do any investi
gating." ______________
CHINESE CUNNING.
Exposure of a Conspiracy to Land a
Woman Illegally.
Dr. Gardiner and Inspector Frank Flesh
yesterday unearthed a clever conspiracy
to land a Chinese woman named Wong
Sing Vow. She arrived on the Gaelic and
represented that she was born at 1107
Dupont street in this city. Wong Fook
Shlng alleged that he was her father and
that her statement was true. Chan Chung
corroborated the evidence, and the way
seemed clear for the landing of the maid
en. But Collector Jackson had doubts,
and referred the case to Chief Meredith
of the Chinese Bureau, who detailed Gar
diner and Flesh to investigate.
They visited the Dupont-street house
yesterday and spoke only in English, thus
throwing the Chinese olf their guard. In
the course of conversation the putative
father took out of a drawer some Chinese
manuscript with which to refresh his
memory. Flesh and Gardiner seized the
paper, "and found that it contained ques
tions and answers for Shing's use before
the bureau, describing Shing's trip from
China by way of Portland, Ore.
The woman was refused a landing.
A Supposed Suicide.
Police Officer Anderson of the Seven
teenth-street Station found a man lying
in a garden in front of a residence at
2316 Folsom street at an early hour yes
terday morning. When found he was in
an uncoPÃcious condition with a small vial
which had contained morphinS ly
ing alongside of him. The man was re
moved to the City and County Hospital,
whore he recovered sufficiently to tell the
attending physician that his name was
Sargent Mahony and that he was born In
EE63. After this he sank into unconscious
ness ana expired. The body was removed
to the Morgue. There was nothing found
by which his identification couid be as
ceitained.
LAID AWAY IN THE TOMB.
The Bodies of the Late P. J. and Mrs. Corbett
Placed in the Cemetery Receiving Vault.
The simple service read by tho Rev. Father J. Flood of the Church of the
Sacred Heart yesterday morning on the occasion of the removal of the
remains of Mr." and Mrs. P. J. Corbett from the family residence at 518
Hayes street to the receiving vault at Holy Cross Cemetery was attended by
the* bereaved sons and daughters and a numerous gathering of friends.
The desire of the family that the burial service should be preceded by
the simplest form of a funeral reading was carried out in deference to the
absence of the brothers, James and Thomas, who are en route home from
the East. T'pon their arrival cm Monday a requiem high mass will be
paid at Sacred Heart church and the remains of the parents will be laid
away in the presence of the entire family and of the great host of their
friends who absented themselves from the service of yesterday in respect
to the wishes of the Sons and daughters.
The caskets were placed upon biers s!d<- by side In the parlors of their
late residence while the priest stood at their head and pronounced In
solemn voice and impressive tone the words of comfort.
When tho service was done the caskets were borne to the funeral car
by Thomas Ashworth, William Broderick, M. Dolan, 1,. "Walsh, James
McCormick, It. William F. Kgan, C. BJgley, F. Arnold, V. .Maxwell. T.

to await burial and th econcluding services.
NEW YORKERS
OH THE WAY
TO HONOLULU
The Alliance Sailed
Last Evening,
EVERY INCH OF ROOM TAKEN
HOWEVER, A PLEASANT TRIP
IS ANTICIPATED.
The Humboldt Off for St. Michael To-
Morrow With Battery A of tha
Third Artilleryâ Arizona
Sails Sunday.
Companies F, G and H of the First New
York Regiment, commanded by Captains
Martin, Ferguson and Hitchcock respect
ively, left the Presidio yesterday morning
and marched to the Steusirt street wharf,
where they embarked for Honolu)u on
the steamer Alliance. The ladies of the
Red Cross, as usual, were on hand and
furnished the men with a lunch.
Major Charles E. Davis. Surgeon and ]
Chaplain Karl Schwartz of the regiment.
Hospital Steward Charles **. Gana, Unit
ed States army, and two men for hospital
duty, also boarded the steamer, which
carries 11 officers and 313 men. This num
ber crowds the small steamer to its ut
most capacity, but everytning possible
has been done for tha comfort of the sol
diers. The Alliance Is United by elec
tricity, and has refrigerators filled with j
fifty tons of fresh provisions. It is ex
pected that the passage will be a smooth
one and that notwithstanding the crowd
ed condition of the vessel the soldiers
will enjoy the trip. The alliance pulled
out of her dock last evening at o o clock
and at once started on her voyage to
Honolulu. She was given the usual part
ing salutÂ© of a chorus 01 strum whistles.
The departure ot these companies leaves
only companies A and B and a half of
Company D of the New York Regiment
still in camp. They have been ordered to
embark on the Scandia some time next
week. Lieutenant Colonel Stacnnle and
Majors Emmett and Scott remain with
the companies still here. Captain Staats
of Company B yesterday tenuered his
resignation to the War Department In
asmuch as the war for which he enlisted
is over he does not wish to remain away
from his business Interests in the East.
The troops to go to Manila on t^ Ari
zona will embark to-morrow morning,
and the steamer will sail Sunday morn-
Ing The delay of one day is occasioned
by the non-arrival of a consignment of
one million rounds of ammunition, which
is expected from the East to-morrow
morning.
The Humboldt will sail to-morrow
morning for St. Michael with Battery A
of the Third Artillery.
Eighth California Drill.
A largely attended meeting of tho ladles
was held at the parlors of the Young
Men's Christian Association yesterday af
ternoon. The meeting was called espe
cially In the interest of the drill to be
given by the Eighth California Regiment
Saturday afternoon, August 27, at Rec
reation Park. Sixteenth and Folsom
streets. Committees were appointed in
various departments, and it was decided
to ask the ladles from Alameda, Oakland
and Berkeley to assist in providing tho
collation for the regiment on that occa
sion. As this probably will be the last
drill given, there is a.great deal of inter
est being manifested, and excursions are
being arranged from many Interior cit
ies as far as Red Bluff and Colusa. The
Southern Pacific has offered exceedingly
low rates, good for three days, and the
drill promises to be one of the moat en
joyable given.
Red Cross Notes.
Tho Red Cross will give all the men on
tho Arizona a lunch to-morrow, and the
kind friends of the society who have been
so generous before are requested to send
to the ferry, bread, butter and meat for
sandwiches, doughnuts and fruits, as
early in the morning as possible, so that
the hospitality committee can prepare
the lunches before noon. I
A large supply of goods will be sÂ»ont on
both the Scandia and the Arizona for the
Red Cross Hospital in Manila and for
use on tho ships j.olng over, and also a
large supply for tile nso of the transport
as a hospital ship on its return trip with
sick soldiers.
The Red Cross wishes to contradict the
statement that tho boys going h|>me on
furloughs had imposed on the society for
their luncheon, as they had been given
$1 ,"0 a day by the Government. I'ntil
last Tuynilay they were not given rations
or money, and the Red Cross brought it
to the attention of the Government, so
that now all the men are given their
transportation and $1 50 a day. This will
relieve the lied Cross of that work In the
future.
War Incidents.
The Seventh California will on Monday
move its camp from its present location
in ar Point Loboa avenue to the Presidio.
General Miller has issued an order at
taching the recruits of the Second Ore
gon regiment to the Third Battalion of
the Twenty-third Infantry. They will
said for Manila on the Scandia.
Lieutenant Fowler of the Tennessee
regiment, who is Investigating the case
of the privates of that regiment impli
cated in the attack upon the negro, Dan
Thomas, will submit his report to Colonel

CANNOT FIND THE BODY.
Searchers for Mrs. Paxton's Re-
mains Meet With No Success.
The body of Mrs. Charles E. Paxton
has not yet been recovered, and the
chances are against its being found un
til it comes to the surface of its own ac
cord. Henry Peterson, who has been en
gaged by Captain Messer, spent all of
yesterday grappling for the remains with
out success. Mr. Paxton has offered a
reward for the recover}' of the body, and
a number of boatmen were out all day
dragging in places where an eddy might
have carried all that is left of the un
fortunate woman.
Mrs. Cone and Mrs. Peterson are still
unable to leave their rooms. Captain
11 art and the men of the Scandia who
were in the disaster were around yester
day nothing the worse for the ducking.
An examination of the launch bears out
Captain' Hart's statement that she was
going full speed when struck. The throt
tle was wide open when the boat was
lifted out of the water.
An examination of the launch and the
McDowell shows that both boats are
scraped on the starboard side, the launch
on her starboard quarter and the steam
er on her starboard bow. In that event
the Scandia's launch must have been
turned clear around and heading 1 north
when the collision occurred. In no other
way can the marks on the two boats
be accounted for.
The United States Insp^tors of Hulls
and Boilers have no jurisdiction over
the matter, so General Merriam has ap
pointed a board of officers to investigate
the collision and fix the blame. The de
tail of the board is as f follows: Major
David H. Klnzie, Third United States
Artillery; Major Gus G. Grant, Sixth
California Volunteer Infantry; First
Lieutenant John A. Lockwood, Fourth
United States Cavalry.

Wants Its Charter Back.
Golden Gate Lodge No. 6 of the Benevo
lent and Protective Order of Elks of the
United States of America filed suit yester
day against the grand lodge of the order
and San Francisco Lodge No. 3 to com
pel the first named defendant to restore
to the plaintiff its fraternal charter,
which was declared forfeited on July 8,
1897, and subsequently transferred to San
Francisco Lodge No. 3. The plaintiff al
that Its charter was illegally taken
from it and transferred to San Francisco
Lodge contrary to the bylaws of the or
