THE PRESIDENT
IS FULLY ALIVE
TO THE DANGER
Whatever the Government of
Spain Does the Administration
f at Washington Will Be
Found Ready.
â¢ Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 4
1 Prominent Republicans,
Senators and Representa
tives who have called on
the President during the last
day or two left the White
House with a different view
of the attitude of the admin
istration than they had held
before. Heretofore it has
been intimated in some
quarters that the President
tailed to appreciate the real
gravity of the situation aris
ing from the Maine incident
and that all was not being
done which ought to be done
in preparation for possible
contingencies. But there is
nobedy who is more deeply
impressed than the President
with the seriousness of the
outlook. In the course of
conversation with him one of
the Western men commented
on the Maine incident and be
gan to congratulate the Pres
ident oh the manner in which
the clouds seemed to be
breaking away.
â¢ "It looks as though the compli
cations were passing away, and
as though things would now be
smoothly adjusted."
The President had been chatting
pleasantly up to this time, but his
/ace at once grew grave and he re
marked earnestly: "Yes, superfi
cially, all may look well; but we
cannot tell yet. The outlook is not
clear by any means."
One of those who were in the
company said the conversation gave
him an entirely new view of af
fairs. It was not so much what
the President said as the soberness
of his face and the earnestness of
his manner that carried the im
pression.
* It is not alone the tragedy in
Havana harbor and the complica
tions growing out of it that give
the administration anxiety. The
President realizes that the time is
very close at hand when something
may have to be done toward the
The San Francisco Call
solution of the general Cuban
problem, and that no matter what
may be the discoveries of the Board
of Inquiry the question of the es
tablishment of peaceful conditions
in Cuba will remain, pressing with
greater force for settlement day by
day. If anything is to be done by
the administration toward carrying
into effect the promises implied in
the President's message it is felt
that action will have to be taken
soon.
Should intervention be determ
ined upon it would have to be un-
dertaken before the deadly Cuban
: summer begins, and this limits the
time for action to the two months
intervening before the first of May.
; On May i the yellow fever sets
jin at Havana and conditions be
come intolerable for those who are
; not acclimated. To make any kind
! of a demonstration after that time
; it is thought might only result in a
i humiliating fiasco.
There is another consideration
which has weight with the Presi
dent. The time set for the evolu
tions of the North Atlantic squad
ron in southern waters expires in
the last week of April. The squad
ron was sent south in the expecta
tion that its presence would be
serviceable in bringing to a satis
factory conclusion the administra
tion's negotiations for a settlement
of Cuban troubles, and the idea of
calling the squadron home with no
result accomplished except the loss
of one of its sh:ps does not appeal
to those who are responsible for
the maneuvers.
Whatever may be the decision
as to the cause of the Maine disas
ter, it is believed that events are {
shaping themselves rapidly toward |
interference by the United States, i
The preparations for strengthen-!
ing the coast defenses and for put- !
ting the aimy and navy in prime j
condition are no longer concealed, i
The administration is not looking!

COURT OF INQUIRY
TO RESUME WORK
IN CUBA'S CAPITAL
It Is Not Believed the Work to Be
Done There Will Require
Very Many Days
More.
Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gordon Br-nnott.
HAVANA, March 4.â The Herald-
Call dispatch boat arrived here this
evening. Other vessels that left Key
West this morning turned back on ac
count of the heavy sea, but seeing th<
Dewey steam on toward Havana turned
again and followed.
The court of inquiry is expected on
the Mangrove to-morrow and may hold
a session in the afternoon. Captain
Sigsbee expects the hearing will be con
cluded not later than Tuesday, when the
committee will proceed to Washington.
They may vote on the cause of the ac
cident before leaving here; if not, then
before reaching Washington.
Ensign Powelson and three divers will
be before the court here, Powelson
being the only witness of great impor
! tance. He has prepared a diagram
i showing the condition of the Maine
| after the explosion. This is said to be
j important in detail, and comprehensive.
It will be placed before the court at the
first session and Powelson will go over
it explaining the lines and plates.
The Spanish divers were again at
work this afternoon for about an hour.
The American divers went over the
ground with them, so it is not believed
that either the American or the Span
1 ish divers found anything. The Maine
is rapidly sinking, and it is feared when
stripped of the heavy upper works may
topple over. The starboard smoke
stack was taken away to-day and taken
into the gulf and thrown overboard.
The Bache is expected to-morrow to
take the unidentified bodies to Key
West for burial. One body, not identi
fied, was taken from the wreck this
morning terribly mangled. Another
i body, which may be that of Merritt, was
j found in the warrant officers' mess
room this afternoon. It was tightly
wedged by the chest and was not re
covered. It may be taken out to-mor
j row.
The American divers having exam
ined more or less thoroughly the ward
room of the Maine and the senior and
junior officers' mess-rooms, to-day
tried to effect an entrance into the petty
officers' compartment in the hope of
finding some bodies there. However, j
each day the belief grows stronger that
few if any more bodies will be recov
ered.
Captain Sharp, who is in charge of the
Merritt & Chapman wrecking outfit, ap
preciates the difficulties of the situation
better than others. He will not specify
any time when the big guns will be re
leased. It is necessary to first remove
the top of the turrets. These are held
in place by steel bolts, which must be
cut loose. The best informed people
here think a month will elapse before
the turrets are opened.
In the meantime work on the minor
details of the wreck will proceed with all
possible speed.
The discipline on board the Spanish
cruiser Vizcaya is very high, which
greatly gratifies the Spaniards.
A hurricane which swept over the
port of Batabano. on the south coast of
Cuba, opposite Havana, has done great
damage. It destroyed a hut in which
were quartered a number of soldiers be
longing to the Castilian battalion, kill
ing two of the men and wounding
twenty-five others. Thousands of trees
were swept away and the ships in the
harbor were obliged to put hurriedly to
sea to avoid being wrecked.
Senator Proctor returned this after
noon from Artemisa earlier than ex
pected, leaving there Miss Clara Barton,
Superintendent Elwell and two Red
Cross Society doctors, with orders to
assist in establishing a relief depot. The
Senator was enabled to see a part of the
country which he had not visited, where
tobacco and bananas were once the
staple.
WORK AT THE MARE
ISLAND NAVY YARD
Twenty-Five Additional Men Re-
quired, Including Ship-Fitters
and Shipwrights.
VALLEJO, March 4.â Cards were
sent out this afternoon for twenty
five additional workmen, including
ship-fltters and shipwrights. It is
expected that these men will be put
to work on the Charleston, now lying
alongside the wharf. The Philadel
phia is lying in midstream with noth
ing being done to the cruiser.
There is no unusual activity at the
yard. The only department reporting
an increase in numbers is that of the
department of construction, which dur
ing the past three weeks has had an
increase of some sixty odd in the work
ing force. The men to be taken on
within the next two or three days are
for this department. The department
of ordnance, having in charge all the
ordnance and ammunition, has only a
force of twenty men, though should a
large shipment of powder and shell be
made to the Mohican it would not ne
cessitate an increase in the working
force of this department, as the greater
portion of the work of transferring the
stores would be made by the crew
from the Mohican, if that ship car
ries the stores to China.
Carnegie's Case Hopeless.
NEW YORK, March 4.â The Morning
Telegraph says that Andrew Carnegie,
who is at Cannes, is suffering from a
complication of diseases and that hia
caÃe is hopeless. (
THE UNITED STATES
MAY HEREAFTER BE
A BIG PURCHASER
President McKinley Gets Ready for the
Worst and the Relations of the Two
Powers Have Taken a Most
Hostile Aspect.
LONDON, March 4.â lt was re
ported to-day that Spain had pur
chased two cruisers which the Arm
strongs have been building for Bra
zil, the Amazonas and a sister ship,
the Barrozo, of 4000 tons each, 23
knots and 10 guns. Later, when
Armstrong's manager was asked as
to the truth of this report, he denied
it most emphatically. "The Ama
zonas left the Tyne yesterday with a
native crew for Brazil," he said.
"The Barrozo, her sister ship, also
built by us, is ready to sail." Spain is
also negotiating for and will probably
secure two cruisers of a similar type
which have been building in France
for Brazil. These are presumed to be
the Deodoro and the Floriano, which
are building at La Sienne, Toulon.
These are small but powerful battle
ships. Their tonnage is only 3162,
but they carry four 10-inch rifles in
turrets in addition to two 6-inch and
four 10-inch guns and good second
ary batteries. Their coal endurance,
h.o*reveÂ», ii smfcll and their foÂ»-te
would seem to be coast defense oper
ations, or cruising near the base of
supplies.
The Spanish Government is also
endeavoring to secure guns and large
supplies of munition in England and
on the Continent for immediate use.
The Government of Spain seems to
have funds, for it is understood to be
paying a large part of the purchase
money in cash, giving good security
for the balance, these being the only
terms upon which the Armstrongs
would deal. Some weeks ago Spain
attempted to purchase ships and
supplies in England on credit from
prominent firms having close rela
tions with the Government, but after
inquiries the firms refused to give
credit. Since then Spain has raised
funds from unknown sources. Diplo
mats in London express the belief
that French financiers are helping
the Spanish Government, although
this is denied in a Madrid dispatch
which says Spain is without money
other than that needed to send the
fleet already started across the ocean.
It is known that Spain is trying to
purchase three other ships which will
be rebuilt by the Armstrongs, but
she has not yet succeeded in making
a bargain, consequently there is still
time if the United States wishes to
forestall her.
The Amazonas and Barrozo, the
two cruisers said to have been pur
chased by Spain, are sister ships of
3450 tons, 7500 horse-power and an
estimated speed of 20 knots. They
were built to order for the Brazilian
Government at Armstrong & Co.'s
yard, Elswick, the Barrozo being
launched August 25, 1896, and the
Amazonas December 4, 1896, while
a third one is still on the stocks.
They are sheathed with wood and
coppered, thus avoiding frequent
dockage and enabling them to keep
at sea and maintain their intended
speed. Their dimensions are 330 feet
10 inches length, 43 feet 9 inches
beam and a mean draught of 16 feet
10 inches. The protective deck ex
tending clear fore and aft is 3 inches
thick. The normal coal supply on
3450 tons displacement is 700 tons
and the bunker capacity is 850 tons,
calculated to give a steaming radius
of 8000 knots at the most economical
speed.
The armament consists of six 6
inch rapid fire guns of 50-caliber â or
25 feet in length â located so as to
fire three ahead and three astern.
There are also four 50-caliber 4.7
inch rapid fire guns, ten 6-pounder
and four 1 -pounder Nordenfelt rapid
fire guns, four Maxim guns, two
landing guns and three torpedo
tube,s.
The two armored coast defense ves
sels ordered by Brazil from the
Forges et Chautiers de la Mediter
ranee, have been named Marshal Dao
doro and Marshal Floriano. Their
construction has been delayed owing
to changes which the Brazilian Navy
Department desired to introduce in
the design. They are of 3112 tons
displacement on a draught of 13 feet

THE PRESIDENT PREPARING
FOR WAR WITH SPAIN
NEW YORK, March 4.â The Herald's Washington corre
sponJent sends trie following :
The report that Spain has purchased or was negotiating for
warships being built by the Elswick Company of England for
Brazil, and for other ships under construction, has aroused great
speculation here as to whether this Government was contem
plating similar action.
>Â° Â°<
Â£ With a view of ascertaining the facts 3
Â£ I called to-day upon a high official of c
Â£ the administration and obtained the Â«
>o official admission â made for the first Â«=
g time â that, while the President does <
HÂ» not anticipate war, he recognizes that Â«
Â£ fciwe Is a possibility of hostilities Â°j
C growing out of the Cuban problem and 3
G the Maine disaster, and that he pro- 3
Â£ poses to be prepared for it.
There has been ample evidence of this in the extensive
preparations, patent to everybody, which have been in progress
for some time, but there has been no official admission to this
effect until now.
AMERICAN FLEET
NOW AT HONGKONG
THREATENS MANILA
There Will Be FiÂ£htinÂ£ in the
Eastern and the Western
Seas if War Should
Come,
NEW YORK, March 4.â
The Herald's Washington cor
respondent telegraphs: Eight
men-of-war which are prac
tically completed in foreign ship
yards have been offered for sale
to the United States. The
President has given considera
tion to the advisability of plac
ing an option on them.
It is understood that the department
proposes to order the cruiser Baltimore,
the flagship of the Pacific station, to re
enforce the Asiatic squadron. She will
carry to Hongkong a large supply of
powder and projectiles for the United
States ships in those waters.
Secretary Long has ordered a board
to examine the merchant vessels of the
United States to determine what
changes will be necessary to transform
them into auxiliary cruisers.
Anticipating an appropriation by
Congress, orders were given to-day
under which the plans for four coal
sheds at Key West were prepared and
completed in great haste, and the sheds
will be fitted, as soon as built, with fuel
for the North Atlantic squadron.
It is admitted in naval circles that the
matters referred to above, which have
been engaging the attention of the
President and the members of his Cabi
net, are the most important attempted
up to this time. A high official of the
administration told me to-day of the
President's consideration of the propo
sition that this Government follow the
example reported to have been set by
Spain and purchase some of the ships
now under construction abroad.
I learned from him that the Navy De
partment has been carefully watching
the construction of ships abroad
through the eyes of its naval attaches at
London, Paris, St. Petersburg, Berlin,
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Vienna and Rome. This surveillance
has been maintained for two months,
but more especially since the Maine
disaster. Through these naval attaches
and from ship-builders themselves the
Secretary of the Navy has learned that
he can now purchase two small-sized
battle-ships, two -ignored cruisers and
four torpedo boaMKU at comparatively
small prices. Buiraere have promised
that they ,can deliver the vessels to
agents of this Government at this time
complete in every respect, and all that
will be necessary for the administration
to do will be to order the necessary de
tails of officers and men to proceed to
the shipyards, go on board the vessels
and take them to any point which may
be desired.
The builders have urged that the pur
chases be made at once, as they say that
a declaration of war between the United
States and Spain will result in the en
forcement of the neutrality laws and
prevent the sale of the ships. These
battleships and armored cruisers have
been built by English and German
firms for Governments which are now
unable to pay for them, so that this
Government would have no difficulty in
obtaining the vessels by simply putting
down the necessary amount of cash. The
torpedo boats have been offered by the
Thornycroft Ship-building Company,
whose boats are recognized by experts
to be among the best in the world.
While I was unable to learn the
names of the ships which have been of
fered to this Government, there is rea
son to believe that among them are
thrÂ«e powerful ships under construction
at the Vulcan Works, Stettin. Germany,
for the Chinese Government. These
three ships are of 8000 tons displace
ment, contracted to make 10.5 knots and
will be able to carry not less than 1000
tons of coal in their bunkers.
There is also reason to believe that in2
case of trouble this Government could
purchase from Japan the Kasaci and the
Chiosa, which are neariiiK completion
at Philadelphia and the Union Iron
Works. The official with whom I
talked had no doubt that Japan would
be be willing to aid the United States
by selling the warships before the com
mencement of war. In the event of war
this Government might feel constrained,
he said, to take the ships and settle for
them afterward.
As the Herald has stated, Chile has a
fine armored cruiser of 8400 tons dis
placement, the O'Higgins, under con
struction, which could be purchased, it
is thought, if necessity demanded.
"Of course," said the administration
officer to me, "this Government will
have to pay nearly $10,000,000 for the
four battle-ships and cruisers and the
four torpedo boats which have been of
fered to it.
"If it should be found necessary to
take the Kasagi and Chiosa a big sum
would have to be paid to Japan. The
President realizes, I think, that the mar
gin of safety, so far as armored ships
are concerned, is dangerously close, and
Spain stands almost as good a chance of
winning as the United States in case of
war.
"The loss o. the Maine reduced our
armored fleet on the Atlantic to the
battle-ships lowa. Indiana and the Mas
sachusetts, the second-class battle-ship
Texas and the armored cruisers Brook
lyn and New York, making six in all.
The Spanish navy has now in commis
sion or practically ready for active serv
ice the battle-ship Pelayo, and the ar
mored cruisers Ahnirante Oqucndo.
Vizcaya, Infanta Maria Teresa. Carlos
V. Cristobal Colon and Princessa de
Asturias. The completion of the battle
ship Numancia and the armored cruisers
Catalina and Cardinal Cisneros is
being pushed, and they will be ready for
service in a few months. The total ar
mored fleet of Spain in commission to
day comprises seven^ ships, with three
shortly to be completed, and if the re
port of to-day should prove true two
more are to be added to her effective
force.
" ( >ur battle-ships are superior to
anything in Spain's navy, but it we are
to continue this superiority it would be
necessary for us to buy ships that have
been offered to us for sale. I have no
doubt that Congress will make the ne
cessary appropriation should the Presi
dent take the ships."
Before the cruiser Baltimore proceeds
to the Asiatic station she will await the
coming of the corvette Mohican, which
will convey to Honolulu from Mare
Island a great many tons of ammuni
tion for the ships of the Asiatic squad
ron.
There has been some talk of relieving
the cruiser Olympia by the Baltimore,
but no orders contemplating such ac
tion will be issued in the near future.
The addition of the Baltimore to the
Asiatic squadron will make that squad
ron sufficiently strong, it is believed in
official circles, to easily defeat the five
small Spanish vessels in the waters of
the Philippine Islands and to reduce the
fortifications of Manilla. â¢
The concentration of the Asiatic
squadron at Hongkong, 600 miles from
Manilla, was completed to-day when the
cruiser Boston and the gunboat Con
cord arrived at that port. Upon the ar
rival of the Baltimore at Hongkong,
which will be in the course of a month,
this Government will have at the British
port the Baltimore, the Olympia. the
Raleigh and the Boston and the gun
boats Concord and Petrel.
I was told to-day that the Asiatic
squadron was not so badly off for am
munition as sensational reports this
morning indicated. When the Concord
went to the Asiatic station last fall she
carried with her thirty-five tons of pro
jectiles and powder, which were distrib
uted among the vessels on the station.
The department has been attempting to
make shipments to Asia by tramp
steamers, but has been unsuccessful.
In accordance with orders issued last
week by Assistant Secretary Roosevelt,
Commander Pendleton, in charge of
the ordnance department at the Wash
ington Navy Yard, has commenced
shipment to New York of ten six-inch
guns built for the Atlanta and Chicago.
but which will in reality be placed
aboard the ships of the American line.
This shipment will be followed by an
other, which will include twenty-two
five-inch guns. It is proposed by the
department to have eveo'*hins? in readi
ness so that instant action can be taken
without the slightest unnecessary delay.
' There is no longer .any doubt of the
intention of the administration to keep
the North Atlantic squadron at the
strategical point at which it is now sta
tioned for some time to come.
FLAGSHIP OLYMPIA
TO BE ORDERED HERE.
The Peerless Queen of Cruisers Soon
to Be Sent to San Francisco
From the Asiatic Station.
WASHINGTON, March 4.â lt is prob
able that the Olympia, flagship of the
Asiatic Squadron and the peerless queen
of cruisers, will come home to San
Francisco. The navigation bureau has
thisrnovementunder consideration, and
in view of the fact that the ship has
been three years away from a navy
yard engaged in hard cruising service,
even if there were no other reason, it
is likely that the order will be given.
The Olympia is a protected cruiser of
extraordinary speed and endurance,
â with a battery strong enough to over
power almost anything short of a bat
tleship, and speed enough to run away
from that or anything else that she
does not care to fight.
The torpedo boat Winslow. at Nor
folk, has completed repairs, and will
Join the flotilla at Key West as soon
as the gale on the coast blows itself
out and makes the run down safe.
SAYS CONSUL LEE
SHOULD BE RECALLED.
One Conservative Spanish Newspaper
Complains of the Diplomat's
Course.
MADRID. March 4.â The Epoca, ..a
sober-sided conservative paper, says:
"We believe that just in the same man
ner as the Washington Government
acted in the case of Senor de Lome,
which was a case much less grave, so
should Senor Gullon act in the case of
General Lee. The relations of that of
ficial with the insurrectionists and his
maintenance in Havana are prejudicial
to the good relations of Spain and the
United States."
COURT IS AT
A STANDSTILL
No Sessions Have Been
Held During the Past
Two Days.
Proceedings May Be Further
Delayed by the Sickness
of a Stenographer.
Officers of the Maine Indignant Be
cause Survivors Are Ordered
to Duty at Once.

KEY WEST, Fla., March 4.â The
work of the Court of Inquiry is at a
standstill. No sessions were held either
yesterday or to-day. Judge Advocate
Marix has spent the entire day ashore,
while Captain Sampson remained
aboard his ship, the lowa, until 3
o'clock this afternoon. He then came
ashore and conferred with Admiral Si
card and Commander West, chief of the
admiral's staff, in the parlors 'of the
Key West Hotel.
Captain Chadwick and Lieutenant
Commander Potter remained all day on
the flagship Xew York.
The taking of further testimony in
Havana may be somewhat delayed by a
curious complication. J. W. Hulz, the
official stenographer, was permitted to
start for Washington last evening.
Members of the Court of Inquiry
thought he could be spared, as the
small quantity of evidence remaining
to be heard at Havana could easily be
recorded by R. L. Bissell, who is the
court's official typewriter, and is also
an efficient stenographer.
Now that Mr. Hulz has gone, Mr.
Bissell is afflicted with a very sore arm
as a result of vaccination, to which
he had to submit last week in Havana
at the hands of Dr. Brunner. The arm
is swollen and so badly inflamed that
it may prevent rapid work on the type
writer, and thus become really a seri
ous impediment to the conclusion of the |
work of the Court of Inquiry. Substi- !
tutes cannot readily be put in the places j
of these men. They are especially skill- |
ful, and are sworn Government em- ,
ployes of the highest class in their pro- |
fession. The court's two days of idle- ;
ness and its obvious purpose to be in
no hurry to get back to Havana have ,
not unnaturally strengthened the be
lief already prevailing here that there
is a clearly defined purpose to gain fur
ther time before the conclusion of the
report on the investigation.
The first detachment of the Maine's i
survivors to go north will probably i
start to-morrow. It consists of Master- I
at-Arms Ladd and four men from the
steward's department. They are ex
pected to go direct to the receiving ship
Vermont in the New York Navy Yard. \
From there they will probably be de
tailed soon to duty on other vessels.
Master-at-Arms Ladd, it is said, will be
transferred to the ram Katahdin. Or
ders were received this afternoon de- '
tailing all the enlisted men for imme
diate duty on board the various ships
now at or near Key West. The only
exceptions are the five mentioned who j
go north, and four or flve^jthers whose j
injuries render them stfill unfit for duty.
No orders have yet tfeen received for j
the Maine's officers, bat they are open- !
ly indignant that their subordinates are j
ordered back to duty without opportu- j
nity to go home. The order issued to- \
day affects about fifty men.
After two postponements of its de- i
parture, the Court of Inquiry left for â¢â 
Havana this evening on the lighthouse !
tender Mangrove. It is believed by the
best informed here that the court will
complete its labors In the Cuban capi
tal within ten days.
Only three of the six days the court ,'
was here were devoted to the work of j
investigation. The inactivity of yester- j
day and to-day is still unexplained, ex- j
cept by a semi-official statement that
Rear Admiral Slcard was awaiting in
structions from Washington. The ses- :
sions, it is generally understood, devel- â 
oped no evidence by which the court i
could definitely determine the cause of i
the explosion.
A naval officer in close touch with
the members of the court said to-day:
"With one exception, the witnesses
who testified here -were Maine surviv
ors. The evidence, though, in most
rases taking longer to tell, can be
summed up in the words of an enlisted
man who, when Judge Advocate Marlx
ask^d him what he knew about the ex
plosion, replied : 'Sir. I was blown up.
I was saved, and I'm here.' That was
all he could swear to."
On* important fact has been learned,
however. It is that, although the mem
bers of the court may have their indi
vidual theories, they are by no meand
prepared as a body to render a decisive
verdict. The official already quoted
said: "If the court has yet heard any
testimony which would enable it to de
cide intelligently that the Maine was
blown up from external causes, 1 am
the most mistaken man in the world.
Before the coming Havana sessions are
over, It may secure such evidence, and
possibly find the blowing up was inten
tional. It will learn from the divers the
actual condition of the ship after the
explosion, as it has already learned
from the survivors most of the details
of the ship's condition before the ex
plosion. With these bases thoroughly
established, the court will hear more
expert theoretical testimony, and then
reach a verdict."
This statement can be taken as more
worthy of reliance than that of the
Maine officer, who said the other day
that he believed the court was bound
on evidence already heard to find tne
cause of the explosion external. Its
conservatism is also at variance with
the opinions of many other naval offi
cers here, especially those of the young
er set. and directly contrary to the be
lief of most of the marine survivors,
that their ship was intentially blown
up.
Before sailing to-night Captain
Sampson had a long consultation with
Admiral Sicard.
! JUDGE-ADVOCATE MARIX'S
SIGNIFICANT WORDS.
Says the Court's Report Will Be In
teresting Beading for the
American People.
NEW YORK, March 4.â A Key West
special to the World says: A corres
pondent met Lieutenant Commander
Marlx half an hour before the Man
grove, with tbe Maine Court of In
quiry, sailed back to Havana to-day.
He laughed heartily at the idea that
the court investigation bad failed to
prove that the Maine had been blown
up from the outside.
"That's all bosh." he said. "Why
can't the newspapers stop theorizing
until we get ready to report? Then. I
assure you, we shall have some read

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 5, 1898.
ARTILLERY BILL
TO BE PASSED
Soon the Pending Meas
ure Will Go Through
in the House.
Speaker Reed Will Not Regard
It in the Light of an Emer
gency Measure.
But a Majority of the Representatives
Favor Prompt Preparations for
Contingencies.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 4.â A Washing-
I ton special to the Herald says: Chair
man Hull of the Committee on Military
Affairs is now confident that he will get
the bill providing for two additional
regiments of artillery through the
House next week. He told me to-day
that, while the Committee on Rules had
not yet acted on his resolution provid
ing for a special order for the consid
eration of the bill, he had what he re- I
garded as an assurance that they would
report a special order some day next i
week, and that the bill would be
passed. i
There was an informal conference of i
Republican members of the Committee
on Rules last night, at which the ques
tion of when the bill should come up \
was considered. There was some talk
of bringing it up to-day, but after some
discussion It was decided that it should
go over until next week. No specific
day was agreed upon and it is possi
ble that it may be delayed even longer.
Speaker Reed's position on the artillery
bill has been the subject of consider
able discussion, and it has been repre
sented in some quarters that he was
opposed to it. I am able to state that
the Speaker does not oppose the bill as
a measure for the increase of the army
so as to afford sufficient men to prop
erly care for new jfuns, which have
been mounted in seacoast fortifications.
He is one of the men in Washington,
however, who refuses to recognize the
existence of danger of a rupture with
Spain over the Maine disaster, and he
will not consider the artillery bill in the
light of an emergency measure. Tak
ing this view of the matter it is natu
ral that he should not regard the de
lay of a week or two of any particular
consequence. When the artillery bill
once gets before the House it will go
through with a rush. The opposition
to it has practically collapsed. Repre
senative Sulzer of New York is not the
only Democrat in the House who has
seen new light in regard to this bill.
I called on Boutelie this evening, and
asked for his views on the situation.
He declined to discuss it in any way or
to say what he thought of the proposi
tion to buy ships abroad for use tn the
event of an emergency. He declined to
discuss the work of his committee In ,
any way or to say what action would J
be taken. He declared that there was
no dispo.sitk.-n on the part of the com
mittee to refuse to give the navy all
that was needed.
SPAIN BUYING V SHIPS.

2 inches. Their dimensions are 267
feet 6 inches in length and 48 feet
beam. Being intended solely for coast
defense, the motive power of their
two vertical triple-expansion engines
is to develop only 3400 horse-power
under natural draught and give a
speed of 14 knots, while under forced
draught the speed is to reach at least
15 knots.
Hul 1 . protection is afforded by a
Harveyized steel belt along the water
line, from forward to aft, 5 feet 6
inches in depth amidships and 13 3-4
inches thick, tapering at the ends to
4 inches. The ship has also an arm
ored deck 1.3 inches thick. The
armament consists of two 9.4-inch
Armstrong rifles mounted in turrets
of 8-inch Harveyized steel, four 4.7
inch quick-firers in casements of 2.9
inch armor and two 6-inch howitzers.
The secondary battery comprises four
6-pounders, two 1 -pounders, two ma
chine guns, two field pieces and two
torpedo tubes submerged. The coal
capacity is 236 tons and the comple
ment 200 men.
The condition of these two ships
is no doubt very backward as to com
pleteness. It is not even probable
that they have been launched.
Neither of them would cut much of
a figure in a naval demonstration, as
their coal supply would scarcely
suffice to carry them across the At
lantic. As coast defenders they are
only efficient so long as they are
within reach of a coal pile. Without
this latter they must depend upon
escorts and transports.
BRAZIL DID NOT
SELL THE SHIPS.
They Were Disposed of to Spain
Probably by the Firm That
Was Building Them.
Copyrighted, IS9S, by James Gordon Bennett.
BUENOS AY RES, March 4.â 1 am ad
vised by the Herald's correspondent in
Rio Janeiro, Brazil, that nothing is offi
cially known about the reported pur
chase by Spain of the ships now build
ing in England for Brazil.
NEW YORK, March 4.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Con
siderable surprise has been expressed
here over the announcement from Lon
don that Spain has purchased the two
cruisers which the Armstrongs have
been building for the Brazilian Govern
ment. Brazil is in entire sympathy
with the United States as against
Spain, and stands ready to join with this
country in any step that may be made
toward recognizing Cuban independ
ence.
If Spain has secured these two ships,
it is believed the sale has been made
by the Armstrongs, rather than by
Brazil, notice having probably "been
given to the firm that they were at
liberty to sell them if a purchaser could
be found. There is no doubt the United
States could have had first choice had
the administration desired them. In ad
dition to these ships, constructed by
the Armstrongs for Brazil, that Gov
ernment haÃ under contract three tor
pedo vessels of 1030 tons each at Kiel,
Germany. None of the Brazilian ves
sels is of a type particularly desired by
the United States. The weakness of
our navy is specially in armored ves
sels.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, March 4.â The War De
partment is rushing work on the forti
fications of San Diego harbor. The
third ten-inch disappearing gun and
the last to be mounted at present at
Ballast Point is now at the end of the
Sprockels wharf, and a force of men
under the supervision of Captain Pol
hemus is at work getting ready to
move it upon a large lighter. It will
be put on board the lighter at high
tide to-morrow morning and towed to
the fortifications. All the material for
the fortifications at Ballast Point is
now here, and all that remains is to
mount the guns, the last carriage hav
ing been delivered last week.
There is now a force of between
thirty and forty men from Battery D
making roadways and other prepara
tions for the handling and mounting of
the guns. The original intentions of the
Government were to allow the em
placements and cement work at the
point fully six months to set and
harden before the guns and carriages
with their enormous freight were put
in place. But present orders are to
hasten the work at least to a point
where the guns can be put in promptly
if needed.
Each gun was tested by the.Govern
ment officials before being sent here.
The three emplacements for the dis
appearing guns are now finished, the
last one being completed this month.
The first emplacement was finished
about six months ago, and on this em
placement the first gun will be mount
ed. The work will require about two
weeks. After the gun is mounted and
ready Major Field >>f the Second Ar
tillery, inspector for this district, will
be here to inspect thf gun and have it
fired with a full charge to test the em
placements. The charge for each gun
requires 2co2 c 0 pounds of brown pris
iiiati<- po\ der, and the projectile
weighs r>. r )0 pounds. At the muzzle the
projectile can penetrate twenty inches
<if steel, and eighteen inches of steel at
1000 yards. The first gun will be mount
ed as soon as the detachment now at
work from Battery D finishes the work
on the roads leading to the emplace
ments.

a clear declaration of policy the
United States will be ready for any
contingency that may result from
such declaration.
The Speaker and his trusted fol
lowers are doing what they can to
counteract the war spirit in the
House. During the past week Mr.
Reed has been talking a great deal
with members, and some of the
Republicans are authority for the
statement that he is making a per
sonal canvass for recruits to sup
port him in resisting the anti-Span
ish sentiment, which is very
strong. It is said that he is mak
ing individual appeals to Repub
licans not to permit themselves to
be carried away by sentiment and
emotion, but to stand up consist
ently for the policy which has
thus far been followed of holding
the Cuban agitation in check.
The Evening Star to-day says:
The statement may be reiterated
with confidence and positiveness
that the administration has aban
doned the theory that the Maine
was blown up by accident. It is
asserted that the board could now,
if no more testimony were taken,
show clearly that the destructive
agency was exploded from the
outside. Further investigation is
necessary, not to make this fact
more clear, but to show con
clusively, if possible, what the
external agency was, in what
manner and by whom exploded.
If the evidence of external ex
plosion is as manifest, upon in
spection, as it is believed to have
been found by the American
divers, the hope is entertained
that the Spanish divers will re
port this fact, and that the
Spanish board will acknowledge
the external explosion and the
Spanish Government at once offer
full reparation.
Unless Spain, actuated by a
false and dishonorable pride,
actually desires war or prefers
war to the humiliation of confess
ing responsibility for the disaster,
this course Â»vill be followed by
her if the Spanish divers nuke
the discoveries which it is antici
pated they will. If Spain is not
desirous of avoiding war, then it
is likely that her divers and her
Board of Inquiry will be afflicted
with official blindness, which will
prevent their seeing what was
made apparent by the American
investigation-
ITS CONDITION
DEFENSELESS
Dry Tortugas Is Now a
Positive Source of
Danger.
Could Be Occupied by an
Enemy as a Base of Naval
and Military Operations.
An Old-Style Fort and Obsolete Guns
That Could Not Withstand At
tack in Modern Warfare.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 4.
In Its preent defenseless condition, it
is pointed out, Dry Tortugas is a posi
tive source of danger, as it could be
occupied by an enemy as a base of
naval and military operations. The
most essential feature of its defense
would be the moving of guns, and with
these the harbor would give one of the
best roadsteads in southern waters.
The main defenses are on Tortugas,
meaning Turtle Island, and occupy
practically the entire island, al
though a small narrow coral reef
sweeps around it, affording additional
shelter. The fort is known as Fort Jef
ferson. It is a three-story brick struc-
ture, with casements, the walls being
four feet three inches thick. The gar
rison quarters are located in these
casements, the old plan being to place
the artillery in the upper stories and
the infantry below. The old defenses
consisted of thirty-two and forty-two
pounder guns and one or two Parrots
of 200 and 300 pounds. These four-feet
three-inch walls and old style guns
would be of little service in modern
warfare, and such as remain are prob
ably out of practical service by the
quarantine uses to which Fort Jeffer
son has been put in recent years.
It is thought, however, that the old
brick fort would serve temporary uses
as a garrison and that the surround
ings would afford a good location for
heavy guns to protect the roadstead.
The fortifications board, headed by
General Miles, some time ago reported
that the Dry Tortugas Islands were
necessary as a part of our system of
coast defenses. The naval scheme of
defense of the coast, as laid down in
the plans by the naval war college last
summer, also contemplated the Tortu
gas Islands as a base of operations,
while the board appointed by Secretary
Long to select sites for drydocks last
summer also devoted considerable
space in its report to showing the im
portance of the islands from a strategic
ably better than that off Key West, a
point of view. The anchorage is prob
fact made evident by the preference
for Tortugars harbor shown by Admi
ral Sicard during the southern ren
dezvous of the North Atlantic squad
ron now in progress.
CLAMOR IN AMERICA,
CALM IN SPAIN.
Brothers Across the Sea Too Much
Engaged in Distress at Home to

LONDON, March s.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Daily Mail says: In
contrast with the clamor in America,
there is almost absolute calm here and
that too, even on the bourses, where
the falls are due to foreign selling.
The general opinion is that the United
States dare not make the suspicion,
which is unsupported by evidence, and
is abhorred by European opinion, the
pretext for war.
The distress in various parts of the
country occupies the public mind fai
more than American relations. Not
withstanding the reduction in the grain
duty, a famine threatens. The Social
ists" are utilizing the dearth, under
guise of electioneering, as a means of
fomenting popular agitation, and it
would require some overt act on the
part of America to divert public senti
ment.

"To the Boston Journal: If it should
turn out that the Maine was de
stroyed by some cause for which the
Spanish Government could be held re

HAVANA, March 4.â Wreaths were
placed upon the graves of the dead
seamen from the Maine in Christobal
Colon Cemetery to-day, and appropri
ate services were held there. Nearly
every American now in Havana was
present, and all stood with uncovered
heads in a circle around the rude
mounds of clay while Captain Sigsbee
placed the flowers, and as they listened
to the touching prayer uttered by
Chaplain Chidwick. The demonstra
tion was spontaneous. Many Ameri
cans now about to leave Cuba could not
bring themselves to depart without first
paying a tribute to the dead heroes, and
last night the movement took definite
form when George C. Mages, a Chi
cago tourist, drew up the following me
morial:
"American citizens: Havana placed
the first wreath of flowers on the
graves of the heroes of the battle-ship
Maine. May Americans In Havana in
future years continue this custom year
by year. May they keep sacred the
memory of those whose lives were sac
rificed upon the altar of their coun-
try."
This was placed upon the desk at
the Hotel Ingleterra and was quickly
signed by all Americans in the hotel.
A procession of fifty carriages start
ed from the Ingleterra for the ceme
tery this afternoon. Consul-General
Lee and Captain Sigsbee rode in the
first carriage. In the second were
Chaplain Chidwick and a priest sent
by General Blanco. Then followed
American tourists, residents and news
paper correspondents, probably 200 in
all. Arriving at the cemetery a group
quickly formed about the graves. Cap
tain Sigsbee intended to make a short
address, but his feelings overcame him
and sobs choked his words. The situ
ation was most distressing and tears
streamed down the faces that had not
known tears before in many years.
Mr. Mages went to the relief of Cap
tain Sigsbee, and in a few words told
of the occasion of the gathering. Then
all listened while Chaplain Chidwick
in a voice breaking with emotion ut
tered the following prayer:
â¢â¢Almighty, all-merciful God, whose
providence is to have mercy and save,
we humMy beseech thee, have mercy
on the souls of thy children, that al
though their dust lies in this conse
crated spot, their souls immortal may
live and reign with thee in company of
the blessed forever. Remember, God,
they are thy creatures, made by thy
hands; that they believed and hoped
in thee. Bless, we beseech thee,- their
most fruitful faith. Look forgivingly
upon this last awful sacrifice in which
they ended their lives. Give them the
reward of their faith, fulfillment of
their hope, through Jesus Christ, our
Lord. Amen. Most merciful Father,
mindful of the passion and death of
thine only begotten Son. who offered
himself, holy holocaust upon the cross
for our salvation, grant these thy ser
vants through his sufferings forgive
ness for their sins and life everlasting.
Regard the comely figure of thy well
beloved Son. Behold his body torn and
lacerated and crucified and dead and
buried. Grant that these humiliations
and pains will not be for naught for
our beloved dead, but that they may
come into posesslon of their great re
gard, which was purchased by Christ's
precious blood. Jesus Christ, our
leader and our captain, who died to
teach us how to die. to teach us the
nothingness of death and prove life
beyond, may thy wounds be a source
of food and drink and eternal life for
our dead. May thy cross be their
glory, thy death their everlasting life,
thy resurrection their comfort and so
lace, and thy eternal presence their
abiding joy forever. Eternal rest grant
them and may the perpetual light of
the Lord shine upon them. May their
souls through the mercy of God rest in
peace. Amen."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 4.â The Herald*
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Although uncertain as to the exact dattf
when the court of inquiry investigating
the Maine disaster will submit its find
ings, the authorities are growing mors
confident that the decision will ba
against the accidental theory. Presi
dent McKinley shows his anxiety to
take hold of the Maine matter at the
earliest date possible by a dispatch,
sent to Admiral Sicard to-day by Sec
retary Long at the request of the Pres
ident, inquiring as to when the findings
of the court might reasonably be ex
pected. This reply received to-night
signed by Sicard leaves the President
still in the dark on this point: â¢
"I have talked with the President of
the court of inquiry and agree with him
that it is not yet possible to fix the dato
of the findings. Much depends on the
progress of the divers and the wrecker
and the results they obtain. Every ef
fort is being made to advance the in
quiry. The court returns to Havana
by the Mangrove this evening, having
about finished the examination at Key
West."
On the strength of the information
received at the State Department from
Consul-General Lee as to the progress
made by the divers in the absence of
the court in Key West, Assistant Sec
retary Day said yesterday that a re
port was looked for by the middle of
next week. But as it is manifestly the
purpose of the court to get every scrap
of evidence obtainable, a fortnight may
yet elapse before the final conclusions
are received in Washington. The re
port that the stenographer of the court
was on his way to Washington from
Key West cannot be confirmed here.
The possibilities of a complication
growing out of the Maine disaster are
thought here to be somewhat enhanced
by the probability, as indicated in the
dispatches to the Herald this morning,
that the report of the Spanish court of
inquiry would be diametrically opposed
to that of the report of the American
court. It has been realized all along
that if a hitch occurred it would be
over the refusal of Spain to meet our
demands for an indemnity. With a re
port from the Spanish court of inquiry
showing that an accident caused the
disaster and a report from the United
States court showing that it could not
have been caused by accident, it is
appreciated that it w r ould be difficult
for the Governments to arrive at an
amicable settlement. It rpay be ac
cepted as a foregone conclusion that
the administration will stand by the
verdict of the court of inquiry, what
ever it may be, regardless of any deci
sion reached by the Spanish officials.
It is equally certain that if our naval
court finds an explosion from the out
side caused the destruction of th^
Maine, demands will be made upoi^
Spain for an indemnity. If Spain should
undertake to exonerate herself by en
deavoring to produce the real culprit,
or if she disavowed ail knowledge of
the affair with the suggestion of in
demnity, this administration would be
willing to grant her reasonable time.
It can be stated, however, that if
Spain suggests that the examination
made by our officials is an ex parte one
and they have reached a verdict of de
liberate explosion in order to shield
their own alleged laxity of discipline
and carelessness, it will dangerously
strain the relations between the two
countries. Upon the court's decision the
whole question hinges. Its verdict will
be accepted by the people of the United
States. If they say that the ship was
blown up by an accident there may
be still a lingering doubt in the minds
of some, but there will be no official or
popular protest. The incident will be
considered as closed. If, on the other
hand, they conclude that the ship was
not destroyed by design, the American
people will expect Spain to acquiesce
in that decision. If she does not there
is likely to be trouble.

From Juneau.
Si>*<-ial Dispatch to The Call.
JT'NEAU. Alaska. March 1 (by
steamship City of Seattle, via Victoria,
B. C, Ma-eh 4).â Another searching
party which went to the scene of the
awful wreck of the Clara Nevada has
returned without results. As previous
ly predicted, it Is now certain beyond
the possibility of hope that not a soul
survived this, the worst disaster of the
Klondike rush.
Attorney A. M. Reed of Portland,
Or., arrived here last Thursday to
make as thorough an investigation as
possible In the interest of insurance
companies and also to look for bodies.
He chartered the small steamer Rust
ler, which carried the previous search
ing expedition, and after nearly three
days spent in the vicinity of the wreck
returned without a word to add to the
information already known. Not a
corpse was found. It is the rule that
bodies of people drowned in Alaska
seas are never recovered. Once
drowned they never rise to the surface.
It is impossible to tell into what sub
terranean caverns the deep undertow
and currents carry them; and then the
waters are filled with sharks, which
swim in both depths and shallows.
The wreck is still on the reef on
Fldredge Point and is rapidly break
ing up. The sides are going to pieces
and part of the main deck is gone. In
the next hard blow all of the wreckage
will disappear.
It is now known that a New York
party, which was returning to Seattle
to advise friends by wire which of the
Lynn Canal passes to take to the Yu
kon, was aboard, but as usual names
are wanting:. . The life insurance com
panÂ»eÂ«.,are In luck, .because it will be
hardly possible to prove who the dead
are. Hundreds of Klondlkers have ta
ken out some kind of an insurance pol
icy. Life and accident insurance agents
are aboard many of the larger steam
ships bound north.
This morning at 6 o'clock. In a denae
fog, the well-known wrecker. White
law, went ashore on the Sheep Creek
sand spit, about ten miles below Ju
neau. She had a narrow escape from
destruction, and is not safe yet. A
heavy sea was running. The sand spit,
instead of a reef of rocks, is the White
law's salvation if she is pulled off to
night at extreme high tide. The
weather is unusually clear to-day, and
she can be seen from the Juneau docks
well in shore, with a bad list to port.
The ship was noticed early this morn
ing from the Treadwell Mines.
There being no small boat at Juneau
to-day which could be chartered for a
short trip, the identity of the stranded
ship was not known till late this aft
ernoon. At that time the Douglas Isl
and ferry brought over several pas
sengers who had left the ship and made
the island in a email boat. They told
Captain Yorke of the ferry that the
Whitelaw was not considered in a pre
carious position unless a high wind
rises so as to blow her harder on the
shore. She is right in the path of
winds, than which there are no harder
In Alaskaâ -near Taku Inlet. The Taku
winds are known and feared by every
old Alaska sea captain. Captain Car
roll once said that they would blow the
buttons off a man's duster, but as high
tide Is coming on at this writing (5
p. m.) and there is no wind it is prob
able that the Whitelaw will not be
compelled to assist at the wrecking of
herself, but may live to reap salvage
from other wrecks as well known as
til* Columbia *.% Pigeon Point, the St.
Paul in Monterey Bay and the collier
San Benito at Point Arena.
The passengers are not . mtr.y and
' were not greatly alarmed. Ths cap
tain of the Whitelaw thinks he can
draw her off himself at high tide.
The Whitelaw is bound from San
Francisco and Seattle with a heavy
Klondike cargo for Dyea and Skaguay.
Last week as she was coming into Ju
â  .neau channel during a hard blow the
steamship Oregon was lifted bodily by
wind and sea and deposited on the
sloping shore of Douglas Island. She
got off next day without serious in
jury. The bark Canada was also
ashore at Skaguay, but was saved by
the little steamship Coleman.
John Housted, a passenger aboard
the Whitelaw, told me to-night that
the passengers on the Whitelaw, fear

signed a petition asking Captain Lock
, tic-re to put into Seattle, Port Town
send or Port Angeles for a pilot and
take the inside passage.
He said there was much confusion
among the crew aboard the ship on the
trip up; that the water barrels were
. left open, and the sea. coming aboard
. off Cape Flattery spoiled the water. A
pilot was taken aboard at Port An
gele*. . .
In coming through Wrangel Nar
rows yesterday morning with the ship
drawing only thirteen feet of water
and the buoys in plain sight, the ship
ran aground and tore off her shoe. She
drfw off successfully, but on the voy
aere up she lay over every night in
safe waters.
The Whitelaw left San Francisco on
February I" with 144 people aboard,
including: the crew. Housted, who is
a Scotch sailor bound for the Klon
dike, said that instead of trying to
make headway this morning in the fog
the ship should have hove to until the
weather cleared. The Whltelaw was
several miles out of her course. She
should have been close to Douglas
"Island, whereas she was over on the
main 'and side, whence projected the
sand spit. Housted said it was lucky
for the ship that she ran on sand in-
Kt'ead of rocks. He thinks there is no
doubt that she can draw off all right.
At 10 o'clock to-night the wind be
gan to rise and the Whitelaw had not
yet appeared in port.

BRAVES GREAT
DANGERS FOR
HIS FAIR BRIDE
In the Presence of firmed F r i er >ds
a Young Man Is Married to a
Wealthy Widow.
NEW YORK, March 4.â An Augusta CGq.) special to the Herald
says: Mrs. S. A. Groves, a wealthy and prominent widow of Lincoln
ton. was married in this city at C o'clock this evening to K. L. Smith,
a young business man of that town. The ceremony was performed in
the presence of an armed guard, who arrived with Smith this after
noon to prevent threatened violence from Coleman Groves, son of the
bride, and Dr. J. W. Caldweil, another member of the Groves family.
The bride was too weak from prostration resulting from the excite
ment of the past few days to stand, and remained in her chair as the
marriaue ritual was read.
The marriage is a sequel to one of the most sensational horsewhlp
plngs in Georgia history. On the 27th of February Smith was attacked
in the road near their homes in Lincolnton by Dr. Caldweil and Cole
man Groves. He was taken from his buggy and his clothes stripped
from his shoulders. He was then given forty lashes on his bare back
with a buggy whip. The lash was used by Dr. Caldweil. The whipping
was administered, it is alleged, because of Smith's attentions to Mrs.
Groves, and when he was restored, half dazed from the blood shed and
pain, he was commanded to not again show his presence in the Groves
home. This warning he ignored, and finally Mrs. Groves came to the
city. Expecting that an elopennent was contemplated, her son and Dr.
Caldweil. armed to the teeth, followed, and young Groves declared
here openly to-day that if Smith made an attempt to marry his mother
he would kill him. Smith, however, braved the danger, but a party of
friends, armed far an emergency, accompanied him here. They arrived
at 5 o'clock this afternoon, and repaired immediately to thehotel, where
Mrs. Groves is stopping, and the marriage ceremony was quickly per
formed. Young Groves and Dr. Caldweil rushed to the scene, but found
themselves greatly outnumbered, and desisted from any attempt at vio
lence. It is feared, however, that bloodshed will follow. On account of
Mrs. Groves' nervous physical condition her friends tried to dissuade
her from marrying this afternoon, but she would not listen to the propo
sition. The parties stand high socially at their homes.

out as Peters said, "As an evidence

one of the "pup" gulches running into

was plenty of food in Dawson, and that j
if the Canadian police regulation re- j
quiring every person going into .
the Klondike to have at least j
1000 pounds of provisions was contin
ued in force there was not likely to be
another food shortage in Dawson. He
said that many men in Dawson had \
staked too much ground and in order
to work it. as required by law, they
must either sell it, let friends in on the
location, or dispose of it on shares, as
it is impossible to work it all them
selves. This would give other people j
who have no locations a chance.
No new strikes further than previous- ;
ly reported have been made. Peters did
not think the number of sleds on the
trail behind this season would exceed
three or four, as miners living in Daw- :
son would go down the river when
the ice broke instead of poling up.

For three days the weather at the !
head of Lynn Canal and at Juneau has ,
been exceptionally clear and beautiful.
Klondikers at Dyea, Skaguay and
Sheep Camp took immediate advantage \
of it. They have been swooping over ;
the summits in swarms, being so thick
as to appear from the altitude of the

The already large crowds at Lake Lin
derman and at Lake Bennett have
doubled. Thousands are still on tKe â 
tidewater waiting to get over with
their outfits.
Much sickness prevails at Skaguay. :
There are one, two or three deaths each |
day, mostly from an affliction said to i
resemble spinal meningitis. The cause i
of the sickness is not positively known, |
but it is said to be the drinking water.
The sanitary condition of Skaguay is j
not the best, and when warm weather !
comes the discarded refuse of the win
ter, now frozen, will make it more se
rious. Crowds are still coming as fast
as ships can carry them.

REDWOOD CITY, March 4.â James
Wilett, the accomplice of Moore, alias
Raymond, and Winters in the murder
of C. A. Andrews at Baden in Novem
ber last, is waiting to hear from rela
tives he claims to have in Texas before
making any further statements con
cerning his participation in the crime.
He was in a joyful mood all day, chat
ting pleasantly with his fellow prison
ers and cracking Jokes with the guards.
"I would just as leave suing on the i
end of a rope as go back to Folsom,"
he said. "Perhaps I will swing any
way. It makes no difference. I have !
found in my experience that I have to j
pay the State for nearly all the tricks
I ever turned, and I guess I have not
paid all my debts yet."
He asked several times If a reply to
the telegram he sent to an uncle in
Texas had been received. From the
tone of his inquiries his guards are of
the opinion that he expects help from
them to get him out of the present
predicament. During the day he hinted
at several crimes he had committed,
and for which he never was fcuspected.
For those crimes, he said, he should
have spent twice his lifetime in prison,
and the sentences he had already
served were for crimes in which he was
but slightly implicated.
Raymond and Winters, he said, were
his accomplices in most of his recent
crimes. The three worked for several
days in the vicinity of the Emmanuel
Baptist Church in San Francisco and
held up more than one person. They
robbed one man in front of the '
church early in November. All
they got from him was $20. The
man pleaded for the return of
a dollar or two of it, but it was
not given him. On that occasion one
of the robbers lost his mask. It was
afterward found tincl the police of San
Francisco are holding it as evidence
against the robbers when they catch
them. Wilett said with a laugh when
he finished the story:
"The robbers are caught."
The prisoner denies havlnp any
knowledge of any person serving a
sentence at San Quentln Prison for a
crime he had committed.
"All the crimes I ever committed I
paid for, with perhaps a few excep
tions. No one that I know of is doing
time for my tricks."
Sheriff Mansfield believes that If
Wilett does not hear favorably from
the relatives he claims to have in
Texas he will admit his guilt In the
Baden murder and tell of all the other
crimes of his checkered career. Wil
ett Is fond of boasting of the acts of
his criminal life, and when he finds
that he cannot hope to esape a life sen

GILROY. March 4.â Thomas Nlhill. a
farmer residing near Gilroy, had a quar
rel with his wife's cousin, Phil Kelley,
last evening, and as a result is occupying
a cell in the Town Jail, while Kelley is
lying dangerously wounded at the City
Hall. The altercation occurred at the
Nihill ranch, and was the outcome of a
family feud. Nihill's wife is suing him
for a divorce and the case was to have
come up to-day in the Superior Court of
Santa Clara County.
Nihill claims that Kelley made the first
attack, while Kelley says that Nihill
opened hostilities. It was a bloody bat
tle and lasted a half hour, the men wrest
ling and chasing each othor from house
to house and over the ranch. Both had
knives and Kelley struck Nihill in the
head with a spade.
Kelley had twenty-four cuts in different
parts of his body, and his clothes were
saturated with blood. The doctors took
aeventy-two stitches, and hÂ© Is one masÃ
of cotton batting and plasters. Nihill
was cut on the arm and also on the
Nlhtll claims that his wife was the
primary cause of the battle. The two had
divided the community property and lived
in separate houses. Kelley was stopping
at Mrs. NihiU's house during her absentee

SALINAS, March 4.â Mrs. Abbott, relict of the late George Abbott,
died early this morning from grieving over the death of her husband.
Mrs. Abbott buried her husband only four days ago. She was so mu,ch
affected by his death that she never recovered from the shock.
Sickness is not attributed as the cause of Mrs. Abbott's death. She
was generally very healthy. Without doubt the grief over the loss of
her husband killed her.
Mrs. Abbott was 76 years of age and was a native of Canada. She
married Mr. Abbott in 1844, and was one of the early pioneers in the val

social and business relations and of ex
posing him to public hatred and contempt,
wrongfully, unlawfully and maliciously
conspire, combine, confederate and agree
together to falsely charge and accuse
plaintiff with the crime of grand larceny, a

knowing there was no case or ground
or reason to believe a crime had been
committed he "wrongfully, corruptly and
maliciously and in violation of his oath

PORTLAND, March 4.â The Snow and
Ice Transportation Company, which pur

ice locomotives, in spite of the abandon
ment of the Government expedition, to
day gave up the struggle. It has stored
its machinery in Portland, settled with
holders of its tickets and retired as grace
fully as possiole.
It was generally understood when the
Government expedition was declared off I
that the Snow and Ice people, who had
organized on the strength of a Govern
ment contract for transporting relief ;
supplies, would drop their project. But
Manager Rosenfeld thought differently !
until, on consultation with his Eastern !
associates, he decided that discretion was
the better part of valor.
Every difficulty that could be imagined I
has confronted Rosenfeld at every step, I
but he, nevertheless, persisted. He as- !
sembled his plant of locomotives and I
sleds at Portland, chartered the steam- '
ship National City to carry his passengers j
and sold tickets by dozens throughout the
East at $300 apiece. One thing after an- I
other hampered and delayed him, how
ever, until now the Government has
backed, down, and he could hardly hope!
to go forward on his own resources, which
are said to be limited. It is whispered
that a part of Rosenfeld's present scheme
is a suit against the Government for
breach of contract.

HANFORD, March 4.â The success of
the raisin-seeding machinery and plant

The Hanford Farmers' Club and the
Chamber of Commerce have for some
time been endeavoring to secure a seedl
ing plant here, and have abundant capi
tal. The successful machine owned by
the Fresno syndicate will not be manu
factured or sold to outside persons. Han
ford men are in correspondence with a
New York company having a seeder
claimed to be practical. Kings County
raisin men are not satisfied to send their
raisins to Fresno if capital and inventions
can circumvent the Fresno raisin-seeding
syndicate. The expected raisin product
in this county for 1398 is 15.000,000 pounds,
a large portion of which will have to be
seeded, even if snipped to Fresno.

message of February 7 regarding the
question pending as being of very serious
moment, this Government deems fit to
Inform you that they are of the belief
that all peaceable means have not yet

indispensable that the Diet employ all
diplomatic means to avert a war which
would cast a stain on the good name
which Central America yet enjoys among
other civilized nations. For this reason,
as also to preserve the peace in these
countries at all hazard, in the name of
the Salvadorean people and sacred In
terests of the Central American isthmus,
the Government of Salvador asks the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March 4.â Each succeed
ing day sees greater difficulties in the
way of the "gang" in the matter of
finding candidates to make the race
against the invulnerable ticket placed
in the field by the New Charter Club.
So pressed are the "gang" manipulators
now for suitable material that their or
gan this morning printed an editorial
appeal to "business men" to consent to
serving the public in the present cam
paign. As the result of this move it is
probable there will be a "gang business
men's" ticket in the fieldâ that is, if
enough reputable and honest men can
be deluded by the "gang" into being
drawn into a content wherein their
chances of success will be exceedingly
slim. Several men who are beyond re
proach in the abstract have already
been led into the political fold, which
promises to be converted to a shambles
on the 11th of April. While there is
nothing against these men personally,
their affiliations with the "gang" or
prominent "whips" of the "push" are
such that their independence cannot be
counted upon after they are elected.
The "gang" will make its campaign
against the New Charter Club by get
ting behind certain men which it will
select from the large number of inde
pendent candidates who are being
tempted into the fight by the facility
with which they can become candidates
and have their names printed on the
ballots. Whatever men may be elect
ed, by some unexpected chance, outside
of the regular nominees of the New
Charter Club, will be claimed body and
soul after the election by the "gang."
But the best people of this city are
fully aware that the issue in the forth
coming election is a clear and simple
one â on one side the ticket of the New
Charter Club, pledged to good and eco
nomical government; on the other all
candidates who must necessarily be op
posed to the New Charte* Club ticket
either in the interest of the "gang" or
their own self-advancement at the ex
pense of the general public welfare.
Up to date sixteen petitions have been
filed with the city clerk. Only one â
that of Adam Riehlâ is for a New Char
ter Club candidate. There are twenty
two officers to be elected in all, and the
number of candidates promises to be

WIFE-BEATER'S
NARROW ESCAPE
Rancher Groves Threat
ened by a Mob at
Stockton.
Hurried to Jail While Cries of
"Lynch Him!" Fill
the Air.
The Culprit Sentenced to a Hundred
and Fifty Days' Impris
onment.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, March 4.â The conclu
sion of the Groves horsewhipping case
was most sensational, and had there
been more spectators present it might
have developed Into mob violence.
Groves, the man who cut his wife's
cheek open with a blacksnake near
French Camp a few days ago, had
pleaded guilty yesterday, and came up
for sentence this afternoon. The
courtroom was crowded at the appoint
ed time. Attorney Clary arose to plead
mitigating circumstances. He went
back into ancient history, and told how-
Socrates had to chastise his wife to
make her behave, and how women oft
en needed admonishing, as the common
law used to allow a man the privilege
of whipping his better half. He said
that Groves' wife had irritated her hus
band, and offered other inducements
for a light sentence.
In his decision Justice Rendon said:
"The cut of the blacksnake on the
â¢woman's cheek shows It to have burnt
the flesh for several Inches. It is hard
to conceive of a battery more aggra
vated than this one. The court tte
lieves that if a fine were imposed the
defendant would pay It, and, therefore,
not suffer punishment. A fine would
not pay in penalty for the suffering in
flicted on this poor woman. A man
who happens to possess means should
not escape punishment thereby. This
offense has shocked the community. It
Is an Insult to civilization. It is bar
baric In the extreme."
Groves was then sentenced to impris
onment for 150 days, with no alterna
tive. There was a general murmur ot
approval in the courtroom. Justice
Rendon pushed a little button behind
his bench, and Bailiff Klench entered
and took charge of the prisoner. By
this time considerable feeling had de
veloped. The crowd followed Groves to
the north exit of the courthouse and
filled the corridors. Some one cried:
"Lynch him!" Then there was a shout,
and another man cried: "Yes, hang
him!"
Bailiff Klench took his man out of tne
way as soon as possible, but the crowc
blocked the doorway and made threats.
A friend of Groves, who dared to say
that the rancher had acted the man all
the way through, was met with ehouta
of derision.
There are those who still express
sympathy for Groves. It is said that
on the day he whipped his wife she had
deliberately turned the cows in on his
wheat field, hoping, it is said, that when
the wheat was destroyed he would con
sent to move to the city.
WOODLAND BUSINESS
BLOCK DESTROYED.
Fifteen Thousand Dollar Blaze in the
Yolo County Me
tropolis.
WOODLAND, March 4.â Fire at Dunni
gan at an early hour this morning de
stroyed P. T. Laugenour's store building
and S. Rummelsburg's stock of mer
chandise. Mose Rummelsburg. a brother
of The proprietor and a clerk in the estab
lishment, has been accustomed to sleep
in a small room in the store. About 2
o'clock this morning he awoke and dis
covered that his room was full of smoke.
He ran out and sounded an alarm. The
response of all the residents of the town
was prompt, but in a few minutes the
whole building was enveloped in names
and all efforts to save the contents were
practically unavailing.
The heat was so intense that other
buildings in the vicinity wore in peril fur
gome time. The wind was in the north,
but it was very light, otherwise the de
struction would have been greater. W. S.
Allen's drug store on the east side, the
brick hall owned by D. Levy on the west
and the hotel building were threatened
and were saved only by the hardest kind
of work.
The Laugenour store was a long, single
frame building, 1R0X42 feet, with one story
above the basement. In the center of the
store was a large dead-air vault, which
contained the books and papers, all of
which were saved. The fire evidently
started in the basement, but Mr. Rum
melsburg has not yet been able to account
for its origin. The building itself was dry
and inflammable and much of its con
tents was of a combustible character
which accounts for the rapidity with
which the flames spread. The building
was worth between $4000 and $5000 and was
probably partially insured. Mr. Rum
melsburg's lo.ss amounts to about $12 000
He holds insurance upon it for $9000.
EXPLORING EXPEDITIONS.
Government to Send Three Military
Parties to Alaska.
NEW YORK, March 4.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: As the
result of the conference to-day between
Secretary Alger, Assistant Secretary
Meiklejohn and Major-General Miles,
it was decided to give into the hands of
Brigadier-General Merriam, com
manding the Department of the Colum
bia, the direction of three small ex
ploring expeditions into Alaska. The
personnel of exploring parties may be
taken from officers and troops already
in Alaska, or from thosn now stationed
in the Department of the Columbia.
One of the expeditions will explore
the country in the vicinity of Forty
mile Creek and Tanana Valley; an
other will go into the interior via Cop
per River, and the third will explore
the valley of the Shuskitna River. The
object of the expeditions will be to con
ciliate and pacify Alaskan Indians, to

vantageous sites for military stations
and camps.

FIGHT DESPITE
THE GOVERNOR
Kid McCoy Meets and
Defeats Burley of
California.
Contest Pulled Off Quietly, to
the Discomfiture of
Officials.
Arkansas' Executive Outwitted by
Sporting Managers at Hot
Springs.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HOT SPRINGS. Ark.. March 4.â
"Kid" McCoy, champion middle- weight
pugilist of the world, met and defeat
ed Nick Burley of California in the
arena at Whlttlngton Park to-day.
The Californian was knocked out in
the second round. The fight was the
most exciting and interesting ever wit
nessed in this city. The fact that it
was pulled off in direct disregard of
the Governor's instructions increased
the general interest in the contest. The
large attendance (2000) surprised
everybody, in view of the fact that it
was declared off to-day, and, conse
quently, the public had only a few
hours' notice this morning, by means
of handbills and streamers on the
street cars.
Though the promoters were busily
engaged In arranging the affair yes
terday afternoon, their work was done
so quietly that no one knew the fight
would take place until a late hour last
night, and then only a very few were
advised, McCoy having advertised
yesterday to give an exhibition to
night at the opera-house. This ruse
worked like a charm, so far as the
local authorities were concerned, and
no one was on hand to interfere.
Prosecuting Attorney Cloud, who had
been ordered here by the Governor
from Benton to stop the contest, re
turned yesterday, after having satis
fied himself that it would not take
place. The Sheriff failed to put in an
appearance until the fight was over.
He was busy at the telegraph office
arranging matters with the Governor
during the progress of the fight. The
Governor wired to him that he had
been informed it would take place to
day In disregard of his instructions,
and if in his (the Sheriff's) judgment
it was a prize-fight he should stop it
at all hazards and arrest all interested
persons.
As yet no arrests have been made,
and none are likely to be made. Gov
ernor Jones wired to the officials of the
Hot Springs Railroad to hold the
train at Malvern. so that he could
reach the city on a special train, but
his instructions were either ignored or
miscarried, and he did not get here.
A description of the fight by rounds
follows:

ed lightly on Burley's jaw. Burley led

train this evening for parts unknown
to avoid unpleasant complications and
possible trouble with the State author
ities on account of his having taken
part in a prize fight he%e to-day. Bur
ley is preparing to leave on the first
train.

SAYS CHAIRMAN JONES
SHALLJJOT DICTATE.
Congressman Bailey Denounces At
tempts to Interfere in
Utah Politics.
OGDEX, March 4.â A special to the
Standard from Washington to-day is as
follows: Congresman Bailey to-day said
it was an outrage for the national com
mittee to interfere in the election of a
Senator from Utah. He said they would
not permit the national committee to in
terfere in Texas, and emphatically object
ed to Texas or any other State interfering
in I'tah elections. One of the great prin
ciples of Democracy was home rule, and
that included Congressmen and Senators
as well as constables. If t'tah submitted
to the dictation of Chairman Jones, said
he, and the national committee, then
there was no home rule, no Democracy.
This declaration is considered a hard
blow to the aspirations of Senator Can
non, as it was supposed here that the
leading silver Democrats would join in an
effort to re-elect him.

cluding: "As at the dawn of our resur
rection, all classes of citizens were
welded together to secure the country's
freedom, so to-day they are united and
mutally aiding one another. The in
dissoluble union of my house with the
destinies of the people, based on con
cord of ideas and strengthened by its
past misfortunes and glories, will be
the most secure bulwark of the Italian
fatherland."

cony in response to the cheering of the

DOYLE TALKS
UNWILLINGLY
Flannelly's Former Part-
ner on the Witness
Stand.
He It Was Over Whom Father
and Son Had Quarreled
Bitterly.
Says the Parricide Was Not Excited
When He Went to Slay the
Old Man.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March 4.â ln the Flan
nelly murder trial to-day but two wit
nesses were examined. The first was
Daniel H. Doyle, who vas in partner
ship with Flannelly in the dairy busi
ness and who was the prims cause of
the tragedy. Doyle did not prove a
willing witness for the prosecution, his
testimony simply showing that Flan
nelly took his pistol with him when he
left the milk ranch for the purpose of
calling on his father, and that he was
angry when the constable served the
papers of ejectment.
Doyle said he was 23 years of age
and a bookbinder by occupation. He
went into the dairy business with Flan
nelly some time in September, and he
continued as a partner for about three
weeks. He lived with the defendant at
the dairy ranch, which consisted of
eight or nine acres. On October 13
Flannelly had been served with a paper
by Constable Barton. It notified Tom
that more rent would have to be paid
or the ranch vacated.
On the evening of the crime, October
28, he was at the ranch when Constable
Barton served papers on Fiannelly. The
(.â¢unstable came about 8 o'clock, when
they were at supper. "When the officer
knocked Flannelly went to the door.
The witness could not haar what oc
curred out of doors, but Flannelly
finally called the witness out and he
was served with the papers. According
to Doyle Flannelly did not seem ex
cited, but invited the constable in to
take a cup of tea. The officer declined
the invitation and returned to town.
"After supper," said the witness, "we
talked the matter over. Flannelly
said he would see what his father had
to say about the papers that had been
served. He saddled his horse and
started to see his father. Before doing
so he said he had his pistol with him.
Flannelly did not appear angry when
he left. He generally carried his pis
tol at night."
The witness said Flannelly told him
that his father did not want him
(Doyle) on the place, and he then pro
posed to get out to avoid trouble be
tween Tom and his family. Flannelly
agreed to Doyle leaving, and looked
around for a man to take his place.
Doyle said Flannelly did not wish to do
anything against his father's wishes.
Doyle said Flannelly was sober and
industrious and always attended to
business while thÂ£y were together on
the ranch. On the evening of October
26 he was sober, and cooked the sup
per as usual. According to the witness.
Flannelly was angry at the Constable
and not at his father, and his business
in going to his; father w-as to explain
that there hal been no necessity for
serving the papers, as he had already
informed his father that the partner
ship no longer existed. Flannelly
senior thought Doyle's presence on the
place decreased the value of the prop
erty.
Dr. James Crowe, Coroner of San Ma
teo County, was the next witness. He
arrived at the house shortly after the
murder. Ho made an examination of
the room, ami under the top mattress
found a revolver. All the chambers of
the revolvt-r wore loaded, and the
weapon had not been fired. There was
no blood on the pistol. Several persons
were In the room when he found it.

CONSTRUCTION OF THE
BIG GEORGE WASHINGTON.
Navy Department Officials Say It
Would Require an Enormous
Cost to Build the Vessel.
WASHINGTON. March 4.â Senator
Hale has received from Secretary Long
a reply to the letter recently sent by
him as chairman of the Committee on
Naval Affairs requesting the Secre
tary's opinion upon the resolution in
troduced on Washington's birthday by
Senator Morgan instructing the com
mittee to ascertain the feasibility of
constructing and equipping a
year's time a warship to be called the
George Washington, and to be "equal
at least to any in the world."
The Secretary incloses a report made
by Chief O'Neil of the Bureau of Ord
nance and a joint report Dy Chief Hich
born of the Bureau of Construction and
Chief Melville of the Bureau of Engi
neering. O'Neil places the cost of the
armor of such a vessel, built under
such a pressure, at $2,000,000, and of the
ordnance at $1,000,000, while he says
that if the construction were extended
over a period of two years' time the
cost of ordnance could be reduced to
$900,000 and of armor to $1,600,000.
He says that his bureau could do the
work of armoring and equipping such
a vessel within a year's time, but to do
so it would have to have adequate
funds placed at, its disposal. He adds
that the accomplishment would neces
sitate constant work, day and night.
He thinks two years the briefest period
in which the work could be economi
cally done. Chiefs Hichborn and Mel
ville unite in the following expression
of opinion:
"We do not believe it feasible to con
struct such a ship as contemplated, to
be completed ready for service within
a year by use of the facilities named.
It might be possible by the most stren
uous exertions to accomplish this feat
in eighteen months at an enormous
cost, probably between eight and nine
million dollars total cost."
Secretary Long says that in view of
these reports the department concludes
that it is not practicable to construct
the ship contemplated in the time speci
fied.
TWO APPROPRIATION BILLS
Finally Passed by the House and
Sent to the President.
WASHINGTON, March 4.â Two more
appropriation bills were sent to the Presi
dent to-day, the pension bill and the con
sular and diplomatic, both of which went
through their final stage in the House to
day. This was private bill day. The most
important action taken was acquiescence
in an agreement to make the bill appro
priating about $1,200,000 for war claims ap
proved by the Court of Claims under the
provision of the Bowman act. a special
order for next Friday. The claims car
ried by the bill. 730 in number, are for
stores and supplies seized during the war
in the Southern States.
Only two hills wore passed to-day. The
House adjourned over until Monday.

A Rumor That the Wnr Will
Spread to Freight Startles
the Street.
CHICAGO, March 4.â The Western roads
were in session to-day considering the
troubles with the Canadian Pacific. The
question before the meeting to-day was
the manner of meeting a reduction of $10
in the price of tickets to the Pacific
Coast which It was reported that the Ca
nadian Pacific would make in the near
future. ; " - : -, i; i.v!
The meeting to-day lasted far into the
night, but nothing had been done up to a
late hour.
The old trouble of scarcity of cars Is
worrying the traffic officials of the roads
running east of Chicago and o som ex
ten the Western roads as well. The trou
ble seems to be that the traffic is so
heavy in both directions that the roads
are having very few empty cars, and
when a car arrives at Its destination it Is
generally held for a return load instead
of being returned promptly. Both the
Eastern and Western roads are at the
pies. tit time badly crippled for lack of
cars. 11 _! 1
Notwithstanding the complaints of mer
chants, who blame the attitude of the
Southern Pacific for driving trade away
from San Francisco to Puget Sound cities,
and the fuming and fretting of railroad
men who hardly know where they stand
or what will happen next and who long
to see the nig transcontinental line take a
hand in the fight in hopes that it will
force the Canadian Pacific to come to
terms, Vice-President Stubbs continues to
sit with one leg over the other and puff
his perfeeto with the same nochalance
that has always characterized him, while
he keeps the rates on his road right up
to the regular old $66 50 mark.
He is determined to keep the war out
of San Francisco, so he says, and, from
the look of things, it seems as though he
will succeed.
"I know of nothing new In the situa
tion." said Mr. Stubbs, when seen in his
office yesterday, "except that I hear the
Colorado roads are protesting against
the proposed reduction of the Rio Grande
Western on their through travel via Og
den and Huntington, claiming that it
will have a tendency to demoralize their
business. The reduction, I expect, will
be made, however. ;is booh as the com
pany decides whether it will make it in
the nature of a flat rate or rebates on the
regular rate. Further than this I have
heard nothing new and everything seems
to be about the same."
The latest rumor along the street i 3 to
the effect that the war may spread from
traffic to freight rates. Should this occur,
it will tend to absolutely demoralize the
whole railroad business, and the effect
will be much more injurious and longer
felt by the different roads, though it will
bo a godsend to the shippers. The rumor,
however, is as yet only of the vaguest
sort, and will, in all probability, result in
nothing more than idle speculation, as one
road Is as much interested as another in
preventing its materialization.
As things now stand in the city, the
Canadian Pacific is the only road openly
advertising through rates from here,
though the other lines are selling as many
tickets as possible to their northern ter
minals and giving full explanations of the
cut rates in operation, accompanied by
letters of introduction to their connec
tions in Seattle and Portland. Which
manner of conducting business practically
amounts to the same thing as selling
through tickets at cut rates right here.
WRATH OF AN EDITOB.
Disclaims Responsibility for the
Story of an Epidemic.
VICTORIA, March 4.â The steamship
City of Seattle, which arrived here
from the north to-night, brings the fol
lowing extraordinary letter from the
editor of the Searchlight, dated from
Skaguay:
Based upon some information the source
of which is unknown to me the Alaskan
Searchlight, in Its last issue, published
;in article about a terrible plague exist
ing- here, which is untrue in every par
ticular. There Is no plapue at Skaguay,
nor has there been. During the last six
months, according to the most reliable
information obtainable, there have not
been more than twenty deaths in town,
and these have not been of an unusual
character. The people of Skaguay are
well and prosperous. The White Pass
is a success beyond all question. Thou
sands are going over it to the gold fields
of Klondike.
I regret that during my absence from
Juneau the editor pro torn, should have
been so imposed upon as to publish such
an article and feel it must have been
something more than a mistake; that it
must have emanated from some source
inimical to the interests of Skaguay; that
some person has taken nn unfair advan
tage of my absence in getting my paper
to publish an article, maliciously false,
for the purpose of injuring Skaguay and
booming some other town. To prevent
such an occurrence ever happening again
not another issue of the Searchlight will
be published in Juneau. The paper will be
removed here at once where it will be un
der my personal management. Respect
fully, E. O. SYLVESTER.

MARTIN'S TRIAL
NEAR ITS END
Closing Arguments Will
Begin To - Day at
Wilkesbarre.
Defense Hopes by Means of
Technicalities to Escape
Conviction.
Helies Upon a Failure to Prove
Each Individual Defendant a
Miarderer.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WILKESBARRE, Pa., March 4.â The
defense in the case of Sheriff Martin
and his deputies closed finally at 11
o'clock to-day, after recalling some of
the commonwealth's witnesses to as
certain whether, at the preliminary
hearing last September, they testified
that at the meeting of the strikers at
Harwood on the night before the shoot
ing they all agreed not to carry clubs
or weapons of any kind.
The commonwealth was given a short
time to prepare its plan of rebuttal tes
timony. The commonwealth closed its
case at 3 o'clock this afternoon, after
hearing a few witnesses in rebuttai on
important points, lor most of the testi
mony it hoped to thus get before the
jury was ruled out by the court.
The defense submitted a number of
points for the consideration of the court
to prove that the Sheriff had only been
doing his duty, and stating that there
had been no evidence submitted to war
rant a finding that the defendants were
an unlawful assemblage. The further
point was made that it appeared from
the evidence substantially without dis
pute that the prisoners were lawfully
aiding the Sheriff as a posse, duly ap
pointed, at the time MiKe C'eslake was
killed, and that their purpose was to
disperse an unlawful assemblage, of
which the deceased was one; that there
was no conspiracy among them to do an
unlawful act, or to do a lawful act in
an unlawful way. Therefore, the act
of one could not be imputed to the oth
ers. Each one was to be held account
able only for what he himself did. The
evidence failing to identify the yerson
who shot Mike Ceslake, there could be
no cc-nviction under the indictment.
Judge Woodward took the point un
der advisement, and will pass upon it
later. Arguments will begin to-mor
row.
HI NTON TAKE
STANTO'S PLACE
Appointed Railroad Commis
sioner for the Second
District.
Lively Scramble Among Aspirants
for the County Office Which
He Will Vacate.
Special Dispatch *^ The Call.
SACRAMENTO, March 4. â Governor
Budd this afternoon appointed William
M. Hinton of San Francisco Railroad
Commissioner for the Second District,
vice J. I. Stanton, deceased.
Mr. Hinton stated at a late hour last
night that while he had not been of
ficially notified of his appointment, he
expected to receive his commission
either Monday or Tuesday. He added
that he did not know who would suc
ceed him as Registrar of Votes of this
county.
The fact that Hinton would succeed
the late Dr. James I. Stanton In the
Board of Railroad Commissioners was
exclusively published in The Call on
February 25.
There are quite a number of aspir
ants for the position of Registrar, made
vacant by the appointment of Hinton.
Harry I. Mulcreavy, at present chief
deputy of the Registrar's office, is in
the fight for the place. Peter W. Mc-
Glade, who ran for Clerk of the Su
preme Court at the last general elec
tion and who is now employed as a
deput- in the office of Street Superin
tendent Ambrose, is also in the race.
Charles Gildea, ex-Assemblyman and
forr*-~r member of the State Board of
Equalization, is also mentioned as an
aspirant.
It is probable that Hinton's successor
will not be named by Governor Budd
before the middle of next week.
TO FLOAT THE CORONA.
Conditions Favorable for the Success
of the Project.
PORT TOWNSEND, March 4.â The
steamship Al-Ki arrived ncr at 11:30

with sixteen passengers, all from Dyea
and Skaguay. When the Al-Ki passed
the Corona at 7:40 o'clock On Wednes

and it was believed by Captain Goodall
and Engineer Lacy that the effort
would be successful.
Officers of the Al-Ki report that one
physician at Skaguay has discovered
the secret of treating the spinal menin
gitis victims, and has not lost a case
in several days. Heretofore the vic

Indian Sealers Lost in a Fog.
SANTA CRUZ, March 4.â Shortly after
noon to-day the fishermen on the wharf
saw a strange craft approaching. It
proved to be a dug-out Indian canoe, such
as are seen around Prince Edwards
Island. Its occupants were two Chinook
Indians from Victoria, B. C. They were
fishermen belonging to the sealer City of
San Diego, which is down the coast on
a sailing trip. At Pigeon Point, thirty
miles up the coast, they left the ship and
went out after seals and got lost In the
dense fog. For two days they had been
at sea in their dug-out without anything
to eat or drink. When they arrived they
told their story in the little English at
their command, and were taken in charge
by the local nshermen and given their
meals and lodging. They had in their
canoe a trophy in the shape of a tine
seal.
MME. MELBA'S
NEW PROTEGEE
Will Musically Educate
the Young Daughter
of "Sid" Farrar.
Great Future for the Girl Pre-
dieted by the Enthusiastic
Prima Donna.
Has Signed a Five-Year Contract
Which Begins After Thorough
Study in Paris.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, March 4.â Mme. Melba.who
is sinking in the Grand Opera-house,
has a new protegee. She is Miss Ger
aldine Farrar, the 16-year-old daughter
of "Sid" Farrar, the old-time baseball
player of the Philadelphia Club, who is
living a. life of honorable retirement in
the suburban town of Melrose. Miss
Farrar was introduced to Melba and
sang for her in the Boston Theater a
few days ago. The prima donna was
deHgbtCd with her voice, embraced the
girl rapturously and predicted that she
would soon astound the musical world.
She agreed to send Miss Farrar to
Paris to study and to bear all the ex
pense before launching her as an oper
atic star. Mr. Damrosch and Manager
Ellis also heard Miss Farrar sing, and
they, too, were most favorably im
pressed with the power, range and
brilliancy of her fine soprano voice.
Mr. Ellis has her name signed to a
five-year contract which begins after
her musical education has been pol
ished off by the most eminent of Pa
risian teachers. The girl has studied
in New York for several years, but has
never appeared in public. Xordica has
heard her sing, and is reported to have
said that she was a coming star. Miss
Farrar is modest and retiring, but has
the enthusiasm for her art and the in
domitable stick-to-itiveness that al
ways win success eventually. She is
described as being prepossessing in her
personal appearance, well developed,
and to have more than ordinary his
trionic gifts. Among her friends and a
comparative few that have heard her
sing it has been well known for a long
time that her voice is remarkable both
for power and brilliancy. She is so
young that Mr. Farrar says he hesi
tates to permit her to take up stage
life, and would not do so if he did not
believe it was for the best interest of
her voice culture. If she has the best
drill in the world she can sing with the
best, for the power is in her as much
as in the greatest.

Asylum Opens for a Disinherited
Young Japanese.
SAN JOSE, March 4.â Kuro Soude, a
young Japanese, was sent to Agnews In
sane Asylum to-day. The unfortunate is
the son of a wealthy gun manufacturer
at Nagasaki. Japan. He came to Cali
fornia about two years ago, and since
that time has lived in this city prcost of
the time. He enjoyed a handsome monthly
remittance from his father, and lived
rather a sporty life.
The story of his wild career reached
Japan, and last month his father cut off
his remittance. The young man saw
nothing but hard work ahead of him, and
brooded over his trouble until he lost
his reason. "When a young man is thus >
cut off by a parent in Japan he is for- #

"Washington, March 4.
After a debate lasting several days j
â  rate late this afternoon passed |
the bill extending the homestead laws i
i nd= providing for right of way for rail- !
roads in the district of Alaska. Com- I
paratively little discvission of general |
â¢ interest was created by the bill. Sec- j
... providing for certain bonding
tsiona to Canada in lieu of privi
leges to be extended by 'the Dominion
. tnent to this country, however,
induced a rather lively debate, as it
br< ught into the controversy the old
nutation on the New England
0 c >t, w hich has been pending between
.1 States and Great Britain for
v hundred years. The statement was
on ihe lloor of the Senate
here was every reason to believe
ny the passage of the bill the rish
â Â«riea question could be settled without
â¢ it effort, as assurances to that effect
had been received from a large and in
â¢ial element in Canada.
W.hen the reading of the bill was re
: turned, Sewell of New Jersey offered the
wing proviso to section 3, which was
adopted:
"ihat where the space" (for the con-
Btruction of a railroad) "Is limited, the
â¢ United Statos District Court Bhall re
qni.re the road first constructed to allow
â  any- other railway or tramway to pass
: over its track, or tracks, through &ui_n
canyon, pass or denle on such equitable
as the saki court may prescribe,
.and all shippers shall be entitled to equal
.accommodation as to the movement of
. their freight and without discrimination
[avor .it' any person or corporation."
The last paragraph of section 6, re
servlng the right of the Government to
purchase or take by proceedings of con
demnatlon any railroad, tramway or
wagon road at its actual cash value, be
iriy in line of Government ownership of
â¢ railroads, was stricken out by an aye
i.:rd no vote. 4S to 7. the seven votes cast
in favor of the paragraph being by Allen
of Nebraska, Butler of North Carolina,
' Harris of Kansas, Heltfeld of Idaho, Xrl
â  son "I Minnesota, Teller of Colorado and
..â¢'â â¢'Turner of Washington.
. . The reading and amending of the bill,
while long and tedious, was accomplished
without particularly important debate un
til seruun 13 was reached. This provides
: : the extension to Canada of the bond
â¢ Ing privileges on Alaskan trade with Can
at the port of Wrangel in Alaska, on
tJon that certain concessions are
".given this country by the Dominion Gov
. rnment, among them being the ripht
of' our fishermen to enter Canadian ports
for t!ie purchase of bait or other supplies.
Turner of Washington moved to strike
out that part ot the section- which related
to the enuring of Canadian ports by
American liahernaen. He die! not, he said,
:....k lecause he was hostile
> New England fisheries, but because !
esned it unfair to burden this meas
â¢ ure with a demand upon the Dominion
Government that it yield a contention It
has made for a hundred years.
Hale of Maine inquired if Turnf-r did not
think it would be of advantage to the
â " ' t'nited States to obtain the fisheries con
.' Â«' -ssion from Canada,
â¦ ;sion from Canada. it would be of ad-
Turner replied tiiat it would be of ad
''â¢'â  vantage if he could obtain it, but did not
believe it could be obtained.
â  * Hansbrough of North Dakota said that
" . the Committee on Public Lands was in |
; 'â  possession of information that Canada
would accept the conditions imposed by â 
':'â ,. . the section. He was firmly of opinion
that the Dominion Government would i
â  â " yield on the fisheries question in view of
the concessions made to it by the bill.
Hoar of Massachusetts expressed the
hope that Turner would not insist upon
â¢ '" his motion. The fisheries question was
. not a local one to New England but a
' V national question â a question, too, par
â â â¢ ticularly applicable to the people of the
" Northwest, where the fisheries interest
'.'.â  was annually becoming greater. He felt!
â  .â  that the fisheries problem was one of im
,. ' mense importance to the people of the
... Northwest, and ought not to be stricken
from the measure. .
In supporting and supplementing what
... 'â¢ Hoar had said, Frye of Maine said that
:.". the pending bill was of national import
..; â  ance. He thought there was never a
; . better opportunity to secure concessions
. from the Canadian Government than at
; : the present time, when the Canadians
:" â¢ wanted something from the United
â â :â  .States. He did not think the motion ought
â  .'â¢"to prevail, because we have long been
â¢.: giving Canada much and receiving little
:.' . in return. Frye believed that if It were
:. â¢ not for the captiousness of Canada there
' : â  would not be the slightest trouble be
! tween this country and Great Britain.
'â : â  Wilson supported the contention of
:â  â¢ Turner and thought it the height of ab
â  â â¢ surdity to tack the fisheries question to
â . . a bill providing for the encouragement of
; railway construction in Alaska-
Carter agreed with Hoar and Frye that
.. '.â¢ the fisheries question, so far as it was
considered in this bill, was of national
importance. The fisheries industry In Al
aska and the Northwest now reached !
..$6;000,000' per annum, and was growing in I
â¢â â  importance every year.
Turner's motion to strike out the fish- i
4eries portion of â c section was defeated '
by an aye and no voteâ 34 to 16. The sec- I
tion was adopted without division. As
agreed to, section 13 is as follows:
â  . ' That under rules and regulations to be pre- !

A CALL TO
CELEBRATE
THE JUBILEE
Governor Budd's Letter of Invita
tion to Neighboring States
and Cities.
He Asks That They Join in California's Anniver
sary Exercises to Be Observed in
1900.
Governor Budd has taken the first
' step for a general celebration of Cali
| fornia's jubilee of Statehood. Hereto
! fore the wish of the State has been
I outspoken and unanimous, and the en
' couragement of neighboring States has
been freely offered, but now the Gover
nor has asked for their co-operation,
and, judging by previous well-wishers,
! there will be no lack of response and
no possibility of dissatisfaction with
the replies.
Governor Budd has prepared a commu
nication, which he will Bend to all the
States of the Union which have been
I admitted to Statehood since California's
i entry in 1850. He asks that the Gov
ernors addressed appoint commission
ers to represent their States, and that
I the Mayors of big cities be asked to
follow their example. His letter is as
folloWS: March 3, 1898.
To his Excellency, William A. Richards,
Governor of Wyomingâ Sir: The admis
! sion of California to the Union as a State
' September 9, 1850. was the first notable
I historic event in the American develop
ment of that vast section of country
whose annexation gave tne Republic an
unbroken sweep of territory from ocean
Ito ocean. The consequences of the event
! and the almost coincident discovery of
I gold were momentous. The attention of
; daring, enterprising men of all parts of
j the Union, and nearly all parts of the
' world, was attracted to this coast, and at
! once began that splendid, romantic and
i arduous work of empire building which in
i fifty years has made the whole region
from the Rocky Mountains to the sea the
most marvelous theater of industrial en
terprise known to history.
The fiftieth anniversary of an event so
j important in itself and so fruitful of mag
nificent consequences merits a commem
1 oration of more than ordinary dignity and
magnitude. The celebration should not
be left to a single State or city. All the
wide- region of territory annexed to the
Union at the same time with California
by the treaty with Mexico, all of the vast
section allied with California by reason
of similarity of mineral resources, and all
the great States that in the last fifty
years have gained admission to the Union
because of an increase of population ac
quired by the western movement of hardy
men. stimulated by the earlier rush of
pioneers to California, should unite in the
task of fitly celebrating an occasion mem
: orable in the history of oil.
An industrial exposition will afford the
most appropriate means of celebrating
the semi-centennial of a people whose de
velopment has been almost wholly in
dustrial. Moreover, such an exposition
would be not commemorative only, but
educational and inducive as well. It
MAYOR PHELAN
WAS GRILLED
The Auditor Defends His
Actions Before the
Supervisors.
Dr. Rottanzi Thinks That the
Mayor* Should Do More
Work.
A Warm Time Expected Before the
Next Meeting of trie
Board.
Auditor Broderick and Supervisor
Rottanzi, chairman of the Finance
Committee of the Board of Supervisors,
"took a fall out of" Mayor Phelan at
the meeting of the committee yester
day when the question of a threatened
deficit in the municipal funds came up.
Mayor Phelan had charged that the
Auditor and Treasurer Widber had vio
lated the law in honoring demands of
the school department In excess of the
amounts allowed by the one-twelfth
act.
He also stated that the deficit would
be large, and that the responsibility
rested with the officials named.
"I want to say to you gentlemen," re
marked the Auditor, "that my books do
not, up to the present moment, show
any deficit. We simply anticipate that
there will be a deficit if the bills con- j
tinue to come in at the present rate.
i The Mayor and his adviser. Counselor
i Murphy, io the contrary notwithstand-
I ing, there need be no deficit if the Su
! pervisors will agree to cut down ex
! penses. When the United States Gov
ernment is out of funds all public work
I is suspended pending another appropri
ation. I see no reason why the Su
, pervisors should not stop all street work :
\ for the present.
"As a matter of fact, all Mayor Phe
lan seems to care about is to make
trouble for others. He pays little or no i
attention to the duties of his own office, ]
i and spends his time annoying others.
â  He has turned his typewriter loose on
me."
"I don't think that would do," said !
Supervisor Rottanzi, referring to the j
stopping of street work. "The people |
demand that the board be progressive.
I do not think the public would be sat
isfied with the retrenchment policy. I
wish to say, however, that the Mayor
is endeavoring to shift responsibility
from himself to the shoulders of the
Supervisors, and I propose for one to
see that the responsibility is placed j
where it properly belongs. If the May- j
or were to give more attention to the j
conduct of the municipal departments I j
imagine he would find his time fully !
occupied."
It was decided to await the commu
nication of the Auditor before taking
action. , -^

a place of residence and as a land whose
rich resources afford safe and profitable
means for the investment of capital.
The splendid results accomplished for
the Southern States by the recent expo
sitions at Nashville and Atlanta, and the
sanguine expectations cherished by the
States of the Mississippi Valley with re
gard to the outcome of the exposition at
Omaha this summer, attest the value of
such enterprises when undertaken on a
scale large enough to be national In their
scope and attractiveness. A State expo
sition accomplishes little, while an expo
sition maintained by a rich and powerful
section of the union produces great re
sults; For that reason a combination of
all the States of this portion of the union
is desirable in the proposed enterprise.
The States of tho South have acted to
gether, those of the Mississippi Valley are
united for the Omaha Fair, and it is now
the turn of the Pacific Coast and moun
tain States to imitate their example.
The time fixed for holding the proposed
fair is mo<t propitious. The host of vig
orous men now journeying across the con
tinent toward the gold fields of Alaska
will, by the year 1900, have accomplished
much i"n the "way of developing that froz
en region, and thousands of them will be
seeking in milder climates a home for the
remainder of their lives. Why should not
all of these men be retained in the West,
and thousands of others be drawn from
the East by the exposition of such an ar
ray of the fruits and products of Western
sun and soil as will amply demonstrate
the superiority of this section over that of
any other portion of the Union?
As a preliminary step toward the ac
complishment of harmony of effort
throughout the great West on this sub
ject, I request your Excellency to appoint
a committee to represent your State at 3
convention to be held at a place and date
to be fixed in the near future. I propose
appointing a committee to represent Cali
fornia at the convention and have invited
the Governors of the other Western
States to do likewise. Your Excellency
will understand the advisability of early
action in the matter, in order that the
work of preparation so needful for an ex
position on the scale desired may begin
as promptly as possible.
A fuller understanding of the proposed
enterprise will be gained from the in
closed clippings from the San Francisco
Call, the original mover in the plan. From
these it will be seen that the movement
is already well launched here and is
strongly supported by men whose lead
ership assures a strong following, not
only in California, but throughout the
great West.
Mayor Phelan of San Francisco will
shortly appoint a committee to look after
the interests in that city in connection
with the exposition, and the Mayors of
other cities of the State will do likewise.
Anticipating a favorable response and
the cordial co-operation of your Excel
lency and the State of Wyoming in this
enterprise for the general good, I remain,
very truly yours. JAMES H. BT'DD.
Governor of California.
THE LATE GEORGE H. BRYANT.
Expressions of general sorrow and regret are manifested for the death
of George H. Bryant, who succumbed to a stroke of paralysis last Wednes
day morning at the home of his daughter, Mrs. Edward Fay, at Ellis and
Octavia streets. Although the deceased had been suffering for years from
the affliction which finally carried him away, his death, although known by
his relatives to be inevitable, was at the time farthest from the immediate
thoughts of his wife and daughter, who strove against hope in attempting
to prolong his life. The disease first manifested itself some six years ago,
when his right leg was crippled by a stroke of the dread malady. Ever
since this time he has been failing both in body and mind, and when death
finally claimed its own, his body was a mere skeleton and his mind a total
blank. For five days previous to his death he was slowly sinking,
and at times life seemed to be almost extinct. All this time he
was totally unconscious, not even recognizing the features and voice of
his wife and daughter. He lingered on striving to grasp the thread of
life with a firm hand until Wednesday morning, when he was compelled
to give up the unequal struggle and his years of suffering were
brought to a close. His remains, soon after death, were conveyed to an
undertaking establishment, where they are to be embalmed preparatory
to shipment to Boston, in compliance with the invalid's request that his
body might rest in the soil of his native birthplace.
Funeral services will be held over the body to-morrow afternoon at 2
o'clock at the home of his daughter. Mrs. Fay, on Octavia street. The de
cedent was a graduate of Cambridge College, and for many years was a
member of the celebrated Boston Lancers. He was a member of the Cali
fornia National Guard, which he joined after his arrival in the State,
being elected later as an honorary member. Soon after his arrival here he '
founded the firm of Neville & Bryant, which now bears his name. The
valuation of his estate is not known as yet, no inquiry having been made
into the condition of his business affairs.
His wife, daughter and a brother in Boston are the only surviving
blood relatives of the deceased.

This Is the edict of the Board of
Health, and it means that war to the
knife will henceforth be on between the
Federal and the State quarantine au
thorities. Dr. Blue and Dr. Rosenau
will now be in line for solar plexus
blows from such an aggregation of State
talent as Dr. John .Malcolm William
son. Dr. Gerald J. Fitzgibbons, Dr.
Henry H. Hart. T>r. Aloysius O'Brien
and Dr. Edmund Hill, all of whom will
be ably seconded by Chief of Police
Lees and his merry men.
Another case of sickness was dis
covered on the Occidental and
Oriental Steamship Company's Doric
last Thursday evening, and the
agents of the vessel ignored the
State officials, but notified Dr. Rosenau.
The latter, withr-ut any warrant, went
Into the State's jurisdiction and took
the sick man and his companion to the
quarantine station at AngÂ°l Island on
the Government tug (leorge M. Stern
berg. When Dr. Hill heard >f this he
immediately went to the mail dock and
stopped the work of discharging the
Doric. He put some of the health offi
cers in charge of the ship, and refused
to allow anybody to come ashore or
anybody aboard. Several custom house
officials and employes of the steamship
company were caught on the vessel,
and they had to- remain aboard all day.
When the Doric reached port last
Monday she was flying the yellow flag.
Acting State Quarantine Officer Hill
boarded her off Alcatraz, and found
that a Chinese fireman had died of
smallpox a few days previously. A few
minutes later Dr. Blue, the assistant
Federal quarantine officer, caone aboard
and he at once sent for Dr. Rosenau.
The latter went off to the steamer, and
the three physicians, after a consulta
tion, ordered the Doric into quarantine.
Everything and everybody aboard were
fumigated, and the steerage passengers
and crew were vaccinated, after which
the vessel was allowed to dock.
It was while the fumigating and vac
cinating was going on that Deputy Sur
veyor of the Port Chauncy M. St. John
issued his now famo-us order to hold
Dr. Hill in quarantine until the vessel
was released by Dr. Rosenau.
A couple of days ago the crew of the
Doric began to complain of their sore
arms. In even* instance the vaccine
took, and some of the men were quite
sick. Wednesday last Thomas Hellom,
one of the boilermakers, was so bad
that the ship's doctor had to prescribe
for him. Thursday he was worse, and
as he had been in the same vatch as
the Chinese who died it was thought
better to notify the quarantine officer,
Dr. Rosenau. As soon as the latter re
ceived the notification he went to the
Doric, and not only took avay Hellom.
but also his roommate, Alexander Rux
ton, the sixth assistant engineer.
Having been granted pratique and
the Doric being tied up to tho mail com
pany's wharf, it is stated that she was
clearly within the jurisdiction of the
State, and the two men should have
been removed to the pest house. The
State quarantine authorities hold that
in acting the way he did Dr. Rosenau
has made himself liable to the State
laws, and a warrant for his arrest will
probably be issued.
The officers of the Doric assert that
Hellom was not suffering from vario
loid, but from pneumonia and the fever
consequent upon his vaccination. The
State authorities do not accept this the
ory, however, holding that Dr. Rosenau
would never take a man suffering from
pneumonia, from a ship to Angel Island,
as the trip would almost certainly re
sult in his death.
The Board of Health held a meeting
to consider the question yesterday aft
ernoon in Dr. Fitzgibbons' office. Drs.
Hart, Hill and Fitzgibbons were pres
ent. D. D. Stubbs, secretary of the
Occidental and Oriental Steamship
line, and Dr. Chapman, the Doric's sur
geon, had been summoned to attend
the session. The fact that they saw fit
to do so, accompanied by Attorney
r oulds, was considered evidence that
the company is convinced the State is
in the lead.
On being questioned Dr. Chapman
asserted that Hellom was suffering
from vaccinia. Secretary Stubbs prom
ised to do whatever the State authori
ties decided best.
After a consultation the board con
cluded that before taking further ac
tion it would be better to make fur
ther investigation, and accordingly Dr.
Hill and Dr. Fitzgibbons, accompanied
by Dr. Bunnell, started for Angel Isl
and last evening on the State tug Gov
ernor Perkins. On landing they were
met by Dr. Blue, who, in the absence
of Dr. Rosenr j, refused to permit any
examination of the sick man. Dr.
Fitzgibbons then put the question
squarely whether Hellom had the small
pox, and was given an evasive an-
Bwer.
"Then," said Dr. Hill, "tell us what
is the trouble with the engineer, Rux
ton."
Dr. Blue denied emphatically at
first that such a man had been brought
to the island, but upon Dr. Hill telling
him there was no use in prevaricating, I
as the opposite was known. Dr. Blue
laughed and admitted that Ruxton
was on the island and had the vario
loid.
Another meeting of the Board of â 
Health was held at the same place late
yesterday afternoon, Dr. Williamson
presiding. At that meeting the reso
lution which heads this article was in
troduced by Dr. Hart and adopted
unanimously, being personally served
on Secretary Stubbs by Dr. Hill.
Stubbs promised that the Doric should
be dropped into the stream this morn
ing. Chief of Police Lees appeared at
the meeting and informed the board
that any assistance in his power would
t>e cheerfully granted.
The proposition with the board
seems to be very simple: that the Fed
eral quarantine authorities have vio
lated the law by taking a man outside
the confines of the city and county.
They regard this as the best chance
they will ever get to show that the
State means to have something to say
on the question of quarantine.
By suggestion of Dr. Hart a tele
gram was sent the Secretary of the ;
Treasury last night, informing him
that the Federal quarantine authori
ties had surreptitiously removed two
passengers of the Doric from the con
fines of the city and county of San
Francisco, and asking his intervention
in the affair.
A force of twelve health inspectors,
under charge of Inspector O'Brien, is
now guarding the Doric. They go on
duty in squads of fours, and each divi
sion serves six hours. Those on duty
are Inspectors Luders, Donovan, Mc-
Grath Connolly, Lydon, Benjamin,
Tobin. Cameron, David, Crow, Kelly*.
P"ltP "I te wish I could get Chauncey M.
Sinjun aboard the DorfC* says
Hill, "and then I would be happy. I d
keep him there a month.'
Drs Kottanzi. Williamson. O'Brien
and Hill paid a visit to the ship last
niXit and found that the forty-eight
stevedores and longshoremen impris
oned aboard were in a pitiable plight.
"AH the blankets." said Dr. Rpttanzl.
â¢â¢wore taken over to the quarantine sta
tion to be fumigated, and as the vessel
has been ordered to go out into the
stream in the morning, these men wil
suffer grertly. After seeing this said
SitiS of affairs, I paid a visit to
Contain Spillane at the Southern Po
lice Station, and he promised to do
what he could toward supplying the
unfortunates with necessary bedding,
but I doubt if he will be able to do
Â«nvthing as the hour was already late
and he had no store for such an eraer-
gency. â

One Fault to Be Found
With "The Drama
of Eden."
Some Difficulty in Arraying
Adam and Eve in Suit
able Costume.
The Rev. Russell "Writes a Play
Whersby He Hopes to Ele
vate the Stage.
Manag-er Friedlander is somewhat
puzzled about a play of which he has
the manuscript. In poring: over it he
has burned midnight oil in large quan
tities. At least he would have burned
this sort of oil had his apartments not
been equipped with facilities for the
use of gas. These statements, although
true and necessary, get a little ahead
of the story.
Rev. A. M. Russell has written a play.
It is moral and elevating, having been
devised in the periods between the
writing of sermons. He calls it "The
Drama of Eden." It is evident that the
gentleman has been anxious to follow
the Biblical account, a circumstance
which, however commendable, has led
to difficulty. It sets forth the life of the
original pair, their love-making, their
being fooled by a tempter, and the mu
tual giving away to a mad passion for
apples.
There are three acts and thirteen
scenes, some of them striking. The
characters, aside from an angel chorus,
are not numerous, of course, because
at that time the entire population would
have constituted a limited cast. To
make up for this unavoidable deficiency
the animal kingdom has been freely
drawn upon. There are to be all man
ner of beasts grouped about the stage
when the curtain goes up on "The
Drama of Eden." Herein is an initial
difficulty. No modern theater is
equipped with a menagerie. Mr. Fried
lander finds himseif dismayed by the
fact that a principal speaking part has
been given to the serpent. Of course
the serpent did have considerable to
say, but to train the modern serpent
to become conversational, or to make

The man worked in an Ohio coal mine, and this is the story hi
told: "For some years past I have been employed under mothel
earth, from one and a half to two miles from the mouth of the mine,
digging coal. The great distance under the hills makes it impossible
for me to get pure air, which is forced to us by the aid of great fans.
During breaks in machinery the air would become bad, causing first
great pa-ins in my head, dizziness and fainting. This continued until;
nest was pains in stomach, indigestion and dyspepsia. Working hardf
in the mines I naturally was a hearty eater until at last I had dyspep-'
sia so bad I suffered terrible. The doctor prescribed for me, but I
only got worse. I took several kinds of medicine. I saw Ripans
Tabules advertised and going to the drug store bought some. In
three d*ys I was a new man, my head is clear, stomach -well, no dy*.,
pepsia. These Ripaus Tabules did ie"
it assume such an aspect as to be capa
ble of winning feminine esteem, is no
simple matter. All that the educated
snake of these degenerate times can do
is to coil unpleasantly and swallow a
rabbit whole, hissing ai. intervals and
darting a forked tongue. The "human
snake" is merely a boneless mortal who
ties himself in knots, but would fall
far short of filling the bill.
Another obstacle presents itself. It
is accepted that the costumes of Adam
and Eve were not elaborate. Even aft
er they had developed to the figleaf
stage much was lacking which wcruld
now be considered desirable. The
anomaly of draping in cloth a lady and
gentleman who antedated the most
primitive loom impresses itself at once
even upon the non-professional mind.
The theme of the play does not need to
be explained, for it follows closely the
story as told in Genesis. Nor does
there appear occasion here to set forth
that the object in view is the eleva
tion of the stage.
It may be said in all fairness that the
verse in which the aspirations of the
reverend dramatist have found expres
sion is not of a high order. The last of
it may be taken as a sample. This
pertains to the sorry instant when the
pair are driven from the garden, Adam
saying to Eve:
"Then cheer thee, my fair, my tender bride;
Hence lft us go, walking side by side,
Joined in all the conflicts of a varied life,
A faithful husband and a true and loving
wife,
'Til the voire of him who hath this life given.
Shall call us home to his sweet rest in
heaven."
(Exit Adam and Eve while the curtain falls.)
air. Friedlander, as an expert, recog
nizes much of excellence in the effort,
but the weak spots also impress him.
He realizes that the electric imitation
of the creation of the light which at di
vine command shed its benign rays over
the newly maae world would make a
hit. He thinks the animals wcnild,
too, especially in the later scenea
in which they are to be strewn
deceased about the stage, but
he sees no way to overcome
the obstacles before mentioned. In his
opinion, the work of the Rev. Mr. Rus-.
sell is better adapted to reading. It
could be illustrated by pictures thrown
on a screen, but it can't be twisted to
fit the exigency of artistic requirement
as stage managers and property men
understand it.

THE JURY SYSTEM.
AN evening contemporary, which resembles
necessity in knowing very little law, uses up
two columns of its space to make a hyster
ical protest against petit jury exemptions. The bur
den of its complaint is that section 200 of the Code of
Civil Procedure perpetrates an outrage when it says
that attorneys, preachers, almshouse keepers, prison
officials, sailors, express agents, mail carriers, tele
graph officials, national guardsmen, firemen and
railway employes shall not be compelled to sit on
juries. Our contemporary's "thinker" inclines to the
belief that if these classes were all forced to do jury
duty justice would be administered more uniformly
and â we infer â an occasional verdict might be ren
dered against the railroad monopoly.
The difficulty with this ponderous legal luminary is
that it does not understand the reasons of the exemp
tions concerning which it complains. With respect
to the national guardsmen and firemen the purpose of
the law is to induce men to do militia and fire duty.
The idea is that citizen soldiers and firemen should
get something more substantial than newspaper no
toriety for protecting life and property. (Lest our
contemporary may say that firemen are paid we will
mention that country fire departments are mostly
volunteer.) Railway and telegraph men are ex
empted because it is thought that they will accom
modate the public more by attending to their busi
ness than by serving on juries. There would be quite
as much sense in making Judges and Sheriffs serve
as in making attorneys, who are officers of the court
and a part of the judicial machinery. And so with
the others â they are mostly disqualified.
Another trouble with our grandiloquent contempor
ary is that it relics on ancient history for its knowl
edge of the jury system. What Junius and Paley said
about juries is at present irrelevant and immaterial.
They lived when the system was actually a "bulwark
of liberty." Bulwarks of liberty are no longer neces
sary. The great problem of modern times is not to
discover methods of preserving liberty, of which
there is abundance on hand at all times, but to find
ways for preventing corporations using liberty to
fleece the masses. The jury system is a valuable aid
in depriving the people of some of the blessings of
liberty. When a street car corporation, for instance,
runs over a person, plenty of juries are always found
to bring in a verdict for the defendant. How would
this be changed by summoning lawyers, ministers,
Sheriffs and railway employes to sit on juries?
As a matter of fact the system of submitting legal
disputes to twelve "peers" is rapidly going out of
date. Intelligent men all over the world are recog
nizing it, under modern conditions, as a failure. If
juries are not ignorant they are prejudiced; if they
are not prejudiced they fall victims to the blandish
ments of tricky lawyers; if they are not moved by
eloquent sophistry they are "fixed." So in any event
they fail to do justice. Their verdicts are con
stantly being set aside by the appellate courts as con
trary to the evidence or as the result of passion and
prejudice.
The "reformed procedure" introduced by the late
David Dudley Field contemplates their final aban
donment. Every year puts them further behind us.
Probably they would long ago have been abolished
had not the law â ever conservative â feared the awful
shock of such profound thinking as is thought by
our esteemed contemporary. The legislation against
the jury system in this State, which "thinkers" like
our contemporary regard with so much apprehen
sion, is merely a manifestation of the tendency of
the age. The jury system in time will disappear.
The youth who writes two columns a day in our con
temporary to express a single thought may himself
live to see it abolished.
The gentleman who claims the honor of discover
ing a cure for yellow fever has concluded, generons
soul, to keep the process secret. It is not likely that
he has any objection to a victim of the malady being
cured, but for him to talk about his own specific
would of course be a violation of ethics. There re
mains the comforting thought that, anyhow, the
method is probably what is known technically as a
fake.
Senator Proctor's narrow escape from being blown
up is suggestive of the manner in which pins have
saved many lives. This feat on the part of the pins
was first made known by a schoolboy, who explained
that the pins did this by not t>eing swallowed. Sen
ator Proctor was saved by not being on the blown-up
train.
If there is no epidemic of spinal fever at Skaguay
there are a number of correspondents up that way

epidemic is in full blast.
Councilman Brosnahan of Oakland merits the

THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM.
\A R. TOWNE'S speech rings the changes on
! / \ the Republican platform, and, like Mr.
* l Bryan, he declares that what they call bi
metallism is admitted by that platform to be a good
thing, but this country is not to have it without the
consent of Europe.
Of course the platform is not susceptible of any
such construction. It does not consider the free
coinage of silver by the United States at 16 to I as
a good thing at all. It pledges the party to much
Â«uch an agreement with other nations as that between
the states of the Latin Union, by which the ratio and
volume of coinage were agreed to by the several
state parties to the treaty. The Republican platform
does not indorse nor foster the idea that, in default
of such international agreement, free coinage at 16
to i could be or should be attempted by the United
States alone.
The reasons for this position are sound and are
obvious to any one who chooses to think on the sub
ject. If this country, England, France and Ger
many agree to coin silver equally with gold at a fixed
ratio their joint primacy of the commerce and finance
of the world would make impossible the driving of
gold out of circulation within the territory of one of
them and its absorption by the others. Each would
retain its normal gold circulation because no other
would get a profit in reaching for it. The flow from
one to another of both gold and silver would be the
normal circulation for use in adjusting trade balances
and would cause neither inconvenience nor alarm.
It would be exactly that process described by Mr.
Jefferson. He said our standard of value should be
the same as that of the nations with which our com
mercial intercourse is the greatest, and then it would
flow beneficially from the country where it was too
plentiful to that in which it was too scarce.
Now let us consider the difference between this
system and that proposed by Messrs. Towne, Bryan
and the fiatists. They wish to compel the United
States, independently of other nations, to adopt free
coinage at the ratio of 16 to 1. The effect of this
will be totally different from that of an international
agreement. It will set in operation the Gresham
law, and as fast as our silver coinage increases the
gold will be driven out to the gold-using nations.
Finally our gold will disappear, just as it has dis
appeared from every free coinage country in the
world, and we will be left upon a silver mono
metallic basis.
Here then are the two systems between which the
country is invited to chocse. The Republican posi
tion is that in default of the international agreement
our standard of value shall remain as It is. This was
its position in 1896, and every man who voted its
ticket so understood it. There was no intimation, in
the platform or elsewhere that if an international
agreement were not made the party would go over to
Mr. Bryan.
President McKinley has in good faith carried out
the platform. He appointed a commission of free
silver men, one of them a supporter of Mr. Bryan,
to visit European Governments and negotiate for an
international agreement on coinage. So far this
effort has not been successful, but it will not be re
linquished. If it have any chance of success it will
immediately disappear upon the success of Mr.
Bryan's policy. Henri Cernuschi and all European
bimetallists repeatedly declared that the dominant ob
stacle to an international agreement has always been
the agitation in the United States for such indepen
dent action as Mr. Bryan proposes.
Therefore, stripped of its gaudy verbiage, Mr.
Towne's proposition is that we pass from the gold
standard, with a large use of legal tender silver and
a circulation of the coins of both metals at a joint
par, to the silver standard, with a contraction of the
currency by driving gold away, and a circulation of
silver alone at the silver par, or a depreciation of
about 50 per cent, and an issue of fiat paper to fill the
vacuum left by gold, which in its turn will, under the
Gresham law, drive out silver.
No rant nor fustian can conceal so plain an issue.
If the fortunes of partisan warfare compel the Repub
lican party to give battle again upon that issue it will
be found ready, and if its position bring to its sup
port the sound money men who value the financial
stability and honor* of their country above party
names, it will keep faith with them and the country.
LOCOL GOVERNMENT IN LONDON.
BY the sweeping victory of the Progressives over
the Moderates in the London elections on
Thursday evidence is furnished that at least
one of the many new consolidated city governments
cf the time has given satisfaction to its people.
With sixty-seven Progressives elected against forty
Moderates the County Council will go forward with
its work of municipal improvement and carry out in
London many of those civic enterprises which have
proven so successful in the smaller cities of Glasgow
and Birmingham.
The very names given to,- the opposing parties in
the contest reveal the nature of the issue between
them and the lines on which they were divided. In
national politics the citizens of London are either
Conservatives, Liberals or Radicals; Tories or
Whigs; Unionists or Home Rulers; but in this elec
tion they abandoned all national party ties, chose
new names for their contending factions and divided
on the sole question whether the County Council
should go forward or halt, whether it should have
more power or less.
The London Speaker a few weeks ago in discuss
ing the election stated the issue at stake in these
words: "If the Londoners want to abolish the Coun
cil, or at least to render it a futile and impracticable
institution, they had better return a Moderate ma
jority; but if they think themselves capable of man
aging their own affairs and desire that their repre
sentatives should work themselves instead of ob
structing the work of others, they will elect a solid
force of Progressives who can bear down obstruc
tion and meet the demands of London." The Lon
doners have answered the question. They have de
cided to continue the work of making old London
a modern city â placing it, in fact, among the most
progressive municipalities of the time.
The triumph is a notable one for those who desire
to see municipal government become a much more
important part of politics than it has been in the
past. London is a conservative city. It votes against
home rule. Few of its boroughs ever return Liberals
to Parliament. Yet in this election its citizens have
shown they can be liberal enough where their local
affairs are concerned. They elected John Burns, a
day laborer, over the Earl of notwithstand
ing the fact that the Earl is one of the richest men
in the empire and that both he and his Countess
made a house to house canvass of the district; but
they did not elect Burns because of any prejudice
against rich men or noblemen, for they also elected
such men as Lord Hardwicke, Baron Monkwell, Sir
Horace Farquahar and Sir Tundell Maple, the latter
of whom is connected with one of the big depart
ment stores of London and may be therefore consid

ered a representative not only of wealth, but of
aggressive wealth.
It was, in short, a victory for the extension of
municipal government, the establishment of a com
pleter home and local rule than Londoners have
known before. It is a forward ?tep in a move
ment going on in this country as well as in Eng
land, though it is not so much needed here as
there, for American cities have a larger scope of local
authority than those of England (the Londoners, for
example, do not control their own police), and may
be regarded as an evidence that municipal adminis
tration is to be in the coming century one of the
best fields for the exercise of political activity in
which men of public spirit can engage.
THE POSTOFFICE DEFICIT.
AS Mr. Loud's bill to correct the abuses of the
second-class mail privilege has been defeated
in the House by the comparatively large ma
jority of 162 to 119, it is clear that some other means
will have to be devised for reducing postoffice expen
ditures unless this Congress intends to permit the
postoffice to remain a burden upon the Government
and a cause for general taxation.
Upon those who defeated the bill ought to rest the
responsibility for devising some other remedy. This,
however, cannot be expected of them. The great
majority of the adverse vote was made up of Demo
crats and Populists, and these parties are not emi
nent for success in constructive legislation. They are
vigorous enough in opposition to Republican meas
ures, but when anything affirmative is asked of them
they fail utterly either to agree among themselves or
to devise anything on which others can agree.
There has been more or less talk for some time
past of reducing postal expenditures by reducing the
amounts paid railroads for transportation. Some of
the statistics used in argument for this plan are cer
tainly of a nature to justify a belief that much might
be saved in that way without doing wrong to the
transportation companies. The plan, however, up
to this time has lacked official recommendation, and
that fact discredits the fair showing made by its sup
porters and inclines to the belief that the figures
given by them may be inaccurate or so juggled as
to present an appearance quite different from the
reality.
The Loud bill was a fair and commendable one.
It dealt with an abuse known to exist and proposed
a remedy that would have been just to the taxpayers
and beneficial to the PostofTice Department. The
privilege of second class at low rates of postage was
designed for the benefit of newspapers and genuine
periodicals, and incidentally for the general public
that desires the news and reads magazines and re
views. Advantage has been taken of the law to send
through the mails as second class matter thousands
of pounds of advertising circulars, trashy novels and
other stuff of the kind, for which the people have no
use and for the transportation of which they should
not be made to pay. The postoffice should not be
made to bear the burden and do the work of dis
tributing this great mass of trash and truck, and even
if its transportation entailed no deficit it would be
well to make it pay full postage rates and pay the cost
of handling it.
A bill similar to that which has just been defeated
was passed by the House last year by a vote of 144 to
104. It is not clear why the result was different this
year, but there is this much encouragement to be
drawn from the situation that since the House has
changed once it may change again, and when the
public mind has been thoroughly educated on the
subject we shall have the remedy provided and the
wrong removed.
\* R. WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN, a dis
/ \ tinguished citizen of Nebraska, gives it as his
* opinion that in the event of a war between
the United States and Spain there is no doubt we
could "lick 'em." Mr. Bryan did not fulminate this
opinion until he had consulted Judge A. M. Jackson,
who, according to the newspaper correspondent
guilty of transmitting the interview, is a celebrated
jurist of the Populistic-Democratic school. We
may, therefore, assume that Mr. Bryan's view has
been carefully considered, and that he is willing to
stand by it in case it is disputed.
But it is to be noted at this juncture that the ques
tion whether or not the United States would be able
to "lick" Spain in the event of a war is not at all
equal in absorbing interest to the other question
which we now ask, Would Mr. Bryan, the distin
guished citizen of Nebraska, go to the front and fight
in case of trouble? In short, would Mr. Bryan help
us to "lick 'em"?
Everybody is aware of the fact that the great
Nebraskan's jaw is equal to any conflict. But talk
never won a real battle. A careful and discriminative
use of lead and gunpowder determines the result of
genuine war, and no matter how valiant Mr. Bryan
may be in wordy controversy, in actual physical con
flict he might not loom up at all. We have no hesi
tation in saying, however, that if Mr. Bryan will help
us to "lick 'em" a majority of the people of the
United States will favor immediate war with Spain.
There is a general desire to get the distinguished
Nebraskan into some kind of a fight in which his
jawbone will not count. He is rapidly talking the
American people to death, and we doubt whether the
United States as a nation will long survive his ora
tory and "arguments." But if he would go to the
front with a musket a war with Spain might be worth
all it would cost. For one thing, we would hear no
more of his free silver blather, and for another he
might take up his permanent residence in Cuba after
the war, which would impose upon this country a
long-needed rest.
It is too much to hope, however, that Mr. Bryan
will fight. Unless the impending conflict with Spain
is placed on a basis of 32 to 1 the discount probably
would not be sufficiently pointed to engage his at
tention.
Some of the rumors coming from Cuba lack the
element of reasonableness. For instance, it is im
probable that the Spanish hired a diver to affix a
torpedo to the Maine and then killed him to prevent
the accident of loquacity. Fully as likely is it that
some diver, fired by patriotism, stuffed himself with
gun cotton and, hurling his distended corporosity
against the ship, exploded with deadly effect.
It is not often seemly to speak lightly of a Repre
sentative, for he is naturally an august personage,
yet James Hamilton Lewis of the great State of
Washington must" quit acting like a monkey on a
stick or some correspondent will be apt to say
something not tending to soothe the savage breast
of the statesman.
Even if the State quarantine officers refuse to be
divorced from their salaries, they ought to keep out

leave port inside of two weeks. This
is rather hard on the companies of the

give the vessel a fitting reception next
Sunday and Monday.
The Pinta was turned over to the

jiavnl reserve. She was thoroughly
overhauled at the navy-yard, and dur
ing her dock trial everything worked
satisfactorily. Thursday last she was
taken alongside Mission-street wharf
end coaled for her voyage down the
coast. About 5 p. m. Captain Louis
31. Turner and his officers went aboard
and an hour later the gunboat was
given a preliminary trial on the bay.
Everything seemed to work well, and
B start was made for the Golden Gate.
"When the engines were opened up it
found that the boilers v ?re leak

enough steam to drive the gunboat a
knot an hour against the tide. She was
accordingly anchored off Meiggs
wharf, and yesterday she drifted and
steamed down with the tide to her

Having accepted her from Uncle

about a fortnight, and then another
attempt will be made to get the gun

Talk about "taking coal to Newcas

Bailed for the Orient last Thursday,
took away over forty tons of tea for
China. The anomaly is easily ex
plained. The tea was shipped from
Hongkong here for use in Chinatown.
It did not come up to the Government
standard, and was ordered exported or
it would be destroyed. The Chinese in
sisted that the tea was what their
countrymen liked and appealed the
matter to Washington. Uncle Sam's
Appraisers replied that no matter how
much the Chinese liked that class of
tea, it was detrimental to health, and
being below the standard it must be
disposed of inside of two months. The
stuff was worth in bond here nearly
J14.000, so its owners thought it better
to Fend it back to China and pay a
second freight bill than have a total
loss on their hands.
Besides the tea the Peking took away
ia valuable cargo, among which was
Â£450 oales of cotton, valued at $53,000.

and fan-tan were again In full blast in
Chinatown, and that the presence of Ser
geant Shea and posse In the Mongolian
district seemed to serve as a stimulus to
Illegal gambling were declared based on
falsehood by Chief Lees last evening. "I
have Sergeant Shea'B report .In my posses
sion," said the Chief, "and it is entirely
patisfactory. His record since he has
been in charge of the Chinatown squad
Is a good one and he will be kept there."
Sergeant Shea is one of the most effi
cient officers in the police department,
and it is broadly hinted that those who
were instrumental in circulating the re
ports against him had an object in view;
the object of getting him removed from
the Mongolian quarter that a less vigilant
eergeant might be put in his place, which
would be beneficial to a certain combina
tion that now finds its road a hard one.
Bince Sergeant Shea was placed in charge
of Chinatown he has arrested Chinese
gamblers numbering into the thousands,
and in consequence a vast revenue has
flowed into the treasury. The report that
Sergeant McDonald, who daily assigns
the police court cases, was discriminating
against Judge Campbell, and has refused
to send Chinese gambling cases to his
department of the lower court, as the
Judge refused to "stand in," and had
threatened to Impose a heavy fine on any
gambler proved guilty in his court, is
also vehemently denied. Sergeant Mc-
Donald points to the records of the court
to prove that the statement is based on
falsehood, and to the action of Judge
Campbell, when seventeen Chinese eases
â were before him last week, as sufficient
evidence regarding his stand In the mat
ter. When the seventeen cases referred
to were called before Judge Campbell,
Froscuting Attorney Spinetti Informed
the court that the priÂ«oners were willing
to plead guilty in event no larger fine
than $10 in each cape was imposed for
the offense committed. Judge Campbell
refused to consider the proposition, and
the result was that the cases were heard
and all the prisoners dismissed. This ac
tion on the part of Judge Campbell goes
to prove the untruth of the report regard
ing Sergeant McDonald, and that official
will continue to assign the cases and Ser
geant Shea will continue to give the casea
to assign.

Threatened Shortage in the Funds of

The Teachers' Annuity Fund Associa

fifteen teachers on the pension roll de
pending on the funds of the association
for support and that there were three
more teachers whose terms of service en

The belief was expressed that the pres

resources and that other means must be
found to increase the income. Further
consideration was deferred until a future

PREPARING FOR A GRAND CELEBRATION
The celebration of St. Patrick's day this year will be one of the
most Imposing ever held in this city. The committee having the ar
rangements in hand will leave nothing undone to make it one that will
commemorate the gallant Wolf Tone and the patron saint of the Emer
ald Isle. The entire proceeds erf the two projected entertainments will
be turned over to the "98 Monument Association" as the contribution
of San Francisco toward the erection of a monument in memory of
Wolf Tone.
Jeremiah Mahoney, president of the Monument Association, will visit
Ireland early In the summer, and take with him the proceeds of the
celebration, together with the funds now being collected in this city by
popular subscription.
Never in the history of San Francisco was there such harmony ex
isting among the Irish-American societies as at present. With the ex
ception of the County Leitrim Club, which intends holding a celebra
tion of its own, all of the local Irish- American societies have sent rep
resentatives to the St. Patrick's Day Convention.
The convention is composed of representative citizens who have but
one idea in view, and that is success. Not a few of them are at a
loss to their private interests, devoting much time in arranging the de
tails of a celebration that will find a prominent place in the history of
the local Irish-American societies. It is their idea to make St. Patrick's
day one that will be long remembered, and at the same time bring a
generous contribution to the Wolf Tone monument fund.
There will be an entertainment at Woodward's Pavilion in the aft
ernoon and another in the evening. The afternoon programme will con
sist of stereopticon views of Ireland, Irish jig dancing and songs and
recitations. M. M. Estee will deliver an oration In the evening, and
Professor Hickey of St. Ignatius College will read a poem appropriate
to the occasion. The remainder of the evening programme will be coiv
tributed by professional taJent from the leading theaters of the city.
THE BASF FKAXCTSCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 5, 1898.
THE DISABLED GUNBOAT PINTA.
TO BRING IN
THE BUYERS
Successful Movement of
Last Fall Will Be Re
peated This Month.
Free Return Tickets From
Here Offered Country
Merchants.
ManufactvirerÃ* and Wholesalers'
League Expects a Throng
of Applicants.
The success of the annex movement
of the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association of California In bringing
buyers to the city last fall has encour
aged another and similar effort, which
will be inaugurated on the 16th of this
month. It will be known as the Man
ufacturers' and "Wholesalers' League,
and while differing in some details
from the previous plan, it will be on a
broader and more liberal basis.
The Call reviewed the autumn move
ment fully at the time, when it was
shown that the merchants of San
Francisco who had participated in it
had been benefited largely at a trifling
cost, and that it had accomplished
much in the advertising of thÂ£ city as
a depot for manufacturing supplies and
merchandise, superior to the Eastern
market. It was the activity of Eastern
drummers that caused the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association to
cast about for some way to stop the
diversion of trade from this city and to
induce the buyers of the coast and ad
joining States to recognize the advan
tages offered here.
Now the buyers are to be given a re
turn ticket to their homes free, as last
time, but a wider territory is to be cov
ered and a much more extended list
of local houses will be embraced in the
directory of firms, from any of whom
goods may be purchased to secure the
ticket. Transportation is offered over
more roads and a more pliant and at
tractive agreement made with the in
tending travelers.
The management of the Manufactur
ers' and Wholesalers' League has been
at work for several months perfecting
the arrangements for the present cam
paign and obtaining the necessary
concessions from the railroad and
steamship companies. Strong efforts
were made to increase the member
ship of the league above that of last
fall, and the directory indicates a rep
resentative body of the prominent and
energetic larger dealers of the city.
Among the lines are: Agricultural im
plements, bags and tents, belting, bi
cycles, books, boots and shoes, ladies'
shoes, brass and foundry goods, candy
manufacturers, carpets and house fur
nishings, chairs and rattan ware,
cloths and trimmings, coal, cordage,
crockery and glassware, dairy and
farming implements, drugs, fancy
goods, furniture, gentlemen's furnish
ing goods, guns, ammunition and
sporting goods, groceries, hardware,
harness and leather, iron and steel,
jewelry manufacturers, lithographers
and engravers, lumber, machinery, mil
linery and straw goods, paints and oils,
pickles and preserves, picture frames,
printing, provisions and dairy produce,
rubber goods, salt, school and office
furniture, seeds and plants, silk thread,
silks and tailors' goods, stationery,
stoves and ranges, terra cotta and
pressed brick, trunks and bags, toys
and notions, window glass, wines and
liquors, wire and wire rope, wood and
willow ware, Yankee notions and smok-
ing materials.
Ezra W. Keeler, the special repre
sentative of the association, is in charge
of the league, which is under the su
pervision of Edward Everett, chairman
of the executive committee. Mr. Keel
er says that the different branches of
trade desirable to be reached are taken
from Bradstreet's and other commercial
agents' records, while the experience of
last year has already given a valuable
list of buyers who may be brought here
if properly approached.
The time limit of the offer is from
March 16 to April 16. Buyers are re
quired to have one of the league blanks
signed by the transportation agent
from whom they purchase their ticket,
and to register on arrival at the office
of the league, in the Mills building.
They must have bought goods to an
amount In excess of twenty times the
cost of a return ticket from the mem
bers of the league. The ticket given to
buyers is first class, and the travel is
limited from and to stations located up
on the Southern Pacific Company's
roads west of El Paso and Ogden; Port
land and south of Portland, Ore., the
San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley
Railroad, Santa Fe Pacific, west of Al
buquerque, and Southern California
Railway, and Pacific Coast Steamship
Line, viz.:
Between Pan Francisco and San Die
go and all way ports of call. San Fran
cisco and ports of call in Mexico as fol
lows viz.: Ensenada and San Jose del
Cabo, Mazatlan, La Paz. Guaymas. San
Francisco and Victoria, B. C, Port
Townsend, Seattle and Tacoma. San
Francisco and Eureka (Humboldt Bay,
Cal.)
It is expected that the cost to the
members will be less than 2 per cent on
sales, as the expense of the return tick
ets is divided among the members pro
rata according to the Â£~oss of each
firm's saU'S to out-of-tcrwn buyers. To
each of these will be presented a cloth
bound directory, now being got out
by the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association, which gives a concise
statement of all the interests of Cali
fornia, and makes a powerful plea for
home products and industries.
CHARGED WITH
EMBEZZLEMENT
Attorney Burnette G. Haskell
Arrested on the Complaint
of a Client.
Jesse T. Tate, Executor of an Estate,
Wanted for Getting Away With
the Funds.
Attorney Burnette G. Haskell was ar
rested yesterday on two complaints
charging him with embezzlement. He was
released on his own recognizance by
Judge Joachimsen.
The complaining witness !s Noble Fisher
of Sacramento, who alleges that he held
a mortgage on the steamer Thomas
Dwyer. About seven months ago he em-
I ployed Haskell to foreclose on the mort
j gage and the steamer was put up for
! sale. Haskell bought her In his own
name and immediately sold her again for
$4000. He got $1675 in coin and took a
mortgage on her for the balance of $2325.
Fisher repeatedly applied for an account
ing without avail, and finally he brought
suit in Judge Hebbard's court for the re
turn of the original mortgage. Ho got
Judgment, but Haskell appealed to the
Supreme Court, and the case is still pend-
The particular charges on which Has
kell has been arrested are for embezzling
$945 on September 1 last, and for em
bezzling $250 on September 7.
Another case of embezzlement will be
heard in Judge Conlan's court. Yesterday
! Attorney F. W. Van Reynegom swore to
a complaint charging Jesse T. Tate, ex
ecutor of the estate of Caroline Taber,
with embezzling $1969. The money was
given Tate on August 6 last during the
progress of the proceedings in the Pro
bate Court, and it is alleged that he spent
It all recklessly on his own pleasures.
Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Hogan
took two days to Investigate the matter,
but he was so satisfied of the facts that
he willingly issued he complaint yeÃter
day.
AN ATTORNEY'S RUSE.
George Hayford Wanted for Obtain
ing Money by False Pretenses.
Attorney George Hayford, who some
months ago received such a severe verbal
castigation from Judge Conlan, Is wanted
by the police on a charge of obtaining
money by false pretenses.
The complaining witness is William
Allen proprietor of the Ralston restau
rant, '783 Market street. On February 12
Hayford partook of a meal in his restau
rant, and in payment gave him a check
on the Union Trust Company for J5, re
ceiving the change. \N hen Allen present
ed the check at the bank it was marked
"not sufficient funds. He was told that
Hayford had 45 cents at his credit for
some time, and he had been asked repeat
edly to withdraw it, as several people
had presented checks for small amounts
which could not be honored . *
The police ascertained that Hayford has
been giving checks to several people in
the same way as to Allen, and they ad
vised htm to swear to the warrant for
his arrest. ..
Hayford was arrested some months ago
for swindling Mrs. Susan Cunningham, a
widow, who had placed some money In
his hands for investment. He was held
to answer before the Superior Court by
Judge Conlan, but managed to beat the
case.
Superior Judges In Bank.
Superior Judges Wallace, Cook and
Dunne sat in bank yesterday morning
and disposed of two appeals from the
Police Court. John J. Coffey, the attor
ney appeared and sought to have the
Judgment of the lower court reversed,
which found him guilty of threatening to
have Fred Nobmann arrested on a charge
of perjury if the latter refused to pay
him $150. The judgment was affirmed and
Coffey was given tlve days in which to
settle the fine imposed by the lower court.
$150 In case the fine is not paid by that
[time the attorney must go to Jail.
LADY CYCLISTS
ARE INSULTED
Experience of Mrs. White
and Mrs. Higgins
in the Park-
Peter Gallagher and Thomas
Dolan Arrested on Their
Complaint.
Judge Campbell so Incensed at Their
Conduct That He Raises Their
Bonds to $1000.
Judge Campbell seems determined to
make an example of two men who ap
peared before him yesterday morning
to answer to a charge of using vulgar
language to two ladies.
Thursday afternoon Mrs. E. I*
White, 1418 Grove street, and Mrs.
Florence Higgins, 617 Lyon street, who
are enthusiastic bicyclists, went out
to the park to enjoy a ride on their
wheels. When they reached the end
of the speed track they dismounted
and sat chatting on a bench.
While there two men In a buggy
drove up to them and began to inter
rupt their conversation. The ladies re
fused to recognize their presence for
some time, which angered them, and
they let loose on them a shower of ex
pletives that made the ladies cover
their ears with their hands. They
continued their persecution till the
ladies became thoroughly incensed,
and they threatened to have them ar
rested. The men laughed at them and
drove off with a parting shot of filthy
abuse.
The ladies mounted their bicycles
and followed the buggy till they met ,
Park Policeman Kavanaugh. They
hurriedly told him of the manner in
which they had been insulted, and
pointed to the two men in the buggy j
which was being driven at a break- j
neck speed. Kavanaugh put spurs to
his horse, and, after a chase of a con
siderable distance, overtook the buggy
and called upon the occupants to stop.
They reluctantly did so, and Kavan
augh placed them under arrest. They
were taken from the buggy and sent to
the City Prison, where a charge of
using vulgar language was booked
against them. They were unable to
give bail, and spent the night in the
prison. They gave their names as
Peter Gallagher, a blacksmith, and
Thomas Dolan, a soapmaker.
Yesterday morning the cases were
called in Judge Campbell's court. The
two ladies were present and swore to
complaints charging the two men with
using vulgar language toward them.
"When the cases were called the Juuge
was impressed with the appearance of
the ladies. He asked them what was
the natuFe of the case, and when they
told him of the language used toward
them his whiskers shook with sup
pi essed anger.
The defendants said they were not
ready to proceed, and asked for a con
tinuance. The Judge continued the
cases till Monday, and staggered the j
defendants by announcing that he !
would fix their bonds in $1000 each. |
The two defendants were taken back
to the prison, and there is small chance
of their being released on bonds. They
were considerably crestfallen at the |
action of the Judge.
PROBABLY A SUICIDE.
Alfred Barwick, a Soldier of the
Salvation Army, Found Dead in
Bed With Morphine.
"Was Alfred Barwick a morphine fiend,
or did he buy the drug for the purpose
of committing suicide?
The vial of morphine pills found at his
bedside yesterday in his room at 836 Com
mercial "street, when the Coroner*^ depu
ties called for the purpose of removing his
body to the Morgue, originally contained
100 "pills of one-quarter grain each, but
there were not more than fifty or sixty
of the pills left.
The appearance of the corpse was that
of a man who had died from morphine
poisoning. Four of these pills would be
fatal If taken by a person unaccustomed
to the use of the drug. The deceased left
no writing behind him throwing any light
on the subject of his death; whether it
was accidental or suicidal. He was a
member of the Salvation Army, and noth
ing unusual had been noticed about his
manner by his associates.
The deceased was a native of Canada,
about 40 years old, and was a cook by
occupation. The contents of the stom
ach were taken In charge by Chemist
Morgan of the Morgue. â¢
Who Owns the Purse.
Mrs. Moos, 529 A Hayes street, found a
purse In her baby's carriage yesterday
afternoon, which she turned over to the
police. The carriage had been left In the
hallway while the front door was open,
and some person passing had evidently
thrown the purse Into It. As the purse
was empty, the police believe that It had
been stolen from the owner and thrown
Into the carriage by the thief after being
rifled of its content?. The purse is a
valuable one. and has the name "Mrs.
Jones" In gold letters on it.
THE CAUSE OF DYSPEPSIA
From the Republican. Pcranton, Pa.
The most common of all human ail
ments is deranged digestion; the most ag
gravating disease inherited by man, dys
pepsia.
The primary cause of dyspepsia is lack
of vitality; the absence of nerve force;
the loss of the life-sustaining elements
of the blood.
No organ can properly perform Its
functions when the source of nutriment
fails. When the stomaoh Is robbed of the
nourishment demanded by nature, as
similation ceases, unnatural gases are
generated; the entire system responds to
the discord.
A practical illustration of the symp
toms and torture of dyspepsia Is furnished
by the case of Joseph T. Vandyke, 440
Hickory street. Scran ton, Pa.
In teiyng his story, Mr. Vandyke says:
"Five years ago I was afflicted with a
trouble of the stomach, which was very
aggravating. I had no appetite, could not
enjoy myself at any time, and especially
was the trouble severe when I awoke in
the morning. I did not know what the
ailment was, but it became steadily worse
and I was in constant misery.
"I called in my family physician, and
he diagnosed the case as catarrh of tne
stomach. He prescribed for me, and I
had his prescription filled. I took pearly
all of the medicine, but still the trouble
became worse, and I felt that my condi
tion was hopeless. I tried several reme
dies recommended by my friends, but with
out benefit. After I had been suffering
several months, Thomas Campbell, also a
resident of this cÂ»cy, urged me to try Dr.
Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People.
"He finally persuaded me to buy a box,
and I began to use the pills according to
directions. Before I had taken the second
box I began to feel relieved, and after
taking a few more boxes I considered
myself restored to health. The pills gave
me new life, strength, ambition and hap
niness."
Dr Williams' Pink Pills cure dyspepsia
by restoring to the blood the requisite
constituents of life, by renewing the
nerve force and enabling the stomach to
promptly and properly assimilate the
food These pills are a specific for all
diseases having their origination in im
poverished blood or disordered nerves.
They contain every element requisite to
general nutrition to restore strength to
[ the weak, good health to the ailing.

LIVELY TIMES
FOR
COLLEGE MEN.
The genial warmth of early spring has
len. its Influence to college athletics. At
both the colleges there is now an activity
on the diamond and track that presages
a most successful and interesting season.
With a little more than a month to per
fect his physical condition, the college
athlete is working earnestly and assid
uously to make a place on the team
which will represent his alma mater in
the lists. * . -
Early in the week there came from r'alo .
Alto a wall of mourning that set the
dead a-wee P ing. John Brunton, sprinter,
record-breaker, track captain, on whose
prowess as a male Atlantis Stanford
students would bank their all. has been
obliged to quit the university for at least
a month, on account of the illness of his
father Brunton may return, but his
time for training before the spring games
will be limited to the smallest margin.
It is a lamentable fact that Stanford
is to lose the best efforts of their idonzed
sprinter, for with i>runton in the best
condition and Drum of California in the
same race, a contest of winged feet would
bo seen such as is seldom presented on
California tracks. Brunton was first ad
vanced as a 440-yard runner of wonderful
achievements. His sway was undisputed
until he met Drum last year, and then
the refulgence of Brunton's glory was
dimmed. Brunton's special event is now
the short sprints. It is a great pity that
Drum will not be tested in all these
events, for he Is a young man with but
a season of collegiate training, and his
natural abilities as a sprinter are such
that improve with steady application in
an unparalleled degree. _
Blrtch is the understudy of Brunton.
but he cannot supply the necessary ma
terial to supply the aching void. He has
not been training regularly showing a
laxity in this respect anything but en
couraging for the Cardinals' chances in
the sprints. It was thought that a
sprinter of ability was discovered in
Weatherwax. but he also has displayed
evidences of reinissness which, if con
tinued, will place him hors dv combat.
The old men of last year's Stanford
team are training faithfully. Mot anight
escapes them, and their work is improv
ing steadily. Walker, temporary track
captain, is the most arduous and enthu
siastic of all the track men, although
Dole and Morgan are not less faithful
:to the trust placed in their hands.
. Fiekert seems to be the only star among
the weight men. Stanford needs an in
fusion of new blood into the weight ag
gregation, or else Fickert will have^ a
burden to bear which even his mighty
* h Ãn d tÂ£ mond SU P cÂ° r Cardlnal has at
last realized its decline, and now efforts
are being mad* to reattain its former
Supremacy. Last Saturday, at Central
Park Stanford played a game of ball
that Would make the ordinary indifferent
and callous spectator shudder with hor
ror Some good resulted from It, for now
earnest practice is in force The fight
for positions on the nine which will be
ultimately picked to -represent the col
lege still continues. A new pitcher has
â developed at Palo Alto. Wrigley, a fresh
man has been doing some good work
lately. On Thursday he pitched his first
match game against the Santa Claras,
and Judging from his performance in
that initial effort, he gives promise of
wearing the big S when Stanford lines
"it^Birkelev'cocllran has taken charge
of the baseball and a new order of things
has been introduced. The men get on the
field at 4 o'clock sharp. There is no dally
ing or straggling, for Mr. Cochran is not
that kind of a man. At first general field
ing work is practiced for half an hour.
Then a regular practice game of three
innings' length is played. After that
Cochran has the men line up in their po
sitions, and sharp field practice, with the
ball ever on the move from hand to hand,
completes the day's work for the baseball
men. Cochran appears in baseball togs
and many new wrinkles has he already
shown his pupils. He is assisted by
"Chappie" Smith, also of Princeton, and a
close friend of Cochran.
On the track California improves with
every hour. The candidates for positions
of honor on the track team are numerous
and they are working morning and after
noon. The sophomore-freshman field day
next Saturday is attracting more atten
tion than interclass affairs ordinarily do.
no doubt on account of the rare material
in both classes and the intense rivalry be
tween them in matters athletic. The en
tries show the best available stuff In the
two lower classes. As this will be the first
event of the year on the track much spec
ulation is rife on records and results.
At Central Park this afternoon the
Alumni nine, whose chief distinctive char
acteristic is the possession of a record
which for cleanliness in defeat is un
equaled, will cross bats with the Univer
sity of California team. The Alumni will
play Krug In the box. This will be the
first time the California team will appear
In public since Cochran has had it in
charge. In the Alumni team are two or
three players adjudged professionals and
there is some talk about the college nine's
refusing to play them. The Athletic As
sociation has the matter under considera
tion and may decide to issue their ban.
Should the college nines disobey there is
a possibility that the association will de
cree their professionalism. However, the
game to-day will be played. If necessary
the proceeds will go to charity and an ex
hibition game be played to come within
the pale of the law. The nines will line
up as follows;
California. Position. Alumni.

Collins.. First base Allen
McLaren Second base. . Follansbee
Foster or
McCabe Shortstop Lewis
Baer rhird base McKee

This is the strongest nine the Alumni
have ever got together and the game
should be an improvement on* its pre
cursors.
BASKET BALL IS
NOJDHILD'S PLAY.
The greatest game of basket ball in the
present tournament between the San
Francisco and the Oakland teams was the
one played last Thursday evening In the
gymnasium of the Y. M. C. A. of this city.
It was the game between the Athens from
across the bay and the Rushers, the local
team. The Athens were declared winners
by a final score of 14 to 13 points in their
favor.
In the first half the Rushers put up one
of the finest games ever seen on this
coast. They entered the battle with great
courage and gave the Athens more to do
than they could attend to, because the
Rushers scored In the first twenty min
utes 12 points on goals from the Held and
1 point on a foul; while the Athens made
5 points only.
As it has happened In the majority of
the games recently played, a marvelous
change took place when the players were
called out for the second half. The Ath
ens pulled up wonderfully, scored point
for point, tied the Rushers and won the
game yet, though by a very small mar
gin.
It would hardly be right to make special
mention of the individual plays or play
ers, as the game was an exhibition of the
finest team work on both sides. There
was splendid passing and some phenom
enal goal throwing, although the result is
not so clearly seen by the score. The in
terference was too strong for any such
showing. In fact, the interference was so
strong that it resulted in some rough
play, which ought to be censured here.
Quite a number of fouls were called and
the number was by no means too great.
All the players were in it to win and all
did their level best. They can glory, how
ever, in the honor of having taken part in
one of the greatest games yet played.
The following names were entered for
the game by the captains of the teams:
Rushers. Position. Athens.
F. L. Shaw.... Forward... J. Lancaster
E L- Spacher Forward F. Bock
Ed Fleischer.. Center W. B. West
D Hanrahan.. Guard H. Muller
C Johnson Guard. .F. Le Ballister
Substitutes: Rushersâ W. H. Mitchell;
Athensâ F. J. Edwards.
The officers of the game were: Referee,
8. C. Bennetts; umpires, Otto Kurtz and
C. J. Anzer; scorer, R. Homer; timer, H.
8. Morton. Time, twenty-minute halves^
THE FIELD OF SPORT
CYCLING RACES,
MEETINGS
AND BASEBALL.
At the urgent request of the Garden
City Wheelmen, the regular monthly
meeting of the board of governors of the
California Associated Cycling Clubs will
be held at San Jose this evening instead
of in this city. The delegates will go
down on the 2:30 train this afternoon, al
though some will probably make the trip
awheel, as the roads on the Oakland
side of the bay are said to be in the pink
of condition.
The purpose of the G. C. W. In re
questing the honor of entertaining the
delegates is that they may be present
at the festivities of the club to-night at
tendant upon the formal presentation of
the trophy and prizes won by the club's
riders in the recent twenty-five-mile in
ter-club roadrace.
The Garden City's man, "Bunt" Smith,
it will be remembered, won both time
and place honors in this roadrace, and
also the Olympic cup. Besides the
entertainment to-night the club will ban
quet the twenty odd members who par
ticipated in the race, some time next
week. Out of a membership of only a
hundred, the captain expects over forty
riders in the relay try-outs next month.
Two games of the Cycle Baseball
League series will be played in San Jose
to-morrow, and a large delegation will
go down from this city to witness them.
The Olympic Wheelmen will take on the
Turn Verein Cyclers, and the Olympic
Cyclers will play the Garden City Wheel
men. The Olympic Cyclers are leaders
in the tournament, with 1000 per cent, and
have yet to be defeated.
The baseball teams will take the 8:io
boat and narrow gauge route to San
Jose. Most of the "rooters" will also go
down this way, although a number of
them will wheel down, taking the 8 a. m.
broad gauge boat, led by Captain \\ 11
liam Loos, O. C. W.
There is some talk of matching "Bunt
Smith, John E. Wing and Tony Delmas
for a twftity-Uve-mile traekrnce at Klm
hurst. each man to furnish his own pac
ing, some time next month.
John E. Alexander, the old-time rac
ing man of San Jose, is the latest of the
wheeling fraternity to get the Klondike
fever, and has already left for the north.
The Bay City Wheelmen and the Re
liance Club Wheelmen baseball teams will
cross bats at the Velodrome to-morrow at
12 o'clock. The Acme and Encinal clubs
will play across the bay.
There will be a race meet at Vallejo on
Sunday', March IS, at which G. H. Crafts
and John E. Edwards will have a return
match at 30 miles, paced. Several local
amateur events will be interspersed in the
programme. I think, however, the man
agement has made a mistake in not put
ting on a couple of good amateur handi
caps open to all corners, as an attraction
to the riders here. The people of Vallejo
will not go to see the men of their own
town race against each other, but they
would go to see them race against the
cracks of this city, San Jose ami Oakland.
It is also a mistake, considering the cha
otic condition of cycle racing on this coast
at present, to attempt to give two meets
on the same day within fifty miles of each
other, and that is what Is being done, as
the same managers have a big meet
scheduled for the 13th also at Elmhurst.
It is the intention of the Elmhurst man
agement on this day to have a team race
between members from the Reliance and
Acme clubs of Oakland, in the hope of
reviving some of the old-time rivalry,
and, incidentally, antagonism. The Re
liance Club will put in Deacon, Wyman,
Gooch and Rosenheim, probably, and the
Acme men have not yet been selected.
The distance will be five miles, for a cup
offered by the Haywards electric road,
and must be won twice to secure owner
ship.
The high jinks given by the Olympic
Club Wheelmen last Saturday night was
one of the best of its kind ever held by
a cycling club here. The entertainment
was high class, the refreshments plentiful
and good, and the large crowd or wheel
men present passed a very enjoyable
evening. President Mullen and the com- i
mittee in charge, including Master of I
Ceremonies Howard P. Taylor Jr., are
certainly deserving of a great deal of
credit for the handsome manner in which
the affair was carried out.
T. S. Gore, a prominent wheelman of
Victoria, B. C, is in the city on a visit,
and is stopping at the Occidental. Mr'
Gore is an English gentleman and an
enthusiastic rider. Intending to visit the
southern part of the State, he thought he â¢
would ride there from here, but does not
want to go alone. Mr. Gore would like
to know of any gentleman contemplating
that trip within a week or two. While
in this city Mr. Gore is being entertained i
by ex-President Swain and other proml- j
nent C. A. C. C. officials.
The absence of a local cycle show or in- !
door race meet Is being sadly felt here !
by the riders and dealers this year. For !
the previous three years the season has
opened w r ith the Washington's birthday
road-race on February 22, and the in
door tournament at the Pavilion directly j
afterward. We have had the road-race, I
but no tournament, and no prospects of
any, and the trade is dull and the riders
idle in consequence. Much as the deal
ers were wont to scoff when told of the
advertising benefits derived indirectly
from a show or tournament, they cannot

deny that what promised to be a busy
season has had a very inauspicious open
ing for want of this "ad." It is their own
fault, however, because to be successful
an indoor tournament must have
the support of the dealers and other ex
hibitors, and they have given the cold
shoulder to all advances in that direc

SOUTH ENDS AND
ARIELS TO PLAY BALL.
The South Ends and the Ariels are
making great preparations for their base
ball game, which is to be played a week
from to-morrow.
New life Is gradually being infused into
the Ariels. The success of their base
ball team has made them anxious to re
gain their laurels lost in rowing. In
anticipation of an early regatta, crews
have been selected from their best ma
terial and no time has been lost in get
ting the boys down to work. The new
SOME NOTABLE CELEBRITIES OF THE PRESENT RACING SEASON.
Junior crew, rivals of the Turners, went
out last Sunday and braved some rather
troublesome water. In fact, it was the
only crew that had the temerity to
do so. This has made old "Uncle" Flan
dere happier than he has been for some
time, for he has found a crew of willing
workers.
The new Senior crew has been finally
selected and will take its initial spin to
morrow. Captain Ellis has had all the
boats put in excellent condition and
everything Is in readiness for a success
ful season. As yet no date has been
fixed for the club regatta, but It will un
doubtedly take place in the latter part of
April.
R. B. Cornell, who claims to be the
champion rough water swimmer of Amer
ica, states in a communication to this
department that he is ready to swim A.
W. Rapp a race around the Seal Rocks
at any time after the first of March for
a side bet of from $100 to $500.
Ah Sing Died.
Ah Sing, the Chinaman who fell off a
precipice on Telegraph Hill last Monday,
died in the City and County Hospital last
Thursday evening. Sing was conscious
when taken to the hospital and told the
internes that he was wandering about Jn
the dark and that he accidentally fell
off.
A "KICK" THAT
WAS NOT
WITHOUT RESULTS
Peace reigns supreme again in the In
gleside Association. Stockholder Sink
scored his point. The disgruntled finan
cier, after his "kick" registered
through the columns of The Call,
was summoned by letter to ap
pear before the officials of the
Pacific Coast Jockey Club, where a sooth
ing lotion was applied by Secretary Green
et a!. Mr. Sink was assured that Ed
Corrigan had been requested to bottle up
his witty package of jokes about his fel
low men until St. Patrick's day, 1901, and
Mr. Sink himself was implored to desist
BRIGHT DAYS
FOR
TENNIS PLAYERS.
There is genuine revival in tennis. To
appreciate this one has but to go out to
the California Tennis Club courts any af
ternoon, and there ho will see not only
a new generation of racket enthusiasts,
but also a return of the old to the beaten
tracks. It is the same in Oakland and
in Southern California. Everywhere a re
newed Interest In the snort is mani
fested and invitation tournaments are h*
ing organized in several of the interior
cities.
At the California club last week doubles
| took precedence of singles. Society, now
i that it is Lent, is indulging itself with a
breath or two of fresh air and the
younger set finds the tennis courts the
host enjoyable molifler of the severities
imposed by the Lenten season. "Within
two weeks then- will be a ladies' doubles
tournament which will bring out ;i bevy
of debutantes and their younger sisters.
The courts are crowded nightly In prepar
ation for thts tourney.
During the week some close and Inter
esting matches were played. Daly and
Walter beat Root and B'llven, 6â2, 6â3,
Câ 3. Mihs Bowman and Miss Hunter beat
Clark and Den sort, 6â2, 4â i, 6â 3. 6â4.
Though there were no deuce all games in
the sets the playing was of a lively and
close character. Ogden Hoffman ami \V.
L. Holmes hit it off merrily early in the
week, but the placing and driving of the
former were too much for his vis-a-vis,
who succumbed in straight sets.
Bliven and Walter, in a match of sin
gles on Tuesday, quit even with a set
apiece. Bradshaw beat Dick Adams 6â4,6 â 4,
7â5, 6 â i. In a four handed match be
tween Miss Alice Hoffman and Miss
Moody against Miss Curry and Miss
Drown four sets were played, but the
match was left undecided, each team win
ning alternate sets. In mixed doubles
Ogden Hoffman and Miss Drown defeated
Miss Alice Hoffman and W. L. Holmes
two out of three sets. The Magee broth
ers, Walter and Tom, are often seen on
the courts playing doubles. Walter has
gone back in his playing, but with prac
tice will regain his old form.
George Whitney, who has by steady ap
plication mounted the tennis ladder until
he now stands on the uttermost height, |
says that he intends to retire from the
fight for honors. Hereafter he will de
vote himself tq the game only as an ex
ercise and will not enter tournaments or
sweat for prizes. Championship and all
its concomitants no longer possess any
charm for the younger Whitney. Rob
Whitney is still in the ring.
Bifle Shooting.
The great spring shooting festival of
the California Schuetzen Club will be held
on Sunday, April 17, at the club's grounds
near San Rafael. The prizes will consist
of $300 in cash and JIOOO In honorary
prizes.
from rushing to the press for justice.
He was advised to hold on to his stock,
and that in future everything possible
would be done to make the relations ex
isting ami >ng Mr. Sink, Mr. Corrigan
and the club as amicable as was possible.
Mr. Sink appears satisfied. The incipi
ent revolution has been squelched without
resource to arms, and Ed Corrigan still
plays the role of dictator and pursues
the even tenor of his way. The officials
of the association are a trifle "new" at
the game, and so were easily pacified.
Mr. Sink says he has received a good
offer for his stock, and thinks he will
sell. When he looks about and sees scores
of horses neighing for one good feed of
oats, their owners looking around for a
meal ticket, and two or three favored in
dividuals winning most of the races, he
may change his mind. The two racing
associations can be compared to a game
of stud-horse pokerâ if the game holds
on long enough the "kitty" gets all the
coin.
If all rumors can be believed, there are
several horsemen sojourning in Califor
nia this winter who will in future give
the Golden West a wide berth. Their
"kick" is apparently not at the California
Jockey Club, whose destinies are presided
over by Tom Williams, but the club with
in a stone's throw of the broad Pacific.
In his career on the turf, Dave Gideon
has owned some notable turf celebrities,
including among them Butterflies, piloted
to victory In the Futurity by Henry Grif
fin. In speaking of some of the decisions
rendered by the stewards, Mr. Gideon
said:
"I can't agree with officials suspending
owners for sixty days. They are either
guilty and should be ruled off the turf,
or else they are innocent of wrong-doing."
These words arc certainly well timed.
In reconsidering the cases of W. J. Spiers,
the owner of Santello; Nolan & Tholl,
owners of Also Ran. and "Curley"
Shields, in whose colors Joe Terry ran,
the stewards reduced the period of sus
pension somewhat. Why did they do so?
When Little Cripple beat Don Clarencio
and The Bachelor one day at Ingleside,
and it was freely reported that the in
side mon^y was played on Don Clarencio,
Judge Murphy notified the members ot
the press that the entry of Little Cripple
would in future be refused. The next
day the press was notified that the entry
nl' Little Cripple would be accepted. The
brother of the gelding's owner is a Super
visor.
Mr. Gideon, while not mentioning the
latter little Incident, said that during his
long career on the turf he had never been
i called before the stewards. He spoke in
! glowing terms of the California turf, and
said that It was to. be regretted if men
had become identified with the turf here
whose presence was inimical to its best
interests.
The case of the Australian mare Trance
is puzzling in the extreme. Her owner, J.
15. Lewis, feels that he has been most
harshly treated. It appears to be a most
| complicated mixtureâ the whole thingâ
I hough it really seems as though the
stewards of the Pacific CoaÂ»t Jockey Club
might reinstate the mare, as her owner is
j anxious to sell, and let him depart for his
home in the Antipodes.
Ed Corrigan, in an interview published
in a morning paper, said that he had
never requested the secretary to make up
a race for one of his horses. During the
meeting that cornea to a close to-day the
Hawthorne turfnuui's horses have won
fifteen races, not including to-day's
events With only an ordinary string, he
has been singularly fortunate. Most of
the steeplechase events have either been
won by his or Andy Blakeley'a jumpers,
i and the writer has no hesitancy in saying
that favoritism has been shown â ajid this
I goes if he hears it. On Thursday it was
common gossip among the different own
ers that the final race of the day was at
one time as good as declared off. Through
some means four entries were induced to
I stay in, and the Corrigan horse Geyser, a
1 to 3 favorite, won easily at the end,
scoring his seventh consecutive victory.
It will be in fashion, possibly with both
| associations, about the time the meeting
j drawa to a close, to give a few "dog
races" for the benefit of the "poor own
ers." It is the public and those same poor
j owners that keep the game running, and
! if they are wise the management of the

WHY THE COAST
STREAMS
NEED STOCKING.
According to the present conditions of
water and weather anglers should meet
with tolerably fair success to-day and to
morrow in the tide waters of coast
streams.
Reports from Sonoma and Point Reyes
which were received during the week
stated that the creeks were running bank
high on Monday last, but that the water
has receded very rapidly since then and
that the prospects for fishing to-morrow
are good.
Doubtless a number of anglers will put
in an appearance at Point Reyej; and
Shellville this evening.
For some weeks prior to the late storm
the residents of Alvarado have been
catching large steelheads In the tide
waters of Alameda Creek by means
of nets and spears. The attention of the
j Fish Commissioners was called to this
fact and Deputy Cross paid a visit to a
slough near Alvarado, where the fishes
were lodged in deep pools. He discovered
that nets had been used for the capture
of the fishes, and before leaving the depu
ty notified the people who were fishing
unlawfully that if they persisted In net
ting or spearing steelheads the commis
sioners would make thvir sport cost them
more than they had bargained for.
As this has been a singularly poor
year for the breeding fishes to propagate
their species above tide waters, and as
the prospects for summer fishing look
anything but favorable, it is hoped that
the Fish Commissioners will not forget
to replenish the coast streams by stock
ing them liberally and intelligently this
year with the fry of either the Rainbow
Cutthroat, Loch Levin or brown trout '
In previous seasons the fry we're
dumped carelessly into the deep pools of
the Paper Mill and Sonoma Creeks much
to the pleasure of the large and predatory
hsh, whicn waxed fat and strong by
messing on the innocents.
The announcement that 50,000 fry were
placed in Paper Mill Creek last year by
Deputy So-and-so may appear Quite
pleasing to the angling fraternity, and
also to the Governor in the biennial re
port of the Commissioners; but unless
the fry are properly planted it is only
a waste of time and expense to stock any
stream. Commissioners Vogelsang and
Emeric are not blind to this fact; but it
is never too late to mend.
GOOD COURSING
AT TWO PARRS.
Lovers of the grand old sport of cours
ing can select either of the two parksâ |
Union or Inglesideâ for a pleasant out- !
ing on to-day and to-morrow.
The drawings for both parks have ap
peared in The Call and the wise ones
who can select the winners of the all
aged stake at either park can safely hang i
up a sign with the words, "Tips for Sale"
written thereon.
Sportsmen who have made a study of '
the sport of the leash and who have at
tended the meetings held on Saturdays
and Sundays can name three-fourths "of i
the winners of the first round but It is *
in the subsequent rounds that the tin- i
sters generally fall by the wayside be
cause the inferior dogs are weeded out
in the first and second rounds leaving i
the "cracks" to contest for the golden
eagles.
There are a number of high-class dogs
entered to run at both parks to-day and
doubtless a large and enthusiastic crowd
of pleasure-hunters will witness the
sport.

SHARKEY STATES
THAT HE

Joe Choynski. the popular California
heavyweight pugilist, will have another
opportunity on Friday evening, the 11th
inst to whip Tom Sharkey, the power
lul Irishman who boxed a draw with
Chovnski that he has instructed all of his
friends to bet on him. _
"When I last met Choynski in the Pa- ;

mittee has a very poor knowledge of tlia
rules which govern amateur athletics. â 
The applications of the National and
Occidental clubs for boxing permits were
denied. The Jefferson Athletic Club was
given permission to hold monthly exhibi
tions at its club room. !,,,.3.Â»
The Olympic Club, has signed "Kin

and Henry Lewis (colored) for d ten

on the evening that Jackson will fight
Jeffries. ' 'â ' '' . "â  ' :
It is understood that if the heavy

not agree upon a referee before 2 o'clock

the Olympic Club will select a man; for

Jackson states that all he requires Is an
honest man anil that if he cannot win by
fair means he will not resort to any fo,j[
tactics. .':ic::Hm's cry is '"a fair fi.\i
and no favor," and it is to be hoped that
the referee who will be selected will be
of the same way of thinking.
Tommy Ryan will leave for his home
to-morrow evening and if ;he can see his
way clear to return to this city he will be
back again. He remarked to Billy Ken
nedy of the Olympic Club yesterday that
he was ready at any time to sign with
Walcott for a fight at catch weights, or
that he will fight Tommy West at JcO
pounds, or Dan Creedon at 158 pounds.
Ryan has about given up all idea of meet

SOMETHING ABOUT
STANFORD ATHLETES.
The Stanford college boys are looking 1
forward to a busy season in outdoor ath
letics as may be seen from the follow
ing communication:
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March 4,
1898.â Editor of The Call: The departure
of Captain Brunton, who will probably
not be able to return to college this sem
ester, has left matters on the track in.
a very bad shape. It has taken from
the sprints the one man in whom the
cardinal put its greatest trust. His place
cannot be filled in the 100 yard, 220 yard
and 440 yard events. As far as his duties
as captain of the team are concerned,
Stanford is more fortunate, for Paul
Walker the newly appointed captain, is
particularly well qualified for the posi
tion. Himself a conscientious trainer, he
expects faithful work from the men un
der his charge. He has been on the track
four years and understands his work.
An effort will be made to meet the emer
gency, caused by the loss of Brunton,
by changing around several of the men.
Dole will probably enter the 100 yard
sprint along with Birtch. Diggles will
have to go into the 220 yard and Strout
will in all likelihood be put into the quar
ter mile. Weatherwax gives promise of
doing something in the 440. Dole, Morgan,
and Culver are trying the hurdles, and
will make a strong team.
Luther Cary, the noted sprinter, was
down for the second time on Thursday.
He donned a running suit and showed
the colts how he did It when he was,
running under the Princeton colors. Al
though he is forty pounds heavier thari)
when he made his nine and four-flfthsi
record, he is still quite fleet. His efforts
so far have been directed toward getting,
the men off the mark and showing thenv
the proper form in which to run. Tom
Carroll, too, spent a few hours on Thurs
day at Stanford In coaching up the weight
men. Fickcrt is beginning to use the
double turn with the hammer, and is
showing big Improvement over his last
year's form. Burnett, the Varsity center,,
will likely be with Fickert in the' weight*

actly as it is acted at Hongkong for
the Emperor. It takes eight days to
render the play and only the prelude
was given yesterday. The play opens
with the entrance of How Mi Low
i Choo, attended by his body guards. He
â¢ bemoans the loss of his darling Tee Sin
i Su, but is comforted when a host of
I angels come to him and bring him a
son that his wife has sent him from the
i garden of flames. One of the angels
tells him that this son shall one day
conquer Sin Foo Chee, and that he is
I to be called Pow Too, meaning a pres
: ent from the Great Father, and the an
; gels further Instruct How Mi Low Choo
to wage war against Sin Foo Chee.
The great fighting general then calls
I for his horse, Moo Chi, a beautiful ani
i mal that has thirteen golden wings,
j and rides to see the Great Father,
I whom he asks to bless him. He then
I returns to earth and calls upon his
army to follow him. Sin Foo Chee
hears that How Mi Low Choo is com
ing to make war upon him, so he has
tens to meet him. He first makes Gi
Kok, the dragon, swallow Tee Sin Su,
and then changes him into a rose bush,
whereon grows one rose, which is Tee
Sin Su. Too Hi Fi. the God of Mercy,
paints the rose a deep red. a color like
unto the blush that was upon the
cheeks of Tee Sin Su when she was a
happy wife at home, and thus enables
How Mi Low Choo to recognize her.
The two generals fight, and as fast
as Sin Foo Chee and his men are killed
Lung 800, the black-tongued devil,
brings them to life. Seeing that he can
never win the battle, How Mi Low
Choo sends his son, Pow Too, to heav
en upon his horse, Moo Chi, and has
him turned into a great warrior with
twenty swords of yellow flames.
At this stage of the play the closing
time, of the fair had arrived, bo the
performance was temporarily stopped,
but will be concluded next week at the
Washington-street Theater.
The Chinese play proved to be the
chief feature in point of drawing
power, for at night the largest audi
ence that has yet been in the Pavilion
at any one time was present. The
opening night and Maine benefit at
tendance were not in It, for fully 15,000
people must have been present last
Many were no doubt attracted by
the Chinese wedding that was put on
by the actors of the Chinese troupe last
night. Ceremonially it was attended
with all the pomp and gorgeous splen
dor of the Orient.
With the intricacy of mysterious in
cantation did Quck Tiz Yee plight his
love in this world and the shade of
his spirit in the next to the rare and
radiant maiden Gum Gee. He invoked
the Great 800 Pah, the divinity of nup
tials, to smile upon his bride, and she
in turn burned the yellow lamp of
death to please the god, Tv Wy, and
thus keep from her house his black
shadow.
But the Chinese band! It broke all
records for continuous playing, and as
for volume of sound it soon routed
Bennett's musicians, whose music was
as the whisper of the night wind of
summer in comparison with a Western
tornado out on a spree. The Chinese
first discovered harmony, but they
found it when it was in its infancy, and
they have carefully kept it at that
stage where they found it.
The Battle of Gettysburg was re
peated last night.
To-night the principal feature will
be the four-round bout between Tom
Ryan and William Baker. Willie Jor
dan will referee the contest.

DEACON AND
THE WIDOW
Garret Keppel of Biggs
Made Open Con
fession.
Libeled a Lady Who Had Re
fused to Marry Him or
to Receive Him.
Had Chills and Fever in the Wagon-
Shed, He Said, and Told About
it In Print.
Deacon Garret Keppel. a respected
pioneer citizen of Biggs, Butte County,
was placed on trial yesterday before a
jury in the United States District Court
on a charge of mailing an obscene
pamphlet.
Garret got into trouble on account of
his passion for Mrs. W. S. Little, a
pretty widow of West Biggs, the town
of Biggs being big enough to have an
East and a West side. She has always
borne a good reputation, but she did
not love the deacon and he attempted
to blast it by the publication of a
pamphlet in which he purported to
confess that he had been guilty of im
proper conduct with the widow.
Ex-Senator C. W. Cross appeared for
the defendant and the Government was
represented by Deputy United States
Attorney Schlesinger.
Senator Cross' motion to quarih the j
indictment wt i quashed, and the pros- |
ecuting attorney read the pamphlet in :
full to the jury. It purported to be a i
confession of Garret Keppel made for
the good of his soul and for the placing
of himself right before God and man.
It began with an extract from a Biggs
paper relating how a certain well |
known resident (suppressing the
names) had been forcibly ejected from
the house of a certain well known
widow an evening or two before. The
pamphlet goes on to say that the man
was the deacon and that the widow
was Mrs. Little. He then proceeds to
relate that in pursuance of a request
of his dead wife, who had borne six
teen children to him, he went to a pic
nic to pick out a wife. There his criti
cal eye fell upon two widows, one of
whom was Mrs. Little and whom he
then and there determined to make his |
wife, if she would have him. So he
wrote her a note asking her for permis
sion to correspond with her. She con
sented and he began to visit her of
evenings at her house.
For some reason not made clear in
the pamphlet, probably from motives
of delicacy, the widow did not desire
to have the good deacon around when
she had company, and on occasions
when she was not alone she used to
signify that fact (according to the
pamphlet) by hanging a tomato can on j
one of the pickets of the front gate.
Then he used to go into the buggy shed
and wait in the dark for two or three
hours in a state of amorous chills and
fever between the coldness of the night
and the warmth of his passion.
Finally one evening, according to the
pamphlet road to the jury yesterday,
they got a little too loving, and the dea
To-day is also Native Sons' and
Daughters' day. and an elaborate pro
gramme has been prepared. Several
addresses will be delivered and the
singing of the national anthem will be

ment, Worthy called at Strand's office, 23 |
Kearny street, and, after some talk, paid
him $150 for a share in the business, sup

' con did not leave the house until a short
time before the dawn flushed with rose
the Eastern sky. They, were engaged
| to be married, and the deacon made it
a point to call upon the widow before
i and after camp meeting, where he was
| wont to exhort sinners to repentance.
Then, without warning, a change
came o'er the spirit of h." dream. The
tomato can was always there, and he
: was allowed to shiver in the buggy
i house while the widow was entertain
! ing company in her own cozy parlor.
j When he went to the door and demand
i ed admission he was met by a school
i ma'am, who was boarding there, and
! was told that the widow was not there
' or that she was engaged, and did not
; care about seeing him. This coldness
I was worse than that which he had ex

; made him desperate, so one evening he
entered the dwelling, lay down on the
i lounge and declared his intention of
! holding the fc-rt until the widow came
j downstairs and granted him an intpr
j view. Then help was sent for, and the
j deacon was fired bodily out of the
houso, and was roasted in the local pa
i per.
Several hundred copies o-f the pam
i phlet were distributed, and the widow
complained to the postal authorities,
who bro-ught the matter before the
United States Grand Jury, and had
i Keppel indicted for sending indecent
| literature through the mails.

leobars. 01 s^ll.l linos, connect points of equal
air pressure; iFotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word 'high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by lair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the prepsure Is high In the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is lm
?robable. With a "hitch" in the vicinity of ,
daho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW TORK, March 4.â Prices of stocks show
losses of from 1 to 3 per cent to-day on a very
â¢mall business. The market was quite Inanim
ate at times and what business there was con
centrated In a few leading stocks. All of
these stocks showed weakness, but the down
ward course was pursued in a very desultory
manner until the final hour, when the bears
made a determined drive. They carried the
general list to the lowest of the day, but cov
ering In special stocks Induced some sharp
rallies. Higher quotations from London lilted
the level of prices at the opening, but the fall
was practically uninterrupted afterwards.
Efforts to rally the market were feeble and
unsuccessful. Union Pacific preferred was de
pressed all day and closed over 2 points lower.
The grangers all figured largely in the sell
ing. A large part of this selling was known
to be for Washington account and inquiry was
very keen fur news to account for it. Signifi
cant news was scarce and In its absence num
erous rumors were set afloat, one to the effect
that purchases of warships abroad had been
made by the United States Government. The
renewed depression of Spanish securities abroad
and the news of the purchase of two warships
by the Spanish Government helped on the feel-
Ing of uneasiness over the Cuban question. Not
withstanding the hardness of London money
rates and the tendency to relaxation In the
local requirements, foreign exchange went
lower again to-day, demand sterling falling to
$4 84Vfc. Nearly all the $2,800,000 In gold which
will start for New York to-morrow comes
from Paris, and no small part of it is said to
represent French payment for American se
curities bought In London during the recent
disturbances In Paris.
The bond market wns listless and heavy to
day In sympathy with stocks. Total sales,
$2.C2r>.000. United States new 4s and the old 4s
coupon were ',4 lower bid to-day.
Totals sales of stocks to-day were 301,500
shares. Including: P.altlmore and Ohio, 4224;
Burlington, 17,975; L-iulsville and Nashville
4500; Slanhattan, 22.800; Metropolitan, 7155;

NEW YORK. March 4.â The Evening Poet's
London financial cablegram sa.ys: The stock
markets here were dull to-day except for
Grand Trunks and Americans. The tendency
of first-class stocks is either to remain idle
or depressed, partly In connection with the
forthcoming China and other ioan operations.
The buying of Grand Trunk was large and In
fluenced partly by a Montreal clique. Amer
icans were fitful and closed dttlL The general
tendency here Is to suspend dealing in Ameri
cans until there is a more distinct lead :n>m
New York. Gold is in revived demand for
America at 77s l&d, though apparently ship
ments dn not pay. No (told Is offering. A

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, March 4.â At the opening and for
a short time after there was a lively specu
lative demand for July wheat and the market
displayed considerable firmness. Ac usual.
Letter was at the bottom of the strength, the
ordering of 540,000 bushels more of his wheat
for shipment to the seaboardâ this making
nearly 3,000,000 bushels since this movement be
ganâbeing responsible for a good deal of buy
ing. Another factor was the signing of the
decree reducing the Spanish import duties on
grain. Opening trades in July were made at
! 9H4@91%c, a shade above yesterday's closing
1 price, and enough support materialized to send
| the price up to 91% cm a short time. That
| proved to be the high point of the day. Out
j side of the Items of news mentioned everything
! favored the selling side of the market, and this
(act soon had Us effect. Liverpool was the es
jeclally discouraging feature. That market
.howed V4@%d decline. Argentine shipments
I were the heaviest thus far this season, being
; reported at 1,640,000 bushels. This array of
bear news gradually brought sellers into the
market, and the liquidation, light at first,
gradually grew heavier, prices slowly declin
ing. In the meantime another factor had en
tered the market In the shape of selling of
May by the elevator interests, in which Ar
mour was especially prominent. His houses
made no secret of the selling, and the freedom
'< of their offerings brought others to the selling
I side. Opening prices of May were He higher
; at $1 06H- An irregular decline to $1 06^4 fol
lowed. Then came a slight reaction, but prices
I soon got back to $1 05"* again. July by that
time had declined to W%c. For some time the
market hesitated at thoÃe figures, but the
liquidation of May finally took all the remain-
Ing courage out of the bulls and the market
was left to shift for Itself. During the last
hour offerings became quite heavy, both in
May and July, and prices slid off rapidly, May
fettlng as low as $1 04Vi and July declining to
Oc shortly before the close. Covering by
shorts with good profits then caused a little
better feeling and slight Improvements fol
lowed. May rallying to $1 04% and July to
90 1 4<g'90%c. Those were the closing prices.
i Corn was easier on a moderately active mar
ket. May closed %c lower.
Oats were remarkably strong during the
i morning. May closed a shade lower.
Provisions were heavy from the start. Most
of the selling was credited to a prominent
packer, but offerings were quite general and
the market, which opened lower in spite of
firm hog prices, declined steadily. At the close
May pork was 20c lower, May lard 10c lower
and May ribs 10c lower.

BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, March 4â Bradstreefs Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say:
Early In the week speculation developed a
tendency to recover from the depression which
In the preceding week had registered a sharp
break in prices. The relations of this Govern
ment with Spain have continued to be the
prominent factor In the situation, and though
there has been a subsidence of fear In regard
to war the tendency is to wait for develop
ments, and there has been an evident suscepti
bility to bear attacks, one of which, made on
Friday, caused a sharp recession and a weak
close. The public parted with its speculative
holdings on the break, and the market has
been to an Increased extent In the hands of
professional operators. The investment market
has also shown a susceptibility t.i the same
class of Influences, and while railroad bonds
have been firm and recovered moderately from
the depression, the transactions In that depart
ment of the market are very much reduced In
volume. Such improvement In values as the
stock list has exhibited seemed largely due
to covering by the short Interest and a rapid
manipulated rise In prices at the beginning
of the week appears to have pretty well elim
inated the bears.
Large Interests have extended 'some support
to the markets and stocks seemed to have
passed rapidly Into strong hands, though the
disposition has been to wait for developments
regarding Spain and Cuba rather than to re
sume active manipulation. The market was
greatly relieved by the easing off of call loan
rates. Little attention was given to the accom
panying hardening of exchange and the sus
pension of gold imports, with a total move
ment of about $5,300,000 gold from the other
side. London, though still Inclined to buy
moderately at the beginning of the week, haa
since realized moderately on the stocks which
they purchased on the break. The gratifying
character of the news about general business
and the directly favorable character of railroad
earnings create an underlying bullish senti
ment, and the "street" at large shows more
or less confidence in the ability of the market
ta respond to a favorable development In the
foreign situation, though cautious and re
stricted character of the trading by profes
sionals has caused narrow and frequent fluc
tuations in prices.
DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, March 4 â R. G. Dun A Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say In its issue
to-morrow:
Stories of the most reckless sort, disproved
promptly, and many of them bffore they are
told, affected speculation In stocks much last
week and at times this week, but they have
not disturbed the industries and the trade of
the country at all. There is confidence that
the authorlUeÃ are dolxuf what Is proper to
| provide for public defense and business Is mov
1 Ing on with the assurance that It will not be
I seriously disturbed. â  "â¢
j In grain, cotton, meat- products and pc-
I troleum the markets have been strong, with
i gradual Increases In the demand for manu-
f actured products. '' -
I Failures In February have been smaller than
, In any other month, except three of the pre
i vious five months, with remarkable decreases
f in the failures for $100,000 and over, though in
'. number and amount the smaller failures show
[ less change than might have been expected, In
dicating that In good times- or bad a large
proportion 1b due to causes apart from the
general conditions- of business.' The raUo of
defaulted liabilities to payments through the
Clearing-houses is but $1 71 per $1000, a lower
rate than has appeared in the first quarter of
any year except JSBO and -1881 â¢â  of the past
i twenty-three years. The best evidence of gen
â¢ eral Improvement is the fact, that payments
, through. Clearing-houses for the past week have
â¢ been 28 per cent larger than in 1892, and out-
I side New York with Its speculative interests,
I 17.6 per cent. Compared with last year the
| gain has : been 56.2 per cent for the week and
15.8 per cent for February. Production of pig
! iron Is the greatest ever known, some furnaces
having started in the past month, but Besse
;â¢ mer billets are so scarce at Chicago that some
i works are embarrassed, and heavy purchases
I at Pittsburg Including one of 25,000 tons, have
stiffened the price bo that Bessemer pig and
i local coke at Chicago art stronger than since
November 1, with gray forge unchanged at
Plttsburg. . Foundry at the East Is slightly
lower, basic pig hnving been offered In a sharp
competition with about $10,- though Southern
makers in Alabama and Tennessee, excepting
two, have agreed upon a plan of sales through
a commission." The demand for finished prod
ucts covers work far ahead in plates, struc
tural forms, sheets, pipes since the advance in
oil,. and rails with a Chicago sale for a Cana
dian road to Alaska, but bar is .weak, with
increasing use of steel, and tin plates are
quoted at $2 85, against $4 for the same qual
ity of foreign. Tin is stronger at 14.2 c and
lake copper at 11.87 c.
The strike in the cotton mills does not spread,
but helps to slightly better demand for goods,
while in wool trade is slow In some of the
finer qualities; which have been much advanced
in price, and in these, and other grades as
well, cancellations have exceeded re-orders. In
dicating lens distributing than was expected at
i the advanced prices. Wool has yielded a little,
the average of 100 quotations by Coates Broth
ers for domestic being 20.23 c, against 20.530
February 1, arid while yielding is thus far
mainly in Inferior qualities, stocks at least
three years old are pressed for sale.
Wheat has grown stronger, exports continu
ing at a rate which threatens exhaustion of
supply If the trade" reports of farmers' stocks I
are correct. From Atlantic, ports 2,426,240
bushels went out (flour Included), against
1.356.416 last year, an.l from Pacific ports Â£64,
093, against 479,959 bushels last year. The price
has risen lr, but It is possible that the esti
mates of last year's stocks, though 30.000.C00
bushels in excess of the Government estimates,
may prove too small. Corn has declined only
Me, with exports of 4.745.513 bushels, against
5,221.785 last year.
Failures for the past week have been 231 in
the 1 United States, against 246 last year, and 32
in Canada, against 59 last year.
BRADSTRKET9 REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Marrh 4â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will sny: Nearly all signs point to an
unprecedented volume of business being done
or arranging for at the present time. The
aggressive strength of prices, record-breaking
bank clearings and continued large exports,
particularly of the lower-priced cereals, a very
heavy volume of business in iron and steel and
kindred lines, .and generally satisfactory re
ports as to the volume of spring trade at lead
ing distributive centers are among the visible
fentures of this week's trade development.
Nearly all of the country's cereal products are
higher In prices this week, and also some
varieties of provisions, Bessemer plglron, cop
per. raw cotton and tin. The further advance
In plglron this week would seem to Indicate
that the Immense current production is yet
without visible effect on values. The price of
copper showed an advance of â¢ nearly 1 cent
per pound during February, while the con
sumptive demand and statistical position are
such as to lead to confidence, at . least in the
maintenance In present prices. If not of a fur
ther advance. Few decreases in prices are
noted, sugar being the most important, while
the list of staples steady and unchanged num
bers pork, coffee, lead and print cloths. The
strength of raw cotton has had an encourag
ing effect upon Southern trada. which Is gen
erally reported good and better than usual at
this season. The export of corn from South
ern ports Is an additionally favorable â¢ feature,
while the practical agreement of Southern Iron
producers on prices and generally satisfactory
collections at most points have imparted a de
cidedly cheerful tone to advices from that sec
tion. Trade is larger than usual at the Cen
tral West, particularly In dry goods, groceries,
boots and shoes, hardware, â¢ lumber , and agri
cultural Implements, the demand for the latter
being a notable feature at nearly all markets.
Spring tradÂ« has opened' up well' In the Nortn
west and the Jobbing trade Is - quite active.
Signs are accumulating that the rush of all
sorts of vessels to the Pacific Coast to take â¢
part In the Klondike trade has begun to affect
charter rates, which are reported weaker at â¢
San Francisco.
Cotton goods displays strength, although
print cloths of regular widths are somewhat
easier. Oinghams are In better demand than
for several years past. Spring business in
woolen g"odn has been rather disappointing.
but a food !<mand for men's wear goods for
fall delivery is reported and the mills are well
supplied with orders. Woolen manufacturers
are not In the market for raw wool to any ex
tent but prlres are still firm.
A further phrinkage In wheat exports, but a
corresponding enlargement of the shipments of
corn and the lower-priced cereals is Indicated
this wwk Tlie total exports of wheat (flour
Included) from the United States and Canada
aggreÃat" 3.252.000 bushels, against 3,722.000
bushels last week. 2,075.000 bushels In this weejc
a year ago, 2.407,000 bushels In 1896 and 3.272.000
bushels In 1595.
Business failures in the United States for the
week number 232. as against 183 for five busi
ness days last week, 262 in the corresponding
week of last year. 270 in 1896 and 252 In IS9S.
Business failures In Canada aggregate 2., as
against JS last week. 51 in this week of 1897. 66
in 1596 and 53 In 1895.

FAMILY RETAIL MARKET.
There are a good many changes this week.
Butter and Eggs are cheaper. Poultry and
game Is much dearer, and wild Ducks and
Quail are dropped from the list of Game.
Mutton Ik dearer and will probably be
dearer still, owing to the scarcity of feed In
the sheep districts. Beef also shows a ten
dency to rise.
Asparagus and Rhubarb are now coming in
freely and both are getting cheaper every
day. Green Peas are also getting more plen
tiful.
There Is no change worthy of note In fruits,
though Limes continue scarce.
Fish Is about the ?ame as last week.

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
WOODWARD IS
HEARD AT LAST
The Councilman Before
the Grand Jury
for an Hour.
Inquiry Is Going Back to
Where the Bold Scheme
Began.
Many Subpenas Are Issued, Made
Returnable for Next
Tuesday.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 4.
The Grand Jury is gradually working
backward, and it will soon be seeking
information regarding the circum
stances surrounding the appointment
of the last Republican City Convention.
It was at that time that the scheme
resulting in the passage of the extor
tionate water rate ordinance had its
birth. In some unaccountable manner
the Republican City Central Commit
tee surrendered the authority of ar
ranging for primaries to a committee
of twenty-one, which in turn named
J. E. CROOKS, Foreman of the Grand Jury That Is Investigating:
Stones cf Briber/ in Oakland.
the one hundred delegates to the mv- j
nicipal convention. At that time talk
of bribery was commenced, and it has
been kept up ever since, and the Grand
Jury intends to begin at the source if
It can find out where the source lies.
To-day Colonel L. L. Bromwell was a
witness. He it was who presented a !
petition to Councilman Upton asking
that he vote against the alternation of
the hydrants. Mr. Upton voted against i
the measure, believing that it is better j
to have the full benefit of both com
panies in case of fire. Colonel Bromwell
was asked why he was interested in
the petition and as to his connection
with the water companies, but little in
formation was gained.
This afternoon E. W. Woodward,
after being kept two days in the hall
way, was before the jury for an hour
and was very closely questioned about
his brief official life. He was asked
about his first interview with the
Mayor, when he was told by Mr.
Thomas that he was to be a Council
man, and also regarding the sources
whence he received his information
that caused him to vote for water rates
at such short notice. The major had a
very interesting and trying time for
an hour, and was told to come back
next Tuesday afternoon, to which time
the Grand Jury adjourned.
The District Attorney made out a
large bunch of subpenas this afternoon,
and next Tuesday it is probable that
some of the members of the solid six
will be on hand for examination.
This morning Major Woodward was
served with a notice that his modest
office rent of $7 50 would be $100 after
April 1. "I don't know whether I will
go or not," said the Mayor. "I consider
suÂ£h action unfair, and it is the least
of my troubles. I shall not cross the
bridge till I get to it, and the request
of my office associates was very undig
nified."
Harry W. Thomas, secretary of the
Board of Works, was in attendance on
the Grand Jury all yesterday and to
day, but he has not yet been exam
ined, and was told to return next Tues
day. ,____â _âââââ
CAR JUMPED THE TBACK.
Three Persons Injured by an Acci
dent on the Shattuck-Avenue
Electric Line.
BERKELEY, March 4.â An electric car
of the Oakland Consolidated line jumped
the track this afternoon as it was making
the turn from Shattuck avenue into Ade
line street. North Berkeley, and injured
three people. Mr*. Frank Becker of 3024
Deakln street, North Berkeley, was
struck by the car, and besides receiving
a. severe nervous shock she was badly
bruised about the shoulders and hips.
Mrs Becker is an old lady, and is par- i
riill'v paralyzed, so she was unable to j
get out P of the way of the car Dr. P. R.
Woolsey attended her. and helped to re
mnvp her to her home.
A young lady. Miss A. Collins, who was
nrTthe car, was badly cut about the face
ami head. She was able, however, to
continue her journey to Oakland. A little
Klrl about 8 years old was also cut by
flvinc glass. No explanation has been j
rn'ide why the car should leave the I
tr-ick The car had Just completed the
tiirr 'and was moving quite rapidly. The
passengers in the car received a se/ere
shaking up and scare, but were other
wise unhurt.
Only one person in fifteen has perfect

ple. i
THE SAX FIIAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 5, 189 S.
EBELL LADIES
IN A QUANDARY
The Question of Federa
tion to Come Up on
Tuesday.
A Committee Which Objects to
Being Suddenly Cast
Aside.
Members Are Equally Divided on a
Subject of Great Im
portance.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 4.
The Ebell Society will meet Tuesday
afternoon, and the gathering is antici
pated with much interest by the two
factionsâ for it is a fact that there are
differences of opinion in the Ebell. The
question of State federation is now oc
cupying the attention of the ladies,
and it now appears that the question
was not disposed of at the last meet
ing as many supposed.
Mrs. A. W. Bishop holds that those
who are 'n favor o! federating with
other clubs in the State have been
beaten, while Mrs. John Russ, who is
in favor of federation, declares that the
matter is not settled, and that there
will be another debate and ultimately
a vote in its favor.
The question of whether the "Rhpi!
shall confine itself exclusively to itself,
or whether it shall in some degree lose
its identity somewhat by merging into
a State federation of clubs, was
brought up about two months ago,
and a committee was appointed to
communicate with other States and
find out how they stand in the matter
and also how the clubs regard woman
suffrage. It is admitted, though it has
not been proclaimed yet from the
housetops, that woman suffrage is at
a low ebb just now in AlamedaCounty.
It is a subject with which the Ebell
has little to do, the members realizing
that it is a delicate question. The com
mittee, therefore, was carefully in
structed to see how the State federa
tion of ladles' clubs viewed the suff
rage question.
The society was discussing the mat
ter at its last meeting when President
Bunnell asked that some one make a
motion so that the matter could be
properly discussed. To the surprise
of all, Miss Babson moved that the
committee be dismissed.
A still greater surprise was caused
when the motion carried by a small
majority. Many ladies wondered what
had happened, and. had men been
members of the Ebell, it would have
been said that it was a case of poli
tice, but politics are rigidly excluded
from the Ebell.
The committee is thus in a quandary
and has a lot of work on hand that
it does not quite know how to dis
pose of. It has correspondence from
twenty-seven States to attend to, and
it has as yet made no report, and re
fuses to consider itself disbanded at
a moment's notice. The Interest is
very keen, and the matter is far from
settled.
"The Ebell is too big and important
to refuse to keep abreast of the times,"
said a prominent member of the club
to-day. "We must branch out, and the
difference of opinion now is over the
question of whether we sha affiliate
with other clubs and form a State fed
eration, or whether we shall keep our
selves to ourselves. The club is about
evenly divided on the question, and,
as it conce-ns all our 400 and over
members, it cannot be handled hur
riedly. As a matter of fact, the ques
tion may have a permanent effect on
the future of the Ebell."
A DIVORCED WIFE'S CLAIM.
She "Wants a Portion of the Property
Left by Her Deceased Husband.
ALAMEDA, March 4.â Some time ago
Peter C. Helseley. an old smltchman, died
in this city, leaving a little piece of prop
erty, which he devised to his daughter
and three grandchildren. Within a few
days a Mrs. Wall of Clayton. Ind., has
put in a claim for a portion of the prop
erty. She claims to be the divorced wife
of deceased, and to be entitled to a por
tf. r of the property. Many years ago
Hi" .-eley deserted her and came to Cali
fornia. He bought the Alameda property
anO subsequently his wife obtained a di
vorce and married again. The claim is
now advanced that aa Helseley bought
the property before the divorce, it was
community property, and his wife is still
entitled to share in it. She has retained
counsel and will make a fight on the
lines indicated. There is just about
enough of the property to pay the fees
and costs of litigation.
DESERTED HER
AT THE ALTAR
The Bride and a Cozy
Home, but No
Groom.
Matthew Burns Dropped Out
an Hour Before the
Wedding.
The Home to Be Stripped, and the
Affair Still *Â» Mystery
to All.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, March 4.
On Washington's birthday Matthew
Burns left his love, Miss Julia Walsh,
and his last promise was that he would
obtain a marriage license the following
day and that they should b- Tiarried
the next day. Burns kept his promise
about getting the license, but forgot all
about the marriage ceremony, and he
cannot be found to give an explanation.
The little romance came to light to
day when Mrs. Kuhlken, who owns a
house at Berkeley, expressed her sur
prise that the parties who rented it
have not yet occupied it, although the
rent was paid in advance. About two
weeks ago the little cottage on Addi
son street was neatly furnished and
everything arranged for the event that
was scheduled for the following day.
The next morning Burns procured a
license at the County Clerk's office and
asked that it bp kept quiet as he did not
intend to use it for a few days. The
same evening he appeared at the house
early, and after expressing his satisfac
tion with the preparations he departed,
presumably to prepare himself for the
ceremony. He has not been seen since.
The prospective bride's brother has
evidently given up hope of seeing his
sister married, for he has asked the
furniture dealer to take back the goods.
Mips Walsh is said to have been so
heartbroken over the affair that she has
been sent back to relations in Ire
land. _________^__

made, or tin- owners refuse to makÂ« such |

JUDGE ELLSWOBTH ILL.
Judge Greene Away and the Court
Calendars Crowded Upon the
Other Judges.
OAKLAND, March 4.â The illness of
Judge Ellsworth that caneed the continu
ance of the John McGinnis murder trÂ«&i
yesterday, was so much worse to-day
that the Judge was not permitted to see
any one outside of the members of his
family. He has been ailing for several
days, but insisted upon keeping his place
in court. For a week past he has had a
fire behind the bench and worn an over
coat.
Judge Greene is in Now York City, and
no one knows when he will return. With
only two departments, Judges Ogden and
Hall, in operation, they find themselves
very busy men.
To-night Judge Ogden continued the
Harris-Ames suit until Tuesday next,
with the understanding that should Judge
Ellsworth fail to recover by that time
he would take up one or the other of the
criminal cases now partially heard by
Judge Ellsworth. Those are the Roeth
and McGinnis trials, both of which are
set for Tuesday morning. Judge Ogden
just completed a year's work in the crim
inal department, and his friends fear that
he will break down from the strain should
he be compelled to take it up again, as
he is an extremely hard worker.
Judge Hall's department has a civil case
set for every day next we<*k. but he stated
to-night that should Judge Ellsworth con
tinue unable to hold court 'next week,
he, too, would take a criminal case and
continue his civil cases until such a time
as the others were completed.
FELL BEFORE A TRAIN.
Narrow Escape of Miss Bessie J.
Wood While Riding a
Bicycle.
OAKLAND, March 4.â While riding a
bicycle this afternoon, in Alameda, Miss
Bessie J. Wood of Twenty-third avenue
fell in front of a local train on Railroad
avenue and was saved from being killed
by her cousin, Mr. Bert Swim. As it was
her wheel was smashed and the young
lady is nursing a badly bruised and
sprained knee.
Miss Wood is just learning to ride and
with her cousin went to Alameda to spend
an hour or two. While on the avenue
she noticed the approach of the local
train. Like many new riders she lost
her presence of mind and control of her
wheel. Instead of clearing the track she
ran into it and fell upon the rails. Mr.
Swim saw her start and knew what to
expect. Dismounting and dropping his
wheel he ran to his cousin, dragging her
off of the track just as the train passed.
. â¦ â 
Narrow Escape in the Fog.
OAKLAND, March 4.â Another collision
was narrowly averted on the bay to-day
in the dense >og. The ferry-steamer
Piedmont left this side of the bay at 12:30
p. m. with the passengers of three trains.
When off Goat Island the Arcata was
met, inward bound. They grazed one an
other, which nearly created a panic
among the passengers. They rushed for
the life-preservers, but the Arcata dis
appeared in the fog in an instant. The
Piedmont's engines were stopped and re
versed just as the Arcata came in sight,
but not in time to wholly avert the pend
ing danger.

OAKLAND, March 4.â The citizens'

CELEBRATED
WITH PUNCHES
The San Francisco Ath-
letic Club in New
Quarters.
Three Fast Fights for the
Local Amateur Cham-
pionship.
Monthly Meetings "Will Be Held and
a Ladies' Night Soon to Bo
Arranged.
"Talk about the Ryan-Green fight,
why they ain't In it. The San Fran
cisco Athletic Club is the only place
to see true sport." Such were the
remarks passed last evening after the
programme arranged by the associa
tion to celebrate the opening of their
new quarters at Sixth and Shipley
streets had been played out.
Three special contests for the ama
teur championship of the local clubs
had been arranged for, and the way
the gloves landed on the anatomy of
the various contestants was proof pos
itive ihat the goes were for blood and
the reputation of the several clubs rep
resented by hard-hi*ting youths.
Mr. Denehy was unanimously de
clared to be ths master of ceremonies
and he carried off his part with good
grace and satisfaction to the large
audience present. President of the Club
Alex Greggains made the opening re
marks and the sport was on. The first
attraction of the evening was in the
form of heavy lifting with the teeth
by Professor Leo Arnodo, and the
weight of dumbbells placed in the lift
ing apparatus was finally discovered
to be 300 pounds. The work of the
professor was heartily cheered, but it
was easily seen that the audience was
awaiting more blood-stirring or blood
spilling exercise.
The first go was between Peter Mc-
Fadden of the Manhattans and Jack
Maynard of the S. F. A. C. The lads,
who were but 19 years of age, stripped
at 115 pounds and started in with the
determination to do or die. Jimmy
Lawlor was referee, and after some
! spirited fighting the bout was declared
a draw, as each lad had attempted to
assassinate the other with well directed
! punches. Both fought well and the
decision was accepted as a just one.
It was noticed at this stage of the
game that Jim Markland was one of
1 the interested spectators, and it was
I proposed that he referee the following
! bout, but he declined for the reason
I that he had worn his new clothes to
I celebrate the evening. He was accom-
I panied by the capitalists, Colonel Bar
rett of New York City. Alexander Bar-
I rett of Ohio and Mike Hennessy, one of
the crack riders of the coast. J. B.
! Gill was also with the party and
. watched the contests with interest.
The next on the programme was Ser
i geant Michael Joseph Conboy, who took
| copious notes of the affair, as he was
! there in the interests of law and order
i as well as being one of the invited
! guests who had a reserved seat. Then
I came Sheriff Whelan in a short speech,
i followed by Mr. Hanson with a song.
Jack Ennis and Kid McCarthy, both
â of the San Francisco Athletic Club,
' toed the scratch, with Bantam Anthony
{ as referee, and after four rounds of
! hard punching Ennis was given the de
; cision for the superior work done.
i Charles Kelly made his appearance and
sang a touching ballad, and a youth
1 described as "Kid" Carr followed.
Then came the knock-out. Frank
i Schuler of the San Francisco Athletic
! Club and W. Preese of the Manhattan
! Athletic Club, who was stated to have
; recently arrived from New York City,
' where he had won a lengthy string of
amateur scalps, stepped into the ring.
I The rounds were for blood. Each
| scored a knock-down within two rounds
and kept fighting. Anthony also ref
ereed this go, and gave satisfaction.
The fight was to have lasted six rounds,
but In the fourth Schuler landed a well
directed right on the point of Preese's
jaw and he forcibly reposed.
It was announced by Master of Cere
monies Denehy that the club has de
cided to sive monthly exhibitions, and
that a ladies' night will be given on or
about the 2Sth of this month. Also that
Monday. Wednesday and Friday even
ings would be given up to teaching
those who are desirous of learning how
to defend themselves and consequently
best others. John Conroy will handle
the lightweights, Jim McConnell the
middleweights, and Alex Greggains the
heavyweights.
Appealed From the Recorder.
OAKLAND, March 4.â J. J. Coulter, a
horseman of Emeryville, has appealed
from the decision of Recorder Quinn giv
ing William J. Dunn, a groom, judgment
for $60 for labor performed. This is the
first case appealed in the new town, al
though it was the 19Sth case that had
been tried before the Recorder.
Faint Hearted Burglars.
OAKLAND, Mnrch 4.â Burglars con
tinue to visit various portions of this city.
Auger holee mark their attempts oh sev
eral doors where they were scared away
before effecting an entrance. The bar
keeper of Ellis & Kohl, of Seventh and
Chester streets, took four shots at a
fleeing figure last night in the fog. but
missed his mark. The Mitchler residence,
802 Fifth street, was tampered with, but
the timely arrival of some members or
the family drove the intruders away.
Berkeley News Notes.
BERKELEY. March 4.â The university

track athletes in a baseball game on tha
college campus by a score of 17 to 15.-
On Monday evening next, at Stiles Hall.
John L. Howard of Oakland will address

mast to-day, out of respect to the mem
ory of Miss Grace M. F. Robinson, a
special student in the freshman class,
who died suddenly in her home at Oak
land yesterday.
Editor Hopper, in to-day's Occident,
sarcastically scores the Intercollegiate
Athletic Association for its recent threat
to disbar the University of California on
account of the criticisms of Football
Manager E. J. Brown on Eastern ath
letics. The editor of the Occident declares
that, "contrary to what may be thought
in the East, Mr. Brown is not the official
spokesman and heralding trumpet of Cali
fornia."

tournament between the University of
California and Stanford will take place
to-morrow morning at 9:30 o'clock at the
Hopkins Institute in San Francisco.

TROUBLE IN A CLOTHING HOUSE
Interest of Frank Pursch in the Firm
of Pursch & Kaskel Attached.
The interest of Frank Pursch in the firm
of Pursch & Kaskel, clothing manufac
turers, at 22 Sansome street, was attached
yesterday by the Sheriff on claims aggre
gating over $9000. Pursch Is a resident of
New York and the cause of his trouble
is evidently one in the affairs of the firm,
for D Kaskel has placed an attachment
on for $6717. The other creditors are John
B Earle. $200. and J. "Wiff. $521. Naph
taly, Freidenrich & Ackerman and J. W
Lilienthal are the attorneys for the plain
tiffs.
Trades Union Notes.
It is probable that within a few weeks
the San Francisco Labor Council will ha
strengthened by the addition of the
Printing Pressmen and Feeders' Union A
delegation from that body was present at
last night's meeting of the Council to gain
information regarding the benefits of af
filiation with the central body. The Typo
graphical Union will put its nine-hour
workday schedule into effect in the local
book arid job offices on April 4. A canvass
has been made of these offices and no
trouble is expected, as the proprietors
seem willing to clip off an hour without
reducing wages. A mass meeting of jour
neyman tailors will be held at 102 O'Far
rell street on Monday evening for the
purpose of strengthening the ranks of the
newly formed tailors' union.

FOG MARRED
THE RACING
Refuqoo Took a Purse
Supported by a Strong
Company.
Charley Thorpe and Tod Sloan
Divided the Riding
Honors.
Gold Scratch Won the Two-Year-
Old Event at Lony Oddsâ Ostler Joe
First in Hie Handicap.
Fog was again a strong factor at In
gleside yesterday. One event only was
decided with the spectators enjoying
an unobstructed' view of the horses.
The favorites met with three reverses,
and it is more than likely that in one
race at least there "were some big do
ings." Tod Sloan piloted three and
Charley Thorpe two winners.
The opening mile run for maidens
was only a gallop for Twinkle Twink,
which ran in Don Cameron's colors and
â¢won eased up to a walk, after going to
the post a 4 to 5 choice in the betting.
In a drive Durward took the place from
[Whirlwind.
Johnny Campbell finally started
the speedy Punter in the six fur
long selling dash that followed,
and the wise ones grabbed the
even money that was offered about
the filly. It took all of Tod Sloan's
skill in the saddle to land her
winner, a head before the second
choice, Prompto. Moringa, as usual,
finished in the show.
The stable, it was said, did not play
Gold Scratch to win the four furlong
scramble for two-year-olds. At any
rate, the gray youngster got the best
of a straggling start, and at odds of
12 to 1 finished over a length in front
of Primavera, th<? second choice. Ach.
the Corrigan entry, an 11 to 10 favorite,
â¢was beaten for the show by Mossbrae.
Fog undoubtedly proved a strong
factor in the victory of Refugee. In
the betting on the mile selling event
Willie Sink's cripple opened at odds of
6 to 1. His price lengthened until 20
was reached, when he was played down
to 8 and 10. He won by less than a
length from the favorite. Rey del
Tierra, in the slow time of 1:43%. It
was evidently a "shoo in," as two or
three of the horses which finished be
hind him are capable of running a
much faster mile. Of the other start
ers Fashion Plate was probably the
only one that was not a "lobster," and
she was dead last time out. It was
passed over like many of the other dis
graceful seances of the present racing
season.
A big consignment of coin forced the
odds of Caliente down from 5 to 2 to
8 to 5 in the betting on the six furlong
selling affair following, and he became
lost in the fog. Huriy Burly, the Cor
rigan entry, a 4 to l chance in the ring,
won handily from Bonita, a 12 to 1
"shot. Chihuahua, another rank out
sider, was third.
The black horse. Ostler Joe, was fa
vorite for the mile and a sixteenth
handicap, which, like most of the others
at this track, was a pronounced frost,
and he scored without difficulty from
Glorian, at one time as good as 25 to 1
in the betting. The second choice.
Greyhurst, quit like a. dog, ending- up in
the far rear.

BICYCLISTS ARE
NOW JUBILANT
Golden Gate Park Will Glitter
With Electricity at
Night.
Lights to Bo Placed on this Main
Driveways and Bicycle
Paths.
Bicycle enthusiasts have at last gained j
a long-looked-for point and are. In con- j
scqut-nce. elated over their victory. With
in two months the bicycle track as well
as the driveway throughout the main
portions of Golden Gate Park will be
lighted by electricity from 6 o"clock in
the evening until midnight. Those who
still roly on driving for pleasure will, un
der the natural course of events, fall in
for a portion of tne enjoyment which the
new departure will, without doubt, afford.
tor months past petition after petition
has presented itself for the purpose of i
having the park more thoroughly lighted
during the moonless nights, especially on I
the main driveways and the bicycle paths,
and now that the material is on the
ground, those who were the most anxious
for the much-needed improvement can
hardly believe that they have gained a
point which will be a benefit to all who
visit the park during the evening.
The wires for the lights will be placed
underground, and the boxes which will
carry them will be taken to the park on
Monday, when work will begin on the
trenches. The wires will start from the
Baker-street entrance and extend to
Twenty-fourth avenue, and then back
again to the starting point by way of the
pumping station and the children's play
ground. Five miles of wire will be used
in the construction of the system, and it
is hoped the work will be completed in
about two months. The lights will be
placed from 400 to 6l>o feet apart depend
ing on the location. In some portions of
the path more lignis will be needed than
in others, as the curves would prevent
the light from entering all points, but
the difficulty has been overcome by those
who will lay the wires.
A power plant has been erected In con
nection with the pumping station, and
all the boilers, motors and other neces
sary machinery have been put In place.
Mr. McLaren, superintendent of the park,
is of the opinion the new move will be of
great benefit to the park, as It will tend
to draw large numbers there during the
evening. The only ones who will, without
doubt, object to more light being thrown
on their affairs are those who are unable
to ride, drive or wheel during the pleas
ant evenings.
Granted a Divorce.
Henry O'Brien was granted a divorce [
from his wife, Carrie O'Brien, by Judge I
Hunt yesterday. The plaintiff's allegation '
that his wife had willfully deserted him
was substantiated by several witnesses j
and the decree was ordered to issue.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 5, 1898.
TONS OF SHOT
AND POWDER
Magazines of the Presidio
and Lime Point to
Be Filled.
The Ammunition May Be
Transferred From Benicia
Arsenal To-Day.
In the Event of War the Fourth
Cavalry Would Probably Be
Ordered to the Front.
The magazines of the Presidio and
Lime Point will soon have an ample
supply of powder, solid shot and shell.
The commanding officer of Benicia Ar
senal, Colonel Babbitt, has been direct-
Ed by the War Department to send to
the ordnance officer at the Presidio a
large quantity of ammunition for high
power guns for distribution to the mag
azines of Fort Point and Fort Baker.
It is probable that twenty tons of
powder and a large number of projec
tiles will be placed aboard barges at
Benicia to-day. It is presumed that the
barges will be towed to- the Presidio
wharf.
Details relating to the distribution of
the ammunition cannot be obtained for
publication from army headquarters in
this city, and Colonel Babbitt of Be
nicia Arsenal declines to be interviewed
on the topic. It Is understood that a
large part c-f the proposed shipment of
munitions will consist of powder, and
that the supply at the arsenal, which
may be very nearly exhausted when
the magazines are properly tilled, will
Boon be replenished by a train load of
ammunition from the East.
A feeling of insecurity may exist in
the East regarding the strength and
equipment of the fortifications of New I
YÂ«>rk and Bc-ston, but veteran army of
ficers stationed at the Presidio are con
fident that the works of Fort Point and
Fort Baker are strong enough to resist
successfully any fleet Spain could send
to the Pacific. Colonel Miller and Lieu
tenant-Colonel Williston of the Third
Artillery and Lieutenant-Colonel Mor- ;
ris of the Fourth Cavalry are officers
of sound judgment and long ex- '
perience in the service of the
United States, and, while neither
one would care to be quoted as giving
an estimate of the strength of the forti
fications of this harbor, they are all
confident that the guns no-w in position
could stand off any fleet Spain could
send here.
Some people l.aye an ide that If war
had been declare ! while the Spanish
cruiser Vizcaya was in New York har
bor the Spaniard could lie ye opened a
fire of shot and shell on that city. In
ternational law does not permit any
thing of the kind. Should a Spanish
cruiser enter the harbor of San Fran
cisco to-day and war should be de
clared on tne following day, the ship
would be notified to leave. Having en
tered the harbor peaceably she would
be allowed to depart in peace. Ac
cording to international law, our guns
'â  could not molest the outgoing ship,
and neither could our cruisers be per
mitted to follow her out, but once out
side the three-mile limit, the hostile
cruLer would oe treated as an enemy
on a fair field, and the ship could then
mako any demonstration of hostility
that her commander should direct.
One might /Use the point that the
Spanish, hr .-in" an advantage, would
not be restrained by the law of na
tions, but no civilized nation can af
ford to violate with impunity such law.
The offender in a case of this kind be
comes an outlaw in the eyes of the
civilized world.
An army officer yesterday remarked:
"A Spanish cruiser that should so defy
international law and open fire on this
city would never get to sea again. A
city is not bound to surrender or pay
tribute because the houses are shelled.
I take it that the people of San Fran
cisco would not pay one million dollars
or one dollar for immunity from shell
ing under such circumstances. But
no nation can afford to invite the con
tempt and hatred" of all other nations.
Outside the three-mile limit the shell
ing might begin by the outgoing
cruiser, but not before the line was
passed. When Captain Winslow of the
Kearsarge fought Semmes of the Ala
bnma he went seven miles off Cher
bourg to prevent any cause for inter
national complication."
A retiring board to consist of the fol
lowing officers has been directed by the
Secretary of War to convene in San
Francisco: Colonel Charles R. Green
leaf, assistant surgeon general; Colo
nel Evan Miles. First Infantry; lieu
tenant Colonel Johnson V. D. Middle
ton, deputy surgeon general; Lieuten
ant Colonel Louis T. Morris, Fourth
Cavalry; Major David H. Klnzie, Third
Artillery, and First Lieutenant Robert
H. Noble, First Infantry, aid-de-camp,
recorder.
The troopers of the Fourth Cavalry,
stationed at the Presidio, are now en
gaged in pistol practice. In the event
of war with Spain the Fourth Cavalry
would probably be ordered to Key
West, to be within easy reach should
United States troops be ordered to
Cuba. The Fourth Cavalry is prepared
for whatever may come, although the
prospects of an active campaign in
Cuba may not be as delightful to the
mind of the trooper as the thought of
another tour of duty on the reserva
tions of the Sierras, but when war is
declared soldiers prefer service at the
front.
First Lieutenant John D. Miley, Fifth
Artillery, on the staff of the depart
ment commander, returned to the city
yesterday from Los Angeles.
The story that Major General Miles is
coming to the Pacific Coast is believed
by army officers here to be a sensa
tional yarn.
General Shafter, commanding the de
partment of California, was in Bakers
field yesterday. He may return early
next week. There is nothing in the sit
uation here demanding his presence.
WILIi WEED OUT DEPUTIES.
Fish Commissioners to Overhaul
Their Force of Subordinates.
At a meeting of the California Fish and
Game Commission yesterday there was a j
step taken that may hove the effect of j
rattling some of the dry hones among- the
suhordinates of that body. Scattered
along the entire length of the State are
about 300 deputy commissioners, who are I
supposed to be of some use to tho office, j
They are all provided with badges and
commissions which Rive them the same I
powers as those possessed by a sheriff's
deputies. With but few exceptions these
deputies have not been heard from since i
they received their badges and credentials, j
What use they make of their authority i
is more than the commissioners can make !
out. Of course there are exceptions to â¢
this rule, but taken as a whole not over
10 per cent of the crew have been of the
least service to the State office.
During the discussion at the meeting it !
wns shown that the men in question had
been appointed upon the recommendation
of the Superior Judges and the Game
Wardens of their respective counties and
in some instances on the request of
sportsmen's clubs. Commissioner Vogel
sang said: "It may be very nice for these
gentlemen to display their badges or of
fice, be clothed with the same authority
as peace officers and be exempt from do
ing jury duty on the ground that they are
officers of the State, but it is time for us
to have an accounting from them."
And there will be an accounting, for the
secretary will write to every one of them
and demand a report of all the work they
have done, the condition of ?ame in their
several districts and such other informa
tion as they mi^ht be expected to furnish.
In the event of not receiving satisfactory
reports the derelicts' names will be can â¢
celert from the roll of deputies and their
badges and credentials will be called in.
It has been three years since the force
of deputies has bee"n overhauled. These
subordinate officers have been, it will be
remembered, serving without piiv, and
considering that the fish and pame laws
have been openly violated in every county
in the State the commissioners have come
to the conclusion that such deputies are
dear at even no compensation.
Divorce Suits Filed.
Annie Davidson has commenced suit
against George B. Davidson for divorce
on the ground of infldolity. Otto Ander
son has applied for a divorce from Chris
tine M. Anderson on the ground of de
sertion.

HER INNOCENT
LIFE BLIGHTED
"General" Spurgeon Arrested on
Complaint of Unfortunate
Alice Loy.
Charged With a Horrid Crime by the Child Who
Was Spirited Away to
Sacramento.
George Ppurgeon Duggan. who styles
himself General Spurgeon. commander
of Jesus Christ Army on Howard street,
between Fourth and Fifth, was arrest
ed by Officer Frank Kane of the local
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children and Officer Healy of the
Sacramento nooiety at a late hour last
night on the statement of little Alice
Loy, who was supposed to have been
abducted from God's Regular Army
headquarters, at 513 Howard street, last
Wednesday by a man named Weiss and
taken to Sacramento, where she is now
being cared f</r in the Sisters' Shelter.
If the child's statement is true, and
all the circumstances seem to bear it
out. Spurgeon !s a monster who would
be leniently tre*ed if hanged. It also

More Than She Cares to Tell Regarding Alic: Loy.
shows a state of affairs existing among
the leaders of these organizations that
is disgusting.
As published in The Call yesterday.
Alice was abandoned by Weiss in Sac
ramento and delivered to Officer Healy
of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children, who has under
taken to see that her tormentors are
punished in part at least.
Officer Healy came down from Sac
ramento last night to arrest Spurgeon,
and he flatly contradicted many state
ments made by Mrs. Clark, which fal
low.
A medical examination of the child
disclosed a most horrible condition, but
it was not until yesterday that she
would give the details of the brutal
treatment she had endured.
According to Healy, Mrs. Clark went
to the police station Wednesday night
to make inquiries about Alice, and it
was there that he found her. She was
alone and said when questioned that
Weiss had gone into the country. Mrs.
Clark told the officer that Weiss had
taken thÂ«> girl to Sacramento in order
that she might be properly treated by
the woman, who had some medicine
with her.
The officer asked if it was not singu
lar that she should take the medicine
with her and leave the child behind,
but Mrs. Clark vouchsafed no reply.
She adÂ«nltted that she was fully
aware of the child's condition, and on
being pressed as to who the guilty
party was she said it was General Spur
geon, at whose home she had stopped
with Alice upon their arrival from Port
land Just before the holidays. Mrs.
Clark admitted that they moved from
the general's home because of his
general misconduct and intemperance,
and then when Officer Healy asked her
why she had not had him arrested
when she learned of the child's con
dition and the name of her assailant,
she replied that she thought Alice
might be mistaken.
Mrs. Clark's statements were so con
tradictory that Healy refused to deliver

Alice to her or even let her see the lit
tle sufferer.
Yesterday the girl, realizing that she
was among friends at last, told her
story in detail, which is too disgusting
to be more than barely alluded to. She
charged Spurgeon with the awful crime
and Officer Healy Immediately resolved
to place him under arrest.
Mrs. Clark, who claims to be the
leader of God's Regular Army in this
State, returned from Sacramento yes
terday morning, and when first seen
at the army's "home" at 513 Howard
street was in a defiant mood. But as
numerous pertinent questions were
plied to her she became less defiant,
and, although she refused to answer
many of the questions, she managed
to tangle herself up on several points.
Mrs. Clark's whole manner plainly
indicated that she was striving to con
ceal something and once she bluntly
stated that she knew Just what she
wanted published and charged the re
porter not to print anything but her
version of the affair.
It is a dismal place where the mem
bers of the "army" live; a typical
tenement, extending with its additions
far back from the street, with a filthy
little court to furnish the only daylight.
All the officers and presumably the
private "soldiers" eat and sleep here.
While the reporter was struggling
with indifferent success to get a
straightforward statement from the
woman, "Captain" George Engleberg,
who is second in command, and seve
ral other officers, joined in, but were
not permitted by their chief to say
anything but' what she wanted to be
made public. Her authority was su
preme and the others meekly bowed to
her will.
Once, when Mrs. Clark declared that
she would only tell what she wanted
published. Captain Engleberg mildly
remonstrated.
"Do not keep anything back, sister,"
he urged, "but, like a Christian woman,
have this whole matter sifted to the
bottom."
"I know what to tell," she retorted,
"and I will only make public what I
see fit."
Regarding the abduction, Mrs. Clark
, at first said that Weiss had no author
i ity to remove the girl, but suddenly
i checked herself, as though fearing to
j get him into trouble, and went on to
! say that she had gone to Sacramento
Monday night, leaving Alice at the
j honie. The child was suffering from
! some ailment, the nature of which she
would not dissolve, and that Weiss,
who went to Sacramento a day or two
later in search of work, took Alice
| along, believing she would receive bet
! ter care with Mrs. Clark than she did
j at the home.
"Did Weiss know where you were
i staying in Sacramento?"
"No."
: "Then how- did he expect to find you
and give the girl into. your care?'
This was one of the many, questions
Mrs. Clark refused to answer.
"If the girl was not abducted, was
her removal reported to the police as
such by an officer of the Army?"
Captain Engleberg broke in here, ap
parently anxious to placate Mrs. Clark.
"I reported the case," he said. "I
did not understand the matter and I
thought Weiss had kidnaped Alice "
Mrs. Clark said she had known Weiss
about two months. He ; had attended
the meetings occasionaly, but was' not
a member of the Army. She denied
that she had more than a passing ac
quaintance with Weiss. When her at
tention was called to the fact that if
such were true he would hardly take
enough, Interest in her charge's welfare
to take, her to ; Sacramento, Mrs Clark
again sought refuge in silence.
Then she was questioned again re
garding the girl, and proceeded to tra
duce her vehemently, being assisted by
Captain Engleberg to the best of his
rS at -& r V? athlef '" Verted Mrs.
Clark. Not long ago she stole $3 50
from under my pillow, and when I
charged her with taking it she at
tempted to. throw it away."
.. "That's true." chimed in Engleberg
and after Mrs. Clark went ' to Sacrf '-
mento I had $2 with which I intended
to get some medicine for her. She took
tWs money, too; at least, I think she
"How do you know she took It?"
"It was in a certain place when I
went out, and when I returned it was
gone."
''Could not .Weiss have taken it 2"
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 5, IS9B.
Engleberg did not know but he cduld.
It was taken the day Alice and WelSB
went to Sacramento and the captain
thought It was used to pay her fare
there.
Mrs. Clark rallied to Weiss' defense
and warned Engleberg not to make
any rash accusations, saying It was a
serious thing to charge anybody with
theft without being at)le to prove it.
All through the interview she mani
fested the greatest solicitude for Weiss
and endeavored to shield him in every
possible way.
"If Alice was such a bad child, why
did you keep her with you?" Mrs.
Clark was asked.
"I often thought of sending her
back to Portland. I couldn't do any
thing with her. She says here In The
Call that she had to wait on me and the
other grown people. Why, that child
required my almost constant care.
What could a girl of her age do?"
Mrs. Clark proceeded to recount the
little girl's misdeeds before she brought
her from Portland, and said that two
families with whom she had found a
home were compelled to send her back
to the public Institution from which
she had been taken.
At this Juncture a bright little fel
low of about 11 years came up and En
gleberg announced that he was Alice's
brother. ''I found him one day when
I was cutting wood near Portland."
he said, "and learning that he had no
home I took him and am trying to
bring him up properly."
Calling the lad to him, Engleberg
said: "Tell the gentleman jusi how
you are treated here. Don't you get
three good meals a day?"
"Yes," replied the boy, meekly.
"Don't I always treat you woll; do I
ever whip you unless you deserve it?"
"No," came the reluctant answer.
"I admit," continued the Christian
soldier, turning to the reporter, "that
I whip the boy at times and once I
whipped him very hard, but it was only
when he deserved it."
The little fellow was so carefully
watched that no opportunity presented
itself to question him alone. Had he
been able to tell his story free from
the warning glances of Engleberg and
Mrs. Clark it is probable he could re
veal some unpleasant secrets of the
"home."
Mrs. Clark was next asked to explain
her meeting with Weiss in Sacramento.
She said she met him on the street
about 4 o'clock last evening, and he
told her that h,e had Alice with him.
Weiss said he had left the child with a
woman while he searched for Mrs.
Clark. Together they went to the
house, but found that Alice had been
taken in charge by the Sacramento
authorities.
They hunted up Officer Healy, who
had taken Alice away, but for some
reason, which Mrs. Clark would not
explain, he refused to let her have the
child, and the couple departed. Mrs.
Clark refused point blank to repeat any
of the conversation that took place be
tween her and the officer, but ad
mitted that she did not see Alice.
"When her attention was called to
the statement that Officer Healy was
looking for Weiss for the purpose of
placing him under arrest for his horri
ble treatment of Alice, and that if
Weiss had shown himself he would un
doubtedly have been placed under ar
rest, Mrs. Clark made no attempt to
explain, but reiterated that Weiss had
gone with her.
"Where is Weiss now?"
"I jlon't know, unless he Is in Sacra
mento."
"Is he likely to return to San Fran
cisco?"
"I can't say. He went there look
ing for work."
The reporter continued his investiga
tion in another direction, and learned
that it was the common practice to
send the little boy out at 4 or 5 o'clock
In the morning, and again at night, to
make a tour of the bakeries and res
taurants begging for stale bread.
In these expeditions his sister was
often compelled to accompany him.
Stories were told of the extremely
friendly relations existing between
Weiss and Mrs. Clark, but the most
revolting accusation made was that
Alice was afflicted with a most loath
some disease, which was known to
Mrs. Clark and the others.
A second interview was had with
Mrs. Clark, during which she became
more tangled up than at first, and
several times she flatly contradicted
statements she had made previously.
She was first taken over the ground
covering her trip to Sacramento and
her meeting with Weiss there. She re
peated the statement that they had
gone together to the house where
Weiss had left the girl, but could not
tell what the woman had said, and
finally admitted that she did not see
her, but that Weiss had gone there
alone. Regarding her visit to Officer
Healy, Mrs. Clark was in sore distress
when called upon to explain why she
did not see Alice. She located the offi
cer's office in a stable, and added that
he might have had another office where
Alice was kept.
Mrs. Clark was positive she would
be given possession of the girl in a few
days, but again refused to relate her
conversation with the officer.
She was next questioned about the
nature of Alice's ailment and what she
had done for her. She said first that
she had taken her to a doctor whose
name she could not remember, nor
could she give his address.
Being pressed for a definite answer,
Mrs. Clark changed her story, and said
that Alice had been taken to a free
clinic, the exact location she did not
know, although she knew about where
it was. She could not tell the street
it was= on, thr.ugh, and would give no
definite location.
She refused positively to state the
nature of the child's ailment, and when
asked if the little one had been sub
jected to the most fiendish maltreat
ment, Mrs. Clark would neither deny
nor admit it, but said there was a
proper time and place to make a state
ment, and until that time arrived she
would keep her lips sealed.
Before the close of the interview,
however, she begged that nothing be
said of the affair, as it would injure
the army.
SWINDLED A WOMAN.
Mrs. Risto Imposed Upon by a Well
Dressed Stranger.
A well dressed man entered a grocery
store on the Mission road last evening
and called for a bottle of whisky. After
receiving the llauor he tendered Mrs.
Risto, who conducts the place, a $5 Con
federate bill. Convinced that it was gen
uine, the unsuspecting woman gave him
i 4 in change. The stranger then left the
store.
It was not until some time afterward
that Mrs. Risto discovered that she had
been imposed upon. She at once visited
police headquarters and reported the mat
ter to Chief Lees. From the description
given of the man the police are satisfied
that he is the same individual who has
succeeded in passing several Confederate
bills on storekeepers south of Market.
NO TRANSFER, NO SALE.
A Personal Property Ruling by the
State Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court yesterday made an
important ruling upon the matter of sell
ing and transferring personal property.
The case was that of R. J. Davis, as
signee for the insolvent firm of the Evil
& Grant Farm Implement Company
against the Winona Wagon Company
The latter sold to the Bull & Grunt peo
ple a lot of vehicles, on ;ime, and ihe
debv stood on the books for a much
longer period than was desired by either
party. The purchasers, not seeing their
way clear to make good the amount, the
wagon company agreed to take back the
wagons, and thus the debt would be li
quidated. This was done and the title
passed to the wagon company, but the
property remained in the hands of the
Bull & Grant folks, who became the
agents for the wagon company. Several
remittances were made on the goods.
When the Bull & Grant Company went
into insolvency, it transferred all of the
wagons and other stock, held by It as
the agents for the wagon company, to
that concern. This amounted to $14,000
and upon Mr. Davis taking charge of the
defunct firm's affairs he sued the wagon
company for the vehicles, or their value.
The latter showed that title had passed
and won the case in the lower court <<f
this city. Davis was not satisfied and
appealed the case to the Supreme Court.
That tribunal reversed the decision of
the lower court holding that "as to the
creditors of the Bull & Grant Farm Im
plement Company the sale by It to de
fendant was void for there was no im
mediate delivery and change of posses
sion. Neither can there be any question
as to the right of the assignee of the in
solvent debtor, representing the credi
tors, to bring an action of the character
here disclosed."
STBUCK WITH A CANE.
Joseph Kahn Assaulted by Two
Strangers in His Grocery
Store.
Joseph Rahn, who conducts a grocery
store at Minna and Julia streets, was the
victim of a cowardly assault yesterday
afternoon. He was waiting on a custom
er when two well-dressed men entered the
store and called for beer. As he was
stooping down drawing the foamy bever
age, one of the men struck him on the
head with a cane, fracturing his skull.
They then ran from the store, leaving the
cane behind them. The man who struck
the blow is named Barnstein. Some time
ago he had trouble with Rahn and was
worsted. The police believe that In order
to "get even" he visited the store and as- j
saulted his unsuspecting victim. Ram- I
stein up to a late hour last night had not
been arrested.
APPALLING EFFECT
OF INTEMPERANCE
Lecture by Dr. Gardiner of
the State Asylum for
the Insane.
Alarming Increase of Insanity Ib
Found in Nearly All Parts
of t he World.
An Interesting and instructive lecture
was delivered at Cooper Medical College
last night by Dr. Cardiner, superintend
ent of the State Asylum for the Insane
at Napa. There was a large attendance
and the subject was ably handled by the
lecturer.
He said Intemperance, or rather over
indulgence, is responsible for at least 12
per cent of all insanity cases in the United
States, and that the diseuse is on tht; in
crease to an alarming extent all over
the civilized world, the percentage of in
crease of insanity cases in the United
States being greater than the percentage
of increase of the general population,
which was about 25 per cent from 1880 to
1890, while the percentage of increased
insanity cases was 145 per cent during
the same period. He charged the over
indulgence in alcoholic liquors as being
responsible for this appalling condition.
In closing he said: "What must be the
environment of the drunkard's child? No
language can express it; brought into the
world damned with a morbid inheritance
and cursed with a vicious and demoraliz
ing environment. Such children would
constitute objects of commiseration wher
ever they may be found. Every child
has a right to demand a happy home at
the hands of its parents, but these lit
tle waifs, the offspring of intemperate
parents, cast adrift upon the sea of hu
man existence, have their young lives
filled with wretchedness, and their on
ward march through life, all too fre
quently leads thorn to whore the shadows
of a lost Intelligence falls upon them.
A KLONDIKE MINER
LOSES HIS GOLD
The Nimble Fingered Gentry
Succeeded in Relieving
Him of $173.
G. P. Smith Was Ready to Take His
Departure for Alaska This
Week.
G. P. Smith of Stockton, bound for the
Klondike, arrived in the city yesterday
morning with an abundance of gold upon
his person and comparatively little expe
rience. He tried conclusions with some of
the light fingered gentry last night and
now he has the experience but not the
gold.
Smith is an elderly man, who has man
aged by running a livery stable near
Stockton to amass a few hundreds, and
with these in his pocket he left his home
for the frozen gold fields of the north.
When he arrived here yesterday he pur
chased his ticket at the cost of about $60
and an outfit that cost him $90 more. He
had remaining $175. mostly In gold, and
this he carried In his pocket in a buckskin
bag.
Last night he attended the mining Fair
in company with a friend, J. W. Davis, j
In some way Smith was almost knocked
off his feet by the pressure of those be- I
hind him, and as he recovered his balance
he felt a hand drawn from his pocket and
turned in time to see a small fellow mak
ing his way rapidly through the crowd.
Davis saw tin- same fellow. Smith felt
for his bag and It was gone. The theft
was at once reported to Superintendent
Gilmnre. who sent for Detectives Egan
and Davis. The money was about all that
Smith hud left and its loss means a seri
ous thing to him. He was so broken up
over It that he could hardly speak. He
declares that he had made no show of his
money and that no one knew that he had
it upon his person
THE NEW PRIMAEY LAW.
Max Popper Says It Will Prove
Beneficial If Declared
Constitutional.
Max Popper delivered an interesting ad
dress before the Iroquois Club last night
on the Stratton primary law, the consti
tutionality of which will shortly be passed
upon by the State Supreme Court. He
said that it would prove a misfortune to
be regretted by all who are in favor of
clean primary elections, if the court de
cided that the law was not constitutional.
"The Stratton law," said he. "will, if put
in force and effort, kill off the political
bosses and give every citizen an opportun
ity of voting at primaries and an assur
ance that his vote will be honestly count
ed. If it is decided by the Supremo Court
that the alleged flaws In the law are
not there, our primary elections will be
as carefully guarded as our general elec
tions. The penalties following each and
every infraction are so Bevere, that those
who in the past have stuffed the ballot
boxes at the instance of the bosses, will
refuse to longer do crooked work."
After the address there was a practical
illustration of the proposed new system
of primary election given.
It being the Intention of J. F. Kennedy, suc
cessor to Morris A Kennedy, art dealers. 21
Post street, to retire from business, he offers
his large stock irrespective of cost. â¢
CONVICTS "FIGHT.
One Seriously Wounded in a Quarrel
Over a Boy.
An exciting combat took plfrce yester
day among the convicts at San Quentin,
wherein five men were severely cutâ one,
it may be, fatally.
It seems that the men got into a con
troversy regarding a young fellow known
among the prisoners as "Clara Belle,"
owing to his refined and almost girlish
appearance. "Clara" had his champions,
and anyone who opposed them was
doomed to destruction. The result was a
mix-up in which knives were used, for all
five men engaged in the fracas were bad
ly cut. The Injuries of one, it Is feared,
may result fatally.

ALL SANG "GOD
SAVE IRELAND"
Celebration of the Birth
day of Emmet, the
Irish Patriot.
Denunciation of the Proposed
Arbitration Treaty With
England.
Words of Hope and Courage for the
Future Freedom of the Little
Green Isle.
The green and gold of old Ireland, its
harps and its stars, its legends and its
romance, its loving sons and daugh
ters, and the enthusiasm they bring
with them wherever they go â all were
Prominent Figures at Metropolitan Hall Last Evening and Some of the Decorations*
crowded into one small hall last even
ing, to do honor to the memory of
Robert Emmet.
The occasion was the one hundred
and twentieth anniversary of the birth
of the great Irish patriot; the theme
was a protest against any treaty of
arbitration between this country and
England.
The Knights of the Red Branch had
the exercises in charge, and the uni
formed company of that order escort
ed the officers of the evening to the
platform. High over the seat of the
chairman was draped an immense
American flag, its brilliant folds just
sweeping over a harp of fire that
blazed before the large picture of Em
met. Gleaming in white letters across
the platform was the prayer of every
true son of Erinâ "God Save Ireland,"
and under it was the nation's promise
to their martyred hero, "His epitaph
shall be written."
Around the gallery rail the green
and gold hung in tasteful profusion,
and everywhere the golden stars and
the harp and the .shamrock lent their
aid to the silent but beautiful tribute
to the downtrodden isle.
James H. Barry was chairman of the
evening and he introduced those who
took part in the programme. The ex
ercises opened with an organ prelude
of national airs by Miss Marie Giorgi
ani and then the chairman rose for a
few introductory remarks. Though not
an Irishman, he said, he was a friend
of Ireland, and he was proud to preside
over a meeting for such a P ur PÂ° se ,.^
on such an occasion. J. V- Grodjens
was then introduced, and he sang some
of the old songs that Irishmen delight
to hear. The glee club erf Company A.
League of the Cross Cadets, sang some
of Moore's most typical I rish melodies
and then Miss Kathenne Black gave
"The Meeting of the Waters.
The speaker of the evening Hon.
Frank McGowan. was then introduced.
His subject was the life of Emmet,
his struggles for Irish his tri
als his sentence and his death. He
spoke, too. of his personal character, of
his indomitable courage and his intense
patriotism.
Had he lived, he said, fame and hon
or undying would have been his. His
failure and his death disposed of only
the individualâ the principles for which
he fought and died will remain un
changed forever, and there will be oth
ers who inspired by his glorious exam
ple, will take up the banner Emmet
bore, and liberty will be once more en
throned on the Emerald Isle.
"He was a man of the people." said
MoOowan. "His dream was not the es
tablishing of a kingly powerâ he fought
for the principles which created Amer
ica and France. His was not a fight
against a peopleâ it was against a cruel
and diabolical oppression." McGowan
then referred to arbitration, and de
clared that any treaty with England
establishing that as a method of set
tling differences would be little better
than a crime, and he cited the career
of Emmet as one to recommend itself
to a nation whose honor was at stake.
"She is Far From the Land," another
of Moore's melodies, was then ably
sung by Miss Daisy V. Keane, nor
would the audience let her go until she
had sung another of the poet's songs.
Interrupting the applause which fol
lowed Miss Keane's music, Mr. Barry,
the chairman, introduced Mr. Barry,
the colonel, and Colonel Barry read
some* resolutions against arbitration.
They were the same that had been sub
mitted to the convention of Hibernian
societies which met last Sunday to ar
range for the celebration of St. Pat
rick's day. They declared most unmis
takably against any form of arbitra
tion* and the unanimous roar oÂ£ na~
proval which arose when a vote was
called showed they were none too
strong for the people assembled.
Leo Cooper was then introduced to
read the impassioned address of Em
met Just before he was sentenced to be
hanged. It is a speech every true
Irishman knows almost by heart, and
the words of the patriot, spoken almost
at the edge of the grave, roused the
audience almost as it did when the
martyr's words rang through the court
room. His touching appeal that no
man should write his epitaph until Ire
land was free explained the significant
phrase lined in white across the plat
form, "His epitaph shall be written."
Mr. Barry rose to make a few an
nouncements, but the enthusiasm en
gendered by the patriot's words, so
well reproduced, led him on to make
what he termed "almost a speech." It
was a denunciation of arbitration, and
when he had finished and the audience
had applauded he meekly apologized
for his departure from the programme,
whereat the audience applauded the
more.
Miss Black then sang "The Star
spangled Banner," and the audience
rose and joined in the song, "God Save
Ireland," until the ceiling Fhook with j
the tuneful prayer for the little green i
isle.
BY FALSE PRETENSES.

HAWAIIAN DELEGATES
RETURNING HOME.
They Arrived Late Last Night, Tired
but Happy Over Their
Success.
James K. Kaulia. William Auld and
D. Kalauokalani. the three returning
delegates who have been in Washing
ton working successfully against Ha
waiian annexation, arrived in the city
late last night on the delayed over
land, and went to the California.
They expressed their satisfaction at
the success that has attended their
mission, which has demonstrated to a
certainty, they said, that the annexa
tion of the islands will never be an ac
complished fact.
"Annexation will never take place,"
said Mr. Kaulia. "It has been impos
sible for those favoring that side of the
controversy to obtain anything like a
majority even under the most favor
able circumstances, and we feel that
we can go back to our home with the
knowledge that our trip has not been
in vain. Mr. Richardson has remained
behind in Washington to look out for
the interests of his party and I cannot
say when he will return.
"Yes, the Queen, when we left her,
was in excellent health and spirits, and
will, I think, remain in Washington for
some time to come.
"We are on our way home and will
leave the city as soon as possible â pos
sibly on the next steamer or the one
immediately after."
