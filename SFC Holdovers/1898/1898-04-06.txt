HERR ANDREE NOW
REPORTED TO BE
SAFE ON LAND
Startling Story Brought Down From the
North by a Mail Carrier Just
From Dawson City.
Jack Carr Wants to Sell the News for Which the
Whole World Has Been Waiting Since the
Intrepid Explorer Sailed Away.
VICTORIA, B. C. April 5â
Jack Carr, a United States mail
carrier, arrived here to-night
from St. Michael, Alaska, via
Dawson City. Carr claims to
have a message from Andree.
one of his carrier pigeons having
been picked tip. 'It is stated
that the message says that An
dree is alive and on land.
It is now nine months since Ilerr
Andree, the intrepid aeronaut and ex
plorer, ascended in the "Omen" (the
eagle), a balloon built especially for his
daring purpose to endeavor to discover
the pole. It was on Sunday, July ii,
t lat the Swede started from Danes
Island and accompanied only by two
companions, Nils Strinburg and Knut
Frasnkel. Since then but little news
has come from them, the only intelli
gence received by the world being from
a Danish whaler who picked up one of
the carrier pigeons tak... in the Omen.
and the continued absence of news was
taken by the entire world to mean that
the men had met their deaths.
Now the startling statement is made
that the brave trio of Swedes were
alive. The news was brought by Jack
Carr. the well-known United States and
Alaska mail carrier, who for seasons has
brought the mail from Americans so
journing in the wilds of Alaska.
As will be remembered, Carr was the
first man to give the startling news of
rich finds on Bonanza and El Dorado
the v. crid. He cane dd r >vn
on the steamer City of Topeka in Feb
ruary last with mail, and in an interview
with your correspondent gave details of
the enormous wealth found in Klondike.
all of which was then laughed at by the
world, but afterward proved true.
Carr left St. Michael on Thanksgiving
day last and journej'ed up the frozen
Yukon with a dog team and light supply
.of provisions. He first called at Minook,
where he collected nearly iooo" letters
from men who were on ice-bound
steamers and who are pow encamped at
Rampart City and vicinity.
Much mining activity is going on

recorded from this district shortly.
Passing from Minook from post to post
along the big Alaskan rive-r the veteran
mail carrier arrived at Dawson City.
leaving the Klondike metropolis on
March 2 and still traveling lightly with
dog team, making his way over ice
bound rivers and lakes to the Chilkoot
trail, to salt water, where he took pas
sage down.
On arriving at the coast he became as
close as a clam about his news and
would not talk save for a consideration.
Arriving at Departure Bay, he began to
auction his story, starting the bidding at
$1000.
The facts given above a- c supplied by
those on board the Centennial, who
gleaned them from Carr at various times
during the trip.
CHICAGO, April s.â Evelyn B. Bald
win, who visited the Andree balloon sta
tion in Spitzbergen and who volunteered
to accompany the daring aeronaut on
his voyage to fie north pole but could
not on account of the limited capacity
of the balloon, was interviewed by the
Associated l'ress this afternoon regard
ing the bulletin from Victoria, B. C.
Mr. Baldwin said:
"While I scarcely believe the report
to be true (it seems too good to be true)
yet I realize that it is not impossible
that Andree may have arrived in Alas
ka, for to accomplish that feat was his
most ardent desire. That he could have
done so by this time provided this bal
loon carried him far enough eastward,
mv to son a point on the sea ice in
North Alaska, is proven by the safe
arrival of a captain of one of the whal
ing vessels fast in the ice off the north
coast of Alaska after a six months'
journey southward.
"Andree may have arrived at some
point in the Tchookche Peninsula, off
Northeastern Siberia, last autumn, as
Baron Nordenskjold believed he would
and 'as Andree himself thought he
might, and thence made his way acrnps
Bering Straits to Alaska. Personally, I
have held that Andree would most like
ly be heard from In Franz Josef Land,
and had about made complete arrange
ments to assist in the search for him
in that region, my plans being to start

next month. I received a letter this
morning from Certain Ernst Andree of
Sweden, a brother of the balloonist, and
the captain expressed his belief in his
brother's return and that the world
would hear from him not later than
next August."
ANDREE'S PLAN TO
DARE THE WORST.
He Believed He Could Cross the Arc
tic Ice Fields in a Balloon of
His Own Making.
Dr. A. S. Andree, .the Swedish aero
naut, and his two companions left
Dane's Island on the northwest coast
of Spitzbergen on the morning of July
11 of last year on their journey into
the unknown. The crew of the Eagleâ
for so the historic bailoon was named
consisted of three persons. They were
Dr. A. S. Andree, who headed the ex
pedition; Nils Strindberg, a young Swe
dish scientist and aeronaut, and Knut
Fraenkel, a civil engineer. All three
were of robust constitution and had
much experience in the frosty climate
of the north of Sweden and Norway.
It had been intended to start the cx
i pedition during the summer of 1896, but
adverse conditions led to its temporary
abandonment at the last hour. Last
! year, however, final preparations were
i early afoot and at the beginning of
June Dr. Andree and his two compan
' ions journeyed to the starting point and
| the filling of the balloon with its ne
! cessary gases was completed by June
| 21. Then a delay occurred until the
meteorological conditions were- fftyora
Me for tl\e start.
'me ballon was constructed in Paris
at a cost of about $10,000. It had a gas
capacity of about 170,000 feet and from
its top to the bottom of its car it was
close to 100 feet. It was CT l^ feet in
diameter and weighed about 2900
pounds. Although the ballon may be
regarded as being in almost every re
spect a novelty, the most striking char
acteristic was the guiding and steering
apparatus. This consisted mainly of
j guiding ropes of different lengths, the
| shortest being about 1000 feet and the
'longest about 1200 feet in length. These
ropes hung from a bearing just above
the car and dragged along the earth
or ice. The idea of having different
lengths of rope was that in case one
of them got foul of some object the
others would run free. â  These guiding
ropes were to drag after the balloon
and to be shifted by the voyager as he
willed, so that their weight and hold
on the balloon should effect its course
in one direction or the other.
The car, however, was the most in
teresting part of the whole aerial vessel.
It was only about five feet deep and
a little over six feet in diameter. It
was covered with a lid of basket work,
and in the lid was a trapdoor to allow
the explorers to pass through. It was
the plan for one man to sleep at a time
while the other two were at work and
at watch. The latter were to stand
on the lid partly screened from the bit
ter wind by canvas. At about the
height of their waist there was a large
ring of about the same diameter as thu
car and on that were firmly fixed the
scientific instruments of the expedition.
At Dane's Island, where the start
was made, a shed was constructed to
protect the balloon from the strone
winds while it was being filled and pre
pared for the voyage. When all ras
| in readiness the shed was torn away
and the huge aerial ship was liberated.
It started almost directly for the nortn
at a rate of about twenty-two miles an
hour and in a few minutes it. with its
I trio of intrepid explorers, was lost to
j the view of the few who assisted In
| starting it on its voyage into the un
explored regions of the north pole.
For a year before the start was made
circulars were distributed to all thfc
points visited by civilized persons in
j the northern latitudes, telling of thÂ«
I expected voyage of the balloon with its
i explorers and asking those who should
I see it to report its appearance as quick
j ly as possible and to assist those who
i might be with it. Such circulars were
distributed along the coast of Alaska
j and Siberia by the whalers who go that
way each year, and the Russian Gov
ernment sent out special envoys to its
I subjects along the northern coast of its
territories, asking that all assistance
! possible be given to the expected voy
i agers.
A supply of floating buoys was car
' ried by the voyagers for the purpose
, of dropping messages in the sea as the
i balloon progressed . in the hope that
1 some of them would be recovered by
j whalers and so carry word out of the
' advance made by the expedition. There
â¢ were also a number of carrier pigeons
! taken in the car of the balloon. Since
i the start was made four of the pigeons
| have been found, all carrying messages
! from the aeronauts, but none of the
j buoys were found. All of the mes
\ sages brought by the pigeons were
hopeful in tone, but they were all sent
within a few days after the voyage
was commenced. Then, as the weeks
| went by and no news was received of
i the balloon, Arctic explorers began to
make preparations to commence a
search for the three men who risked
! their lives in the unknown Arctic re
i gions in the interests of science, but so
j far none of them have started.
TO-DAY CONGRESS
WILL DECLARE FOR
WAR WITH SPAIN
Little Chance That the President's Mes
sage Will Leave Any Other Course
Open to This Country.
Mediation Has Been Rejected, and It Remains
Only to Resort to Armed Intervention to
Secure the Freedom of the Cubans.
NEW YORK, April s.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Congress will have President Me Kin
ley's vigorous indictment of Spain at
noon to-morrow. The verdict of war or
peace will then rest with that branch of
the Government. The President stands
ready to execute the will of Congress to
the utmost extent. The accurate fore
cast of his message, published in the
Herald this morning, shows that he con
siders forcible intervention to be the
only method now left for bringing to an
end the war in Cuba, securing repara
tion for the loss of the Maine and 266
American lives, and restoring peace
and order in the Pearl of the Antilles.
His message is so emphatic on this
point as to leave no room for doubt
that this is the line of action Le
hopes and expects Congress to take,
although he does not in his message
attempt to ouline the form of reso
lution he desires Congress to pass.
As stated in the Herald this morning,
he will not make any recommendations
looking to the. immediate recognition of
Cuban independence. On the contrary
his line of argument on this subject
clearly shows that he adheres rigidly to
his opinion, long entertained, that the
Cubans have not yet reached a status
which, under international law, would
justify the United States, in the eyes of

MADRID, April 5.â imagine that President McKinley has at <<
any time sought the Intervention of the Pope is, to my knowledge, 4
without any foundation. The truth is, the Pope caused certain in- 4
quiries to be made as to the condition of sentiment in Washington. 4
Its fully serious character was reported to him from there and 4
seeing war was imminent he determined to do all possible to avert It. 4
His Holiness was told that Spain's granting an armistice was 4
absolutely necessary. At the same time he was inform. from here 4
that the sentiment of the army was an obstacle to granting it. 4
Upon this the Pope made the suggestion to the . Queen, in 4
whom he takes the greatest interest on account of her deep piety. <
that he was th- father of the army and should command its heads 4
to accept his verdict in the matter, which was that an armistice be <
granted. -^
This is the simple truth, which nothing can move. Thj report 4
cabled from Washington stating that General Woodford has been 4
notified to instruct American citizens to withdraw from Spain is er- <â 
roneous. The fact is that General Woodford's daughter and niece 4
are on a pleasure trip to Toledo, which is a su..icient reply to the <
statement. 4

He stands ready and willing to do
all in lii 3 power to bring about the
freedom of Ouba, but the question of
prime importance in his mind and
the one requiring immediate aftep

Independence, in his opinion, will be
the inevitable outcome of intervention
such as he favors, but there must be a
new and stable form of government be
fore there is anything to recognize.
The reasons for withholding recom

independence at this time were explain
ed to me by a member of the Cabinet
just after the Cabinet meeting to-day.

THE SPANISH CRUISERS
REACH PORTO RICO.

SAN JUAN. Porto Rico. April
5. â The Spanish cruiser Vizcaya
and Almirante Oquendo, which
sailed from Havana last Friday,
arrived here to-day and are at
anchor in the harbor. They were
received with the greatest enthu
siasm. As soon as they had
reached their anchorages they
were visited by representatives
of the Colonial Government and
the whole day was one of re
joicing on shore and in the har
bor.
It is understood that the Span
ish torpedo flotilla will be here
in a few days and that the crui
sers have to protect it on its way
to Cuba.
The harbor of San Jut.n is rec
ognized among naval men as the
best point at which Spain could
put the flotilla for strategic pur
poses, and it is a matter of won
derment here that the United
States did not take some action
before the Spanish cruisers de
parted from Havana.
Once in this harbor, the flotilla
will be safe, because it can dodge'
through the Tortugas channel
among the islands where no war
ships can interfere with it and
be out and away toward Cuba
before the United States ships
could solve the problem of its
whereabouts.
vana and we want to do something for
the protection of life and property which
is not agreeable to the insurgents?
They can properly say, you have recog
nized us as an independent country and
have no authority to now dictate terms.
"Suppose some of the insurgent lead
ers want to kill Cubans or Spaniards
who are not agreeable to them? Sup
pose we want to do something to restore
order out of chaos which will ensue
after the entry of the forces of the
United States into Havana? How are
we going to do it if we have given com
plete independence to the Cubans?
" The thing for the United States
to do is to forcibly interevne to stop
bloodshed and starvation in Cuba; on
the grounds, too, that our commerce
has suffered for years. After we
have reached Havana and restored
order, we can then decide whether in
dependence shall be granted to the
Cubans.
"It can be decided whether the insur
gents are capable of self-govennnent.
If they are not, we can establish a gov
ernment which we think will be stable
and will continue peace and order on
the island. It is not our thought, or ftie
thought of the President, to acquire ter
ritory. We simply want to take right
and proper steps at this time. We do
not think it is advisable to grant inde
pendence to the Cubans until we go to
Havana and know more about the con
dition of affairs and the men who are
now running the insurgent government.

country has even seen the insurgent

that government. The United States

SPAIN BUYING
SMALL ARMS IN
GREAT QUANTITY
She l-jas No Need of These
Thiogs for the Army Mow
in the Field ir) Cuba.
NEW YORK,' April 5.â A Washington spwili io the Herald says:
Bankrupt as she is, Spain still has sufficient credit ivill. which to pur
chase supplies for her prospective war with the United States. That the
Sagasta Ministry entertains with the McKinley c.n.i Ipistration the be
lief war is inevitable is shown by the purch^ft 1 of ordnance sup
plies she has recently been making. Authoritative Information, has
been received at the Navy Department from the American Embassy in
London that Spain has contracted for the prompt delivery of 200,030
stands of small arms from Victor; Sons & Maxim, and orders have
also been placed for large quantities of ammunition and weapons.
Why Dpain needs so many small arms is the question the author-
ities are asking themselves.
I was suggested to-day that her purpose in acquiring BO many was
to have stock on hand sufficient to equip the people in case the Unit**!
States should attempt to make an invasion. It was pointed out to me to
day that the Spanish troops in Cuba have an ample supply of modern
Mausers and the weapons to be procured cannot, therefore, be destined
fur their armament.
The must sensational suggestion was that Spain intended to equip
an army to invade the United States, but this is a contingency which
the authorities do not anticipate for a moment. There is no doubt in
their minds of the ability of the navy to destroy the navy of Spain and,
once this is accomplished, there is no danger of any attempt being made
by Spain to send an army in unprotected transports to this country
j esides contracting for small arms Spain has been purchasing large
shells for her great guns, located both on shore and on ship board, and
it is admitted by the authorities that she undoubtedly has ample ord
nance supplies for offensive and defensive purposes, for the present.
There is no absolutely definite knowledge on this see-re, for the rea
son that Spain keeps close and secret all information relating to her
condition, but the naval intelligence officers have sufT.jient evidence to
show that she can carry on a war for some time with her present sup
ply.
Besides she has arsenals at work within her own boundaries, and
these arsenals are going night and day, as are those of the United
States. As the State Department failed to hear from Minister Wood
ford concerning the Spanish squadron at Cadiz, and the torpedo flo
tilla at Cape Verde, it is the supposition that the vessels forming
these organizations are still at those points. The authorities admit
they are very much gratified at the present separation of the Spante'i
forces. Her most formidable squadron is .at Cadiz. Her first torpedo
boat flotilla is fifteen hundred miles away and the armored cruisers
Yizeaya and Almirante Oquendo are at Porto Rico.
peace and the establishment of stable
government, they will be sufficient to
commend themselves to the people of
this country and of the ci\..ized world."
The President makes much of the
Maine disaster in his message.
He fully appreciates the feeling of the
country on this point and is convinced
that the first treatment of this phase of
the subject in his message will meet
with the hearty approval of every pa
triotic citizen. He does not regard it
as a casus belli in the full sense of that
term, but he does consider that it forms
the final link in the strong chain of evi
dence which proves conclusively Spain's
mismanagement in Cuba and her in
ability not only to contro. tho internal
affairs on the island, but to protect the
vessels of friendly nations visiting her
harbors.
In other words, it furnishes the
final cause for intervention if not
for war.
So vigorous is the President's ar
raignment of Spain and so complete the
arguments in favor of our right to in
tervene to end the war that the Presi
dent, after his message is made public,
is satisfied that a continuance of our dip
lomatic relations wiÂ»h Spain is no longer
possible. Accordingly, all necessary ar
rangements have been perfected for the
withdrawal of our diplomatic represen
tatives from Spain and from Cuba im
mediately upon the submission of the
document to Congress.
The first steps toward breaking off
diplomatic relations will probably
be inaugurated by Spain.
As soon as the message becomes
public and the Spanish Government
is advised of its contents, it is as
sumed that the Madrid authorities
will recall Minister Polo de Sernabe.
We will then recall Minister Wood
ford and Consular representatives in
Spain and Cuba and transfer our inter
ests to the control of the Eritish rep
resentatives.
There is much dissatisfaction among
the warm advocates of the recognition
of Cuban independence over the infor
mation that the President will advise
against it. This will te the basis of
whatever controversy there may be in
either House over the form of the reso
lution to be adopted. The fact that the
recognition of independence would be
of enormous profit to the â  older.; of so
called Cuban bonds will no. be lost sight
of, and will be used as a strong argu
ment by those who oppose recognition
at this time.
There will be some debate in both
houses and there is reason to believe
that it will be several days at least be
fore the resolution is finally sent to the
President for his signature. It has
been asserted that the President was
anxious to have prolonged debat; so as
to allow further time for a possible so
lution of the difficulties.
I can state authoritatively, how
ever, that neither the President nor
any member of his Cabinet is doing
anything to delay action by Con
gress. On the contrary, the Presi
dent believes that the time for action
which he contemplates in his mes
sage has arrived.
Advocates of the immediate recogni
tion of Cuban independence are laying
great stress on the argument that the
Cuban insurgents do not want interven
tion unless it is preceded by the recog
nition of their independence, and it is
said they will resent intervention with
out recognition.
Speaking of this phase of the ques
tion, Senor Quesada, representative of
the Cuban Junta in Washington, said to
me this evening: "We are perfectly sat-
isfied with the course of the President as
..- outlined in the morning papers. Of
course we should like to be recognized,
but we have no right to dictate the pol
icy of the President, and in any case it
will be only a question of a short time
.until recognition comes.
Minister Woodford appears to be still
hopeful of peace. He cabled the State
Department to-night that there were
â¢further important conferences with the
. Spanish Minister to-day, and that he ex
pected to cable the department some
new developments by to-morrow. Min
ister Woodford's optimistic views are
shared to some extent by certain mem
bers of the administration. The peace
members of the Cabinet fully acquiesced
in the vigorous policy outlined by the
President in his message, because they
believe that an aggressive attitude might
induce Spain to yield to the demands of
America. These men hope that Con
gress when it declares for forcible in
tervention will "authorize" rather than
"direct" the President to take action, be
cause thej- think when Spain once sees
that the President has power it will
yield to our demands before it becomes
necessary to use it.
There are very few public men in
Washington to-night, however, who
look for a peaceful outcome. With the
excited conditions in Cuba they can see
the possibility of many developments
which will bring on war before Con
gress even has a chance to declare for
intervention.
MEXICAN SYMPATHY
IS WITH AMERICA.
Rejoicing at Aquas Calientes Over a
Report That War Had Been
Declared.
EL PASO, April 5.â A dispatch from
Aquas Calientes, one of the principal
cities of Mexico, says that a report that
the United States had declared war
against Spain was circulated there yes
terday and that the news was received
with every manifestation of joy by the
entire population, the event being cel
ebrated in the evening by bonfires and
displays of fireworks. Travelers from
Mexico say this is illustrative of the
sentiment throughout the republic. The
Spaniards in Mexico, while wealthy as
a class, are few in numbers. The sym
pathies of the masses of the Mexicans
are strongly with the United States.

All Americans Getting
Out of the City Be

It Is Said That One Thousand
People Will Start
To- Day.
To These Will Be Added Another

Sunday.

HAVANA, April s.â For some reason
the opinion is generally held by
Spaniards that American Consul-Gen
eral Lee will leave the consulate on j
Thursday, turning his affairs over to
British Consul Gullin. Americans
I have been notified from the consulate ,
that they are to leave at once. The
Mascot will to-morrow carry the
largest list of passengers ever known,
to the boat. The law's limit will be j
I exceeded by probably fifty, and from ;
250 to 350 will go.
A request was cabled to-day for two
extra boats, and the Olivette will be
here on Thursday accompanied prob- !
ably by the Florida. These will carry i
from 500 to 600 between them. Besides
these there are the Fern, Mangrove
and Bache. Tht^se are for General Lee i
and the attaches of the consulate. ;
newspaner correspondents and the few â¢
native-born Americans who are actual |
residents here.
The Orizaba will carry a full quota I
of passengers when she leaves to
morrow evening so that the next two
days will see not less than 1000 leaving
Havana for American shores. Another
thousand will go before Sunday it i
possible All of these will not be <
Americans, the raising of the quaran- j
tine having thrown open the gates to
all those who wish to depart.
General Lee will probably go on the
Fern, which will carry from 75 to 100 j
passengers. The Bache and Mangrove \
will carry about forty each.
All these arrangements have been
openly made and have dune much to
convince the public that the real crisis
is close at hand.
This being the case, the city Is re
markably quiet and self-contained.
There is no disorder, no demonstration.
Americans are treated with the same
courtesy shown them during all the
trying months of the winter, but while
this is true, there is no cessation of j
patriotic fervor. The streets have al
most a gala day appearance. Ladies
are out parading without the shade of
care to be seen in their faces. The j
men chat pleasantly as they watch the :
drilling of volunteers on the prado. j
The shops are open and are filled with i
purchasers. The city is one glare of |
light, martial music fills the air, and |
the clanking of arms is heard, giving
the only tinge of war to a scene which !
otherwise would be as pleasant as one
could wish to see.

Who Fired the Mine That

The United States Government
Has Something Tangible
to Go Upon.
Strong Evidence of the Sale of Sub

Government
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April s.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs'":
Spain's official connection with the de
struction of the battle-ship Maine is in
a fair way of being definitely deter
mined. Desirous of settling the matter
one way or the other, the authorities
are conducting a quiet investigation,
based upon the evidence furnished by I
J. P. Gibbons, an electrical and mining
engineer of England, to Lieutenant J.
C. Colwell. naval attache of this Gov
ernment in London, to which the Her
ald referred this morning. It will be re
culled that the report of the United
States court of inquiry which investi
gated the loss of the Ilaine said that it
had "been unable to â  obtain evidence
fixing the destruction of the Maine upon
any person or persons," but finding
that she was "destroyed by the explo
sion of a mine situated under her
bottom."
The administration is anxious to
have the responsibility of the vessel's
loss fixed, and upon information filed
by Mr. Gibbons with Lieutenant Col
well, is carefully looking into the
matter.
I obtained to-day a copy of Mr. Gib
bons' letter, which has been officially
received in this city.
C' ir r>mander Ri-.-hart l - on niov*"* ' â 
of the office of Naval Intelligence, will
not uibucss the letter in any \.w, ~-l
I understand from officials with whom
he has talked in relation to the matter
that he feels the evidence respecting
the selling of mines to the Spanish
Government is most important. Mr.
Gibbons' letter is dated March 7 and
re"ads:
I personally supplied the Spanish Gov
ernment with a large quantity of submar
ine mines of throe different descriptions,
500-pound ground mines, a Sort-pound buoy
ant mine and a 100-pound electric contact
mine, and I also supplied them with two
kinds of junction boxes, (.1) a box for
one seven-cord cable, (2) a box for one
single-armored cable and eight single
armored cables, each being connected by
means of disconnecting fuse, which would
naturally be fused on the fusing of the
! wire in the detonator of the mine and
consequently explode. The only practical
way of finding out the mine that sank
the' Maine, should the clivers declare that
the plates are indented inward, is by ex
amining cables from the shore to the
mine exploded. â¢
I understand that Mr. Gibbons was
interviewed by Lieutenant Colwell, who
said the man appeared to be thoroughly
in earnest in his belief that one of the
mines supplied by him to the Spanish
Government through ii* representative.
Captain 'Bustamente, originated â¢ the
explosion. Mr. Gibbon? stated that the
mines were heavily galvanized and
could safely remain immersed for sev 7
eral years. He said that the cables
were especially manufactured by him
to resist an indefinite immersion, and
that if any portion could be obtained
he could readily identify it, as it was
peculiar in its construction.
According to information which has
reached this city Mr. Gibbons is a prac
tical electrician, with considerable ex
perience in submarine mining in vari
ous parts of the world, and is a former
non-commissioned officer of the Royal
Engineers. I was told to-day that Mr.
Gibbons does not appear to be finan
cially in good position, and it is sug
gested that he may be desirous of com
ing to the United States -or disposing
of his patented mines.
Especially important is Mr. Gibbons'
testimony in view of the strenuous de
nial made by the Spanish Government,
through its charge d'affaires here sev
eral weeks ago, that there were mines
in Havana harbor.
HAS REJECTED
ALL MEDIATION
McKinley Will Not Per
mit Foreign Interfer
ence at This Time.
This Is a Fact the Powers of
Europe Understand
Perfectly.
Leo XIII Will Still Bo the Strongest
Force at Work for
Peace.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 5.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: President
McKinley has rejected all proffers of
mediation and arbitration because he
feels that nothingbut the prompt admis
sion of our full cl mandâ the ultimate
independence of Cuba â will satisfy the
American people. The outside influence,
which is undoubtedly at work and be
ing proffered to both nations, must
therefore confine itself to Madrid. And
I find that even diplomats of the well
meaning nations at work believe the
influence of the church at the Spanish
capital is paramount to their own.
I am able to discredit to a great ex
tent the London dispatch widely cir
culated to-day that England has re
fused to assist the other European
powers in preventing war. It is pointed
out that the fullest denial of this is
the cautious and careful statement
made in the Ho ie of Commons last
night by Mr. Balfour First Govern
ment Representative in the lower house
and during l.ord Salisbury's illness
practically the Premier of England. He
said the British Government stood
ready to do all in its power to prevent
war.
This statement i.i reflected in the ac
tive participation of the British em
bassy here in a conference held by
leading diplomats at the instance of
their home governments. The British
Embassador was in conference with
the French Embassador and the Aus
trian Minister to-day upon the situa
tion, but they were not preparing joint
representations to be made at the State
Department. They were preparing in
formation for their Governments as to
the best course to be pursued at Mad
rid and as to how long Washington
might be expected to await the result
of Madrid negotiations.
I learn further that at least two of
them believe that time will yet remain
in which Madrid may be influenced.
This is the result of diplomatic activity
in the capital, and is highly important.
It will encourage the renewal of out
side pressure at the Escurial. While
the McKinley Government has made it
plain that it is not in any way subject
to diplomatic influence, it rtill hopes
that the Sagasta Government will fur
ther seek negotiations. The Church of
Rome, it is arguod, has more at stake
than any European Government. Aside
from the humanitarian motive which
would move it, there are immense ma
terial interests. The church's property
in Spain is enormous, and is absolutely
free from mortgage or taxation. It is
by far the most valuable holding in the
whole pninsula. It has long been cov
eted by Spanish republicans. Rome
knows that a crushing defeat at arms
would imperil the dynasty and the
monarchical government more than the
surrender of Cuba. The overthrow of
the monarchy in Spain will mean what
it meant in Mexico â the confiscation of
the great church property and the abo
lition of religious titles, which now
have precedence, and the payment of
all Government taxation. This confis
cation, constantly threatened under the
republic of 1865, would surely take place
now. That is what Rome has at stake.
Then, again, who has such power of
intervention as the Pope? He is the
holy father of both the Spanish and
Cuban armies. It is believed that the
greatest danger to follow the submis
sion of the Sagasta Government to our
demands would be revolt in the Span
ish army. No one could exercise more
influence than the Pope to prevent
â¢this.
CUBAN PEOPLE
WILL BE FRE ED
FROM THE DONS
That, in Effect, Is What the
Foreign Affairs Committee of
the House Will Say.
NEW YORK, April 5.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
Cuba shall be no longer under the dominion of Spain, and the Spanish
flag shall be swept from the island by the land and naval forces of
the United States.
This, In a few words, is the resolution which will be presented to
the House by the Committee on Foreign Affairs to-morrow. The Re
publican members of the committee met to-night, and a unanimous
agreement was reached as to the character of the resolution to be
adopted. The differences which existed at the conference on Sunday
were reconciled, and these two propositions were a-reed to:
First-That the United States shall declare the independence of the
people of Cuba from the Government of Spain.
Secondâ That the President shall be authorized to employ the land
and naval forces of the United States to expel Spain from the island of
Cuba.
There will be no recognition of the republic of Cuba. The United
States will assume no obligations to the Cuban Junta in New York.
The people of Cuba, not the republic of Cuba, will be declared, not rec
ognized, as being independent of the Government of Spain. No agree
ment was reached as to the language of the resolution. This will be
left until after the President's message has been received and referred
to the committee. Many projected forms of res tions were debated,
and various propositions which were suggested for incorporation in
the resolution were talked over, but were not decided upon favorably
or unfavorably.
The only points decided upon were that Cuba should be fre? from
Spain and that the United States should expel Spain from the island.
THE LAST TRIP
TO HAVANA
Plant Line Steamer Mas
cotte Gets Her Orders
at Key West.
Will Proceed to the Cuban
Capital to Take On
Refugees.
Has Let Her Spanish Crow Go and
Will Now Bo Manned by
Americans.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KEY WEST, Fla., April s.âCom
munication by steamer between Key
West and Havana is about to be
closed. The regular mail steamer
Mascotte of the Plant line, plying be
tween this point and Havana, makes
her final trip to-night, to return to
morrow night. Upon her arrival here
from Tampa Captain Hanlon, her com
mander, found instructions awaiting
him outlining his movements for the
next twenty-four hours.
The crew of the Mascotte, now com
posed chiefly of Spaniards, is to be im
mediately discharged and Americans
substituted. Many of these have
served continuously on the vessel for
several years, being desirable during
quarantine season on account of being
immune from yellow fever, thus per
mitting the steamer to have free pas
sage throughout the quarantine
season. t
Upon the arrival of the Mascotte at
Havana to-morrow, she is to be placed
under the immediate orders of Consul-
General Lee, with instructions to sus
pend every quarantine regulation and
take on board, to the utmost limit ot
the steamer's carrying capacity, every
passenger who desires to take passage,
regardless of his nationality.
The only requirement shall be a
permit from Consul Lee. The Mascotte
is to sail from Havana at 1 o'clock, or
as near to her regularly appointed
hour as possible, the intention being
to permit everybody who desires to
leave Havana the opportunity to do
so.
An American crew is now being
shipped to replace the Spaniards who
have been summarily discharged here
from the vessel.
CONSUL LEE SEES
NO PRESENT DANGER.
It Will Take Almost a Week to Get
All the American Consuls
Out of Cuba.
WASHINGTON, April s.âlnforma
tion received at the State Department
from Consul-General Lee at Havana
does not indicate that he regards him
self or the other consular officials in
Cuba in any special danger at this
time, and in reply to the suggestion
that it might be expedient for him to
hasten his departure, he has informed
the department that about ten days
would be necessary for the Consuls
throughout the island to arrange for
their departure, except in case of
emergency. No definite action has yet
been taken in regard to the removal
of the Consuls, but it seems probable
that they will be recalled within the
next day or two. The Government
has given General Lee instructions to
see to the safety of our own Consuls
and all Americans in Cuba, and has
given him full authority to go to what
ever expense is necessary, including
the hire of vessels that may be neces
sary to secure this end.
Secretary Lonf was asked late this
afternoon if he had received any ad
vices from Havana indicating a neces
sity for postponing the President's
message, to which he replied, "No, the
message will go to Congress to
morrow."
SHIPS TO TRANSPORT
AMERICAN CITIZENS.
WASHINGTON. April s.â The United
States Government has dispatched a
fleet of six vessels to Havana to trans
port Consul-General Lee and all the
United States consular officers, to
gether with all Americans now in Ha
vana and vicinity who desire to leave
the island of Cuba. The names of the
vessels are the Bache, the Fern and
the Mangrove, all Government tenders;
the Olivette and the Mascotte of the
Plant system, and the steamship City
of Key West, which have been char
tered and form a part of this fleet.
In addition to these vessels Consul-
General Lee is authorized to charter as
many other merchant vessels now lying 1
in Havana harbor as he may deem
necessary for the safe transport of
American citizens.ENGLAND'S

Mr. Balfour said it could not b> denied

â¢ "We desire to maintain the integrity

be recollected that the future will prob

Mr. Balfour said the Government
thought Russia had pursued an unfor
tunate course In taking- Port Arthur,
â which, as Russia herself said in 1895,
when Japan proposed to occupy it,
would, in the hands of any foreign
r, constitute a menace to the cap
ital of China, In conclusion he said:
"The balance of power in the far
East may be far different when the dis
ration of China has occurred. The
tjrpe may come when the great powers
will say that China shall not fall into
the hands of any one power and to embark
j'.ow upon a difficult and costly enter
prise in order to ward off a remote and
doubtful danger would be political fol
ly. Her Majesty's Government asks
the country to indorse this policy with
more confidence before we know that

Sir William Vernon Harcourt spoke

change of policy. He said the treaty
of Tir-n Tsin gave British ships the

FROM THE PEAK
OF ST. HELENS
Residents Near the Northern
Mountain in Fear of a
Volcanic Eruption.
SEATTLE, April s.â Telegraphic advices received here to-night in
dicate that there is great consternation among the people living in the
towns in proximity to Mount St. Helens. The reason is that the peak
is showing plainly and distinctly evidences of an eruption.
The stately old mountain had for centuries looked peacefully down
on the valleys surrounding it until this morning, when it seemed weary
of its peaceful lassitude and began emitting great volumes rÂ»* smoke
with every evidence of greater eruptions to follow. The near-by resi
dents, who have reported the awakening of t.e mountain, are consid
erably exercised, and hope it will have a speedy and peaceful ending. St.
Helens is a sister peak to Rainier and Adams.
"remarkable change of policy upon the
part of the Government" in taking: a
lease of Wel-Hai-Wel and setting up
a rival port with rival interests. He
added that a military occupation of
part of China miurht be necessary, but
it could not be expedient and it was
impossible to believe the occupation
would be confined to the present modest

The Liberal leader concluded with
calling for information regarding the
Intentions of Russia, Germany and
France and as to the relations between

One San Quentin Convict Pummels
Another for Throwing Rocks
at Him.
SAX QUENTIN, April s.â The lute mill
in the State penitentiary was the scene
of another fight between desperate con
victs at an early hour this morning. As
: a result James Roupe, a prisoner serving
a life sentence for burglary committed in
Napa, was taken to the prison hospital,
and A. Pelanda, an Italian doing three
years for grand larceny in Kings County,
is in the dungeon on a bread and water
diet.
Roupe, better known as "Brockey the
Plumber," is now serving his fourth term
and answers to a score of aliases. Roupe
i is one of the most desperate men in the
â  penitentiary, and was implicated with
i George Williams and George Schlegal in
the attempt to wreck the New Orleans
express at Morrano station on Septem
: ber 4. 1897. Williams and Schlegal are
serving life sentences also.
The trouble leading to the fight was
caused by Roupe throwing bits of copper
and iron at Pefanda's back while the two
1 were at work in the lower part of the
lute mill among the breakers, where the
raw |ute is received and separated. Koupe
kept up the persecution for some time,
until at last Pelanda, with a curse, turned
upon him and beat him over the head
with a club.
Roupe fell, and guards rushed in and
separated the convicts. The Italian was
thrown into the dungeon, while Roupe
! was lf-d to the hospital md the wound on
his head dressed by the druggist.
The Chinaman who ties up the washing
in the laundry revolted this morning and
refused to work. He was ordered to the
dungeon, where he will receive a bread
and water diet for a few days.
DR. BRIGGS APPLIES
FOR HOLY ORDERS.
Confirmed in the Communion of the
Protestant Episcopal
Church.
NEW YORK. April s.â Dr. Briggs Is re
! ported as saying to-day:
"I have conferred at some length with
I the authorities of the Protestant Episco
i pal Church. I have been confirmed In
j the communion of that church. I was
i confirmed in Grace Church by Bishop Pot
ter within a short time. I do not care
|to be more exact as to the time. I have
applied for holy orders. No action has
as yet been taken on that application, so
far as I know. Ido not care to discuss
at the present time my reason for taking
i this step."
Concerning Professor Briggs' future re
! lations to the Vnion seminary a member
of the Presbytery said:
"An Episcopalian in the faculty of T'n
ion would be. as I understand the law,
illegal, for I am sure that the charter
requires all members to be members of
the Presbyterian Church. I know that
this question has been debated by the
trustees and is certain to afford matter
for future action."

SOON TO SAIL
FOR ALASKA
Captain Abercrombie's
Expedition to Go on
the Valencia.
Will Include a Hundred Rein
deer and a Party of
Laplanders.
Topographical Engineers Sent to
Make Surveys and Gather
Data.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, April s.â Captain A. R.
Abercrombie arrived in the city this
evening from Vancouver Barracks. He
was accompanied by four other officers.
This party, with soldiers, Laplanders
and reindeer, comprising the Govern
ment expedition for the exploration
and survey of the Conner River coun
try, will sail for Port Valdes on the
steamer Valencia on April 7. The
stores for the expedition have arrived
here and will be placed on board ship.
The expedition, which will be led by
Captain Abercrombie, is one of the
most important in many respects that
has ever been dispatched to Alaska by
the Government. The men of the party
have been chosen with particular ref
erence to their abilities to withstand
the exposure and fatigue incident to
travel through the wilden.ess. One
hundred head of Government reindeer,
gathered in Northern Europe by the
War Department, have been placed at
the disposal of Captain Abercrombie,
and the party will be supplied with the
services of twenty Laps as herders and
drivers.
The officers of the expedition have
been chosen with an eye to peculiar fit
ness for their duties. Captain Aber
crombie is an experienced plainsman
and a traveler. His knowledge of the
country, gained in a former trip
through the Copper River country, will
be of great assistance to him.
The other officers of the expedition
who are now here are: Lieutenant P.
G. Lowe of the Eighteenth Infantry at
! Fort Bliss, Texas, a topographical en
gineer of great experience and capac-
I ity; Lieutenant J. C. Castner of the
i Fourth Infantry of Fort Sheridan, 111.,
likewise a topographical engineer; F.
C. Schrader of Washington. D. C, a
geological engineer, chosen on account
of his special qualifications for the du
ties he will discharge; Captain W. S.
Kelly, better known as "Yellowstone
Kelly," one of the most noted Indian
: fighters and scouts in the United
: States. Kelly went through the Sioux
I campaigns as the main reliance of Gen-
I eral Miles.
DENIES HE IS A MILLIONAIRE.
General Ezeta Says That His Estate
Is Much Smaller Than
Reported.
Reports have been recently made public
to the effect that General Carlos Ezeta,
the exiled President of Salvador, has
already received a settlement of his es
tates in that place, and that he now has
a sum closely bordering on $2,000,000 at his
disposal. When spoken to regarding these
reports, General Ezeta said:
"I am surprised to see in the press so
many things in relation to myself. I
deny the story of the millions. I am at
this moment demanding the restitution of
some of my property which has been
confiscated, which will not be anywhere
near the amount stated of $2,000,000.
"I have had communications to the ef
fect that the Government will return, or
has already returned my property. In
relation to the law suit, I must assure
you that there is nothing else but the
inexperience of a stranger who has not
the insight of people who wish to bleed
him. Naturally I have to resign myself
to the consequences, so that in the future
I will not be the victim of those people
again. 1 owe In Oakland, as any house
holder may owe, money, and any one
with whom I have lived will inform you
as to whether my bills have been paid on
presentation or not. Sometimes, on ac
count of the irregularity with which I
receive drafts from Central America, ow
ing to the situation there. I may have
been obliged to let bills run for a short
time."

BLAMED FOR
THE RATE WAR
Canadian Pacific Scored
for Its Antagonistic
Policy.
President of the Grand Trunk
of Canada Talks to
Shareholders.
Says the Transcontinental Line Is
Seeking to Crush Connect
ing Roads.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April s.â Sir Charles Riv
ers Wilson, president of the Grand
Trunk Railway of Canada, in a speech
at the shareholders' meeting to-day
said the principle which the present
board had always followed was to F seek
the maximum amount of business at
the minimum cost. He reviewed the
business of the company in detail.
Referring to the rate war, the presi
dent declared that the Canadian Pa
cific Railroad desired an exclusive con
tract with the Grand Trunk Railroad
in order to weaken the Chicago con
nection and damage the Grand Trunk
Railroad's connecting roads to Chicago.
The Grand Trunk Railroad, the speaker
explained, would never give up its close
alliance with its allies.
On the larger question of differen
tials and the Klondike business the
president said that the Canadian Pa
cific Railroad had yet to prove its title
to a differential. The negotiations
would be continued next month and it
was believed an agreement would be
reached.
The president declared the future was
filled with the brightest promise.
An attack upon the board was made
by Mr. Baker of Bristol, who declared
there was no truth in a statement of j
the president regarding the Grand
Trunk Railway not beginning the rate
war, which, according to Mr. Baker,
was brought about in the interest of
the American allies of the road. The |
president denied Mr. Baker's assertion.
The retiring directors were re-elected.
CHICAGO, April s.â Western passen
ger agents held a meeting here to-day
to agree on a common line of action
to be pursued by them at the confer- |
ence to be held with the Canadian Pa
cific next Tuesday, in New York, of the
settlement of the present transconti
nental passenger rate war.
A resolution was offered providing
that the Canadian Pacific be notified
that owing to the position taken by
the Interstate Commerce Commission
in its recent decision, the American
roads are no longer in position to al
low it differential rates on any class of
business whatever. While there were
no negative votes on this resolution
some of the roads withheld their votes
and the proposition is still open for dis
cussion. The whole tone of the dis
cussion was decidedly opposed to mak-
ing any concessions to the Canadian
Pacific road. The meeting will con
tinue its deliberations to-morrow.
TRAVEL OVER THE ICE
HAS BEEN ABANDONED.
Gold-Seekers Are Waiting for the

SEATTLE. April s.â The steam schooner
South Coast arrived to-day from Fort
"W'rangel. She brought down twenty
three passengers, mont of whom are pros
pective gold dippers who had grown
tired trying to get up the Stickeen.
The South Coast's officers report that
travel over the ice has been entirely
abandoned, and that every one is waiting
for the ice in the river to break up. The
weather this winter has been remark
ably mild, and it is believed that the
river will be nppn for steamer traffic
much earlier than usual. The ice is now
said to be running out. If another cold
snap should come of course the opening
of the river would be delayed.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April s.â ln the Alder
manic elections to-day the reform ele
ment elected twenty-five out of thirty
five candidates. Those elected have
pledged themselves to demand for the
city compensation for all public fran
chises. With thirteen holdovers the re
form element will have thirty-eight
votes in the City Council, or a majority
of three. The politics of the Aldermen
elected were: Democrats, 17; Republi
cans, 17; independent. 1.
The returns for town officers show
that the Democrats were successful in
electing the town tickets in the three
great divisions of the city â north,
south and west. The Democrats also
elected the town officers in the town of
Lake. The Republicans elected their
candidates for town officers in Hyde
Park, Lakeview and Jefferson. In
Cicero the entire Republican ticket was
elected.
With the exception of the Nineteenth
Ward, where the reform element was
j defeated in its opposition to Alderman
John Powers, the election passed off
quietly. About 68 per cent of last
spring's mayorality vote was cast.
MILWAUKEE, April s.â The munici
pal election which was held in this city
I resulted in a landslide for the Demo
cratic-Populist ticket, which elected the
entire city ticket by a plurality of about
6000. David S. Rose will be the next
Mayor. It was a victory for munici-
I pal ownership of public utilities. The
convention which nominated the suc
cessful candidates also indorsed the
platform of the Chicago convention
which nominated W. J. Bryan. The
complexion of the new City Couucil will
also be decidedly Democratic, being
composed of twenty-eight Democrats
and fourteen Republicans.
LINCOLN, Nebr., April s.âRepubli
cans elected their entire city ticket to
day by slightly reduced majorities in
a few instances, a factional fight in
the party growing out of the impeach
ment trial of Mayor Graham being
responsible. The fusionists elected
three of the seven Couneilmen. Poli
tics cut little figure over the State,
where the licensing of saloons was the
main issue.
KANSAS CITY, April s.â At 1 a. m.
returns had been received from but 42
of the 13S election precincts in Kansas
City, but the indications are that
James M. Jones (R.) has been re
elected Mayor over Frank P. Sebree
(D.) by something over 1000 majority,
and that Jones will run about 1000 be
hind the other candidates on the Re
publican ticket. The Council is wholly
in doubt, but both sides are claiming
a majority of members elected.
LEADVILLE. Colo., April s.â The
city election here to-day was carried
by the Silver Republicans. The
straight Republicans, Populists and
Democrats had tickets in the field.
ELECTIONS ON THE COAST.

TACOMA, April s.â The Republican
city ticket was elected to-day by ma
jorities ranging from 300 for Johnson
Nickeus for Mayor to 1061 for W. A.
Sternberg for Treasurer. The Repub
licans also elected six out of eight
Councilmen and will have a good work
ing majority. The issue was sharply
drawn on the question of payment of
a large amount of city warrants which
had once been paid by a fcrmer City
Treasurer and subsequently reissued to
innocent parties. The fusionists In
their platform declared against pay
ment of these warrants.
LAS VEGAS, New Mex., April 5.â
The Republican city ticket was to-day
defeated by the combined opposition.
Las Vegas is the home of Governor
Otero.
DENVER, April 5.â A special to the
News from Panta Fe, New Mex., says:
The straight Republican city ticket
was elected to-day over the fusion
ticket by a decisive majority.

As we are by nature subject to many |
diseases, the only way to guard
against all stampedes on our healthisto
make a study of our own physical self.
If a peculiar pain attacks you, try to |
locate its origin and discover which or- j
gan of the body is sick and in need of
attention.
If the kidneys are at fault â and in
almost every case in the failing of our
health they areâ look well to their res-
toration to health and strength.
They are the great filters of our body,
and consequently, the purity of the
blood is entirely dependent on their
cleansing powers.
If the kidneys are not in a perfectly
clean and healthy condition, the blood
becomes impregnated with Impurities
and a decay of the kidneys soon takes
place. If your desire to relieve your- i
self of water increases, and you find
It necessary to arise many times dur-
ing sleeping hours, your kidneys are |
sick. As they reach a more un-
healthy stage, a scalding and irritation
takes place as the water flows, and :
pain or dull ache in the back makes j
you miserable. If the water, when al-
lowed to remain undisturbed for
twenty-four hours, forms a settling or
sediment, you are in the grasp of most
serious kidney or bladder disorders.
If neglected now the disease advances
until the face looks pale or sallow,
puffy or dark circles under the eyes,
the feet swell, and sometimes the heart
acts badly.

There is no more serious menace to
health and strength than any derange-
ment of the kidneys.
Swamp-Root is the great discovery of
Dr. Kilmer, the eminent physician and
specialist, and will be found just what
is needed in cases of kidney and blad-
der disorders and Uric Acid troubles
due to weak kidneys, such as catarrh
of the bladder, gravel, rheumatism and
Bright'a Disease, which is the worst
form of kidney disease.
It corrects inability to hold water and
promptly overcomes mat unpleasant
necessity of being compelled to go often
during the day and get up many times
during the night.
The mild and the extraordinary effect
of this great remedy is soon realized.
It stands the highest for its wonderful
cures, and is dispensed by druggists in
fifty cent and one dollar bottles.
So universally successful is Swamp-
Root in quickly curing even the most
distressing cases, that to Prove its won-
derful merits you may have a sample
bottle and a book of valuable infor-
mation, both sent absolutely free by
mail upon receipt of three two-cent

To the Adjutant-General of the State
of California: Convey to the Governor
this department's thanks for the infor

When asked what arrangements had
been made for supplies to the National
Guard in the event of war the adju
tant-general replied:
"We have been in communication
with different merchants throughout
the State, and at a moment's notice
could supply our men with ten days'
rations."
"In what condition are the arms?"
was asked.
"For the most part good," he replied.
"We have now before Congress a reso
lution which will enable us to make an
exchange of our arms, and as soon as
that resolution passes we will be splen
didly equipped in that respect."
"How about the clothing of the sol
diers?"
"New uniforms for the entire guard
have been ordered and nre ready."
'"What returns, if any, have been
made from the recent inspections?"
"Those I have received have been
verbal, and they show the guard to be
in a splendid condition in every par
ticular."
Referring again to the naval militia
the general continued:
"The naval militia of California has
been used as an example to other
States by the officers of the United
States navy, who have been sent out
here to make inspections. Lieutenant
W. 8. Hughes, the last one here, and
who recently reported to Washington
for duty, told me Just before he left
that he would not hesitate to recom

equally confident myself, and in the

The office of General Barrett pre
sents a busy scone, and between the

quiry as to the state of affairs, the gen

run day and night. The following let
ter is a fair sample of the kind that are
being received there now. It is dated
at Visalia, is addessed to the adjutant
general and is as follows:
In the event of war with Spain I desire
a place in the medical department, either
as surgeon's assistant or hospital nurse.
ELIZABETH R. OSTROM, M. D.
The power lodged in the Governor as
commander-in-chief of the military
and naval forces of the State enables
him, with the consent of one other
member of the State Board of Exam
iners, to raise any sum of money he
may deem necessary for the public de
fense. In fact, the Governor, on his
own motion, may exercise that power.
It is not necessary to convene the Leg
islature in extra session; hence the ex
pense of asession, which is considerable,
may be saved and the money applied to
the equipment of troops.
In the event of a declaration of war
to-morrow, the Governor, the Attorney-
General and the Secretary of State
could meet and authorize a deficiency
of $500,000 to be created. In supreme I
emergency this allowance might be i
multiplied, as "ie constitution places '
no restriction on the means to be em- i
ployed to repel invasion. The unani- i
mous voice of r Board of Examiners
is not required under the law to author- i
ize creation of the deficiency, but the j
assent of two members is required by
the provisions of the general appropria- I
tion bill for the maintenance of the
State Government.
Whenever an appropriation is made ;
for the support of any department or
Institution of the California State
Government, and the money so ap- i
propriated is insufficient for proper I
maintenance, the head of the depart- j
ment >>r institution is entitled to make
an application to the State Board of ;
Examiners to create a deficiency. The I
Board of Examiners makes inquiry as !
to the merits of the application and in j
its judgment may authorize the defi- j
ciency to be created. An appropriation !
having been made in the regular man
ner for the support of the National
Guard and the Naval Reserve as an or- !
ganization of the Guard, the Governor, i
as the head of the department, may !
apply to the Board of Examiners for !
power to create a deficiency.
In Now York, Ohio, Illinois and lowa
and other States it is necessary for the
respective Legislatures to be convened
and measures of appropriation passed
in order to provide money to equip, or
ganize and purchase supplies for the
military forces of the State. The power
vested by the constitution and the laws
in the chief executive officer of Califor
nia enables him to act promptly and to
provide money necessary for placing
the troops in the field at the disposal
of the general Government. Of course
it is well understood and accepted as
an established national principle that
Congress never hesitates to reimburse
a State for money advanced to meet
emergencies of this character.
When the National Guard of this
State was called out to suppress the |
tumult growing out of the railroad |
strike Governor Markham could have I
called the members of the State Board j
of Examiners. A resolution could have i
been adopted authorizing a deficiency, !
and the money for the expenses of the i
campaign might have been drawn di- I
j rectlv from the State treasury. Gov- '
I ernor Markham preferred that the sup- I
plies should be purchased on a pledge !
of the State's credit and the subject of
payment referred to the Legislature. It I
Is called to mind that the troops ob- I
tamed subsistence and transportation i
on credit of the State, but excessive
prices were charged for all kinds of!
supplies furnished. The Legislature, '
when it was convened in regular ses- j
sion, promptly paid all the demands,
among them many extortionate claims.
The officers and enlisted men were also I
paid for the time that they were on
duty.
When it becomes necessary to call out
the military and naval forces of the
State. Governor Budd will pursue a
course different from that adopted by !
Governor Markham. As commander- ;
in-chief, he will provide cash directly !
for the equipment and organization and
subsistence of the forces, and get the
advantage which the buyer in the mar
ket derives from the ability to pay
cash. On such requisition, with proper
voucher, no dealer would think of
charging more than the market price
fur an article required by the troops.
Governor Budd has given due con
sideration to the subject of convening
the Legislature in extra session. He
understands fully that great expense
is attached to a session of the Legis
lature apart from tho per diem of mem
bers and attaches. The cost of light
ing, heating and providing service in
the building is not small. The expense
of printing and binding is great. AH
things considered, it is regarded as a
waste of money to call the members
of the Legislature together in extra
session to perform tho duties which the
Governor is authorized by law to exe
cute.
Governor Budd is fully apprised as to
the condition of the various funds in
the State treasury. Tt is estimated ;
that $1,000,000 could be used without
embarrassment to the public service
The item of $250,000 appropriated for
the debris dams could be used and re
appropriated at the next regular ses- '
sion. i
Recently the Governor and adjutant
general went over the field of probable
action in calling out the troops of the
State. Tho judgment of the Attorney-
General has been Jisked. and it may be
said now that California is in position
to respond at twelve hours' noWce to
any demand the Prosident may make
for the support of this Stato in carry
ing out measures of national defense.
No State in the Union is in position to
respond more readily than California.
THE BXN FBAKCISOO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 6, 1898.
WAR SHOULD
BE DECLARED
Senators Maintain That
Our Dead Must Be
Avenged.
Turner Denounces Minister
Woodford's Course at
Madrid.
Charges Also That McKinley's Sec
retary Is Collecting Peace
Memorials.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 5.
"The United States ought immediate
ly to declare war against Spain and
maintain that war until the people of
Cuba are free from Spanish starvation
1 and cruelty, and the government of the
' island firmly established as an inde
i pendent republic."
This utterance by Senator Chandler
of New Hampshire in a carefully pre
pared statement of his position on the
Cuban crisis, was the climax of an ex
tended discussion of the subject par
ticipated in by several members in the
Senate this afternoon. Speeches had
been delivered b;- Turner of Wash
ington, Harris of Kansas and Ken
ney of Delaware, all of whom took
strong grounds for vigorous and in
stant action by the United States. In
deed, Turner took substantially the
same position as Chandler, basins his
demand for action upon the Maine
catastrophe.
Profound attention was attracted by
a speech delivered by Turpie of
Indiana, one of the members of the
Foreign Relations Committee. Briefly
but scathingly he reviewed th-> Spanish
conduct of Cuban affairs and declared
in the strongest terms for intervention
that would mean something â that
would drive Spain from the control of
every foot of territory in the Western
hemisphere. The speech was a clear,
concise statement of the position in
which this country had been placed
"by Spanish outrages, insults and
crimes."
At the conclusion of the speeches on
the Cuban question the Senate resumed
consideration of the sundry civil bill,
the only important progress made be
ing the adoption in slightly modified
form of the committee amendment sus
pending the forestry reservation proc
lamation of 1897.
Caffery of Lousiana presented a
telegram from the commercial bodies
of New Orleans, which he desired to
have read.
"Is this one of the stereotyped tele
grams in favor of peace which we are
receiving at this time?" inquired Cock
rell of Missouri.
"If it were stereotyped, and if such
telegrams were being sent from all
parts of the country," replied Caffery,
"I should be very glad of it."
"I suppose it is one of the peace tele
grams," said Cockrell, "as I hold in
my hand one of a similar nature from
the Republican City Committee of
Kansas City, Mo."
Platt of Connecticut said that while
he sympathized with the tenor of the
telegrams, he did object to the inser
tion of such matters in the record.
The resolution offered by Turner of
Washington, declaring war against
Spain, was laid before the Senate, and
its author took the floor in advocacy
of it.
The speech was brief, but was given
the most careful attention by both the
galleries and the Senate.
"The fateful question of peace or
war," he began, "belongs in its last
analysis to the Congress of the United
States. Believing in this, I have no
apology for the resolution I have of
fered. I have the greatest respect for
the President and his office, but I have
never been one to 'bend the pregnant
hinges of the knee, that thrift might
follow fawning.' The time has now ar
rived when some expression ought to
be made on this subject by this na
tion. A spectacle has been made of th*
United States in the whole matter.
"With a diplomatic representative at
Madrid," declared Turner, "complicat
ing the business of this country and
defeating even his own frantic efforts
for peace at any price; with a private
secretaryâ the alter ego of the Presi
dent â circulating appealÃ throughout
the country for petitions and memo
rials to control an unruly and unpatri
otic- Congress; with the manner in
which the fate of oyr battle-ship was
treated by this ountry; with the fran
tic appeals for delay, it is not surpris
ing that the American people are out
raged and have given notice to take
the whole matter into their own
hands."
Discussing the Maine disaster, upon
which Turner practically based his
speech, he declared no reasonable man
could fail to realize that the battle
ship was destroyed through the cow
ardice and perfidy of Spanish officials,
who, by their action, made their Gov
ernment responsible for the crime. The
same officials who had laid the mine
had anchored the Maine over it and
had exploded it. The act was cowardly
and perfidious in the extreme, and con
stituted warfare. Turner declared
that it was immaterial whose was the
hand that sent the electric spark on its
fatal mission. Spain was in every sense
responsible for the actâ an act that
ought properly to be resented by the
United States.
A brief but pointed statement of his
position on the Cuban question was
then made by Harris of Kansas. After
reviewing the position of the United
States and Spain with reference to
Cuba, he maintained that for a long
t me this country had been fully jus
tified in enforcing her demands by
armed intervention.
Turpie of Indiana, a member of the
foreign Relations Committee, followed
in a bitter denunciation of Spain and
Spanish policy.
THE POPE ONLY
SOUGHT FOR TIME.
He Had No Illusions About Media-
tion as Between the United
States and Spain.
LONDON, April s.â The Rome corre
spondent of the Daily News says: Both
the Pope and Cardinal Rampolla, papal
secretary, declare that they never had
any illusions about mediation, knowing
that the United States would reject it
and that, any way, it would cause bad
blood between Catholics and Protest
ants there. In fact, the Vatican has
received several dispatches from prom
inent Americans saying the interven
tion of the Pope might seriously retard
the progress of Catholicism in America.
The Pope's only object now is to gain
time fo that both Spain and America
may reflect.
I have heard also that influential pre
lates at the Vatican consider it is well
for the church and the prestige of the
papacy that the undertaking of the
Pontiff proved abortive. They think
that if Leo had been appointed medi
ator he would have found himself in a
delicate position, as, because of his
known affection for Spain, and being
godfather of King Alfonzo, he would
have been open to a suspicion of sym
pathy with Spain, and unless the nde
pendence of Cuba had been granted
the I nited States would have been dis
satisfied.
He would havo found a great ob
stacle also in having to declare for or
against the Monroe doctrine. Strange
to observe, while the intervention of
the Pope, no matter how noble and
genorous, is considered by outsiders a
failure, at to-day's weekly reception
of the diplomatic body by Cardinal
Kampolla he received and accepted
congratulations on the Pope's proceed
ings at Washington.
Cardinal Rampolla himself asserted
that these proceedings had had the re
sult of delaying President McKinley's
message, and he made" it understood
that negotiations were continuing, with
a prospect of obtaining an armistice in
Cuba. It is announced that the Pope,
in order to set the real truth before the
world, will in due time publish a his
tory of the whole affair.
FORT SHERIDAN TROOPS
WILL MOVE TO-NIGHT.
CHICAGO, April 6.â The Times-Her
ald says: Fort Sheridan soldiers will
move to-night at midnight unless con
trary orders are received. The news is
given out by one in authority, but who
will not be quoted. The 800 or more
soldiers of the Fourth Regiment at the
fort will be on their way south, it is
said, by dawn on Thursday.
It is said on the same authority that
the regiment will probably go to Chat
tanooga. The regiment will be trans
ferred at midnight to avoid publicity.
As a part of the war preparations at
Fort Sheridan, the officers have drawn
camp outfits from the quartermaster's
department.
FLYING SQUADRON TO
SEIZE THE CANARIES.
NEW YORK, April s.â The Washing
ton correspondent of a conservative
morning paper says: "The flying
squadron, under command of Commo
dore Schley will move on and seize the
Canaries within twenty-four or forty
eight hours. This from the Navy De
partment is the first positive war order
issuod.
"If it meets the Spanish flotilla the
squadron will capture or destroy it.
The islands will be made the base for
the operations of this country against
Spain."
ITALY SELLS TORPEDO
BOATS TO AMERICA.
NEW YORK, April 6.â A dispatch
from Rome says that the Italian Gov
ernment has sold three first-class tor
pedo-boats to the United States and de
nies that Spain has been able to ob
tain the Italian warship Garibaldi.
ENGLISHMEN BATTLE
WITH DERVISHES.
ABADAR CAMP, south of the Atbara,
Nubia, April s.â Areconnolssance In force,
with cavalry, artillery and two Egyptian
battalions, to the camp of Mahmoud
Pasha this morning brought the enemy
out in force. The fighting lasted from 9
o clock until 10:30. The British loss was
six killed and ten wounded. The Der
vishes lost about 200.
DOWNPOUR OF RAIN.
SACRAMENTO, April 6.-Rain set in
to-night at about 11 o'clock, and is now
falling at a lively rate. Word^was also
received that a good downpour was being
received at Woodland.
STOCKTON, April 6.â Rain commenced
falling here at midnight, and while it Is
not a3 heavy as the farmers would like
to see, there has been a steady precipita
tion and all indications point to a good
rainfall before morning. The wind is
blowing from the south and heavy clouds
are hanging over the city. Liberal rains
are reported up the San Joaquin Valley,
and the crops will be greatly benefited by
the moisture.
SAN JOSE, April 6.â lt began raining
about 11 o'clock to-night and indications
are that it will continue until morntng.
Rain Is needed for the grain crops, and
a number of good showers during the
present month will insure a good fruit
crop. The total rainfall to date is 6.04
inches.
MISSION OF
THE TEXAS
Probably Ordered to Sea
to Protect American
Cruisers.
Will Meet the San Francisco
and New Orleans on the
Atlantic.
Belief That Spanish Warships Had
Been Sent to Intercept
Them.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON. April 15.-The Journal to
morrow will publish the following
Washington special: The battleship
! Texas, which has been In New York un
dergoing some slight repairs, has been
| ordered to proceed at once to sea as
soon as she has finished coaling Her
destination is a secret, and Captain
Phihp, her commanding officer, will
learn whither he is bound only when
he opens his orders at sea.
It is the impression that the vessel
will proceed to the regularly traveled
lines of trans-Atlantic commerce, and
there await the arrival of the cruisers
San Francisco and New Orleans, now
on their way to the United States.
There is considerable anxiety among
naval officers for their safety, for It is
thought probable that the Oquendo and
Vizcaya did not go to Porto Rico, as
was given out at the time they sailed
from Havana, but that they have
steamed north, and are awaiting the
arrival of the two American ships
somewhere near the coast. If this is
true they could easily capture them as
soon as found, thus striking a stinging
blow at the American navy at the very
outset of hostilities.
Nothing has been officially heard of
the two Spanish vessels and their
whereabouts is a matter of uncer
tainty. _______^__^_
SALE OF ORANGES
TO HELP CUBANS.
A Carload From Riverside Will Be
Offered at Public Auction in
New York on Thursday.
NEW YORK, April s.â For the bene
fit of the Cuban relief fund, a carload
of California oranges will be sold at
public auction on Thursday afternoon.
These have been sent by the Chamber
of Commerce of Riverside, Cal., in con
junction with the Riverside Fruit Ex
change.
There are about 300 boxes of fruit in
the consignment. The entire proceeds
of the sale will be turned over to the
Cuban Relief Society, each person en
gaged in packing, shipping and selling
the fruit having contributed his serv
ices. Members of the fruit trade are
prepared to do their share of buying,
and ask for the co-operation of the
general public. It is expected that
from $1000 to $2000 may be realized from
the sale of the oranges.
TORPEDOES SHIPPED TO
THE UNITED STATES.
War Materials Purchased in Ger-
many and Austria Are Now
on the Way.
BERLIN, April 5.â A1l of the pur
chases made by Lieutenant-Commander
A. P. Niblock, the United States naval
attache here, in Germany and Austria,
have been safely shipped. The war ma
terials consist largely of Schwartzkopp
torpedoes. Comrr nder Niblock has re
ceived many offers of vessels and ma
terials, including North German Lloyd
steamers; but the ships offered will not
be finished for months, so the negotia
tions were dropped.
Spain has not purchased any vessels
in Germany.
INSURANCE COMPANY
REFUSES A WAR RISK.
Declines to Issue a Policy for an
American Vessel to Sail
From Cuba.
NEW YORK April s.â Officers of one
of the marine insurance companies de
murred to-day about accepting a war
risk upon an American vessel sailing a
week hence from the south side of
Cuba. The rate asked for was 10 per
cent, but the offer was not accepted.
The rates quoted to-day were about the
same as prevailed yesterday.
The Texas to Sail To-Day.
NEW YORK, April s.â The battle
ship Texas will Bail for Hampton
Roads to-morrow. The new powder
hoisting apparatus was tested to-day
and found to be highly satisfactory.
With the aid of the new appliances the
guns can now be fired three times in
the same time it formerly took to flre
them once.
A Large Increase of Business.
NEW YORK, April s.â The sales of
the Remington Standard Typewriter,
the world over, for March this year
largely exceeded any previous month in
its history. Typewriter sales are a
good barometer of general industrial
conditions.
SPANISH
MINISTER
HOPEFUL
He Gives an Authorized
Interview to the Ameri=
can Press.
Does Not Think His Country Has
Received Fair Treatment at
the Hands of This
People.
WASHINGTON, April s.â The Span
ish Minister, Senor Polo de Bernabe,
was seen at the Spanish legation to-day
and consented to talk on the present
condition of affairs. He spoke freely
and at times with intense earnestness.
The interview is authoritative through
out.
"I am still hopeful of peace," Bald he.
"That may seem optimistic at a mo
ment when such passions are aroused,
such naval and military operations are
going on and when the current of pub
lic sentiment seems to be that war is
inevitable. I cannot say that I base
my views that peace will prevail upon
any direct or official information. On
the contrary, I express my individual
judgment based solely upon the convic
tion that in these enlightened days two
self-respecting nations, made up of
men and women of high aspirations and
noble instincts cannot resort to that
last and brutal expedient of war. It
would be too wanton, too criminal, too
offensive to all the dictates of civiliza
tion and Christianity, for such and
awful consequence to be brought
about. To be sure, I cannot close
my eyes to certain obvious cir
| cumatances existing, both here and in
Spain. At times these have inclined me
to share the popular view that the re
lations between the two countries were
fast approaching an irreconcilable is
sue. And yet at no time has it seemed
to me, nor does it now seem, that the
issue has progressed beyond the bounds
of a reasonable and just settlement,
alike honorable to both Governments.
"Consider for a moment some of the
! elements of this present crisis," tne
! Minister went on, speaking with much
I vigor. "Can it be possible that your
I people will consider only one side of the
I case? Let us for a moment admit that
1 there are two sides to this case.
â¢There are always two sides to a case,
! and is it just or fair or chivalrous for
i your people, borne on by strong
i and innate patriotism, to say 'We
are right; Spain is wrong; that ends
' it?' In a spirit of simple justice, why
will not this disposition yield for a mo
ment to a calm consideration of both
sides of the case, including some of
those factors which are vital and es
sential to Spain. â¢
"Cuba has been a colony of Spain
from time immemorableâ from the time
of its discovery by Christopher Colum
busâand as a part of Spain there is
clustered about it a reverence that is
almost sacred. Cuba is regarded by
our people just as you regard one of
the States of your Union. What
would 'be said if some foreign
power said to the United States that
Illinois or Texas or California must be
free and independent of the United
States? Would not your very honor
be brought into question? Of course I
can understand that some one will rise
up and say 'Yes, but the States are
well governed and are at peace, while
Cuba is misgoverned and in a state of
insurrection.'
"There, again, simple justice and
fairness demand that there be some
thing more than abstract assertion. To
be sure, your press tells of brutal sav
agery existing in Cuba. Ido not wish
to deal in recrimination. The time
for that has gone by. But I give you
my word that this savagery .does not
exist at all, that all reliable reports,
official and unofficial, Spanish and
American, agree that whatever may
have been the condition of affairs a
year or two years ago, General Blanco
has inaugurated a humane and beneti
cent system characteristic of the man.
Naturally, with an insurrection in pro
gress, military affairs have pursued thw
usual methods of military life. And
in this they have been constantly re
strained at all times by the determina
tion to have their operations worthy of
an honorable nation and an honorable
people. That is all Spain has sought
to do in putting down a rebellion. It
is what any government on the face of
the earth would do. It seeks no more
and no less than to preserve her estab
lished rights.
"Now, as to autonomy. For some
reason intense feeling has been aroused
in this country against tho home rule
regime which Spain hn inaugurated in
Cuba. It seems to be overlooked, in the
passing of the moment, that this home
rule has been the aspiration of the
Cubans for years. It seems to be over
looked also that President Cleveland
and Secretary Olnev urged a full meas
ure of home rule as the means most
likely to bring about a termination of
the Cuban conflict. Spain has granted
that, granted it with the deepest sin
cerity. There is a disposition to find
flaws in the details ct the plan. Let
any one who is anxious to pick flaws
and who cares for war take this home
rule plan and examine it in detail. He
will find tl- t it gives the Cubans the
most eomnWe control "~1 their own af
fairs. They have a â¢ arliament of their
own and a cabinet of their own min
isters. Is it fair, just as this local
parliament and local cabinet is about
to assume complete control of the
Cuban affairs, to sweep aside this en
tire system and t declare that it is a
failure before it has even been tried?
I do not â ish in this to repeat an argu
ment for autonomy but simply to call j
attention to the fact that plain Justice
dictates that 8 system of horn > rule,
brought forth after the deepest solici
tude and consideration and based upon
what the Cubans themselves have long
desired, and what the United States
Government deemed most fitting as a
settlement, should not be lightly dis
missed on representations of the press,
or even on the representations of men |
of sober judgment. If the latter say I
that this home rule is not a success I
reply, 'Your opportunities for investi
gation have not been adequate, and
moreover, success or failure cannot be
judged before a system has been tried
and when its initial steps have been at
tended by difficulties not only in the in
terior of Cuba, but circumstances with
out tending to defeat the very end
sought.' Even though we may differ
in this, at least we should agree that
the judgment of one should not be
formed arbitrarily upon the other. For I
the moment it seems as though thlÂ«
equitable view was set aside and in
stead we hear 'Autonomy is a failure.
We say so. So that ends it. Spain must
not say that she is either sincere or
that the plan is a success.' Now is
such an attitude consistent with tha
usual process cf considering both sides
of a question? Can a self -respecting
nation admit of such a contemptuous
disposition of a policy she has presented
in the interest of peace and prosperity
for Cuba?
"As to the reconcentrados, I can only
say that the decrees of concentration
have been revoked and urgent steps
are being taken for the relief of these
poor creatures. While there is no doubt
of the misery of their condition, the
Government is making the most heroic
efforts to alleviate this condition. Aa
to the insurgents, they have bornÂ»
arms against Spain for three years, en
tailing terrible loss of life and money.
And yet, believing these men to be mis
guided, the Government has sought to
regain their confidence. Even to-day
the Official Gazette at Havana pub
lishes an appeal by the home rule Gov
ernment urging all those in arms, in
surgents as weil as Spaniards, to cease
hostilities, join hands and unite in cel
ebrating the restoration of peace. It
tells them also that if this home rule
is not perfect it may be improved.
In short, the insurgents are invited to
Join the Spanish soldiers in laying
down their arms, saying that a period
of calm may be giveni during which
just and wise counsels may prevail for
the permanent betterment of Cuba.
Whether this will succeed I do not
know. It seems as though some of the
insurgent leaders, and partioularly
their Cuban advisers in this country,
were bent upon an irresponsible policy,
and were deaf to reason, to a cessation
of arms or to any proposition calculat
ed to restore peace, no matter how
beneficial it might be for Cuba,
"You ask me as to the latest phases
of negotiations. Of this I cannot speak,
owing to the restrictions of my posi
tion. I can only say that, despite the
animosities aroused, I believe that calm
counsel will yet prevail and that the
United States and Spain will be ab!e to
solve this problem on a basis Just and
honorable to all concerned and without
recourse to arms.

SUIStJN. April s.â The taking of tes
timony in the case of Frank Below com
menced before Judge Buckles this
morning. Much interest was mani
fested in the proceedings and the court
was crowded to its utmost capacity.
Belew acted nervously at times and hid
nervousness was evidently born of de
spair. Frequently he scrutinized the
faces of those present as if looking for
a sympathizer among them.
The first witness called was Dr. Traf
t'>n in" Dixon, who treated Susie Belew
the day of the poisoning. He testi
fied that the young woman died from
the eff( ta I arsenical poisoning.
Dr. G. W. Downing testified he had
conducted an autopsy on the body of
Susie Belew. W. T. Wenzel, the chem
ist, testified as to finding arsenic
in the beef stew of which she had par
taken, and in the contents of a kettle
submitted for a test.
Alter evidence from Mrs. C. Clark,
who attended Susie Belew on the day
she was taken sick, Horace G. Perry,
stenographer, was called and gave tes
timony regarding the confession made
by Belew on Sunday, February 6, in
the District Attorney's office. In the
afternoon the confession was offered
in evidence and was read. In this con
fession Belew said:
"Of course 1 am guilty. I want to
make a statement. 1 want to have it
over with. I do not know what my
motive was in wanting to kill my
sister, Susie, and my brother, Louis.
I had not made up my mind to do it
until the day the deed was accom
plished. I used rough on rats that was
in the house for a long time. I took
the poison out of the box and threw
the box away. The poison I put in a
piece of paper. There was about a
level teaspoonful of it. I poured the
drug into the teakettle while Susie was
in her room.
'â¢I had some words with Louis that
day about the conduct of my wife and
Susie brought it up again that night. I
was opposod to my sister marrying
Charley Ehmann. The conversation
Bird, my brother-in-law, says he had
with me in the photograph gallery is
not correct as he tells it. I never told
him that I was going to commit one of
the worst crimes that had ever been
done in the county, nor did I say that
I was dissatisfied with the division of
the property.
"] do not know what prompted me to
do the deed."
J. W. Bird was called to the stand.
Bird testified that on the Sunday pre
ceding the day Susie and Louis Belew
were poisoned Frank Belew came to
him and said he was about to commit
one of the most horrible crimes ever
committed In Solano County, and that
it would shock the entire community.
Bird said:
Frank, don't do it."
Be ew asked him if his wife would
live with him if he had any money, and
the witness replied that he did not
think she would.
The defense then called T. M. Dur
rett, who deposed that he had known
Belew for twenty years, and he had
always thought him insane.
D. T>. Dudley, J"hn Maze, Oscar
Schulze and J. W. McElwaine testified
to having known Roiew for many years
and that he had borne a good char
acter. Tho court then adjourned until

SENATORS ARE
NOT IN ACCORD
Debate in Executive Ses
sion Develops Two
Strong Factions.
Not Prepared to Yield to the
President in the Maine
Matter.
If Cuban Resolutions Are Not Strong
Enough They Will Bo
Made Stronger.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 5.â A debate
which occurred in the executive ses
sion of the Senate late this afternoon
would indicate that no matter what the
character of the resolution to come
from the Committee on Foreign Re
lations the resolution would cause a
serious and perhaps prolonged discus
sion. It emphasized the fact that there
are two elements in the Senate â one for
independence with intervention and
another for intervention alone, and
these two factions will fight vigorously
for their ideas.
The relations of the United States
with Spain were the uppermost topic
in the executive session and consti
tuted the subject of many conferences
among Senators.
The activity was due to the an
nouncement that the President's mes
sage would recommend the adoption of
a policy looking to intervention in
Cuba on the part of the executive
; branch of the Government rather than
the recognition of independence, and
to an effort to make smooth the way
for the reception of such a report.
The executive session developed the
fact that much opposition would be
made to the acceptance of a policy in
line with the President's desires. The
, question was raised by Senator Allen,
who made a long speech predicting much
dissatisfaction in the country at large
. with a policy on the part of the execu
tive that did not go to the extent of
giving the Cubans their independence of
the mother country.
Senator Allen was followed by other
speakers in the same line and the fact
was made very evident that if the com
mittee on Foreign Relations should
bring in a resolution merely complying
with the President's request and stop
ping short of a declaration for inde
pendence, there would be an effort in
the Senate to amend it so as to ac
complish this end.
Indeed the announcement was made
by more than one Senator that he
would offer such an amendment, and
; by many more that they would support
j an effort in the direction of adding the
independence declaration to a resolu
tion providing simply for intervention,
i The committee was therefore urged not
â¢ to yield to the wishes of the President,
â  but to stand out strongly for complete
j action. The policy of the President for
executive intervention only was critl
! cised as one which would place the en
! tire question in the hands of the Presi
dent and thus leave the matter where
, it now is, except that it would be a vol
untary rellnquishment of the rights of
] Congress in the premises â the right
1 among others to declare war.

BROWNSVILLE. Tex., April s.â Two
killings and a lynching occurred here
within three-quarters of an hour to-day.
Sam Cobb. a deputy Sheriff, and his
brother, Felipe Cobb, who was a consta
ble, were shot down by Carlos Guellen.
Guellen was wounded by Sam Cobb.
It seems that the latter was riding has
tily from an election booth, having heard
a row was In progress somewhere near,
and that Constable Cobb and a policeman
wero rushing along after him on foot.
At the corner of an alley Guellen sprang
out and fired at Sam Cobb, who returned
the nrÂ»>. Both fell to the ground. Felipe
Cobb then rushed up, and Guellen arose
from the ground and shot him twice,
killing him almost instantly. A young
brother of Guellen appeared at the same
moment and shot Felipe. Both the Guel
lens were arrested, but the younger one
escaped in the excitement.
A mob at once gathered, broke into the
Jail and shot Carlos Gi-.ellen. killing him
In his cell. The body was dragged forth
into the street and the crowd was going
to burn it. but cooler counsel prevailed
and the body was taken back to the Jail.
The trouble grew out of a previous
quarrel between Ouellen and the Cobbs.
Guellen was considered a desperate char
acter. He was convicted of assault to
murder at the last term of court, but ap
pealed. He had been. in numerous shoot

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 5.â A1l was quiet
at Miipitaa to-day, and the work of
commencing the season's pack was
got under way at the cannery. The
Chinese were uneasy at the opening of
work ihis morning, but as none of the
Portuguese put in an appearance this
feeling soon wore off and things went
on as though no riot had occurred yes
terday. The people of Milpitas express
great indignation at the action of the
Oakland Preserving Company in re
placing its help with Chinese. The
Portuguese women thrown out of work
are hard-working people and have the
sympathy of the entire county. They
were paid but 15 cents an hour, and it
is said that the company's contract
with the Chinese means a saving over
this pittance.
Deputy Sheriff Gardner, who was in
charge of the force of officers which
quelled the trouble, said to-day that in
his opinion the cessation of hostilities
was merely temporary, and trouble
may break out at any moment. The
women are bitter in denouncing their
treatment, and may resort to violence.
He thinks a mob will eventually burn
the plant unless the Chinese help is
discarded.
The matter of Chinese replacing
white help was discussed at a meeting
of the Board of Supervisors to-day,
and the following resolution, intro
duced by Supervisor Austin, was
unanimously adopted:
Resolved, that it is the sense of this
board that the employment of Chineso
labor in orchards, canneries and driers of
this county, to the exclusion of white
labor, is at all times to be condemned
and deplored, and that this fact is partic
ularly emphasized at this time, when the
general conditions prevailing in the rnm
mercia! world are such that an unusual
proportion of our people, anxious and
willing to work, are unable to find em
ployment.
It is a well recognized fact that hun
dreds of men, women and children in this
county are largely dependent upon their
small earnings derived from these sources
and to deprive them of this opportunity
would mean to thf-m much hardship and
deprivation in succeeding winter months.
PREFERS WHITE LABOR.
Statement From the Oakland Pre-
serving Company's President.
SAN FRANCISCO, April s.â To the Edi
tor of The Callâ Dear Sir: Referring to
your article in this morning's paper on
the trouble at the Milpitas cannery, I beg
leave to point out that, while the sur
face facts were fully and accurately re
ported, certain circumstances which ma
terially change the "hue of the horse"
have apparently not been brought to your
notice.
Principal among these is the fact that
the employment of Chinese was not a
matter of sordid economy, but of positive
(though we hope of temporary) necessity.
The Oakland Preserving Company has
always been in the vanguard of the pro
moters of pure and high-class food pro
ducts. They have not only persistently
refused to employ Chinese labor, but have
always secured the very best character of
white labor. It was for this very rea
son that their first fruit canneries were
located in Oakland, where the character
of white help to be obtained is considera
bly above the average standard. No Chi
nese have ever been employed there The
Milpitas cannery is operated solely for the
preserving of asparagus. It was located
there because it is the center of an im
portant asparagus-raising district, where
this vegetable attains an unusually high
degree of excellence. This vegetable, to
be of fine quality, must be put up while
crisp and fresh and it is therefore neces
sary that it be taken direct from the fields
to the cannery and that each day's sup
ply be disposed of the very same day
This was the source of the trouble with
the employes of the Milpitas cannery
Although it was necessary for the work
to generally continue beyond regular
hours and sometimes far into the night
in order to finish with the day's supply
the employes insisted on quitting v/hen
they saw fit. They are paid by the hour
and can make good wages, but unless
they are willing to adapt themselves t,,
necessity and work tho required number
of hours during the short season we
should have the choice of either sustain
ing a certain and serious loss or givine
up the business. We am and always
have been willing and anxious to employ
only white labor at higher wages but we
cannot be expected to sacrifice large in
terests because employes refuse to nut
up with an inconvenience which cannot be
obviated. truly,
F. TILLMANN JR

sion that it was not sufficient to
warrant executive clemency, and
resolved to let the law . ' its

SAN QUENTIN PRISON, April 5.â
Up in the wooden cage in the death
chamber Benjamin L. Hill, the Oakland
wife murderer, Is passing the few re
maining hours of his life. Only once
has he alluded to his case in any of his
conversations with the death watch,
Guards Jones and Abrogast, and then
It was to express his sorrow at not hav
ing pleaded guilty in the first place and
gone out of the world long before this
time.
These few words were the only ones
that have passed his lips in regard to
the awful crime of which he is guilty.
Most of his time is spent in reading the
Bible and talking upon religious sub
jects. He says that death has no ter
rors for him; that he believes in a here
after and a God, and he maintains that
he will mount the gallows without a
sign of fear.
Still he has hopes that the Governor
will reprieve him before it is too late.
He sleeps well and eats everything that
is placed before him. The approach of
death has in no manner affected him
in these respects, and he looks the pic
ture of health. He weighs almost 200
pounds and his face is round and pleas
ing in its expression. There is no ap
pearance of the criminal in his features.
Since Hill has been confined in the
San Quentin Penitentiary he has been
a model prisoner. He organized a Bible
class among the murderers condemned
to death. He preached the gospel in
the prison yard and the strange au
dience listened to his words with rapt
attention. Chaplain Dhrams of the
prison "has visited the condemned man
in the cage in the death chamber and
the two have knelt in prayer. None
who knows the prisoner believes he will
show fear on the gallows.
Warden Hale has sent out about
thirty invitations to the execution.
Everything is in readiness. The rope
was tested to-day. At 11:30 to-morrow
the trap will bf sprung unless a stay
of execution arrives at the last min
ute.
Hill had no visitors to-day. His sis
ter-in-law was here a few days ago and
bade him good- by.
Amos Lunt, the hangman, took a final
survey of the gallows to-night and pro
nounced everything in readiness.

RIDGEWAY, 111., April 6.â The gap
in the levee is now over 100 feet wide
and gradually widening. The water
is from ten to fifteen feet deep all over
the town. With the continued cold
rains and the loss of life, suffering and
sorrow are little abated.
The scene in Shawneetown Is worse
than in 1887 or 1884, when there was
much suffering and loss of property,
but no loss of life. Every store in town
is full of water and no provisions can
be had except as they are sent from
surrounding towns.
Relief committees are doing all in
their power to provide for the wants of
the sorrow-stricken people. Clothing
and provisions are being sent in in
every conceivable way â on trains,
boats, skiffs, canoes and dugouts. The
provisions are cooked ready to be
served on arrival, as there is but little,
if any, chance to do any cooking here,
stoves and cooking utensils being prac
tically all under water and fuel a scarce
article. The people will not suffer for
food, or raiment, however. Those in
the doomed city are being well cared
for.
It is thought by conservative people
that the loss of life will reach 100. That
number is missing and unaccounted fov,
while it is known that forty-five or
fifty have perished. The property loss,
to say nothing of the damage to the
le.vee and crops, will reach over $500,
000. Property in two blocks on both
sides of Mill street is utterly ruined,
and the damage to goods is enormous.
It was an hour and a half after the
dyke first broke when the town was
completeh* submerged. The family of
Charles Clayton was drowned, with
the exception of Neil Clayton, a grand
son of 8 years. He in some manner
managed to reach the roof of the house
and was taken off by Lloyd Rowan.
The family of Riley Galloway
Sheriff of Gallatin County, was lost,
one nephew being the only member to
escape. There was a report that a
young lady visiting the family of
Sheriff Galloway was lost, but this re
port could not be substantiated. Some
said the young lady was with the
family, but others denied it. The
Sheriff is distracted, and it is feared
he will lose his mind.
Mrs. Relnholt, three of whose chil
dren were drowned, was carried
through the town on a board which
she had managed to seize. When the
rescuers reached her they were unable
to lift her into their skiff, she being a
very large woman, and throwing her
a rope they towed her a half mile to
a place of safety.
David Kookendorfer and his wife,
finding their escape through the door
cut off, rushed to the roof. By the
time they reached it the house was
floating southward. In a few minutes
it parted, Mr. Kookendorfer being on
one half and his wife on the other. For
the second time the roof parted under
Mr. Kookendorfer, and he sailed away
on what was left to him. 111-fortune
pursued him and his portion of the
roof. The roof broke under him just
as a hencoop came along, and he
abandoned the roof and got on the
coop. This proved his salvation, and
he was finally able to reach the levee,
where he climbed up in safety.
Mrs. Kookendorf^r remained upon
her half and reached the levee without
any of the interruptions that met her
husband.
Paul Phalen, whose wife and daugh
ter were both drowned, had a narrow
escape from death. The two ladies
reached the roof, Mr. Phalen being
close behind them. The ro^ * broke as
he was about to emerge, ninning him
in the scuttle hole. Being a slight man
he was unable to extricate himself,
and to this fact he owes his life. His
wife and daughter were washed from
the roof and dnnvned. Mr. Phalen was
carried about a quarter of a mile be
fore he was picked up. He is now in a
critical condition and it is feared he
will not recover.
The break in the dam widened to
day a gap of 150 yards. It is said
by those who witnessed its first giving
away that the disastf - was caused by
quicksand upon which its foundations
rested. The first sign c-f the disaster
was a sudden whirlpool about fifteen
feet north of the dam. as though the
bottom had fallen out of the river. The

THE LAW AND Th|E RETAILERS.
IT appears that the decision rendered by Superior
Judges Wallace, Dunne and Cook on Friday last
in which it was declared that principals are not
responsible for the criminal acts of their agents in
selling and delivering adulterated food products is
about to bring the entire pure food crusade to an un
timely conclusion. The officials of the Health De
partment are very much discouraged over the out
look and it is reported that they are seriously con
templating the dismissal of a number of food in
spectors and other employes whose services will not
be required unless the prosecutions for selling adul
terated food can be continued.
Health Officer O'Brien regards the law as laid
down by these Judges as extremely bad, and he adds
that he would not be surprised if the milkmen were
to now take advantage of the situation and resist pros- j
ecutions on the ground that their drivers sell and de- j
liver the watered milk and not themselves. Yet we
do not see how the court could have taken a different
view of the law. Certainly the contention that a
principal is responsible for the voluntary criminal
acts of his agent is entirely new and novel.
As we understand it, the main purpose of attempt
ing to enforce the law against the retailers of adul
terated food products was to make it so disagree
able for them that they would abandon the business.
Now that the court has decided that they are not
responsible for selling food merchandise which they
cannot in the nature of things know to be impure, of '
course this method of warfare must be abandoned.
It will no longer serve the purpose of frightening re
tailers, nor will the Health Department officials be '
justified in arresting any more dealers under the j
statute.
Eut it is still possible to make it sultry for the '
manufacturers of adulterated food products. All the
energy of the Health Department should be directed
toward discovering those who place such products >
upon the market. If sanded sugar, wooden hams
and pine nutmegs are shipped here from th- Ea*t
it ought to be possible to inspect them upon their ar
rival and prevent their distribution among the re
tailers. We do not think, upon the whole, that the
health officials should sit down and give up the fight.
They are engaged in a business which is of prime im
portance to the community, and if they cannot reach '
the dealers in impure food they can, to some extent, i
disturb the nefarious trade of the manufacturers.
It must be said in favor of the wife-murderer, Hill,
who is scheduled to be hanged to-day, that he has
6ince his condemnation deported himself in a decent
Â»nd courageous fashion, has not viewed his crime as
â¢n evidence of heroism, has not posed nor pleaded
the baby act. While it would be neither possible nor
seemly to entertain a high regard for him, it can be
truly said that he is no Durrant. Yet for all Hill
has proved himself to be considerable of a man,
clemency in his case would have had a bad effect. If
sympathy were allowed to set aside the law there
might as well be no law.
There is considerable unnecessary fu*s being made
over young Pullman because he happened to marry
the woman he chose to marry. As a matter of fact
other men, some of them fully as important as this
young chap, have done the same thing. Whether or
not the choice be wise concerns them, and comes so
rear being nobody else's business that the subject is
tlmost too delicate for discussion.
Minister Bernabe may be obliged to quit the coun
try before long, but he will leave behind the impres
sion that he has conducted himself as a gentleman,
in which particular his case will afford a violent con
trast to that of the late De Lome.
Several new plans have been presented for securing
peace in Cuba. They leave out of consideration the
fact that the United States owns the skeleton of a
battle-ship in Havana harbor, and therefore they will
not be considered.
Gentlemen who have been engaged in outlining the
President's message would have been wise to have
got together. Somehow the outlines seem to be
those of abont as many different messages as there
are gentfemen in the business.
According to a certain Spaniard, "America is mad
with pride." Possibly so. But even in the present
heat of debate it must be remembered that America
has something to be proud of, wherein it has a dis
tinct advantage of Spain.
The rumor that Schofield is to be put in command
over Miles could probably be traced to a lunatic
asylum if it were worth while to take the trouble of
tracing it anywhere.
The substance of the Cleveland letter to Hearst
seems to have been about this: "What do you take
me for?" It was complete, final and emphatic.
Americans may be hastening out of Cuba just now,
but there is a probability that some of the same na
tion will soon be hastening back again, and not by
askmjr anybody's permission.
THE CHINESE TRADE.
C\ MERICAN energy- and enterprise have long
/ \ been comparatively indifferent to China. We
have sought to expand our trade with Europe.
with South America and with Australia, but we
have made only few and half-contemptuous efforts to
build up a trade with Asia. When we have thought
of the Mongolian at all we have thought of him only
as a coolie, whose custom was worth nothing and
whose presence was a nuisance. It has hardly oc
curred to us that in China there is a vast market for
every form of American goods and that it is the
greatest field for commercial expansion the earth
affords.
Long ago Seward declared that in the course of
time the United States would have a larger trade with
Asia than with Europe. The prophecy was mocked
at. It was considered to be on a par with Seward's
other prediction that Alaska would some day be a
valuable portion of our territory. The day of the
mocking is now over. Alaska is recognized as an im
portant country, and there is a growing recognition
of the fact that the Chinese trade is also something
which has golden possibilities in it for men of energy
and enterprise.
Great Britain. Germany and Russia are not making
demonstrations along the Chinese coast merely for
the purpose of territorial expansion. Neither of the
three would care very much for an addition of a few
millions of Chinese to the number of their people
or a few thousand square miles of land to the extent
of their dominions. Their interest in the Chinese
ports is the trade they expect to carry on there, and
certainly it must be a very large trade indeed that
leads three great powers to the very verge of war to
obtain it.
Our natural interests in China are greater than
those of either of the three powers that are talking of
dividing the empire. It is from the United States
that the Chinese, now rapidly advancing in civiliza
tion, should obtain the produce of civilized men.
Our natural advantages, however, will avail us but
little unless our Government puts us in a position to
make use of them.
Against the subsidized ships of Europe our unpro
tected mercantile marine cannot compete, nor can in
dividual effort make head against the efforts of
mighty Governments like those now struggling for
the Chinese market. It is time that attention was
given to this subject at Washington. Projection and
promotion to American shipping have lung been
promised, and should be given now before the Chi
nese market is wholly captured by European aggres
sion.
EASTERN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.
THE results of the municipal elections in Ohio
and Michigan show that the comparative
strength of the two great parties has about re
turned to its normal equilibrium in local affairs.
Democracy has in the cities of those States recov
ered to some extent from the crushing defeat of
Bryanism and has been able to hold its own. The
successes of one party in certain cities were about off
set by those of the opposing organizations in others.
and the only notable triumph of the whole was the
Republican victory in Cleveland, which showed a
gain of iooo votes, an increase which is far from com
mon in strictly municipal contests.
The results of the elections of course afford no
basis for estimating the comparative strength of the
parties on national issues. Municipal elections in
these days are party contests in hardly more than
name only. The old ties which bound voters in
strict discipline to vote their party ticket for Justice
of the Peace or Common Councilman with as much
regularity as for Congressman or President have
been broken or loosened in every direction. All
that can be learned, therefore, from the results in the
two States is that Republicans cannot count on
maintaining in their local elections the splendid ma
jorities of the tidal wave year of 1896.
That lesson is worth the learning. Democracy,
though divided, discomfited and demoralized on na
tional issues and having neither a platform nor a
leader to harmonize its factions, is still a strong and
vigorous opposition party in local affairs. It must be
reckoned with in every county or municipal contest,
and, as the result has ghown in a considerable num
ber of cities in Ohio and Michigan, the reckoning is
apt to be disastrous to Republicans who are either
indifferent to local issues or are so over confident as
to venture upon "yellow dog" tickets.
Slight as were the elections of Monday, therefore,
they are not without their value to the Republicans
of California. The Call has repeatedly urged the
party leaders to begin at once the work of organizing
the rank and file into clubs or otherwise so as to
have the party ready for decisive action as soon as
the campaign opens. There is no reason for believ
ing that popular sentiment in California is widely
different from that which has just been disclosed in
Ohio and Michigan, and that being so it is evident
that if the Republicans of this State desire to hold
the strength gained in 1896 and carry it further so as
to retire the silver men and free traders from Con
gress, they must make ready for a vigorous campaign
and organize without delay.
There is little reason to fear that Hoff. the most
recently convicted murderer, will appeal to the Su
preme Court. In the first place he must be impressed
by the fact that he is guilty and that everybody
know 9 it, and in the second place an appeal costs
money, and lawyers as a rule do not perform labor
for love.
Of Rev. C. A. Briggs, who has attained much
notoriety by being charged variously with heresy,
and who has just vaulted from one church into an
other, it is said that he is a man who does not for
get his enemies. We therefore draw the inference
that he has a long list of people whom it will now be
his duty and pleasure to love.
While the populace of Havana shows a tendency
to shout. "Death to Americans!" there seems to be
an ignoring of the fact that Spain has no monopoly
of the death-dealing business.
Really the Kaiser has no reason to be angry be
cause somebody has dubbed him "Alarm Fritz." Let
him possess his soul in patience until he shall have
been called a "falsff alarm."
It took Congress some time to grasp the notion
that the blowing up of the Maine was not an act of
neighborly kindness, but it seems to have a firm grip
of the idea now.
So it seems that the torpedo fleet is not where Spain
said it was. Evidently as a source of information a
Spanish official is no more reliable than a yellow cor
respondent.
Hayti and San Domingo have agreed to remain
neutral. 'Tis well. Now let us have a definite state
ment as to the attitude of Goat Island.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 6, 1898.
THE CATTLE QUARANTINE.
GOVERNOR SADLER of Nevada has taken
an utterly indefensible position on the cattle
quarantine. He has announced that he will per
mit no cattle from California to be taken into Nevada
and has reiterated the declaration even after being
assured that it is not desired on the part of Califor
nians to send to that State any cattle likely to infect
the herds of Nevada.
These assurances have been sent to Governor Sad
ler by both Governor Budd and Secretary Wilson.
The Governor has informed him that "the cattle
whose owners are now seeking to have them ad
mitted to the northern part of this State and into
Nevada and the adjoining territories are in no wise
inflicted with disease nor in any wise liable to con
taminate or infect other ' herds with which they
mingle." For his further information it was added
that "the present quarantine in California was or
dered upon information that the disease existed in
some parts of the State. Pending investigation as
to exact localities the line was placed very far north
of the suspected districts to be sure to include them
all."
The Secretary of Agriculture was equally explicit
in his assurances of a careful watch over the interests
of Nevada. He informed Governor Sadler that "this
department will issue no permits allowing infected
cattle to enter your State. Inspectors report the dis
tricts free from infection south of the recent Cali
fornia quarantine line. Permits may be granted from
such uninfected districts by inspectors, but only after
other inspections to guard against infection." In
conclusion he added, "Assure your cattlemen that
they will be fully protected."
After these assurances the attitude of persistent re
fusal taken by Governor Sadler is mor. like obstin
acy than firmness. It is his duty, of course, to guard
the interests of his constituents, but after he has had
ample guarantees from official sources that these in
terests will not be endangered in any way by the
proposed shipment of cattle from this State, his op
position becomes not so much a protection to Ne
vada as an antagonism to California.
The issue is one that cannot be lightly passed by.
Over wide areas of the State the cattle industry has
been seriously injured by the drought, and unless
pastures in other sections or other States can be
found many thousands of valuable cattle are likely to
die of starvation or thirst. Under these circum
stances the cattle quarantine becomes a matter of
the greatest importance, and a grave injustice will
be done to cattlemen whose herds are not infected if
they are made to suffer because of a mere unfounded
suspicion against them.
It will be noted that Governor Budd states that the
quarantine line was drawn far north of the districts
where diseased cattle were suspected to exist and was
designed solely for safety pending an investigation,
while Secretary Wilson states that inspectors report
the districts free from infection south of the quaran
tine line. On this official showing it would seem to
be time to have the quarantine line changed. It is
an offensive law that gives nearly all California cattle
a bad name because a few are diseased.
& NEEDLESS PROTEST.
EY reason, we suppose, of the repeated bids of
v the British for an alliance with the United
States, and the favorable comment with which
these friendly expressions have been received by a
portion of the American press, some naturalized
citizens of this country have thought it worth while
to hold a mass-meeting in Chicago to protest against
an alliance between the United States and any foreign
power whatever.
The protest was needless. Our Government has
no intention of even considering such an alliance,
and our people, whether naturalized or native bonu
have no sentiment in favor of one. It has been the
traditional policy of the United States to follow the
counsel of Washington and to avoid entangling al
liances, and if there had been ever a temptation to
do otherwise it would now be set aside by reason of
the danger which such an entanglement would in
volve. With all Europe taxed to the verge of ruin
to maintain armies and navies made necessary by the
incessant menace of war, an alliance with any Euro
pean power is about the last thing an American ad
ministration '.vould think of undertaking.
Moreover, it is doubtful if there are half a dozen
intelligent men in Great Britain who seriously sup
pose that such a bond of union with this country
could be accomplished at this time. Alliances, to be
effective, must be based upon mutual interest of
some kind, and at present no such common interest
exists between our people and the British. We have,
indeed, a strong desire on both sides for the con
tinuance of trade and the peaceful development of
industry, but that desire, being general among all
nations, cannot be made the basis of a special al
liance between two.
At present the mission of the American people is
the upbuilding of our own country and the protection
of this hemisphere from foreign aggression. The
mission of the British people is quite different.
Theirs is a world-wide struggle and is carried on in
every quarter of the globe. We have no concern
in her quarrels nor her empire. If the supremacy of
the seas is ever wrested from her we may claim it
and set up as her successor in empire. When that
time comes we shall have foreign foes and may need
foreign friends, but at present we are neutrals. Mass
meetings to protest against foreign alliances may be
amusing, but they are not needed even for that pur
pose, and when the people of Chicago, whether natur
alized or native born, wish something to shout over
and spout over they had better hunt a liver subject.
The man who goes around pretending to inspect
gas meters and really robbing the householders
whose premises he invades proves not to have any
connection with the companies. It is therefore plain
that he has no right to steal.
The gentleman who intends to start in a balloon for
the Klondike cannot be viewed as having accom
plished much until he shall arrive there. Anybody
with the price of a balloon can start.
General Forsythe declares that war with Spain,
If it should come, might last from fifteen months to
two years. A distinguished Senator has estimated
that it might last fifteen minutes. The former esti
mate was based on military experience and knowl
edge of the situation; the latter presumably upon a
knc-wledgre of what constitutes rhetorical effect. â

ROSE FROM THE RANKS.
A CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE.
SHE SUPERINTENDS A LINE OF RAILWAY.
/v^ IBS ANNA MITCHENER. of New
111 Philadelphia, 0.. is the only fe
111 male superintendent of a railroad
I lin the world. She manages for
' " her father. Major C. E. Mltch-
ener, owner of the line, the Tus
earowas Electric Road, running between
Canal Dover and Unionville, thirteen
miles.
During a recent bad storm of wind and
snow the road was blockaded, and It was
thought that all traffic would be brought
to a standstill for a few days at least.
But those who speculated in this wise
were not counting on the energetic young
woman, who was closely watching the af
fairs of her father's railroad.
Miss Mitchener bundled herself up In an
outfit that was a good imitation of a
Klondike miner's, and sallied forth to the
fray. She first employed all the idle men
and teams in the city and the country
surroundtng, and then personally directed
their attention to the mountains of snow,
which completely buried the line from
view. She remained on duty from dawn
until dusk, and she presented an inspir
ing sight to the army of workers under
her direction, as she made her way from
point to point over the drifts superintend
ing the removal of the snow piles.
Before nightfall some of the cars were
out on the line and running between the
two towns, although necessarily the reg
ular schedule was not adhered to. and
Miss Mitchener was being complimented
on all sides for the energy she displayed

Some time ago he closed up his busi
ness, since which time he has amused
himself by reading and writing little
in the undertaking. Since taking charge
of the road the young woman has won
the good will of all of her employes, which
in itself speaks volumes.
"From, the very beginning I haA'e been
with the road," she said recently. "In
September of 1891, when the road was
formally opened, I took my place in the
office, doing almost ail the clerical work,
and assisted generally as best I could.
At that time I had no intention of tak
ing up the work seriouslyâ it was a mere
diversion. But as the days went by I
became more and more interested, until
last November, when my father told me
that he had been called West to be gone
a number of months, and wanted me to
take charge of the road during his ab
sence. I have not regretted my accept
ance in the least, for I find it very pleas
ant occupation, and if I cared for a life
work would certainly make it such. I
have had no trouble at all with my work.
I have always been treated with the ut
most respect and deference by the men
in my employ, and others with whom I
have come in contact, finding them al
ways ready to accede to my wishes in
every regard. Of course, at times com
plications have arisen which have called
for quick thought and quicker action, but
at such times I have always been suc
cessful in finding the right way out. My
duties are such that I am in the open
air a large part of the time, and, in con
sequence, I have gained materially in

DOESN*T LIKE THE CHARTER.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Sir: Al
though a great national crisis la and
probably will engage our attention for
some time, we should nevertheless devote
a small share of our thoughts to a matter
very close to our doors, especially now
when It appears in print before our gaze i
every morning. I refer to wltat is sup
posed to be a new charter for the city
and county of San Francisco, but which,
if properly designated, might as well be
named a lot of stuff got together at the
taxpayers" expense fur the perpetuation â 
of the Mayoralty. Under that instrument i
(which by the way will not see the light
of another day after election) the first j
(lucky) born (according to street vernacu- 1
lar) would not do a thing but perpetuate I
himself and all of his coterie in position
or office for life, and then leave It to his
next of kin as an heirloom. I am sur
prisedâno, we may as well expect almost
anything in future, when jhe men we
voted for (thereby losing at least one
hour's valuable time of every voter) to
create a new charter, and this is the re
sult. Talk about Buckleyism, Crimmlna
and Kelly. Burns and all of our other gal
lant politicians; why, they had better go
to school and learn to do politics accord- >
ing to the inventors of this new charter, I
or rather learn from its creators. Talk '
about raw work; I have never seen its
equal; but does it not appear as though j
this was created as a sort of nightmare
joke? Surely It was never seriously in
tended to be elected or voted chosen by '
any one with the exception perhaps of i
the creators thereof.

a here ti;e big ship went ashore. Not :

lOML The New York on Saturday
"i>n, March 12, was off the Pigeon
Point light, eighteen miles south from
where she now lies. Although the wind
was blowing strong the ship made only
eighteen miles headway in twenty-four
hours and the next eight hours put her j
In the breakers, although according to j
the statement of the master he supposed
lie was close to the Karallones.
Captain Peabody*s story of many of the
incidents of the disaster is materially dif- ;
ferent from the statements of many of
the folks wl â¢ were In the vicinity of the
bay. He Bays that the weather was '
heavy and thick, while dozens of wit
irt that the day and night were
as clear as could be asked for. He states
that at no time when on the inshore tach., I

did he see any lights on the shore or on
the water, but the facts are that nearly ai
hundred lights â â â : various kinds glimmered \
over the within a radious of â¢
three miles, !â > say nothing of the Pigeon
Point ilght that was visible to those on
the steamer Gipsy which lay at anchor
Close under Pil!ar Point.
More than one person has stated that
he believed that the wrecking of the '
New York was intentional and not the i
result of a combination of adverse cir- j
cumstancea over which the master of the !
Bhip had no control. This belief was i
upon the peculiar manner in which
the vessel was handled, almost run upon
v rocky r.x-f in the afternoon and again
back over the same dangerous |
â¢ r destruction after the shades j
of night had fallen. The insurance men j
declare that while they cannot see how

for â  - destruction.

"We had passed Pigeon Point and were
making for the company's wharf. It
was a clear day and we could see nearly
twenty miles. When I sighted the New
lork she was standing in toward the
beach, and I said to the mate, 'What's
that fellow doing in there? He'll run
that ship ashore if he don't look out.' Th.3
Gipsy was about half a mile off shore and
the Xew York was on the port tack abuut
a mile and a half from the beach. Just
then he hauled his main topsail back,
but the ship hung fire. I watched him a
few seconds, and then remarked to the
mate, 'My God, he's on the reef.' She
Wing there for about ten minutes, and
tXen her topsails filled and the crew wore
snip and stood off shore.
"In the morning the mate knocked on
my door and said 'Captain, that ship's
ashore.' There she was, sure enough,
piled up almost on the exact point for
which she had been heading the day be
fore.
"I have just this much to say about
that wreck: The man who ran her there
must have been crazy, lie must have
seen Pigeon Point light if he was keep
ing any lookout. When the New York
was tacked and stood off shore the cap
tain must have known where he was. If
he had used his eyes at all he could not
but have seen the Pacific Coast Steam
ship Company's wharf, the buoys mark
ing the opening in the reef and the one
marking the end of the reef below which
his vessel went ashore. All these signs
should have told h!m where he was, and
therefore I say the man who ran the
New York ashore must have been crazy.
To G. S. Dent, the second mate of the
steamer Gipsy, the movement of the
New York on the Oay that she met her
fate were decide-i.y a mystery. Accord
ing to his statements the ship was nrst
sighted about 2:30 o'clock in the after
noon as the Gipsy was steaming into the
cove of Halfmoon Bay. In speaking of
the singular movements of the ship and
his own impressions he said: "I was on
the bridge and saw the ship coming
straight in, as I thought, on her first in
shore tack. I called Captain Leland and
asked him what he thought of the way
the snip was being handled, v c could
not make out why she should be so close
to the land. At the time we decided that
her captain was somewhat off his course
and wanted to know where he was or
wanted to get a pilot. About that time
we saw that he people on board were
hauling back the main yard and the ship
checked in her course. When she rounded
to she was not more than a quarter of
a mile south of the south reef, the buoy
being to the north of her. This reef ex
tends half a mile. The wind was blowing
pretty fresh from the northwest, just

such a breeze as a captain of a vessel like
bis would like.
"I was on deck most of the afternoon,
and about 6:30 o'clock I noticed that the
New York had again tacked and was
standing Inshore. Captain Leland and
tSrst mute, Mr. Peterson, watched her
a lime, and we commented that if
was lucky she would be able to pass
point on that tack."
t hat was the condition of the wind?"
asked of Mr. Dent, to which he an
cl: "It was blowing pretty stiff from
northwest all of the afternoon, but
so hard as to make the handling Of a
ship at all difficult."
"And the condition of the atmosphere,
was it foggy or misty, so that the "captain
could not see where he was going?"
"Pshaw, nothing of the kind. The
weather was as clear as a day could
be," was the mate's reply. "The night
was as cle:u" as the day. At 7 o'clock
in the evening 1 plainly saw the Pigeon
Point light, which is eighteen miles down
the coast. If we could see that light so
far down the coast I do not understand
Rthe captain of the ship could not see
two lights where we lay at anchor,
had our riding Fights up fore and aft.
des there was a big light on the end
le wharf and back on the shore could
seen dozens of lights in the town,
Spanishtown. Still the captain of tha
New York kept right on, lights and all,
until he piled his ship up on the beach,
where she now lies. I cannot see for the
life of me how it was that he could have
made such a mistake. It would have
been inexcusable for him to have made
such a mistake in the night time, with
all the lights in full sight, but to do as
he did after nearly going on the reef in
the afternoon is more than I can com
prehend. When he found, In the after
noon, that he was in a locality in which
he had no business It was his duty to
have got out of there as fast as his
sails would carry him. But he did not,
and his ship is now on the beach."
Captain Peabody of the New York la
still at Spanishtown. He acknowledges
that the loss of the ship Is as much ofl
a mystery to him as to any one else.
Yesterday he said that on the day pre
ceding the wreck he was beating on and

and could not make any headway against
the wind. It took him about twenty-four
STRANGE FREAK OF A SCOTCH COLLIE.
Oscar Heath, secretary of the Dickman & Jones Company of this
city, is the owner of a Scotch collie that has exr bited a strangely
maternal instinct or affection, which manifested itself in such a pe
culiar manner as to furnish the deepest ground of research *to the stu
dent of freaks of nature. It is nothing more nor less than the fostering
of a brood of young chickens, over which she watches with the great
est care and affection.
Flora, as the collie is named, first manifested these remarkable
proclivities by frantic efforts to enter an inclosure containing a brood
of newly hatched chickens, and the owner, being curious to learn what
the dog would do, admitted her. Immediately upon entering the place
she, by every sign of which a dog is capable, showed her desire to
foster and care for the brood, protecting them from any apparent
danger and sheltering the little chicks from the cold by the warmth
of her body as tie lies prostrate upon the ground.

and the reason he gave for going in so
close to the land was that the weather
was hazy and he could not make out the
shore well.
When he found that he was in a dan
gerous neighborhood he "wore" ship and
headed for the deeper and safer west. "I
stood off until 4:30 p. m.," said he, "and
judged from the patent log that I was
about twenty-two miles out. Then I
tacked and headed for the Point Bonlta
light, as I supposed. All of the time the
wind was blowing very hard and the
weather was thick and we could not see
very far. I went aloft to try and find the
light I was expecting to see, and off to
the land side I saw a white line of break
ers. I shouted to throw the helm over,
but the ship would not answer, and we
went broadside into the breakers. There

thing to lose by wrecking the ship. As it

Now York, and the owners, L. Lucken
bach & Bros, of New York City, are the
most responsible people in this line of
business. Some of these ugly stories have
been circulated by the sailors. No sooner
had they got safe on shore than they got
beastly drunk. Every one from the town
brought a bottle of liquor and nearly
every sailor got all .that his hide would
hold. Even the second mate. Wilson, was
dead drunk on the sand within eight feet
of the water's edge when I got ashore in
the morning after the ship went on."

SILVEB STATE WAB.
An Angry Lessee Hammers a Piano
as a Means of Revenge.
Landlord Silverberg of the Silver State
Hotel on Mason street no sooner gets out
of one wrangle with tenants than he is
in the midst of another. Ever since
Messrs. Montgomery and Wiseman left
the house there has been a merry war
between Silverberg and Lessee J. B.
Leland of the bar.
"I am out $15<h) in this business," said
Leland last night, "and I do not propose
to surrender without a flght. I'll go be
fore the Grand Jury and have the whole
crowd indicted the first thing they know.
I was induced to come in by false repre
sentations."
The famous lodging-house recently sur-
rendered by Montgomery and Wiseman is
now conducted by Mrs. Gale, formerly of
17 Stockton street. Leland thinks she
and Silverberg wish to conduct the bar
themselves. Leland has formulated a
plan of retaliation, which he began to
carry out yesterday, and which may
reach the courts to-day.
He sent for a piano yesterday after
noon, put it in the barroom and hired a
singer, greatly to the annoyance of guests
of the house, who threatened to leave If
the noise, did not cease.
"Stop that noise in the barroom, for
yon are driving my guests away," said
Mrs. Gale.
"Get out of here! I'm running the sa
loon!" retorted Leland.
Then Silverbprp came on the scene and
tried to persuade Leland to give up the
saloon.
"Pay me the thousand I am out and
I'll leave," said Leland, whereupon Sil
verberg left, declaring that his house
would be ruined by dissensions among
its Inmates'.
Charged With Burglary.
William Franklin, a waiter, and another
man entered a room in Mrs. Mary O'Con
nor's lodging house, 933 Mission street,
yesterday afternoon. They were discov
ered and fled. Policemen Cooney and
McGrayan chased them and succeeded in
capturing Franklin. He was booked at
the City Prison on a charge of burglary.
Richard Curtis and Fred Harvey were
also booked yesterday for burglary by
Detectives Reynolds nnd Dinan. Th>y
broke into the room of William Crowky.
515 Kearny street and stole a lot of
clothing, which the detectives have re
covered.
Caused by the Earthquake.
Inspector O'Brien of the School Depart
ment has filed with the Board of Edu
cation his report on the damage sus
tained by the Girls' High School build
ing from the recent earthquake. He re
ports that the principal damage Is to the
north wall under the roof, which has been
moved from its original position nearly
two Inches. He estimates the cost of re
i pairing the damage at $2000.
EASTERN METHODS
IN A JOCKEY CLUB
Sleight of Hand Jugglers Pursue Illegal
Plans to Double Values,
The Dark Ways by Which the Pacific Coast
Club's Stock Was Pawned and
Depreciated.
It has come to light that the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club, following the dark
and mysterious Eastern methods intro
duced by Ed Corrigan, has lately
doubled its stock in an illegal manner.
At a meeting during the early part of .
laet month the directors declared a div- j
idend of 100 per cent. This seemed so j
unusual that several stockholders de- |
clined to accept their share of the al- j
leged dividends until they investigated
the meaning of the unusual proceeding, j
When they probed into the matter
they soon discovered that the method
pursued to double the stock was a void
and useless proceedings. The suspicous
stockholders, therefore, declined to ac
cept the dividends, which were pay
able in other shares of stock.
A little figuring soon showed that the
reason of the queer and illegal â  pro
ceedings was that some of the stock
holders were in debt to an embarrass
ing extent. To recoup their heavy
losses they pledged their stock at va
rious banks, after which they met and
doubled the issue of stock, thereby de
preciating the pledge as well as pre
viously issued shares to the amount of
exactly on^-half.
But the new stock looked so good on
its face that a number of bankers ad
vanced money on it. They did not
know "the ways that are dark and the
tricks that are vain," by which the
sleight-of-hand manipulators from the
far East had rendered that stock equal
to only half of its apparent value.
They will know when they read this,
and there is likely to be a merry war
between pledgors and pledgees when
they come face to face. It will be
difficult to convinr^ the bankers that
men can lift themselves by their own
boot straps and that property repre
sented by ten thousand shares is more
valuable than the same property repre
sented by five thousand.
Those who refused to accept the ad
ditional shares, which the manipulators
called dividends, were acting on the ad
vice of lawyers, who, after investigat
ing the methods by which the stock
was increased, pronounced the proceed
ings void and wholly worthless.
It will be understood at a glance that
the reason for the proceedings of the
principal stockholders was that they
had met with severe reverses, which
drove them to hypothecate their shares
at such banks as would advance them
money. Having -made the raise suc
cessfully they rrere ingenious enough to
proceed to the extreme of issuing one
hundred per cent more. They did not
operate under the laws of California,
and there is a suspicion that they pro
ceeded under the flexible laws of Illi
nois, where Mr. CorHeran has had a
long and varied experience.
The original issue consisted of 5000
shares, valued at $100 per share, of
which 2451 shares were at once paid for
and issued, the balance being held in
reserve. Doubling the stock by the
methods attempted by the stockholders
has left a batch of depreciated stock on
hand and has furnished a brilliant ex
ample of the stone wall against which
the directors have run their heads.
The law on the subject of issuing
and increasing stock is very plain. It
Is provided by section 11, article XII, of
the State constitution, as follows:
No corporation shall issue stock or
bonds, except for money paid, labor
done or property actually received,
and all fictitious increase of stock or
indebtedness shall be void.
Practically the same thing is reiter
ated at the beginning of section 359 of
the Civil Code, which defines the pow
ers of corporations.
That part of the Ci-il Code relating
to powers of directore of corporations
lat section 309 provides among other
things:
"The directors of corporations must
not make dividends except from the
surplus profits arising from the busi
ness thereof." (Meaning the business
of the corporation.) "Nor must they
divide, withdraw or pay to the stock
holders or any of them any part of the
capital stock, nor must they create
debts beyond their subscribed cap
ital stock, nor must they divide,
withdraw or pay to the stockholders
any part of the capital stock except as
hereinafter provided, nor reduce or In
crease the capital stock except as here
in provided."
The provision covered by the "here
inafter provided" has reference to cor
porations holding and selling real es
tate, water and water rights, when a
two-thirds vote of the stock is neces
sary. And also that after the payment
of all the debts of a corporation upon
its dissolution, the capital stock may
be divided among the stockholders.
The only decision that appears to be
directly upon thOÃe propositions is the
case of Kellerman vs. Maier, 116 Cal.,
416, decided April 6, 1897. In that case
stock was issued in a corporation
called the Castica Oil Company to cer
tain stockholders upon the payment by
them of 50 cents a share. Subsequently
the price of the stock to persons in
tending to purchase was reduced to 23

cents a share, and additional shares
were to be issued to those who had
purchased at 50 a share, in order
to equalize the prices so that the stock
already purchased should cost no more
than that to be purchased at the re
duced price. The court says:
"Section 359 of the Civil Code pro
vides that 'no corporation shall issue
stock or bonds except for money paid
labor done or property actually re
ceived.' The certificates for the two
thousand shares referred to appear to
have been issued in violation of this
provision; and if they were so issued
they were void, and the parties receiv
ing them did not thereby beoome share
holders nor make themselves liable tb
creditors as for an unpaid subscrip
tion."
President Androus and J. H. Crocker
of the club were seen last night rela
tive to the issue of stock as dividends.
They said they had been Informed that
the proceedings were entirely proper.
"Why was the stock increased In
this way?" was asked of President An
drous.
"I cannot tell you <ust why," was the
reply, "as that .was a matter in the
discretion of the board of directors; but
I am informed that everything was
done after thorough legal advice."
Mr. Crocker professed equal ignor
ance of the motive that led to the un
usual action. I*<Â» said: "I personally
do not know just why the directors
took the action, but I am informed that
the attorneys for the club passed on
the* matter in due form before the step
was taken. If it is illegal it can, no
doubt be set aside, as it has probably
done no particular harm."

The Chamber of Commerce Bequests
The California Delegates to
Sustain McKinley.
At a special meeting of the Chamber of
Commerce held yesterday afternoon the
following dispatch was ordered to be for
warded to the California delegates now
in 'Washington:
Whereas, The Chamber of Commerce of . San
Francisco realizing the intense feeling at pres
ent-prevailing In our country owing to the
strained relations existing between the United
States and the kingdom of Spain, believe that
under such circumstances too much stress can
not be placed upon the necessity or our citizens
looking upon the question involved in a calm
and deliberate manner, and. Whereas, We are
of the opinion that the policy pursued in this
present J crisis by the President â¢ and adminis
tration in Washington has been in, thorough
accord with our dignity as a nation and the
best ; interests of our country; and .. that the
President has shown that he fully realizes the
gravity of the situation and his dignified, calm
and considerate . course under . these trying con
ditions deserve the cordial support- of - all of
our citizens independent of political parties.
Be it therefore
Resolved, That we respectfully extend to the
President the assurance of our earnest sup
port and urgently request the California dele
gation in Washington to use their best en
deavors to sustain and uphold the President
in the furtherance of the policy which he has
adopted. Â: :;mÃgm i â *" â 'â  â â¢
Following this was another addressed
to Senator Perkins urging him to use
his influence in having the quarantine
laws of the United States exclusively en
forced at this port. This means that the
State laws be done away with so far as
they apply to the quarantining of foreign
vessels entering the harbor.
The memory of Charles Hanson, a late
member of the Board of Directors of the
Chamber, who died last month, was re
membered by a suitable set of resolu
tions eulogizing his usefulness as an
active member of the association.

A POPULAR MISTAKE
Regarding Remedies for Dyspepsia and
Indigestion. , -
The national disease of Americans is
indigestion or in its chronic form, dy-
spepsia, and for the very reason that
it is so common many people neglect
taking proper treatment for what they
consider trifling stomach trouble, when,
as a matter of fact, â¢ indigestion lays
the foundation for many incurable dis-
eases. -. No person with a vigorous,
healthy stomach will fall a victim to
consumption. Many kidney '.diseases
and heart troubles date their begin-
ning from poor digestion; thin, nerv-
ous people are really so because their
stomachs are out of .; gear; weary, lan-
guid, faded , out women owe | their con-
dition : to imperfect digestion. j.
When nearly every person you meet
is afflicted with weak digestion it is not
surprising that nearly every secret pat-
ent medicine on the market claims to
be a cure for dyspepsia, |as well as a
score of other troubles, when, in fact,
as Dr. Werthier says, there is but one
genuine dyspepsia cure which is per-
fectly safe and reliable, and moreover,
this ' remedy is not â , a patent medicine,
but it ' is a ? scientific combination â  of
pure pepsin (free from animal matter),
vegetable' essences, fruit salts and bis-
muth. It is sold by druggists under
name of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. No
extravagant claims are made for them,
but â¢'; for indigestion or any f stomach
trouble, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets j are
far ahead* of any â  remedy ? yet discov-
ered. They act on the food eaten, no
dieting is necessary, simply â  eat ; all the
wholesome 'â  food ' you want and these
tablets will digest it. A : cure results,
because all the : stomach ? needs is a
rest, which Stuart's â¢ Dyspepsia Tablets
give by doing the work of digestion.
Druggists sell these tablets at 50 cents
per package. ; Little' book on stomach

THE FUTURE OF THE FAMOUS COMSTOCK.
VIRGINIA CITY, April 5.â
â â¢Just the same, it's the best
town for its size on the coast."
Tho Virginia and Truckee
Railroadâ which, by the way,
pay? the best wages of any railroad in
the United Statesâ curves up through
the valley of the Carson River, and,
with many a turn, winds its way up
the mountains to Virginia City. The
majestic beauty of the mountain scen
ery in this part of Nevada is sufficient
of itself to make this most famous
mining country known the world over:
but the two drummers who sat In the
rear of the car wore blind to the suc
cession of wonderful views the bare
brown mountains, topped by glistening
snow-capped Sierras behind present.
The beauty of utility was the only
beauty that appealed to them.
And the town which called forth such
an encomium from the tongue of
shrewd experience?
Is Virginia City.
For years now, since the early glories
of the Comstock departed, it has been
condoled with and pitied. In fact, with
all its might it has had to resist being
buried alive. So dead have those un
dertakers, the financiers, declared the
Comstock to be.
But the Comstock Is not dead. De
spite the hard times it has passed
through, it still conserves energy
enough to round the corner of its ad
versities, and even now it is on the
road to better times.
No one can tell what the future of
this greatest of mining camps is to be.
The millions which it has poured into
the world's treasury are only half of
what lies hidden up there in those won
derful mountains, the cleverest of old
miners will tell you.
"If I had three millions," said the
most conservative, the most cautious
mining man in Virginia City the other
day â that he is the most conservative
is proved by the fact that he is one of
the few who have resisted the torrent
of speculation and is, in consequence,
a rich man to-day â "if I had three mil
lions I would invest two-thirds of what
I had in the American Flat and Silver
City country. There isn't so safe, so
profitable an investment for capital in
the world to-day."
Now that the difficulties which pre
vented the Comstock Tunnel Company
â the successors of the Sutro Tunnel
Company â and the various mining
companies from joint action in devel
oping the mines at present active have
beon overcome, the Comstock's pros
pects are distinctly brighter. The Con
solidated California and Virginia has
been disposing of its waste rock, and
paying royalties to the tunnel company
for some time past. This, the natural,
the most economical course, will now be
adopted by six of the greatest mining
properties, and prospecting on the
Brunswick lode with the development
of hitherto unopened ground will fol
low.
But the increase of work on the
Brunswick lode, on which Expert Ire
lan made -so favorable a report a few
weeks ago, is not the most important
iucnce of the peace pipe smoked
in San Francisco la^t week by repre
sentatives of the seven mining compa
nies â Franklin Leonard for the tunnel
company and William Sharon, delegate
at icjrge. If the good understanding at
present established between the powers
that control the Corns, toc-k^ d-sMrv cn
;s a new era of activity will be In
augurated which will \i~ with [ne hai
cyon days, when to be a Comstocker
was to- be a king of finaace â present or
pn Bpective.
The Silver City country lying to the
south of Virginia City and Gold Hill is
an undiscovered country, upon which
the eyes o fmining men look longingly.

"gang," it has abandoned hope of
electing it? ticket, and is now concen
trating all its efforts to save the
Mayoralty out of the wreck. Anybody
and everybody is being sacrificed for
a vote for Martin.
Persuasion and promises having
tailed to bring to thr boss the necessary
number of votes to elect his candidates,
threats are being used and terrorism
Invoked. Business men are called upon
and Informed in a > onfidential manner
that their support of the New Charter
Club ticket is likely to injure them in
the future in their business. But the
old reign of terror the boss is at en
ond in San Jose. His unprincipled tools
must conjure with other means. Fear
of the boss has flown. The citizens see
the opportunity to be free themselves
from the bonds that he has woven
about them for nearly two decades.
They have met the issue with a bold
and united front. They have seen their
Btrengtb daily Increasing, and their
confidence In complete victory grows
â  i- with each succeeding day.
They hayÂ»- *o-n the boss forced to
leave the spidfrr-iike retreat of his in
ner office, where he has in the past
been In the habit of weaving his politi
cal web; they have seen him forced to
take to the curb and to openly acknowl
edge the paternity of the ticket that
every one knows stands for continued
corruption and extravagance in the
public offices of this city; they have
eh ii him working tooth and nail for the
-Â«s of this ticket.
It is common remark that the "gang"
is making a fight such as has never
before been witnessed in the political
history <>f San Jose. It has seen friend
after friend, influence aft<--r influence,
organization after organization desert
Its standard and take their place be
hind th*- banner carried by the New
Charter Club; it hap been made to rea
lize that this is a campaign of principle
and not of candidates.
In order to blind the issue as much as
possible, the most * strenuous efforts
wore- made by the boss - to induce good
men to go on the "gang" ticket. Special
care was exercised in selecting I . the can
, didate for Mayor. Two gentlemen were
first favorably considered . to be used
! Every small prospecting party develops
1 gold. "If our silver dc-esn't please you,"
says Nevada jauntily, "here's gold for
! you."
The two arms of the Comstock lode
reach out to inclose the Silver City
i country. Mining experts look upo-n this
! vast territory as destined to build up
! the Interests of Nevada more than old
i Comstock mines ever did. There are
quantities of goJd here waiting for the
Judicious investment of capital, and
when once development is begun there
will be employment for all the miners
in the country. The Sutro tunnel will
I play an important part in the develop
1 ment of this section. Its extension into
1 the Silver City country is only a mat- ;
ter of time, a question o-f the degree of
enterprise and farsightedness of the
present company. The erection of a mill
at the mouth of the tunnel will, of
course, follow. These things' must
come. Eastern capitalists have been
looking into the possibilities of this vast
gold-bearing region, and its develop
ment in time is as sure as that Mount
Davidson looks across to Sugar Loaf '
and the desert â a view of unsurpassed
beauty.
Even within the past six months
overtures have been made to mine own
ers on American Flat for the reopen- ,
ing of the mines there. In '89 ore was
found on the flat that assayed from $50
to $5000 a ton. In the upper levels of
one mine assays of $80 a ton were made.
In a ton and a half of rock $900 worth
iof ore was found. The thing that I
! as the chief decoy on the "gang" ticket,
! but they declined to permit the use of
their names. The third choice was
more successful, and Charles J. Martin
j was slated for the questionable honor
i of heading the ticket of the "gang" in
| the present campaign.
Mr. Martin ma.de his record years
; ago, when he took a position in local
I politics that was opposed to the boss
j and his pernicious methods. Since Mr.
Martin was last In power the political
wheel has made a number of revolu
tions, which have produced important
changes. Within the past few years
the boss has seen fit to turn patronage
in the furniture and carpet line into the
hands of the Lions. ,
. This has been a source of considerable
profit to the Lion firm, the head of
which is a brother-in-law of Charles J.
' Martin. It was only a few weeks ago
that a contract fÂ»r school " sks was
awarded to the Lions at prices that
were extortionate.
It is generally accepted as a fact that
Martin could never have been induced
to re-enter the political arena and par
ticularly as a "gang" candidate, had it
I not been through the influ nee brought
ito bear upon him by the Lions. It can
:be further stated that none is more
active in behalf of the 'gang" ticket
to-day than these same Lions. No one
: who knows these circumstances doubts
| for a moment that the boss and the
"gang" will completely control. Martin
: should he by any possibility be elected
! to the Mayoralty.
On the other hand, at the head of the
New Charter Club ticket stands the
name of Sanford E. Smith, a man
against whom no â not even the
most rabid of the "gangsters"â has
ventured to utter one word of adverse
criticism. The only fact sought to be
1 brought up against him is that he is
! not known as a politician or one promi
! nent in public affairs. It is this very
fact that makes him such a candidate
as the people under the present cir
; cumstances require for the high duties
jof the Mayoralty. Mr. Smith has been
I in business in this city on <_ne of its
â  moet prominent streets for many years,
â  and has made a marked success. He
is a man of established integrity and
endowed with a firmness of character
that has been tested and never found
j wanting. He was one of the fathers of
' the new charter and also one of its
j most energetic supporters. ' It was
i largely through his personal efforts that
j this commendable instrument became
I the organic law of San Jose. ,i .. . ."'','.''
. In every contest that has been under-
I taken in the past to overthrow. the rule
I of corruption Mr. Smith has taken part
! and has. always been found on the side
! of the people and working in their in
| terests. He has never been allied di
â  rectly or indirectly with the "gang."
j He is one of the very few men who
can truthfu-.y say that they have never
served, consciously or unconsciously,
the purposes of the "gang." He hag
never held a public office in this city
and has never sought one. His ~ selec
tion at the present time was due solely
to his fitness; for the office and the
nomination was tendered as a reward
â¢ for his past services in behalf of honest
! and legitimate reform. ; He was, in
other words thy logical candidate. His
election will assure to the people of San
Jose a Mayor who v.ill look after ,:t heir
j interests as 'conscientiously, as ener
j getically and as successfully as he. has
I looked after his own private affairs.
If the people . wish to . continue to *he
I governed ;b*: - ossÃea ard his '."gaiijrV
I they will elect Charles J. Martin.; If
they wish to govern themselves in the
truest sense they will vote for Sanford
E. Smith. . â  : ; â  -.;

STOCKTON, April s.â Prattling at
the knee of a listless father, clinging to
! skirts, of a mother whose mind is
blighted, were three small children in
! the office of the Chief of Police this aft
ernoon. The . careworn features of thÂ«
I poor mother and the vacant ' stare of
j the father told of dire -.ffering.
The unfortunate man was A. F. yon

| by disconnected explanations, he and
: his wife came from Orange County,
j starting on Thursday for Portland,,
; with the hope of bettering their finan
i cial condition. They first went to ban
j Francisco and then Sacramento, where
' they changed their, minds and concluded j
ito return to Los Angeles. Yon Eida i
i still has a ticket for Portland on his
j person. . ' " v. : -
From Sacramento the family went to
j Gait on Sunday, where it was given food
j and shelter by some citizens. This
morning Yon Eida applied to Rev. Mr.
â¢ Blankenship, a South Methodist min
| ister, there, and asked him to ;accom
| pany them as far. as ; Stockton. .They
; appeared .-, to be afraid Â of ' every one
about them, and on the way to the
j railway station Yon Eida asked the
> clergyman whether a group of Gait
i people which they chanced to pass did
j not have designs upon them. - In the
: train they would take, no seat but the
; last one in the rear coach.
Upon arriving at Stockton Rev. Mr.
i Blankenship Invited them to take din

! learned they had had no breakfast. . As
! they started- to enter an omnibus the

The old air pipes have been done away

down on the 500-foot level; the only
electric blowers ever put into a Com

WANT TO RUN THE
VETERANS' HOME
Candidates for the Place on the
National Board to Be
Made by Barrett.
His Term Will Expire in May, and
There Are Three Candidates
for the Position.
The term of General A. W. Barrett as
national commissioner for the Veterans' |
Home at Santa Monica is drawing to a | :
close, and candidates for the vacancy to j
be caused by his withdrawal from the
board 'are already beginning to appear.
â¢ It is conceded by a good many that
Major W. H. Bonsall of Los Angeles has i
the best chance so far, for he claims j
the' support of a majority of the Repub
licans of the California delegation at
Washington, and as Hull, chairman of j
: the military committee of the House, will j
do the appointing, it is considered that '
he will get it.
General Warfield is out for the place,
however, and there are as many more of
his friends who say he will get It to a
I certainty. He has powerful Influence at
work, but as Bonsall has been recom- |
: mended to Hull by. Perkins, Hilborn and i
Barham, It must be more than powerful |
to get him the place.
Colonel W. R. Smedberg was after the
; place at one time: he made application !
; as. soon as he heard that a Republican J
would succeed General Barrett, but when |
his application reached Washington his \
i friends wrole back that he was just three !
days too late; Bonsall had already been i
| .recommended for the place by the Re- '
publican members of the delegation men- j
tioned, and then Colonel Smedberg rested j
i his light, and he has done nothing in the j
matter since then. He believes there is
now no doubt that Bonsall will get the
' office." . : ."â â¢'â¢â  â  '/â / â  â . ;

1 over two years now, and in that time
1 has proved its inventor's statement
that lov/ grade ore which the old bo
nanza kings threw away, leaving it in
great heaped up dumps all over town
I at the mouths of the shafts, is valuable
and ma-- be made to pay when worked
by this process. Since the erection of
the Kinkead mills these great dumps
of waste rock in Virginia City are
wasting away. But there are still
1 6.000,000 tons to be disposed of by the
clever inventor, who pays 10 per cent
of his gross yield to the mining com
pany whose waste rock he feeds to his
mill, and still finds it profitable to con
tinue the work. This inventor, like all
others, has had to make his way
against inertia and skepticism. But
he is continually increasing the extent
of his operations, and expects to crush
200 tons of rock daily before long, and
to do it with fifteen horsepower in
HAYNES HAS A
NEW DEFENSE
Will Attempt to Show That
He Did Not Fire the
Fatal Shot.
Chief Lees Speaks of Officers' Brav
ery, and Sweeney Thinks
They Shot Wild.
The Haynes case, otherwise known
as the trial of the man who
is alleged to have murdered Lieu- j
tenant Burke in cold blood, was re- !
sumed before Judge Conlan yesterday
morning, and during the examination of
witnesses it was plainly seen to be a j
police examination of the citizens for the i
purpose of placing blame or credit upon |
the officers who were with Burke at the j
time of the fatal shooting. For the first â 
time since the case has come before the I
court the attorneys have laid out their j
line of defense, and as the moments, or I
rather days, go by they believe from the '
testimony given that the case becomes !
stronger and >;et stronger for the defend
ant in the case.
Attorney Sweeney stated yesterday that
he had arrived at the conclusion that if
his client shot Lieutenant Burke it was j
done on the spur of the moment from the j
fear that some one was endeavoring to '
take his property from him, and that if ;
Haynes did the shooting it was in self- j
defense or in the interests of his prop- ;
erty. But the attorney went still further, i
and stated that he believed that a shot j
other than that from the gun of the de- !
Cendant produced the fatal wound. Many |
witnesses were called to the stand to tes- j
tify that Burke had been shot by Haynes i
after he had fallen to the ground, and :
as some stated that he had been shot j
at least three times there were others
who were of the opinion that their vision
was impaired on the fatsil day.
Chief Lees states that from all the tes
timony given tlie officers who were pres
ent at the time showed all the bravery
expected from any man, whether citizen
or officer, and he believes the lieutenant's
life was protected to the best of the offi
ceru' ability. it whs at tirst supposed
that the defense would be insanity, but
future development will show self-defense
for a line on which it is expected to clear
the accused.
Many witnesses were examined during
the day on the question as to whether
or not Haynes had fired shots into the :
body of Lieutenant Burke after he had
fallen, and in the general course of events
the witnesses were not sure as to wheth
er or not the shots had been fired as
stated. The prosecuting attorney for the
court. Attorney- Mogan. thinks that the
officers did all in their power and the be
lief is borne out by the Chief of Police.
Witnesses Martin Johnson, John Ryan,
Harry Fee, F. C. Peters, F. W. Peters,
I Joseph Conroy. John Waters, John Mc-
Grath and Cornelius Ryan all testified as
Ito whether or not the defendant fired
shots into the lieutenant after he had
I fallen from the first shot, but there was
a slight disagreement as to the facts.
: As a rule the attorney for the defense
did not cross-examine the witnesses, as
i he stated that he was waiting for a bet
| ter opportunity and was positive that his
: client would be held over before the Su
i perior Court on the charges. The case
i will be continued this morning at 11
o'clock, -when it is thought the officerÃ
I who were with Lieutenant Burke will be
! stead of the sixty horsepower that I
i made milling 30 expensive an opera- !
â  tion in the old days and rendered val- j
i ueless vast quantities of low grade ore. j
The Harris-Blood Company is work- j
i ing on the same lines down in Six-mile 1
Canyon. Their process is chemical, |
though, where the Kinkead mill's work j
is mechanical. Thirty years ago the j
tailings from the mines were carried j
down to the canyon, where they have ;
lain ever sin-ce, an immense pile known j
as the Parks' tailings, 200,000 tons in i
all. But one test of the new method \
of working these tailings has been
made, and that was in September, 1897.
But the result was highly satisfactory.
I It is not possible to get good results
when the tailings are wet. Consequent
ly the company is waiting for the
spring weather and Washoe zephyrs to
dry the mass before beginning work.
It is only a matter of a few days now
before the canyon will resound with
] the whirr of machinery and the men
i employed by the company will work
; 200 tons of tailings daily. So that the
i old extravagance of the Comstock is
being turned to account, now that times
are harder.
If the people of Virginia City couM
live on air and water alone they would
be giants of strength. There is no
other water like this. Nowhere in the
world is the air so pure, the sky so
clear, the stars so bright. The purity
of the atmosphere deceives one as to
distances, and the mountains stand out
sharply, picturesquely, impossibly near.
PLAN A REFUGE
FOR RAILWAY MEN
Christian Endeavorers Will
Establish a Depot on
Mission Street.
Reading- Rooma VVill Be Provided
as a Means of Instructive
Pastime.
The third meeting of the Young People's
Bodety of Christian Endeavorers for the
purpose of agitating the institution of a ;
place of refuge at the Mission street cat
house, for the railway employes of the i
Market street system, was held last even
ing in Trinity Presbyterian Chia-ch.
The object of establishing this depot, as
it is called, is to provide a suitable place
where the car men of the city generally j
may meet both for religious and fraterÂ» j
nal purposes, and spend their leisure
time there instead of in more vicious re.
sorts. A reading-room and library will i
be provided, and entertainments, socials ;
and musicales will be given from time to
time by the members of the church so- j
ciety.
The society maintains that the men em
ployed on railroads have not, as a rule,
a place of this character to resort to in
thÂ»ir toiaure moments, and, in const
quence, the; are compelled to accept more j
\ icious and degrading amusements which :
they would undoubtedly forsake if a suit
ab:e place could be provided for them.
Suponntendent Vinir.g of ihe Market !
street railway system has granted and |
set aside a portion of the carhouse on
Mission street; and this accomplished it
remains with the church people simply
to provide and equip it with the neces
sary attractions.
As the detrfaed work will necessarily
entail considerable expense before it is
: placed on the desired basis, the society
j nopes to obtain this money from its mem
! hers and those of the congregation will
ing to donate small sums for the success
oi the refuge.
The meeting last evening was well rep
resented and unusual enthusiasm and in
: lerest were manifested in the proposed
| scheme by hundreds of young people of I
: the church.
I Dr. Uilbert of Calvary Presbyterian :
| Church brielly outlined the purpose of
the institution of the depot, and spoke of
the good work accomplished in other large
cities where such a system had been in
; augurated.
I Rev. C. A. Brown acted as president ot
! the meeting in the absence of the pastor :
| ot 1 runty Church.
An interesting programme â¦as rendered
| in conjunction with the meeting, and the
j young ladies who helped to make it an
enjoyable success were Miss Wilson and
j Miss Kdith Mills, both of Trinity Church.
NOT A VACANT BED LEFT.

The. City ana County Hospital Filled
to Overflowing With
Patients.
The old ramshackle building known as
| the City and County Hospital is filled to ;
| overflowing with patients. The last of i
i the 414 bods in the building was occupied
â  last night by Leonard D. Hanley. a young
| man who fell on Alabama and Twenty- ;

broke his left leg Jjetween the knee joint I
and the ankle. Kre was conveyed to the !
hospital, where Dr. Curl set the limb and
put him to bed.
The old building, In its rotten condition.
I Here is the place for the great
est astronomical observatory of the
world. Nowhere else, so scientists wno
have visited the Comstock say, are the
conditions so favorable. On Mount Da
vidson's top, the observer's eye, un
troubled by atmospheric variation, by
town exhalations, could seek out ce
lestial mysteries, hidden elsewhere.
Some day a wise man, who is also a
rich manâ that beautiful combination
will become aware of this fact, and as
tronomical science will rise up and call
him blessed.
Still, the future of the Comstock is
bound to be a mining future. A new
generation, cured â if such a thing be
possible â of the gambling mania, ready
to develop the mines for the mineral
that lies within them, desirous of work
ing the rich ledges of ore whose exist
ence is undoubted, with the assistance
of new inventions and riper experience
and business habits will yet be the so
lution of the Comstock's troubles.
Interest in the Comstock is not dead.
This is the land of surprises, of thÂ«
unexpected, of unlimited possibilities.
Its be-burrowed land is still fought
over as desperately â though legally and
in a more civilized fashion â its boun
daries are defined as jealously as in the
days when its stock sold for a thou
sand times as much per share as it does
to-day.
As to the Comstocker himself, he's a
born bull. His optimism is practically
unquenchable. The longer he lives up
in this wonderful, interesting town,
whose houses have their back yards a
block above their front entrance, the
longer his pathway daily is about the
hem of Mount Davidson's skirts, the^
more thoroughly convinced he is of-^
Providence's especial interest in It. He
refuses to believe that what h%s been,
cannot again be. He will never be con
verted from the belief he holds with
such intensity that the Comstock is an
exception to mining countries in gen
eraj; that there are fully as good fish,
silver and gold, in the mineral sea of
majestically beautiful mountains
around here as ever were caught by
such expert fishermen as the bonanza
kings; that far down, hiding snugly be
neath a subterranean ocean that covers
the deeper levels, or above the Sutro
Tunnel level where the spendthrift mil
lionaire prospector of early days dis
dained to seek, or in the new lode, or
behind stately Mount Davidson, or in
American Flat, or the comparatively
unexplored region of the Silver 1 City
country the precious metals are still to
be found in such profusion as generous
Nevada bestows upon sagebrushers who
trust in her.

Gardner Tolls How the Mayor Did
the "Rush" Act With
Him.
â¢ â¢â¢â¢ "â¢ Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, April 5.
" â  More of the petty dealings of the Mayor
' aud various employes of the City Hall
â¢ â¢ were told to the Grand Jury to-day by
â  Chief Fair, late of the Fire Department,!
: . and â¢ Charley E. Gardner, late clerk to
the ' Chief of Police. ;
:.' The story of Gardner is to the effect j
that many months ago at Mayor Thomas'
. Buggestlon, or, at least with his cogni
.'jan' - ( v . Gardner circulated a subscription
V/listl' it the City Hall for money with
;.'..' Which to pay the expenses of Mayor
'â¢'Â» T^ho.maÃ' contested election. The contest
â¢'.tfas. â  brought by ex-Mayor Davie, and was
â¢.Vgedtewhat expensive, and the idea pre
jj.VaJledUhat If several of the employes at
. ' thb: City Hall whose heads depended on
". ' the- : yleasure of the Board of Public
:': ' Works, were to subscribe to this fund and
relieve the Mayor of the financial end of
the contest, they would thereby be se
cured in office.
â¢ â¢- Gardner says that he received some en
couragement among the employes, and
also that at first ex-Chief of Police Lloyd
encouraged him to go ahead. Janitor John
. Wild the Afro-American representative
at the City Hall, was also interested in
â¢â¢-circulating the petition for subscriptions.
Alter a few days, however, Chief Lloyd
decided that it was not a dignified pro
ceeding, and advised his clerk, Gardner,
to have nothing more to do with it. The
ription was then abandoned.
: "Another story is being told to the ef
fect that when Mayor Thomas made his i
appointment on the Board of Health, it :
was understood that only members of the {
"regular school should be appointed, in re- i
' turn for which the allopaths were to as- j
Fist the Mayor in paying his bill to Dr. |
Small, who brought him through a severe |
illness during the campaign of last |
spring. This story has been repeatedly
contradicted by the Mayor, but is now
Leing told with great vigor, and will no
.doubt reach the Grand Jury officially, as j
It. Ims already dona Informally. ;
'â â¢ Gardner also says that the Mayor, on ,
pome occasions, tried to borrow money
from him. In one Instance Gardner says ,
"h- had just received his pay. and the :
' Mayor attempted the "rush act.' and
with success. He rushed up to Gardner i
and wished the loan of 125, just for a
â  few ours to help him meet a bill. Gard- j
ncr says he complied, and it is not im
possible that he may bring suit against
the Mayor to recover the small loan.
' .Ex-Chief Fair also tells a story to the
Grand Jury regarding the Mayor's at
tempt to borrow from him. But his story. ;
as well as Gardner's, loses much of its
force from the fact that neither of them
! would admit the truth of the rumors
â¢ months ago when they were in office.
Less than two months ago John Wilds
"â¢â distinctly denied that he had ever seen
or heard of any subscription list in any
body's behalf at the City Hall.
The reported attempt at brokerage for
positions in the Police Department was
again before the Grand Jury to-day. J.
S Fox. the boxing instructor of the Re
lianoe Club, and who is an acquaintance
' of Harry Thomas, was in the juryroom.
He was supposed to know why Police
â¢ Officer McKinley was appointed, but he
.emphatically denied that he knew any
â ' thing about the matter. He said he had!
='. spoken to Harry Thomas in regard to i
â  McKlnley and had told the latter to go I
to the City Hall and see the Mayor him
. self. He denied having told anybody that
' appointments were worth 1300, and also
that he had ever told anybody of know
.'- Ing an officer to have given a cent for his
position.
â  The stories of loans and subscriptions
â¢ have all been discussed around town for t
â¢'.â  months, and from the evidence so far
taken there does not appear to be much
legal foundation on which to base crim
. lnal action, although there can be no
doubt that many of the rumors are based
on transactions that carry with them
moral guilt and cannot fall to leave a
Ftlgrna as deep as if a criminal convic- :
tion had followed. There are reports con
"cerning bribery in connection with the.
nickel-in-the-slot machines that were
suppressed by ordinance some months
afro. It is openly stated that the sum
â  , of $230 was paid to a ceitain official at the ;
, City Hall for protection for these ma
chines, and that when it was seen that j
the purchased protection could not be de- i
llvered, the man who paid the. money i
â¢â¢-took his tun to the City Hall and de- â¢
manded its refunding within two hours,
and it is said that the money was paid
back within that time.
" All of these stories no doubt have some
foundation and point to a system of cor
ruption and cheap politics under the pres- !
ent administration. Beyond enlightening â 
the public upon these matters it is not
likely that many of the charges can be
â  prosecuted in such a manner an to in
sure legal punishment for the offenders.
CLERICAL CRITICS.
They Resent Editorial Views of the
Recent Sermons.
OAKLAND, April The sermons on
the Spanish question, published in The â 
Call last Monday morning, having been
criticized by several newspapers. Rev. â 
Dr. Coyle, Dr. Dille and Rev. C. H. Ho- |
bart to-ilay replied to their critics.
Dr. Coyle said:
"My contention for war was based en
tirely upon the idea of righteousness.
Peace never can be reached except
through righteousness and no question is
over settled until it is settled right. And !
I .still believe, as I said before, it' Spain j
does not yield, if she insists upon keep
ing her hard heel upon the neck of Cuba, i
if she refuses to end the outrages and
abominations in that unhappy land, and
if she will not make reparation for the
destruction of our great warship lying
peacefully at anchor in one of. her ports
and for the blood of so many of our gal
lant sailorsâ then, I say, let the sword
of justice fall, let righteousness strike
and afterward will come the sweet angel
of peace."
Dr. Dllle said:
"Every true American, it seems to me,
must contemplate with pride and | grat
itude the course the Government and the
nation have so far held on the Cuban
question. The patience and temperate
calmness of our -people under great prov.
ocation; the support Congress has given
the executive, and the statesmanship of
Mr. McKiniey and his advisers, have add
ed'an honorable chapter to our nation's
history.
"As to the future: If our Government
cannot by diplomacy succeed in . con
vincing. Spain that she cannot suppress
the rebellion and induce her to give Cuba
Independence, then we must forcibly In
tervene, for Cuba must be free. God
wills it. That ample time has been given
to try paciilc means is certain. We must
act now or be particeps criminis in op
pression and butchery.
"As to the Maine incident: The larger
Cuban question settled, nothing short or
j abject apology and ample indemnity
from Spain should avert war upon that
! issue. Otherwise it is a casus belli and
the Maine should be avenged though it
take all the resources of the nation.'
Rev. Mr. Hobart said: "As to the claim
: that because the Bible teaches non-reslst
â¢ ance between Individual*, the theory of
non-resistance Should be followed out be
tween nations, I would say that I, per
1 Bonally, may turn my other cheek to be
i smitten and suffer personal indignity, but
: as the head of a family with a wile and
children m protect. 1 would not be J ustl J
Hod in carrying out such a theory. And
1 take it that the same is true of nations
i 1 most certainly am for war if Spain will
; not discontinue her atrocities in Luna
and make proper reparation for tne
blowing; up of the Maine.
"At this juncture it is cause for devout
thanksgiving that we have a President
who. seeking wisdom daily of the Most
I High, realizes to the full that he must
! answer, not to the peaoe-at-any-price or
1 war-at-any-prlce factions of the hour
i but to impartial history and to the uoa
I of Nations."

MOFFETT AND HILL.
Did One Murderer Influence the Fate
of the OtherP
OAKLAND, April s.â Joseph H. Moffett
must answer to the Superior Court for :
the murder of his wife. In the Police
Court this morning, Mrs. McDonald, mat
ron of the Receiving Hospital, was on
the stand, and said that when suffering
from his wounds, Moffett had told her he
had been forced to kill his wife, but did
not {rive any explanation. It will be the
policy of the defense that Moffett was
so worked up over the attentions of one
Davis, to his wife, that the shooting was
justifiable.
It is generally thought that the shoot
ing of Mrs. Moffett by her husband con- !
Biderably Influenced Governor Budd in his
refusal to interfere in the case of Ben
jamin Hill, who will hang to-mormw fop
mudoring his wife. Just about the timo
VV. \V. Foote and others made the plea.
for Hill's life, Moffett committed his
crime, within a mile of where Hill had
committed murder. One of the attorneys
for Hill said at the time that the mur
d-i of Mcs. Moffett was an ill-omen for
Hlh.
GIRL WIFE COMPLAINS.
The Aged Husband Says He Has
Most Cause to Dissent.
OAKLAND, April Should the divorce j
suit of George R. R. Ainsworth ever
come to trial it will bring out some sen
sational evidence. Over a week ago Mrs.
Ainsworth. who is just 20 years of age,
brought suit against her aged husband
for divorce. Mr. Ainsworth is Just three
and a half times as old as his wife, and
when they married It was freely proph- â 
esied that they would not long live to- |
gether in peace,
Mrs. Ainsworth charged extreme cruel- '
ty, most of the alleged acts, however,
being mental cruelty and not physical. j
The aped husband has filed his answer i
and denies every charge. It is said that
he has in his possession some interesting
documents written by his young wife to !
young men and which he does not con
sider should have been sent by a dutiful !
wife. It is possible that Mr. Ainsworth '
may also file a cross-complaint.

BLANDING ON THE RACK.
Does Not Satisfy the Court by His
Evasive Answers.
OAKLAND, April s.â Charles F. Bland
ing, who Obtained large sums of money
in return for stock in the Jupiter mines,
which he promised to incorporate, was
subjected to a severe examination by
Judge Greene to-day. Some documents
were brought into court and carefully ex
amined, but they did not satisfy the
Judge.
Judge Grepne commented very severely
on the manner in which Blanding had
conducted his trust as assignee of the
estate of Mrs. Ingalls since she went into
insolvency. The witness was not very
ready at answering questions and seemed
to take pleasure in irritating the court.
If it were not a fact that Mrs. Naglea,
to whom Blanding assigned Mrs. Ingalls'
mortgage, is completely under the In
fluence of Blanding the case could be
closed much quicker. The court contin
ued the case until to-morrow.
Commissioners to Change.
OAKLAND, April s.â City Attorney
Dow was elected president of the Police
Pension Commissioners - this morning.
During the past year City Engineer Clem
ent has held this office. To-morrow tha
Board of Public Works will meet and
elect a president to succeed Mayor
Thomas. This will probably go to Mr.
Clement, and Mayor Thomas be elected
president of the Police and Fire Commis
sioners, a position now held by Mr. Dow.
The Board of Public Works will meet
to-morrow, and it is possible that some
changer will be made at the City Hall.
There is a clerkship in the Chief of
Police's office to fill, and there are several
candidates. A clerk may also be ap
pointed to the chief of the Fire Depart
ment.
Strong pressure is being brought to
bear on Mayor Thomas from certain
quarters to vote with City Engineer
Clement to remove Street Superintendent
Mi) er. Mcl Holmes is. the slated candi
date, but the protest of the merchants
against the removal of Miller may break
the slate which was put up when Chlef.s
I.ioyd and lair were removed a week
ago.
Big Money at Stake.
OAKLAND, April f..â The suit of Mrs.
Susan A Martin and her two minor chil
dren, W. W. and Louise G.- Martin for
$50,000 damages from the Southern' Pa
cific Company for the death of her
husband and the children's father was
begun to-day before Judge Ogden Mar
tin was killed near the station at IrvinÃ
ton on September C, 1894. while driving
along the county road. He died shortly
after being struck by the train. Most of
the day was occupied in securing a jury
after which the attending physician' was
placed upon the stand. He told of the
injuries sustained by Martin. The case
will be continued to-morrow.

MADE CHARGES
OF PARTIALITY
Class Line Said to Have
Been Drawn in the
Schools.
Superintendent McClymonds
Has a Scheme That Is
Not Feasible.
Mr. Oirard Says if All Wera Treated
Alike Crowding Could Be
Relieved.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, April B.
The charges made last night by Coun
cilman Glrard and Mr. Wheeler of West
Oakland that there Is discrimination be
ing made among the school children by
Superintendent McClymonds has aroused
general interest and brought to the sur
face much that has been smoldering for
years.
Mr. McClymonds is bent upon removing
the Tompkins school from a thickly pop
ulated district Bouth of Seventh street,
where it has healthy surroundings and
fine playgrounds, to a lot at Ninth and
Castro streets, where it will be impossible
unless by purchase to have any play
ground. The cost of this move is conser
vatively estimated by the Board of Edu
cation at $13,000 for the land and $5000 for
removing the school. Practical contrac
tors, however, assert that to cut the big
school in three pieces, move it the long
distance it jvould have to go, rebuild it
and put it in good condition, would cost
at least $20,000. It is also said that to buy
enough ground for an adequate play
ground would cost $40,000 more, and the
argument is made that after all this ex
penditure the people whom McClymondfl
would benefit would be at a greater dis
aavaatage than at present.
Mr. McClymonds stated that he did not
know why parents north of the steam
track would not send their children to
school south of the track, and ridiculed
the idea that it was because they did not
want to send their children across the
track four times each day. McClymonds
showed with figures and diagrams that
there are now 600 children south of Sev
enth street, of whom 400 attend the
Tompkins school, the school is capable
of and large enough to accommodate 600
children, and the nearest school north
of Seventh street is overcrowded. McCly
monds would therefore take the school
north of the track and have the 400 chil
dren walk from seven to twelve blocks
four times a day across the track rather
than have the congestion from the Cole
school cross the track to fill up the Tomp
kins school.
This idea of Mr. McClymonds irritated
Councilman Girard, who was for several
years on the Board of Education. "You
pretend not to know why people do not
wish to send their children south of Sev
enth street to school." said Girard. "You
know very well why it is, but you don't
like to say so. North of Seventh street
is an aristocratic district, while south are
lots of poor families, many of them Ital
ians and Irish, and you want to pander
to the people north of the track and Ig
nore the rights of the humbler class to
the south." Mr. McClymonds attempted
to deny that such discrimination was
shown, but Mr. Wheeler said that hu
could prove it, and that there are at thi*
time a few "aristocratic" families south
of Seventh street, who have been given
permits to attend the Cole school, in
stead of obeying the law and attending
the Tompkins school, where there is yet
room for 20) children.
Wheeler said he could present tho
names of fifteen children to whom Mc-
Clymonds had pandered by letting thorn
attend the Cole school. The superintend
ent denied this, but the argument of Gir
ard, Brosnahan and Wheeler, added to
the practical experience of Mr. Cuvellier,
who has four children in West Oakland,
had so much effect that out of the whole
Council Mr. McClymonds only received
one vote.
There Is the greatest satisfaction ex
hibited in the Tompkins school district to
day over the fact that the school is not
to be removed.

however, also wants the race to be hold
on the Friday before the field day, while
the Berkeley men stand out for the pre
ceding Wednesday. The dispute is in
the hands of the faculty athletic commit

A CAT GAVE THE ALARM.

Have Been a Large Fire.
ALAMEDA, April 5.â A cat gave an
alarm of fire this morning, which un- j
I doubtedly prevented the destruction of i

AS HAPPY AS
TWO LOVERS
Mr. Dingee Explains the
Position of Mr.
Moffitt.
The Senator Was Never on
the Payroll of the Water
Company.
Hava Not Fallen Out and Each Con
siders the Other His Beet
Friend.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 5.
Just at this time the relations existing
between William J. Dingee, president of
the Oakland Water Company, and ex-
Senator Frank J. Moffitt are naturally
of great interest. The Grand Jury is in
session and it is generally believed that
either of these two men could tell a good
story if he so desired. Consequently a
report that Mr. Dingee and Mr. Moffltt
had quarreled, and that Mr. Moffitt was
no longer seen around the office of or in
terested in the affairs of the Oakland
Water Company would be a very pretty
story if it were true. Unfortunately for
the tale it is not true.
Mr. Dingee was in his office to-day, and
when asked how much truth there was
in the report that he had quarreled with
Mr. Moffitt he said that it was all as
false asâ any old place. "The relation
ship between Mr. Moffitt and myself,"
said he, "i 9 one of pure friendship, and
it is no less solid to-day than it ever was.
We have not quarreled, Mr. Moffitt has
been around this office considerably and
when a reporter of a morning paper called
on. me yesterday and asked me if Mr.
Moffltt had left the Oakland Water Com
pany I said no. I told him that he was
here Saturday and to-day (yesterday),
but that last week perhaps he might not
have been in as much as usual. Out of
that simple statement was woven an at
tempt at sensationalism, which, it seems
to me, is very poor newspaper work.
"Mr. Moffitt has never been on the pay
roll of the Oakland Water Company. He
has never received a dollar from the com
pany. He has personal interests in the
company, and he looks after them ener
getically. Beine a friend of mine, he
naturally has worked in my interest. Ha
has never been a political manager or any
other kind of manager for the Oakland
Water Company. We are aa friendly as
ever and I cannot understand why a big
newspaper should publish such bosh."
Ex-Senator Moffltt, who was himself in
the newspaper business for many years,
said this morning that Mr. Dingee had
just assured him that if there was any
necessity of sharing a dollar with him
(Moffltt) he would willingly do it. "We
have had no quarrel, and, in fact, thero
is nothing to quarrel about. A newspaper
rumor has no effect on me, and I am in
the water business as business, and to
make money if possible. I am not awaro
that I have been around the water com
pany's office less than usual and cer
tainly Mr. Dingeo. and I bear the same
relationship to each other that we have
done for pome years. On the first of
January, when the two water companies
agreed to charge the legal rates, com
mencing March 1, all was done that could
he done, and since then I have not been
active in water matters."
Mr. Dingee disclaims that Mr. Moffltt
was a leading factor In fixing the new
water rates, and says that he appeared
personally before the Council and before
the water committee, and that on no oc
casion did Mr. Moffltt attend the City
Hall conferences as a representative of
the water company.

IN THE REAL
ESTATE WORLD
The Threatened War Has
Had Its Effect on the
Market
H. Wreden Makes a $130,000
Purchase in Southern
Celifornia.
Largo Purchasa of Pacific Heights
Propertyâ The Records, Sales
and Notes
For a long time investments in real es
tate have been marked for various rea
sons by hesitation and timidity on the
part of buyers. This conseauent dull
ness has of late been intensified by the
prospect of war with Spain. Few deal
ers hesitate to admit this fact. In the
current issue of the San Francisco Real
Estate Circular Thomas Magee, after
stating that a duller month than March
has not been seen for a lon '^period, says:
"The excitement created by the threat
ened war with Spain and the fall in prices
of stocks and bonds which resulted,
caused all real estate and other investors
to hold back, thereby practically paralyz
ing all movement, either in real estate
or other securities."
Despite the many obstacles in the way
it is cheerful to notice that of late there
has been a slight improvement in the tone
of the CO unify realty market. There has
been a fair inquiry, the never-failing pulsa
of the real estate system, and some few
sales, one of very good size. Henry AVre
den of the Washington Brewery has pur
chased for $130,1)00 what has been known
as the Flint Stock Ranch, situated thirty
miles from McGill station In San Luis
Obispo County. There are 6200 acres In
the ranch, which has always been used
for stock-raising purposes. Mr. Pryor,
the gas litter, was the seller. Ten pei
cent was paid down, the rest being due
in regular installments. Mr. Wreden will
continue to use the land as a, stock ranch.
Though the rates are not conceded to
be beyond the power Of ordinary busi
ness to pay, interest remains at 6% and
7 per cent. The total number of sales
for March was 229, in the total sum of
J545.615. The mortgages and trust deeds,
numbering 316, reached a total valuation
of $1,191,919; the releases and reconvey
ances, numbering 250, amounted when ag
gregated to $54u,430. Sixty-six building
contracts were recorded, being for a total
valuation of $330,489.

HOFF SENTENCED TO DIE.
Unless the Supreme Court Intervenes
He Will Pay the Denth Penalty
Next June.
Albert Hoff, an upholsterer, convicted
of the brutal murder of Mrs. Mary Clute,
in her home at 803 Guerrero street, last
December, was sentenced by' Judge Cook
yesterday to be hanged at San Quentln
prison on June 10 next. An appeal will
be taken to the Supreme Court by Hoff's
attorneys, and the usual delay will un
doubtedly follow.
When Hoff appeared for sentence yes
terday morning, his attorneys Interposed
the usual technical objections to the pass
ing of judgment. They claimed that er
rors of law had been committed during
the trial, and in addition urged the statu
tory grounds why sentence should not be
passed.
Judge Cook, in overruling: the motion*
of the defense, said that he had care

satisfied from the evidence adduced at
the trial that the verdict was a just one.
Hoff accepted the sentence in the same
spirit of nonchalance that has marked
his every movement since the day of his
irrest.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, April s.âAl
bert Hoff arrived at the prison just at
lockup, when the hundreds of iron doors
are being slammed closed. Once within
the massive gate and behind the great
walls of the penitentiary. Albert Fred
erick George Vereneseneckockockhoff lost
his high sounding name and in the
future will be known as Convict Number
17691
It was fifteen minutes before 5 o'clock
when the murderer arrived at San Quen
tin in charge of Deputy Sheriff James
Kennedy. From Green Brae station to
the prison Hoff occupied a seat between
the driver of the stage and the officer.
Hoff had nothing to say. He was hand
cuffed and uninteresting, and as he
1 walked toward the entrance of the prison
I he approached a score of guards who had
been attracted to the spot out of curi
osity.
He was led to Captain Edgar's office
and registered. Then he was taken to
; the photograph gallery, where his pict
ures were taken â one with his hat off
and another with his hat on. After thia
he was put into the bathtub and instead
of his civilian garb was given a suit of
stripes with the number 17694 printed
thereon. As the light was hardly suffi-

was led away to Murderers' Row, wherg
he was placed in the cell occupied by

MAHEA WANTS SHARKEY.
The National Club Received a DisÂ»
patch to That Effect last
Evening.
It was stated yesterday that after Jef*
fries had finished with Mexican Pete hÂ«
would depart immediately for the East,
where he had other engagements of im
portance to attend.
Billy Delaney, the manager of Jeffries,
said his charge would meet Peter Maher
and Gus Ruhling in the East, and that
the Maher-Jeffries fight was booked fof
May 20 at Syracuse, N. Y.
Delaney was evidently stretching a
point when he made this latter state
ment, or in other words, he may feel dis
posed to rush his man away from meet
ing Tom Sharkey, the bold sailor lad, who
stated before the Jeffries and "Mexican
Pete" match was consummated that
rather than miss an opportunity *o prova
to Jeffries that he was not a /fiJcer of
solid punishment, he (Sharke:^ would
flip a coin for the choice of clubs, viz.,
the Olympic or National.
It will be remembered that Sharkey
favored the National Club and Jeffries
the Olympic Club, and as neither man
wo/ld consent to fight outside of his
choice of clubs, Sharkey finally agreed to
decide the question by a flip of a coin,
which Delaney's coming champion re
fused.
According to the following dispatch,
which was received by the National Club
last evening from M. Connolly, the backer
and manager of Peter Maher. it does not
seem as if Jeffries had had an under
standing with Mnher, relative to a fight
In New York in May or in any other
month. The message reads:
Managers National Athletic Club, San Fran
cisco: Am offered $12.0<>"Â» by the Syracuse Club
for a fight between Maher and Sharkey. Will
come if you can give the same.
M. roxNOLiLT.
The National Club managers said last
evening that they will not offer a purse
to any one of the fighters, and that if
Maher is willing to journey to this city
they will give 60 per cent of the gross re
ceipts for a match between Sharkey and
Maher.
Sharkey is seemingly anxious to fight
Maher. Jeffries or any other man for the
percentage stated, but it is doubtful if
Muher will accept any offer unless he Is
guaranteed a block and tackle by which
he can pull down the winner's end, win
or lose.
In case Jeffries shall defeat Mexican
Pete Sharkoy has stated that he is ready
to deposit any sum from $1000 to $5000 as a
side wager that he will whip the man
from Oakland in less than ten rounds,
and if not Jeffries can take the side wager
and the entire purse.
The San Francisco Athletic Club will
give an entertainment this evening. W.
B. Dirks and J. Firet will box for the
bantam championship; J. Granfield and
C. Dixon will box for the featherweight
championship: G. Bates and G. Koster
will box for the heavyweight champion
ship. A. Greggains and F. McConnell
will give a four-round exhibition -contest.
On Friday evening the Excelsior Ath
letic Club will entertain its members and
the event of the evening will be an eight
round bout between Billy Otts of the
Excelsiors and Hugh Dougherty of Chi
cago.

coeo and Montgomery.
Jockey Dick Clay.sop passed an
evening by his own fireside and piloted
f"iir winners across the line at Oakland :
â  rday. He is a streaky sort of rider j
this young man from Woodland, for
Borne of his exhibitions would give one
the jaundice; they savor so of the yel
low. None of his successes yesterday
was astride first choices in the ring.
In fact it was a shady day for favor
ites, for without a Bingie exception all
fell by the wayside.
The weather was cool, which In a
measure accounts for the poor time i
made. The betting, however, was fast |
enough to make amends for all the
other tailings. The attendance was
better than on the opening day.
Pelxotto had one of his good days. !
and at odds of 5 and 6 to 1 the erratic j
Brutus gelding led the 2 to 5 favorite.
Rosormonde, out by a couple of lengths
in the opening six-furlong sprint. Plu
meria, with a world of speed, lasted !
long enough to get the show.
Tully Coulter's colt Dally Racing
Form received big support to win the
five and a half furlong sprint that fol- :
lowed, and finished third. In a hard'
drive tho> Burns & "Waterhouse entry, i
Elsmore, got the decision, a neck before
Towanda.
Ed Purser's Rey d*l Tierra was nomi
nated for th^ mile and a sixteenth sell
ing run. but after showing speed for i
nearly six furlongs, retired from the |
contest. Gotobed, the "push" nominee, j
second choice at post time, assumed the j
lead the last part, and. driving hard, .
beat the 30 to 1 shot, Twlnkler, out a |
scant length In 1:48%.
Garnet Ferguson's fllly, Maud Fer- j
guson. was mail favorite over Saintly ]
In the betting on the two-year-old \
event at four and a half furlongs, and
though she made a very creditable
showing, struck a snag. Saintly broke
from the rear, ran around her field and â 
won easing up from the first choice.
San Ramon finished in the show.
Kittleman Bros, tried to repeat Mon
day's turn with Myth in the mile sell
ing run. but failed. The gelding ruled i
favorite, and after making all the run- [
ning was downed at the wire by both
Bonita and Refugee, the former win- j
ning by half a length.
Bellicoso, with Thorpe up. was stout
ly supported to take the closing six
furlong selling sprint. g"ing to the post i
a 3 to 2 favorite. Breaking from the post j
first, he was outfooted to the stretch J
hy Montgomery. There the hot pace
told on the latter, which was in turn
collared and led out by Fonsovannah
In the fast time of 1:14 flat.
Track Notes.
"Squeak" Allmark. the steeplechase rider,
departed for the East last evening In the same
car which carried James Tod Sloan. On Feb
ruary 28, with a $20 piece as his bank roll to
begin operations with, "Squeak" bet the
"works" on Prlmavera, a 15 to 1 chance, and
drew down $320. Since that time he met with
a phenomenal streak of luck, taking away with
him over 18000 In hard cash.
After winning the mile and a sixteenth. Go
tohed changed owners. The hay colt was en
tered to be s.Â»ld f^r $700. and when J. F. Fogg,
the owner of Garland Bar and Cappy, boosted
him to IIOQO, Tommy Lottrldge told that horse
man to fake him.
Charley Fink was compelled to stand quite a
fubstantial "lift" after his good filly Bonlto
took the mile selling run. She was entered to
be sold for fBOO. and was bid up to $1000 by
W. H. Timmons. Charley retained her with
the cuFtomary $.">, and will also get part of the
'run-up" money back from Willie Sink, owner
of Refugee, the second horse.
And, by the way, Mr. Timmons. or "Bill." as
he is known on the far Eastern tracks. Is

causing quite a commotion In the gelling plater
brigade by his recent sorties. The feelings of
Mr. Tlmmons have become somewhat ruffled
of late by having his name connected with a
Kansas City turfman wearing the same name,
and a partner In the firm of Tlmmons & Marks.
There Is no connection between the two. Mr.
Tlmn-.ons alÃo disclaims having had anything
to do with the recent claiming of the horses
Hohenzollern and Hermoso. The Eastern
horseman is a man of means, and among own
ers has the reputation of doing things above
board In all his dealings.
Declarations in the Burns Handicap have r*
duced the probable starters to the following:
Pitsuma. Rubicon. Senator Bland. Ostler Joe,
Buck Massle, Howard Mann. Vlnctor, Salva
tion. WhÂ»el of Fortune, Won't Dance. Captain
Reeise. Fleur de Lis, Scarborough. Candelaria,
Maximo, Traverser, Fonsovannah, Morelllto,
Linstock, Marplot, Official, Dr. Marks and
Mid Glenn.
After his soul-stirring acrobatic turn on the
back of Gotobed on Monday, Dick Clawson no
doubt felt ashamed of himself, and gave bet
tors an opportunity to retrench yesterday.
Charley Thorpe has the "bumping" privilege,
and It is only a question of time when Mike
Hennessy and "Skeets" Martin will have to
look to their laurels.

DEATH ENDS
A MARRIAGE
OF A WEEK
Police Investigating: the
Strange Demise of Mrs.
Vidal Cervantes.
Remarkable Conduct of Her Hus=
band and a Woman Said to
Be His Former Wife.
Out In Laurel Hill Cemetery iÂ« a
newly made gTave. To-day the fresh
cod will be torn up and the casket re
moved, by direction of the police, for
they are working on a mystery as deep
and dark as was ever brought to their
notice.
The silent occupant of the grave was
known in life as Vidal Messa, or Cer
vantes, and the breaking into her last
home is done in order to clear away, if
possible, the mystery of her death.
Murder is the theory the officers are
working on and should this theory be
correct the case will prove one of the
most sensational in the criminal records
of the city.
The scene of the tragedyâ if such it
Is â was laid in the heart of the Latin
quarter, a localit- that has yielded all
too many such mysteries, the central
figures being people of the lowest
type.
Vidal Messa had been a familiar
figure to the denizens of Hinckley and
Pinckney alleys, both in the shadow
of the gloomy old County Jail on
Broadway. Fat, no longer fair and on
the seamy side of the half-century
mark, the woman made her home at IS
Pinckney street, together with Hans
Neilson, her companion and confiden
tial agent. H.e it was who nursed her
through many hours of suffering when
she lay gasping for breath from fre
quent attacks of asthma, while each
day he made the rounds of il*e dens of
vice that belonged to her and levied on
the occupants the tortionate tribute
demanded by his â  istress, but one de
gree removed from the shame into
which they had sunk.
Faithfully Neilson performed his
duties, and steadily the woman's pos
sessions increased. Property in other
parts of the town in less despicable
lons passed into her name and un
ceasingly grew the store of gold cred
ited to her in bank. The little '. og that
Invariably bung at her belt always con
tained Bey sral hundred dollars, while
costly Jewels sparkled on her puffy
hands and :it her deep-lined throat.
Sh'- had :i passion for costly attire,
and the closeta of her Pinokney street
home contained no less than forty-six
dresses, including heaviest satins and
brocades, and at least a dozen tri
umphs of the milliner's art.
While she suffered greatly at times
from her malady, Vidal Messa never
believed herself to be in danger and
the simple remedies supplied by her
faithful friend, Neilson, invariably re
lieved her in a. short time.
For nearly four years Xeilson had
served Vidal as friend and protector,
when to hi? astonishment one day last
month she disappeared. It was on the
21st, two weeks ago, and she did not
return that night. The following day,
however, Vidal walked into the
Pinckney-street house and announced
to Neilson that she was married â had
married one Florentino Cervantes.
Mrs. Cervantes did not appear to be
as happy as a bride is expected to be,
and later whe.i an acouaintance called
upon her she burst into tears, and said
ehe did n<>t know she had been mar
ried, that she had no recollection of the
ceremony having been performed, but
that Cervantes and some of his frienda
had induced her to drink heavily and it
was whilo she was in that condition
that the ceremony must have taken
place.
She told Neilson that they had pass
ed that nisjht at 636 Vallejo street, be
tween Montgomery avenue and Stock

"â^L^JKS' not a thing by itself,
and skin diseases are frequently not skin
diseases at all. All the lotions and bleaches
and creams and powders in the world won't
make a good complexion if the digestion is
wrong. If the stomach is sour, and the
liver torpid, and the bowels constipated,
the skin will show it. No use trying to
treat the skin for such a condition. The
only way to relieve it is to cleanse the sys-
tem ana purify the blood. As long as the .
heart is pumping impurities to every part
of the body, just so long these impurities
will show through the skin.
Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery
is good for the complexion because it
makes the whole body healthy â because it
clears and purifies the blood, makes the
digestion strong and clears out impurities
of all kinds. By increasing the ability to
assimilate nutritious food, and by the in-
fusion of its own ingredients, it enriches
the blood and bo makes solid, healthy flesh.
It fills out the hollows, rubs out wrink-
les and substitutes for sallowness a rosy,
healthy glow. There is no mystery about
it. It isn't a miracle. It is merely the re-
sult of a combination of rational, natural
common sense with expert medical knowl-
edge. It cures diseases of the lungs, liver,
stomach, bowels, skin and scalp, simply
because all these diseases spring from the
same cause â a disordered digestion and
consequent impure blood. Don't let preju-
dice and scepticism cheat you out of your
health. Dr. Pierce ' 3 Golden Medical Dis-
covery will positively cure you, if suffering
from diseases named above.

page book, "Common Sense Medical Ad-
viser." â¢Â» Address, World's Dispensary
ton street, Cerventas' friends, Including
a mysterious woman, remaining there
too. The house belonged to Vidal and
was partly furnished.
Mrs. Cervantes did not remain at the
Pinckney-street .house long, but after
instructing Neilson to continue to
watch over her interests returned to
the Vallejo-street house. The strange
wedding took place on Tuesday, and,
according to the statements Neilson
has made to The Call and Detective
Anthony, who is conducting the in
vestigation, Vidal made several visits
to the Pinckney-street place during
the week, at which times Neilson
turned over to her the money he had
collected from her tenants.
Saturday, March 26, she made her
last visit to him. She complained of
feeling very ill, and for the first time
expressed a fear that her time on earth
was short. She spoke of the woman
Cervantes kept at the house constant
ly, and said she had given her an over
dose of medicine the night before that
had almost killed her.
Mrs. c . vantes did not mention this
woman's name and Neilson could not
tell who she was more than that she
â was a Hungarian by birth and that
during the past week it had been ru
mored among those who knew all the
parties concerned that she had lived
with Cervantes and was supposed at
one time to be his wife.
Neilson endeavored to cheer up the
woman by telling her that she had often
been as sick as she was then and that
he would go up to the Vallejo-street
house that night and give her a treat
ment such as he had in the past, which
would relieve her of her suffering. He
kept his promise and noticed that while
he was in the house the mysterious
female friend of Cervantes watched
every movement he made and acted in
a most peculiar manner.
Neilson asked her what medicine she
had given to Mrs. Cervantes the night
before, and she showed him a rather
large bottle about half full of a dark
colored Hquid. The directions on the
label gave twenty to forty drops as a
dose for an adult, and five to ten drops
for a child. Neilson asked if she had
administered more than one dose, and
she replied that she had not, but that
the druggist had not filled the bottle
up.
Neilson remarked that it was not the
practice of druggists to put a small
quantity of medicine in a large, bottle,
but that thf>T used bottles of various
sizes, acording to the quantity of medi
cine, and he questioned the woman
further. Finally she admitted that she

had given Vidal about 200 drops by I
mistake, but supposed as it was a !
medicine that children could take, it j
would not harm her. The following
day, Sunday, Neilson visited Vldal
again and found her somewhat bet
ter. That was the last time he saw her
alive.
Neilson states that Mrs. Cervantes
did not remove her effects from the
Pinckney-street house, all her dresses j
and other wearing apparel as well as i
the furniture being left undisturbed. j
Early on the morning of Tuesday, ;
March 29, Cervantes and the mys- 1
terious woman appeared at: 18 Pinck- 1
ney street and Informed Neilson that j
Vidal had died suddenly at 15 minutes I
after' midnight. They brought an ex- 1
press wagon with them and proceeded j
to ransack the house, taking all the |
dead woman's '. clothes, jewelry, some 1
furniture and $20 that Neilson had col
lected the day before. Since then they
have told other friends of Vidal that

niture, but Xeilson 1b positive that they
practically stripped the house.
After their departure Neilson hurried
to the Vallejo-street house and found
preparations for the funeral already
well under way. Valenti, Mareni & Co,
undertakers, whose parlors are on Stock
ton Btreet, between Oreen and Union, had
been cÃlled in, and arranged the body
for burial. As Mrs. Cervantes was a
very large woman, they informed the
husband that it would be difficult to
secure a casket large enough that day,
and it would be better to postpone the
funeral until the following day. At
this, both Cervantes and the mysterious
female became greatly excited, and in
sisted that the funeral, must be held
that day. The undertaker said it would
cost $35 or $40 more to carry out their
wishes, but they replied that a matter
of a few dollars made no difference.
Neilson describes the action of both
the man and woman all the time he
was there as most remarkable. Both
were deeply agitated, and the woman
kept rushing from one room to tan
other, calling to Cervantes, holding
whispered conversations with him and
otherwise manifesting extreme nerv
ousness. Once, when some friends of
the dead woman called, they were
shown into the room where the body
lay, but had scarcely approached it
when the woman burst out:
"Don't you like the way it looks? If
you are not satisfied you had better
leave the house!"
Neilson notified some friends of Vidal
of her demise, among them the family
of Isaac Silva, livu.g at 737% Green
street, who had known her intimately
MRS. ViDAL CERVANTES, WFOSE DEATH THE FOLICE
ARE INVESTIGATING.
for many years. They had barely time
to reach the house before the funeral
took place, for Cervantes and the wo
man had their way and the cortege
started for the cemetery at i o'clock,
! barely twelve hours after Vidal had
I ceased to breathe.
Then the actions of the strange pair j
became more marked. Utterly disre
garding the whisperings of neighbors
and the friends of the dead woman, i
they continued to make the house at !
636 Vallejo street their home, while !
Cervantes took possession of his late |
wife's property. He visited Neilson !
and first offered him $100 if he would
relinquish all claims to any portion of
the estate. Neilson refused, and the I
sum was gradually increased to $500,
but when he still refused to make any 1
agreement with Cervantes, the latter
finally said:
"If the estate proves to be worth j
$15,000, I will give you $1000 for any
claim you may have, if it amounts to !
more I will ~ive v v $1500, and you can i
go away and enjoy your money."
Neilson declined to accede and Cer- ;
vantes finally gave up the attempt to !
purchase his claims.
Meanwhile Isaac Silva had informed I
his attorney. Archibald Campbell, of j
Vidal's death and together they went
to Chief of Police Lees, who, after
hearing the story, Immediately sum
moned r Active Anthony and detailed
him on the case. Since then the officer
has been working unc~asir.Â«?ly with the
result that the i lice are convinced
that the woman di^d under circum
stances that warrant the remains be
ing exhumed and the 'omach analyzed.
Coroner Hawk has been requested
to perform this duty and has promised
to exhume the body to-day. A careful
analysis of the stomach will be made
and as no embalming fluids were used
it is bought it will be an easy matter
to detect the presence of poison, if any
had been administered.
Cervantes lost but little time in tak
ing the necessary legal steps to secure
possession of his wife's property, for a
few days after her death he appeared
for letters of administration. He ap
peared in Judge Coffey's court last
Saturday, accompanied by the mys
terious woman. Several friends of the
dead woman were present and they
noted that this woman was decked out
in some of Vidal's finery. She osten
tatiously displayed a gold watch and
chain, for which Neilson says Vidal
paid $180, while encircling her wrist
was a bracelet that had cost $190.
One point that Neilson calls partic
ular attention to is that when Vidal
made her last visit to the Pinckney
street house she had in her bag be
tween $300 and $400 in gold. This money
was also seen by a storekeeper, for the
woman called at his place to pay a
bill she owed and when she opened her
bag he noticed the gold. She searched
for some silver, but could find none,
and finally gave him a gold pieceto
change. "^
Neilson says the woman had five
very valuable diamond rings and other
jewelry, which she usually carried on
her person. Where these are now no
body seems to know.
Cervantes' claim to the estate will be
bitterly contested by the relatives of
the dead woman, and Carmen D. Meza, !
a sister-in-law of Vidal, arrived from
San Jose yesterday for that purpose.
Besides Mr. Silva has had a power of
attorney prepared and will forward it
to Vidal's sister, who is living in Mex
ico, for her signature, and he will then
be in a position to protect her rights.
Detective Anthony was most reluct
ant to discuss the case when seen by
a representative of The Call last night,
and expressed his regret that the mat
ter had leaked out He admitted, how
ever, that he had been working on the
case for several days and that the
result of his investigation had con
vinced him that the woman had been
murdered. He would make no charge
as to who the guilty party, or parties,
were, and said that no arrests had been
or would be made until the body had
been exhumed.
On the result of an analysis of the
stomach, Anthony said, depended the
whole case. He believed that traces of
poison would be found, which would
confirm his belief that the woman had
been foully dealt with, but he could
make no move toward apprehending
the guilty party until that analysis was
made.
He could not understand why Coro
ner Hawkins had failed to exhume the
body before this, as he had been re
quested to do, but he believed the Cor
oner would take â¦hat step to-day. When
the stomach was examined, if poison
was found, the detective said he would
be in a position to act promptly.
Yesterday Isaac Silva, the friend of
the dead woman, said:
"I have been a friend of the dead
woman for many years and used to
transact her business for her. She did i
not tell me she had married, but tried
to conceal the fact from everybody. I
was told about it so-me time later, and
on last Thursday I told Attorney Archie
Campbell that I was going to bring
him a divorce suit and he said: 'Is
that so; why?' 'Well,' I said, 'Vidal
won't stay with that fellow; he has
been in State Prison.' Campbell re
plied: 'You are too late. I am going
to bury the woman at 2 o'clock.'
"I was surprised and said I would go
immediately to her house and see her.
He said: 'You have plenty of time.' I
went there at 11 o'clock. I saw a
woman and some fellow who I after
ward learned was her husband. She
was running around from one room to
another calling this man, Cervantes.
She kept asking for the hearse and
asking why they did not take her
away. I didn't say anything, but within
five minutes the hearse came and they
were ready.
"Two days later they appeared before
Judge Coffey, applying for letters of ad
ministration. While they were in the
courtroom, I had a man who was once
a guard in San Ouentin to look at the
man and he told me he was once in San
Quentin and that he thought his
brother was there now. When they
came out of the courtroom she said:
'What business have those men there?'
meaning the bondsmen. She was tremb
ling and extremely nervous. Campbell
told her who they were and what they
I were there for. They hurried away.
! Hearing there wero some relatives in
I San Jose, and feeling- that there was
[something wrong, I telegraphed to them
ion Monday to come up and they ar
rived to-day. I took them to Attorneys
j Archie Campbell a*"" Koch and they
I advised sending a power of attorney to
! Mexico for the sister of the dead wo
man to sign. Mrs. Messa, in company
with friends, called on Coroner Haw
kins and gave him an outline of the
facts of the case, and asked him to ex
hume the body to find out whether foul
play had been committed. After lis
tening to them, I understand he refused
to touch the matter, as there was not
enough evidence to warrant it. I hear
they paid him another visit to-day, but
do not know what success they had.
'I am sure there is something wrong
about this, as they told the court on
Saturday that the estate was valued
at JIOOO. Before she took the lease of
the lower place on Pinckney place she
went to see Mr. Burke of Madison &
Burke, and offered him $3500 for it. I
advised her that the property was not
worth it and she did not buy. That is
why she still has that money. That
woman must have $6000 in gold coin be
sides her jewelry."
Mrs. Erdly conducted the house in
which the unfortunate woman died.
When seen last night she related the
circumstances of Mrs. Cervantes'
death, but refused to express an
opinion whether or not the woman had
been murdered.
"I know she was madly in love with
Cervantes," she remarked, "and was
not surprised at their being married.
A few weeks before their marriage he
bought the house in which she died.
After she was taken ill he had her
removed to his house. A short time
before her death a dark woman, whose
name I do not know, visited her room
and gave her some gruel. After par
taking of the nourishment she seemed
to grow worse and in a few hours she
breathed her last.
"Whether or not the gruel was pois
oned lam at a loss to state. Since her
death I have heard mutterings that
Mrs. Messa was the victim of foul play.
"I know she madly loved Cervantes,
and frequently expressed her intention
of marrying him. If she was murdered
I do not believe he was a party to the
crime.
"I saw her a few months before she
passed away, and it seems to me that
if she had been poisoned, knowing she
was about to die, she would have told
me."
Mrs. Erdly admitted that the unfor
tunate woman possessed considerable
jewelry, but what had become of it she
could not state.
J. E. Artigues, the physician who
signed the certificate of death, was seen
last evening, and said:
"I was called in to attend the woman
two days before she died. I found her
suffering from asthma and in a bad
condition. Her heart seemed very weak,
due to her being so fleshy. She told me
she had not slept for five nights, and
to the best of my recollection I pre
scribed a sixth of a grain of morphine
powders and also my regular prescrip
tion for asthmaâ a mixture of lobelia,
iodine, potassium and belladonna, com
posed of about two drachms each. I
then left, and aboi.t thirty-six hours
later the undertaker called and asked
me to sign a death certificate.
"I refused his request, as I had only
once attended the patient. Some hours
later he returned and told me I had to
sign it, as he could not find any other
doctor who had administered to her.
I then signed the paper, giving the
cause of her death as due to asthma,
and stating that I had only visited her
once. I understand the undertaker
took the certificate to the Morgue.
"The next 1 heard of the case was
when an officer called at my office look
ing for information. I told him that I
was sitting in my drugstore when a
man rushed in and begged me to come
with him, as a woman was very low.
I went with him and prescribed. He
told me not to say anything about the
matter to any one, and I should not
have told you, but you seem to be fa
miliar with the facts.
"The medicine I prescribed was filled
at my store, but I cannot, without au
thority from the police, give you an or
der to my clerk directing him to allow
you to copy it. I know there was no
danger if the whole bottle was admin
istered to her. As to the morphine
powders, there was some danger. I
really think the woman died from a
weak heart, which was caused by
fatty degeneration."
A member of the firm of Valrnte
Marini & Co., the undertakers who
buried Mrs. Cervantes, said:
"Mrs. Cervantes was taken from 636
Vallejo street. She was about 41 years
old, and died on March 30. She died at
midnight, and being a fleshy woman,
weighing in the neighborhood of 300
pounds, her husband was advised to
bury her immediately. "Ye took her
from her home and kept her in our
parlors all the next day, and on the Ist
of April she was interred.
"There was nothing the matter with
her. I heard there was a fuss being
made by the relatives and other persons
because she had some money. She mar
ried this fellow Cervantes about three
weeks before she died. He, in my opin
ion, was a sucker. He was earning
$25 a week and was younger than this
woman. I understand he comes from
Los Angeles.
"Cervantes did not order us to bury
her immediately. A woman by the
name of Tomasso, whom I would not
believe, started this trouble. Every
thing was done according to the strict
letter of the law and this fuss amounts
to nothing."
The undertakers deny that they re
ceived money from Cervantes to place
the body of his dead wife in the grave.
Mrs. F. Habidad, an old friend of the
dead woman and at whose house the
sister-in-law is staying, when asked
what Mrs. Cervantes was worth said:
"She had about $4500 In bank, with
which she i. tended buying a house, also
a lot of jewelry." She gave the follow
ing list of jewelry as possessed by the
dead woman:
"A bracelet -with eleven diamonds,
valued at $380; diamond earrings, $150;
a breast pin, set in diamonds, valued at
$180, and another at $120; a $200 dia
mond ring, another valued at $40; an
other ring set in little diamonds, valued
at $50; a gold pin with three ten-dollar
pieces and two five-dollar pieces; a set
of earrings made from five-dollar
pieces; diamond scarf pin, valued at
$30; three men's gold watches, one
valued at $70; three ladies' gold
watches. One worn by her was worth
$150 and the chain $30. Three silver
rincrs, one set with a diamond, and a
half-dozen carved Mexican earrings and
rings; gold mourning bracelets: a man's
quartz chain, which she paid $40 for."
Continuing, she said that Mrs. Cer
vantes' son died in Mexico, and that
the only relatives in this State were
her sister-in-law and three children.
"I don't know whether she was
poisoned." she said, "but every one
says she was given something in her
medicine. Last Saturday as she
passed my mother's house she showed
me a pocket-book containing fifteen
$20 gold pieces."
Florentin Cervantes, the husband of
the dead woman, was seen in his
rooms at 636 Vallejo street last evening.
He was in deep mourning and wore a
sorrowful expression on his coun
tenance. When not being interpreted
by his friend, he would break forth in
broken English and tell what he knew
about the death of his wife.
When asked to show the medicine
that was administered to her in her
last illness he acted nervously, and
said he could not find it then, but
would produce the bottles to-morrow.
During the interview tie showed how
the medicine was given Mrs. Cervan
tes by illustrating with two glasses.
He filled one half full of water, and
taking a small medicine glass he pour-

Ed out a tablespoonful and thrusting it J
in the light said that .as the amount j
of cherry pectoral he gave. He said he ;
first swallowed it, but found it a trifle j
strong. He then poured out a smaller;
dose and gave it to his wife. She drank |
the cordial and said it was too sweet !
for her to drink, and asked him to get
some other medicine. He said that he :
then went to the drug store for |
some other medicine, and the clerk
gave him some that was to be taken j
three times a day. She found that to
her satisfaction, and was taking it up
to the time of her death.
He then went on in his own way and j
gave a detailed account of what was
done the night his wife died. He said:
"At 8 o'clock on the night she died j
she said she felt hungry. 'What do you j
like?' I asked her. and she replied, 'Hot
cakes.' "Shall I make them?" I asked,
and she said, 'No, tell the lady.' While
they were being made I took her to the
kitchen. The lady made three or four,
and she gave me one first, to see if it
was good to eat. I put butter and
sugar on it and put it on a plate, and
then cut it up in small pieces. I gave
her half and ate the other half. After
eating she said she would like one more,
and I fixed another one. I cut it up in
pieces, and ate half again. Once in a
while she would give me a piece of hers.
Pretty soon she stood up, and I helped
her to her room, and she sat down in a
chair. She said, 'I feel better, and will
be well in two days.' She also said,
'When I am not sick I will make up a
paper and give up my business to you.'
I said, 'I have mine.' She sat in her
chair some time, and other times I
would walk her up and down the
kitchen to her room to relieve her
asthma,
"About 11:30 o'clock she tell me. 'You I
lie down, as I can't sleep. During the I
last three weeks I can't sleep. I like |
to walk.' I lay down and sleep for a
little while.
"Pretty soon, about 12 o'clock, I see
my wife at the foot of my bed, and she
tell me, 'I feel sick. I think it is asthma
again.' She coughed two or three times.
I get up and take my wife to her room
and she sit down in her chair. Pretty
soon she tell me, 'I feel cold in my
hands, in my feet and neck.' She says,
'Make a hot cloth on the lamp and put
it around here.' After I do it, she tells
me she wanted to breathe but could
not. She told me she felt a big ball in
her stomach which came up to her
throat and that was the only thing
troubling her. I put clothes on her
feet and rubbed her hands. Thinking
she was bad, I tell her I will call the
people in the house, but she say, 'No,
I don't want to give them any trouble.'
I call for help by knocking on the door
and they come in.
"Mr. Adrian he went to get a doctor
but the first time he could not find one.
He tell me he ask the sergeant of police
and the officer directed him to Dr. L.e
land in the Commercial Hotel, but
when he return with the doctor my
wife is dead.
"While he was away I told him to
help quick. She began to breathe heav
ily and then she tell me to put hot
clothes on her, as she was very cold.
She has no feeling in her hand and I
rub some more. Five minutes after
she sat down. Pretty soon she tell me
'I like to lie down.' She stand up and
I tell her I will help her and she says
no. She lay down on her side with her
arm holding her head and then gave a
long sigh and die."
Hans Neilson, who for the past three
years acted as agent for the dead
woman, was seen in 18 Pinckney place
last evening. He hinted at what he
could tell, but was loth to talk on the
CASTORIA

subject, fearing that he would be shot
by Cervantes, whom he thought a daji
gerous man.
"I was employed by Mrs. Cervantea
to look after the house, attend to re
pairs in the houses she rented and do
her collecting. Although I heard of
her marrying again. I did not see her
husband until the day of her death. I
had gone up the street to buy some
groceries, and when I returned I was
surprised to see an express wagon in
front of the door. I tried to enter the
house, but found that the bolt had been
drawn on the other side. After ham
mering on the panel the door was
opened by some woman whom I had
never seen before, and she says to me,
'This is Vidal's husband and Vidal's
dead.'
"I was surprised at hearing the news,
but was more surnrised to see what
they were doing. During my short ab
sence they had taken every dress be
longing to Mrs. Cervantes and had
them tied up in a bundle. Everything
of any value was bundled up and they
loaded the things on the express wa
gon. They then removed every bit of
furniture in the house and left It in
a deserted state. With the keys that
he must have found on Mrs. Cervantes
he opened a closet and took from . t
about $20 in gold, that I was saving
for Mrs. Cervantes, to be given to her
on her next visit.
"Mrs. Cervantes was worth a good
deal of money, because I used to col
lect from $:) to $10 a night for rental of
her houses. To-night I took $9 50 to
Mr. Cervantes, which amount I have
either brought to his house or given to
him here since his wife's death.
"I learned later that Mrs. Cervantes
died at 12:15 o'clock, and they came to
the house eight hours after to remove
her belongings.
"I don't want to say anything else
about the matter, because I am not in
a position to do so."

Everybody on the schooner was anx

was down she trot into a boat and was
rowed ashore. ,
Captain F. A. Douse reports very heavy
â¢weather after crossing tlio equator in
the Pacific. He ran the schooner up as
far as 137 west longitude and then stood
northeast, but could not fetch the Gold

The Board of Harbor Commissioners at
a meeting yesterday made several ap
pointments. George H. S. Dryden, who
has for four years held the position of
wharfinger in the employ of the State
and most of that time has served at the
.Main street wharf, was reappolnted for
another term of four years. The appoint
ment of Dryden met with the general ap
proval of shipping men. He, during his
term of office that has just expired,
proved himself a capable and efficient offi
cer, and he is one of the most popular
men in the employ of the State on the
water front.
The resignation of H. W. Peterson, the
purchasing agent and storekeeper of the
board, was accepted, and James J. Flynn,
who served a term as County Clerk of
San Francisco, was appointed to fill the
vacancy. Charges had been made against
Feterson of misconduct in oiace, and
though they were disproved by the board
the accusations caused some unpleasant
ness between the official and the mer
chants with whom he had business deal
ings, and his resignation was called for.
James Byrne Jr., who for several years
has occupied the position of bookkeeper
of the board, was appointed to succeed
William L. Cole as assistant secretary
of the commission to fill the vacancy*
caused by the retirement of that official
on the expiration of his term of office.
Four boys had a narrow escape from
drowning in Oakland Creek yesterday,
and had it not been for the bravery of
Captain Johnston and Chief Engineer
George Roland of the steamer Emma two
of them would have been drowned. John
and Jerry Scott, Con Vardey and Harry
Morrisey secured a small boat and went
for a sail. When off the foot of Franklin
street the boat capsized, and Jerry Scott,
aged 8, and Harry Morrisey, aged 6, were
going: down for the last time when Messrs.
Johnston and Roland Jumped overboard
and held them up until assistance came.
The other boys held on to the bottom of
the boat, and all were eventually landed
on the Franklin street wharf. The boys
scampered away home and Johnston and
Roland returned to the steamer to get a
change of clothes.
The barkentlne Leslie D Is soon to
dock at Mission-street wharf to be fitted
out for a voyage to Kotzebue Sound. The
vessel has been thoroughly refitted dur
ing the past year at an expense of over
$SOOO. Her deck has been cut down four
feet and new stanchions placed in posi
tion throughout. Her rigging, masts,
spars, iron work, chain plates, etc., are
all new and she has been thoroughly
painted and oiled after careful calking.
â  Her rigging Is particularly handy for the
reason that aside from the foremast the
â other two are pole masts without top
masts, and consequently her rig is not
top heavy. The Leslie D carries about
100 tons of ballast, which added to the
freight of passengers of about 120 tons
..will supply sufficient and desirable bal
last. In addition to the recent improve
ments, in 1&&3 she was thoroughly over
hauled in Yokohama and all repairs rec
ommended by the surveyors there were
. made under the personal supervision of
M. A. Newell, the v.-ell-known marine
â Insurance man of this city.

Bids for Public

NOT UNKNOWN TO FAME.
Possible Territorial Differences That
May Ruin tho Chances of Some
Promising Aspirants.
The present war talk Is suggestive of
the idea that If all politicians were pa
triots the saftey of the nation might
very well be left In the keeping of Call
fornians. That is to say, there are j
; enough gentlemen who are aspirants j
to places within the gift of the people
of the State at the coming election to I
make a most formidable showing if j
drawn up In a body on the field of bat
itle.
Ideas suggested by the present condi
tion of international affairs have very
little to do. however, with the coming j
campaign and the aspirations of the j
gentlemen who would not object to
having their names appear on the State <
ticket. To consider the chances of the j
numerous aspirants partakes somewhat j
of the element of chance involved in j
making a future book on the great
American Derby. There are plenty of
entries, but a scarcity of data for the
form players. It is a question of pay
your money and take your choice.
The fact that the conditions are fa
vorable iot a Republican walk-over de
: tracts nothing from the excitement In
cident to the scramble for a place on
the winning ticket. As far as the head
of the ticket is concerned there is no
scarcity of available timber. That a
strong man will be selected there is no
i doubt, but there is a doubt, and a very
grave one, whether the man will come
'â  from the northern or southern half of
the State. Even at this early day there
Is being made a strong effort to har
i monize these territorial differences by
some sort of compromise that will at
once satisfy the meritorious claims of
the Republican leaders on both sides
erf the Tehachapi line. It is urged not
without truth, that among the leaders
; in the middle and northern counties,
i who have signified a desire to head the
ticket, there are some whose services
to the party in the past give them a
claim to present recognition that is too
I strong to be lightly ignored. On the
part of southern Republicans it may
be said that the same claim is being
made, an argument that is further
strengthened by the assertion made by
po-litlclans south of the line that the
time has now arrived when it is their
turn to name at least one of the party
j leaders. This, then, is the basis upon
' which all differences, if they can be
dignified by so strong a term, are to be
adjusted. Although no actual adva ?es
have been made by interested parties
on either side, it is generally under
stood among those who are supposed to
know that the southern half of the
State will be accorded the right to
name the Republican candidate for
United States Senator and that the
; north will select the nominee for Gov
ernor.
This arrangement, while generally
: satisfactory, will not meet with the ap
: proval of William Arthur, chairman of
: the last Republican State convention.
â  The fact that his home is at Pcjsadena
j would place him at once, territorially
I speaking, on the list of ineligibles. While
not an active and declared candidate
for the place at the head of the ticket,
j Arthur Is still one of the southern gu
, bernatorial possibilities. Should his as
1 pirations be made to suffer because of
â  any agreement such as has been out
! lined he would have plenty of compan
i lonship in his discomfiture, as there are
| others on the other side of Tehachapi
; who would not object to the nomination
for Governor on the Republican ticket.
Among these is Henry Gage, the Los
1 Angeles attorney. If present indications
are to be taken into account there is
every reason to believe that Gage will
not push his claim for recognition as a
candidate for Governor, but will take
advantage of the trend of events and
take his chances on being selected as
the man to be voted for when the next
Legislature takes up the task of elect
, ing a United States Senator. In this he
is receiving the support of Colonel Otis
through the medium of the Los Angeles
, Times. The same paper has given evi
dence of a budding desire to father the
gubernatorial aspirations of Attorney
General Fitzgerald. State Senator An
drous may be declared out of the run
ning, he being entirely and wholly sat
isfied with the position of Postmaster
| at Pomona, a political plum that is well
within his reach.
In the northern counties the crop of
would-be gubernatorial candidates
passes all belief. District Attorney
i Barnes will make a bid for the nomina
tion, and his chances of receiving it are
Bufflclently strong, when judged by
[ present standards, to make him an im

portant factor in the coming: race. Ex-
Mayor L. R. Ellert and Attorney J. C.
Campbell are also to be reckoned on as
among the strong- ones whose names
will be on the list of those Irho will
want to be at the head of the class at
the next State convention. State Sen
ator Tom Flint has a strong following,
and is openly using every means within
his power to win the coveted place on
the ticket.
Alameda County as usual Is In the
front rank as a candidate producer,
the names of Dr. Pardee and ex-Mayor
Davis being already on the list of those
who want to be Chief Executive during
the four years beginning January 1,
1899. As for either of the gentlemen
named there is at this time no better
way of designating their chances than
by saying that they are standing on
their records after a declaration of in
tention. Lou H. Brown, Secretary of
State, is Solano County's prize candi
date. He is active and confident, and
will, no doubt, so far augment his po
litical capital as to make his nomina
tion for and election to the position he
now holds almost a certainty.
E. P. Colgan, State Controller, is
also a gubernatorial possibility, and,
like Brown, having been a worthy and
efficient officer of the State government,
will probably succeed himself in his
present position. General Dickinson,
State Senator from Marin County, has
confessed a desire to lead the party to
victory at the coming election, but mod
estly hints at the possession of no more
political power than the ability to de
liver the Marin County delegation at
the convention. As the Sausalito states
man and soldier is too great a diplomat
to show his hand so early in the game
it is safe to presume that he has some
thing up his sleeve.
Poor health will probably relieve
these and other prospective candidates
of a formidable opponent in the person
of Jacob Neff. His great personal pop
ularity and devotion to party princi
ples are known from one end of the
State to the other and need no com
ment.
There remains on the list still an.
other name, that of State Senator
Morehouse, of Santa Clara County. His
repeated announcement of his designs
on the gubernatorial chair have met
with such unvarying good humor on the
part of others who have aspirations in
the same direction that his many
friends have been somewhat taken
aback by the intimation that he is will
ing to give his opponents a chance by
withdrawing from the race before it has
begun. This is done, however, without
prejudice to his soaring ambition which
now directs its flight to the nation's fo.
rum. He thinks the Senatorial toga
would not be unbecoming to him, and
to gain it he will enter the lists with
some score or more of candidates who,
unlike himself, may be unfortunate in
not having the prestige due to corpora
tion affiliations.
On the other side of the political
fence there Is no lack of public spirited
gentlemen who desire to serve their
fellow citizens in the capacity of Gov
ernor of the State. Congressman James
G. Magulre is probably the most prom
inent of these. His services to the
State In the National Legislature are
well known to all and need no repeti
tion. Amongthose who will undoubtedly
oppose him in his desire to secure the
nomination for Governor there are
those who are equally well known in
recent political history. The contest
will lose none of its interest, not to say
acrimony, because of this. Lieutenant-
Governor William T. Jeter will have a
strong following, the manner in which
he has fulfilled the duties of his pres
ent position having added much to his
personal and public popularity.
State Senator J. H. Seawell, the
Democratic warhorse of Mendocino
County, is also out for the place at the
head of the ticket. He is a power in
the Democratic fold, and his chances
of winning the prize are not worse than
those of others. H. M. La Rue, Flail
road Commissioner from Sacramento
County, is a would-be candidate, as Is
Frank H. Gould, late of Stockton, now
of San Francisco. Gould is at present
an office-holder by favor of Governor
Budd, and it may be that he will elect
to so continue, the chances of his suc
cess in securing the nomination for
Governor being at present extremely
problematical. Mayor Phelan is a pros
pective candidate, and is considered
by his opponents to be a strong factor
in the impending struggle for place on
the ticket.
The man who will ask or receive the
support of the southern Democrats is
not yet sufficiently In evidence to make
his Identity apparent at this distance
from the scene. Even should such a
man come forward, it is not thought
he would have a following sufficiently
strong, numerically, to seriously jeap
ardize the chances of any one of the
men from the bay counties. Chairman
Alford of the Democratic State Central
Committee has intimated that It would
be a graceful act on the part of his
party to secure him the Democratic
nomination for Governor, in recognition
of his long and arduous labors for the
cause. So far as known, the hint has
borne no fruit. Outside districts in
Tulare County have not yet been
heard from.
Among those on the Republican side
of the road who have by word of mouth
or through the medium of their friends
or enemies declared themselves as can
didates for election to the United States
Senate there appear the names of
Henry Gage, Code Commissioner R. N.
Bulla, E. F. Preston, State Senator
Morehouse, U. S. Grant Jr., Irving M.
Scott, M. H. de Young, ex-Congress
man Charles N. Felton and some others
who at this time are not sufficiently
prominent to warrant even a conjecture
as to what figure they will cut in the
coming campaign. Gage and Morehouse
have already been referred to. Grant
is one of the popular men of the
south land, and this, added to the pres
tige of his honorable name, makes him
one of the strongest candidates in the
field. This is particularly true when
considered in the light of a possible
agreement to select a southern man as
the next Republican Senator.
From a political point of view, much
uncertainty attaches to tie candidacy
of Btate Senator Bulla. It is generally
understood that three years ago, in or
der to win the southern votes for Sen
ator Perkins, an agreement was en
tered into whereby the promise waa
given that the next United States Sen
ator should come from the south. The
agreement is said to have been made
that Bulla was to have the place when
the time came. The time having now
arrived Bulla's friends are demanding
a fulfillment of the agreement. His
candidacy is said to be in the hands
of Collector of the Port John P. Jackson
and Billy Hamilton.
There is every prospect of a very
pretty three-cornered race between
Bulla, Gage and Grant.
If there is to be a contest
in the south there will also be
one in the north. De Young will have
the support of his own paper, the
Chronicle. Scott, whose reputation as
a public-spirited citizen is second to
none, is well and favorably known from
one end of the State to the other. Pres
ton an unimpeachable record and
is free from political leading strings,
and Felton has the prestige of his rec
ord in Congress.
On the other side of the fence every
thing depends upon the very uncertain
event of the election of a Democratic
Legislature. This grave uncertainty
has had the effect of joining the hands,
for a moment, of the men who have
designs on the Senatorial toga. Gover
nor Budd, W. W. Foote and Senator
White have temporarily buried the
hatchet and will work together for the
good o-f the cause until election day.
Should the unexpected happen and the
Legislature prove to be Democratic,
then friendship will cease and the pipe
of peace be broken. If the present pro
gramme be carried out the throat cut
ting that will ensue will result in the
survival of the fittest and the victor
will be declared Senator. In doing this,
however, the gentlemen named are
counting without Tom Clunie and
Judge William T. Wallace. Clunie is
an antagonist not to be despised, and
Judge Wallace, if he decide:, to try for
United States Senator as against a po
sition on the Supreme Court bench,
may be heard fro-m when the lists are
opened.
There is as much speculation, by the
way, regarding who will succeed to the
places on the Supreme bench to become
vacant by reason of the expiration of
the terms of Justices McFarland and
Van Fleet as there is concerning the
next United States Senator. The in
cumbents are both candidates for
re-election, a fact that will, no doubt,
lead to much searching of records be
tween now and convention time. Judge
A. J. Buckles of Solano County is said
to have avowed a desire to- wear the
ermine, providing the wish is not con
trary to the desires of the party lead
ers and the voting public. He is ex
tremely popular with men of all shades
of political belief and enjoys the confi
dence of the entire community. Be
sides a profound knowledge of the law
he has a sedate and even judgment pe
culiarly fitting to a Supreme Court Jus
tice. Judge Angellotti of Marin County
is also a prospective candidate, rely
ing somewhat upon the reputed ability
of his friend. General Dickinson, to de
liver the county delegation. Judge
Sweeney of Shasta has announced his
candidacy, as have also Judge Wil
liams of Ventura, Judge Clark of L#os
Angeles and Judge Torrence of San
Diego. None of the present Justices
are from the south, and for this reason
it is believed the convention will recog
nize the claims of at least one of the
jurists from below the line.
Some score or more of others have
been "mentioned." In fact, it would be
very hard to find a Superior Court
Judge in the State who could not be in
duced, with very little persuasion, to
accept the nomination for one of these
most coveted positions.
Tirey L. Ford, the talented San
Francisco lawyer, is said to stand in
great favor as a prospective candidate
for the position of Attorney-General.
Parris of San Diego Is also mentioned
for the place, but there is little pros
pect that he will remain in the field if
by so doing he would injure the candi
dacy of Assemblyman W. R. Guy, also
of San Diego. Guy's record in the As
pembly is without a blot, and his la
bors as chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee resulted in the sav
ing of many thousands of dollars to the
State. His present candidacy Is a pop
ular one.
Congressman De Vrles wants to suc
ceed himself as Congressman from the
Second District. District Attorney
Frank D. Ryan is also out for the
place, but his aspirations are likely to
be nipped in the bud because of his
alleged inability to secure the support
of the Sacramento delegation. This fact
will materially enhance the chances of
P. A. Buell and Judge Walling, who
are also seeking the nomination. If
present indications count for anything
A. J. Johnston will get the nomination
to succeed himself as State Printer.
While the scramble goes on among
those who are looking for a place on
the State ticket there are others not
unknown to fame who are keeping
their fires lighted In anticipation of a
few fat Federal plums that are to be
handed out from Washington In the
near future. State Senator Shine is
said to be sure of succeeding Barry
Baldwin as United States Marshal for
the northern district of California. As
to who will be the next United States
District Attorney another story must
be told. Frank Coombs, who was
Speaker of the last Assembly, is known
to have had aspirations in that direc
tion, but It is now said that he is quite
content with his recently acquired po
sition of State Librarian. Believing
this to be so others who have designs
on the District Attorneyship are leav
ing him out of their calculations. Eu
gene F. Bert may get the coveted posi
tion if he is able to overcome the oppo
sition that he must expect to encoun
ter from the friends of R. T. Devlin,
who, very naturally, would not object
to this particular Presidential favor.
After all Is said it cannot be denied
that the game, so far as the coming
campaign is concerned, is still too
young to make what racecourse critics
call a form forecast. There is still
plenty of time for the training of dark
horses, or some untried youngster may
show speed that will throw some of the
old campaigners far in the shade. It is
well within the range of possibilities
that not one of the men whose names
have been mentioned as beinsr among
those who aspire to the nomination for
Governor will be permitted to achieve
his ambition.

AN OFFICIAL'S
LIFE IN DANCER
Japanese Labor Contract
ors Hint at a Possible
Murder.
Immigration Inspector Geffe
ney Warned That He Is
in the Way.
Has Been Too Zealous in the Dis
charge oi His Duty and Must
Now Go Armed.
The Immigration Commissioner has
just discovered that there is no law on
the statute books of the United States
to punish persons who may threaten
Federal officials connected with the Im
migration Bureau. As a consequence
Immigration Inspector A. H. Geffeney
has armed himself with a Colt's self
cocking revolver and spends several
hours each week practicing at a mark.
All this flurry in the bureau is be
cause of a most bare-faced attempt on
the part of Japanese coolie contractors
! and importers of contract laborers from
Japan to intimidate him by veiled
threats against his life. Four years
ago Mr. Geffeney, at that time having
been three years in the bureau, accepted
, a glass of port wine in a Japanese
j house in this city whither he had gone
! on business connected with his office.
i The wine was one-third laudanum, and
'it came very near ending his days.
Since that time he has avoided the Jap
i anese quarter and has kept his weather
' eye peeled for squalls.
Last Friday afternoon he was work
| ing in the office, when two Japanese
called upon him. They were R. Tsuda,
who announced himself as the president
i of the Wakayama Ken Jin Kai, and K.
i Shiono, labor contractor and proprietor
of a Japanese hotel on Geary street.
i The Wakayama Ken, they explained,
was a society named after a province
in Japan and organized for the purpose
of assisting immigrants into the United
States. They spoke in Japanese, Mr.
Geffeney being the official interpretei of
Japanese for the bureau, ana conse
quently there could be no mistake about
: their meaning.
They began with a prelude to the ef
1 feet that a good many Japanese from
the Wakayama Ken had been deported
. recently through the bureau in this
city, and that this fact had greatly agi
tated Japanese in this city and origi
; nally from that district. Those indig
nant persons, they added, had been
drinking heavily of saki and their pas
1 sions were inflamed, for which reasons
Tsuda and Shiono had called upon Mr.
i Geffeney and in a friendly spirit ven
tured to warn him that if any more
| Wakayama men were refused a land
| ins: they, the well-meaning visitors,
I would no longer be held responsible for
whatever might happen to Mr. Geffe-
I ney's most respected person.
Mr. Geffeney informed his visitors
i that he proposed to do his duty unde
j terred by threats of bodily or other in
| jury- He reported the fact to Com
> missioner North, and they went to
! Deputy United States Attorney Schles
( inger and laid the matter before him.
I Mr. Schlefinger could not find any law
lin the Federal statutes to cover the
i case, and therefore the matter of the
j attempted intimidation could not be
I brought before the court.
The next day, which was last Satur
day, Tr. Geffeney went on board the
steamship Peru, where seventy-one
Japanese immigrants were awaiting
examination. While there he inter
cepted a letter which was being smug
gled on board by a Japanese employe
of the steamer Belgir. The letter was
in f he Japanese characters and was ad
dressed to one of the immigrants on
board the Peru, by name Honda Tomo
kusu. The following is a translation of
the letter:
When you are examined as to landing
and are answering the Questions do as
follows: Rf-rently men were sent back
on the ground that they wanted to len.rn
farming and would not work. Attached
to this letter is a piece cut out of a day's
issue of the newspaper which states that
learning farming is the main reason for
refusing to land immigrants. To-day a
Japanese man went to Quarantine Island.
If you answer as he tells you all will be
well. Don't you toll what you said when
you bought your ticket in Japan in ref
erence to not wanting to work. Tell this
to all carefully.

While making the examination on the
Peru Geffeney caught Y. Islukama tear
ing a paper. He seized the paper and
found that it was a labor contract sim
ilar to one published in The Call sev
eral weeks ago. Islukama placed a
twenty-dollar piece on the table and
said that his four companions would
each add a twenty, making the sum
$100, if Geffeney would allow them to
land. Mr. Geffeney reported this fact
to his superior officer and held the five
immigrants for further investigation.
Commissioner North said to a Call
reporter yesterday that if the Japanese
persisted in threatening the lives of im
migration officers Congress would be
likely to pass a law excluding the Jap
anese from the country, as well as the
Chinese.
Later In the day Deputy United

Commissioner North that the attempt
ed bribery of the inspector was an of
fense against the Federal statutes, but
that it was cheaper to deport the of
fender than to prosecute him. In case
Islukama should appeal and should be
allowed to land by a decision of the
Secretary of the Treasury he could be
prosecuted for the attempt at bribery.
The attempt to bribe was equivalent
to a confession on the part or the of
fender that he was trying to effect a
landing illegally. It is probable that
Commissioner North may adopt the
course suggested.

A young lady in New York City relates the curious case of heVsfstef
who suffered from a sort of nervous dyspepsiaâ was what the doc- .â¢
tor called it. She. despondent low-spirited, inclined to imagine all
; sorts. of things. One thing; especially seemed to be in her mind ; that
was the idea that abscesses were forming in different parts of her body.
The sister who tells the story; bed found Ripans Tabules a specific for
headache, and generally : had a supply on hand. One day, more in
joke than in earnest, she said to the afflicted one:. Try these i
{ they'll cure you." Well, she did try them, and strangely enough the
Tabules did cure her. The despondency left her. This ? was* nearly-
a year ago. She took less than a dollar's worth in all ao4 has not
take* one for over jcistit jooutbs now. .
to his client being interrogated as to
the occasions on which he had been
previously arrested. The attorney de
murred, and the Judge thereupon sen
tenced the defendant to six months in
the County Jaii.
Kellan's record, according to the
police, is a bad one. About twelve
years ago, while he was in Eureka,
Humboldt County, where he was
known as a "tinhorn" gambler, he
fatally shot a sailor, and was arrested
and tried for murder. He was in the
Scandinavia saloon, kept by Nels
Peterson, and had some trouble with
Peterson. He went to a gunshop and
borrowed a revolver. Returning to the
saloon, he renewed the quarrel with
Peterson and backed out onto the side
walk. Three or four sailors followed
him and he wheeled around and fired
at them. The bullet struck one of the
sailors in the abdomen, and he died in
two or three days. He was convicted
of murder in the second degree, and
was sentenced to twenty years in the
State prison. After serving five or six
years he was pardoned by the Gov
ernor.
Kellan returned to Eureka, and short
ly afterward married Mrs. Smith, a
widow. They came to this city, and on
October 1-9 last, while his brother-in
law was stopping with him at 21^
Welsh street, Kellan came home under
the influence of liquor and began beat
ing his wife. Her screams attracted
the attention of her brother, and he ran
to her assistance. Kellan got hold of
a monkey-wrench and struck his
brother-in-law several blows on the
head with it, nearly killing him. Kellan
was arrested for assault with a deadly
weapon, and was held to answer before
the Superior Court by Judge Joachim
sen In $500 bonds. When the case was
tried in the Superior Court on Novem
ber 10 It was dismissed, as the brother
in-law was an unwilling witness for the
prosecution, and tried to assume all
the blame for the assault.

i said conditions shall work an immedl- !
ate forfeiture of such franchise and the
road or track constructed thereunder.

Sec. 10. If at any time there shall be
any street work or improvement done,
and none of the methods hereinbefore
provided are legally sufficient to au
thorize the Board of Public Works to
make an assessment to pay for the ex
pense thereof, then said Board shall,
before it passes a resolution of its in
tention to recommend the ordering of
said work or improvement, establish
by resolution a method by means of
which such assessment shall be made;
and on the completion of the work or
improvement to the satisfaction of said
Board, or to the satisfaction of the
Supervisors on appeal, said Board shall
make an assessment to pay the ex
pense thereof according to the method
established by said resolution.
Sec. 11. In making all assessments
the Board of Public Works shall act

Sec. 12. To said assessment shall be

By virtue hereof the Board of Pub
lic Works of the City and County of
San Francisco, by the authority vested
in it, does authorize and empower
(name of contractor) (his or their)
agents, or assigns, to demand and re
ceive the several assessments upon the
assessment and diagram hereto at
tached, and this shall be (his or their)
warrant for the same.
(Date) . (Name of President of
Board of Public Works.)
Countersigned by (Name of Secre
tary of Board of Public Works.)
Said warrant, assessment and dia
gram shall be recorded in the office of
the Board. When so recorded the sev
eral amounts assessed shall b-* a lien
upon the lands, lots, or portions of lots
assessed, respectively for the period of
two years from the date of said re.cord
ing, unless sooner discharged; and
from and after the date of said record-
ing of any warrant, assessment and
diagram, all persons interested In said
a;;sr ;-;pment shall be deemed to have no
tice of the contents of the record
theieof.
After said warrant, assessment and
diagram are recorded, the same shall
ha delivered to the contractor, or his
agent or assigns, on demand, but not
until after the payment to the Board
of the incidental expenses not previ
ously paid by the contractor or his as
signs. By virtue of said warrant said
conlinctor, or his agents or assigns,
shall be authorized to demand and re
ceive the amount of the several assess
ments made to cover the sum due for
the work specified in such contracts
and assessments.
When it shall appear by the final
jur"prment of any court in this State
having Jurisdiction to render such judg
ment, that any suit brought to foreclose
the lien of any assessment for street
work made under this Chapter, or in
the recording thereof, has been defeated
by reason of any defect, error, infor
mality, omission, irregularity, or ii!e
ga'ity, thereof or therein, or in the re
turn on the warrant issued pursuant to
any Buch assessment, or in the record
ing of any such warrant, any person in
terested therein may, at any time with
in seven months after the entry of said
final judgment, apply to the Board for
arolher assessment to be issued in con
formity to law; and the Board shall,
within sixty days after the time of
said application, make anri deliver to
said applicant a new assessmsnt, dia
gram and warrant in accordance with
law, and sign, record and authenticate
the same as above provided. Such as
sessment shall be a lien upon the lots
of land set out therein for the period of
two years from the date of its record
ing, and suit may be brought to enforce
said lien as provided in this Chapter.
Should such final judgment be that of
the Superior Court for the City and
County and an appeal therefrom to the
Supreme Court of the State has been
taken, no such other assessment shall
be made until said appeal has been de
termined.
Sec. 13. The contractor or his as
signs, or some person on his or their
behalf, shall call upon the persons as
sessed, or their agents, if they can con
veniently be found, and demand pay
ment of the amount assessed to each.
If any payment be made, the contrac
tor, his assigns, or some person on his
or their behalf, shall receipt the same
upon the assessment in the presence
of the person making such payment,
and shall also give a receipt if demand
ed. When the persons so assessed, or
their agents, cannot conveniently be
found or when the owner of the lot is
stated as "unknown" upon the assess
ment, then said contractor or his as
signs, or some person on his or their
behalf, shall publicly demand payment
on the premises assessed.
The warrant shall be returned to the
Board of Public Works within thirty
days after its date with a return indors
ed thereon, signed by the contractor or
his assigns, or some person on his or
their behalf, verified upefo oath, stat
ing the nature and character of the de
mand, and whether any of the assess
ments remain unpaid in whole or in
part, and the amount thereof. There
upon the Secretary of the Board shall
record the return so made in the mar
gin of the record of the warrant and
assessment.
The Board can at any time receive
the amount due upon any assessment
I and warrant issued by it and give a
good and sufficient discharge therefor;
but no such payment so made after
! suit has been commenced shall operate,
i without the consent of the plaintiff in
j the action, as a complete discharge of
! the lien until the costs in the action
i shall be refunded to the plaintiff.
The Board may release any assess
! ment upon the books of its office on
!â¢ the payment to it of the amount of the
assessment with interest against any
lot or on the production to it of the
receipt f the party or his assigns to
i whom the assessment and warrant
! were issued. If any contractor shall
I fall to return his warrant within the
| time and in tha form provided in this
i section he shall thenceforth have no
lien upon the property assessed; but if
any warrant is lost, upon proof of such
loss a duplicate may be issued, upon
which a return may be made with the
t same effect as if the original had been
so returned. After the return of the
assessment and warrant as aforesaid,
all amounts remaining due thereon
j shall draw interest at the rate of seven
per centum per annum until paid.
Sec. 14. The owners, whether named
j In the assessment or not, the contrac
tor or his assigns, and all other per
' sons directly interested in any work
| provided for In this Chapter, or In the
I assessment, feeling aggrieved by any
! act or determination of the Board of
â¢ Public Works in relation thereto, or
j who claim that the work has not been
i performed according to the contract in
! a good and substantial manner, or
having or making any objection to the
correctness or legality of the assess
ment or other act, determination, or
proceedings of the Board, shall, within
i thirty days after the date of the war
j rant, appeal to the Supervisors, by
' briefly stating their objections in writ
; ing and filing the same with the Clerk
|of the Supervisors. Notice of the time
j and place of the hearing, briefly re
i ferring to the work contracted to be
I done, or other subject of appeal, and
i to the acts, determinations or proceed-
I ings objected to or complained of, shall
jbe published for five days. Upon such
j appeal the Supervisors may remedy
i and correct any error or informality
! In the proceedings, and revise and cor
! rect any of the acts or determinations
I of the Board relative to said work,
I may confirm, amend, set aside, alter.
' modify or correct the assessment In
such manner as to them shall seem
i just; and require the work to be com
pleted according to the directions of
the Supervisors, and may at their op
| tion direct the Board of Public Works
| to correct the warrant, assessment or
j diagram in any particular, or to make
! and issue a new warrant, assessment
I and diagram to conform to the dccl
i sions of the Supervisors In relation
] thereto.
All the decisions and determinations
lof the Supervisors, upon notice and
I hearing as aforesaid, shall be final and
'. conclusive upon all persons entitled to
| appeal under the provisions of this
â  section, as to all errors, informalities
i and irregularities, which the Supervis
| ors might have remedied and avoided;
j and no assessment shall be held in
j valid, except upon appeal to the Su
! pervisors, as provided in this section,
i for any error, informality or other
1 defect in the proceedings prior to the
I assessment, or in the assessment it
i self, where the Board of Public Works
'â¢ has acquired jurisdiction to make the
' same. \
Sec. 15. At any time after the period
i of thirty-five days from the day of the
! date of the warrant, or if an appeal
'â  has been taken to the Supervisors, then,

; peal, or after the return on the war
â  rant, after the same may have been
[ corrected, altered or modified, as here
| in provided, but not less than -within
j thirty-five days from the date of the
i -warrant, the contractor or his assignee
' may sue in his own name the owner or
the mortgagee of the land, lots, or por

i day thereafter during the continuance
| of the lien of said assessment, and re

! remaining unpaid, with interest there-
I on at the rate of seven per centum per
annum until paid.
In all cases of recovery under the
provisions of this Chapter the plain
tiff shall recover the sum of fifteen dol
lars in addition to the taxable costs,
as attorney's fees, but not any percent
age upon said recovery. When suit has
been brought, after a personal demand
I has been made and a refusal to pay
I such assessment so demanded, the
plaintiff shall also be entitled to have
and recover said sum of fifteen dollars
as attorney's fees in addition to all tax
able costs, notwithstanding that the
suit may be settled or a tender be
made before a recovery in said action,
and he may have judgment therefor.
Said warrant, assessment and dia
i gram, -with the affidavit of demand and
\ non-payment, shall be held prima facie
I evidence of the regularity and correct
i ness of the assessment and of the prior
I proceedings and acts of the Board of
i Public Works and of the Supervisors
i upon which said warrant, assessment
j and diagram are based, and like evidence
! of the right of the plaintiff to recover in
I the action. The Court in which said suit
1 shall be commenced shall have power
I to adjudge and decree a lien against
! the lots of land assessed, and to order
\ such premises to be sold on execution
! as in other cases of the sale of real
; estate by the process of said Courts.
j In all actions brought to enforce the

ARTICLE XII.
ACQUISITION OF PUBLIC UTIL
ITIES.
It Is hereby declared to be the pur
pose and intention of the people of the
City and County that its public utilities
shall be gradually acquired and ulti
mately owned by the City and County.
' To this end it is hereby ordained:
SECTION 1. Within one year from
the date upon which this Charter shall
go into effect, and at least every two
years thereafter until the object cx
i pressed in this provision shall have
! been fully attained, the Supervisors
must procure through the City Engi-
n eer plans and estimates of the actual
cost of the original construction and
i completion by the City and County of
! water works, gas works, electric light
| works, steam, water or electric power
i works, telephone lines, street railroads
and such, other public utilities as the
Supervisors or the people by petition to
j the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
cost of the construction and completion
' of water works by the City and County,
; the Supervisors must procure and place
; on file plans and estimates of the cost
lof obtaining from all of the several
! available sources a sufficient and per
manent supply of good, pure water for
the City and County, in order that
propositions for the acquisition, con
struction and completion thereof, and
the incurring of municipal indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and County as herein
after set for.th.
Sec. 2. After such plans and esti
mates shall have been procured and
filed, the Supervisors shall, at as early
a date as they may deem for the best
interests of the City and County, enter
into negotiations for the permanent ac
quisition by the City and County, by
original construction, condemnation or
purchase of such or any of said
public utilities as they may regard
most important to the City and County
I to be first acquired, and to formulate
i and submit to the electors of the City
I and County, at a special election, prop
| ositions for the permanent acquisition
| and ownership thereof.
Before submitting propositions to
the electors for the acquisition by orig
inal construction or condemnation, of
public utilities, the Supervisors must
solicit and consider offers for the sala
to the City and County of existing util
ities in order that the electors shall
have the benefit of acquiring the same
at the lowest possible cost thereof.
Sec. 3. When a petition or petitions
signed by electors of the City and
County equal in number to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
sented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the signers thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any
j public utility, and requesting the
Board to prepare for submission to the
electors of the City and County, as
hereinafter provided, a proposition for
the acquisition of such utility, it shall
be the duty of the Board to immediate
ly take such steps or to enter into such
negotiations as will enable it to formu
late such a proposition for submission,
to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
osition shnll be so formulated and com
pleted within six months from the date
of the filing of such petition. The Clerk
of the Supervisors must, immediately
upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
an authenticated copy thereof, without
the signatures, to the Board of Election
Commissioners, and another such copy
to the Mayor, together with a certifi
cate that the required number of signa
tures are appended to the original. The
Mayor shall alpo have the right to for
mulate and submit to the electors &
separate proposition from that formu
lated by the Supervisors for the acqui
sition of the utility named in said peti
tion. At the next municipal election af
ter the formulation of such proposi
tions by the Supervisors and the May
or, the Board of Election Commission
ers shall submit to the electors the two
alternative propositions. The proposi
tion receiving a majority of the votes
cast thereon shall be adopted; but in.
case the votes cast in favor of bothpropositions shall not exceed one-half
the total number of votes cast thereon,
both propositions shall bo deemed re
jected.
Nothing In this section shall be so
construed as to prohibit the Supervis
ors from responding to the aforesaid
petition of the electors requesting the
acquisition of any public utility by pro
ceeding at once, without the submission
of propositions to the electors as afore
said, to pass an ordinance declaring its
determination to acquire the same aÂ»
provided in section six of this Article
and from proceeding thereafter to ac
quire the same in the manner herein
after provided.
Sec. 4. In case the cost of any public
utility sought to be acquired under tho
provisions of this Article, can be paid
out of the annual revenues of the city
and County, in addition to the other
necessary expenditures thereof, it shail
be lawful to inquire the same by a ma
jority vote of the electors voting there
on at any special election. In submit
ting propositions to the electors for
such acquisition the Supervisors shall
epecify in such proposition the cost .of
the public utility, the proposed method
and manner of payment therefor, and
submit to the electors the question
whether the same shall bo acquired
upon such terms.
In case however, the cost of such
public utility sought to be acquired
under the provisions of this Article
shall so far exceed the annual revenues
of the City and County, in addition to
the other necessary expenditures there
of as to render it necessary to incur a
municipal bonded indebtedness for such
purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub
mitting propositions to the electors for
the acquisition thereof, shall specify
therein the amount of the proposed
bonded Indebtedness, the rate of inter
est thereon, and whether such bonded
indebtedness shall be incurred. At
least two-thirds of the electors voting
thereon at such election shall be neces
sary to secure such acquisition and to
warrant the Issuance of municipal
bonds therefor, as hereinafter set forth.
Sec. 5. When the electors by vote
shall have determined, as hereinbefore
set forth, to acquire any public utility,
such action on the part of the electors
shall be equivalent to the passing of
the ordinance by the Supervisors de
claring such determination as set forth
In section six of this Article, and the
Supervisors shall proceed without de
lay to pass an ordinance calling a
special election as required by section
seven of this Article.
Sec. 6. When the Supervisors shall de
termine that the public interest or ne
cessity demands the acquisition, con
struction or completion of any public
utility, the cost of which will be too
great to be paid out of the ordinary an
nual income and revenue of the City and
County, th>' Supervisors shall, by or
dinance, specifically declare such de
termination, and shall publish the same
for at least two weeks in the official
m-wspaper.
Sec. 7. At the next regular meeting of
the Supervisors after the publication of
the ordinance declaring said deter
mination as above set forth, or at an
adjourned meeting thereof, or not less
than two weeks nor more than four
weeks after the electors by vote shall
have determined to acquire any public
utility, the Supervisors by ordinance
shall call a special election, at which
shall be submitted to the electors the
proposition of acquiring such public
utility, and of incurring a debt for the
acquisition of the same as set forth In
such ordinance. No question other
than the acquisition, of such utility and
tho Incurring of the Indebtedness
therefor shall be submitted at such
election.
Sec, 8. The ordinance calling such
special election shall recite the objects
and purposes for which the indebted
ness is proposed to be incurred, the es
timated cost of the proposed public
utility, the necessity for the acquisition
of the same, and that bonds of the City
and County shall Issue for the payment
of the cost of the same as in such or
dinance set forth (if the proposition be
accepted by the electors), and shall fix
a day on which such special election
shall be held, the manner of holding
such election, and the manner of voting
for or against Incurring such Indebted
ness. Such election shall be held aa
provided by law for holding elections
in the City and County.
Sec. 9. Such ordinance shall be pub- I
lished daily for at least ten days in the j
official newspaper. At the expiration i
of said ten days the Supervisors shall !
cause to be published daily for not less '
than two weeks in the official newspa
per a notice of such special election.
Such notice shall specify the purpose
for which the indebtedness is to be in
burred, the number and character of I
the bonds to be issued, the rate of in
terest to be paid, and the amount of

PRODUCTION OF BESSEMER STEEL.
The Bessemer steel production In the United
States In 1597, says the Bulletin of the Iron
and Steel Association, was 5,475.315 gross tons,
an Increase of 1.555.400 tons, or 89 per cent
over lSiÂ»6. Our highest previous output was
4,&09,12S tons in 1895. At the request of steel
rail manufacturers, the association has sep
arated the production of Bessemer steel rail*
as follows: Pennsylvania, 1.U24.356 gross tons;
i.ther States, 690,018 gross tons, a total of
1,614,399 gross tons.
CONDITION OF TUB TREASURY.
1 The Wall Street News says: The part week
| has been one of Urge gains for the treasury
gold reserve, but a falling off In currency re
| ceipts. The gold reserve has increased dur
| Ing the week about $1,325,000, which is slightly
| In excess of the gain during the preceding
I week, and has Increased the reserve, which
lls now J172.350.251, nearly $5,000,000 during
i March. The treasury has received during
! March about $82,000 in gold certificates, which
is an unusually large amount in view of the
care with which they are hoarded. It Is ex-
I pected that some of the geld now In process
lof Importation will be covered Into the
| treasury and will Increase the strength of the
I Government in case of military operations.
! With a treasury gold fund of $208,740,790, in
cluding the amount held against gold cer
1 titlcates nnd a gold fund in the National
1 banks by the last report of $222,855,616, there
i Is more than $4' Â»'i. 000, 000 of visible gold upon
! which to oase public and commercial credit
! in emergen.-ies.
It Is exjÂ»>-ted that large drafts for the pur
poses of national defense will begin to reach
the Unit-'d States treasury within a short
time, as the contracts are executed which
have' been made with the large gun factories
arid other contractors. The receipts from
ordinary sources are likely to make a poor
showing if the war excitement continues, and
measure* for increasing taxation or negotiat
ing loans upon favorable terms are soon likely
i to be under consideration.
EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at station indicate minimum temperature
for the days; those underneath it, if any. the
amount of rainfall or of melted snow In inches
and hundretlths during the 1 ast twelve hours.
Isibars, <r solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; Isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lowe" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure Is high in the Interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
in summer and colder weather ir. winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

NEW TORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, April To-day's stock
market was almost stagnant, and there were
minutes at a time during the session of the
Exchange when no quotation for any stock
was recorded. Small as the total of business
was. most of It wag made up or transactions
In a few of the leading: stocks. Sugar and the
Grangers absorbing the largest proportion.
Th- dullness 'Itself was expressive of the pre
vailing sentiment of waiting and of extreme
doubt. Not only were reports very conflicting
as to what would be ; the '. tenor of the Presi
dent's message to Congress, but opinions as to
how : the message would [be received and dis
posed of differed widely. . There was practi
cally nothing left of, yesterday's sanguine. an
ticipations that a sentiment was growing in
Washington against warlike measures. There
were, In fact, significant ; reports that the
organized pressure which has been exerted on
Congress during the' last few days against
hostile measures has : rather defeated Its pur
pose . of , awakening resentment. Wall street
counted much on the .effect of these united

day's trading. . -
The money market continues to reflect the
stress over the relations with Spain as for
cibly as the stock market. Funds continue
to move to the interior for the purpose of
strengthening the reserves of Interior banks.
The proportion of reserves of all the banks in
the country have been enormously increased
in- the last few weeks, and New York has
made good the consequent drain * upon its
reserves by a â  large contraction on loans and
by heavy imports of gold from ' Europe. The
owners of money are very loth to put it out
in loans. The prevailing rates of 6 per. cent
for time money and the varying rates for call
loans are admitted to be largely sentimental
and based on apprehension of war. Gold con
tinues to come from Europe, the engagements
announced to-day amounting to nearly
13.000,000.

- W. : B. Sumner & Co.'s circular says: "The
hide market Is quiet, with a trifle lower prices.
Owing to an anticipated dry season the tan
ners refuse to buy only for* their immediate
wants and sales are small. Wet salted hides,
kip, veal and calf are quiet, with moderate
stocks on hand. Dry flint hides, kip and calf
are relatively . lower than the wet salted, as
prices on these goods are based on the values
obtainable in New York and Boston, few dry
hides being tanned in California. The values
on horse hides remain about the same, .with a
good demand. Wool and sheep skins are quiet
at lower prices. Tallow remains about the
same. Deerskins meet with ready sale, with
no change in prices."
A local wool circular says: "Until the war
scare blows over there will be nothing doing
In the wool line, as manufacturers are not In
clined to stock up until they can see an outlet
for their goods. Meanwhile holders are firm,
believing that as soon as the International dis
pute is settled the market will revive and the
accumulated stocks will gradually be worked
off. No sales to report.','. -

GALLANT SERVICE RECORD
Paragraphs Added to the Army
Regulation* Relating to the
President's Flag.
Lieutenant Colonel Wallace F. Ran
dolph. Third Artillery. U. S. A., arrived
Monday evening, rind reported at depart
ment headquarters yesterday. He came
from Fort Riley, Kansas, at which post
he has commanded the artillery battalion
for the past three years. Yesterday
Lieutenant Colonel John 13. Babcock, A. i
A. G.. adjutant general of the department, ;
communicated by wire with General
Bhafter, who is in Southern California,
and a message was received from the
general assigning Colonel Randolph to
duty with his regiment at the Presidio.
Later in the day Colonel Randolph, ac
companied by Colonel Babcock. Major
Edward Field, artillery inspector of the
department, and Major Stephen W. Groes
beck Judge Advocate, went aboard the
Government steamer General McDowell ,
and took a general survey of the harbor
fortifications.
Colonel Randolph was born in Pennsyl
vania on June 11, ISO, and entered the vol
unteer service as a private in Company F,
Beventeeth Pennsylvania Infantry. April
18 IS6I He was discharged from the regi
ment June X. IS6I. On May 4, 1861, in con- j
formity with the proclamation of the !
President, a new regiment of twelve bat- i
teries was added to the artillery arm of j
the service, and became known as the
Fifth. Congress confirmed this act of the j
President July 12, 1861, but all appoint
ments dated from May 14. on which date
Colonel Randolph was appointed a second j
lieutenant in the newly organised regi- ;
ment He was promoted first lieutenant
Of the Fifth March 1,1862; captain i of the i
Fifth July 25.1566; and on April 25. IS**. -was
Promote! major of the Third Artillery
Colon, i Randolph earned the bre\et of
capiain June 14, 1863, for gallant and mer
itorious services in the defense of Win
chester. Va.. and he was breveted major
March 13, 1*65. for good conduct and gal
lant services during the war.
His battery participated In the defense
of Winchester. Va., and occupied without
adequate support an isolated, unprotect
ed outwork dominated by a mountain to j
the west, within range. Here the battery
remained till late in the afternoon, when
the enemy opened upon it with plunging
â¦ire from sixteen guns. Many of the men
and most of the horses were killed or
wounded, and caissons and limbers blown
up. The battery was so disabled inside
of ten minutes that it became impossible
to remove the guns. Suddenly the enemy
charged with live regiments, which had
been massed behind a neighboring ridge,
in front. Nothing inside the works could
stop this onslaught, but his men stood
by their guns till the enemy had planted
Its colors on the parapet. Not till then
did Randolph order his men to fall back.
Lieutenant Randolph was carried,
wounded, into the town and fell into the
hands of the Confederates. For this
brave defense he was breveted a captain.
Colonel Randolph has served continu
ously with his regiment since the war at
posts along the Atlantic coast, all the
â¢way from Florida to Maine.

of five points, which lie in the circumfer
ence of an imaginary circle of 2 feet 9

TOD SLOAN
HAS GONE EAST
Left Last Night by the
Union Pacific for
New York.
He Bade His Friends Good-By
and Purchased a Box
of Cigars.
Predict* That Ornament Will Be a
Favorite In the Brooklyn
Handioap.
Tod Sloan has departed. Tl.Â« petite
jockey, the immaculately dressed mid
i.jt, who rode hi way into th^ affec
tions of the ultra circles of the scions of
British nobility, has left for the East,
in order that * v ~ lights of jockeydom
of that section of these grand United
Stat . may have a glimpse â¢ f him.
Last night he established himself in
an eastbound Pullman and gathered
his English-looking traps about him
and made himself comfortable for his
long journey. He eft over the Union
Pacific. He will travel as private:y as I
it is pruLible for such a distinguished
personage to do. a. 1 only a* the way
stations when the train stops for w-ter
will he get off to stretch his dear little
legs.
Tod waj very busy yesterday saying
good-by to his many friends and laying
in a stock of cigars. He purchased a |
box at the Palace and paid ;
the $6 for the twenty-five ci
gars with as much sangfroid as if he j
were buying a box of cigarettes. He
examined the brand carefully, and
made his choice with due regard for
largeness of size and blackness of
color.
Dear little Tod wore a Scotch brown
tweed - suit, and his trousers were
turned up with faultless regard for the
crease. A searchlight tie and a black j
derby, and, last but not least, a large [
sparkler upon the little finger of his
left hand compl ted his trans-Atlantic
attire.
Tod jingled the gold that he carried
in his pocket, and occasionally flashed
a handful of the yellow twenties. _ |
He expects â¦â¢Â« reach New York on j
Saturday night, and ill deci< tween !
now and then wht re he will put up. |
He will appear upc :i the boulevard on j
Sunday afternoon and attend church
in the morning.
Tod will ride for Julius Fleischmann,
while Featherst^ne and Bromley have
second call up( his services. He pre- j
diets that Omar" n* will go to the post I
in the i^rooklyn handicap a favorite.
He does not know as yet v."..at horse J
will have th^ honor in that rire of i
being guided by his small person, but
he intends to give a good account of â¢
himself.
TOD "A GOOD THING."
The Jockey Tells of Relations
With His Former Friend,
Dr. Fuller.
J. Tod Sloan, jockey and chum of the
Prince of Wales, doesn't owe Dr. Gris
wold or anybody else $250 for medical
services â at least Tod said so when un
der examination by Justice of the |
Peace Barry yesterday; and who would
dare to question the statement of so
great a personage?
Pome days ago Dr. Griswold, as as
signee of Dr. G. W. Fuller, began suit
against the jockey to recover $250 for
medical services.
The diminutive autocrat's repudia
tion of the indebtedness was sweeping |
and positive. In his deposition he ad- |
mitted that Fuller had attended him i
on one occasion about three years ago, j
but the jockey did not place a hi?h es
timate on the value of the service ren
dered. As an offset, however, he af
firmed that he and the doctor were j
close friends; so close, in fact, that the
medico came to regard him as his
banker and made frequent overdrafts !
on his account. Before his illness. Tod
stated. Dr. Fuller had borrowed $250 1 1
one time, and some time after that oc
casion he had repaid $150 of the j
amount, the jockey telling him that he
would consider the account squared
up. After that Sloan frequently visited
the doctor's office, but only in a friend
ly way to give his friend a tip on the
races, and never as a patient.
According to Sloan, the doctor at the
time had several horses which Tod des
ignated as "platers." and occasionally
he would ride one of them with indif
ferent success. The doctor frequently
visited the track and sometimes pat
ronized the books. At such times it
was his custom to borrow small sums
which Sloan never kept account of.
Their friendship continued until after
Sloan went East, a year ago. The doc
tor requested him to telegraph tips on
Eastern races, but Sloan failed to do
so, and because of that he believed the
doctor had taken offense and brought
the suit. ______^____
CYCLER MARTIN
WANTS A MATCH-RACE.
Would Like to Meet Shanick of Ta
coma â Harry Terrill Going East.
W. Martin, the Australian cycler who
is matched to ride a five-mile pursuit
race against W. A. Terrill of the Bay
City Wheelmen next Saturday afternoon
at the Elmhurst track, is evidently con
fident of victory, as he is already looking
around for further matches. In a letter
to the cycling editor of The Call he states
that he is prepared to race George Shar
rick, the Tacoma professional, a five
mile pursuit race, and will back himself
for jr>oo. the match to take place any
where Sharrick may select. Unless he
can arrange this or some other match
before the 12th instant, Martin will try
the eastern field.
Harry F. Terrill. the well-known local
professional, who has just returned from
Honolulu, exnects to go cast In a few
days, and if he is reinstated by the L. A
W. will race there, otherwise he will go
to France, where all C. A. C. C. riders
are recognized. Terrill says the game is
dead in the islands, the interest having
waned after a few race meets. Of those
who went down there from here Allan
Jones is working In a bicycle store, Dan
Whitman is working in a printing shop
and D. Lloyd Conkling is working his
friends.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 6, 1898.,
THEY WILL KEEP
THE PASSOVER
The Ancient Festival Will
Open This Even
ing.
Curious and Interesting Cere
monies to Be Followed
A Commemoration of thÂ« Redemp
tion of Israttl From the Bond
age of Fgypt.
With the setting of the sun this even
ing will be celebrated tr l opening of
one of the three primary festivela of
the Jewish faith â the feast of the
Passover. As is well known, this fes
tival commemorates the exodus from
Egypt as narrated in the second book
of the Old Testament Unlike other
Jewish holidays, the principal features
of the feast of the Passover are made
manifest rather in the home than in
the synagogue.
For days anterior to the 14th day of
the first Hebrew month Nissan, an air
of busy expectancy is noticeable in the
orthodox Jewish household. Articles
of food made with leavening materials
are gradually set aside, and the vessels
which have contained them are puri
fied. Many Jewish families possess a
second complete outfit of crockery, sil
verware and cutlery, which is used for
i the Passover alone. The day before
I the festival, that is to say, this morn
ing, all articles of leaven, bread, pastry,
! beer, fermented wines, etc., will have
I been removed to give way for regula
tion articles of diet prescribed for the
following eight days.
During the Passover the staple arti
cle of food used in lieu of bread is the
coarse, unleavened cake, whose appear
ance is familiar to every one. In the
! orthodox Hebrew communities of Eng
| land and the Continent these are pre
| pared under the supervision of spe
cially appointed officials, whose seal on
the case containing them is a guar
antee that they have been prepared
strictly in accordance with the rites of
the Jewish faith. This setting apart
I of specially prepared food is carried
! out with regard to almost every one
; of the foodstuffs ordinarily used, milk,
; cheese, butter, wines, coffee and tea
j being similarly sold under seal of rec
ognized ecclesiastical authorities.
The ceremonies to be witnessed at
the ushering in of the festival In ortho
dox Jewish houses are time-honored
and interesting, and they are derived
| from the usage of hundreds of years.
! Immediately after synagogue on the
j first evening of Passover, the master
j of the house in the pre ence of his as
sembled family invokes a blessing on
the table, which has been set In a man
| ncr entirely different to that which is
I customary. On separate plates are
I placed the shankbone of a lamb, repre
j senting the Paschal Sacrifice, some bit
i ter herbs to typify the rigorous servi
j tude of Israel in Egypt, and a mixture
i of chopped apples, almonds and various
spices, emblematic of the mortar used
by the Hebrews in building the treas
ure cities of Egypt.
The service is commenced by the
master of the house, who. Indicating to
the assembled company one of the
I Passover cakes, pronounces the for
mula: "Like unto this was the bread
I of affliction which our' fathers ate in
. the land of Egypt. Let all who are
| hungry enter and eat, and all who are
I in need enter and celebrate the Pass
; over." The better to carry out the

PRINTERS MAY
OPEN A SHOP
Strikers Talk of Starting in
Business on the Co-Oper
ative Plan.
The Fight IsÂ» Still On, and Each Side
Says the Other Is Weak
ening.
"There is no appreciable change in the
situation to-day, but if anything we are
gaining ground, as we have managed to
secure as many printers as we want."â
C. A. Murdock, president San Francisco
Typothetae.
"There is no appreciable change in the
situation to-day, but if anything we are
g-aining ground, as we have already won
over one of the offices. " â C. E. Hawkes,
president San Francisco Typographical
Union.
These two expressions of opinion tall
almost the entire story of the present
status of the printers' strikeâ each side
claims to have a little advantage over
the other, but It is impossible to conjec
ture what theoutcome will be, and botn
sides ure alike chary of expressing opin
ions. The chief topic of conversation
around the union headquarters yesterday
was the opening of a co-operative print
ing house, "we have both capital and
first-class labor at our disposal," said an
officer of the union yesterday, "and I can
see no rev-son why we could not make a
success of such an enterprise. Some time
ago we signed a contract with the label
oiiices to throw as much work as possi
ble in their hands, provided they would
reimburse us for any outlay. They have
kept up to their agreement up to the be
ginnHig of the present difficulties, and I
think we have done our share, for In the
past six months we have taken over
$111,000 worth of work away from the non
union ofllces and given it to the men who
are now fighting us. If we had had an
office cf our own we could have dona
the work just as well ourselves, and it
would have kept a great many men
busy."
An tho offices were running to-day, but
few of them had more than half the reg
ular force at work. In speaking of tho
strike yesterday, Gratton Phillips, of the
firm of Phillips & Smythe, said: "I was
the first one to accede to the demands of
the union, and I did so after careful delib
eration. I figured that 75 per cent of the
printers In the city were members of tho
union, and If a certain number of union
offices accented the nine-hour day it
would only be a question of time when
both union and non-union offices would
naturally be working nine hours the same
as they now work ten. It will be just the
same as the change from a twelve to a
ten-hour work day. Nine hours will be
come the accepted day instead of ten. I
have a larger force on now than I ever
had, and aa machinery which was for
merly idle is now busy I think I have
profited by the change, although I fully
expected to lose for a short tima at
least."
A special number of the Pacific Union
Printer will be Issued to-day giving a
lain statement of the situation, and 5000
copies will be gratuitously distributed.
GRUBSTAKED
A CLERGYMAN
Rev. C. P. Cone of Han
ford Goes to the Kotze
bue Gold Fields.
If Successful He Is to Pay Off
All the Debts of His
Church.
During His Absence th* Congrega
tion Is to Care for His Wife
Â«nd Family.
Kotzebue Is now the Mecca toward
which the goldhunters are turning. The
barks Alaska, Northern Light and Mer
maid, and the barkentines Jane A.
Falkenburg, Catherine Sudden and
Leslie D are now on the berth for the
Kubuck River region, and negotiations
are pending for a number of other ves
sels that are to be put on the route.
All the accommodation on he Alaska
and the Northern Light has 1 en taken,
the Catherine Sudden and Jane A.
Falkenburg are filling up rapidly, and
the chances are that every vessel now
on the berth will have her full comple
ment before the month closes.
Among those who have taken passage
on the Alask", which sails April 25, are
several Oakland people, viz.: C. S.
Barnard, 820 Eighteenth street; B. C.
Skinner, Sixteenth and West streets;
Robert Lee Day, the Taylor brothers,
Captain Cogan's brother-in-law and his
wife, and Mr. and Mrs. Calderwood.
Besides these there are also Rev. C. P.
Cone, Aristo Ludlow and Mr. Ricker of
Hanford and several San Franciscans,
the others being from Eastern points.
It was originally the intention of Mrs.
S. M. Martin of this city, wife of the
evangelist, to take passage on the
Alaska. Her brother, John H. Barnes
of Seattle, also intended to try his for
tune in the frozen gold fields of the
north. In fact they had paid for their
tickets, but when Mr. Martin returned
home a few weeks ago he did not ap
prove of Mrs. Martin making the haz
ardous trip at this time, and eventually
she was persuaded to give it up. When
her brother lenÂ» ed this he also gave
up the idea of going, and thus to
fully paid tickets to the Territory of
Alaska were leli on Rev. Mr. Martin's
hands.
The reverend gentleman interested
Arthur O. Garrison of the Pacific Chris
tian, San Francisco, and Rev. Mr.
Gardner of the First Christian Church,
San Francisco, in the Kotzebue Found
gold fields, and they in turn discovered ]
Rev. C. P. Cone, pastor of the Chris
tian Church at Hanford, and agreed to
grubstake him to the gold fields, pro
viding he could make arrangements to
go. His church was struggling along
under a heavy debt, and Mr. Cone went I
before his congregation, told them of I
the proposal he had received, called ]
their attention to the condition of the j
church and proposed to them that he â 
would make the trip, and if the church
would agree to care for his family, he j
would on his return pay off the church
Indebtedness in the event of his "strik- ;
ing pay dirt."
The congregation accepted the offer
and the Rev. C. P. Cone signed arti
cles with Messrs. Martin, Gardner and
Garrison, agreeing in consideration of
$700, to proceed to the gold fields men
timed, and to pay to his three grub
stake partners one-half of all gold or
other ore secured during the year 1898,
and such portion of 1899, or longer, as
he deemed expedient to remain.
B. C. Skinner of Oakland, a member
of the First Christian Church of this
city, later signed articles with S. M.
Martin to the same effect, and C. S.
Barnard, also a member of the First j
Christian Church of Oakland, signed |
with Mrs. Martin a few days ago, mak-
Ing three Kotzebue Sound gold-seekers
in whom Rev. S. M. Martin is inter
ested.
C. S. Barnard Is a contractor and
builder and was a candidate for Oak
land's City Council in 1897 on the Popu
list ticket. B. C. Skinner Is a skilled
machinist.
Mrs. S. M. Martin will likely make
the trip a year from ->w if the above
mentioned partnership proves a finan
cial success.
Captain Cogan has been in Kotzebue
Sound many times and he says that
the half has not been told of the gold
to be found there. He says he has
never yet made a trip to the Kubuck
River region but what Indians have
visited his vessel with quantities of
gold nuggets, eager to trade for needles,
knives, scissors, rifles, tobacco, etc. The
squaws use the needles and scissors in
making furs for sale to prospectors, and
all the passengers are supplying them
selves with these articles that they
may secure cheap equipments.
On the barkentine Catherine Sudden
a party of twelve San Francisco boys
have secured accommodation. They are
going to take along their own steam
launch and will thus be able to pros
pect all the tributaries of the Kubuck
River.
YOUNG GIRLS
HIS VICTIMS
W. H. Doggett, a Cook, Ar
rested on the Charge of
Abduction.
The Polieo Say That Â» More Serious
Charge Will Be Preferred
Against Him.
W. H. Doggett, a cook 39 years of age,
was arrested yesterday afternoon by De
tectives Anthony and Dillon and booked
at the City Prison on a charge of ab
duction, but a more serious charge will be
preferred against him.
Last Thursday Mrs. Rest, 730 Howard
street, inserted an advertisement in one
of the papers for some light housework
for her daughter, Rachel Costley, a
bright jdrl, between 13 and 14 years of
age. Doggett answered the advertise
ment, and on the girl calling upon him
the following day, he told her that his
sister, who had a farm in the country,
wanted a girl to assist her with her baby
and to do a little housework.
He took the girl to the Stockton boat
and kept her In a house In Stockton a
close prisoner. Yesterday morning the
girl escaped from the house and hurried
to police headquarters, where she notified
Chief Gall of her position. He at onco
telephoned to Chief Lees, and Detectives
Anthony and Dillon were detailed on the
case.
After Doggett found that the girl had
escaped he came to the city and called
upon her mother, asking her if she had
returned. Mrs. Rest made an appoint
ment with him to call in the afternoon,
and hurried to police headquarters, where
she was advised to swear out a warrant
in Judge Conlan's court for his arrest.
She did so. and when he called in the
afternoon the detectives arrested him.
The girl will be brought from Stockton
this morning.
The police say that Doargett has been
at the same business for some time, and
they expect to bring other charges
against him.
WORKMEN IN
GRAND SESSION
The Twenty-First Annual
Meeting of the State
Body.
Reports of the Officers Show
Remarkable Growth in
the Order.
Thow Will Be Â« Contest To-Day
Over the Election of Grand
Master Â»nd Grand Recorder.
The Grand Lodge of the Ancient Order
of United Workmen of the jurisdiction of
California met yesterday morning at 10
o'clock In twenty-first annual session, all
the grand officers present except the
grand foreman, whose death in Los An
geles a short time since has already been
noticed.
The grand officers present were: Wil
liam Vinter, grand master workman;
George H. Bahrs, grand overseer; D. S.
Hirshberg, grand recorder; Samuel Booth,
grand receiver: J. M. Collins, grand
guide; James Popert, grand inside watch
man; J. D. Nield, grand outside watch
man; Frank S. Poland, deputy grand
master workman; Dr. J. L. Mayon, grand
medical examiner; Edwin Danforth,
grand lecturer.
After the Grand Lodge had been called to
order by the grand master workman, the
report of the committee on credentials
was presented and the representatives
seated, after which the grand master ap
pointed lor the session Grand Overseer
Judge George H. Bahrs grand foreman,
vice Mackay deceased, and Past Master
E. F. Joy of Valley Lodge No. 30, grand
overseer.
The Grand Lodge degree was conferred
on about 150 past masters, who were en
titled to receive it, and the journal of
the previous session was adopted.
Past Supreme Master Workman W. H.
Jordan, and Past Masters J. A. Colqu
houn, C. H. Kile. W. h. Fiske, C. F.
Gompertz and O. Whipple, who were rep
resentatives to the first Grand Lodge that
met in 1577, and are the survivors of that
body, were introduced by Grand Guide
Collins. They were welcomed by the
grand master workman, and an addresa
delivered by Past Grand Master William
Henry Barnes, and the response was
made by Past Supreme Master Jordan.
The reports of the grand officers, a syn
opsis of which appeared in The Call of
yesterday, were presented and referred to
proppr committees. These, as already
stated, show a remarkable growth in the
order since the previous session.
During the afternoon session a number
of resolutions, none of a very important
character, were introduced and referred.
The report of the committee on laws
was adopted with the exception of one
recommendation relative to amendments
of the constitution of the Grand Lodge
and subordinate lodges by a two-thirds
vote. A proposed amendment to reduce
the salary of the grand recorder was de
feated.
The report of the grand medical examl
! ner was also adopted except one recom
mendation, which was that the minimum
I fee for examinations be fixed at $2. This
I was left to the subordinate lodges to lix.
The Grand Lodge rose at 5 o'clock.
This afternoon the grand officers for
! the current year will be elected. The con
tests will be for grand master workman
and for grand recorder. For the former
! position William VinteV Is a candidate
i for re-election for a third term and his
I opponent is Judge George H. Bahrs, while

dates are: Frank S. Poland, deputy grand
master workman; Past Masters John
Hoesch of Magnolia Lodge, F. H. Carr of
Nevada City. W. J. Hawkett of Oakland
and J. H. Camp of Valley Lodge. There
has been a great deal of pressure brought
to bear on Grand Recorder Hirshberg to
name his successor, but he has positively
declined to do so, not â wishing to preju
dice the representatives in favor of any
one of the candidates.
To-night a drill team will exemplify the
work of conferring the degrees before the
representatives.
Unity Lodge gave an anniversary enter
tainment and ball last night in B. B.

ed. There was an attendance that crowd
ed the hall and gallery. The programme
included a soprano solo by Miss Anneta
George; specialties, Mr. Cathcart; recita
tion. Miss Elsie Duncan; vocal solo, Rob
ert Duncan: specialties. Waterman sis
ters, and addresses by Grand Recorder
Hirshberg and Past Grand Master
Barnes. Dancing followed.
