OBJECTIVE
ON BOARD THE HERALD-CALL DIS
PATCH BOAT ALBERT F- DEWEY, OLD
BAHAMA CHANNEL, May 25 (via \zy West,
pla., May 26). â Judging from the recent
movements of Admiral Sampson's fleet
tbe United States naval authorities no
longer have any anxiety concerning tf)e
Spanish Cape Verde squadron. After a
game of hide and see^ along tfye northern
coast of Cuba, wtycb consulted several
days, th>e prows of tfye flagship New Yor^
and her consorts arz again turned west
ward, presumably to threaten Havana, or,
perhaps, to taKe a prominent part in trje
long-delayed invasion of Cuba.
That Admiral Sampson should turn
back at this .seemingly critical juncture
indicates that, Admiral' Cervera" has
helped our navy out of its dilemma by
putting himself into a neat pocket at
Santiago de Cuba and handing the key
to Commander Schley. At any.rate.the
most formidable danger yet "met by the
United States naval forces in this war
has apparently come to an end for lack
of an object.
Admiral Sampson has massed a pow
erful fleet, to crush the enemy. only to
learn that the enemy has kindly
crushed himself. The cruise of Samp
son's fleet has already occupied ' six
days, including the time occupied in
getting our ships together. , As the sun
rose on Monday the wind abated some.
Ten miles off Havana. early Monday
morning a cluster of spars and smoke
indicated the whereabouts of the fleet.
As the Dewey approached we could
make out the New York, Indiana and
nearly all the gunboats on the -Havana
blockading station. The monitors had
disappeared. The cruiser Montgomery
had come up from Key West and Com
modore Watson had transferred his
pennant to her from the Mayflower.
After long continued signaling the New
York about 11 o'clock turned and head
ed eastward along the coast. The In
diana, fell in just behind and then the
Mayflower, Newport, Vicksburg and
I Wilmington.
â¢ Slowly the line of warships steamed
along with the Dewey in their warke.
Cojimar was passed, then Matanzas and
then Cardenas light was given a wide
berth to the south. At Carders, a big
black cruiser came cracking along
from the northwest and joined the pro
cession. It proved to be the New Or
leans, just from the north. She was fol
lowed by the gunboat Machlas. At last
the fleet was off on its mission in the
teeth of a gale, which covered the
decks with spray. During the night,
(which was another stormy one, the
\ Dewey lost sight of the fleet. No lights
were shown, and we were warned not
to come too near. When dawn of Tues
day came not a ship was In sight, but
about noon the entire fleet was made

! come up with the monitors Puritan and
| Mlantonomah, which had been sent
j ahead owing to their slow speed, and
the torpedo boats Ericsson and Rod
gers. This force was soon augmented
by the arrival of the cruisers Mont
gomery and Marblehad, and it began to
look like a real fWt, bent on real busi
ness. On Tuesday afternoon the big
schooner Supply Joined the fleet, and
several hours were passed in distribut
ing provisions among the various ships.
Night had again fallen when the fleet
moved on eastward. Just at dusk the
gunboat Wasp came up from the west
and delivered dispatches to the admi
ral. As the fleet moved eastward red
and white signal lights suddenly
flashed from the signal vqxd of the
New York, and all the other vessels
immediately answered. As the war
ships rocked gently on th" swell of the
waves the signal lanyards swayed
gracefully with their strings of con
stantly changing liglit*. The intense
gloom seemed accentuated by the flag
ship's electric signals and nothing of
the vessels could be seen except the
waving lanterns. L,ike fiery specters
of the night they moved away on the
scout for the Spanish fleet. Gradually
the lights winked their mysterious
message and went out and then there
was left not a trace of the fleet.
All Wednesday morning the fleet
lopped along to the westward, idly re
tracing its path. The position was at
the junction of old Bahama and San
taren channels, and seemed well
chosen to intercept an enemy who
sought passage to the Atlantic coast
of the United States. The morning
passed, in this manner, the fleet not
moving more than five knots an hour.
The cruiser New Orleans about noon
deserted I her .'â  place with the flying
division and went alongside the New
York. After an interchange of signals
at close range the New Orleans turned
and soon disappeared eastward, going
at a sixteen-knot gait. Shortly after
the Vesuvius steamed ahead -in the di
rection of Key West/after taking some
dispatches from the . flagship. The mo
notony of the afternoon was broken by
the arrival of the monitor Amphitrite
in tow of the transport Panther. They
turned and followed the fleet westward
along the Cuban coast. When the

SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, MAY 27, 1898.
MAY SAIL
FROM CADIZ
TO MANILA
NEW YORK, May 26.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Spain's
Embassador at Paris has informed the
French Minister for Foreign Affairs
that Manila is the prospective destina
tion of the squadron mobilizing at Ca
diz. From an official source in France
this report was received by the au
thorities to-day. The statement was
coupled with the announcement, how
ever, that the information was laid be
fore the French Minister by the Spanish
Embassador under instruction from the
Ministry which recently went out of
office, and that as the new Ministry
was leveling considerable criticisms at
the work of its predecessor, the plan as
the authorities here were informed may
have been changed.
In any event, according to informa
tion received, it is extremely doubtful
if the fleet can be got in a condition to
sail under another week, and probably
longer time will be necessary to put it
in satisfactory condition.
The machinery of several vessels is
Deported to be out of order on account
of lack of skilled men. The battery of
the armored cruiser Carlos V is also not
in satisfactory condition. Workmen are
employed day and night in making the
necessary repairs, and every effort is
being made to get the ships away from
Cadiz as quickly as possible.
Naturally the report that the Spanish
Government h^d informed France that
the destination of its fleet was Manila
was the cause of some comment in of
ficial circles, but until further informa
tion comes regarding the decision of the
new Ministry the authorities do not
propose to waste very much time in
worrying over the matter.
In view of the bottling up of the
Spanish fleet in the harbor of Santiago
de Cuba the authorities say that it
would be absurd for the Spaniards to
send their reserve squadron to the far
east and they believ^ their plans will
not be carried out notwithstanding the
information was given to the French
Government. The action at Spain in
keeping France informed of the move
ments of her fleet aroused a good deal
of suspicion, and it is believed to be
indicative of good relations existing be
tween the two governments.
With the Monterey and the Charles
ton attached to his fleet, Rear Admiral
Dewey, it is believed, will be able to
take care of the Spanish squadron if
sent against him, and meantime the
SCHLEY'S SHIPS IN CIENFUEGOS HARBOR.
KEY WEST, May 26.â Five ships of Commodore Schley's squadron entered the har
bor of Cienfuegos on Tuesday and steamed all around it without drawing the fire of any
Spanish battery. Then the warships filled their bunkers with coal.
This news was brought here by a torpedo-boat, which came to Key West from
Cienfuegos at full speed, bringing dispatches from the Commodore, On the day before en
tering Cienfuegos harbor the fleet established communication with the insurgents, for
whose use 30,000 rounds of ammunition were landed. The insurgents were found in need
of shoes, and thirty pairs were contributed to them by the American sailors.
authorities will send a naval expedi
tion to bombard the Spanish town.
Within the next few days it is ex
pected that an effective move will be
taken to drive the cork into the bottle
in which Cervera's men-of-war are lo
cated and whose mouth Is being
sharply watched by Schley, and the
taking of such action will result in
placing at the disposal of our Govern
ment a fleet of armor-clads which could
be dispatched to Spain before the
Cadiz squadron could get through the
Suez canal.
GIBRALTAR, May 2>>.â The warships
at Cadiz, forming Spain's reserve
squadron, under command of Admiral
Camara, are busy testing their guns
and machinery preparatory tv their de
parture from that port. Their destina
tion cannot be ascertained. Larg>.
quantities of coal continue, to arrive at
Cadiz.
MADRID, May 26.â 1t is currently re
ported here this afternoon that the
Spanish Government has ordered all
the steamers of 1000 tons up, capable
of making a minimum of twelve knots
an hour, to be impressed as auxiliary
cruisers. The Spanish Commissioners
at the varinus points. It is added, have
been instructed to take charge of such
steamers, whether mailboats or other
wise.
PROHIBITS THE
EXPORTATION OF ARMS
Copyr!frhtÂ«Â»<3, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
HONGKONG. May 26.â Acting for the
British Government, Governor Sir Hen
ry A. Blake issued to-day in the Ga
zette an extraordinary decree prohibit
ing for six months, from May 28, the
exportation from the colony of arms,
ammunition, gun powder or naval and
military stores, unless by special per
mission, granted under local ordinance.
This Is a continuation of the procla
mation issued on November 25, last,
owing to the importation into China of
supplies from Hongkong for secret so
cieties. It has no special significance
in regard to the Spanish war, but it
will hamper the Philippine insurgents
in obtaining supplies.

BATTLE-SHIP OREGON
WILL FIRE THE FIRST
SHOT AT OLD MORRO
While Schley Holds Cervera's Fleet in
Check Sampson Will Begin
Active Hostilities.
CALL OFFICE, RIGGS HOUSE, WASHINGTON, May 26.â Now
that the Administration is fully convinced that Commodore
Schley is in a position to keep Cervera's fleet locked up or to
destroy it, Admiral Sampson is to be directed to begin at once
the bombardment of the fortifications that protect the harbor
of Havana. Simultaneously a force of 25,000 or 30,000 men
will make a land attack upon the Cuban capital. Only the capture
of the Cuban capital, either by surrender or reduction, will put an
end to the siege.
These details of a new plan of campaign were decided
upon to-day at the White House during a council of war, in
which the members of the Naval War Board, Secretary Alger,
Secretary Long and General Miles participated.
A dispatch was received to-day from
Hayti, stating that the Spanish fleet
had left Santiago and had gone to
denftwgoa. It was reported in Wash
ington that the War Board was sum
moned to the White House immedi
ately upon the receipt of this cable
pram, and that our naval plans were
completely upset.
It was very apparent that important
news of some kind had been received
from the West Indies, for General
Miles and the War Board were hur
riedly summoned by telephone. It is
said "to-night, however, that if there
was at any time to-day a disposition
at the Navy Department to credit the
Haytian report later advices must have
been received, for this evening there is
the same confidence manifested that
there was yesterday. Naval experts
declare that it would have been impos
sible for Cervera's vessels to have elud
ed Schley, and that they could not have
sailed before his vessels arrived before
the harbor without being observed by
our scouting cruisers, three or four of
which were patrollng the south coast
of Cuba, between Cienfuegos and San
tiago.
The War Board's confidence that
Cervera is imprisoned in the harbor is
best shown by the fact that at the
White House conference to-day a
hydrographic chart of Santiago har
bor was exhibited. This showed that
the narrowest point in the channel,
near the harbor's mouth, is less than
one-sixteenth of a mile in width, while
there are only five fathoms (thirty
feet) of water, there being barely a
sufficient depth to accommodate the
passage of a modern man of war draw
ing 27 feet. This is between Estrella
battery on the east side of the harbor
and Canovas Point on the west side,
and is only a half mile from the open
sea. It would, therefore, be possible
for one or two of our battle-ships
standing out to sea to prevent the en
emy's egress.
This having been settled to the satis
faction of all present it was decided to
push the Cuban military expedition.
Different reports seemingly reliable
have for the laÃt day or two located
Admiral Sampson's squadron off Ha
vana and before Santiago; but the
truth probably is about half way be
tween these c: tremes. He was known
to have sailed east from Havana on
Monday morning and the supposition
was that he sailed south through the
Windward Passage and joined Schley
at Santiago.
It appears now that he has been
cruising in the old Bahama channel, off
the northeastern coast of Cuba, where
he could be within easy sailing dis
tance of either Havana or Santiago
and at the same time intercept Cer
vera's squadron should it by any pos
ptble means elude Schley and strike
for our Atlantic seaboard.
But now that Schley has
the hostile fleet locked up,
Sampson will return to Ha
vana and immediately com
mence the bombardment of
Santa Clara and Morro Cas
tle batteries. By the time
they are reduced the 25,000
or 30,000 trooDS now ready
for embarkation will be
landed in Cuba.
It is believed there will be no im
mediate invasion of Porto Rico. It was
at first suggested that Sampson while
in the Bahama channel should be di
rected to return to San Juan and com
plete the work he was engaged in when
the presence of Cervera's fleet in West
Indian waters called him hurriedly
home to mobilize.
It was argued that Spain would not
send her reserve fleet across the At
lantic with Cervera's locked up and her
only remaining base of supplies (San
Juan) destroyed. This plan may yet
be adopted, although at the White
House conference to-day it was agreed
that it would be better to mobilize as
large an army as possible in Cuba with
out sparing any troops for Porto Rico
at this time. This would leave San
Juan open for the reception of Spain's
reserve fleet, and it was argued it, too,
might possibly be locked up.
A naval officer said to-night: "It
would be strange indeed if after an
nihilating Montljo's fleet at Manila and
bottling up Cervera in Santiago we
should succeed in imprisoning Admiral
Camara also."
A report reached Washington to
night from Key West that a vessel ar
riving there had heard heavy firing in
the vicinity of Havana. It is not prob
able that our blockading vessels would
begin a bombardment until Admiral
Sampson returns.
Besides it is understood
here that the Oregon will be
allowed to fire the first shot
at Morro Castle when the
bombardment begins as a
reward for her gallant cruise
around the Horn.
At last accounts the big battleship
had arrived at Koy West from Jupiter
Inlet, Fla.
ADMIRAL CERVERA
IS SURELY TRAPPED
There is No Possibility of the Es
cape of the Fleet From
Santiago.
"WASHINGTON, May 26.â Naval on
cers are now turning their attention to
inquiries whether it is possible for Ad
miral Cervera to get out of Santiago
harbor. They hold that this maneuv*f
is impossible, and being so, the career
of the Spanish admiral is at an end,
so far as it constitutes a menace
against our ships. The British com
ment that Admiral Hornby, In 1855, had
escaped with his entire fleet from a har
bor under similar conditions, and that
Admiral Cervera should b^ able to make
his escape when he gets ready to lo Â»o,
is not accepted. The naval view here
is just the contrary. It is pointed out
that Admiral Hornby escaped from an
open bay, while Admiral Cervera must
come through a channel about 300
yards wide, on which the American
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
searchlights will play constantly. It Is
said that this is not mere conjecture,
but that naval maneuvers were car
ried on at Key \Ve<n and Tnrtugas a
few months ago which furnish a posi
tive demonstration that Admiral Cer
vera cannot make an exit without be
ing discovered.
An officer who was on board one of
the American ships during- the Tortu
g-as movement says a sham night at
tack of torpedo-boats was made upon
the big battle-ships and cruisers. The
latter were given no notice of the pro
jected attack and there were no extra
guards such as the American ships
now maintain. Hut .-very torpedo-boat
engaged in the attack was discovered
long before it was within striking dis
tance of the cruisers and battle-ships.
One of the attacking torpedo-boats was
so bewildered by the searchlights that
it nearly ran into a cruiser.
The lesson drawn fmm this attack
was that a sally by the enemy was im
possible, owing to the modern methods
of discovering an approach. It had
shown also that the attacking fleet
could not get within range, although
they had come with the range of the
guns of the ships attacked. It is said
that these maneuvers at Tortugas and
Key West practically represent the sit
uation before Santiago. If Cervera sent
out his torpedo-boats as scouts they
would be detected before they had done
any damage and destroyed by the
small gunboats. The American ships
would have the advantage of concen
trating their entire fire upon one small
passage. c
A night battle is quite unusual In
naval annals, but it has occurred. The
Constellation fought the Revenge at
night, the engagement continuing for
six hours in the darkness, during which
the main mast of the Constellation was
carried away and the ship crippled. It
is believed that if Admiral Cervera at
tempts to escape he will choose the
night for this movement.
On the other hand naval officials are
discussing the means the American
commander may adopt to make exit im
possible. In the blockade of Charleston
barges full of stones were sunk at the
channel entrance, cutting off ingress
and egress. A few old hulks would
serve the same purpose in the present
case. There is difficulty in getting such
old craft and the sinking of derelicts at
proper points in the cnannel would be
attended with great danger. They
must be towed to position, subjecting
those in charge to the danger of mines
â¢and torpedoes. There is also the guns
of Morro Castle to be guarded against.
It Js understood, however, that Morro
Castle has no searchlights, so that a
night operation of this character could
be executed without the Spaniards be
ing made aware of it. Taking every
thing into account naval officers feel
that Admiral Cervera committed a
fatal blunder in being trapped at San
tiago and that there is no fear the trap
will prove inadequate to hold the Span
ish warships^
AMERICANS MUST
HAVE PATIENCE
If They Desire a Naval Battle Before
Invading Cuba, So Says
Sagasta.
NEW YORK, May 26.â A Madrid dis
patch states that Ragasta says there
will be no tight at Snntiago unless Cer
vera desires it. The Americans will
find the Santiago forts and ships wry
different from those destroyed at Ma
nila. If the Americans are waiting for
a naval battle before attempting to in
vade Cuba they will need, he says, con
siderable patience.2

' There is do use landing troops around

supplies around that city. The base
is already cut off."
This statement was made to me to
day by an officer of the army whose
acquaintance with the disposition of
the insurgents in Cuba is accurate an.l
to be rvlied upon.
"The provinces of Puerto Principe
and Santiago de Cuba are," continue!
this officer, "practically occupied by in
surgent forces. The bulk of the Span

westward and Puerto Principe is now
so wholly the territory <>f insuwnt.j

is true that there are now Spanish
troops at Manzanillo and there are a

extreme east end of the province. But
this about sums up Blaneo's forc?s in

day for San Francisco, on their way to
the Philippines. The eight companies
are largely from the National Guard
and are well drilled. They have been
in Fargo for a month and are weil up
on battalion formations.
WASHINGTON, May 26.â The work
of mustering the volunteers into the
service of the United States under the
President's first call for troops Is prac
tically completed. Adjutant General
Corbin announced la'e to-night that the
number of volunteers so far reported
mustered was 118,000 and that enough
were prepared for muster to swell the
number to between 121,000 and 122,000.
It is not expected by the War Depart
ment officials that quite the full num
ber called for will be mustered into the
army, as nearly all of the States are
short from 25 to 100 men of the number
called for by their quota. lowa is still
short about a thousand men of its
quota and two or three of the Southern
States have not completed their muster,
but the small gap remaining- will be
filled in a day or two.
The regulations for the organization
of the brigade of engineers and the ten
regiments of immunes authorized by
separate act of Congress were to-day
formally agreed upon by Ceneral Miles
and Adjutant General Corbin. Re
cruiting will begin promptly, with a
view to the utilization of the men in the
army of occupation of Cuba, The
brigade of engineers is to be comprised
of three regiments to be designated
United States Volunteer engineers.
There are to be three battalions in each
regiment of four companies each. For
each regiment there are to be fifty
three commissioned officers and 1106 en
listed men. The officers will be selected
for their skill aa rnint.Â«.rv. civiJ electri
they are admirably and effectively
armed, and the block houses are furthor
protected by barb-wire entanglements
that are almost insurmountable. This
is the general situation as far as San
t>ago is related respectively to the pos
sibility of Spanish succor and possi
bility of insurtTcr t interceptiou.
"Now, to be more specific, I may
say that General Garcia has his head
quarters at Bayamo, an interior town
almost due east of Manzanillo, between
Manzanillo and Santiago. It cannot be
said that the insurgents are compactly
organized in a semicircular line around
Santiago, but I do not hesitate to say
that in the province of Santiago de
Cuba there are now as many as five
insurgent forces. It is clear, therefore,
though the line is not a continuous one,
the insurgents could be localized at
any point without delay, and it is quite
reasonable to say that the report of
any sensational movement on the part
of the Spanish force in Santiago would
be sent to them by the little railroad
that runs not very far northward from
Santiago. The estimate of 18,000 for
the whole Cuban army is a liberal one,
but that does not affect the present al
most complete occupation of Puerto
Principe and Santiago de Cuba by in
surgents. As I said before, the Spanish
base of supplies at Santiago is practi
cally cut off. Unless Cervera gets out
of the harbor he will starve there. That
is the land side of the situation. The
distance between Havana and Santiago
de Cuba is 600 miles, with the Span
iards in the extreme west and almost
insuperable streams and mountain
roads between.
"To sum up briefly, Santiago is con
fronted on the sea by the American
fleet and in the interior is cut off from
all possibility of supplies by the in-
Eurgents."

Volunteer engineer troops will be

be organized into regiments, half of
whom will be composed of whites,

CHICKAMAUGA NATIONAL, PARK,
May 26.â Including to-day's arrivals,
there are now 42,000 men encamped at
the park. The Ninth New York, Col
onel James Greene commanding, ar
rived early this morning. There are
iOIO men In the regiment. The Second
Kentucky Regiment reached the park
at 7:10. This command numbers 1030
men and is commanded by Colo-nel E.
H. Gaither.
To-night Troops A, C and D of the
Third Volunteer Cavalry, Colonel
Grigsby commanding, arrived from the
Black Hills region of South Dakota,
under command of Major French. The
three troops numbered 225 men.
Later to-night the Sixty-ninth New
York, the First Arkansas and the Fifth
Missouri regiment arrived. The vari
ous commands are beginning military
life in earnest. All the regiments that
are permanently encamped were given
regimental drills to-day, and this will
be continued from day to day.
The reports of disaffection among
the Missouri troops arise from dissatis
faction growing out of the inadequate
water supply, but htis will be remedied
as the completion of the pipe lines will
afford abundance of water to the com
mands. The troops also complain of in
sufficient equipment, having received
no uniforms or arms from the Govern
ment since being mustered into the
Federal service. Sixty carloads of ra
tions arrived to-day from Chicago and
northern cities.
CHICAGO, May 26.â Reports from
various Northwestern States indicate
that President McKinl^y's second call
for volunteers, asking for 75,000 men,
will meet with hearty response. Inde

ized in many States and these will be
offered to the service of the country.
NEW YORK, May 26. âThe battery of

will be made up of six Hotchkiss rapid
fire guns.
TAMPA, Fla., May 26.â The forma
tion of all the regular and volunteer
troops massed in Florida into corps,
divisions and brigades was completed
to-day in a general order issued by Ma

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAT 27, 1898.
APPEAL OF THE
PEACE UNION
Prepared in this Country
and Mailed to Spain.
HELD BY THE GOVERNMENT
SPAIN WAS ASKED TO MAKE
CONCESSIONS.
Several Methods Suggested in Which
the Universal Organization
Hoped to Avoid
Hostilities.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, May 26.â 1t was
developed here to-day that the Univer
sal Peace Union, through its president,
Alfred H. Love of this city, prepared
and mailed to the Queen Regent of
Spain and Premier Sagasta an appeal
asking that Government to acknowl
edge the independence of Cuba in the
interests of peace. The appeal was first
sent on April 21, four days before this
country declared that a state of war
existed betwen Spain and the United
States. It was held up, however, in
New York, and after two weeks had
expired, was again in President Love's
hands with the seal unbroken and
stamped across it with a Government
stamp a notice that no mail is per
mitted to go to Spain.
Ex-Governor Hoyt of Wyoming then
took the communication to Washing
ton and laid it before the State Depart
ment in the hope th~t it might be per
mitted to go and at the same time to
assure the Government of its contents.
It was not allowed to go through the
mails, however, but it was suggested
to ex-Governor Hoyt that it might be
sent to one of the European branches
of the union. As a result it was sent
to Berne, Switzerland, for transmission
to Spain and is now en route.
After referring to the Union as rep
resenting many thousands of friends of
peace in all parts of the world, the ap
peal indicates that all the pending dif
ficulties could be disposed of by prac
tical means. Continuing, it says:
"Our President, Mr. McKinley, we
have reason to believe, has bf en forced
into his present attitude. You know,
he is the executive of this Government.
The Peace Union is cosmopolitan. We
have, we believe, still in your Senate,
one of our vice-presidents, Arturo de
Marcoartu."
Referring to the Union's sincerity, the
a) peal states: "We would do what
we now suggest for you to grant," and
continuing reads: "Oh! how you would
elevate your nation. What contribu
tion to the age of intelligence if you
would send a message to America:
'For the sake of peace, humanity and
your friendship, we will hear terms for
the independence of Cuba.' This
would open the way for three plans
the Universal Peace Union is now sug-
gesting. First, a commission to visit
you; second, purchase, and the Maine
matter somehow considered; third, in
ternational arbitration and interna
tional mediation. Is it too late? If
there is a lull, if there be a check, if
any way be open, we can say in all
frankness for our good and for the
good of all, that the feeling here is
opposed to war and against the an
nexation of your possessions. There
is a deep, earnest desire for the free
dom of Cuba. Now, will not Cuba be
worth more to you free than as a col
ony? If you hold it, it will always be
restless, expensive and a trouble to
you."
The remaining portions of the appeal
are solicitous of Spain's feelings in the
existing difficulty and state that the
Union is actuated entirely by a desire
to bring about peace. In one portion it
states 'we have appreciated your sev
eral concessions in this Cuban trou
ble."
President Love explains these to
mean the withdrawal of WeyJ^r; the
submission to the United States' re
fusal to withdraw General Lee; the
feeding of reconcentrados by this coun
try; the autonomy scheme, and, last
of all, the declaration of an armistice.
Speaking of the efforts of the Union
to bring this latter about President
Love said to-night that on April 9 the
Union cabled to the Queen requesting
her to grant an unconditional armistice
and also telegraphed to Cardinal Gib
bons to have the Pope use his endeav
ors to bring about the result.
"Two days later," Mr. Love said,
"the armistice was granted."

Seizure of the British Steamer Adula
and Arrest of Her
Officers.
Copyrighted. IS9S, by .lames Gordon Bennett.
KINGSTON, May 26.â Cable advices
were received here to-day fromCienfue
gos, Cuba, stating that the Adula, on
her arrival there, was stopped by the
Spanish authorities. A search was
made and it was found that there was
a man on board, whose name is not
given, Mho had gone on the ship sur
reptitiously. His name was not on the
ship's papers.
The Spanish authorities declared that
his object was to go into the town and
carry back information to the blockad
ing fleet, and that his presence was a
breach of the neutrality laws.
The ship was thereupon seized and
Captain Walker and his officers were
put in confinement.
The British Consul has made a pro
test, and the English authorities here
are moving in the matter. It is believed
the person on boarjl was the agent of a
newspaper correspondent, as the Span
ish Consul here absolutely refused to
permit the ship to leave if any reporter
was allowed to go.
MEXICAN DOLLARS
FOR THE PHILIPPINES
NEW YORK, May 27.â The Press
says: One of the most interesting
preparations of the outfitting of the
Manila expedition has just been an
nounced. The Government has pur
chased 250,000 Mexican silver dollars,
which General Merritt will take along
to defray the expenses of the expedi
tion. This amount is not expected to
be enough, but more will be sent from
time to time.
By purchasing Mexican dollars, a
great saving is made. It is possible to
obtain Mexican dollars at 46 cents each.
In other words, Uncle Sam was able to
buy 250,000 Mexican dollars for 5116,000.
They were bought in San Francisco.
GOVERNMENT MAY
BUY FORTY YACHTS
NEW YORK, May 28.â The new naval
cruiser board has sent to Washington a
list of forty yachts which it recommends
for purchase. Among the vessels named
are George Gould's Atalanta and John
Jacob Astor's Nourmahal. Each is rec
ommended for purchase at $100,000.
DEWEY PROVES
TO BE A VERY
TRUE PROPHET
Before War Commenced He Wrote
That the Philippines Could
Soon Be Captured.
BOSTON, May 26.â A Montpelier (Vt.) special says: The follow
ing is an abstract of a letter sent by Admiral Dewey from Hongkong
April 18, previous to the declaration of war, and just received by his sister,
Mrs. Mary P. Greely, in this city. It was the last communication from
him before his departure for the Philippines. Admiral Dewey said:
"We are still waiting for the declaration of war to begin our work
here. I have seven men-of-war, all ready for action, and should war be
the word I believe we will make short work of the Spanish reign in the
Philippines. The insurgents are ready to rise at our first gun, and long
before this reaches you we may be masters at Manila and other Philip
pine cities. But after all war is a terrible thing, and I hope some way
out of the dilemma may be found without resorting to it. My health
continues good, although it is taxed to the uttermost, and my one prayer
is that I may be able to hold out until we have finished our work."

Special I>ispatrh to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 26.â Thomas Es
trada Palma, the representative of the
Cuban republic in New York, has just
received the first copy of "I>as Villas,"
the war bulletin which is published by
authority of General Gomez at the
headquarters of the Cuban army. Be
sides the official notices and orders is
sued to the army the paper contains a
lengthy address issued to the Cuban
army and people by General Gomez, in
which he says:
I, Maximo Gomez, commander-In-chief
of the Cuban arYny, take this opportun
ity through the medium of Laa Villas,
which hereafter will be published once
i-ach week at the headquarters of the
aimy <.f liberation, to communicate with
those "t my command and our people. In
view <f the adoption of the constitution
of the republic of Cuba and the armed
intervention of the United States in our
behalf to aid us in obtaining our inde
pendence, which soon will be recognized
by all the world, I desire to make known
that hereafter our soldiers no longer shall
be known as Insurgents, but soldiers of
the regular army of the republic.
I hereby direct that there shall be is
sued each week a war bulletin, which
shall be published at the general head
quarters of the army and shall begin with
this issue on the 10th day of May, to be
known as Las Villas. It will be circu
lated under the direction and by the au
thority of the staff officers of the army,
and In it will be published all circulars,
orders :<r.<i official not^s of the War De-
partment as well as information which
our army and our people may desire to
know concerning our progress and our
allies, the United States.
I tak. this occasion to remind each
Cuban In service that he now has a coun
try recognized for which he must fight
with all honor and glory. He Is now a
Cuban soldier and not an Insurgent, and
will respect the rules of civilized warfare.
I will order punished any chief officer or
private who fails to respect the rights of
our prisoners of war, and such prisoners
will be tn ated with respect to their rank
and according to the rules of civilized
countries and the constitutional army.
Our soldiers will conduct themselves in'
such a manner as to gain for themselves
the god offices of our brethren of the
United States, and for this reason it is
my wish that the army of Cuba may ex
hibit model discipline. I desire to' im
press upon you that we will not continue
this war. which so valiantly has been
kept up for the past three years, with the
idoa of revenge. We are fighting for lib
erty and independence, and not for re
venge, and I would call your attention to
the fact that the history of the world
shows that loss of blood has always been
the price of liberty.
Notwithstanding, we must ever re
member our dead martyrs to the cause
of Cuban freedom and fight the good
flght, and It will not be long before
every Spanish soldier shall have left our
soil. We have had to contend against
a most cruel enemy â one which has
known no honor, and Its methods have
been most barbarous, and every act of
Spain has shown the thirst for blood and
desire to trample down and annihilate
the people of Cuba. I do not desire that
our army shall emulate their example,
but I would prefer that our methods of
war be those of civilized nations; that we
may show to the enemy that those whom
they are fighting are more honorable
than themselves.
In a recent proclamation by General
Blanco he made the statement that it
now was the duty of all Spaniards to die
for their honor In the war against the
United States. Spain does not know the
meaning of honor. Her definition of the
word is nothing but cruelty.
Spanish soldiers have never been known
to die for honor except when they were
opposed as ten to one. Their idea of honor
has been to assassinate defenseless
women and children whose protectors are
now fighting for freedom in our army.
Their idea of honor has been to rob. to
plunder. They die for honor drinking,
gambling and committing crimes against
humanity and against society; but now
they will die before American and Cuban
arms.
I take this opportunity to speak thus to
our people and our army that they may
be encouraged and know that we now
have noble allies, who will aid us in our
fight for freedom, which long has been
deserved, and which we can now see will
bo a reality at no distant day. I shall
also from time to time, In Las Villas,
communicate with you in the same
manner. _______

MARE ISLAND NAVY YARD, May
26.â The United States ship Philadel
phia, after being thoroughly refitted,
was undocked this afternoon, and the
Monterey took her place In the dock.
The bottom of the Monterey will be
scraped and painted, after -which she
will be ready for her trip to Manila.
The large collier Peter Jebsenâre
named Brutusâ purchased by the Gov
ernment -with her cargo of 4800 tons of
coal for $270,000, is also being prepared
for sea. Her boilers and engines, after
inspection, were pronounced in excel
lent condition. Rapid-fire guns will be
put on board at once. She will make
the trip to the Philippines in company
with the Monterey.
A crew of naval militia from San
Francisco, numbering 56, has been or
dered to the Mohican, which will de
part soon with ammunition and stores
for the Hawaiian naval station.
There are now lying at the navy
yard fifteen United States ships, as
follows: Philadelphia, Monterey,York
town, Alert. Mohican, Pensacola, Inde
pendence, Unadilla, monitor Comanche,
Hartford, Thetis, Ranger, Ningchow
and Peter Jebsen.
The Rowan is not coming to the yard
to be commissioned. Arrangements are
being made to send her outfit and
stores to Portland, Or.
Boatswain Frary, retired, who has
been living in San Diego, has reported
for active duty on the Pensacola.
A story has just been told by officers
of the United State ship Alert of the
vigorous measures taken by the old
cruiser to secure coal on her recent
trip up from South America. Needing
coal at Acapulco, a Central American
town, of which more than half of the
inhabitants are Spanish, the Captain
applied to the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company. He was told that he could
have coal at the rate of $20 per ton in
gold, providing he took it himself, as
the company could not deliver it. The
captain accordingly took possession of
a lighter and sent the ship's marine
guard to protect the coal passers.
When they arrived at the wharf it was
crowded with the natives, who at
tempted to prevent the coal leaving
the dock. The marines cleared the
wharf with a bayonet charge and then
stretched a rope across, loaded their
rifles and instructed the Mexicans that
the first one to cross the rope would be
shot. After that 150 tons were loaded
on the ship without further molesta
tion. Previous efforts had been made
through the Consul to secure coal from
the Government, but without success.
CERVERA INTENDED TO
BOMBARD COAST CITIES
His Plan Frustrated Through Inabil
ity to Procure Coal for His
Squadron.
NEW YORK, May 26.â A special to
the World from Quebec says: Senor
Polo y Bernabe, before he sailed from
Quebec for Europe, confided to a friend
the original Intentions of Admiral Cer
vera's squadron.
It appears that the Spanish fleet, be
ing confessedly unable to meet the Am
erican vessels, was to avoid the latter
and cause all the damage it could to
the American coast. Among other
places to be bombarded was Portland,
Me., and an attempt was to be made to
blow up a powder mill near that place.
Senor Polo succeeded in makine satis
factory arrangements for the coaling of
the fleet, but the agreement was broken
owing to American influence in the coal
concern, and the news of this fact drove
the Spanish squadron from its original
intention of touching at Cape Breton
and made it take refuge at Santiago de
Cuba. Since then the Spanish fleet has
left on its journey to Cadiz.
Spain's tactics will be to trust to
fever and the terrible expense daily
incurred by the American Government,
and she will not risk a repetition of the
Manila disaster.
"In the fall," the late Embassador
said, "Spain will abandon Cuba, after
having made her enemy pay dearly for
its victory."

General Cebazo and Col.
Hernandez Confer With
Alger and Miles.
Information Showing Condition of
Cuban Troops and Their Will
ingness to Join Uncle Sam.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 26.
Secretary Alger and General Miles
conferred with two officers from the
staff of General Garcia, General En
rique Collazo and Lieutenant Colonel
Charles Hernandez, who come direct
from Garcia's headquarters bearing
credentials from him to perfect a plan
of co-operation with the American
forces. They accompanied Lieutenant
Rowan of the United States army on
his return from Garcia's camp at
Bayamo, in Central Cuba, and shared
with him the danger of a two days'
trip in an open boat from the north
coast of Cuba. They reported first to
the Cuban delegation here and Secre
tary Queseda was careful to keep their
presence secret until General Miles had
made the fact known.
This relieved the men from further
secrecy and to-day General Collazo and
Colonel Hernandez gave an interesting
account of General Garcia's forces and
the general equipment of the Cuban
army.
Colonel Hernandez says Garcia has
his headquarters at Bayamo and that
his staff, with a bodyguard of several
hundred men, are quartered Inside the
city. The infantry and cavalry are
quartered in the suburbs of South
Bayamo. Tents are not used, but in
their place the men hastily construct
coverings made of palm leaves and
guinea grass, which are more effective
than canvas as a shelter against the
hot sun.
In all about 3000 men are thus quar
tered. They are well armed with Rem
ington and Mausers, captured from the
Spaniards. Most of them have mach
etes, but only the officers carry other
small arms. The cavalry have small
horses, much like the Indian mustangs,
hardy and reliable. Mules are used for
pack purposes.
Colonel Hernandez says that the com
missary and quartermaster's depart
ment is unknown in the sense used by
army officials here. In lieu of these
the companies not fully armed are or
ganized as "preios." The duty of the

"prelos" is to bring meat, ample sup
plies being secured from Puerto Prin

in the woods. The system works per
fectly, Colonel Hernandez says, and the
troops are kept well fed and in good
spirits. There are no dress parades and
none of the regularity of daily drill
used in the United States army. The
main occupation is in making the long
daily marches to keep the men hard-
ened.
The Cubans say the arrival of Lieu
tenant Rowan aroused the greatest en
thusiasm throughout the Cuban camp.
There was no notice of his coming. The
first seen of him was as he galloped up
Commercial street, followed by the
Cuban guides vho accompanied him
from Florida. He was warmly greeted
by General Garcia, and the two held a
three ho-urs' conference. It was decided
that Lieutenant Rowan should return
that afternoon, and General Garcia as
signed General Collazo and Colonel
Hernandez, with three guides, to ac
company him.
Colonel Hernandez says communica
tion is maintained with General Gomez
and with points along the coast. From
these, he has a general idea of the
forces, outside of those with General
Garcia at Bayamo. He estimates that
there are 12,000 men, all of whom are
well armed, east of La Trocha, and
constituting forces in the eastern divis
ion of the island, under General Gar
cia, These include the 3000 at Bayamo,
the others being scattered at various
points. He estimates General Gomez's
immediate command at about 3000 men,
with 6000 men scattered at various
points. In all there are, according to
General Collazo, and Colonel Hernan
dez, about 20,000 to 25,000 troops.
It is understood that the purpose of
the present visit of Garcia's officers is
te give that general's assurance to the
authorities here of his desire to give
every possible co-operation to the
American movements. Similar assur
ances have come from General Gomez
and have been presented by Senor
Queseda. The Cuban officers have
made a good impresion here, and the
authorities were agreeably surprised to
find them men of ability and soldierly
bearing, speaking English -well. They fc

miles away, and report the murder.
The police at once started for the
Indian camp and arrested the two In
dians, after considerable trouble. They
are now under guard at Lake Marsh.
Both Indians, it is said, have con
fessed. Meehan and Cox had been
working for some time on the bars of
the McClintock River and had found
some good prospects. About two weeks
ago they noticed a band of Stick In
dians prowling around their camp.
Their intentions were evidently hostile,
and the two prospectors decided to go
to Lake Marsh and report the matter
to the mounted police.
They loaded their effects into a small
boat and started down the river. After
going a short distance two Indians
suddenly appeared on the bank. They
were armed with rifles. Both took hur
ried aim and fired at the prospectors.
Meehan was shot through the heart
and died without uttering a word. His
body was thrown in the river, and will
probably never be recovered. Cox re
ceived a dangerous wound in tha
breast.
The motive of the crime was un
doubtedly robbery. It was with gTeat
difficulty that the mounted police at
Lake Marsh prevented the men en
camped there from lynching the In
dians. ______________

iv ar.
"What reply, if any, the Hawaiian
Government made to this inquiry, is
not yet known in Washington. It is
known, however, that the government
of the islands will not maintain neu
trality, but will allow the United States
to use its territory and harbor at Hon
olulu as freely as if they were part >>f
the United States. By so doing the
Hawaiian Government assumes the po
sition of being practically an ally of
the I'nited States and takes upon Itself
the full responsibility fur this attitude.
As far as is known here, the Spanish
Consul in Honolulu still maintains his
relations with President Dole's govern
ment, but when the Charleston and
transports bound for Manila take on
coal and provisions at Honolulu it is
believed he will protest emphatically
against it, and, upon his protest being
disregarded, will sever his connections
with the Government and demand his
passports.
President McKinley realizes that if
the Spanish Consul should be joined in
his protest by the representatives of
other European Governments there
would be great danger of complications
with those nations, and for this reason
the President is more than ever anx
lous that Congress should lose n<> time
In formally annexing the Islands to the
United States, so as to leave Spain and
other nations of Europe no (round on
which to base their protest. President
McKinley has been strongly urged to
take possession of the Islands as a mil
itary necessity, and if Congress was
noi in session it is probable he would
do 80. He is reluctant to take any such
action, however, while Congress is in
session and while the question of an
nezatlon is pending in that body. The
military necessity exists, however, and
the administration will avail itself of
every privilege granted by the Ha
waiian Government to use the islands
as a military and naval base.
There is no escape from doing bo, in
fact, and but for the facilities for coal-
Ing and provisioning vessels and trans
ports at Honolulu the administration
duced the question of privateering, urg
ing the Government to adopt privateer
ing "in view of the American proceed
ings."
The Minister of Foreign Affairs,
Duke Ahnodivar de Rio, said the mat
ter was inopportune and could not be
debated. Couat Almenas insisted, but
the President of the Senate refused to
allow the discussion to continue.
MADRID, May 26.â The outcome of
yesterday's financial debate is that both
Senor Puigcerver Minister of Finance,
and the Marquis de Vilaverde, the Con
servative leader have agreed to oppose
the impost on the national debt. The j
Marquis declares the silverists will op- i
pose the measure even to the length of j
obstruction, and Senor Puigcerver de
clared that the measure will not be
come a law while he is Minister.
A crisis will be precipitated by the
Carlists, Republicans and Romeroists,
who intend to Introduce a resolution in
favor of the inmost. This will divide!
the majority of the Chamber of Depu- j
ties inasmuch as Senor Cammazo, the j
1. 1 bora 1 leader and Minister of Public j
Instruction, has given notice that he |
will resign from the Ministry if the
impost is not adopted.
The alternative of Send* Gammnzo's
position is the resignation of Senor j
PuigcerveT, whose following is less ,
than that of Senor Gammazo. In re- |
gard to these indications of a crisis, the
Liberal remarks:
"The soverignity, perhaps the inde
pendence of the nation, is hanging in j
the balance. Enemies menace it every- ;
where abroad, and there is famine at !
home. A solution of the problem can
not be foreseen. Industry, commerce j
and agriculture are dead. The flOTjrer
of Spanish youth is giving its life blood
to carry on the war, and weakened
mothers are nursing a new generation
amidst this accumulation of evils.
Patriotism demands our silent inactiv- j
ity, while the private partisan squab
ble over petty questions is depriving
the nation of a strong, united govern
ment capable of facing the present
struggles. The country may wait while
(vernment arranges its differ- j
ences with party politics: but Dewey, !
Sampson, McKinley and Salisbury are
not likely to wait."
The Minister of Marine, Captain
Aunin, was asked yesterday if it were '
tnip that Americans were blockading
Santiago d^ Cuba, and he replied: "It
is to be presumed that the Americans
will try to hinder our ships from leav- i
i ing Santiago de Cuba, but I am not
i certain whether the Americans arrived
in time to do so. The latest dispatch
from Admiral Cervera on Tuesday an- i
nounced that all his vessels were load- j
Ing coal."
The general impression here is that
i Admiral Cervera has left Santiago.
would practically be compelled to aban
don the Philippines and call Rear Ad
miral Devvey home, regardless of the
fact that by so doing it would leave
a condition of affairs in the Orient that
would be practically certain to bring
on a European war.
CHICAGO, May 26.â A special to the
News from Washington says: The Ger
man and French Consuls at Honolulu
have, according to information received
at the State Department, joined in a
complaint to their governments against
the alleged favoritism shown by the
Dole republican Government of Hawaii
to the United States over other coun
tries. The protest has aroused the
greatest interest in Congressional and
diplomatic circles.

BOND ISSUE
White Talks on the New
Revenue Bill.
WOULD COIN SEIGNIORAGE.
SENATOR GORMAN PRESENTS
AN AMENDMENT.
It Places a Tax of One-Half of Ona
Per Cent on Certain Large Cor
porations â No Progress
on the Measure.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 26.
No substantial progress was made by
the Senate to-day toward the disposi
tion of the war revenue measure, al
though it was under consideration for
three hours. Speeches were delivered
on the bill by White (D.) of California
and Teller of Colorado. The former op
posed the issue of bonds and strongly
advocated the coinage of the silver
seigniorage and the tux upon corpora
tions. In his discussion of the last
feature Teller drew out the fact that
an amendment was to be offered to the
bill by Gorman of Maryland placing a
tax of one-half of 1 per cent on certain
large corporations. Teller dwelt largely
upon the proposition to levy an Income
tax. He had not concluded his argu
ment when the bill was laid aside in
order that eulogies might be pro
nounced upon the late Senator Wal
thall of Mississippi.
White delivered an extended speech cov
ering pretty fully the general features of
the bill, especially those relating to the
tax on corporations and on inheritances.
The consideration of the bill, he said, had
enlisted the attention of the country, and
many people were becoming restless be
cause a tinal vote had not been reached.
He thought, however, that the delay was
due to the peculiarity of the pending
measure. The revenue bill, upon which
the civil war was conducted, was a com
pUcated instrument, utterly inapplicable
to piesent conditions. The object of the
b.H challenged the attention and support
of every member of both branches of
Congress. All are united to present a
solid front to the foreign foe. it was no
longer' a question of doubt that all the
money necessary for the prosecution of
the vvar would be supplied. It was sim
ply the method of raising the funds that
was under debate here.
"Great as this nation Is," said he,
"mighty as are her resources, this coun
try is not now prepared to place before
an opponent its full strength, and all the
material of war residing in its bosom.
But in time, and not a very long time,
either, it will be ready to put forth its
full strength, and then this conflict will
be decided speedily."
White said he deemed it essentially de
sirable that the taxation imposed by the
bill should be spread over the country
fairly and equitably. The burdens placed
upon' the country by the war ought to be
borne by all alike.
White maintained that the placing by
the House of Representatives of one
tbird of the tax to be raised upon beer,
one-third upon tobacco and one-third on
stamps was most unjustifiable. Boer and
tobacco, it was argued, said he, were
luxuries which people did not have to
use unless they chose to do so. He ad
mitted that tobacco and beer were legiti
mate articles of taxation, but said there
could be no doubt that the burden of the
tax would fall upon the poor men of the
country.
White denounced the stamp tax as an
onerous burden, from which all would bo
glad to escape. It was a nuisance and
par excellence a tax upon the plain peo
ple.
Concerning the inheritance tax. White
maintained that notwithstanding the ob
jectione urged against It by reason of
its In Ing an invasion of the prerogatives
of the Btate, it was perfectly justifiable),
and he expressed the hope and belief that
the courts would sustain the action of
Congress in enacting the proposition into
national law.
White then entered upon a long dis
cussion of the proposed corporation tax,
which hÂ»- earnestly support. -d. He main
tained that the corporations owed some
thing to the country, not only for their
creation, but also for the privilege of ex
istence. He maintained that the argu
ment of Senators that v tax should not
be laid against a corporation because it
was not laid against a partnership en
gaged in the same line of business was
imt .sound, as the corporation enjoyed
morij privileges than the partnership in
business and before the law. If it were
not so corporations would not be formed.
White said that Gorman of Maryland
ha;l prepared an amendment to the meus
uro which he would bo willing to support
if the general tax upon all corporations
Bbould not be deemed desirable by the
Senate. At his request Gorman sent to
the desk and had read the amendment he
proposed to offer at the proper time. It
follows:
i That from and after the passing of this act
every person, linn, company or corporation
owning or possessing, or, having the care or
management of any railroad, street railroad,
sloping car, steamboat, ship or other vessel
engaged or employed In the business of trans
porting passengers or freight for hire, or in
transporting the malls of the United States or
carrying on or doing an express business, or
having the care or management of any tele
graphic or telephone line by which telegraphic
or telephone dispatches or messages are re
ceived or transmitted, or carrying on, or doing
the business of furnishing gas, * electric light,
electric power, steam beat or steam power, or
refining petroleum, or refining sugar, or own
ing or controlling any pipe line for transport
ing oil or other product*, whose gross annual
receipts exceed $250,000, shall be subjected to
pay annually a special excise tax equivalent
to % of 1 per cent on the gross amount of all
receipts of such persons, firms, corporations
and companies oh their respective business;
provided, that the assessment hereby made
shall not include any amount of the receipts
for the transportation of persons, freight or
mails between the United States and any for
eign port; but this tax shall be rated for the
transportation of . persons, freight or malls
from a port within the United States through
a foreign territory to a port within the United
States, and shall be assessed upon and col
lected from persons, firms, companies or cor
porations within the United States receiving
I. in- or pay for such transportation of persons,
freight or mails.
White Bald it had been whispered that
the . great financial', interests which had
contributed largely to a campaign fund
were demanding as compensation for
their liberality that the burdens of the
war should not be thrust upon them. He
did not believe, however, that any Sen
ator on any side of" the chamber would be
influenced by a demand so selfish. 'He
objected to the issue of bonds at this time
because bonds were unnecessary and be
cause a great majority of the people
were opposed to them, believing they
would Increase too greatly the burdens of
the country. In conclusion "White de
clared that it would be the plain people
who would not only offer up their lives
in defense of the national honor, but who
would also .pay the bulk of . the taxes for
the conduct of the war. He appealed to
Senators to permit the bill to pass in such
form as would distribute with reasonable
equity the burdens it. imposed and. to lay
taxation that would be fair to the Amer
ican people and would reflect honor upon
the Senate.
While the special order" was pending a
bill was reported by Sewc;ll providing for
the employment of retired army officers
during the. war. It was passed.
At the conclusion of the eulogies j the
Senate, as. a further mark of respect, ad
journed until 11 a. m. to-morrow. ..,-â  : v ; â ;

Occupation of Cuba Will
Not Be as Easy as
Reported.
Spaniards of Havana Have Good
Defenses, Plenty of Food
and Ammunition.
KEY WEST. Fla., May 26.â The feel
ing here in well informed naval circles
is rapidly changing regarding the re
sistance to be expected from the Span
iards pending the occupation of Cuba,
and upon other matters of vital import.
Every expedition that returns from
Cuba helps to dispel the belief that the
Spaniards are by any means neglecting
every precaution for a long and deter
mined resistance. It has '^een circu
lated that the Spanish ar<- short of am
munition, especially powder, but as a
matter of fact it is known here that
there is a large powder factory running
night and day turning out smokeless
and black powder. The use of smoke
less powder is proving a great advan
tage to the Spaniards. The land patrol
of the Cuban coast is excellent, while
the fleet of torpedo boats at different
points along the coast are larger in
number and size than at first calcu
lated.
The army of occupation will have to
encounter, it is claimed by a foreign
resident of Havana now here, a force
of acclimated, well drilled Spaniards
of not less than 120.000 men. This man
is in constant cable communication
with Cuba.
I asked him whether he believed the
reports of Havana becoming short of
provisions. He replied: "No; but I
can easily find out." He wrote a dis
patch to one of the secretaries of
Blanco, addressing him not in an offi
cial capacity but as a practicing phy
sician to the effect, "How are Mary and

NEW TORK, May 26.â 1t was a
frightful day at Morris Park to-day.
The rain poured in torrents and the
track was like a quagmire. The Bel
mont stakes, in which Hamburg was
down to appear for the first time in
his three-year-old form, was the fea
ture. There were four starters, with
Hamburg the favorite. The start was
prompt and good, with Bowling Brook
and Hamburg out in front. They set
a rattling pace at the outset and soon
opened a gap of ten lengths on Prev
ious, while Gala Day was a furlong
behind, in short order. Up the hill
they rushed like a team, but before
they had reached the summit Hamburg
was done to a turn. Then Previous
set sail foi the flying Bowling Brook
and for a few seconds it looked as if
he might overtake the leader. It was
a useless chase, for Littlefield let out a
link and it was all over. Bowling
Brook crossed the line half a dozen

The same authority claims the ~uns
of Havana's fortifications are in charge
of (Jerman, French and English offi
cers, whose services had been secured
before he left the island. The same in
formation is obtained from the corre
spondent of the London Times here,
who only left Cuba a few days previ
ous to the declaration of war. He also
corroborates the figures regarding the
strength of the Spanish forces, the ex
cellence of the Spanish coast patrol,
and he expresses a belief that Havana
can hold out for months yet, so far as
the question of provisions is concerned.
The Spanish fleet, he maintains, is car
rying out exactly the policy which he
Â«d been informed they would follow
the Spanish authorities before he
t Cuba, and the tactics of the Span
i admiral for the future will be to
close himself up in Santiago, where
there is a good coal ba^e, and endeavor
to draw on the United States vessels to
battle. By this time the Spanish fleet
now getting ready at Cadiz will be here
to support him and to attack American
Tho plan of the Spanish, according to
a competent authority here who knows

proaches, will be this: The American
fleet cannot judiciously attack the !
Spaniards in the harbor; they can only i
blockade. As soon as the Cadiz fleet
arrives a sortie will be made and an at- I
tempt made to hem in the United
States ships in the channel and force a
' fight by land and sea.

STOCKTON, May 26.â Vice President
Robert Watt says that the scheme of
building the roadbed across the swamp
land west of Stockton on fascines
has been abandoned, the difficulty of
getting brush for the fascines making
the construction too expensive. The
short piece of roadbed built in that way
near Old River has been a success, as
far as practicability outside of cost is
concerned, but it is much cheaper and
would probably be just as satisfactory
to throw up an embankment with
dredgers. Three dredgers are at pres
ent engaged in making a roadbed
through the swamp land between here
and Brentwood. Two of them are at
work in this county, and the third just
beyond the county line.
The dredgers must necessarily dig
1 a channel wide for them to
pass through. This channel is about
j fifty feet wide. The earth excavated is
; thrown to one side, forming the road-
I bed. In order that it may not squash
out, the embankment is being con
\ structed gradually, the height being mi
i creased from time to time as the mate
! rial hardens. By the time the roadbed
'' is finished the channel from which the
' earth is taken will be about ten feet
I deep.
This will make quite a waterway,
and as it will be seven miles long it
i might, be used to advantage for pur
j poses of navigation or drainage, but in
i all likelihood it will not be put to such
j uses, for land owners will probably
connect levees with it, utilizing the
roadbed as one levee in reclaiming
their land.
MUCH DISCUSSION
IN THE HOUSE.
Wide Bange of Argument Concern
ing the Deficiency Pension
Bill.
WASHINGTON, May 26.â 1n a long ses
sion to-day the House passed few bills,
but the discussion involved a wide range
of subjects. After a brush over civil serv
ice, brought on by a paragraph in tne
deficiency pension bill, providing for some
temporary clerks In the War Department,
the House considering a bill to amend the
internal revenue laws, listened to lengthy
speeches from Shafroth of Colorado and
Grow of Pennsylvania upon the free coin
age of silver and greenbacks as legal ten
der, respectively.
Pending an aye and no vote upon the
internal revenue bill, the House ad
journed. The vote will be taken imme
diately after the House meets to-morrow.

TERROR IN GREAT DANGER.
NEW YORK, May 26.â A Washington special to
the Herald says: The destination of the Spanish
torpedo boat destroyer Terror is unknown to the
authorities, but it is believed that she will fall in
with an American scout and her destruction or
capture is regarded as certain before she can reach
the neighborhood of the Spanish fleet. Any attempt
on the part of the Terror to pass the blockade insti
tuted by Commodore Schley will be foiled, the offi
cials say. They are certain that within a short time
the American scouts of Schley's squadron will de
stroy her.
VALLEY ROAD
CELEBRATION
A Big Jubilee at Bakers
field To-Day.
MONOPOLY'S RULE BROKEN.
GREAT CAUSE OF REJOICING
AMONG VALLEY PEOPLE.
The Demonstration Will Be the
Most Enthusiastic Event
Ever Known in That
Locality.
PRSFIELD, May 26. â Never be
the history of Bakersfleld was
so gayly and elaborately deco
it is to-night. The main streets
ana many residences are perfect laby
rinths of fluttering red, white and blue,
green and yellow, all in honor of what
this people are pleased to call "Valley
road jubilee," which will come with the
rising of to-morrow's sun. Everything
is alive with a spirit of festivity. There
has been a hard tussle between "war
and Jubilee spirits, but at last the lat
ter are triumphant, and to-morrow
promises to be the greatest day of re
joicing ever known in this portion of
the country. The thought of being re
lieved from the grinding rule of the
Southern Pacific causes old men to re
joice as they never have before and
young men to see bright visions of
commercial freedom.
Just how extensive the crowd will be
to-morrow is hard to estimate. The
advance guard began to arrive last
night, and all day the town has bustled
with the throng. Los Angeles arrived
in full force to-night, and in the morn
ing Fresno, Hanford, Visalia, Tulare
and other up-valley towns will pour in.
The trades' procession will begin at
10 o'clock and wind up at the Arling
ton Hotel corner, where speechmaking
and other ceremonies will take place.
There will be five brass bands in the
parade, besides Chinese music galore.
The Chinese feature of the parade
promises to be unusually attractive.
All the Mongolians will take an active
part in the celebration. They have im
ported $10,000 worth of trappings from
San Francisco to help their procession
al display. There is to be a Wild West
show, a barbecue, and a great ball in
the evening. The ball will take place
in a new warehouse, 60 by 400 feet, near
the Valley road depot.
Besides a vast display of fireworks,
there will be many significant features
among the decorations. One store
keeper has two windows trimmed up,
one being labeled "1888" and the other
"1898." On the former appears this in
scription "Mr. Huntington, can't we
induce you to give us lower freight
rates?" Mr. Huntingtonâ "Oh, my dear
sir, you are unfortunately off the line
of competition."
Under the 1898 date the story appears
thus: Mr Huntingtonâ "Mr. Farmer,
can't I induce you to allow me to haul
your wheat?"
Farmerâ "Oh, my dear sir, you are
unfortunate in being located on the line
of competition."

MATRON ROYCE
HAS RESIGNED
I A Sensation at Agnews
Insane Asylum.
SCANDALOUS STORIES TOLD.
A YOUNG LADY'S CHARACTER
UNJUSTLY ASSAILED.
Dr. Sponogle Also Involved by the
Talkative Matron, Whose
Charges Are Found to
Be Groundless.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, May 26.â Miss Ella
Royce, matron of Agnews Insane Asy
lum, has resigned her position, and
there are several sensational stories
afloat as to what brought her retire
ment about. The board of managers
Tdeld a meeting at that institution'yes
terday and the session was a stormy
one. It is said Miss Royce was given
the privilege of resigning or being dis
charged, and she preferred the former.
The trouble originated thus: A story
became circulated among the young
lady attendants that Miss Royce had
accused one of their number of immor
al conduct. The young lady whose
character was impeached became in
dignant at the charge, and demanded
an investigation. Then Dr. Sponogle,
the medical director, was dragged into
the scandal. It is said Miss Royce de
nied making charges against the young
lady attendant, but s:iid that she had
stated that Dr. Sponogle had made im
proper advances toward herself. This
accusation was denied by the doctor.
It is impossible to learn just what oc
curred at the meeting, but it is said
that the managers sustained Dr. Spon
ogle and that Miss Royce was given to
understand that she would have to go.
Rumo- has it that Miss Royce's re
tirement is but the beginning of some
very sensational developments at the
asylum, and that the whole affair will
culminate in a thorough investigation.

At the war office in Washington it is
thought that the next expedition for
Manila should leave this city next Mon
day In fact there was talk in Washlng

Inquiries were mad..- by wire if the

ting on an extra rush it might be possible
to get more troops under way by Satur

for the second expedition, but the Zea

can be put in readiness without delay.

and the problem now confronting the
arm)- authorities is to provide transport
ation to move them to Manila. Before
the lapse of another week California's
quota under the second call may Increase
the army there to twelve thousand men.
The ships for the second expedition are
in sight, but the third and fourth expedi
tions may have to wait a considerable
length of time, perhaps until the vessels
comprising the first fleet return from the
Orient.
The fact begins to dawn on the minds
of many farsoeing men that the opera
tions at the Philippines may take first
rank in the conflict with Spain. More
troops and more battle-ships may ulti
mately be required there than are now
considered necessary. It is clear now to
the mind of the ordinary observer that a
great mistake was made in sending the
Oregon away from this coast at the time
she was .ordered to Key West. Should
Spain at the suggestion of friendly influ
ence decide to surrender Cuba and con
tend for future possession of the Philip
pines the operations in the east would be
come surpassingly important.
GENERAL MERRITT IN
CHARGE OF THE CAMP.
The Gallant Soldier and His Aids
Arrive In the City and Take
Command.
Major General Wesley Merritt arrived
, In this city fmm the East last evening.
i The hoary-headed soldier will make but
' a temporary stop here, and then continue
his journey to the Philippines, where he
; wili take command of the troops now on
the high seas and i-impi-d in this city
awaiting transports to take them to
Manila, and will also take the office of
: Governor General of the islands. General
Merritt was accompanied by his ai.ls,
' Major L. H. Strother. Major H. C. Hale
I and Captain T. V. Mott. The party was
In the best of health, and although weary
from the ride across the plains, con
fessed that the trip was not barren of
enjoyment. Major James G. Blame Jr.
was also on the train that bore General
M.-rritt and his aids to this coast. Al
though one of the officers on the staff
of the general who will invade the Philip
pines. Mr. Maine was not of the party
occupying the private car. but had a
state room in one of the Pullman sleep
ers. The reason that he did not compose
one of the military party was owing to
the fact that although he is here for the
purpose of taking charge of his com
mand, he has not as yet reported for
duty.
General Merritt was extremely uncom
municative regarding military mi-tters,
but was not reticent regarding his trip
overland, and the friendly, patriotic man
ner in which he was received after he had
crossed the California line. "Regarding
military matters and the war, I have
nothing to say," he said. "I am here on
my way to Manila, but what course I
shall pursue in the future I know not.
Regarding orders, I have none bearing
on operations for the future, and do not
know whether or not I will sail on the
next transport, or when I will leave for
the Philippines."
General Merritt's aversion to invading
the lands of the enemy with the troops
placed at his command has been partially
overcome by the fact that two regiments
of infantry and Be v era] companies of cav
alry are now headed for this port to join
ills army. From the demeanor of the
general it is manifest that he would will
ingly scatter more trained fighters among
the raw recruits of the volunteer army,
but it is also evident that he has de
termined to make the best of the situa-
tion.
The course that will be pursued when
the army and its commander, according
to his statement last evening, reaches the
enemy's lands is also still in the hands if
the authorities at Washington. A general

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAT 27, 1898.
Idea, however, has been given out, and
the people are satisfied that the enemy
will be driven from the land it long held,
or will be forced to dwell there the com
batant of no man. Any resistance that
may be met will be overcome by the arms
of Merritt and the huge guns of Dewey,
the power which the Spaniards so well
know.
Speaking of his trip to this coast. Gen
eral Merritt had no complaint to make
of the treatment he received along the
route, and was pleased with the many
ovations given him at various stations in
California. At Auburn a cheering crowd
stood on the platform when the train ar
rived. One tumult of applause and cheer
ing greeted the general and his
aids from the tim<: of the train's
arrival at the station until its
departure, and many gifts of flowers were
tossed through the open windows of the
j private car in which the officers were
I seated, and they were accepted with
; pleasant words. Colonel Otis of Los An
i geles joined the party at Auburn and pro-
I ceeded to this city with It. When General
i Merritt was a general of volunteers
Colonel Otis was captain of a company in
his command. They fought together In
| Shenandoah. They fought together in
i Yesterday was the tirst time they had met
i since that hlstorio engagement, but a
j friendship was soon re-established.
At Newcastle another patriotic crowd
was met. The people, eager to get a
I glimpse of the man in whose hands such
j a great responsibility rests, swarmed into
; and around the car and heaped fruits and
< flowers within it. General Merritt. in
: answer to repeated appeals, went to the
| platform and thanked the enthusiasts for
| their patriotism and their generosity.
j "We will put all these good things to as
I good use as you have contemplated," he
j said In conclusion, and retired within his
car. At Sacramento, and, in fact, all
! along the line until the Oakland mole was
reached, he was met in the .same enthu
! siastic way, and always in some way
manifested his appreciation.
Arriving in this city the general was
met by a party of officers, prominent
among them Colonel Pope, and was
driven to the Palace Hotel. Until his de
parture he will probably make the Palace
his headquarters, and there will receive
his orders on which the campaign for the
occupation of the Philippines will be
built.
Major-General Wesley Merritt has
probably seen more active service than
any other surviving officer of the Civil
War. Besides taking a prominent part in
all the great battles fought by the army
of the Potomac, he was a leading figure
in every cavalry fight under Buford,
Pleasanton ami Sheridanâ over seventy In
all. He was born in New York in 1836,
graduated at West Point in ISOO. taking
high rank for scholarship. He was com
; missioned brevet second lieutenant of
I dragoons, and in 18G2 was made captain
; of the Second United States Cavalry. At
the battle of Gettysburg he commanded
the Reserve Cavalry Brigade, and for
gallantry was breveted major July- 1,
1863. At Yellow Tavern, Va., he fought
heroically, and was breveted lleutenant
colonel May 11, 1864. General J. E. B.
Stuart, the famous Confederate cavalry
leader, received hia death wound In the
same battle, in front of Merritt's brigade.
At the Cavalry fight at Hawes Shop May
11. 1864, Merritt earned the brevet of col
onel. For distinguished services at the
Opequan, Cedar Creek and Fisher's Hill,
Va., he was breveted major-general of
volunteers. For especial bravery at Five
Forks, Sailors Creek and the final surren
der at Appomattox Courthouse he was
made major-general of volunteers, dating
fmm Five Forks. He was appointed su
perintendent of West Point Military
Academy in ISS2. In I*S7 he was commis-
Bloned brigadier-general of the United
Btatea army. His present rank is major
general in 'the regular army.
An ex-cavalry oflieer, Captain J. N.
Flint, residing "in this city, who served
directly under Sheridan from the Rapidan
to Appomattox Courthouse and saw him
every day in the saddle for two years,
has this to say of his old chief: "Merritt
was one of Sheridan's most trusted lieu
tenants. He could be relied on in any
emergency. In battle he was conspicuous
f.,r coolness and intrepidity. He never
lost his head. At the decisive battle of
Five Forks Sheridan's cavalry, with the
help of the Fifth Infantry corps, was
called upon to dislodge the Confederates
from some strongly constructed entrench
ments. The task was by no means an
easy one. Merritt fought his division for
all "it was worth. At a critical juncture
the commanding officer of a New Jersey
cavalry rode up to Merritt and informed
him that his men were entirely out of
carbine ammunition. 'Go at them, then,
with your pistols and sabers. Forward!"
he commanded. In the Shenandoah Val
ley and elsewhere, when Merritt ordered
a "charge, if one of his subordinates wns
at all bashful about leading the men he
would place himself in front of the
squad rons and led the charge In person.
Merritt also has a splendid record as an
Indian fighter. A more capable man to
THE UTAH LIGHT ARTILLERY.
CAPTAIN R. W. YOUNG, Commanding Light
Battery A.
It Is ackuowledged by officers of the United States army that the two bat
teries of light artillery from Utah now in camp in the Richmond District are
very efficient organizations. Much surprise was expressed when the fact was
made known that the Utah artilleryman were supplied with the latest Im
proved rifled breech-loading guns of 3.2-inch caliber. The equipment In this re-
Bpect is equal to that of any battery in the regular service. For many years
Utah did not draw anything from the Government to maintain a military organ
ization and the result was the accumulation of much money at Washington to
the credit of the State. Influence was exerted and the State managed to se
cure eight of the improved IS9I breech-loading field pieces âfour for each of the
two batteries.
Light Battery A Is commanded by Captain R. W. Young and Battery B by
F. A. Grant. Captain Young Is a graduate of the West Point Military Acad
emy and formerly served In the Fifth United States Artillery. It is no sur
prise therefore to military men that his battery should rank so high in the scale
of efficiency. It Is likely that General Merritt may rind the Utah batteries of
light artillery highly acceptable for immediate service at Manila. Many well
posted people fancied that the War Department made a mistake when it di
rected the two light batteries of the Third Artillery to leave this station for
Chickamauga Park. It is particularly fortunate that Utah is able to reinforce
the artillery arm of the service at this time.
command the Manila expedition It would
be hard to find."
A GENEROUS GIFT.
Tobacco for All the Boys in
Blue on Land and Sea.
A generous gift, and one that will be
appreciated by all the men who serve
the country on land and sea, tomes from
the head office of the Blackwejl Durham
Tobacco Company in Philadelphia. Her
man Heyneman, the agent of the com
pany in San Francisco, was yesterday ad
vised by wire of the management's pur
pose to present every officer and listed
man of the army and navy and every'
member of the militia In camp with a
two-ounce bag of tobacco.
Immediately 3JGO packages will be pre
pared and sent forward by the Red Cross
Society for the soldiers and sailors who
started for Manila clay before yesterday.
The company expected to n*ke the dis
tribution before the ships sailed, but the
fleet got away before the firm was ready
with the tobacco, hence the goods will be
forwarded on the next steamer going out.
In order to supply all the men on the
Monterey. Philadelphia, Mohican and
other vessels of the navy and also to sup
ply the regulars and volunteers now here
and others coming it may be necessary
for the company to procure supplies of
Durham from their own customers in
California and pay the market price for
goods of the firm's exclusive manufac
ture Mr. Heyneman will make some ar
rangement for distributing the packages
of tobacco to the men in camp and on
board ship.
UTAH MOUNTED MEN.
Arrival and Reception of the
First Troop of Cav
alry.
"With the arrival of the First Troop of
cavalry last evening Utah has contributed
detachments from two branches of the
serviceâ artillery and cavalryâ for the
Philippine expedition, and It is a
dimvult matter to say which Is the finer
body of men.
The cavalry crossed the bay on the
freight steamer Transit at 5 p. m. and
landed at the foot of Second street,
eighty-four strong, under command of
Captain J. E. Came and Lieutenants B.
X. Smith and G. M. Kimball.
The troop is splendidly mounted, well
equipped and armed with Springfield
carbines and sabers. The Utah National
Guard had a fine troop of cavalry located
at Salt Lake, and when the call for vol
unteers came most of the guards en
listed. The uniforms and camp equipage
were turned over to the volunteers, and
when they rode up Market street it would
puzzle an expert on military matters to
tell thorn from regulars. The horses were
pass.ii upon by a board of army officers
before the troop left home and are a
handsome lot of animals. They stood
the forty-eight hours' journey across the
desert remarkably well, arriving here in
excellent condition.
All day yesterday the members of the
Red Cross Society worried about the
Utah cavalrymen. As they brought their
horses it was impossible to land them at
the Market-street ferry, so finally the
ladles arranged to send a supply of pro
visions down to the freight depot. A
committee accompanied the load and as
soon as the men .had unloaded their
linrsis and camp equipage from the cars,
which had been brought across the bay,
the Red Cross corps served coffee and
edibles in abundance, which were greatly
appreciated, as the soldiers-arrived so late
that there was every prospect of their
going to bed hungry but for the thought
fulness of the ladies.
After their meal cheers were given for
the Red Cross Society and "boots and
saddles" was sounded. The troop quickly
formed in line and started for Camp Rich
mond, arriving there at i< o'clock.
The advance of the troop was heralded
by saluting guns from the dome of the
stately Clans Spreckels building. Hear
ing the guns, vast throngs of spectators
nastened to Market street and cheered the
passing troopers.
It was quite dark when the troop
reached camp, but the troopers, after
F>icketlng their horses, pitched their tents
n short order and In less than an hour
a guard was established and the men en
tered upon the routine of camp life.
Their camp is pitched to the west of
the light battery and next to the French
Hospital. It was expected that the horses
for the battery would be shipped with the
cavalry mounts, but for some reason this
was not done, so the artillerymen will not
be able to have mounted drill for a few
days longer.
BIG MANILA HAWSER.
A Rush Contract Accepted by
the Tubbs Cordage Com-
pany.
Uncle Sam's representatives were treat
ed to a surprise by the Tubbs Cordage
Company yesterday. Three manila twelve
inch hawsers 200 fathoms long were re
quired for the warship Monterey, and
Admiral Klrkland was of the opinion that
it would take five or six days in which
to make them. "When the matter was
laid before the cordage company and the
manager was asked to specify a time for
the delivery of the hawsers, he took a
few minutes to consider and then agreed
to deliver all three of them In forty-eight
hours. In order to do this the works
will have to run night and day. and every
man will have to do his best, but the
management Is perfectly confident that
the works will sustain their character for
promptitude and good workmanship.
Nothing but the very best material is
to be used, and only the market rate for
such rope will be charged. The turning
out of this 3000 feet of twelve-Inch man
ila hawser In forty-eight hours will be
the quickest job ever done on the Pacific
Coast, and there have been few to beat
it in the United States.
The making of these hawsers settles all
doubt as to the manner in which the Mon
terey is to reach Manila. She will go
to Honolulu under her own steam, and
after coaling there will proceed to Manila
behind her manila hawsers. Her supply
of coal will be husbanded so that she can
cast off her tow lines at a moment's no
tice and shift for herself should an enemy
heave in sight.
The collier Brutus (late the Peter Jeb
Â«en) and probably the Iroquols (late the
tug Fearless) will accompany the Mon
terey, and either one of them could pick
her up and tow her along in an emer
gency. The Brutus, having 5000 tons of
coal "aboard, is the vessel that will stay
closest to the Monterey, and it will be she
that vili take her in tow at Honolulu,
wlille the Iroquois will stand by to act
in an emergency.

was to have gone on the drydock at
Hunters Point yesterday, but the repairs
to the Starbuck took longer than was ex
pected and the Zealaiulia will not bo
docked until to-day. Then she could not
secure coal at the refinery, so the sup
ply for her bunkers and hold will have
to be brought to Pacific-street wharf in
carts and transferred to the steamer from
there. It will probably be the latter part
of next week or maybe even later than
that before she is ready to start for Ma
nila.
SECOND MANILA. DETAIL
It Is Expected That It Will Sail
From San Francisco Inside
of Three Weeks.
General Otis, who has had charge of the
dispatching of the first expedition to
Manila, will to-day move his headquarters
from the Phelan building to Camp Rich
mond, where tents were erected yesterday
in the southwest corner of the grounds for
the accommodation <>Â£ blmseli and staff.
He will go to Manila with the second ex
pedition, which it la expected will sail
from San Francisco inside of three weeks.
How many or what truups this expedition
will consist of Is not yet known definitely.
This matter will be decided by Major Gen
eral Merritt, governor general of the Phil
ippines, who arrived in San Francisco last
evening ar.il registered at the Palace
Hotel. All future movements of the Phil
ippine expedition will be subject to the
orders of General Merritt. who will act
upon instructions from Washington.
Colonel James W. Pope, chief quarter
master on General Merritt's staff, accom
panied by his chief clerk. Captain T. S.
shea, arrived in the city yesterday and
at once set about the work of perfecting
plans to equip the troops destined for the
Philippines.
The Eighteenth and Twenty-third regu
lar infantry regiments are expected in
San Francisco within a few days from
Tampa, Fla. These regulars are being sent
to the Philippines in accordance with tha
suggestion of General Merritt, who seems
to nave appreciated the importance of tha
Manila venture and to have seen the nec
essity of having a fair proportion of well
disciplined and hardened regulars among
the invading army.
Colonel Hawkins. Tenth Pennsylvania
Regiment, received a telegram yesterday
informing him that the sum of $10,000 had
been deposited in the First National Bank
of San Francisco to pay the troops of his
regiment.
The Seventh California Regiment has
received all the supplies necessary to
complete the regimental equipment.
Detachments of Batteries A and D,
California Heavy Artillery, will take sta
tion at Camp Richmond to-riay. Twenty
flvo men from each of these batteriea
went with the first expedition to Manila,

THE SECOND CALL.
rHE war horizon widens. The extent of the
struggle and its duration increase as the respon
sibilities of the country transpire.
v oiunteers are the interesting raw material out of
which soldiers are made by discipline and drill. We
lift our hats to the regulars. Their exact movement,
their precision in the manual of arms, their instant
conception of the meaning oi orders and their prompt
response, all thrill our enthusiasm and rouse our ad
miration. But every regular was a volunteer once.
He had to be trained into the attitude, step and con
fidence of a soldier. He is the example to be followed
by the raw recruit. His carriage, habit of self-control,
contentment in hard marches and harder camps, are
all before the voiunteer as stakes toward which he
must train.
The training takes time. During the Civil War
great camps were maintained for the toughening of
the new regiments, and from them the drilled and dis
ciplined men faced to the front and marched away to
replace the losses of war.
At this time the 125.000 men first called for will be
forced to fight with but little preparation. The peopJe
are always impatient. They want battles going on and
require the enthusiasm of victory or the rage and
fury of defeat. War is a tragedy, and the audience de
mands that the movement on the stage must have no
lapse nor lull.
So the first call goes at it almost fresh from farms
and shops. The second call is a very wise move.
The men who respond will have some time for drill
and feeding of their martial ardor on news from the
front. They will be hardened and seasoned physically
and when unleashed will hear the long roll with no
emotion but pleasure that the time for action has
come and that the}' are ready for it.
It is probable that by the time this call is full a
third will be made and for the same reasons and pur
poses, and that within six months we will have half a
million of men under arms.
It is jost as well that, the necessity having ap
peared, we make the most of this demonstration of
our military strength and capacity while the world
sits as an audience. In the rush and emotion of war
the cost is not counted. The gain is uppermost, and
as a rule that exceeds all cost. In the final analysis
the foundation of all government is force, and a war
gives the opportunity to test that foundation. It
shows just what blow the country's united and
aggregate arm can strike, and the stronger it is shown
to be the stronger is the Government.
The country will meet all calls upon it. and, be the
war brief in duration or prolonged, the martial in
stinct of our people and their love of adventure will
supply the ranks to the end.
Coal is now a contraband of war, but what is to
prevent the Examiner from furnishing Admiral Cer
vera with a big load of the "monarchs"? The cre
matory here has demonstrated that they will burn,
and, while, the smell is far from pleasing, Cervera
would doubtless be glad to get them, coal not being
available. The Examiner could also by this means
further increase its circulation, and at even a more
rapid rate than it is now doing with the aid of the
crematory.
The two children at San Diego who discovered
that their father after killing his wife had committed
suicide, and who then went to bed and slept soundly
through the night, cannot be considered to have
highly nervous organizations. Some children would
have been scared.
In all probability a Spanish offer to free Cuba on
condition that the Cubans fight the United States
would not be seriously considered. In the first place
Spain would have to give a bond, and she is known
too well as an all-around liar to be able to do this.
Perhaps there is no wonder that the yellow cor
respondents should dream of seeing fleets of battle
ships, but having awakened it is not fair that they
should put their visions on the wire.
It is gratifying to observe that an c\ r ening contem
porary has begun to discover signs of merit in the
magnificent ships turned out by the Union Iron
Works.
Many authorities are advancing plans for the de
struction of the fleet of Cervera, but all overlook the
absolutely essential feature of first ascertaining where
it is.
Another little Spanish crisis seems to have arisen
because the new Ministers do not see any pay in
Eight.
THE CHARTER ADOPTED.
BY the vote of yesterday the people of San Fran
cisco have given their assent and approval to
the new charter, and the long struggle for an
organic law different from the complex consolidation
act has received a partial solution. It cannot be called
a complete solution, because the document voted for
will have to be amended in many respects before it
can be made a practical system of municipal govern
ment, and many sections will have to be submitted
to the Supreme Court before their meaning or even
their validity can be made certain.
While the adoption of an act of this kind as the
charter of the city is to be regretted, it is not diffi
cult to understand why the people favored it. Discon
tent with the consolidation act is of long standing and
is well founded. So often have the evils of it been
pointed out that the majority of voters who take an
interest in such matters have evidently reached the
conclusion that any change would be for the better,
that nothing could be worse than the present form of
government, and that the proposed charter, with all
the imperfections which have been shown to exist, is
worth trying at least as an experiment.
In addition to the general discontent with the con
solidation act there has been a further discontent with
the incessant recurrence of charter discussions and
charter elections. Many men xyoted for this charter
without giving it serious consideration simply because
they desired an end of the charter-making issue.
Finally, the recent scandals involving the Board of
Supervisors and the School Trustees, the defalcation
in the city treasury and the inefficiency displayed in
the management of streets and other public works,
have all incensed the people and rendered them more
than ever willing to vote for ar^-thing which prom
ised a different system of local administration.
The feature of the election most to be regretted is
the smallness of the vote. The new charter has been
adopted, but not by a majority of the whole number
of the citizens. Only about one-third of the voters
of the city thought it worth while to go to the polls.
We have, therefore, to face a new charter which pro
vides a form of government radically different from
any with which we have had experience imposed
upon the city by the votÂ« of hardly more than one
filth of the voters whose property and whose welfare
is to be affected by it.
While the lack of a full vote can be accounted
for only upon the ground of a widespread popular in
difference to municipal affairs, it is not right to as
sume that all who did not vote were among those
lacking in civic patriotism. The closing of the polls
at S o'clock in the afternoon undoubtedly had the
effect of depriving many workingmen of the privilege
of voting. It has been the custom with us to keep the
polls open until sunset, and believing this rule would
be followed yesterday a considerable number of men
postponed voting until after the closing of their shops
and places of business at 6. When they went to their
polling places they found the polls closed and their
franchise forfeited. So large a number of voters
among the workingmen of the city were in this way
deprived of voting that it will be difficult to persuade
the public that the charter advocates did not deliber
ately plan the early closing scheme with the precise
intention of shutting out as many votes ?.s they could.
THE JOURNEY OF THE OREGON.
BY her successful voyage around South America,
confronted at almost every moment in the lat
ter portion of the journey by the possibility of
an attack from a Spanish squadron, the Oregon has
accomplished one of the triumphs of the war. Her feat
and its effects are hardly less important than the
achievement of a considerable victory in battle. It
has strengthened our fleet in the Atlantic and has de
monstrated that a battle-ship is capable of making
the longest ocean voyages and can operate with vigor
wherever required.
While the exact course pursued during the latter
portion of the voyage and the exact date of her ar
rival at Jupiter Inlet have been kept secret by the
Navy Department for obvious reasons of war, enough
is known to justify the estimate that the speed at
tained averaged upward of 200 miles a day, and pos
sibly more. This record is one that has given the
highest satisfaction to naval authorities and is a mat
ter of no little pride to Californians at Washington,
inasmuch as it clearly proves the excellence of the
ship-building of our workshops.
The general rejoicing over the accomplishment of
the Oregon ought not to lead us to overlook, how
ever, the risk of the voyage or the length of time re
quired to make it. What has been so successfully done
during a war with Spain could hardly be repeated
in a struggle with any first-class naval power. The
more important lesson to be learned from the event
is the need of the construction of the Nicaragua canal.
The very fact that our Government and our people
are so rejoiced by the safe arrival of the ship is a
proof that no such voyage should ever be required of
an American battle-ship in any future war.
OBJECT TO THE SLOGAN.
A SECTARIAN gathering back in Massachusetts
has forwarded to the Secretary of the Navy
a protest against the slogan, "Remember the
Maine." They object to it as not indicative of a
benign spirit of peace, and if fraternity and esteem
should characterize a war cry, doubtless the objection
is well founded. However, when nations meet in
deadly conflict there is apt to exist between them an
inimical prejudice, and if they were to adopt as a
rally something like "Love your enemies" they might
be accused of insincerity.
It seems to us that "Remember the Maine" is a
pretty good slogan. It is comforting to ascribe to
this country the loftiest of motives, but the motive
of at once punishing a crime and sustaining the honor
of a flag repeatedly assailed is far from ignoble. The
truth is that the United States has taken up arms be-
cause the Maine is remembered â to have forgotten it
were a shame â and whatever else may be in view
must be considered as collateral.
There was sympathy for the oppressed of Cuba, but
oppression could have proceeded until famine had
killed the last Cuban before there would have been
more than a moral interference, and such interfer
ence would have been wasted. Now the scheme v has
broadened and the results are to be far-reaching, but
the seed from which hostilities sprang was the shat
tered Maine sunk treacherously in Havana harbor.
Let the boys remember it. Soft words and goody
goody sentiment have a place, but it is not on the lips
of soldiers at the forefront of strife.
Probably there is nothing in the rumor that Spain
intends to send more ships to Havana. That country
is having trouble enough without actively planning
hara-kiri.
Senor Capdepon likens his nation to a brave duel
ist. The figure does not seem apt. Few brave duel
ists demonstrate their courage by skulking behind
the trees
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 27, 1898.
GEN. MERRITT'S RESPONSIBILITY.
CERTAIN statements reported to have been
made by General Merritt in regard to the Phil
ippine expedition, together with his known ob
jection to venturing upon that campaign with the
force originally designed, have subjected him to
more or less severe criticism on the part of a con
siderable number of newspapers. It has been charged
that his action savored of insubordination, and that
he has set a bad example to the army under his com
mand by even hinting at an objection to obey orders
and go wherever commanded.
The criticism is ill founded. The duty of unques
tioning obedience does not apply to a commanding
officer on whose foresight and military sagacity de
pend the lives of his soldiers and the cause of his
country. On him rests the responsibility of success
or failure, victory or defeat, and that responsibility
not only gives him the right to weigh and consider
every circumstance and detail of the movement he is
to undertake, but imposes it upon him as a high duty
to see to it that the force and the equipments pro
vided for the work are sufficient to accomplish it
without taking desperate chances in the hazard of
war.
General Merritt is not a subordinate officer. He
j is not one of those who have no right to criticize the
I conduct of war. He holds a higher rank than any
j other West Pointer in the service. He has been
chosen to command an expedition which is to take
thousands of Americans to a far off land, separated
by a wide ocean from their base of supplies, where
they will find themselves surrounded by an alien pop
ulation of millions of more or less warlike people.
Under such circumstances he would have been lack
ing in a sense of the responsibilities of his command
if he had gone at once without taking account of the
dangers and difficulties before him and the means by
which he could overcome them.
It will be remembered that when at the outbreak
of our Civil War General Sherman said ioo.ooo men
were needed for the Army of the Ohio alone he was
regarded as a crank. Such a statement on his part
was considered a criticism on the conduct of his
superiors and came near resulting in his retirement
from the service. The event proved that he was
right. In the end more than 100,000 men were found
necessary to drive the Confederates out of Kentucky
and Tennessee.
General Merritt, in demanding a larger force for
the invasion of the Philippines than was at first as
signed him, was clearly as much in the right as was
Sherman in 1861. The Government at Washington
has itself acknowledged the justice of at least one of
its claims, for it has increased the strength of the
regulars in the force from 1000 to 5000 men. Doubt
less other of his representations will have equally
good results, and the Philippine expedition will go
out equipped for certain victory and not as a for
lorn hope of daring and courage.
America has reason to be proud that she pos
sesses thousands of brave soldiers who go to the
front not counting the cost and careless of the con
sequence?. It is gratifying to have loyal heroes who
know that in times of danger it is "theirs not to rea
son why, theirs but to do and die." Nevertheless it
i<= also good for America that she has generals who do
count the cost and are not careless of consequences.
Rash critics who stay at home may shout "On to
Cuba" and "On to Manila" with Impunity. They are
not going to suffer. The brave boys who are to make
the expedition, however, are fortunate in the fact that
they are to be under a comtrander who knows that
war is not a matter of romance and who will see to it
that they go to the front under conditions which will
enable them to do something more than die there.
COAL AND "COALING."
I^IIE other day several members of the Bohemian
Club sent a message to Sir Henry Irving, the
famous English comedian, in which they con
' gratulated him upon the prospects of a diplomatic
alliance between the United States and Ureat Britain.
Mr. Irving answered promptly that he hoped the as
pirations of the two peoples would soon be realized,
and then he added, "We shall coal together."
The humor of this will be understood and appre
ciated by all who have observed the course cf events
during the present war. Every dispatch from the
j front is loaded down with information concerning the
; coaling of the war vessels. Before Commodore
â  Dewey smashed the Spanish fleet in the harbor of
Manila he "coaled" at Hongkong. Admiral Sampson
I and Commodore Schley have done nothing but "coal"
ever since they began their ghostly vigil in the
Windward^ Passage. Admiral Cervera "coaled" at the
; Cape Verde Islands and again at Curacao. A great
i deal of the news that conies from the front concerns
the maneuvering of colliers, and occasionally we get
a minute description of how a Spanish or American
; ship "coaled" at sea.
In fact, thus far the war has been a case of "coal
ing" and burning coal altogether. Without coal it
appears the conflict would come to a speedy end. On
her trip to the Philippines the Monterey will "coal"
three or four times. In Congress "coaling stations"
are the burden of every legislator's thoughts, and if
we are to believe the Washington correspondents the
principal duty of Secretary Long and the Board of
Strategy is to get coal to the American ships. Coal
appears to be king.
It is not unnatural, therefore, that Sir Henry Irving
should say that in the event of an alliance between the
United States and Great Britain he will "coal" with
the Bohemian Club. Sir Henry has "coaled" with the
Bohemian Club before. On the occasion of his last
visit to this city the club consumed a large quantity
of "coal" in giving petit soupers in honor of the dis
tinguished actor. In case the alliance referred to is
effected perhaps he may come over here and "coal"
permanently. That would nÂ®t be an entirely unwel
come result of the war.
According to a Madrid paper the average height
of the American soldier is 5 feet 2. By the same
authority Colorado is a place in the State of Denver,
and St. Louis is located in "Missipa." These ex
cerpts from the knowledge-box of the editor are
quoted not for their intrinsic value, but to refute the
slander that the Spanish are not an intelligent people.
Suggestion has been made that a penalty be pro
vided for merchant vessels whose captains ignore in
structions and cross the mine fields. Perhaps to touch
off a mine or two opportunely would be as instructive
a penalty as could be devised.
There are some regulars on the way to this city.
When they arrive they will find the Red Cross women
ready to greet them. All soldiers look .like to these
great-hearted ladies.
It would seem that a real yellow paper is unable to
announce correctly even so small a matter as the
route to be taken by a regiment of soldiers from
their camp to the wharf.
A SENATOR'S VIEW OF AN ALLIANCE.
THE general policy of England is in accordance with ours; that is to say,
she wants open ports everywhere all over the world, and so do we. She
gives her colonies greater freedom than any other nation, and that, too,
is in line with our American idea. So far as we have sympathies with
the colonies of European nations, we certainly have more sympathy with
English colonies than with any other. So that, if the continent of Asia,
like the continent of Africa, is to be divided up among the European powers, it
ls more in accordance with our natural sympathies, as well as in line with
our material interests, for us to prefer that England should get the largest
share of it.
These are the closing words of an article prepared by United States Senator
William E. Chandler, in which he discusses the conditions arising from and
likely to be brought about by the war with Spain:
"The new feature in our international relations is already evident In tho
great change which has taken place in the feeling between England and this
country. This change of feeling is palpable in both countries. The way in
which the British Government has acted during the past few weeks, ever since
ou* dispute with Spain reached its culmination, has made a deep and lasting
Impression upon the American people.
"There has never been any very bad feeling between England and the United
States, except what has grown out Oi. what I may call the assumption of England
toward us of the tone and manner of the
uig orotner to the little brother. Eng
land, in times past, has been disposed to
Play the big brother. When we have
had a difference with her she has seemea
to assume to treat it, and to decide it,
not as if we were a nation of equal
power and dignity with herself, but as
if she, having that big navy of hers, waa
entitled to act on the big brother prin
ciple and say: 'We are going to have
it so and so, and you help it if you can.'
In order to get at a working basis
of alliance with the English, which this
war has brought into sight as a distinct
possibility, some method will have to be
found, of course, of deciding questions
between the two countries on some other
principle than that. It Is evident enough
that an alliance between the two na
tions, or, let us say, an understanding
between them as against the rest of the
world, would not last long if, whenever
a dispute arose between themselves,
.England were to assume, as she has
done on previous occasions, to settle it
by her ipse dixit. The big brother atti
tude will have to be given up forever.
And unless some other way of adjusting
differences between England and our
selves can be found the danger will be
i Zl e^ntually we shall ally ourselves

Z. V) *â })? other srr eat Powers of the
world, then all the other nations will
naturally find themselves in a sort of
conspiracy to act together to offset, and,
v possible, at some time to overmatch
England s supremacy. That undoubtedly
has been the recent tendency of things
nâ¢ â  j t Jl " as t)t ' en tne tendency.
in my mind, I confess, to look upon that as the natural order of things. But now
i, d â¢. 'luiteI uite strongly led in the other direction, to consider whether there
snouid not be an English alliance, or an understanding that would be equlva
and br hA â  ance> Det ween the United States and England, for certain large
r.,,/' AS K Umine that Wft can nrHt arrange a basis for a fair adjustment of dis
putes between England and the United States in such a way as would distinct
ly guarantee to this country absolute equality with England as a great power,
?h Â£ dlstlnct recognition of certain fundamental American principlesâ notably
tne Monroe doctrineâ l believe there are good reasons for such an alliance. There
is not merely our common language and the ties of race, but as regards inter
national questions there is a broad community of interests.
1 have no particular sympathy with the idea that every generation must
ana ought to have a war, in order that the courage of the nation may be pre
served and the sterner virtues of manhood be maintained. That is a theory which
nas been heid uy men of considerable eminence, who have believed that without
tne hard discipline of wars, occurring at more or less regular intervals, the
vinuty of a nation is in danger of being lost, so that its people will degenerate
intosoftness and weakness.
''Bin while I do not share this view of war, I note it as a curious fact that
in the past century and a quarter of our existence as a nation events have con
spired in such a way as to give u-s exactly one war to every generation
l tius, in the first quarter-century we had the war of the revolution; in the next
quarter-century the war with Mexico; in the third quarter-century the
war of the rebellion; and now, when fta last quarter was running to its close
without any war, lo and behold! we have this war with Spain.
"W hatever may be said about the blessings of peaceâ and assuredly they are
very greatâ it is undeniable that war, particularly when it is a war waged as
this one is, for what the nation believes to be a just and righteous cause, must
pave .iii enormous and wholesome tonic influence, bracing up not merely the
tower and physical but the higher and moral life of the nation engaging in it
Suppose, if you please, that this Spanish war were to come to an end now
and that no more fighting were to be done. It would have been a short conflict
with no great loss of life, and yet we would have already made not only a
great naval but a great military demonstration; we would have given ourselves
assurance, and, at the same time, shown to the whole world that we have a
mighty reserve power, both on land and on sea.
"We have made a demonstration something akin to the memorable grand
review that took place at the close of our Civil War, and which gave us a
spectacle on Pennsylvania avenue which, as 1 look back to it I feel was a
splendid object lesson as to the vital strength and resources of the Republic, and
was of incalculable value in its moi.il influence upon foreign observers. A sim
ilar thing is now going to nappen again. \y e shall put our 125.0)0 militia in line,
and whether we have to send them all t o the front or not. we shall, by and by,
bring them together in one great ass cm bly here at Washington, and the moral
effect of that as a demonstration of ooru r latent power aa a nation will be great
and valuable. The war may be too ssorth ort to require us to use this latent power
on which we have made the first callâ and tne shorter the war is the better we
shall be pleasedâ but even if it ends to- morroW( this demonstration of our ca
pacity for war on a great scale has bee n ma de, and its moral effect will remain.
â¢'Moreover, attention having been c. llled in a pointed way to our deficiencies
in military organization, in coast defe nses and ;n; n na val equipment at various
points, the country will now insist tha t tney P hall be remedied at whatever cost,
so that we shall never at any future ti me fl - nd ourselves taken by surprise or at
a disadvantage in facing any foreign co mp j ication
"This war Is a fortunate war in ma ny ways. i t comes at a good time and
under fortunate circumstances for us It j- s> ln mv op j n i oni going to save
several other bigger wars. If we na,j shown pusillanimity now we should
have taken our place as a second-clas s power with this extremely probable
resultâ that other nations, perceiving u s to be a second-class power, not willing
to light even Spain on a question invol ving . American principles and American
interests in the hemisphere, would nav fi taken advantage of the discovery to
embark in various ambitious enterprls ps of thejr own on this side of tne w-orld.
Emperor William might possibly. In s ucn an event have bought St. Thomas
and St. Croix; other powers might ha\- boupnt other American possessions;
England, without conquering v enezuei a mlght have purchased Venezuela, and
a whole series of similar acts might ha ye f olloWf . d on t he part of European pow
ers in this Western half of the world i f we had proved i n this exigency that

"The Monroe doctrine would thus ha ye been made to disappear, unless we had
been prepared to enter upon an armed contestc ontcst to prevent such action by these
great powers, a war with any one of ww n jenj en would have been much harder to
fight than this one with Spain. Hence i t ls qu ite dear to my mind that this war
is most fortunate, in this respect, at Wastâ that it will have the effect of pre
venting larger wars, which otherwise w,, u i,i have come upon us, unless we had
been willing, not only to give way to S pami |y U t to surrender our Monroe doc
trine.
"The Monroe doctrine is only inciden ta iiy touched by our action ln the case of
Cuba. The Monroe doctrine has alwa ys implied the recognition of existing Eu
ropean Governments in this hemisphere DUt on i y upon this conditionâ that any
European power having possessions her c which i\ grossly misgoverns we shall
feel it to be our right and duty to expe] P have never taken the position that
European powers already established h ore were to be driven out, but simply that
they should make no new establishments here, and, as a corollapy. that such ter
ritories and peoples as were already vn der their dominion should be well gov
erned.
"This exceptional attitude which we have taken toward Spainâ demanding that
she must go, bag and baggage, entirely out o f Americaâ is the only case of the
kind that can arise, because Spain is th c on ly European nation that misgoverns
on this side of the world. England doe s nn t misgovern her colonies; she holds
those of her colonies that are composed of civilized people capable of self-gov
ernment with their own consent, and. so f ar as I know, that is true also of
France and Germany. So that the reas on f or which we are fighting Spain, while
it bears incidentally upon the Monroe d oc trine, cannot possibly lead us into a
war with any other European power.
"This war is fortunate, too, in this, that, while Spain is not so powerful a na
tion as to make it prudent to avoid a Conflict with her, yet she is not so weak a
nation as to make her an unworthy antagonist, or one whose defeat will be an
inglorious thing in itself. Her strength and resources, and the extent of her na
val and military establishments, are not so small that we can be charged with
making a cowardly fight. Her expulsion by force from this hemisphere is, in
deed, no holiday affair.
"It is furthermore exceedingly fortunate that the United States goes into this
war not for itself, nor to gain anything for its own aggrandizement, but sim
ply to fight for friends and neighbors Yet another piece of good fortune for us
is'that things are so situated in Europe at this time that Spain cannot get any
help from the 'concert of Europe.' which, three or four years hence, she might
be able to get All the conditions of the time, and, it seems to me, all the cir
cumstances of the war. are in our favor. My feeling is that it is 'manifest des
tiny ' clearly indicated by these fortunate circumstances to which I have al
luded I think it will appear in histoiv, both as to its immediate outcome and
as to the far-reaching consequences of which I have spoken, as altogether one â¢>â¢.
the most fortunate wars in which rmy nation ever engaged. And the world may
well infer that if we will take such a stand and make such sacrifices for a
neighboring people, we would certainly fight for ourselves and our own inter
ests still more readily and resolutely."

Are ye truly free and brave?

Slaves unworthy to be freed?

Like red lava through your veins
For your sisters now in chains
Answer: Are ye fit to be
Mothers of the brave and free?
Is true freedom but to break
Fetters for your own dear sake.
And with leathern hearts, foriret
That we owe mankind a debt?
No', true freedom is to share
All the chains our brothers wear.
And. with heart and hand, to ba
Earnest to make others free!
They are slaves who fear to speak
For the fallen and the weak;
They are slaves who will not choose
Hatred, scoffing and abuse,
Rather than In silence shrink
From the truth they needs must think;
They are slaves who dare not be

MARCHING UP MARKET STREET.
The T'tah volunteers were given great
demonstrations all along the route to
San Francisco; there they were given
an ovation. No finer men have marched
up Market street than those from this
State, and none will. It is a pity they
did not have their horses with them
that they might have taken their can
non with them through the city, as there
is nothing looks so soldierly and warlike
as fully manned batteries moving along;
nothing so well symbolizes war as artil
lery.
But what a pleasure It Is to know how
enthusiastically the volunteers were re
ceived. It is the reception given to those
from all the States, and they are all
equally deserving of it. ir MT ,
In a few days the people of San Fran
cisco will have the pleasure of witnessing
the Utah troop of cavalry march up
Market street. They will present as sol
dierly an appearance as did the Â»rtiuer\ -
men. Not only are they good cavalrymen,
but they are horsemen on good horses.
They will receive the same ovation as did
the "batteries.â Salt Lake Herald.

i on duty at the ferry from 6 a. m., gave
: up their dinners 'Wednesday evening to
serve an expected carload of troops. With
the incoming boat only sixteen men ap
peared, recruits for the regular army
from Texas. They were all in nondescript
clothes, some hatless and others coatless.
and all moneyless, blanketless and bag
gageless. The good hearts of the ladies
were doubly touched, and they served
these men with even greater sympathy
â  than the better dressed troops, and they
! then loaded them with extra lunches and
furnished those wanting with hats and
, coats, because they knew how slow Uncle
Sam is in caring for his men. They even
raised car fare among themselves and
furnished a guide to the Presidio.
The PoPtofflee Department has fitted up
a postofllce box in front of the ferry Red
Cross rooms, and the Red Cross ladles,
in their sympathy for those left at home,
persuade the boys in blu* to inform their
people of their safe arrival.
Although there has been a comparative
lull in the movement of troops during the
past day or two, the Red Cross Society
has not been Idle. A stock of provisions
is kept on hand constantly at the ferry
headquarters and boys in blue are fed
there at all hours of the day. To the men
from the Interior States who have never
seen salt water, the harbor front is a
source of much Interest, and each day
hundreds of soldiers pass their liberty
hours on the docks. These men are always
welcome to the Red Cross headquarters,
and are fed by the ladies without charge.
NARROW ESCAPE OF THE RIDEOUT.
The Stern-Wheeler Was Ready to Start for the Klondike and the Steamer Tillamook Was
Alongside Ready to Take Her in Tow for Dutch Harbor, When a Fire Was Discovered in the
Hold. Luckily the Fireboat Governor Markham Was Close by and Saved the Rideout From
Destruction.
This is one of the most praiseworthy fea
tures of the work, for none of the men
have received any pay yet, and were it not
for the Red Cross they would cither have
to remain in camp or go hungry.
Caring for these guests will be the only
work in hand for the society to-day, but
to-morrow and Sunday will bring a" large
number of troops and plenty of hard
work. The Montana and North Dakota
contingents are scheduled to arrive, in ad
dition to the two regiments of regulars
from New Orleans. The society will out
do itself in the way of receiving the reg
ulars, for it has been stated that only
the volunteers would be cared for, as the
regulars were supposed to have had so
much experience and are so thoroughly
equipped that the ladies felt they did not
need their protection. This was shown to
be untrue when the two companies of the
Fourteenth arrived from Alaska. Officers
and men partook of the hospitality of the
society, and none appreciated it more
than they. But to effectually stop all
further talk the members are preparing
to give the two regiments en route a spec
ially cordial reception, and though they
are professional soldiers the men will
treasure this attention as highly as any
volunteers possibly could.
The splendid residence of Mrs. Alma E

of the Nebraska, Kansas and Minnesota
troops, but all were welcome. The hostess

THE RIDEOUT
NEARLY BURNED
Fire Started in the Cargo
in the Lower Hold.
A VERY NARROW ESCAPE
__â â â â
SAVED BY THE STATE TTJG GOV
ERNOR MARKHAM.
Everything Was Ready for a Start
for the Klondike When the
Fire Was Discovered by
the Cook.
The steamer Rideout, Intended for the
Yukon River trade, had a narrow escacie
from total destruction by flre yesterday
looming. Just as she was being got ready
to leave the wharf, the flames broke out
in the forward hold, and soon got a good
headway. Luckily the State flre tug,
Governor Markham, was in the same slip
as the Rideout, and she soon had a cou
ple of streams playing on the flames.
When the flre was subdued in the for
ward part of the steamer, it broke out
aft, and the vessel had to be partially
flooded before all danger was past. The
loss to vessel and cargo will be about
$4000, which is covered by insurance. Some
of the passengers will be the greatest
sufferers, as their baggage was destroyed,
and they will have to secure a new out
fit before they can start again for the
Klondike.
The Rideout was built at Stockton for
the California and Yukon Trading Com
pany, and was to have begun her voy
age to Dutch Harbor in tow of the steam
er Tlllamook yesterday morning. The
United Engineering Company attached the
vessel for $800, however, and the steamer
was further libeled for $100 more by one of
the contractors. These troubles were
straightened out and the Tillamook was
just putting her lines aboard preparatory
to beginning her long tow when the lire
broke out. Captain Dunham and his crew
tried their best to control the blaze, but
It was not until the Governor Markham
got to work that the flames were sub
dued.
An Investigation showed that the fire
broke out among the general cargo, and
those interested in the steamer think it
was incendiary. It will take at least two
weeks to repair the damages, and the
vessel will then start for the Yukon. Her
passengers axe twenty-five carpenters and
engineers who are going to Alaska in the
employ of the California-Yukon Trad
ing Company.
As soon as a thorough examination of
the steamer was completed by the under
writers, the passengers began getting the
baggage they had saved back on. board
again, and the carpenters began doing
â¢ what they could toward clearing up the
mess and getting things ready for the re
pairs. It is unfortunate for the com
pany that the fire broke out, as the Rido
out was to connect with the Morgan City
at St. Michael on that vessel's initial
run.
TALES FROM KLONDIKE.
Two More Men Lose Their
Lives in the Rush for
Gold.
The steamer Morgan City arrived from
Copper River, Dyea and Skaguay yester
day with a passenger missing. A. John-
I son was sick when he Joined the steamer
j at Cooper City, and he grew gradually
worse until Tyonook, Cooks Inlet, was ;
I reached, where he died.
The Morgan City brought the news of
j the death of William Niles, formerly of '
i Dutch Flat, at Sheep Camp. Niies and j
George Sharon started for the Klondike
about three months ago. All went well I
until they struck the trail. Niks was j
! taken sick, but held on until Lake Bennet j
was reached. There he could not go on,
and Sharon helped him back to Sheep
Camp, where pneumonia set in and he
died.
The North Pacific Coast Railroad Com-
pany has put an extra boat on at 12:30
p. m. between San Francisco and Sau
salito. It was done to accommodate the
poolrooms, which are now In full blast
across the bay. Some of the bookmakers
opened up at Colma, in San Mateo
County, while the others went to Sausa
lito. The betting public can get to Colma
every five minutes by the electric cars,
but hitherto they could only get to Sau
sallto at 11 a. m. and 1:45 p. m. This put
the Sausalito poolsellers at a decided dis
advantage so they interviewed General
Manager Stetson, and he ordered the
extra boat put on.
D. D. Wass, the well-known electrical
and marine engineer, starts for the East
to-morrow on a well-earned vacation. Mr.
Wass has had the fitting out of nearly all
the steamers that have been put on the
Klondike run, and he also fixed up the
electrical plants in the Australia, City of
Peking and the City of Sydney prior to
their starting for the East. Mr. Wass
will be gone about a month, but expects
to be back in time to meet his friends.

Miss Edmondson's School.
On Friday the pupils of Magnolia Hall,
Miss Edmondson'a School, 1606 Franklin
street, held their closing exercises before
a large and enthusiastic audience. They
gave a charming little play, "The May
Queen's Court," with so much attention
to elocution, costumes, dances and deco
rations that It was a decidedly pictur
esque and poetical production. The cast
of characters was aa follows.

A young gentleman, whose character is above reproach, prom?-
cent in the religious circles of a Pennsylvania village, an exhorter of
the M. E. Society there, Secretary of the Quarterly Conference, and
at one time President of the Christian Endeavor Society, has long
been a user of Ripans Tabules, and says of them : " They keep my
bowels open, they do not gripe, they do not parge, and I do not have
bad pains in my stomach any more, which I had, with dyspepsia and
constipation, for years â in fact, up to about three days after I began
taking the Tabules. There used to be some kinds of food my stomach
would sicken on â pork, for instance. I could not eat it without having
a distressed feeling. Now everything goes down, pork and greasy
food, that used to make me sick to think of. I always have a few of
the T abates in my pocket for use if occasion arises."

For the ten months ending April 30 the gold
movement of the United States was compara
tively as follows:
1896-97. 1597-98.
Â» â â¢.::.:::::::::'S:SIg Â«SS
The net gain this year is $S4 479.495. or $27.
301,807 more than the net gain last year. The ,
imports of silver were p.W1.988. Â«***?* JJT
259.119 last year, and the exports $40,601,490,
against $51,606,801 in 1596-97. The large influx
of gold into this country in the past two years
, has given us plenty and to spare.
THEY OWE US MONEY.
Europe Still Our Debtor to the Tune of
$100,000,000.
From Henry Clews' Financial Letter dated
New York, May 21, the following extracts are
made: "An Important element of strength
has been contributed by the monthly statement
of foreign commerce, showing a further large
increase in the creditor balance of our exter
nal trade. The April exports of merchandise
â how an increase over those of 139/ of $21,
778 000, or nearly 30 per cent, while the im
ports of goods exhibit a decrease of $1.. 400 000.
or nearly 45 per cent. While, for April, 1897,
there was an excess of Imports over exports
.amounting to 1:3.673,000, last month the ex
ports exceeded the imports by *43.602,000; so
that the April balance is $67,175,000 more in our
â¢favor than it was last year. This is a most
extraordinary movement. Of course, It is out
of the question for Europe to continue inde
finitely to pay these unprecedented balances

rent fiscal year, our gross exports of merchan
dise and silver amounted to $1,072,117,000; our
imports of the same items were valued at $.21.
f"2 000; which shows an excess of exports over
imports, for the last ten months, amounting
to $351,065,000. This balance has been set off
to the extent of 184,479,000, by net Imports of
gold- which leaves a remaining balance of
1466,586.000 to be liquidated from other sources.
The value of returned securities, our interest
payments and all the other debtor items com
bined cannot be supposed to at all approximate
these ires; and it therefore follows that,
even making extraordinary allowances for the
return of securities, a very large unliquidated
balance must still remain due to this country
Unly not less than $100,000,000. but more
likely a much higher sum. It may be reason
ably questioned whether any other country has
ever made such a brilliant record under like
conditions, and especially in the prospect of a
fore'gn war. In part settlement of this credit
balance we have taken back a very large
amount of securities without any bad effect
upon our home market."

Isobare, or solid lines, connect points of equal j
air pressure; Isotherms, or dotted lines, equal i
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied j
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy Wf-ather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north j
end couth along the coast, rain is probable:
but v;hen the "low" is inclosed with Isobars of I
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is lm- i
frr-bable. With a "high" in the vicinity of j
daho, and the pressure falling to the Call- I
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected j
In summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditlona will produce an
opposite result. __

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
BWW TORK, May 28.â The movement of
prices worthy of particular note In the mar
ket to-day was confined to a few special
stocks, ac was also a lame part of the ac
tivity It the trading. The majority of the
list was somewhat dull and neglected. This
was In part due to contradictory movement of
a few stocks that showed pronounced activ
ity, but also to some skepticism over the re
ported presence of the Spanish fleet In the
harbor of Santiago de Cuba and its conse
quent settling up. The tact of the matter
Is the market has been expecting for some
time a sensational naval victor}' and its failure
to respond to the more prosaic results of suc
cessful naval strategy Is a disappointment
to the bulls and gives some encouragement to
the bears. There were, however, very positive
elements of strength in the market which
served to lift prices at one time quitÂ© ma
terially above last night's close. The main
stay of the market was Rock Island, which
rose at one time 2% points. The approaching
meeting of the directors to act upon the divi
dend and the various rumors as to the rate of
the dividend and to the measures for the dis
tribution of the surplus were motives of the
buying. Little profit taking in this stock had
no small part in the final reaction in the mar
ket. Its early risf was suH>iemented by buy
ing lor London account or the international
Blocks and by commission house buying of the
grangers. 'ihe local traction stocKs enjoyed
their season of strength as well. Great North
ern preierred rose an additional 4 points, to 171,
a new high level on the accepted belief that a
distribution of new stock In the retirement
of the debenture bond 6ls Imminent. Real
izing in Rock Island and the traction weakun
pd the market and almost wiped out the earlier
gains in the general list. Net changes are in
consequence small.

of excitement In wheat, . but â¢ the actual trad
ing was. somewhat limited. The sentiment of
the crowd was unquestionably bearish, but the
proposition of Letter an* the j danger of bull
manipulation held the selling impulse in check
and as a consequence the business was light
In volume. Leiter took hold of the buying side
at the start, bidding May up to $1 75 and July
to $1 14%. This made the shorts In September
and December somewhat fearful that the
prices for those months might advance In sym
pathy and there was an effort to cover which
sent September up to 89c. Later the buying
operations of Letter were perceptibly lessened
and with the loss of this support and the un
favorable cables the market turned weak and
the bears began to show courage and acted on
their convictions. The market near the close
of the session became very heavy. Leiter con
tinued to hold May and June, but July got so
much too heavy for the lifting power which he
exerted in its favor, or so slippery In the end
from the melting around of September and De
cember, prices, that it went down in the me
lee. Texas was said to be offering new wheat
quite freely for early June shipment. The
great overshadowing fact kept In mind by the
traders was the magnificent crop prospects of
the world and especially east of the Rockies
in the United States and Canada, otherwise
sentiment would apparently have been all that
the most ardent bull could have desired. July
closed at $1 10, a decline of 2V4c. September
closed at &6V4<356%c, a net loss of 2%c. May
ranged between $1 70 and $1 75.
Bull support steadied corn for a while, but
this was offset by a lack of shipping demand
and the general disbelief In the theory that the
chances for the next crop have been as yet
Jeopardized to any extent by backward weath
er. The break In wheat also carried corn down.
July closed l@l%c lower.
Oats were in good demand and ruled higher
until the break In corn. July closed HOVio

they finally yielded Rome with grain. Pork

tend to show that a heavy fall of rain dam
aged low-grade Muscat raisins, the existence ot
which has had a depressing Influence upon the
market generally for some time past. In view
of the light consuming demand they have
largely been disposed of to winemakers, and
as supplies of sound fruit in California now
are scarce the I feeling amocg holders is very
firm. In this market. It is reported, reliable
goods have been gradually cleaned up by
steady, though small demands of consumption.
Latterly some speculative Interest has been
shown !>y buyers here, and it is Intimated that
large business might be done in s=tooK on spot
or to arrive at a shade below current quota
tions, but holders are usually willing to make
concessions in view of the limited supply of
sound raisins In all positions, and bids of any
less than figures quoted are rejected.

The circular of W. B. Sumner & Co. says:
"The Hide market continues about the same,
although there seems to be a 'tendency to more
activity In business and perhaps a trifle " better
prices. The sole leather trade is exceedingly
dull, but harness leather is active at very lib
eral values. There are only moderate stocks on
hand of wet salted hides, kip, veal and calf.
Dry flint hides, kip and calf remain the same,
as the prices on these goods are based on the
values obtainable in New York and Boston.
Horsehides are a trifle lower in value. Wool
and sheepskins are very quiet and very little
is being done In wool In this city. Tallow is
about the same, but with somewhat â¢firmer
values. Deerskins are of . ready sale at the

Any gifts of money will be acceptable,

as well as many shining dollars.

MAY CALL OUT THE CADETS.
Possibility That Governor Budd May
Need the Student Soldiers
of Berkeley.
BERKELEY, May 26.â Governor Budd
may rail out the student soldiers of tho
University Cadet Battalions to fill the de
pleted ranks of the National Guard. With
the sending of its second quota of nearly
2000 men, California's force of drilled sol
diers will to materially reduced. Men
will be needed to fill their places here at
home for the purposes of garrisoning the
various reservations that are likely to be
left without men on account of the trans
fer of the regulars to the front.
The university cadets, like the National
Guardsmen., can be ordered out by the
Governor 'or duty in any part of the
State. There is some question, however,
whether the Federal or State authorities
would have to equip them. The guns
with which they drill are furnished by the
National Government. Years ago the
cadets were called out and waited under
arms for some forty-eight hours, during
the trouble with the Modoc Indians.
Although they were equipped and ready
to march to the seat of hostilities, they
were never ordered to proceed. It is
probable that if the cadets should be
ctlled out now, tfceir duties would be^

MANY EULOGIES TO
J. C. MARTIN'S WORTH
QUIET CEREMONY IS HELD AT
THE HOME.
Bar Association Calls a Special
Meeting and Court Ad
journs to Attend thÂ«
Funeral.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 26.
The funeral of the late J. C. Martin was
held this morning at his late residence.
The service was conducted by Rev. John
Bakewell, rector of Trinity Episcopal
Church, and was very simple, the aged
rector reading the ritual in an impressive
manner over the remains of his departed
friend. A. A. Moore, J. P. Garlick, G. M.
Shaw, W. J. Robinson and Mr. Stevens
were the pall-bearers and carried the cas
ket from the house to the hearse. It was
taken to Cypress Lawn Cemetery, where
the remains will be incinerated.
A joint meeting of the Bar Association
of this county was held this morning In
Judge Greene's courtroom. There was a
very large attendance of attorneys and
the following resolutions were unanim
ously adopted and incorporated in the
minutes of the meeting:
Resolved, That the lawyers of this
county and this association learn with
deep sorrow of the death at the high
noon of his life and activities of our
late brother and companion, James C.
Martin. Although our brother filled a
larger field of professional labor than
Alameda County and had the Just fame
of sturdy work and brilliant effort be
yond the borders of the county or State,
he yet was ours anij one of us, and we
here at his home knew and loved him
better and more than did the more
casual acquaintance beyond the border.
He was a kindly, cheerful man. He
never saddened, but always cheered. In
the court room, in his office, wherever
met, he gave patient attention and cour
teous consideration. Close, careful, bold
and pertinacious in the trial of cases, he
did not seek to strain the law or facts;
took success with modesty and met de
feat with fortitude.
He v.as a learned lawyer, who, by his
research and industry, made labor light
to the Judges and made clear complica
tions most complicate. He was humorous
and alwayi lightened labor with Inno
cent Jest. H* was domestic in taste and
devoted to his family, a kind husband
and father, a faithful public officer and
a good citizen. We look with pride upon
his life, and sorrow for his death un
timely, and tender his family our sin
cere sympathy In their bereavement.
Resolved, further, That these resolu
tions be spread upon the minutes of this
association and that the same be pre
sented to the Superior Court of Alameda
County with a request that they be
spread upon the minutes thereof; and,
further
Resolved, That this association and
bar attend the funeral services of our
friend and brother, James O. Martin.
Resolved, That a copy hereof be cent
to the family of our deceased companion
and friend.
Eulogies were delivered by the de
ceased's professional partner, A. A.
Moore, Hon. William R. Davis, John R.
Glascock, L. S. Church and Judges Ells
worth, Hall, Ogden and Greene.

LIABILITY
FOR STRIKES
Damage Suit Hangs on
a New Point.
ELLIOTT WAS THROWN OFF.
HIS TICKET TO PLEASANTON
HAD EXPIRED.
Could not Return on Time Because
the Southern Pacific Railway
System was Tied
Up.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, May 26.
The suit of Samuel W. Elliott, which
was called in Judge Greene's court for
trial to-day, recalls the great strike of
1894. Elliott wants $20,000 and costs from
the Southern Pacific Company because he
was put off a train about a month after
the strike was off on his showing a lim
ited ticket which he had not used, but
which expired during the strike.
The case possesses many interesting
features, the chief one being, of course,
the liability of the railioad company,
which asserts that it was not in any way
responsible for the stoppage of its traffic
in July, 1594.
Elliott bought a ticket at Pleasanton
good for a return trip to San Francisco.
It was sold at a reduced rate and its time
was limited to three days. Before the
three days expired the strike was de
clared and Elliott could not use his ticket.
He took the creek boat to Oakland, the
electric car to Haywards, a bus to Nlles
and walked fourteen miles to his home.
"How was the walking?" asked Attor
ney Moore. "A good road?"
"Oh, yes." said Ellott, "good roadâ lt
was the Southern Pacific track."
About a month later Elliott went to
San Francisco and on his return he pre
sented the unused half of his limited
ticket to the conductor. It was rejected,
and, according to the complaint, the
plaintiff was "willfully, wantonly, mali
ciously and wrongfully assaulted, insult
ed and maltreated by the plaintiff and by
force of arms ejected by said plaintiff,
and while being ejected from said train
was beaten and dragged from the car and
cut upon the face and bruised about the
eyes and other portions of his body, and
by reason of said Injuries has been dam
aged in the sum of twenty thousand dol
lars."
The conductor that It Is alleged threw
Elliott off the train is "W. J. Martin, who
resided in the State till July of last year,
when he went to the Klondike, so his
testimony cannot be taken and no effort
was made to obtain his deposition, which
fact Is set forth in an affidavit filed by
the defendant. The Southern Pacific de
nies all the aliegi tions of the complaint
and says that af U r repeated requests to
leave the train had been made Conductor
Martin, "without beating and without
dragging the plaintiff, and without in
juring him, laid hands upon the plaintiff
and escorted him from the train."
A. A. Moore represents the defend
ant and George Lezynski and M. C.
Chapman appear for Elliott.

MOSS MAY
SOON BE FREE
Judge Greene's Decision
Is Rendered.
DECIDES FOR THE ESTATE.
THE TRUSTEE IS VOLUNTARILY
A PRISONER.
His Friends Must Now Step In
in Order That He May Be
Saved From Further
Trouble.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 26.
Judge Greene rendered a decision this
afternoon that will probably cause J. W.
M isa 1 voluntary stay at the City Prison
to terminate.
Several months ago Mr. Moss, who was
once a wealthy real estate. dealer of this
city, went to Honolulu for the purpose of
avoiding a settlement In the estate of
Hannah C. Paine, deceased, of which he
was the executor.
On his return Mr. Moss gave himself
up, acknowledged his shortage and was
accommodated at the City Prison, daily
expecting that some charge or other
would be placed against him. This has
not been done, and for over six months
the old gentleman has had the freedom of
the dungeon. No charge has been made
aguin.st him, but, apparently having no
other place to so, he has voluntarily re
mained a prisoner.
After his return a suit was brought by
Public Administrator Knight against the
Central Bank for the recovery of $1027,
which it is alleged was applied by said
bank to the wrongful liquidation of Moss
personal overdraft. It was also alleged
that the defendant bank was aware that
the money so deposited was drawn from
! the Union Savings Bank on behalf of the
! estate of Hannah C. Paine and that the
' Central Bank knew it was money belong-
I Ing to the estate.
The defendant denied any knowledge or
i the ownership of the money, and the case
I was tried some weeks ago and left with
the court, so that the defendant's attor
neys might file further authorities in con
tention of their claim of exemption
from liability. This morning Judge
Greene rendered his decision, giving judg
ment in favor of the Public Administra-
I tor, who will thereby recover the sum
i sired for and interest, which is about half
j of the money for which J. W. Moss has
j to account. Â ...
He has been remaining in jail waiting
for a settlement to be reached, and as he
has many wealthy friends it is likely that
! the matter will soon bt- settled so that
Moss* freedom will not be in danger.

MRS. LEASE
A REFORMER
American Institutions
That Are Wrong.
â¢NOT AS SHE IS PICTURED
SHE IS WELCOMED BY A SMALL
AUDIENCE.
The Lecturer Predicts the Decline of
the Monroe Doctrine and the
Spread of American
Territory.
"The stupid, blundering public pay j
allegiance to the man with blisters
on his character, while it sneers at i
the man with blisters on his hands."
A quieter, more dignified lecture than !
Mrs. Mary Ellen Lease delivered "last I
night at the Baldwin, San Francisco, has i
never been heard.
Mrs. Lease, like all modern celebrities,
is a flat denial of the caricature of her
self the newspapers have made is familiar !
with. She fa tall, matronly, in a slender i
way, self-possessed, and rather graceful I

tlon of her political training 1b in the ris
ing intonation at the end of a period,
peculiar to campaign orators.
When the Kansas celebrity appeared
upon the stage, she invited the small au
dience to occupy the seats closer to the
Mage.
"Sorry there aren't more of us here to
hear you, Mrs. Lease," said a pleasant
voice.
"I'm sure of the quality of my audi
ence," she answered good-humoredly,
"however it may lack In quantity."
"The Signs of the Times' was the sub
ject upon which Mrs. Lease spoke for a
little more than an hour, seriously,
thoughtfully and at times elOQUenuy.
She quoted Spencer about America's
having more of the forms of liberty and
less of Its substance than any other land
underneath the sun. She spoke with dis
dain of the Now World's aping Old World
fashions and adoring Old World distinc- i
ticns when even Europe Is beginning to i
throw off the "embroidered rags of nobil
ity." She declared that the poor human
caterpillars on the worlds cabbage are
multiplying too fast for the cabbage it
self, that there is scarcely a. man in pub
lic life who has not preferred to serve the
syndicates than to work for the people,
that the corporations "which would once
have been satisfied with the bone, have
seized the dish and now devour the mut
ton; while the stupid, blundering public
pay allegiance to the man with blisters on
his character while It sneers at the man
v.Hh blisters on his bands."
Despite the gloomy picture the speaker
had drawn, she declared her reading of
the signs of the times to be that we stand
at the beginning of an evolutionary age,
of an era of conquest. She referred sar
castically to England's unseltLslin<-.ss in
proposing an American alliance, but she
favored it in view of a probable alliance
of the Latin races and in the hope of
checking Russia, for, with Napoleon, she
believes-: that "the menace to civilization,
the menace of all Europe, is the Cossack
of Russia."
"Hut the world." said the Populist ora
tor, "has been unified by electric nerves.
Just as in the physical organisms, with a
complexity of function, tht; nerve cells of
touch develop into those of si^ht, so m
the social organism our developing civili
zation shall bring about an awakened
soul sight. A new philanthropy is stir
ling the world. The United Slates, which
has dwelt 120 years in the old shell of im
maturity, has ;i future in which Wash
ington's farewell address has no place
"\\ c have outgrown the old skeleton of
the Monroe doctrine. In freeing Cuba we
pay the good old price of human blood
lor human liberty. Let not that blood be
ehed in vain. Retain the Philippines, Ha
waii, Cuba and let the American Bag
wave over Madrid it-
The audience had applauded vigorously
when Mrs. Lease declared that no woman
should dare to "waste her heart and her
affections on a poodle while children were
homeless and starving." It had received
her belief in one code of morals for men
and women. Hut it stirred uneasily at
her repudiation of our old policy and the
wide scope of her hop- s for our future.
"An ardent reformer? Yes," said a man
to his companion as they walked out of
the Baldwin; "so ardent a.s to be vision-
ary."
Visionary, and Mary Ellen Lease, the
practical politician, the enemy of ex-Sen
ator IncrallH. the advanced woman of the
humorous weeklies, which have elected
her to the chair of ridicule formerly oc
cupied by Susan B. Anthony! She doesn't
look like a visionary woman, and except
â for her peroration, which was more of a
picturespue prophecy than a belief con
fidently entertained, she doesn't talk like
one. The political experience whK-h has
made her name so wc-11 known, If that ex
perience has been really felt, must make
difficult her expressed belief In the coming
millennium, when the world "shall have
free access to the land, the heritage ,of
all; when men shall be spiritual, not ani
mal; when none shall want for work and
food'; when genius shall soar in peace and
content crown labor's brow."

Henry E. Hlghton, who is at present
occupying the session hours of Judge
Hunt's court In an endeavor to get judg
ment against E. J. Baldwin for $12,110, al
leged to be due as attorney fees, was
cross-examined at length yesterday. The
attorney accentuated his statements of

of labor Involved in the presentation of
the Baldwin side of the case instigated
against him by Lillian Ashley, and of the
Important legal matters he had attended
to for the aged millionaire. In all proba

EAGER FOH THE FRAY.
Regiments at Camp Richmon
Anxious for Service at
Manila.
Major Moore and Adjutant General
Berry of General Otis' staff visited Camp
Richmond yesterday afternoon and made
tin informal tour of inspection. They
were accompanied by George H. Rich
ardson, who hap Just been appointed act
ing assistant surgeon, and detailed for
examining duty to Major Robe's com
mand, the Fourteenth Infantry. His ap
pointment is the result of a request from
Major Robe.
Lieutenant Hunt, the recruiting officer,
reports that he is receiving applications
for enlistment in the Fourteenth faster
than be can have them examined. This
work has been done by the surgeon at the
Presidio, who has been rushed with work.
The work of enlisting the men will now
proceed more rapidly, and Major Robo
hopes to have all the recruits that he may
need Inside of a week. Captain Richard
son is ii surgeon of wide experience, hav
ing seen much service in India.
It was expected that General Otis would
establish his headquarters in the camp
yesterday and begin the brigade organi
zation, but he did not come out. His
tents will be erected this morning, and he
is expected to assume command of the
camp to-day.
Captain Mallory of the general's staff
was in camp yesterday and Inspected sev
eral of the regiments.
The question of what commands will
constitute the next expeditionary forre
to Manila is one that is causing much
speculation among the officers of the var
ious regiments. While as yet no official
orders baye been issued, it is the general
impression that the Seventh California
and First Colorado will be two of the
regiments chosen. Colonel Pope and
Colonel Llppincott Inspected the latter
regiment yesterday, and they also had a
conference with Colonel Hale. This is a
very significant fact, and it Is regarded
by the Colorado officers as a good omen
of their hopes.
There is some talk of the Fourteenth
being kept here for instruction purposes
for the volunteers, but it is not believed
that there is anything in the report.
The Christian Endeavor Society is
erecting reading and writing tents in the
various camps, which is a great conven
lence to the men.
One of the most notable commanders in
Camp Richmond Is Colonel J. w. Jones
commanding the Idaho troops. He saw
service through the late war as Captain
of one of the companies In the Fifty-sixth
Virginia Regiment, which was in Riek
etts' famous brigade. Colonel Jones
served with conspicuous gallantry, and at
Gettysburg he was one of the survivors
of the fatal charge up Cemetery Ridge.
In this charge he was within a few feet
of the heroic Garnett when that officer
was killed.
Colonel Bratt of the First Nebraska is
a.n officer of experience. His regiment
saw service in the Pine Ridge campaign,
and alpo distinguished itself in the
Omaha strike of 18S2. The regiment re
. eived its first pay yesterdaj-. Colonel
Bratt acted as paymaster. The compen
sation was from April 27, the time the
regiment was ordered out, until May 4,
inclusive, when it was mustered into
service. The cost of the services for which
were paid is borne by the State, as
they were acting in the capacity of the
National Guard, ordered out by the Gov
i-riiiir. As soon as they were mustered in
they were no longer at the State's ex
pense. Several cases of measles devel
oped in the regiment yesterday, but they
were at once quarantined, and Colonel
Bratt does not fear an epidemic.
The Kansas boys are the worst off In
the way of equipments, and many are
in" need of shoes and clothing. It is
expected that this regiment will receive
the first attention from the t quarter
master.
The Tenth Pennsylvania has caught the
crowd. Strict discipline Is the rule, and
the camp is excellently polished. The of
ficers have their own horses, which they
brought with them from the East.
The crowds continue to grow with each
day, and the lady visitors practically
keep the soldiers supplied with bon-bons
! and pies.
YOUNG PATRIOTS.
The Crocker Grammar Pupils
Comfort the Encamp
ment Troops.
The 600 pupils of the Crocker Grammar
, School showed their patriotism and good
! will for the soldiers at the Bay District
; track in a most pleasing way yesterday.
From their homes in the Western Addl
i tlon they came, laden with luxuries, to the
â ohool. There were boxes of fruit, glasses
I of jelly, great heaping stacks of cakes and
pies, besides other and various delicacies.
What could not be packed into the great
express wagon was carried by the en
thusiastic boys and girls in their arms,
and thus loaded to their limit they
marched from school to camp.
The good things were given mostly to
the brave boys from Idaho. It was a day
long to be remembered by the children.

BULLETIN
MAN BROUGHT
TO HIS KNEES
Rash Attack Upon the
Union Iron Works.
PENITENT, BUT TOO LATE
WOEKMEN EXPBESS THEIR AN
GER IN REBUKING HIM.
The Management Approves of Their
Course and the Editor Tries
Vainly to Excuse the
Stupidity.
A few days ago the Bulletin contained
an attack upon one of the ships made by
the Union Iron Works of this city. The
attack was so uncalled for and the allega
tions it set forth so entirely baseless as
to make people wonder why they had
been made. They are still wondering, and
the Bulletin is exercising every means to
atone for its stupidity.
But while the attack excited wonder
from the public, it caused indignation at
the Iron AVorks, and the employes, who
naturally felt that they had been insulted,
were swift to voice their sentiments of
disregard for their traducer. During the
noon hour of the day following the publi
cation there was a mass-meeting held by
the men. Edward T. Morris was elected
president, and speeches were made by
Messrs. Howard and Todd, in which the
Bulletin was excoriated for its assault on
the workmanship and design of the
Many facts were brought out at this
meeting:, some so familiar that even the
Bulletin might have been expected to
have knowledge of them. The designs
were purchased from Messrs. Armstrong
&. Co. of England, and were the same de
signs used in building two of Japan's beat
warships. The Charleston was built to
develop eighteen knots, and on her trial
trip made the official record of eighteen
and two-tenth knots for four hours, ful
filling the very severe Government test.
Since she has been in commission the
Charleston has made several notable
runs, among them t..e chase of the ltata
from San Diego to Valparaiso, and the
run from San Francisco to Hawaii bear
ing the body of King Kalakaua. Ihe
latter trip was made under forced draft,
and the ship amply proved herself to be
able to maintain her stipulated speed
For a long time she had the reputation
of having made the longest-distance run
under forced draft of any Government
Bh a S"all this, and that the work
manship was second to none, the mechan
ics who built her have taken a personal
pride in her career, hence the indignation
felt by them at the article published. A
resolution condemning the action of the
Bulletin was unanimously adopted, and as
the whistle blew the men returned 10
their work, fully determined to make it
warm for any paper daring to offer fur
ther affront. The Bulletin could have pre
sented some details, but has failed to
d Â°'AÂ°committee of nine, composed of
Messrs Cronln, Doyle Hightower, Jarvis,
McKenna, Telfer, Todd, Wimmer and my
self, representing the different - depart
ment's, said Edward T. Morris, "visited
Mr. Crothers, the proprietor of the Paper,
and demanded an emphatic denial of the
obnoxious article. Each one deling in
dignant that his special line had been
slandered, pointedly voiced his opinion on
the Bulletin and every one connected with
it and demanded an apology for the
slander. Mr. Crothers denied having had
any knowledge of the article until he saw
it 'in print, and said he had retracted
everything in Friday's edition.
"In that article he retracted all that had
been said against the Union Iron Works
and the mechanics engaged in the con
struction of the Charleston, but reiterated
that the plans of the ship were faulty.
The committee maintained that the plans
were not faulty; that the Charleston was
equal Inherclass to any cruiser afloat, and
that she had always given a good record of
herself. They denied as American citizens
the right of Mr. Crothers or any one else
to defame the Charleston or any other
ship flying the American Hag such critical
times as these. He was told that he was
more fit to go to Spain than to stay here
under the stars and stripes. ....
"When the committee reported back by
placing a notice on the bulletin board the
men were somewhat appeased by its
apology and retractionâ still they felt
that a wrong had been done which could
never be righted. Many have stopped
their subscriptions to the paper, and the
feeling i niong them is so strong that it
is safe to say that Bulletins will not be
seen around the Union Iron Works for
some time to come, unless possibly a.a
wrapping. ' â . , _ â¢
"As an Instance of how we feel I can
only tell you of an incident that occurred
at the time. Some of the little rivet boys
were heard talking after the meeting.
â¢Jimmy,' said one, 'I don't know what
we'se can do to boycott the Bulletin. .
"The other spoke up promptly: 'If we
i can't do anything else we will get in and
lick the newsboys who sell the sheet.' "
That the management of the works was
gratified by the prompt action of the men
is amply attested by a letter from . the
office, a' copy of which was posted on the
bulletin board, so that all might see it,
and which follows: â -,; ;; :.-.- â¢ ;
RAN FRANCISCO, May 21. IS9B.
Edward T. Morri6 Esq., president work
insmen'B meeting, held at the Potref-o, 12
M., May 20 â President and fellow work
men: It was with exceeding pride and
pleasure that I read the account of your
meeting held to protect the honor and dig
nity of California mechanics, and the pres
tisti- of the old I'nton Iron \Yorks.
Had I known that you contemplated the
meeting, I should have been with you in
person, as I am always in heart and spirit.
The fact that the meeting was Instanta
neous, every man feeling that he had been
insulted in "the malicious article published
In the evening paper, and was there ready
to resent it, 1b the harbinger of a better
era. That you. fellow mechanics of the
Vnlon Iron Works, who have so long stood
by your colors, realize that the place
where you earn your dally bread, and are
enabled to suppnrt your family in honor
and integrity, with a suitable wage, is
worth protecting and fightinpr for.
You have never failed In time, nor In
skill, nor In the results which the contracts
called for, nor in anything that has been
entrusted to your rare, during the thirty
eight years that It has 1 bÂ»en my privilege
to be the general manag-er of the Union
Iron Works. Ton have fulfilled every con
tract entrusted to your execution, and we
on our part have never missed a single pay
for the Bpac<> of one moment In all that
time. Wp have improved our facilities, fol
lowing the highest sanitary laws and the
most elevated and approved conditions re
garding the welfare and comfort of you all.
During this time the works have grown
from the employment of twenty-two men
to 3200, feeding more than 10.000 mouths,
and this plant Is one o( the established,
far-reaching and most complete Industries
of the entire Pacific Coast, with a world
wide reputation, competent to plan, build
and operate battleships, cruisers and fight
ing machines; callable of protecting the
honor of our country's ila^, which your
work is now doing with credit on the Atlan
tic, on the Pacific and In the Orient, with
the eyes of the world watching it. In
stead of calling upon the Nntlonat Gov
ernment to protect us, the National Gov
ernment depends on our resources, of
which, fellow-workmen, your skill Is an
important factor, and you did right to re
sist iiny imputation or reflection on it.
I therefore thank you with all my heart
for this expression of loyalty to the
works, while at the aam> time asserting
your own dignity, protecting your man
hood and holding aloft full high the banner
of your splendid mechanical achievements,
and" henceforth I hope you will not allow
any aspersions to be cast, either by infer
ence or direct charge, upon your integrity
or the character of a California mechanic.
May you in the future achieve still higher
renown than you have in the past. May
prosperity and success be the share of each
and every one of you. freemen of this
great republic. Knowing I express the sen
tbnenta of the entire company, respectfully
yours. IRVING M. SCOTT.
Meanwhile the Charleston speeds away
toward Manila with supplies for gallunt
Dewey, whose flagship Is the Olympia,
another product of the Union Iron Works.
The Oregon, which was made ut the same
place, has lent to Atlantic squadrons a
strength of which need had been felt.
And meantime the Bulletin on its editor
ial knees begs forgiveness and makes
known that it is consumed of remorse.
But about the Union Iron Works it cii
culates no more.

ment in Aid of Soldiers.
The grand concert given by the Knick
erbocker quartet at the Young Men's
Christfan Association Auditorium last

noble cause of assisting the boys in blue.
The little hail was more than comfort
ably filled and the programme presented
was far above the ordinary.
As every effort had been made by the
members of the church to arrange a fit
ting entertainment, much credit was due
them, the appreciation of which was more
than manifest in the box-office at
the conclusion of the programme. Many

were in attendance, who one and all re

who treated them as their most welcome
guests. The programme for the evening

A SMALL MAJORITY FOR THE CHARTER.
THE TOTE
POLLED
WAS LIGHT
Significance of the
Tabulated Returns.
WORKINGMEN WERE BARRED
POLLS CLOSED EARLY AND
CAUSED COMPLAINT.
Districts Where Small Property
Holdings Are Situated Gave
Majorities Against the
New Organic Law.
San Francisco is to have a new char
ter. Such is the decision of a majority
of the voters who had sufficient inter
est in the present and future welfare
of the city to go to the polls yester
day and cast their ballots for or
against the adoption of the proposed
organic law.
The result was decided by about one
fifth of the voters of the city, a fact
that does not speak well for the public
spirit of the citizens of San Francisco
in a matter that Involves the very life
of the city. It Is, besides, unsatisfac
tory because it leaves in doubt the
question as to the real wishes of a ma
jority of the persons who are immedi
ately affected by the question in issue.
The total vote cast yesterday was
26.963. Of this number 14.386 were for
the charter. 12.025 against It, and 552
scattering. The charter was carried
by a majority of 2361 votes.
The small number of votes cast
proved a surprise both to the friends
and opponents of the charter, and to
account for it several reasons are al
leged. One of these is that the great
public interest that has been taken
In war news has to a certain extent
served to divert attention from the im
portance of the local issue. People
who would otherwise have studied the
provisions of the proposed charter were
engrossed with the fortunes of our sol
diers at home and abroad, and did not
find time to become partisans in a
cause that appeared to be overshadow
ed by the greater events in national af
fairs. Many working-men were unable
to cast their votes because the polls
closed so early that they were unable
to reach the voting booths in time.
Many complaints were heard on this
score and it is estimated that at least
5000 voters were prevented from cast
ing their ballots for this reason alone.
It Is a significant fart that In the dis
tricts where the greatest number of
small property holdings are situated
the majority nf the vote cast was
against the adoption of the new char
tor. The districts that returned a ma
jority against the charter were the
Twenty-eighth, Thirty-first, Thirty
second, Forty-third, Forty-fourth and
Forty-fifth.
With the exception of one or two
incidents of minor importance the elec
tion passed off quietly. To a stranger
In the city the fact that an important
election was in progress would never
have been suggested, so little did the
proceeding-? of the day interrupt the
ordinary routine of business. Even the
few stragglers about the polling places
were dull for want of an occasional in
cident to enliven the dead level of the
day's proceedings.
The work of counting the ballots pro
ceeded much faster than was antici
pated. It was generally believed, judg
ing from the slow manner in which the
ballots for Freeholders were counted,
that some of the outlying precincts
would not have their returns in before
11 o'clock. The men lost no time, how
ever, in getting through with the work
when the polls closed. An hour after
the balloting stopped the officers of
several of the precincts were on their
way to the Registrar's office with com
plete returns. About 7:30 o'clock the
returns came in thick and fast, and
the deputies In the office were kept on
the jump. Everything was handled
with dispatch, and two hours later the
returns were in from all the precincts
WEST BOUND
FREIGHT RATES
ADVANCES WILL BENEFIT
COAST MERCHANTS.
Freight Traffic Manager William
Sproule Speaks of the Trans
continental Meeting.
William Sproule, freight traffic man
ager of the Southern Pacific Company,
returned last night from Milwaukee,
where he had gone to attend â¢ the meet-
Ing of the Transcontinental Freight Bu
reau Association, and when seen at his
office to-day, said: "The results at the
Milwaukee meeting have been entirely sat
isfactory to the Pacific Coast merchants
In the adjustment of freight rates, and
â¢will prove of incalculable benefit to them.
The changes made were in the nature of
an equalization so as to bring about a
reasonable difference between carloads
and less than carload rates, westbound.
Heretofore the local merchants have en
deavored to bring about an increase of
freight rates from Eastern points, but it
has been rather by antagonism to than
co-operation with the railroad companies,
that they have sought to bring about
the desired result. When the transconti
nental meeting transferred its base of
operations from Monterey to Milwaukee,
a howl went up immediately that It was
done with the Intention of keeping our
merchants away on account of the dis
tance. But the very distance caused them
to take heroic measures and send repre
sentatives, who were well received by the
bureau, and weTe treated In every In
stance with favorable consideration. By
using proper tactics the merchants have
gained -all material points. Among the
gentlemen who appeared at the meet-
Ing were such prominent citizens as Mr.
Guggenheim, of Mack & Co., Arthur
Towne and Mr. Loveland, of the Associ
ated Groceries; George H. Tay .Mr. Rulof
son, of Baker & Hamilton Mr. Wheeler,
the executive head of Holbrook, Merrill
& Stetson; Mr. Scott, of Miller,. Sloss &
Scott, besides Mr. Hart of Portland : Mr.
Reynolds of Los 'Angeles, and Mr. Brace
Hayden, of Dunham, Carrigan & Hayden.
When these gentlemen asked for a hear
ing they were given an afternoon.. to state
their . grievances. There â  were , seventeen
altogether from < this coast, representing
all Tines of trade. ; The ? delegates \ from
Eastern jobbing houses were represented
by a - delegation not quite â¢so '' numerous,
consisting of \ the -president of the Mil
except two. Messengers were dis
patched to hurry up the officers and at
10 o'clock complete returns were in. It
took the clerks but a few minutes to
foot up the totals, and at 10:15 the work
of tabulating was completed.
The main office of the Registrar was
crowded by Interested citizens early in
the evening, but they left soon after the
first returns came in showing beyond
doubt that the friends of the charter
had carried the day. Colonel W. P.
Sullivan, Gavin McNab and Max Pop
per were particularly pleased with the
result, and the usual number cf
"Didn't I tell you so?" stories were re
counted.
The official canvass of the tally-sheets
may show some slight errors, but the
totals will not be changed fifty votes
either way.

A QUIET ELECTION.
A Light Vote Polled, and Little
Enthusiasm Shown at
the Booths.
The election passed off quietly in the
Western Addition. Not an Incident of any
note happened and except for the small
crowds that gathered around the booths
a stranger would not have known that an
election was in progress. Very few chal
lenges were interposed, and then only
under what might be termed facetious cir
cumstances.
At the polling places on Polk street,
near Hayes, an old man entered the booth
waukee Business Men's League and offi
cials from the Chicago and St. Louis
Traffic Association, and they were given
the forenoon to state their side of the
case. After mature deliberation, the bu
reau decided In favor of granting the con
cessions asked by the Pacific Coast, and
as much protection to California's inter
ests as could be granted without prejudice
to the public and the carriers' interests
were given.
While the new tariff schedule contem
plates an advance in westbound rates In
less than carload lots in almost every
particular, it also applies to certain com
modities in carload lots. There has been
a noticeable Increase in the rate on dry
goods. Where the old rate wa.s $1 50, it
will be under the new tariff $2 20. an in
crease of 70 cents a hundred pounds. Dress
goods In cases, raised from $1 50 to $2 w);
in bales, from ?2 25 to $3. Earthenware,
from $1 30 to $1 50 in less than carload
loads, and in carload lots, from $1 to $1 75.
Brass goods, from $1 to $1 50. Bar iron,
from $1 to $1 25. Canned goods, raised
from 85 cents to $1 by the car.dad, and
from $1 to $1 50 in less than carload lots.
The following are the westbound terminal
class rates, the first figures being accord
ing to the old tariff, and the second those
of the new tariff: Class 1, $3â2 40; class
2, $2 60â2 50; class 3, $2 20â2 00; class 4,
$1 90â1 70.

LEE FAT WILL NOT HANG.
Jury Found Him Guilty, but Fixed
the Penalty at Imprisonment
for Life.
I*ee Fat, who stabbed Lee Tong, a fel
low-countryman, to death at the corner of
Washington and Stockton streets last De
cember, will not hang for his crime, but
will remain in prison the rest of his days.
The case of the prisoner was concluded
yesterday noon and at 2 p. m. the Jury
was charged and retired to deliberate on
a verdict. Ten minutes later it returned
and filed a verdict of guilty of murder in
the first degree against the prisoner, but
fixed the penalty at life imprisonment.
Lee Fat was lucky to escape the gal
lows. He was caught red-handed at the
time of the murder. His attorneys, B. L.
MoKinley, B. B. Harrington and D. C. B.
McCarthy, put up a strong fight for their
client, however, and saved his neck. The
convict will probably be sentenced a week
from Saturday.

and proceeded to cast his ballot. On be
ing questioned by one of the election offi
cers he became belligerently indignant
and threatened to clean out the place.
"You can't monkey with me," he shout
ed as he raised his cane over his head.
â¢'I did politics when you fellows were
kids."
Realizing that the old man meant busi
ness, no further obiectlon was made to
him depositing his ballot. As he left the
booth he turned around and laughingly
remarked that he was on to his job. and
did not propose to be "bunkoed out of his
The heaviest vote was polled up to 10
o'clock In the morning. After that the
voting seemed to lag. and it was not until
late In the afternoon that it again be
came brisk. The large quota of voters
from the various factories and workshops
visited the booths shortly before the polls
closed, and helped to swell the total vote.
The clerks had specific Instructions to ex
pedite the counting of the ballots, and be
fore 9 o'clock last night every precinct
In the city had been heard from.
The Mission District.
In the Mission some of the mechanics
and trades people who report for work at
7 o'clock took advantage of the fact that
the booths were opened before 6 o'clock
and many of them went to the polls and
voted while their wives were preparing
breakfast. At no time was there any
delay In the booths. It was but a matter
of a few seconds' work to stamp and fold
the ballot and see it deposited In the bal
lot box. There was a lull In the voting
after 6:30 o'clock and the election ofllcers
had nothing to do but kill time for the
next hour. Then came another small rush.
Business men and downtown clerks who
do not go to their offices until 9 o'clock
were surprised when they reached their
booths and learned that an average of
about 150 votes had been cast in each
polling place before they had thought of
geeting out of bed. After the second
contingent of voters was disposed of there
was another quiet spell. Some of the
booths did not average ten votes an hour
from then on until noontime. Then many
who had neglected to vote In the morn
ing stopped In at the booths on their way
home to lunch.
There was but little soliciting of votes
either for or against the charter around
the booths. The average voter had made
up his mind before leaving home just how
he Intended voting and he did not care
to listen to any further arguments. The
charter champions had representative*
around the polling places and so did those
who were opposed to It. It is safe to
say that neither side changed many votes.
A largo squad of policemen under Po
lice Lieutenant Price was kept on duty at
the Seventeenth street station, but they
were not required. There was not a sin
gle disturbance reported and only one ar
rest made at the station and that a plain,
common, ordinary drunk.
The Downtown Districts.
In the downtown precincts the electloi.
was as peaceful and quiet as a
holiday. The vote was exceedingly light
in every precinct and the majority of
ballots cast were deposited during the
early morning hours. By noon fully
three-fourths of the vote had been polled.
The only disturbance of consequence
took place In the booth of the Fifteenth
Precinct of the Thirtieth Assembly Dis
trict. During the afternoon a gang of
a half-dozen toughs, among whom were
several ex-eonvlcts. entered the booth and
announced their intention of running
things to suit themselves.
Ofiiccr Snndman, who was on duty,
warned the gang rot to attempt to carry
out their threat, but they only laughed
at the officer and proceeded to take
charge of the ballot-box. Sergeant
Hrophy happened along just at that In
stant and joined the patrolman in re
sisting the hoodlums. "Johnny" Smith,
who makes his headquarters at Sixth and
Harrison streets and is well known to
the police, was the ringleader, and headed
a vicious attack on the officers. They
were compelled to handle him pretty se
verely before they could handcuff him.
His friends attempted to rescue him, but
were speedily put to flight, and Smith
was locked up on charges of disturbing
the peace and battery.
When the polls opened there was a pro
test against the election officers of the
Eighth Precinct of the Twenty-ninth Dis
trict, most of whom were employes of the
city. They closed the booth and started
out to find* substitutes, one returning with
his father, another with his brother and
others pressing friends into service, and
these pelf-constituted officers served
throughout the day.
Aside from these affairs everything
passed off as quietly as could be expected.
Election Incidents.
Michael William DriPcoll, who gives his
occupation as a farmer, was arrested yes
terday morning in the First Precinct of
the Twenty-eighth District on a charge
of perjury in falsely swearing In his vote.
The complaining witness is Registrar
Blggy. who says the charge will be
changed to illegal voting In the morning.
Driscoll called at the Registrar's office
in the morning- He said he formerly lived
at 547 Howard street, but for the past
nine months he had been living at 200
Mission street. His answers to questions
aroused the suspicions of the Registrar,
and he was warned to be careful. In
quiry wa? made at the lodging house, 200
Mission street, and it was found that
Driscoll had not lived there for the past
nine months, but had been In Los An
geles. The Registrar sent a deputy to
the polling booth, and when Driscoll ten
dered his vote he was placed under ar
rest. His friends endeavored to get Judge
Low to release him on his own recogni
zance, but the Judge refused. The Regis
trar Is determined to make an example
of him.
Herman Schultz, a bartender In a saloon
on Ninth street, near Mission, was ar
rested yesterday morning for selling
liquor on election day. He was released
on $50 cash bail. This was the only ar
rest of the kind made.

CANDIDATES IN PROSPECT.
FEW PLACES, BUT NO DEARTH
OF ASPIRANTS.
The Sixth District Holds the Pen
nant for the Greatest Number
of Politicians Who Have
Ambitions.
With the prospect in view that a con
siderable period will elapse before the
holding of the Republican and Demo
cratic State conventions the natural in
clination of prospective candidates to
declare themselves is being held in
check in order that tIK-v may
themselves from the certainty of suf
fering from the combinations of politi
cal rivals. This condition of things is
particularly true as concerns the men
who will seek the Congressional nomin
ations in the various districts of the
State.
There are few among the present del
egation of California Congressmen who
will not ask to be returned to their
seats, and in a few instances it Is not
improbable that such expectations will
find favor in the minds of the voting
public. In the First Congressional Dis
trict, for Instance, John A. Barham
will seek re-election, and as yet no one
of prominence has come forward to op
pose his claims. The friends of T. H.
i Selvage of Ilumboldt have been trying
to induce that gentleman to oppose
Barham's aspirations for a second
term, but as yet he has not signified
his willingness to do so. State Senator
Gillette has no desire for the place,
and Frank L. Coombs of Napa, who
could have the nomination it he so de
sired, prefers to hold his friends to
their agreement to secure for him the
appointment of United States District
Attorney. Failing in that he would
still retain his present position of State
Librarian.
In the Second Congressional District
several candidates are already in the
field. Marion de Vries proposes to
make a bid for re-election on the
strength of the record he has made in
Congress during the past two years.
He is unfortunate, in that he will prob
ably be opposed by so prominent and
popular a Republican as P. A. Buell of
Stockton. The district is conceded to
be Republican, and if Mr. Buell re
ceives the nomination, a fact concern
ing which there is little doubt should
he decide to make the run, he will be
elected. Judge J. M. Walling of Ne
vada City is also an aspirant for the
nomination, as is Frank D. Ryan of
Sacramento. The candidacy of the lat
ter Is not considered to be in any way
formidable, as he lacks the support of
his own county delegation.
Victor J. Metcalf, the Oakland at
torney, has announced himself as being
in the race for the Congressional nom
ination In the Third District. He will
contest with the incumbent, S. Q.
Hilborn, for the favor of the Re
publican State Convention. Hilborn
has made many enemies for himself by
the manner in which he has handled
the patr.inag" of the district. The Re
publicans of Solano and Yolo counties
are particularly Incensed against him,
and to Judge from present indications
he will not be able to go to the con
vention with sufficient strength to se
cure the nomination. In case of a close
contest between Metcalfe and Hilborn
Woodland will furnish a compromise
candidate In the person of Reese Clark.
He has many strong and Influential
friends and his claims for recognition
would meet with favor in the event of
a deadlock in the district delegation.
Sheriff Calvin B. White is said to be
in the race on the Democratic side.
The gubernatorial aspirations of Con
gressman Maguire having caused him
to burn his bridges behind him as far
as the Fourth District is concerned,
there is every prospect of a warm
scramble for the chance to become his
successor. Conditions are favorable for
Republican success in the district at
the coming For Uiis reason it
is expected that several Republicans
will come forward with a bid for the
nomination. On the Democratic side of
the fence there are also several as
pirants for the place. W. P. Lawler,
who had the leadership of the Demo
cratic silver campaign in the district
in 1896, is seeking the nomination.
Joseph P. Kelly is also seeking the
place. He was formerly a resident of
the Fifth District, where he sought the
Congressional nomination without sue-
Congressman Loud will make an at
tempt to secure his own re-election
from the Fifth District. He is a capa
ble man and has made an enviable rec
ord during his term of office. Julius
Kahn, the popular attorney, will seek
the Republican nomination and his
many friends are already at work pro
moting his i olitical boom. County
Clerk Curry is also said to have pinned
his hopes on securing the nomination
and will use what political influence
may be left to him to obtain it.
In the Sixth District the woods are
full of candidates. "Announcements"
of Republicans and Democrats who
wish to succeed to the seat now held by
Congressman Barlow are as numerous
as the flowers in May. Barlow, who
was wafted to Washington on the wave
of fusion, is seeking re-election, but
there is no immediate probability of his
attaining his ambition. In the lmprob
! able event of the fusion of the Demo
cratic. Populist and Silver Republican
forces during the coming campaign.
Judge E. H. Lamme, who has achieved
some distinction as a Silver Republi
can, will make a bid for the union nom
ination. On the Republican side of the
fence there are several men more or
less prominent in the affairs of the par
ty who will make an attempt to secure
the nomination. R. J. Waters of Los
Angeles has been playing fast and
j loose with his desire for the place and
is still urged as a possible candidate in
spite of recent announcement that he
had retired from the race. In case he
should persist in his declared intention
to be only an interested spectator-, Billy
Dunn and J. R. Newberry. who have
been posing as the promoters of his po
litical boom, will find themselves out
of a job. Major J. A. Donnell, District
Attorney of Los Angeles, is also a pros
pective candidate, as is W. J. Hill, edi
tor of the Salinas Index, and Jamea
McLaughlin, the Incumbent. Among
the Democrats who hope to secure the
nomination are Mayor Snyder of Los
Angeles, R. F. Del Valle, George S.
Patton, T. O. Toland of Ventura and
John F. Humphreys. The list is a for
midable one and there are still more to
follow.
Congressman Bowers has announced
that he will not be a candidate for re
election from the Seventh District.
.Among those why aspire to the honors
to which he lays no further claim are
A. J. Pillsbury of Tulare and Captain
M. J. Daniels of Riverside. Scipio
Craig, editor of the Redlands Citro
graph, is also mentioned as a possible
candidate.
EMPIRES AND OLYMPICS.
Popular Gun Clubs Have Agreed to
Meet at the Traps in the
Near Future.
The Olympic Gun Club has at last ac
cepted a challenge which it received
some weeks ago from the Empire Gun
Club to shoot a team match bf>st two in
three events for a financial consideration,
the value of which win be determined
upon by a committee of three men select
ed from each team.
The teams will be composed of twelve
men from each club and each man will
deposit either $2 50 or $5, the sum total
going to make up the pot.
According to the conditions agreed upon
one of the shoots will be held at Ingle
side and the other at the Empire Gun
Club grounds In Oakland; a toss of a coin
will decide where the final shoot will be
held.
It will be some time before the Olympic
Gun Club will announce its team, but the
Empires are certain to select their clay-
Bmashers from the following men: King,
McCutchon, Klevcsahl, Andrus, Sears,
Rioklefson, Kerrison, Fisher, Debenham,
Shaw, Zelner, Mitchel, Batten, McCrae.
