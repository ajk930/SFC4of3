And his friends say
that he "loosened" to
the extent of $40,000.
D. Phelan has neither knowledge nor
belief that more than $250 were spent
for him during the i -mpaign of 1896?
Such an idea is so preposterous that
it brings a smile to the fare of the mer
est tyro in politics. But there is
something more than presumption that
this "pure" politician spent much more
than the $260 which, under oath, he
says was the total expended during that
campaign, "by or for him." Every
newspaper in the city received money
from Phelan during that campaign for
advertising â legitimate- advertising â
and in addition to this legitimate ad
vertising the $Ã¼bsidized Bulletin emit
ted several thousand brays, and it did
not emit those brays for its health as
every one knows, nor is Phelan the first
man who has been fooled by an ass in
a lion's skin.
It is known that Phelan's candidacy
was extensively advertised in the "Wasp

of the brightest weekly papers in the
West â a paper with character and
standing in the community â a paper of
enterprise and brains â the paper that
inaugurated colored cartoons in the
press of the country and virtually revo
lutionized the printer's art; the $ub-
Bldieed Bulletin is everything that a
decent newspaper la not â decadent in
its Ideas and vulgar in Its habits â a
paper sordid in in its avarice and venal
In its likes and dislikes â a paper that
Is notorious for prostituting its columns
for pay â a paper devoid of honor and
without consistency.
During: that campaign the Monitor
devoted a page to Phelan and his candl-
dacy. Those who have had business deal
ings with the Monitor know that a page
in tho Monitor costs about $500, and It
is not reasonable to presume that the
Monitor grave this page for less than
it would to other advertisers. During
that campaign Phelan's political card
appeared In nearly all of the weekly
and daily papers in the city, and these
cards were paid for at regular adver
tising rates, which amounted to about
$2600. How does this purifier of poli
tics reconcile this fact with his affi
davit? Either he, or some one for him,
paid for this advertising, and it is past
belief that it was paid for "without his
knowledge."
Thousands of dollars â his managers
say $40,000â were paid out by and for
Phelan during the campaign of 1896, yet
this is what Phelan states under oath:
"I, James D. Phelan, having been a
candidate for the office of Mayor, at
the election held in the city and county
of San Francisco, State of California,
on the 3d day of November, 1896, do
solemnly swear that I have paid the
sum of $250 for my expenses at said
election, and no more, and that, except
as aforesaid, I have not, nor to the
best of my knowledge and belief, has
any person, club, society or associa
tion on my behalf, either directly or in
directly, made any payment, or given,
promised or offered any reward, office,
employment or valuable consideration,
or incurred any liability on account of
or in respect of the conduct or man
agement of said election, and except
such moneys as may have been paid or
expended by the committee selected as
prescribed by the act of the Legisla
ture of this State, approved February
23, 1893; and I further solemnly swear
that, except as aforesaid, no money, se
curity or equivalent for money, has to
my knowledge or belief, been paid, ad
vanced, given or deposited by any one,
to, or in the hands of myself, or any
other person, for the purpose of defray
ing any expenses incurred on my be
half, or in aid of my election, or on ac
count of or in any respect of the con
duct or management of said election.
And I further solemnly swear that I
will not at any future time make or be
a? party to the making or giving of any

of defraying any such expenses as last
mentioned, or provide or be a party to
the providing of any money, security,
or the eaulvalent for. money, for the
purpose of defraying any such ex
pense."
The affidavit could not be mad 4 more
specific and aweeping. It covers every
possible contingency of expenditure.
It leaves no loophole of escape, except
it possibly may be that clause which
states "except such moneys as may
have been paid to or expended by the
committee selected as prescribed by
the act of the Legislature of this State,
approved February 23, 1893."

PAID TO SILENCE
HIS BLACKGUARDISM
Hearst's Secret Compact With the
Southern Pacific Com
pany.
The terms of the- secret agreement be
tween the Examiner and the Southern
Pacific Company aro at last public prop
erty. It will be remembered that consid
erable interest was created by the In
formation that the Examiner hod re
ceived $30,000 from the railroad, ostensibly
for advertising space on a World's Fair
edition. The railroad at that time, need
ed no advertisement from the Examiner.
The sum of money exacted by W. R.
Hearst and paid by the Southern Pacific
Company did not represent value re
ceived in the sense that Hearst and his
managers asked the public to believe.
The money was paid for another pur
pose, that was clearly understood by
Hearst and the Southern Pacific people.
The proprietor of the "Monarch of the
Dailies" demanded $30,000 aa his price to
cease mallclou* attacks upon the rail
road and the varied interests it repre
sents. The officials of the road recognized
the wisdom of acceding to the demand,
but in doing so they forced from Hearst a
secret agreement that in consideration
for the money received he would show no
malice nor malignity in his paper toward
Southern Pacific interests. The railroad
men did not ask for fairness. They
framed a contract that Hearst accepted,
and in accepting admitted that he had
been paid $30,000 to be decent In his
treatment of a great corporation.
The terms of this agreement have been
closely guarded, both by Hearst and
Southern Pacific officials. By the con
sent of those Interested both parties to
the transaction decided to feign what the
public believed to be their true relation
ship. The Examiner was permitted to |
HEARST'S SECRET AGREEMENT WITH THE
SOUTHERN PACIFIC AND ITS ACCEPTANCE
BY THE RAILROAD OFFICIALS.
The company is to enjoy immunity from hostility in the col
umns of the Examiner, and is not to D 3 the victim of malicious
attack or criticism or of misrepresentation; that the Examiner
will not seek to create hostile sentiment in the minds of this
community against the Southern Pacific Company or any of the
interests it represents, and that while not stipulating as against
all criticism, it agrees that criticism shall not proceed from any
motive of malice or malignity, and that such criticism as may be
found necessary to keep and maintain the confidence of the pub
lic, to the extent that any public sentiment may have been
created from other sources, is to be avoided as much as possible.
COLONEL CROCKER: The
above is my understand
ing. How does it conform
to your understanding?

The above contract was duly entered into by the Southern

continue its bogus attacks upon the rail
road, but Charles F. Crocker, A. N.
Towne and W. H. Mills had In their pob
session a document that guaranteed that
all attacks of the Examiner would mean
nothing serious.
In order to deceive its readers the Ex
aminer was given a document that read
as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO, June 29, 1892.
C. M. Palmer Esq., Business Man
ager of the Examiner, San Francisco,
Gal.â Dear Sir: We hereby agree to
engage space in the Grand Special
World's Fair Edition of the San
Francisco Examiner, matter to be fur
nished by us, including cuts, of twen
ty pages or one hundred and forty
columns, for which the Southern Pa
cific Company agre#s to pay Thirty
Thousand. Dollars ($30,000), Gold
Coin of the United States, payable at
the rate of One Thousand Dollars
($1OOO) per month, the flrart month
ly installment to become due and
payable August 31, 1892, and run
ning thence at the rate of One Thou

of the Southern Pacific Company; and
all in accordance with an agreement

July 24, 1893.
For value received I hereby assign the
within claim against the Southern Pacific Com
pany, balance due thereon at this date being
$19,000, to the First National Bank of San Fran
cisdo. The Examiner,
W. R. HEARST.
Witness: I. C. STUMP.
entered Into between the Examiner
management and C. F. Crocker, A.
N. Towne and William H. Mills, on
behalf of the Southern Pacific Com
pany; it being understood that the
said edition shall hare a minimum
issue of Five Hundred Thousand
Copies, and the same shall be pub-
lished simultaneously in San Fran
cisco and Chicago, on or about the
date of the official opening of the
Columbian Exposition.
And it is further agreed that the
said matter shall be subject of en
largement, alteration and revision at
the option of the Southern Pacific
Company at any time prior to Feb

W. H. MIIiLS,
For the Southern Pacific Co.
CHAS. F. CROCKER,
Vice President.
San Francisco, July 21, 1893.
To a casual reader this contract is a
certificate of the falsehood that the Ex
aminer received from the Southern Pacific
Company $30,000 for space in a World's
Fair edition. The contract seems noth
ing more than a simple business proposi
tion. The railroad certainly had a right
to exercise its own discretion in reference
to what it believed was its best financial
interests. If Southern Pacific officials
were convinced that an advertisement in
the Examiner was worth $30,000 the affair
This agrees with my
understanding quite fully.
Certainly nothing less
would be satisfactory.
CHARLES F. CROCKER.

Vice President.
could not reasonably be the concern of
any one else.
This was the impression that both
Hearst and the railroad people sought to
create. Hearst did so to sustain his bur
lesque antagonism to the Southern Pacific
Company, and the railroad people did so
for the same reason that a wayfarer
throws up his hands when he is com
manded to do so on a lonely way. The
railroad sought to protect itself against
malice and what some people call black
mail.
In the contract that the public was al
lowed to read is a line that was deeply
significant. Hearst knew that $30,000 was
assured to him.and'he felt he had been
clever enough to conceal the real purpose
of the payment of the money. The
World's Fair edition of tne "monarch"
was certainly large enough to hide a
transaction that would not look particu
larly pleasant In the light. But the
| Southern Pacific people were cleverer
j than W. R. Hearst. One part of the pub
! lished contract reads: "And all In ac
cordance with an agreement entered into
I between the Examiner management and
! C. F. Crocker. A. N. Towne and Willfam
I H. Mills, on behalf of the Southern Pa
cific Company."
These words tell the story of the secret
contract and explain the reason why the
Southern Pacific Company paid W. R.
Hearst $30,000. The railroad did not pay
that turn of money to the Examiner for
an advertisement. The Southern Pacific
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
needed no newspaper support that the
Examiner could give. The money waa
paid to silence the malice and the malig
nity of the "Monarch." "VV. R. Hearst ac
cepted another agreement for the $30,000
he received. He promised not to be ma
licious nor deliberately to misrepresent
the Southern Pacific Campany to the pub
lic. He agreed not to seek to create a
hostile sentiment In the public mind
against the corporation. He promised to
criticize the railroad only on a basis of
justice. But In promising all this he
asked the Southern Pacific Company to
allow him to wear his mask of false Rn
tagonism and to continue to deceive the
public into a belief that his "Monarch"
was still hostile to Southern Pacific inter
ests.
Under these conditions the secret agree
ment was made and signed. The Call
publishes the document in full this morn
ing. In connection with the contract ara
published also the comments made by
Charles F. Crocker, A. N. Towne and "W.
H. Mills. These gentlemen knew what
they were doing and with whom they
were dealing. They seemed to know that
$30,000 was a bait for the proprietor and
managers of the "Monarch" and they de
termined to have at least a small hook
below the bait. If they were forced to
throw up their hands they could at least
demand Immunity from malice.
Since the information was first given to
the public that Hearst had actually re
ceived 130,000 from the Southern Paciflo
Company the proprietor of the Examiner
has attempted to create the impression
that personally he knew nothing of the
transaction. He has striven to throw tha
odium of the affair upon his employes In
his business office. The public contract
As I understand the
talk the above covers the
understanding fully.

has been flaunted In an effort to prove
this untruth. Presumably the whole in
cident was inspired and carried to a con
clusion in the Examiner business office.
The records published this morning tell
another story. The following flgrures show
when and how part of the money waa
paid:

The assignment of the remainder of the
money to the First National Bank of San
Francisco shows who conducted the ne
gotiations with the Southern Pacific and
who received the money. W. R. Hearst
made the assignment over his own signa
ture. He knew of the entire affair, and
he as well as the Southern Pacific offi
cials knew for what purpose the money
waa paid.2
HENRY T. GAGE
CONTINUES TO
GAIN FRIENDS
Welcome to the Next
Governor.
WOODLAND'S DEMONSTRATION
PROCESSION FORMED TO ESCORT
THE STANDARD-BEARER.
People of Yolo County Assemble in
Great Numbers to Hear the
Issues of the Campaign
Expounded.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND, Oct. 21.â Henry T.
Gage, Jacob Xeff and General W. H. L.
Barnes, whose tour of Placer and Ne
vada counties awakened such great
demonstrations uf enthusiasm among
the miners, farmers and others of the
industrial classes of the region, arose
before 5 o'clock at Grass Valley this
morning and boarded the narrow gauge
train for Coif ax. They arrived at Col
fax, the home of the honored and popu
lar Jacob .Neff. at 7 o'clock, and at that
early hour were greeted with music by
the band and saluted by the cheers of
citiz>
Mr. Neff remained at home to rest for
a day or two, while the standard-bearer
proceeded, according to the schedule of
the State Central Committee appoint
ments, to Woodland, via Sacramento.
At the capital General Barnes was al
lowed by the committee one day's rest.
He will join Mr. Gage to-morrow and
speak with the standard-bearer and
champion of the people in Shasta Coun
ty to-morrow night.
United States Senator George C. Per
kins arrived this evening and Joined
Mr. Gage. Earlier in the day William
Hamilton and Colonel D. M. Burns ar
rived from San Francisco. Woodland
is the old home of Colonel Burns, and
he counts among the dwellers in the
county of Yolo many friends.
The Woodland band discoursed en
livening music when the Republican
standard-bearer alighted from the
train. He was greeted by a reception
committee consisting of M. D. Cham
berlin, chairman of the Yolo County
Central Republican Committee; W. C.
tis, W. R, Pond, A. < '. Ruggles, J.
O. Chalmers, George Abbey, E. H.
Archer, Judge E. E. Gaddis, George
Hoppin, A. J. Plant, J. Ruth Jr. and J.
H. Dv:
A large throng of Republicans at the
railroad station cheered the standard
.â  r. A procession was formed with
the band leading, and to the strains of
inspiring music the standard-bearer was
rted to Byrns Hotel. The commit
tee perceiving that Mr. Gage was fa
tigued by the exacting duties of the
brilliant campaign arranged that he
should get two huurs' rest. This, in
deed, was a welcome boon. During the
afternoon Mr. Gage received many of
the people of Yolo County at the hotel.
The reception was informal, but none
ptable on account of its
informality. The callers at once recog
nized in the Republican standard
bearer a man of the plain people, who
had none of the superior self-esteem of
the office-holding aristocrat. They not
ed with satisfaction the straightfor
ward and manly way In which he met
his fellow citizens.
Scenes of enthusiasm, the ardor of
Republicans and a real outpouring of
the masses, such examples of popular
uprising as have rendered Henry T.
Gage's tour of the State so remarkable,
were witnessed in the beautiful city of
Woodland to-night. In point of num
bers assembled and spirit displayed the
demonstration was a Yolo County rec
ord breaker.
Early in the afternoon people from
the surrounding country began to ar
rive. Before twilight great crowds of
visitors thronged the streets. They
came from Blacks, Yolo. Madison, Win
ters, Davisville, Vacavilie, Guinda and
Dunnigan. Men came in teams from
points forty miles distant to hear
the next Governor expose and de
nounce the odious doctrines of sin
gle tax, the campaign issue which
the fusion leader seeks to obscure
by shouting railroad. The Dewey
Republican Club of Winters, with a
band of music, came with cheers for
Gage and Neff. Another demonstration
was on when the Gage Club of Davis
ville. headed by a band, came in. The
multitude grew larger and larger as
the time for the speakers' appearance
approached.
Amid salutes, bonfires, a brilliant dis
play of fireworks and stirring strains
of music the shouts of confident Re
publicans heightened the enthusiasm.
In front of the Byrnes Hotel a vast
crowd gathered, eager to get sight of
the next Governor. Mr. Gage went to
supper early and so had an hour after
his meal and before the speaking com
menced to meet the farmers and fruit
growers of Yolo County. The formal
ity of introduction was dispensed with.
The people came forward and on their
own motion to cheer his cause with en
couraging words, U they instantly rec
ognized in him a man of the people,
who had not been pampered and ex
alted above his fellows by lucrative
salaries drawn from the public treas
ury. While the standard-bearer was
engaged in handshaking the resident
population of Woodland went early to
Armory Hall, and many of them se
i seats long before the hour ap
pointed for the meeting.
At 7:30 o'clock the hall was densely
packed. At 8 o'clock, when the recep
tion committr-e escorted Mr. Gage to the
armory, the hall was packed as it never
was before. There was a crush of peo
ple at the main entrance. Hundreds
came and went away without trying to
get through the great crowd. The vast
audience of two thousand people was
called to order by M. D. Chamberlin,
chairman of the Republican County
Committee, who announced that Judge
Qaddis would preside as permanent
chairman. The following vice presi
dents were announced: E. E. Guddis,
A. D. Porter, George Hoppin, H. C.
Gable, George Armstrong, George
Banks, Peter Juhl, M. S. Ish, J. O.
Weed, Tom Ryder, T. J. Vaughn. Hor

J. O. Chalmers, E. H. Archer and J. H.
Dungan.
The Winters band stationed at the
stage of the armory played the "Star
Bp.ingled Banner," and the patriotic
tudience cheered. The Woodland auar
tet then gave a campaign song.
Judge Gaddis introduced Henry T.
Gage as a man who had never Bought
public office, but one whom the people
had called. A mighty shout of welcome
and vigorous clapping of hands, loiik
continued, expressed the feeline of the
audience. The modest standard bearer
did not accept the ovation as a tribute
to himself, but regarded it as an ex
pression of allegiance to Republican
principles. He proceeded at once to the
discussion of the leading issue of the
campaignâ the single tax. The fact
was cited and the record produced that
Judge Maguire had promised to devote
his life to the advancement of the
single tax scheme. Wasuire's un-
American attitude in Congress was
dwelt upon. The attempt of Maguire
to make capital on the funding bill
amendment demanded the attention of
;he speaker. The Congressional Record
.\ as submitted, and the audience con
vinced that Maguire did not object to
the amendment when objection would
have defeated it.
The telling points made by Henry T.
Gage, the people's champion, evoked
Hum the vast audience ringing cheers
of approval. Mr. Uage spoke for one
hour and thirty minutes and held the
close attention of the masses.
Senator Perkins" introduction to the
audience was the signal for more ap
plause. The Senator spoke of national
questions, recounting the wise and
beneficial measures of Congressional
enactment since the election of William
McKinley. He reviewed the railroad
settlement question, presenting facts of
record to show that the amendment
providing: for the settlement received
the sanction of Re-publicans, Democrats
and Populists. The explanation places
.Maguire in the position of opposing all
the parties which he claims to lead.
The prosperity attained under Repub
lican rule and the enactment of the
law to secure arbitration between rail
road companies and railroad employes
were discussed by the Senator. He die*
not claim for the Republican party thÂ«
great achievements of the war, but said
the conflict was an American war.
President AlcKinley's statesmanship in
recognizing the eminent Confederate
leaders was referred to as an act which
brought all sections of the Union to
gether in support of the country and
the flag.
Tumults of applause hailed the pa
triotic expressions of Senator Perkins.
The great meeting adjourned at a
late hour with three mighty cheers for
Gage and Neff.
To-day Hutchison, Magulre's mate on
the fusion ticket, wandered from his
committee's schedule and got lost. He
left the bay for the interior on the
train with William Hamilton and
Colonel Burns. The two last mentioned
alighted at WooAand and so did Hutch
ison but the Populist, after wandering
around the town, found that he was
billed for Santa Rosa to-night and not
Woodland. Judge Lawler of. the fusion
committee may be obliged hereafter to
tag Hutchison, so that the conductors
can put him off at the places designated
for him to speak.
COLONEL T. V. EDDY ON
THE REAL VITAL ISSUE
Tells a Large Republican Gathering
at Monterey That It Is the
Single Tax.
MONTEREY, Oct. 21.â One of the larg
est political meetings ever held in this
section of Monterey County occurred in
Bagby's Opera House to-night, the citi
zens "of Monterey and Pacific Grove and
! the Republican candidates for Monterey
County offices uniting in an enthusiastic
greeting to Colonel T. V. Eddy of San
Francisco, who had come to address
them.
The Republican candidates' rally that
was scheduled to occur at Pacific Grove
to-night was postponed to enable all to
attend the Monterey meeting. The opera
; house w;ls packed ami the stage on which
! house was packed and the stage, on whic h
'both towi labortftely decorated
: with AmeridfcÃ ilags. A large number of
1 ladies were present.
When the speaker of the evening was
i introduced he announced that he had
come to Monterey to speak of the issues
of this campaign and would deal with
the subject from two standpoints â first,
i what Judge Maguire says is the vital
â¢ issue, and, second, what is really the
i vital issue. Then, along the first line,
he spoke of the railroad question, out
lining the terms of the so-called funding
i bill, which he demonstrated way not a
i funding bill, declaring that Maguire was
I using it as a subterfuge to arou
feelings of the | .1 so blind them
to the real issueâ the single tax. In con
nection with this he showed the socialistic
i tendency of what he called "That vicious.
j fantastic doctrine" and read extracts
â  from Maeruire's speech in Congress rela
tive to the immigration bill, as published
in Thursday's Call.

well received.
T O. Toland made a brief statement of
the duties of the office to which he aspired
as he understood them, and askud the
support of the people because he opposed
the Southern Pacific, which invariably
tried to control the board in order to re
duce its own assessments.
W. H. Alford asserted that the glory
of the Republican party had g">ne. He
â¢rehashed the stock campaign story that
The Call had published the nominees of
the convention beforehand, hence the
ticket was corporation ruled. He at
tacked Charles F. Curry, candidate for
Secretary of State, and ' called him an ;
embezzler. He asserted that Gage was j
a man without a record, that Maguire i
was the choice of every reform man in j
the State, and thrn entered into an ex- j
haustive discussion of the financial ques
tion.
Senator White confined hJs address to |
a few witticisms and a discussion of some
of the issues In national affairs.
CONGRESSMAN LOUD
AT MOUNTAIN VIEW
Gives Cogent Reasons Why Voters j
Should Support the Republican
Ticket. x
SAN JOSE. Oct. 21.â Congressman Loud I
addressed the citizens of Mountain V^ew j
and vicinity this evening. The meeting ;
was the largest and most enthusiastic
ever held in the northern end of the
county and several hundred were unable
to get in the hall. Bonfires and a torch
light procession preceded the meeting.
Loud spoke on all national issues, es
pecially tnose arising during the Spanfsh-
American War and those prospective. The
people were asked to keep the Republican j
party In power in order that McKinley
might be able to carry' out the policy al

tion of Gage and the State and legisla
tive tickets.
W. A. Beasley of .this city also address
ed the meeting along the same linos.

enthusiastic meeting in this campaign

an eloquent and interesting address rela
tive to judicial affairs In his usual man

Sharply Criticizes That Gentleman's
Vote on the Funding Bill.
Healdsburg Visited in
the Afternoon.
Special Disr>atch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Oct. 21.â What was
probably the largest political gathering
ever held in this city greeted the ap
pearance of Judge Maguire at the
Athenaeum here to-night. Arrange
ments for the meeting were made with
great care, the large auditorium being
handsomely decorated for the occasion
by the Ladies' Maguire Club, organized
several days ago.
The meeting was called to order by
Thomas J. Hutchirrson, chairman of
the County Central Committee, who,
after a selection by the band, intro
duced as chairman of the meeting Wil
liam F. Cowan, nominee for the As
sembly. After a few remarks he in
turn presented Mr. Maguire, whose ad
vance to the front of the stage was the
signal for an outburst of applause,
joined in by the band, which played
â¢Hail to the Chief."
Mr. Maguire's speech, which lasted
over an hour, was confined solely to
the issues of the campaign, no points
of particular freshness being touched
upon except regarding the candidacy of
Hon. John A. Barham, nominee for Con
gress in the First District. Mr. Maguire
paid his respects to that gentleman in
no uncertain manner, criticizing him
warmly for his vote upon the funding
bill.
Mr. Maguire was followed by Mr.
Hutchison, nominee for Lieutenant
Governor, and H. M. La Rue, Railroad
Commissioner.
This afternoon Mr. Maguire addressed
the people of Healdsburg at 2 o'clock in
Trultt's Opera-house, being driven to
this city by a committee appointed for
that purpose. He arrived shortly be
fore dark and was taken directly to a
hotel, where he remained until a few
moments before the time set f^r the
meeting to commence.

Town Ablaze With Bonfires, Music
and Speech-Makers.
GILROY, Oct. 21.â The town was ablaze
with bonfires to-night. The occasion was
a Democratic rally. A band and douole

Political Activity at Willows.
WILLOWS, Cal.. Oct. 21.â J. Aubrey
Jones, Silver Republican, and nominee for
Congress on the fusion ticket, addressed
the people of Willows this evening. Mr.
Jones contented himself with reviewing
the gold standard measure fathered by
Secretary of the Treasury Gage, whi< h
he claimed was a piece of Intended class
legislation, and in explaining why his op
ponent, Mr. Metcalf, defeated Hilborn for
the nomination.
The Republicans are preparing a great
reception to Gage, Neff and Barnes, who
stop here on their way north to-morrow.
EUREKA VALLEY DEMOCRATS.
Hefting Jimmy Phdan's Offlce-Hunt
ters Are Punctual in Their
Attendance.
The honest voters of Eureka Valley
turned out last ntght to attend a meeting
of "hefting" Jimmy's nominees at Twen
ty-eighth and Church streets. The small
hall was fairly well filled, as it was known
that the picked orators of the party would
be punctual in their attendance, as it Is
nip und tuck with the majority of them
to get a sufficient number of votes to en
title them to get a place on the official
ticket at the next election.
Juhn Fennell, a modest young man. had
the honor of occupying the chair. He lost
no time in setting the campaign ball
a-rolling by introducing R. P. Doolan, the
nominee for Superintendent of Streets.
Doolan spoke his niece and skipped out,
making roum fur Leonard Stone. E. P.
Mogan, nominee for Judge of one of the
Police Courts, with his good-natured face
and cheerful voice, was well received.
John P. Dunn was quite at home on the
sand of Eureka Valley, as it reminded
him of the initiation into politics under
"DlnnlB" Kearney in days long gone by.
It is a most fortunate thing for Mr. Dunn
that there is a railroad company, as he
fails to apeak of what should be
clone to this gigantic corporation. When
he gets to Sacramento in the sweet by
and-by as a member of the Board of
Equalization the railroad company will be
taxed up to and above its ears, so that it
will become insolvent. The Little Joint,
Magulre, may appoint him receiver.
Franklin K. Lane, nominee for City and
County Attorney: T. F. Bonnet, nominee
for Sheriff; Barclay Henley, nominea for
District Attorney; P. J. MoCorunck. nom
inee for State Senator; Ed I. Coffey, who
would like to be Assemblyman; John H.
Urady. nominee for Auditor: M. Green
blatt." who would like to heft the money
in the treasury with Jimmy next year,
made short speeches. W. M. Hinton, the
Railroad Commissioner nominee, woke up
and enlightened the Eureka Valley voters
by telling them that he had known Bar
clay Henley's father and knew nothing
dishonest of him. He also knew young
Mr. Coffey'B father, grandfather and un
cle they Were good people. Hence he
would vouch for their offspring. The
railroad fortunately escaped a scorin?;
it will not be confiscated by him.
At the eleventh )|pur "hefting" Jimmy
came panting into the hall and made his
accustomed speech, but this time he snid
not a word about the "honest laboring
man." He was thinking, probably, of the
janitors who look after tne property left
to him by his father for $35 a month, or
the gas lighters who are getting $40 for
their labors. These are the men that
Jimmy said were overpaid.
Meetings at Mowry's Hall.
A large Democratic mass-meeting -was
held last evening in Mowry's Hall, corner
of Laguna and Grove streets. Thomas F.
Walsh of the County Central Committee

A BOOMING
MEETING AT
B'NAI B'RITH
For Republicanism
and Patriotism.
GEORGE KNIGHT TO THE FORE
STRIKES THE KEYNOTE OF THE
CAMPAIGN.
"Vote Your Ticket Straight and Yon
Will Be All Right"â Judge
Murphy Incinerates a
Yellow Journal.
One of the most successful minor Re
publican meeting's of the campaign was
that of the Forty-second and Forty-third
districts held at B'nai B'rith Hall last
night," Colonel C. L. Taylor presiding.
The Waterman^ Sisters, the "J. M.
Troutt" quartet, composed of ladies, and
a brass band furnished the music, while
there was enthusiasm and oratory to
spare.
George A. Knight, the Republican ora
tor, surprised and delighted the audience
by dropping in and delivering a few
broadsides of logic with a fervor that
raised his hearers from their seats and
roused to a great height the spirit of
patriotism and Republicanism. During
the course of his remarks he dwelt upon
the duty of Republicans to see that Calf
fornia should not do shame to itself by
falling to send a solid Republican dele
gation to Congress. No one could give a
valid reason why the State should not
loyally support the administration of
President McKinley, and what was more
important, there was not a man on the
ticket who would not be an honor and
credit to the State in the halls of Con
gress.
"March on to victory to the music of
right and reason, protection and pros
perity," said Mr. Knight. "The Republi
can party has done more for civilization
and the rights of man than any other or
ganization in the world, and it ia only just
that it should receive your fullest and
most earnest support. Be true to your
selves and the traditions of your great
party. Vote your ticket straight and you
will be all right."
Colonel C. L. Taylor, in a short speech,
called attention to the unwarranted at
tacks that are being made upon Henry
T. Gage, in which he is charged with
being "a railroad tool."
"Mr. Gage's first public speech," said
Mr. Taylor, "was against the â¢ railroad,
and he has never been anything but the
opponent of that institution. These
charges against him I believe to be as
false as hâ l. .It is an endeavor to pull a
man down by false witness. They say he
keeps his hands in his pockets. Well, if
more citizens kept their hands in their
own pockets there would be fewer of them
in jail. Charles L. Patton is an honorable,
capable man, who does not demand the
control of a Board of Supervisors or find
it necessary to colonize the 'wards of the
city to carry out Ms purposes. If he is
elected there will be no experiments, no
'hefting', of the people's mone"y.'
Hon. D. K. McKinlay made a short and
int treating address, in which he impressed
upon the voters the fact that a Republi
can administration had lifted the coun
try out of the slough of despond into
which it had been dragged by the Democ
racy, and showed them that it wus their
duty to stand by the administration. It
would be the extremest foliy and injus
tice to place the reins of government in
other hands at this time. Every Repub
lican should make it his business to as
sist in the election of Republican Con
gressmen and legislators. IT would be
the duty of the latter to elect a Repub
lican Senator to succeed Stephen M.
White, and of the former to fight for pro
tection and prosperity.
Julius Kahn, candidate for Congress in
the Fourth District, was enthusiastically
called to the rostrum and spoke for a
moment only. He said that California
had muoh to ask of Congress and Repub
lican Congressmen were needed to secure
these things. The party, he believed,
would do lta duty in this campaign, and If
it did the result would show that Cali
fornia stands for progress, prosperity and
advancement.
Ex-Judge D. J. Murphy, in the course
of a somewhat extended speech, called at
tsntlon to the merits of the Republican
municipal platform, and stated that there
was not a man on the ticket whose hon
esty or integrity had been attacked or
Impeached.
"The evening paper that has by carica
ture insulted Mr. Patton and his friends
has never dared presume to say that he
is not an honeat, true man. The Bulletin
is trying to defeat every Republican
who is a candidate for a patronage office.
Wherever there is patronage to be gained
the Bulletin is supporting the Democracy
in order that it may be entirely controlled
by Phelan and his appointed candidates.
The Bulletin is not a representative of
the Republican party, and iu> acts prove
the fact."
Attorney General Fitzgerald spoke of
the sterling qualities of the Republican
candidates, and called attention to the
fact that the Democrats had opposed the
new charter. It was carried by Republi
cans, and that party was nledged to se
cure its adoption in the Legislature if its
candidates were electeu. He also referred
to that portion of the platform which
calls for the eventual ownership of pub
lic utilities, such as gas, water and elec
tric light plants and streetcars.
Hon. C. L. Patton arrived at the last
moment and simply referred to his can
didacy for Mayor, his attitude on the
other questions involved in the platform,
promised a clean business administration
and said good night.
Among the speakers who had only time
to present themselves and make their
bow were Leon Dennery, Joseph E.
Barry, Al Berthier, Martin Fragley, I. J.
Truman, Judge Low, Coroner W. J. Haw
kins. William A. Deane, Thomas F. Gra
ham, Judge Joachlmsen. Henry S. Mar
tin, John Lackmann and R. H. Webster.
THE ISSUE AT STAKE.
Charles L. Pattern Defines His Posi
tion at a Thirty-Fifth District *
Meeting.
The Republicans of the Thirty-fifth As
sembly District held a. rousing meeting
last night in Irving Hall, Valencia and
Hill streets. T. C. Maher, president of
the District Club, acted as chairman.
The chief speakers were Charles L. Pat
ton, Judge Murphy and D. K. McKinlay.
The James M. Troutt Quartet added
variety to the meeting at intervals with
campaign songs.
Mr. Patton was greeted with ringing
cheers, but as his time was limited his
speech was very brief. '"The Republican
ticket," he said, "is made up of as good
a crowd of men as could be selocted. All
are pledged to support the new charter,
which means municipal ownership of pub
lic utilities, cheaper water and gas and
lower taxes. I stand up to deny the oft
repeated statement that this is a con
test between Phelan and the bosses,
am not pledged to any political boss, and
if I am elected not one of them will have
anything to say. The fair way to pus
the matter is that it is a contest between
Phelan and his millions and Patton and
his friends,"
D. E. McKinlay discussed the State
ticket in an able and convincing manner
and threw a few hot shot into the Ma
wulre camp. Brief addresses were made
By Henry Clement I. J. Truman, Henry
Martin. W. P. Fitzgerald. Judge Joachim
pen. William A. Deane. Thomas F- Gra
ham and Martin Fragley.

ALAMEDA STANDS TRUE.
Republican Party Managers Predict
the Usual Big Majorities From
the Eucinal City.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 21.â The local Re
publicans are much encouraged at the
political .outlook in Alameda. According
to the best information obtainable, Ala
meda will roll up this year its usual ma
jority for the Republican ticket. E. K.
Taylor, City Attorney and candidate for
State Senator, who has made a careful
survey of the field, says:
"The Republicans of Alameda are pull
ing together better this year than they
have evt-r done before, and the prospects
of a big majority in this city are most en
couraging- From my observations, 1 am
that the head of the ticket will
carry the city by 75'J majority. Oscar
Rogers, for Sheriff, and J. B. Barber, for
Tax Collector, both being Alameda men,
will run ahoad of their ticket. Their ina
be frgm 900 to 1000. Frank
Jordan, candidate for County Clerk, will
carry this city, but his majority will not
be as large, owing to the fact that his
opponent, T. C. Stoddard, is an Alameda
man.
' "The friends of Congressman Hilborn are
' taking an interest in the Stoddard fight,
; as against Jordan. This is the only appar
ent disaffection among the Republicans,
but it is more than offset by quite a for
j midable element of disgruntled Democrats
' who did not take kindly to the fusion idea,
| and who are openly kniiing their county
( andidates."
The light of J. R. Talcott for Supervisor
i from the Second District promises to be
I somewhat close. The Democratic nominee,
; Charles Eteyer-, has enlisted the German
. element in his cause, and they are doing
â  gome hard work; but the Republican eam
i palgrn managers are not worrying, as they
' state that the majority in the Alameda
; end of the district is too big to be over-
Supervisor Church, whose district takes
in the west end of Alameda, seems to
have things his own way in this city.
But few of the Democrats are supporting
John R. Glascock, and those who are do
ing so are only doing it in a half-hearted
("â -morrow evening Alameda will give
a reception at Armory Hall to the Repub
lican county nominees. The Aiameda Re
publican Club met last evening and named
the following vii-B-presldents for the meet

DEMOCRATS RALLY.
A Number of Municipal Candidates
Plead Their Cause at Saratoga
Hall.
The Democratic mass-meeting held last
evening at Saratoga Hall on Geary street
was well attended. W. D. Farren acted
as chairman, and present were the fol
lowing vice-presidents of the evening:
John Bernard, Ivan Schieke, Ben Stern,
P. O. Rellly, J. Coffin, Joseph Racy and
Mr. Garrard.
Mayor Phclan devoted some time in
throwing bouquets at the Examiner and
in denouncing other journals in this city.
He said that he had no quarrel with the
newspapers, but that they werfe attempt
ing to pick one with him. "There would
be no necessity for appearing before you
this evening," said the gentleman '"if
newspapers, which are published osten
sibly for the purpose of distributing news,
would not hold back and suppress a por
tion of It." ;
Phelan then explained his colonization
proposition by saying that by recent en
actment the Legislature had obliter
ated all supervisorial wards in this city,
but that, in the event of such law being
declared unconstitutional, the Supervis
ors had taken the precaution of safely
landing within their territory that their
chances of holding on to their offices
might not be jeopardized. He said that
the Sternberg affair bore no comparison
with the present cases, and took occa
sion to reiterate the story of Mahoney's
election.

The Thirty-ninth District Republican
Club held its regular weekly meeting in
Saratoga Hall last evening. There was
a semblance of a Democratic meeting in
the lo*ver hall, for -which many dollars
were spent in bonfires and music, but
that did not detract from the club meet
ing upstairs. Many got tired of listen
ing to the whistling of the small boys
downstairs and went upstairs to hear the
enunciation of Republican principles by
George W. Collins, candidate for Super
visor; Leon E. Jones, candidate for As
semblyman; W. J. Herrin, F. D. Worth,
W. J. King, E. G. Knapp and others.

tag in this matter without regard to
party."

A HARD HIT!
Nearly every one who handled Klondike goods last winter was disap-
pointed in the volume of trade. Our sales were large for two or three
months, which, with careful buying and hard pushing, left us with very
little stock on hand. This we propose to close out at once-and get ready
for the new season's Alaska trade, which will begin soon after New Years.
You save half to three-fourths by ordering to-day. These prices are for
Saturday and Monday only. Goods may all go early to-day.

SALOONS WRECKED BY
A MOB OF SOLDIERS
rENNESSEEANS AND IOWANS
TRY TO RUN KEARNY STREET.
They Claimed Grievances Against
the Houses and Proceeded to
Take Revenge.
A wild mob of lowa and Tennessee sol
diers, numbering about fifty, entered the
Eureka dance hall at 537 Kearny street
last night and proceeded to clean out tha
place in the most approved fashion. They
first charged on the bar and In a few
minutes it was a complete wreck. They
next went up into the boxes, tore down
curtains and hangings and everything else
which cculd be torn down and broke,
everything breakable that they could lay
their hands on, giving the excuse that
they had been charged too much for
drinks on the occasion of a former visit
to the house and wanted to 'get even."
They then visited several other resorts
along the line and wrecked every saloon
they entered. The police finally got the
mnh in hand and ten of them were safely
landed in the California-street station
and charged with being drunk. General
Merriam was communicated with by tele
phone and sent out a provost guard to
round up the stragglers.
HEARST WAS COY.
Deputy Marshal Gallagher (Jnable to \
Serve a Process â The Libel Case.
The papers in the suit of A. L. McDon
ald against William R. Hearst to recover
IK2JBS for infringement of copyright of a
map of Klondike-, published in the Ex
aminer without McDonald's consent, were
handed to Deputy United States Marshal
Gallagher yesterday forenoon with in
structions to serve the same on Mr.
Hearst, but up to the close of office hours
Mr. Hearst could not be found either at
the editorial rooms or business office of
the Examiner or elsewhere.
The law allows damage at the ratio of
$1 for every specific violation of copy
right. According to the Examiner's
statement of its circulation in August,
1897, the month in which the map was
published in that paper, 82,723 copies were
Issued. Hence the demand for $*2.7-9
damages.
The case of libel brought against Hearst
by Claus Spreekels was called in Judge
Mogan's court yesterday morning. Grove
i L. Johnson appeared for the prosecutiou
I and John S. Drum, representing Garret

ance of the defendant was waived. By
consent the case was continued till Mon

Mrs. Carrolson of 33 Natoma street was
arrested last night by detective Tom
Ryan and charged with mayhem. Dur
ing a dispute with Mrs. Madig-an, h>-r
neighbor, yesterday afternoon she chewed
off a portion of her upper lip. Mrs. Madi
gan was taken to Dr. Reilly's office on

The Injured woman claims that Mrs. Car

boy named O'Brien, and when she denied
the Impeachment she bit off a piece of
her lip.

A delightful entertainment was given
last evening at the Mizpah Presbyterian

JAMES GEE'S WAR RECORD
KILLING TRUTHS TOLD BY A
ONB-TIME DEMOCRAT.
The San Diego Jurist Greeted and
Applauded by Two Thousand
Voters at Odd Fellows,'
Hall.
Judge J. Wade McDonald of San Diego,
for twenty years a Democrat, but now
doing Trojan work in the Republican
ranks, came up out of the sunny south
land yesterday with a mission to per
form. He accomplished it last evening at
Odd Fellows' Hall t<-> tho satisfaction of
over 2000 people who had gathered to
hear him.
The object of Judge McDonald's pil
grimage Into the north was the further
abbreviation of the "Little Giant" and
the painting', in his true colors, of Stephen
M. White. With both men. and with the
party sophistries in which they have so
liberally indulged, he dealt as only a ma'
can who was for two decades a mom 1 i
of their party and learned in its deviou
ways.
In a vigorous speech that held hi? ai
dience for a full two hours he laid bar<
the records and characters of the men
he dealt with and established in the miii' I.^1 .^
of his hearers the one true issue of the
campaign so firmly that all the specious
arguments of the "Little Giant's" adher
annot shake it.
Judge McDonald was introduced to his
audience hy Oscar Lewis of the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association, and
was given a typical San Francisco ova-
He attributed the laree attendance not
to interest in a new speaker and an ex-
Democrat but to the widespread and un
usual interest in the parties and issues or
the campaign.
"The history of the country,"
Judge McDonald, "is divided into thiv.'
epochs;â the revolutionary, the Civil War
and the Spanish-Americanâ and though
the others have left their mark and will
live down history, it is the last that will
live longest and be most prolific of last
ing results.
"For three years past there has been
in progress off our shores a war of such
peculiar character, of such awful and un
civilised tendencies, that it has shocked
the world.
"We resorted to diplomacy, to entreaty
:horted with Spain to bring us some
relief from the dreadful spectacle of war
by starvation, but our protests and oar
entreaties were persistently unheeded and
the horrors continued until finally a
wave of feeling swept the length and
breadth of the land that permeated the
capital at Washington, and notice went
forth to Spain that this inhuman war
must cease or we would stop It.
"Our motive was pure; it was humane. I
W*Â» Â£&ye Spain notice that it was not |
for our aggrandizement that we would
intercede. We would do it out of pa
triotism, and there is no grander, truer ,
patriotism than ours.
"But, fellow citizens, there are degrees
and shades of patriotism, and the sort
that does not urge its possessor to give
up his blood and his life for his cause
is not the sort that is typical of the
American.
"We came to war and the result of our
victory, though it was bought with our
ud. is almost beyond our compre- :
:;. Ido not need to tell you what '
the Philippines mean to San Francisco, j
what almost illimitable possibilities their I
possesson opens to this beautiful town of
yours.
"And I need not tell you, friends, that
in this war and its results lies the one
true issue in this campaign. It is not
whether the Southern Pacific owns Cali
fornia or whether James G. Maguire
made up the Democratic ticket, but it
is, shall or shall not that glorious flag
of ours be folded over the places where
It now floats? Shall we give up the
lands that we have so dearly bought and
resist this universal tendency to expan
sion?
"There is the issue, no matter how they
may try to befog It, that and that only
is the issue. And 1 say to you, my friends,
that if that flag goes back from the proud
position it holds to-day It will be because
there Is not a Republican left to fight
for it.
"But we've got against us that triangu
lar, silver-lined, popocratic conglomera
tion that they are calling the Democracy.
They have placed in their platform a most
peculiar plank. It says 'though we are
not in favor of aggressive expansion, but
we favor a careful analytical inspection
of the Philippines, yet we do not believe
in giving back to Spain any land that we
have wrested from her.' That's consist
ently and Democratically all things to all
men, isn't it?
"Aiid that plank, I want to tell you, is
framed upon the policy pursued through
this war by ilaguire and Stephen M.
White. Every vote that they cast on this
matter was diametrically opposed to ex
pansion and honorable war. I do not say
that the masses of the Democrats were
opposed to war, but their leaders were,
for they knew that the glory of victory
would attach to the party in power.
"And what was the result? When our
heroes were like an iron line at Guan
tanamo, or charging that hill at San
Juan; when they were wounded and sick
In the trenches and Mr. McKinley's ad
ministration needed money for their aid,
where were the Democratic leaders?
They were not voting. They were
in the lobbies harrying their brains for
some scheme to offset thla war's honor to
the Republican party.
"And you do not have to go out of your
State to flnd them. Senator White and
CoiiKresaman Maguire were among them,
and then they came home to distract at
tention from their records and the real
issue by holding up the railroad.
"They allege against the administration
that supplies at times were short, that
the ranks were full of Incompetents. They
â¢would have excuse for doing this if the
war were still on and they wished to

being considered, and I want to say to
you that if you cast your vote against
the Republican nominee it will he ac
cepted by this country and by Europe as
a repudiation of the course of the ad
ministration through this war. This is
the real issue.
"They have voted against every meas
ure that would help this Stat^. -in this
war, in the matter of Hawaiian annexa
tion and in everything else. Are you go
ing to vote for men thus handicapped by
unpardonable transgressions?
"Why, to excuse themselves for voting
against that $300,000,000 war bond Issue
they are saying that they thought there
was enough in the treasury, and more
might not be needed. And in response to
that call, for which they did not vote,
there came an offer of $1,400,000,000 instead
of $300,0u0,000; and that offer by our own
people showed Europe and every other
country on earth that they wanted no
trouble with us. It was worth more tnan
500.000 soldiers in the field.
"And yet they cast their vote against it.
They placed paltry dollars higher in the
scale than the blood of thousands of our
soldiers, and that sort of patriotism is
not of the American kind."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1898.
HENLEY ONCE
BETRAYED A
SACRED TRUST
Sold Out to the Rail
road in Sonoma.
HE WAS A COUNTY OFFICER
USED HIS POSITION TO EFFECT
A DONATION OF BONDS.
Sued the Corporation and Got Half
a Cent Damages â McKinstry'a
Denunciation of the
Sell-Out.
When the Democratic Municipal Con
vention named Barclay Henley, an alien
of Mexico, for the high and honorable
office of District Attorney of San Fran
cisco its members presumably did not
know that he had filled a similar position
once before in this State, and in a man
ner that made his constituents blush for
the good name of the people who elected
him. He was In the office of the District
Attorney of Sonoma County in 1870 as
assistant to District Attorney Overton,
and the records show that his conduct
was so outrageous and treacherous that
the people there refused to recognize him
thereafter.
This spirit was shown In the Democratic
convention of 1886 when Judge Curtis of
Sacramento and Henley were candidates
for the chairmanship of that body. Henley
denounced Curtis as a railroad man, and
the latter replied In a manner that snowed
Henley under by a majority of 69 votes.
The defeated candidate's own district
went against him 69 to 22. Judge Curtis
got his ammunition from the records of
the old Twelfth District Court, which
show that Henley and his superior. Over
ton, tried to beat the California Pacific
Railroad out of $2000 for services as at
torneys,''and $412 for expenses. At that
time Henley was Assistant District At
torney and also a member of the Assem
bly from Mendoclno County, and had been
actively Interested in the passage of the
county subsidy act, to enable countita to
assist In the building of railroads.
While holding these responsible posi-
I tlons Henley, for the purpose of monetary
and other gain, lent himself to the Cali
fornia Pacific Railroad, as subsequently
shown by a complaint in a suit that he
and Oveiton brought against the com
pany. The complaint states that between
April 10, 1870, and September 10 of the
same year, Henley officially induced the
Supervisors of Sonoma County to as
semble at various times In order to have
that body order the holding of an elec
tion submitting the Question of voting a
donation of county bonds to aid In the
construction of the railroad. He also
drew petitions to and contracts with the
board relative to this matter and gave his
official adviceâ and his advice every time
was favorable to the railroad scheme.
When the proposition was submitted to
the people Henley spent the most of his
time stumping the county in favor of the
donation by the county to aid In the con
struction of the railroad. That the alien
of Mexico was In the employ of the rail
road company while holding two posi
tions that were the gift of the people Is
shown by the railroad company's answer
to the complaint.
This answer was that Henley and Over
ton and the railroad company had an
understanding that if the job was carried
out they would be appointed attorneys for
the company, "and further that the ser
vices were for lobbying, for which they
were not entitled to recover." The case
was tried in 1872 and the court decided
that Henley and Overton were entitled to
damages in the sum of 1 cent.
Judge McKlnstry filed an opinion in
wlttch he said that it Is the duty of every
good citizen to give advlco upon publlo
affairs when asked, and the law pre
sumes that the adviser Is actuated only
by a desire to benefit the whole com
munity and that "It will not be permitted
that this proud privilege shall be degraded
by hired advocacy." Judge McKinstry's
language was most scathing in his de
nunciation of Henley and Overtoil's con
duct and the finding of judgment for 1
cent, half a cent apiece, would have been
to ordinary men more humiliating than
the loss of the case.
Henley's itemized account of expenses
while jobbing for the railroad proves that
as a public servant of Sonoma County
he had Bold himself out to a corporation,
body, boots and breeches. And this Is the
person who seeks of the public of San
Francisco the high position of District
Attorney, an office above all others that
should be filled by a man whose character
is above reproach and whose past Is not
clouded by crooked transactions.

Wong Bing Captured With the Ques
tions end Answers Written
Down in a Book.
Wong Blng, a member of the Chinese
Association for the Importation of Slave
Girls, was neatly caught yesterday in the
act of studying a catechism of questions
and answers to fit the case of Wong Ling
Choy, a Chinese girl, at the Mall dock
awaiting a landing. The girl had been
furnished with a catechism before she left
China, and had studied it on the way
across. Wong Bing was furnished with
a duplicate so that when he should give
his testimony before the Chinese bureau
it would correspond with that given by
the girl.
Interpreter Gardner and Chinese In
spector Flesh went yesterday morning to
the residence of W ong Blng, at 717*4
Pacific street. Dr. Gardner, in Chinese,
requested Blng to come to the door, that
some one wanted to apeak with him.
Bing, catechism in hand, opened the
door and was immediately seized by the
visitors. Flesh getting a strong half Nel
son hold on the Chinaman's right wrist.
The paper was taken to the bureau and
translated. â "It contained all the neces
sary questions and answers pertaining to
the case of Wong Ling Choy and will
be used by the bureau as a reason why
she should not be allowed to land. There
being no punishment for such cases Bing
was allowed to go.
The next time he Is studying his cate
chism he will lock the door and bar it
and remain inside.
Jumped Out of a Window.
Rudolph Kopke, who lives on Bryant
and Eleventh streets, called upon Miss
Mary Foley at 1528 Howard street late
Thursday night. HÂ» had been drinking
heavily, and while waiting" for her ap
pearance he fell asleep. Miss Foley re
turned with a friend about 1 o'clock yes
terday morning and seeing a man In her
room concluded that he was a burglar.
She screamed, which awakened Kopke
out of his sleep, and in his muddled con
dition he rushed to the window arid
jumped out from the second story, A
few minutes later Policemen Parrell and
Ward found him unconscious on the side
walk and sent him to the City Prison in
the patrol wagon, where a. charge of
"drunk" was booked against him. He
was then taken to the Receiving Hos
pital, where Dr. Hartley found that three
fingers of his left hand and his eyebrow
and chin were cut. and his right wrist
sprained. Ho was released yesterday
morning.

WANT THEIR MOTHER HANGED
A Wife Excites Her Children's An
ger by Assaulting Her Husband.
A sad Urania <Â»f domestic depravity,
brought on by the Inordinate use of
streng drink, was enacted In the little cot
tage of Andrew Howard at 428^ Shotwell
street last evening, in which Agnea How
ard, the wife of Andrew Howard, and the
mother of four little children, ranging
from one to seven years of age, was the
aggressor.
The husband and father of this unhappy
family is a hard-working, industrious
man, who follows the business of a furni
ture polisher in the firm of Paterson &
Schentp, at 411 Shotwell street. On his
return from work yesterday evening at
half-paÂ«t 6 o'clock his wife asned him for
some money for liquor. This he refused,
which angered his better half to the ex
tent that she seized a lighted coal oil
lamp and threw it at him, breaking a
larfce mirror in doing so. Not satisfied
with this mode of revenge, she picked up
a small butcher knife and made a fur
1 ther assault on him. This time she was
I more successful, as she plunged the steel
blade into his left arm, making an in
cision eight inches long, from which the
blood spurted, and at the same time sev
ering one of the large tendons.
Howard closed in on his infuriated wife,
when he got another jab of the knife in
the back of the head. In the meantime
the blood from the wound in his arm had
spurted over his wife's white muslin
dress.
While this unnatural scene was being
enacted in the little cottage the oldest
I child, a little boy, ran Igto the Seven
j teenth street police station and informed
Lieutenant Price that his mother was
killing his father. Price dispatched Of
ficers Crowley and Graham to the Place
mentioned by the boy. While the officers
were on their way to the house Howard
entered the station and toiu his story to
Price. The patrol wagon was at once dis
patched to the house and the half-drunk
on woman and her four children brought
to the police station. Her appearance,
smearen as she was with the blood of
the husband, presented a disgusting
sight. The little children begged the of
ficers to hang her, and In their grief over
the fate of their father wanted their
mother sent to San Quentin, where they
hoped she would be "burned up." How
ard was sent to the Clip and County Hos
pital, where Drs. ' HopÃlns. Treuholtz and
Gibbons put fifteen stitches In the man's
arm and dressed the wound In his head,
which was but slight. On his return to
the police station Lieutenant Price sent
him and his little children to their home
and booked the woman wtlh an assault
with a deadly weanon. She was immedi
ately transferred to the Central police
station.
This unfortunate woman has been re
peatedly arrested for drunkenness within
the past year, and when the services of
the officers are required to take her to
the station It Invariably requires two of
the stoutest of the force to handle her. as
she is a powerfully built woman, weighing
over 200 pounds, while her unfortunate
husband is a small, delicate man.

Knickerbocker Fire Laddiss.
The forty-eighth anniversary of the or
ganization of Knickerbocker Engine Com
pany No. 5 of the Volunteer Fire Depart
ment of San Francisco was celebrated
last Sunday at Dexter's, in Sausallto, by
a reunion and dinner. The table was
tastefully decorated with choice flowers
sent for the occasion by Mrs. Howard
Coit, the honorary member of the com
pany, from her home in Larkspur. B. B.
Vreeland, the surviving foreman of the
company, presided. The few members of
the strongest company of the old depart
ment who were around the festive board
â¢were a forcible reminder of the old say
ing, "There are only a few of us left."
These were: Stephen Bunner. Peter Gian
ninni, John Hall, Thomas McCaully, Thos.
Langan, Harry Wheeler, James Grady,
James Kentzell, E. B. Vreeland and E.
T. Anthony, the secretary of the old or
ganization. As social guests there were
Mesdames Stephen Bunner, Lawrence
Sellenger, Zasarias, L. Dunn, W. H.
Miller. Thomas Sawyer, and Misses Lot
tie Anthony. Edna Anthony, Norle Dunn,
M Bender, Mamie Burns, Nellie O'Rourke
and Lizzie Grady. The Knickerbockers,
while they are growing less and less
every year, will keep up the pleasant cus
torn of remembering old associations
once a year until there shall remain but
one who will be able to proclaim, "I am
the lasi of the Knickerbockers," and he
will have a feast to himself yearly until
he shall be called upon to answer roll call
above.

The most critical period in a woman*
life may be properly called " Blossoming 1
Time." It is the period when she blossoms .
from girlhood into womanhood.
At this momentous time the best medi-
cine for a woman to take is Dr. Pierces
Favorite Prescription. It acts directly up-
on the delicate and important organs that
are to bear the burdens of wifehood and
motherhood. It makes them strong.
healthy and vigorous. It corrects all
irregularities and displacements and stops
exhausting drains. Taken during the pe-
riod of expectant maternity, it banishes
the usual annoyances and makes baby's
coming easy and almost painless. It in-
sures the new-comer's health and an ample
supply of nourishment. It transforms
weak, sickly, nervous, ' complaining wo-
men into happy, healthy wives. Thou-
sands of women have told over their own
signatures, the story of the marvelous
merits of this great medicine. An hon-
est dealer will not try to persuade you
to take something different from what you
ask for, for the sake of a few pennies ad-
ded profit.
Mrs. Anna Ulrich, of Elm Creek, Buffalo
Co., Neb., writes: "I was under doctors' care
for two year? with uterine disease. I was so
weak that I could sit up in bed only a few mo-
ments. I commenced taking Dr. Pierces Fa-
vorite Prescription and when I had taken one-
half dozen bodies I was up and going wherever
I pleased, and have been very strong ever since
: âthat was two years and a half ago."

"le Suffered.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON. Oct. 21.â
George W. Clark, the St. Helena frat
ricide, expiated his crime on the gal
lows this morning at 10:30 o'clock.
Though the murderer met his doom
with more fortitude than had been ex
pected his *ast moments were fraught
with such awful mental suffering that
many of the spectators at the execu
tion averted their eyes at the fateful
moment and failed to see the drop.
At 9 o'clock Warden Hale proceeded
t ) the death chamber and was in
formed by the condemned man that the
reading of the death warrant would be
waived. Mrs. Burns and a Salvationist
named Montgomery, both of Oakland,
were with -.ark until the moment he
left his cell, offering him religious con
solation. He informed them and Chap
lain Drahms that he was resigned to
his fate and believed that his soul
would be received in heaven.
Supported by two guards and pre
ceded by Chaplain Drahms he mounted
the steps to the scaffold with a fairly
firm step, took his stand upon the trap
and closed his eyes. His ups were
trembling and his hands nervously
twitching, but all he said until the
noose was adjusted was a continual
repetition of the words, "Bless the
Lord:"
Just as the black cap was about to
be placed over his head Clark feebly
asked to be permitted to speak a few
words. Hangman JLunt removed the
noose, but Clark's throat contracted
and he was unable to utter a sound.
The cap was placed in position, the
signal given and quickly came the end.
Clark's neck was broken by the fall
and the last pulsation had ceased in
nine minutes. By Clark's request the
remains were interred in the prison
cemetery. The execution was witnessed
by about seventy-five per3ons â an un
usually large number.
The crime for which Clark paid with
his life was the murder of his brother
at St. Helena last June. He had lived
for years with his brother's wife and
failing to put him out of the way with
poison shot him while he was prepar
ing a meal in the kitchen of his own
house.

coal on fire, and suggesting that, as he
had no further use for the vessel, she

about the political situation in the

AT SACRAMENTO
Election Officers Who
Are Disqualified.
NOT ON ASSESSMENT ROLL
DISCOVERY CAUSES QUITE A
COMMOTION.
Appointees Endeavor to Square
Themselves by Offering All
Sorts of Personal Prop
erty for Assessment.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 21.â The County
Board of Supervisors met a few day%
ago and selected the different election
officers to serve at the polling places on
November 8. On Thursday the Repub
lican County Central Committee met
and went over the lists. It was found
that the list of officers selected to serve
in the First Supervisorial District con
tained the names of men a very large
percentage of whom were not on the
assessment roll, as required by law.
It was also found, claim members of
the committee, that the names of Re
publicans handed by them to the Su
pervisor of the First District had been
ignored by him, and he had substituted
for these names those of alleged Re
publicans unknown to the Republican
County Central Committee. Steps were
at once taken to mandamus the Board
of Supervisors and compel it to re
vise the list.
This announcement caused a tremen
dous scrambling to-day on the part of
those election officers selected by the
Supervisors to get on the assessment
roll. When Assessor Berkey's office was
opened this morning a line of men was
found in waiting. The first of these
stepped forward and announced that he
had been overlooked when the Assessor
made up his personal property roll some
months ago, and that he had some
Jewelry on which he was anxious to
pay taxes. Another presented a watch,
which he said had escaped the vigilance
of the Assessor, and as he was am
bitious to bear his burden of the ex
penses of government he asked that the
watch be put down as valued at $50, the
tax on which is 88 cents. Others
claimed to own various articles coming
under the head of personal property.
Assessor Berkey was absent, and his
deputies refused to accept the respon
sibility of receiving these extraordinary
voluntary assessments. Berkey will be
back in two or three days, when it will
be settled whether these officers are to
be placed on the roll as taxpayers or a
new llÃt of election officers selected. It
was stated to-night by members of the
committee that a new list will be adopt
ed by the Supervisors without the ne
cessity of resorting to the courts.
BOERS FIGHTING
REBEL TRIBESMEN
There Is a Promise of a Prolonged
Campaign Before the Trouble
Is Over.
PRETORIA, Oct. 21.â Serious trouble is
brewing with the Magato tribe in the
Zoutpansberg district, south of the Lim
popo River. The natives recently killed
a Lutheran missionary and his family at
the town of Zoutpansberg, and the Trans
vaal Government sent an expedition to
punish them. The affair has now assumed
serious proportions.
Chief Opefu, with 20.000 followers fully
armed and with four cannons supplied by
white traders, attacked the leader.
Heavy fighting Is expected. The ultima
tum of General Joubert. demanding the
unconditional surrender, has been Ignored
by the tribesmen, and he has summoned
3000 Burghers to reinforce the 6000 now In
the field. The campaign promises to be
prolonged.

FARCICAL TRIAL
IN MARIN COUNTY
District Attorney With
the "Push."
POLITICS BEFORE BUSINESS
HENBY ALLEN'S PERSECUTION
A MOCKEBY.
Important Witnesses Not Called in
the Case â Taxpayers Grum
bling at Mr. Martinelli's
Methods.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 21.â 1t is an
.opinion commonly expressed in political
'circles that District Attorney E. B.
Martinelli is rather "slow," but the man
ner in which the prosecution of a man
charged with assault to commit mur
der was conducted here last Wednes
day has given rise to a notion that now
and then there is a method in his slow
ness.
A man named Henry Allen was ar
rested at Tamalpais on August 14 last
for shooting Joseph Malatesta. The
evidence given in the Justice Court
was deemed amply sufficient to justify
Allen being bound over to answer the
charge of assault with a deadly weapon,
with intent to commit murder, in the
Superior Court. On motion of the Dis
trict Attorney this was done.
At that time Martinelli aspired for
the Republican nomination for the ol
rice o-f which he is the incumbent, but
before the Superior Court trial he re
ceived the nomination through the in
strumentality of the Sausalito "push,
which proudly refers to him as its
â¢friend." This produced a decided
change in the result of the trial, at
least so far as appearances go.
Wednesday last the alleged "trial
occurred. It came so near being a farce
that peo-ple in general would laugh were
it not for the fact that such farces cost
taxpayers a good deal of money. Four
witnesses who gave vital testimony at
the preliminary examination were not
called at all and no real endeavor was
made to elicit the facts of the case frcmi
one o-f the witnesses who was called.
The four men not called were Michael
McNamara, Philip le Cornec, Daniel
Campbell and Frank Murray.
McNamara testified in the Justice
Court that Allen pushed Malatesta out
of his saloon and shot him while the
man was so drunk tnat he had twice
fallen. He heard Allen threaten to
shoot the plaintiff the night before the
trouble occurred and saw him exhibit
a revolver with the remark: "If this
gun is not of a large enough caliber
1 have one that Is." Le Cornec and
Campbell corroborated these facts in a
general manner, while Murray heard
the threats.
For lack of evidence Allen was ac
quitted, Sausalito's "friend" gained one
vote and the Ccmnty of Marin was
minus $150. The farcical trial is con
demned on every side and it is prophe
sied that a day of reckoning will arrive
before many days have passed. C iti
zens assert that they are willing to be
taxed for prosecuting offenses, but not
to furnish political friends during a
campaign. -

CONTINUOUS
OVATION TO
McKINLEY
Speeds Through Ohio
and Indiana.
ENTHUSIASM IS UNBOUNDED
AT ALL PLACES CHEEBS GBEET
THE PBESIDENT.
Most Imposing Demonstration of the
Day at Indianapolis, Where
an Interesting Address
Was Delivered.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CINCINNATI, Oct. 21.â One continu
ous ovation has marked the passage of
President William McKinley to-day
over the States of Indiana and Ohio.
Defying the wind and rain of a most
disagreeable October day, the citizens
of these States have congregated In
great numbers at every station along
the line, and never have they been dis
appointed, for the President has gra
ciously appeared at every point where
crowds awaited his coming, to speak a
few words to his constituents and re
ceive their approving cheers.
Perhaps the most imposing demon
stration of the day was at Indianapo
lis, where the streets through which the
President was driven to the State
house were jammed with cheering peo
ple. Here on the steps of the State
Capitol, almost within the shadow of
the statue of Thomas A. Hendricks, the
President delivered one of the most
striking and eloquent addresses on his
long Western tour. In the course of
it he paid graceful tribute to the mem
ory of Hendricks and referred also to
ex-President Harrison, both of which
references were received by the people
with deafening applause.
The desire of the President is always
to have the train stopped at every point
where any considerable crowd of people
are gathered to hear him, and conse
quently thÂ« special train to-day was
sometimes far behind the schedule
time, but under the direction of Dave i
N. Bell, who is in charge of the train,
the lost time was largely made up by
fast running.
At Connorsville, Ind., a two-months
old baby was handed over the railing
of the rear platform into the arms of
Secretary Wilson, who presented to the
President his youngest namesake â Wil
liam McKinley. Another humorous in
cident was when Secretary Wilson was
introduced after the President hal fin
ished his remarks at Connorsville.
Twice Mr. Wilson commenced to speak
and twice he was interrupted by the
starting of the train. Then Secretary
Gage shouted: "The eloquence of the
Secretary of Agriculture starts the
wheels going."
Amid great laughter Mr. Wilson then
concluded his brief address and the
train pulled out.
President McKinley was In this city
for two hours to-day. His visit brought
to the city an immense crowd of stran
gers, and all the city Itself seemed to
have turned out to give him a welcome.
The public schools suspended for the
forenoon and, all the pupils of the
grammar grades occupied University
Park, round which the Presidential
party passed in procession. The Presi
dent was accompanied by his wife and
by Secretary of the Treasury Gage,
Secretary of the Interior Bliss, Post
master General Smith and Mrs. Smith,
Secretary of Agriculture Wilson and
Miss Wilson, Assistant Secretary of
War Meiklejohn, J. A. Porter, private
secretary to the President, and Assist
ant Private Secretary Cortelyou.
The Presidential party disembarked
at Washington and Noble streets, on.
the eastern side of the city, entered
open carriages and drove to the Capitol
grounds.
At the Capitol grounds Senator Fair
banks introduced the President, who
said:
My Fellow-Citizens: I thank you for
the words of welcome spoken in your
behalf by your distinguished Senator. I
thank you for this cordial and hearty
freeting at the capital city of your great
tate. We meet in no party name; we
meet in the name of the country, of pa
triotism and of peace. (Great applause.)
It gives me peculiar pleasure to meet me
people of the city of the home residence
of that illustrious statesman and my pre
decessor in the great Presidential office,
Benjamin Harrison. (Tremendous ap
plause.) And I do not forget, in tnis
presence, that this was also the home of
that other distinguished Indlanan, Thomas
A. Hendricks. (Great applause.) Both
names are remembered by all of you, and
both men have been distinguished in the
service of their country.
My Fellow-Citizens: We are here to-day
because we love the old -ag. (Applause.)
It never went down in defeat; it was
never raised in dishonor. (Wild applause.)
It means more at this hour than it ever
meant in all our history, ft floats to-day
where It never floated before. (Great ap
plause.) Glorious old banner! The same
our grandsires lifted up; the same our
fathers bore!
"In many a battle's tempest it shed the
crimson rain,
"And what God hath woven in his loom
no man can break in twain."
(Great applause and cheers.)*
The war has heen successful. It ennea
in a little over a hundred days. Winners
of matchless victories on land and sea,
our army and navy are entitled to every
honor that a generous people can bestow.
(Tremendous applause and cheers.) A
matchless army and a fearless navy have
done their part. The rÂ»-st remains with
us. The war was inaugurated for human
ity. It must not stop until it embraces
humanity. It was not commenced in bit
terness- it was not commenced in malice
it was commenced in a spirit of humanity,
for freedom and to stop oppression, (ap
plause and cheers.) We cannot shirk the
obligations of victory If we would, and we
would not if we could. Happy are all free
peoples, too strong to be dispossessed, but
blessed are they among nations who dare
to be strong for the oppressed. (Tremen
dous applause.)
Following the speeches the procession
I was reformed and the President was
I epcorted to the Union station, where he
took the Cincinnati, Hamilton and
Dayton train for Cincinnati.

Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Oct. 21.â 1t has just come
to light that nearly $500,000 of the Ta
coma and Columbia River Railway
bonds were hypothecated in New York
last summer by brokers entrusted with
their sale. The bonds to the amount
named were turned over to them on
their statement that they had placed
the first $250,000 and later $750,000 of
the bonds. The proceeds were to be
used in extending the railroad from
Lake Park, a. suburb of Tacoma,
through the Cascade Mountains to the
Columbia River.
One of the brokers mentioned paid
President Bailey $15,000 for an interest
in the railway project. They sent Bai
ley $31,000 afterward, but the remit
tances then stopped, though large obli
gations were being incurred here for
labor and material.
Bailey left secretly for New York and
secured a relinquishment from the
brokers of all their interest in the
bonds. This did him little good, how
ever, since he found that they had been
hypothecated for comparatively small
sums In New York and Boston. He
claims that the proceeds of the hypoth
ecation, other than the amounts sent
him, were devoted to the brokers' per
sonal use. He threatened to arrest
them, but refrained in response to their
appeals. Besides he believed that such
a course would injure this enterprise.
The New York Stock Exchange was
notified that the bonds had been ille
gally disposed of and the company
would not recognize the title of the
holders.
This fact is said to have caused
trouble for President Baltes of the
Merchants 1 and Traders' Bank, New
York, whose resignation has just been
requested by the bank's directors.
Baltes is believed to have innocently
purchased the bonds of Bailey's orokeis.
Bailey wrote him in September inform
ing him how the bonds had been se
cured and asking him how many his
bank held. Bultes made no reply,
whereupon Bailey sent copies of his let
ter to Baltes to Director Pool and the
cashier of Baltes' bank. An investiga
tion followed and the request fen- Baltes'
resignation is supposed to be the re
sult.
Another result of the bond manipula
tion has been the complete reorganiza
tion of the Tacoma and Columbia Rail
way, the dropping of the two brokers
as directors und the election as di
rectors of several of the richest men in
the Northwest. President Bailey will
go to New York next week, where he
expects to recover nearly all of the
hypothecated bonds and sell them in a
legitimate manner. Work on the rail
road wUI then be resumed.
PRESIDENT BALTES
SUMMARILY REMOVED
NEW YORK, Oct. 21.â The Mechanics'
and Traders' Bank, concerning which
there developed some adverse rumors
over night, mad^ its exchanges as usual
at the clearing-house to-day. Among
the bank presidents downtown the be
lief prevailed that the bank is perfectly
solvent and that it will go right on, al
though there might be some changes in
the management. At a directors' meet
ing late in the day President Baltes
was deposed and Vice President Lee
Schlinger made president.
The publication of the story that
President Baltes had been offering his
notes on the street caused a crowd to
collect In front of the bank before the
doors were opened to-day and when
business began depositors lined up to
the paying teller's window. All de
mands were promptly met.
Officials of the bank assured the
waiting depositors that the bank was
perfectly solvent and that 5100,000 in
cash had been received at the bank for
those who wished to withdraw. No
body, however, seemed to care to with
draw from the line. One German with
drew $8000, and from that figure down
to $100 was drawn out. Information as
to the amount paid out this morning
was refused.
At 11 o'clock this morning there were
about 300 men in line waiting to draw
money from the bank.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 21.â Billy Gal
lagher, formerly of Oakland, the Idol of

of Salt Lake, but now claiming this city
for his home, fought fifteen rounds to a
draw here to-night. The decision of Ref

fight took place before the Los Angeles
Athletic Ciub.
Gallagher did most of the leading; and
forced the fighting throughout, but In the
I fourteenth round he was all but out when
! time was called. The fifteenth round was
a terrific one, but both men were on their
1 feet and anxious when time was called.

SAN JOSE, Oct. 21.â The Grand En
campment, I. O. O. F., completed its la
bors this afternoon and adjourned. The I
last hour of the session was given over j
to speechmaklng and a sort of Jolli- i
fication. Remarks were made by Grand i
Patriarch Harris, Grand High Priest !
Foster, Grand Junior Warden Wever, j
Grand Scribe Barnes, Grand Treasurer j
Lemont and John Glasson, past grand \
representative.
ThlÃ afternoon many of the visitors
went to Alum Rock Park. The even-
Ing trains carried most of the encamp- j
ment members and Patriarchs" Mill- |
taut to their homes. Those that re
main over will visit Mount Hamilton
to-morrow.
The Grand Encampment appropri
ated $200 to assist in the golden jubilee
celebration of the order to be held in
California next year. The sum of $150
was also appropriated, to be used with
a like sum to be given by the grand
trustees, to purchase a life interest in
the Thermalito Home for Ernest Dun
ker, past grand sentinel.
The proposition to raise the member- j
ship fee from $5 to $10 was defeated. |
It was decided that the fact that the j
encampment has a member in the
Thermaiito Home does not relieve such
encampment from paying benefits to j
said member if sick, and such benefits
must be paid.
The following grand officers were
then installed: Grand patriarch, J. W.
Harris; grand high priest, Joseph Fos
ter; grand senior warden, P. D. Gum

DERAILED ON THE
NEW STEEL BRIDGE
NARROW ESCAPE OF A LOADED
OAKLAND LOCAL.
It Left the Rails on the New Steel
Trestle and Nearly Went Off
Into the Water.
OAKLAND, Oct. 21.â The new steel
bridge built by the Southern Pacific at the
foot of Harrison street and opened two
weeks ago, commenced its record of acci
dents to-night. A passenger train was de
railed and only by one foot was It saved
from going over the trestle. The conduc
tor landed in the water, but beyond a
fright to the passengers, no other per
sonal injuries were received. ,
The accident was due to the error or a
switchman. That the train was not
thrown into the estuary and many lives
lost is miraculous.
There are switches at the approaches
to either end of the Harrison-street
bridge and these are to be operated auto
matically. They are not yet in proper
shape and are therefore worked by hand.
F Underwood is the switchman at the
Aiameda end and J. Sullivan at the Oak
land side. According to Underwood, it is
a difficult matter for him to distinguish
the broad gauge from the narrow gauge
locals since both come from the same di
rection, and there is little difference in
time.
When the Aiameda local approached
the bridge both switchmen were at their
posts of duty, and Underwood, as the
train glided across the estuary, switched

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY'S pfefHL
FLOODS IN WINTER, NO WATBB
IN SUMMER.
Army of Fire-Fighters Meets With
Some Success â Five Arrests at
Pasadena Cause a Sen
sation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PASADENA, Oct. 21.â The furious
forest fires have now been stayed from
licking up the Mount Lowe Alpine
Tavern. This was the fourth denuding
blaze that has swept over the moun
tains back of Pasadena this season.
Last night the flames lit ur> the heav
ens and made it light enough in this
city to read by. To-night the worst is
passed, and the fires are burning down
Eaton's canyon. All the sides of the
canyon have been denuded, and it must
spend Us fury by morning.
It was only by herculean efforts that
the beautiful Alpine Tavern among the
pines on Mount Lowe was saved this
morning. Two hundred men under the
lead of Manager Torrence and Raneer
Thomas fought It back and saved the
property as well as the vegetation
along the scenic railway. All day and
all night men chopped trees and cleared
paths with hoes and shovels to fight
back the fire fiend in his wild ravings.
When they would think they had it un
der control, some giant pine burned off
at the base would roll down another
canyon or ravine, distributing a thou
sand torches through the tinder-like
vegetation.
All declared that the fires must have
been from maliciousness. Five men are
under arrest and others are suspected.
The places where the fires started and
the manner of their starting indicate
that they could not have come from
campers or hunters. Sensational de
velopments are looked for in the ar
rests.
As the mountains have been thus de
nuded for many square miles, grave
fears are expressed regarding the water
supply of the whole San Gabriel Valley.
Floods may be expected this winter
and a water shortage next summer.
Many of the Seventh Regiment sol
diers were among the fire fighters and
did as much good as if they had gone to
Manila. To-night the men are return
ing tired, torn and brown from the
scorching. Forest Supervisor Newhall.
whose particular reservation this is, de

the train over to the new broadgauge
tracks that are to soon transform the
narrow-gauge system running to the Ala
meria mole.
Kngineer White- spor realized tha Hiis
take and brought his train to a standstill
In backing the train on to the bridge str
that it might be switched to the proper
track, the forward wheels of the last car
but one split the switch, crowding the
east side wheels over the rails, derailing
the car and forcing it to within a few
inches of the edge of the trestle. The last
coach, a smoker and baggage car, had al
ready been moved back on the bridge,
and in another instant car 1688 would
have toppled over into the waters of the
estviry, dragging the smoker and per
haps other coaches with it. The train
was loaded with passengers at the time,
as the traffic of the early evening trains
is especially heavy on account of the re
turn of many laborers to their homes In
the Encinal city, and the loss of life, if
any, would therefore have been great.
A wrecking train and crew was imme
diately dispatched to the scene of the
accident, arriving about an hour after the
occurrence and coming by way of East
Oakland, Fruitvale and Alameda. After
three solid hours of hard work the de
railed train was returned to its tracks.
During the interim all traffic was ob
structed and the passengers were com
pelled to make their way to the Alameda
electric cars over a narrow cinder path
way the best they knew how. In step
ping off the train Conductor Alex Bu
chanan, who was in charge and whose
misfortune it is to have experienced more
close calls and narrow escapes than any
one on the local runs, fell into the estu
ary The water was not as deep as was
the mud, and the conductor went in up
to his neck and was extricated with con
siderable difficulty.
By 11 o'clock both broad and narrow

PARIS. Oct 21.â English yellow jour

There [a no question that the relations

due to the blustering attitude of the

MARCHAND'S REPORT
IGNORES KITCHENER
PARIS, Oct. 21. â Captain Baratier of
Major Marchand's expedition, on hia
arrival at Cairo with his papers for the
French Government, said the mission
had not lost an officer or a soldier. He
added that the health of all the mem
bers of the party was very good and
that revlctualing on the march was
easy.
Major Marchand's report, telegraphed
from Cairo during the night, does not
tion the arrival at Fashoda of Gen
eral Kitchener, and only gives an ac
â¢ of the incidents of the expedition,
v.ith an elaborate description of the
followed, the places occupied, th~
i:. .inner of occupation, the raising of
the flag, the force left at each point
and the treaties of submission conclud
ed with the tribes, in addition to
: ing to an encounter with the Der
vishes.
It is believed in certain quarters that
Captain Baratier Is the bearer of a
verbal report, which the French au
thorities were not willing to trust upon
the British telegraph lines.
The report only goes as far as the
beginning of September, and says that
on August 20 the supplies of the party
â were abundant. The reason for the
nmission of any mention of the arrival
:it-ral Kitchener at Fashoda is said
t i be the fact that the report of Major
Marchand waa not ready when Captain
IJ.trati^r left Fashoda. When the cap
tain started from that place he did
not think, he would go beyond Khar
toum.
Major Marchand, however, deemed it
impracticable to send the finished por
tion of the report, intending to dispatch
the remainder of it as soon as Captain
Haratier returned. But the captain, on
arriving .'it Omdurman, found there in
tions flline him to go on to Cairo,
from which place he will proceed to
France.

Mr. Redmond said: "The sym

FRENCHMEN INFLAMED
AND MORE DEFIANT
PARIS, <>. t. 22. â A remarkable
change has come over French opinion
on the Fashoda Question during the
past forty-eight hours. The attitude of
public is more inflam.-d and more
defiant. This is partly due to the tone
of the British press, but more to the
threatening spirit of the British Chan
of the Exchequer, Sir Michael
Hicks-Beach, which the Autorite calls
"a provocation that is almost a threat
of war."
The Municipal Council of Paris
is abused on all sides for ex
horting the Government to avert
w.ir. In Government circles the
disposition seems to. be to re
sist the BritifÂ»h demands. It in re
ported that the policy of France, as
definitely stated to Great Britain, in
cludes thf retention of Fashoda. Ru
mors that the Russian Foreign Min
ister, Count Muravieff, has assured M.
del Casse, the French Fortign Minis
ter, of Russia's support in the contro

higher officials, although these continue
to maintain a conciliatory tone and de
clare that France Is prepared to

INSANITY AND DEATH
CAUSED BY FICKLENESS
North Dakota Volunteer Followed
From Cuba by a Sweetheart,
Who Goes Mad, and Then
He Is Found Dead.
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 21.â A special to the
Republic from Deadwood, S. D., says: Al
bert -Martin, a rancher living near the
Cheyenne River in Zlebeck County, en
listed as a volunteer at the beginning: of
the war and fought at the battle of El
Caney. After the battle he met Ramona
Perez, the daughter of an officer of Gar
cia's command, and they beep me sweet
hearts. Soon afterward he was attacked
by fever and sent horn* on sick leave. He
was engaged before his departure for the
war to the daughter of a neighboring
lanchman and arranged to be married
while home on his leave of absence.
Meanwhile the Cuban girl had learned
of his illness and that he had gome home,
and she resolved to follow and nurse him.
Dressing In her brother's clothes she
i crossed to Jamaica and secreted herself
on a fruit steamer bound for New Or
leans. Reaching there she tramped and
beat her way to Hermosa. S. D. When
she arrived she learned of her lover's ap
proaching marriage and the shock drove
her insane. At the same time the Ameri
can girl learned of her lover's flirtation
and broke off the engagement. Martin
began drinking heavily and disappeared.
A few days ago his body was found float-
Ing in th- Cheyenne River. Whether he
fell in while intoxicated or committed
suicide Is a matter of conjecture.
SECRETARY GAGE UPHELD.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 21.â Judge Cox, :
in the District Supreme Court, to-day de- '
cided the ens*s of George B. Wlghtman !
and of William 11. Wharton against Sec- !
rotary Gage in favor of th<? Secretary of
the Treasury. One suit sought an injunc- I
tlon and the othK-r a mandamus, the basis !
of complaint in each being the rejection
by the Secretary of the Treasury of bids
submitted for the recent war loan bond i
IpÂ«uc by the complainants. Secretary j
Gage refected the bids, believing thai the

Judge Cox to-day held that, under the

Congress was that they should ro to Indi

It Is Supposed the Passengers Es

Beach.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE. Oct. 21.â Tappan Adney,
a correspondent of Harpt-r's Weekly,
i\h.' arrived here Wednesday from St.
Michael on the steamer Roanoke, brings
the news of the probable loss of the
small ateamer Abbie Rowe in Norton
Sound.
The steamer had on board eleven per
sons composing the Abbie Rowe Dartv
of Boston. The party left St. Michael
September 11 for t'hingik Mission, lo
cated on Golofrim Bay, about eighty
five miles north of St. Michael. Barrine
accident they should have reached their
destination in three or four days.
Dr. Brigham and wife, Mrs.' Rowe,
Mi^s Blame and another lady, members
of the party, considered the vessel in
capable of weathering a severe storm
and took pa?sarÂ on a schooner which
left a few days before the steamer for
Chinglk Mission, where they were to
meet the remainder of the party. After
vainly waiting BOrne time Captain Wil
liam S. Taylor, late engineer of the re,
enue cutter Bear, and M. P. Melsins:.
formerly of Pan Francisco, began a
search for the missing steamer in the
yacht Edith. They followed the coast
to St. Michael without success.
Just before the Roanoke left St. Ml- <
chael, Adney says, a party arrived from
the north with a story to the effect
that the Indians had reported a small i
steamer wrecked, stating that they s'\v
a small crowd of men on the beach '
around a fire. It was generally believed !
that this must have been the party
fic-m the Abble Rowe.
Adney also reported that while
searching for the missing vessel Cap
tain Taylor and Melsing picked up a
man In an open boat several miles at
! sea. The man had been without fond
i or water for several days and was Ster
! ling Martin of Chicago, who was left
: adrift on a barge which was being 1
j towed from St. Michael to Golofrim
j Bay by the steamer Fortune Hunter
i with a Chicago party on board. The
! Fortune Hunter was caught in a storm
i and was forced to cut loose the barge.
! Several days afterward the Fortune
Hunter was picked up by the steamer
Tillamook in a water-logged condition.
An unsuccessful search was made for
Martin. After being cut loose from the
Fortune Hunter the barge foundered
and Martin put to sea in a small boat.
ST. JAMES HOTEL AT

BAN JOSE, Oct. 21.â The sale of the
St. James Hotel to James Campbell, the
Honolulu capitalist, is now being ar
ranged, and transfer of the property will
be made in about a month. At present
Campbell is at the islands, but will return

months ago to satisfy a $75,f>00 mortgage
given to secure a loan from the Lick trust
Campbell and his family have spent
their summers here for several years past,

However, Military Electricians oJ
High Standing Think a Line

Operated.
Social Dlfpatch to The Call.
NEW T< IRK, Oct 21.â A special to
the Post from Washington says: While
at Honolulu the American Commission
ers appointed to arrange the details of
annexation made gome inquiry as to
the cost and practicability of a cable
connecting the islands with the United
States. Tht-y bring a rather gloomy re
port. Baying there is an almost fatal
obstacle in the way of such a cable.
Soundings have been taken showing
a depth of more than six miles In the
Pacific Ocean, along the track of the
Kuro Slwo or Japanese current, which
corresponds to the gulf stream in the
Atlantic <H->-an, but is much wider.
From edge to edge they say it is hun
dreds of miles In width and between
the United States and Hawaii it ap
pears either to have cut a channel to
an enormous depth or else to have
sought a naturul aby.ss in the earth's
crust through. which to How. They say
that cable-layers fear lest it may be
impossible to anchor cables across this
vast water-swept space because the
force of the current may part the
metal. Cables have been successfully
laid in water as deep as this in the
Indian Ocean, but there was nothing
corresponding to the Japanese current
to contend with.
Military electricians of high standing
and acquainted with all the details of
cable-laying do not agree with this re
port. They assert that no particular
difficulty is likely to he experienced in
laying a cable between California and
Hawaii, but that very serious difficulty
might be found in extending the line
from Hawaii to Hongkong. As t >
"anchoring" the cable, they say that
nothing is done in that line beyond
weighting with heavy armor, which Is
expected to carry it to the bottom,
where it will lie in place of itself. Al
lowance is made for inequalities of the
ocean's floor by making the cable about
20 per cent longer than the route It
follows as measured on the surface.
This margin f<>r slack is the result of
averaging experiences with various
submarine cables.
LILLIAN RUSSELL FREE

Miss Russell denied the charge, and

WILLING TO
GIVE UP THE
PHILIPPINES
But Spain Hopes for
Compensation.
TIME, HOWEVER, IS WASTED
UNCLE SAM WILL NOT PAY FOB
CONQUERED TERRITORY.
So the American Commissioners Will
Stand By Their Instructions
Not to Agree to Spend
One Cent.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 21.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Appreciating that the power
of the rebels in the Philippines has in
creased to such an extent that Spain
will not be able to reduce them to sub
jection without a large expenditure of
life and money, public opinion in Spain
Is willing to Bee them pass into the con
trol of the United States if adequate
compensation is obtained.
The Sagasta government, according
to information which has reached here,
is proceeding in accordance with this
Idea and when the subject of control,
disposition and government of the Phil
ippines comes before the Paris Peace
Commission it is expected that strenu
ous efforts wil! be made to obtain from
the United States some equivalent for
the territory which this Government
may demand.
In some well-informed quarters here
the opinion prevails that the Spanish
Commissioners will continiie as long as
they dare to oppose the acquisition of
any portion of the Philippines by the
United States, and when they iind that
the American Commissioners are firm
in their demand will suggest the trans
fer of territory on condition that the
United States shall assume a portion
of the Cuban debt.
It can be stated on authority, how
ever, that Spain will lose time by en
deavoring to obtain a money consid
eration from the United States in ex
change for territory. The American
Commissioners have instructions not to
agree to pay Spain a cent for any ter
ritory nor to assume any portion of the
Cuban or other debts which the Span
ish Government ha? contracted and for
which Cuba and the Philippines were
surety. Officials say it would be ridi
culous for the United States to pay a
conquered nation for agreeing to de
mands which as conqueror It has a
right to make and secure compliance
with.
SPANIARDS WASTE
TIME IN ARGUMENT
PARIS, Oct. 21.â The joint session of
the Peace Commission to-day lasted
from 2 p. m. to 4:30 p. m. During this
time the Commissioners discussed the
second series of written arguments put
forward by the Spaniards for the Dur
pose of prevailing upon the American
Commissioners to assume the Cuban
debt. No definite (.inclusion was reach
ed, and the Commissioners adjourned
until Monday, when the Cuban Ques
tion will again be discussed. It is Droli
able that this feature of the negotia
tions will be disposed of next week.
Thus far there have been seven iolnt
s iuions, four of which have been de
voted to the discussion of the first ar
ticle of the protocol. In this manner
two weeks have passed and no result
has been reached. The American Com
missioners have listened to all the ar
guments of the Spaniards, but they
have not changed the position which
they first assumed in refusing to take
over the Cuban debt.
SAGASTA LOSES A
FAITHFUL COUNSELOR
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1888, by James Gor
don Bennett.
MADRID, Oct. 21.â Senor Moret has
become detached from Senor Sagasta,
whose faithful counselor he has been
fn the peace negotiations. To-day it
was ostentatiously announced that
Senor Moret had left Madrid f.>r his
country place. The cause of his de
parture is political Jealousies.
For some time the press has daily
commented upon the fact that Senor
Sagasta received communications from
Sonor Montero Rios, and before he call
ed other Ministers he invariably re
ceived a visit from Senor Moret.
The latest advices from Paris repre
sent the discussions of the Commis
sioners as more cordial than in the first
days. To-day there is no lonerer talk
here of the Cuban debt as belonging to
Spain, but the discussion is over the
manner in which the United States will
guarantee it.
EVACUATION DELAYED
BEYOND DATE FIXED
WASHINGTON, Oct. 21.â 1t is now
certain that the complete evacuation of
Cuba will bo delayed beyond the period
originally fixed by the administration.
This follows entirely without reference
to anything that has occurred in Paris
before the Peace Commission. The
War Department has about satisfied
itself that the task imposed upon the
Spanish authorities, namely, the re
moval and transportation to a great
distance by sea of about 120,000 sol
diers, sick and well, with their accou
terments, is beyond the ability of the
Spaniards.
Delay in the evacuation of Cuba will
cause a delay in the relinquishment of
sovereignty by the Spaniards over the
entire island, which was set for De
cember 1. It is hardly deemed prudent
to undertake to assume charge of the
municipal affairs of Havana so long as
the city contains a strong garrison of
Spanish troops, and it la felt that law
and order could be better maintained
in such centers by allowing them to re
main under Spanish jurisdiction until
they are evacuated by the troops and
reocoupied by United States troops. It
is not to be understood from this that
the American Military Commissioners
are in any sense abating the pressure
they have brought to bear upon the
Spanish Military Commission to secure
the evacuation of the island and the
relinquishment of Spanish sovereignty.
On the contrary, they have redoubled
their efforts to secure these objects, but
are not disposed to insist upon the per
formance of impossible tasks, and their
demands will be largely shaped by their
knowledge that the Spaniards art act
ing in perfectly good faith in their ef
forts to carry out the terms of the pro
tocol.

fore the Coroner.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Oct. 21.â The inquest over
the remains of Harold Frederic, the
newspaper correspondent and author,
who died suddenly on Wednesday
morning at Henley of heart disease,
was adjourned to-day until Wednesday
next.
The evidence presented was some
what sensational. Mr. Frederic's
daughter Ruth said her father did not
believe in doctors. She added that it
was with his consent, but under the
; influence of others, that Mrs. Mills, a
! Christian scientist, was summoned to
I attend him.
Kate Lyon, a member of Frederic's
; household, testified that the deceased
had asked her to call in Mrs. Mills, and
: that the latter came to the house and
; expounded the system followed by the
Christian scientists. On the same day
j Mr. Frederic dismissed the doctors who
had been in attendance on him. Most
of Mrs. Mills' treatment, continued the
witness, was what was known as '^b
; sent treatment."
At the request of friÂ»nds of the sick
I man the doctors were again summoned,
! but the deceased informed them that
when they previously attended him he
had not followed their directions.
John Stokes, Mr. Frederic's amenu
ensis, testified that he had informed
Kate Lyon that she might be charged
with manslaughter if Mr. Frederic
should die without receiving medical
I treatment.
Drs. Brown and Freybergrer, the phy
sicians who had attended Mr. Frederic,
said the deceased had suffered from
1 rheumatic fever, and that he was para
| lyzed on one side. His death, they as
i serted, was due to syncope. Both de
! clared their belief that with proper
I treatment the patient would have re
â  covered.
The inquest was adjourned until

i Mills will be examined.

the camp's history, considerable dim- j
culty in getting requisitions filled, al- j
though he had no difficulty in getting
them approved by the authorities at
Washington. One requisition made
on the 16th of May and another on the
4th of June had not been entirely filled i
until very recently. These requisitions j
had been made upon the New York
supply depot, while all that were made
on the St. Louis department had been j
promptly filled. One hundred and six- j
teen rots ordered in the beginning of j
the season had only arrived a day or |
two since. And they were not now â 
needed.

at Fort McPherson, expressed the opin- |

sick man's clothing under his pillow
when he enters a hospital, and Mr.
Nave said that the man often never j

In a word, the thieving which has ,
been going on and the petty specula- '

A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION.
GENERAL public attention should be called to
the fact that at the election next month the
people are to vote upon calling a cunstitu
. on to revise the fundamental law of the
State.
The constitution provides that: "When two-thirds
of the members elected to each House of the Legisla
ture shall deem it necessary to revise this constitution
they shall recommend to the electors to vote at the
next general election for or against a convention for
that purpose, and if a majority of the electors v I
at such election on the proposition for a convention
shall vote in favor thereof, the Legislature shall, at
its next session, provide by law for calling the same."
The importance of this matter is incapable of over
estimate. The prospect of a revision which may give
us practically a ne.v constitution invests the attitude
of public men and the trend of public issues with a
irtancc
The present constitution was produced, unfortun
ately, in the potent passion of the sandlot spasm,
which disfigured the reputation of California, and one
necessity for its revision, or substitution by a more
sane instrument, is that the courts have been com
pelled, in construing it. to Ã¼bsulete so much of it
matter that was in conflict with rights entrenched in
the Federal constitution, and so much that sought to
leap over the prohibitions of that supreme law of the
land.
If we attempt revision in the delirium of successful
sandlotism that would follow the election of the fusion
State ticket, we will be sure to make matters worse in
stead of bettering them. The fusion movement has
filled the air with fads as it is filled with thistle-down
by the summer wind, and the success of the job lot of
fanatical ideas that are the cargo of the fusion move
ment woula displace sanity and system for the time
being, and all sound notions of government would be
suspended during the process of making a new con
stitution.
The duty of citizens to beat Maguire and the fusion
scheme is emphasized by the prospect of all the rights
of person and property, which are committed to the
care of the State, being put in a state of flux again, to
be the sport of experiment by successful sandlotters
and fanatics.
The motley set of principles for which Maguire
stands would then be regarded as proper provisions
for the fundamental law, and the State would receive
a constitution that would fit it like a horsehair shirt.
imparting more torment than protection.
It is, then, in the nature of a civic emergency to
have a constitutional convention impending during
such a campaign as the fusionists have inaugurated
and Maguire is carrying on. In such an emergency
the good sense and local loyalty of the people must
assert themselves, in the defeat of the fusion ticket,
to the end that a probable and possible new consti
tution may not be a prolonged screed and discordant
screech against all human institutions.
Private Meadors of the Eighth has been acquitted
of the charge of murder. The fact ought to comfort
Private Rosser of the Tennessee regiment. The ex
tenuating circumstance urged on behalf of Meadors
seemed to be that he was sorry. Doubtless Rosser
is just as sorry. From an unbiased standpoint the
act of Meadors seemed far worse than that of Rosser.
It was deliberate, while the other assassin acted under
the impulse of alcohol insanity, a poor enough excuse,
to be sure, but one which permits belief in the ab
sence of malice. Meadors is of course to be con
gratulated, but it may reasonably be hoped that he
will refrain from further slaughter. Trials are ex
pensive.
With becoming modesty the Examiner claims
credit for improved ferry service. Other people had
thought the prospect of a rival line had something to
do with the matter, and will be glad to be enlightened.
This is the Examiner's greatest feat since its brilliant
victory over Monte jo at Manila, when, as will be re
membered, its man Dewey did quite well.
Editor Hearst certainly received a warm welcome
after his long absence. If he still regards San Fran
cisco as his home, however, it is likely that the motto
above his desk is not exactly "God bless our home."
There is not time left for Henley to take out his
first papers. While reputable citizens of Mexico are
welcomed here, there are certain formalities to be
observed before they can be eligible to office.
Some correspondent evidently dreamed that latest
fight at Manila. Nobody ought to be permitted to
dispose of his nightmare phantoms at space rates.
The wards which Phelan has decided contain no
men good enough to represent them in the Board of
Supervisors must feel flattered and friendly.
Murderer Clark has been hanged, and deserves the
tribute of praise for having been so scared that he
could not talk on the scaffold.
IS HENLEY ELIGIBLE?
IN his first speech in the campaign Mr. Henley took
occasion to make a personal attack on his oppo
nent, Judge Murphy. The man who begins a per
.l attack cannot complain if the same weapons
are turned against him. The Call has printed the doc
umentary evidence that Henley turned his back on
his own country, prostrated himself before an im
perial usurper in Mexico, called him "Sire" and
begged to be made one of his "subjects," as his "Im
perial Majesty had deigned to do in the case of other
foreigners." His "Imperial Sire" "deigned" and
made him a "subject." Henley. Hoosier-born, and
reared in California, a free citizen of this republic, de
| in Ins humble petition to his Imperial "Sire"
that Mexico under the "new government," an em
pire, was the best country in America.
The liberty wrested from Spain by revolution had
been stricken down by the Austrian Prince, backed by
the armies of France. The republic, which had been
evolved out of tiie courage of generations of patriots,
had been buried, and an empire. gewgawed and gar
nished, tawdried and tricked out in all the tinsel and
forms of the most exclusive royal court in Europe,
had been founded on its grave.
Juarez, the patriot Aztec, was a naked fugitive,
hiding in the caves and chaparral of the mountains.
Human freedom and the rights of man had been ban
ished and a foreign army rode the land with a hard
hoof, when Barclay Henley, free born, of full age, and
having an estate of movable and immovable property
in this republic, declared that Mexico was his prefer
ence among all the nations of the Americas! He cast
off his birthright as the citizen of a republic, pros
trated himself at the toes of a usurping Emperor, and
begged his "Imperial Sire" to make him a '"subject."
At this distance of time it looks like a scene in
opera bouffc Armed with the naturalization papers
which his "'lmperial Sire" had "deigned" to bestow
upon him, he set sail for San Francisco, as to a
foreign country. Landing here, he waited upon the
French Consul, then the subject of another Imperial
Sire, saluted him as the subjects of "Sires" do when
they meet, and put himself under that Consul's "pro
tection. "
The United States had no diplomatic relations with
Henley's "Imperial Sire"' in Mexico and subjects of
the "Sire" wore consigned, with other merchandi-'j,
is and chattels, to the diplomatic and consular
representatives of France. But those were ticklish
times here. France had a large army in Mexico.
Renegades like Henley were crossing the line to find
their "Sire" and support his empire, and in the stress
of our Civil War a sudden turn in European affairs
â¢ project the French forces, commanded by Mar
shal Bazaine. arro-< our borders. So General Mc-
Dowell called ; " :e subject of his "Imperial
Sire." to account w i*en he landed here. Senor Hen
ley responded that evidence that he was a subject of
the Mexican empire had been deposited with the
French Consul, and that ended the incident.
Finally the fortunes of war turned. Juarez came
down from the heights, gathered the wide scattered
patriots together, nnd Henley's Imperial Sire fell at
Queretaro. History gained a tragedy, the Monroe
doctrine gained a point, and Senor Henley lost his
"Sire."
It is for the voters of San Francisco to decide
whether they want to elect a man who deserted his
country and flag, washed off his American citizenship
as if it were the dirt left in a bath, and knelt to an
Emperor with a prayer that he would "deign" to make
him a "subject."
PORTO RICO OND THE PEACE
JUBILEE.
A COINCIDENCE, auspicious in every respect,
is to be noted in the fact that the celebration of
the great peace jubilee at Chicago, which was
national in its scope, took place on the same day
that the American rlag was formally raised above the
public buildings at San Juan, and Porto Rico became
essions of the United States.
A beautiful and impressive harmony prevailed
throughout the speeches made at the two cere
monies so widely separated in space and so different
in their natures. General Henry, in addressing the
Alcalde and the citizens of San Juan, said to them:
"To-day the flag of the United States floats as an
emblem of undisputed authority over the island of
Porto Rico, giving promise of protection of life, of
liberty, prosperity and right to worship God accord
ing to conscience. * * * Your future destiny
rests largely with yourselves. I congratulate you all
in beginning your public life under these new aus
pices, free from governmental oppression."
Almost at the same time those words were being
spoken at San Juan Archbishop Ireland was rousing
the audience at Chicago to the highest levels of
patriotism by reminding them: "With America goes
far and wide what America in her grandest ideal rep
resents â democracy and liberty â a government of the
people, by the people, for the people. This is Ameri
canism more than American territory, American ship
ping or American soldiery. Where this grandest
ideal of American life is not held supreme, America
has not reached; where this ideal is supreme,
America reigns."
It is gratifying to learn from the reply made by the
Alcalde to General Henry that the people of Porto
Rico have an understanding of what Americanism is.
They recognize that they have gained by the transfer
of the sovereignty of their island from Spain to the
United State-.
In the course of his speech the Alcalde said: "Porto
Rico has not accepted American dominion on account
of force. She came willingly and freely, hoping,
hand in hand with the greatest of all republics, to ad
vance in civilization and progress, and to become a
part of the republic to which we pledge our faith for
ever."
That cordial acceptance of the sovereignty of a
conqueror, not as a power imposed by military force
but as a blessing, is, we believe, unparalleled in the
annals of war. It shows how nearly we have come to
living up to our ideals of which Archbishop Ireland
spoke. We have so far been true to them that we
have made eveji our foes in war recognize them and
believe we are sincere in them. Truly President Mc-
Kinley was justified in saying at Chicago: "It is
gratifying to us all to know that this has never ceased
to be a war of humanity, and I am sure it is the uni
versal prayer of American citizens that justice, hu
manity and civilization shall characterize the final set
tlement of peace as they have distinguished the pro
gress of the war."
Nobody can make any sane person believe that a
man who lives in one ward can by taking a grip and
a nightshirt to another ward make himself a resident
of the latter.
Phelan is inclined to smile at the charge of having
colonized voters and candidates. There was a time
when Sternberg smiled about the same things.
It may be said for the Bulletin that it has reached
the intellectual stage where it thinks that it thinks.
THE SA^ FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1898.
THE NEXT BOORD OF SUPERVISORS.
rOR the taxpayers and the people generally of
San Francisco no issue of the election is of more
importance than that involved in the election of
the new Board of Supervisors. Upon the majority
of that body depends the control of local affairs, and
every desire of the community for economy, improve
ment, honesty and good government is included in
the contest.
The majority of the present board are virtually the
appointees of Mayor Phelan. He dictated their nomi
nation, and it was on his indorsement, and perhaps
largely by the use of his money, they were elected.
Mr. Phelan had hefted them before their nomination
and decided they were solid, reliable and as good as
gold.
They have now been tried by a truer scale than that
of the Mayor's hefting, and have been found false
throughout. Never in our history have we had more
corruption among the Supervisors, more scandals of
municipal jobbery and a more shameless "solid nine
than that which was foisted by Phelan and his push
upon the city and county at the last election.
A people so badly fooled are not likely to be fooled
again in the same way by the same man. Mayor
Phelan has once more presented to the electors as
candidates for their suffrages a set of men selected by
himself for the office of Supervisor. Their nomina
tion at the Mayor's dictation was made this time even
more audaciously than was that of the majority of the
present board. To a great extent they are unknown
men, but this much is certain â if they keep their
pledges they will be the creatures of the "plus hat
boss." Is it to be doubted that men willing to be the
servants of such a boss during election will be willing
and perhaps eager to be the servants of other and
better paying bosses if they get into office?
In opposition to the ticket of the Phelanites, dis
credited by the record of the last two years, bearing
the stigma of a nomination pained in violation of all
precedents and principles of American politics and
disgraced in many instances by the trickery of false
registration for the purpose of making ri pretense of
residing in wards other than those where they really
live, the Republican party presents a ticket nominated
in an open convention, made up of men representing
the best elements of citizenship, and pledged to poli
cies calculated to advance the welfare of the munici
pality.
Xo intelligent man can hesitate in choosing between
soch tickets as these. Even the most stalwart of Dem
ocrats refuse to accept the nominees of the Commit
tee of One Hundred as the representatives of their
party. Even the independents who supported Phelan
two years ago refuse to any longer accept his prom
ises after the record made by him and his nominees
in the present board.
San Francisco needs a Board of Supervisors which
will support Mayor Patton in his work for the ad
vancement of the municipality, for honesty, economy
and reform. The people, therefore, irrespective of
party, may be counted on to vote for the whole list
of Republican Supervisors as well as for the Repub
lican Mayor.
HOW TO "GET TOGETHER."
GOVERNOR BUDD'S suggestion that the
Democrats of this city should immediately
"get together" is excellent, but it comes alto
gether too late. Had the Governor offered this idea
early in the summer, and had he then, in conjunction
with other Democrats, insisted upon a fair primary
election and fair representative State and city conven
tions, the Democracy might have been saved from its
alliance with the Maguire Populists and the bossism
of Mayor Phelan. It is too late now, however, to
suggest "getting together." True Democrats can
never "get together" in this campaign and maintain
their self-respect.
Moreover, getting Democrats together at the pres
ent time means substantially the continuation in power
of Boss Phelan and the band of bolters and office
seekers to whom he has given nominations. There
fore Governor Budd's advice, while excellent from a
partisan standpoint, would, if followed, in the end com
pletely destroy the Democratic party of State and city.
The organization never could survive the process of
"getting together" on the Phelan-MaKuire basis.
There is but one safe course for Democrats who stand
for principle to follow in this campaign. They must
knock out the entire brood of job-chasers who have
captured their party or abandon it forever.
In discharging the functions of party boss Phelan
has thrown precedent and precept to the winds. He
has appointed a State delegation and a municipal con
vention, and has given nominations to none but his
personal adherents. His lieutenants have pledged
the nominees for patronage offices to award the
places under them to the "party," which means
Phelan. If the Democratic ticket is elected, not only
will the boss-ship of the Mayor be recognized, but he
will be made so strong politically that he will practic
ally own the city.
How can Democrats "get together" on any such
basis as this? How can they flock to the support of
a gubernatorial candidate who represents single tax
ation and demagogism and a candidate for Mayor
who represents bossism and the spoils of office? It
is all right to talk about the glorious principles of
Democracy, and the allegiance Democrats owe to the
traditions of their party, but "getting together" means
on this occasion aiding in the triumph of a sandlot
demagogue, a political boss and a boodle newspaper.
In this campaign genuine Democrats can do but
one thing and maintain their self-respect, viz., vote
the Republican ticket from top to bottom. In that
way only can they purify their party and rebuke the
bolters, demagogues and office-seekers who have ob
tained control of it. For years these men have pro
claimed their unselfish devotion to Democratic prin
ciples and desire for good government. Democrats
now see that all this means merely giving them the
offices. If it is made to appear that the game these
men are playing results in defeat, this campaign will
end them. So the ultimate regeneration of Democ
racy demands the election of the entire Republican
ticket. State and municipal. That will be a real case
of "getting together," and one the moral of which
will not be lost upon Phelan and his gang of job
chasers.
There is nothing surprising in the report that Peary
has been frozen in. A man does not go to the Arctic
with the expectation of having to contend with sun
stroke. His object is to get frozen in and rescued.
There is about the same danger of a fight between
France and England that there is of some of the
heavy-weight conversational pugilists getting into the
ring.
The only purpose Murderer Keenan can serve will
be in the capacity of a horrible example, and he can
not do his best at this without the experience of being
hanged.
Peopie are freezing to death in Colorado. This is
a great country, and did nci need to take in the Phil
ippines to acquire all sorts of weather.

from throughout the State as to what
action should be taken by members of
the People's party at the coming election
I am constrained to offer the following:
Except as a matter of Independent vot
ing the party lias been for the present
wiped out of existence â
Firstâ By the action of the fuslonista of
the late People's Party Convention at
Sai ramento, aided, encouraged and
brought about by the attendance and par
itlon therein by the then chairman
â¢â ! the Democratic State Central Commit
f a sub-committee of said commu
te â¢â  and a body of persons styling them
selves Silver Republicans;
Secondâ By the decision of the Supreme
Court in favor of the fusionists.
The most influential person in the be
trayal of the People's party in the con
vention was E. M. Wardall, chairman of
the People's Party State Central Commit
tee, who holds the position of secretary
to Congressman Barlow, at a salary of
$10u per month, and who, no doubt, wished
to perpetuate himself in that, to him,
very Important plac< . by brinÃing about
fusion and the renominatlon and re-elec
tion ot Mr. Barlow. John S. Dore, a for
mer leader of the party anil a then
fusion nominee for Supervisor in Fresno
County, took a prominent part in that
behalf. In fact, the fuslonlsts fr..m the
country districts in the convention were
nearly all interested In bringing about fu
sion for the purpose of securing local or
other offices for themselves or friends.
Twenty-six delegates from San Francisco
voted for fusion despite their instructions
to the contrary, and since the convention
the two k-aders of the numberâ Kinne-and
Gillespleâ have been actively engaged in
bringing about indorsements of both
Democrats and Republicans In the city
and county campaign in San Francisco,
conditioned, of course, on the payment of
- into the hands of thiMr com
mittee. It goes without saying that neith
â¢ :â¢ I emocrats nor Republicans have in-
I nor Dominated any member of the
People's party in San Francisco.
As :i State question the People's party
has been traded out of existence for a
few nominations that carry nothing with
them, even In case of success at the polls,
other than the few dollars that would
reach the pockets of the incumbents if
elected. There Is nothing in the office
â of Lieutenant Governor, Controller or
rintendent of Public Instruction (the
: nominations allowed the People's party
: fuslonists) of an executive, administrative
or other character that could possibly
Impress the people of the State with any
Idea I rrn measures contemplated
: by the People's party. The bargain made
. by Alford et a!., to allow Wardall ft al..
one member of the State Board of Equali
zation was promptly rt-.scinded by the
Democrats. The nomination of Mr. Dry
den fur Railroad Commissioner was .1
worthless concession, as the Board of
ad Commissioners have been *â¢â  tied
; by decisions â >/ the courts as to make its
i abolition desirable. Since its establish
ment eighteen years ago the commission
has coat the State for salaries, rents and
incidental expenses over 1300,000, not tak
ing into account fees paid by the State
to special counsel employed by the bi-ard.
â  As a result of this enormous expenditure
i of money nothing has nor ever will be
I accomplished by Mr. I>rycien or any other
Commissioner in the equalization or re-
I ductlon of freights and fares. It is true,
railroad companies have made some vol
i untary reductions, but never by reason
; of the power exercised by the commission.
| This brings t>.Â» mind that the only solu
| tion of the transportation question is
; governmental ownership and operation
of railroads.
The whole legislative ticket of the State.
with one or two exceptions, haa been
turned over to the Democrats.
With neither legislative, executive nor
; judicial nominations given the People's
party by the fusion bargain, how can that
party maintain the semblance of exlst-
I ence. to say nothing of its identity, under
; the arrangement made? The so-called
Silver Republican party, consisting- large
ly <>f Nathan Cole Jr., H. A. McCraney,
Walter Van Dyke and J. Noonan Phillips,
! has fared better in the fusion deal. In
â  f success, Mr. Van Dyke will be
Justice of the Supreme Court for twelve
years. Mr. McCruney clerk of that body,
J. Noonan Phillips Stnte Senator, while
Mr. Cole will occupy the dual position of
a party boas and an admiring- party con
, Btltuency. The election of Mr. McCraney
would mean- as little as that of the Peo
; pie's party fuslonist nominees, but the
election of Phillips would give him the
opportunity to propose laws in two Bes
1 pi ..us of thf> Legislature and of Van Dyke
! to file opinions as Justice for twelve years
I to come.
From the foregoing It will be seen that
the fuslonists of the People's party were
willing to and did sacrifice every office
; that In its nature would give any oppor
: tunity to carry out or perpetuate any prin
! ciple of the People's party. In other
i words, the fuslonists have been careful
to prevent a nomination for any office
! falling to the People's party that by the
1 enunciation, advocacy, maintenance or
j carrying out of a principle therein would
permit a People's party incumbent to ue
heard of or from In the ensuing four
years.
It may be suggested that the nomination
of Castle and Barlow (two of seven nomi
nees for Representatives In Congress) is
at variance with the foregoing; but such
Is not the case. Their re-election would
only mean that they would be again mi
i eluded in what is popularly known as
j Thomas B. Reed's list of reconcentrados,
wittiout power under the ruler of the
â¢â¢ of Representatives to carry or be
I heard on any question except with the
â nt of the Speaker, In whom ihe en
i tire power of the House is at present
vested. On the other hand, If the Legis
lature is carried by the fusionista, the
Democrats will be represented in the
United States Senate for six years by a
Democrat who will have the right under
the written and unwritten rules of the
I Senate to call up measures for coasldera
! tion and to advocate or oppose any and
all measures before that body. f!o it will
be seen that the People's party fusionists
i have practically piven up every office that
| would tend to perpetuate the life of the
j People's party.
The Democratic party is not a national
party in any sense at the present time.
The Democratic platforms of New York,
New Jersey. Pennsylvania and Connecti
cut do not mention the silver question,
yet the fwsionists of the People's party
of California and other States have allied
themselves with the party that in the
States mentioned is as much opposed to
them as the Republican party on that
and nearly every public question. Except
for fusion the People's party would to
day present a solid and unbroken front
and line of battle to the Republican party
in every State of the Union. It was
therefore necessary the People's party
should be fused out of existence, to the
end that the few crumbs of official place
and emolument scattered from the tabl*
of Republicanism by the haste and greed
of allied monopolies should fall to the
Democratic party, and the Republican
party be perpetuated in power by having
opposed to it from a national standpoint
a party whose strength is represented by
a chain with broken and missing links.
In consonance with this end the Su
preme Court in Its decision validating fu
sion held that there could be no inquiry
into the betrayal of the life of a political
party, even where the delegates so be
traying it were under instructions to the
contrary from the source from which
they received their power to act as dele
gates. The decision' was the last step re
toulrad to destroy tbÂ» ladfiD9n,fleat jpolitl
cal existence of the People's party In this
State.
As the one to whom the Examiner gave
credit editorially with carrying Australian
ballot reform In the Assembly, I have
believed, and still believe, that the the
ory and intent of the law was not only
to maintain the existence of but to en
courage the formation of political par
ties, so that all political opinions might
be expressed and protected on a ballot
printed at public expense. That so long
as any number of persons were desirous
of voting a party ticket as such, they
should have the right so to do. where
such party had polled 3 per cent, the per
centage required, of the entire vote at
the last | receding election. It would have
taken only five weeks from and after the
decision of the court for the people to
have decided on their ballots whether or
not the party had the necessary 3 per
cent to entitle it to remain in existence
under the operation of the law itself.
To show the party's complete annihila
tion it is only necessary to suggest that
two years from now it will be impossible
in view of fusion for any certificate to be
filed with the necessary affidavit attached
that the party as such iwlled 3 per cent
of the vote at the preceding election, The
court stated that that point would be de
termined when properly an issue before
it. The rule that perjury consists of
swearing to that which one does not
know to be true, as well as that which
one knows to be untrue, will prevent any
such certificate being filed In behalf of
the People's party.
AVith the party manipulated and traded
and finally adjudged out of existence ex
cept on a fusion basis, as heretofore ex
plained, the question arises as to the duty
of the individual voters of the People's
party. If they vote the fusion ticket
they will be voting with a party which,
when in full national power, did nothing
for a postal telegraph system, nothing in
the line of governmental ownership and
operation of railroads, nothing to reform
the currency, in fact nothing in the line
of People's party principles. Reasoning
by analogy, if the postnfflce system of to
day were in the hands of a private cor
poration it would remain there forever so
far as either the Democratic or Repub
lican party is concerned. A vote for
fusion is a vote for Democracy and the
complete extinction of the principles of
the People's party; a vote against fusion
will constitute a rebuke to the fusionists
who bargained away the life of the party
that sprang into existence In opposition
to the two old parties alike.
The candidacy of Mr. Maguire is in di
rect opposition to the fundamental prin
ciples of the People's party. In a speech
in the House of Representatives, Febru
ary 13, IS9B, he said:
Socialists, Populists and charity-mongers, the
people who would apply little remedies for a
great evil, are all V.arklnK up the wrong tree.
The upas of our civilization is our treatment
of land. It Is that which la converting even
the march of Invention into a blight. There
is but one cure for business depression; there
is no other; that Is the single tax.
What ia the meaning of single tax as
the words are used?
It Is a tax Imposed solely on land val
ues to the exclusion of all other taxes not
only for local and State purposes, but for
national purposes as well, this last being
evidenced by Maguire's motion to strike
out the Income tax feature of the Wilson
bill and Insert in lieu thereof the tax on
land values. Every single-taxer is a
free-trader, and on principle opposed to
any tariff, license or any tax except on
land values. Henry George, of whom Mr.
ICaguire Is a disciple, supported Cleve
land by reason of the latter's opposition
to the tariff. Let us see what the single
tax would mean for this State. The re
port of the State Board of Equalization
for 1894 (the latest I have been able to
obtain) shows that the total assessed
value of real estate in this State for the
year 1594, after deducting value of lm
:nents, to be: Country realty. $331,-
I; city and town lots, $1>.0Ki.597; to
tal value of all realty lees Improvements,
$470.369, 50". From the last named figures
there would probably be exempted from
taxation under the single tax, as that tax
is aimed at the equity of ownership, the
value of mortgages thereon, amounting
to $218,714,708; leaving actual value of
owners to be assessed, $251,555.101.
The valuation of ail property In the
State for assessment ' purposes in the
year 1594 was 11,204,976,952, upon which the
State tax levy was $0,493 on the $100. The
amount collected therefrom, less costs
and delinquents under the rate levied was
$5,511,634. Taking the valuation of that
year on realty alone, after deduction of
the value of improvements and mortgages,
the rate of taxation required to produce
the sum raised in taxes of $5,511,>>34 would
have been almost $2.19 instead of $0,493 on
the $10u valuation. Thus there would
have been imposed more than four times
the burden on land owners for State
taxes on land as a whole proposition
than they paid that year.
But that is not all. The valuation of
property for county purposes, being- the
same as the valuation of property for
State purposes of assessment, any in
crease or diminution of property assessed,
taking the counties of the State as a
whole, affects the county rate and levy
in exactly the same proportion as the
State rate and levy would be affected.
Therefore, taking an average of all the
county rates and levies of taxation for
the same year (1594) we find the average
rate and levy for county purposes was
$1,125 on the $100. Assuming that the
counties would have stood in the same
need of money for public purposes under
thÂ« single tax system as was then the
case, the rate and levy for county pur
poses, being confined solely to land values
of owners, would have been, taking an
average of all the counties, over four
times the rate then levied on all property,
that is $4.W instead of $1,125 on the $100
of the valuation of the land of the
State.
A State rate and levy of $2.19 and a
county rate and levy of $4.99 (dropping
minute fractions), making the rate all
told of $7.1S on the $100 valuation of land
under the single tax, as against the State
rate and levy of $0,493 and the average
rate and levy for county purposes of
$1,125, making a total of $1,618, the State
and average county rate levied in 1594.
Or $7.15, the rate that would have been
required, under single tax. against $1,618,
shows the difference between the present
and that system so far as land owners
are concerned. It may be claimed,
though, that even under the single tax
the mortgage would be treated as an
interest In the land, and assessed to the
holder. Admitting that to be true the
additional burden of taxation would have
to be met by additional interest paid to
the mortgage holder, thus leaving the
mortgagor (land owner) in no better posi
tion than if he had paid the tax In the
first . instance. Still, the weight of the
single tax is not all shown, for the sin
gle taxer would do away with the tariff,
internal revenue, and all license taxes,
national, State and municipal, thereby
placing . additional burdens on land, in
taxes for the purpose of carrying on the
Government.
Under the single tax system the land
would soon be sold to the- State for taxes
and the dream of the single taxer of State
ownership, or "nationalization of land,"
as he terms it, the State rental of land
for taxes would bo realized. Land would
be valueless as security. No owner could
pay the taxes. The money leaner would
withdraw loans as speedily as possible,
or falling in that, would let the land be
sold to the State for taxes. No banker
jvoitfd. foreclose to become the own,QÂ£ pf
property on which the rate of taxation
would represent twice the interest or
Government bonds for which a premium
is paid. But the single taxer says im
provements would not be taxed. \ cry
true- as I have already shown. Unable
to pay taxes on the land the owner, could
uproot his vines and trees and remove
his buildings- or mining or other im
provementsâwhere? The home would be
destroyed; we would become nomads. By
rendering land so worthless by taxation
that any person could secure a Portion of
it, it would not be taken under the bur
dens imposed and would ultimately rail
to furnish even revenue to carry on tne
Government. ' . _ ,
Henry George in "Progress and Pov
erty," page 880, quotes Mrs. Fawcett ap
provingly as follows:
The land tax. whether great or small In
amount, partakes of the ->iture of a rent : a: i
by the owner of land to the state. In a great
part of India the land ie owned by the oov
ernment and therefore the land tax is rent paid
direct to the state. The economic perfection
of this system of tenure may be readily per
ceived.
If the single tax works so beautifully In
India as a cureall for poverty, why was It
that in 1897 the Legislature of this State
passed resolutions asking the National
Government to furnish shipping to carry
food donated in the United States to the
wretched and starving inhabitants of that
country ?
Since the American Revolution, any
variation at any time in existing methods
of taxation has been a political question;
yet the fusionists claim the single tax is
not an issue. It is an issue. When tne
Democratic State Convention indorsed the
acts of Mr. Maguire it indorsed his acts
on the single tax question as well as his
opposition to the funding bill and his op
position to Hawaiian annexation. In fact,
the Democratic party is more nearly com
mitted by the acts of its representatives
to the single tax than to tHe anti funding,
as Senator White failed to vote against
the refunding bill. Mr. Maguire has loaded
the Congressional Record with speechea
on the subject of the single, tax for the
purpose of making converts, ana in the
end electing men to office who will cam
out his view?. On the evening of Septem
ber 14 In his speech in San Francisco, Mr.
Maguire claimed it was not an issue ana
then forthwith delivered what constituted
a column of close print in a morning
newspaper on that question. Among otxier
things, he claimed that the single tax
would break up the monopoly of Miller &
Lux of 14,000,000 acres of land in the x-a
ciflc States and Territories. He forgot to
explain that the constitution of this State
requires that land, improved and unim
proved, of the like quality, shall be as
sessed at the same value, thus going as
far as law can equitably go against hold
ing lots vacant or lands unused for spec
ulative purposes. He neglected to say
that a tax on land values that would
break up the monopoly of a greater acre
age would as effectually break the monop
oly of an acreage devoted to a small
Prior to ISS2 the Examiner, referring to
"Progress and Poverty," Henry Georges
work on single tax. said: â¢â¢Progress and
Poverty" must in time produce deep ef
fects, and give to the most important dis
cussion a new turn. It cannot long be
ignored by those who regard its doctrines
as dangerous." '~' ,
At page 326 of the above mentioned
work George says:
But when the times are ripe for them, idea*
grow, tven though insignificant in their first
appt-arance. One day, the thini estate cov
ered their heads wh.-n the King put on his
hat. A little while thereafter, and tbe head of
a son of St. L- ills rolled from r -he c
The antl-siavery movement in the United Stat^g
commenced with the talk of compensating own
ers, but when the four millions of slav
emanci;-.i;--i, the ' "' compensation,
nor did they clamor for any. And by the time
the people of such a country as England or the
United States are sufficiently aroused to the in
justice and dtsadvai.iages of individual owner
ship of land to induce them to atter:
nationalization, they will be sufficiently
aroused to nationalize It in a much more di
rect and easy -way than by purchase, i. c., by
taxation. They will "lot trouble themselves
about compensating the proprietors of land.
Following the above predictions we
have the single tax before us. If Mr. Ma
guire is elected the single tax will be In
dorsed; and if as zealous in that behalf
here as he was in trying to secure its
adoption in Delaware he will, with the
power in his hands, keep the people in
strife on that question to the exclusion
of all genuine measures of reform for
four years to come. But the single tax
can be removed from politics and from
public consideration by the defeat of Mr.
Maguire on the Bth day of November
next.
Two years ago I introduced an income
tax bill in the Legislature. Our consti
tition has provided for such a law since
IST?. I believe in taxing incomes whether
derived from land or from stocks, bonda
or property of any description. I do not
believe in taking a mouthful of food from
any hungry human being by taxation,
nor do I believe in taxing the homes from
men who in most c;ist_-s have labored the
better part of a lifetime to earn or main
tain them. Surplus wealth should be
taxed; and any person who has a net in
come over and above operating expenses
and cost of living for himself and fam
ily has surplus wealth which should be
taxed. The Republican majority in the
Assembly did not dare kill my bill, but
as a matter of delay referred it to a
committee of three to consider and re
port upon to the Legislature which meets
next January. It should then be reintro
duced and become a law. But the elec
tion ot" Maguire would give such an Im
petus to the single tax. as I have before
suggested, that the incume tax and other
measures of reform would be lost sight
of for four years to come in the strife
on that question. While on the subject
I cannot refrain from stating that many
otherwi.se well informed persons think
a State income tax unconstitutional by
reason of the decision of the United
States Supreme Court on the income tax
feature or the Wilson bill. Instead of so
holding the court held the income tax to
be a direct tax, and that, as euch, the
power to levy it was vested so!'
each of the States and not in the Federal
Government.
The way to reach and carry the meas
ures of reform heretofore proposed by the
People's party and to restore the life of
the party is to defeat Mr. Maguire and
the single tax. If the defeat of the single
tax idea in its incipifney is not a question
of politics, It is a question of patriotism.
And to the end of removing the single
tax from public consideration I shall, as
a member of the People's party, vote for
Mr. Gage, who. as a private citizen and
lawyer, recovered millions of acres of the
public domain from the railroads; who,
as a lawyer, never foreclosed a mortgage
on a home and who, as a candidate for
Governor, declares himself against the
single tax and against taxing land own
ersnlp and homes out of existence. With
his election, barter of principle for office,
being all things to all men, the candidacy
on three platforms, the destruction of a
political party for personal ends will be
rebuked. And the men, women and chil
dren of California will rest in compara
tive peace, knowing that the instru
mentality of destroying their homes by
an insidious and unjust method of taxa
tion has been defeated.

campaign and all of the expenses of the i
workers and heelers who were aiding:
him came within the 5250 which he !
swore red all cf the moneys spent
by or for him?
During â¢ hat campaign Phelan's ban- j
ners flaunted across the streets as they i
do to-day, his cards were distributed all
over the" city as they are to-day, and
his posters and handbills were scat
tered broadcast as they are to-day.
Does he presume to say that these were
not paid for "by or for him?"
During that campaign Phelan rode
from meeting to meeting in hacks as he
does to-day and his workers rode In
hacks as they do to-day. Does he prÂ»

Will Fhelan swear that during that

Did he not then, as he does now, go

never meet his friends and their friends

he does this is not to be condemned,
but that he does it and then makes oath
that he spends but $250 luring an entire
campaign is something that the people
do not expect of a man who is so pure
and bo holy that he sets himself above
the rest of mankind.
The election law, which haÂ« for its
object purity of elections, is strict in its
provisions against the expenditure of
moneys during a campaign and the
public Is disposed to overlook excessive
expenditures on the part of candidates,
but for the man who has set himself up
as the one pure and good man of the
city to make oath to expenses which
iare ridiculous on their face is to be
condemned and Phelan cannot avoid
th<* issue. He has prescribed purity in
politics for all men and must not him
self transgress.

of Mr. Phelan and made the estimate
from the known advertising rat- of
the papers. If there has been an error
it i: on the conservative side and the
true amounts. â â¢â¢ more apt to be higher
than lower than those given herewith.
The Call Is not disposed to censure
Mr. Phelan for spending his money
during a. campaign, but it is opposed to
hypocrisy and hr-nce takes issue with

RESCrK OF Tin: DROWNING.
In all the methods which Involve the
grasping: of the helpless pen by the res

the swimmer must rely upon three limbs
to make progress. Hence the left
arm is generally used to support the
drowning person, thus leaving the strong
er right arm to assist the legs in their
battle with the waves.
Sometimes the rescuer swims with the
ordinary breast stroke, grasping the
form of the other just below the armpits
firmly with the left arm. and towing the
body along beside him, parallel with his
own. Occasionally, if the drowning per
son is light and the water not very
rough, he may be supported merely by
the rescuer's hand being placed under
neath the I eat, high enough to keep his
head out of the water. This could not
be done; however, if he struggled at all.
There is another method, differing from j
any of those yet mentioned, in that it
allow* the rescuer the full liberty of both
arms as well as both legs, and, if prop
erly managed, hinders the progress :
scarcely at all. It cannot be used unless
the person who is in danger of drowning
has consciousness and self-command
enough to obey orders, but there are such
cases as this; for example, when one who
Is himself a swimmer happens to be
seized with cramp and rendered helpless
temporarily, or becomes exhausted when
at a considerable distance from shore '
The method is for the exhausted person
to face the rescuer and throw his arms
about the latter's neck, allowing the body
to float forward, as it will, feet first un
til It is extended almost horizontally un
der that of the swimmer. If the help

ward with his arms and Just maintains
a sufficiently firm hold to keep his face
out of water, the swimmer will be abie
to proceed with perfect comfort by means
of the breast stroke. This has been tried
often, and proved, to be an excellent way J

I NEGRESS RAISED THE BLOCKADE.
A- exactly 7 6 o'cl 'ck on a recent morn
ing a brick tru'-k loaded with about 1500
bricks started west across Second ave
nue at Thirty-second street. The cart
was rickety and as it struck the car track
on which the south-bound trolley cars
were running the right hind wheel broke.
The wagon settled down easily and calm
ly right in the middle of the track.
Of course, a trolley car came along just
! then with a lot gers eager to get
â to their plac<-s of business downtown.
| The conductor and mutorman grinned a
moment and then began to swear gent
ly. Very soon two ur three more cars
came along and had to stop also. By this
I time the railroad employes and the pas
' sengers saw that the blockade was seri
ous, and some one went for a ja'-k to raise
! the cart. But that did no good, for the
load of bricks was too heavy to handle.
Meanwhile cars were coming down, and
the string of cars was piling up rapidly.
; The conductors and motonnen stood
| around and swore at the luckless driver.
who was petting desperate. More cars
were coming and tl :<era were
gt-tting more out of sorts.
A large, white-haired negro woman with
a big bask< t of washing in her arms
lumped ( ut of the third blockaded car and
walked down to the brick cart. She stood
for a moment and watched the group of
railroad men around the cart.
"Well, Hh'rn blessed," she said in a diÂ»- |
guwted tune, loud enough for everybody
within 100 feet to hear. "Hcah, you mo
tahmen an' conduotahs. stand aroun' and i
look on. You'se afraid o' sollin' you 1
nan's, ain't you? If ah had you aworkin'
for me, ah'd bounce you every cine. Peel
pretty nice in you' brass buttons, don't
you, you lazy, shift'K-ss men! Ah nay,
w'y don't you unload dem bricks? Dump
'em out!"
"Naw, you won't dump 'em out." said
the driver. "You'll break the bricks,"
"Break nothln'," said the negro woman.
"Jess sfe hf-ah."
She took fifteen bricks from the broken
down cart up in her arms; then she pil< d
them in the trutt.-r.
"Come on," she paid to the men, "plt^h
in an' help me. You'd let a woman do it
all, wou'den' you?"
"That's right, mammy," shouted a man,
"we'll help you. Come on. everybody."
Passengers, men ami women pilt-a out
of the waiting cars, the motormen and
conductors joined them, and everybody
took a pile of ter. or fifteen bricks to the
gutter. In less than fifteen minutes the
cart was empty, and it was an easy Job
to haul it away from the car track. Then
the crowd cheered for the old woman aa
she picked up her basket and walked tri
umphantly to her car
â¢'Take up a collection." shouted some
one. "She's a brick herself." And the
crowd responded in fine shape. In a mo
ment dimes, nickels and quarters were
rattling into the woman's basket, and she
was thanking each giver with a "Bless
you, child!"â New York Sun.
fjINCVLAK OLD LONDON ri.UB.
The c'.ty of London has probably given
birth to a greater number <>f clubs than
any other municipality in Christendom,
and they.- have embraced every .shade of
political opinion and social municipal in
fluence. <>ne of the most eccentric of
them all waa the Friendly Club, founded
in 169.". and afterward known as the Cen
tenary Club. Thanks to J. W. Sherwell, the
Clerk to the Saddlers' Company, the cor
poration has been put into possession of
Beveral minute books of this once famous
club, which Sergeant Robinson, one of
the last members of the club, and for
some time Its honorary secretary. The
club possessed "a father" and " a moth
er." and, more important than theÃe, per
haps, a hljfh Bteward, waoe tenure of office
was of .short duration, but whose powers
were wide, and whose discretion was
large. The toastfl of "The Father" and
"The Mother" were standing- dishes, as
also was one curiously styled "One More."
A member, in taking wine with another,
always s;iid, "My service to you," and
after the removal of the cloth the "Re
corder" said: "Has any member of the
club to report honors or preferments that
he has experienced sine*- the laxt meet
ing, such a*s baronetcies, knighthoods,
sons or daughters married, or children
or grandchildren born in lawful wedlock?"
The custom of the club was for every
member who achieved honorable distinc
tion in public or private life to pay a fine
to the club for rh<- benefits of the mem
ber? as a body, and the records teÂ«;m with
instances of the alacrity with which mem
bers availed themselves of tills opportun
ity of keeping the differs of the club well
filled. The members were men of private
sportive character, not an evening pass
ing without bets being freely made upon
every conceivable subject, except horse
racing. The fact that many of the wagers
were of a foolish kind iÂ« patent, but it
must not be forgotten that the Centenary
Club was nothing if not eccentric. -Lon

TWO NOI.SV NATIONS.
It seemÃ strange thnt two nations so
i antlpo<i;il )n the matter of Ideals an the
United States and China should share the
: distinction of being groat noise-loving
people. Yet It is a fart that the two
; countries consume nearly a.. th<> flre
i crackers maufactured each year by the
wives and children of the Chinese cracker
merchants. Kngland annually buys a
i small quantity of the explosives. Other
countries take only Infinitesimal amounts.
Here in America the firecracker is the
.small boy'fl legitimate medium for ex
pressing his patriotic approval of a great
1 national event. His enthusiasm expends
Itself In a day, consequently the nofse of
countless numbers of exploding crackers
laHts but a short time.
Not ho in the Orient. There the use of
firecrackers is not limited by age or posi
tion. Their use Is universal and has been
as far back as history records. It Is like
ly that in the beginning they were em
ployed to frighten away evil spirits. But
as the country partially emerged from Its
dense Ignorance, and shook off a nart of
its load of superstitions, the cracker be
came an exprtH.sion of good will and of
ceremonious compliment. Now the ex
ploding of firecrackers Is as much of an
Incident at wedding festivities in China
as the throwing of rice or old shoes la
here. Not only Is the marriage feast en
livened by the cracker, but blrth.B and
funerals, and festivals, religious, civil and
military ceremonies bring the cracker Into
play. Al6O they are used at New Year's

LUCKY PARSONS.
"The law is very blank on the question
which occasionally comes up as to the le
gal right of a clergyman to marry him
self," observed a lawyer. "Of course there
are not many clergymen who have ever
contended that Uiey had the legal as well
as the ecclesiastical right to perform
marriages when they were personally par
ties to it. and there never will be, from
the peculiar circumstances of the case.
As far as the laws of this District are
concerned, however, a clergyman is just
as competent to marry himself as he is to
marry others, f. r the reason that the
laws do not say anything t" the contrary,
and the clergyman's corticate that tho
marriage has been performed is all that
la needed to make it lawful.
"I am not up in ecclesiastical law to any
great extent, and I am not able to explain
the church ordinances, but as far as I can
learn a clergyman of any of the leading
denominations has all the church right to
marry himself that he has to marry oth
ers. "The Court of Queen's ilench in Dub
lin, on November 16, 1866, had a case of
tht^ kind under consideration, the only
point in issue being whether a clergyman
marry himself. The case was very
fully argued, and Is reported in the re
ports of that court and quoted by many
English law writers. The decision was in
the affirmative, and that Is the Is
England to-day. Some of th>- State laws
may have thought It i to express
an opinion in thÂ»- matter, but I hay never
seen any. The case that l refer to is cited
In thÂ«* books is that of Beamish vs.
Beamish. It was a prooeeding for a dl
\n which the question was raised
that there had nev.-r been a marriage." â

ACH EMPLOYED
TO PROSECUTE
THE FORGERS
Chief Lees Offers No
Objection.
WERE AT SWORDS' POINTS
STARTLING MOVE IN THE BECK-
ER AND CREEGAN CASE.
The "New Witness" Turns Out to Be
the Police Officer Who
Arrested the
Men.
The second trial of Becker and Cree
gan, the Nevada Bank forgers, will be
commenced next Monday before Judge
Wallace. To the surprise of the de
fendants and in fact everybody connect
ed with the case, except Chief Leos,
Henry Ach, the attorney, has been em
ployed as special counsel to prosecute
the men.
Ach was special prosecutor in the
Hoffman murder mystery', and took
particular delight in "roasting" the
head of the Police Department. Just
why he should be selected tcr plead the
case of the people against th.' forgers
is a fruitful source for discussion among
those directly interested. Ach and
Lees are not on Bpeaklng terms, but it
is possible that they will paich up their
differences when the second trial of the
forgers will have commenced. The only
explanation offered for the employ
ment of Ach is that D. J. Murphy, who
prosecuted the forgers at their former
trial, is "too busy" to attend to the
case.
It is known that the Bankers" Asso
ciation is Ptill determined to land
Becker in the penitentiary. They re
gard him as being too dangerous a man
to be allowed to roam about the coun
try passing worthless paper and prey-
Ing on bunkers. Fur tints reason they
intend to make a Btrong effort to have
him confined in the State prison for a
long term.
There are many who believe that
Oreegan, who, with Becker, was sen
tenced to life imprisonment for thr-
Nevada Hank forgery, has consented to
turn State's evidence against him on
consideration that he be given his free
dom. After the men were granted a
new trial, it is Bald, Creegan, who is
still confined in the County Jail, was
visited l>y a member <>f the Bankers'
Association, who induced him to take
the stand against Becker.
Creegan, however, vehemently denies
that ho intends t.i "peach" i>n his com
panions. He says he will stand "pat,"
and confidently expects that he and
Becker will be promptly acquitted. At
their former trial Deane, who se
the moruy on the forged check, turned
State's evidence against them. Mainly
through his testimony a verdict of
guilty was rendered. The Supreme
Court, however, held that the evid
of an accomplice was not sufficient to
convict, and granted the men a new
trial.
With the evidence of Creegan and
Deane it Is claimed that Becker would
be insured a long term in the peniten
tiary.
The new witness whose testimony it
was said would complete the chain of
evidence against the "King of Forgers"
arrived in this city yesterday from the
East. He Is the police officer who ar
rested Becker and Creegan after their
tlight from this city. Just what evi
dence he will give the prosecution re
fuses to state, but intimate that he
will cause consternation in the camp
of the defense when he takes the stand
against the accused men. McCloakey,
who was tried and acquitted of partici
pation in the crime, is also here, having
arrived Thursday night.
Attorney inmne, counsel for the de
fense, is prepared for a hard struggle
and confidently expects that his clients
will be acquitted.

SOLDIERS' VOTESâ lgnorance, Sausa
lito, Cal. This correspondent asks: "Can
the soldiers stationed at Fort Baker, in
Marin County, vote for Governor at the
election in November?
The Legislature of the State of Cali
fornia, by an act of March 2, 1897, de
clared thut:
The State of California cedes to the United
States if America exclusive jurisdiction over
all lands now held, ocupied or reserved by the
Government of the United States for military
purposes or defense, or which may hereafter
be ceded or conveyed to said United States for
such purposes, provided that a sufficient de
scription by metes and bounds and a map or
plat be filed In the proper office In the county
in which the same are situated.
There is a reservation as to the right
of the State to execute civil process on
such reservations.
MeCrary on Elections, a standard au
thority, says:
Soldiers of the United States army cannot ac
quire a residence by being long quartered in
a particular place, and though upon being dis
charged from thÂ» service they remain on the
place where they have previously been Quar
tered. If a year's residence in that place is
required as a qualification fur voting;, they
must remain there one year from the date of
such discharge before acquiring the right to
vote.
We have already seen that a residence with
in a place over which the United States has
exclusive Jurisdiction is not a residence with
in the State, county or township fur voting
purposes.
The voting qualification In California is
In the State one year before
â¢â , in the county ninety days and
precinct thirty days. Fort Baker is a
military reservation.

GAME PROTECTION
IS A
GREAT NECESSITY
A change in the -weather should vastly
Improve marsh and upland shooting. The
â wild ducks anxiously looked for by an
army of local gunners have not yet put
in an appearance in numbers sufficiently
large to guarantee what could be
good sport. Oc<.asior.ally bags of from
ten to twenty birds have been made dur
ing the past week by sportsmen who
have shot on the grain tit-Ids adjacent to
Sherman Island at evening and at early
morning, but as a rule duck-shooting has
been very poor since the opening of the
season. As already stated, the recent
change in the weather may bring about
gvod results.
A letter to The Call from a sports
man resident of Carson, Nevada,
â¢â feat mark< : hunters to the i
fifty ".a-u camped" on the borders of
Pyramid Lake and will open slaughter on
,-oon as the weather
shall have become sufficiently cool to
guarantee a safe shipment or game to
the markets.
As quail are very scarce this year, the
of several counties are either
closing the season for shooting altogether
or limiting it to a f< w months.
In last Saturday's Call a statement was
made to the effect that night shooting
â¢was indulged in to a large extent on the
night prior to the opening of thy season
in the vicinity of the Alameda Club pre
serve. However, In justice to the mem
bers of the Alameda Club, it must be said
thai they took no part in the fusillade on
the feathered tribe. In fact the club has
a rule which makes night shooting: by any
member punishable, and this Is a rule
â which all clubs should strictly adhere to,
as moonlight shooting Is more destruc
tive to Â£he sport than anything thai can
be imagined, not excepting market shoot
ing in daylight; There are, however, some
market hunters who are located in the
vicinity of McG ill's station, who shoot at
all times, and last year they greatly ham
pered the sport of the true sportsman. If
the Supervisors of Sonoma ordain that
game must not be shipped out of the
county a quick stop will be put to Mr.
Market Hunter ana his indolent ways of
living.
The following letter on shooting and the
necessity of game protection should in
terest all lovers of field sports:
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 20. IS3S.
Editor of The Call: Game In California Is de
creasing alarmingly. The decrease is beyond
the belief of the people who have not made
the subject a study. 1 feel that it is safe to
Bay that in the buy counties and the country
that Is contiguous to railroads, where the lares
from this city are cheap, the decrease has
been aim 75 per cent within the last live
years. Unless there is nwre effective protec
tion there â¢will be an almost absolute exterm
ination of game within a short time.
This question of game preservation Is bo
diversified that to advance a theory in the
face of the many interests at stake is almost
certain to cause adverse criticism,
The many ways and efforts that have been
made to legislate In this direction, and the re
sults achieved, show clearly how difficult It la
to Create a law to suit all.
It is ......... at least 23, 000
.votaries of the gun in this State whose ideas
on this subject are as varied as the weapon
they use, and to conciliate these various ideas,
fo as to do the most tjood, seems to be the
duty of every true sportsman.
The most effective way to preserve game Is
to curtail its destruction. Different kinds re
quire different treatment.
The upland game of California consists of
valley quail, mountain tjuall and grouse. The :
trapper is their great enemy. Stop his rascally
work and for the rest the quail will take care i
or" themselves.
For the northern counties thÂ» open season
should be for the months of October, Novem
ber, December and January, for the southern
counties a month â¬-arlier would be permissible,
but the close season should commence all over
the State on the Ist of February, or at least on
the 15th. A clearly defined law should exist
that no Fame Fhould be introduced from the
southern counties into the northern count at
any time that it would be unlawful to kill the
same in said counties.
For water fowl and snipe I should be. In favor
of opening the season on the Ist day of Octo
ber and closlr.E on the last of February of
each year.
The use of sink boxes, decoys, baiting ponds,
netting- and other artificial devices should bÂ«
prohibited, aa these are simply a system of
trapping by which some persons can destroy a
greater number of birds than is necessary for
any reasonable being.
Game, being the property of the State, should
lie utilized for the benefit of any citizen who
wishes to engage in the health-giving exer
cise of its pursuit, without distinction of class
or condition, and no person should be allowed
to acquire property in th* same by any subter
fuge such as leasing the shooting privileges of
the marshes or any other lands, purely and
eimpiy that wealthy individuals could have ex
clusive control of the came on the most de
sirable shooting grounds. It Is this selfish de
sire of a few that haÂ» prevented the enact
ment of a pood protective gamÂ« law in the
past, and will do bo in the future until a more
generous sentiment prevails among all lovers
of field sport.
In the destruction of quail, the country peo
ple are the ones that destroy bevies and bevies
by trapping-. In these traps they catch entire
tevles. wherÂ°as the city sportsman go*Â« out
and frives the birds an equal chance with his
pun. This season especially is a hard one for
quail, (â wins,' to the dry season. The birds
have not raired to any extent, and If
Fomsthing- is not done in the near future In
reeard to shortening the quail season th!-= year
quail will not appear next season in their old
time form.
The destruction of ducks Is mostly done by
thÂ» men of th<> hip preserve!" and market' hunt
ers. They really destroy more birds than any
other sportsmen.
However, thÂ» matter may be taken Into con
sideration In this way: The present laws are
ampry sufficient to protect â m<> of this State.
If they are properly enforced, but there can Â»>9
no pn per enforcement of them as lone as the
country people feel as they do now In the mut
ter. Tours truly, W. G. F.
Among the rail hunters -who went out
from this city last Saturday and Sunday,
the first days of the open season in San
ilateo County, one of the most successful
parties was that entertained by the genial
Frank E. Benjamin .-:: his snooting shanty
In Redwood City. Some 200 rail fell to the
guns of the party. As a rule, bags were
email, and every one reported rail as very
scarce on the south bay marshes this
year. The well-known taxidermist and
naturalist, Charles LJttlejohn of Redwood
City, who has made collections for the
Smithsonian Institution at Washington,
gives as his opinion ihat several extreme
high tides last May which completely
flooded the marshes washed out the nests
and destroyed most of the eggs and young
birds. Those who enjoyed the delightful
hospitality of their generous host, Ben
jamin, were: Jim O'Brien, "Bob Evans"
femith. Jack Ford. J. F. Lebaney, Arthur
H. Crane, K. 1.. Hathorn and Nick Stur
lza. O'Brien was high gun, having some
fifty-one rail and two teal to his credit.
One of the strangest as well as the wis
est provisions of nature Is that which pro
tects a doe deer, as well as some other
female animals, from enemies of the car
nivorous species during the period when
the offspring is very young. Between the
toes of all the feet will be found a hoie,
which extends into the foot about an inch,
terminating in a sack, in which is secreted
a musk or scent of a very strong odor.
Ordinarily, when the deer is walking, the
air is forced in and out of this opening, and
leaves enough scent in each track to en
able a dog or wolf to follow it for several
hours after it has been made; but me
foot of the doe is changed for several
months after the fawn la born. ThÂ»
elandsâ glands they are â up, and
there Is not a bit of odor in the track,
and no dogâ not even the best deerhound â
is able to follow the trail. Many good
hounds have lost their reputations by fail
ing to follow the trail of a female bear
â¢with cubs, and perhaps a deer also. .rind
now that the. subject is at hand, one
might well wonder If other things are pro
tected in like manner.
â o
ACTIVE LIFE ON
THE TENNIS COURTS
Although there are no tournaments on at
the various clubs about the bay, tennis
has been very popular -with the players
and the enthusiasts who watch the games
for pastime. At the California Club there
â¢were a number of special matches during
the week between the Whitneys. George
Bradshaw, the enlisted volunteers. Dr.
Boot, Harry Weihe and Walter Magee
who has once again returned to the rack
et pastime.
Bradshaw and Root played six hard sets
with an equal division of honors. Rob
ert N. Whitney and Harry Wei he played
a few close sets in which the former
won out easily. Robert N. Whitney and
Harry TV*) he played George Whitney and
Walter Magee in a three-set match, in
which the former proved the winner of
the odd.
The ladies' continuous tournament Is
progressing and some very interesting
matches are played . dally. Miss Alice
Hoffman, Miss Bowman, Miss Mason and
Miss Hunter were out on the courts dur
ing the week and some very hotly
matched games resulted.
THE FIELD OF SPORT
BASEBALL MEN
WHO
SPEAK UNTRUTHS.
There was published recently an extract
. Herald, purporting to 1"'
an Interview with Manager Ilanlon of the
: iore Club. In this he accuses me
of writing h'.^ an insulting letter, during
the time allotted to the signing of players.
Mr. Hanlon and his Baltimore organs
have said many things that are untrue
since they discovered it impossible to
â  me into signing a contract for the
n Just passed, all of which I have
looked upon us either spite or nonsense.
When Mr. Hanlon, however, accuses me
of writing him an insulting letter he tells
an untruth that I deem it expedient to cor
rect. The only letters he ever received
from me wore sent in the month of Febru
ary last. 1 was then doing business with
him in a purely baseball way, and in the
aatui : things an exchange of
sary. Mr. Hanlon opened
: -â  by sending me a batch of
. ng for $210".'. about Febru
ary 9. As I had already estimated ray
worth at $3000, this comparltlvelv small
â  considered. Mr. Hanlon,
earing from me within a month from
the time his rirst letter arrived, sent an
same contracts Inclosed,
with a note acquainting me with the
fact that he had already sent me con
tracts and they must have gone astray. I
then sent him the following letter, which
he â â lalms was insulting:
Mr. Edward Hanlon, Manager Balti
more Ball Club, Baltimore, Md.â Dear
Sir: Your letter of the 15th lnst. contain
ing Inclosed contracts and duplicates for
and fixing my compensa
at $2100, has been duly received. In
reply I herewith return your contracts,
in duplicate, without my signature. I
aiso received your letter, with contracts,
mailed about the first of January, but as
your offer fell $900 and expenses from San
Francisco to Baltimore and return, below
the estimate which I place upon my ser
vici b, I deemed it inexpedient to open up
negotatlons on the subject. Your second
. however, reminds me thar you are
entitled to some sort tare . as a mat
ter of courtesy. Respectfully,
JOE CORBETT.
The foregoing letter is a copy of the
one I sent >Mr. Hanlon, and It is thÂ« only
letter he ever received from me. If it Is
insulting in any r< spect I am at a loss to
see where, and trust he will be more
pointed and state through the Baltimore
aces. Mr. Hanlon further
a in his interview that he sent m^ a
very curt reply; that the Baltimore team
::)>â¢ a telegram asking me to join
and that he never gave me a
thought.
â  rirst two s1 are correct; the
third 1 know nothing of and care very
little. In regard to the "curt reply," I
wish â¢ hat baseball managers in
doing business with young players intimi
ssurlng the "oor unfortu
by letter, i-f course, that they
never could pitch or play. aB the case may
be, and in nine cases out of ten secure
their services for a song. Mr. Hanlon
tried this ancient experiment on me. His
"curt reply" to me embraced the fact
that "I wasn't so good" and that "there
others just as Rood, if not bettor,"
and that "I could go chase myself around
;i few city Mocks." and that I ought to
consider myself lucky to get a salary at
all. This ended all negotiations so far as
I was concerned, and no words of love
were exchanged by cither of us until the
mores went to Boston and were de
feated three straight games. Hughes had
an off day and w;ts batted all over the
lot; the other pitchers received the same
treatment, and it looked blue for Mr.
Hanlon.
It was then I received the telegram
from the Baltimore players, which reads
as follows:
"Hanlon will give you $40-1 month, com
mencing May 15. We, the boys, want
help us win that four thousand.
Come and make two thousand. Answer
my expense. Leave to-morrow night.
"CLARK."
I answered Mr. <'lark. who is one of
rs, that I had m?t Hanlon half
and could do no more. I have
heard from him since, or his players, and
they have never heard from me. Next
Mr. Hanlon may or may not Bend
contract. If he docs it will not
even receive a reply, as I have long since
given up baseball, and would advise him
to waste no time figuring on me. I would
also advise him to discontinue accusing
me of things that ar^ not true. Of course
he cannot be blamed for thinking of that
tnt that might have been his. but
he should not go so far as to say that I
him insulting messages, for I am
not in the habit or doing such freakish
things. if he is now seeking an oppor
tunity to cover up his inferior judgment
he should know that a man is not going
to stand idly by and listen to all these
rts without a murmur. And the next
time 1 read where Mr. Hanlon says he
d me well I shall mention some un
derhand things he did to meâ things that
will reflect no credit on him I am sure. â

THE SAN FEANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBEH 22, 1898.
SNAP SHOTS
FROM
THE GRIDIRON.
The fourth match of the year and the 1
second between the Olympics and Stan
ford will be fought out this aftsrnoon
at the Recreation grounds, Right h and
Harrison streets. if the club athletes
sink before the onslaughts of the college
men It will be their fourth unbroken de
feat, and there is every possibility of it
happening, although the score will be
smaller than any of the preceding games.
At Palo Alto there is just a tinge of
sable to the football atmosphere, for
things are not what they should bo. The
eleven has made no great progress dur
ing the weekâ ln fact, it has gone back
slightly, as the match game on Thurs
day afternoon with the soldiers will at
test. The unexpected happened in this
game and it was a surprise, which for
genuineness and wonder Is without equal
in the football affairs of the s<
[owa'a regiment certainly played good
ball, but it was not the kind that lowers
as a general rule the proud banners of
a most successful eleven. Palo Alto's
playing was of the ragged order, lacking
consistency, cohesion and harmony. The

slump is due In some respects to the re
grettable accidents that have been the
portion of the cardinal eleven during the
past two weeks, ever sine- their last en
gagement with the Olympics in San Fran
cisco. Three of the best men on the
team are shelved on account of injuriesâ
Burmeister, Wilson and Dole -the result
of which is a weakening of the line and
gross crippling to the back field. With
Dole and Burmeister on the side lines the
quartet of backs is reduced to a duo,
having Fisher and Murphy to bear the
brunt of the labors. Fisher, who cap
tains the team and plays right half. Is
the one man on the Stanford team who
is playing what is usually called remark
able ball. His efforts are untiring and
his energy in working up the team to its
pro], or consistency will show good results
before many weeks have passed, though
for the present the team is not playing
the kind of ball it should.
The most noticeable weakness of the
Palo Alto contingency lies in the center
of the line. Accustomed for many years
to the possession of a center trio which
In weight, Btrength and experience was
Incomparably better than any opposition
ever offered it, the team seems lost in
the deep sea with the present center men
who are not extraordinarily weak, but
only so by comparison with what has
gone before. Most of the gains were
made through the center In the fateful
game with the team which wore the col
ors of the lowa regiment. -It is still
early in the season, and this renter will
In all probability develop into a fairly
strong trio before the season is o.c-r. At
any rate it will not be very far behind
that which will fight for the blue and
gold on Thanksgiving day.
Across the bay on the Berkeley campus
another victory has been added to the
glowing list of the Varsity. A score of 33
points against the Kansas Regiment's
eleven is a good .showing and has caused
considerable jubilation among the stu
dents I'ochran has certainly demo good
work with his football aspirants and be Is
continuing the hard daily practice to
which they are subjected. Stanford Is not
alone in accidents to players. Hopper,
who injured hiÃ knee a few weeks ago,
is suffering severely and will probably
not play for many days to come. \\ hat

pluving a good strong game in his posi
tion handling the t^-am In splendid style
and adding much strength to the defen
sive play on the line. His loss will be
great to the blue and gold cloven. To nil
his place It may be necessary to take
Thane from halfback and play
him as quarter. He has experience and
possesses just the qualities tor the posi
tion. The other men, Kerfoot and Woolf,
ar<Â» practically novices, though Keerfoot
has been playing for two years. Should
Thane go in at quarter that will leave
the right half for Smith and McNab and
ap there is some thought of playing Mc-
Nab tackle, Smith will practically be
alone for this position. Kaarsberg has
been playing at his place In the far back
field, bis kicking Improving slowly and
hIP running in about the same degree.
The Olympics are at their quiet signal
practice ana feel a mite better in spirit.
The eleven, which the club men put on
the field last Saturday, was the strongest
it has mustered up to date. Hobbs was
there and it made a difference. There is
just a chance that he will play to-day. If
lie does he will be in better condition and
the same, gaps which he tore up in the
California line will be reproduced with
a cardinal coloring this afternoon. Other
wise the Olympic lineup will be the same
with the possible exception of a change
at right end, where Mlddlemas may be
found instead of McNutt, who has not
proved much of an addition to the Olym
pic eleven.
It is hardly probable that the same un
pleasant features which marred the game
a week ago will be, seen on the iield this
afternoon. Men who saw Butte play in
their roughest games declare that the
match last Saturday was as replete with
slogging, holding, and general foul play
as was ever witnessed on the icy fields
of Montana, where general mJxups are
common. The Olympics shift the onus
upi â¡ the C'aliforntans and the Califor
nlane on the club men. Such exhibitions
of football, it was thought, belonged to
the days gone by. Smashed heads and
Rouged eyes are not becoming at this day,
even though worn by football men.
On account of a lack of space the con
sideration of the freshmen elevens of both
colleges will be postponed for a week,
when the young "uns" will cross swords
in their jinnual duel.

FOOTBALL AT STANFORD
IN A VERY BAD STATE
According to the following communica
tion from the Stanford University, several
proposed changes in the champion team
of the college will doubtless be made by
the removal of "heartless" players. The
letter reads:
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, October 21.
There never has been In the annals of foot
ball history at Stanford a week of practice
that contained more discouragement to those
who watch the football squad for signs of im
provement. The play throughout has been list
[ess and slumpish. The line has proved a woe
ful disappointment, and there Is a strong sen
timent that most of the men now holding
center places on the first team should be sup
planted, even If new men must be developed nt
this late day. The center trio, Blanchard.
Bigelow and James, have failed to do effective
work when the opportunities have been pre
sented. This weakness at center was particu-
!nr!y noticeable In the game Thursday with the
lowa Volunteers, when long and repeated gains
were made by bucking. The linemen, with the
exception of the â¢â¢-..â¢in. are even more disap
pointing: In offensive work. Until the big game
Coach Cross will use every effort to patch up
the present state of football affairs. Of the
new men out for center positions. Ed Oilman is
showing up exceptionally well. He is quick as
well as big and strong. "Wilson and Ruck are
doing creditably at tackle. The former. It is
thought, can lie developed Into one of the best
tackles Stanford has ever had. Back of the
line the men. owing to experience, are â bow-
Ing- up to better advantage than most of the
linesmen. Captain Fisher Is playing as hard
a game a." can be expected of him. Murphy is
punting In good form. Dole and Burmister,
who have been doing excellent work in advanc
ing- the ball, are at present laid oft on account
of Injuries.
In speaking of the freshmen team prospects,
Coach Cross laid: "I have never seen so little
spirit displayed by a clasp in Stanford, and I
have seen five classes here. Although Captain
Fisher and myself are out on the field three
quarters of' an hour before Varsity practice,
willing and anxious to coach these freshmen,
they do not meet us half way, and have enough
men on the field to fill out a second eleven.
Unless they get out and work like beavers they
will be unmercifully beaten by the Berkeley
freshmen eleven next Saturday."
The training table has started with the fol
lowing men: Captain Fisher. Blanchard. Big
low. James, Parker. Rea Smith. Murphy, Gll
man. MacKinnon. Erb, McFadden, Hies, Em
erson. Cairns and Fairls. Rusk. Wilson and
Burmister will remain at their present board-
Ing places for a week. The meals are under
the direction of Trainer McLeod. Breakfast
consists of oatmeal, chops, eggs, beefsteak,
fruit, coffee, dry toast and oatmeal water. At
noon the men Ret soup, cold meats, chops, dry
toact, baked potatoes and oatmeal water. Soup,
roast beef, vegetables, dry toast, oatmeal water
and a light dessert Is the fare of the men at
dinner. C. P. CUTTEN.

B postal card to the* members of the
San Francisco Yacht Club, announcing
the postponement of the minstrel per
formance which wns to have been given
;it tho clubhouse at Sausallto or. Octo
ber 29 for the benefit of the club. The
postponement was rendered necessary by
the political engagements of several of
those who had promised their services,
by the Good Roads' parade ami other
counter attractions. The yachting xsea
pon will, therefore, end to-day, ami tho
closing' cruise will be taken to-morrow.
A starting gun will be flrf-cl :it 11:15 a.
m., and further signals will be given from
the flagship. On Sunday, October 30,
Commodore Hill will sail the sloop Cyg
nus to the Corte Madera creek and lay
her up for the winter. Thr> postponed
minstrel show will be given later, either
In the clubhouse at Suusallto or in a
large hall in this city, probably on No
vember 19. Vice Commodore G. T. S.
White will attend the Corinthian closing
jinks to-day.
Last Sunday the Corinthians held the
last upper bay cruise of the season.
The Corinthians will hold their closing
jlrks at Tibumn this evening. After the
regular Corinthian dinner the show will
begin. There will be songs by Frank
Thompson, Ben Tarbox, Oscar Franks, B.
Mitchell, J. Cattacart, the Finnic broth
ers and D. McLaughlin; guitar playing
by the Nounan brothers; banjo playing
and other items. There will also be a
display of lantern slides. The building
of the new boat house has progressed,
and much of the lumber that was piled
around has been cleared away. Those
who wish to return to the city to-night
can take the frri^ht boat from Tiburon.
To-morrow, if there is any breeze, the
fleet will ptart about 11 in the morning
for a cruise along the water front and
toward the head?. On Sunday, October
30, the drawbridge will be opened and the
yachts will go into winter quarters in
the lagoon.
A. D. Harrison and Hervev Darneal
have bought the sloop Idler from T. L.
Miller and added her to the Encinal fleet.
The billiard tournament at the Eneinat
clubhouse has reached the semi-final
round. A. M. Ilicko, 00, plays Thomas
O'Connor, 130, and A. C. Ward, 120, plays
George T. Wright, 100.
Allen M. Clay of the California Yacht
Club, having become the owner of the
sloop Sam Vincent, has re-christened her
Paetolusâ a name that seems to suggest
boundless wealth. She is a roomy craft,
being 39 feet 6 Inches over all. with 13
feet 7 inches beam, and a draught of
about 4 feet. She is now on the "ways";
the Inside ballast will be taken out of
her and a 4700 pound Iron keel put on.
FULLER WILL
TRY FOR
CYCLE RECORDS.
George P. Fuller of the Olympic Club
Wheelmen, one of the fastest riders on
the coast, if not the fastest behind pace,
will make another attempt at lowering
records to-morrow on the Elmhurst track.
About a month ago Fuller made some rec
ord trials on the three-lap track at San
Jose and secured three. To-morrow he
will try to lower some of his own exist
ing marks and such others as he feels
able to negotiate. He will try for all dis
tances up to five miles, tandem paced, and
is reasonably sure of adding some more
scalps to his belt.
The Olympic Wheelmen are conducting
the record-breaking contest, and there
will be a large gathering of wearers of the
flying "O" t" witness the attempts. Some
club races will also be put on to fill in the
gaps while Fuller is resting up betweeen
trials. The events will start at 10 a. m.
The Associated Cycling Clubs' theater
party at the Tivoli on Wednesday even
ing, November 2, is just now interesting
the club wheelmen considerably. This
annual ev< Dl serves to bring together all
ttv> various factions, and is an evening of
much pleasure to the riders. Jules F.
Hancock is chairman of the committee in
charge of the event, and arrangements
;ir>- progressing speedily.
Ed Ross Lozter of Cleveland, who has
been on the coast for over a month now
with his bride, will return East to-night.
During hi? stay he has been the reclp
lent of many courtesies at the hands of
the local clubs, with whom he is ex
tremely popular, and his departure is
consequently very much regretted.
A cycling writer in Western Sports
says that Julius Smith, winner of first
time in the rec< nt ten-mile road race,
was "the undisputed champion among
the/ riders of the high wheel along about
1888 and 1889." Wonder if he ever heard
of FYank Klwell or Will Davis?
The members of the California Cycling
Cluh will have an old-time run on high
wheels to-morrow, leaving Stanyan and
Haight streets at 2 p. m. and riding
through the park. The club's handball
tournament will begin Tuesday night.
The Ray City Wheelmen and the San
Francisco Road Club will each hold a
llvt-rnlle road race over the San Leandro
course on Sunday. November 6. and a
large number of members of both clubs
are training for the events.
'The wheelmen are taking considerable
interest in the proposed parade to be held
next Saturday evening, the 29th, to cele
brate the repaying of Market street. The
Associated Cycling Clubs has taken the
matter in hand in conjunction with other
kindred organizations to whom the re
paying is a blessing. Several valuable
prizes have hern offered the wheelmen for
best appearance, largest club in line, etc..
and there is much friendly rivalry in this
respect among the riders. The Olympic
Club Wheelmen have sent out circulars
to the members urging all to appear in
line in full uniform, i nattached wheel
men will be cared for in the parade, and
the demonstration promises to be the
largest of its kind ever seen here.

GOLFERS AND THEIR
PLANS FOR NEW GROUNDS
The San Rafael Golf Club will have a
jubilee to-day in celebration of the con
summation of their plans for a new
grounds and clubhouse in one of the pret
tiest spots in the State. The new grounds
of the club will be situated two miles
from the San Rafael station of the San
Francisco and North Pacific Coast Rail
road. As soon as the building which will
house tho golfers is finished the railroad
officials will erect a station to be called
"Golf." which will bo distant from the
links a little over a half mile.
The clubhouse will be patterned after
the most famous home of golfers, the
Morris County Golf Club house. It is
the intention of the San Rafael Club to
lay out an I^-link grounds, the only one
in" the State. The links will be about
360 yards apart and over as tine a stretch
of land as there is in California. The
water supply will be obtained from the
Matin County Water Works, and will be
very plentiful. An immediate survey is
planned, and from the present outlook
the club will be ensconced in the new
home about the beginning of spring.
The San Francisco Golf Club will be in
a condition to enjoy the use of their ren
ovated grounds and the new clubhouse
which will soon be erected, about the
first of the year. To-day a handicap
tournament for men will bo played, post
entries, the prize being a pewter tankard
handsomely ornamented.
On the Oakland links this afternoon
there will be an eight entry tournament.
The schedule for the interclub matches
will have to bo rearranged on account of
the defection of the Burlingame and the
San Hafael clubs. Rafaelltes are suffer
ing from a lack of good players and the
consequent difficulty of forming a team.
The "Blingumites" have no good reason
for their withdrawal from the tourna
ment schedule.
The schedule of the San Francisco Club
for the series of games, lasting from the
early winter to the late spring, is now
in the hands of the printer and will be
ready in a few days.
Women of Woodcraft.
Redwood Circle No. 72, Women of Wood

CHAMPIONS WILL
ROW AT
LONG BRIDGE.
The oarsmen enjoyed themselves thor
oughly at Guerneville. and think the
course on Lake Bohemia an excellent one.
The regatta was quite successful, and
produced some good contests. ') ne ac
commodations for visitors were insuffi
cient, there bring a misunderstanding be
tween the regatta committee and the
Guerneville people with regard to the
number of contestants and officials for
whom accommodations would be needed
It is probable that a regatta will be held
on Lake Bohemia in the early part of
next year; in that case the regatta com
mittee will itself take charge of the work
of securing accommodations for the con
testants.
The defeat of the Alameda Seniors on
Lake Bohemia is attributed by them to
a leaky boat; it is also possible that the>
did not exert themselves to the utmost.
If they really rowed their hard*
would show that their previous vl Â£-? t â?
are largely to be attributed to the fact or
their having a fast barge. At any rate tt
will make their appearance in the (tom
pionship races interesting. The Dolphins
found two hard races in one day, alter a
long railroad journey and a night of
wakefulness. rather too much.
The Ariels have two crews in training
for the championships: An intermediate
and a junior. The intermediate crew con
sists of H. Wiison. bow; George- Steffens,
No. 2; James McK.-nna. No. 3, and James
Wilson st!"k.-. The junior crew is made
up thus: E. McDonough, bow; A. liaugn
ton No. 2; \Y. Oechsle, No. 3. and E.
Lynch, stroke. Oechsle rowed in the
Turners' crew at the Ariel regatta on
June 12. A senior barge crew, consisting
of W. Howe, F. Wilson. K. Ellis and J.
Nolan, may possibly be got together.
Either Frank Wilson or George "\\ . Phe
lan will enter the senior skirt race; if
Phelan does not row in the skiff he will
probably pull in the shell race. Of the
Junior skiff men, J. Fickert and Jam. s
McKenna am the most promising. The
Ariel Club entertainment and dance will
take place in Union-sauare Hall on Thurs
day night. October 27. A good programme
has been arranged.
The South Ends are actively preparing
for the championship regatta. Dr. C. C.
Dennis has begun training for the senior
skiff race, and hopes to retain the cham
pionship. J. Foley wishes that he had
t;tkÂ»n a shell up to Lake Bohemia, iit
will enter the senior shell race at Long
Bridge. The "midget" barge crew w.il
probably be broken up, as the association
threatens to disc4uallt"y R. McArthur; but
a senior barge crew has been made up of
James Pallas (bow), M. Breen i No. 2).
George Bates cNo. 3) and Ed Scully
(stroke). J. Lyons will enter the Junior
skiff race. Now that the club has a new
skiff its scullers are on equal terms with
those of the other clubs. The South Ends
will not send in any intermediate barge
crew but a junior tour v.: t ot w.

made for the South Ends' entertainment

some excellent talent having been en
gaged.
No club w'll be better represented at
the Long Bridge regatta than thÂ« Pio
neers, who will send in junior, interme
diate and senior barge crews and entries
in the Junior and senior .skiff races. Be
sides these, George Collopy will paddle in
a canoe and may also pull an outrig-ged

feated the Dolphins, after the latter had

will train faithfully for the championship
among the juniors, and may try for tae
intermediate championship as well.
The. Dolphin Junior barge crew has
broken up but the intermediate four will
row at Long Bridge. They have been
taking a rest, but will go out for practice
to-morrow morning. ......
The Alameda seniors are said to be in
different to their defeat at Guerneville,
and intend to retain their place as the
senior champions. Now that the brothers
Lewis have returned from Vallejo a new
Junior barge crew may be made up rom
posed or C Ayers. B. Guild, G. Lewis and
possibly Otto RiehL The present juniors
are not workers, and do not practice reg
ularly or train carefully.
Though several members of the Triton
Boat Club went up to Guerneville. none of
them was seen in any event. A, F.
Schuppert had entered in the junior skiff
race, but did not pull.
The regatta committee of the Pacific
Association of the Amateur Athletic
Union held a meeting in this city Tuesday
evening. The following were present: w.
C Espy (Pioneer Rowing Club, chairman;
S" J Pembroke (Alameda Boat Club). J.
R. Bookman (Ariel Rowing ciubi. secre
tary; Augustus Schimnf (Triton Boating
Club) A B. Rothkopr (Dolphin Boating
Club), and Julius W. Morton of the Olym
pic Boat Club.
The annual championship regatta to be
held at Long Bridee Sunday. November
6 was discussed. The programme will
include the following events: Senior and
junior single shell races, senior and ju
nior outrigged skiff races: senior inter
mediate and Junior barge races. The en
tries for rill these events will close Mon
day evening. October 31. with A. P. Roth
kopf. 20S Sutter street.
The committee decided that admission
to Long Bridge shall be free, and it is ex
pected that a larger crowd will be at
tracted than has been seen at a regatta
for several years past.
A platform will be erected on Long
Bridge and those who have donated
prizes or money to the regatta will be
introduced to the spectators and invited
to speak in the intervals between the
races. Upon a large roll of cloth will be
emblazoned the names of donors of med
als or subscriptions, and a list of the
donors will be sent to every member of
the clubs enrolled in the Pacinc Associa
tion.

EASTERN DOGS
AT THE
INGLESIDE PARK.
Ever on the alert to make affairs pleÃa
ant for their patrons, the managers of the
Ingleside Coursing Club contemplate hav
ing several improvements made In the
park in the near future. Recently the
club expanded considerable money in such
improvements as were deemed necessary.
It will be remembered by leashmen that
because of a depression in the field Im
mediately In front of the sllpner's stand
and about one hundred and fifty yards
distant from the point where the dogs
are slipped, hares have escaped from their
pursuers, the dogs running unsighted.
This drawback to coursing will soon be
only a matter of past history, as men are
now at work leveling the high ground
and filling in the hollow adjacent to the
fence which skirts the west side of tht,
grounds.
As stated in The Call of yesterday, the
drawing for the meetings of to-day and
to-morrow at Ingleside brought forth a
gaiaxy of fliers which cannot fail to at
tract a large gathering of sport lovers to
the park within which they will cut a

weeks at the track over the bay has been
dubbed a trifle too ','high class" by some
of the more exacting managers of horse
flesh, but Kntry Clerk Ik wden says he al
ready has the card for the opening day

of making each and every owner think
he has fallen Into a toft place., his asser
tion carries considerable weight. The
season in the East this year will hang on
until the snow.'flies, and the stables from
the other side of the mountains will no
doubt be dilatory in arriving.
From the present outlook, there will not

Racing associations should have thÂ« as
sistance of all honest minded people and
are deserving of praise in their efforts to
purify racing, but they make one very
grievous mistake. he riders themselves
are cooped up in a room, but how about
their valets? This very enterprising class
or gentry have begun to cut quite a cen
tra; rigure in racing of late, at least that
portion of it conducted under the roof of
the saddling paddock. Many of them
â¢"iniass bank roils in a short period that
Lie old-Univ steeplechaser Bourke Coeh

but they seem to escape the eye of rac
ing officials. They will bear " watching
and so will the thousand and one "grave
uigsrers'" employed on the outside by
many of the bookmakers. This latter
class, if possible, should be excluded from
the paddock.
And If racing is to be elevated another
depressing feature that should be elimi
nated from the game is the "tout." once'

Young Devin, the Sacramento light

ladder of fame, and unless his head out

successful. Just now he reclines peace
fully under the protecting wing of the as

British Ship Morven's
Hard Luck.
A MURDER ON PITCAIRN
THE MURDERER ON HIS WAY TO
FIJI TO BE HANGED.
Sloop-of-War Adams With Two
Hundred Naval Apprentice
Boys Aboard at Anchor
Off Goat Island.
The British ship Morven arrived from
Hull yesterday, after a quick passage "f
139 days. Tin.- Falls of Halladale and Mac
diarmid are both out 153 days from the
same port, and if they had the same ex
perience as the Morven it is no wonder
they are making long voyages. The
Morven had to fight her way through
three fields of ice and got badly mauled
about in the operation.
The Morven sailed from Hull on June
H. For the lirst two months of the voy
age all went well. In his report Captain
Page nays: "On July 2X, in latitude 36
Bouth, longitude 47.40 west, we encoun
tered .t terrific gale. The wind blew with
hurrii â¢ from the northwest and
there was a very high confused sea. The
ship's deck was constantly filled with
water, and everything movable on deck
was washed overboard. The masts and
yards were often lit up with the electri
city.
"On August 17, in latitude 58 south,
â¢ ..]â¢â¢ 80.30 west, we sailed into a large
field of Ice. This was at l a. m.. and as
i did not like the looks of things put the
vessel under easy sail. We sailed 36
miles before we sot clear of the ice, the
ship scraping through as best Bhe could.
This field extended from the northwest
to southeast as far aB the eye could
reach.
"August 20, in latitude 58.47 south,
longitude â¢;:'. west, we passed through
a line of broken ice and about six
hours later we encountered a third
field. This one was more densely packed
my of the Others. This waa about
7:30 a. m.. and the ship was put under
easy sail and the main yard was backed.
AI 10:30 a. m. found it advisable to wear
ship, and sailed to the northeastward of
tho Ice, which was more dense and packed
with large floes from ten to twelve feet
high. The ship bumped considerably, but
after three hours' hard work we k<H her
clear."
Tli." Morven was almost due south of
Cape Horn when she encountered the Ice
and Captain Page says be never wants
a similar experience. The run from 50
to GO was miidi- in seventeen days, and
thence to port fair weather pre
vailed. The ship was off port lust Thurs
day niffht, but Captain Page decided to
anchor on the bar. The vessel was towed

TO HELP THE RAILROAD.
A Proposed Tunnel With a Double-
Barreled Object in View.
f The proposition to tunnel under the
railroad track on the San Jose line at the
termination of Bosworth and Berkshire
streets, near the Sunnyside district, un
road track <>n th<- San Jose line at the
mlnation of Boswortb and Berkshire
â¢cts, near the Sunnyside district, un
der the pretext that it will benefit the
residents of the Sannyside and Mission,
is another way of helping the Market
Street Railroad Company at the expense
of the general taxpayers. This proposed
tunnel, which has been reported favorably
on by the Street Committee of the Board
of Supervisors, is on the direct line of the
proposed extension of the Market Street
Railroad Company's .branch line running
from the Mission road at or near College
Hill to the Glen Park tract, the site lately
selected as a monkey ranch.
The Market Street Company has been
trying for a number of years to obtain
a "franchise from Mission street to Sun
nyside, but the expense of building a road
and running a tunnel under the railroad
truck was considered to be too much of
an outlay for the amount of traffic in

' To obviate this and have the taxpayers
bear the expense It is now proposed to
have the Supervisors run the tunnel at

appropriation. This done, the Market

itself of its lately acquired franchise over
this route and run its tracks through the
tunnel, thus saving the expense of doing
the work.

EASTERiN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Oct. 21.â The motor nerve of
the worMs markets was touched to-day by the â ,
reported orders of the Government of France i
to Major irchand to retire from Fashoda.
There was a prompt recovery in Government se- I
curities in London anil Paris and :n corporate '
stocks at all foreign markets. For the same !
reason there was a weakening in the wheat j
markets of the world, including Liverpool, New j
York, Chicago an 1 San Francisco. This !
checked yesterday's advance in the stock mar- I
ket. Bui w!>.n it became evident later in the !
cay that there was good support in the wheat '
market from a continued heavy demand for ex- i
port. In spite of the subsidence of the war i
Bcare and of the continued ivy receipts at the |
primary point?, there sprang up the demand for I
railroad stocks, which showed itself, more con- j
fident and urgent than anything that has been |
Been in the stock market for several days. Nat
urally there was demand for the stocks of ,
grain-carrying roads. The strength was mani- j
fest not only in the Granger group proper, !
but also in the Pacifies, Including Northern, ;
Union and Atchlson. The preferred stock of ;
the la:- road was next to Si. Paul, the leader
of the railroads in point of activity, and way
firm throughout the day. closing with a net ;
gain of 1 per cent. The absorption of the stock :
in the- late dealings was on a very large 6cale. ;
The dullness and heaviness of the stocks of !
the great Eastern trunk lines were in strong ;
contrast, although according to a quoted ut
terance of fhe chairman of the New York Cen
tral directors many companies cannot get cars
enough to carry their freight coming forward,
but are cutting: rates ana making contracts
ahead at ligures below the rate schedule. It is
in line with this view to find the gross earn
ings of the Central for the September 30 quar- j
ter falling nearly $900,000 below those for the j
corresponding quarter last year, while the bal- j
ance available for dividend is 155-100 per cent, I
compared with 170-100 per â  â â :.; last ear. The
Btrength of Western, Southwestern and South
ern storks was quite general. Louisville leading
the latter group with an extreme rise of a
point. The movement of the industrial special
ties was relatively much less Important than ;
of late. Tobacco advanced an extreme 3 points,
but met heavy sales. Sugar was raided below
111. but met the resisting point, and Manhat
tan, although it weakened early on published !
utterances tending to discredit reports of early j
electrical equipment, later rose over a point.
Sterling exchange advanced further to-day, in i
response to the stiffness of reign money mar- j
kets. The local money market continued easy. â â¢
The gain of the New York banks from gold j
Imports from the sub-treasury and by reason i
of the marked decrease in the movement of I
currency to the interior is estima'pd to be not j
far from $10,000,000 for the week. How far the
reserve requirements have ben expanded
through enlarged deposits by reason of loans â 
made on sterling exchange cannot be closely 1
estimated, but it may run as high as $15,000,000. I
The bond market broadened and improved in
the course of the day and shows gains gener- i
ally. Total sales, {2,340,000.

NEW YORK, Oct. 21.â Bradstreet's to-mor

general business situation is unquestionably the
active foreign demand for wheat, wheat fWur

business reported on this account during the

it might be remarked that much of this demand
is necessarily what can be termed forward
business, and. Indeed, stocks In this country,
in spite of heavy current deliveries by farmers,
could hardly allow of prompt shipment, even
if the ocean freight situation was not a
strained one. Quotations for freight room have,
in fact, operated as a deterrent feature op this
export business. General distributive trade,

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, Oct. 21.â R. ''Â Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-mtirrow:
With growing foreign demand for American
products, exchange Is Influenced mainly by
political uncertainties abroad. While Europe
awaits the outcome between England and
France about the Upper Nile, the financiers of
all European countries are trying to force
upon each other the burden of providing cash
for the enormous demands of the United States.
England has so managed as to make Fiance
and Germany send most of the gold, and the
resulting war of exchange between foreign
nations checks for the moment the movement
of gold this way. Yet these and all other
causes do not so far hinder business as to pre
vent an excess over the moat prosperous of
previous years. The exchanges through all
daring houses for the past week have been
0.6 per cent larger than last year and 1.7 per
cent larger than in 1592, but outside of New
York for the week transactions were smaller
than in ISI<2.
The outgo of wheat staggers all prophets of
disasters, hut while the price has advanced 3
cents at the West, the rise would have been
much greater but for the feeling that the
enormous foreign demand may not last. Ex
ports, flour Included, have been for the past
week 3.3n5. 536 hushela at Atlantic ports, against
3.576,607 bushels last year, and 523, bushels
from Pacific ports, against 1.2Â»5.514 last year,
making for the three weeks 11,984,538 buchels,
against 14,227,390 last year. Without doubt
many Western fanners are still holding back
their wheat, and yet the receipts at the chief
Western points have been in three weeks 30,
592,4it4 bushels, against 23,726.801 bushels last
year. It is significant that this heavy demand
continues after foreign crops, officially reported
as fairly large, have been almost everywhere
harvested, the corn exports continue large,
being 2.G34.441 bushels, against 652,877 bushels
last year, and 7.007,009 bushels for three weeks.
against 3,914,764 bushels last year, and although
It is the bottom point of the year for corn,
prices have risen nearly II I,*1 ,* cents during the
week.
While cotton spinners are said to have agreed
upon a selling agency and a curtailment of
production, there Is a better demand for staple
goods and prospect of a better demand in
future. In woolen goods also there has beeen
a marked Improvement during the past week.
and better sales, with extensive inquiry. This
Is reflected in the large transactions In the
wool market, which amounted for the past
week to 4.566.500 pounds, of which 2.714. 4' Xl
pounds were domestic, makinc for the past
three weeks 10,836,100 pounds, against 31.162.7W
pounds for the same week last year, 20,765,500
pounds for the same week In 1896 and 19,481.660
pounds for the same week in 1892. Sales in
Boston have been the largest for nearly two
months, but at some concessions In price,
which are not reported In published quotations.
â With no orders as yet for the next season, thÂ«
manufacturers are altogether encouraged by
the Increase and have reason to believe that
the expected demand has set in But there is
yet the fact that the current demand is largely
for low-priced goods.
There Is much hesitation In the iron and
eteel trade, partly because the ontcome of vari
ous combinations in Bessemer pig, steel rails,
bars wire nails and the like cannot yet be
definitely anticipated. If general buying was
expected to result from these movements It has
not appeared thus far. Yet prices of domestic
products have not declined, and although the
tone Is somewhat weaker for bars and plates
quotations are in part sustained by consider
able orders for exports. The plate mills have
received orders for 20,000 tons from the Govern
ment for ship purposes, and the bar and billet
mills have a very encouraging demand.
Failures for the week have been 221 in the
Unitedp States, against 224 last year, and 24 in
Canada, against 36 last year.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 21.â disappearance of the
European war rumors and cable advices that
the Continental markets were entirely indiffer
ent to the excitement raised yesterday caused
a cessation In the Inflated prices of wheat at
the opening:. English consols had also re
covered yesterday's decline and wheat at Liv
erpool closed 1%@1%c lower than last nlÃht.
With such an array of conditions confronting
them even the most radical bulls considered it
prudent to at least wait for a reaction in
prices. Export clearings from the Atlantic
ports were equal to 621,000 bushels, and Chicago
receipts only amounted to 237 cars, against 247
for the same day last year. There was a
good general trade and December wheat opened
V; i. lower at 67@-6"Uc, ranged between 66% c
to 87% c during the forenoon. As the session
neared the close it was evident that the offer
ings of the last two days were more than that
market could absorb and December stood off
to 66% c and closed at C6%c, a loss of iv 4c4 c from
yesterday. May kept precisely lc premium and
closed at 67V
Better weather, lower cables and a disappear
ance of the Nile incident counted against corn
at the start. There was generous selling of
long corn by large Interests, and despite heavy
covering by shorts there was quite a backset
In prices. December left off with a loss of 1@

barge receipts of hogs everywhere, the weak

WILLIAMSON'S
LADY MAY
BE A MAN
Alleged Victim of a
Neat Scheme.
LOVE LETTERS ARE BOGUS
WRITTEN BY A SHARPER WHO
IS POSTED.
In the Meantime "Mabel Starr"
Does Not Stop Writing, and
Occasionally Receives
Money.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 21
There is more than a suspicion at the
City Hair that the "lady" who has writ
ton'a small library of love letters to Wil
liamson is a man who is taking advan
tage of WK'.iamson's weakness.
A few days ago Williamson laid before
the Chief of Police a big bundle of letters,
which purported to come from "Mabel A.
Starr" of San Francisco. Williamson told
the Chief that he had sent money to
Mabel and she had even fixed the wedding
day. but that she never kept her appoint
ment. Williamson has never seen the
young lady, but is deeply in love with
her and intends to find her if possible.
The letters are full of endearing: senti
ments, and Mabel is evidently very well
versed in the art of letter writing.
Williamson has corresponded regularly
and when the fair girlâ she was adver
tised as fairâ asked for money it was
promptly sent. The lover admits that he
first commenced corresponding with
"Miss Mabel A. Starr." because of an
advertisement which appeared in a paper
named the "Marriage Bell."
j "We have made some inquiry," said the.
' Mayor to-day, "as we were led to take an
interest in Williamson, and we are about
convinced that William's lady is a
man. Most of the letters are received by
messenger and I understand that so late
as this week Williamson has received a
letter from 'Mabel A. Starr.' It is pretty
certain that the young lady has no exis
tence and that Williamson is being
â¢worked' by some one who understands
him. He is not very strong-minded and
is at present out of work, but his married
sister in San Francisco sees that he wants
for nothing.
"Williamson has been watched and a
stranger has frequently been seen to hand
him letters in the City Hall park and
other places, and it Is pretty clear that
there is no woman in the case at all, ex
cept possibly one that is being used as a
dummy. Williamson Is rather a nice fel
low and I think this scheme will soon be
spoiled."
At one stage in the game a friend nam
ed Chamberlaine undertook to help Wil
liamson out and in response to his letter
to Mabel, the "girl" wrote as follows:
If you are going away I want your address. i
Please give It to Williamson, and after we get i
Fettled we will do something: handsome for yuu.
You deserve Its. I -am sure-Mr. Williamson will ;
Bay so. too. I have decided to meet Mr. Wil- i
liamson next Sunday, 2Sih, lor two reasons.
One is that it is a quiet day, free from toll
and noise, ana another one Is that It Is my
birthday. I don't think that 1 could choose a
more fitting day for our first meeting. Now
you tell Mr. Williamson to meet me next Sun
day morning at 10:30 o'clock in the ferry depot
at the foot of Market street, San Francisco,
on the broad-gauge side. I will wear a black
silk skirt and a blue silk waist and white straw
hat trimmed with violets, also a bunch of vio
lets on my breast, so that he will know me.
Now. I don't want him to go to any great
trouble to dresÃ himself up, as I want to see
him as he is himself.

Peculiar Suit of Walter Turnbull
Against Thomas Pheby.
OAKLAND, Oct. 21.â Walter Turnbull
to-day filed suit against Attorney Thomas
B. Pheby. Both are popular young pro
fessional men of this city.
The suit is over a certain alleged con
tract by the terms of which the two par
ties engaged in the purchase and sale of
stock and corporate securities for their
joint benefit. The company is known as
the Stock and Bond Exchange of San
Francisco. The plan was to quickly re
alize fortunes on the purchase and sale
of capital stock of corporations; Pheby
to furnish the money for the purchases,
and to sell at an advanced price.
The complaint does not Intimate that
the expected fortunes were not realized,
but Pheby has failed to settle up and re
mit one-half the profits according to the
agreement, so the complaint charges, In
fact the plaintiff alleges that no final ac
count and settlement have been made, ac
though 715 shares of the capital stock
of the Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar
Company, 135 shares of the Giant Powder
Company's stock and 400 shares of the
capital stock of the San Francisco Gas
and Electric Company have been pur
chased, but since the sales Turnbull has
received no profits whatever.

BAIL-JUMPER SURRENDERS.
Wheeler Forgot Date of Trial and
Went to Mexico.
OAKLAND, Oct. 21.â Several months
ag Edward L. Wheeler, arrested for re
ceiving stolen goods, lumped his $200 bail,
puzzling the Sheriff, the court and his at
torney. Tom Bradley. To-day Wheeler
called on Sheriff White and gave him
self up. He was immediately locked up
in the County Jail.
"I had business that required my pres
ence down in Mexico." Mud Wheeler this
afternoon, "and. any way, 1 forgot the
date of my trial, su I left. This trouble
is all about a pair of old shoes, and
knowing that they couldn't hang me for
it, 1 made no bones about coming back."
GRAND JURY'S REPORT
MAY AFFECT POLITICS
EXPECTS TO END ITS WORK
NEXT TUESDAY.
Has Been in Session Ten Months and
Will File a Lengthy Docu
ment.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Oct. 21.
The Grand Jury was engaged to-day
preparing its final report. It has been in
session for ten months, and the report will
be of unusual length. It is known that
many matters will be dealt with regard
ing the conduct of some of the county of
ficers that may have some effect on their
chances in the coming election. Justices
of the Peace, Supervisors and others will
probably be criticized, and it is also re
ported that a claim for $5000 may be
brought against the estate of the late
official stenographer.
The political complexion of the Grand
Jury is sufficient to assure that the report
will be of unusual interest, although there
is a possibility that much that might be
incorporated will be orderc-d out by the
Judge who receives it on the ground that
the Grand Jury cannot make any com
ments unless it has ground for believing
that 'rime exists, a decision to this effect
having been recently rendered in the
southern part of the State.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1893.
MAYOR FEELS
KINDLY TO
THE PEDDLERS
Says They Should Not
Be Persecuted.
PAY A FAIR LICENSE
COMPARED TO MINISTERS AND
DOCTORS.
Vetoes the Ordinance Making It a
Misdemeanor to Call a
Housekeeper to the
Door,
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
<*S Broadway, Oct. 21.
The peddlers have a friend In Mayor
Thomas. He does not think it right that
the city should charge them a license of
$15 per quarter and then make it a crime
for them to pursue their calling.
Some days the City Council passed an
ordinance making it a misdemeanor for
peddlers to call at houses where there is
a sign displaying the words "No ped
dlers."
In his message to the Council expressing
his disapproval of the ordinance the
Mayor says:
I have not sipned said ordinance for the fol
lowing reasons:
Licenses are issued to peddlers under an or
dinance now in l'orce; the money derived from
this source is no small portion of vhe city s
ri-wmie.
While the Council has the right to regulato
peddling and has already, by ordinance, re
stricted peddlers fn.m offering their gocxln.
wares and merchandise within the limits
bounded by Sixth and Fourteenth, Clay and
Webster streets, thus limiting them to the
residence portion in which to carry on their
business, I think it very unjust after Brant ing
permission by licensing peddlers that you
should pass an ordinance making it a crime
for a peddler to rlnft a doorbell for the reason
that a housewife might perhaps be annoyed
by it. With the came propriety you might
pass an ordinance making it a misdemeanor,
punishable by fine cr imprisonment, tor a
butcher, baker, grocer, minister or doctor to
ring the doorbell In one of the thousand resi
dences in our city if the householder should
ornament his door step with a tin si*n an
nouncing the fact to the public that none of
the above named were wanted.

By Following the Trail Backward the
Teamster's Lifeless Body Was
Found, With Skull
Crushed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 21. <
A heavy wagon drawn by two -horses
was seen this afternoon approaching -the
: -TYÂ«sbster -street- bridssrtrzz the . AiSmeda
! side of the estuary. No- driver was ; in
- sight, and after stopping the 'horses a
I search was made for the man In charge
: of them. Following the trail of the wagon
! backward the driver was found lying on
i the road with a ghastly wound in his
head, which had evidently been caused
: by one of the wheels passing over him.
Assistance was at once summoned, but
the injuries were necessarily fatal, and
before the Receiving Hospital was reach
ed the man was dead.
The driver was J. G. Shulte, an em
ploye of the Standard Oil Company It
is presumed that when approaching Web-
Bter street bridge one of the horses shied,
i throwing the driver out, and that one of
! the wheels of the heavy wagon passed
I over his head. The deceased lived at
! Fruitvale, and has worked for the com
pany for some years. He was a very
steady man, about 50 years of age, and
his employers are somewhat mystified
that he should have been thrown out as
he was driving horses to which he had
long been accustomed. He leaves a widow
and a son, A. F. Shulte. a young attorney,
who recently returned from a trip to the
Klondike.

long communication setting out a plan for
connecting Oakland and San Francisco

nance A writ of habeas corpus will
nrobably be invoked in their behalf.
License Inspector Malvon proposes to
include in his list of violators the con
tractor who is hauling: mail to and from

oth<ir point, though Postmaster Friend
opines that the local ordinance cannot
reach the contractor.

CALL NEWSBOYS GO
TO THE BIG CIRCUS
THEY HAD A GLORIOUS TIME
TAKING IN THE SIGHTS.
About a Thousand Children From
Different Charitable Institu
tions Given Free Admis
sion Yesterda7.
The Call newsboys had a glorious time
at the circus yesterday. Those who could
not go in the afternoon went in tIA; even
ing, and they thoroughly appreciated the
kindness of The Call and the courtesy of
Mr. Wallace in giving them the opportun
ity of having a real good time. Each had
a special ticket of admission stuck In nis
hat, and the- way they rushed to get a
good seat was amusing. They applauded
everything and laughed uproariously at
the antics of the c.owns.
The members of the Order of the East
ern Star had a special box last night as
the guests of C. N. Thompson, the man
ager of the circus, who is a member of
the order himself. Suspended in front of
the box was a beautiful tlural star.
Yesterday afternoon about 1000 children
from charitable institutions took in the
circus at the special invitation of Mr.
Wallace, and it is needless to say that
they thoroughly enjoyed the treat and
had a splendid time. They came from the
following organizations: Ladies' Protec
tive and Aid Society, Kindergarten Ch: r
ity Society, Maria Kip Orphanage, Little
Sisters' Infant Shelter, Boys' and Girls'
Aid Society.
The circus has been doing a good busi
ness, and seems to be giving general sat
isfaction. Last night every seat was oc
cupied and a number had to be provided
with chairs in front of the boxes. The
living- statuary is something new, and is
worth the price of admission. Everything
goes with a swing and the excitement is
kept up from start to finish.

Glock objected to any card being put up
unless Koehler and Hintermann bought a
dollar ticket for the County Jlonaghan

Koehler was on a ladder tacking on the
card to the wall Glock kicked the ladder
from under him and cut him over the
right eye with a pocket knife. Hinter
mann went to Koehler's assistance, but
Glock knocked him down and kicked
him. Mrs. Ouldemann. seeing thf affray,
ran across the street and abused Glock
for hlt< conduct. Glock rurudk her on the
face, knocking her down and blackening
her eye. It was getting too hot for them,

of the field.

RED CROSS WORK.
The Society Has Served 75,174
Lunches to Soldiers This Year.
The San Francisco Red Cross will move
to-day into the Nucleus building, as the
rooms so lons donated to its use by Claua
Spreckels are being utilized as a law li
brary. During the week the Hospitality
Committee has served lunch to 800 sol
diers on board the Senator and to 525 on
board the Valencia, making the sum to
tal of all lunches served since the trouble
with Spain began 75,174. The workers at
16 Post street have been very busy pre
paring packages to be forwarded to Ma
nila, and Invite all those having any
thing to send to the soldiers to leave it at
this address.
The furnishing of a cook for the Di
vision Hospital by the society, and the
Improvement in the cooking thereby, have
been, according to the physicians, the
means of restoring health to many of the
sick and are also responsible for the fact
that since that time only three deaths
have occurred. In a letter. Colonel Fife
granted permission to the ladies to serve
lunch to the men under his command,
while in port, and has written them this
note:
I take this occasion to thank you for the
many courtesies we have rf.Â«ivpÂ«l at your
hands and for the noble work done by the
Red Cross of this city. We nre Kr.'itfful, and
the officer* and the men of this command ap
preciate what you have done in the cause in
which you are now engaged. I am sincerely
yours, W. J. FIFE,
Lieutenant Colonel First "Washington Volun

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER L>2, IS9B.
MET DEATH
BY FLAMES
IN A HOTEL
Five Persons Perish
at Clairville.
RAPID SPREAD OF THE FIRE
TWO PERSONS ESCAPE B\ JUMP
ING FROM WINDOWS.
A Chinaman Suspected of Having
Caused the Terrible Disaster.
The Pecuniary Loss Is
Light.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
BECKWITH, Oct. 21.â A representa
tive of The Call arrived here this even
nlgr from Clairville, a small village
twelve miles west of here and the west
ern terminus of the Sierra Valley Rail
road, with the following particulars of
a fire which resulted in the death of
five persons:
The fire, which was discovered in the
Clairville Hotel at an early hour this
morning, sprtad so rapidly that five
persons were burned to death and the
other inmates barely escaped with their
lives by Jumping from second story
windows.
The dead are:
MRS. CORONADO, mother-in-law
of Charles E. Roberts, the proprietor
of the hotel.
FLORENCE ROBERTS, the six
year-old daughter of the hotel
keeper.
CARSON BT7RNEY, a fireman on
the Sierra Valley railroad.
POMPEY PERDINI, owner of a
sawmill and ranch.
A waiter-girl from Carson, whose
name cannot be ascertained.
Chat Roberts, a rancher and notable
character of the neighborhood, escaped
by jumping from a second story win-
dow, but was injured to an extent
which cannot be determined until medi
cal aid reaches here; but it is feared he
may not recover.
Joe McCormack. a conductor on the
Sierra Valley road and a son of Con
ductor McCormack of the Virginia and
Truckee, escaped without serious in
jury by jumping from a window.
McCormack gave the following ac
count of his experience:
"I was awakeaed by some one yell
ing fire. I opened th>^ door and saw
that I could not get out that way, as
the stairs were on fire. Almost before j
j I could think what to do, the flames j
burst into my room and I jumped out ,
of the window, with nothing on me but j
my nightshirt. By tb*_. SffiS 1. SOBkti
look around. to st-o if all were saved j
entire building was in flames, and '
~m"a"short time we made the horrible
discovery that the others had per- I
ished."
Charles and Mrs. Roberts were awak
ened by the alarm of fire, but the (lames
had not only cut off all possibility i>f
their escape by the stairway, but the
passageway leading to their daughter's
rooms was in flames. They had little
time to even think what might be done
before the flames were upon them and '
| they were forced to jump for their
' lives.
They were horror-stricken on failing
| to find their daughter and Mrs. Rob
erts' mother, and as the building was
then a mass of seething flames, the \
awful truth dawned upon them that 'â 
both Florence and Mrs. Coronado were
victims to the fury or the fire. It is
supposed the aged woman and child
were overcome by the smoke and were
cremated in their room.
McCormack and Chat Roberts lost
their clothing â in fact, nothing was
saved from the building. The pecu
niary loss is probably $1200, with but j
little insurance. The origin of the fire
may never be definitely known, but the '
few who escaped are inclined to be
lieve it was caused by an incendiary '
and suspicion points toward a China- \
man as the miscreant.
The Roberts family have quite a his
tory. Chat Roberts is the father of |
Charley, Joe, I-se<lford and Bill Roberts, j
who composed the once notorious gang j
of outlaws known as the "Roberts Â«
gang," and who, a number of years j
ago, were implicated in a Southern Pa- i
cific hold-up near Reno.
Two of the boys have since died. The ;
father and the other two sons have
been engaged in the hotel and other
business enterprises In Plumas County
for a number of years.
DAMAGE SUIT COMPROMISED.
Southarn Pacific Pays $2000 for a

SUISTJN, Oct. 21.â The damage suit of j
Edward Dehaven of Vacaville against the !
Southern Pacific Company has been com- !

WILL GET A
MAJORITY IN
THE SENATE
Republicans Sure to
Control.
THIRTY TERMS EXPIRE IN '99
SOUND MONEY MEN CERTAIN TO
BE IN THE LEAD.
Byesult of Selections by the Legisla
tures Next Year Are in Doubt
in Washington and
1 Wyoming.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Oct. 21.
In view o. the importance of the
financial question, as well as of the
necessity that the Republican party
have a Congress in accord with the ad
ministration on other questions and
especially the war problem, the politi
cal complexion of the next Senate is a
matter which is now being considered
with great interest.
The terms of thirty Senators expire
on March 3, 1599. These are Aldrich of
Rhode Island, Burrows of Michigan,
Clark of Wyoming, Davis of Minnesota,
Hale of Maine, Hanna of Ohio, Hawley
of Connecticut. Lodge of Massachu
setts, Proctor of Vermont, Quay of
Pennsylvania and Wilson of Washing
ton, Republicans; Bate of Tennessee,
CockrelJ of Missouri, Daniel of Vir
ginia, Faulkner of West Virginia, Gor
man of Maryland, Gray of Delaware,
Mills of Texas, Mitchell of Wisconsin,
Money of Mississippi, Murphy of New
York, Pasco of Florida, Roach of North
Dakota, Smith of New Jersey. Turpie
of Indiana and White of California,
Democrats; Allen of Nebraska and
Stewart of Nevada, Populists, and
Cannon of Utah and Mantle of Mon
tana, Silver Republicans.
Senators uanna of Ohio, Daniel of
Virginia, Aldrich of Rhode Isiand and
Money of Mississippi have already been
elected to the long term beginning on
March 4. 1899. Judge L. E. McComas
has been chosen in Maryland to suc
ceed Senator Gorman and Joseph Si
mon was recently chosen to occupy the
vacant seat in Oregon, so that there
are remaining twenty-five Senators yet
to be elected. Of these retiring nine
are Republicans, twelve Democrats,
two Populists and two Silver Repub
licans.
Of the nine Republicans whose terms
expire, seven will surely have Repub
lican successors, but there may be a
doubt as to Clark of Wyoming and
"Wilson of Washington. Bryan carried
Wyoming by 583 votes, but the Repub
licans had the - Legislature \ff fifteen
majority. The great improvement in
business, especially in the wool trade,
which is very important in that State,
leads Wyoming Republicans to believe
that they will carry the State this fall.
In Washington the outlook is not so
encouraging. Bryan had 12,493 plural
ity over McKinley and the Legislature
stood eighty-five fusion to twenty-six
Republicans. Senator Wilson believes
that the State will go Republican this
fall, but there is room for doubt In the
matter.
Four of the twelve Democrats, Bate
of Tennessee, Cockrell of Missouri,
Mills of Texas and Pasco of Florida,
will be succeeded by Democrats. 'Ph. is.;
from West Virginia, Delaware, Wiscon
sin, New York, North Dakota, New
Jersey, Indiana and California will in
all probability be succeeded -y Repub
licaiMf the only doubtful cases being
Delaware and Indiana. In the first
named the present Legislature is large
ly Democratic, but with harmony in
the Republican ranks there is but little
doubt that in the next the latter will
have a good working majority. Indi
ana, is always a doubtful State for Re
publicans, but in 18y6 McKinley had
18,181 plurality over Bryan and the
Legislature was Republican by twenty
majority. In West Virginia the Re
publicans had twenty-one majority, in
New Jersey twenty-one, in North Da
kota forty-two and in California four
teen. In New York, where the strong
est fight may be expected, the Reput>.
I leans last fall, after a most disastrous
campaign, won the Legislature by
thirty-four majority, and with a Gov.
ernor to elect this fall, together with a
full State and Legislative ticket, they
may be safely counted on to send a
Republican to the Senate to succeed
Mr. Murphy.
It is safe to say that Senator Stewart
will, if he desires, be his own successor
from Nevada, and in any event that
State will send a free silver Populist in
his place. Nor is the outlook at all fa
vorable in Nebraska. The present Leg
islation stands as follows: Fusionists
67, Independents 30, Democrats 7. and
Republicans 39. This gives an anti-
Republican majority of 55. While the
complete disproval of all free silver
predictions as to the results of the Re
publican victory in 1896 tends to
strengthen the Republican cause, the
heavy defalcations of two Republican
State officials have had a very bad ef
fect on the party, and the further fact
that Nebraska is Mr. Bryan's State will
lead the opposition to put forth every
elTort to win. In view of all this, it
will not be at all surprising or dis
couraging if the Republicans lose the
citate this fall. In that case it Is prob
able that Senator Allen will be re
elected.
In Montana the Free Silver Repub
licans will likely control the Legisla
ture, while in Utah the contest will lie
between the Free Silver Republicans
and the Democrats, with the chances
favoring the latter. The present Leg
islature is composed of sixty Democrats
and three Republicans. However, Sen
ator Cannon, Free Silver Republican,
is a candidate for re-election, and as
his father, George Q. Cannon, the prac
tical head of the Mormon church, is a
power with the voters of that faith, the
election may be thrown to the Silver
Republicans.
In Montana the present Legislature
stands fifty-three Democrats, nineteen
Populists and nineteen Republicans,
but this result being brought about by
a general fusion of all the free silver
forces cannot be regarded as showing
that the Free Silver Republicans proper
may not be strong enough to re-elect
Senator Mantle.
On the basis figured out above the
thirty-one Senators who will take their
seats on March 4, 1899, will be divided
politically as follows: Republicans,
nineteen, a gain of seven; j 'emocrats,
six, a loss of six; Populists, two; Free
Filver Republicans, two. This leaves
two in doubt â Wyoming and Washing
ton.
The nineteen Republicans will all be
for sound money, and should the Re
publicans succeed in carrying Wyom
ing and Washington there would be
two raore, as the Senators from these
States voted against the Teller reso
lution. Leaving them out of the ques
tion, however, it would be a gain of
nineteen. The twenty-seven holdover
Republicans are all sound money men,
and the total Bound monÂ«y Repub
licans' strength would then be forty
six, or exactly a majority of the entire
Senate.
TO DIVIDE WORK WITH
CHURCH OF ENGLAND
Episcopalians Decide tc Take Such
Action Before Beginning Inde
pendent Work in Hawaii.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 21.â The general
convention of the Episcopal church to
day adopted a resolution recommending
a conference with the Church of England
before entering upon Independent work
In Hawaii, the two churches doing Joint
work there now under agreement. The
Pacific Coast delegates wanted no delay,
but were overruled. Provision was made
for the commission to start work in Cuba
and Porto Rico at an early day.
Among the propositions adopted were
those establishing a new missionary dis
trict in Kioto, Japan; discontinuing fur
ther revision of the hymnal, agreeing to
further conference with Bishops on final
date of adjournment, and naming a spe
cial committee to report on the question
of a standard Bible.
The establishment of the general fea
tures of a judicial system for the church
came up on the consideration of article
IX of the proposed revision of the con
stitution. As finally presented the article
provides courts for trying of Bishops,
presbyters and deacons, courts of review
and an ultimate court of appeals to con
sider questions of doctrine, faith or wor
ship. The main criticism was directed
against the clause providing that Bishops
shall be tried by "Bishops only." The
clause was retained after much discus
sion and a vote.
The House of Bishops agreed on a com
mittee of five Bishopsâ South Dakota,
New Mexico and Arizona, the Platte,
Spokane and Duluthâ to prepare a code
of canons for missionary districts.

FITZGERALD IS
REGISTERED IN
TWO COUNTIES
The "Hefting" Mayor's Candidate
for Public Administrator
Shown in a Bad Light.
Democrats of Alameda County Ask Pointed
Questions Regarding His Connection
With Many Nefarious Schemes.
Over in Alamcda County the men who
keep in touch with State and municipal
politics have not recovered from the shock
they sustained when they learned that
l>abor Commissioner E. L. Fitzgerald had
received the nomination for Public Ad
ministrator from the Democratic narty in
this city. It is abhorrent to them to
think that such a man should be selected
to handle the estates of widows and or
phans.
Here is a demagogue, a carpet-bagger,
the alleged friend of labor, utterly ac
credited among his own people, and yet
he Is taken up by "Hefting" Boss Phelan
and his committee of one hundred.
Do the people of Sun Francisco want a
repetition of thi I Troy Dye, one
time Public Administrator in Sacramento?
"When business was dull, this gentle
savage, who ultimately suffered death
upon the scaffold, went out and killed a
man so he might administer his estate.
Mr. Fitzgerald now appears on the
Great Register of Alameda County and
also upon that of San Francisco. When
he registered in this city he made, oath
to many untrue statements as to residence
and previous registration, and thus ren
dered himself liable to punishment for
felony. His registration in Alameda
County has never been canceled.
Representative men of Oakland have
many unpleasant things against him.
They would like him to explain the part
he played in the contract marriage
whereby Shelby Martin wa* tricked into
en alleged alliance with Valeria Hlcke.
thier.
They would like him to explain his con
nection with the "cup contest" scandal
during the Midwinter Fair. People are
asking if he betrayed Alameda County, In
. he lived, and how the $300 paid by
Eolano County men wa.s divided.
Will he tell of the firms "held up " on
various pretexts by the office which he
: Led during the pa-st three years?
It is an open secret that representative
men of the Democratic party have gone
t a. M. Lawrence of the Examiner since
:: was made and warned
him not to come out in support of this
man's candidacy for the office of Public
Administrator. They laid before him a
long list of offenses and threatened to
make them public. They were asked not
to take euch severe remedial methods on
the ground that their publication would
Jeopardize the entire Democratic ticket.
That he id a man who has no apprecia
tion of the solemnity of an oath is shown
by the reckless manner in which he has
violated the registration laws. On the
21st of February, 18%, he appeared before
O. C. Woodsum, Deputy County Clerk of
Alameda, and registered, giving his place
of residence as 221S Dana street, Berke
ley. He then made affidavit that he would
have resided in Alameda County ninety
days and in the precinct thirty days next
preceding the uate of the succeeding
election. He' swore that his postofflce ad
dress was at that time Berkeley.
Ignoring all these matters, which are
of record, he again registered in this city
on August s, 1898, making his affidavit be
fore J. \V. Hose, Deputy Registrar of vot
ers. Mr. Rose is a prominent member of
the Building Trades Council and has
often fought Fitzgerald's battles on us
floor. This registration is in direct opposi
tion to State law, which makes it a fel
ony, and speaks in no uncertain terms re
garding the crime and its punishment.
'J.*he State law reads:
Registration, Who Entitled Toâ No per
son's name must be entered by the clerk
unless:
1. Upon a certificate of registration in
another county, showing that such registra
tion has been canceled, and upon proof, by
the affidavit of the party, that he is an
elector of the county in which he sÂ«eks to
be registered.
Fraudulent Kegistrationâ Every person
who willfully causes, procures or allows
himself to be registered in the Great Reg
ister of any county, knowing himself not
to be entitled to such registration, la pun
ishable by a fine not exceeding one thousand
dollars, or by Imprisonment in the County
Jail or State frlbon not exceeding one
year, or by both. In all cases where, on the
trial of a person charged with any offense
under the provisions of this section, it ap
pears in evidence that the accused stands
registered In the Great Keglster of any
county, without being qualified for suoh
registration, the court must order such reg
istration to be canceled.
Section 17 has, among other provisions,
the following:
Any person making a false oath with re
spect to residence, as provided fur in this
section, shall be deemed guilty of perjury,
and on conviction, punished accordingly.
When Mr. Fitzgerald appeared before
the Deputy Registrar he swore he was not
registered in any other county in thi3
Btate. He swore he had resided in San
Francisco five years. He swore he had
resided in the precinct in which he was
then being registered one year.
His San Francisco registration was
madÂ© on August 8, and yet at that time
and at the present time his name was
and is upon tne great register of AJameda
County and has not been canceled. This
Is in direct opposition to the State law,
â which thus brands him vf perjurer.
Mr. Fitzgerald, if inj an explaining
mood, might tell of the work he did as
go-between in arranging the details of
the contract marriage between Shelby
Martin and Miss Valeria Hlckethier. Ac
cording to Miss Hickethier he bought the
riritj, had it engraved and arranged all
the preliminaries. He also thoughtfully
provided the witnesses to the alleged
marriage.
She explained in the newspapers of
June 24, 1895, the parts played by herself
and Mr. Fitzgerald at the time, as fol
lows:
Mr. Martin signed that contract In good
faith and he cannot reeort to any plea that
he was undfr the Influence of llcjunr.
We had been keeping company for some
time and finally agreed to get married. Mr.
Martin did not want the affair made publlo
and neither did I. It was then agreed that
we should be married by contract and that'
the matter should be kept a secret. Mr.
Fitzgerald was informed of our intentions
and he purchased the wedding ring I now
â wear on my finger four dnya before the
contract waa signed. Mr. Martin told me
he would provide rooms in the Oalindo
Hotel, I believe, where the ceremony
could be performed. He changed i.U mind
afterward, as he thought to secure rooms
at the hotel might cause some comment.
On the morning of March 27, 1890, 1 told
Mr. Martin that I was going to San Fran
cisco and would return on the & o'clock
boat in the evening. That morning he had
the contract made out on the typewriter.
He said he would meet me in the evening.
When I arrived in Oakland with my friend
Mrs. liostwick we were met by Mr. Martin.
He eeeorted me to rooms he had provided
in the Maison Piedmont. I was surprised
that he should take me to a French res
taurant, but I thought he knew what was
best, as he wished the matter kept secret.
Mr. Fitzgerald and the lawyer were both
there. The contract was signed in their
presence. Mr. Martin then placed the wed
ding ring on my finger and accepted me as
his wife.
I want to say right here there was no din
ner and no carousing. I do l.ot believe we
wore in the room mow than 20 minutes. -
Mr. Fitzgerald is mistaken In regard to a
dinner. We did not have anything to eat
at all. After the contract was signed I
believe Mr. Fitzgerald said: "Let in* have
a bottle of wine." A bottle of champagne
waa brought In and opened. I do not re
member whether I drank any or not.
Mr. Fitzgerald in attempting his own
defense said:
The circumstances under w-h,lch the mar
riage contract between Shelby Martin and
Miss Hickethler was made are briefly told.
Buth Martin and Miss Hickethler are my
warm personal friends. That is one rea
son why. I i>resume. I was called upon to
become a witness to the contract. So no
lather reasons that I know of caused me to
me Involved in the matter.
Among Miss Hickethier's effects at her
death in November, 1895, was a joint note
made by K. L. Fitzgerald and Ole C. Vin
zent. This was appraised at 9308 20, be
ing the note with accrued interest. J. T.
Fleming, attorney for F. J. O. Folte, ad
ministrator of decedent's estate, endeav
ored by every nienas possible to collect
the money. The day before the note
would have become outlawed a suit was
brought and to this a demurrer was filed
by K. M. Fitzgerald, attorney for the
signers. The case was fought bitterly
until E. L. Fitzgerald became a candi
date for office. He then settled the note,
paying but 50 cents on the dollar to Mr.
Folte, the administrator.
For years there has been fin unholy al
liance between Mr. Fitzgerald and one
Ole C. Vincent In March, 1893, they ap
pear jointly as the signers of the note for
$240. found among the effects of the late
Miss Valeria Hickethier of Oakland. In
May of the following year they became
involved in the "cup scandal" in connec
tion with the Midwinter fair. Vlnzent was
in charge of the voting for a cup offered
by the Examiner. It was his duty to de
stroy the ballots after they had been once
voted. The contest developed a bitter
struggle between Alameda County men,
headed by Senator Eli Denison, and So
la:io County. Representatives of Alameda
County discovered that ballots once cast
by its representatives were being sold to
Solano County and revoted in its favor.
Mr. Fitzgerald might now explain the
part he played in this nefarious scheme.
He might tell his constituents in the
Democratic party about the movements
of the young man who carried the valise
full of ballots to the home of the gentle
man representing Solano County on Ade
line street a_nd received money in return
for them.
Persons who are interested in an honest
government would also like Mr. Fitzger
ald to explain an attempted "hold-up" of
the clearing-house. This establishment,
where the banks settle twice a day the
balances they owe one another, is located
on Sansome street, near Pine. At UM
time Mr. Fitzgerald assumed the duties
of Labor Commissioner some three years
since his office was in an adjoining build
ing. Hundreds of men out of employment
congregated there daily. No trouble was
anticipated from these men, but it was
thought criminals might operate on the
clearing-house under cover of the crowd.
"We were not greatly worried over the
matter," said Manager Charles Sleeper of
the clearing-house yesterday. "One day
however, Mr. Fitzgerald, accompanied by
his deputy, Cleve Dam, called on me ana
offered to move if we paid him $1500, which
he estimated it would cost. This seemed
out of all proportion to the expense in
volved, as he had only a desk and some
chairs in his dingy office. I told him at
the time the clearing-house had no funds
which could be applied to such a purpose.
I recommended him to Bee the managers
of the various banks. He moved his office
soon after. I never learned what success
he met in the matter among the bank
managers."
The outcry against the employment of
Chinese to work on uniforms for volunteer
soldiers afforded Mr. Fitzgerald opportu
nities for -working many schemes. People
â would like him to explain why a certain
firm received a letter that went entirely
outside the bounds of an ordinary busl
.â¢nmmuiiication. It could not have
been issued merely for pleasure nor for
the good of his health.
This letter was signed E. L. Fitz
gerald. Labor Commissioner, and was
couched in terms of most fulsome flat
tery. It was reproduced in fac-simile and
spread broadcast by the firm for whom It
was written. It -was no ordinary busi
ness communication. It was a veritable
word painting, and told of the hundreds
of healthy, well paid women operators
employed by the firm. Mr. Fitzgerald
bore testimony to the fact that only one
per cent of Chinese were employed, and
these only on work that white men would
not do. ThJB was a misstatement, as the
Chinese wore employed as cutters, for
which work many white men are quali
fied. This is but one of many instances
â where the Labor Commissioner has been
able to convert his power into shining
double eagles..
If Mr. Fitzgerald Is elected one of his
attorneys will be Cleve Dam, who has
recently been admitted to the bar. Ho is
best known in Oakland as the promoter
of fake "suit clubs." In these clubs mem
bers pay a certain sum per week and are
entitled to suits according to a drawing.
Before the majority of the members of
the clubs secured their suite the clubs
failed, defrauding men and boys of the
money they paid in. Dam also secured
the indorsement of many prominent men
on notes for hundreds of dollars. He neg
lected to protect the indorsers, who were
compelled to pay the money, which they
have never been able to collect from
Dam.
A MARRIAGE THAT FAILED.
Suit to Recover Or\e j"ivmdred ar\d Fifty
Dollars J^aid for a Husband.
An appeal has been entered In the case of Francisco Rossi vs. Maria
Barablno and Carlo Barabino, which Justice Kerrigan decided in favor of
the defendant on September 15. The case Is interesting, not from a legal
point of view, but from the odd story told by the defendant.
On September 8, 1896. Mrs. Barablno borrowed the sum of $150 from
Rossi. Last December Mrs. Barabino, so runs the story told in the
courtroom, visited Rossi at his home, bringing with her the $150 carefully
wrapped In a handkerchief. The plaintiff's wife took the money and care
fully laid it away. Now comes the odd part of the story.
The Rossis have a daughter, a pretty, black-eyed, rosy-cheeked dam
sel such as only Italy can produce, and like a good father Rossi wanted to
see the girl happily married before the end of his days. Mrs. Barabino
has a son. and the Rossis had long looked upon him as a fitting partner
for their pretty daughter.
The advantages of the match were suggested to Mrs. Barabino. but
she, with the true business instinct of the frugal Italian, would not con
sent to the match without some recompense, and demanded the sum of
$200 for acting as Cupid. This waa too high, but Rossi finally agreed to
give her back the $150, and It was accordingly returned to her, still wrapped
in the handkerchief.
As a Cupid Mrs. Barablno was a success, and the wedding took place
on the 14th of February last. Married life, even with $150 attached to it,
was not a success with the young couple, however, and affairs began to
go wrong. ThÂ«re was a strain of discord throughout the harmony of the
$150 wedding, and finally the young wife sued for divorce, which was

hands and the $150 out of them, and accordingly demanded
that the money bo returned. He met with a prompt refusal. Mrs. Bara
bino said the money had ail gone for the wedding expenses. There were
two white satin dresses; two rings; two pairs of shoes and a gold watch
and chain for the bride, besides a "grand party which cost all of $30." This
bill of expenses did not satisfy Rossi. He had his daughter and thought
the money should have come back with her, and accordingly entered euit
with A. Ruef as his attorney. Justice Kerrigan, after listening to the
story, awarded the case to the defendant. Notice of appeal has been filed.
THE SAT* FRAN CISCO CAI.L, SATITRPAT, OCTOBER 22, 1898.
"NO LOVE, NO LIFE," SAY
ARDENT SWAINS.
One Is Seeking Graves for Two and
the Other Wants Biers for a
Whole Famiiy.
TWO lovelorn swains have
brought themselves within the
reach of the law, and from
pursuing their reluctant sweet
hearts they have become the pur
sued of the police. One is heeled
â with a pistol and a bottle of poison,
the weapon for his love and the
phial for his own benefit, but the
other is more general in his ten
dencies. He swears he will kill the
maiden fair and all her family if
she show r s any further symptoms of
presenting him with the mitten, and
because she believes him she sought
a warrant for his arrest.
Otto Jung, who works for the
To-Kalon Wine Company, Is the
man who preferred poison and a
cold grave to a life unlit by tha
presence of Miss Marguerite Roe
mer. He was engaged to har for a
few brief months, but ten weeks
ago he was rudely jarred into tha
knowledge that he was no longer
indispensable to the young lady's
happiness, and, in fact, that he con
tributed to It materially whÂ«-n he
stayed away. He was away so sel
dom, however, that Miss Roemer
took a trip to San Jose. It was not
a question of mere distance or lo
cation, but the fact that she was
willing to leave him alone that first
prompted Jung to save money fur
poison and lead. He traveled to
Pan Jose fifter her, but was unable
to find her. and on his return home
he confided to a friend that he had
funerals for two in his pocket, and
was only awaiting an opportunity to
show true courtesy by attending to
the lady's demise before he sought
his own. Not appreciating this deli
cacy, the young lady demanded

Developments in the Barron Will
Case Caused the Young Man
to Lead a Life That Broke
His Health.
The evil influence of the ebony skinned
nemesis of Edward Barron, the million
aire, who died four years ago, has driven
another of his blood to an early srave.
George E. I?arron, notorious for the bit
terness of the contest he waged in the
courts of San Jose against the provisions
of his father's will, died in this city ye?Â»
terdey morning at 319 Sutter street, a
victim of quick consumption. The death
of the young man's father left him broken
police protection, and she got it to
the extent of a warrant charging 1
the love-sick Jung with threats to
kill.
With John Charest it was differ
ent. He declared he would provide
biers for his lady love and her
whole family, and nothing should
stop him except the undying and
outspoken affection of the young
lady herself. He worshiped at the
shrine of Miss Inez Lancy, and was
rather demonstrative in testifying to
his esteem, for she says he used to
strike her whenever she displeased
him by undue coldness, and that he
threatened to forcibly "object if ever
she went out with any one besides
himself. He was not the best com
pany in the world. Miss Lancy
thought, but his continual reference
to gunshot wounds and cemeteries
made her afraid of him. and so she
used now and then go out with him
of an evening. She came home
sadly the worse for her walk one
night, and said "Johnny" had b^at
her. That settled it. An aunt, lira.
Barada. advised her to have noth
ing further to do with him. and af
ter offering that kind of advice Mrs.
Biirmia was met at the foot of the
stairs by "Johnny" and waa soundly
thumped for interfering with the
course of his true love. He said
he wouldn't stand it.
Neither would the lady, so Rhe
took her niece to the Police Court,
and together they secured war
rants â one for threats to kill and the
othor for battery. Charest Is a
butcher who works on Saturdays
and spends his time in devising hor
rible deaths for the Lancy family
during the remainder of the week.

as she has use for her existence
she wants "Johnny's" pistol taken

in spirit. When he read his father's will
and found that out of a princely fortune
but the interest on a trust estate cf
$100,000 was to be his share, he became
more depressed, but when a short time
later a stalwart negress, Minnie Morton
by name, declared that the father of hf:r
chilJ was the father of George E. Barron,
to blunt his mind to the disgrace that had
been thrust upon him ha plunged into a
caieer of debauchery that ended with his
death.
Young Barron was never strong in con
stitution, but had he cared for his health
many years hence might have seen him
actively engaged In the pursuits of life.
The disgrace that had befallen him, how
ever, left him without ambition, nour
ished his appetite for liquor, and eventu
ally led him to his grave.
When he died but few were at his bed
side to mourn his death. Among the few
was a woman who bears his name and
who It is said was his legal wife. But
few ever heard that Baron was marne-J,
and many of those doubted the report,
but those who have been Intimately asso
ciated with him for years state that not
over two years ago he went East and re
turned with his wife. The marriage was
secret and It seems was kept a secretj
why, no one seems able to explain.
George E. Barron came Into prominence
In 1895 when hÂ« filed a contest to his
father's will. The young man alleged
undue Influence and unsoundness of mind
on the part of the testator. The case
was tried before Judge I^orlgan In San
Jose, and after a most sensational trial a
decision was handed down sustaining the
contestant and breaking the will. It was
hardly a victory for the contestant, how
ever, as Innumerable technicalities arose
and young Barron eventually came Into
possession of even a smaller amount
than the will of his father stated he
should have. He was forced into ;i com
promise. It is said, by Eve Rose Barron ,
his stepmother, by which he accepted
$50,000 in a trust estate some four or five
months ago. Then signs of Quick con
sumption began to grow upon him. Emi
nent physicians were consulted, but he
was past aid and succumbed to the dread
disease.
During the trial of the case it devel
oped that the young man's father had
been driven to his grave by the Morton
woman. He had paid her thousands of
dollars as a reward for her silence, but
she hounded him until he could no longer
stand the strain; hia health gave way
and he died. Subsequently It was stated
that the death of William Barron, a
brother of the young man who died yes
terday, was indirectly caused by the dls
gra.ee following the expose of the negress.

cated, being graduates of Stonyhurst Col

TWO FRAUDS
SHOWN UP IN
TRUE COLORS
"Francis Truth, Divine
Healer," in Town.
A BRAZEN FAKER EXPOSED
AIDED BY THE BULLETIN IN SE
OUBING VICTIMS.
The Disreputable Sheet Becomes a
Willing Party to the Shameless
Swindle of Poor Un
fortunates.
For some dayÃ past Francis Truth,
"divine healer" and faker of the worst
possible description, has been doing a
thriving business at 440 Geary street in >
gulling the unwary with the assistance
of that greatest of all fakers, the Evening
Bulletin.
Truth, as he calls himself, has a most
unsavory reputation throughout thÂ«
United States, but the present is the first
visit he has Inflicted upon San Francisco.
He first made his presence known when
he called at the business office of The
Call a few days ago and endeavored to
secure the insertion of an advertisement
prepared in the foltm of a reading notice, I
and about a half column in length. The
advertisement was rejected, although the
fellow offered to pay liberally for its
publication. He produced a scrapbook
containing a number of notices from
Eastern papers of his powers, all of I
which bore unmistakable evidences of j
having been paid for. One of these was ''
accompanied by a rude drawing supposed
to represent the death and burial of
Francis Schlatter, tuiother faker, in Ari
zona a few years ago. Notwithstanding '
this, and the further fact that Schlatter's
death wav recorded in all the daily payers !
at the time, the advertisement offered by !
Truth clearly stated that the defunct
faker Is here with Truth, who in his
scrapbook article claimed to have been
with Schlatter at the time of his death,
and buried him In the wilda of Arizona.
It is probable that Truth offered his
alluring "ad" to the other reputable
papers; if he did. they, like The Call, re
fused to print it on any terms. Not so
with the Bulletin, however, for last
Thursday evening that disreputable sheet
came out with the same stuff that had
been rejected by The Call. It was cun
ningly prepared, too, and well calculated
to deceive the average newspaper reader,
who knows little aDout "style," "type"
and such eÃentiais of a newspaper make
up, and while an experienced printer
would detect it as a paid advertisement
the casual reader would accept it as a
nt-ws item. Large headlines made this
announcement:
"Frauds Sehlatter and Friend Truth
here in our midst healing with Clod's
power the sick. They ask no money and
expect none, looking for their reward
hereafter. They desire to live quietly,
treating some, and praying and fasting,
but turn none away."
Two Call reporters paid a visit to
Truth at 440 Geary street yesterday. One !
went as a patient to be treated for imag- ,
lnary stomach trouble; the other In
search of a news story. Truth's abode is
on the second floor, "Mrs." Truth., or a
young and rather good-looking girl, open
ing the door to all comers. The would
be patient asked for Sehlatter, and was
told by the wife that he was not In Just
then, but that Truth would be pleased to
see him. The patient was shown into the
front room, which was scantily furnished,
the walls being adorned with prints of
the Savior and cards bearing passages
of Scripture. When the patient was tin
ally summoned into Truth's office he
told the "healer" that only a few articles
of diet agreed with him, his stomach be
ing in such bad shape. Truth said a
few treatments would help the sufferer
so he could eat anything. Then the sub
ject of compensation was broached.
"Truth" said he charged nothing for his
services, but accepted such contributions
as his patients saw fit to make. He had,
however, some handkerchiefs which he
had blessed, and in consequence they pos
sessed wonderful healing powers. One of
these handkerchiefs would cost 25 cents,
and he insisted that his patients carry one
with them night and day. Truth pro
duced a small red bandana that cost orig
inally about 5 cents a dozen, and the re
porter separated himself from a quarter,
which "Truth" stowed away in his pock
ets. Then the "healer" took the patient's
hand in his own right palm, placing his
left hand on the patient's neck. There
was a convulsive shiver or two, and the
treatment was over. The patient was ad
vised to call every day, anti the next vic
tim was called.
When it came the second reporter's turn
and the nature of his business set forth,
"Truth" dropped his mask of hypocrisy at
once and proceeded straight to the point.
He produced the scrapbook, in which he
asked the reporter to read while he treat
ed another patient. Turning to the arti
cle picturing and detailing Schlatter's
death, "Truth" explained that the Bul
letin article was a mistake, as Sehlatter
was really in his grave. The reporter
took the book, and found by comparison
that the Bulletin article was identical
with that In the scrapbook. only that tne
account of Schlatter's wanderings and
death had been eliminated and a few
changes made to suit the locality.
When the interview with "Truth" was
resumed, that individual frankly stated
that such an article as proposed would
do him much good, and he would like it
as sensational as possible. If the report
er would get up a good, "spicy" article,
"Truth" would make it an object for
him.
Still, "Truth." in his Bulletin advertise
ment, states that he merely wants to live
quietly and makes no charge for his treat
ment of the suffering. Evidently he does
a brisk trade in bandana handkerchiefs.
And it is such a fraud that the Bulletin
has helped to swindle poor deluded suf
ferers. ______________

Naturally, the current Wasp is largely
devoted to politics, and the keen fashion
in which it shows up the pretense of the

the camp of the One Hundred. The com

are particularly good. One cartoon is a

gating.
Mrs. Abrams of 2818 McAllister street
mourns the loss of diamonds valued at
$500, which were stolen from her under
the most peculiar circumstances. Seve
raj weeks ago her residence was entered
by burglars, who got away with consid
erable Jewelry and clothing. Thinking
they would return, and determined not
to give them an opportunity to steal her
diamonds, before retiring each evening
she would secrete the precious stones in
the band of her Fedora hat. A few days
ago a collector of old clothes visited her
home and asked her if she had any worn
out garments she desired to sell.
Mrs. Abrams remembered that her hus
band had two old suits of clothes which
he had discarded.. She brought them
forth and showed them to the stranger.
He offered her a few dollars for the gar
ments, which she accepted. The Fedora
hat was hanging on a hook In the hall
way, and as the visitor was about leav
ing the house, he caught a glimpse of it
and anxiously asked Mrs. Abrams if shÂ«
wanted to sell it. As she was tired of
wearing it, and forgetting that her dia
monds were hidden beneath the ribbon
that encircled it, she asited the fellow
how much he would give her for the hat.
A bargain was promptly struck and tne
stranger left the house with the hat ana
its precious contents. . A . ââ
