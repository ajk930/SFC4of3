EpÂ»clal Correspondence of The Call.
MANILA. Aug. . 28.â The â¢ town Is in
peaceful possession -f the American
1 army of occupation, policed' by the
troops and as orderly as any city in the
United States would be under similar
conditionsâ and yet there is, in all cir
cles, an undercurrent of uneasiness I
which may, or may not, have basis in
fact. So far as I have been able to
gather," Aguinaldo is a man who, hold
ing a certain purchasable influence,
holds also too wholesome a respect for
American arms to put his price too
high. He wants to be bought off.-Pos
filily he realizes that the Americans,
under certain conditions, would rather i
buy him off than go to the trouble of j
suppressing him even with the cer- j
tainty of success in the effort. It would !
be a fine thing; for example. If the !
...Anr^ricHa ,Â£&mm!?sloners, when . .<- they -

could aesert with truth the complete
pacification of . the Philippinesâ con
dition Spain has not been able to bring j
about for 300 years. All this Is probably j
perfectly well known to Aguinaldo. â¢At i
the same time he hesitates to open the i
matter of the sale, lest he appear too
eager and so be compelled to go cheap
ly. You will observe that it is a deli
cate position for a statesman of price.
The Americans are in a surer posi
tion, although it is one of scarcely less
difficulty. General Merritt has the
game in his hands, whether it be for
war or purchase, and knows it. Never
theless, it is no part of his policy to
provoke the Tagallos. It is so little a
part of his policy that the newspaper
correspondents . here for several weeks
past have been allowed to send out
nothing whatever that would reflect in
. any way upon the conduct of the black
â  devils who are born disturbers of na
tional peace, nor upon the inharmon
i ous relations we all know to subsist
between the Dictator-President of the
Governor of ; the. Philippines and the
.-American military government. It has
all been one of those anomalous situa
tions about which the least said soon
est mended. Yet, despite the. firm grasp
of General Merritt upon affaire here,
and it is a firm grasp; despite the con
dition precedent upon which the Span
ish Governor General consented to give
up his city with only a show of resist
ance to the effect that rebels with arms
should not be allowed to come into
Manila; despite. the admitted fact that
all who have so tried to come in on the
regular roads or by the river have been
disarmed; Agulnaldo has not been
pacified, rebels with arms have
Bneaked in through the by-ways, and
there have been some u^ly " instances
lately of the Tagallp disposition to go
on making trouble for the Americans
as they had made it for the Spaniardsâ
not much trouble, possibly, but much
as they could. They have, for example,
instituted the pleasant practice of r ex
torting blackmail from residents of the
city, Spanish residents/who can be
cajoled or , threatened into . payment.
For this purpose : patrol â¢ parties, with
out arms, are sent all. through the resi
dence districts holding . ; passes from
rebel commanders in the field. Colonel
Smith, as provost marshal, has already
taken several of these . passes from
patrol parties arrested incidentally for
other â  devilment. ' 'ihe patrol, ? need
less to say, ia difficult to catch. All na
tives look alike, to Americans, and it
is only luck â  that these passes .; have
been found and the patrol system :of
the rebels discovered. â¢ . , . : . - :'.
It is believed' that the city Is as
thoroughly policed almost by therebels
as by the Arr.ericafsâ but the system
is different. If the fountain head is
ever found, however, a way, will be de
veloped to cut off this little ; source of
annoyance. The black rascals have
also developed an unpleasant habit of
kidnaping men. or the wives" of men
who are obnoxious to them, spiriting
them away into the country; and there
subjecting them to murder or to name
less treatment : not so pleasant. 4 The\
i Lieutenant" Governor of the i district of
P.amboras vanished from the , sight of
-rmen'.'-the. other day and . since then
neither his friends nor the provost has
been : able to get : track of him. WlOn 1
Friday a band of insurgents entered the
house of a Spanish resident of the dis
"' trict of San , Sebastian during his ; ab
sence and by force carried off the man's '
wife and a small child, leaving a baby
four months old in the place.' The pos-*
sible fate .of '- the :, woman is a thing one
would rather not speculate upon. \ Yes
terday " there were 5 brought , before Col
onelSmith seven black-browed Tagal
los who had been caught in, broad day
on a busy street' In 't the district of San
Sebastian ; dragging away a Spaniard,
bound with ropes & and gagged, whom
they â¢ openly : asserted they intended o '
take out of the city and kill as a i spy. |

mura, as It is called here â and will bear |
to his grave the marks of the rope thÂ« ,
bandits tied about his body. Lastly
there was *hat little affair at Cavite
on Thursday night, when one poor sol
dier boy was killed and another re
ceived wounds from which he died two
days later merely because they had ob
jected to taking wrong change from
a native shop-keeper, when the troops
were called out, when a volley was ex- ;
changed between Aguinaldo's men and
OUT own and when it looked as though I
civil war had really begun. It is true,
as the cable has told you, that Agui
naldo sent to General Merritt a prompt
disavowal of the whole affair early the
next morning and that the native offi
cer In command denies that he gave
the order to fire, placing the onus of
murder upon t'..e soldiers, nevertheless
there is a shrewd suspicion that the
dictator-president rather wished to be
gin the trouble at Cavite. where the
Americans are weaker than ..t Manila I
and where great quantities of military !
supplier are stored.
And now one mat and most signifi- |
cant incident going to ohow thÂ« real |
disposition of the native leaders. They
are such great liars, it should be pre- ;
mised, it is difficult to find out exactly
what they mean to do under any given ,
set of circumstances. .Yesterday Father â 
Dohert,y, General Merritt's chaplain,
and Father McKinnon, chaplain of ths
First California Regiment, paid a visit |
of semi-state to Aguinaldo at Bakoor, j
where he still has his headquarters. ;
They were not sent, as I am given to S
understand, as official envoys. Never- j
theless, official knowledge of their visit
existed and it was deemed that they
would be able to impress the dictator
president of the advisability of a gen
eral disarmament. Aguinaldo received
them, a courtesy he extends to but
few people, and made fair promises of
his desire to dwell in unity with the i
Americans. He said, however, that he
must of necessity consult hia Cabinet
before taking final action. The farce
of consulting a Cabinet of his own crea
tures is a trick, by the way, worthy of
an American politician. And. In the
face of the fair promises of the rebel
general, one of his advisers told Father
McKinnon, as the chaplain informs nif>,
that it was the intention of the rebel
leader to remove his official residence
on Monday from Bakoor, where he is
between the American forces at Cavite
and at Manila, to Malolos, at the eni
of the only railroad line on the islands,
where he will lose the prestige of his
own immediate clan about Bakoor Bay,
to be sure, but where he will be amon-j;
a lot of Tagallos, who have never seen
American troops in action and who
will consequently be more willing to
follow him into the field. In effect, h<?
warns to negotiate from a greater dis
tance. Whether the move will be per
mitted is a question for General Otis,
acting during General Merrill's absence
In Paris, to decide.
Against all this, there is the peace
ful indication that the native are lev
eling the trenches on the south side of
the city, from which the American ap
proach was made, and preparing the
fields once more for cultivation. This,
on consideration, may not be so much
a peaceful indication as it looks. It
may be rather a confirmation of the
story told Father McKinnon to the ef
fect that Aguinaldo intends to remove
the seat of his government to Malolos,
on the north side, abandoning to the
Americans the whole region between
Manila and Caviu>.
Honors continue to be showered upon
the Californians from headciuarters.

TRIED TO KIDNAP
THE ARCHBISHOP
Plot of Rebels to Capture Manila's
Chief Prelate Frustrated
by Troops.
MANILA. Sept. 22.â The schemes of the Spanish clerical party
have divided the Filipinos almost beyond hope of reconciliation. Sun
day, when the Archbishop of Manila went to Goco to administer
tee rite of confirmation, a party of rebels attempted to kidnap the
prelate. The sucess of the plot wu only prevented by the inter
ference of the American soldiers stationed there. The purpose of
the purpose of the kidnapers was to take the Archbishop to Lololos,
where Aguinaldo is holding four Spanish priests as prisoners.
Seven Filipinos were detected yesterday at Santa Ana with
money received from Spanish priests. They were arrested on a
direct order from Aguinaldo, despite the protest of Pio Pilar, com
mander-in-chief of the district. They will be shot to-morrow.
Privates Currier, Dennis and Schultz of the Thirteenth Minne

five men on the sick list.
! Dowager has assumed charge of the Gov
j ernment. She will attend all Cabinet

and approve all edicts before they are is

This is equivalent to a virtual restora

HOT RECEPTION FOR AN
ANGELS CAMP FIREBUG
Several Shots Fired at Him While
Trying to Burn a Printing
Office at Night.
ANGELS CAMP, Sept. 22.â About 11:30
lost night people in the neighborhood of
the Mountain Echo printing office were
aroused by several shots, which proved
to have been fired at a fleeing incendiary
who had attempted to fire the printing
office, owned by Reed "& Hutchinson. It
seems that about a week ago a lot of
burned matches and paper saturated with
coal oil was found stuffed under a corner
of the building and a watch was placed
on the premises.
Charles D..Reed. a son of one of the
proprietors, slept in the office. He was
awakened last night by his dog growling,
and seizing a pistol and opening the door
found the miscreant running from the
scene of his crime. Reed Immediately
grave chase, firing aa he ran. The In
cendiary mounted a stone wall to cut
across the country, when Reed rested
his gun on one arm and fired. As he
did so, the firebug was seen to throw his
arms above his head and fall on the
other side of the wall, but he was up
and running again in a second.
This morning his tracks were followed
for a distance of 900 yards and blood
stains were plainly visible. Hutchinson
believes the attempt was an effort to
even up an old personal grudge.

DEMOCRATS CONTINUE
A CONVENTION FARCE
Nominations Are Made for Assessor, Sheriff,
Auditor and Public Admin
istrator.
E. P. E. Troy Creates a Diversion by Attempting to Lay Bare
Some of the Methods of the Programmersâ Accuses
Charles Fay, the Mayor's Mouthpiece.
Another piece of the programme was ,
bit off and swallowed last night by the
100 honest Democrr who have consti
tuted themselves a nominating conven
tion representing the local Democracy.
There was but one hitch in the work
ing of the nicely oiled machine, and
even this had no effect on the net re
sults, which were the nomination of
candidates for Assessor, Sheriff, Pub
lic Administrator and Auditor. The
break in the monotony of the proceed
ings incident to taking names from the
slate and placing them before the con
vention was furnished by E. P. E. Troy.
He did not approve of the acts of the
programmers and wanted to take the
convention into his confidence. He
made several attempts to do so, but
each time he was choked off by points
of order by either P. H. McCarthy,
Timothy J. Lyons or young Mr. Park
qX Susanville. The gallery attempted
to come to his rescue, and did so far
assist him as to gain him sufficient j
time in which to say that the conven- j
tion was dominated by a "base coterie"
of corrupt politicians.
The expected contest between Dr.
Washington Dodge and E. L. Fitzger
ald for the nomination for the office
of Assessor did not materialize for the
reason that Charles W. Fay, the
Mayor's mouthpiece, and his steering
committee had previously induced Mr.
Fitzgerald to be satisfied with the nom
ination for Public Administrator. It
was the development of this portion of
the programme that brought Mr. Troy
to his feet.
According to the order of business
adopted by the convention the nomina
tion of candidates for Supervisors and
members of the Board of Education
should have bedn taken up last even
lne as soon as the convention was
called to order. The programmers,
however, were fearful that they could
not secure the adoption of the entire
slate where there were so many men to
vote for at one time, so another scheme
was adopted to make the thing easy.
It was agreed that two committees be
appointed and that all candidates for
nominatipn for Supervisor or member
of the Board of Education be flrst sub
mitted to one or the other of these
committees, which are instructed to re
port the names of twelve candidates to
the convention for nomination.
After calling the convention to order
Chairman McGee stated that the first
business in order was the nomination
of a candidate for the unexpired term
! of Superior Court Judge. Judge Rhodes
Borden was given the nomination with
out opposition. George McGillivary then
moved that a committee of five be ap
pointed, to which should be referred
the claims of all candidates for the
i nomination for Supervisor, the commit
j tee to report back to the convention
the names of twelve men to be voted for
!by the convention. With the assistance
â  of young Mr. Park of Susanville, the
I chair explained the ostensible purpose
of the motion to inquiring members. As
members of the committee the chair
named George McGillivary, R. V. Whit
ing, W. A. Murrison, Daniel u'Neil and
Leo Kaufman. A similar motion was
made with reference to the nomination
of candidates, for members of the Board
of Education. On this committee the |
chair appointed W. B. Cope, J. F. |
Cavagnaro, Ben Hawes, Max Popper, ;
Jeremiah Coffee, E. P. E. Troy and M. i
j H. Hernan.
This business having been disposed of
to the satisfaction of the programmers,
the chairman called for nominations for
the office of Assessor. Lewis F. Bying
ton, after having been first reminded by
the lobby that he must deposit $10 with
the secretary, placed Dr. Washington
Dodge in nomination. He referred to
Dr. Dodge's record as a member of the
Board of Supervisors, and declared him
to be a man in whom the people could
place their trust without fear that it
would be betrayed.
It was at the close of Byington's ad
dress that E. P. E. Troy created a di
version. He addressed the chair and
wanted to know if a member of the con
vention would be permitted to criticise
any man who had been placed in nomi
nation.
Troyâ l desire to say that when I
came here as a member of this conven
tion I was free .
Young Mr. Park of Susanville â I rise
to a point of order.
Troy â I did not come here to be led
around by the nose by any one. I pro
pose to tell a few things .
P. H. McCarthyâ J rise to a point of
order.
Troy â I believe that Mayor Phelan
should approve of the candidates for
Supervisor and members of the Board
of Education, but with the other can
didates it is different. The fact is there
is here a base coterie that pretends to
and does control the acts of this .
McCarthy â I rise to a point of order.
Troy â As to the nomination for As
sessor it is well known that E. L. Fitz
gerald has been a candidate for the
nomination .
McCarthy â I demand a ruling on my
point of order. [Hisses from the
lobby.]
Troy â Now that I am coming to the
truth am I to be choked off?
T. J. Lyons â I deny that there is a
corrupt coterie here, and I defy you to,
prove it. I deny it, I say, and I defy
any one to prove it.
The chair â I rule that Mr. McCar
thy's point of order is well taken.
Troyâ Don't you want the truth here?
I was told by a man who pretends to
dictate the acts of this convention that
Fitzgerald had been promised some
thing. Who is the boss of this conven-
Jion? Some time ago when I wanted to
iiave a friend of mine, and a good Dem
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
ocrat, appointed a member of the Com
mittee of One Hundred I was told to
go and see a certain man .
A voice â Name him â give us his
name.
Troy â The man I was told to go and
see was Charles W. Fay. I wanted to
show why ii is that after Dr. Washing
ton Dodge has been placed in nomina
tion no other man dare come forward
and seek the nomination at the hands
of this convention. It appears that I am
not to be permitted to speak.
An appeal was taken from the de
cision on the point of order, and the
chair was sustained. The nominations
were declared closed, and the secretary
was instructed to cast the ballot for
Dr. Dodge.
Nominations for Sheriff were called
for and Max Popper placed Theodore
F. Bonnet in nomination. He paid a
high tribute to Mr. Bonnet's record as
a public official and as a citizen. No
other names being offered, Bonnet was
declared the nominee of the conven
tion.
P. H. McCarthy placed E. L. Fitz
gerald in nomination for Public Ad
ministrator. There was no opposition
and he was declared to be the nominee
of the convention.
John H. Grady was placed in nom
ination for the office of Auditor by
Lewis F. Byington. He was the only
candidate and received the nomination
by acclamation. f
Committees were appointed to find
and escort the nominees to the plat
form. Dr. Dodge was the flrst to ap
pear. He said:
"Mr. Chairmaft and Gentlemen of
the Convention: I desire to thank you
for the compliment you have paid me
in making me your nominee for the re
sponsible office of Assessor. When two
years ago I consented to act as Super
visor at your solicitation I little
thought that my acts while in office
would so merit your approval as to
make me now your logical candidate
! for Assessor.
"I have endeavored to maintain the
principle of doing away with the un
jast taxation of the people. I waive
my personal feelings in this matter
and promise to give my best efforts to
the work of the election. I believe the
city is soon to be freed from the
thraldom and abuses that have been
so much against it during the past two
years.
"I have read the plank in your plat
form containing the pledge regarding
taxation and approve it. I believe
the burden of taxation should be more
generally distributed. I also believe
that all franchises should be taxed at
nearly their approximate value. On
these lines I would go before the peo
ple of this city."
Mr. Bonnet was greeted with great
applause. He spoke as follows: "Mr.
Chairman and Gentlemen of the Con
vention: I thank you for the great
honor you have conferred upon me in
making: me your nominee for the office
of Sheriff. Your committee experienced
difficulty in finding me just now. but
you will have no such complaint to
make during the forthcoming cam
paign. I will make an active campaign.
If elected, as I expect to be, with your
.backing, I promise to carry out the pro
visions of your platform to the letter.
I will do my whole duty and will shirk
none of the responsibilities that attach
to the office."
Mr. Bonnet was followed by E. L.
Fitzgerald, who said:
"I deeply appreeiatie the honor you
have conferred upon\ me to-night. I
naturally expect to be elected, but
whether I am successful or not I will
carry with pride through life the pleas
ant memory of this night's work. If
elected I promise you that I will carry
out the duties of the office as conscien
tiously as I have done that of Labor
Commissioner during my term. I will
so perform my duties that when my
term has expired I can meet my neigh
bors, friends and members of this com
mittee and feel that my work has been
well done.
"In conclusion I would say that if
any member of this committee should
die during my term of office I will ad
minister his estate free of charge."
(Laughter).
John H. frrarly also made a brief ad
dress. He said:
"I assure you I deeply appreciate the
compliment you have just paid me. I
will endeavor to fill the important offlc*
of Auditor with credit to myself, to this
convention and to all the people of this
city and county."
The convention will meet again this
evening.
WILL REFEREE THE FIGHT.
Jack Kitchen of the Acme Club Will
Officiate This Evening.
The president of the National Athletic
Club and the representatives of Frank
McCor.nell and George Green met last
evening in the Baldwin Hotel and agreed
upon Jack Kitchen of the Acme Athletic
<"lul> of Oakland to referee the twenty
round contest .which will be held this
evening In Woodward's Pavilion.
The pugilists will meet at 3 o'clock this
afternoon at the Post-street baths and
weigh in. Green and McConnell must tip
the beam at 1T.2 pounds or less, and "Kid
McFadden and Fred Maynard, who are
matched to box ten rounds, must scale
112 pounds.
The betting on the event of the evening
was even money yesterday, but there was
a pcarcity of coin on the part of the
friend^ of Green, who have been holding
off until the referee was named.
McConnell will have as his attendants
Joe* Reay. Tim McGrath and Frank
Schuler. George Green will be looked
after by Bob McArthur, Frank Foster
and Frank Purcell. Both men are in tip

ADDRESSES IN WHICH ISSUES
ARE REVIEWED.
An Interesting Address By the Next
Governor of California
Receives Unstinted
. . Applause.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, Sept. 22.â The
tide of public support is running
strongly in favor of Henry T. Gage,
the Republican nominee for Governor.
Scenes witnessed in Santa Barbara this
afternoon and evening have convinced
tiie wavering that Gage will get more
than the usual Republican majority in
this county. Mr. Gage, accompanied
by R. G. Waters, Republican nominee
for Congress, N. Blackstock, Republi
can nominee for the State Board of
Equalization, and Frank F. Davis and
"Will A. Harris, eloquent advocates of
the principles represented by the Re
publican party, arrived here on the
noon train from Los Angeles. They
were met at the station by the follow
ing members of the Republican County
Central Committee of Santa Barbara
District: Chairman E. M. Pyle, Secre
tary J. W. Smith, G. C. Welch, E. A.
Rison, O. P. Squier, John Hartnell, J.
M. Holloway, C. H. Rowley and F. A.
Conant.
Mr. Gage was escorted to the Hotel
Mascarel. The reception, -which was In
tended to last only an hour, was pro
longed for two hours. Men came from
work benches in their working clothes,
from the shops, stores and offices and
other places of industrial employment
to grasp the hand of the popular stand
ard-bearer of the true party of progress
and reform.
The appointment for R. J. Waters to
speak here this evening had been maJc:
before the Republican State Central
Committee made out the route for Mr.
Gage. This accounts for the unusual
array of oratorical talent here to-night.
To meet the conditions of the hour the
nominee for Governor determined to
limit his speechmaking to a brief ad
dress at each meeting, the regular and
the overflow. The Congressional nomt
nee decided to adopt the same plan.
Bonfires, anvils, salutes and the music
of the Santa Barbara military band an
nounced that the doors of Armory Hall
were open. In the decoration of the hall
and stage the national colors were dom
inant. Shortly before 8 o'clock the
speakers were escorted from the hotel
to the hall. Before they arrived Armory
Hall was packed to overflowing and
many who came later failed to get ad
misÃlon.
At 8:10 o'clock Henry T. Gage and his
talented orators, escorted by E. M.
Pyle and Senator J. J. Boyce, entered
the hall and were welcomed by an out
burst of applause.
In calling the meeting to order Sena
tor J. J. Boyce, the chairman, made a
brief speech. In which he called the at
tention of the audience to a few of the
salient points of the present campaign.
He said: "We have reasons to rejoice
that what we said in 1896 has proved to
be the truth. We say to you to-night
that the country was never more pros
perous than it Is to-day."
When Mr. Gage was introduced the
applause was prolonged. Mr. Gage said
in part:
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Friends of the sunny south, I am delight
ed, it Is needless to say, to meet you here
to-night, and It was my original purpose
to discuss the issues of this campaign at
considerable length, but owing to the cir
cumstances which have been already ex
plained to you by your honorable chair
man that purpose has been changed, and
therefore my remarks will Indeed be brief.
It would have been a great pleasure to me
to have discussed lengthily the issues of
the hour, but the conditions have deter
mined otherwise. Now, ladies and gentle
men, all political orators, all political
speakers throughout this State, look with
pleasure to the time when they may dis
cuss State affairs in this beautiful city
of Santa Barbaraâ a city of world-wide
fame for its most delightful climate, a
city also with great fame for the high
culture of its charming citizensâ and lae
enthusiasm witnessed hereabouts to
night by such a community iÂ« the highest
and most convincing proof possible for
the triumph of the Republican party in
the coming contest in this locality, and
It Is with pleasure that 1 inform you that
frpm every quarter of this State comes
the pleaÂ«ing intelligence of the indicated
success there as here, and I have no
doubt in the world of the result.
1 have no doubt whatever that the ver
dict of California will be in favor of the
Republican party, because the people are
Impressed with the idea that the Repub
lican party of this day represents law and
order; represents all that Is highest and
noblest in American politics; but I am re
minded by the chairman's remarks that I
must not discuss these propositions In de
tail. They will be left for others, and I
shall not trench upon that rule, but, be
fore leaving this rostrum, I take delight
in publicly thanking the citizens of this
community for the solid delegation which
they sent to Sacramento from Santa Bar
bara County which supported me so loy
ally in ray candidacy, and I take this op
portunity to express my gratitude to the
gentlemen who were delegates there and
mho supported me so generously. And I
desire, at this time, to denounce the cal
umny that Is almost nightly circulated in
this State that the 778 delegates that con
stituted the last Republican State Conven
ion, men coming from the farm, men com
ing from the blacksmith shop, men com
ing from the field, men coming from the
professional walks of life; In fact, com
ing from every walk of life, were domi
nated by corrupt influence. I say I take
pleasure here to-night in denouncing that
calumny. It is beneath a man who as
pires to the high office of Governor of
this State to utter such a statement.
I would not have the temerity nor the
dishonor to Fay that the .gentlemen who
compofed the convention assembled at
Sacramento were a band mt scoundrels
or were dominated by corrupt influonros.
No, never would I make such .an assault
upon common manhood in that manner.
If would be dishonorable. Every Demo
crat, every Populist, every man", woman
and -child in this audience who hears my
voice knows that it would be dishonora
ble for me to assail the integrity of such
a body of men by making such sweeping
charges against them, and it is equally
reprehensible on the part of the gentle
man who heads the Democratic ticket
to say such things of the Republican
convention. I cannot, of course, speak
of the head of the Republican ticket;
that would be Indelicate, but from tho
Lieutenant Governor down I can without
Intrenching upon the rules of propriety
say a few. words In their behalf, and it
is my delight to speak In behalf of those
gentlemen. I say it is proverbial in Cali
fornia Uhat no corporation, no railroad,
nothing could dominate Jacob H. Neff
except the firm desire to discharge his
duties faithfully to tho people, that feel
ing that determination upon his part I
know will ever dominate him. It is a
slander to even Indicate that he could
be made the subservient tool of a cor
poratlon. Honest old Abe was familiar
in Illinois, and Honest Jake Neff is just
as familiar in California, and the respec
tability of the other candidates on the
State ticket without naming each indi
vidual is a sufficient refutation of the
charge nightly made against t-em, with
the obvious purpose of diverting the at
tention of the multitude from the revolu
tionary doctrine of the other party.
(Storm of applause.)
Now, gentlemen, it is proper that I
should say something of myselfâ not to
discuss myself, but to say something to
you which you have a rignt to hear, and
1 now declare that if I should be elected,
and I believe I will be, Governor of this
great State, I shall never be dominated
by railroad influences or by any other
corporation influence whatever. If I am
elected Governor of this State I will give
you an honest, clean, economic, business
like administration, and I .will discharge
my duties to Democrats, to Republicans,
to Populists, to every human being in the
State of California with the best judg
ment God has given me. (Applause.)
Thanking you for your kind attention, and
feeling that under the rule stated by your
chairman I have already taken too
much of your time, I am pleased to com
mit the further exercises of the evening
to abler hands. (Prolonged applause.)
At the conclusion of Mr. Gage's re
marks the chairman Introduced Hon.
R. J. Waters, nominee for Congress,
who made a brief but effective speech.
He gave way to N. Blackstock, the
nominee for Railroad Commissioner,
who spoke with force.
The principal address of the evening
and one which commanded the earn
est attention and appreciation of the
large audience was delivered by Hon.
Frank F. Davis of Los Angeles. Mr.
Davis took up the Populist platform,
and the masterlv manner in which he
handled that product of Popocratic cre
ation kept the audience in roars of
laughter, punctuated by frequent out
bursts of applause. When Mr. Davis
came to a series of Republican declara
tions dwelling upon the achievements
of the American army and navy and
foreshadowing the early construction
of the Nicaragua canal, the audience
responded with cheers.
The overflow meeting at Channel
City Hall, two blocks from the Arm
ory, was largely attended. Mayor
Burke presided. The chief address of
the evening there was delivered by
Hon. Will A. Harris of Los Angeles.
The introduction of Henry T. Gage
was the signal for a great outburst.
His speech responding to the compli
ment was brief. He ascribed the two de
monstrations to the belief of the peo
ple of Santa Barbara that Republican
principles showed triumph In the cam
paign. The meeting was also ad
dressed by Messrs. Waters, Blackstock
and local candidates.
Mr. Gage will speak at Ventura to
morrow night. There he will be joined
by General W. H. L. Barnes.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FMDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1898.
REPUBLICANS
ELECT THEIR
DELEGATES
Heavy Vote Cast at the
Primary.
NO OPPOSITION WAS SHOWN
THE SEVERAL CONVENTIONS
MEET NEXT TUESDAY.
Differences in a Few Districts Were
Satisfactorily Adjusted by the
Arbitrators of the County
Committee.
The primary for the election of dele
gates to the Republican Municipal Judi
cial, Educational and Legislative Nomin
ating Conventions, was held yesterday
and, according to the returns furnished
last night by P. H. Prendei"gast, secre
tary of the Republican County Commit
tee, 10,799 votes were cast. The election
passed off quietly as there was no oppo
sition in any of the assembly districts to
the candidates on the regular ticket. A
few weeks ago it was predicted by some
that there would be opposition in several
of the districts, but the difference* then
existing were speedily and satisfactorily
settled by an arbitration committee, con
sisting of T. D. Riordan, Harry N. Gray,
P. H. Prendergast, Alonzo Davidson and
Andrew Louderback. The committee de
voted over a week to hearing the com
plaints of Republicans, who thought they
were not receiving proper recognition.
Every case called to the attention of the
committee was considered and the dis
putants were brought together to calmly
discuss their real or imaginary wrongs.
In every Instance both sides were willing
to abide by the decision of the committee,
and that the committee acted judiciously
and justly was evidenced yesterday, when
former opponents were found working to
gether in the one cause â that of selecting
delÂ«gatps who will name a clean, straight
Republican ticket.
After the arbitration committee had
concluded its labors, notice was glvt-n
that if any Republicans were still dis
satisfied and desired to place an opposi
tion ticket in the field, the names of their
candidates would be received by Secre
tary Prendergast up to 11 o'clock Wed
nesday morning. Not a ticket nor a name
was offered in opposition.
The following is a list of the delegates
to the several conventions chosen yester

MAYOR PHELAN
DENOUNCES THE
SUPREME COURT
Scored for Not Ousting
the Solid Eight.
TALKS TO THF NONPARTISANS
TELLS OF HIS LABORS DURINQ
HIS ADMINISTRATION.
The Convention Will Make No Fur
ther Nominations Until the
Other Tickets Are
Completed.
Mayor James D. Phelan appeared before
the Citizens' Non-Partisan convention,
last evening, and received a most flat
tering reception by those In attendance.
A short business session was held prior
to the Mayor's arrival, but no nomina
tions were made, it being deemed advis
able to await the action of the other
two conventions. The Non-Partisans have
notified the Republicans that If six of the
twelve Supervisors they nominate are ac
ceptable to the Non-Partisans they will
indorse them.
There was a full attendance of dele
gates when Chairman George K. Pitch
called the convention to order In the hall
of the Academy of Sciences shortly after
8 o'clock.
John E. Quinn offered the following res
olutions, which were unanimously
adopted:
Whereas, It is of the highest Importance to
this city and State that the construction of
the Nicaragua Canal by the National Govern
ment be nut longer delayed; and
Whereas, Its construction will relieve this
city and State of the burden of excessive
freight charges that have crushed every en
terprise in the State during the past thirty
years; therefore, be it
Resolved, That our Senators and Representa
tives be informed that the time has now ar
rived when the citizens of this State expect
some decisive action on the part of their Sen
ators and Representatives at the ensuing ses
sion of Congress.
Resolved, That copies of these resolutions be
duly forwarded to the members of our dele
gation in Congress.
A. S. Holllday presented the following
and it was adopted:
Whereas, The Citizens' Non-partisan party
Is Interested In all that conduces to the Im
provement and enlightenment of the residents
of tbe City and County of San Francisco and
the State of California; be it
Resolved, That we express our hearty appre
ciation of the grandly generous girt of Miss
Cora Jane Flood of this city to the University
of California.
The chairmen of the five standing com
mittees were delegated to secure proper
pledges from the nominees of the con
vention. The request of the committee
on education for the assistance of the
committee on nominations In selecting a
candidate for Superintendent of Schools
was granted.
The committee on nominations reported
that it had been decided not to make any
nominations or recommendations for the
present. A communication was read
from a number of merchants asking the
convention to postpone nominations for
a week and give the other conventions an
opportunity to complete their tickets.
The name of Henry N. Clement was
presented as a candidate for Superior
Judge. Delegates Le Breton, Perkins and
Mahoney ware appointed to request the
Republican county committee and the
Democratic district conventions to have
their respective legislative nominees
pledged to sustain the new charter. In
which case the No^-PartlÃans will not
make any legislative nominations.
After a nnort wait Mayor Flielan ap
peared and was introduced by President
Fitch. The Mayor was given three hearty
cheers, and after bowing his acknowledg
ment began his address. He referred to
the occasion when he appeared before
the same convention nearly iÂ«vo years
ago, and of the assurances of success he
had received from the delegates then.
Reviewing the more important events
of his administration, he spoke of his ef
forts In behalf of the new charter, con
gratulated the members on the success
of their efforts In behalf of that instru
ment. He said he had done all in his
power to. fulfill his pledges to the Non-
Partisans, but he had been badly handi
capped by the majority of tiie Board of
Supervisors.
The Mayor then devoted considerable
time to the recalcitrant members of the
board, particularly to Devany, who had
been indorsed by the Non-Partisans. He
was unsparing in his denunciation of
their methods, and incidentally gave the
Market-street railroad a hard rap. The
suit to oust the board was reviewed at
length, and the Mayor closed with a
scathing denunciation of the Supreme
Court for holding back its decision In that
matter until after the Supervisors had
cleaned up everything in sight.
The convention then adjourned to next
Friday night if the hall can be secured;
if not it will meet Thursday night.
THE RED CROSS
CALLS FOR HELP
MORE COMFORTS NEEDED FOR
THE BOYS IN BLUE.
Willing Workers Are Wanted at 16
Post Street on Monday
Morning.
Over 7000 more of the gallant boys in
blue are to sail for the Philippines. The
orders came suddenly, and preparations
must be hurried. They will need many
things for their comfort and health, and
these things the Red Cross folks are al
ready working over.
A call has been made upon the society
for 5700 more abdominal bandages, and
this number the present working force
cannot turn out. More workers in the
cause are needed, and a call has been Is
sued for the willing ones to meet on
Monday morning at 16 Post street. Any
one who can ply needle and thread or a
pair of scissors is eligible, and will be
gladly welcomed. The material will be
provided.
NEW CATHOLIC EDIFICE.
Sacred Heart Church to Be Solemnly
Dedicated Next Sunday Morning.
The new Sacred Heart church, the Im
posing Catholic edifice which has been in
process o^'erection for the past year or
so, will be solemnly dedicated next Sun
day under the auspices of Archbishop
Riordan.
The ceremony of dedication will com
mence with a solemn high mass at 11
o'clock. The Rev. Father McSweeney of
Oakland will officiate as celebrant. He
will be assisted by Father Powers of
Ldvermore as deacon and Father Brady
as sub-deacon. â¢ The address in honor
and commemoration of the occasion will
be delivered by Father McNally of Oak
land.
Immediately after the celebration of
mass the Archbishop will consecrate the
church and dedicate it to God In the
name and under the patronage of the
Sacred Heart.
The designs of the new church conform
rigidly but gracefully to the Romanesque
order of architecture. The entire work
of designing, planning and building was
In the direct charge and under the im
mediate supervision of Architect T. J.
Welsh. Â«
The foundation of the new building is of
concrete, while the building proper is
constructed and finished in Roman brick
and terra cotta.
The large and extensive basement of the
church will be used by the clergy for the
purpose of appropriate meeting and as
sembly rooms for the different societies of
the church.
The seating capacity of the main church
is 1000, including the galleries on either
side. The cost of the structure, exclusive
of pews, is $48,000. The entire cost will be
about $75,000.
A charitable fair for the purpose of de
fnaying as much of the expense of the
new church as possible will be held at
Armory Hall, commencing October 5.
The Gothic aitar now used in the old
church, the gift of Mrs. Sullivan, will be
erected in the new edifice.
YACHTSMEN TO BUILD.
Corinthians Have Decided to Enlarge
Their Quarters.
A special meeting of the members o
the Corinthian Yacht Club was held laÂ»t
night in Red Men's Hall. 510 Bush street,
to consider the advisability of building
an extension to the boat-house at Tibu
ron. Of the seventy or more small boats
at present belonging to members only
about one-half can find shelter. Designs
providing accommodation for 64 boats in
addition to those for which space is now
provided have been prepared by Havens
& Toepke, and were examined by the
members last night. It was stcted that
estimates of the cost of making the pro
posed additions had been made by various
contractors, and that none of these ex
ceeded $900.
It was unanimously decided to make the
suggested addition, and the board of di
rectors was empowered to borrow what
ever sum of money, not exceeding $1000,
might be necessary.
The present veranda of the club-house
will be extended, and the new boat-house
built out over the water In the direction
of Angel Island. A passageway 15 feet
wide will give access to the new boat
house, and on each side of it there will
be space for a double tier of boats. The
additional veranda space the
boat-house will be very useful at all the
thickly attended entertainments given by
the Tiburon yachtsmen.
VAMPIRES WILL
PLAY FOOTBALL
LOVEBS OF THE ASSOCIATION
GAME OBGANIZE.
Practice Will Begin on the Alameda
Ground as Soon as the Cricket
Season Ends.
At a meeting of the Vampire Associa
tion Football Club held Tuesday the fol
lowing officers were elected for the sea
son of 1898-99: President, T. Turner: vice
presidents, R. B. Hogue, George Theobald
and J. S. Webster; captain, G. T. S.
White; vice captain, J. McGraw; execu
tive committee, Fane Sewell, J. M. Pun
nett, C. P. Coles, T. W. G. Wallace and
J. J. R. Peel; secretary and treasurer, J.
D. Robertson.
The club will play on the "Webster
street grounds of the Alameda Cricket
Club at Alameda, and will pay a small
rental for the privilege of using the
grounds until the end of ..darch, 1899. So
soon as the cricket season is ended the
secretary will Issue notices to the Vam
pires to be present at the first practice
game of the season. The uniform of the
club will consist of a white shirt, with a
black vampire upon the left breast and
a black sash two and a half inches wide
over the right shoulder to the left hip,
black knickerbockers and stockings.
Among the players during the coming
season will be those whose names have
been already mentioned, and the follow
ing new members: C. Rieveley, W. W.
Tomlinson, P. A. Crump, L. G. C. An
derson, L. Chaldecott, F. C. Driffleld, H.
Bowen, G. H. N. Sexton, T. Turner, H.
C. Casidy and several others. Last sea
son the club numbered about twenty-five,
but it is expected that this number will
be considerably exceeded during the com
ing season.
The chief feature of association football
as distinguished from the Rugby or in
ter-oollegiate game Is that no one except
the goal-keeper is permitted to touch the
ball with his hands, the penalty for
handling the ball being a free kick for the
opposite side. The game is consequent
ly a very open and fast one, of which
dribbling is a leading feature. Its votar
ies claim for it that it Is much more gen
uinely football than other forms of the
game in vogue.
Asking for Aid.
An earnest appeal for assistance Is be
ing made by the directors of the San
Francisco Presbyterian' Orphanage and
Farm, which has- its buildings In "â¢' San
Rafael." â --Â£ The num^r of ; homeless
deserted" children - Is* ermntantly increas
ing-, -necessitating > the erection- of new
quarters. .The building: now. being . used
la rapidly -: falling into a state lof Â« decay.
Mrs. Phebe Hearst came to the organiza
tion's assistance with a dqnation jof $1000.
Other smaller amounts "were added, and
twenty u acre?: of : land were secured by
Robert : Dollar at San Anselmo.' As the
land - is > not all paid for the society is
working hard to interest charitably in
clined people to aid it In its good work.
A neatly printed report has been issued
by the 1 society which tells of the good
work ; performed ; and gives, the names of
well-known ladies who have aided the In
stitution or are interested in its welfare.
The Dewey Club.
A large and enthusiastic meeting of the
Dewey Central Republican Club was
held at B'nai B'rith Hall last evening
President P. J. Joyce occupied the chair
and John Choln acted as secretary. The
leading Issues of the day were ably han
dled by the following: speakers: Daniel
A. Ryan, Julius Kahn, P. M. McGushln,
J. M. Stafford, ex-Senator Thomas Kane
and P. J. Wynn.
The following were unanimously rec.
ommended for nominations: County
Clerk, 'William A. Deane: Justice of the
Peace, Daniel A. Ryan; Supervisor Fifth

TRYING TO
BREAK UP
THE PARTY
Dr. Pardee's Enemies
Are at Work.
INDEPENDENTS ARE ACTIVE
MORBOW BESIGNS FROM THE
ALLIANCE.
Fusionists Are Preparing For the
Conventions That Are
to Be Held Next
Saturday.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Sept. 22.
Independent and Non-Partisan "move
ments" are now springing up in all direc
tions. Men who failed of nomination at
the Republican County Convention and
others who withdrew before the prima
ries, and possibly one or two who re
ceived nominations, are all striving to
obtain more recognition, politically, than
they now enjoy.
In connection with these movements
many names are being freely used. It is
known that John A. Beckwith and I. I.
Boak, who was a delegate on the beaten
Leckie ticket in the Seventh Ward, are
actively working toward some end
not yet clearly outlined. Louis Schaffer,
A. K. Grim, Thomas M. Robinson and
Robert Leckie are also identified with the
Independent Non-Partisan ambition. The
present outlook is that harmony brought
about after the Sacramento convention
will soon be dispelled and that there will
be another rupture in the party. When
Dr. Pardee appeared at the County Con
vention, it was taken to mean that a
united campaign would be made, and
when he called for the support of every
name on the ticket from top to bottom,
"from Governor to Constable," no one
expected to hear of independent Repu'o-^
lican movements. The echo of his words
had not died away before the good ad
vice was cast to the winds, and the old
rupture reopened.
President George P. Morrow has re
signed from the Republican Alliance of
Oakland, and a special meeting has been
called for next Monday night to elect his
successor. The resignation of Mr. Mor
row was a surprise to the Alliance, as
the club has done splendid work under its
present president. Mr. Morrow, however,
declares that his resignation must be ac
cepted, as he cannot give the necessary
time to this campaign.
The following resolution was adopted
at the meeting:
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Re
publican Alliance, in special meeting calln.j,
that the alliance enter actively upon the cam
paign of ISPS immediately, and strenuously
work for the election of the Republican candi
dates for Governor and for Congressmen.
The amalgamated political parties are
now busy arranging details and making
up tickets for Saturday's convention. The
â at bone of contention is the parceling
of the offices between the different
ties. Already there are two or three
ididates for each office, and there will
undoubtedly be much dissatisfaction, no
matter how the plums are distributed.
The Silver Republicans will meet Friday
evening at 467 Ninth street to outline
their campaign. A committee will be ap-
Cnted to meet with the Populists and
â nocrats on Saturday and arrange some
n of fusion,
he new Republican County Central
Committee will m^t and organize â 
day Â°(trrnoon. It la probable Uiat A. 11.
.Breed will be the chairman and Clarence
Crowell treasurer.
To-morrow evening the Young Men's
Republican League will open the cam
paign at their hall, 1159 Washington street.
There will be speeches and music.
Sheriff Calvin B. White announces that
he is desirous of securing the renomina
tion of the fusion convention; Treasurer
O. M. Sanford wants to succeed himself,
and Principal T. O. Crawford wants the
Democratic nomination for Superintend
ent of Schools.
Crushed by a Street Car.
. An unknown man was run over and
badly injured by Folsom street car 1097
at Folsom and Beale streets last night.
The man attempted to get out of the way
of an eastbound car, and in doing so was
struck by westbound car 1097. His skull
was fractured and his collarbone, right
arm and almost every rib on the left side
were broken. He was taken to the Har
bor Receiving Hospital, where he died
at 1:30 o'clock this morning. He was be
tween Â£i0 and 60 years of age, and r'rorn
his dress appeared to be a laboring man.

The Mr. Deasy who was hooted at tha

mittee of 100 job-chasers was not Jerome,
but Jeremiah Deasy.SUFFERINGS
OF CALIFORNIA
VOLUNTEERS
Much Illness Among
Troops Quartered at
Manila.
BUT THE BOYS ARE HEROIC
Newly Arrived Recruits Complain
Because the Fighting
Is Over.
BY PRIVATE F. A. HEALY.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
MANILA, Aug. 26. â The cry Is still
they come. A couple of days ago the
fourth expedition came into port, and
now one m*Â»ets on every corner some
familiar face from home that brings
back to him the life of San Francisco.
The recruits are heart-broken at hav
ing arrived too late for the fun, and
<-vt>ry veteran who cares to recount his
experiences in tent and trench can be
sure of an appreciative audience, who
will pay for the drinks as long as the
man of bullets and battles cares to
hold forth. And there is some mighty
tall talking indulged in. No one but
who belongs to the company that car
ried off all the honors of the day can
be found; while the fellow who has not
some thrilling personal adventure to
recount or some deed of exceptional
heroism to boast of is as rare as a
white blackbird. The town is also
rapidly filling up with another species
of animal which was not to be found
around the soldiers when they were in
camp and when the dawning of every
new dxy brought the report of the
casualties of the night and the pros
peci of a new scrap. I mean this place
is now infested by a horde of well
dressed, clean, stylish-looking young
fellows who have sprung up from God
knows where and who, should we have
more trouble, I imagine would melt
into ahqCttrtry with the same mys
terious promptitude with which they
came into evidence. They are for the
most part young fellows of some
wealth, whose families have a pull at
home in one direction or another and
Who have come down here In the capa
city of clerks, attaches to various de
partments, or who do nothing at all
and cover their idleness with a large
bunch of copy paper, which they flash
on the slightest provocation, while they
Inform their awe-struck listener of the
Influence they wield as special Journal
istic war commissioners. These drones
spend the greater portion of their time
in loafing around the beer gardens,
â where they sit and discuss life at the
front. They are heartily despised by
the regular soldier.
Another humorous product of the ex
isting conditions down here Is the
civilian who manages to scrape up an
association with the officers and who
tries to impress on the casual passerby
and the inebriated enlisted man that
he is entitled to the honors that are
only paid to shoulder straps. Many of
these fellows are officers connected
with the transports and have
heretofore never in their lives had
any respect of any sort shown them
save that grudging respect forced from
the brow-beaten cowed sailors under
their command. They strut about the
streets in a uniform as nearly ap
proaching the regulation affair as they
dare to make it, and the self-satisfac
tion and superciliousness of their de
portment would make a member of the
Legislature turn green with envy.
There are also a number of other
parasites of various sorts and condi
tions who are rapidly arriving and who
are all classified by the boys under the
general title of "flubdubs."
There has been considerable illness In
the various regiments, some companies
having as many as twenty men on their
sick reports in a single day. Fortu
nately, these cases are, with a very
few exceptions, not of a serious nature,
consisting for the most part of slight
bowel complaints, sores and boils.
Speaking of this matter of boils and
tores, 1 think that if some one will take
the trouble to carefully search through
the files of prehistoric archives he will
ascertain that Manila was the stamp
ing ground of the only and original
Job, for since we have arrived in
this accursed island there is hardly an
enlisted man in the whole regiment
who, at one time or another, has not
Buffered from an irruption of painful
and disgusting sores which spread over
toe patient's entire body and make him
for the timo being a misery to himself
and an object of repulsive sympathy
to his comrades. And here I wish to
call attention to the heroism of Private
William Osborne who. while in camp,
was attark-rl with this plague In its
most virulent form. He was covered
with soros ;n,d boils from the top of
his head to the bottom of his feet: yet
he was the first to turn out at every
alarm of battle and insisted on stand
ing his guard every time his company
was ordered to the trenches. He would
take off his bandages, don his uniform
and accoutrements and do his duty
with the rest, though when he returned
to camp his body and shoulders would
be little more than a mass of raw,
bleeding flesh. This is courage of the
highest type, but, unfortunately, is a
kind that rarely obtains the mention it
deserves. Naturally, those who read
this will be somewhat Interested in
knowing what are the facilities and
accommodations afforded the represent
atives of the Red Cross Society and
what' the care and attention paid to
the volunteer really amounts to. Un
fortunately. I must remain silent when
it comes to speaking of our hospital
corps. You sec, lam an enlisted man
and it is not seemly for me to criti
cize my superiors. However, there
will be an afttrmath to all this and
then things will be portrayed as they
really were in the Philippines. There
are four men Tr^e, however, of whom
I can speak, whose names are in the
mouths of all ftnd who have obtained
the well earned praise that their gal
lantry deserves. They are Major Hugh
T. Sime of the Second Battalion, Cap
tain Eggert of L Company and Lieu
tenants Curzons and Adler. I have
spoken of these gentlemen before, but
I think If the foreigner* down here can
I find pleasure In speaking of them ev-
I ery hour in the day nnd If the Span
| iards themselves can continually praise
their gallantry the people of their na
! tive city can afford to read of them
I more than once. They are the men
! who, with Major Sime at their head,
j led the whole army and never once
I faltered until they stood under the an-
I cient walls of Manila, atop of which
floated the pallid signal of surrender.
The one question that is continually
being asked down here is: "Will we
have a scrap with the Filipinos?" Some
Bay yes and some say no. If It were
| left to the rank and file it would be
!on ere this. The new arrivals long for
; it for they burn for a chance to dis
: tinguish themselves. The old boys have
! the memories of past Inhospitable treat
ment to stir them up and make them
crave one hour in which to square
things. I think wj will get our chance.
We have several times since the sur
render been on the verge of a mix up
with our former allies and from re
liable information I have obtained, but
which I am not at liberty to divulge,
I learn that even as I write prepara
tions are going on which anticipate
even more serious fighting than that
we have already passed through. If
it does come I hope these savages will
stand long enough to allow the Frisco
boys to get to work with the bayonet.
If they do they will get a taste of fight
ing such as they have not experienced
during the whole four hundred years of
Spanish occupation.
The other night a drunken riot oc
curred between some men of the Fourth
Cavalry, stationed at Cavite and the
Insurgents. One of the cavalrymen
was killed, but his name is not allowed
to be made public.
There is considerable discussion going
on concerning the amount of expense,
trouble and loss of life that will ensue
when the United States Government
tries to police the whole of this island,
if it decides to hold it.
The soil down here is the best in the
world and the fecundity of the entire
place Is such as to fit it for most any
sort of agricultural enterprise. Let the
Government throw the island open for
settlement and a swarm of American
frontiersmen and hardy adventurers
will flock down here. Each man will
bring his Winchester and will look
after the safety of his own sugar cane
patch and I will guarantee that tht
policing of the island will be rapidly
and thoroughly accomplished. With
the arrival of the fourth expedition
came a large assortment of wines and
liquors, a present from John D. Siebe
to the First Regiment. Delicacies of
any sort are very rare down here at
present and Mr. Siebe's thoughtful
kindness is much appreciated by the
regiment. It is a pity that his exam
ple is not followed by a few of thop. at
home who have made money out of this
affair.
We are now comfortably quartered in
: barracks stretching along the banks of
the Pasig River. The boys are allowed
I liberty all day long If they have not
) duty to perform. They go and come
!to and from town as they please. No
! restriction is placed upon their ac
tions, and it speaks pretty well for the
i regiment that no case of aggravated
! disorder has yet been reported. Colonel
: Smith has been made a marshal and
placed in charge of the San Miguel
i district. He tries civil as well as mill
! tary cases, and is forced to listen to
â  every complaint, and they are many,
that arises in the territory over which
Ihe holds sway. He is possibly the
hardest worked man in the entire regl
i ment, but, in spite of his responsibili
ties, which include questions of life
i and death, he seems to be happy, and
i pursues the uneven tenor of his way,
1 Increasing dally in grace, wisdom and
j avoirdupois.
Father McKlnnon has entirely re
i covered from his wounded foot and
' from the wound he received in his coat
[ from a Spanish bullet, and now holds
'â â  forth in the San Miguel church on
Sundays, while on week days he occu
' pies himself In a thousand little acts of
i kindness, looking toward the comfort
â  and convenience of his boys. There is
a comical adventure in which Father
McKinnon and a brother priest are the
central figures, which I will save for
the subject of one of the many special
stories I intend to inflict on the San
Francisco public at a later date.
This place is indeed the land of sun
! sets. I have seen many in many parts
of the world, but nothing to compare
with what we get down here. Every
evening at about 6 o'clock the whole
sky is illuminated, and the horizon Is
resplendent with variegated colors un
' til it looks like the path of love wind-
Ing Into the garden of delights. Un
: fortunately the somewhat soiled and
! frayed soldier who gazes upon it has
! no one to share his admiration of the
' scene nor to respond to the tender sen
â  tlments it calls forth. If he loses hlm
; self for a moment In romantic contem
| plation of the scene he is speedily
I brought back to earth by the harsh
voice of the sergeant sternly command
: ing him to fall In for retreat, and pro
j fanely informing him of the dlscom
fort that will be his if he fail to In
stantly obey. However, if the sunsets
. of Manila beat those of San Francisco,
I yet the electric lights of the latte
place are very bright and twice as
pleasant to wander under when there
are two In the crowd.
Save for the illnesses I have already
spoken of, the regimental health is ex
cellent, though. I am sorry to say, that
since that bloody dawning of the first
day of August I can never again write
that all the brave boys who were
cheered as they marched along the
streets of 'Frisco are well and waiting
for the caresses with which they will
be welcomed home. There are some,
alas, whose cold lips will never again
respond to the affection which now
weeps for them seven thousand miles
away from where the palms and orange
blossoms shadow their lonely soldier
graves.
CAPTAIN DASHER OF
THE SIXTH DENOUNCED
Serious Charges Made by Company
A, Now on Furlough at
Stockton.
STOCKTON. Sept. 22.â Some soldiers of
Company A, Sixth California Regiment,
j stationed at Â«.lcatraz, but home on
I furlough, are most bitter in denunciation
â¢ of Captain Dasher of the company, and
! propose to try to have him court-mar
) tialed for falling to pans certain written
applications made by them up to the
i proper authority. It is said that one of
i the privates went to Dasher and asked
! him fer a furlough to go to his home in
â  San JoÃe. where his child was dying. The
I request was promptly refused and when
the letter telling of the condition of the
child was shown to the captain he was
even so rude, it is said, ae to throw it on
the floor.
Many of the 106 men In the company
have presented requests to be transferred
to other companies, but the captain, is
reported to have torn them in pieces.
1 This is a violation of the rules, as such
communications should be forwarded to
the adjutant. One of the men whbse
requeet was torn up has decided to carry
the matter to headquarters. Many re
quests for furlough have been refused by
Dasher when, it is claimed, the reten
tion of the men with the company was
entirely unnecessary. It is said that sev
eral chastisements have been promised
the captain when the men meet him in
civil life again.

GREENE BRINGS
REPORTS FROM
WESLEY MERRITT
Official Accounts of
Work in Manila.
BRAVERY OF THE VOLUNTEERS
CALIFORNIANS WEBE IN THE
THICKEST OF THE FIGHT.
Officers Express Surprise at the Or
ders to Send More Troopa
to the Philip
pines.
Major General Francis V. Greene, who
left here in command of the second de
tachment of the expeditionary forces for
the Philippines, returned on the steamer
China yesterday. When he went away he
was a brigadier general, and was ad
vanced to the present rank for gallantry,
upon the request of General Wesley Mer
ritt.
General Greene is the custodian of thÂ©
offlciai report of General Merrltt, upon all
that has taken place in the Philippines
since the American troops landed there.
It was brought here by Adjutant General
Babcock, and will be presented to the
army officials at Washington. General
Greene spoke freely of the troops and
their fighting qualities, but declined to
discuss the politics of the islands.
"The troops at Manila have behaved
magnificently in the actions in which they
have taken part," said General Greene
yesterday. "The First California Regi
ment was a part of my brigade and made
a splendid showing. Colonel Smith and
his men fought bravely, as we knew they
would. Poor Captain Richter was the
only officer killed when the troops were
going forward to reinforce the men In
the trenches.
"My brigade went ashore July 17. We
went into camp at once and occupied the
trenches under desperate conditions as to
weather. We were attacked four times
by the Spaniards, and drove them back
each time. General MacArthur came on
August 9 and reinforced us. On the 13th
we attacked the city of Manila and cap
tured it. The navy bombarded the city
for half an hour, after which we ad
vanced. In my brigade was the Utah
Battery, while the Astor Battery did
yeoman duty for General MacArthur.
"We took the Spanish line and entered
the city, which was surrendered that af
ternoon. This was supplemented by a
formal capitulation on the following day.
Our loss was only twenty-three killed
and 103 wounded. With 8500 we took 13,000
prisoners. With them we captured 22.000
guns and 10.000,000 rounds of ammunition.
"The conditions throughout were of the
worst possible character. It rained con
tinuously for three weeks. During tnis
time the men in camp had only shelter
tents, while those in the trenches had no
protection. The tents were pitched on
bamboo beds elevated eight inches from
the ground to keep out the moisture. At
first the men spent one day in every four
in the trenches, and later, when affairs
reached a crisis, they were there one day
in three. .Each man served twenty-four
hours without relief.
"The country presents almost unsur
mountable difficulties for military opera
tions. There were rice swamps, gardens,
bamboo thickets and other obstacles to
overcome. There are but few roads ond
those are Impassable. General Mac-
Arthur was through the civil war, but he
says he never saw such a place in which
to carry on warfare,
â¢â¢ThrouÃhout it all %â¦Â»Â» conduct of the
troops was admirable. Althougn romii
tiona were bad there was no complaint.
They were in good spirits, there was no
despondency and no sickness.
"The troops are all in the former bar
racks of the Spaniards and In barracks
made out of private houses. The Span
ish prisoners are confined in the
cathedrals, churches and convents.
"I wish to commend the work of Gerald
Rathbone. nephew of Major Rathbone.
He is well known in this city. He was
my volunteer aid during all the fighting
before Manila and acted gallantly
throughout. I mentioned him in my re
port. He preferred to remain behind
when I left and connected himself with
another command."
On being asked as to his candidacy for
the Governorship of New York and regard
ing his strained relations with General
Merritt, lie laughingly Bald it was all
news to him.
"I left General Merrltt at Hongkong on
the most friendly terms of intimacy. I
knew he had reeomended my advance
ment to be major general, but did not
know that I had been promoted. There
was no unpleasantness between us and I
cannot account for the stories that have
gained credence here. lam under orders
to report at Washington and have no idea
as to what the future may hold for me.
"As to my candidacy for the Governor
ship, I am equally at a loss to know
where it originated. Colonel Roosevelt,
who, I am told, is a candidate, is a life
long friend of mine and our politics are
the same. The matter should not be
treated seriously.
"The report of any difference with Cap
tain Seabury of tÂ«Â»e China on the trip
out was equally without foundation.
"I left General Merritt at Hongkong.
He started west over the Red Sea for
Europe, where he is due October 2 to ap
pear before the Peace Commission."
General Greene, in common with other
officers, was surprised at the order
sending more troops to tne Philippines.
Before leaving General Merritt enbled
that he required no more. Those now un
der orders to go make the tntal number
of men assigned to the Philippines 21.000.
This is the force that was originally in
tended for the occupancy of the islands.

WEATHERED THE HURRICANE.
Steamer Eastern Prince Tells of the
Storm in the West Indies.
NEW YORK, Sept. 22.â The Prince Line
steamer Eastern Prince, which arrived
to-day from Brazilian ports, encountered
the hurricane which devastated St. Vin
cent and other West Indian islands on
September 10.* The Eastern Prince was
then off Barbadoes. The hurricane blew
with terrific fury for nearly three days,
its center passing south of Barbadoes and
moving northwest by west. At Bt. Lucia,
although quite severe, it did not cause
any great amount of damage or loss of
life. One or two landslides took place,
several houses were blown down and a
few persons were reported killed.

Senor Aponcillo Is a lawyer of Manila

He has been the confidential depository

A JURY SECURED
TO TRY WIDBER
HOSMJ2B WAS KIND TO THE AC
CUSED MAN.
In His Opening Statement He Re
frained From Alluding to the
Ex-Treasurer's Fast
Life.
A Jury was secured in Judge Cook's
court yesterday to decide the guilt of ex-
Treasurer Widber, who is charged with
embezzlement and misappropriating the
funds intrusted to his care while he was
serving in an official capacity. The fol
lowing were the twelve citizens chosen:
W. E. Lovejoy, 123 Bernard street; W. W.
Griffin, 1009 Florida; R. Mehrtens, 100

not unkind to the accused man. He told

Save the Drunkardâ A Trial Package of
a Marvelous Home Remedy Mailed

Can Be Given in Tea, Coffee or Food, Thus Absolutely and
Secretly Curing the Patient in a Short Time
Without His Knowledge.
There la a cur* for Drunkenness that haa
shed a radiance into thousands of hitherto deso-
late firesides. It does Its work so silently and
surely that while the devoted wife, sister or
dnughter looks on the drunkard Is reclaimed
even against his will and without his knowledge
or co-operation. The discoverer of this grand
remedy, Dr. Haincs, will send a sample of the
remedy free to all who will write for it
Knough of the remedy Is mailed free to show
how it is used in tea, coffee or food, and that
it will cure the dreaded habit quietly and per-
manently. , _ _
Mrs John M. Hatton. a lady residing in Le-
banon, 0., used the remedy as described above,
and her experience, told in her own words,
will quite likely Interest all women deeply.
Mrs. Hatton says: Yes, I used Golden Specific
without my husband's knowledge and com-
pletely cured him.
He was a hard drinker, a good man when
xober, but for years I lived In fear and drend,
Khnme and despair, poverty and disgrace. How
shall I toll other women about It? Is it not
a wonderful thing that a woman can take mat-
ters In her own hands and stamp out this
dreadful curse to the home? I am glad you are
going to publish my experience, for then I
know It will reach hundreds of other poor souls,
and they will cure their husbands Just as I
cured mine. I am so grateful for the marvel-
ous changes that have come into my life that
I Just feel like I would do anything to let
every wife and mother know what a bleeslng

â¢^Whether we will ask for independence
or a protectorate from the United States
I am unable to say. Of course, I think
that Aguinaldo and his followers would
be pleased with independence, yet I can
not say that it will be asked for. When
we reach Washington an effort will be
made to see President McKlnley and con
fer with him.
"We do not know whether or not we
will go to the Peace Commission at Paris.
This will also depend upon the instruc
tions we are to receive at Washington by
cablfgraph. If Asulnaldo wishes us to go
to Paris, why, we will go and present our
claims. No," what they will be I cannot
say. Everything will depend upon our in
structions, which we are to receive at
Washington. You see, it will then be four
weeks since we left the Philippine Islands,
and the condition of affairs may have
altered considerably since that time.
Agulnaldo is pur principal, and his wishes
must be followed out In detail."
Major General Greene was In close con
ference with the representatives of tae
insurgents numberless times during the
trip from Manila to this city. He is very
friendly with them, and they seem to de
pend upon him for suggestions. General

the vaults were inspected. Sacks that
were supposed to contain $5000 in gold
were found to hold only $2T>O in silver,
and in this and other ways the sum taken
by the accused man amounted to $76,242.
Hosmer did not allude to the fast life
the ex-Treasurer had been living and to
how the money stolen had been squan

Registrar Biggy was put on the wit

RUMORED
DEATH OF AN
EMPEROR
China's Ruler Subject
of Some Alarming
Gossip,
DOWAGER EMPRESS REIGNS
Li Hung Chang Is in Power
and Russian Influence j
Is Increased,
Bpeelal Dispatch to ThA Call.
SHANGHAI, Sept. 22.â A local rumor
is current here to tho effect that the Em
peror of China is dead. No details are
obtainable, but it is said that the gates
of .Peking are closed.
PEKING, Sept. 22.â An imperial edict
Just issued definitely announces that
the Emperor of China has resigned his
power to the Empress Dowager, who
has ordered the Ministers to deliver to
her in future their official reports.
It is difficult to obtain reliable infor
mation at the palace in regard to the
proceedings, but the recent reformatory
edicts probably caused the change.
While the Emperor was subservient
and a mere figurehead, the Dowager
Empress allowed him to reign in
peace, but as soon as he attempted to
act on his own initiative his practical
deposition was the result. Hia princi
pal adviser, Kang Yumoi, the Cantonese
reformer, fled in spite of thÂ« vigorous
attempt made to arrest him, and it is
eaid he is now on his way to Shanghai.
The effect of the change must be
grreat. In all probability Li Hung
Chang will be reinstated in power and
Russian influence will increase. The
hopes of reform so ardently cherished
by the intelligent factions of the Chi
nese are now impossible of fulfillment.
The suddenness of the coup is said
to be due to the desire of the Dowager
Kmprees to prevent the mission of the
Marquis Ito from being successful. The
Japanese statesman recently came to
Peking with the object of trying to
bring about an alliance, offensive and
defensive, between Japan and China,
The new order of things will undoubt
edly prejudice British Interests In
China.
It is reported to-day that the next
edict will give the full reason for the
change. The wording of the present
edict is not yet obtainable, but it is
to the effect that the Emperor re
quested the Dowager Empress to as
sume power, this being the third time
the request has been made.
The Marquis Ito, in an interview be
fore the edict was issued, said the
Emperor received him yesterday in the
most cordial manner, and said he hoped
to have the advantage of the advice
of the Marquis in the reforms which
his Majesty intended to undertake. The
Marquis, even then, feared that the
inaction and conservatism of the Chi
nese officials would nullify the reforms,
although he. believed the Emperor was
acting in good faith.
REMAINS IDENTIFIED
BY THE RELATIVES
Miss Emma Oill the Victim of the
Sensational Bridgeport
Murder.
BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Sept. 22.â At an
inquest held this afternoon by Coroner
Dolen it was fully established by rela
tives of Miss Emma Gill of Southington
that the body found in Yellow Millpond
was hers. Her father and three brothers
fully identified the remains, and the
Coroner has issued an order permitting
the body to be exhumed and taken to
Southington for interment.
Undertaker Curtis of Stratford denies
that Charles A.. Plumb of that town, now
under arrest for complicity in the crime,
has had the use of any wagon or team
owned by him for the last three months.
Plumb is still in custody, but what evi
dence the police have to connect him with
the crime they refuse to divulge.
Late this afternoon the police arrested
Harry Guilford, son of Dr. tstancyt $tancy Gull
foxd, aB he was attempting *to enter the
residence of his mother. Superintendent
Birmingham refuses absolutely to say a
word concerning the case. y
Pears*
What is wanted of soap
for the skin is to wash it
clean and not hurt it.
Pure soap does that. This
is why we want pure soap;
and when we say pure,
we mean without alkali.
Pears' is pure; no free
alkali. There are a thou-
sand virtues of soap; this
one is enough. You can
trusi a soap that has no
biting alkali in it.
All sorts of stores sell it, especially
druggists; all sorts of people use it.
TO CONNECT WITH
THE VALLEY ROAD
Buildirjg of the LinK That Mear>s
a New TraoscontineQtal
Lioe.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 22.â 1t Is generally regarded here that the
. statement made by E. Woltman, the representative of Kessler & Co.
of New York, as to the early construction of the Salt Lake road means
that a link of 481 miles of track wijl be built, which will bring Los
Angeles to a connection with the Union Pacific at Melford, Utah, and
give Southern California another transcontinental line. As to the
ability of Kessler & Co. to finance the proposition there can be no
doubt. The firm has been in existence 237 years. Its principal office
is at Frankfort, Germany. It has branches at all European financial
centers, and has had a branch in New York City since 1837. It
handles German capital largely, and its investments have been of the
most conservative character. It has handled enterprises in South
America and in Canada which called for many millions of dollars. Its
attention was first directed to Southern California as a field of in
vestment by purchasing bonds of the traction street railway. It is
seeking an investment of $5,000,000 in this city in a water works plant.
The firm's representative here states that the Salt Lake road will be
bo constructed as to cover all the natural scenic wonders in all the
territory covered by the line. The line will be also so built as to form
a connection with the Valley road.
SAD DEATH OF A
CALIFORNIA BOY
W. H. Lockwood of
Eureka Drowned.
CARRIED OFF BY THE CURRENT
A FEW DAYS BEFORE HE TOOK
GREWSOME PHOTOGRAPHS.
\
Special Dispatch to The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Sept. 13.â Will H.
Lockwood, a young man about 21 years
old, formerly a resident of Eureka, Cal..
was drowned on the flats at the head J
of Douglas Island, seven miles from j
Juneau, last night. He was one of a j
party which left Douglas City last Sun- :
day on a fishing trip. At the Indian j
ranch they learned there were no fish j
In Salmon Creek, and, anchorln- their j
boat on the beach, walked to Lemon
Creek a few miles farther up the â 
beach. When they returned the tide
was high. It was night and in the
darkness the boat could just be dis
tinguished a short distance- out from |
shore. Young Lockwood could not j
swim but he took off his clothes and
started to wade out in the ice-cold
water to the boat. It was bo dark he
could hardly be seen by his companions
ashore. Once they called out, asking
how he was making it. Ho replied,
-All right but this water is awful cold
and there's a swift current; am up to
my armpits." A lew seconds later
they heard a splash, a half-stifled cry
toFbSS and that was the last of the
venturesome young fellow. He had
stepped beyond his depth and was
swept down to his death. To-day the
body was recovered some distance from
where he disappeared.
Young Lockwood was formerl} in
charge of the telephone office here, but
he had recently established a photo
graph gallery over at Douglas City..
He won the free-for-all bicycle race
here last Fourth of July. His mother,
sisters and a brother are now at Eu
reka The time for their leaving to
join 'the father and son here set
for next week. Mr. Lockwood is now
at Pine Creek, at the new diggings.
He is expected out in a few days. The
body will be held till he arrives.
A few days before his death young
Lockwood rigged an apparatus with a
string attachment and took a picture
of himself in a coffin. On the same
day and by the same apparatus he
photographed himÃelf in the act of be
ing hanged. This last attempt to intro
duce the morbid and realistic in art
nearly ended fatally, for the noose
slipped, became so tight that he could
not release himself and the young pho
tographer would certainly have hanged
himself but for the very opportune ar
rival of a lady friend at the gallery.
SHAFTER MAKES A
SENSATIONAL SPEECH
Say i When the Fleet First Left Tam
pa It Was the Intention to
Attack Havana.
CHICAGO, Sept. 22.â A special dispatch
to the Tribune from Constantino, Mich.,
gives a speech made by General Shatter
at that place, where he went to attend
the reunion of the Nineteenth Michigan
Regiment, of which he was colonel dur
ing the civil war. General Shafter said
that when the fleet first left Tampa it
was intended to land twenty-five miles
from Havana and march on to that city.
When, however, the fleet put back be
cause of the reported proximity of a
Spanish squadron, word was received
from Admiral Bampson that Santiago
could be taken in twenty-four hours, and
the army sailed for that point. General
Shatter then described in his own char
acteristic manner the campaign *t San
tiago.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1893.
ON THE VERGE OF
A GRAVE CRISIS
Military Against Civil
Law in France.
ZURLINDEN AS A DICTATOR
IGNORES THE MACHINERY OF ;
CIVIL COURTS.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Sept. 22.â The situation here
is generally admitted to be grave by
both press and people. The conflict
between the civil and military authori
ties is becoming acute. The sudden
and unexpected action of General Zur
linden, the Military Governor of Paris,
in prosecuting Colonel Picquart on the
charge of forgery and using forged
documents assumes a grave aspect an
account of the circumstances attending
this intervention of the military au
thorities in a civil court.
At the present moment, when the po
litical atmosphere is surcharged with
dangerous electricity, generated by the
Dreyfus case, General Zurlinden, who
has just quitted the Cabinet, in de
fiance of civil authority, takes, without
cc/nsulting his successor or the Premier,
an important step. In ordinary cir
cumstances the Military Governor is
empowered to act independently, but,
now that the Dreyfus question ha* be
come a great national matter, every
proceeding in the affair has state im
portance.
General Zurlinden's ignoring of this
obvious fact is very significant. He
comes forward as the defender of the
army, the prosecutor of its supposed
calumniators and the resolute opponent
of a revision of the case. From this
to an appeal to the public, in the line
of the establishment of a dictatorship,
there is no wide step.
The Soliel says that, owing to yes
terday's events, the Cabinet at a for
mal conference discussed General Zur
linden's action, and the Fronde even
asserts that the Premier, M. Brisson,
disavows the measures taken against
Picquart. which he says were insti
tuted without the knowledge of the
Cabinet.
The Radical makes a bitter attack on
the general staff, which it charges with
aiming at the moral assassination of
Picquart through a secret military
trial.
Henri Rochefort, in his paper, the
Intransigeant, declares that Picquart
was bribed by a syndicate or by Ger
many to save Dreyfus.
Jaures, the Socialist Deputy, in the
Petite Republique, maintains that the
general staff of the French army can
not now escape the full light of a re
vision of the Dreyfus case.
CHRISTMAS
PACKAGES
TO BE SENT
Uncle Sam Will See That
Boys at Manila Are
Not Forgotten.
WASHINGTON, Sept 22.â The -
families and friends of the Cali
fornia boys now at Manila will
have an opportunity to remem
ber them on Christmas. Nu
merous inquiries have been made
of the War Department by
friends of soldiers serving in the
Philippine Islands in relation to
facilities for sending the men
packages in the event that the
troops will be retained In the
East until Christmas. In expec
tation that Major General Otis'
army will be retained in the
Philippines for several months
the War Department has decid
ed to furnish the desired facili
ties for conveying to the men
such Christmas packages as
may be furnished by their rela
tives and friends. It is pro
posed to send a vessel from San
Francisco in the early part of
November In ample time to
reach Manila before Christmas,
which vessel will carry packages
free of charge. A limit will be
placed on the size and weight of
packages to be carried, and no
tice will be given when arrange
ments are completed. Packages
are to be consigned to an officer
of the quartermaster's depart
ment at San Francisco, who will
attend to the shipment to Ma
nila. - The department will , en
deavor to secure a special rate
from the overland carrying com
panies for, all packages ad
dressed to soldiers, and notice
will be given of the latest date
for their reception at San Fran
cisco.

IN PUBLIC
All Alaska to Witness
the Execution of
Three Indians.
FO BE HANGED AT TAGISH.
Thrilling Story of the Assassin
ation of a Hold-Seeker
by Greedy Natives.
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Sept. 13.âInvita
tions to a wholesale hanging at Ta
gish House on Tagish Lake are being
extended throughout the Yukon Valley
and Southeastern Alaska by the Cana
dian police. Three Indians will Mther
have their necks broken or be stran
gled to death there, at the same time,
in a few weeks. They killed one pros
pector and would ha,ve murdered an
other but for miraculous circumstances
which enabled him to escape. On this
account the attendance of ingoing ;<.nd
outcoming Klondikers and Indians is
likely to be very large. Dawson, Dyea,
Skaguay and Juneau will be repre
sented by delegations, Juneau especial
ly, aa both the victims are old-time
residents of this town.
The crime of the Indiana was the
most unprovoked and one of the blood
iest in the history of Alaska. The
only survivor, George Fox, is here now.
He tells the first particulars of the
thrilling crime which was briefly re
counted in The Call last summer, a
short time after it occurred.
William Mehan and Fox left Juneau
last winter. They sledded a fine out
fit to the head of the McClintock River,
whence they intended to cross a por
tage to the Hootallnqua River and
work gome sand bars on that stream.
McClintock River empties into the
lower end of Lrf*ke Marsh, flowing from
a northeasterly direction. It is the out
let of a small lake. But when the two
men got to the head of the Tiver it was
along about the end of May, the por
tage was bare of snow and they could
not sled their stuff over. As the eas
iest way out of the trap, they set
about whipsawing lumber and build
ing a boat to carry them back down
the McClintock and up the Hootalin
qua. The latter river is the outlet of
Lake Teslin into the Lewis River.
Near their camp was a small Indian
camp. The white men had potlatched
"ictus" (tobacco and other things) with
the Indians and otherwise been friend
ly to them. When they were leaving
camp with their stuff packed In the
boat for down river, Fox took out his
watch to note the time. He told Me
han that it waa Just 10:40. He had
hardly dropped his watch back into
his pocket and picked up his paddle
when they were fired on by the In
dians from ambush in the rear. Fox
sat in the bow. He was struck in the
back. He fell partly over the. side,
with one arm paralysed and hanging
in the water. He exclaimed: "I'm
done for, Bill; pull for your life." But
poor Bill did not pull. He was dead,
riddled by three bullets in the back,
one through the heart. Fox could not
see him, but his position enabled him
to see the Indians running from the
woods down to the shore. Fox moved
involuntarily and they let him have
another volley, as he lay helpless and
bleeding in the boat. One bullet had
gone clear through his body and lungs.
But by this time the boat had drifted
into rougher water and the second vol
ley struck low. It found lodgment in
a sack of flour and a case of corned
beef.
The current here set across the river
against a point about half a mile be
low. The Indians ran back into the
woods. The moment Fox saw them
run he knew what they intended to do.
They would catch the boat as it
grounded against the point. It would
be ail up with him then, if he wasn't
as good as dead anyhow. His paddle
luckily lay balanced on the gunwale,
with just enough of it inside to keep
It from falling into the water. He tried
to paddle back to shore with his un
injured right arm, but was too weak.
Then another idea struck him. To re
main in the boat and be caught at the
point was certain death, as the Indians
would certainly kill him, having begun
the Job. in order to secure their outfit,
the watch and their guns; on shore
there was a chance for escape. In
this critical emergency he placed the
paddle Into the water perpendicular to
the boat and feebly turned it around
toward the shore. Chance favored him,
for in a few moments the boat ground
ed oh a small spot of sand ' near a
grassv spit. There was a rotten log
lying with one end near the water and
the other up the bank.
"I realized at once," said Fox, "the
importance of leaving no trail, and for
all I could do I feared at least a few
drops of blood would escape from my
clothes and stain the grass. My
clothes were soaked with it. I stepped
from grass tuft to tuft as well as I
could, for I was rapidly becoming:
weaker. When I stepped on the end
of the log It was so rotten that it broke
away. But that was the only mark
I left. I knew that when the Indiana
got the boat and found only one man
in it they would start back to look
for me. So I saw It would not do to
stay down near the river, and I made
for the foothills. I headed for the
mouth of the river, where white men
were camped and building boats, and
there was also a police camp. It took
me seven hours to make those ten
miles. It was the toughest time I
ever had in my life. I was so weak
that I gave up several times, but after
having stopped a few minutes I would
set out with renewed determination. I
thought I would never get out. Green
and yellow lights flashed before my
; eyes. I was blinded and butted my
1 face against trees. My legs would not
; move. But I said to myself: 'Brace
1 up, old man; don't lie down and did
like a dog; don't lie down and die â
don't lie down â don't lie down.'
"And I kept saying this over and over
to myself. I grasped the branches of
bushes and treeÃ. and pulled myself
along, saying first to one leg, 'Come
along here, old boy,' and then to the
other, 'Come along here, old boy, don't
go back on me now.' Thus I shoved,
and pushed and pulled myself along
through the foothill brush and bramble.
"God! how I did want a drink of
water. My tongue was cracking for it.
Little rivulets were right before me,
but I could not reach them. I felt that
if I ever got down on the ground I
would never be able to rise again.
Once I tried It at what I thought was
a favorable brook. But as I stooped
over there was an awful pressure on
my head behindâ the weight of weak
ness. I barely caught myself in time
and straightened up. It is a thousand
times worse to see cool water rippling
before one's lips without being able
to sip it than it is to be cracked with
thirst and no water in sight. Well, I
finally got down the river some miles
to a white man's camp."
The police started right back up the
river. They found the boat well
grounded on the point, but no Indians
were n sight. It seems that the oldest
Indian, a young buck of about 21 years,
had been taken sick when the four
reached the point. He picked up Me
han's bag and some grub and went back
to camp with the load. Finding but one
body in the boat the other three, as
anticipated by Fox, started back up
the river to find him or traces of what
had become f him. The murderous
redskins were divided In opinion as to
whether Fox had fallen into the river
or escaped. They found the broken log,
they admitted afterward, and knew he
had got ashore and was alive.
In the meantime the police had ar
rived at the Indian camp. The young
buck who had pleaded sickness was in
his tepee. He had two squaws, a young
one and an old one. He denied having
seen a boat or even a white man in the
vicinity. The handcuffs were put on
him ana he was taken down the river.
The officers started on a hunt for the
other natives, but they returned to
camp soon after the police left and
learning from the squaws that the old
est buck had been bagged they took to
the woods Instantly. The police en
gaged the services of another Indian
and eventually all three were captured
farther back In the mountains, making
for the Cassiar. They had to depend
on their guns for food and were thus
tracked. The hired Indian went into
their camp pretending friendship. He
seized their guns at night and all were
soon helpless in handcuffs and lariats.
The youngest is only fifteen years old.
The Indian captured with the squaws
was taken before Fbx as he lay in bed.
Fox had been propped up into a sitting
posture. The Indian's eyes bulged out
as soon as he saw Fox, as though he
was suddenly confronted by an appari
tion. He swayed first to one side then
the other. He thought Fox had been
killed and tliat he saw his ghost. He
threw up both hands and exclaimed:
"Klach!" Which, translated, means
that he never saw Fox before.
Fox Identified all four of the natives
at the trial in Dawson. The youngest
one was recommended to mercy and
will be imprisoned. The other three
have been brought back to Tagish, near
the scene of their crime, to be executed.
The hanging will take place Novem
ber 1 nextâ three at once from tho same
gibbet. They are young renegades who
captured the squaws and undertook the
murder in order to have a supply of
grub to last them through the winter.
The coming hanging is already having
the desired moral effect on the Indians
of the coast and interior. They are all
talking about it and there will be hun
dreds of them in attendance. Possibly
there may be trouble, but it is not
thought probable. It is expected to
have enough polico present to put down
any outbreak. Fox will be there.
Mehan was a hard-working prospec
tor, but he never had much luck. He
sold his only piece of property in
Juneau tn Banker* B. M. Behrends last
winter and started out with a stake.
Fox says he believes that something
supernatural helped him out of that
boat and pushed him along through the
foothills when he was about to give up,
and that the shade of old Bill Mehan
will be present at the triple hanging.
Had he not been able to escape, almost
as a miracle, the natives would Have
destroyed the boat by fire, obliterated
all other marks of identification and
their fate would probably have never
been known.
This is the first case known of Indians
attacking gold-seekers for plunder. In
the Lake Teslin basin and around the
headwaters of the Pelly, Stewart, Bisc
Salmon and other rivers of the vast
water shed of the Yukon are Isolated
parties seeking tl.e golden fleece.

JARMAN-REA
SLANDER SUIT
Most of a Day Spent
in Arguments.
ADMISSIBILITY OF TESTIMONY
EFFORT TO SHUT OUT IMPORT-
ANT WITNESS.
Croat Takes the Matter Under Ad
visement â Sensation Looked
For When Rea Takes
the Stand.
Special Plsratoh to The Call.
PAX JOSE, Sept. 22.â Most of the time
to-day in the trial of the Jarman-Rea
Blander suit was occupied by Attorneys
Delmas and Morehouse in argument.
During part of the afternoon Judge
Hyiand sat beside Judge Kittredge and
was an attentive listener.
Sensational features are looked for
at any time in the proceedings, and es
pecially when Rea takes the stand on
his own behalf. He -boasts that half
has not yet been told of meetings at
his house to eonsider applicants for
places in the Police and Fire depart
ments, and promises to reveal some
hitherto unpublished facts In regard to
San Jose politics. Just how far the boss
will go into gang secrets is worrying
the small politicians.
When Jarman was recalled to the
stand he was asked if he remembered
making a visit to Hea's office, accom
panied by C. M. Shortridge, when he
(Jarman) was a candidate for Super
visor. He said he did, but did not
ask the boss 1 aid in the election. Wlt
nesa paid Paul P. Austin was given the
.nomination for Supervisor at that time
by Boss Rea.
Samuel G. Tompkins was the next
witness. It was to this person Rea had
also made slanderous remarks concern
ing Jarman. Tompkins stated that at
or about noon of the 11th day of March,
IS9S, as he was passing along North
First street, between Santa Clara and
St. John, Kea hailed him. Witness
stopped and Rea opened conversation
by saying, "You have got some crook
ed men in the Charter Club." Tomp
kins inquired, "Who. for Instance?"
Rea replied, "Jack Jarman; he robbed
th- city when he was in the Council.
What did he do with the $900 he got
on the purchase of the street roller?"
This testimony is the second count in
the case, and $25,000 damages is de
manded from defendant for its slan
derous utterance.
Tompkins said only himself and Rea
were immediately present, but several
persona were standing on the sidewalk.
Rea and Tompkins were in the middle
of the street. Tompkins said he was at
the time a member of the New Charter
Club. In answer to Attorney More
house witness denied that any motion
or r -solution had been passed by the
New Charter Club indorsing the action
of Jarman in bringing suit against
Rea.
George A. Landers was called to tes
tify, but he had only got started when
Attorneys Delmas and Morehouse en
tered upon lengthy arguments as to
whether witness was competent to tes
tify as to the meaning of Rea's words,
when he accused Jarman of receiving
$400 on the purchase of the steam
roller.
IVfore the argument began Landers
stated hf was 28 years old and a painter
by trade. He was employed by Jar
nan in painting a fence at Mrs. Good
rich's place, when Rea and Jarman had
their altercation â on March 14 last.
Witness said Rea came up, tipned his
hat and passed on. Mrs. G-oodrlch,
George Koenlg, Jarman and witness
were present. Jarman ran after him
and called "Rea" twice. Witness could
not say what Jarman said to Rea, but
he heard the latter say, "I never say
anything behind a man's back that I
would not say to his face. There was
$900 paid on that street roller and you
got $400 of it." Jarman answered, "It's
a lie â Infamous He; you are a disgrace
to your fa.nily: you know it's a He."
Landers said Rea turned around, spit
pome tobacco juice on the ground,
picked up a stick and be<~- .1 to whittle.
He said Jarman was excited, while Rea
was cool and smiled. Rea said: "If
you weren't a cripple I'd smash your j
head." Jarman replied there were
other ways to fight. Witness said Rea
was getting a little mad and said, "Go
get your gun and let's take a whack at
other."
After four hours' argument the court
took the matter under advisement, and
will decide th* 1 question at the opening
of court to-morrow.

successful, will be of great benefit to
Monterey County.
CONSULS CANNOT
ISSUE CERTIFICATES
An Important Treasury Ruling
Which Will Still Further Re
strict Landing of Chinese.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 22.-The Secre
tary of the Treasury to-day made an
important ruling in which he holds that
Chines.- Consuls in foreign countries are
not authorized to issue certificates to
privileged classes of Chinese entering this
country.
The effect of this ruling will be to pro
hibit the entry into this country of the
privileged classes except upon presenta
tion of certificates issued by the Imperial
Chinese Government. In view of the fact
that the Government has never issued
certificates of this character, it is be
lieved that comparatively few Chinese,
even of the exempt classes, will apply
*>Â«reafter for admission.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1898.
EVIDENCE OF A
BRUTAL MURDER
Old John Burns' Death
at Black Point.
SANDBAG UNDOUBTEDLY USED
BRUISE ON THE FISHERMAN'S
TEMPLE.
His Cabin Ransacked and His Pock
ets Rifled â Two Missing Neigh
bors for Whom the Police
Are Searching.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 22.â 1n view of
a discovery made to-day little doubt
remains that old John Burns, the fish
erman found dead In his lonely cabin
on Black Point, near Novato, was foul
ly murdered in order that the assassins
might secure a sum of money believed
to be concealed in the vicinity. "When
Coroner Eden brought the remains to
town last night the only sign of vio
lence discernible on the body was a
slight discoloration on the left temple.
To-day the discoloration has turned to
a livid red spot the size of a silver
dime and the flesh near it has taken
on a mottled bluish appearance.
It is believed that the fisherman must
have been struck with a sandbag, as
any other instrument would have made
an abrasion of the skin. Only a slight
blow would have been necessary to
kill Burns, as in addition to being very
feeble from his advanced years, he
has been ill for some time and had
grown very emaciated. The old fel
low was over 60 years of age, and dur
ing the last twenty years has lived
alone in his little cabin on Black Point.
He was known to huntsi..en and fish
ermen from all parts as "Massa John."
Near him lived two other fishermen
who could not be found yesterday by
Constable Louis Devoto. A summons
has been issued for their presence at
the inquest to-morrow and they will be
carefully questioned.
Another fact that tends to prove
Burns was murdered is the condition
in which his cabin was found when
Coroner Eden went ofter the body.
Everything was thrown about helter
skelter, boxes pulled out of a corner
and opened, the pockets of some
clothes hanging on the wall turned in
side out and most of the clothes re
moved from the body.
The case will be thoroughly investi
gated and every effort made to find
the murderers, if the Coroner's Jury de
cides a crime has been committed. The
two fishermen living near Burns are
regarded as most Important witnesses.

OREGON AND IOWA
WILL BE SPEEDED
Few Stops on the Way
to Manila.
GREAT HASTE THE ORDER
THE BATTLESHIPS TO PAUSE
ONLY FOR COALING.
This Action Is Intended to Impress
Upon Germany the Sea Pow
er of the United,
States.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 22.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
As an indication of the haste which
will be observed by the battleships Ore
gon and lowa in making their voyage
to Honolulu, and then to Manilla, it can
be stated on authority that they will
make but three Btops between New
York and the Hawaiian Islands, In or
der that they may reach their desti
nation with all possible dispatch.
The stops to be made will be due to
the necessity of recoaling the ships,
and this operation will be attended
with some vigilance and expedition, as
was the case when the Oregon made her
famous run from San Francisco to Key
West. The authorities continue to be
silent as to the reason for the dispatch
of the battleships to the Pacific and
the reason for the haste to be observed,
but, as the Herald has stated, the ac
tion is of a precautionary character
and designed to impress Germany with
the sea power of the United States and
the intention of this Government not to
permit any interference with the dis
position to be made of Spanish islands
In the far East. '
The date of the sailing of the battle
ships cannot be definitely fixed by the
Navy Department, but their orders re
quire them to sail when they are ready
for sea.
POSSE ON THE TRAIL
OF CONVICT GOULD
He Steals Food, Raiment and a Shot-
gun From a Cabin Near
San Anselmo.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 22.â Late this
evening a boy living near San Anselmo
rode at full speed Into town and breath
lessly informed Sheriff Harrison that Al
ton H. Gould, the convict who escaped
from San Quentin last Sunday evening,
had made hie appearance at a cabin near
San Anselmo, occupied by a farmhand
named Clark, had stolen food and wear
ing apparel and had armed himself with
a shotgun before leaving. The boy said
the neighborhood was terrified, and
begged the Sheriff to go to the scene.
Sheriff Harrison and Constable Louis
Hughes hastily gathered a posse and left
for San Anselmo.
The surounding country was scoured for
the convict, but it was too dark for ef
fective work, and the posse had to return.
A guard was left to watch for Gould's re
turn. The knowledge that the desperate
man is armed has thrown the residents
Into a very excited state.
At 10 o'clock a hunter came into town
in a bujjgy andr ' Informed Constable
Hughes anu Sheriff Harrison that he had
met Gould on the Olena road, between
San Anselmo and Fairfax. Under niÂ» arm
the convict carried the shotgun stolen
from Clark's cabin. They spoke to each
other in passing. The news was sent to
San Quentin, and a posse was at onco
sent after the convict. It is believed he
will be captured before morning.
COLONEL PRYAN
AT WASHINGTON
Bequests the Discharge of Only Cer-
tain Members of His
Regiment.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 22.-Colonel Wil
liam J. Bryan, Third Nebraska Volun
teers, was at the War Department to
day.
Neither to the Acting Secretary of War i
nor to the adjutant general did Colonel
Bryan or Governor Holcomb make any
request as to the mustering out of the I
Third Nebraska Regiment, or allude to
the desires of Colonel Bryan in reference [
to the subject.
After leaving the Wnr Department,
Colonel Bryan and his party went to the
White House. They were cordially re
ceived by President McKinley and re
mained in conference with him for more
than an hour. They did not proffer a
request for the mustering out of the regi
ment as a whole, but only for the dis
charge of such members as are disabled
by disease or have peculiar calls upon
them.
FATE OF A MAN WHO
RESISTED EVICTION
After Killing Two Men He Is Shot
Dead by Some One in a
Crowd.
CUMBERLAND, Md.. Sept. 22.â Frank
P. Myers shot and instantly killed John
Lenhart, a constable, and Michael Kerns,
a bystander, at Garrett, Md., yesterday,
while resisting an eviction, which was
the result of a family dispute. He then
barricaded the doors and windows of the
house, but was finally captured by the
Sheriff of the county. As he was being
taken to Jail some one in the crowd shot
the prisoner in the head, and he fell dead
in the Sheriff's arms. A posse is hunting
for the man who shot Myers.
DABBY TRIAL AT FRESNO.
Defense Springs a Sensation in the
Murder Case.
FRESNO. Sept. 22.â The fourth day of
the trial of Frank Darby, accused of kill-
Ing Louis Boldlnl, developed a sensation.
It was shown by several witnesses tnat
the party of which Boldlnl was a member
had but one gun and that this had been
taken to Mendota by one Sanches pre
vious to the shooting. But It developed
on the cross-examination of Constable
Adams of Mendota to-day that there
were two guns in the party, the one taken
to Mendota and the one which was found
in the wagon when the constable visited
the scene of the murder. It is thought
now that the defense will endeavor to
show that Boldini was killed by a member
of his own party. The introduction of the
second gun into the affair caused a decid
ed sensation.

HE HAD A FINE TIME.
"Feel better after your outing, neigh
bor?" asked one Joy street man of an
other.
"Stronger than a locomotive. Haven't
a touch of rheumatism, and can handle
I myself like an athlete."
"In training while you were gone?"
"Yes, fighting bugsâ all kinds of
winged insects. It was just biff! bang!
all day and most of the night. Exer
cise? I not only struck, kicked and
danced, but went through every pos
sible contortion of the human body. A
moth miller is a nice, pretty, innocent
little thing, but get twenty-five of them
inside your collar all at once and see
how it goes. But that was only an
item. While -the millers were enjoying
themselves I'd have my eyes full of
some small bug that defies every form
of death except dro.vnlng. big beetles
would be hitting my ears with a deaf
ening noise; the mosquito fleet assailed
me at every angle; flies played the part
of rough riders, and some kind of bug
in three colors that gave forth a sound
like that of a buzz-saw zipping through
a hardwood knot did a regular war
dance. They dro.ve me out at the fin
ish, but my muscles are harder and
more flexible than they have been since
I was a schoolboy. I might have sur
vived It another week, but when a lot
of bees tried to hive in my old straw
hat while I was wearing it I took a
lumber wagon and caught the first
train home." â Detroit Free Press.
FAMOUS SONS OF PARSONS.
The fact that George Curzon, though

them? Of living celebrities we have Sir
William Hareourt, Sir Evelyn Wood. Sir

THE CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS.
NEVER in our history has it been more desirable
than now that all departments of the Government
at Washington should be animated by a unity
of purpose and of sentiment. While the campaigns
of the year may be waged mainly 0:1 State questions,
there are nevertheless grave and portentous na
tional issues waiting to be dealt with, and for the
right solution of the problems involved in them there
will be required a full harmony of action between the
administration and both branches of Congress.
Neither in the domain of domestic nor of foreign
politics will there be possible the adoption and en
forcement of consistent, straightforward policies if
Congress, or either branch of it, is antagonistic to the
administration. We have seen the evil effects of di
vided councils at Washington during the session of
Congress which has just closed. Having no effec
tive majority in the Senate, it was impossible for the
Republicans to pass a currency reform bill or to pro
vide for the upbuilding of an American merchant
marine adequate to the demands of our commerce.
Other measures hardly less important than these were
also set aside by reason of this antagonism between
the two houses.
If similar conditions prevail in the next Congress
similar results will follow. Currency reform will be
again postponed, the fiat money fanatics will resume
their agitations, American shipping interests will be
again denied the protection needed to enable them
to live and work in competition with the subsidized
shipping interests of European nations, and the whole
issue of the grave problems of our foreign relations
will be left to the chances of party log-rolling and
political compromises.
These issues affect every business interest and
every industry of the people. They are not to be
overlooked simply because the fused factions of op
position in this campaign are evading great national
questions and trying to distract the attention of the
\otcrs from them.
The nation never had larger affairs involved in the
elections of an off year than in this one. Never were
the Congressional contests of mor* importance.
Never was it more imperative to elect a majority of
representatives in harmony with the administration.
Never was it more essential to the general welfare
that the Senate should be in accord with the other
branches of the Government. It is therefore the duty
of every citizen to promote Republican success in the
Congressional districts, and to that end work should
begin at once.
a NEW REFORM PROGRAMME.
WATSON of the woolly brain and wild voice is
silent, Sam Jones has not been heard to dis
turb the atmosphere for some time, and still
Georgia is not without her agitations. A new re
former has arisen in the land where Toombs, Stephens
and Cobb lie buried, and proposes a new political
movement which, with the fervor of a Sam Jones re
vival, pops louder than Populism itself and threatens
to raise Cain and even Hades all over these United
States.
This reformer proposes that on each New Year's
day there shall be held an election in every county
in the United State*, at which each voter shall declare
by ballot whom he regards as the worst and most
demoralizing citizen in the county. The person whose
name is found on a plurality of the ballots, is under
tie reform system to be publicly hanged on the
first day of the ensuing February. The Governor is
to have no right of pardon in cases of this kind, nor
is there to be any appeal to the Supreme Court on
any question involved in the law or its processes.
The argument of the reformer is that under the
operation of his proposed law each county would get
rid of its worst citizen in the first year, and that
thereafter all bad citizens would either move off to
son.c place where they are not known, or else re
pent and reform. There would be, he claims, an
immediate moral elevation of the whole people. All
men, and particularly all "prominent citizens." would
at once really and earnestly strive to be good.
The idea, while too radical for adoption in prac
tical clitics, is too valuable to be wholly lost. We
have been striving for a long time in this country to
bring ?bout an elevation of the stage. Why not try
the Georgia reform scheme for a season in theatrical
circle?? If it works well there we can then extend
it to the nation.
Perhaps the policemen who were with Lieutenant
Burke when he was killed are not as cowardly as re
ported. At least they have the nerve to remain and
try to defend themselves, when they have had all
these months in which to resign.
France might establish its allegation that Henry
really committed suicide. All that would be neces
sary to do would be to demonstrate that having cut
his throat from oar to ear, the gentleman swallowed
Ifae razor.
THE MAGUIRE OF RECORD.
WE believe that the candidacy of Judge Maguire
with the concurrent proposition of constitu
tional amendment No. 2, which is known as
the single tax amendment, is having a de
pressing effect upon real estate values. Men
will not invest their earnings in real estate
in the immediate prospect of its confiscation.
Judge Maguire refuses to defend land confis
cation while he is a candidate. He stakes his election
on the railroad issue, and tells the people that if he
is defeated the East will take it as evidence that Cali
fornia has given up the fight against the funding bill.
This declaration ignores the fact that there is no
funding bill to fight. A year ago Maguire was hob
bing and nobbing with Senator Morgan and certify
ing him as the apostle of anti-funding. If we mistake
not, the Democratic party officially extended its
thanks to Senator Morgan for his position on that
question. Morgan has fought that issue to a finish,
and says that the legislation of the last session leaves
nothing more to be done, that the question is settled
and the issue is concluded. Now if Judge Maguire's I
defeat is going to make such a deep negative impres
sion in the East, what will be the affirmative effect of
his election?
In his speech in the House, of the 4th of last Feb
ruary, he spotted all of the privileged classes against
which he declared war. First in the list he put the
private land-owner, whom he called an "aggressor
and monopolist," the "strong and cunning" despoiler
of "the weak and undesigning." He said it was
the duty of the Government to restore all land to the
people, and did not propose any compensation to the"
present owners.
These views are not new with the Judge. In
Barry's Starof April 17, 1886, Maguire said: "Believing
that the taking of all ground rent for public purposes
would place all citizens upon a level, I am in favor of
an amendment to the constitution of California pro
viding for raising all revenue for public purposes by
a single tax on land."
Again, on May 29 of the same year he said in the
Star: "We must learn that this is the people's coun
try, and its land should be and must be of natural
right forever the heritage of the whole people. This
indefensible monopoly of the God-given land (private
ownership), which is merely a government privilege
to the monopolist, should be immediately abolished,
just as a letter of marque would be canceled or the
commission of a guerrilla annulled."
Here it will be observed that he likens the land
owner to a pirate, sailing under letters of marque and
reprisal, or to a guerrilla, who robs and murders
under a commission.
It would be interesting to hear his explanation of
these views. Throughout his record on tlie issue he
has dealt in invective and appeals to the prejudice of
the non-landholder. Being desirous, as he says, of
leveling all mankind, of course his views are attrac
tive to all who believe that some time the thrifty and
industrious shall be compelled to divide their prop
erty with those who are not thrifty and industrious.
Men whose tastes lead them to rural pursuits invest
their earnings in real property. Those whose tastes
run to trade and finance invest their earnings in per
sonal property. In Maguire's view the land investor
is a robber whose property must be taken from him
without compensation, while the investor in personal
property is not onJr to be protected by the laws and
courts, the Police and Fire departments, but is to be
wholly exempt from taxation to pay for that protec
tion!
Great efforts have been for years sustained here to
attract a rural population to California. We have
tried to induce the Eastern land-holder to sell his real
estate and reinvest here, and become a producer.
The farmer looks upon his land as something more
than the means of producing a living. To him it rep
resents not only its first cost as an investment, but it
represents the labor by which he subjects it to culti
vation and puts it to its best uses. This increment to
the value of his land is the product of labor solely,
which has increased its fertility, by draining it where
too wet for cultivation and irrigating it where too
dry. If the owner's tastes leads him toward other
occupations he desires to withdraw his investment
from land by selling it and adding to its first cost, in
terest and taxes, the increment due to his labor. Or
as age dictates cessation of the hard labor of the farm
he wishes either to sell it and retire, or to rent it and
seek the ease and peace required by his age and past
toil.
Under the Afaguire plan of confiscation he can
neither sell nor rent. Not owning the land, he cannot
transfer it for a consideration, nor can he rent it and
live on the income, for Maguire says "All ground
rent must be taken for public purposes," in order to
put mankind "on a level."
In the shadow of such a policy all land values cease.
No man will sell in another State to buy here.
Therefore, when we study the effect of Judge Ma
guire's defeat, which he says will impress the East
that California has given up the funding fight that
Morgan declares is already ended, let us remember
that the East is thoroughly indifferent to the funding
fight anyway. Its various phases have neither pro
moted nor restrained immigration to California nor
affected our local development. At one time, when
it seemed to involve the possibility of overland rail
competition, it assumed an interest with which it can
never be reirrvested, because the Valley Road has al
ready accomplished that. It is plain, therefore, that
Maguire's defeat will make no impression in the East
unfavorable to California by reason of the dead issue
of the funding bill.
We are then free to consider the affirmative effect
of his election, in the light of his declaration that
land-owners are "monopolists and aggressors," the
despoilers of "the weak and undesigning," and are
like pirates and guerrillas.
Garcia is now declared to be against the indepen
dence of Cuba. The old man ought to try something
for what ails him. He manifests the symptoms of
gout, although how a man could acquire this disease
on a diet of raw onions and ditch water remains to be
explained.
No more soldiers on their way to the Philippines
arc to be entertained at Honololu. Perhaps this is
the reason the soldiers now in the islands are trying
to do a little enteric ining themselves, "with particular
reference to the amusement of the police.
Rumor hus it that a Clash is likely between the
French and English at Fashoda. But then Rumor
always was an old liar, and it must be remembered
that the chance to make a subject of the war with
Spain is about over.
There can be no excuse for doling out to the sol
diers at Benicia anything but decent rations, and the
boys can kick without having their patriotism called
into question.
Aguinaldo will be judged more by his actions in the
Philippines than by any speeches his representatives
may make in this country.
As matters look just now Dreyfus ought to be
grateful for the prospect of being murdered
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1898.
GEMS FROM DE YOUNG'S ALBUM
OF THOUGHT.
EVIDENCE is not lacking that M. H. de Young
has experienced a new birth. The remade De
Young retains enough of the old to show the
process has not been complete. Neither has the
operation been an improvement. There seems to
have been a hitch, and he came out of the transfor
mation worse than he went in. This is demonstrated
by a glance at the files of his esteemed paper as it
essayed to mold opinion during thvi Senatorial
campaign of 1886. That series of issues constitutes a
veritable Album of Thought, and now De Young
would bury its gems and forget that he ever created
them. Marvelous change; and all in a dozen brief
years.
The Call has no personal fight to make upon De
Young. It realizes that he is not fit to be a Senator,
that in selecting him for this high position the Re
publicans would assume a burden greater than they
could bear, that the people of California will not tol
erate De Young, and that bosses attempting to foist
him upon the party will send the legislative ticket
down to certain defeat and weaken the ticket from
end to end. Therefore The Call thinks the present
the proper time in which to express its views, which,
as to this matter in hand, are the views of the Repub
lican hosts. For years De Young has yearned for
the office. He was never near it, and the exposure
of his present tactics prevents him from being near it
now. He is trying to make a "still" hunt. We are
interfering merely by projecting into the situation
a little wholesome noise. This is for the public good
and not for the purpose of annoying.
Despite the fact that quotations from De Young's
own journal were freely given yesterday morning,
some of them are so appropriate, so timely and
breathe such sincere conviction, that they are well
worth presenting again. Here are a few:
September 15 â Sargent can help us In this
matter if he wishes to. Let him ask the
nominees who are favorable to his election
to openly declare themselves.
September 16â Why not demand of every
man who wants to go to the Legislature
what he intends to do when the time comes
to vote for Senator? Nine-tenths of the
men who will shortly be up for election will
have to show their hands, and In this way the
people of California may have a Senator who
is their very own choice.
September 20 â Things have come to a
pretty passâ have they not? when a candi
date for the Legislature presumes to keep
hin intentions as to the Senatorship a secret
from his constituents.
October 18â Sargent had better throw off
the mask and play a bold game.
October 21â The election of Sargent to the
Senate would mean the defeat of the Repub
licans in this State in 1888.
October 30â Isn't it a farce that all this
elaborate machinery should be put In motion
to carry into the United States Senate a
man whom the people, if they could cast a
direct vote in the matter, would retire to
private life?
There is much more of the same tenor. We coun
sel Mr. de Young to read it all, to substitute his name
wherever that of Sargent appears, and then he will
understand the popular feeling. De Young is trying
to do just what he accused Sargent of trying to do,
and should he succeed the effect will be precisely that
outlined by himself twelve years ago. He has no
chance of realizing his ambition, and he is the only
man, perhaps, in the State whom this fact has failed
to impress. If his political record were not enough
to kill him, the editorials from his Album of Thought
furnish the weapon with which he commits hara-kiri.
e NEW ERA IN POLITICS.
WITH the assurance now given of the imme
diate construction of a railway front Bakers
field to Los Angeles, thus providing for a
competitive transcontinental thoroughfare, there
ought to result in California a new era in politics as
well as in business. There will be no longer a rail
road monopoly to oppress trade, and consequently
no longer an excuse for agitators and demagogues
to howl against railroads. The whole situation will
be, in fact, radically changed, and with the altered
conditions there will be necessarily a change in the
issues of State politics.
If the managers of the Southern Pacific Company
are wise they will forestall the inevitable by withdraw
ing themselves and their agents from politics at once.
There is no longer any reason why that company,
any more than other corporations, should be an
active factor in political contests. No Legislature,
however subservient the members might be, could
save the company from the effects of the competition
of the new line now projected, and with that com
petition the people have no further reason to desire
the enactment of legislation adverse to the road.
Under the changed conditions railroading in Califor
nia becomes a business subject to the restraints of
competition like any other, and those who conduct it
will have no interests in politics different from those
which concern all business men.
Of course the demagogues of the fused factions will
continue to denounce the monopoly for the rest of
this campaign just as they have always done. When
dogs begin to bay the moon and have roused one
another to rivalry they are apt to go on baying after
the moon has gone down. So it will be in the cam
paign this year. The monopoly is sinking below the
horizon, but Maguire and his satellite orators will
continue to view it with alarm simply because they
have nothing else to bark at. That fact, however,
should not seriously disturb good citizens. The mon
opoly is dead.
For the full clearing up of the situation there is
needed but one thing, and that is the exercise of or
dinary discretion on the part of the old monopoly
officials. They have now nothing to gain by doing
politics and everything to lose. The time has come
for them to close the doors of the Southern Pacific
Company against the bosses and the henchmen of
all parties. Let them go out of politics and stay out
for their own good as well as for that of the State.
Senator Thurston of Nebraska has some derog
gatory remarks to make concerning "space-writers."

THE SINGLE TAX AS REVOLUTIONARY AS IMPERIALISM.
SAN FRANCISCO, September 19, 1898.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir: I have written for you fre
quently on the proposed imperialistic policy which has threatened our lnS^~
tutlons, and. upon that point, your powerful editorials, especially during the
last week, have almost exhausted the possibilities of argument. But you
have permitted me to express my opinions, as your correspondent,
Henry James, heads his weekh- contributions, "With Entire Frankness,
and in reference to the speech of General Barnes on Satu Ir.y night, and es
pecially on account of some further observations X have to offer from the
altitude of Jeffersonian Democracy, I wish to say that, in my opinion, so
much of that speech as sought to propel the doctrine of imperialism upon
the waves of oratory was constitutionally unsound, argumentatively weak,
and wicked in its influence. The wickedness vas not that of th speaker, but
of the sentiment he aimed to feed and to excite. The views of constitutional
law, in its application to lrrmerialism, which you have editorially expressed,
are as accurate as they are deer searching and patriotic. Not even a third
rate lawyer, who had studied the question, could venture to claim, upon
principle and authority, that the constitution of the United States sanc
tioned, or that he structure of our Government tolerated, the holding of
conquered dependencies or the acquisition of indigestible populations
through the annexation of foreign territory. The only argument attempted
to justify our subordination to British ideas and policy are based upon Lord
Brougham's fallacy that our constitution is "like a painted stick, stuck in
tne ground," and upon the real or pretended political belief that peaceful
revolution, the most insidious of all processes, is essential to the fulfillment
of our destiny.
So far as it has progressed, the proposed subversion of the principles
upon which we have relied, and the world has depended, for the perma
nent establishment of the most perfect form of government that the wit of
men almost inspired, could devise, has furnished an almost exact parallel
to the declining years of the Republic of Rome, and the rhetorical appeals to
mnamed passions and to speculative and morbid ambition, whether inten
tionally or unintentionally, are mere invitations to treason. There is no con
ceivaDie ground of law or of policy upon which the frenzied suicide of* the
great American Republic could be relieved of the elements of the most
atrocious crime against humanity and the greatest catastrophe of history.
*. \J ?? aa < Ve Baid before in these columns that a permanent standing army to
noia Asiatic populations would be necessarily composed of mercenaries. I
vTi # nOW> as attested b y the events of the past, that, to keep it from mis
cnier, such an army would have to be constantly employed. Within a few
months, upon the streets of San Francisco and in other parts of the United
states we have had practical illustrations, and many of them, even with
the splendid material of our present army, of the effect of the withdrawal
of citizens into military life when the activities and the definite operations
of war have ceased. Quite enough has been developed to bring home to the
American people the danger to liberty, to order and to solid progress upon
American lines, which the transformation of the United States into a mili
tary power, bent upon conquest and spreading American civilization by the
nne and cannon, must inevitably entail.
But, while these reflections are induced by a part of the address of Gen
eral Barnes, not in any way affecting the State canvass now in progress,
the remainder of his speech I can almost entirely commend and indorse.
Â±ie derides Jeffersonian Democracy, which constitutes my political creed,
Dut he admits the greatness of Grover Cleveland, in which I agree with him,
and with signal ability and success he exposes the unnatural product of the
meretricious union between the flexible representatives of Populism and the
politicians who have seized the Democratic organization. As a consistent
member of that great historical party, which has helped to develop our
country, and, whatever its perturbations in practice, has preserved un
broken continuity in fundamental principles from Jefferson to Cleveland. I
concur in the proposition that the most vital necessity in this State to-day
LtoL t0 defeat a combination which has trampled upon the most sacred doc
trines of American Democracy, which is not the democracy of Greece or
of France, and has invaded the citadel not only of Democracy, but of
Americanism as heretofore occupied by all parties.
It is said that the single tax is n^ t an issue, and yet James G. Maguire
and his most earnest supportersâ men of convictions, too, and not without
strengthâ are arguing that issue day by day as if it were, as it is, essential to
hybrid success to convince the people that they would be benefited, and
their contributions to the support of the Government reduced, by that plain
attempt to confiscate their property, which would require not only an
amendment to the State constitution, but the evisceration of the Federal
constitution Itself. The single tax proposition is as revolutionary as im
perialism, and it is involved in the platform of the Populists, which Mr.
Maguire has subscribed and indorsed.
Government ownership of railroads and of other public utilities, the very
essence of centralization, is equally antagonistic to the avowed principles of
the Democratic party for a century- The attempt to reduce the three depart
ments of government to one and the supervision of the legislative depart
ment by fluctuating majorities is in the last degree obnoxious, not only to
Jeffersonian Democrats, but to every American who believes in the checks
and balances of the constitution.
Attacks upon the judiciary and its actions through injunctions or other
wise are utterly inconsistent with that stability which alone can keep liberty
on its legs and furnish it with the means of subsistence. Loose slanders are
cheap and frequent, but the judicial department is as necessary as the ex
ecutive or the legislative department, and while our government exists the
Integrity of each must be preserved. Corrupt Judges can be and should be
impeached, and if injunctions, which have been the most useful aids to
equity, are too frequent, they can be limited by legislation. The American
people have always sustained the courts because that is one of the guaran
tees of the constitution which the wisdom of our ancestors provided for the
protection of life, of freedom and of property.
The ascendency of socialistic principles or of sand-lot methods would ir
retrievably damage this great State, of which Democrats as well as Repub
licans are justly proud. In these days when constitutional law is coolly
brushed aside by politicians who are hungry for office, and when ancient
and venerable names which conveyed American ideas are desecrated with a
wanton disregard of facts and crt fundamental rights, conservative Republi
cans and conservative Democrats, however differing intheir views of policies
within the constitution, are necessarily brought into closer relations than
have heretofore existed, and they should at least determine that conven
tions which have reiterated the heresies of the Chicago platform and have
ostentatiously repudiated every citizen who did not vote for Bryan and free
silver at 16 to 1. shall not unsettle property and business and shut the door
In the face of that prosperity which how seeks an entrance to California by
land and by sea.
On the whole, therefore, I am disposed to applaud General Barnos,
though I cannot be carried on the wings of his vivid imagination to the
misty region of the Philippines. PUBLICOLA.
UNION LABOR AND MANUFACTURER.
To the Editor of The Morning Call: In a recent issue of your paper there ap
peared a report of the proceedings of the Labor Council, in which A. Furuseth,
of the Coast Seamen's Union, is said to have denounced the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association as an organization of men who neither manufacture nor
produce; he also declared that said association made a concerted effort some time
ago to break up every trade union in this city, and, as a result of driving out the
worklngmen, the manufacturers themselves were driven to the wall and are now
crying out against Eastern competition. Now, Mr. Editor, being a member of
Iron Molders' Union No. 164, which is represented in the Labor Council, and
also a member of the board of directors of the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association, I deem it my duty to say that the attack of Mr. Furuseth was un
provoked and unjust. Prior to the formation of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association there was a society known here as the Engineers' and Iron
Founders' Association, which was organized mainly to crush labor unions, and
after a long and bitter struggle, it succeeded in weakening many of the local or
ganizations, but, as Mr. Furuseth knows, that society has long since ceased to
exist, and I am sure the experience of those connected with it has been that
its work was disastrous to all concerned, because our city has not prospered as
a manufacturing center since that period. Mr. Furuseth and many other labor
men, including myself, attended, by Invitation of the manufacturers, the meet-
Ing at which the Manufacturers' and Producers' Association was formed, and he
knows that ever since its inception there has been one representative of some
labor union on the board of directorsâ Mr. McGlynn, of the Printers' Union be
ing the first to serve in that capacity., and when he resigned, owing to absence
from the city, I was chosen to fill the vacancy, and I must say that during
my experience of nearly two years there has not been a word spoken nor act
performed by sold board that could be construed as unfriendly to organized
labor; on the contrary, the members have been most friendly to me, and while
labor union matters are not discussed, I can plainly see that they desire to
forget the past unpleasantness and are now trying to work for the general "ood
of all the people of our city and State, which they believe can best be attained
by the manufacture and sale here of home productÃ, leaving the question of
unionizing the workshops to the employes themselves. Mr. Furuseth should
know that if the Manufacturers." and Producers' Association is what he terms it
I would not be there, and I know that he would not have been present at its or
ganization as a representative of labor had he believed its intention to be hos
tile to our interests as union men; and if he will but study its well known rec
ord for good, he will plainly see that he has made a mistake.
I understand that the discussion referred to in the council was caused by
the Introduction, by Mr. Dunn of the Cigar-makers' Union, of a resolution in
favor of the consumption of home products. About six months ago the Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association, through its president, Mr. Kerr of the
Occidental Foundry, a strictly union shop, asked the Labor Council, through the
Molders' Union, which is represented there, to join the manufacturers in an ef
fort to obtain legislation requiring each State to use the products of its own
prisons entirely, and thus relieve us of that kind of cheap labor competition
The Labor Council declined to act unless the manufacturers would consent to
unionize their shops and adopt the union label; this the manufacturers posi
tively declined to do, and since then there has been no attempt at concerted ac
tion by either party. The logical result of the advice given by Mr Furuseth
would be to close every workshop to all the mechanics represented in the Labor
Council, for why should any local manufacturer employ a man who is pledged
not to purchase the product of his own hands but prefers to consume foreifm
goods? The union to which I belong is anxious for home Industry that its
members may find work; we will battle for fair conditions afterward We be
lieve in organization, and we attribute 90 per cent of all our distress to low
wages, which has taken from the people their ability to consume the products
of our factories and has made the goods a drug in the market, thereby eventu
ally closing the workshop doors. As union men we should try to convince our
employers that cheap labor is a curse to them as well as to us lam satisfied
that the employers will never, as a whole, force their workmen to join a labor
union. I am convinced, however, that with few exceptions they have no ob
jections to their men joining if they are so inclined. 1 consider that it is
unfair for a firm to force a man to join a union as it is to say that he shall
not join, and I find this to be the feeling among most of the firms Therefor"
'let us accept existing conditions and In good faith try to improve them Let
us prove to our employers that we are their friends instead of their enemies
for there should be no quarrel between labor and capital engaged in manufantnr'
ing-that an injury to either Interest hurts the other, for they both deoend on
the consuming power of the people and they should Join in every effort nosslhiA
to Increase consumption as well as the production of the necessaries of H f
When this is done the introduction of the union label will be easy and in mv
humble opinion it will have to be introduced in this way if success Is attnl h
at all. Let us as union men cease abusing our employers, let us be more trut
ful and less suspicious, and finally let us do all we can to improve thÂ« â¢
ditions of the city and State in which many of us must remain as loner a<T
live, for most of us are here to stay, and "self preservation is the first law of
nature." g MfTevv

AT SACRAMENTO
Lumpy Day for Some of
the Favorites.
TWO OF THEM FAIL TO LAND
HENNESSY FAILS TO GET PLACE
ON RED GLENN.
Tborpe's Weak Ride on Shasta Water
the Cause of Considerable
Disappointment Among
Bettors.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Srtpt. 22.â 1t was Just
a bit lumpy for favorites at the park this
afternoon. Lusette and Shasta Water,
heavily played, failing to land. Red
Glean, an extensively nupported second
choice, also gave the talent a severe Jolt-
Ing by falling to get the place, through
extreme bad horsemanship on the part
of Hennessy. Three firms laid odds In
the rtng and a field book accommodated
the smaller bettors.
Thorpe's weak ride on Shasta Water
would indicate that he has lost his grip.
The mare was a 1 to 2 choice, and at
the head of the stretch it looked as
though she could overhaul San Mateo at
will. The latter, though, won comfort
ably by a couple of lengths in l:42Ms-
Any sort of a price about Thorpe's
mount. Gold Fin. to win the opening five
and a half furlongs selling run looked
long, and the 1 to 2 at first offered was
soon rubbed to 1 to 4. The youngster was
In front from the start, winning without
much in reserve from Petal, the long
6hot of the party, ridden by Frawley.
San Augustine was a fair third.
Another short priced horse was fur
nished in the event following, a seven
and a half furlong affair. Wheel of For
tune, with Jimmy Bozeman In the saddle,
held sway in the betting at odds of 2 to
5, and won without much to spare.
Thorpe on O'Fleta sneaked away from
fÂ£to field at the start and grave the fav
Â£mtÂ» some semblance of a tussle In the
s*2Â« home, being beaten out in a drive
less than two lengths. Hennessy on Red
â¦Jienn was a close third.
A cheap collection of platers started in
B&e third race of the day at five and one
naif furlongs and furnished a perplexing
bettir.g proDlem. In the closing betting
I. sette closed a slight choice over Him
era and Don Luis. A surprise was sprung
in Magnus, ridden by Pedro Enos, which
Kot up in time to beat the favorite a
head on the wire, running loose, at odds
of 15 to 1. Miss Dividend, after making
the running, finished a bang up third.
The big horse, William O'B, took the
concluding race on the card, starting a
6 to 5 chance. He drew away from his
Held at the head of the stretch, winning
easily from Homestake. Lady Brlttanic
earned show honors.
J. J. Lynch, president of the Los Ange
les Agricultural Society, was a spectatoi
at the races to-day and in the course ol
an interview, said that the betting privi
leges at the coming meeting in the south
ern city would be open to all book-makers
who wished to cut in. Mr. Lynch also
said. that he was In receipt of a telegram
from Tommy Keating which stated that
the owner? of the great pacer, John R.
Gentry, were willing 1 to make the triD to
Los Angeles and try conclusions with
Searchlight. The terms were satisfactory
to the management, and this will prob
ably be the big card of the southern

"Several years ago I was troubled with an aggravated case of i
: dyspepsia and, of course, the first thing I did was to consult a physi-
cian. As I had always enjoyed the best of health I was worried a good
deal over i this/; my first illness, and my . only desire was to get well as
speedily as I could. I took regularly all the medicines as my doctof
prescribed them. In a short time I felt all thought I was cured
and stopped taking the medicine. But it wasn't long before I was feel-
; ing as badly ever, and ; again I had recourse to the doctor. This
kept up for some time until at last I made up my mind I would quit
doctoring and try some of the remedies I saw advertised; I had read
so much of Ripans Tabules that I concluded 'I would give I them
a good trial. Jlt said ' one would give relief,' and I : thought if one

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Sept. 22.â The day's market
was largely given over to what are known as
the specialties. There was an upward rush of
prices in these stocks at the opening, but the
evidence of weakness in Sugar, which domi
nates the specialties, quickly brought realizing !
rales. The tone was rather heavy, and at i
times somewhat feverish for the rest of the !
day. Traders who had turned bulllFh on su- i
gar on the supposition t.at the long reaction
was over, made up their minds that the recent i
rise was simply a campaign against the shorts j
and turned sellers again.
The railroad lifts were rather sluggish and
resisted the depression in the specialties, ex
cept for a few Mocks. The Pacifies were not
ably heavy, especially Union Pacific preferred.
This was partly due to the fact that London !
had only Just arrived at the conclusion quite I
definitely formed long ago in Wall street that
the dividend on the preferred stock would be
only 1% per cent. The announcement of the
dividend caused a rally of about a point, the
shorts having evidently awaited the event to I
cover. The decline of over a point In Northern !
Pacific was unexplained, unlÂ»ss a? realizing I
since the second week's statemen* showed earn- |
Ings over $56,000 in excess of last year's high !
level. Northwest's August statement show- '
ing a gross increase of $288,230 over last year's
unprecedented earnings was responsible for j
strength la the Grangers. The process of re- i
lief of the New York money market was con- '
tinu<>(] to-day by further largf engagements of
gold from London, by a debit balance against ;
the sub-treasury of f 1,271,44 1 and by demands i
upon domestic centers. New York exchange i
In Chicago rose from 10c discount to 10c prem- I
lum, call money In London rising % per cent, i
open market discounts there rose % to % per
cent, and the Bank of Kngland raised Its min
imum rateof discount from 2>*tf?S per cent, after
having borrowed largely from the market to
raise the rate to the level of Its own. The
demand for silver dollars for shipment to the !
â West has led to the sub-treasury giving notice ;
that the dollars must he pe;<j for In silver cer- j
tlflrates or treasury notes, since the supply of ;
coin has been nearly reduced to the amount
Of outstanding sliver certificates.
The bond market continued comparatively i
dull, but prices were well held. Total sales !
were |1. 220, 000.
United States seconds declined % and the new '
fours %. while the old fours coupon advanced I
% In the bid price.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW TORK, Sept. 22.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: .The stock
markets here remain lifeless. They opened dull
to-day on a rise in the discount rate of the
Bank' of England from 2%Â©3 Â»er cent. The
rise â¢ surprised .the market, the advance. not be
ing expected till next week. The movement,
however, Is Justified by the bank figures, a.nd
the fact that the bank. Is notv obtaining con
trol of the market is shown by borrowing by
the market from the bank having commenced
to-day, the bank charging 3. per cent for four
days. . The banks and discount houses raised
money rates in sympathy with the bank rate
and the London rate is now 2% per cent.
Americans alone were good during the great
part of the day, bnt they fell away at the
close, chiefly on French selling. The feature
was a sharp relapse in I'nion Pacific, whose
dividend â  is anxiously awaited. Argentines
were easier on unsatisfactory cables concerning
the boundary question, but I am Informed in
the., best quarters that large buying orders
came from Buenos Ayres to-day. Brazils were
better on Improvement in exchange.
Spanish fours were very strong. Negotia
tions are reported "with Rothschild for a fresh
Spanish loan of about Â£5,000,000. If so It will
be on the security "of the Almaden quicksilver
mines.
Details of the' gold movement for the we*k
shows the sale of Â£427.000 in bar gold and of
Â£294,000 In American coin, the export of Â£100.
000 pounds to New York of Â£100,000 to Egypt;
Â£10,000 to South America, of Â£15,000 to Santos,
and of Â£20,000 to Batavla, and the receipt of
Â£30,000 from Australia.
A large bank In Hamburg Is said to have lost
about Â£50,000 in consequence of the advances
made on forged securities.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. 22. â All the weakness which
marked the close of yesterday's Wheat mar
ket had disappeared at the opening to-day,
and was replaced by strength exceeding that
shown for several weeks. Nearly all the fea
tures Influencing the market were distinctly
In favor of the buying side. Liverpool was
strong and higher at the opening, and con
tinued to advance during the day. Paris was
also higher, showing an advance of 25 centimes.
Duluth and other outside markets reported
materially higher prices for the cash article.
Northwestern receipts were as reported, 3^l
cars, against 444 last week and 1134 a year ago.
The figures were afterward corrected to 931
care, but the correction had apparently no
effect on prices. Opening trades for December
ranged from 63%<g64c, compared with yester
day's closing price of 63%c.
This was about at call price, an<l selling
against those privileges caused the market to
hesitate for a short time, a few sales being
made at 63%Â®63%c. That was the low point
of the day. Tha demand of the shorts, which
was good at the opening, grew heavier as the
session progressed, and as no great amount of
Wheat came out a steady upward movement
took place, which did not stop until 64%c had
been bid. At those figures holders began to
let go more freely, and the advance was
checked. Some- selling was caused by re-ports
of rains In the winter belt which were badly
needed, and receipts yesterday and to-day of
220.000 bushels brought here for mixing pur
poses, and which was expected to bring to
grade 1,000,000 bushels or more of low grade
Wheat, was also a slight Incentive to sell,
but not enough to affect prices much. Late
In the day the market, which for some time
previous had been rather quiet, became active
again on reports from New York that eighty
boatloads had been worked for export. Private
London cables reported poor Russian crop
prospects. Buying orders became very heavy
after that and offerings became still more re
stricted. December closed l%*Jl%c and Sep
tember l%c higher.
Corn was steady, with a somewhat better
trade. Shorts were free buyers and there was
a good speculative demand for the long ac
count. The market was Influenced somewhat
by Wheat. The close was %c higher.
There was a large trade in Oats and prices
again advanced sharply. Commission houong
which have recently been large sellers bought
heavily, and the elevator people and shorts
were also free buyers. The cash demand was
excellent.
Provisions were affected by the firmness of
grain and acted as a check on short selling,
and although the demand was light_offerliujs
were more so. December pork closed 2%c
higher, December lard a shade higher and
January ribs 2%c higher.

HER BRITISH
HUSBAND IS
VERY CRUEL
Lady Yarde - Buller
Wants a Divbrce.
SHE HAS A CONFESSION
BTTLLER ADMITS A FE,W OF
HIS PECCADILLOES.
Be Is Now in South Africa and Will
Probably Offer No Defense
of the Suit, as He De
sires Separation.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Sept. 22.
Lady Yarde-Buller wants to be divorced
absolutely from her British husband, who,
Bhe says, is cruel, neglectful and unfaith
ful. Through her attorney and cousin,
Ernest Wakeman, she filed a suit this af
ternoon to be set free on the ground of
desertion and failure to provide.
Some years ago Mrs. Buller applied for
a divorce in England, but only obtained
A judicial separation, a decree nisi being
denied her. Since that time she and her
husband have led widely divergent lives.
Mrs. Buller, whose history Blnco she was
the young daughter of the late General
Kirkham has been published scores of
times, has passed the last few years be
tween Oakland and England. In both
countries she has had peculiar experi
ences in madhouses and prisons
Her husband went to Buluwayo, South
Africa, and is now located there For the
past month his wife has been living with
en old nurse at Eighteenth and Kirkham
streets. A few day? ago she slipped off a
car and hurt her knee, and is now under
medical care.
There is little doubt that Mrs. Buller
will get her decree from the Alameda
court should the legal necessity be
proved, for a portion of the complaint
consists of a confession from her hus
band, which she obtained two years ago
when she came to Oakland. On that oc
oaslon she intended to sue for a divorce,
but refrained from doing so, and on her
return to London occurred those incidents
which gave rise to the scandal which
linked her name with that of Valentine
Gadesden. Her husband's confession, it
is said, contains enough admissions to
â¢upta-n Mrs. Bullor's allegations.
She may experience some difficulty in
proving ihe necessary residence for a
legal time in this city, but otherwise
there will be little opposition, as the
summons will be served by publication
Â«hd Buller hus hinted that he will not
contest, but would r.ither it were granted.
This is Mrs. Buller's second experience
in the divorce court. Her first husband,
whom she married after a little romance.
was Walter Blair who is the father of
her two sons. She was divorced from
him about fifteen years ago, and soon
After married Yarde-Buller.
JOHNSON BEADY.
Will Lay Out a Professor on Suffi-
cient Provocation.
OAKLAND, Sept. 22.â Ex-City Attorney j
Johnson resents the statement of Profes- j
Bor Depue that he connived in the dis
appearance of Depue's son. Depue re-*
â¢Centry TttcaTed his boy In Fresno, and ho |
threatens all kinds of punishment, through !
the courts or personally, on those who '
he alleges were responsible for sending ;
his boy out of Oakland.
"The statements of Depue and his son
ae to my having anything to do with tne
latter's disappearance are wholly false," i
eald Attorney Johnson to-dav, "and if ;
Depue attempts to carry out his throat to
attack me on the street he may regret
It before he gets through with me, for I
shall endeavor" to lay him out for good, i
I never saw his boy in my life, to my

GRIM RELICS OF WAR.
The Sunken Don Juan of Austria Gives Up
Mute Evidence of Dewey's May Day.
IT Is a mute, plain tale that Is told in the relics that J. N. Reid of the
transport Australia has brought with him out of Manila Bay. In a
handful of deadly Mausers, a belt and cartridge box, and a bayonet
with the biood rust still on it, is the story of Dewey's May day and the
dirge that was sung by American Jackies over the floating corpse of Span
ish oppression.
Five months in the sunken, shattered hull of the Don Juan of Austria
has left them salt-soaked and encrusted with the weeda and clinging
barnacles of the southern waters, yet they are as significant of a dread
intent and as potent for harm to-day as when In the hands of the fear
palsied Iberians who carried them with them down into the depths.
As eacii succeeding transport comes home relics from Spain's sunken
warships become less scarce, but, bearing as they do the marks of the
wear and u-ar of years of warfare, as well as the signs of the death and
decay that has come so quickly with their disuse, these relics of Reid's
are of unusual interest and are being eagerly sought by the numerous
private an.l public museums of the city.
Reid tells aninteresting story of the life led by the men ashore and
afloat on the other side, of their work and their pastime and the tales
they recount to the newly arrived volunteer.
"We didn't rare much about going ashore," said Reid. "The Dutch
men made it so unpleasant for us. If an American showed up they doubled
up their fists and made all kinds of mean remarks. We weren't afraid of
them, but simply wanted to avoid- trouble, so we spent most of our time In
one of the ship's small boats fishing with grappling irons and boat hooks
for relics from the hulks of the Spanish warboats. These things that I
have got here came from the ward rooms of the Don Juan, which is the
only boat that we could get at. When she sunk an explosion from the In
side of the ship blew the decks out and left the hold open to any one
who cared to use it for a grab bag, and this most of the fellows who can
get leave from the ship spend their time in doing. The cartridge box is of
the sort that is worn by the Spanish marine and carries 105 rounds of
shell; the "bayonet Is blood-stained, hut where It came from no one can
nay, unless there was some fellow nearer to the ship's boat when the vessel
sank than the man^who carried it â these greasers ain't much on brotherly
love when it comes to a pinch, it's a fact that down at Manila there is
not a man in the army or navy who doesn't believe that most of the
boats were blown up by the Spaniards Just to keep them out of American
hands, and, from what I saw of the wrecks during the three weeks that
I/was there I can't help but believe It. In most cases the decks were
blown clear off, and the contents of the boat could be picked out of the*
water for a hundred yards around."
boy being taken away from Oakland, and
have never known at any time anything
whatever about the boy's whereabouts.
"I have told Mrs. â¢ Depue and her
friends that the father was entitled to
the boy and that the lad could not choose
his own guardian until he was 14, unless
the choice was approved by the court. In
the habeas corpus proceedings recently
brought by the father I acted for the
mother gratuitously, and Judge Ogden
dismissed the proceedings."
J>r. Dille and Myron T. Holcomb also
deny Depue's statement that they helped
to send the boy away.
SOCIALISTS WIN.
A Defective Complaint Sets Editor
Wilkins Free.
OAKLAND, Sept. B. - The Socialist
Labor orators won their first case
in the Police Court to-day, owing
to a defect in the complaint. The
defendant, M. W. Wilkins, was repre
sented by Job Harrlman of Los Angeles,
the Socialist candidate for Governor, and
Attorney King of San Francisco.
After a jury had been obtained. Ser
geant Paterson was put on the witness
stand, and testified to the arrest of the
defendant, who, he said, was speaking on
Tenth street, near Broadway. Attorney
King, for the defense, declared that the
complaint charged Wilkins with speaking
on Broadway, near Tenth, and he asked
for a dismissal on this point. Deputy
District Attorney Moore thought tne
point well taken, but disclaimed the re
sponsibility for the error in the complaint.
nsÂ» the Information had been furnished
him on a slip of paper. Judge Allen di
rected the jury to acquit the defendant.
THE COURT COULD
NOT STOP WITNESS
rTERPRETER'S DILEMMA IN
THE LOUIS WILL CONTEST.
Proponente Will Move for a Non-
Suit Just as Soon as All the
Testimony Has Been
Taken.
OAKLAND, Sept. 22.â 1n the Edouard
Louis will contest to-day before Judge
Hall there was a lively scene. After A.
' L. Barber, Louis Bazet and Frank Hally
I had testified, Mrs. Mariane Louis, the
; aged mother of decedent, took the stand,
i She is the contestant and cannot speak
I or understand English; but it was most
forcibly impressed upon the jury and
1 everybody else that her knowledge of
: French had no limit. "When a question
was asked*hat could be answered yes or
| no, witness would rattle off a volume of
j. rcnch that could not be remembered by
the interpreter, L. Mouet, and that could |
hardly be stopped by the Court, attorneys i
or bailiff. "Well," the Court would re
mark after catching his breath, "I think
some one had better stop her."
At' the suggestion of Attorney R. B. '
Tappan. who together with Geor-"e Reed, |
is appearing for the estate, Attorney A. I
liuof volunteered to act as interpreter. '
He is the attorney on the other side and j
agreed to speak in English only such i
parts of Mrs. Louis" answers as might be I
proper or material. To this Counsel Reed !
strenuously objected, fearing that Mr. i
Ruef might omit more man was good for !
the cause.
Several of thÂ» Jurors understood
French, and now the attorneys fear that !
. their case will be prejudiced as a result '
;of the superfluous testimony given by ;
Mrs. Louis.
It developed from the aged lady's tes- j
timony to-day that the widow of the tee- j
tutor had called on her and offered to '.
pay the $25 monthly allowance agreed to
iby the decendent, but that she refused
| the money "because," as she said, "it
I was already too late," she having com- I
menced the contest. It also apeared that ;
j iurs. Machefaux, daughter of the witness, j
I had considerable to do with commencing j
the contest.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1898.
JEWS RESENT
CRITICISMS BY
THE RABBI
Good Government Is
Not Politics.
SOME WARM RESOLUTIONS
DR. FRIEDLANDER SAID TO BE
MISINFORMED.
Notified Joseph Harris That He
Would Tear the Sixth Ward
Club All to
Pieces.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 22.
The Jewish residents in the Forty
eighth Assembly District have decided
that they will not disband in accord
ance with Rabbi Friedlander's sugges
tion, but will continue along the lino for
which the club was organized. At a meet
ing held in Bet^ Jacob Synagogue thÂ«
following resolution was introduced:
"Resolved, That the Good Government
Club of the Forty-eighth Assembly Dis
trict condemns the action of Rabbi Fried
lander In rushing into print with regard
to the doings of this club, and that we
request the reverend gentleman to attend
to his ecclesiastical affairs, assuring him
that we will take care of our political
affaire."
The rabbi had some friends In the au
dience, and Mr. Harris moved to lay the
resolution on the table. This was de
clared to be gag law, and the oratory
started. H. Davis, an officer of Beth
Jacob, said that the rabbi didn't exactly
know what he was talking about or he
would not have made the remarks ho
did. Several others favored dropping the
matter, but this was. opposed, and Mr.
IsaacÃ in the interest of harmony intro
duced a resolution somewhat less force
ful. It read: "Resolved, That this club
Ignore all criticisms that have come Into
public print with regard to the doings of
this club."
Another bit of discussion followed, and
finally this also was withdrawn, as it was
believed Rabbi Frledlander would not
again undertake to criticize the club.
Joe Harris said he had talked with the.
rabbi previous to the time he had given
out his statement, and he had advised
the rabbi to keep out of the papers re
garding the differences of opinion be
tween himself and the club. "And, fur
ther." said Mr. Harris, "I told him that
when I went to his church he had the
best of me, but that in political matters
and the ways of, this country I could
tell him a thing or two that I had learned
during my thirty years' residence here.
Before the Interview was over the rabbi
told me he would tear the club to pieces."
Isaac Barnett said it was nothing new
for Jews to be condemned and denied po
litical rights; for that reason America
had been a haven to Jews. He believed
they should be permitted to take a hand
in the affairs of government Rabbi
Friedlander notwithstanding.
The discussion ended when one of the
members stated that the club was not
restricted to Jews, but all were welcome
to Join. ____^_____
THE FACULTY'S POSITION
REMAINS AN ENIGMA
THEIB INTENDED SEVEBITY
MAY BE MODIFIED.
Fate of Berkeley Students Who Took
Part in the Bush Still Hang
ing in the Balance.
BERKELEY, Sept. 22.â As yet no new
developments have come out of the case
of the freshmen students in the Univer
sity of California who were yesterday
threatened with expulsion for taking part
in a rush. A gTeat deal of mystery sur
rounds the faculty's intended action In
the matter, and the whole college is on
the qui vive as to what may be done next.
It seems probable, however, that the
committee on students' affairs will be in
clined toward leniency, although the
course they expect to pursue is still un
certain.
This morning the four men who were
| "called up" yesterday were again brought
i before the faculty tribunal, consisting of
Professors Thomas R. Bacon, George C.
: Edwards and William Carey Jones. They
i were asked to repeat their version of the
! ruah, and of the jpart they took in it. At
! the conclusion of the interview the sen
tence of expulsion was temporarily re
moved, but the men were told to hold
themselves In readiness to be "called up"
again at any time.
This action on the part of the students'
â¢ affairs committee is being interpreted
iin two different ways. Many regard it
as a sign that the extreme severity which
at first seemed to face the unfortunate
: men will be quietly released, and their
j cases dropped without further attention.
â  Others, on the contrary, believe it.to.be
a mere breathing spell before a wholesale
: expulsion of juniors, sophomores and
', freshmen is summarily and rigorously
; carried into execution. The small tribu
: nal of three professors, which has been
brought into such sudden prominence
: during the last two days, and which holds
j the fate of one or two hundred students
in its hands, is, however, pursuing its
investigations slowly and cautiously; but
when a decision is reached, either one
way or the other, it is certain that no
' compromise measures will be adopted. If
one man is expelled, one hundred will fol
low, and hence the interest Burrounding
the cases of the four freshman Btudents
who have already been called to account.
While the excitement attendant upon
the first newe of the faculty's action yes
terday has somewhat blown over, the de
termination of those who participated in
the rush to act in concert has grown very
decided. It can be safely said, now, that
if one or two men are expelled, every
student who engaged In last Friday
night's tussle will hand in his time and
withdraw from the university.

Prominent in Alameda.
ALAMEDA, Sept. 22.-Dr. Eugene Ber
taud, who died at his home, 2421 Wash
ington street, San Francisco, yesterday,
resided in this city for several years, and
was a prominent member and director of
the Unitarian Club. He was a man who
had very many friends, a cultivated mu
sician, with a fine barytone voice, always
ready to sacrifice himself at the request
of others. The Unitarian Club deeply
feels his loss, as to him it owed much of
its best musical entertainment. He leaves
a father and mother, three brothers and
two sisters.
Narrowly Escaped Death.
ALAMEDA, Sept. 22.â Stanley Stephen
son of 2225 San Jose avenue had a most
miraculous escape from death last night
by coming in contact with a live electric
wire He. with his father and brother-in
law, was standing at the corner of .f ark
street and Santa Clara aveniie, awaiting
the arrival of a streetcar. Mr. Stephen
son noticed that the arc electric light was
not burning so brightly as It should, and
grabed the wire cable used for hoisting
the light, intending to Jar the carbon
down in the lamp, thereby increasing the
contact. Mr. Stephenson relates a thrill
ing experience:
"I felt myself drawn all up in a bunch,"
he said. "I remember shrieking to my
brother-in-law for help, then a relaxation
of the muscles, and all was blank."
Mr. Stephenson's brother-in-law grabbed
him around the waist and by main force
released him from the wire. Both men
fell limp to the ground. Bystanders said
both men were a blaze of electricity as
they lav upon the sidewalk. Mr. Stephen- |
son had a bad burn on one of his hands,
and he says he will never interfere with
the electric wire again, If every light in
the city goes out.
Republican Meeting.

WILLIAM CORBITT DEAD.
The Famous San Mateo Horseman
Passes Away. .
â William Corbitt. one of the leading
trotting horse breeders , of California, '
died on Wednesday at San â  Mateo. As j
proprietor of the San â  Mateo stock farm \
he achieved a world wide reptation, and j
with the | late Senator Stanford shared j
the honor of breeding the greatest num- j
ber of ; champion > trotterÃ in America.
Mr. / Corbitt was '; born in Scotland sev- I
enty-three years ago , and came with his j
parents to Canada when an infant. At ;
the early age of 9 he was an orphan and i
compelled to earn a livelihood on a farm. !
At 14 ho embarked in business trading in i
stock and produoe, and 'In- a ; few years
had acquired a fortune. Early in â  the
BO's he came to Calif ornla < and - settled
in Los Angeles. He engaged in a commis
sion and general merchandizing business, j
and .became the owner of over 190,000 1
acres of land ln Southern California, in- i
cluding the lands occupied by the Santa
Anita stock farm and L. J. Rose's famous
farm Rosemeade. ' ' ~~ * â¢
The drought of 1864 and consequent
heavy losses in crops and livestock
caused Mr. Corbitt and his partner, Mr.
McLeay. to dispose of their large hold
ings. They moved to Portland, ,Â» Oregon,
and. on their arrival started In business. [
Again they were successful, and in a few
years they had the " largest mercantile
house In the Ndrthwest. V . *
About 1873 Mr. Corbitt returned to Call
; f ornia and purchased 440 â¢ acres kof .*'.- land
near jirhat is now. . Icaown as , Burllng-amo,
and made it a model Btock farm. 1 He pur
â¢chased : the Hambletonlan .stallions Irv
ington and. Arthurton. paying $30,000 for
themâ price considered enormous at the
time. 'He selected ' his brood mares with
few exceptions among the California r bred
Ones, claiming ' they " oQght ' to Burpass
those bred -in . the East. ' â  No ; bÂ»tter evi
dence of. the wisdom of.. hiH choice is
needed than the records which show- that
from .them he. bred, champions of all
ages.
In 1882 he bought Guy Wilkes. This
great horse proved the beet Investment
in horseflesh ne ever made. The progeny
of Guy Wilkes ln five years on the turf
won in races the sum of $119,156, while
that of his son, Sable Wilkes. won $06.
000 more. It is asserted that Mr. Corbitt
realized over $450,000 from the sale of
horses from his farm.
The deceased was a widower. He leaves
three daughters. One is the wife of Lieu
tenant Colonel C. L. Best, another Is Mrs.
Beverly McMonagle, and the youngest is
married to J. C. Moody.
AMERICA SHOULD RULE.
Should Force the Evacuation of
Manila by the Spanish Troops.
James Jack, superintendent of the well- '
known rice plantations of Smith, Bell &
Co., located fourteen miles from Manila,
was among yesterday's arrivals on the
steamship China.
Mr. Jack cays the situation is still I
ominous in that section of the world, and,
knowing the prevailing sentiment, be
lieves that with the withdrawal of Spnn
ish troops from the islands will dawn an
inclination on the part of the rebels to
su mit to American rule.
Regarding the retention of the islands
by the United tates the rice-planter said:
"The English colony, to a unit, believes i
that thÂ© United States, having taken pos
session of the Islands, should by all
means retain them. In this belief 'they
have the hearty accord of the German
and native merchants, as well as many
Spanish of the mercantile class. Most of i
Aguinaldo's own soldiers would desert ,
him did they not fear awful conse- !
quences.
"The rebels are unfit to set up a stable
form of government, and should Spain be
permitted to resume her power she would
mete out vengeance with a lash of scor
pions. It would be fatal to the Interests
of the commercial world should the Unit
ed States segregate the islands and an
nex Luzon only.

Fought For Her Dog.
A quarrel over a dog in the yard of the

LAW FOR THE " PREYING PRESIDENT."
A Chicago Decision That Ought to Satisfy Mr.
Valentine That His Methods Are Illegal.
MR. VALENTINE, the "preying president" of Wells, Fargo & Co.
Express Company, wants some law on the question as to whether
his company is liable for the war tax. Not content with the
opinion of his paid attorney that the company is clearly liable
and the further evidence of that is his own action in ordering
his corporation to pay the tax on newspaper packages rather than have
the local papers carry the matter Into the courts, Mr. Valentine still con
tinues to sandbag those of his customers who are afraid to make any out
cry, and by threats of raising the tariff on them to a point that would
pay the war tax ton times over bullies them Into submission.
If the "preying president" is really afraid of violating the law by hav
ing his company nfflx the necessary revenue stamp, or if he thinks he can
raise the tariff at will in order to cinch such of his patrons as object to
being held up by him, and is looking for some law on the case, let him
turn to the recent decision of Judge Tuley of the Circuit Court of Cook
County, Illinois, in the case of the Western Wheel Works vs. the United
States Express Company. That decision ought to satisfy even the rapa
cious Mr. Valentine that his mode of plundering his patrons ia illegal,
and that he cannot even Jump rates on them at his own sweet will.
Commenting on this decision undtr the head of "Current Topics," the
Albany Law Journal, one of the most able publications of the kind in
this country, says:
The dwtÃlon of Judge Tuley of the-Clrcuit Court of Cook County, 111.. In West
ern Wheel Works vs. The United States Express Company, holds that, under the
war revenue act of IS3B, express companies are required to issue receipts to shippers,
and as part thereof to afflx ami cancel the stamp required by the law. No other
decision was to have been expected under the circumstances. The court's reasoning
Is to us conclusive, and certainly it Is vigorous. "It would be an absurd conclu
sion," remarks the court, "to say that the company is required to issua to the ship
per an unstamped bill of lading or receipt, the Issue of which is made a penal offense
by section 7 of the act. It was not the intent of the statute to place the express
companies under an obligation to do an Illegal act. The bill of lading or receipt
which the exprefs company Is to issue must be a complete bill of lading, a legal
Instrument, find this can only be a stamped instrument."
Anticipating that the companies affected might attempt to saddle upon the public
the burden of the tax. by revising the rates of transportation. Judge Tuley holds
that a common carrier cannot arbitrarily revise and Increase its rates for trans
portation so as to lmpoee the war tax upon the shippers, and thus relieve the car
rier from the payment of the tax imposed by law. On the question of mandamus
the court holds that as the relator company Is enpaged In a business which requires
it to send by express about 200 parcels a day, to compel it to seek a mandamus as to
Â«aeh shipment would be a mere travesty upon the administration of Justice, leaving
the weak â that is, the shipper â at the mercy of the strong. As to the question of a
continuing mandamus, which the court In this case granted. Judge Tuley referred to
Nelson vs. Chicago and Alton Railroad Company, C. &N. W. Ry. Co. \ - s. People
(56 111., 365), and Vincent vs. Chicago and Alton C49 111., M).
The decision Is generally accepted by the Eastern express companies
as a correct interpretation of the law, and although an attempt may be
made to carry the case to the Supreme Court of the United States, It
will be for the sole purpose of keeping the issue under a cloud as long as
possible, and not with any hope of a final reversal of the trial courfs
decision.
Judge Tuley unequivocally states that the law clearly Intended the ex
press companies to pay the tax; that they are obliged to issue a com
plete bill of lading, or receipt, arid such is not a complete instrument un
til the stamp is affixed. Moreover, he denies the right of the company to
advance its rates at will In order to cover the war tax in that manner.
The attention of Mr. Valentine is respectfully drawn to this decision, as
he may have overlooked it, for it Is certainly explicit enough to satisfy
even his craving for an expression of law In the case. If that does not con
vince the "preying president" of the error of his ways. Justice of the
Peace Barry will, in all probability, clinch the matter when he renders his
decision in the case of Williajn Costley vs. Wells, Fargo & Co., which is
based on identically the same points as the Chicago suit, and which he Is
expected to render early next week.
HEALTH BOARD
SEEKS TO GET
MORE MONEY
Will Try to Influence
the Supervisors.
HOPES TO HAVE $10,000 MORE
NO EMPLOYES TO BE DIS
CHARGED AT PRESENT.
Investigatlon of All Brands ol Chew
ing Gum on the Market to
Be Made t>y the
Board.
That fifteen or twenty employes of the
Health Department will be discharged, In
order to reduce expenses to the limit or
the appropriation determined upon by the
Supervisors now seems a foregone con
clusion. It was stated yesterday _by an
official prominently identified with the
department that considerable pressure
was brought to bear on the members of
the board prior to the Wednesday night
meeting to defer action looking to a re-
Suction of the force until an opportunity
had been afforded certain lnfluentla per
sons to labor with the Supervisors to in
crease the appropriation to the limit of
last year. As no department appropria
tions have yet been formally made, it Is
regarded as ' possible to secure a recon-
"atlon of the cut heralded In the esti
mates for the tax levy.
The persons who have undertaken to
convince the Supervisors of their alleged
mistake will point to the fact that the
$10 000 reduction in the Health Depart
ment's appropriation will result in the
crippling of the system of inspection as
now carried on, as fully two-thirds of the
Inspectors will have to be discharged and
the work In the pure food branch of. the
â ervice almost totally suspended.
In case It is found after a quiet canvass
of the Supervisors that no more money
can be had. then the Health Board will
â¢proceed to cut down Its, force of inspec
tors and will dismiss several other at-
proclaiming the fact through the
newspapers that the Supervisors : have
Thrown down the guteS which barred out
disease With- the possible exception of
Mayor Phelan. who declines to express
himself, the other members of the Board
of Health are strongly opposed, to there
duction of the appropriation this year.
Following the crusade against the res
taurant kitchens, the health authorities
will Investigate certain lines of Prepared
food looking for adulterations. This
branch of reiearch will be more vigorous
ly pressed than ever before, owing to a
recent ruling of the courts, defining an In
creased â¢ power in this direction lor the
Health Board. The chemical laboratory Is
being very much enlarged and consider
able new apparatus has been secured for
the use of ChemiÃt Green, who will make
- analyses of many kinds of . food. The
board has determined to hold â on .to â  the
chemist, no matter what other employes
m As one important item the chemist will
As one important Item the chemist will
undertake the â¢ analysts of the various
brands of chewing gum now sold on the
San Francisco market, including the so
called pepsin. gums. This step is due to
-a- complaint filed that certain chewing
Kums are detrimental to health, contain
ing ingredients that are harmful and un
fit for placing In the mouth. Some of the
-pepsin gums contain no pepsin according
lo the complaint and the gum itself is
adulterated instead of being pure.
A dispatch from London a few days ago
â¢ stated that the sale of certain brands of
American chewing gums had been pro
hibited because, of objectionable ingredi
ents found therein. As the gum-chewing
habit has developed recently to a great
extent in England in imitation of .â ; the
American the English health authori
ties have 'begun the inspection of the va
rious brands, with the result that some
were found to bepure, but others com
pounded of vile ingredients. In this coun
try the chewing gums have so far escaped
that inspection that has beer, given to all
food products, â¢ possibly on the ground
that it was'not an eatable article, but as
It nevertheless enters the mouths of half
the citizens of the United :, States â  every
day, the advisability of a careful inspec
tion becomes self-evident. So â  far -?' any
person has been at liberty to put chewing
gums on the market and, manufacture the
name out of vile refuse or proper ingredi
ents, as he might see fit. ; ..'y- â¢-:Â» :.:
v ; "You can state that the \ health authorl
ties have taken steps to look into the
chewing gum sold In this city," remarked
Dr. Gallwey yesterday. "It Is a proper
subject for investigation. The analysis
of the many different kinds will take
some time, but I think that It will be ac
complished within a few weeks."
SEVEBAL FIBEMEN FINED.

gine as the Appropriation Will
Not Stand It
An unusual number of tines were Im
posed upon firemen at the meeting of
the Fire Commissioners yesterday after
noon. Henry Welsh of Engine 1 and
Frank McCluskey of Engine 17 were fined

anywhere else.
QBAND JUBY AT WOBK.
Hears Evidence Against the Tennes-
see Soldiers.
The grand jury was busy Thursday
afternoon with the cases of the Tennessee
soldiers who were implicated In the as
sault upon the negro, Thomas. Several
officers of the regiment were in attend
ance all of the afternoon, but the Jury
made poor progress toward fixing the
crime upon any particular Individuals.
The officers examined were still suffering
from the effects of fog on the retina and
could not say with certainty Just which
soldiers were the most aggressive.
It was reported that the officers would
refuse to come to see the Jury any more
having been told that the civil courts
could not compel their attendance on a
grand Jury sitting, while they were stop
ping on the Government reservation.
It was rumored that the Jury had look
ed Into the matter of the $310 pickle and
sauce deal between W. S. Wood and \V
Cowen, wherein the latter came out loser
Wood advertised for a partner in the
pickle buslneps at 304 Battery street and
Cowen responded. Subsequently Cowen
claims to have discovered the entire
assets of the firm in which he had pur
chased a 5310 interest consisted of a few
empty barrels.
To Aid Captain Bichter's Family.
Preparations have been completed for

from the parade of the Kansas Regi
ment. Colonel Funston commanding to
the singing by the Glee Club of the Po'lice
Department. Interest in the entertain

George Green, who is known as the
"police fighter," was yesterday convicted
by Judge Mogan on charges of battery

vagrancy, and he fought bo hard that
Policeman John McGee went to Murphv's
assistance. Green bit McGee on the fin
ger and continued his fighting until it re
quired six policemen to take him to
prison. Every time he 1b arrested he
shows fight. The Judge will likely give
him six months on each charge when he
appears for sentence this morning.

The transport China arrived from Ma
nila via Hongkong and Nagasaki yes
terday. Those who came up on the vessel
were: Major General F. V. Greene, Cap
tain W. G. Bates, Lieutenant S. Schlfflin,
Major General J. B. Babcock, Major S.
D. Sturgis, Captain Theodore Rethers, M.
D., Chief Engineer Gait of the Charles

minger, H. R. Thomas, C. Albrecht, C. D.
Whitehead, F. McCann, J. K. Jenkins,
H. E. Brown, C. B. Russell and M. Gable.
Senors F. Agonclllo and S. Lopez are
the flnaucial agents of General Agulnaldo.
They will go from here to Washington In
the hope of conferring with President Mc-
Klnley. From there they will go to
Paris to attend the peace conference.
Murat Halstead is correspondent for
the New York Herald. At Honolulu ho
was taken sick, but afterward recovered
sufficiently to proceed to Manila. At the
latter place he was again taken sick, so
I he came back home. J. Jack is a mem
ber of the firm of Smith, Bell & Co., mer
chants of Manila, and was enabled to
make the "trip to San Francisco through
the courtesy of General Merritt. C. D.
Whlteheud has the honor of having been
I the first United States soldier to land in
i the Philippines during the war. He has
been Invalided home. 11. Wolfe went
from San Francisco with General Greene
as interpreter.
Generul Merritt and his staff went as
far as Hongkong on the China. At that
point they took one of the Peninsular and
Oriental steamers and went direct to
Paris. M. Gable, who came here on the
China, was General Merritts servant.
He is going through to Chicago and car
ries ah the general's private correspond
ence.
When the China reached Nagasaki the
transport fcealandia was on the dry dock.
Aftrr leaving Manila the latter vessel
wus caught in a typhoon and had her
machinery and rudder post damaged. The
China left Nagasaki on the 6th lust., and
it was expected then that another three
weeks would be required to complete the
repairs to the Zeaiandia.
It is not known yet whether the China
will go back to Manila as a transport or
not. The Mail Company has her sched
uled to sail for Hongkong via Honolulu
and Yokohama, but the Government
seems determined to keep her, and in that
event Â«he will carry troops to Manila. |
She is in first-class order and could be j
got ready to go to sea again in four or ;
live days at the outside.
An opposition line to the Pacific Coast ]
Steamship Company has started in the !
Puget Sound trade. It will run a steamer
every seven days, and has begun by cut- !
ting" the first-class passenger rate to $12 i
and the second-class to 17. The new line
will run the steamers Charles Nelson.
Cleveland and Lakme. The former two
will carry freight and passengers and the
Lakme will carry freight and combusti
bles only. The steamers will run direct to
Tacoma and Beattle, and will connect at
those points with other steamers for all !
Puget Sound ports. E. T. Kruse, the j
agent of the new line, and J. Tyson, who |
represents Captain Charles Nelson, went j
north a few weeks ago and looked the
ground over. The result of their tour !
was the placing of the Charles Nelson, i
Cleveland and Lakme on the route in op
position to the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company.
M O'Day and J. Meyer had a narrow
escape from drowning yesterday. They
drove down to Mission 1 wharf with a ,
horse and wagon and got under the j
bunkers to secure a load of coal. The
hone took fright at a steamboat whistle i
and backed the wagon and the men in it .
overboard. Luckily the men were res
cued but the wagon took the horse down
and the animal was drowned. The horse
and wagon went down in the Falls of Af
ton's berth and as that vessel was ex
pected to dock inside of half an hour 1
Assistant Chief Wharfinger Scott notl- j
fled O'Day and Meyer that they would |
have to get the wagon and harness up as
quickly as possible. They failed to do bo |
and the big 2000-ton ship is now on top j
of horse, harness and wagon.
The British ship Vlmeira, 157 days from
Antwerp, had a rough trip of it. She
passed Cape Horn 74 days out and then j
had a succession of heavy gales for 21 |
days. On July 14 she was caught in a hur
ricane that lasted 4S hours, during which
nearly a whole suit of sails was blown j
away.
The schooner Helen N. Kirnball arrived I
from Apia yesterday. On the 18th inst.
in latitude 36.57 north, longitude 127.30
west. F. Lemm, the cook, died from a
I hemorrhage. The deceased had some rel
! atlves in San Francisco and the captain
| thought he could reach port with the re
mains. When off Point Reyes last Wed
nesday the body had to be consigned to
the sea.
The big raft containing 3,500.000 feet of

The British ship Balasore. 171 days from
Newcastle, England, the Caithness-shire.
71 davs from Newcastle, Australia, and
the barkentlne Irmgard, 21 days from
Honolulu, got in yesterday.
Captain McMurtry, the popular master
j of the new river steamer, H. J. Corco-
I ran. is back at his post after a six weeks'
! vacation In Fresno County. The gallant
captain wanted to get as far away as
possible from old ocean, so he took his
wife and family along and camped In a
spot 9000 feet above the level of the sea.
On August 30 he says the grass around
his camp was covered with frost and on
September 5 a bucket of water left out
over night had ice on It In the morning.
Cantaiti McMurtry is a mighty hunter
and the cabin of the Corcoran is to be
decorated with skins of animals killed by
him during his vacation. The principal
trophies are the skins of a doer, moun
tain lion and bear. .Tunt as Captain Mc-
Murtry had drawn a sight on the deer,
the mountain lion sprang on the unsus
pecting animal. The captain fired and.
ptrange to say. both animals rolled over
dead. Just then the bear came out of a
thicket, and, without a pause, the captain
fired .again. Over rolled the bear and now
McMurtry has the three skins as proof
of his prowess.

BLANCHE BATES MAY
HAVE A NEW PAPA
The Popular Actress* Mamma Would Marry Mark Thall,
the Alcazar Manager.
MARK Thnll and Providence willing, and pretty clever Blanche Bates,
the popular leading lady of the Frawley company, is no longer a
half orphan.
Mrs. Bates has offered her hand, her heart and her fortune to the â 
Rental Alcazar manager and waits in hopeful patience for the day when â 
she may call htm her very own.
The actress in her ardent wooing hat? opened up new and wondrous -
fields in the world of courtship, and incidentally created a new occtipa- â¢
tion for childrenâ the acceptance or refusal of a suitor for a parent's hand. â 
As In all affairs of the heart, strenuous efforts were made by the inter- â 
ested parties to keep the romance a!l to themselves, but as in every â¢
love story, the little bird that heard and knows all twittered the tale to â¢
a curious world.
There Is no engagement as yet to announce. Thall, popularly known
as the genial Mark, refuses to bare his manly bosom to Cupid's darts as
manufactured by Mamma Bates, and is as coy as a debutante and as shy â¢
as a country lass.
The widow, however, is persistent. Many times has she tempted the â 
hard-hearted manager and many times returned to the attack. Failure â 
but goads her on. "Little Billee" asked "Trilby" thirteen times before she â 
consented to make him the happiest of mortals, and why may not the â 
Bates persistence meet with the same frrntfying results?
One great step In this strange courtship has been already successful. â¢
Charles Thall, the thirteen-year-old youngster that calls Mark papa, has â 
been diplomatically approached and has given with alacrity his consent. â¢
"Would you like me for a mother?" said the father's admirer, to the â¢
brtght-eyod youngster. "11l give you all the money you want and -
a latchkey." The latchkey did it and, as far as Charlie is concerned, -
Blanche Bates may look upon him as her now brother.
Rumor has it that Mrs. Bates' wooing has met with many annoying â 
diversities, principally among â¢ which Is the constant intrusion of Belascoâ â¢
Jn the very midst of most impassioned scenesâ to summon the recreant -
Mark to the telephone. Gossip â always so unreliable â goes on further- â¢
more to state that a little button, manipulated by Thall, summons thÂ« â¢
faithful partner and that the Interruptions are planned with all the at- -
tention to d'-iil that characterizes a stage rehearsal. Â«
"Let's get married," says Mamma Bates, "let's. I have property -
and I will give it all to you. Eh, oh; let's? What do you say?" and then -
comes Belasoo with the tale of the telephone to spoil It all.
Thall, the unresponsive recipient of the outpourings of the Bates car- -
diac. refuses to discuss the passion of which he is the victim. When -
questioned he Just blushes, a progressive blush that gradually dyes him -
a roseate tinge from chin to brow, and says nothing. Eloquent silence!
Historyâ otherwise Rumor, alias Gossipâ sayeth not whether Blanche -
was consulted In the Papa Thall question, though it is faithfully recorded -
that Charlie Thall waits with impatience for his new mamma and his -
latch key. ,

From the statement of Henry C. Hall,
one of Colorado's most prominent attor

the estate, find tt to be valued at $240,
007 85. The largest items follow: Mon
eys which have come Into the hands of
the executrix of the estate, Including
$11,690 life insurance, $17,956 43; house
hold furniture, $4262 00: ZOO shares capital
stock Pacific Telephone and Telegraph
Company, $14,000; 211 shares capital stock

ital stork Colusa County Bank. $65,300; w
shares capital stock of the Bank of Hay
wards, $6000; lot of land at Washington
and GouKh streets vadued at $60,000; an
undivided half of lot 4 of the Hastings
Tract. Colusa County, valued at $7800;
lands in Washington Township, Alameda
County, valued at $22,275 S2. The balance
of the estate ts composed of promissory
notes, small rwl estate holdings and
stocks and bonds.
That the deceased capitalist was In the
habit of assisting his friends without de
manding security in any form Is mani
fest. A Dumber of promissory notes Is
sued at various times are noted as worth
less, and the appraisers state that a judg
ment against W. H. H. Hart for $10,5G7
is difficult to appraise, as no way exists
by which the value of the Judgment can
be determined. A note Issued by J. C.
Goad for $5500 Is on the doubtful list, and
the notes issued by the following cred
itors of the estate are appraised as val
ueless: B. B. Glascock. $6SS4; B. B. New
man. $8000: C. E. Chittenden, $85; E. Cof

FIRST IN
PEACE AND
FIRST IN WAR
Californians at Manila
Highly Praised.
AT THE FRONT IN EVERYTHING
WHETHER IT BE FIGHTING OB
MERRY MAKING.
Dr. Rethers, Surgeon of the First,
Brings Cheering News of the
Brave Boys From This
City.
Dr. Theodore Rethers of the First'Cali
fornia Volunteers was among the distln
guished passengers on board the trans
port China, which arrived yesterday from
Manila by way of Hongkong.
The doctor is enthusiastic in his praise
of the n\anly and soldierly qualities of
the men who represent this State in the
Orient. He says that he but voices the
sentiments of everybody who is brought
In contact with them. The health of the
Californians has been excellent, chiefly
owing to the good care they have taken
of themselves, both in their diet and
bathing.
"The men were entirely free from
sickness when they arrived at the Phil
ippines," said Dr. Rethers yesterday.
"There was only one case to be sent to
the hospital, and that was a man who
had been injured by a fall on shipboard.
The second expedition was far from being
bo fortunate, there being 110 men who
had to be transferred at once to the
hospital. Their ailments were of all
kinds, typhoid fever and spinal meningi
tis claiming the majority of the victims,
however.
"The camp was healthy, no disease de
veloping there but being imported on the
transports. Wmle 1 was there It was
the winter season, and the heavy raiiiÃ
kept the air comfortable. The dry
â¢weather is approaching rapidly and with
It will come the intense heat of the trop
ics. How the men will stand that is a
question. The chief trouble has been
â brought on through the eating of fruit
at other than meal times, and the drink
ing 01 water that has not been boiled.
The moderate eating of fruit and only
at meal times benetits the men. This
Is especially the case with bananas.
"The men wl.o were In the trenches for
any length of time developed skin dis
ease that yielded to simple remedies.
"The First California Regiment has
been well named. It 1b first In every
thing, and the gallant boys have received
a fuM measure of praise from all who
have been brought in contact with them.
They were the first to go to the aid of
thf I'Â«ini>\ hunians when they were in
drsperate straits and saved them from
complete annihilation. A battalion of
the i irst was the first to enter the city
of Manila. They went farther than they
wert ordered In their eagerness, but hap
pily nothing serious resulted."
"Each night the Spanish and insurgents
fought, tho latter usually being the first
to commence hostilities. The Spanish
usually wailed until the others fired and
then airbed at the spot where they
6aw the flash. Colonel Smith Issued posi
tive orders to his men not to tire until
fired upon. After that the Spanish did
not trouble them, indicating that they
lired only when attacked."
L'p to the present time the troops have
ha<l but little amusement, their duties
keeping them busy at all times. With the
apparent end of hostilities they do not
take kindly to the prosaic duty of polic
ing Maniia. For this from 1200 to 1500 men
are required at a timo. The boys are
commencing to display signs of homesick
ness and would gladly welcome word that
they were to be mustered out. They are
now living in barracks which they have
fitted up in houses in various parts of the
city. Just before we left the California
boys gave, a minstrel show, the first en
tertainment since the troops reached tho
Islands."
"The order to send additional troops to
the Philippines was a surprise to tis
â¢when we landed here. General Merrttt
cabled that he did not require any more.
"The stand of Agulrmldo Is hard to de
termine. So many rumors are flying
about Manila and each In its turn denied
by those in authority. American Consul
"Wildman at Hongkong is an admirer of
Agulnaldo and Is credited with believing
his stand a correct one. Some say that
there are three factions of the Insurgents
â¢within six miles of Manila, who do not
owe allegiance to Aguinaldo. The Insur
gents must leave all their arms behind
when they enter the city, but no restric
tions are placed on their going out. They
may resemble a walking arsenal and
nothing is said about It.
"Colonel James Smith was highly hon
ored by being made provost marshal of
the northern district of Manila. He ad
ministers the law as In a court of jus
tice.
"Father McKinnon, the chaplain of the
regiment, is a noble man and Is beloved
of the boys. He walked alone up to the
gates of the city before It was taken. He
â was fired upon repeatedly before It was
discovered that he was a priest. lie Is
popular among the men of all creeds"
Dr. Rethers will resign from the service
and resume the practice of his profes
sion in this city. He was formerly asso
ciated with the late Dr. Morse.
Taxes *n Inheritances.
Chief Justice Beatty of the Supreme
Court yesterday made an order for the
rehearing of the Stanford estate matter.
Involving the taxation of the Inheritances
of the nephews and nieces of the deceased
; millionaire. A few months ago Judgment
â was given in the Superior Court against
j^the estate for the taxes claimed to be due,
â  but this decision, so far as the nephews
and nieces were concerned, was reversed
by the Supreme Court. The application
tor a rehearing was asked by Attorney
General Fitzgerald, who took" the posi
tion that the State was one of the prin
cipal parties interested, and he, as repre
sentative of the State, had never received
any official notice of the action, and judg
ment was rendered without the State be
ing represented.
A Big Block of Money.
Tax Collector Block filed his annual re
port with the Supervisors yesterday. He
reported collections amounting to $5,482,
6f>B 15 for the twelve months ending June
30, 1898. His office expenses amounted to
SfiO.lsÃ 98.

THIRD DIVISION
WILL ADVOCATE
GENERAL MILLER
Want Him Made a
Major General.
THEY WILL USE INFLUENCE
CAPTAIN PRATT APPOINTED
MUSTERING OFFICER.
The Seventh California Regiment
Will Leave for Los Angeles
Probably on Tuesday of
Next Week.
Major General Merrlam yesterday re
ceived official confirmation of the fact
that Brigadier General Miller will go to
Manila in command of the contingent of
the expeditionary forces, now at the Pre-
Eidio, that have been ordered to the Phil
ippines. General Miles, acting under the
Instructions of the Assistant Secretary
of War, caused Adjutant General Cor.bin
to send the following official dispatch,
which was received by General Merrlam
yesterday morning:
WASHINGTON. D. C. Sept. 22, 1898.
Commanding General, Department of Califor
nia, San Francisco, Cal. : Your telegram con
cerning General MHIt received. Acting Secre
tary of AVar directs you give necessary orders
for General Miller to go with contingent of ex
peditionary forces now In Sa.n Kranci&co. By
command of Major General Miles.
H. C. CORBIN. Adjutant General.
This means that General Miller will be
the general officer of the division
that has been ordered to Manila. He will
go with the last of the troops to leave,
and, as he stated yesterday, his depart
ure will In all probability mean that an
other jreneral officer will be ordered hero
from the EaÃt to take hia place. Who
this officer will be General Miller does not
know.
As Intimated yesterday in The Call the
effort to have General Miller made a
major general has taken definite shape,
and as ne is to command a division there
does not appear any reasonable objection
aa to why he should not be made one.
Colonel Funston, of the Twentieth Kan
sas Regiment, and his officers, have qUiet
ly begun to use their political influence
at Washington, and it is known that the
officers of the Tennessee and lowa regi
mentÃ will also bring to bear their influ
ence to secure the major generalship for
General Miller. The troops to go. consti
tute a division and the officers and men,
alike are desirous of serving under Gen
eral Miller, and they will leave no stone
unturned to accomplish their ends. They
are inclined to think that in view of the
general's long and brilliant career as an
officer in the regular army and his abil
ity, that little or no difficulty will be ex
perienced in having him ma;le a major
general. Although it is not known, it is
a fact, that the influence of the most
Influential of the Western Senators has
been invoked, and it 1r said that they
will indorse General Miller.
Captain Pratt, who is engaged on spec
ial duty in mustering out the Seventh
California Regiment, nas been notified
that he has been appointed chief muster^
ing officer for the State, with his head
quarters at Los Angeles. Captain Danes,
who is mustering out the Sixth California
Regiment, will nereafter have to report
to Captain Pratt. The latter says he haa
received no orders to cease mustering out
the Seventh, and he does not think that
any such orders will be issued. The regi

absence without leave, was sentenced to
be confined at hard labor under a post

the acusecd not guilty of specifications al

plea or not guilty by the accused without
calling other soldiers whose testimony

custom, after a hole has been drilled Into
rock for the purpose Of blasting, to
"spring" or widen the hole at the bottom,
in order that the proper charge of powder
may be tamped into it. A small charge
of Ki-T-nt powder is nut into the hole and
tamped with a stick. Then a fuse is
lighted and the explosive discharged,
after which the debris is taken out of thÂ«
hole and the regular blast charge ol
powder is inserted.
It appears that Flynn lighted one end
of a piece of fuse, three feet long, and
proceeded to tamp the small charge of
powder while the fuse was burning, he
thinking that he could get away before
the fuse burned down. A spark must
have been knocked from the burning fuse
and ignited the springing charge. The
explosion broke the stick into two pieces
and sent both pieces, each about four feet
long, through nis neck, severing the jug
ular and carotid arteries and killing him
Instantly.
Flynn was a native of Ireland, aped
nbout ."55 years. He was a single man, and
lived in the contractors' camp at Ninth
avenue, between A street and Point Lobos
avenue.

THE WHIPPING POST SHOULD
HAVE THIS INHUMAN BRUTE
Miguel Esqueda Beats His Wife
Because She Refuses to
Support Him.
THE whipping post would be a fit
ting punishment for the crimes
that are charged against
Miguel l^squeda. Crimes savor
ing more of brutality are seldom
committed in this city, and the
Police Court calendars contain the
records of many deeds of brutality
that have made even the most hard
ened criminals weep. The charges
against Esqueda are known in
criminal jurisprudence as battery,
threats against life and assault to
do grievous bodily harm, but they
do not half tell the story. Mrs.
Esqueda, the wife of the brute,
makes the charges. Yesterday
morning she appeared before Judge
Conlan, supported bv friends, and
with her face and body a mass of
cuts and bruises, and swore to the
warrants charging her husband
with the most villainous of crimes.
Mrs. Esqueda is of Spanish blood
and does not speak the English
language. Through an Interpreter
she told her story to the court.
She is a cook and for several
ypars she had been employed by
numerous Spanish families. She
MILLIONAIRE
ON A SMALL
NINE THOUSAND
SwiftwaterÃill'sClaim
to Distinction.
NOW HE IS IN TROUBLE
SUIT FILED AGAINST HIS ALAS-
KAN COMPANY.
One of Bill's Employes Seeking to
Recover Some of What
He Has Paid
Out.
A novel suit has been brought in the
Justices' Courts by J. J. Boyle, a returned
Klondiker, against the Alaska Transpor
tation, Trading and Mining Company, of
which "Swlftwater Bill" was the main
stay.
Boyle seeks to recover $299 99 from the
company, alleging that it really owes him
$2859, on an agreement to furnish work in
the Klondike district at $15 per day.
Boyle says that he went over the Chil
koot Pass last February as one of a party
of twenty-four men who had each paid
$500 to the company for passage down the
Yukon to Dawson and a promise of work
in the company's mines pn the Klondike,
which had been purchased from "Swift
water." At Lake Bennett the agent of
the company dropped the party and most
of them got down to Dawson as best they
could. Arriving there they found "Swift
water," who, according to Boyle, laughed
at them and said there was no work for
them. Most of the party remained in
Dawson but Boyle came- out and has be
gun his suit against the company, which
includes among its stockholders W. G.
Henshaw, W. P. Troy, Henry Wadsworth
and other prominent citizens.
While the fact is not generally known
outside of Dawson, it is a matter of com
mon knowledge in the mining camp that
"Swiftwater" has been greatly overrated
as a bonanza king. When he left Daw
son lost year to make his since celebrated
pilgrimage out to "the States," he bor
rowed $5000 of his partner Bill Liggett,
paying that he only had $4000 cash on
hand and that it was not enough for a
miner who wanted to spend a winter in
San Francisco. Liggett agreed with him
and loaned the extra $r>ooo, holding
"Swiftwater's" one-eighth interest in No.
13, El Dorado, as security. On the
strength of having $9000 in cash the fam
ous "Swlftwater" came out and cut a
flve-hundred-foot swath across the
United States. He did not own a con
trolling interest in any rich mine on the
Klondike, and, as stated, only had one
eighth or No. 13, El Dorado, which he
was popularly supposed to own in en
tirety.
The San Francisco company which was
organized by securing "Swlftwater" as
a figurehead, did not know thpso things
at the time and some of the statements
may be news to the stockholders even
now.
"Swlftwater" was so nicknamed by the
miners on the Yukon on account of his
extreme prudence when boating. When
ever he would come to a bit of swift
water, it was his habit to get out of his
boat and walk around the place. His
aversion to rapids was so marked, al
though he was by no means a cowardly
man, that the sobriquet "Swlftwater"
finally became his accepted title.
A Slave to Liquor.
George A. Root, druggist at Sixth and
Howard streets, was yesterday arrested
on the complaint of his wife, Irene, on
the charge of being a common drunKard.
He has become a slave to drink, and as
a result has been neglecting his business.
had saved about $700 and about two
years ago she mot and married
Esqueda. Her husband she soon
found was a worthless fellow. He
refused to work and demanded that
she support him. Several months
a*o he beat her because she re
fused to give him any more money,
but the case was dismissed in the
Police Court because of her ignor
ance of the English language and a
consequent inability to understand
the testimony that was being given
In the behalf of the accused man.
She left her worthless husband then
and secured employment at 732 Eddy
street. On Friday last she met her
indolent husband and h.s asked her
to go to the room he was occupying
at 1317 Powell street, saving that
he was sorry for his conduct and
asked hor to forgive him and live
with him again. She had no sooner
entered the room when he demanded
more money. She refused to give it
to him and he knocked her down.
She struggled to her foet. but he
struck her again. Several times he
struck her to the floor, smashing
her nose, blacking hor eyes and
loosening her teeth. The rage of
the fiendish brute Increased as he
Continued his torture, and when she
lay on the floor almost Insensible
he jumped on her prostrate body.
The house at the time was deserted
except for them and her cries and
shrieks failed to attract attention.
The brute did not cease at beating
his wife but he attempted to dis
embowel her, but that crime he did
not carry to a finish. When he
had tired of his torture he locked
her in a room and stood guard over
her until Tuesday'nieht. when he
went away on a short errand. Mrs.
Esqueda took advantage of his
absence, and breaking open the
door made' her escape and sought
refuge with a friend, Mrs. Larious,
at 1011 Pacific street.
All the time the woman had been
locked up her husband had denied
her food and drink. Her moans and
appeals for pity only incensed him
to further deeds of cruelty and al
most hourly he entered the room
where she was confined and beat her
again and again.
The unfortunate woman fell across
the threshold of the door
of the house where she sought
safety. She was tenderly lifted up
and Dr. Martinez summoned. The
physician is apprehensive of the wo
man's condition and says that mur
der might be added to the charges
already against the man.
As soon as the charges were made
several policemen were detailed to
search for the accused man. but
Ksqueda anticipating the charges af
ter his wife's escape from him
went Into hiding. Judge Conlan,
who issued the warrants for the
brute's arrest, considered the
charges most acreravated ones and
he placed the bail on the combined
charges at $6500.
MAY EXTEND
THE PARK TO
THE PRESIDIO
Splendid Project of the
Commissioners.
SEVEN BLOCKS NECESSARY
A PLAN TO CONNECT THE TWO
BEAUTIFUL RESORTS.
Other Improvements Contemplated
. During the Coming Year â A
New Use for the City
Street Sweeping?
If Superintendent McLaren and the
Commissioners succeed in carrying out
contemplated improvements, within a
very few years Golden Gate Park and the
Presidio will be connected by a broad,
almost level driveway, bicycle, bridle and
foot paths, bordered with trees, lawns
and flowers. In fact, the plan is to ac
quire land and extend the parkâ or an
arm of itâ to the Government reservation.
Seven blocks of land between Thir
teenth and Fourteenth avenues are neces
sary to the consummation of the scheme,
title to part of which is already vested In
the city and is under the control of the
Commissioners. These seven blocks, if
deeded to the city for park purposes,
would form an ideal connecting link be
tween these two beauty spots, extending
from the main drive to McDowell avenue,
near Mountain Lake, making one of the
most magnificent drives and bicycle rides
in the country. At that point the land is
nearly level, while at First avenue, the
only roadway between the two places
now, there is an exceedingly steep grade
near the Presidio entrance. This stripâ a
full block in widthâ woul.d give ample
space for a driveway and the various
paths and leave ample space for land
scape effects.
With the allowance of a quarter of a
million dollars allotted the park for the
coming year it will be impossible to pur
chase this land, but the Commissioners
are in hopes that public-spirited citizens
will come to their aid and donate the
land or purchase it and present it to me
park.
Many other improvements are contem
plated, including the completion of the
bicycle path and bridle road to the ocean,
the cutting of a roadway at First avenue
and Fulton street; erection of an electric
light plant to light the eighty lamps al
ready in place along the main and south
driveways from the entrance to the
beach and the building of a new band
stand, seats, etc. This band stand will be
situated in the grand court of the lair
grounds, one of the most beautiful spots
in the park, and it is the intention to pro
vide accommodations for at least 25,000
people at the concerts. This last work
will probably be commenced during the
coming winter and completed by the time
the rains are over in the spring The
electric plant will be put in immediately,
as it is the intention to have the lights
turned on some time during next month.
This will illuminate the drives for the
whole distance, and is calculated to make
the park as much an evening resort as it
is in the dav timfL All the wires are laid
underground, while the poles are of iron
and quite artistic.
The appropriation for the park seems
at first thought to be quite liberal, but
when it is taken into consideration that
it requires $150,000 to keep up the pres
ent improvements it does not leave much
for now features. Moreover, of the re
maining $100,000 from $15,000 to $25,000 will
have to go for loam alone. During
the past three months $15,000 has been
spent for that purpose. This is neces
sary to keep alive the trees and shrubs
in the western part, where the soil is thin
and requires frequent replenisning.
For years the Commissioners have
vainly tried to have the street sweepings
given to the park for fertilizing pur
poses. Every yard of soil costs 75 cent3,
but with these sweepings it would not
be necessary to purchase any to cover
the same amount of ground that is now
covered ep-^h year. Indeed, i: is esH
maved thac the sweepings would be suf
ficient for that purpose, and to reclaim
a portion of the barren sand dunes ns
well. But though the Park Commission
ers have vainly sought for years to se
cure this refuse the city has refused to
haul it out there, preferring rather, to
pay the garbage crematory to burn it,
entailing a double and entirely useless
tax upon the people. The Commission
ers will make another effort to have the
city send its street sweepings out for use
In beautifying the park, and if they are
successful a handsome sum will be avail
able for other purposes. It is absolutely
necessary that fertilization be kept up all
\he time" in order to keep alive the trees,
shrubs and flowers already flourishing
where a short time ago there was naught
but drifting sand piles.
EVADING THE WAR TAX.
Express Companies Still Refuse to
Pay for Revenue Stamps.
Everything indicates that the express
companies will in the long run shirk the
payment of the war tax imposed by the
Government. Several times recently de
cisions have been rendered by the courts
of the East and the general public sup
posed that these were test cases and that
the express companies would yield grace
fully and not exact the tariff from their
patrons, but the companies have gone
along at the same old rate, charging all
for their services that the traffic would
bear and then adding to their charges the
amount of the war tax. In order to
learn of the exact situation a number of
local merchants asked the secretary of
the Merchants' Association to mako in
quiry of those interested in the East.
Yesterday J. R. Freud sent to the Mer
chants' Association of New York this in
quiry: "Do Eastern express companies
now furnish revenue stamps. Wire an
swer."
A little later this reply was received:
"Eastern express companies do not pay 4
for revenue stamps. Suits to determine
this question now pending." This really
means that all of the cases that have
been decided by the Eastern courts have
not touched the main question but only
some of the side issues Involved. The
local association decided not to begin any
action in this city involving the matter
under consideration, the Intention being
to hold off until the question was settled
by the courts of the East. The only per
son who had the pluck to attack the ex
press company is a member of the So
cialist Labor party, and his case is now
pending in the Justices' Court.
Reinhold Sues for Damages.
Edgar Retnhold. who on July 8,
while skylarking with a number of boys,
was shot and almost fatally Injured by
Mrs. Emma O'Connor, filed suit yesterday
(by his guardian) to recover $10,000 dam
ages from the woman responsible, for his
injury and subsequent suffering. The bul
let fired by Mrs. O'Connor struckr young
Reinhold in the face and lodged in his
neck. An attempt was made to remove
the leaden missile, but it was unsurcess
ful and a second operation will have to
be performed. In all probability the de
fendant will plead justification for her
act as she claims that her victim. In com
pany with a crowd of youngsters, was
tormenting her when the shot was fired.
Well-Known Doctor Dead.
Dr. Myron E. Kohn, aged 28, died un
expectedly Wednesday evening of pneu
monia, at his residence, 1730 Larkin street.
The funeral will take place to-day, con
ducted bv Dr. Voorsanger and the inter
mont will be in Home of Peace Cemetery.
The doctor had resided in San Francis
co for ten years and was well known, es
pecially In the Chinese district, where he
had a large practice.
Two days before his death he was in
excellent health.
