National Guard Officers Give Assurance That All

Their Country in Cuba.
NEW YORK. April 16.â The Wash
ington special of the Herald says: Fitz
hugh Lee will command a division of
the army of occupation in Cuba with
the commission of a major general. This
is the understanding at the War Depart
ment to-day.
Congress will empower the Presi
dent early next week to enlist all the
National Guards in the United States
for Bervice in Cuba,
All opposition to the amended army
reorganization bill on the part of the
National Guards has been formally
withdrawn, and the unqualified support
of all militia organizations has been en
listed in favor of its immediate passage.
Pledges that the entire militia
strength of the country will volun
teer for foreign service in support of
any plan embodying the wishes of
Congress and the President were
given by representatives of the Na
tional Guards* Association at an im
portant conference with Secretary
Alger to-day.
At this conference, which lasted sev
eral hours, the status of the militia of the
States, and the means by which the
President may be empowered to call for
volunteers for service outside the United
State- were discussed exhaustively. Ma
jor General Miles, commanding the
army: Adjutant General Corbin, Lieu
tenant Colonel A. L. Wagner, chief of
the Military Information Division of
the War Department, and other officers
of the regular army took part in the
discussion. The House Committee on
Military Affairs was represented by its
chairman. Representative Hull, Repre
sentative Marsh, who is also chairman
of the House Committee on Militia, and
Representatives Griffin and McDonald.
There were present at conference rep
resentatives from the National Guard of
New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut,

ONLY THE CALL PRINTS
THE FULL WAR NEWS OF
THE NEW YORK HERALD
NEW YORK, April 16.â As soon as the Herald heard that the
Bulletin, an evening paper of San Francisco, had announced that it
was to have access to all Herald war news, it peremptorily knocked
out the arrangement. The Bulletin was notified by wire that any
such plan would be in direct violation of an agreement already per
fected with The Call whereby all Herald news goes directly to the
morning paper.
The Herald news service covering the war is the most complete
ever organized, and it was a matter of surprise here when i.-*e Bul
letin was said to have announced itself as party to the scheme. The
existence of a colored gentleman in the woodpile was sus
pected, and inquiry disclosed that the Bulletin had been advertising
goods it could not possibly deliver. It remains for that paper now
to back down as gracefully as possible.
It is not regarded as strange that the Bulletin should have
sought to create the impression that it was to print Herald war news,
but there is some wonder in journalistic circles at its assurance in
advertising to do that which there was no chance of its doing. The
Bulletin will be obliged to take such Herald news as it may print
from the columns of The Call, and it will thus be enabled to set forth
in the afternoon that which has appeared in The Call in the morn
ing of the same day.
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Maryland.
The early part of the conference was
taken up with a general discussion of
the constitutional provisions for the
maintenance of militia and the rights of
States to control their organizations and
services. Major General George R.
Snowden, commanding the National
Guard of Pennsylvania, stated on behalf
of the National Guard Association that

sations and correspondence with Na

He had doubt of the power of Con

THE SENATE RESOLUTIONS
MEAN WAR WITH SPAIN
WASHINGTON, April 16.â Joint resolution for the independ
ence of the people and the republic of Cuba, demanding the
Government of Spain to relinquish its authority and government
in the island of Cuba and to withdraw its land and naval forces
from Cuba and Cuban waters, and directing the President of
the United States to use the land and naval forces of the United
States to carry these resolutions into effect :
WHEREAS, The abhorrent conditions which have existed for more
than three years in the island of Cuba, so near our own borders, have
shocked the moral sense in the people of the United States, have been a
disgrace to Christian civilization, culminating as they have in the destruction
of a United States battle-ship, with 266 of its officers and crew, while on
a friendly visit in the harbor of Havana, and cannot longer be endured, as
has been set forth by the President of the United States in his message to
Congress of April n, 1898, upon which the action of Congress was in
vited. Therefore,
Resolved, By the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America, in Congress assembled â
First â That the people of the island of Cuba are and of right ought
to be free and independent, and that the Government of the United States
hereby recognizes the republic of Cuba as the true and lawful Government
of that island.
Second â That it is the duty of the United States to demand, and the
Government of the United S:ates does hereby demand, that the Government
of Spain at once relinquish its authority and government in the island of
Cuba and withdraw its land and naval forces from Cuba and Cuban waters.
Third â That the President of the United States be and he hereby is
directed and empowered to use the entire land and naval forces of the
United States, and to call into the actual service of the United States the
militia of the several States to such extent as may be necessary to carry
these resolutions into effect.
FOURTH â That the United States hereby disclaims any disposition or
intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or control over said island,
except for the pacification thereof, and asserts its determination, when that
is accomplished, to leave the government and control of the island to
its people.
MALAGA, Spain, April 16.
There was a serious dis
turbance here to-day, re
sulting in an attack upon
the United States Consul-
ate.
The demonstration be
gan with the parade of
small crowds through the
streets shouting patriotic
cries, but a mob eventually
gathered and attacked the
United States Consulate.
Stones were thrown and
the leaders procured a lad
der, tore down the shield
having upon it the arms of
the United States and
dragged it along the
streets.
The Prefect was sum
moned and he addressed
the people, beÂ£Â£inÂ£ them
to disperse, which in some
degree restored order.
Afterward the streets
were patrolled by gend
armes, but the excitement
continued.

CADIZ, Spain, April 16. â The

but the police interfered and ar

been placed under guard.

LEE SAYS WAR.
RICHMOND. Va.. April 16.â
General Fitzhugh Lee returned
to Richmond to-night and said
there was no means by which
war could be averted unless
Spain backed down completely
and evacuated Cuba.
"I have been in consultation
with the War Department," he
said, "and you can state that the
militia of the country will be or
dered out not later than Tues
day. The order may come on
Monday, if not, certainly by
Tuesday."
General Lee was asked whether
he would be made major-general
in event of hostilities.
"I have not yet been officially
notified of my appointment," he
answered, "so cannot say any
thing on that point."
General Lee said that he ex
pected to stay until Monday, but
in the event that the militia was
ordered out would probably bo
recalled to-morrow.

PARIS BOURSE
BADLY SHAKEN
BY COMING WAR
French Trade Is Now Menaced
by the Suppression of
American Imports.
Copyrighted, ISOB, by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, April 16.â The news from abroad has this week cast Into
the shade evefy other subject, and in every class of society, political,
business or pleasure, all eyes are fixed, not without anxiety, on the va
rious phases traversed by the differences between the United States
and Spain. It is on the business community especially that the un
certainty of the hour weighs heaviest. The Bourse, already severely
tried by the political events of the past few months, by the approach
ing elections, and above all by the schemes of general reorganization
left as legacy by the last Parliament, is at the present hour almost
-lead by the depreciation of certain stocks, and particularly affected
by the prospects of war, which adversely influence the entire list.
French trade is menaced by the suppression of American Imports,
such as petroleum oil, malt, provisions, wheat, etc., and is forced to
seek other sources of supply in order not to be taken unawares.
The principal Marseilles houses are already making large purchases
in Algiers and Tunis, where it causes an important and sudden rise in
produce of all kinds. !?ven in political circles, where hitherto an op
timistic feeling hns prevailed, there is scarcely a feeble hope that the
pending questions will be settled without bloodshed.
for peace, and is still hopeful of
securing it. Important negotia
tions were held to-day.
It is learned that if the United
States Congress finally agrees on
a resolution similar to that passed
by the House of Representatives,
Senor Polo de Bernabe, the Span
ish Minister at Washington, will
not be recalled, and General Wood
ford, consequently, will remain in
Madrid. Furthermore, it is not
unlikely, in the event of a resolu
tion on these lines passing, that
the friendly offices of the United
States would be invoked to assist
in the restoration of permanent
peace in Cuba. Another important
factor in the situation which also
tends toward peace is the official
news that a conference has been
arranged for to-morrow between
Gentr.il Maximo Gomez and two
Spanish generals in Cuba.
The Bourse to-night is decidedly
lower and exchange has again
risen.
The general opinion of the even
ing papers is that the decision of
the United States will be hostile to
Spain.
El Correo, the Government or
gan, demonstrates by long ex
tracts from the London Times
President M^Kinley's illogical at
titude in posing as a humanitarian.
The Epoca (Conservative) fol
lows we same line, saying that
President M^Kinley cannot possi
bly interfere with the sole object
of increasing the existing miseries.
Should lie really desire war the
Epoca hopes that Spain will let
him fire the first shot.
This evening demonstrations
were made in several of the pro
vincial capitals. The American
shield has been replaced at the
American Consulate at Malaga
amid the tumultuous protests of
the crowd. A force of gendarmes
continues to patrol the streets.
A Cabinet council, lasting three
hours, approved the conversion in
to warships of the steamers of the
Compania Transatlantica, and then
discussed the state of Spain's for
eign relations, finally deciding that
the questions be submitted to the
Cortes.
El Liberal Insists that the time has
come for the settlement of the quarrel
between the United States and Spain,
declaring that Spain is bleeding to
d<-ath, while the United States gains
Strength by rir'lay. The theory of in
ternational right being under the safe
guard of the powers is very fine in
principle, El Liberal s;iys, and that the
powers protect the weaker nation
against the stronger Â«s very humani
tarian but does not work in practice.
El Liberal says that Spain must bring
matters to an issue herselr. and should
the fortune of war be against her,
though defeated, she need not blush.
EI Liberal lays stress upon the fears
of the United Status of action in Mex
ico, should war occur, lest the Latin
races In America make a united stand
against Anglo-Saxon domination.
The Imparcial says: Never did a
nation pursue a policy more contempti
ble than that of America td-day. So
false and low are the pretexts for war
that the stomach as well as the heart
of Europe is moved. Three parts of the
original scheme are now blended in one.
The Cubans, unless they are blind,
must see the fate that the liberators
reserve for them. Hence the rumors
of Maximo Gomez' willingness to ac
cept the existing legality. The rumors
are unconfirmed, but Senors Glberga,
Dolz and Vion are about to start for
the rebel quarters. General Calixto
Qarcia'B attitude, the New York Junta's
disgust and the foreign bourses rise,
all give hope that the rebels will resist
annexation and we will shortly see
whether American greed dare face the
opposition of the whole of Cuba and
Europe, unless Cuba has lost her com
mon sense, Spain her courage and the
old world its self-interest.
ROOSRVELT WANTS
SERVICE IN CUBA.
NEW YORK, April 16.â A special
Washington dispatch to the Press says
that. Assistant Secretary of the Navy
Roosevelt is anxious to take part In
active service against Spaniards in
Cuba, and has submitted his resignation
to the President. He has been urged by
the I 'resident and Secretary Long to
withdraw his resignation, but has de
clined. He will ask for appointment

WILL CALL OUT
STATE TROOPS
Continued from First Page.
of the President. He said that the war
which was to be fought was a war in
which every section of the country must
bear its part of the burden. He accord
ingly advised that when the call for
troops should be made the President
should call upon every National Guard
in the United States.
The present organized strength of the
National Guard, he said, was consider
ably more than ioo.ooo men. and he be
lieved about 75 per cent of these were
ready to volunteer. In any event he
advocated that Congress should em
power the President to call for at least
ioo.ooo volunteers and if in the judgment
of the administration a smaller number
than these seemed to be sufficient, the
Governor of each State should be called
upon to furnish a quota in proportion to
the State's population. A few of the
States have no National Guard, but he
believed they should not be omitted
from the call.
Brigadier General Hollard Carroll,
chief of artillery of the New York N.
G. ; Colonel F. V. Green, of the Seventy
first Regiment, N. Y. N. G. ; Brigadier
General J. H. Harries, of the District of
Columbia N. G.; Brigadier General W.
J. McKee, of the Indiana N. G.; Colonel
H. L. Turner, of the Illinois N. G., and
Adjutant General A. L. Wilmer. of the
Maryland N. G., took part in the dis
cussion on the lines advocated by Gen
erals Stewart and Snowden. The con
ference was unable to settle the debated
question of the commissioning by the
United States of the general officers of
the National Guards at their present
rank.
Representatives Hull and Marsh con
ferred with the representatives of the
National Guard and it was unanimously
agreed that a comprehensive bill should
be introduced in the House on Monday
by Representative Marsh, which will
empower the President in effect to call
out the entire National Guard strength
of the country. How many men the
President will be authorized to call out
was left to be settled later.
The National Guard officers, in be
half of the organizations which they
represent, pledged the united support
of the militia to any plan which the
administration should decide to pur-
With their pledge they coupled a re
quest that inasmuch as legislation which
would be enacted would not specially
mention National Guard organizations,
the President should make his call on
the Governors of States with the un
derstanding that the Governors would
request State organizations to volunteer
in advance of the acceptance of un
organized volunteers.
The members of the conference to
night considered the suggestion of com
missioning Consul General Lee with
the rank of major general of volunteers.
The mention of his name brought forth
a .round of hearty applause, and the
regular army officers and National
Guardsmen alike paid many compli
ments to his heroism and ability. Every
one heartily favored honoring General
Lee with the command which he himself
had expressed a desire to be intrusted
with.
As a result, it is stated that the
President will select General Lee as
the first general officer of volunteers
whom he will appoint under the au
thority which Congress will give him
in the organization of a volunteer
army and that he will command the
first volunteers sent to Cuba.
Representative Hall then brought up
for consideration his amended bill for
the reorganization of the army on the
three battalion basis. He called to the
attention of the National Guardsmen
the fact that the enlisted strength of the
army in time of peace would not be in
creased by a single man, and the 125
additional officers would probably be
detailed on detached service as military
attaches, at the military institutions and
on similar services. He added that the
war strength of the regular army would
not exceed 65.000 men. Major General
Miles and Lieutenant Colonel Wagner
made a strong plea for the three battal
ion system, founded upon the experience
of modern armies.
After an animated discussion the Na
tional Guardsmen unanimously agreed
to withhold all further opposition to
the reorganization bill and promised to
lend their support to its passage in
Congress. Chairman Hull said to-day
that , he expected to get the amended
bill through the House of Representa
tives on Monday.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 17, 1898.
GERMANY TO
BE NEUTRAL
Baron yon Bulow So Says
to Embassador
White).
But the Press of the Fatherland
Does Considerable Carping
on the Subject.
It Is Believed That the Commerce of
the Country Will Suffer Dur
ing Ho&tilitles.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN, April 16.â 1n German offi
cial and political circles it is held that
an outbreak of actual hostilities be
tween the United States and Spain is
merely a question of a brief time, as
both countries have gone too far to re
cede.
There has been a strong revulsion of j
popular sentiment here. Last -week ,
the preponderance was in favor of the
United States. To-day the reverse is j
true. President McKinley's message is j
considered disappointing and its im- j
port is regarded as anti-peace. Even ;
the Liberal press strongly disapproves
of it. A carping spirit is shown
throughout the press.
The attitude of the Government,
I however, differs widely from it. Baron
yon Bulow, the Minister for Foreign !
Affairs, had a long conversation this j
week with United States Embassador j
White on the situation, and White em- !
powers the press of the United States
to say that the Minister gave him the
strongest assurances that Germany "in
the event of war will maintain th-3
most strict and loyal neutrality, with
out any arriere pensee," and that it
was "due to Baron yon Bulow's per
sonal inspiration that the semi-official
North German Gazette printed the dcc
i laration to this effect."
Germany's care to avoid a possible
| misinterpretatioin of her designs is
| shown in the fact that orders given
I some time ago to the home fleet to pro
| ceed, early in May, to Spain, for
j maneuvers have been countermanded,
jso as not to excite false hopes upon
Spain's part.
The German Government and a por
tion of the press are discussing the
j probable extent to which German in
, terests will be affected by the war. A
; high official of the navy in an inter
view said to a correspondent, "There
jis a possibilityâ nay, a probability â
lof the arrival of the Spanish I
fleet off New York or some ;
northern harbor or harbors, and thus a |
bombardment must be considered. The j
bombardment of N*-w York would j
create a financial panic which would re
act especially strongly on Hamburg and
Bremen. Hence we are vitally interest
ed."
The authorities here and the public
also are greatly concerned about pri
vateering, although it is not believed
that tiff United States -will sanction it.
The Cologne Gazette in an article,
which was directly inspired by the
Government and mainly addressed to
Spain, has strongly denounced priva
teering as- being piracy, adding that
Germany under no circumstances will
submit to have vessels under her flag
searched for contraband of war or
otherwise molested by privateers.
On the other hand, the officials of the
Spanish Embassy admit that Spain in
tends to do as much damage as possible
to the United States by privateering.
One of the officials said: "War is war,
and every means allowed by usage
will be employed by the Spanish if this
unjust war is forced upon us."
PROBABLE DISPOSITION
OF CALIFORNIA GUARDS.
Will Be Stationed at the Presidio and
Exposed Points Along the
Coast.
SACRAMENTO, April 16.â Colonel
Peeler, assistant adjutant-general, in
speaking of the war situation this
afternoon said:
"In all probability the State troops
will be called upon to take the place of
the regulars at the Presidio. This was
the course followed during the war of
the rebellion and I presume it will be
done just as soon as war is declared.
It will certainly be necessary for the
State troops to take an active part,
when the time comes, and while the
War Department will no doubt leave a
sufficient number of regulars at the
various barracks along the Pacific
Coast to man the heavy artillery our
National Guard will be placed at vari
ous points to resist any attack that
may be made tJong the coast."
In speaking of the order of General
Shafter, directing the location of a
heavy battery at Santa Cruz, the
colonel said:
"It seems to me that such an order
was a most Important and essential
one, for the reason that at the present
there is no defens of any kfrid at Santa
Cruz and in case of an invasion our
vast powder supplies at that point
would fall into the hands of the
enemy. Eureka and Santa Barbara are
also exposed, and I have no doubt that
a portion of our State troops will be
stationed at these points. No business
of an extraordinary nature is pending
in the office of 'he adjutant general, but
as soon as the order comes from Wash
ington to remove State troops a speedy
and active response will be made."
FALSE NOTIONS AS
TO SOUTHERN PATRIOTISM.
Dreamy Dons Yet Think of Invad
ing the United States From
Mexico.
CITY OF MEXICO, April 16.â A cor
respondent called on the Minister of
War, General Berriozabel, to-night,
who says that so far from increasing
the troops on the border, there are
fewer soldiers on the Rio Grande than
for some months. Troops have been
moved about lately, and that probably
g-ave rise to rumors of increased mili
tary operations.
Many hot-headed and impetuous res
ident Spaniards fully believe that if
they were allowed to enlist a few regi
ments among their own countrymen
and invade Texas, the Southern States
would welcome them and begin a re
bellion against the Federal Govern
ment, and that the Southern leaders
would agree to give Mexico back her
territory lost in the war of the Ameri
can invasion.
Some time ago at a dinner at a Span
ish club in this city it is reported that
this Quixotic plan was broached to a
general in the Mexican army, a veteran
of several wars, who tried to reason
his Spanish hosts out of their absurd
notion, while they tried to persuade
him to head a little army of invasion,
which they would form. He flatly re
fused, but it was boasted that the
Spanish colony would make a rear at
tack on the United States while war
was in progress.

Recently Formed Battal-

Not a Part of the National

Citizens Giving Substantial Aid In
Enlarging and Fitting an
Armory,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MONTEREY, April 16.â The first reg
ular meeting and drill of the Monterey
naval reserve since its formal organi
zation last Friday night were held last
night at Mariposa Hall, the battalion's
new armory. The enthusiasm of the
members of the battalion was evi
denced by the large number present at
the first drill and the energy with
which they went about their duties.
The officers chosen by the battalion
are: For drill, M. P. Seele"-. lieuten
ant-commanding; George D. Kierulff,
lieutenant junior grade, to command
Pacific Grove division; Frank Turton,
first ensign; W. E. Parker, second en
sign. -For business. W. Lawrey Hollen
beck, financial secretary; Fred
Schneider; recording secretary.
The rules of government of the mili
tia were adopted and a committee ap
pointed to confer with the State au
thorities relative to procuring arms
and equipments. The battalion has re
ceived much encouragement from Na
tional Guard headquarters, and, be
sides moral support, the citizens of
Monterey and Pacific Grove are giving
substantial aid in enlarging and fitting
up Mariposa Hall for an armory. As
the Monterey reserve cannot be mus
tered into the National Guard until the
State Legislature meets in January
next, and therefore cannot be called
out with the rest of the militia in case
of war, the battalion has determined to
volunteer its service and will devote
itself energetically to drilling to pre
pare for that emergency.
NAPA, April 16. â A recruiting office
has been opened in Napa by the au
thority of Colonel Fairbanks, com
manding the Fifth Regiment, National
Guard of California. The intention is
to enlist men to the full complement
of Company H and be ready for emer
gencies. The flag is flying. Multi
tudes are crowding about headquar
ters, and a number have enlisted. The
excitement manifested reminds elderly
men of the days of 1861.
SAN RAFAEL, April 16.â The war
spirit has reached this city at last. For
a while roses were the chief topic, but
now that a conflict seems inevitable
Captain Elliott desires to increase the
membership of Company D, Fifth In
fantry, National Guard of California,
to 103 men in anticipation of a call to
service. The present number is about
seventy, six new names being added to
the roll to-day. A call for volunteers
has been made and it is pretty cer

LAKEPORT, April 16.â Lake County
has fallen into line, and is getting a
company of volunteers ready for the
service of Uncle Sam. Captain W. B.
Collier, a graduate of West Point, and
R. S. Rodman are organizing the com
pany. The two newspaper offices here
are the recruiting stations and already
have large lists. It is hoped that it will
be an artillery company. *t is quite
possible Lakeport will supply two com
panies, as there are too many volun
teers for one.
BRITISH STEAMER STOPPED
FROM LOADING COAL
Not Permitted by the Federal Au
thorities to Carry Fuel to Cape
Verde Islands.
NORFOLK, Va., April 16.â The Brit
ish steamship Hampstead, Captain
Bland, was stopped from loading coal
on Friday at Lambert Point, when it
was found that she was loading for
St. Vincent, Cape Verde Islands, at
which port two of Spain's cruisers are
now lying, and that the flying squad
ron, under Captain Schley was being
delayed in its coaling until this cargo
of 3000 tons could be completed.
Evidently hasty wires worked be
tween Norfolk, New York and Wash
ington, and after a short time the load
ing was resumed arid the full carge un
ished. But the steamer did not go. Or
ders for h.r indefinite stay were re
ceived, and to-day Catain Blar.J took
his clearance papers to the customs
house here and delivered them up.
The naval inspection board paid a
visit to the Hampstead and thoroughly
inspected her. and the chief engineer
evidently voiced the satisfaction and
decision of the board when, on leaving
the vessel, he remarked to one of the
officers, "Keep yourselves perfectly
easy. Your ship won't leave Norfolk."
* Captain Bland said to-night, "I con
sider tho vessel as good as accepted by
the United States."

a recess until 8 or 10 o'clock to-night to
await the action of the Senate, but on
Dlngley's statement that the Senate
was not likely to act before midnight
he yielded, but modified his motion to

WILL GO TO SEA
ONLY WHEN WAR
ACTUALLY BEGINS
First TasK of the Flyir>g SquadroQ
Will Be to Assail Fortifica
tions of Porto F^ico.
NEW YORK, April 16.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
It Is not proposed by the department to send the flying squadron
to sea until war has actually been declared, and then it â will be sent to
Porto Rico to destroy Spain's force there.
Just as soon as the New Orleans has received her full comple
ment of men she will proceed to Hampton Roads for duty under
Commodore Schley's command. It is also proposed to recruit the San
Francisco's crew to the maximum limit and to attach that vessel to the
flying squadron.
No action has yet been taken on the proposition of transferring the
New York and Massachusetts in order that Commodore Schley's fleet
may be composed entirely of speedy ships. This transfer, It is be
lieved, will not be ordered until after the flying squadron starts for
Porto Rico.
The four heavy batteries of the Massachusetts will be required for
reducing the fortifications of San Juan. When this work is accom
plished the Hying squadron will be sent to the other side of the Atlan
tic to meet the Spanish vessels, with a view to their destruction.
Besides the vessels mentioned which will be attached to Commo
dore Schley's fleet, it is generally understood that the St. Louis and St.
Paul will be assigned to his squadron as soon as they are . converted
into auxiliary cruisers. From present indications the Paris and New
York will be assigned to the North Atlantic squadron. Preliminary
orders have been given to Captain C. D. Sigsbee, formerly commander
of the Maine, and to Captain C. F. Goodrich, president of the Naval
War College, to assume command of the St. Paul and St. Louis, re
spectively, and Captain Frederick Rogers, president of the Naval Aux
iliary Board, will take command of the New York, while Captain A.
S. Barker will be assigned to the Paris.
Captain Sigsbee will leave to-night to inspect his new command
before her departure to-morrow afternoon from the Cramps'. Chief Na
val Constructor Hichborn haÂ« "â¢â â¢Mied the naval constructor at
Cramps' yard to make preparations for converting the four vessels of
the American line, the work to b .umpleted within thirty days. It is
proposed to equip the liners with formidable batteries.

Mutiny Among Matanzas Grocers
Over the Levying of a Special
Tax.
Copyrighted, ISBB, by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, April 16.â Hostilities being
suspended, news from the interior is
without interest. There are neither
battles nor skirmishes. Spanish troops
â go everywhere and carry food for the
forts without being harassed by any
one; farmers are working on their
farms without hindrance. Groups of
rebels on foot and horseback have been
seen with white flags at Matanzas.
Some merchants have closed their
doors, and there was a little mutiny
among grocery retailers, who pro
tested against the tax fixed by the
Council of the city on articles of food,
drink, and on materials for fire, to
make up the deficit caused by the ex
traordinary war expenses. Crowds
gathered in the streets, but the police
and civilian guard dispersed them.
Some were arrested, then quietness
was re-established. This event was
without importance, being exclusively
a local one.
All supplies stored at Matanzas *o
feed the reconcentrados were aban
doned by Consul Brice. The British
Vice-Consul, Mr. Dacosta, is attending
to the distribution day and night, al
though he has been left without clerks
and instructions.
The Spanish mail steamship Monte
video arrived this morning. On board
was second in command at this port,
Don Luis Paster de Landero, who went
as far as Porto Rico on the Vizcaya.
There he went on board the Montr
video. Among many other passengers
were Captain Don Ricardo Bruone, col
onel of marines; two lieutenants be
longing to the military corps, two sol
diers and thirty-four sailors belonging
to the navy.
An editorial in La Diario de la Ma
rina says that telegrams received yes
terday make it appear that the end of
friendly relations between Spain and
the United States has been reached.
It declares that Spain has an advan
tage over the United States, because
her diplomacy has bereft that country
of every pretext to meddle with the af
fairs of Cuba. The editorial praises
the policy of Sagasta, which it says
has been applauded by other nations.
Two hundred rebels under Colonel
Hernandez approached San Jose de las
Lajas to-day, and, hoisting a white
flag, asked the military commander for
a conference. According to the last
news received at the Staff Office, the
insurgent chief and the Spanish com
mander are holding conferences about
the basis of an armistice. It is almost
sure that the capitulation of the rebels
will take place to-morrow.
Members of the Committee of Radi
cal Autonomists will leave for Santa
Cruz del Sur to-morrow to tender an
armistice to the rebels. Senor Viondi
has been excused, not being able to go.
Marquis Real will go in his place. He
offered to do so, believing he will have
influence with the rebels, as his son,
Manuel Antone Morales, is a member
of the rebel delegation in New York.
NEW YORK, April 16.â The Her
ald desires to state that its news
published under Havana date is
from Spanish sources, owing to the
fact that all American correspond
ents were obliged to leave Havana
with Consul-General Lee. Such
news must be taken with the reser
vation that this explanation sug
gests.
COUNTING THE COST.
It is announced that In the event of war
with Spain the internal revenue tax acts
of 1862 and 1863 will be re-enacted. They
amounted to $700,000,000 a year. These acts
put a tax of $1 a barrel on beer, but the
bulk of the revenue was derived from tea
and coffee, all proprietary articles and th<*
stamp tax on checks, deeds, receipts,
leases, mortgages and commercial paper.
A 1100.000.000 popular loan is talked of, and
the President is said to have instructed
Chairman Dingley to prepare a bill which
will increase the revenue by the same
amount. War comes high.â Buffalo Ex

General Shafter Says That
Is What Massing of
Troops Means.
Regulars Will Soon Be on the
Way to the Atlantic
Seaboard.
Expects the California Militia to Be
Called Out Not Later Than
Monday.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKERSFIELD, April 16.â Cenera! |
Shafter arrived this evening from Me- |
Kittrick ranch, seated behind two spick i
and span light bays, and handling th-e
ribbons himself. He was accompanied
by his son-in-law and daughter, Mr.
and Mrs. W. H. McKittrick. The gen
eral came in to take the early train
for San Francisco to make ready to
remove all infantry and light artillery
troops at the Presidio and Benlcia to
New Orleans. Just before leaving for
the north General Shafter was seen by
The Call correspondent, and was asked
about the war situation and the re
moval of the troops to New Orleans.
"When will the removal begin?" he
was asked.
"Just as soon as everything can be
made ready. That is my object in go
ing to headquarters to-night. I can
not just now name the time, but it will
be soon."
"What is the object in massing
troops at New Orleans?"
"Getting ready to go to Cuba."
"Do you think they will go to Cuba
soon?"
"I can't tell."
"Will you be in command at New Or
leans?"
"Yes, sir; and General Graham will
be commander of the department. I
am his senior yet; he will be com
mander."
"Do you think the National Guard of
California will be called?"
"I have been expecting a call before
this. I will be very much disappointed
if they are not called out Monday "
"What disposition will be made of
the Guards?"
"I am not prepared to say."
"It is rumored that some of them
will be sent to do post duty in Arizona
in place of the regulars?"
'"here are soldiers at the Arizona
posts. There has been only one com
pany sent from those posts and it was
sent last week."
General Shafter then talked of the
passage of the Senate resolution. When
questioned as to the possibility of a
fight he evaded an answer, but all of
his actions and diplomacy of speech
disclosed that there is fight in the air
and that he was eager to get into the
midst of it. It is said that the general
remarked to a friend here that he ex
pected there would be fighting within
two weeks.
"How are you in the saddle Gen
eral?" was asked.
At this question the hearty old war
rior involuntarily dropped his eyes on
his heavy "frontispiece" and replied:
"I am a pretty good rider. I chased
buffaloes over the plains of Texas too
long not to be a good horseman."
TORPEDO-BOAT SOMERS
NOT A DEEP-SEA CRAFT.
Naval Men Regard as Rashness the
Attempt to Sail It Across the
Ocean.
FALMOUTH, Eng., April IS.â Naval
men here doubt that the United States
torpedo boat Somers, the small craft
purchased in Germany, will ever reach
America, They think it a rash ex
periment to attempt to sail her across
the Atlantic, and believe Commander
Hazelton will come to that opinion,
even if he is able to obtain a crew will
ing to risk the voyage, which he has
not yet secured.
The Topeka, formerly the Diogenes,
and the Somers put in here yesterday,
the latter having encountered severe
weather. The Somers was leaking,
owing, it is said, to defects in her ma
chinery. A large number of workmen
are engaged in repairing the boat,
working night and day.
To encourage the removal of old
buildings, the authorities of Vienna
have decreed that if the owners of 1263
specified houses will replace them with
new structures, they will be guar

SERVED FIRST
Coal Contractor at Fort
Monroe Angers Naval
Officers.
Flying Squadron Compelled to
Wait for Hours for Its
Supplies.
In the Meantime a British Tramp
Collier Takes on a Full
Cargo.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FORT MONROE, Va., April 16.â
Much indignation was expressed among
the officers of the flying squadron to
day at the action of the Norfolk con
tractors who furnish coal to the Gov
ernment vessels. All morning and un
til 2 o'clock this afternoon, the Brook
lyn, Texas and Massachusetts waited
for coal to be served them. This coal
had been ordered at 4 o'clock yester
day afternoon when the squadron arÂ«
rived here, and should have been de
livered by 8 o'clock. Telephone mes
sages seemed to have no effect, and if
sudden orders had come the fleet would
have had to put to sea without a suffi
cient complement of fuel.
When it was announced that the con
tractors had been busily engaged load
ing 3000 tons of coal on the English
tramp steamer Hampstead, destined for
St. Vincent, Cape Verde Islands, where
the Spanish torpedo flotilla is as
sembled, officers expressed their opin
ion freely. When the coal lighter ar
rived off the Brooklyn, Commodore
Schley asked if it was true that the
English vessels had sailed with coal,
and was informed that it had not, but
was loading.
A half hour after Commodore
Schley had received his report, an Eng
lish tramp steamer, supposed to be the
Hampstead, and heavily laden, wem.
to sea, dipping its colors to each ves
sel of the fleet as she passed. A ru
mor that the Government has issued an
order for stopping the transport of coal
was prevalent, but naval afficers agreed
that the sale of the coal to any vessel
flying a foreign flag could not be de
nied or restricted until a state of war
was declared and coal made a contra
band article.
The Sioux, one of the tugboats of the
mosquito flotilla, newly converted,
reached here last night and anchored
near the squadron. Its commander, a
naval cadet, reported to Commodore
Schley that the boat was not in sea
worthy condition, its boiler not being
set to stand the heavy seas. The ves
sel was caught in a very heavy gale,
and came near being wrecked. The
engineer of the Brooklyn ordered some
improvements made and Commodore
Schley said to the young commander:
"Never mind, my boy: when you get
to fighting, you'll look over these trou
bles as mere nothings."
All the vessels of the squadron will
be coaled by noon to-morrow.
FLAG OF FREE CUBA
CHEEKED BY THOUSANDS.

BOSTON, April 16.â Hon. W. J. Bryan
was the guest of Boston to-day. Aft*
breakfast, as the guest of the Bimetal
lic League, a reception was held at the
American House and at 2 o'clock this
afternoon a banquet was served. Mr.
Bryan and Hon. Arthur Sewall <>f
Maine were the guests of honor. Both
made speeches. To-night Mr. Bryan
and Mr. Sewall addressed 15,000 persons
in Mechanics' Hall. Mr. Bryan making
the principal speech and discussing bi
metallism. Both were cheered to the
echo when they entered the hall, ac
companied by George Fred Williams.
Mr. Bryan, referring to the Cuban
question, said he realized that in a
time of international complications we
should forget for a time party ques
tions and rally to the support of na
tional honor. ('Great applause). He
then read a bulletin which had just
been handed him, announcing the pas
sage of the Turpie Cuban recognition
resolution by the Senate. This an
nouncement caused the wildest en
thusiasm, and as Mr. Bryan waved a
silken Cuban flag which had been
thrown to him men and women all over
the hall cheered and yelled their in
dorsement of the Senate's action.

peace and the end in Cuba of Spanish
rule to see American passion throwing
away what American statesmanship
has won. There is, therefore, obviously
an opportunity for the forcible inter
vention of the powers, or some of
them.
"The position of Great Britain, in
such an eventuality, is a delicate one,
but from the point of view of France,
Italy, Austria and Germany, it must
be allowed that the plea made by Spain
could hardly fall on deaf ears. Senor
Sagasta's indignation in regard to the
accusation now bluntly brought in con
nection with the Maine is perfectly jus
tified, after the reticence observed by
the responsible American Government.
Spain virtually throws up the sponge
in ordering an armistice. If American
interference goes further in its insult
ing attack upon the mere existence of
European sovereignty over the island,
a strait waistcoat would seem to .be
a very useful article of attire for the
outside powers to provide for the coun
try which wants to bite off more than
it can chew without any consideration
for other people's interest.
"The notion that England must sup
port America against Europe, whether
America is right or wrong, is ludicrous.
But if a new Holy Alliance attempted
to coerce America In respect to a mat
ter in which our sympathies are with
America, it would no doubt find Great
Britain a strong ally of the United
States. No such case seems likely to
arise yet, and it certainly would not if
the triple alliance intervened between
Spain and America."
The Pall Mall Gazette says: "The
sympathy of the Continent is no doubt
with Spain, just as it is in Great Brit
ain by an G-verwhelming majority with
the United States. But between sym
pathy and action a great gulf is fixed.
The time has gone by for European at
tempts at mediation."
The Westminster Gazette says there
need be no alarm about anti-United
States movements, adding: "A Euro
pean concert which excluded Great
Britain could not intervene with any
effect in the amphibious warfare which
is threatened, and it is perfectly cer
tain that no British Government would
be a consenting party to any sort of
intervention which is hostile or even
hampering to the United States. The
only way out is to compel Spain to ac
cept the substance of the American de
mands while she yet has a chance of
saving: her sovereignty in Cuba. That
chance is open for a few days more,
and while we do not fear the European
concert will coerce the United States,
there is still, we hope, a possibility that
a concert will persuade Spain."

Senate Recognizes the In=
dependence of the Isl=
and Republic.
War May Follow This Declara=
tion, Which Goes Further
Than the House
Resolution.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 16.
The United States Senate has spoken.
Its voice is for war â war until the saf
fron flag of Spain shall have been
furled in the Western Hemisphere, and
furled forever. Its voice, too, is for the
Independence of the infant republic of
the gem of the Antilles.
"Free Cuba and the independence of
the island republic" was the shibboleth
of the Senate throughout the four days
of debate which ended tp-night While
the verdict returned was decisive, it is
just to Bay that it was not final. Notes
of discordâ almost foreboding in their
tonesâ were sounded. This foreboding
was not due in any sense to anxiety
about the result of the impending con
flict It was prompted by a fear lest.
If the action taken by the Senate
Fhnuld ultimately be accepted as final,
this Oovernment might become in
volved In complications that in future
years would pr"\-.' serious.
At 9:10 o'clock the Davis resolutions,
those reported from the Committee on
Foreign Relations, amended so as to
include the recognition of the republic
of Cuba, were passed by a vote of 67
to 21, as a substitute for the resolution
adopted by the House of Representa
tives. All day long the contest waged
With an earnestness, energy, ability
and eloquence seldom equaled, even in
the Senate of the I'nited States. From
10 o'clock this morning until the mo
ment of the final vote the intensity of
the interest did not abate for an in
stant. Under the agreement limiting
the duration <>f the speeches, except in
specified Instances, to fifteen minutes,
every Senator who so desired had an
opportunity to express his views be
fore the voting began â after 7 o'clock
to-night. The greatest speech of the
day had been made by White of Cali
fornia, who has been consistently and
conscientiously opposed to action of
any kind upon the Cuban question.
The speech was a masterly oratorical
effort, and attracted profound atten
tion from every auditor. No less than
twenty-five Senators addressed them
selves to the momentous question un
der consideration during the day.
It was not until the first voteâ that
on the amendment of Turpie of In
diana, providing for recognition of the
Island republicâ had been taken that
the Senate was brought face to- face
with the tremendous consequence of its
action.
The scene In the chamber of many
historic debates was one of incompar
able solemnity and impressiveness. The
galleries, which had been filled to
their utmost capacity throughout the
day, were massed with brilliantly at
tired women and men distinguished in
all walks of public and private life. On
the floor was every member elected to
the Senate, save one. Walthall of Mis
sissippi, wlm was again detained from
his seat by Berioua illness. Probably
the most notable utterances of the clos
ing hours <>f debate were made to
right. Halo of Maine. Gorman of
Maryland and Allison ut lowa, Aldrich
of Rhode Island. Jones of Arkansas
and Hoar of Massachusetts, all deeply
impressed by the magnitude and pos
sible awful consequences of the step
about to be taken, addressed the Senate
â with an eloquence and solemnity born
only <rf the most profound feeling for
their country's welfare. As the words
fell from their lips the chamber thrilled
with an intensity of interest which bor
dered on awe.
The test vote quite naturally was on
tho amendment offered by Turple rec
ognizing the independence of the Cu
ban republic. It prevailed by a major
ity of 14, the vote being 51 to 37. By
political parties the vote was cast as
follows:
Ayesâ Republicans 11, Democrats 28,
Populists T, Silver Republicans o.
Noesâ Republicans 32. Democrats 5.
Upon the final vote the alignment of
parties was quite different from that
on the Turpie amendment. An analy
sts of it follows. Ayesâ Republicans 24,
Democrats 31, Populists 7. Silver Re
publicans 5, toial 67. Noes â Republi
cans 19, Democrats 2, total 21.
The resolution as finally agreed upon
by the Senate is as follows;
Whereas, The ahhorrent conditions
which have existed for more than tnree
yean in tho island of Cuba, so near our
own borders, have shocked the moral
Bense in the people of the United States.
have been a disgrace to Christian civil
ization, culminating as they have in the
destruction of a. United States battle-ship,
â with 2fW of Its officers and crew, while on
a friendly visit In the harbor of Havana,
and cannot longer be endured, as has
been set forth by the President of the
United States in his message to Con
gress of April 11. IS9S, upon which the
action of Congress was invited. There
fore.
Resolved, Py the Senate and House of
Representatives of the United States of
America, in Congress assembledâ
Klrstâ That ' ne people of the island of
Cuba are and of right ought to be free
nnd independent, and that the Govern
ment of the United States hereby recog
nizes the republic of Cuba as the true
and lawful Government of that Island.
Secondâ Th;it It is the duty of the Unit
ed States to demand, and the Govern
ment of the United States does hereby
demand, that the Government of Spain at
once relinquish its authority and govern
ment In the island of Cuba and withdraw
Its land and naval forces from Cuba and
Cuban waters.
Thirdâ That the President of the United
StÃtes be and he hereby Is directed and
empowered to ';se the entire land and
navnl forces of the United States, and
to call Into the actual service of the
United States the militia of the several
States to such extent as may be neces
sary to carry these resolutions Into ef
fect.
I'mirthâ That the United States hereby
disclaims iiny disposition or intention to
exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or con
trol over said Island, except for the paci
fication thereof, iuid asserts its determin
ation, when that is accomplished, to
leave the government and control of the
Island to its people.
In accordance wfui the agreement
reached last night the Senate convened
promptly at 10 o'clock, and. after the
transaction of some routine business, the
resolution of the Foreign Relations Com
\ mlttee was laid before the members. Few
I Senators were on the floor at the time,
I and Teller suggested waiting for a quo
rum, saying it was due to the Senators
i who were to speak. After about rifteen
minutes a quorum appeared.
Cannon of Utah was then recognized
and spoke in favor of immediate decisive
| action and for the recognition of the ln-
I dependence of the Cuban republic.
Allen of Nebraska said he wanted to
call attention to the remarkable scene
'â  that had occurred at the White House on
; April 7. He referred to the call of the
' representatives of the six great powers
â¢ upon the President and to the exchange
: of notes on the Hispano-American situ
ation. He declared that no similar scene
had ever been witnessed In this country.
""I want to register my protest," said
| Allen, "against the representatives of
the so-called powers of Europe entering
! the White House and telling this coun
try what it shall do. I cannot under
stand why the I're-sident did not inform
them that this country would not toler
, ate interference from them; yet here is
I the first step toward tne breaking down
; of the Monroe doctrine and the destruc- j
! tlon of the nation. And it is understood
i that these same so-called powers are
i to go further and to maKe another as
sault upon the White House with a more
pressing demand. Within six months
these same powers will be urging the
! United States to agree to arbitration in
I order that our liability for Spanish Cu
ban bonds may be determined."
Burrows of Michigan supported the po
sition assumed in this crisis by the Presi
dent, and argued against the recognition
I of the present republic of Cuba,
Platt of Connecticut, who, in accord
| ance with the agreement reached last
1 night, was accorded a half hour's time,
devoted to a strong and eloouent expres-
I sion of his hope for peace and a defense
of the President. He thought the time for j
oratorical and imnassioned utterances
had passed. Oratory would not bombard
1 Morro Castle; slinging angry words may
wound the President, but they cannot
pierce the armor of the Spanish battle
ships.
Platt believed that peace might have
been preserved had it not been for the
intemperate utterances of those who
seemed bent upon plunging the country
into war. He hoped, he said, that even
yet some way might be fc md of avert
ing war and at the same time securing
peace in Cuba. He said, however, that if
rur determined purpose to intervene to
l'i:t an end to conditions in the island of
Cuba should result in war, it must be so.
The United States would not be recreant
to its duty or to a great trust. He .eld
that the President and House of Repre-
Bentatives had placed the pending ques
tion upon high ground. The Senate was
called upon to place it on lower ground;
on untenable ground that would not oe
approved by the nations of the earth.
"I denlore itâ it is unpar_onable," de
clared Platt.
}\o thought to recognize the present re
public which General i-ee had testified
existed only in skeleton would be little
short of folly. Before extending such re
cognition Platt said it would be neces
sary for the United States to strike from
history the words of many of the na
tion's statesmen and to give up the Mon
roe doctrine. Platt concluded with an
appeal for calm and deliberate action
such as would be approved by all future
generations.
A strong appeal for the recognition of
the Independence of the present Cuban
republic was made by Bacon of Georgia.
In t '-ginning he said it was unfair to
charge that all Senators wno differed
fp'in the President upon this question
were hostile to him. He did not approve
of the President's message in its entire
ty, because it was impossible for him to
grant such power to a President as Mr.
McKlnley evidently desired.
Wellington of Maryland followed Bax-on,
and as he arose to speak there was a_stir
in the galleries. He said he was thor
oughly satisfied that there was no good
reason for the United States going to war
with Spain. No war could be Justified at
any time by any nation unless all diplo
matic agencies had been exhausted, and
he could not see that result in the mes
sage of the President.
'"I will vote for peace; T will stand for
peace as long as peace is possible." he
(aid. "I do not stand here as an apolo
gist for the Spanish policy. I believe the
people of Cuba had a right to rebel
figainst the colonial policy of Spain; but
w<- as a nation are outside the situation.
We have nothing to do with the rebellion
now going on in the island."
Wellington argued that the message of
the President has been wholly miscon
strued; that instead of an appeal to Con
gress to sanction war it was exactly the
reverse, but the war frenzy was abroad
and Congress was rushing hopelessly Into
hostilities. "The. President. I believe. In
his heart feels that war Is not necessary."
Wellington then read the closing para
graph of the President's message and,
placing his interpretation upon it, said
that the words indicated that the execu
tive still believed that the armistice
granted to the insurgents would yet work
out peace. Passing to the internal dis
sensions existing in Spain he said that
the United States would be rpsponsible
should the Carlists overthrow the present
dynasty, which he hoped would continue
many years. Upon the question of re
sponsibility as to the destruction of the
Maine Wellington passionately said that
he could not think that Spain blew up
our vessel.
"If so. then the responsibility rests upon
General Blanco, in command at Havana,
and I cannot believe that General Blan
co would sanction such an outrage. One
touch of nature makes the whole world
kin. even though the kinship be with a
Spaniard."
Wellington then recounted the deeds of
valor done by Marylanders. and said that i
while the conservative people of his StatP
agreed with him that war was not neces
sary, they and himself would be found
battling with the majority. In concluding
he said:
"If war must be, Maryland will be witii
you. but in this fateful hour she Is for
pence."
Turpie of Indiana, in order to make
perfectly clear the resolution reported by
the minority of the Foreign Relations
Committee, offered an amendment to in
sert after the word "independent" the
following:
"And the Government of the United
States hereby recognizes the republic of
Cuba as the true and lawful government
of that island."
Caffery was then recognized: "I have
stood before on the brink of war." he
said. "Although young then, I counseled
moderation, but my opinion was swept to
the winds and I was carried along with
my people, into the most colossal war in
the history of civilized nations. Our peo
ple were a unit then. If war Is to be
waged we ought to he a unit now. But
it seems that whoever dares to utter a
thought in opposition to hasty or ill-con
ceived action subjects himself to the gib
bet in the popular breast."
Caffery then entered upon a discussion
of the Cuban situation, declaring that it
was manifest that the power of Spain was
slowly dying in Cuba and that her sov
ereignty, without our interference, would
be swept from the island. Caffery main- I
talned that recognition was an executive '.
and not a legislative function.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 17, 1898.
i
"The adoption by the Senate of the res- j
olutlons reported by the minority of the
Foreign Relations Committee," he de- |
clared. "would be to stultify ourselves
and the President would be bound to veto |
those resolutions."
Caffery, speaking of recognition of the ;
insurgents, said: "States cannot be made i
like paper money, in which counterfeits
must necessarily play a most important
part." He thought the war fever must
be exceedingly strong to justify the ac
ceptance of a counterfeit, even under the
sweep of patriotism and enthusiasm
"Whose fight is it?" he vehemently ;
asked, "In which we are going to par
ticipate? It is not our fight, but a fight
between certain insurrectionary fac-
Uona in the island of Cuba and the Span- :
ish crown."
He then paid a glowing tribute to the
wisdom, the patience and the high pat
riotism of the President. Even without
intervention on our part it was the opin
ion of Qaffery that the island of Cuba
would be free; that in the very nature of
things Spain would have to relinquish her
hold in the western hemisphere. j
Hawley of Connecticut pronounced \
judgment upon the message of the Presi- \
dent as one of the great state papers
that would be justified in the light of his
tory. He criticised the resolutions as pre- j
sented and thought that to all intents
and purposes the House resolution more
nearly reached all the phases of this
complicated question than any reported.
White of California said he stood be
fore the Senate to address himself to the
most momentous question which had ever |
been brought to the attention of the j
American people. It was 'disagreeable to j
dissent from the committee view, to set i
aside the popular feeling. The plaudits !
of the people were always inspiring, but i
the Senate was confronted by a solemn
duty, a solemn responsibility, and so far j
as he was concerned he could no more
give up his convictions than he could
yield up his life. The Senate was here to |
face a war which now must come upon j
the country, but ho thought it not a mis- ,
carriage to consider the situation which j
confronted us.
"The record here made," said he, "will
live Â»â  long as reason and justice." No
body doubted, he said, that the Govern
ment of Spain had failed of its duty and
had misgoverned the island of Cuba.
No one doubted the issue of tHr. coming
war between Spain and the United
States. That the triumph of this coun
try would result was certain.
"But." said White, "our nation, with
its 70,000,000 people and vast resources, is
great enough to do exact justice. It has
been well and thoughtfully said that no
more sublime spectacle has ever been
presented than that of a great nation
sacrificing for justice its passion and its
pride."
White declared that in view of the re
cent action of Spain in making a large
! appropriation for tneTelief of the re
i concentrados and in abolishing the ~*lct
of concentration she had met the only
argument of many Senators in favor of
hostilities. Spain had swept their foot-
Ing from beneath them and they no
longer had standing in court.
In a magnificent peroration he said:
"Those of us who dissent from the ma
jority do so from dictates of conscience,
; but whatever resolution is passed pledg
ing this country to a declaration that
history will have to decide whether
; right or wrong you will find no deserters
!in the camp. We have our opinions, deep
I rooted perhaps and tirmly set, but we
i are all Americans. When that judgment
| is rendered there is but one action that
can be taken. Shoulder to shoulder, hand
in hand, we will march forward with
equal step to vindicate the conduct of
that Government which we believe t<>
be the best that Almighty God has per
mitted in all times, and on the morrow,
when this crisis shall come upon us. from
every housetop in the United States let
there be flung the stars and stripes."
Hawley of Connecticut introduced and
asked immediate consideration for the
following resolution:
"Resolved, That the President is hereby
authorized in his discretion and with
such limitations and exceptions as shall
seem to him expedient to prohibit the ex
port of coal or other material used in war
from any sub-port of the United States,
until otherwise ordered by Congress."
Cockrell of Missouri asked what the ef
fect of such a resolution would be.
Hawley remarked that it would put a
stop to the export of coal and prohibit
its going to Spanish ships, which was
of more value to them than powder.
Pettus of Alabama said that such a
procedure was against the law and he
thought that so radical a measure must
be ordered by Congress, and that Con
gress should not invest the power in the
hands of the President.
Hawley, realizing the force of the ob
jection, changed the resolution Into a bill,
but it went over upon an objection of
Gorman of Maryland.
Bate- of Tennessee addressed the Senate
for fifteen minutes In a speech urging the
recognition of the present Cuban govern
ment as Independent, and said that he
would support the minority amendment.
Clark of Wyoming said that whatever
might be the final wording of the resolu
tions adopted by Congress they could
mean only warâ war with one of the most
cruel and barbarous nations in the world.
In the circumstances the nation should
not hesitate. He had hoped that a peace
ful solution of the difficulty might have
been found, but although the President
had acted with a dignity, equanimity and
patriotism seldom equaled, war was at
hand. The diplomacy of the entire world
could not now prevent it. For the mur
der of the heroes of the Maine war was
the only reparation. Despite the belief of
Senators, the evidence of our court of in
quiry was such that If it were submitted
to any court in the land a verdict of mur
der in the first degree would be returned.
Pascoe of Florida spoke in favor of the
recognition of the independence of the
Cuban republic. He believed, too, that
when our troops were landed, in Cuba
they ought to act in concert with the
forces under General Gomez.
The other Senator from Florida (Mal
lory) said none desired war if that calam
ity could be averted, and he regretted
that the President had suspended diplo
matic negotiations, for through them war
might have been averted.
Faulkner of West Virginia thought only
one of two courses was open to this
country, either to submit to the Indigni
ties, insults and crimes of Spain or that
the American Congress should make such
an utterance as would remove every
doubt as to her intention to present the
question for arbitrament by the sword.
The mailed hand of oppression must be
lifted from the lacerated shoulders of
Cuba.
Wilson of Washington spoke In favor of
the majority resolution. "We want less
oratory and more powder; less rhetoric
and more rams," he said. Patriotism,
said he. was higher than business inter
ests; love of country dearer than dollars.
Pettus of Alabama followed Wilson, .and
attacked the House resolution as being
unconstitutional. He insisted that Con
gress had the right to declare war, and
said that the President â  was in his high
office to execute the mandate of Congress.
He bitterly arraigned the President's Sen
atorial advisers, saying that the Senate
was the executive's advisers not his Sena
torial friends.
MeEnery of Louisiana said he would
vote for the recognition of the Cuban re
public, closing his remarks with a tribute
to a reunjfed country as is belnjj wit
nessed to-day.
Gear of lowa supported the majority
resolution.
Gallinger of Now Hampshire read a
number of autograph Utters from Cuban
military commanders, showing the high
patriotism which actuated them in their
struggle for liberty.
Elkins of West Virginia said it was
plain war was inevitable and could not
bo avoided. His reasons in opposing the
recognition of Cuba were: The Insur
gents had not won their independence as
nations seeking recognition always have'
the insurgent government is by its con
stitution only temporary, and such recog
nition was contrary to American doc
trines for a hundred years. He thought
the resolutions as presented by the For
eign Relations Committee ought to be
amended so as to provide that the recog
nition should be given by the Presidentâ
the only power that could give It. El
kins challenged the statements' of Proc
tor as to the conditions on the island
Proctorâ Will the Senator accept the
statements in the Consular reports?
Elkinsâ l'd a thousand times rather ac
cept your statements, but there are other
men not. perhaps, so eminent as the Sen
ator from Vermont, who report a state
of affairs entirely different from that re
ported to this Senate.
Elkins declared that the T T nited States
ought to take Cuba, Porto Rico and the
Philippine Islands in order that we might
have some compensation for the enor- '
mous war debt. If. afterward, it was de- â 
sired to give the Cubans their independ- :
ence, he was willing, as he had always
believed they ought to have It.
Clay of Georgia said he was anxious to
see the question adjusted without war
for the people of the South did not want
war; but as war was now inevitable, he
believed in making it upon the best reso
lution offered. These, he thought, were
those submitted by the minority.
Proctor replied to some of the state
ments made by Elkins. The latter, ho
said, had received his information from
Mr. Atkins of Boston, whose sugar plan
tation, had been protected by the Span
ish troops. He thought it too late now to
talk. War was upon us and we ought
to meet it with united front.
Pritchard of North Carolina contented
himself with announcing, after a brief
eulogy of the President, that he would
support the House resolution.
Nelson of Minnesota declared that the
question as to the power of the President
to recognize the Cuban republic was irrel
evant. Congress had the authority and
ought to exercise itâ to accept that brave
young republic as our ally in the coming
war.
Perkins of California announced him
self in favor of recognition ot the Inde
pendence of Cuba. The assassination of
the sailors of the Maine was sufficient
warrant for us to go to war.
Thurston of Nebraska, who followed
him. declared his intention to vote to rec
ognize the republic of Cuba. He was a
Republican, and he had been urged by
every Republican to vote against the in
dependence resolution because it was of
Democratic origin. But on this matter
he was more than a Republican, he was
an American citizen.
Morgan of Alabama defined his posi
tion briefly, giving his reasons for de
clining to concur in the minority reso
lution to recognize the independence of
the republic. His position was not mis
understood by the Cuban people. His
views had been submitted to President
Palma and were concurred in by him.
He said he would not recognize the inde
pendence without a stipulation which
would prevent the possibility of General
Gomez making a treaty with Spain that
would leave us in the lurch.
After Kenny of Delaw-are had stated
his position in favor of the recognition of
independence the debate came to an
abrupt close. Senator Hale and several
other Senators who were scheduled to
present their views refrained.
When the bell rang for a .vote at ex
actly 7:30 p. m. there was a great stir in
the Senate and in the galleries. Senators
came trooping in from the cloakrooms,
and the spectators, many of whom had
been in the galleries for twelve hours,
leaned over impatiently.
The first vote was taken upon the
amendment of the minority of the For
eign Relations Committee, which pro
vided for the recognition by the United
States of the ' .nerublic of Cuba as the
true and lawful Government* of that Isl
and." It was adopted, 51 to 37, as fol
lows:
Ayps-Allen, Bacon, Baker. Bate. Berry. But

Daniel, Foraker. Gallinger, Harris. Heitfeld.

37.
Davis then offered an amendment as an
additional section as follows:
Fourthâ That the Unltpd States hereby dis
claim any disposition or Intention to exercise
sovereignty, jurisdiction or control over said
island, except for the pacification thereof, and
assert Its determination when this i? accom
plished to leave the government and control of
the Island to its people.
"That's right," came in chorus from
all portions of the chamber when the
amendment was read. It was adopted
without a dissenting vote.
Frye moved to strike out of the first
section declaring that the people of the
island of Cuba "are and of right ought
to be free and independent," the words
"are and of right."
On motion of Davis the motion was
laid on the table, s"i to 33.
Morgan then offered his substitute for
a declaration of war. It was laid on the
table, ayes S3, nays 5. The nays were
Mason, Morgan, Pettigrew, Turner and
Wilson.
The supremo moment had come. Hale
of Maine, who has been the. mainstay of
the opposition to radical action on the
Cuban auestion, arose. His first words
bounded a warning.
"The action the Senate is about to
take." he began, speaking slowly and im
pressively, "places it in a deadlock with
the House and the President of the
Vnited States. It is a remarkable spec- j
tacle we are presenting to the civilized
world."
But he got no further. Teller and Wol
cott were both on their feet. The latter
declared passionately that Hale's state- ;
ment was most impertinent. He said as a J
Republican he demanded, to know upon i
what authority it was made. "I ask the |
Senator whether lie is authorized by the j
President to declare that our cr.ntemplat- I
ed action will place us in deadlock with ]
the President."
Before he could reply. Teller made the
point of order that it was unparliament
ary for a Senator to refer to the action
lie House or the President. The Vice
iident read the rule and asked Hale
iroceed in order. The latter said he
losed briefly to state the reasons for
opening statement. He did not pre
l, he said, to speak by authority of
the President, or to know in any con
tingency his future action. "But I do
know if the motion of the Senator from
Inesota prevails," he continued, "it
bring the Senate into deadlock with
President, as shown by the message
las submitted to us."
Her again called Hale to order, and
in the Vice-President had the rule
rt ad. Hale seemed but slightly disturbed
by these interruptions. Proceeding again,
he commented upon the remarkable spec
tacle the Senate presented.
"We are not asked to legislate," he con
tinued, "upon ordinary matters, but upon
a grave national question that involves
war. It is proposed here to disregard the
leadership of the chief magistrate. He
has left us in no doubt as to the lines
of policy which may compel us to enti-r
upon war, if such it is to be. with Spain.
He has told us that the conditions in
Cuba are not such as will permit our
recognition of the republic of Cuba, He
has blazed the policy. The war in Cuba
must stop. Nothing is plainer than that
Intervention is to be resorted to, and he
asks to be instructed to use the army
and navy for that purpose. And now
here, to-day, with this policy marked out,
witli everything we desire about to be
consummated, with freedom to Cuba as
sured and intervention by arms, if nec
essary, decided upon, the President is to
be confronted by the Senate's effort to
define another policy. We are to thrust
this resolution in his face, a resolution
he has declare^ he dov not believe in
and does not want. The chief executive
is the nearest approach to a ruler this
country knows. Shall he be opposed?"
Proceeding, Hale expressed the deep
sense of regret with which he had. in
the last few days, witnessed the melting
away of the spirit of conservative senti
ment in the Senate. Senators who had
opposed the recognition of the independ
ence of Cuba had one by one, and day by
day, come into line for that declaration.
Gorman followed Hale, and by his man
ner, by the vehemence of his utterances,
showed how greatly he felt the gravity
.of the situation. He counseled a temper
ate policy and invoked that the rancor
of the debate be eliminated from the oc
casion. He criticized the attacks made
by Senators upon the President as the
commander-in-chief of the army and
navy, and forcibly declared that party
politics should give way to a higher duty
In the determination of the question. He
questioned the wisdom of the resolution
as adopted, and hoped that wiser counsels
would prevail. He said that the open crit
icism of the President was to be depre
cated, and he wished the record as made
up might be blotted forever, and only a
united people shown uppermost to the
world.
He closed amid profound stillness, and
the occasion was worthy a place in the
history of nations. He said: "I pledge
myself to forget that McKinley was elect
ed by the Republican party, because I
know and believe that as President of a
united people he will bear his country's
flag aloft, and that no nation, Spanish
or otherwise, will receive from him aught
else, than that fair, manly and brave
treatment of an American President."
Allison of lowa, seemingly laboring un
der intense excitement, said that no man
could doubt his loyalty to the country or
the Hag, but he seriously doubt
ed the wisdom of doing that which
had been a question of controversy since
the days of Washington down to the
present time, an assumption of Congress
to deciare the independence of a nation
in contravention of the well-known prin
ciple of international law. He said the
amendment had been forced into the res
olution in the face of the fact that the
I'resident did not counsel or even advise
Buch action, but Â£>n the other hand, had
declared emphatically against it. He said
the present Cuban republic was but a
skeleton government and under the
forms prescribed might, with entire pro
priety, in its own good time, enter into a
convention with Spain to the exclusion of
the United States. He argued that the
republic of Cuba should be recognized by
treaty, the initiative to be taken by the
President, as is his lawful right, thereby
making n case for ourselves which na
tions of the world could not question. He
outlined the disagreement probable be
tween the two houses and guardedly
hinted at the c ference which would be
necessary, and from which the represen
tatives of all parties united, and which,
in the ligiu of history now making, would
stand the assaults of international law.
Aldrich of Rhode Island said that, while
he could not vote for a resolution em
bodying recognition of independence, he
believed that in some way â somehow â a
resolution would, during the next forty
eight hours, be presented that would be
satisfactory to the President, to Congress
and to the people.
The vote on Davis' motion to strike out
all after the resolving clause of the
House resolution and insert the Senate
resolutions as amended was carried by a
vote of 60 to 28. The detailed vote follows:
Ayesâ Allen, Bacon, Baker, Hate, Berry. But
ler. Cannon. Chandler. Chilton. Clark. Clay,
Cockrell, Cullom, Dan'el, Davis, Faulkner,

Gorman, Gray, Hale. Hanna, Hawley, Hoar,
McÃride, McMillan. Morrill, Platt of Con
necticut, Platt of New York. Pritchard, Sewell.
Spooner. Warren, Wellington, Wetmore and
Wilsonâ 2B.
Hoar then took the floor. He said he
could not vote for the resolutions as
I amended, because they undertook to rob
the President of a constitutional prerog
ative. Furthermore, to carry the reso
lution into effect the American forces in
I Cuba would be under the command of
the Insurgent officers. Otherwise the
! presence of our troops there would be
j hostile to the insurgents. Hoar's speech
I was the last display of oratory of the
. day.
At five minutes past 9 the third and
i final reading of the resolution as amend
, ed was begun.
Immediately afterward came the ques
tion: "Shall the resolution pass?" There
! was a general demand for an aye and no
expression on the question, and a roll call
was ordered. It proceeded in the midst
lof a profound calm. Not a single pair
j was announced. All the Senators, with
the one exception of Waltball, were pres
ent, and he had released Spooner from
j his engagement to pair with him. The
| roll call resulted in the passage of the
resolution by the vote of 67 to 21, as fol
lows:
Aye?â Allen, Baron, Baker. Bate, Berry, But
ler. Cannon, Carter, Chandler, Chilton, Clark,
Cockrell, Cullom, Clay, Daniel, Davis, Deboe,
Faulkner. Foraker, Frve, Gallinger. Gear, Gor
man, Gray. Hansbrough, Harris, Heltfeld.
Jones of Arkansas. Jones of Nevada, Kenny,
Kyle, Lodge, Lindsay. McEnery, McLaurin,
Mallory. Mantle, Martin, Mason, Mills,
Mitchell. Money, Morgan. Murphy, Nelson,
Pasco. Penrosp, Perkins, Pettiprew, Pettus,
Proctor, Quay, Rawllns, Roach. Shoup, Smith,
Stewart, Teller, Thurston, Tillman, Turley,
Turner, Turpie, Vest, Warren, Wilson, Wol
cottâ67.
Noes â Aldrich. Allison, Burrows, Cattery.
Elklns, Fairbanks. Hale, Hanna. Hawley,
Hoar, McÃride. McMillan, Morrill, Platt of
Connecticut, Flatt nf New York, Pritchard,
Sewell, Spooner, Wellington, Wetmore, White
â21.
There was some confusion, hut no dem
onstration, when the result was an
nounced.
The title and preamble of the Senate
resolution were then substituted for the
House title and preamble without divi
sion.
Davis moved that the Senate insist upon
its amendments and ask for conference.
This request was met with cries of "No,
no." and it was soon made manifest that
many Senators considered that there was
a possibility that the House would con
cur with the Senate resolution if this
' motion were not entered in the Senate.
â¢ Upon this suggestion Davis withdrew hi*
j motion and in its stead entered a motion
I to adjourn.
Before the motion was put and an
; pounced at 9:15 p. m. that the Senate ad
journ till Monday at 10 a. m., half
i the Senators had left their seats, and
: fifteen minutes afterward the great white
Capitol, which had been such a scene of
life and such a center of interest for the
i long day. was deserted by all save the
i newspaper workers and a few employes.

tuted. That -will now go back to the j
House and the question will come on i
concurring in the Senate amendment to
the House resolution. The House will
vote to non-conoir and a conference
will be ordered. The majority of the
conferees on the part of the House will
be in favor of the House resolutions, |
and will stand out for them. The con- '.
ferees on the part of the Senate will :
stand out for their resolution. The
first report will robably be a disagree
ment and each house will then have an
opportunity to recede from its position.
Neither is expected to do so and further
conferences will be ordered.
The indications are that the final re
sults will be a compromise. After the
decisive majority by which the House
resolution was defeated in the Senate
it is not believed that body will accept
and the Republican majority of the
House is equally determined not to take
the Senate resolution in the form in
which it was adopted.
Speaker Reed gave his assurance to
Senators who consulted him to-day that
the House would never agree to resolu
tions recognizing the present so-called
republic of Cuba. I have talked with a
large number of leading Republicans in
the House to-day representing all
shades of opinion and I find that oppo
sition to recognizing the present gov
ernment has been greatly strengthened
by arguments which have been made in
the Senate during the last few days.
Senator Spooner's speech yesterday
was particularly effective in this direc
tion. The weight of opinion among Re
publican representatives was that the
resolution that would be finally agreed
to by both housea would be substan
tially the same resolution as reported
by the Committee on Foreign Relations
without the Foraker amendment recog
nizing the pres<-.it so-called government
of Cuba.REVIEW OF

DUBLIN. April 2.â Mrs. Parnell, the
uother of the great Irish leader, was
juried yesterday in the same plot as
contains the remains of her son in
Glasnevin Cemetery on the northern
outskirts of this <ity. The venerable
lady died at the ancestral home of the
Parnell family in Avondale, County
Wlcklow, early in the past week, of
heart disease consequent on injuries by
burning:. She was sitting- at the fire
in the study, when some cinders flew
on her clothes and set them aflame,
and being somewhat feeble she was
unable either to extricate herself or
call for help In time. The result was
her death after a couple of days' suf
f>ring. As a matter of course, the
â¢ has excited in Ireland considera
ble feeling, and the funeral yesterday,
rdingly, was attended by a very
larere concourse of citizens of Dublin
and of people from the country.
It will be of special interest to nmer- j
to know that among the floral
tributes of r> speet paid to the deceased
was a wreath placed on the coffin by
American Consul in Dublin at the '
st of Colonel John Hay, the j
United States Embassador in London, j
Tlie explanation, of course, of this act I
of courtesy lies in the fact that Mrs.
ell'a father was Commodore Stew
art, or, as he was called, "Old Iron
sides," of the American navy. It was
after this grandfather, I may add, that I
Charles St. -wart Parnell was called.
Mrs. Parnel] herself lived a eonsidera- |
ble portion of her life in the United >
States, and did not live there alto
gether a private life. She was a very
Intelligent and active-minded woman, i
and it was from hpr undoubtedly that {
her most distinguished son derived his i
Intellectual qualities. The Parnell fam- !
lly have certainly not been very for- j
tunate. In addition to the premature
death of Charles Stewart Parnell and
the somewhat tragic death of his
mother, the family estates are, I regret
ly, gravely, if not hopelessly, In
cunabered, and even the family man-
Bion at Avondale seems in danger of
passing into the hands of strangers,
y.t there has scarcely ever been a I
family which deserved better of their
countrymen.
Charles Stewart Parnell was only!
the la^t >if it.s members who were dis- !
tinguished as patriots. Sir John Par- j
noli. Chancellor of the Irish Ex
chequer, was one of those members of
the Irish Parliament who resisted all
sorts of bribes and intimidation to
make him vote for the Union in ISOO.
William Parnell, one of the members j
for Wicklow, was one of the most j
prominent advocates o-f Catholic eman
cipation in the early years of the cen
tury, and the role he filled was taken
up with even greater effect later on by j
Sir Henry Parnell, one of the members j
for Queens County. It would, assur- :
edly, br- a pity if such a stuck were to
be heard of no more in the history of
Ireland, though, Indeed, the fate of
Charles Stewart Parnell is not one cal
culated to induce those belonging to it
to follow In his footsteps.
Another very prominent personage in
Irish life has passed away this week in I
the person '>f Sir John Arnott. That!
gentleman was not, however, an Irish- |
man at all, hut a Scotchman who came I
to und settled in Ireland many years
ago, and not only made a vast fortune,
but spent it liberally in the country of
his adoption. Commerce was :is line,
and he founded and continued till his
death to own a considerable Interest in |
drapery houses in Dublin and Cork.
But he did not confine himself to
commerce, popularly so called. Ho pur-
Cha^d several years ago the Dublin
newspaper known as the Irish Times, I
which under his ownership has ad- j
vanced to the front rank among Irish ;
newspaper enterprises. In his later life :
he aspired to the position of an Irish
country gentleman, and bought the j
Bandon (County cork) estates of the j
Duke of Devonshire for a sum amount- j
Ing almost to a quarter of a million
sterling. His popularity, especially in (
<oik, was great, and it was the more
rkable as he differed in politics
from the majority of the Irish people.
â¢;â¢â  was a conservative of a very
unaggressive and unoffending type, and
his public benefactions were always on
a very liberal scale.
lie was for a short time a member of
Parliament as representative of the
small borough of Kinsal<\ and while at j
Westminster he linked his name with
at least one considerable and mest ben
eficial reformâ that of the boarding out
of pauper children. Up to tins- time fV "Â°
children of the poor in the Iris'i work
houses were brought up with theii iÂ«...
ents in those institutions and were
d very badly. Owing to his ex
ertions an act of Parlfament was
â 1. owing to which ever since they
been boarded out at the public
c with such farmers in the coun
try as have been willing to take them,
â¢â â nil the result has been most beneficial.
This was not the only proof of his prac
tical solicitude for the poor. At one
time he kept his ship-bull. ling yards In
Cork open for a considerable time at a
loss for the benefit of his om
: J . who would otherwise W itli their
families, have been left penniless and ;
homeless. He was the first also to pro- i
pose and set about carrying into exe
cution a plan for the better housine of
the Irish poor. About fifteen years atro
he bought large tracts of land in the
neighborhood of Dublin in which he
built hundreds of comfortable homes
for artisans. About the same time he
offered to cleanse the River Liffey free
of cost to the citizens of Dublin thoueh
nothing came of the proposal. He was
also an enthusiastic sportsman and
won the first "ocean yacht race" be
tween Dublin and Queenstown. No

Parliament, as far as Ireland is con
cerned, adjourned yesterday for the j
Easter recess, but for a whole week at i
least before it was pretty busy with
Irish affairs. Among other matters |
discussed was another Irish land bill. â 
The measure was a small one and
merely proposed to correct a few de
fects In the existing code; but it was
vehemently opposed by the represent- j
atives of the landlords and also by the
Government, and, of course, rejected.

Nor is it likely that another Irish land
bill will be passed for a considerable
time to come. The present govern
ment is not, of course, naturally dis
posed to pass land bills for the benefit
of the tenants of Ireland, and the re
port of the last Royal Commission ap
pointed to inquire into the working of
the Irish land code will stand as a per
manent barrier against a land bill de
signed for the benefit of the landlords.
The commission in question â known as
the "Fry Commission" â consisted of Sir
Edward Fry. an ex-Judge of the Eng
lish High Court; of Dr. Traill, a rep
resentative Irish landlord, as well as
a fellow of Trinity College; Mr. George
Fottrell, a crown official, supposed to
be in sympathy with the tenants; of a
Scotch tenant farmer and an English
land valuator and auctioneer. The com
mission was appointed at the Instance
of the landlords, and the expectations
entertained in regard to it by the land

lord body were correspondingly great.
But the verdict of the commission ns
embodied in its report published a short
time ago has been a great disappoint
ment to both sides. It is virtually a
verdict against the landlords. These
latter had formulated a terrific indict
ment against the administrators of the
land acts, and the Commissioners have
practically said to that charge, "Not
guilty." This pronouncement closes
the controversy for years to come, at
least so far as the landlords are con
cerned, for, when their own represent
ative in the commission pronounces
himself against them in the main poini,
it is vain for them to endeavor to keep
the controversy alive. The best thing
they can do now is to sell out to their
tenants, and, if they sell at present,
they will have an opportunity of doing
well for themselves which may not re

The probability, on the whole, is that
they will now have sense. The ques
tion Is, whether the tenants will have
sense also and stand out for good bar
gains.
The interest here in the relations be
tween Spain and the United States is
very general and very great. Needless
to say. the Irish people almost univer
sally sympathize with the American
people, and that on two grounds:
First, they are naturally on the side of
the Cubans, who are struggling to be
free. "Haud ignara mail, miseris suc
currere disco." But above and beyond
the feeling in favor of Cuba is the feel
ing that the United States has been the
chief refuge of the exiled Irish for at
least half a century. Not that there is
not also a general sympathy, apart
from this present crisis, with Spain
too. Between Ireland and Spain there
has been a long historical connection.

Spain was one of those countries to
which the Irish fled in droves in the
days of religious persecution and where
many of them rose to eminence. An
O'Donnell even at this day, I believe,
Is to be found in the Spanish Ministry.
But when it comes to a question of
choosing between Spain and the United
States there is no hesitation in the Irish
mind, and consequently most Irishmen
hope that if war breaks out Irish-
Americans will be found in the very
van of the army of the stars and
stripes. As yet no demonstrations have
taken place in Ireland on this matter,
but if war does break out demonstra
tions there will be and plenty.
The distress in the west continues
very acute, and the action of the Gov
ernment in regard to it very heartless.
The latter has not taken a single ex
ceptional step to relieve it which in
volves an expenditure of Imperial
funds. What they have done Is simply
THE EMPORIUM.

to authorize the local authorities to
spend some money in giving relief to
the most destitute outside the work
houses and in starting some public
works. The money thus expended will
eventually come out of the pockets of
people, some of whom are themselves
not far removed from pauperism and
will hereafter form a crushing burden
on the smaller ratepayers. Besides, if
it were not supplemented by the ef
forts of charitable people both in Eng
land and Ireland it would be utterly
insufficient to meet the crisis which
has arisen. Fortunately, up to the
present those charitable efforts have
been on such a scale that no great dis
aster has occurred. The question is
whether they will be continued till this
year's potato crop has come to ma
turity or till the distressed people, most
of whom emigrate to England every
year for work, are able to earn the
means of subsistence.

REPUBLICAN ORGANIZATIONS.
REPORTS of the proceedings at the meeting on
Friday evening of the Young Men's Kepubli
â i * lakland will be read with grati
fication by loyal Republicans throughout the State.
I he sentiment of the meeting was harmony and the
result was effective organization for campaign work.
Upward of 400 name, were signed to the ciub rolls
at the meeting, and it is believed that within a week
there wiil be 1000 members enrolled.
< Mil- of the influences most potent in establishing
â :y and bringing about so largo an enrollment
was the emphatic declaration of President Breed that
the league has not indorsed nor is working in the in
terest of any candidate for any office. "After the
State convention is over," he said, "we will get behind
all Republican candidates and work with all our
might for their election, but not until then. It is our
purpose now to build up a strong party organization,
loyal to Republicanism, but not to individuals striving
foi nomination."
Ihe true basis and scope of Republican action at
this time is expressed in that declaration. The time
has come for Republicans to begin in earnest and
with zeal the task of party organization, but the time
â  has not come for the nomination of candidates. In
dividual preferences for particular men must for the
present be laid aside so as to bring about a complete
union of all Republicans within the fold of the party
otganization. When that has been done a way will
have been made for securing to every member of the
party an equal opportunity to work inside the party
line's for the nomination, of his candidate. Thus the
majority will have a free and fair field for the ex
pression of its choice, and there will be no ill-feeling
in the ranks after the choice has been made.
To secure a full expression of the will of the major
ity of the working rank and file of the party is the
main object of urging a comprehensive organization
at this time. The county and State conventions
should represent the whole party and not a clique.
The nominations must be made by the untrammeled
delegates of the voters, and not from a slate made up
by the bosses in secret council. A free and fair field
for all Republicans will menu victory at the polls, but
boss domination, even in thi year of Republican su
premacy and prosperity, would endanger the victory
for protection and sound money which is so impor
tant, not only to the State, but to the nation.
For these reason- the effective work done in the
organization of the Young Men's Republican League
Club in Alameda County is a matter for general con
gratulations by Republicans. The example thus con
spicuously set should be promptly followed else
where. The Call has repeatedly urged the importance
of thorough organization at this time. Democrats
are already at work. Republicans cannot afford to
delay.
Doctors are having much debate over the state of
mind of one Lynn, whose attempt to kill his wife
brought him under official displeasure. The man was
pretending at first, but seems to have developed him
self into a genuine and saving state of lunacy. It is
impossible not to feel regret that science is not in
this instance permitted to ascertain the truth by
means of an autopsy.
Spanish papers are already claiming the first vic
tory in having made the United States come upon
ground desired by the Spanish. This is all too mod
est. Why should they overlook the glorious triumph
achieved when the Maine went down?
It is .remarked that few high in command in the
army are graduates of West Point. Nevertheless,
they have had a practical education in the art of war!
and some West Pointers still have this to acquire, and
good chance of doing so.
According to one Spanish authority there is not a
â¢soldier in bur army who will fight. If this is true we
are in a bad way. Let us continue to hope while we
:nay that the Spanish authority is in error.
The Queen Regent frets unnecessarily about al
lowing "tarnish put on the prestige of Spain." It
can't be done. There is no room for more tarnish.
Blanco says he would rather die than surrender.
Other good soldiers have felt the same way, and yet
changed their minds.
The powers are presumptuous in the threat to take
a hand in the present game. Not one of them has a
chip in the pot.
Nobody ever dreamed that even the exigencies of
war could result in Fitzhugh Lee's being called a
Yankee.
THE CAMPAIGN OF TREASON.
' ZHJ YEN in time of peace, with no war in sight,
it is held to be a crime to reveal the means of
â 4 a nation's defense, in the shape of concealed
batteries, mines, torpedoes and other effective pre
parations, the best use of which depends upon these
locations being known only to those whose official
authority puts upon them the responsibility of de
fense and offense.
Benedict Arnold's crime was less in the transfer of
his sword tp the enemy than in revealing to that
enemy the means by which a Government fortified
post might be surprised and taken. The potent pas
sion roused in France against Captain Dreyfus had
for its cause the charge, whether true or false, that
he had communicated the French means of defense
to Germany.
The Examiner has printed a chart of the entrance
to San Francisco harbor, with the location of its sub
marine defenses. Each one is indicated with pre
tended accuracy, and the information, being made
public, is put within reach of Spain for her use and
benefit if her fleets or privateers come this way. It is
not only a criminal act of bad faith, but an act of
treason and disloyalty. While it is highly probable
that the chart is a lie, a fake begotten in the innate
scoundrelism of yellow journalism, it is an indication
of what the country is to expect from the same source
during the war that is to come. A paper that would
sneak a reporter on an American man-of-war as
a stoker on her trial trip in order to gain a pretended
acquisition of knowledge to be used in a lying attack
upon her construction and efficiency is very natur
ally guilty of any form of treason to the Government,
even when the situation is grave and high interests
are at stake.
During war such a paper will bribe and suborn to
get at the confidential plans of campaign, the con
clusions of councils of war, the object of secret ex
peditions on land and sea, the policies of the Govern
ment and other grave matters, the revelation of which
embarrasses the administration and costs life and
treasure. The course of Hearst's two criminal pa
pers and of certain ruling members of the minority
in Congress make it plain to every loyal citizen that
in partisan desperation they hope for the defeat of
their country's arms and will contribute to it in
order to discredit the administration and make poli
tics for the fall elections. If this judgment seem
harsh those whose flagrant conduct and disloyal ut
terances justify it are responsible for it.
To make defeat probable they howled for war and
tried by lying to lash public opinion into fury at a
time when the country was so unprepared that it j
would have inevitably faced six months of defeat,
making unsuccessful war without ships, guns, com
missary, transports or powder. At the same time it
would have had the cost of offensive preparation
more than doubled.
But that is what the calamity howlers wanted.
They had shouted commercial disaster until nature
out of her bounty had proved them liars. Unable to
so destroy credit and confidence as to bring distress
upon their country in time of peace, they were willing
to bring it by plunging it into war unprepared. The
President restrained them until he could gain time
to prepare the nation. He has created a navy by
the purchase of ships abroad which could not have
been bought during war. because their sale would
have violated international neutrality under the rule
we established in the Alabama case. He has gained
time for the making of powder and ammunition, of
cannon, small arms, tents, equipments and trans
ports. He has organized the commissary, and with
almost incredible energy has put the country on a
war footing. His requital for this service is in vile
abuse, lying misrepresentation, heartless slander and
false ascription of motives which would have been
disgraceful to Xero at the zenith of his infamy.
When his preparations are complete these ill
wishers of their country are now trying to make
them inadequate by challenging Continental Europe
to combat by the form of Congressional declaration,
lie kept the issue where it might have been decided
by victory in a single action at arms against Spain.
They are trying to shift it to grounds where its de
cision by such action is hardly possible and where it
may be met by the most formidable alliance of mod
ern times.
He may be compelled to fight on the ground dic
tated by these calamity howlers, and, if so, they stand
ready to hamper him by every means that falsehood
and hypocrisy can use to destroy public confidence
and bring national calamity.
The Examiner is a worthy organ of such a combi
nation, and its early entry upon the field as a spy for
the enemy is in line with their policy.
WINE IN SOUTH AMERICA.
A SERIES of reports on the wine trade of South
American countries just received by the State
Department and published in Consular Reports
for April contain a great deal of information of in
terest to Californians generally which may prove of
value to our wine-makers by revealing to them the
conditions under which they may find a large market
for their produce.
The reports do not cover all South American
countries, but as those published were made in com
pliance with instructions from the department it is
probable that future reports will be made from coun
tries and ports now omitted. Enough is given, how
ever, to show that a large amount of wine is used
among the people of South America, and that the
United States has virtually notie of the trade.
Consul-General Townes reports from Rio 'Janeiro
that the use of table wines is very general throughout
Brazil among the rich and the poor, its use being re
garded as essential to health in that climate. He gives
statistics showing large importations from Europe,
but none from this country. The Consul at Para re
ports that the wine imported in that portion of Brazil
is mainly from Portugal, a fact which he attributes
to the natural preference of the Portuguese import
ers who control the wine trade there for the wines
of their own country.
Consul Dobbs reports from Valparaiso that the
United States has almost no trade with Chile in
wine. The largest importations from any one coun
try are from Great Britain. In 1895 there were re
ceived at Valparaiso from Great Britain red wine to
the value of $35.4.32 in bottles ai,d $2280 in barrels,
and white wine to the value of $71,926 in bottles and
$24,954 in barrels. Importations from France and
Germany followed closely after Great Britain in
value, while the United States appears with the record
of havinf furnished Valparaiso that year with the sum
total of $30 worth of red wine in bottles and none in
barrels.
The record runs very much the same at all the
ports from which reports have been received, and
these include, in addition to those named, Bahia,
Pcrnambuco. Iquique. Antofagasta and Paysandu.
The report from Iquique says: "Practically there is
no importation of United States wine. Small ven
tures in this line were made in 1891, during the revo
THE SAX FBAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 17, 1898.
lution, when shipments were made from California.
The wine was of good quality, but the prices were so
high as to debar future orders. This may be ex
plained, perhaps, by the high rate of freights between
San Francisco and Iquique."
Whether it be the high rate of freights or not, it is
certain from these reports that a large market for
winÂ« lies to the south of us and we are not getting
any of the benefits of it. It will be worth while for
our dealers to inquire more closely into the matter.
It ought to be possible to ship wine from San Fran
cisco to Chilean ports as cheaply as is shipped there
from Great Britain, particularly as the British have to
import the wine before they ship it.
A SUNDAY SERMON.
\A ATERIAL for a powerful sermon might be
/ \ found in the career of James D. Page, who on
Friday was sentenced by Judge Wallace to
serve eight years in Folsom prison for embezzlement.
A few years ago Page was a rising young lawyer in
San Francisco. He had influential connections and held
a respectable position among the members of the
legal profession. Like most young lawyers, he early
took a hand in politics, and, being "popular," his
large number of friends elected him to the office of
District Attorney.
His elevation to this position seemed to intoxicate
him. For a while he ran wild and his capacity Jo
discharge his duties was tried to the utmost. Prac
tically he made a failure of the District Attorney's
office, though no large scandals disgraced his admin
istration, nor were any great criminals allowed to es
cape through his negligence. This was due, it was
then said, to the efficiency of his deputies, wh*o, in
the various criminal departments of the Superior
Court, prosecuted his cases for him.
Upon the expiration of his term of office, however,
he turned up as an embezzler of the funds of an es
tate which had been entrusted to his care. As guar
dian of an insane man he had taken advantage of his
position to spend about $3000 belonging to his ward
in the saloons and other resorts of the tenderloin
district. He ran away to escape prosecution, but
could not stay, and finally returned to stand trial,
hoping that his friends would come to his rescue.
But, as in most such cases, his friends were fair
weather friends, and those who did succor him suc
ceeded only in paying a lawyer for trying his case.
The moral to be derived from Page's career, which
is thus terminated at the early age of 45, is neither
uncertain nor obscure. The flatteries ana 1 allure
ments of politics turned his brain completely. He
became intoxicated with success and he was unable
to withstand the incident prosperity. Perhaps he had
not been sufficiently seasoned for the ordeal, and yet
it would seem that at 35â Page's age when he became
District Attorneyâ a man who has had the advantage
of a legal education and some intercourse with the
world should have acquired sufficient sense to know j
that life in the tenderloin is not what it seems.
Some people will say, of course, that Page was a
fool; others will pity him and point the moral which
adorns his career; but the more wholesome judg
ment will be that he fell victim to a social system
which exacts from those who rise suddenly to the
surface in it the possession of sound qualities of mind
and heart. Page was weak and fell. Another man
with his opportunities might have achieved fame and
fortune.
THE CHEAP JELLY TRADE.
AN elaborate article in a recent number of the
New York Commercial gives an interest
ing account of the manufacture of cheap jellies
and preserves in the United States, from which it ap
pears that these articles arc made chiefly from dried
cores and skins of apples, known to the trade as
"waste." It is stated that about 130 factories are en
gaged in the business, with an annual capacity of
200.000,000 pounds output, and it is added, "This is
said to be a conservative estimate of the capacity, and
refers to cheap jellies alone."
Following the summary of the extent and magni
tude of the industry the article goes on to say: "There
is a mistaken impression abroad, due to the un
founded and ill-considered attacks of sensational
newspapers and boards of health, that these cheap
jellies are unwholesome and injurious." To refute
these alleged misrepresentations a statement is given
of the ingredients of the cheap jellies. These, it is
said, consist of the juices pressed from the apple
waste, glucose and "other pure substances according
to the nature of the product, viz., for raspberry jam,
dried raspberries; for blackberry jam, dried black
berries, etc."
"Glucose," continues this advocate of the cheap
jelly, "is the word that sticks in the craw of many |
people." He therefore quotes many authorities to
prove that glucose is not only a pure food, but one
of the best attainable. One of these authorities is
quoted as saying: "Glucose is pre-eminently a fat
forming, heat-producing food. Under a diet of glu
cose a man can perform more muscular work than
under any other single article of food. Glucose not |
only is not injurious, but it is an essential article of I
food, without which in some form man cannot enjoy
life."
Without questioning any of the statements of fact
in the article, there still remains a sufficient reason
why boards of health and newspapers that 'are not
sensational should continue their opposition to the
cheap jelly trade so long as it is conducted as at
present. The wrong lies in the fact that the busi
ness is carried on under something very much like
false pretenses. A mixture of apple waste, glucose
and dried raspberries is not raspberry jelly, and yet
it is under that title it is generally presented to the
public and sold to consumers. This is a manifest in
jury to the manufacturer of genuine raspberry jelly,
as well as a deception practiced on the buyer.
If glucose be really all that is claimed for it. if it
be true that a man can perform more muscular work
upon it than upon any other single article of food,
and if no man without it in some form can enjoy life,
then it should be sold under its own name so that
consumers may be sure that they are getting that
desirable substance. If good wine needs no bush,
why should good glucose need to masquerade?
It is certainly unfair to expect the manufacturers
of genuine fruit jellies and preserves to compete
against an output of the product of apple waste and
glucose which a conservative estimate places at about
200.000,000 pounds a year. Nor will the general pub
lic be easily persuaded that all the cheap jellies are
chemically pure and absolutely harmless. One kind
of deception readily leads to another, and in the
eagerness to make a cheap article there is no telling
what kind of stuff goes in with the "waste" and
blends with the mixture.
An American consulate in Spain has been attacked.
This act is on the same lofty and courageous plane
where the average Castilian seems to stand, his bosom
swelling with pride and his voice thunderous for
war.
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
Perhaps an apology is due "Pioneer,"
of whom I spoke last week. He has
written again, and in such a way as to
indicate that the sending of anony
mous letters is his worst fault. His
declaration that he will "vote himself
an old fool" is unduly harsh. On the
contrary he appears to be an old gen
tleman of kindly intent, led into meth
ods which do not meet with approval
because the same as adopted by the
meddler and the timid or malign mal
content. I can assure "Pioneer" that a
signed message from him would re
ceive consideration such as he can
never hope to get by a bombardment of
nameless effusions, however well in
tended.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Not long ago I noticed that an inte
rior paper had presented its saJutatory
under the label "Valedictory." Now
comes the new Press of Rlveria and
calls its bow "Salutary." With a feel
ing of frankness toward the craft I can
only express the hope that it may be so.
* â¢ â¢
Some papers have affirmed that the
war scare was raised as a deliberate
scheme to sell a lot of old ships to the
Government. I would not call a person
making such a statement a fool be
cause he might be only a liar, nor a
liar because he might be only a fool.
Besides I have a liking for benignity
of expression. But supposing, for the
sake of argument or anything else,
that the charge is true, every plotter
should be hanged, and the carcass of
him pelted mellow by bricks.
It had been hoped that the Craven
woman had got out of sight for keeps,
but she bobs up again, as usual the
central figure in an unsavory episode.
It will be remembered that she was re
tained as a teacher long after the fact
was known that she was utterly unfit
to have the direction of the young, or
to associate with them, and at last per
mitted to resign from a position in
which she had been a disgrace to the
schools and to the community. I hear
tily wish she had secured enough of
Fair's money to have taken a fifty
years" tour of Europe.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Collis P. Huntington has reached
nearly four score. He is a large man,
physically and financially, wonderful in
his industry, unutterably selfish, sordid
beyond expression. He says we have
Ino occasion for war with Spain. Per
haps it is presumptuous in me to take
| issue with a person who can command
a million dollars as readily as I could
I command a nickel, and who would
I cling to the nickel as I might to the
million. But I cannot shake off a be
lief that Huntington is a disgrace to
the land which produced him. To my
mind he lacks no essential of the traitor
save the courage to risk hanging. I
do not say this in anger that he has
more unearned money than any indi
vidual has a right to possess, but
because I have no respect for a man
who thinks more of a dollar than of
his country, his soul, and his God. I
object to his statement because it is
cowardly, un-American and untrue. If
we have no occasion to flght Spain then
never did nation armed in righteous
1 ness go against nation since the be
â  ginning of the world. For half a cen
i tury Spain has arrogated to herself the
'â  privilege of capturing and killing
, Americans. For this she has scarcely
j been rebuked, and a shame has been
i put upon us under which the people
! have chafed. But laying aside the
| past, even the murder of the crew of
j the Yirginlus, a recent event as his
| tory goes, the last few weeks have fur
nished ample cause. When the Maine
was sunk a whisper of fear went
', around that if another ship were sent
j to Havana it, too, would go to the bot
! torn of the harbor. That the whisper
was heeded was due to the Hunting
! ton influence which has in a measure
j corrupted the land. Instead of delay
there should have been instant action,
instead of one vessel, a fleet, and under
the protection of our own guns the in
vestigation should have been carried
! on. An hour after the verdict had been
| reached the Stars and Stripes should
; have been floating above Morro Castle
I or the process of razing Havana to the
! last foundation stone have been in pro
â  gress. The war would have been begun
and ended. We do not build a navy
that our Spanish friends may have the
pleasure of blowing it up and drinking
i wine as our dead are carried ashore
j to be placed in graves to whose poor
I shelter they are not welcome. But the
; treatment of Consul General Lee eon-
I stitutes a second ground for war. A
! nation must share the odium heaped
upon its representatives. A nation
which would calmly accept the insults
offered Lee and other Consuls, some of
whom were forced to retire secretly to
avoid being murdered, is not fit to be a
nation. It should get itself annexed to
Hawaii and beg Dole for protection. I
am glad to say that Huntington is al
most alone in his gross and humiliating
conception of the situation confronting
US'. It would be a sorry land that
brought forth many of his kind, a land
devoid of patriotism, fit only for sub
jugation, deserving the sneers of the
world, its flag an emblem of dishonor.
George Hayford. declaring himself to
be an attorney, writes five pages of bad
English to show a vague insinuation
that he is a scoundrel, an insinuation
whereat he expresses a sense of dis
pleasure, ought to have been specific
and direct. For some reason, which
does not appear with clarity, he ap
plies to The Call all the epithets in his
vocabulary. Hayford asserts with evi
dent warmth that he does not practice
in the Police Courts. Nobody, so far
as I know, ever said he did. His forte
seems to be that of getting into the
Police Court in the capacity of defend
ant. He has been arrested for petty
larceny, for swindling a widow, and he
deserves arrest for disturbing the peace
by projecting into it such a nerve as
has never before been on exhibition.
I do not understand how anybody but
a policeman could take Hayford ser
iously. However, his missive has been
placed on file. It may come in handy
when Hayford shall rise to the dignity
of grand larceny and get sent to San
Quentln.

No man of intelligence underrates the
horrors of war. It is true that many
of us have not had the dread experi
ence of viewing- them. We cannot
understand them as the old soldier who
has seen his comrades fall and has
stood picket where the dead lay un
buried and the dying moaned life's last
agony away. The suffering, the sus
pense, the heart breakâ these we have
learned from family tradition, the an
nals of battle, the tales of a Bierce, the
lips of the reminiscent veteran. The
glory of being shot to shreds or
trampled under the hoofs of cavalry is
largely theoretical. No man of normal
mind takes up arms for the Joy of
undergoing it. But there are such
things as national pride and honor.
They merge into each other until no
dividing line may be drawn. This na
tional pride and honor have been as
sailed, and war, whatever its horrors,
must come. It is almost here. Either
Spain must leave Cuba, not for the
sake of that troubled island, but in
token of submission to the United
States, or she must be driven out. Any
compromise, if miracle rendered it pos
sible, would be rejected by the Ameri
can spirit, which still abides despite
the Huntingtons, the Hannas and the
Elkins stripe, who would favor run
ning up a white flag and saying,
"Please don't," if a Spanish fleet were
to batter the sky line of New York into
the semblance of a ruined brick kiln.
We talk about this as the land of the
free and the home of the brave. I hope
it is. But if the poltroons who are try
ing to tie the hands of McKinley, the
lardaceous lords of empty sound roar
ing themselves knaves, succeed in
bringing about a triumph for Spain as
they design, the free have not much to
say about it and the brave are in the
minority. The banner of Spain Is the
black banner of piracy. Some of us,
failing to kow-tow to it, are called jin
goes.

If I had my way Deputy Constable
Adams of Fresno would spend
a long term in prison. Adams shot
a man whose offense had been the
stealing of a ride and an evident desire
;o escape arrest by running away. Had
the man resisted threateningly the
case would have been far different, but
he simply sought to leave the vicinity
of the Constable and got a possibly
atal bullet in the back for his pains.
f the act was not murder, or an at
:empt at it, a Constable in Fresno
has privileges. To steal a ride is not a
serious crime. It is about the only
thing a person can steal without caus
ing loss to some one else. The ride is
no more missed than is the air one
breathes in passing across a farmer's
pasture. It appears that the victim in
this instance was a hard-working man
in quest of employment. To be unem- j
ployed is not necessarily a felony. To j
endeavor to find employment is rather
commendable than otherwise. There
are vicious tramps, and tramps of as
good moral character as more fortu-
Date people whom circumstances have
not forced to take to the road. An un- i
armed tramp of decent antecedents is [
far less a menace to the public welfare
than the armed Constable, who, pining
for a fee, pursues and kills him. As
the wounded man lay supposedly dying
the conductor of the train swore out a ,
warrant charging him with vagrancy.
I have not noticed that any lover of
justice has sworn out a warrant charg- '
ing Adams with assault to murder.
The hope that I would receive no

poetry is not utterly bad I turn it over i
to somebody who knows something
about it. It is worthy of note, however,
that most of it stops right here. I must

daisy, and had he remembered it a lit
tie better would have passed out of my

There are several things about the
evening papers which are almost puz
â ling. For instance, nobody seems to i
know why they issue a first edition and
mark it "fourth." It is true that this
operation consistently followed causes
the third and last edition to have the !
appearance of being the sixth, but it
isn't the sixth any more than a cat is !
a cow. And then the habit of printing :
"extra" In large type is wickedly mis- |
leading to the uninitiated. An evening i
daily, printed within the usual h-;,-urs, is
not an extra. It may, by some strange
circumstance, be extra bad, though
such a possibility is hard to imagine,
and in such cases the advantage of
keeping the brand off ought to be
obvious. Only at long intervals do the
evening papers print a genuine "extra/ j
and nine times out of ten then their '
action in so- doing is a distinct imposi- j
tion on the public. I am not complain-
Ing as a newspaper man; but, as one of
the public, I lament.

With all respect for the powers that
be, I cannot see why the fact that
Harry Thomas of Oakland borrowed or j
attempted to borrow $100 is any excuse â 
for the fuss being made about it. It |
happens that Thomas is the son of the \
Mayor, but this circumstance ought \
not to be a handicap to any man in i
need of a sum of money. More than I
one man has had occasion to borrow
' such an amount, has done so, and later
i has wiped the indebtedness out, and
at no stage of the transaction had a
' lot of aspersions cast upon him. It is
! true that Thomas intimated in his re
quest for the money that he would be
i glad to repay the favor, and, had he
I felt in any other mood, he would sim

; cheek. To negotiate a loan when there
; is ample security to offer does not in
volve a favor unless it be to the man
who has cash to lend. But when the
\ matter is one of honor solely, when the
I debt is secured only by a piece of
paper, the favor is considerable, and it
would be a peculiar sort of person who
would fail to appreciate it or neglect
to express a readiness to reciprocate. If
the most serious charge against the
Mayor of Oakland is that his son bor
rowed $100 and manifested a decent re
gard for the accommodation, the effort
to get him on the black list will be a
failure. _____________

which was his clean-up for the entire
week. He was sitting on the side of his
bunk execrating the run of luck that had
left him busted, and while he was speak
ing started to pull off his long rubber
boots. When he pulled off the first one
he turned it upside down and a large
pile of dust was shaken out on the floor.
The same thing happened with the sec

to $13,941. The dust had fallen over the

dust about four inches beneath the sur

money thus realized purchased a plow
and a pair of mules and started to plow
up the entire field. A couple of native

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 17, 1898.
EASTERN DOGS
RAN POORLY
Long Courses Were the
Rule at Union Cours
ing Park.
Santa Alicia, a Warm Favor
ite, Easily Disposed Of
by Jester.
The Call, as Usual, Tipped Twenty
two Out of Twenty-four
Courses.
The Call was slightly off in Its predic
tions for last Sunday, but it made up for
lost ground yesterday by calling twenty
two out of twenty-four courses, and the
"tips" were strongly played by a number
of the readers of The Call. Among the
selections were quite a few long shots, on
which the talent, who failed to play The
Call's favorites, went gloriously wrong.
The two courses which gave a black eye
to the string of Call victories were the
defeat of Terrona by Rusty Gold in a
long course and Santa Monica by Jester
In a tolerably short run. Santa Alicia was
not running in anything like good form
yesterday.
The hares were an especially fine lot,
| and with the exception of one or two
"skates," they carried their pursuers the
entire length of the field, several of them
making their escape. In a course between
Terrona and Rusty Gold the latter won
|by having a good hare. Terrona led to
i his game and scored first turn and
! wrench; then Rusty Gold got in and had
it all his own way, Terrona showing
! signs of lurching.
The favorites won until the tenth
course, when the talent met with its first
upset Santa Alicia was a 2 to 1 favorite,
but Jester led her from the slips and
never allowed Santa to score in a short
race.
In the eleventh course the talent met
i with another reverse. Star Pointer, an
other 2 to 1 favorite, got bowled over by
Crosspatcb, which dog led to the hare
and allowed the Star to get in for only a
turn and kilj.
Fair Helen, a 1 to 6 shot, surprised the
backers of Douglas by scoring a "no
course," but in the run off Douglas won
handsomely in a short dash.
Sans Souci easily disposed of Pigeon
Toes, a recent importation. The Pigeon
had the best of the game near the finish.
White Chief beat Macic in a run u^
and a ciuick kill. Magic sold a slight fav
orite.
Firm Friend, a shortender, was beaten
by Theron by a small margin after a
"no course."
Commodore and Tod Sloan had a warm
argument. Tod was a 5 to 3 favorite, and
came within an ace of being beaten in
the first course, but in the run off Tod
scored a fairly easy victory.
The Eastern dog Mona, which sold on
the short end. made a "no course" with
the great Magnet, having the best of the
favorite in the work done after the run
up. It was a short course and Magnet
happened to drive his game into Mona's
territory. In the run off Magnet easily
disposed of the late arrival from the East.
Premier, a 20 to 1 shot, to the surprise
of good judges, gave False Flatterer
some trouble. Ntaring the end of the
course he took possession of his game
and was beating Flatterer badly, but the
course was not long enough for Premier
to make up for lost ground.
Carmody outscored San Pedro in the fin
ish of a long course, but he did not make
sufficient points to win a decision. Car
mody was a 6 to 1 shot.
The last race of the day set back the
knowing ones. Bonita defeated Chartist
in a good course by a small margin.
The winners of the run down of the
all-aged stake are:

SOUTHERNERS
WILL FIGHT
Their Services Have Been
Offered in the Country's
Behalf.
Proposed to Form a Local Company
and March to the Front When
Called.
There are many war-scarred veteran
Confederates in this city who are ex
ceedingly anxious to join the forces In
case of war with Spain. In fact, many
letters have been written to the Govern
ors of various Southern States asking
that they have some provision made for
them and that they be allowed to bear
arms against the unfriendly nation.
William Harnett of Georgia, who is at
present in this city, and who is also an
ex-Confederate colonel, received a letter
from Governor Atkinson of Georgia re
cently stating that in accordance with a
written request to be allowed to join the
American forces in case of war he would
be pleased to accept his services and fur
thermore thanked the colonel for his of
fer.
There are several hundred gray-haired
men who fought for what they deemed
the rights of the Southerners who are at
present contemplating forming com
panies and marching to the front, when,
as many of them state, the inevitable
clash comes. It is proposed to hold meet
ings before long and make final arrange
ments, and in all probability a conclu
sion will be quickly reached. There are
many hard lighters among them and a
splendid body of men would result from
a company or even regiment formation.
Colonel Barnett is highly elated over
the prospect of once again "smelling
smoke," and states that if the opportu
nity presents itself, which he thinks
highly probable, the fighting ability of
those of Southern blood will be clearly
shown.

ELECTION PREPARATIONS.
Contracts Awarded for the Printing
of District Maps and for Fur
nishing Booths.
At the meeting of the Election Com
mission yesterday the contract for print
ing 25,000 district maps for the general
election was awarded to H. S. Crocker &
Co., their bid being $395.
liids were opened for the erection of the
election booths, but the contract was not
awarded, as all the bids were considered
too high. At the last election it cost only
$10 95 to erect each booth. The lowest
bid this time was $12 35. that of William
G. Huphes. Action was postponed until
Monday, to allow of an investigation
being made in reference to the matter.
H. B. Joyce was awarded the contract
for furnishing the booths with tables,
chairs, lamps, etc., his bid being $4 89 for
each booth.

TROLLEYS FOR
MARKET STREET
Planning to Supplant the
Cable With Elec
tricity.
Only the Underground Trolley
System Will Be Tol-
era ted.
Huntington Promises to Take Up the
Horse Car Tracks if Allowed
Hi 3 Way.
H. E. Huntingdon and the directorate
of the Market Street Railway Company
are planning to change the cable line on
Market street into an electric system. A
hint of their intention was given to a
committee of the Merchants' Association
a few days ago, but as yet no direct ef
fort has been made to secure the neces
sary authority from the governing board
of the city to make the change.
About two years ago new rails were
laid along the Market street cable tracks
and when they were put down they were
"bonded" and laid in the same manner
that the rails for electric lines are put
down. The rails at the ends were con- I
nected with copper wires, so that they
would make a continuous circuit for an
electric current. The manner of laying
the new rails excited suspicion at the |
time that an effort would be made to dis- |
pense with the cable that for years pro
pelled the cars along the wide thorough
fare and replace it with an overhead cop
per wire for supplying electric power to
the cars. Every move of the ranway
company that had a tendency to trend
that way was closely watched by the
merchants along Market street, and so
far they have successfully kept the un
sightly trolley wire and poles from the
main business artery of the city.
About five years ago a bold attempt
was made to erect poles and siring a
trolley wire along Market street. Early
one Sunday morning a big force of men
suddenly appeared on the street. They
were strung all the way from Powell
street to the ferry depot, and they com
menced work digging holes along the
curb and setting up poles. Many property i
owners along the street who happened to ;
be downtown appealed to the police to \
strfp the work, but the police refused,
claiming that they did not have that !
power. Finally L. R. Ellert, who was at
that time Mayor, was found, and he at
once authorized the police when the
state of affairs was explained to him to
stop the work, and the workmen were
driven away.
Several holes had been dug and some [
poles were put up. The police guarded
the street against the encroachment of
the Market Street Railway Company un
til the courts could be appealed to and
an injunction against the proceedings of
the railway company was issued.
H. E. Huntingdon confessed to the
plans of his corporation at a conference I
hold with him by a committee of the ;
Merchants" Association a few days ago. !
The Merchants' representatives were dis
cussing with him the project of paving
Market street from Second to Sixth with
bitumen, and a promise was wanted from
the president of the railway company
that the Market Street Company would I
agree to pay its share of the expense.
The portion of the street it is proposed
to pave with bitumen is from the curb to j
the outer line of the cable-car tracks. The
roadbed of the cable tracks and the space
between them are to remain as at pres
ent. The reason for leaving the space '
between the tracks paved with basalt
blocks is that should It become necessary i
to put a new sewer down in the street it
can be done under the stone pavement,
and no injury will be done to the portion
paved with bitumen.
Huntington asked the committee if It
would not be better to have the horsecar
tracks on Market street taken up. so that
a clear pavement could be put down
from the curb to the present line of the
rable-car tracks. He said that could be'
done if a franchise could be secured from I
thÂ« Board of Supervisors allowing elec- I
trie cars to be run on Market street, so
that the lines now operated by horse
cars could be run over the tracks of the
cable-cars by electricity.
Hugo Keil, who was one of the com
mittee of the Merchants' Association, said
yesterday that he would have no objec
tion to allowing electric cars to operate
on Market street should the underground
electric system be used. Huntington
made a plain proposition for the assist
ance of the association in securing a
franchise to operate an electric line on
Market street. "It is not a ma' tor for our
organization to advocate," said Mr. Keil;
"but I believe we should oppose it should
an attempt be made to string an overhead
trolley wire along that thoroughfare. The
underground trolley system is being suc
cessfully used in cities in the East, and
there is no reason why it could not be
operated here if the cable is to give way
to electricity."
Spiritualists' New Hall.
The new hall recently fitted up In the
building formerly occupied by the Su
preme Court, on the corner of McAllister
and Larkln streets, for the headquarters
of the California State Spiritualist Asso

ous friends on Friday evening, April 29
On this occasion a social and dance wili
be given by the First Spiritual Ladies'
Aid Society, at which an unusual interest
ing programme will be prepared for the
evening's entertainment. Mrs. B. F
Small, an active p.nd earnest worker of
the society, and one of the board of man-*
agers, is leaving no stone unturned to
make the event one long- to he remem
bered by those who may be present, and
as the society numbers thousands of ad
herents there is but little doubt that the
new hall will be filled on this occasion.

Klondikers Returning With Their

Special Dispatch to The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, April 12 (by steam
ship Queen to Seattle, April lo). â A
â¢whisky famine and new discoveries of
gold are the latest from Dawson. A
party of about fifteen men, including
Captain P. H. Ray of Fort Yukon riot
fame, has arrived here and will pro
ceed to Seattle. They left Dawson on
March IS and saw salt water eighteen
days later. Captain Ray, C. Morgan
and John G. Smith came through from
Fort Yukon, having left there on Feb
ruary 25 and Circle City on March 2.
Captain Ray will proceed at once to
Washington, D. C, to make a formal
report to President McKinley about the
need of more troops in the lower coun
try to protect life and property along
the lines outlined in The Call's Fort
Yukon letter, recently published.
Captain Ray is over CO years old, but
Is in tip-top condition and feeling fine
after the long journey over the ice and
enow. Ho left in charge at Fort Yukon
Lieutenant Richardson, who, single
handed, held the army of unprovisioned
at bay, preventing tl m from seizing
a storehoufe of supplies.
Captain Ray will lay before the Pres
ident the present and probable condi
tions on the lower river next summer.
He thinks that there is much danger
of lawlessness and a possibility the
boats going down the river with their
burdens of gold may be held up and
the treasure stolen. The captain also
has some fear that the last boats up
the river next August or Septc lber
may be held up and their cargoes of
provisions and other supplies taken by
the same kind of men who made seri
ous trouble last winter at Fort Yukon.
He thinks the towns and rivers ought
to be patrolled in the same manner and
number that the Canadian police are
bivouacked along the river from the
Chilkoot summit to Dawson and as at
Dawson.
Among others in the party are Cap
tain Hammond of Seattle, Mr. Mcln
tosh of Ontario, Mr. Pelkey of Mon
treal. Mr. McCumbar and Mr. Granger
of San Francisco, "Arizona Charley."
â whose proper name is Charles Mead
ows, of Arizona, and who is said to
be one of the richest claim-holders in
the Klondike region, and Virgil Moore
of Santa Rosa, Cal. P. H. Light of Chi
cago is here. He has recently been into
Dawpon and staked some good claims.
He will proceed to Chicago and Wash
ington. I), c. C Morgan is from Butte
County, Cal., and, though a young
man. is one of the b^st-known miners
in the Yukon Valley. He has been
in there three years and has staked
gome of the best ground in the country.
"Halamute Creek," he said, "is a new
one and one of the richest. It is a
tributary of the Koyukuk and has been
very little prospected by white men. We
paw some Indians, who had about $700
worth of coarse gold, and they said
they got it on the Malamute. They had
just come out. Ido not know just
how long it took them to get it out,
but it was not long. On Brick Creek
I know that as high as $SOO to the pan
has been taken out in places. Ameri
can Creek is also good, and there are
acres of ground in the Koyukuk and
Brick Creek sections, that will go from
75 cents to $2 SO to the pan. When grub
and labor become cheaper in there,
and the day is coming, there are im
mense areas of comparatively low
grade ground that can be worked with
hydraulics and made to pay big. The

RICHEST CLAIMS ARE ON
THE AMERICAN SIDE.
Captain Ray Says the Mining Dis
tricts of Alaska Are
the Bsst.
SEATTLE, April 16.â Captain Phil
Ray, U. S. A., who has represented the
Government in the Yukon River coun
try for the past year, returned early
this morning on the steamship Queen.
Later he went to Portland by train and
will go thence direct to Washington.
In an interview he said:
"All of the gold that came out last
year was credited to the Klondike, but
pome of it came from the American
side. Our output will certainly be a
million dollars this year. The claims
abandoned when the Klondike excite
ment broke out have been relocated
and will be thoroughly worked. I
think we have better and more exten
sive mining sections in Alaska than
in the Northwest Territory. Outside
of El Dorado, Bonanza, Hunker and
Dominion creeks it is not known that
there are any which are paying as well
as those in the Birch Creek district.
"The food scare at Dawson was the
indirect means of developing much
American territory in Alaska during
the past winter. I met several hun
dred prospectors between Circle City
and Dawson, going down to work on
American creeks along the Yukon. At
the mouth of Seventy Mile and at the
mouth of Mission Creek are settle
ments which promise to grow into cities
soon. The town at the first named
place is called Star City, and the other
Eagle City. When I came by the min
ers at Seventy Mile showed me pans
of dirt that ran from 15 to 30 cents. â¢
"Men are rushing to Charlie River
from both Circle City and Dawson."
SALINAS MAYORALTY
CONTEST DECIDED.
Francee Wins His Suit to Throw Out
the Votes of the First and
Third Wards.
SALINAS, April 16.-The decision In the
Mayoralty contest to unseat W. J. Hill
and seat C. Francee was rendered this
afternoon, Judge Doollng giving judg
ment for contestant. The principal
ground of contest was that the First and
Third ward polling places had closed at
5 o'clock and the Second Ward at sun
down. In his decision the Judge says:
â¢I am of the opinion that section 1166
of the Penal Code was not intended to
apply to municipal elections held under
charters which themselves contain pro
visions In reference to the time of open-
Ing and closing polls."
He gives the election to Francee by a
majority of six votes, the First and Third
wards being thrown out. An appeal to
the Supreme Court will at once be taken
by Mr. Hill.

COSTA RICA AND
NICARAGUA ON THE
BRINK OF WAR
Diet of the Greater Republic De=
cides Upon the Sending of a
Bellicose Ultimatum.
Copyrighted, IS9S. by James Gordon Bennett.
PANAMA, April 16.â Cable advices just received from the Herald's
correspondent in Managua, Nicaragua, state that during the last few
days the Diet of the Greater Republic has been occupied with the
Costa Rica-Nicaraguan question. Communications between the Diet
and the Costa Rican Government have resulted in a few modifications
on both sides of demands for indemnity and reparation for alleged
wrongs perpetrated by one against the other. After a long delibera
tion to-day the Diet decided to send to Costa Rica a memorandum,
practically an ultimatum, couched in terms which it is believed will be
accepted by Costa Rica. This memorandum will say that if the
terms are not accepted war will be declared within forty-eight hours.
Mail advices from the Herald's correspondent at Managua, dated a
few days ago, stated that he had just learned that the Court of Ar
bitration which met aboard the United States naval vessel Alert at
Punta Arenas, signed an agreement to temporarily suspend war prep
arations in Nicaragua and Costa Rica and withdraw their forces from
the frontier until a final decision of the arbitrators, who will meet in
Guatemala City, is reached.
The arbitrators will consider only the claims of Nicaragua against
Costa Rica for aiding Nicaraguan rebels and Costa Rica's claim for the
arrest and imprisonment of Consul Berche in Managua, in September
last.

Veterans Grieve Over the
Death of Wells A.
Ashman.
Member of the Grand Army
Fights His Last Battle
on Earth.
His Demise Necessitates a Pause in
the Preparations for the En

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEVADA CITY, April 16.âT0-mor
row the Union Veterans at Chatta
nooga Post must pause in their prepa
rations for entertaining the Grand
Army of the Republic of California and
Nevada, which is to assemble here in
annual encampment next week, and
with bowed heads and saddened hearts
follow to their last resting-place in
Pine Grove Cemetery the mortal re
mains of one of their comrades.
Wells Adolphus Ashman, who served
as a private in Company I, Seventh
Regiment, California Infantry, in 1864,
1865 and 1866, died to-day at the
County Hospital of general debility.
He was a pioneer miner, quitting that
occupation to respond to his country's
call. When peace came he again took
up pick and pan and continued to hunt
for gold until recently. He died poor,
his only known living relative being a
rich brother in New York State, who
came out last summer and tried in
vain to get him to quit his old stamp
ing ground and spend his declining
years ainjd plenty and comfort on the
Eastern seaboard.
The stars and stripes hang at half
mast to-night from many fiagstaffs
around the city in memory of the griz
i zled old veteran who had said ever
! since his health began to fail that he
' would rather die in a poorhouse in Ca!
ifornia than live in a palace beyond
the Rockies.
The advance guard of the hosts to
arrive on Monday afternoon are com
ing on every train. Mrs. Jennie Chap

I chaplain of the Woman's Relief Corps,
lis here. She left a beautiful home at
Madison, Wisconsin, just before the
fall of Vicksburg, and, going to the
front, entered the Union Hospital at
Memphis as a volunteer nurse. She
was there nearly a year and at each
gathering of the Grand Army she meets
many old soldiers who remember with
gratitude her kindly ministrations
i when they were under her care in the
; hospital. Major William Hargrave of
San Diego, representing Helntzleman
Post, is another early arrival. He re
ports that almost every town in the
northern part of the State will be rep
resented next week, as the idea prevails
; that this encampment will be one of
i the best yet held in the West.
HUSHING UP THE
ZOLA SENSATION.
The French Government Will Now
Try the Novelist in Versailles
on One Issue.
Copyrighted, 1898. by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, April 16.â The name of Zola has
again become an actuality from the open
ing of his trial by the Assize Court, but
as already predicted the Government has
taken precautions to prevent the new
trial from being marked. by the excite
ment of the previous trial. The date
has been postponed to May 23, when the
elections will be over and the case will
not be tried in Paris, but at v ersailles,
where it is hoped to confine the trial to
three or four days by strictly limiting
the issue to one point, viz., Zola's defa
mation of the court-martial by accusing
its members of having acquitted Major
Esterhazy by order. All this has been
discussed in the press, but the great con
troversy on the subject is 'extinct. The
people are preoccupied with other things,
and it will require some new develop
ment to kindle them again. There are
some developments which a few weeks
ago provoked violent comments and
which papers to-day scarcely mentioned.
The Italian Government, in conse
quence of a statement made by a witness
not examined in the Zola trial, has just
decided to recall Colonel Panlzzardi. its
military attache, who is alleged to have
taken an active part in the Dreyfus af
fair. According to a statement wnich is
not denied Colonel Panizzardi had per
sonal relations, not explained, with Ma
jor Esterhazy. In leaving Paris he fol
lows the example of Colonel Schwartz
koppen, German military attache, who
was recalled to Berlin at a moment when
his name was brought up in connection
with the Esterhazy trial.

WITH CRUELTY
Wife of the Capitalist
Brings a Suit for
Divorce.
Declares That She Fears to
Longer Remain Under
His Roof.
Asks for Half of the Community
Property, Which Is Valued at
Over 5200.000.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, April 16.â Mrs. Enrly C.
Yoell to-day began suit against J. Alex
ander Yoell, the capitalist, for a divorce
on the ground of extreme and continued
cruelty. The Yoells are prominent soci
ety people, and the suit will create some
commotion among the upper ten. About
a year ago similar suit for divorce was
commenced, but the action was subse
quently dismissed at the request of the
plaintiff. Following close upon this Mrs.
Yoeil went through insolvency and re
ceived her discharge in the insolvency
proceedings about a month ago. Her lia
bilities amounted to over $20,000, and two
tÂ».irds of this sum was for indorsements
on notes of her son, Attorney John H.
Yoell of this city. There were no assets,
and great opposition arose from credit
ors to her taking advantage of the in
solvency ac owing to the great wealth
of her husband.
In the divorce complaint filed to-day
Mrs. Yoell charges her husband with ex
treme crueiiy. They were married on
August 3, 1862, and she alleges that two
years later her husband commenced his
unkind, harsh and tyrannical conduct
toward her. which has continued with
slight intermissions until the present
time. She says he possessed such a vio
lent passion and ungovernable temper
that she and the children were compelled
to withdraw from the pleasures of social
intercourse and not invite any one to the
house for fear that he would get Into one
of his "ugly fits" and abuse the visitors.
Furthermore, she says life has become
unbearable with him and that she is
afraid to live with him. On several occa
sions, she alleges, he called her a "black
hearted wretch" and a "she-devil."
The complaint alleges that tne estate is
all community property and is worth over
$200,000. Mrs. Yoell wants one-half of this
and 1500 a month alimony. There are
I seven children.
Yoell, until a few years ago, was a
prominent lawyer of this city. He is
worth fully a half-million dollars, and
I has large property interests in San Fran
cisco. ________^_____

VALLEY COURTS
Close of the Tennis Tour
nament at Pretty
Nordhoff.
Men From the South Make a
Better Showing on the
Last Day.
Succeed in Winning Three Matches
Because of Robert Whitney's
Lack of Form.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VENTURA, April 16.â This was the
second and last day of the great tennis
tournament between the champions of
north and south in Ojai Valley. The
crowd was vastly increased over that
of yesterday and the grand stand was
crowded all day, trains bringing num
bers of people from Los Angeles and
Santa Barbara. The weather was
slightly warmer than yesterday, but it
was delightful for tennis, and the boys
all played at their best. The play of
the day before was sufficient to show
that Southern Californians were out
classed in almost every instance, but
to-day they managed to win three
matches out of five, giving them a to
tal of four matches for the tournament.
Robert Whitney was the unfortunate
from the north who enabled the south
ern members to score in each instance.
He was not up to form and it was this
which accounted for his defeat. His
playing was ' quite amusing to those
who have watched him at his best.
The first match of the day was played
|at 9:30 between Sumner Hardy and
Thatcher. This was a close match and
Hardy had the hardest work of the
tournament cut out for him. The match
I was characterized by two deuce sets
I and the play was most exciting. In
the first set the play stood at 5â5,5 â 5,
Hardy finally winning in 7â5, and
I the next set resulted in the same score.
I The ladies in the grand stand applaud
' ed Thatcher to the echo on every bril
i liant play.
In the next match Samuel Hardy
| beat Rowan in two straights, 6â3, 6â3.
! Rowan played much better than yes-
I terday, but he could not down the man
i from the North.
George Whitney and Bumiller next
! crossed racquets with disastrous re
' suits to the latter. The score was
I 4â6, 6âl, 6â3. Bumiller played his
best in the first set and won it, but
' when Whitney "put a little steam on"
he soon pulled ahead.
In the next match between Oliver
! Picher and Robert Whitney the
; Southern people had a chance to shout.
Whitney played wild, while Picher was
as steady as a clock, winning by a
score of 6â2, 6â2.
In the afternoon the first match was
between Picher and Sam Hardy and
was the fastest and most brilliant of
all matches of the tournament. The
! spectators went wild with excitement.
Picher forged ahead at the start, but
Hardy's smashes proved too much for
him and he went down before a score
of 7â5, 6â3. Both men were badly
i winded at the close of the match.
Bumiller and Robert Whitney played
a fast match, resulting in a score of
6â3, 6â4 in favor of the little fellow
from Los Angeles.
Rowan vs. Sumner Hardy was the
next match, which was won by the lat
ter by a score of 6â3,6 â 3, 6â2.6 â 2.
Thatcher defaulted in his match with
George Whitney and it was accorded
to the latter.
The match which called out the most
enthusiasm was the doubles between
Hardy brothers and Thatcher and Ro
wan. The play was fast and brilliant,
but the northerners were easy win
ners by a score of 6âl,6 â 1, 6 â i.
Robert W 7 hitney defaulted in the dou
ble of Whitney brothers vs. Picher and
Bumiller and the match was awarded
to the south, giving them a record of
four games during the tournament
against sixteen for the northern boys.
The tournament was a success in
every way, including the financial end
of it. Great credit is due W. L.
Thatcher, who labored ir^defatigably
from the inception to the end of the
event. The affair wound up with a
dance to-night at Casa de Pieclra, the
famous boys' school conducted by Mr.
Thatcher in the Ojai.
STURDY FIGHTERS
ARhIVE AT KEY WEST
Two Companies of Colored Troops of
the Twenty - Fifth Regiment
Ready for the Invasion.
KEY WEST, Fla., April 16.â The col
ored soldiers. Companies A and G,
Twenty-fifth Infantry, U. S. A., arrived
here on the steamer Key West at 10:30
to-night. They will remain on board
to-night, as no provision has been made
to accommodate them at the barracks
here. They may be given tents to-mor
row on the parade ground.
In spite of the local papers predicting
that trouble would follow the arrival of
colored troops here, leading to a de
monstration against them at the pier,
there was no excitement of any kind
when the steamer came in, and neither
cheers nor hisses greeted the soldiers.
They have been stationed in Montana
and other Eastern States, where they
were famous for discipline, and look
like good fighters.
Prevents Shipments of Cattle.
CARSON, April 16.â Governor Sadler
says no California cattle have yet been
shipped through Nevada. California pro
poses shipping stock to Southern Oregon,
which necessitate a transfer at Reno,
New, from the Southern Pacific to the
N. C. and O. Railroad. The Governor will
prevent this until a quarantine station is
established. For stock passing East the
quarantine station is at Wadsworth.

Outside of Great Britain There Is a
Most Bitter Feeling Against the
"Aggressive Yankees."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 16.â After a momen
tary fit of depression there has been a
sudden recrudescence of optimism in
banking circles, notably among the |
banks closely allied with the United
States. Four-fifths of the people, how
ever, expect war and think it will be an
improvement on the present state of
uncertainty. They do not believe the
Sagasta Ministry, even if it is ready to
bow to all the American demands, is
strong enough to contend with the ris
ing storm of Spanish pride or the half
veiled menaces of the army and the
Carlist pretender. So a conflict is ex- j
pected to be reached through Spain re
senting the action of America and by
Congress declaring that a state of war
exists, as in the case of Mexico.
The hide-bound, anti-freedom doc
trinaries, who are pretending to cen
sure Congress and President McKin
ley, are received with open expressions
of vexation and even disgust. The
opinion of the great majority of Eng
lishmen is that the United States is
indisputably right and that she is
only pursuing a course identical with
Great Britain's historical policy in put
ting an end to the appalling misgov
ernment of Spain, which is wholly in
the wrong, and they point out that
England, in a similar position, would
have been as equally inflamed by hu
man emotions as America is at pres
ent.
This feeling was exemplified at the
Liberal banquet at Plymouth last even
ing, when William Alexander McAr
thur, M. P., a former lord of the treaF
u*y, was heartily cheered when he
said: "I do not think England has
any right to throw stones at Congress.
Englishmen should only applaul the
ruble indignation of America at the
horrors daily presented during the las-t
two years."
The Cabinet is expected to meet early
next week and deal with the question
of neutral vessels in tho event of war.
It is believed some understanding >vill
! be awarded between the great powers,
and the United States is prepared to
acquiesce to certain conditions whic'V.
will not impose heavy burdens upon
neutral governments.
Outside of Great Britain the feeling
toward the United States is distinctly
hostile. The inspired Government or
gans of the continent express indigna
tion at the way the United States has
"ignored the concerted powers," and
speak of the "swaggering American
self-conceit." The inherent dislike of
the continental monarchies for the
great republic is due to its very great
prosperity, which is inimical to mon
archical principle, and this dislike is
cropping out in all directions, proba
bly aided by the thirst for a chance of
colonizing, or absorbing Spanish Amer
ica, from which they are at present de
barred by the long arm of the repub
lic. The fact seems to be that the
continental observers foresee the in
evitable expansion of Anglo-Saxonism.
British naval experts discredit the
report that the United States will frit
ter away her forces by a simultaneous
attack u">on the different Spanish col
onies. They point out that Spain has
shown her appreciation of the most im
portant element of naval strategy,
namely, that sea power can only be
upheld by a >mbined fleet. By her
concentrating a formidable force at the
Cape Verde Islands the naval men an
ticipate that a big engagement be
tween the combined fleets will be
fought in the neighborhood of Porto
Rico.
There is Intense excitement among
the members of the American colony
here. Their thirst for information Is so
great that a private news service has
been arranged. American ladies are
discussing the question of organizing
to assist the wounded immediately
after war is declared. It is understood
that the interesting questions will come
up in the House of Commons Monday
relative to neutral ships in the event
of war.

THE PROBLEM SOLVED.
THE NEW MEDICAL DISCOVERY
TESTED.
Results of the Test in Various Forms oÂ».i
Dyspepsia. 1
Chronic indigestion or i /spepsia,
while a very common trouble, has for
some time been looked upon by ablu
physicians as a serious thin"- and that
no time sho-ld be lost in treating lc
properly at the start, because recent
researches have .own that the most
serious, fatal and incurable diseased
have their origin in simple dyspepsia
or indigestion.
Diabetes is simply one form of indi-
gestion, the sugar and starchy food not
being assimilated by the digestive or-
gans. In Bright's disease the albumen
is not prop iy assimilated.
While consumption and dyspepsia
are twin diseases, and it is beyontf
question that dyspepsia makes a fer-
tile soil for the seeds of consumption.
But the trouble has bee., to find a
reirn^y that could be depended upon
to cure dyspepsia, as it is notoriously
obstinate and difficult to cure.
This ha? been the question which haa
puzzled physicians and dyspeptics
alike, until the question was solved
three years ago by the appearance of
a new dyspepsia cure in the medical
world known as Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets, which it was claimed was i\
certain, reliable cure for every form
of stomach .rouble.
Physicians, however, woul not ac-
cept .such statements without first giv-
ing the new remedy many tests and
carefully observing results.
For three years the remedy has been
thoroughly tested in every section ot
the country and with surprising and
satisfactory results.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can ba
honestly claimed to be a specific, a
radical lastin- cure for indigestion in
the various formr of acid dyspepsia or
sour stomach, gas or wind on stomach, -
too much bile, undue fullness or pres- f
sure after eating and similar symptoms
resulting fron. disordered digestion.
Stuafs Dyspepsia Tablets were not
placed before the public until this three
years' trial left no doubt as to their
value and they have recently been
placed in the trade and can be found
on sale at all druggists at the nominal
price of 50 cents per package.
No extravagant claims are made for
the remedy. It will not cure rheuma-
tism, pneumonia, typhoid fever nor
anything but just what it is claimed to
cure and that is every form of stomacl*
trouble.
No dieting is necessary, good whole-
some food and plenty of it and you
may rest assured that Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets will digest it.
Druggists claim for it that it is a
pleasure to recor^-iend it t' dyspeptics,
because it o iv s uch universal satis-
faction.

PROFESSIONALS AT BAT.
A Lopsided Contest at Central Park
League Games In Interior
Cities.
Over in the northeast section of the
grand stand at Recreation Park yester
day half a hundred young demons with
heavily armored lungs and magazines
filled with ammunition touched off a
large assortment of unintelligible yells
and evidently intended to convey the im
pression that they were to "jolly"' along
nine young men in crimson sweaters out
In the field and to strike terror o nine
other young men in blu# and gold who
â¢were opposing them in the great national
game.
Down in the southwest corner of the
Ftand was another band of insurgents
Fimilarly armed and equipned, who were
performing like service for the blue and
gold. That is. they were for a timeâ say
until the close of the second skirmish
but after that their ammunition gave
out, or their lungs were pierced, or they
pot cold feet, or something; anyhow they
Seemed to lose interest in the game and
wre only heard from once in a while
â when they fired a desultory volley more
by way of defiance at the sympathetic
expressions that were sent to them from
the They didn't want any sym
pathy of that sort. What they longed for
â wns the shades of night and solitude.
To add to the discord -were some in
flammatory' decisions by Weyler Gagus,
after being threatened witht execu
tion he. too, subsided, and no casualties
Occurred.
Aside from the din and the fireworks
there was much in the contest to interest
the most bloodthirsty crank. The Stan
fords went on the diamond determined
to wipe out their defeat of the week be
fore, and they did. Although they played
the same team they had in the field the
preceding Saturday, one could hardly
realize it. for the improvement the men
Fhowed was astonishing. Perhaps their
defeat did them good, at any rate they
discarded the idiotic idea that they could
bunt and beat the ball tc first; instead,
they swatted it with all the vim and vigor
of heavyweight professionals. Their
fieldfngr and base running was fully in
keeping with their batting-, and altogether
they conducted themselves like real ball
players.
Their cannonading of TTaarsburg, who a
â¢wt-ek before they could hardly touch, was
so effective that in the sixth he retired
from the game in favor of Sims. But
thÂ« Improvement was not noticeable.
Berkeley, on the other hand, let down
woefully in the speed it showed at the
opening game, nine errors being ample
testimony as to the raggredness of its
work. Then, too. five scattering hits were
all Beckett could be found for. But while
the score was topheavy, and for seven
Innings it looked as though Berkeley
â would get nothing but goslings in the
Bhell, it was a pretty contest to watch.
Thf-re was some brilliant fielding on both
Eides, and many a professional game has
be< n played here that would bear no com
parison with that of the collegians.
Stanford scored three runs in the sec
ond on a combination of hits and errors,
and added another in the fourth. Three
more fell to them in the fifth and one
each in the sixth and seventh. Then at
final turn at bat they took another
1 m h of three, making a total of twelve.
Berkeley got their brace in the eighth
by a fluke. With one out Hoag rapped
out a double. Cheesbrough hit the ball
to the pitcher and Hoag beat the throw
to second. Bride got soaked in the slats
filing the bases. Sims dropped the ball
a: The pitcher's feet and Hoag was
caught at the plate, 'men Collins plunked
out a nice single to center, scoring Chees
brough and Bride. But Sims went to
fleep a short distance from second, and
when he awoke Gagus informed him that
H>m<:-thlng had happened during the in
terval.
Both teams having won a game, the
final contest next Saturday will be a

TRAVERSER
ALL THE WAY
Took the Palace Hotel
Handicap From a
Moderate Field.
Rainier at Odds of 2O to 1 Cap
tured the Candelaria
Stake.
Don Clarenelo Beaten a Nose by Earl
Coehranâ Four of the Favorites
Turned Down,
"Pa" Bradley's crack chestnut 3-year
old Traverser "has done gone and did It
again." ns a colored stable hand ex
pressed it, at the conclusion of the mila
and a furlone run for the $2000 Palace
Hotel handicap. He was "Hawkins' "
horse sure yesterday, and coupled with
Candelaria the Burns & Waterhouse entry
carried most of the dollars bet by the
Immense Â«rowd present. And the perfect
weather and lengthy programme drew a
very large attendance, almost equal to
that of the Burns handicap day. While
but three of the seven favorites annexed
purses, the finishes were unusually close,
and It looked as if everybody got a run
for his coin.
After three cheaper events had been
reeled off, the stake race was called, and
the crowd unpacked their betting valises.
Candelaria had made such a fine showing
In the Burns handicap that with 100
pounds and Dick Clawson. In the saddle
all expected him to fall heir to the rich
plum. Coupled with Traverser 8 to 5 was
laid against the pair, with 4 to 1 the place
chalked behind Bradley's colt. Buckwa
has been going great guns in his morn
ing gallops, and the gelding's odds were
gradually lowered from 5 to 3^ to 1. Buck
Massie. in at 116, called for quite exten
eive backing, but bettors seemed to have
soured on Ostler Joe and Linstock. Fon
sovannah and Judge Denny were not ex
pected to prove dangerous, and they
didn't do very much.
At the post there was quite an extended
stop, and when Ferguson finally re
leased the webbing Buckwa bolted and
got all the worst of it. The 107 pounds
seemed to sit lightly on â¦lie back at
Traverser and Thorpe immediately as
sumed the front position, trailed past the
stand by Ostler Joe and Fonsovannah.
The former hung to his work to the far
turn, and then the killing clip set by the
chestnut began to tell, and he was all
out. All this time Claws.on was scramb
ling the eggs back in the bunch with
Candelaria. Rounding the buoy for home,
Traverser with all sails set showed no
signs of stopping, and though nis run
ning mate came fast when he caught the
trade winds opposite the paddock, "Pa"
Bradley's pride was first by half a
length in 1:53%. Candelaria finished two
length ahead of Fonsovannah for second
money. The others, badly beaten, strag
gled In.
The Candelaria handicap for two-year
olds over five hurdles, with but five ac
cepting the weights, looked a foregone
conclusion for the Burns & Waterhouse
duo. Humidity and Panamint. The bet
ting also indicated as much, 1 to 3 being
the post price. Rainier, with ninety-five
pounds, turned up the joker. Catching
Humidity at the paddock, Gray got the
rank outsider in winner by a length.
Humidity tired badly the last hundred
yards, lasting long enough, however, to
beat Sevens two lengths tor the place.
A heavy plunge was made on Mrs. Net
tie Harrison's filly. Mocorito, to win the
opening six furlong spin, but Johnny
Woods had a stormy passage, and Daily
Racing Form led her out half a length
at the wire. The latter was IS to 5 in the
ring around post time.
But six started in me four and a half
furlong scramble for two-year-olds, with
Bookkeeper Johnny Humphrey's Malay
ruling a strong 6 to 5 favorite. Garnet
Ferguson's Prince Royal colt Distance
led to the stretch, where the first choice
took up the running and won easily by
a length. Distance was second, the same
distance ahead of Simi.
Three outsiders in the betting finished
heads on the wire in the mile run for
selling platers. B. J. Johnson's Floronzo
was played down to 6 to 5 favoritism, but
Dorsey went with all sorts of hard luck,
and the bay colt was never dangerous.
In a furious finish Don Luis, finishing on
I the outside with Clawson up, got the de
cision over Thorpe on Charles Le Bel a
| head, with Mistleton but a short head
j farther away.
In the mile and a quarter selling run
Spencer, on Don Clarencio. ruling equal
! favorite in the betting with Sir Dilke.
i had the race won, but quit riding the last
j sixteenth, and was nosed out by Earl
! Cochran. piloted by H. Brown. Sir Dilke
! was in front for over six furlones. when
he "doprged" it badly, and Don Clarencio
took the front position, striking the
stretch with a commanding lead. Spen-
I cer's carelessness then lost the purse.
The concluding six furlong dash, also
j decided under selling conditions, resulted
I in another very close and exciting finish
at the wire. After getting away well
with the favorite, Miss Rowena, Woods
managed to get his mount cut off, and
with plenty left to finish on led the sec
ond choice, San Mateo, past the judges
a long nose in 1:15 fiat. Montallade took
show honors.
TRACK NOTES.
Barney Schreiber disposed of his colt
Marplot yesterday to Burns & Water
house under certain conditions. From
what Barney stated if Marplot fulfills ex
pectations next fall he will receive about
what he paid for him, $2200. The St. Louis
pencller also turned to the Califor
nia firm his contract with Jockey Johnny
Woods. The little fellow has not shown
the best of form lately, but under Trainer
Jimmy McCormick's tutelage will un
doubtedly come around all right.
W. B. Sink Jr. departs for the East this
evening, his horses following on Monday.
J. W. Murphy left for Memphis last
Thursday evening, leaving Buck Massle
behind to have a try for the Palace Ho
tel stake. The brown horse, in his pres
ent form, couldn't beat a good selling
plater.
Bradley's Traverser will be started
across the continent to-morrow, along
with Willie Sink's horses. His owner
will probably start him in the Brooklyn
handicap. Trainer Jimmy McCbrmick
thinks his chances would have been
much better in the Chicago Derby, and he
is undoubtedly correct in his opinion.
Thomas H. Williams Jr. gave out yes
terday that the California Jockey Club
would give no spring meeting at either
Sacramento or Los Angeles, as originally
intended. Prospects in the interior are
not the brightest, and the local turf mag
nate thinks such meetings at this time
would only result in "frosts."
Harry Griffin, Tom Wooriford and Ed
Maloney bade their friends adios and
stepped aboard the Eastern overland last
evening.
Failing to secure "Skeets" Martin,
Bookmaker Barney Schreiber has been
dickering for the services of Jockey
Spencer. Jimmy Rowe aiSo has an eye
on the promising California lad, and it
is just likely he will ride in the far East
the coming season.
Trainer Bill Murry was much cast
down over the poor showing made by
Buckwa. He said the gelding was never
better during his racing career and was
inclined to blame his defeat to the start.
There was a well developed and healthy
play on Mocorito in tae betting on the
opening sprint, and with more luck the
filly should have uad the long end of the
purse. She was pounds the best.
When Tom Boyle bid up and obtained
the mare Tholma from a selling race on
Friday he did not produce the coin, but
proferred a check instead, which he said
he would draw on any California bank
and sign the name of P. Herzog, a
wealthy Sacramentan. This was not sat
isfactory to the officials at the track
over the bay and they notified Mr. Boyle
that unless he paid in to the association
the amount of the run-up money by Sat
urday next he would have to suffer the
consequences. This means expulsion from
the turf. The mare was ordered returned
to J. Naglee Burke.
The Gold Bug muddle ha.s not yet been
straightened up. The California Jockey
Club is still awaiting advices from Santa
Ana, though Judge Murphy stated that
the owners of Tom Smith, which ran sec
ond to Gold Bug, would probably get the
purse.
Sevens, the Watercress-Folly filly, Is a
very consistent piece of racing material.
She seems to be able to shoulder weight,
and if not first is always knocking at
the door. This is more than the major
ity of the 2-year-old crop are capable of
doing.
The Klttleman Brothers were very
wrothy after the Don Clarencio-Eafl
Cochran nose finish. Spencer, who rode
the Don, had orders not to be better than
second into the stretch. It looked so soft,
the lad disregarded orders, leading his
field into the stretch and then easing up,
only to be nosed out.
Barney Schreiber had a "bug" on Rainier.
He held the youngster out in his book,
played him on the outside, and cleaned up
$2400 over his win. With this strong pull
in his favor, Barney Quit $700 loser on
the day.

NEVILLS AND
A BUNCH OF
LETTERS
Ne^v Disclosures in
the Azhdaeron Im
prisonment.
A Woman, a Too Facile
Pen and a Hold-
Up.
Sensational Evidence Expected
in the Two Fresno
Suits.
MRS. WILLIAMS A FIGURE.
Lawyers Tell a Tale That Savors
Somewhat of Scan
dal.
The true story of the imprisonment
of the Azhdaerons by Capitalist Wil
liam A. Nevills In the Palace Hotel
during the last week of March has yet
to be told. It wi be remembered that
two suits were filed in Fresno by John
E. Azhdaeron against William A. Nev
ills for f&Jse imprisonment and personal
violence inflicted upon Azhdaeron
while held in confinement in the capi
talist's rooms at the Palace.
Various explanations have been given I
for the reason of the detention of the
plaintiff in the case â some fantastic and '
colored as the rainbow, others garish
in their unrelieved vanality. As the
suit proceeds sensations are expected to
develop which will draw aside the cur
tain of mystery and unfold to the pub
lic eye the old drama with its ancient
settings and its typical situations.
The lawyers are now at work hunt
ing evidence, and due to their subtle
designs new testimony has been discov
ered which they claim will be used for
all it is worth. On Thursday two
women left this city for Fresno, and it
is one of these who will cause all the
trouble. She is a young woman with
beauty of face and figure. Her name
is Mrs. E. Williams, and if that bel
dame, rumor, and the assertions of
more trustworthy people be an ap
pro-ximation of the truth, Captain Wil- :
Ham A. Nevills was an ardent admirer
of her charms and beauty. In Fresno
they first met, and the prepossessing
qualities of the young and dashing
woman bewitched the captain. Not
very long ago Mrs. Williams came to
San Francisco, and here the interest
of the captain for her not only did not
cease, but was ever on the increase.
Whether it was the desire to tear her
sister away from the wiles- of Captain
Nevills or merely to bring her to Fres
no, where she might testify for the
Azhdaeron side in the present suits is
not known, but certain it is that Mrs.
Williams has thrown off the cloak of
Intimacy with Nevills and returned to
Fresno.
The story of the attorney of the Azh
d&etons and that which he says will be
brought out on the stand is totally d'f- >
ferent from what has been already told.
The interview between Nevills and
John Azhdaeron in the Palace, in which
after barring all exits the former as
sumed minatory attitudes full of sound
and fury, was not for the purpose of
looking over ancient contracts, but as
the lawyers will have it, to recover a i
bundle of letters written by Nevills to !
Mrs. Williams. This is the sensa- j
tional climax of the little play, and is
the killing stroke relied on.
When Nevills sent his polite invita
tion to Azhdaeron to call upon him at
the Palace he also attached a post
criptum to bring these letters, which
were, as Nevills .supposed, in the cus
tody of John Azhdaeron. How these
boomerang missives came in the pos
sion of John Azhdaeron the lawyers ex
plain with readiness.
Mrs. Williams and Nevills did not
eke out the smoothest kind of exist
ence even in the early part ot their re
lations. An estrangement sprung up,
and at this time the thought of using
what letters she had for financial re
imbursement Is said to have entered
the head of Nevills' inamorata.
An open rupture was, however,
avoided, but with instinctive alarm the
letters were consigned to the care of
Azhdaeron, then foreman of one of
Nevills' extensive vineyards. These
letters are now said to be in the keep
ing of Azhdaeron's attorney, W. D.
Grady. Some of the letters that came
trippingly off the pen of the wealthy
ranch and mine owner were delivered
to him in consummation of the first
compromise consequent upon the initial
breach of amicable relations between
the two. But Azhdaeron's attorneys
claim that many still remain, unstained
and untouched by t' withering flame.
These they '"ill try to introduce to
show just why Nevills pi ,nned the
scheme of imprisonment as a means to
recover them and that $75,000 damages
have resulted from that little episode,
of which Detective Curtin was an eye
witness.
Has Found a Home.
Florence Forbes, the pretty young girl
who attempted to commit suicide on Fri
day morning by swallowing carbolic acid
at 1013 Golden Gate avenue, owing to her
misfortunes, has found a good home,
where she will be well cared for. Officer
McMurray of the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Children, had interested
himself in the girl, and took her to her
new home yesterday afternoon. The girl
is still suffering from the effects of the
poison.

The Daily Evidence of the Wonderful Curative Powers of Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt
Is Added to by Two Very Notable Cures in San Francisco.
PlgÃ. SANDEN'S NMJEItJ|PI
IS A GRAND REMEDY FOR WEAK MEN.
DB. SANDEN'S METHOD OF MAKING USE OF THE LIFE-GIVING POWER OF ELECTRICITY HAS
proven its merit. The men who say it cured them of general debility, of wasting weakness; the men who
v have become strong and vigorous by following Dr. Sanden's advice, are the best evidence of the worth of
â  his system. There are thousands of them, and they speak aloud in praise of Dr. Sanden and his noble work.
His work is noble â it is â becauss it lifts men from despondency, it gives them ambition, strength
of mind and body, makes them love life for the pleasure of living. No work is nobler than the good act
. done to your fellow man the act which enables him to be a good, true man.
DR. SANDEN HAS 5000 TESTIMONIALS.
:â¢ He has 5000 letters from men in this State who have been reclaimed from the slow, dragging existence
| caused by the loss of nervous and vital strength. He will give $1000 to any man who will prove one of
these testimonials false. â  They are from grateful menâ men who are not afraid to let the world know that
they were once weak and are now men in the highest sense.

it Is Nature's Own Remedy and Cures All Weakness in Men.
Weakness in the vital organs is unnatural in all men. It is due to improper care of the functions en-
dowed by nature with perfect vigor, and since nature gives th*s strength, if it has been wasted, she must
.be called upon to renew it. Natural remedies must be used. Nothing bears a closer relation to the elements
'of vital and nerve force than electricity. It is natural. It is nature embodied in a portable, convenient and
" effective appliance when Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt is used.

tva-s gained for the people in the matter
of electric lights. The opposing forces
consisted of the Mutual Electric Light
Company, with Supervisors Clinton.
Dodge and Larkinann, on one side, and
the San Francisco Gas and Electric Cotn
pany, with Supervisors Haskins, Delany,
Bheehan, Morton, Britt, Smith and Riv
ers, on the other.
The principal matter before them was
the proposition of the Mutual Electric
lApht Company to furnish the city elec
tric Lights at a saving of $40.^00 per an
num on the present cost, and to save the
people of the city 1100,000 a year, provided
they were allowed to erect - oles for the
stringing of their wires outside the fire
limits. In this connection there was also
considered the plan of the Merchants'
Association for a new system of lighting
the streets by districts and for the sub
stitution of electric lights for gas lamps.
The great issue was the erection of ad
ditional poles by the Mutual Electric
Light Company. Had this privilege boon
granted that company would have been
placed in a position to compete with the
01..]o 1 ..] company everywhere within the city
limits, to the great benefit of every con
sumer of light, and particularly those
who reside outside of the lire limits. But
overy move In the struggle showed Liiat !
the Mutual Company and the people i
were doomed to defeat. But the defeat
appears to be only partial.
While the privilege of erecting addi
tional poles was not mranted, it was de
cided to advertise for bids for lighting
the city by districts, and this will give
the competing company an opportunity
to bid for the lighting within the flre
limits.
it is believed that this Is not the end
of the battle, so far as the Mutual Com
pany Is concerned. It is understood that
they will ask for a writ of mandamus
compelling the board to grant them the
privilege of erecting poles wherever they

ground that not to do so would be dis
criminating against them In favor or the
San Francisco Gas and Electric Light
Supervisor Clinton was called to the
chair. Besides him there were present
Supervisors Raskin?. Delany. Sheehan,
Dodge. Lackmann, Morton, Britt, Smith
and Rivers
P. B. Cornwall, president of the Mutual
Electric Light Company, was granted the
privilege of the floor. After referring to
the proposition his company had made to
the city, he declared that all they asked
to be able to make good their promise
was the privilege of erecting electric
light poles for stringing wires outside the
In reply to the question as to how many
poles his company desired to put up, he
said they wanted to erect as many as
would be needed to fill all applicantions
for lights that might be made to the
company. He further declared that the
San Francisco Gas and Electric Company
was paying license s on a few more than
6000 poles, but that a careful count showed
they had nearer 10,000 poles up in this
city. It was not his company alone which
was asking the privilege from the board
of erecting poles In the outside districts,
he remarked, but every man. woman and
child who lived in those districts and also
those who paid taxes. These people ask
to be furnished light at the same rate
paid by those who live within the fire
limits. "One-third of the month there
i neither gas nor electric light in these
itions," he said, "and I believe that
electric lights on the streets would do
re good in the way of protection to
>ple and property out that way than
many policemen. You have no right
deny them light at the same rate that
ler people enjoy."
upervisor Smith interrupted to say that
â¢ present conditions were not the fault
this board, and that with the asslst
*e of the Merchants' Annotation it ex
ited to provide plenty of light during
the coming year.
Mr. Cornwall, continuing, said that the
people are now paying $19 50 per month
lor incandescent lights, such as the
Mutual Electric Light Company would
furnish for about $12. The average dif
ference, he added, is even greater than
this in some kinds of lights, rie assured
the board that his company would be
glad to be allowed to erect one-third the
number of poles the Gas and Electric
Company has outside the nre limits. In
conclusion he said: "We are prepared to
give the citizens and the city better ac
commodations, better lights and lower
rates than they now enjoy."
Chairman Clinton suggested that Mr.
Cornwall give the number of poles and
their location.
Mr. Cornwall stated that these matters
would be determined as the people made
application for lights. He wanted the
contracts for street lighting let in such
a waj- and at such time as would give
his company time to put up the necessary
poles.
At this point Supervisor Britt, who
throughout the session made wonderful
and frequent exhibitions of his ignorance
of parliamentary usages, sprang what he
evidently thought was a trump card in
the game of freezing out the Mutual
Electric Company for the benelit of its
rival. He called attention to the act
passed by tho last legislature, which
prohibited franchises being granted to
any corporation lor more than two years
without lirst advertising for bids for the
sale of such franchises. If this law ap
plied it would prevent the Mutual from
entering into competition for the con
tract tor lighting the street*, which must
bi- awarded before the Ist of August uf
this your. The franchise would first have
to be sold, and this would take consider
able time. In order that the Mutual may
be able to come into competition with the
Gas and Electric Company it must have
at least three months' time for the erec
tion of its poles and wires outside the
tire limits.
Mr. Cornwall declared that no other
corporation had been limited to two or
even ten years, and added that no other
corporation had experienced the same
ai,.:culty in securing a franchise that his
company had.
Clerk Russell read the act referred to |
by Britt. This provided that all fran
chises lor the use of public streets or
h.ghways must be sold to the highest
biuder, and that bids must be advertised
for.
M. M. Estee, the attorney for the Mu
tual Electric Company, stated that he
did not think the act constitutional, as it
violated section 19, article 11, and section
21, article 1, of the State constitution. He
read these and also a recent decision of
the State Supreme Court, declaring that
the Board of Supervisors had no right to
refuse to grant to one corporation a priv
ilege which it had granted to some other.
He then stated that if the Mutual was
allowed to erect poles outside of the lire
limits it would be in a position to save
the city the sum of $40,00u and to the cit
izens of San Francisco the sum of $100,000
annually.
We are furnishing to-day," he said,
"electric lights at a reduction of 25 per
cent from the price that was charged by
the other companies before we came into
the market."
Supervisor Dodge called attention to
the lact that tho Merchants' Association,
which represented the best business men
in the city, had made a formal request
to the board to see that competition was
made possibl* when the next contract
was let for lighting the <ity. At the
in . sent time, he said, Alamoda was pay
ing $S per month lor what the residents
of this city were paying $16.
He declared that all technicalities of a
minor character should be swept aside.
â¢â¢1 don't think this board can afford to ;
ignore this proposition," he added. it
comes I. .;ure us In too solid a form, me
gentlemen connected with it are all well
known in this community. 1 have yet to ;
hear any legitimate reason advanced
against it. v\ o have u> save time.
Delay means defoat. I move that It is the
sense of this board that in the considera
tion of this question the object shall be
to advertise lor proposals at such a date
that competition may be possible.'
Supervisor Lackmann seconded the mo-
Supervtsor Smith remarked that it was ,
a matter of erecting poles and not a. I
Question of furnishing light, and declared
that he would vote against any plan to i
allow the erection of poles, but would
vote for any measure compelling corpora
tions to put their wires underground.
Chairman Clinton said that the general ,
matter of electric lighting might be dis- \
cussed and that the debate need not be
eonnned only to poles. ....
Hero. Supervisor Podge explained that
the object of his motion was simply to
get at tho intention of the board in rela
tion to competition. "I think the bills for
lighting tho. City Hall are exorbitant,
was his concluding shot.
A rollcall was demanded on Dodge s mo
tion, and it was carried by a unanimous
\V H Hewitt, superintendent of the i
police and fire alarm system, attempted j
to mak" an argument against the erec- i
tion of additional poles; but Dodge spiked
his gun by calling attention to the fact
that the Bell Telephonl Company was !
putting up a large number of poles on
Bush street. In the crossfire that fol
lowed between Dodge and Howitt it de
veloped that Hewitt had ordered these
poles put up on the understanding that
he was to be allowed to string such wires i
as he wanted on them.
Dodpe claimed that the city would i
string no more than two or three wires on
these polos, while the telephone company
would place 200 or 300 on them. He
charged that favoritism was being shown
to the telephone company, while the Mu
tual was being discriminated against.
J M McDonald, of the City Improve
ment Company, asked permission to erect
polos for electric lighting on Haight. De
visadero California and Fillmore streets,
and was instructed to make his applica
tion in writing.
Dodge moved that the committee or the
whole report in favor of the adoption of
the resolution before them, th**. is, to ad
vertise for bids immediately, and that
the bids be so prepared as to allow of
C Â°A S. Baldwin, vice-president of the
Merchants' Association, said that his as
sociation was opposed to poles in the
streets, hut that tho erection of addi
tional polos were necessary In this case
to permit of competition.
Notwithstanding that Dodge's motion
had not boon disposed of. Smith moved
that it 1.0 the sense of the board that, as
requested by tho Merchants' Association,
tho buainess streets, Golden Gate avenue,
Folsom street and Van Ness avenue be
lighted by electric light instead of by gas,
and that the lights be burned every night
In the yoar.
This was carried' without a dissenting
Dodge moved that proposals be asked
for by the board for lighting the city by
districts, as outlined by the Merchants
Association, and that the Street Light
Committoe be instructed to immediately
prepare specifications.
Smith offered an amendment providing
that no additional poles should be erected
in this connection. Dodge accepted the
amendment , saying that he would con
sider the vote taken on the amended mo
tion as a test of how the Supervisors
stood on this important question.
Considerable discussion followed, and
resuUed in Smith withdrawing his
amendment. Then an effort was made to
have action postponed, but without suc
cess.
Smith again offered his amendment, and
it was adopted by the following vote:
Ayesâ Haskins, Delany, Sheehan, Mor
ton. Britt, Smith, Rivers. Total. 7.
Noesâ Dodge, Lackmann, Clinton. Total,
Dodge's motion, thus amended, was
carried.
The committee of the whole resolved
itself into tho Board of Supervisors. Su
pervisor Haskins taking the chair. Chair
man Clinton of the committee of tho
whole reported the two motions made by
Dodge and which had been adopted in
committee, and his report was adopted.
By an oversight the motion made by
Smith, and which had also been adopted
in committee, was not reported to the
board.
Adjournment was taken until Monday
at 2 p. m.
FAIRLY GOOD WORK AT
INGLESIDE.
The coursing at Ingleside Park yester
day was fairly good, and when the short
enders won in many instances those who
had overlooked form were in pocket. A
few good, strong short enders carried
away the money, and it is predicted that
to-morrow the long enders will be in
clover. In one or two courses the judg
ing was found fault with, but as a rule
the decisions wore not objected to. The
hares ran well and the do^s which were
slipped proved to be unusually fast.
Van Knapp was the surprise of the day
when ho fasily downed Alma in a hard,
long, well-fought course, and in conse
quence some money poured into the long
odds book for the final on the surprise.

and Firenza, Gladiator, Pet Kirby. Moun
tain Beauty and Little Dell will get the
bulk of the money on the play.
It Is thought by many that a rank out
sider may carry away the money, but the
knowirg ones say that there are but
two or three In the final race. A large
Saturday crowd had gathered, and it was
regretted by the management that more
pool boxes were not in running order, as
those which were in operation could
hardly carry the money played into them.
Ned Harrigan, the well-known actor, and
Frank McComb of Mountain View were
among those present. A strong play will
possibly be made on Koo Lawn to win
the purse, but the old timers say there
is but one thing in the run, and that is
named Gladiator, owned by the well

There came to the Morgue yesterday

been of such frequent occurrence within
the last year. Bodies of unknown men
â¢with their pockets turned inside out
have been picked up in the bay, the

The case of yesterday hints at a mur

Send for our 100-page catalogue. J
in his vest pocket were found two
white powders, exidently morphine, or
strychnine, wrapped in a piece of news
paper.
On the rules and regulations card
posted on the wall were scrawled in
lead pencil the following: "Friday,
April 15, IS9B, 7 o'clock. She has taken
all nnd not a cent left. Good-by. My
name is no good."
On a torn sheet of note paper lying
on the tab'c were the words, also in
lead pencil: "She has Rob me of all;
not one cent laft. Good biy." On an
other sheet of paper, an advertising
dodger Cor Klondike supplies, were the
words in pencil: "I am rob of all I
had, so good biy. She not even left me
one cent. April IT. IS9S."
Mr. Rudell told the following story:
"I was dozing in a chair in the read
ing-room at about half-past 1 o'clock
yesterday (Friday) morning when this I
man came in with a woman and asked
for a room. He had been drinking and
he held a 50 cent piece in his hand,
which he gave me for the rent of the
room. The woman was about medium
hHsHt, about as tall as I am, and I did
nol take notice of her. We don't take
notice of such people, anyhow. That ;
was the first and the last I saw of
cither of them till I saw the man dead.
The bedmaker yesterday morning tried
the door and found it locked. He
thought that the landlord had made !
the bed, so he went away and said |
nothing about it. This morning he
could not get in and there was no an
swer to his knock. I knocked a whole
lot of times and then broke In the |
door and found that the man was;
dead."
On the person of the dead man were
I found a bunch of three large brass
keys, one of them resembling a pass or
skeleton key. There was also another
key with a brass check attached to it
and the number G3, evidently a room
number, engraved upon it. It did not
belong to the White House. There was
an open-faced silver watch with the
initials C. H. M. scratched on the
back of the case and a brass match
box representing the profile of Colum
bus, with the name "Conrad Mase
mann" engraved upon it. This is prob
ably the name of the dead man.
Coroner Hawkins at once reported
the case to the police, as it was clear
that robbery had been committed and
I possibly murder. If the dead man
should be identified a comparison of the
j writing found in the room with a sam
ple of his known writing will deter
mine w r hether the robber added murder
to the crime.
Several addresses in pencil on the
backs of hotel and other cards were
' found in his pockets. They were 234
O'Farrell, rooms 4 and 5; 111 Grove
street, room 2; 123 Powell street, room
' 71; 35 New Montgomery street; Miss
; Coraline Donnadieu, 617V6 Post street.
The deceased wore as a watch charm
an acorn cut in purple glass.
The facts gleaned from an interview
with Miss Donnadieu at her home last
evening indicate that the notes sup
posed to have been written by the
dead man were probably the work of
some one else. Miss Donnadieu knows
a man named Conrad Masemann and
from a description of the body at the
Morgue is convinced that he is the
one she knew. He came to this city
about three weeks ago with a letter . f
introduction to Miss Donnadieu from
her father, who is in Panama. The
two had gone there from New York
some time ago. and when Donnadieu
learned that Masemann was going to
San Francisco he wrote a letter to his
daughter to notify her of the fact that
he was sick. Miss Donnadieu says
that Mnsemann was probably a Ger
man, but that he spoke with very lit
tle accent and used excellent English
When told of the notes found upon him
she gave it as her opinion that a man
who used as good language as Mase
mann would be able to write better
English than that in the notes
Impersonated an Officer.
Thomas Tlernev a stevedore living at
609 Union Street, was arrested by Officer
Neal Carmirhael and charged with im
personating an officer. Tierney went to
the Vallejo lodging house, owned by
Louis Mattieu, and showing a police
man's star demanded possession of the
house. Mattieu saw the star was not one
belonging to a regular officer, so refused
to recognize the man and had him arrest
ed. Mattieu has bet-n sued for divorce by
his wife, who Is rooming witn Tierney's
family, and it is supposed that the latter
was trying to get possession of the house
for Mrs. Mattieu.

THE SAN FJRANCISCO CALL, SI'NDAY, APRIL 17, 1898.
MAY NOW STOP
THE EXPORTS
Naval Men Anxious That
Supplies for Cuba and
Porto Rico Cease.
Once the War Starts the Block
ading Vessels Will Shut
Out All Transports.
President McKinley Will Not Act
However, Until Duly Author
ized by Congress.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 16.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Presi
dent McKinley is serious considering
the advisability of taking action which
will prevent vessels carrying supplies
to Cuba and Porto Rico. Information
which has been officially received at
the State Department shows that Spain
is purchasing large quantities of pro
visions and coal and is shipping them
into Havana and San Juan Porto Rico,
which will be blockaded by the Ameri
can squadrons in the event of war.
Furthermore, the authorities have
been advised that the Spanish author
ities in Havana and Porto Rico are
working night and day on the harbor
fortifications, and mounting new bat
teries, composed of modern guns. In
addition submarine mines are being
planted and every effort is being made
to give the American fleet a warm re
ception upon its arrival on a hostile
mission in Cuban and Porto Rican
waters.
Recognizing that the most effective
way of reducing Havana and San Juan
will be by means of blockading and by
starvation which will follow among the
soldiers of Spain, I understand that an
effort is being made by the Navy De
partment to have the President take
steps which will result in putting a
stop to the dispatch of supplies from
the United States to the Spanish West
Indies.
It is appreciated that It will be im
possible for Spain to send food or
other supplies from Spain to her col
onies, for the reason that transports
would almost certainly be captured by
blockade vessels which will surround
Cuba, even if they failed to meet an
American cruiser on the high seas.
The department's plan of campaign
against Havana will depend much upon
the condition of the climate in the is
land when hostilities commence. If
the rainy season is at its height and
yellow fever is rampant, it is proba
ble that work, for some time at least,
will be confined to a blockade. The
army will be rushed into the island as
soon as conditions are suitable to make
an attack. So far as Porto Rico is
concerned, it is recognized that there
will have to be army and navy co
operation there, for the reason that
Spain has quite a large military force
on that island.
There is considerable doubt as to
whether the President can, under the
law, as it now stands, forbid the ex
portation of supplies to Cuba and Porto
Rico. When war commences, of course,
an embargo will follow, but whether
he can take such action in time of
peace is a question which the law of
ficials of the Government will serious
ly study before taking action.
That there may be no delay whatever
about the matter Senator Hawley in
troduced in the Senate the resolution
authorizing the President to stop the
exportation of coal. This is only a
step, however, in the direction which
the naval authorities would like to go.
Besides coal it is desired to stop ship
ment of all kinds of provisions and
munitions of war. It is said that the
President considers that the wisest
plan is to secure legislation on the sub
ject. When this has been done, then
he will take such action as Congress
authorizes.

ELECTION AT STOCKTON.
Proposed Annexation of Two School
Districts Defeated.
STOCKTON, April 16.â The election
held In Stockton and the Fair Oaks and
North school districts to-day on the
question of the annexation of the two
outside districts to the city resulted in a
decisive majority against annexation.
Stockton cast a majority of 112 against
annexing the eastern or Fair Oaks addi
tion out of a total of 998 votes, while that
district cast but one majority for it in a
total of 139. The Stockton vote against
the annexation of the north district was
542 out of a total of 1002 votes, making
the majority against the proposition 91
The voters of the north district cast 4i
votes and gave a majority of 8 against
annexation.
The movement in both cases grew out
of the public school money distribution
between the city and the outside dis
tricts, wnich were tormerly granted
school privileges in tÂ«.e city.

FRAOTIOUS HORSES
CAUSE HIS DEATH.
Burlingame Coachman Killed by
Being Hurled From a
Carriage.
REDWOOD CITY, April ""^.âCoroner
James Crowe was called t<> I an Mateo
this morning to hold an Inquest over the
body of a young man named Walter Ab
lett, who was killed by being thrown
from a carriage yesterday morning near
Burlingame. Ablett was coachman for
Frank Carolan of Burlingame, but not
withstanding his position was evidently
highly cultured and well connected. That
he had traveled extensively is shown by
the great number of curios which he had
in his possession. Among them were
some gathered in Egypt, with pictures of
himself taken at Cairo in Egyptian cos
tume. A number of letters and pictures
I from friends and relatives in various
j parts of the world were found in his
trunk. 'Upon his person was found a card
bearing the address of bis father, "J. Ab
lett, Friday Bridge, near Wlsbeck, Cam
bridge, England." Ablett wan a native
of Scotland, and about 30 years old.
Yesterday afternoon Ablett started
from the Carolan place with a double
team to take a friend named Smythe to
San Mateo. The horses became unman
ageable and Smythe jumped outofthecar
riage. The team ran away, and at a
; bridge about 20*) yards from the Carolan
place the carriage was upset, throwing
the driver out. He struck upon his head
i and was rendered unconscious. His skull
i was fractured, and he died about 8 o'clock
yesterday evening.
ON THE TRAIL OF
BOXCAI THIEVES.
Northern Pacific Railroad Detectives
Recover a Quantity of Stolen
Merchandise.
TACOMA. April 16.â 1t develops to-night
that Northern Pacific Railroad detectives
are hot on the track of a gang of thieves
which has been systematically robbing
freight cars along the western end of the
road. Goods for which the railroad has
paid thousands of dollars in settling
claims for losses have mysteriously dis
appeared, until detectives unearthed the
fact that regular hauls were being made
on the Pacific division, east and south of
Tacoma.
Officers here were notified to-day that
the men whom the detectives are after
were in Astoria. Sheriff Mills wired to
Olympia for requisition papers and In
tended going to Astoria via Salem to
night-, when telegrams announced that
the men were no longer in Astoria. The
Northern Pacific is <sald to have ordered
its detectives to spare no expense in cap
! Turing the gang, which apparently learn
ed last week that it was being shadowed.
Several hundred dollars' worth of stolen
cigars, tobacco and shoes have been cap
tured at the gang's cache, twenty-five
miles east of Tacoma.
HEAVY DAMAGES FOR
A FRESNO RANCHER.
Wins a Suit Against the San Joa
quin-Kings River Canal Irriga
*tiori Company.
FRESNO. April 16.â The suit brought by
William Lowry against the San Joaquin-
I Kings River Canal Irrigation Company,
â  which has been on trial before a Jury
| in Judge Rlsley'a court all week, ended
I late this afternoon in a verdict of $20,000
i for the plaintiff. The award of such
heavy damages r;inip as a surprise
I to those who had been following the case.
j It was thought the plaintiff would get a
verdict, but few thought it would be for
so large an amount.
The amount sued for was $25,000, for in
; jury sustained by the flooding of a large
acreage which Lowry was farming. The
damage was alleged to have been caused
by the backing up of water owing to a
dam which the Irrigation Company main
tained across San Joacjuin River.
The defendant asked for twenty days'
! .stay, which was consented to. The case
I will be appealed to the Supreme Court.
It is understood that Miller & Lux are
the real defendants in the action.
PERMITS FOR CUT-OFFS

ceived the following telegram from Con
gressman De Vries:
"Permit from War Department for cut
offs 6 and 7 on the San Joaquln goes
forth to-day. Please rush Sacramento

This long delayed permit means much
to the property owners along the Sacra
mento and San Joaquin rivers. It is very
probable that tho same action will be
taken in regard to work on the New Town
shoals, and as the plans were forwarded
to-day word will be no doubt received in
a very short time.

RAZORS IN THE
ATMOSPHERE
J. Baltimore, a Barber,
Carved His Sweet-
heart's Husband.
A Dealer in Coal Oil Who Re
grets That He Thought He
Was Infatuated.
Sent to the Hospitnl After Attempting
to Show a Rival the Error
of His Way.
James Baltimore, colored, and a
barber by profession, is in all kinds of
difficulty because of a love affair in
which the wife of a local coal-oil
dealer is intermingled. For weeks past
the clandestine meeting's have taken
place, but a few nights ago the hus
band became aware ot the visits of his
wife and went to the barber shop of his
rival, and in an attempt to assassinate
his competitor received a deep gash
in the calf of the right leg, which
necessitated a visit to the Receiving
Hospital, where the wound was dressed.
The case, or rather love affair, shows
how easily a man of good looks may
win the affections of a lady of trusting
disposition, be she what nationality or
'me nature ha* made her, but in this
case the lady was white, and in conse
quence the husband was made the
mere jealous thereby. Nature fre
quently plays peculiar tricks, and the
coal -oil dealer thinks razors are even
more tricky, but he is willing to leave
things as they are, since his better half
has decided that she will no longer
leave the fireside of the man she has
chosen, and in consequence Baltimore
is shaving his customers in a quiet
way while his brain is whirling in a
mist of plans and determination.
It is not at all probable that the case
will find its way into the courts, but
there are rumors which flit here and
there that a body may find its way
into the Morgue, but neither husband,
nor rival seems to worry, as it is prob
able that the center of attraction has

FAIR ART FOR CHARITY
IT Is a triumph of femininity. It was
arranged by women for the benefit
of women, and if there weren't
women's, pictures to be painted, who'd
be a portrait painter? The portrait
loan exhibition for the benefit of the
California Women's Hospital was
opened last night. All San Francisco was
there; that is. the part of San Francisco
that attends first nights, whose nature is
such that society considers them proper
functions. The portrait loan is evidently
quite the thing. Beautiful women In
Easter bonnets and spring toilettes gaze
admiringly through their gold-rimmed
lorgnettes at the beautiful painted women
upon the wall who gaz^ admiringly hack
again. And both are worth going to see,
and seem equally conscious of being part
of the show.
As to the men, they're merely adjuncts,
shadows that serve to bring out the deli
cate hues and graceful draperies of the
more gorgeous sex. And for one spec
tator who lingers before a man's portrait
there are twenty before his feminine ri
val's. Joseph Strong's portraitsâ even
though the subject be a manâ attract
much attention. Matthews' portrait of B.
C. Samuels, Cadenasso's spirited, artistic
Piazzoni, Voss' portrait of Rudolph Neu
man are the exceptions. The exquisite
Boldini portrait of litttle Ethel Crocker,
a butterfly in gauzy blue, just lighted
upon the rose satin couch, and J. W.
Clawson's charming pastel of Miss Mary
Bell Gwin in her grandmother's pink
satin gown are the favorites.
This pastel is a beautiful bit of work
and the serious dark eyes, the slender
brows and the white forehead with the
pale pink background, framed in simple,
miniature-like fashion, make this one of
the most beautiful faces on the wallsâ
or off it, for that matter. Yates 1 portrait
of Miss Sullivan is an example of blonde
loveliness, an entirely different type from
Clawson's picture.
The collection of miniatures is a very
interesting one. The one loaned by Mag
a Heu ,7Tnann o f Miss Congreve, daugh-
V^nJt! v " a , mllton Fish of London is
a < osuj half dozen square inches. Tha
face is a beautiful ono. the poise of the
head and the delicate work make this
one of the gems of the collection in the
ibrary. that includes the miniature dono

UNCLE SAM
CHECKS MONITORS
But They Ars the Hydraulic
Ones in the Moun
tains.
Far Reaching Decision by Federal
Engineers Defining "Hydraulic
Minng "
Uncle Sam has told Californians what
"hydraulic mining" is. As hydraulic
mining was Invented in California and
here achieved Us vast development, this
may sound odd to some, but in fact the
hydraulic miners, mining engineers and
lawyers of this State have not known un
til now what the definition of the term is.
This refers mainly to the legal sense of
the term, of course, and the great im
portance of the exact legal sense of the
term. and the conflict over It that has long
raged make Uncle Sam's decision of the
')>i<-stion the most important ruling af
fecting mining interests that has come
forth for a lung time.
The ruling is announced by the Federal
engineers composing the California Debris
Commissionâ Colonel Suter, Major Heuer
and Lieutenant Deakyn. After months
of consideration, the commission has just
communicated to Attorney John M.
Wright, chairman of the committee on
dredging of the California Miners' Asso
ciation, the brief announcement that the
commission defines hydraulic mining to
l>e "mining by means of water delivered
under pressure through a nozzle."
.Lhis simple looking definition means
that the Federal engineers who regulate
hydraulic mining on the watersheds of
the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers,
under the Caminetti law. will assume
that that law and their jurisdiction cov
ers the washing of old tailings, of piles of
gravel tunneled out of drift mines, etc.,
li water is applied nirough a nozzle,
under pressure." This is an application
of the law against which there has been
much -opposition among the miners.
Until the Caminetti law was passed in
IW3 the term "hydraulic mining" had
never been written in a statute unless in
cidentally, and had never been fully de
iin< d by a court. The Caminetti law pro
vided that for its purposes the term
should have "the meaning and applica
tion given to said terms in said State."
This left a fine iield for study and dis
pute. A monitor playing on the side of
8 mountain was hydraulic mining plainly
enough, but between this and ordinary
siuicing In other placer mines, which the
law let alone, puzzles quickly appeared,
march 21. 1SO:{. the State Legislature de
fined hydraulic mining to be mining by
the application of water under pressure
"against a natural bank." But this defi
nition was not in existence when the
Caminetti law was approved three weeks
Im I'm !â .
Under this State definition if a miner
turned ;i gi:mt on a pilo Of Old iniliiiÃK
or 'Hi gravel drifted out from under lava
beds ur even on a gravel bank broken ;
down with dynamite he would nut bft
working a "natural bank." and so would
!.'â¢! be ci gaged In "hydraulic mining" and :
subject to tli" Caminetti law. The detini- 'â 
tions given by many mining authorities
have been compiled, but they vary and:
wcr<- not framed for legal use or with
the prtsÂ«-nt situation fn view. At the last
State miners' convention in Octrtber there
was a warm discussion for several hours,
over a resolution to have presented to
Congress ;>. Mil defining "hydraulic min
ing" as it has been defined by the State
Legislature, but the matter was dropped.
Uast fall the Anti-Debris Association
brought the issue up by beginning pro- j
ceedings fur the first time against drift
mines hi Nevada County using water j
under pressure on gravel taken out, but
the suits were dropped.
SOUTH OF THE CHANNEL.
Increased Activity Noticeable in the
Manufacturing District.
The coming war cry with other local
Improvements has givpn an impetus to
all branches of manufacturing on the
south sidr of the channel.
The Potrero district, with its varied in
dustrial branches, has assumed an active
phase during the past few weeks. The
Rolling Mills, whose work was almost at
a .standstill, has received some weighty
contracts for work. Among these is one
order from the San lLateo and San Fran
cisco Kailroad Company for rails for its
read from Thirtieth street to Baden, over
which a double track will be laid. This
improvement is only a continuation of
what the company has already done in
the betterment of its road within the
city limits, where the heaviest steel rails
known on street railroads have been sub
stituted for the light ones formerly laid.
Following this, the Southern Pacific
Company has ordered rails for its road
at South San Francisco, where a short
cut is being made between this city and
San Jose. To get the rails out on time
that of Marie Gordon, and a graciously
lovely Recamier loaned by Mrs. M. H. de
Young.
The ohlna and sliver have their share of
worshipers. There are beautiful pieces
of each; wonderful old Nurnberg wed
ding cups, chastely simple pieces of Span
ish sliver, historical bits from famous
European collections; among them that
of Selliere, and a delicately pink Le Boeuf
whose mate adorns le petit Trianon.
The exhibition is well arranged and
worthy of the setting, the Hopkins In
stitute affords. It is not so large that
one tires of beautiful things, and It con
tains so much that Is interesting and such
a variety of works of artâ and of nature,
for both these contracts, a force of 200
men has been set to work during the
week.
At the Union Iron Works additional
hands have been put on to fit out the
Spreckels tugboats recently purchased by
the Government for use in this harbor.
This brings the working force of the yard
up to 3500 men all told.

GREAT THEATRICAL
TRIPLE ALLIANCE
Frederick Warde, Louis James
and Mme. Rhea to
Join Forces.
They Will Tour the West in Shake
spearean and Classic
Drama.
Arthur Warde, the son of Frederick
Warde, the tragedian, who was for many
years associated with Louis James, is the
authority for the confirmation of the re
port that has been in circulation for
some time past that his father, Louis
James and Madame Rhea will next season
tour the South and West as a great triple
star combination. Mr. Warde is at pres
ent in the city in advance of Marie Jan
sen.
When interviewed relative to the ru
mor of the alliance between the two act
ors and actress, Mr. Warde said:
"Yes, it is true. Wagrenhals and Kem
per, the present managers of James, are
the promoters of the enterprise. I an.
authorized by my father to announce thin
as a fact. The company will organize
in New York next season and will tour
the West and South. The alliance is
only for one season."
When asked why the combination
would not appear in the East, Mr. Wards
replied:
"The East does not support tragedy and
melodrama, and the West does."
Warde and James are admitted to be
able representatives of the old and new
schools of Shakespearean and classic
drama, and their alliance with Mme.
Rhea v.ill be the strongest of its kind
since the days of Booth, Barrett and Mod
jfska.
Their repertoire will include "Macbeth."
"Julius Caesar," "Othello." "Hamlet,"
"Much Ado About Nothing," "School for
Scandal" and a new play to be announced
later.
Memorial Day.
At a preliminary meeting- held in the
hall of Lincoln Post, G. A. R., it was
decided to call a convention of delegates
from all the local Grand Army posts for
Eva: Every afternoon about 5 o'clock I begin to gape and
yawn and I yawn and gape and yawn till bed-time. If
I nip one yawn in the bud the next follows almost im-
mediately and is bound to be a regular jaw-breaker.
r.-AY: I had such an experience myself one time, and I re-
member asking the doctor whether one should try
to keep from yawning, and he said no, that the act of
gaping gives to the blood more oxygen and acts by
mechanical pressure on the heart and lungs. If one
has chronic gaping it is a symptom which should cause
the affected one to look 'after her general health, for
it is a sure sign that something is wrong.
MRS. Moore s It is pretty well understood that yawning is an
ailment that comes from indigestion or lack of tone in
the system and may be cured by taking a Ripans
Tabule before retiring. After a few days of this treat-
ment the tendency will disappear.

It is reported that years a^o Joaquln

In London; if hr> attained It there,
America would give it to him. Since
that time America's valuation of the

Increased, a fact evidenced by the exo

sirous of winning something more than
compliments for their efforts in art and

Institutionally we are democratic;
esthetlcally we defer to the Ider cul

A half century ago the number of
aspirants was smaller; furthermore, na

LYNN INSANE
A LONG TIME
Six Men From Agnews
Testify of Former
Madness.
Evidence That May Bear on the
Story Related by
Griffiths.
Judge Ogden Orders the Prisoner to
Be Taken to Uklah
Asylum.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, April 16.
John W. Lynn la insane. This fact was
decided to-day by half a dozen of the at
tendants at Agnews Asylum, who knew
, Lynn while ho was at work at that insti
tution, and who stated that in their
opinion he has been a crazy man for a
lonp time.
This vexed insanity cn.Â«e was brought
up before Judge Ogden This morning, be
ing the fourth day during which ex
'â  perts and others have been contradicting
: each other over the symptoms of the
' would-be wife murderer.
Drs. Rucker and Dunn maintained that
i Lynn was shamming, and In support of
' their views they laid before the court
' some detailed accounts of their scientific
| tests. On the other hand. Drs. Barber and
Rabe, who recommended Lynn's commit
ment declared that their finding was
..met. Dr. L. F. Herrick of Stockton
Indorsed the hitters' views.
When court opened this morning five
attendants from the Agnews Asylum
staff appeared before Judge Ogden, and
their evidence was regarded as conclu
sive They all agreed that Lynn was on
the verge of insanity when he Berved at
the asylum, and they gave many interest
ing incidents in his career at that msti-
C. E. Wilson said that he was the con
fidential agent of Lynn in the asylum,
and that wnile there he wrote not less
than twenty letters to Lynn's relatives
at his dictation. The letters were so in
coherent mat Wilson knew uiev were
not the product of a sane mind. On one
occasion Lynn asked Wilson to kill him.
Lynn said:' "You are my friend. Wilson.
I "want you to kill me." 'You are
crazy," replied Wilson. "No one knows
it better than I do." replied Lynn.
.h.s.-ph Dawd said that Lynn believed
he had been frequently assaulted by his
wife with a knife in the presence <<f their
child. Lynn confided to Dawd that he
had choked his wife severely and that
he thought the best thing to do to end
his misery would be to kill the woman.
!1. W. McCabe, E. Ingraham and H. A.
Braden of Agnews all asserted that they
thought Lynn unbalanced mentally.
In ordering Lynn's commitment. Judge
Ogden said: "I confess I have grave
doubts as to the mental condition of this
man Lynn, but I am bound to place much
confidence in the testimony of these last
witnesses, who are in daily contact with
insane patients and who unanimously be
lieve this patient insane. As a general
rule, I give little, credence to a plea of'
insanity which is so suddenly made and
which is simultaneous with the commis
sion of an awful crime. Had it not been
for the testimony of these last witnesses.
I should hesitate to commit him, but
would hastily send him to the Police
Court, where trial is awaiting him. The
testimony of Drs. Dunn and Rucker had
great weight, but it is not sufficient to
overcome the preponderance of evidence
adduced this morning. Nothing remains
for me to do but to order him into the
custody of the State Hospital, and ac
cordingly I will send him to Ukiah."
GETTING AFTER
THE UNIVERSITY
Eastern Prohibitionists Fight
ing the Liquor Trade
in Berkeley.
Make Sweeping Charges Against
Faculty, "Frat-a" and the Viti
cultural Department.
BERKELEY, April 16.â New York \
Voice, which has recently been conduct-
Ing a vigorous campaign against liquor- j
drinking at Yale, has turned its guns on
the University of California. . It makes >
sweeping charges against members of the
faculty for having wagons of liquor-sell
ers stop regularly at their doors, against
student clubs and fraternities, in many of
which, the Voice asserts, liquor is used
without stint, and against the viticultural
department of the university ' *or serving
the wine and brandy business."
Berkeleyans do not deny the statement
of the Voice that liquor is delivered at
the homes of university professors. Near
ly all of the liquor business of Berkeley
la done through Oakland, and the deliv
ery of liquor in Berkeley has never been
held to be in contravention of the mile
limit law. "The whole question of pro- |
hibition is involved," declared a member
of the faculty, In regard to the Voice's ;
attack. "It is the professors' own busi
ness whether they want liquor at their j
homes or not, and the university is In no
wise involved."
The university people do not take very j
kindly to the Voice's attack. Several
weeks ago the Voice requested President i
Martin Kellogg to arrange for the distri- !
bution of its prohibition literature at
Berkeley; but President Kellogg, who is I
a Yale man and heartily disapproved the
Voice's method of attack on his alma !
mater, curtly refused. Another member j
of the faculty at Berkeley particularly i
resents the Voice's attack upon the viti- I
cultural department of the university. ,
Thp paper's criticism Is as follows: " I
M.-anwhtle the university viticultural .com
mission was allowed fisoo per year from the
pneral fundâ money that would otherwise ro ;
to instruction in the art* and sciences, library, ;
labratory. eacâ which to serve the wine
and brandy business.
It is confidently expected that the next I>k- !
islature will apportion at leaÃt BSQO a year to
carry on the work for Bacchus that was done
Wil* y y HH e vltiru ltural Commission for
HS.OOO a year-the latter having cost the State
$221,000 in the fourteen years of Its existence. i
According to a member of the faculty !
the attack of the Voice is an attack upon
the wine Industry of California. "Viti
culture, he says, "as one of the largest
industries of the State, receives attention '
from our Agricultural Department, and
vineyardtsts as well as other agricultur
ists, receive assistance."

Bishop Rowe Sends News of
the Hardships Existing
in Skaguay.
Union Hospital Started That Needs
Funds to Carry on Its
Wfcrk.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 16.
Bishop Rowe of the Episcopal Church, j
who is at present in Alaska, has writ-
ten to Rev. F. J. Mynard, rector of St.
John's Church, a letter making an appeal
for help which will be read to the congre
gation to-morrow. The letter says in
part:
The people of Skaguay have been forced to
start an emcrgenry hospital, railed a union.
The need of it beggars description. It has
j aided and relieved many cases of the greatest
distress. The people have responded to the j
: cries and appeals to their humanity nobly.
Impressed with the importance of the lnsti
; tutiun the representatives of the public have
i asked me to take charge of it. and I have done
I It. They have transferred it all Into our hands.
! The emergency hospital is a simple ln B cabin
I thirty feet long and eighteen feet wide. One
room on the ground floor answers for kitchen
and cots; one room above, which is but the
half story or attic. In this room 1 found twelve
cots, and ten of them were occupied by men
in all stages of pneumonia and meningitis
Yesterday, while visiting it, a young man was
I brought in from the summit, eighteen miles
S on a sled, tied on to keep him from rolling off
; draggt*! over rocks and through mud ail the
j distance.
Last night I was with a man, who died in
my arms, from New Hrunswick, telling me
what to say to his father and mother and sls
. ters. It was a most sad, most pitiful sight
If the sickness li going to increase the a'n
i peal to our humanity cannot be ignored The
sick are absolutely friendless, helpless and
without a hospital would simply die by the
j way. We have one woman nurse, two men
and a cook in charge. The Skaguav doctors
! are attending for little or nothing, as' expenses
permit.
We must build an additionâ only of an In
expensive and temporary character. I am *o
lng to begin this immediately. The present ac
commodation is totally inadequate and unsuit
able.
We have assumed a great responsibility but
it Is an opportunity most Important. What I
want is this: Telegraph those facts to head
quarters, church papers, to any of our rirh
, church people and to Miss Emery, and say
we need money at once to carry on this work.

over the validity of the recent annexa
tion is to be prolonged indefinitely. To
day Attorney General Fitzgerald filed a
motion for a new trial in the case set
tled by Judge Hall, giving a decision in
favor of the city. The insufficiency of
evidence to justify the decision; errors
in law occurring at the trial and except
ed to by the plaintiff, and because the
decision'of the court Is against the law.
are the grounds given for this move. If

tions it will be appealed to the Supreme
Court.
JUDGE ALLEN ' EXPLAINS.
His Decision Only Partially Kills the
the Pool Ordinance.
OAKLAND, April 16.â Judge Allen says
that his decision dismissing the pool sell
ers from custody yesterday does not in
validate the whole ordinance, but only
the portion prohibiting persons from re
ceiving money to bet on the races. He
holds that the cigar men only act as
stakeholders for the race track gamblers
when placing their money on the races.
The judge says that the dismissals were
made with the consent of Deputy Dis
trict Attorney Moore. Mr. Moore is of
the opinion that the ordinance is entirely
knocked out. Its main purpose was to
prohibit the existence of pool rooms
where money was received by the agent
to place on races at the track, and a3
this is the section declared invalid, the
whole ordinance practically falls to the
ground.

Elijah Price, who died in Berkeley Oc
tober 5, IW, but appointed C. P. Gibbon,

stated that there was no doubt in his
mind that Mrs. Price had attempted to

Officer P. G. Vauraky. the gifted lin
guist of the Police Department, won new
laurels tor himself last night by captur

fog district, blessing the policeman for
the hill climbing he encountered.

panied the wagon that the boys had in
sulted him and to place a charge of com
mitting a nuisance and assaulting an offi
cer against them. With these serious
crimes against thorn the youngsters were
removed to the City Prison. Desk Ser
geant Bidwell had to bend over his desk

that they had assaulted a minion nf the
law. Thinking there was some mistake.
he Informed Lieutenaiit Birdsell, and tho
latter detailed Sergeant Blank to find
Vauraky and see how badly injured he
was. Instead at me^tiner a dilapidated
officer, Blank found Vauraky nursing his
wounded feelings. In three or four lciii
guages he tried to explain to his superior
how he was insulted. After admonish
ing him not to be over-sensitive in future,
Blank returned to headquarters just in
time to see the school boys being released

good to his fellow men. Dr. Stout worked
night and day among the plague stricken
pasengers, and so succesful was he in his
efforts that not one life was lost on the
trip.
Arriving in this city he at once opened
up the practice of medicine and for years
was one of the leading physicians in the
<ity. About ten years ago, however, he
lost his sight as the result of a surgical
operation, and being thus deprived of the
means of earning a livelihood he became

Fellows' Cemetery, where they were
cremated in pursuance with the last
wishes of the deceased.

the rounds, and after having imbibed a
sufficient quantity from the cup that

CAUGHT THE
"GAS" BURGLAR
IN HER ROOM

A notable capture was made yes
terday. It involved special daring
on the part of the lady captress; a
mystery finally solved as to the iden
tity of the captive, and. last, the suc
cessful running down of an insidious
ly dangerous kind of a burglar â no
less than the bogus "gas inspector,''
who has been preying for weeks upon
unsuspecting householders on both

ineptly in tho employ of E. S. Rothchild.
at 2108 Jacks. m street, caught a burglar
yesterday. It was a burglar the police
have been hunting for several weeks with
their most skilled detectives, and it was
n great satisfaction to them to have the
man in custody, even though a woman
handed him over t<> them a prisoner. Miss
Dnane had a lively tussle with her cap
tive- before he surrendered, and she held
him fully half an hour until a policeman
arrived. In the fight with the burglar for
Bupremacy Miss Duane nearly choked the
life out of the mini, who struggled with
her for freedom, and when she gave her
prisoner over to the police the burglar
was without a collar or tie. His shirt
band had be<Â»n torn and all the buttons
of his vest were scattered over the floor.
His coat was ripped up th<- bark and be
was a physical wreck. "When the police
man arrived he had given in to the supe

sprawled on the door, tearful to move.
Miss Duane was a modest heroine when

Two Doctors, No Benefit.
Tried CUTICURA REMEDIES
with Rapid Cure.
I was troubled several years with cutaneous
diseases which developed into chronic Ec-
zema, which spread all orer my bead, and
down on my face. I took medical treatmout
from two doctors and received but little re-
lief. Then I tried several lotions, etc., which
â wo bad in the store, but only received littlo
relief from them. At times, the dieadful
Itching becamo almost intolerable. When I
was heated, the Eczema became painful, and
almost distracted me. 1 was advised to try
Cuticcra Remedies and (lid so, and found
them all that is claimed for them. The Ecze-
ma rapidly disappeared, and I am well, with
no trace of any cutaneous disease. Shall
aiwavs recommend Cuticura to all.

Our babe, two months old, broke out in sores
over her faco and cars. She seemed to be in

I noticed your advertisement in our homo

for our Sadie. I used tho Cuticura (oint-
ment) and Cuticura Soap, and they were a
jrreat benefit to her. I did not like togivo

saw that she must have something to drive the

she told of the capture. She la a sistrr
ol Policeman Morris Imam?, and she said
she was simply holding up the family
reputation for capturing offenders of the
law.
"There was a shoe peddler at the back
door trying to sell Katie McGivney, the
housemaid, a pair of sinus." she said. "I
h;i<l bought .i p.iir from him a few days
previously, and the kind he was trying to
sell her were n<>i the same nor as pood as
he had given me. To convince him of
that I went to my room to get them and
show him the difference. When I opened
the door I noticed a rocking chair near
the foot of the bÂ»-d moving. I thought it
strange, and looked to see what caused it.
and close to the rocker and just under
the fftf < â < >t of the bed was a man's tan-col
ored shoe.
"I looked under the bed and saw a man
there, and asked him what he was doing.
He replied that he was in the house to
examine the gas meter. I thought he was
in a strange place t"r that, and I ordered
him out. He refused to come, and I
caught hold of his foot and pulled him
half way from his hiding place, when he
promised that he would come out himself.
A.- soon as he was dear of the bed and on
his feet I caught him by the throat and
I held on. I called to Katie, hut she did
: not hear me until we had ncutlled out of
the. room and Into the hall. Then the
burglar threatened that if I did not let
him go he would throw me over the ban
ister. Katie heard us fighting in the hall,
: and she came and helped me.
"Then the Bhoe peddler came and of
j fered to help, but we were afraid he might
! have been an accomplice of the burglar,
and we would not let him near us or the
man. By that time Katie and I and the
burglar were down on the main floor.
The shoe peddler, to show his good faith,
went and got a young man to go for the
â  police, and about half an hour later the
â  patrol wagon arriveu and took the robber
away. H.> took $20 GO from a drawer in
my room, but he threw It out of his
pocket in the scuttle. I was afraid he had
got Mrs. Kothchlld's jewelry, and if it
was gone it might have been hard to
keep suspicion from either Miss McGivney
; or myself, and ] took good care that the
burglar did not get away. As luck would
, have it. he only got the little money we
had saved and which we kept in our
room."
The burglar is the one who has been
gaining admittance to the residences of
his victims under the pretext of being an
inspector of gas meters and gas regulators
in the employ of the Electric Gas Kegu
lator Company. During the past six
weeks numerous complaints have reached
tin: police of the operations of the bold
I burglar, and every effort was being made
i to capture him.
The prisoner is only a boy. He claims
he Is only 16 years of age and asks that
he be sent to the reform school Instead
of to a long term in State prison, fie
gives his nnme as Charles Grant, but
i hints that It 1b not correct. Cnarles Gar-
I land is believed by the police to be his
I true name, and they think that Mlnneap-
I oils Is his home. The prisoner, however.
â¢ says he is from Grand Rapids, and that
j previous to his coming to San Francisco
]he worked on a farm near that city. He
; claims he <;iin>' to this city early in Jan
j vary, and that he had 1160 when he ar
i rived. He claims he trl.d to get work,
! but was not successful, but the police say
j he was for a time employed in a Post
street restaurant. The prisoner Bays his
money dwindled down rapidly, and one
day. seeing the attractive posters an
nouncing the races across the bay, he
went to the race track and risked a few
dollars. He won and that started his
downfall. He kept on playing the races.
, Sometimes he won '.it oftener he lost,
I and he was 8008 Without money.
"I had to live," he mHL 1 could not
I get work, and I studied out a plan of
[burglary. I went to the gas company's
I office one day and got in conversation
With one of the clerk.-; about the gas reg

1 their blank stationery. Armed with that
; I had no difficulty in getting into the

and put it all on the races. Of course I
j lost it all, and here I am. I was too suc
| cessful as a burglar and kept at It. I
did not intend to rob so many places
when I started out, hut when it came so
easy I kept on. and it was all for me ex-
I cltement of the race track.
"1 robbed a good many places In this
city In the disguise of a gas Inspector.
! I do not know the names of the people
who lived in the houses. 1 only picked
out the places that had the appearance
j of being the homes of wealthy persons
and I always got enough to pay me for
my trouble at each of them. I robbed
two places in Oakland and one In Ala
meda. The same gas certificates I carried
here admitted me across the : my t 0 ie
houses I tried.
"I walked into the house in which I was
caught by the side door, and there was
no one to stop me. if i im<l been ques
tioned I depended on my bogus creden
tials to carry me through. The servants
whom J expected to meet were engaged
with a peddler at the front of the house
when I entered, and when I heard the
girl come up the stairway I hid under the
bed, but she found me and gave me a
hard fight. As soon as she took hold of
mo I knew I was no match for her in a
fight, and she had the best of it from the
etart. I was fairly caught and I will
THE SAX FRAKCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 17, 1898,
take my medicine, though I wish to go
t<> the reformatory instead of the State
Prison for the sake of my relatives."
Among the residences robbed by Grant,
alias Garland, is that of H. F. A. Schuss
ler, 1905 Van Ness avenue, where about
â $1000 worth of jewelry was taken. That
was on March 25. On March 28 the resi
dence of Mrs. Hecht was entered by the
bogus gas inspector and about $300 worth
of goods taken. The same robber gained
entrances Into the residences of B. S.
Heller, 1501 California street, and J.
Koshland, ISOS Pine street.
W. E. H. Williams, the general mana
ger of the Electric Gas Regulator Com
pany, characterizes the certificate used
by Grant to obtain an entrance into the
houses that he has burglarized as a for
gery. It la the custom of the company to
issue cards of identification to its inspec
tors, and Grant had one of these, but he
managed to destroy it. The Inspectors
are also required to wear a badge, as this
ensures a double protection to the com
pany's patrons.
When arrested Gr*ant had upon him
one of the company's agreement blanks,
which is signed with the address of the
person making application for a regu
lator to be attached to their gas fixtures.
This agreement had upon it the name
of H. Lydan Sr., and upon the part of
the company was signed by R. F. Will*
iams.
Mr. Williams said: "Besides the card
of identification and the badge worn by
our employes, they are required to pre
sent the agreement blank which is
signed at our office by the person desir
ing the regulators attached. Any one
would know their own signature, and this
we do to prevent fakirs from passing
themselves off a.s our employes. I do
not know how the boy secured the agree
ment blank. We are continually -warn
ing our patrons to look out for these
fakirs, and we take every precaution that
we can to guard against them. Grant has
worked the same scheme at every house
that he has entered, and we have boon
trying for some time to catch him. We
were aware that he had a forged card
and had warned people against him."
PRECITA VALLEY CLUB.
A General Line of Improvements
Needed Along the Old
Creek Bed.
Nothing less than a general line of im
provement along the bed of the old Mis
sion creek will be acceptable to the resi
dents of the Precita Valley. The prop
erty owners through the improvement
club of that section, ask that the low
lying land and swamp be filled in to the
grade and proper sewers put into the
streets. This, with the extending of the
1 streets running north and south from
Twenty-ninth to the base of Bernal
Heights, will be acceptable. They want
Brewster, Joy, Hope, Wolf and Potrero
streets extended, graded and fixed in
such condition that the people living
thereon can get to and from their resi
dences into the streets that have rail
road accommodation. Families living on
these streets are compelled to place pipes
en the street for a water supply whloh
is obtained from private wells in the
vicinity, as the water company refuses
'to lay mains until such time as the
streets are graded.
Another complaint goes forth that the
children who live on the side of the hill
are compelled to walk a mile to the near
, est school building. A primary classroom
Is asked for at Potrero and Costa streets,
where these children could attend, but so
; far the Directors have turned a deaf ear
to the entreaties of the parents in this re
gard.
Somo of the streets are being paved
pi< c -i meal and are in a worse condition
than they were before they were com
menced. Bryant street Is instanced as
being one of those. Here the wooden
sever that answered a purpose has been
torn out and the sipage from the City
and County Hospital aft also from the
private residences is permitted to drain
; into a vacant lot, endangering the health
of the entire community. As a result of
this several suits are about to be com
menced against the city by residents of
the infected section. Scarcely a week
passes but a delegation from either the
I Supervisors or the Health Department
! from the City Hall visits the place In rÂ«
; sponse to a petition, but the visits are
; barren of any good that the people can
see so far.
Smarting under what they deem z.
wrong toward them as citizens and tax
payers, they are becoming terribly In
earnest In their protests for a general
line of Improvement right through the
entire valley.
JANITOR JORDAN PLEADS.
Guilty of Embezzling Money From
Letters, but Bore a Good Repu
tation Before That.
John W. Jordan, tho colored porter of
the Postofflce In the Custom House build
ing, was taken before United States Dis
trict Judge de Haven yesterday morning
to plead to the charge of embezzling a
valuable Jotter from the general delivery
department. He pleaded guilty, and in
troduced Rev. Dr. Andrews and several
others to testify to his previous good
reputation In mitigation of sentence.
Judge de Haven announced that he
would pronounce sentence next Wednes
day, and the prisoner was committed to
Jail until that time. Jordan Is only 29
years old and has a wife and two chil
dren. He had been in the employment of
the Postoffice for several years, but he
began stealing money out of letters only
two months ago. The letters he destroy
ed by burning them In the stove.
For the Orphanage.
The histrionic society of Trinity School
â will render Augustin Daly"s charming
comedy, "7-20-8," for the benefit of the
Maria Kip Orphanage, at the Bush Street
Theater, on Thursday evening. April 21,
and a matinee on Saturday, April 23. The
proceeds of the benefit will be devoted
to the liquidation of the debt on the new
homo at Lake street and Seventh avenue.
The little comedy which will be presented
is so well known as to need but little
comment, and the excellent cast which
ha.s been secured guarantees those who
attend will not only help along a worthy
cause, but will have an evening of un
ailoyed pleasure.
Injured by a Runaway.
Jacob Jacobs commenced suit yesterday
against Peter Tautphaus to recover $10,000
damages for personal Injuries received on
February 17 last. Jacobs was driving
along Pine street, when a runaway team
owned by the defendant collided with his
wagon and threw him from his seat.
Jacobs now claims damages for the In
juries he received, alleging that it was
due to the carelessness of one of Taut
phaus employes, who left the team un
hitched-
DEMOCRATS
MUST BOW
TO BUDD
Yesterday's Fight in
the State Central
Committee.
Harney Faction Wins the
Battle for Local
Supremacy.
Meeting Place of the Conven
tion Has Not Yet Been
Determined.
FUSION IS NOW FAVORED
A Committee for tho Good of the
Party Appointed to Adjust All
Differences.
Several disputed political questions
were definitely settled yesterday at the
meeting of the Democratic State Central
Commit te. It was demonstrated to the
entire satisfaction of a number of the
members of the local Democratic suicide
club that Governor Budd is still a factor
in the affairs of the party and that it
takes something more than a declaration
of intention to make a political boss.
For several days past the leaders of the
Sullivan wing of the local Democracy
have let it be known that they would
bring about a test vote at yesterday's
meeting for the purpose of settling once
for all the strength of the Harney Dem
ocrats in the Stato Committee. They
were as good as their word. The test
vote was taken and the Harneyitos won
out In the easiest kind of fashion and
with enough to spare to leave no doubt
in the minds of their opponents as to
what the future holds in store. It was a
Ralney day for the Sulllvanites.
To sum up the situation in a few words
it Is only necessary to say that all dis
puted questions have been turned over to
a committee of nine members of the State
Committee for adjudication. This sub
committee Is to be known as the Com
mittee for the Good of the- Tarty, and Is
composed of Chairman Alford. H. M.
Fitzgerald. Frank H. Gould, James^ H.
Budd Eugene N. Deuprey. Gavin McNab,
Ben M. Maddox, Charlea M. Cassia and
one member from south of the lehachapl
Hn.- not yet named. Into the hands of
this committee have been given not only
such manors as pertain to the good ol
the party " but also the very distressing
differences that are the rocks upon whidi
the local Democracy uaa split. Sn far
as results are concerned, the committee
Is to be considered as merely a necessary
formality No matter what Its report on
the various questions submitted to it
may be the result will be the same. The
forces Of Ralney and Harney. which are
the forces of Budd, will accept what suits
them when the report is presented to the
State Committee. TneM things being so
the shrewd ones anticipate an early
stampede of the Sullivan forces to the
slaXrds of their more forceful oppo-
n The" question of selecting a meeting
place for the State convention was not
settled Delegations from Santa Cruz,
Sacramento and San Jose were on hand
to urge the respective merits of their
towns There were also a number of cit
izens present to present the claims of ban
Francisco as a meeting place for the con
vention. It is the general impression that
when final action ta taken Santa Cruz
or Sacramento will be the place selected.
Boon after the committee convened
Chairman Alford announced the names
of the members of the Committee for the
Good of the Party, the appointment of
which was provided for at the last meet-
Ing of the State committee. The real
business of the day was begun by Bro
beck of San Francisco, who moved that
the six members who had been dropped
for the non-payment of assessments be
given until the next meeting to show
cause why they had not paid up in cash
or, in lieu of money, rendered the party
valuable service. This was opposed by
McNab. who was in favor of making
their dismissal final. Sammy Braunhart
arrayed himself on the side of McNab,
and "it at once became evident that here
was the first of the questions selected as
the excuse for a trial of strength be
tween the warring factions. The issue
was not left long in doubt. Governor
liudil and Major Harney came to the
support of Brobeck, with the result that
the whole matter was referred to the
Committee for the Good of the Party.
This was victory- No. 1.
John W. Mitchell then offered the fol
lowing resolution:
Resolved, That the time and place for holding
the State Convention be determined at a spe
cial meeting for this purpose, to be called by
tho chair; that the call for the said meeting
riMttry the members of the committee that at
this said rm-etlng of the committee this action
will be takr-n; that all localities desiring the
convention be and are hereby invited to send
representatives to this meeting to present the
claims and proposals of their localities.
Resolved further. That a special committee
of five members of this committee be author
ized to cnfer with representatives of the Pop
ulist and Silver Republican parties, with the
view of obtaining a concert of action as to
the time and place of holding the State con
ventions of the said parties.
Cassin, Ostrom and Deuprey opposed
tho resolution or. the ground that the part
that related to the Populist and Silver Re
publican parties appeared to be a fusion
proposition. Governor Budd wanted to
know if the Democratic party had ever
been able to carry the State without the
aid of the Populists and the Independent
Republicans. Chairman Alford surren
dered the gavel in order to take the floor
in support of the resolution. When the
question was finally put the resolution
was adopted. Here was victory No. 2.
Frank H. Gould called attention to the
fact that many county conventions would
be held before the State convention. In
order to settle all doubts a-s to the basis
of representation he offered the follow
ing resolution, which was adopted:
Resolved, That the basis of representation
in the next Democratic State Convention be
llxed at one for each county and one for each
200 votes cast for William J. Bryan at the
last general election.
McGee then offered the following:
Whereas, At the meeting of the Democratic
State Central Committee held two years ago
for the purpose of Issuing the call for the
State Convention, the time of the committee
was consumed in the consideration of the dis
agreements of the San Francisco Democracy,
then in a disorganized and disrupted condi
tion, and In determining which of rival claim
ants should receive the recognition of the State
Committee, and
Whereas, It is claimed that the same con
ditions which confronted the State Committee
two years ago again prevail in San Francisco,
and the same Issues will have to be determined
by the committee; therefore, be it
Resolved, That the chairman of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee Is hereby au
thorized and Instructed to appoint a commit
tee of seven members of the committee who
are therehv authorized. Instructed and em
powered to investigate the conditions of the
San Francisco Democracy, and to report to the
Btata Committee at Kb next meeting with a
recommendation as to what should be the
action of the committee.
As this was conceded to be the real fight
of the day as far as the local factions
were concerned. It was deckled to take
a recess until 2:30 o'clock, in order to give
both sides time to bring up their reserves
and arrange the order of battle. When the
committee reconvened there was some
preliminary skirmishing, and then the
first big gun was fired by the Governor,
who announced that he could not see the
necessity of the appointment of another
committee when It would be the simplest
matter In the world to refer the matter
to the Committee for the Good of the
Party A motion to lay the resolution on
the table was lost. A motion was then
made to refer the subject matter of the
resolution to the Committee for the Good
of the Party. This was ably seconded by
Major Harney. who confessed to a feeiing
of modest pride because of the fact that
he is the chairman of the local committee
representing the "true and only Demo
cratic party of San Francisco."" McNab
and Braunhart threw themselves Into the
breach, but the tide of battle was too
strong for them, and after an exchange
of personalities the question was put and
the motion was carried by an overwhelm
ing majority. This ended the fun. and
the committee adjourned to meet on the
last Saturday in May.
RACING SEASON SIXTY DAYS.
Supervisors' Committee Decide Upon
a Report to That Effect.
After being under consideration for
more than two months the period of the
racing season within the city and county
of San Francisco was decided yesterday
by the special committee of the Board
of Supervisors, to whom the matter nad
been referred.
There was under consideration the res
olution offered by Supervisor Clinton fix
ing tho neriod at forty-eight days. H. j.
Crocker appeared before the committee
on behalf of the Pacific Jockey Club and
argued for an extension of the season.
He declared that the club was in favor
of the abolition of the poolrooms, but
did not think that a short season of rac
ing in this city would have the effect of
closing them, aa races could be run at
Oakland, San Rafael and other points.
After some further discussion between
the members of the committtee, which
consisted of Supervisors Clinton, Smith
and Rivers, it was decided by a vote of
two to one to extend the racing season
to sixty consecutive days in each year,
exclusive of Sundays. Smith voted
against the resolution, which will be re
ported to the Supervisors on Monday.
NO KLONDIKE FOR HIM.
Thomas J. Murphy, Driver of a
Brewery Wagon, Meets With
a Misfortune.
Thomas J. Murphy, the driver of a
wagon for the Jackson Brewery, met with
a serious accident yesterday morning. He
had driven his team to a saloon at Eighth
and Market streets, and after delivering
his beer .lumped on the wagon. His whip
fell to the ground, and in doing so struck
one of the horses, and the team started
off. Murphy, in attempting to jump on
his seat, slipped and fell, his right leg
extending under the wheels, which passed
over It.
The team ran as far as Market and Mc-
Allister streets, where it was stopped.
Murphy was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital, where Dr. Well found that he had
sustained a compound comminuted frac
ture of the leg. Murphy had made prepa
rations to leave soon for the Klondike, as
he was the winner of the first prize in thu
Post's contest.

SOCIETY AND THE STAGE.
Both Well Represented at the Benefit
for the Eye and Ear Hospital.
Society and the Stape joined hands last
evening at thf residence of Mrs. R. Jen
ning for the purpose of devoting their
talent towards increasing the fund for
the erection of a new ward at the Cali
fornia Eye and Ear Hospital on Sutter
street.
If numbers count the object in view is
to be shortly realized, as the entertain
ment was a success in this particular, as
in many others. The exact amount real
ized on the venture ia not as yet definite
ly known, but it is calculated that many
v. golden eagle passed into the hands of
the doorkeeper.
The programme consisted of a little of
everything .from a theatrical standpoint.
and way of amusement, and many pro
fessional actors were seen to good advan
tage in original sketches. The Tivoli
Opera House was well represented in
Edwin Stevens and Miss Edith Hall, and
others who endeavored to keep up their
reputations as fun makers off as well us
on the stage. . .
The programme was as follows: btring
solo, by Chinese dressed in native cos
tume; a Shakespearean sketch, E.
Pauhung; Japanese folk song, Miss
Anna Shepherd; Scotch song, "From
Under My Pladie," W. Balnavus; Rus
sian recitation. Mrs. Rennebone; Indian
song Mrs. John Loffley; national and
patriotic airs, Alfred Wilkic accompa
nist Miss May Moroney; Hawaiian na
tive' solo, Mrs. Turner; Spanish Sere
nade M. Y. Ferrer; original sketch, Ed
win Stevens, assisted oy Madame Mon
tague- Scotch songs, Mrs. Van Brunt,
assisted by Miss Henry; German spe
cialties Miss Edith Hall; Irish folk
song. Miss Ella McCluskey.
The parlors were beautifully decorated
with llags representative of all nations,
evergreens, flowers and exotic growths.
Over the stairway, midway between the
first and second floors, was erected a
magnificent arch composed of a combina
tion of flowers and ferns forming the
letters and spelling the name of the Cal
ifornia Eye and Ear Hospital.
The principal interest in the entertain
ment seemed to center in the Chinese
performers, who received loud and ap
preciative applause for their donations to
the general fund of merriment.
A Small Landslide.
A small landslide occurred yesterday at

The Managers of the Omaha Exposition Are Gathering the Pictures of Forty-five Typical Beauties From AH Over the Western States to Get a Composite Photograph That May Be
FORTY-FIVE nf thÂ« most heauti
fttl women of the West are to mn
tribute a share of their liveliness
to a composite photograph, from
which is to be made the picture of
a woman's fate that is to appear
in bas-relief on the obverse side of the
gold, silver and bronze medals by
which the Omaha Trans- Mississippi and
International Exposition will reward its
exhibitors ;;r,<t commemorate its own
successful existence.
Not one Eastern face will lend tin
grace of its pr< sence to this galaxy of
feminine charms, for the idea la to have
the type pr sent* i of a distinctively
Western character, which, while it will
detract nothing from its beauty, will
add greatly to its value from a strictly
scientific point <â !" view.
The plan of t liÂ« - directors of the ex

whom this demand has been made have
shifted the burden of responsibility
from their own shoulders to those of a
board of judges, thus opening a beauty
competition which lias overwhelmed
each unfortunate present day Paris
â with tidal waves of photographs
and troubles innumerable. Others
have risen to the occasion and,
without fear or favor, have
themselves selected the specimens
of fr-minine loveliness which they
thought best Btted to 1i!l the require
ments of the unique Id* a. ..
To this latter class belongs R. Hall

high type of beauty, and each holding
rank as a social leader, and identified â¢
with one of the most -prominent fami
lies of the place.
Judge Neville of North Platte, Nebr.,
is also self-poised and courageous, and
has decided without any o.utside assist
ance that the charming Miss Maye

cinating .Miss Nettie Harmer of "Syra

the distinction which is hers.

has come near to drowning them. Pho
tographs of every imaginable type of
feminine loveliness and unloveliness
have poured in upon them, accompa
nied, in many cases, by letters from
male relatives or friends which were
either wheedling, or threatening, or
both.
One State Commissioner sent in a
picture by the next mail after he re
ceived the directors' request. It proved
to be that of a decidedly ugly and ma
ture person, with no claims whatever
to Consideration from the noint of view
of a "beauty contest," and the direc
tors felt sure that " mistake had been
made by the sender, who had doubt
less inclosed the wrong photograph in
the hurry of sending off his mail.
A letter embodying this idea was
written him by the secretary, and
brought a response that no mistake
whatever had occurred, but that in the
Commissioner's estimation the lady
was by all odds the handsomest woman
in the State. So remarkable did this
seem that a little pains was taken to
find out additional particulars in snch
a peculiar case of "beauty blindness,"
and the whole matter was satisfactor
ily explained by the discovery that the
lady was the affianced wife of the loy
ally prejudiced gentleman.
Over in Nevada, where . pretty girls
are delightfully numerous. Colonel H.
B. Maxson has originated a plan which
gives to each county a proportionate
chance of supplying the ultimate com
posite of the medal with some portion
of its loveliness. In all Navada will
send forty-seven photographs of her
beauties to Omaha, and the choice of
the most beautiful two will be left to
an impartial individual who lives at a
safe distance from the defeated candi
dates.
One may judge of the interest taken
in the Sagebrush State in this matter
by the fact that in Humboldt County,
â¢where only 823 votes were cast at the
last electioi^ 1351 votes turned, out to
express their very decided opinions on
the important question of wno are the
pettiest two women among the many,
pretty women of that favored county.
In Washoe County the voting was
confined exclusively to the ladies them
selves, and they covered themselves
with glory by their sensible and busi
ness-like way of going about the mat
ter, and the fairness in every sense
of the word of their choice. Miss Ne
vada Ryland, -Miss Sadie and Miss Ada
Phillips of Keno are now publicly pro
claimed by the vote of their generous
sisters the most beautiful girls of
Washoe. and there will be groat dis
appointment if at least one of them is
not selected by the judge to represent
the State in the composite design.
Among the other fascinating daugh
ters of Nevada whose photographs
have been ?Â«>nt in for consideration are
Miss lidith Hunter of Elko, Mifes Anna
Fellows of rniunville and Miss Lillian
Stanton of Winnemucca, each of whom
exemplifies a different type of femin
ine perfection in the way of form,
feature and chevelure, and each of
whom is the admiration of her own
especial part of the State.
As in the case of the first beauty
contest where Venus and Minerva and
Juno appeared before Paris for his de
c:s;on, the pleasant little plan of tho
Exposition directors will undoubtedly
lerve behind it an aftermath of dis
satisfaction and heart-burning, for
every beautiful woman in the Western
States cannot hope to be even men
tioned in the grave deliberations of the
commissioners, and those who are not
will consider or at least iheir friends
will consider that they have good
cause to feel aggrieved.
One thing" is, however, certain and
this is that those who are selected
will be truly representative of the
finest looking women in the trans-Mis
sissippi region, and in every way ex
cellent types of the women of the great
West.18
MAKING GIANT WAR GUNS
Thousands of Men in the Red Glare of the Fur
naces Turning Out Steel Tubes That
Will Shoot Fifteen .Miles.
IN those days of preparation for war
the Washington navy-yard is one
of the most interesting spots to be
found anywhere. Strictly speak
ing, it is not a navy-yard at all, but
a gun factory. Here it is that all
the heavy guns and most of the light
landing and boat guns for the navy art.
built. The amount of work done in this
great national factory is enormous,
even in times of peace, but now that
the lathes, engines and tools are run
ning at full speed twenty-four hours
out of twenty-four, the number of guns
and gun carriages turned out is near
ly trebled.
Passing through the gate with its
trim marine sentry pacing to and fro,
the visitor sees uniformed officers has
tening this way and that, busy with
their duties, and hears on every side
the dull rumble of machinery, the
heavy thud of the triphammer, and the
snorting of the steam cranes. A small
army of draftsmen in the offices are
busily preparing plans and drawings
for the use of the gun builders, and
the civilian bosses and foremen of the
shops are everywhere keeping watch
with eagle eyes. Theirs is a most re
sponsible duty, for any careless and in
competent workman with a single slip
of his tool might spoil a gun or car
riage which had cost the Government
thousands of dollars to put together.
The putting together or "assembling"
of a modern gun is apparently a simple
matter. P.ut it is really one of the most
delicate operations in the world. The
greatest care and precision are neces
cary to make the different parts exactly
fit, and on 1 re/plution too many of a
plane or boring tool would injure the
part beyond repair. Hence comes much
of the fascinati n in watching the con
struction of one of the big guns as it
grows in massive and polished beauty
ready to take its place on one of our
men-of-war.
First of all the tube of the piece
comes to the factory from one of the
big steel companies, the Bethlehem or
the Mldvale, which have the contracts
to furnish forgings. The tube comes In
the rough with only a core bored out.
and looks like a heavy piece of steel
pipe. For the four-inch guns it is 13
feet 7 Inches long, while for the 13-inch
guns it attains a length of 40 feet. This
tube forms a basis for all "uture opera
tions.
A modern gun is built up by slip
ping upon it a number of jackets and
hoops, and shrinking them t<> a perfect
adjustment. A 13-inch gun when fin
ished, has thirteen separate and dis
tinct parts which have been assembled
and fitted to the minutest fraction of an
inch. As the caliber and size of the
gun diminishes the number of parts Is
reduced, and the four-inch piece is
composed of <>nly five.
In building up the gun the rough tube
and the bands are first placed in lathes
and car. fully planed down to the di
mensions required. The diameter of
the interior of the jacket which is to
slip over th^ tube half way its length
must correspond with mathematical ex
actness to the diameter ' the tube's
exterior; while the hoops, which in turn
fit over this jacket, must be treated
with a like precision.
This work of planing is clone *in the
gnat north gun shop, as it is known at
the navy yard, and when it is com
pleted, the tube and the bands have to
be carried to the "shrinking pit" at the
north end of the shop, where the next
process is to be undergone. There are
three heavy traveling cranes in the
shop, of 110, 40 and 15 tons lifting
power, respectively, and they pick
up the huge pieces of iron and carry
them to their destination as easily and
lightly as if they weighed nothing at
all.
The "shrinking pit" is a deep hole
sunk in the floor of the shop, and fitted
at each end with an oven. These ovens,
in which the bands are to be expanded
until they can slip over the gun tube,
are heated by an air and oil blast to a
temperature of TOO degrees Fahrenheit,
for this degree of heat Is necessary to
expand the heavy jacket for the 12 and
13-inch guns. At the pit the tube is
planted carefully on end close to the
oven, in which is being heated the
jacket that it is to receive. Pipes aro
so arranged that a stream of water can
be run continuously through the cnr<Â»
of the tube, to keep it conl and prevent
expansion by the heat, as the hot jacket
slips over it.
"When all is ready, the men who are
to perform the delicate task stand at
attention. Each one of them has his
own particular duty, and they cure
trainer! t>> act in concert, like a com
pany of soldiers. The jacket has been
placed In the oven and sealed up. to
await expansion by the heat. The f'>r<'
man gives the word, the traveling crane
comes up and lifts off the hot lid of the
oven, exposing the jacket within, the
hooks are made fast to a clamp pre
viously attached to the jacket, and th^
heated mass is lifted carefully from its
fiery bed.
The engineer of the crane watches,
â with hawlc-like eyes, the signals of the
foreman below, and when a sufficient
heipht has been reached the jacket is
swung over the tube and lowered. Men
with immense canvas mitten guide it
as it comes down and adjust it in place.
When it has been slipped /er the tube
streams of water are turned on to cool
it. As it cools it shrinks back to its
original size, and the delicate operation
is complete.
Strange as it may seem, after coming
through its fiery ordeal the jacket
hardly shows a sign of heat aB it is
lifted from the oven. There is a slight
bluish tinge, and that is the > nly thing
to distinguish it from the cold jacket
which went in. The exterior o; the tube
and the interior of the jacket being ex
actly the same size, only the slightest
expansion is r quired to make one slip
over the 'ier. From 3-100 to 5-100 of
an inch is all that is allowed, even in
the monster 13-iÂ»- h guns. So the speed
iest and most accurate work is neces
sary after the jacket leaves tv> oven,
for if the iron should cool off before it
was in nlace it would clamp at once
upon the tube, and the gun would be
ruined. A similar process is gone
through with in slipping the smaller
hoops over the jacket.
The shrinking of one part on another
makes an absolutely perfect weld, and
after once the band is in place nothing
short of chipping it off piece by piece
would remove it. The shrinking of the
different bands of the piece having been
finished, it is again put in the lathe and
turned down to the required size, ana
the edges of the bands are beveled oft
to give it a neat appearance. It is then
ready for the delicate operation of ri-
fling.
Only the most experienced mechanics
in the shops are in charge of the rifling
machines, for on the perfection with
which they perform their work the
whole utility of the gun depends. The
auger which cuts the grooves is care
fully adjusted and lubricated, and the
little hard steel chisels fitted on a long
beam which runs through the bore of
the gun commence their work. Only the
smallest fraction of an inch is taken off
at a time, and the greatest care is re
quired in adjusting the auger exactly.
When once put in position the lathe
Coo- the rest of the work by slowly
turning the gun as the tool eats its way
through.
After being rifled the gun is placed
on a car and carried to the breech rua
chanism shop, where the interrupted
screw breech block, in use in early all
the navies of the world, is fitted. The
carriage with its recoil cylinders for
taking up the "kick" of the piece when
fired, having been finished in the navaJ
carriage shop with as conscientious
care as the gun itself, the gun is put
together and shipped on the barge
down the Potomac River to Indian
Head, to be tested.
The guns built at the Washington
navy. yard are recognized- as the
perfect and powerful specimens of na
val ordnance in the world, and the
weight of their powder charge and pro
jectile, their length arl thei penetra
tion would have been considered out
side the bounds reason thirty years
ago. The length of a 13-inch breech
loadii.g rifle is forty feet; its weight
sixty and one-half tons; it carries a
projectile weighing 1100 pounds â more
than half a ton â which can penetrate
steel 23.42 inches thick at a distance of
1500 yards. It has a velocity at the
muzzle of 2100 feet a second, and a ve
locity of 1805 U" â  at a distance of 2500
yards, w'.iich is produced by the explo
sion of 550 pounds of brown prismatic
uowder, each grain of which is oc
tagonal in shL^e and molded to an ex
act size.
The cost of each discharge is about
$1500. The range of a gun of thirteen
inches caliber is about thirteen miles,
or a mile to.each inch, which is the ap
proximate ran^e of all guns. A 13-inch
gun is built to fire 250 shots before it
loses its temper and becoi-.es useless,
except for old iron; but in most cases
many more could probably be fired.
The 1100-pound projectile is almost as
carefully made as the gun. It is of hard
steel, with an armor piercing point and
is fitted with copper bandi which take
against the rilling, and being of soft
metal do not injure the delicate
.groo% - es df which there are fifty-two.
Besides these monster cannon the
Washington navy yard produces small
rapid fire ordnance of the Fletcher,
Maxim, Driggs-Schroeder and Hotch
kiss tj'pps, which are used aboard ship
as a protection against torpedo boats,
for landii.g parties and for boat service.
These weapons are much simpler in
their construction than the heavy ord
nance, but the same great care and
thoroughness of workmanship charac
terize their building as the heavy ord
nance.
Six weeks is practically the minimum
of time for the making of a modern
gun, and to finish one within that space
everything would have to go on mar
velously well. The "treatment" of the
steel would have to be a success at j
the very first attempt â something that
does not often happen â and the first
tests would have to show that the Gov
ernment standard had been reached.
Oftener than otherwise these results
can only be obtained through much try
ing and the expenditure of time. A
batch of guns may thus take months in
the making, while good luck may bring
it down to weeks.
It is in the casting shop, of course,
that the process of gun making h?.s its
very beginning, in the furnace where
steel is made from a medley of pieces
of old iron, pig iron lengths, broken
bits and odds and ends of castings, long
since relegated to the scrap yards.
Here is the first stage of the modern
gun â ragged and rusty metal that is
carted in wheelbarrows up to the fur
nace doors. The maws of blazing heat,
several thousand degrees in intensity,
stands open to receive it. So over
whelming is this heat that even the
master melter has to put on blue
glasses to peer into the flames rising
over the bubbling sea of metal when
the doors are open. When the doors
are dropped down â that is, shut â there
is only revealed a single spot of bright
ness, an eye that Jooks into the fur
nace's flame, and even this cannot be
approached too closely with the naked
eye.
The gun is under way. Ten tons of
metal are already in the furnace â a
lake of molten, seething metal held in
by banks of sand. Other things of
steel are to be made of this mass, the
gun works being only a portion of the
plant. Whether used for peace or war,
steel is steel, differing only in qual
ity. It is all "boiled down" in the
same way.
In shadow is the casting shop, except
when the doors are raised, when a flood
of light, a wave of extreme heat, is
thrown out. In the dusk of the
shadows grimy men raise the sea of
metal with long bars. The master mel
ter, never still, steps now and then to
his wheels, set at one side of the fur
nace and looking like the brake wheels
on a freight car, and gives one or the
other a sharp twist. By this he regu
lates his fire â five hundred degrees at
a twist. The silica bricks with which
the furnace is lined can stand four

thousand degrees of heat and more be
fore they commence to melt. The mas
ter melter runs up the heat to the ex
treme point and then lets it down.
There are three "heats" a day in the
casting shop. Three times metal is
heated, three times it is let go with a
mighty rush into the casting pot. The
last few moments of each heat are the
dramatic instants. It is then, at the
judgment of the master melter, that
the furnace is fed with "medicine,"

shovelfuls and blocks of metal being
tossed in. On this depends the qual
ity, the strength, the elasticity of the
steel, essentials of the most vast Im
portance of the gun of to-day.
Two hours is usually sufficient for the
boiling of this steel In its cradle of
sand. At last the one moment ar
rives. The bar at the furnace's back
is worked through the sand to make
an opening. An instant, and into the
casting pot below the mass runs, scat
i tering millions of sparks, a glowing,
I golden torrent that foams and hisses
I as it plunges down.
The picture of the gun's second stage
!is superb. On every hand fly these
S sparks, and the mass bubbles and
i seethes in the casting pot. On its top,
! through the glow, can be seen a dirty
I mass â the slag or the scum that is of
|no use or value. But the picturesque
! ness of the scene has not ended. The
j casting process is only half through.
| The liquid metal must get into its
molds, and that in short order.
On a track the casting pot rests. It
I is pushed along this track until a gi-
I gantic crane overhead seizes it, swing-
I ing it aloft. Over mounds of sand it
is swung, and the metal, by the move
ment of a bar, is allowed to drop down
jin a thin stream. Again shower upon
shower of sparks, surrounding the men
who, with chains and staves, control
the clumsy pot and pull along the
j crane. The grim old shop, with Its
floor of sand, its unrelenting dust and
; its dreariness, is made into a brilliant
! cavern for the moment, and the toil
; ing men are supernatural in the light.
A prosaic time follows, when the
I metal in the molds must cool. When
j the sand is finally knocked away the
I gun that is to be is only a rough mass
iof cast steel, indicating only to the
I expert its fine quality, and not even
to him in any degree, for the tests
must come to prove that. In the forg
ing shop this mass is hammered and
worked until it becomes an octagonal
ingot of just twice the weight it will
possess when it is finally turned and
bored into a "jacket" or "tube." The
hoc.ps. the third part of a gun, are
cast and forged hollow, not in solid
cylinders, as the jacket and tubes ara.
With the carrying away of the rough
ingot of steel from the forging shop
the special work of gun making comm
ences. The boring and turning fac
tory is the Bcene of the first step in
this process.
Completed suns, ready for mounting
and for fire, are not turned out in these,
gun shops. The finishing touches, the
actual puttinu together Of the parts of
the gun, the rilling itself, are done at
the ordnance works in Washington. It
is the business alone "f a gun shop to

army and the navy the three parts

HOW NATIONS
DECLARE WAR.
NOTWITHSTANDING the fact
that most people consider a for
mal declaration of war necessa
ry before active measures can
be taken it is usually the case
in these go-ahead times that no
Warning whatever is given.
When Rome was mistress of the
world a declaration of war was a sol
emn function, attended with so much
ceremony that a special college of her
alds was always kept in readiness to
perform it when necessary. In me
dieval times letters of defiance served
to give warning of hostile intentions,
and still later heralds were sent to
throw down the gantlet and make a
verbal declaration of war*
In such times formal declarations
were necessary to differentiate between
the private br Is of a f^v barons and
a national war for which the commu
nity was responsiblf . but at the pres
ent day total concealment as long as
possible is the most universal rule. The
objects, says the writer in Tid-Bits,
of this are usual'" either to anticipate
the designs of some other power, to
avoid the onus of admitting a state of
war as long as possible, or to gain time
by swiftness of attack.
The latest instances of formal decla
ration by herald were in 1635. when
Louis 3^,111 sent a herald to declare
war against Spain, and in 1657 when
Sweden declared â  r against Denmark
by herald sent to Copenhagen; while as
late as 1671 war between England and
Holland was declared by solemn proc
lamation.
As the most recent cases are those
likely to intluence the conduct of na
tions in the immediate future, the wars
of the present century are of the great
est interest at the present crisis.
In the quarrel between Russia and
Turkey which immediately preceded
the Crimean War, a formal declaration
was issued at Moscow by proclamation
of the Czar, and three days later, after
the Turks were well aware of the state
of affairs^ operations were commenced
in earnest.
In the cases of Britain and France
less consideration was shown. War
was formally declared by Britain on
March 22, 1854, and on the 31st it was
proclaimed by the High Sheriff of Lon
don from the steps of the Exchange.
But these declarations were made
merely to justify the step to the peo
ple and to ask for their approval and
help. Before that- time active opera
tions had commenced by the entry of
the British and French fleets into the
Dardanelles, contrary to treaty, and
the forced retreat of the Russian fleet,
to Sebastopol when the allies reached
the Black Sea.
On February 8 the Russian Minister
was withdrawn from London, and the
British and French Ministers from St.
Petersburg. Although such a step us
ually precedes war, and is often regard
ed as equivalent to a declaration.it only
signifies that all hope of successful dip
lomatic negotiation has been abandoned
and that war is likely to ensue. It does
not necessarily imply a st^ate of war,
such a state requiring some definite act
of hostility.
In the opium war of 1840, the Italian
wars of 1847 and 1849. the Anglo-Persian
war of 1856, the wars between Austria
and France in 1859, Prussia and Schles
wig-Holstein in 1863 and Brazil and
Uruguay in 1864, various hostile acts
were committed before any declaration
of war was made, although in some
cases manifestoes were issued to neu
tral powers. In the Austro-Italian war
of 1859, the Austro-Prussian war of 1566
and the Russo-Turkish war of 1877 the
declaration and active operations were
practically synonymous. In the last
mentioned case, for example, the Porte
received a co*"'of the declaration on the
evening of April 24, the very day on
which 50,000 Russian troops crossed the
Roumanian frontier.
The most notable instance in the pres
ent century of a formal declaration of
war being made before actual opera

forced, as the French, who wore UUs
aggressors, voted large war credits <
July 15, and on the following day th
French Minister returned to Paris. A
formal intimation of hostile intentions
was then sent to Berlin and laid before
the Parliament of the North German
Confederation on July 20.
On November 12, 1885, Britain was
honored by a declaration of war from
King Theebaw of Burmah, but it was
a needless formality o-n the part of his
dusky Majesty, for the British troops
were already on the way to his capital,
and the only reply to his challenge was
his deposition, which immediately en
sued.
THE ORLOFF DIAMOND.
At the beginning of the eighteenth
century a soldier belonging to one of
the French garrisons in India became
enamored of the eyes of Brahma in
the Temple of the Serringham. These
eyes were diamonds, more brilliant
than ever shone under the eyebrows of
Crapaud'a European divinities. Their
luster captivated his soul. He haunt
ed the temple and yielding to the might
of the god became a convert to his
worship. At least so he persuaded the
priests, who went so far as to admit
him to some care of the temple, doubt
less trusting Brahma to protect his
own. But on a stormy night the con
vert disappeared and with him one of
the idol's eyes, the other having resist
ed all his "efforts to dislodge it. So
Brahma was left squinting, and the
perfidious Frenchman sold his prize to
a captain in the English navy for about
$10,000.
Later it was bought by the Armenian
merchant Schaffras for more than five
times this sum. and was shown by him
to Catharine of Rups:;i. who offered for
it about $400,000, a life pension of $18,000
and a patent of nobility. Schaffras re
fused this offer and subsequently sold
the diamond to Gregory Orloff for the

<h^u!K'd as a man and working among men.
WHY did I di^uiso myself
as a man and work among
men?" repeated Miss War

pimple I'm afraid you will
nut think much of It.
"To begin at the beginning, 1 am a
ountry girl, born â well, it doesn't mat
er where, but for some time I have
lad to struggle for myself. Pretty
hard it was, too, to learn 'the photo

"After thinking the matter over care
fully 1 decided that trousers would be
of more use to me than skirts in niv

home to don them.
"There was another reason, too. You
see, I am a very independent girl and
liked to earn my own bread. Well.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APEIL 17, 1898.
there was another, a man, who fancied
that women were not fit to do that sort
of thing, and wanted me to marry him
and settle down and be comfortable.
Unfortunately we did not agree on that
point. He vowed that he would fol
low me, and so, to throw him off the
track, I decided to do what I had so
long planned; that is, to disappear as
a woman and appear as a plain, every
day working man, trying to 'earn a
living.
"When I reached the city I stopped
at a good hotel, and I tell you it eat
into my slim little purse, too. I then
went to a clothiers and ordered a suit
of clothes sent to my rooms for my
young cousin, Mr. John Warren.
"I then went to a lodging-house
cheap, but clean, and secured rooms for
the same young- man.
"The next night I packed my satchel
and left the hotel, and next morning I
hopped out of my room and into the
world as Mr. John Warren.
"How did it feel? Oh, it was awful
"I fancied every one was staring at
me and I felt like bolting into the first
friendly doorway that offered its shel
ter.
"My heart beat like a trip-hammer
every time I came near a policeman
and I finally hit upon the plan of cross
ing in the middle of the streets to evacU
them.
"At last I mustered up courage to go
to Mr. Fowzer.
" 'Jt/hn, brace up and be a man,' I
said to myself. "But in spite of my
best efforts it was only after two or
three attempts that I pulled myself to
gether and ventured into his office.
"Lord heavens, how I quaked and
trembled in my shoes when I had to
face a real man, and what was worse,
talk to him.
"However, after a few inward quakes
I managed to tell him what I wanted
and he kindly said that he would let
me come.
"For a long time after that every
thing was quiet. No one seemed to
suspect me and I began to feel com
fortable. I liked my suit of clothes
best on rainy days, no skirts to pick
ud and to eet draereled In the mud.
"Ah, yes, I was supremely happy in
those days. I felt immensely superior
to the rest of my sex.
"My <me source of annoyance was the
fact that my hair would grow too fast,
and finally it got so bad that the hor
rible fear began to dawn on me that I
i would have to go to a barber and have
it cut.
"Well, I went. Of course the barber
asked me if I wanted a shave. It's a
regulation question with them.
"I said no rather too emphatically, I
thought, for the barber stared hard at
me for a second and then set to work
on my hair.
" 'Why, what soft hair you have,' he
said, 'it's just like a woman's.'
"I nearly fainted, but managed to
mutter that I had often been told so.
"When I got out of his shop, like the
man on the Bowery, I resolved 'To
never go there anymore.'
"Mr. Fowzer has no doubt told you
about the theater invitations that
caused me so- much mental worry and
: anguish.
"It was this way. I make friends
easily, and soon after I came here the
| folks round here asked me to go out
with them. I escaped whenever I could,
but one time they caught me. Mr.
Fowzer had asked me to come to the
house and make one of a card party. I
thought that it would be all right, so I
consented.
"We had no sooner started when a
nephew of Mr. Fowzer's came in with
a box for the theater. Mrs. Fowzer
could not go, and I said that I would
rattier stay home with her. Seeing,
however, that I could no-t do that with
out attracting surprised attention, I re
luctantly consented to go.
"If you can imagine how I felt sitting
in the front of a box with three men,
you will know that the feeling was
anything but a jolly one.
"Between one of the acts one of the
party suggested something to refresh
the inner man, as he expressed it,
though 1 was thinking of the woman all
the while.
"I did my very best to escape the in
vitation, but only succeeded in making
! my position worse by refusing to go.
i Finally I saw that the easiest way to
get out of it was to go to the bar with
them and make a show of drinking.
"Oh, if my family could have seen
me. We filed into the bar and they
: called for beer.
"I was too wretched to do anything
! but nod my head when the> asked me
if I'd have the same!
"Have you ever seen one of the
dreadful things they call 'schooners of
steam beer?'
"It looked as large as a house to me.
If the earth could only have opened
| and swallowed me I would have been
\ happy. But the earth refused to do
I it. and still I stood desnaJrinerlv look
ing at the mountain of foam.
" 'Come, John, drink it. we haven't
much time; we don't wish to miss the
next act,' said Mr. Fowzer, and I
started in on that dreadful tower of
beer.
"Well. I got it down, and I can tell
you right here that it was the first and
last one I shall ever touch or anything !
that looks like it.
"When I got home that night I re- j
solved that my disguise would have to !
be dropped. I wouldn't take the risk
of having to drink that dreadful steam
beer again. I felt, too, that I had won
my way as a worker and that I could â 
make a living as a woman.
"So in a day or so I walked Into the j
gallery in my own clothes.
"You should have seen them stare.
"The -little boy snoke first. 'Why,
what is Mr. Warden 'loing in woman's
clothes, mamma?' he shouted, and then
I was deluged by a perfect flood of
questions.
"I explained things to them and ever
since then I have been here doing the
same work that I always did and find
HOW TO SUCCEED AS AN ORATOR.
WHAT advice would I give to
a young man ambitious to
become a successful public
speaker or orator?
In the first place I would
advise him to have some
thing to say â something worth saying
â something that people would be glad
to hear. This is the important thing.
Back of the art of speaking must be
the power to think. Without thoughts
i words are empty purses. Most people
i imagine that almost any words, uttered
in a loud voice and accompanied by ap
propriate gesture, constitute an ora
tion. I would advise the young man
| to study his subject, to find what others
j had thought, to look at it from all
sides.
Then I would tell him to write out
his thoughts or to arrange them in his
mind, so that he would know exactly
what he was going to say. Waste no
time on the how, until you are satisfied
with the what.
After you know what you are to say,
then you can think of how it should
be said. Then you can think about
tone, emphasis and gesture: but if you
really understand what you say, em
phasis, tone and gesture will take care
of themselves. All these should come
from the inside. They should be In
perfect harmony ",-ith the feelings.
Voice and gesture should be governed
by the emotions. They should uncon
sciously be in perfect agreement with
the sentiments. The orator should be
true to his subject, should avoid any
reference to himself.
The great column of his argument
should bt> unbroken. He can adorn it
with vines and flowers, but they should
not be in such profusion as to hide the
column. He should give variety of epi
sode by illustrations, but they should be
used only for the purpose of adding
strength to the argument.
The man who wishes to become an
orator should study language. He
should know the deeper meaning or
words. He should understand the vigor
and velocity of verbs and the color of
adjectives. He should know how to
sketch a scene, to paint a picture, to
give life and action. He should be a
poet and a dramatist, a painter and an
actor. He should cultivate his imagi
nation. He should become familiar with
the great poetry and fiction, with splen
did and heroic deeds. He should be a
student of Shakespeare. He should read
and devour the great plays. From
Shakespeare he could learn the art of
expression, of compression, and all the
secrets of the head and heart.
The great orator is full of variety â
of surprises. Like a juggler he keeps
the colored balls in the, air. He ex
presses himself in pictures. His speech
is a panorama. By continued change
he holds the attention. The interest
does not flag. He does not allow him-
that I like my own clothes much better
than the ones I adopted.
"I didn't find much difference in the
treatment I received from either men
or women, but I like my own clothes
best, and I never will try to be a man
again.
"You see, I thought it would not only
be easier to get around, but I thought
it would be cheaper; that a man could
get lodging in cheap places where a
woman would not care to go.
"I discovered, however, that it did
not make so much difference.
"Altogether I find that you can get
along in the world, be you either man
or woman, and I think it best not to try
and be an imitation of the opposite sex,
for you are sure to wish that you
hadn't before you get through.
"I shall probably leave here before
long. My course is almost completed
and I shall want to set up for myself.
"No, I shall riot open a gallery here.
I will go into some small place.
"Will I go as a man? Never again.
Stick to your own sex, that's what my
experience has taught me."
By Robert G. Ingersoll.
self to be anticipated. He is always in
advance. He does not repeat himself.
A picture is shown but once. So, an
orator should avoid the commonplace.
There should be no stuffing, no filling.
He should put no cotton with his silk,
no common metals with his gold. He
should remember that "gilded dust is
not as good as dusted gold." The great
orator is honest, sincere. He does not
pretend. His brain and heart go to
gether. Every drop of his blood is con
vinced. Nothing is forced. He knows
exactly what he wishes to doâ knows
when he has finished it, and stops.
Only a great orator knows when and
how to close. Most speakers go on
after they are through. They are sat
isfied only with a "lame and impotent
conclusion." Most speakers lack va
riety. They travel a straight and dusty
road. The great orator is full of epi
sode. He convinces and charms by in
direction. He leaves the road, visits
the fields, wanders in the woods, listens
to the murmurs of springs, the songs
of birds. He gathers flowers, scales the
crags and comes back to the highway
refreshed, invigorated. He does not
move in a straight line. He wanders
and winds like a stream.
Of course no one can tell a man what
to do to become ~n orator. The great
orator has that wonderful thing called
presence. He has the strange some
thing known as magnetism. He must
have a flexible, musical voice, capable
of expressing the pathetic, the humor
ous, the heroic. His body must move in
unison with his thought. He must be
a reasoner, a logician. He must have
a keen sense of humor â of the laugh
able. He must have wit, sharp and
quick. He must have sympathy. His
smiles should be the neighbors of his
tears. He must have imagination. He
should give eagles to the air. and
painted moths should flutter In the sun
light.
While I cannot tell a man what to do
to become an orator, I can tell him a
fe-.' things not to do.
There should be no introduction to an
oration. The orator should commence
with his subject. There should be no
prelude, no flourish, no apology, no ex
planation. He should say nothing
about himself. Like a sculptor he
stands by his block of stone. Every
stroke is for a purpose.
As he works the form begins to ap
pear. When the statue is finished, the
workman stops. Nothing is more diffi
cult than a perfect close. Few poems,
few pieces of music, few novels end
well. A good story, a great speech, a
perfect poem should end just at the
proper point. The bud, the blossom,
the fruit. No delay. A great speech is
a crystallization in Its logic, an efflor
escence in its poetry.
To tell the truth, I have not
heard many speeches. Most of the
great speakers in our country were be
fore my time. I heard Beecher. and he
was an orator. He had imagination,
humor and intensity. His brain was
fertile as the valleys of the iropl-s.
He was too broad, too philosophic, too
poetic for the pulpit.
"Miss Warren carried out her part as
a young chap earning a living ex
tremely well," said Mr. Fowzer. "None
of us in the gallery here had the slight
est suspicion that John Warden was
anything but a real, up-to-date man,
entitled to wear men's clothes and
work among men as a man. That's
the reason we invited him. or rather
her, to the theater party. Warden was
somewhat shy, but we attributed that
to youth and natural diffidence.
"When we look back at what hap
pened at the theater party it all seems
funny enough now. Warden seemed ap
palled at the size of the schooner of
beer. We noticed it. but we men were
all thinking about the play and about
getting back to our seats, so outside of
'joshing' him, or rather her, a bit we
did not make anything out of it.
"Togged out in her man's clothes she
seemed just like any other young felc
low, only, as I said, retiring and quiet.
"If you ask the men in the gallery I
guess they'll tell you she makes more
of a hit in woman's clothes than in
man's."
Xow and then he broke the fetters
! of his creed, escaped from his orthodox
j prison and became sublime.
Theodore Parker was an orator. He
preached great sermons. His sermons
: on "Old Age" and "Webster," and his
: address on "Liberty" were filled with
'â¢â  great thoughts, marvelously exprer.s
ed. When he dealt with human events,
i with realities, with things he knew, he
i was superb. When he spoke of free
' dom, of duty, of living to the ideal, of
! mental integrity, he seemed inspired.
W r ebster I never heard. He had
| great qualities; force, "dignity, clf-ar
[ ness, grandeur: but, after all, he wor
| shiped the past. He kept his back
Ito the sunrise. There was no dawn in
! his brain. He was not creative. He
i had no spirit of prophecy. He lighted
'no torch. He was not true to his ideal.
IHe talked sometimes as though his
i head was among the stars, but he stood
in the gutter.
Clay I never heard, but he must have
had a commanding presence, a chival-
I ric bearing, a heroic voice. He cared
i little for the past. He was a natural
! leader, a wonderful talkerâ forcible.
] persuasive, convincing. He was not a
j poet, not a master of metaphor, but he
< was practical. He kept in view the
j end to be accomplished. He was the
! opposite of Webster. Clay was the
â  morning, Webster the evening. Clay
had large views, a wide horizon. He
was ample, vigorous and a little tyran
: nical.
Benton was thoroughly common
place. He never uttered an inspired
word. He was an intense egotist. No
subject was great enough to make him
forget himself. Calhoun was a politi
cal Calvinist â narrow, logical, dog
matic. He was not an orator. He de
livered essays, not orations.
S. S. Prentiss was an orator, but,
with the recklessness of a gamester, he
threw his life away. He said profound
and beautiful things, but he lacked ap
plication. He was dispropor
ticned â saying ordinary things on great
occasions, and now and then, without
the slightest provocation, uttering the
sublimest and most beautiful thoughts.
Lincoln had reason, wonderful humor
and wit. but his presence was not good.
His voice was poor, his gestures awk
ward â but his thr.-ughts were profound.
His speech at Gettysburg is one of the
masterpieces of the world. The word
"here" is used four or five times too
often. Leave the heres out and the
speech is perfect.
Of course I have heard a great many
talkers, but orators are few and far
between. They are produced by vic
torious nationsâ born in the midst of
great events, of marvelous achieve
ments. They utter the thoughts, the
aspirations of their age. They clothe
the children of the people in the
gorgeous robes of genius. They inter
pret the dreams. With the poets, they
prophesy. They fill the future with
heroic forms, with lofty deeds. They
keep their faces toward the dawnâ
toward the ever-coming day.

HOW THE BIG PARIS EXPOSITION OF 1900 WILL LOOK.
IT is not too soon to sÂ«p"ulate
upon just what part the United
States will play in the coming
Paris Exposition of 1900. The Call
is enabled to give a forecast of
tli" plans in so far as they had
been perfected by the special commis
sioner, the late Moses P. Handy, as em
bodied in an advance copy of the Pres
ident's message to < 'ongress.
From this document it is shown that
the prospects for an adequate American
exhibit are ver* bright, considering the
delay in the initial arrangements. The
messauv recommends an appropriation
of 5&7H. 600. In dealing with this the
President says:
"In view of the magnitude and
importance <>f the approaching ex
position and of our standing
among the nations which will be
there represented, and in view also
of our Increased population and ac
knowledged progress in arts, s<-i
ence and manufactures, I earnestly
commend the report of Major Han
dy to your consideration and trust
that a liberal appropriation may be
made. Moreover, the magnificent
exhibit oi ill.' French Uoverntnerit
at Chicago in 1893, on which $1,000,
000 was expended, should be a
strong incentive to reciprocal liber
ality on the part of the Government
of " the United States, and
suggests to our citizens the
necessity as well as the pro
priety of installing at the Paris
Exhibition an exhibit oil a- par with
that of the Government and people
of France at Chicago, and in keep
ing with the scope and extent of
the preparations which are being
made by nearly all the important
nations <<f the earth for theft" pro.
posed exhibits in that exposition."
Major Handy's report is full of meat.
He describes in detail the eventually
successful struggle for appropriate
space, and how the space will be al
lotted. He gives comparisons based
upon past expositions, and throws out
many valuable hints to prospective ex
hibitors. The space originally reserved
for the United States was little more
than that awarded in ISS9.
The following table shows the total
allotment of space:
Total Allot
ment.
Departmentâ Square Feet.

Tot al 147, 403
â¢ Allotment not yet made.
To form a fair judgment as to the
equity of this allotment it is essential
to recall the superficial areas of the
several universal expositions that have
been held in Paris since 1867. The ex
position of that y< ar occupied L 62 acres;
that of istx, 187 acres, and that of 1889,
240 acres, while the space at present
available for that of 1900 is about 336
acres. The full extent of the allotment
of the United States is not fully set
forth in the above table, there being
no allotment it will be observed, in the
departments of fine arts. Horticulture,
forestry, chase and fisheries, social
economy and hygiene, colonization and
army and navy.
The vexed question of classification
lias been profoundly studied in all its
aspects by M. Picard, the commissary
general,, and by the superior commis
sion. The difficulties, in fact the. utter
impossibility, of devising a scheme of
claasilication absolutely logical and en
tirely free from practical disadvantages
were fully recognized. The commission
examined with great care. the classifi
cations of all the international expo
sitions of the past, both in France and
other countries, and considered fully
the various criticisms to which they
have been subjected in the light of the
actual results achieved.
For the classification at the approach
ing exposition, that of lKh9 i.s taken a.s
a point of departure, and such moditi
cations have been made as were sug
gested by the legitimate criticisms of
which it was the object, and by the
lessons taught by foreign expositions.
The post of honor is occupied by edu
cation, "the channel by which man en
ters into life, the source of all pro
gress." Next come the works of art,
and the third place is assigned to the
lnstru t m t en,ts and^ general processes of
â¢letters, science and arts. Then come
'â¢the great factors of contemporary pro
duction, the most Powerful agents of
industrial achievement at the end or
the nineteenth century"-"* 'ferial
and general processes of mechan cs
electricity civil engineering, methods
of transportation. Next follow the ex
ploitation and the products .superficial
or subterranean, of the earth-agricul
ture, horticulture, forestry, the chase,
fisheries, placer mining, food stuffs
mines and metallurgy.- Next m order
are decorations and furnishing of pub
lic buildings and habitations, threads, -
yarns tissues, textile fabrics, wearing
apparel chemical industries, various
manufactures-. - ."Social .economy, -to.
which have been reserved the develop
ments worthy of its actual role, follows
naturally the various branches of artis
tic agricultural and industrial produc- j
tlon." It will embrace also hygiene and
public or organized charity.
â¢ The interest in the exposition shown
by Americans seems: to be very great.
In his report. Major Handy says: "Ap
plications informally made by individ
ual exhibitors show bona ride demands
for J52,%9 square feet, besides estimat
ed requirements of associated educa
tion, arts and mines to the extent of
125,000 square feet. In other words,
two years before t.ie date fixed for the
opening of the exposition there is a de
mand for more space than was ever
occupied by the United States in any
international exposition on foreign SOIL
These demands emphasize the neces
sity of co-operating with the authori
ties of the exposition in their earnest
determination to make it one of selec
tion. '&*?"'*%Â£
"France sets a good example in re
quiring that all applications for space
shall be passed upon by two juries of
selections, or boards of examiners.
Germany, heartily secondine France's
intentions, proposes also to thoroughly
sift all applications and send to Paris
only those articles which survive the
most careful expert scrutiny. 'Only
products of the first class will be ac-
pted." says Mr. Hichter, the German
Commissioner - General. I strongly
recommend that we follow the same
policy, and would suggest that no
article be shipped to Paris for exhibi
tion until it has passed the most crit
ical scrutiny of the Commissioners or
committees of their appointment.
"My idea would be to have commit
tees for this purpose sit in New York
and Chicago, and perhaps in other
cities, whose duty it shall be not only
to sift exhibits, thoroughly, reiecting
all that are commonplace,. trivial or in
any respect, unworthy, but also to scale
down the space to reasonable dimen
sions in every case. It cannot be tod
thoroughly: understood that in the
coming international exposition the
difficulty will not be to get exhibitors,
i but to moderate the demands of exhib
itors and to- meet in any degree the
requirements, of such exhibits as will
be a credit and honor to thia country."
The propriety of having a special de
partment-for the display of woman's
work, to be installed and managed by
women, has 1 been urged upon the ad
ministrative council of the exposition,
but so far without perceptible effect.
The Midway Plaisance of the World's
Columbian Exposition will have its
counterpart, and the authorities are
busying themselves devising plans or
passing upon those of individuals, for
the amusement of the crowds that will
throng the grounds in 1900. Quaint and
queer customs of the little known na
tions. are to be shown, making it possi
ble for one to See the ends of the earth
without journeying that distance.
Work upon the grounds and buildings
is proceeding rapidly, although with
great care, and there is no doubt that
the exhibits will have been installed
by April 18, 1900, the date set for the
opening of the exposition. The site will
be practically .the same as was occu
pied by the exposition of ISB9, the total
space being 336, acresâ 96 more than
was available for the last exposition.
The area compared with that of the
World's Columbian Exposition of 1593,
which occupied nil of Jackson Park and
the Midway Plaisanee â 740 acres in all
â shows the limitations with which the
officials have to contend. A larger space
might have hi-'-n had in the suburbs,
but the Municipal Council of Paris and
the Council-General of the Seine De
partment strongly opposed all propo
sals to locate any part of the exposition
outside of the city.
The industrial progress of the United
States and the evolution of its material
resources during the hundred years
which the exposition is to crown have
been unequaled by that of any other
Ration. It is not too much to say that

great lines of industry.
MAKING MODELS FOR THE
EXHIBITION BUILDINGS.
NOT the least interesting part of
the Paris Exposition of 1900 will
be the exhibit in exact miniature
on the same general scale and in
their proper relative positions of
all the various buildings which are
comprised in the undertaking, most of
which are already well under way.
The construction of the two new
palaces of fine arts, "Le Petit Palais"
and the "Grand Palais," which are to
be left standing for permanent use, is
now being pushed with feverish activ
ity, as the time allowed for their com
pletion will admit, of no delay.
These two buildings face each other
from opposite sides of the new avenue
leading from the new Pont d'Alexan
dre 111 to the Avenue dcs Champs
Elysees, just west of the Palais de la
Concorde, where is placed the princi
pal entrance to the exposition grounds.
The Petit Palais, after serving Its pur
pose at the exposition, will be devoted
to such permanent and special uses as
are justified by its location and size,
while the "Grand Palais," standing as
it does on the site of the old "Palais de
l'lndustrie," will take the place of that
well known and often crowded struct
ure, receiving each year the crowds
which throng to the horse show, to
the salon and all the fetes, celebra
tions and exhibitions that industry and
art and even politics seek to shelter in
busy Paris.
Any curtailed description of this
building would fail to cou.ey a proper
idea of its magnificence. The fine and
delicate taste displayed by its author,
M. Deglanne, will justly place his name
among the first architects of the age,
and leave to future generations a fine
specimen of French "art at the end of
the nineteenth century. His work has
been a lengthy one, as was that of the
other architects.
The plans evolved after long study In
the offices being submitted to Mr. Pi
card, the director-general of the expo
sition, were considered closely and at
length in their detail and entirely by
a commission of experts, and then re
turned for such changes and modifica
tions as seemed desirable, again and
again until a satisfactory result was
reached.
The general design for the Grand
Palais was the work of M. Deglanne,
but the execution thereof was too much
for one man. lie has four architects
in chief and forty subordinates, be
sides clerks and draughtsmen, under
him, devoted and loyal fellow workers
toward the common end. These in
stalled in the central part of the old
Palace of Industry are giving their en
tire time and attention to the erection
of the two new palaces.
: For this work, on such a considera
ble scale and of such permanent and
durable character, the architects have
invoked the aid of every kindred art
and means of assisting them in the
fullest study and development of their
designs and bringing out the appear
ance and effect that the completed
work would have, and so working up
to the highest degree of excellence, be
fore entering upon the final execution.
As is well known, plans and draw
ings made' by geometrical rules on a
plane surface, must suffer much distor
tion when put in perspective; much of
the structural grandeur and beauty is
lost and the symmetrical relation of
one part to another cannot be fairly
estimated, even when brought out to
the best advantage by the most skilled
hand. It persistently refuses to reveal
the true conception of the master mind,
and so far as it fafls short of the ideal
he has conceived, so far must the pro
duct of the constructor's skill be lack
ing.
Among other thing's the French arch
itects have in this instance had re
course to the construction of "ma
quettes" or models, veritable little pal
aces, in plaster, which skilled sculptors
construct under^ their. Immediate d,irec-
Â;-.^t
j tion. This work is tedious and delicate,
requiring special artists, and of neces
| sity, therefore, quite expensive. The
model of the "Grand Palais dcs Beaux
Arts " on a scale of 0.01 meters has oc
! cupied a number of sculptors more than
a year? and cost more than 30,000
; francs.
For the construction of these models
the architects give to the sculptors ex
act designs of the ground plans and fa
cades which they are to reproduce. On
\ a bench especially designed for this
purpose the sculptor establishes a true
plane surface which serves as a base
! for the whole construction. On this
surface he traces with much care
the plan of the edifice, without regard
; to the interior details, as the model is
! only intended to show what can be seen
from the exterior.
The principal parts are made sepa-
r ately, then mounted and joined to
i gether with a liquid plaster paste to
i form a whole. Each part is given to a
special workman. The profiles are cut
in sheets of zinc, and take the name of
"Kabarits." These, guided by a straight
' edge, are drawn over a layer of fresh
plaster, reproducing all the sinuosities
'of the profile. All the cornices and the
straight and curved moldings generally
are made in this manner.
LADY YARDE-BULLER'S
EVENTFUL LIFE.
JUST where is the dividing line be
tween mere harmless eccentricity
and that which the doctors con
aider insanity, and how soon will
Lady Yarde Duller reach and
cross it?
This is the question which is just
now being seriously considered by all
those who arc, from either friendly or
mercenary motives, interested in the
present welfare and ultimate fate of
the woman whose erratic conduct for
several years past has estranged her
from many of those who should be near
and dear to her, and placed her to a
great degree under the ban of public
opinion.
The story of the life of brave General
Kirkham's eldest child reads almost
| like a purely imaginary and not over
pleasing romance. Little did the gallant
soldierfatherthink, when he, for the first
time, cradled his first born in his strong
arms and looked down at the innocent
little face, fair and sweet as the petal
of an apnle-blossom, resting against
the breast of his dark blue uniform,
j that that pretty babe would make her-
I self a theme for the ill-natured gos
sip of two continents; that she would
render her loving mather's last days
most unhappy through an unseemly
legal wrangle over wealth which fate
had in store for him, but of which he
then did not even dream; and that she
would find herself, in her later years,
practically deserted by all the friends
of her youth, at war with her sisters,
accused of vulgar drunkenness, arrest
ed and driven through the streets of
Oakland irva patrol wagon, and forced
to endure d* examination as to her
mental condition before she was al
lowed to regain her freedom.
All these things have, however, hap
pened to Mary Leilah Kirkham al
ready. As to. her future, since she has
lost none of the, spirit which in the
past has led her slender feet through
many devious and thorny paths, it
seems more than probable that it will
be no more peaceful and conventional
than her adventurous and stormy past
has been.
Leilah was won by David Boyd Blair,
a handsome and very agreeable man,
of whom sh^ was both fond and proud
in those days before she had begun to
think of titles and London society
triumphs, and made her homf in a com
fortable but unpretentious house not
far from the family mansion. Julia
married an army man â Major Murry
Davis of the Eighth United States Cav
alry â and died twenty years since. The
third daughter became Mrs. James D.
Safford, and the youngest was wedded
to Dr. F. L. Wheeler of Oakland.
Of the four not one save JLeilah ever j
gave evidence of being in any way spe- I
dally different from the well-appear- !
ing, well-educated, well-bred people j
among whom they found their friends |
and acquaintances; and even she, dur- ;
ing the brief years of her first mar- I
riage, found her happiness with her
husband, her home and her pets, and
later with the two baby boys, to whom
In spite of her vagaries she still clings
With an unswerving devotion, which
proves that whatever her outward
faults may have been, and however
much she has become prejudiced !
against others of her own blood, a true
woman's heart beats in her bosom.
There are some who knew "beautiful !
Mrs. Blair," as she was called in those i
happy days, who declare that from the
loss of her husband dates the begin- i
ning of those small peculiarities of
thought and speech and conduct which I
have since given her unpleasant prom
inence before that portion of the world ;
who love to criticize, comment and
condemn. Be that as it may. after a !
time she fancied that she could once
again find happiness, and in 1886 be

IMPRISONED ON AN ICE FLOE
Stirring adventure of Third Mate Tilton, the volunteer, who came out of the Arctic Circle to bring news of the starving
whalers.
SINCE George F. Tilton shipped
to the Arctic in March
of last year as third mate of the
whaler Belvedere; he has had an
experience that few men would
have the courage to voluntarily
undergo, that of walking thousands of
miles in the desolate Alaska territory,
to carry news of the icebound ships and
save his comardes- from starvation.
Success in reaching civilization meant
life to hundreds of helpless men. Fail
ure meant death, through hunger, for
all of them.
"The most trying and difficult por
tion of the journey," said Mr. Tilton, in
relating his adventures, "was that
which I encountered between Cape Lis
bon and Point Hope. I found myself
imprisoned on an ice floe. After work
ing my way down the mountain to
reach iee â traveling on the ice being the
preferable mode in that country â I
came to the water's edge. Turning back
I found water again. The ice had sep
arated, leaving me on a floating island
with cliffs so high on either side that
to reach shore was impossible.
"Arctic ice becomes shelved by con
stant pressure. The only means of es
cape lay in dislodging a cake or layer
of the vast mass upon which I was
drifting and utilizing it as a boat. By
chopping with an ax, using also an ice
pick, shovel. and snow knife, and pry
ing with tent poles, I succeeded after
eight hours of the hardest work of my
life in detaching my improvised boat.
Upon this I paddled a distance of half
a mile or so, reaching ice which I could
travel over for about six miles. I
then made a landing, and for the rest
of the day and the next night did not
break camp, so exhausted had the trip
made me.
"Yes, I encountered a number of wild
animals. In the far north, in what is
called the Point Barrow district, the
ice is very jagged and in crossing it
one is apt at any turn to come directly
upon a polar bear. If cornered, or en
countered too quickly for them to es
cape, they are desperate fighters, and
a man traveling in that district should
keep his rifle in constant readiness to
shoot. I was obliged to kill two in
my journey. If they, scent a human
â
ydUnger brother of Lord Churnton
(Baron Thurston)â and for several
years after that event was one of the
reigning "married belles" of London so
ciety.
For a time her second marriage
seemed a happy one, but soon dissen
sions arose between herself and her
husband. She was high-spirited and in
dependentâa typical American girl in
this regard surely, though she makes a
great point now of being made by her
marriage an English womanâ inclined
to be a trifle more free in speech and
act than her staider English associates,
and she possessed a fine capacity for
spending money, which capacity was
not equaled by the amount which Mr.
Yarde-Buller thought sufficient for her
needs.
It can readily be seen that under
these conditions there was a fine field
for domestic difficulties. And as it was
not in her nature to endure reproof or
admonition with even simulated pa
tience the family life of the Yarde-Bul
lers was for some time a most unhappy
one.
The death of her father complicated
matters for the unhappy wife, for it
was found that his property, the value
of which was estimated to be at least
$2,000,000, really amounted to only a lit
being or see one, they are as anxious
as he is to avoid the encounter.
"Wolves are easily kept away if dogs
are around, the barking of dogs suffic
ing to alarm them. Otherwise blank
cartridges should be thrown around the
outside of the tent, as the smell of
powder will always drive them away.
"Travel in Alaska is unutterably
dreary. As far as the eye can reach
there is an apparently endless expanse
of snow and ice. Sometimes in the
distance one will see a cape or head
land and hope for vegetation or human
habitation beyond, but when the point
is reached it only reveals what one has
looked upon for days, perhaps weeks
and months â a monotonous, barreii
world of ice and snow. The earth
never seemed so vast a place as dur
ing that trip on its surface. I thought
that the higgest part of the world lay
within the Arctic circle.
"It was my first experience with a
dog team and I am told I have made
the greatest number of milesâ 33Bo,
from Point Barrow to Katmaiâ so far
traveled by one man with dog sleds.
Some of my shipmates had advised me
to take my dogs into the tent at night
in order to get acquainted with them,
that they might not be so willing to
desert me. Well, I tried it to my satis
faction. Crowd eight dogs into a ten;
scarcely large enough for three per
sons and have them jump over you in
a fight-to-the-finish contest all night,
during which you lose a fingernail or
two, and what few clothes you have,
and you will come to the conclusion
that you would rather part with a dog
once in a while than get thoroughly
'acquainted' with him. No matter how
many miles an Alaska dog has traveled
or how tired he is at night, he is al
ways in prime condition for a fight.
"I lost about fifty dogs altogether.
Some I was obliged to shoot, some went
crazy and some ran away. I secured
more from the natives as I went along,
and from the whites who had trading
posts. When the flesh on their feet
wore through from travel on the snow
it froze again, and I would have to
shoot them to end their suffering. In
order to keep dogs in good condition
they .should never be fed on cooked
fish. Dry or frozen fish should be
their diet, with seal oil to keep them
warm. They should not be driven
more than three days without an in
termission of one day's rest. I only
used mine four days when It was ab
solutely necessary, in order to make a
j=ia_tion, where they could, recuperate^
tie over $570,000, and even that was left
in trust to Mrs. Kirkham instead of be
ing divided between her and her daugh
ters.
Mentally tortured with her domestic
differences and greatly in need of
money to settle outstanding obligations
Mrs. â or Lady, as she prefers to be
called â Yarde-Buller came to this coun
try and tried to make a financial set
tlement with her family, but failing to
convince her mother and sisters of the
desirability of her plan quarreled with
them so seriously that the breach has
never been healed.
The death of Mrs. Kirkham partly
settled the difficulty over the property,
but as Mrs. Yarde-Buller has not as yet
come into possession of her share i-he
has had much difficulty with Impatient
creditors, and has been forced *o ive
very quietly. Her two sons, who seem
to have inherited not a little of the
brave Kirkham spirit which won their
grandfather deserved renown, are both
loyal to her. One of them is a lieu
tenant in the British army, but the
other is with her in this country, and
in all her difficulties, whether she be
right or wrong, she is sure of their sym-.
pathy and unswerving affection.
The worst faults cf this much talked*
about woman seem to be an almost un
limited capacity for getting into legal
wrangles with her fellow creatures, not
regulating her expenditures by her
tangible income, and taking no pains
whatever to avoid "the speech of peo
ple."
Several of my dogs I brought clean
through with me from Point Barrow.
"Once I hired a native guide who
got lost. Then my seafaring knowl
edge came to our rescue. Talcing my
chart, parallel rule and compass I
shaped my course across the plains ex
actly as though I were at sea and we
came out all right. I would rather
take ten thousand journeys by water
than repeat that Arctic journey on
land.
"But my trip was not altogether de
void of humorous incident. When trav
eling between the Buckland River and
Norton Bay, on the Kouack River, I
had walked all day, intending to make
Norton Bay by dark, but failing to do
so pitched camp. I had just finished
a supper of hard tack and canned
meats when I heard a mournful noise
outside the tent. I called out, asking
what was the matter.
"The reply came that it was an In
dian father, searching for his son, who
he feared was lost, he having gone to
his hunting traps fully twenty-four
hours before and had not returned.
"I invited the man in to eat. He sat
down Turk fashion and proceeded to
devour a tin of baked beans, three
large, partly frozen biscuit, three cups
of coffee and some canned meat. I
asked him if he would not have some
more, when he rose to go.
" 'No,' he replied, sadly, "I cannot eat
until I have found my son. I have no
appetite when he is perhaps in danger."
"Not being overstocked with pro
visions I was very glad I had not been
obliged to appease the old man's hun
ger when he had his normal appetite
with him.
"The missionaries were invariably
most kind to me. At Point Hope I
objected to taking a native woman with
me, but her husband would not go
without her. I believe that I owe my
successful trip from Point Hope to her
faithful care, and advise all travelers
to secure, if possible, the services of a
native woman. She repaired my boots
and clothing daily, carried my deer
skin stockings in her packer and even
slept on them in order to dry them.
Her knowledge of what was necessary
to preserve the health proved of no
small value to me."

] t was on ister Sunday that these chocolate-com

pates. If their small, beady eyes be ,no bigger and
their capacious mouths no wider at this end of the
nturous week, my word for it that 'tis not for
lac!: of exercise, for eyes and mouths have been put
to severest tests of expansion since our city and its
Two simple people have just been transported from one world to another. Tickey and Kunana, his wife, the two Esquimau guides
who accompanied Third Mate Tilton on his extraordinary trip through Alaska to bring the tidings from the icebound whaling fleet,
have been taken around the city by a Call representative and shown a few of the simple wonders of the "white man. these
two natives have been living in a condition of dazed wonder ever since their arrival. So paralyzed are they with our everyday
siehts that they will not venture anywhere unless Mr. Tilton is by their side to assure them that the earth will not swallow them
or that something out of the sky will not grab them away. When the first railroad car they boarded began to move Mrs. Tickey
grabbed Mr. Tilton and screamed. "Look! look! the white man's houses are all running away." For days they would not ven
ture into an elevator, "the house that runs up and down."
In their opinion "the white man can do anything he desires," make houses fly, stars shoot or stand on the street to light the
way make rivers run up hill and make fire come and go just as he pleases.
Mr Tilton says that when these two wonder-stricken natives return home and tell about the everyday sights they have seen,
<ucb as' electric and cable cars, electric lights, steam cars, gas, hydrants in the house, elephants, lions, etc., every one will set
them down as crazy and say, " Oh, the white man has bewitched you. There are no such things."
Meanwhile Mr. and Mrs. Tickey rub their heads daily and gasp at everything they see. Sometimes they shake each other
and say, "Am 1 awake or asleep?"
They will be taken back to their icebound northern home on the first steamer to the Arctic, and the tales they will have to tell
will hold ttte incredulous natives spellbound tor years to come.
complex wonders came within their ken.
To these simple souls, dog-like in devotion yet
ferocious in their savagery when racial instincts rise
uppermost, the Land of the White Man Is a region
of the incomprehensible, where the evidence of the
senses may. not be believed.
Tell them that the White Man can darken the
sun In high heaven, drain the great ocean dry to its
uttermost depths and lasso a corner of the new moon
els she glides through starry space, and they will
believe you. Have they not seen things more mar
velous than these come to pass in our strange, en
chanted world?
Mr and Mrs. Tickey are guests at a down-town
hotel, in care of G. F. Tilton. In a private dining
room they sample thrice daily the American bill of
fare, and if they be compelled to forego the dainties
to which they have been accustomed in the way of
seal, walrus, "bear and whale au natural, with blub
ber sauce and frozen fish on the side, left over from
last year's catch, they do not complain, lour true
Esquimau is not one to voice hardships.
They are learning our ways very fast, are the
Tickeys Already they wield knife and fork with the
grace and dexterity to be expected from hands ac
customed to whacking refractory ice floes with oars
and jabbing harpoons into a whale's hide. For at home,
at Point Hope, they go out in their skin boat in search
of whales, the traders paying them in provisions and
clothing, and while the man pursues the monster, the
woman, who pulls a better stroke than he, propels
the boat. Â. .
To their joy they have found ice here, unfamlllarly
clean, 'tis true, but ice nevertheless, and during the
long, hot days just past, the bell boys have been kept
actively in transit between their apartments and the
ice chest, with pitchers klink-klinking along the route
in musical response to the three-bell summons at the
push-button.
Nor have these guileless wayfarers attempted to
blow out the gas. When they are ready to dispense
with its rays at night they ring for a bell-boy to
"put out the fire," as they call it in their tongue,
for they know not so much as a word of any other.
As to their speech, it is like unto nothing that we
ordinarily hear. It sounds as the incoherent stutter
ing of a linotype machine might, if talked into a pho
nograph. Translated, Tickey means -'thimble," which
article the Esquimaux fashion out of a walrus tusk.
Kunana is -Morning Star," and the name of their
little son in the Arctic signifies "valley."
Kunana Is not a beauty, but there is a certain
plcturesqueness in her uncorseted outlines and a
dumb kindliness in her face. Across one cheek a deep
Bcax tells of past tragedy.
In her youth Kunana was the wife of the chief of
her tribe, who one day laid her cheek open with a
knife when she dared to displease him. He sup
plemented this conjugal attention with an attempt to
murder her. Her old father appeared upon the domes
tic scene and shot him dead.
Tickey, some ten years her senior, then came to
woo, and having in the required space of time killed
and trapped enough animals to prove himself a good
provider, her father consented to their union. The
rest of the tribe were called in to feast on the game
and the bride went to her husband's dug-out to live
happily ever after, her chin painted with three black
perpendicular marks, signifying wlfehood.
Their native costume ir. bull:- but light in weight
and consists of two deerskin suits â one worn with the
fur next the skin, the other with the fur outside.
Kunana looks with unqualified disapproval upon
the hat of the "white squaw." A shawl over her head
is the only compromise she can be induced to con
sider. Her hands are strong and plentifully ringed,
her inky-black hair braided behind each ear, and hid
den somewhere "twixt chin and waist is her beloved
pipe, with its curving stem made of wood, its bowl of
brass, and its tobacco and match accessories.
It was at Astoria that Mr. Tilton, who speaks their
language, took his attendants f<>r their first ride be
hind horses. To them a horse is the "White Man's
dog," a carriage and a cable car his "sled." So little
have they in their barren country witn which to com
pare the astonishing sights they soe that the must
they can do is to exclaim and gesticulate. Watching
their varying expressions of countenance, the bewild
erment reflected there and the impossibility of their
minds gaining the ieast clew to the kaleidoscope of
mysteries surrounding them, is entertainment for the
onlooker of a rare kind.
Fear they know not the meaning of, so implicit is
their faith in Mr. Tilton. If he should walk to the
end of Fisherman's wharf, drop into ihe bay and
swim to Goat Island, I believe that th^re would be a
brace of dusky Esquimaux at his heels to land with
him. And they would not regard the proceeding as
at all unusual in a country where "sleds" swoop down
upon them in all directions without four-footed aid;
where "little houses," as they term elevators, dart
dizzily skyward by invisible means; where people
drink water from totem polesâ for such to them are
the city's fountains; where a searchlight hunts one
out in the darkness, in the twinkling of an eye; where

The tram lay near the Park entrance awaiting the
conductor's signal to speed to the Cliff. Kunana and
her mate surveyed the cars curiously. Why did the
white man build a row of houses on hoops instead
of on the ground? A bell clanged and 10, the dwel
lings apparently picked themselves up and vanished.
Tickey stood" as though petrified. Kunana, being
a woman, was the first to articulate. She caught at
Mr. Tilton's sleeve.
"The houses'." she gasped. "The white mans
houses! They are all moving out of town!"
In faith, the dug-outs of her ancestors had deserted
them in no such weird fashion.
"The Chutes," I thought, as I laughed at their
amazement. What fun to take them there! Would
Mr. Tilton mind? Not at all, he said. Never a step,
though, would his companions budge unless he went,
too. So we traveled thence, an odd quartet, and
thereby hangs this tale.

Once, on a country road, I saw a Chinaman driver
clutching desperately the reins of a runaway horse
attached to a rheumatic wagon load of garden pro
duce. His queue cleaved the air behind him, a black
streak against the horizon, and at every bounce over
the highway's ruts the vehicle discarded a fresh in
voice of vegetables. Presently a violent lurch sent
the wheels spinning in air and for an instant the
dusty expanse seemed full of somersaulting China
man. Then he landed, badly scared but unhurt, upon
a pyramid of carrots and cabbages in the middle of
the road. I thought it the funniest thing that could
happen, but I had not then officiated as guide, phil
osopher, friend and envoy extraordinary to a pair of
newly imported Esquimaux.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Kunana blinked in the rays of the se-.'chllght like
a toad In the sunshine.
"See the big candle!" she cried In Tickey's ear,
but that amiable savage was too engrossed with the
workings of the turnstile to give respectful heed to
her staccato gutterals. A leather-lunged spieler next
fascinated him into statuesque silence, from which he
was rudely aroused by a vigorous shaking of the
shoulder. It was his better half in a high state of
excitement, for her little ferret eyes had spied the
merry-go-round. Toward it she sprinted in breath
less wonder, dragging the still speechless partner of
her joys and sorrows after her.
"Tickey!" she exclaimed, pointing a fat finger at
the revolving procession of dummies and their live
freight. A tangle of Esquimau words followed in
unintelligible succession. Mr. Tilton laughed.
"They cannot comprehend," he explained, "why
'dead dogs' are able to run faster than the live ones in
Alaska."
Then the source of the music attracted their at
tention. How could such noises come from a box?
they asked, as the organ ground out its tunes in the
center of the whirling circle. We put them aboard
the wooden horses and watched them in their dizzy
Journey, and I wish I could see one-half as much
genuine enjoyment upon the face of blase American
childhood as I saw that night upon the faces of those
grown-up children of the northland.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Like one in a dream, Kunana followed me up the
stops to the car that transferred us to the chutes'
top landing.
"Do the rivers come from the sky like that, In
your country?" she questioned Mr. Tilton, pointing to
the cascade at her left.
Just then a boatful of shrieking passengers shot
past her. She grabbed instinctively for Tickey, direct
ing that abstracted Indian's gaze from terra firma
and its swarm of humans, to the stream on the other
side. Another boat flashed downward. Then the
startled pair began to exchange exclamatory confi
dences. Mr. Tilton smiled.
"They are saying that the white man can do any
thing." he interpreted. "That he can make rivers run
up hill if he wants to, and that he can Jump out of
the stars."
Compared with such fancies the famous tale of
Jack the Giant Annihilator seems flat, stale and un
profitihle.
As we slipped into watery space, struck the lake's
surface and bounded again and again upward into
the spray I saw nothing, heard nothing but Esqui
maux. There might have been half a hundred of
them instead of two, for their delighted whoops
erhoed all around us like the voices of a tribe gone
wild with joy. They may have expected a whale or
two to spout beside them. At all events they will
never be surpassed in noise or the happy abandon
ment of their surprise during that damp, exhilarating
moment. Be it recorded of the Tickeys, Alaska tour
ists, that they shot the chutes like thoroughbreds.

Chiquita trotted sedately out from behind a cur
tain and the effect of that tiny mortal's presence upon
Kunana was magical. The rough features took on a
softened look. The hard, bright eyes shone tenderly
as they gazed. A smile played over the face of Ku
nana different from any that I had yet seen there.
And, strangely enough, it made her for the moment
almost comely. It intensified while the atom piped
her wee song and waved her doll-like arms, and then
I knew what it radiated from â the mother-love with
in. For be it on the spiritualized Madonna of an ar
tist's conception, or the face of an Indian, crooning
over her offspring in a wigwam, the smile of a woman
when she looks upon a babe is good to see.
"Mickaninni," murmured Kunana. gently, rocking
unconsciously to an^l fro. "Mickaninni."
Perhaps she was thinking of a sturdy little bar
barian thousands of mile 3 "way. As for myself, I
was wondering if Esquimau babies ever cry for their
mothers.
Chiquita looked hesitatingly at the big, clumsy
hand that Kunan. stretched toward her, then laid her
rose-leaf palm for an instant within I* Evidently
humanity's smallest representativ e is more accus
tomed to heathen white visitors than heathen brown

understood the world over, and in the light that shone
just then from Kunana's eye- even Chiquita was not
afraid.

Were your wild animal acquaintance limited to
deer, foxes and polar bears what manner of creatures
would the denizens of a zoo seem to you? To the
Tickeys they were new varieties of Arctic game, the
like of which had never been stowed away in their
caches, and much did they speculate upon their edi
ble qualities.
They were asking if the lion were good to eat,
when that unfriendly beast opened his jaws and sent
forth a roar like the combined fury of a dozen Arctic
gales. In the presence of such an unexpected blast
the Tickeys fell back in hot haste, nor paused till a
safer distance lay between them and the caged un
known. Mr. Tilton explained that the feeding was
usually done on the lion's side; that the white man
had no fancy for lions, cooked or uncooked, and that
a little way out in the ocean a big rock had been the
home for many years of countless seals, not one of
which had as yet been sacrificed for the white man's
larder.
Before the monkeys the visitors stood spellbound.
Were these a new kind of fox, or merely a different
kind of white man, as Chiquita was a different kind
of mickaninni? I respectfully leave these Esquimau
Interrogations for Dr. David Starr Jordan to answer.
But stranger than all else in the "animal's house"
was the elephant. Who of us is not used to the ele
phant from Infancy? Then how can we appreciate the
awe and interest which the sight of one inspired in
those Esquimaux? Especially did his long-distance
manner of feeding impress them.
We left the theater with two of the most absurdly
confused creatures in our wake that ever saw kineto
scope pictures thrown upon a screen. They believed
it a living reality. The white man's wonders would
never cease. Where did the people and the animals
on the screen come from? Where did they go to so
quickly?
As our car slowly climbed the grade on the scenic
railway Kunana pointed to the stars. Were we, too,
going there? she asked. Mr. Tilton cautioned his
charges to hold on tight. Then the car tore down the
grade with three hundred pounds of as amazed
Indian avoirdupois as it will ever carry. Up, down
and around we whizzed, then shot into a tunnel where
a great multi-colored eye opened wickedly at us.
When we emerged I looked back. Tickey was
huddled into a ball, cocoon-wise, and motionless as a
cigar store red man, except for the swaying of the
car. His eyes were fixed with mute questioning, but
unshaken ' confidence, upon Mr. Tilton. To him the
end of all things was coming, but our laughter as
sured him that, whatever it was, we were willing to
meet It.
Kunana, her hand In his, was trying to crawl under
the seat, and the picture they made will abide with
me forever and a day. No slough of despond will
ever be so deeply depressing that I cannot rise from
it at thought of those Esquimaux, dashing they knew
not whither, the puzzled playthings of a white man's

While we awaited on a corner the coming of a
down-town car Kunana drew forth her pipe and
puffed long and deeply. It was the one familiar in
animate object within reach, the only thing that was
real, and she fingered it affectionately. Tickey lit his
own pipe and they boarded the dummy of the white
man's sled, where tobacco of many brands makes the
life of the gripman unenviable.
In Kunana's hand I noticed c piece of paper which
she had carefully preserved, even during the wild
whirl between heaven and earth. It was a programme
which the gate keeper had gravely handed to her
earlier in the evening.

LOVE AND THE CAPELLO
Before Herkomer Could Move or Remonstrate Further There Was a Flash of a White Arm, a Rustle of the Soft Folds of Minora's
Muslin Dress, and He Sprang to His Feet to See the Cobra Being Held at Arm's Length.
THE lights from the Gymkhana club were stream
ing across Halpin road, and the drone of the band
came lazily across the open, filtering itself through
the octopus limbs of the big banyans, and over the
lake of roses with which professor had filled the com
pound. That was the professor's hobbyâ rosos. That
and snakesâ only the Bnakea were real business,
the roses were for pleasure. But both tnrlved equally
well in Rangoon, jacqueminot and the capello.
It was paradise, this land where the roses grew even
as cabbage, and the hooded devils came up out of the
jungle of their own account to be dissected. So thought
Professor Contl.
Hut the professor was over at the gym now, and the
drowsy music, elbowing and jostling the straggling light
as they crowded through the Kusn-Kush tatties, ming
ling with the soft patter of small talk witn which Minora
<'"Uti was beguiling the minutes as they ?;:t there, she
and tlii- major, waiting the return of the professor.
"(Â»!' course, the major's pony, Nat Time, would win
the Tharawady plate," she was saying, when she stopped
suddenly, and steadied herself as one does when a 10-foot
ditch suddenly opens its yawning maw under the forefeet
of o!H-'s mount.
The light which streamed out from the drawing room,
and offered battle to the glimmer of the Gymkhana,
showed the sudden paling of her cheek. Parian marble
was not more white than that set face.
"Do not move, major." she said; "do not move your
lips even, if you value your lite."
Herkomer looked straight into the great, strong eyes
of the girl, and they told him more of the danger, more
of the horror than even her wufcjs had done.
"Keep perfectly still." she continued, "and do not
interfere with me in any way."
"Yes, a cobra!" the lips whispered. "Do not move."
From the direction of Minora's eyes Herkomer knew
that the hooded demon was on the high back of his chair.
Surely it was the light of inspiration' which came into
the eyes of this strange girl, as she broke into a low
Italian chant, weaving her slender arms back and forth,
back and forth.
Herkomer could feel that the cobra was following her
movements. Great beads of perspiration stood out on his
foreheadâ not so much at his own proximity to the hated
thing, but because of the grand, cool courage Minora was
showing, and the risk she was running in drawing the
attention, of the viper To herself.
"She's going to hypnotize the beast." he thought He
knew she could do it, too; the face told him that. It
seemed cowardly to sit there and allow a woman to face
th>- snake, but h<-r command to keep perfectly stil! had
been as much entreaty as command, and he felt that by
IT WILL KILL
AT TWO MILES.
Here Is the story of our new bullet that is being used in the new
army rifle. It is small of size, but its execution is remarkable. It will
kill at two miles, and its power of penetration places it far ahead of its
leaden predecessors. The proofs are accurate, for the experiments were
made on cadavers and were conducted by experienced army officers.
EVER since the modern small arm
was invented military authorities
have been discussing the effects
of its small, hardened bullet, pro
pelled at immense speed, upon
the human body. It was easy |
enough to discover that at ten yards |
it would go clear through two feet of
seasoned white oak; at 200 yards
through 3Va feet of poplar or 0.2 inches j
of steel or 0.3 inches of wrought iron; j
at 2000 yards through four inches of j
deal plank, and at 3500 (nearly two ;
miles) that it would still have sufficient i
force to pass through a man! All this j
was easy, but how to find out its effect
upon the human body was quite a dif
ferent and a very much more difficult
matter.
It seemed that it might be necessary
to await a great war between nations
equipped with the modern small arm
bvfore this could be fully determined.
Much was expected from the war which
recently agitated Chile. The insur
gents, who proved the victorious party,
were partially armed with the Mann
licher â one of the best of the recent
email arms. Some of our naval sur
geons went upon the fields of battle to
treat the wounded and discovered the
effects of the bullets of the Mannlicher
upon the wounded.
The results seemed so much at vari-
Ince that finally it was decided by our
Chief of Ordnance to order a series of
experiments and find out exactly what
might be expected from these small
and hardened bullets. At his request
Dr. La Garde, of the United States
army, was, some time ago, sent to tho
Frankford Arsenal to direct these ex
periments. Lieutenant lienet, of the
Ordnance Corps, was detailed to assist
him in this important and difficult
work. The report of their extensive
experiments has just been issued and
is very interesting.
The experiments were made In a
shooting gallery with reduced charges
of powder. Lieutenant Benet accur
ately figured out the charge of powder
necessary to give the same velocity at
fifty-three feet as a full charge would
give at 6000, 4500, 3600, 2400, 1500, 1050, 750
and 300 feet. A cadaver was placed
fifty-three feet in front of the firing
moving he -would only increase the danger to both.
With the same sinuous movement Minora had risen
from her seat and gently swaying her r>ocly as the soft
cadences of the chant rose and fell, glided toward the
cobra.
"My God, keep back!" Ilerkomer groaned, scarcely
moving his liys. "Stand back and wait till he goes
away."
But the chant continued, and there were the inter
jected two English words "keep still!"
Before Herkomer could move or remonstrate further
there was the flash of a white arm, a rustle of the soft
folds of Minora's muslin dress, and he sprang to his feet
to see the cobra being held at arm's length, firmly
grasped by those slender lingers close up to its ugly
wedge-shaped head.
"Wait please," she cried, stepping back, as Herkomer
advanced toward her with evident intention of taking the
snake; "father's tomtom has just driven up to the door
lit- will take, the cobraâ it is one of his patients."
She was stiil holding the repulsive creature at nrm-a
length as the professor ran up the cemented steps, calling
for the bearer to come and take his toi
He stopped short when he observed the grewsome
tableau in front of him, Stopped short until startled Into
activity by his daughter's voice asking to be relieved of
her terrible captive.
In an instant the professor had the cobra by the tail,
and calling to Minora to let go quickly, he swung him
clear, and! holding him thus, carried him oack to the box
from which he had escaped.
Overcame by the reaction, the brave Eirl sank Into
the chair she had risen from, and gave way to a flood of
nervous, hysterical tears.
Of course, there could only be one reward for such
gallantry, if the term may be applied to women's brave
deeds. A "V. C." was cut of the Question; besides, the
great Italian eyes had worked sad havoc with Ilerkomer
before the advent of the cobra.
"L,ove made her brave," mused thÂ« major, as his
Burma pony rattled him over the metallic road of the
cantonment late that night; "but she's a well-bred one
any way, and blood will tell. God! how she stood there
and never flinched, with that devil in her hands!" And
then he thought of the soft maidenly blushes that had
swept over the sweet face as lie talked to her of love,
of the love that had been in his mind lor days and weeXa
before the appearance of that sinister visitor.
With Jesuitical complaisance Herkomer began to feel
deuced glad that the cobra bad precipitated matters by
poking his ugly head into their tete-a-tet*. It had given
him the opportunity to risk it all on a single throw of
the dice, and he had wonâ won with the other fellow, her
father's great friend. Count Rubitino, a baa second.
Count Rubitino was a dilettante, an amateur scientist
point. A tackle fastened to the roof
of the gallery held the cadaver and
permitted its easy movement. A good
marksman then fired upon the desired
portion of the body â for instance, the
upper bone of the arm. The bullets,
after passing through the body, were
stopped by sawdust in barrels, placed
directly in rear.
After the firing was finished the bul
lets were dug out and the effects o*
the passage through the cadaver upon
them were noted, as. well as the effects
of the bullets upon the body. On the
base of the bullets numbers were im-
pressed, which corresponded with the
shot fired, so that it was easy to iden
tify the bullet which made each wound.
The sawdust would not deform the
bullets, hence any change in their form
was due entirely to the passage through
the human body.
It was necessary to use the limited
range of fifty-three feet, because the
shooting had to be accurate. Dr. La
Garde wished to note the effect of
these bullets upon nearly all the bones
and many of the tissues of the body. It
takes a very good marksman to hit a
man at 3000 feet, and it would take a
much better one to hit a man at that
distance in the exact spot he wished â
for instance, in the leg. As the supply
of cadavers was limited, it was impos
sible to get up a row of them at a dis
tance of a mile or so, to be hit by
chance shots in any part. Hence a
distance of fifty-three feet was select
ed and the charges of powder reduced
as before stated, to give the bullets the
same velocity they would have had at
the actual distances simulated. The
bullets used were the old style .45-inch,
soft lead Springfield and the new style
.30-inch, hardened lead with a coating
of German silver. Two small caliber
rifles were made especially for use in
these experiments.
â¢ The details of the wounds made in
the firings and the effects upon the
bullets were very minutely reported by
Dr. La Garde. The more important of
these will, perhaps, interest the gen
eral reader, who, no doubt, has read
many conflicting articles upon the ef
fects of small caliber bullets. v The il
lustrations are from photographs taken
by Dr. La Garde.
It is well known that at different dis
tances from the muzzle of a gun the
effects from bullets firod from it are
not at all the same. These different
distances are grouped together into
"zones," each zone containing all dis
tances where the effects from the bul
lets are practically the same. The first
of these is the zone of explosive effect.
Dr. La Garde reports that the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 17, 1898.
wounds within this zone are of a pecu
liar and terrible nature. The orifice of
entrance is small, but sometimes rag
ged, and the opening where the bullet
leaves the body is wide and jagged,
with muscular shreds hanging to it.
The channel left by the bullet is coni
cal, and its sides are turn and crushed,
as if something had burst within thorn.
If a bone is struck in this zone then
the wound is much more terrible and
its exit frightful in size and appear
ance. At times from such a wound
fragments of bone an<l tissue are hurl
ed thirty to forty feet
Now this zone Of awful explosive ef
fect extends, as determined by Dr. La
Garde, from the muzzle of the gun to
a distance of 350 yards in the case of
the small bullet and only to 250 yards
with the large .45-inch bullet. How
ever, this explosive effect did not occur
when the small bullet struck only the
muscular parts of the body, in which
ease it made a clear cut hole through
the cadaver.
The small bullet beyond 350 yards did
not shatter a bone so much as the soft,
large bullet. If the small bullet was
not turning end on it generally per
forated the bones with little or no
splintering. It goes so fast and turns
so rapidly that it. as it were, punches
a hole through the muscle or bone,
whichever it may strike. This zone is

ostensibly devofed, like Minora's father, the professor, to
the discovery of an antidote to the virus of the cobra
and kharite,
"All dâ n rot!" said Herkomer to the little iron gray
that was carrying him so gallantly aiong. "Minora's
his same, and I have beaten him. my boy, beaten him
clean out of his boots, by Jove." and he chuckled to him
self as he thought of the bally row both the count and
the professor would kick up when they learned how the
land lay.
As he jogged home from parade next morning, Herko-"
mer brought his pony up alongside of Surgeon Thorny
croft.
"Come over and have breakfast with me. I want to
have a talk with you, old man," he said.
The preliminary of the talk was an acco.unt of what
had happened the night before over the advent of the
thing with the spectacles, for he and Thornycroft were
even .'is Damon and Pythias in the olden tim<?.
"Now for the sequel, my boy," he said, as he drew
his chair closer to Thornycroft, "and then J. want you to
tell what is the matter with me."
Thornycroft phot a suspicious professional look over
the physical map of bis friend's exterior, starching for
touches of "liver," "sun," "Bunnah head." "pegcitis"
or other unique complaints indigenous to that land.
"It's this," said Herkomer thoughtfully, "I woke up
about 3 o'clock in the morning, as near as I can judge,
with a peculiar tingling sensation through every nerve
of my body, as though some poison were coursing through
my veins. " Sitting in a chair beside my bed was the ligure
of a man.
"I spoke to it, thinking that the bearer had fallen
asleep there.
'"fine ligure did not move. I got up and struck a
match, lighting a candle which stood on the table; I dis
lodged a bottle of soda in my fumbling about for a match
and it rolled off, striking the cement floor and exploding
with a report like a gun.
"Still tlio figure did not move. It must be the bearer,
I thought, only a bearer could sleep through such a jolly
row.
"When I turned the light of the candle on the fact
of the Bleeper, what do you suppose I saw. Thornycroft?"
and Herkomer leaned over until his troubled, questioning
eves wen- brought close into the surgeon's face, anu ne
gripped Thornycroft's wrist till his lingers seemed eating
into the ilesh.
"One of the fellows who had tarried long at the gym.
and lost the number of his mess," answered the other
carelessly, ki ocking the ashes off the end of his cheroot.
"I saw myselfâ dead!" continued the major, taking no
notice of his friend's chaff; "dead, and a cobra clinging
to my arm!"
"Liver and sun both," sighed Thornycroft mentally.
one of perforation, and the wounds in
it are not as severe us in the first zone
and the zone of contusion.
The alta zone in the small bullets
extends from a distance of two thou
sand to three thousand yards. In this
zone bullets have lost their force and
have a tendency to bruise rather than
penetrate. The smaller bullets, of
course, penetrate further than the
targe, soft ones. Sometimes the small
and Ions? bullets, if turning end on,
merely bruise the llesh and penetrate
Car enough to remain in the flesh.
These experiments refuted the idea
quite common in Europe that wounds
from the new bullets are terrible as
compared with the old, large bullets.
In fact, it was shown that a hardened
bullet of sin.i !! caliber should, on hu
manitarian grounds, be adopted. If the
bullet is hardened, but has no tensile
strength, then the wounds when bones
are struck will be terrible, since such
a bullet would break up and each sep
arate piece become a projectile. Some
experiments made abroad were with
such bullets and upon horses, whose
bones are very hard. In consequenc*.,
the results were often appalling and
misleading.
It has been a mooted question
whether a man struck in a fleshy part
of the body by a small bullet would be
disabled. When a bone is struck, either
"Of course, you'll call It a dream," added Herkomer,
"but this morning the soda bottle was In fragments on
the floor, the candle had been lighted, and the sole ot
my foot was bleeding where 1 had stepped on a piece ot
the broken glass; besides, I know I was awake. Now,
what do you make of that?" he asked triumphantly.
"What do you make of it?" Queried the surgeon as
he hunted about for his helmet, "make nothing of it;
only don't let it occur again, and as preventive is bet
ter than cure in this country, take a run up to Dar
jeeling: it may save you the expense of a trip home.
There Is a little angel sits up above, in these days of
robbery by ruinous exchange, who sends us these warn
ings with a postscript added. 'Look to your liver.
SottV.c next time your chum comes take him up to Dar
jeeling, and let the mountain winds carpet-beat the
jungle fever out of his system."
"No. I'm quite well," said Herkomer; "quite well, and
that's the deuce of it," he added plaintively; "I can't make
it out. When a man is well and sees things it'sâ it's the
devil."
Often after that Herkomer had company of the same
sort; always the same, sitting there in the chair waiting.
"What the thunder is it waiting for?" Herkomer used
to ask himself. Only he did not bother his friend any
more about itâ it was no use.
Physically he was all rieht. He could put the best
man in the regiment on his back; aye, and nold him
there, too, for ten seconds, with both points of the
shoulders touching the ground. Neither did ne go to Dar
leeling. He was in a happier place, ana climbed into
heaven, otherwise known as the haunts of Minora Conti.
Not but what the hot chinook winds which blow up from
hades sometimes withered and scorched his paradise.
It was Count Rubitino who always started these
blasts. He and Minora were unnecessarily too much
together, it seemed to Herkomer, but then he was jealous,
and consequently no judge of such matters.
As often as Minora assured him that she cared noth
ing for the count he believed her. and as often as he
Btumbled upon them in close communion over some
secret matter did he feel the hot winds blow, and vow
that he would break away from his bondage and leave
her to the count. But it always ended the same way, It
wasn't what Minora said that put things right, it was
the eyesâ the great, soft Italian eyes looking straight and
truthfully at and through him, bowling over his jealous
resolves like tenpins and bringing him back into leash,
like a whipped beagle.
And still it sat there, almost nightly now, beside his
bed. He had grown accustomed to seeing it. What was
it waiting for?
Sometimes it annoyed him; he felt like getting out of
bed and kicking it; but the idea was so incongruous, this
kicking of himself, this spiritual self, as it were, so he
gave it up and sighed resignedly.
"Of course it means something," he mused; "some
thing's going to happen, but I'm not going to make an
ass of myself by talking about it at the mess." So he
sat tight and waited for the thing to happen as he would
have waited for a Ghazi rush.
It was grewsome, but much in India is grewsome, so
he had learned to take things of that order much as he
took fighting â with his coffee.
A far greater puzzle to him was Minora herself.
Sometimes he found her listless, indifferent, and then
again for a time she would be her old brilliant self.
Thinking perhaps that these tits of dejection were due
to oppression from her father, or undue influence brought
to bear by the count, he made bold to Question her, but
she shrank from him with horror, and seemed more
agitated than she had been when holding the cobra.
It's nerves, he thought. Life with the musty old pro
fessor and his cobra associates is depressing enough to
wreck the nerves of a bronze Buddha. I'll nave to get her
out of this.
So he rushed/matters a little, and it was all settled for
Christmas week. The professor gave his consent reluct
antly enough, Herkomer thought, and the count congrat
ulated him with an ironical sneer that made Herkomer
long to give him a toss In the air from which he would
alight on the top of his curly black head.
When ho and common sense sat face to face, common
sense told him that Minora loved him with all the strength
of her high-strung nature. What else is there in it for her,
common serTse argued, for the major's inheritance was
limited to what his sword might cut down rrom the pagoda
tree, with the exception of a trifling- allowance, barely
large enough to settle his monthly gym account. ;
That was the way common sense put it, but the' other,
intuition, or whatever other alias he masqueraded under,
said there was something behind it all, and for once in a
way they were both right.
The love was there right enough, and also something
else behind it, and this something else might have all
come out one evening if Herkomer had not been so
Cooley-headed; honorable he called it at the time.
Jt lacked two weeks of Christmas time, and they
were sitting on the veranda, as they had sat that
other evening. Minora, putting her cool white hand on
Herkomer's wrist and turning her face a little into the
shadow, so tliat he did not notice how set and white it
was, said: "I have a confession to' make, Rolando!"
"Don't make It then, little woman. Confessions are
silly things for which we are always sorry ror afterward."
"But I shall be happier if you let me tell you about
this. I can't marry you without telling you first. I won't â "
"Look here, Minora," said the major, turning her
around so that he could look into her face, "my objection
to your confession is purely selfish. You see, I couldn't
let you confess all on your side, without unloading some
of my sins into your ears, and if we exchanged experiences
âwell, well, I fancy the count would appear such a saint
by comparison that I should lose you altogether. By the
way, I'll compromise," he added, laughingly. "I'll" just
nsk you one question, which you may answer or not, and
then we'll call the whole thing off."
"I will answer." she said quietly, "onlyâ onlyâ "
"Well, has it anything to do with the count, what you
were going to tell me?"
"No." .
"Then I can't possibly listen."
And. so the chance went by, the evil went onâ went on
for two weeks longer, and it was the eve of the wedding
day.
COMPARATIVE PENETRATION OF NEW AND OLD STYLE BULLETS.
Showing how the new style bullet has an infinitely superior penetrative power.
with a large or small bullet, the man
is, of course, disabled but with flesh
wounds the result is doubtful. There
Is no question that the small caliber
bullet will not so effectually stop a
man when hit in a fleshy part of the
body as the old-fashioned large bullet.
In the Dahomey war the small bullets
of the French, striking the natives in
almost vital spots, often did not stop
them in their wild onward rush.
In the English service two men were
accidentally shot with small bullets.
One man a mile and a third from the
firing point was hit in the fleshy part
of the thigh. He did not fall nor did
he realize that he was seriously in
jured. The second man was but one
hundred yards from the gun, the bul
let passing through the thigh clear of
the bone. He did not fall and did not
suffer much of a shock. In either case
the result would have been very seri
ous with ttie large lead bullet, the
shock from which would surely have
knocked the men down.
Now, if these bullets will not stop
men, much less will they stop horses
when in a charge. In order to hay:
them do this various means have been
proposed, such as having a point not
covered by the hard jacket, then when
the bullet strikes it will spread out in
a sort of mushroom shape and produce
a wound terrible enough to stop man
or beast.
On the score of humanity, the small,
hard, undeformable bullet if greatly
superior to all others, but if it will not
stop a man in his runs forward or. a
horse in the wild gallop of the charge
this bullet will have to be modified, for
war at its best is a terrible thing, and
in no sense is it humane. Certain
, things are not permitted in modern
I war, as for instance, the poisoning of
drinking water or the using of chain
ed cannon balls. These would make the

Love does many strange things, among others causes a
pony to gallop so fast that a syce cannot possibly keep
pace with the winged rider. That was why Herkomer
arrived at Minora's home syceless. As there was nobody
.to hold his pony, he led him around behind the bungalow
to the stables.
'Mlnora'g rooms were in the north wing of the bunga
low, and as he passed the great windows opening on to the
veranda and reaching from ceiling to floor, and open save
for the shutters, voices that he could not help but hear
fell upon his ear.
For an instant he stood petrified. It was the count's
voice, speaking to Minora.
"You will wreck your happiness for a fancy," sneered
the voice.
Herkomer quickened his pace, so that he might hear
no more, and- of her answer, whatever it was, he only
caught the one word "confession," as he turned the corner
of the bungalow. ;
But all the fier.ee jealous passion that had slumbered
in his heart for weeks arose and smothered himâ smothered
everythingâ all sense of shame, of justice, of prudence,
and he rushed into Minora's boudoir a passion-mad man.
What right had she. who was to become his wife the
next day, to hold secret intercourse with the count there
in her own apartments?
With a startled cry Minora thrust something into the
drawer of a secretaire beside which she was standing, and
stood with her back to it as though she -would guard the
secret.
Perhaps I am de trop," remarked the count, passing
beyond the purdah with a low bow, and as Hernomer
thought, a sneer on his pale face.
"Whyâ why have you rushed in here, Rolando, and
frightened me?" asked Minora confusedly,
v "Ji am ,, sor O; i? I have frightened you/ said the major
shortly, and I will answer your question by asking an
other, for perhaps your answer will suffice for both ques
tions. What have you got in that drawer?"
If Minora had not gone white with guilty fear It might
have been all right yet: but it was the faltering which
developed the tiger in the man. He took a quick step for
ward and grasped her wrist cruellyâ harshly as he fairly
hissed out, "You have a letter or something from him
there!"
"My God!" she moaned; "back, do not touch It. If you
touch that drawer I will never marry you â never." With
an exclamation or rage he brushed "her to one side, and
snatching the drawer open, piunged his hand In.
There was the lightning swish of a dark body, like the
coil of a wniplash in motion; an electric shooting of pain
through his arm which brought an Involuntary cry of
anguish from his lips, and the twisting, writhing of the
hideous cobra-body as he snatched his hand from the
death trap.
A piercing scream had rung out on the still night air
as he pulled the drawer open, for, powerless to stop him,
Minora had foreseen that he was driving to his death.
It was the scream that brought the professor to the
room.
"Quick, father, Rolando is bitten," and before the
major knew what he was about, the professor had grasped
his wrist as in a vise and pulled him into his own room,
which was next.
From that on it was a head and head finish, with the
professor and death as the runners. There were ligatures
and lancing and the injection of the professor's antidote
and the ceaseless marching up and down of the patient
between two sturdy durwans, and the of a
woman with a great sore heart and eyes that were too
dry and hot for tears.
And the other, the one that had sat night after night
by Herkomer's bed, came and sat there just in the center
of the veranda, Herkomer would not let the durwans
move the chair. "Don't disturb him," he said; "let him
sit there."
"Huzoor, it is but an empty chair," said one of them.
"No one sits there, sahib."
But still he told them not to move the chairâ they could
walk around it. "He won't have long to wait now," ha
muttered.
"Surely the poison was making the sahib a little mad,"
the durwan thought.
At first Herkomer felt strangely elated. It was liko
new wine â be was drunk on it; it was good to be bitten by
cobras. If he could only get over it he would IlKe to try
it againâ was like opium. -7--" 1 _ â¢â 'â¢.*-'
And then came the poppy sleep. He begged them to let
him lie down and rest. . .:; "; ;- . ..
"If you sleep you die." the professor yelled in his ear.
The voice was far off, it was like a dream, it was the
murmuring of the breakers far away on the coral reefs,
and required too much energy to listen to it. Besides he
was so tired and sleepy. This ceaseless walking up and
down was like counting sheep, it made his head heavy

A number of inventors have lately
claimed to have made coats of some
unknown materials which will effectu

these small bullets. There is no doubt
that such a garment would prove ex

I it is remembered that one of these bul

men seem absurd.
A garment to resist successfully
would, of whatever material construct-

wear in the field. In the future, as in
the past, a good pile of dirt will be the
best and most easily obtained protec
tion. In the late civil war the soldiers
at first thought a man a coward who
would get behind a tree or dig a hole in
the ground for shelter, but now all is
changed and soldiers are taught to
take advantage c-f everything that will
give the slightest protection.
By considering the results of Dr. La

AT THE BRAKE
I HAVE been talking to the motor
man.
Not on his car; dear me, no. I
wouldn't have the heart to do that
in thp face of the company's gentle
plea to the contrary, which is displayed
above his -head, but I tracked him to
his lair, as it were, and finding him In
his variety by no moans the fierce and
murderously inclined monster that he
is frequently represented to be I con
versed with him without fear.
I talked with him concerning his avo
cation, its duties and its dangers; and
knowing well what a large proportion
of the general public thinks of him I
essayed to find out what he thinks of
the human tide through which hesteers
his unwieldy craft, what causes he as
signs for tlic accidents which occur and
â which just miss occurring, and how life
seems from his standpoint.
I discovered that he has his griev
ances; that he considers himself ofton
unfairly treated, and that he does not
go about maiming and killing human
beings, running over dogs and into
Ji-rs.'s and smashing vehicles just for
the fun of the thing.
Here is what he. in his various indi
vidualities, said to me:
F. S. GrOGGlNâ Whenever any one

me is that there are not accidents oc

think that they would view the matter
very differently afterward. Not a day
goes by that some narrow escape does
ii"t occur, but when no one is hurt the
fact that the m< Gorman's coolness and
quickness saved a life that its owner's
carelessness nearly sacrificed generally
passes uniinticed.
The worst shake-up that I have had
lately was down on Mission street. I
had been following behind a heavy
truck and a boy ran out from behind
aimther team coming toward me, right
across my track, within two feet of me.
If I had hurt that boy that I never saw
until he was almost under the car I
Fhi'iild have been blamed, of course, but
It was almost a miracle that I didn't.

M. SCHUMACHERâ I have been a
car man for twenty-two years, driving
horae-cara, gripping and motoring, and
I have been what is called lucky, but
I have had narrow escapes enough to
make most any man's hair white. Chil
dren bother me the most, for the poor
little things haven't got the sense to
look out for themselves, and when their
parents turn them out into the street
to play and I have to look out for
them, as well as run my car on time,
Jt makes a day's work hard. Over on
Broadway and south of Market, where
th>- babies are thick, it's all a man can

HOW "SHUT-IN" LIVES ARE HELPED
IF you go along Sutter street till
vnu come to No. 639 you see a
brown house standing back from
the streei. It bears the sign, "San
Francisco Fruit and Flower Mis
sion."
Years ago some girl? wanted to help
those who had U-pp than they them
selves, BO they formed themselves into
a society to visit and read to the sick
and try to brighten their shut-in lives
with flowers and fruit.
The work grew. Now the name is
most misleading. At the Congress of
Charities the work of caring for the
sick of all the societies was given to
the Fruit and Flower Mission, each so
ciety contributing a certain amount
toward the expense.
Mrs. Buckingham, the vice-presi
dent, had asked me to meet her at the
Thursday morning meeting of the so
ciety. The ladies were discussing ways
and moans and filling baskets with
groceries to carry to their charges.
Those who were able to come or send
were there, waiting for their weekly
supply.
One pretty little girl came in timidly.
"I was to come here this nornlng."
"Yes. indeed that's all right. What
is your name?"
"Mary Wilson."
The list was consulted and a basket
given tv her.
"This is for you."
She looked at it, then at the giver.
and back to the basket.
"But this is enough for lots!"
"Yes. that is to last for a week. Don't
you understand?"
"Oh, something to eat every single
day: To-:..orrow, too?"
She was not accustomed to three
meala a day every day in the week.
The mission is absolutely non-sec
tarian. The workers aro Jewish, Cath
olic, Protestant, Theosophist. .hey have
nrvor clashed and there are no dis
cords.
It is a fashionable society and works
both ways. Those who give are edu
cated in life as It is as well as those
who receive. Two trained nurses are
employed to do the work where skill
and training is necessary. Also they
teach those they visit how to take care
of themselves, their children and their
homes.
I went with one of the nurses on her
rounds. "Promise not to say any
thin* about me. I should be ashamed.
and run back, or stop on the track and
look, at the car, and you have to be
sure of yourself and the brake and
the track to save them. Another thing:
Women getting off the car with two or
three children lose hold of one some
times and it will go right in front of
the car on the next track. That hap
pened to me on Second street the other
day. My car came along and there
was a four-year-old standing back to
me while his mother was going over
toward the sidewalk. I stopped about
six inches from the child, and the af
fair frightened me so that I Just
couldn't move for a moment or so af
terward, but the mother never even
thanked me. I've lost twenty-three
pounds since I began running on the
Mission line, Just because I have to
work and worry, too.
W. S. CRONKâ I have been nine years
on the cars and have had my share of
bad scares. The most trying thing to
me is the way men and women step
in between two passing cars â a most
dangerous thing to do, but they don't
seem to realize that fact. People will
get off the wrong side of the car in
spite of the conductor, and th^n if
another car is coming along there's apt
to be trouble. Then, again, there
seem to be some persons who deliber
ately expose themselves to danger for
a purpose. Some people wouldn't mind
Ratting hurt a little if they could get
good pay for it, and most every motor
and grip man has met such cranks ami
had to save them in spite of them
selves.
A motorman's nerves are strained all
the time, with the people, the children
and the teams. The heavy truck men
of this city, though, are a fine lot ot
men, the finest I ever came in contact
with â they never make any bother if
thfy can help it, but the drivers of
light wagons â some of thetÂ»j â are nuis
ances. They like to tantalize a man
and keep just ahead of him when he
wonts to make time.
JOHN MILLERâ I have worked on
five different lines and one of the worst
frights I ever grot was the first night
that I took charge of a motor. It was
on Folsom street, near Twentieth, and
a child about four years old, who was
walking along one side of the street
with Its mother, saw Its father on the
other side and started after him. She
started so suddenly that I was taken
by surprise, and the worst of it was
that when she got half way over she
fell right across the track. My hair
rose right straight up. for it had been
raining and the track was slippery, but
I managed to bring the car to a stop
within about a hand's breadth of her
little head. Instead of reallzln that
I had paved the baby's life the father
wanted to whip me, which I thought
rather ungrateful, but I was new to the
business then and had not learned that
that's about all we grip and motor men
can expect under such circumstances.
Down on Second and Bryant not long
ago an old gentleman stepped out from
behind a loaded truck right on my
track, not six feet ahead. I put on the
brake like lightning, but as the car
stopped it struck him and knocked him
down, hut didn't hurt him. The first
thin? he did when he got his breath
was to swear at me for not ringing my
gor.g. I had been ringing the gong for
the truck, but if I had stopped to ring
it for him he would have been mashed,
sure. It was brake or nothing in his
case, and so I chose the brake.
Broadway and the crossing at Fourth
and Mission are the worst two places
that I ever struck, and the middle of
the day when people are going to
lunch, and F> and 6 in the afternoon, are
thp worst timos in the day.
C. F. RACKLIFF-I am a rather new
man, but I have had my experiences.
Two weeks ago I was going down Mis
sion, near Nineteenth, and in the mid
dle of the block two boys jumped out
from behind a car on the other track
ri^ht in front of me. I managed to
stop just in time not to hit them, but
ail the passengers were frightened: we
had a great time with the women
By the Fruit and Flower Mission.
I am paid for the work, and I do love
it so," she said.
They are supposed to work from 8 to
5, but they leave off work when they
can, and it may be any hour of the
night. The hills are steep and cars do
not go everywhere and money is scarce.
Sometimes the work Is very discour
aging, but almost every place the
nurse's patients love her and look for
her coming and try so hard to do as
she asks them. The nurses are subject
to call at night, for sick ones may grow
worse, or they may be called to receive
a small newcomer.
An old woman lay in her room alone
for two months. The neishb-T? cami!
in when they could and helped her, but
the women of the poor have so much
of their own to do. It was oniy the
second visit of the nurse, and she had
nut fully gained the confidence of her
patient. It takes sometimes many vis
its to gain any response, but usually
it is immediately given.
"You do not want all these things on
your bed, let me make you comforta
ble."
"I can't get up; maybe nobody will
come in; I can reach them here.'"
"I'll put everything back, and see.
I've brought you sonve r]p,in sheets and
pillow cases and a nightgown; won't
you let me put thorn on?"
"I always did everything for myself;
I do not like to be a. bother."
"But I love to do it. You will let me
rub your back; It must ache lying so
long in bed."
The eyes gave half consent, for
though the old lady said she felt pretty
well, she was in an advanced state of
consumption, and also she had a can
cer. No precaution had been taken to
prevent the spread of either contagion.
It was a Joy to see the transforma
tion, how deftly that linen was changed
and the patient gratitude of the suf
fering old face. Sho drew the line off
sharp at water, however.
"Now I comb my hair."
"Let me do it, you are tired already."
"No, no, no one ever combed my hair
since my mother."
The room was so dirty, but some bits
of beautiful Mexican embroidery, pic
tures and books, plants and the pains
taking contrivances to keep house In
one room showed that she had been
very cozy and comfortable.
The dirt worried her, and it troubled
her that strangers should have to wait
on her.
"I always liked it nice, but now it
makes me so sick when I sit up."
"Of course it does. You have always
worked for others, so that Is why we
love to help you now."
On a chair drawn close to the beri was
a small oil stove where the old lady did
her cooking. New supplies were with
in reach on a table and on the bed
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 17, 1898.
screaming and the men Jumping up
and shouting. For a wonder .they all
said that I did well and praised me for
my quickness in stopping. On the very
next block there was a milk wagon
standing in front of a store and the
driver Jumped in. pulled the wrong
rein and turned the horse right on the
track, and I had to stop short again.
You've got to have your eyes and
wits about you all the time, and watch
out for everything, and you've got tr>
remember that if you put on the
brakes too strong when there's trouble
they may break and leave you help
less. A man mustn't get nervous or
excited, no matter what happens, or he
can't do anything. A funny thing hap
pened to me the other day on Kearny
street, near Jackson. A Chinaman
with a bundle on his head started
across the street and bunted ri U1 into
the side of my car and knocked, himself
over, though I was ringing my gong
all the time. Talk about absent-mind
ednessâhe was the most absent-mind
ed person I ever saw.
J. D. HELI'MS-I have been three
years on the cars and I can assure you
that it is a very hard life for any one.
It is extremely hard on a man's nerves
and the excitement and continual strain
of eyes and nerves and muscles shorten
life as the hardest kind of merely man
ual labor could never do. A motorman's
eye must not be turned off the track be
fore him for more than a second at a
time, and he must be ready to meet and
conquer difficulties constantly.
Night work is the hardest on me, for
though there are less people on the
street there are more intoxicated ones,
and drunken men are apt to do all man
ner of things that make life exciting for
a car man. When I was new to the
business there was a foggy night â it
was New Years. I remember â and a
man suddenly appeared right at the
were books, papers and some mending.
Only a poor old woman, whose chil
dren wore all dead, and her husband,
too, waiting a while till she, too, went
beyond.
In the next place we visited there had
been a pathetic attempt to clean up.
The morning work, however, was un
touched, the dishes unwashed and bed
unmade.
A ragged woman, unkempt, sat in a
low chair rocking a baby and singing
the most beautiful music I ever heard,
so familiar, but a new meaning given
to the old, old words. She had sung in
the choir and because she preferred the
English had adopted it in place of the
Latin.
"We therefore pray thee, help thy
servants whom thou has redeemed with
thy precious blood."
The baby lay quiet, a girl Tftth yellow
curls and big brown eyes fastened on
her mother, and drinking In every
strain of the music.
The room was full of sunshine, and
standing at the door we forgot that
we were there to help.
"No, she seems in such pain and sh^
cries when I stop singing." The little
one rolled its eyes at us, but the intelli
gence had gon Â» out of the face, for it
was "not all there," as the Scotch
kindliness puts it.
Nurse took the little one so tenderly.
"How is Ellle?"
"Bye, bye."
"You shall go bye bye, but now I
must dress that burn. Ellie be good
girl?"
She began to tremble as the clothing
was taken off. The mother brought a
basin of water and some clothes. She
held the child, kissing its hands while
it screamed with the pain and fright.
It had fallen against the stove, and tho
hands, arms and one side were fright
fully burned, but with the careful,
skillful dressing given daily it was get
ting on beautifully. "I am so proud
of Ellie, and her mother, too."
From the porch came a drunken
voice:
"Mother of God, where are ye, ye
shaming, weak-kneed child of â
"It's only amusing myself I was, beg
parding."
"Ellen, you are drunk; go home and
go to bed."
"Ye lie, and may it choke ye where
ye stand. Take shame upon ye, to come
here meddling with decent folk."
"Ellen, go home."
"Home is it, ye say; it's no home of
yours I'm in â "It clear you, I'm going
to bed here."
"No, you are not; you are going
home."
The woman's tangled red hair and
bloated face told a tale of a long bout.
She began cursing us in the most hor
rible language; the baby screamed and
its mother seemed bewildered between
side of the track. I put on brakes but
he staggered in front as the car was
slowing down and got badly cut about
the head. The passengers all said that
I was not to blame, but it pave me a
shock that It tool, a long while to get
over. I think that parents and school
teachers ought to teach children to keep
out of the streets, and cross at the
proper crossings when they cross at all.
Wagons, too, are always running into
danger. They turn in ahead of us or
else cut across and if we hit one we are
blamed. If teamsters and drivers had
to be broken in the same as motormen
and were not allowed to take teams out
until they knew how to drive- there
wouldn't be half as many accidents.
The worst accident that T was ever
in was on the Mission road when a man
ran out of a saloon to catch my car. I
shouted to him to wait till the up car
passed, but he kept right on and was
struck by that car and killed. It was
not my fault and I was not blamed, but
it unstrung me for quite a while.
Motor and grip men are at a disad
vantage for when they hurt people they
fear and shame. I came out of my I

shoulders and helped her out.
"Now," said the nurse, "I'm going lo
take baby for a little walk. You go get
the dishes washed and I will help you
clean up. You know it is pretty dirty
here to-day, and you do not want your
husband to come home and find it this
way. do you?"
"Baby fretted so."
"I know; I'm not scolding you. You
are going to learn to plan and then
things will go easier. I've been taught
how, you know, and I'm going to
teach you, am I not, dearie?"
"I do want to try. It isn't much use
I am to Mike â him as does so much."
"Yes, you are; he wouldn't change
you for any one."
While the nurse was gone the mother
talked to me.
"Ye know, I was a factory girl, and
when Mike married me he was doin'
well and could hire a woman now and
again to do things, but now the hard
times he can't. He got me a sewing
machine, but I can't sew. I'm going to
learn, though. That blessed nurse is
teaching me everything, and me so
slow."
Up a hill next and into a cigarette
factory.
A boy, sick, deformed, only half liv
ing, sat watching a Chinaman rolling
cigarettes. He himself rolled one occa
sionally, but he was too weak, and a
bad finger hindered. It was bound in a
dirty bandage. His eyes brightt;ned at
sight of the nurse, but at me they
looked coldly.
"How are you to-day, Joe?" she
asked, kindly.
"Pretty well."
"Has your side been dressed to
day?"
"No."
"Shall I do it?"
A young woman limped Into the
room. She was not glad to see us. Her
mother was asleep. No, we could not
see her. She must get dinner ready for
her mother. No; she could dress the
boy herself."
"Nurse wants to do it."
"May I do it if I come back after you
have had your dinner?" said the
nurse.
"Yes, if you want to; but I can do it
myself."
We went away and got some lunch
ourselves, for It was past noon.
"I want you to see that place." said
the nurse. "W r e have tried every way
to get it closed. Dr. Sherman made a
formal complaint to the Board of
Health. Dr. D. has done the same.
Miss Fisher, the president of the mis
sion, has reported it. I have reported
It. But nothing has come of ail the
complaints and reporting."
The cigarettes are made, and a good
many must be sold to pay the rent (sls)
and feed and clothe that family. It is
a question, for the cigarette-making is
their means of livelihood, yet every
cigarette that goes out of that partic
ular shop is laden with disease.

G. \V. LANE â I came near killing a
man down on Kearny street a day or
two ago. He was on the car meeting
me and his hat blew off and he jumped
exactly on my track and fell down. I
Btopped the car just as the guard was
right against him and he got a pretty
bad cut on his head. If I hadn't slowed
down for a switch he would have been
a dead man, and through not fault of
mine or the other motorman, though
probably a suit for damages would
have followed.
That sign "Please do not talk to the
motorman" is one of the best things
that the company ever did for our com
fort, for we have to give our entire at
tention to the track and talking is both
annoying to us and dangerous to the
public.
F. NELSONâ If the stories of the ac
cidents that happen were told just as
HOW I BECAME AN ACTOR AND AUTHOR
I WAS a Seventh Ward youngster,
born in the very heart of William
M. Tweed's old district, and I
passed my childhood in the happy
go-lucky fashion characteristic of
the small boys of that section of
old New York. I don't remember much
about those days now, so much has In
tervened between them and the pres
ent, but I don't think that I was dif
ferent from my companions except per
haps in being a little more go-ahead
and boyishly mischievous than some of
them.
At that time every boy in that ward
<\vns ambitious to be a printer, since
printers received excellent wages and
It was thought, besides, to be a grand
thing to understand all about that es
pecial business, so as soon as I was
anywhere large enough to attempt
such a job I began to work at feeding
presses and such employment and made
quite a bit of money at it, too.
By and by, though. I found this
i rather monotonous and made my w r ay
i to the docks, where I learned to calk
vessels as well as veterans at the
i trade, and some way being among the
ships and around the wharves so much
and hearing sailors' yarns and travel
ers' tales by the score, made me feel
very dissatisfied with my humdrum ex
| istence right there in the city of my
birth.
I was naturally of an adventurous
disposition, fond of fun, excitement and
! change, and pretty stout-hearted with
it all, so one day I made up my mind
I to strike out for myself and see a little
of the world beyond New York harbor.
A few hours after I made this mo
j mentous resolution in my young mind
I I was on board a ship sailing gayly
i past Sandy Hook on my way to the
Pacific Coast, and as I worked my pass
age 1 didn't have time to be home
sick during the whole voyage.
I found plenty of employment at my
trade .of calking here in San Fran
cisco and worked all around the water
front from Rincon Point out. I worked
up at Mare Island, too, for a time, but
mostly here in the city, where I made
a good many friends among the lads
of my own age. My boarding place
was over in what we called "the Val
ley" thenâ it is known as "Tar Flat"
nowâ and a lot of us young fellows
formed a sort of a club and hired a
room in which to pass our evenings
together, and it was there that I first
began to string verses together and
sing them to popular airs of the day.
The boys liked my songs immensely
and thought a good deal of me because
I was always willing to sing and gen
[ erally had something new and fresh
j on hand to amuse them, but I had no
they occur I don't think that we should
be blamed so much as we are by the
public. Now, the other day a little
child between 3 and 4 years of age ran
across my track on Folsom street, be
tween Steuart and Spear, and fell fiat
right in front of me. I managed to
stop the car before the wheels reached
it, though it was clear under the lattice
work, and those who saw the occur
rence or learned the facts from eye-wit
nesses praised me for my coolness and
quickness. Two reporters, however,
got on the car and wanted me to break
the rules and talk to them about it.
and because I would not they said very
wrong and unkind things of me the
next day, and made me feel very badly,
for I wouldn't have hurt the baby for
the world, and even coming near doing
so gave me a great shock.
L. SWEETMANâ If people would
wait till the car stops before they get
on or off it would be a great deal better
for all concerned, but it is a general
practice to jump on and off before a car
is under control, and if anythlnghappens
the blame is laid on the motorman. We
are not clairvoyants, any of us. and it
is hard to tell by the looks of folks
what they are intending to do. Take,
for instance, what happened to me on
Bryant street not long since. A man
sitting on the front end wanted to get
off at Fifteenth and he got up and
stood on the forward end of the step
and then, not waiting for the car to
stop, swung himself off in such a way
that he fell right in front of it. It was
a wonder that he wasn't killed, and
cases almost as bad happen right along.
Men and women both persist in get
ting off the wrong side of the car, and
getting off and running around in front
of the car just as it is starting up
again, to get across the street. If they
happen to be short the first we know
of them is seing their hats just in front
of us through the window, and it gives
a fellow a pretty hard start, too. Then
women have a way, down in the busy
parts of the town, of getting out into
the middle of the street right between
the tracks when they want to take a
car, and that is taking chances that
they ought not, and some people seem
possessed to promenade on curves.
I've seen dozens snatched back by
other persons just as a car was coming
around, and they never seem to realize
what they escaped.
W. J. WAlTESâ During the nine
years that I have been on a car I have
seen accidents nearly happen almost
every day through simple carelessness
or recklessness of pedestrians and driv
ers. Children are continually running
into danger and keep us car men on the
jump. One of my frights was when two
boys on Mission street, near Six
teenth, started to chase each other
across the street. I was going not over
seven miles and rang my gong as hard
as I could, thinking to turn them back,
but they paid no attention. The first
one got over the track all right, then
turned and came back, and though he
saw me he seemed to get confused and
ran right toward me. I turned cold, for
I have children of my own. and couldn't
bear the thoughts of hurting one. but
I knew that it wouldn't do to lose my
head. I remember of deliberately count
ing in my head the notches of the con
troller "one, two, three, four," so as to
make a good stop, and though the little
fellow was knocked down and his head
was under the pilot board, he was not
hurt at all to speak of, only frightened
and dusty, and I tell you I was thank
ful! I am the man that ran into that
laundry wagon over on Alabama and
Twenty-sixth streets â that is, I didn't
run into it. but I came so near it that
there was only a matter of four feet be
tween me and the four children who
were driving it. We have to look out
particularly for such wagons anyhow,
for the drivers are so walled in that
they don't look out for themselves very
well, and so I slowed down when I saw
it coming, but they had the horse go
By Edward Harrigan
thought of making my living through
anything of that kind until the calk
ers' strike came on and I found my
self thrown out of employment. Then
any sort of an honest job was wel
come and when 1 was ottered a small
salary to go on and sing one of my
songs at the Olympic Theater, down
on Kearny street, where the California
Exchange now is, I decided to try it,
and the result was that 1 never went
back to ship-calking again.
All the boys that I knew came that
first night and brought all the boys
that they knew and all that their
friends knew and they handed me bou
quets of raveled oakum over the foot
lights and made things lively generally;
It was all done in a spirit of friendship,
though, and the 1 It that I made was so
pronounced that I kept right on In the
business.
Alex O'Brien waj my first team-mate
and he and I played at the Olympic and
at the old, and afterward the new,
Bella Union, doing l;lack-face special
ties under the nÂ»me of Harrigan and
O'Brien. After that I took up Irish
business with a man named Rickey,
and we brought out "Mulcahy's Twins"
and others of my original si tches at
the Pacific Melodeon on the corner of
Kearny and Jackson streets, and played
under d- Â°erent managements in other
towns.
Making a success of our acts here
Rickey and I and a clever minstrel and
farce actor named Otto Burbank went
to Chicago, where we appeared at tha
Winter Garden, then badly run down,
and pulled the place up to most excel
lent business.
It was in Chicago that I first met
Tony Hart, then a very mdsome,
talented boy and a lovely singer, es
pecially of ballads, which he had been
singing with the Arlingt" \ Minstrels,
then closed. I grot him a position with
us at the Garden and wrote a sketch,
"The Little Fraud," for him and my
self, in which he took the part of a
young German girl. Without any ex
ception Tony Hart was the best female
impersonator that I ever saw, and one
of the greatest of character actors, and
together we did a phenomenal business.
I wrote our songs and sketches and
plays, aiming always at true delinea
tions of character, combined with
wholesome humor, with occasionally a
touch of pathos, and we made a hit
wherever we went.
We played "The Little Fraud" for
one hundred nights in the Howard
Athenaeum of Boston, under John Stet
son's management, and then spread out
on broader lines. In New York we
played at Butler's, Tony Pastor's. Josh
Hart's and other places, and then I
combined a number of our specialties,
stringing them together wfth a thread
of plot and calling the whole "The
Doyle Brothers" we took It from Ban
ing at such a good pace that when they
pulled the wrong rein and the car and
one of the wheels came in contact the
whole outfit went over. The car didn't
touch one of the children, but one of
the papers had it that all four were
crushed under the pilot, and that it was
all my fault, but it was more interest
ing to tell it that way than to state the
honest facts.
J. H. DUKELOWâ We all have about
the same trials I guessâ children play
ing in the street, people walking along
meditating when they ought to have
their eyes and ears in active service,
persons getting off the wrong side of
cars right under our wheels almost, ajid
careless or ignorant drivers. To see the
small boys that are allowed to drive
wagons here is astonishing. If they
can sit on a seat and hold reins they
are given charge of all sorts of rigs,
and though they may do well enough
when there is nothing to frighten them,
if they see a car coming or get into a
tight place, they are just as apt to pull
the wrong rein as the other, and bring
their horse and themselves right across
the front of a car. Grown persona who
are not accustomed to driving do the
same thing, too, and when we run into
them we are the ones that are blamed.
Then there are persons who think it
smart to annoy and alarm us and some
will deliberately walk nut in front of a
car for that purpose, and laugh at us
when we slow down. Hardly a week
passes that I don't get a dead fright
over children, and it does seem to me
that parents and guardians ought to
be made to keep their charges out of
the middle of the street. Children
stealing rides and playing tag off the
pavements risk their lives daily, and
the ones who don't teach them better
ought to have some of the blame when
they get run over. Night runs are bad
for there are so many intoxicated peo
ple and you never know what they are
going to do. Down on Third street not
long ago a man came out of the shadow
and I thought he was going to board
the car. Before I could stop, though,
he walked right in front of me and the
car struck him. I heard the bump and
it frightened me terribly, but as I had
slowed down on seeing him it only
knocked him over. For a wonder he
said it was his own fault, for he had
been drinking and didn't know what
he was doing, but that didn't make the
shock to my nerves any less.
J. S. BUCKâ I came very near being
killed myself over on Broadway last
summer. There were a lot of boxes
stacked up on the edge of the sidewalk
and a boy ran right out from behind
them across my track. I couldn't stop
the car, to save me, until it hit him
and rolled him over, and though he
was only hurt a little a big crowd gath
ered and wanted to hang me right
there. One man pulled a knife, and
altogether I had a narrow chance of it.
You see. people's sympathies are al
ways with the one who gets knocked
down or hurt by the car; they never
stop to think out the motorman's sidÂ«
of the affair, and so it is a rare thing
when we car men get fair play in these
matters.
A. E. OSGOODâ If the public were
half as careful of themselves as thÂ»Â»
railroad men are of them there wouldn't
be any accidents at all comparatively.
I don't believe that there's a man on
the lines who would hit a dog with a
car purposely, much less a human be
ing. We are on the lookout to avoid
trouble all the time, but there Is hard
ly one of us who hasn't had adventures
with reckless or careless persons on
foot or in teams, that just make us
sick with fright for the time being.
Rainy days, when the track Is slip
pery, and fogey days, when you can't
see clear before you. are times we
specially dread, and children running
in the street and newsboys jumping on
and off cars, and sometimes trying to
jump from one car to another as t)y>y

gor. Me., to San Francisco and had
good houses all along the line.
Coming back to New York we leased
the Theater Comique, where wÂ«
struggled along for a year, paying ex
penses but making nothing because the
house had been run down by Matt Mor
gan, one of the greatest scenic artists
and cartoonists that this country ever
produced, who ruined himself by orig
inating and producing "living pictures"
twenty years before his time. His en
tertainments, which were artistically
magnificent, were stigmatized as 'vul
gar" by the public, who years after paid
out small fortunes to persons who
utilized his idea in a much less refined
and pleasing way.
At his old place I began my series of
"Mulligan" plays, ten in number, pro
ducing them as sketches at first and
then amplifying them Into three
act plays, making the charac
ters striking types of the people
in the lower wards of the city,
and I followed these by dramasâ
"Pete," "Waddy Goo-gan," "Old Laven
der" and others. Prospering well, we
built Harrigan and Hart's New Thea
ter Comique and presented there all my
own plays, including "The Major,"
"Squatter Sovereignty." "The Black
bird," "McSorley's Inflation," "Investi
gation," and so on, and in the height of
our success the theater burned down
uninsured and put an end to it all.
After that Hart and I separated and
I took the old Aquarium for a time, but
was fi-rced to build again for the reason
that my success was such that I was
the prey of landlords who wanted ex
orbitant rents from me. I built Harri
gan's, now the Garrick Theater, which
is Mrs. Harrigan's property, and still
the daintiest and prettiest of the city
theaters, and played there for a time
with my son, Edward. After his death,
at the age of 18, we leased the place, as
I had become convinced that the actor
manager â with the exception of Augus
tin Daly, that most indefatigable and
successful worker â has little chance In
competition with the purely business or
speculative manager.
When the Methodist conference at Law
rence, Kans., was almost ready to closo
some of the ministers were disc-using the
appointments and agreed among them
selves that everything was coming out
satisfactorily, the appointments having
all been fixed up. Then another preacher
bade his brethren not to be too sure.
"For." said he, "I was in conference with
Bishop Fowler once and we fixed every
thing up, and then the Bishop asked to
be allowed to commune with God awhile.
The rest of us retired, and from the con
dition in which we found the appoint
ments when we came back, I should say
that, if the Bishop talks with God again
to-day, he is likely to break that slate of
ours into pieces so small we can't w*ltÂ«
our names on 'em."

DREAMERS OF THE

of the year. It ia entitled "'Dreamers

is published in the United States by
Harper & l!r<>s., New York.

All art found its origin in utility. The
first pictures and sculptures were de
signed to tell stories, and at the same
time to decorate buildings, and while
having a mission to perform were yet
Â«Ã¼bordinate to the structure of which
they were a part.
A pictorial representation is apt to

A poster is designed to perform a ser

advertising is subordinate to the ful

I Avertlsing we wish to inform the
world of the existence of a line of goods

Now the- word attractive has also
come to have the same meaning as

the reverse, for we are sometimes held
by the force of something very un

By Emanuel Elzas
an advocate or an opponent of the so
called Jewish state, but that concerns
us not. He has other claims on our at
tention. While yet a mere stripling he
realized that the rose of romance can
and does bloom in the raw air of the
poverty-stricken London Ghetto. He it
was who recognized that the mere tear
ing down of the barriers of irun could
not remove the restrictions placed
around the Ghetto Hebrew by himself,
and he even perceived a humorous side
to the dreary struggle for bread carried
on daily within its confines. Nor was
this all. With bitter irony he painted
the Hebrew when he had grown gross,
exhibiting the Jeshurun, who had
waxed fat and kicked, as merely an
elaboration of the poor East Ender. and
showed through him the fallacy of the
theories advanced for the solution of
the oft-mooted East End problem. Mr.
Zangwill may or may not have intend
ed to act as an interpreter for his peo
ple in their variety; but unquestionably
this is what he did in his first great
book. As a result we were given a pic
ture of such lifelike fidelity and so full
of the true spirit of humanity that the
whole world was moved upon by it.
"Dreamers of the Ghetto" is in the
main a collection of sketches bio
graphically treated. They are written
with all of Mr. Zangwill's descriptive
power. Characters so different as
Baruch, Spinoza, Heinrich Heine and
Zevi, the Turkish Messiah, are depicted
against the back round of the particu
lar environment that constituted the
Ghetto of their periods and countries.
Historical accuracy has been aimed at
with considerable success, and, where
possible, the sentiments expressed by
the several characters hay : been drawn
from their own writings. Some of the

monstrosity ranging from the red or
yellow front of a building to the brutal
and vulgar posters that cover the bill
boards of our cities, and the display
of questionable and unsightly goods in
our shop windows.
But there are some very beautiful
means of advertising also, to which
many of the posters distributed about
our different stores testify, and there
is probably no factor of this time that
has exerted a wider influence In the di
rection of educational art than the pos
ter.
It requires no mean ability to pro
duce a design that shall convey the de
sired idea in an attractive and beauti
ful manner, and many of our very best
artists have legitimately turned their
attention to this new industry.
The designs we see are varied in
character, but, very much after the
manner of the houses that are built or
the bonnets that are constructed, they
are apt- to be an expression of the
thought of the patron -nther than the
idea of the artist, frequently resulting
Now a design may be dignified or
frivolous; It may be refined or the re
verse. It may attract by its beauty
or through its appeal to the morbid and i
unhealthy qualities of thought. It may
tell its story in good composition, skill
ful drawing and satisfying color, or it
may violate all principles of technique
and be bizarre and gaudy.
The poster of to-day generally aims
to combine the language of words with
that of form and color, and the suc
cessful poster is the one in which these
two forms of expression supplement
each other.
To simply letter a crayon or oil por
trait, a landscape or flower study, when
the picture used is unrelated to the let
tering, is but to evade the problem of |
fitness of design for a useful purpose]
and to degrade the art thus utilized.
In looking over a collection of post
ers one naturally questions the artist's
motive in the use of certain elements, |
for very often the treatment of the sub
ject may be allegorical and the forms
involved symbolic.
Much interest was manifested in tha
competitive designs exhibited at the i

of managers of the Woman's Hospital
offered a prize of $25 for the best and i

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 17, 18tÂ»8.
I least tmportarce, are pure fiction, but
the one definite idea runs through
them all, that the character of the Jew,
whether he lived in the days of Ra
' meses or In the days of Victoria, has
! been influenced by practically the same
forces and the same surroundings.
Perhaps the most striking impression
that will be gained by the Gentile
; reader of the work before us is that
Mr. Zangwill has so much information,
', so many facts, so much lore touching
; Jewish matters, that he throws it out,
spttls it a perfect cataract with
i foam and spray dashing ..bout in the
| shape of description, analyses and dia-
I logue, till he is well nigh drenched in
: the torrent of his own eloquence.
It has bee;, said that no one can be
' come a capable biographer unless he
' have a great love or a great hate of
his subject. Adapting this line of rea
soning to the author of "Dreamers "of
| the Ghetto," one is forced to conclude
â¢ that there lives to-day no man better
'' qualified to divine and transcribe the
! footings and sentiments of his brethren
!in faith. He possesses the great love
of his race, tempered with due recogni

when a voice should be raised in its de

One of the most notable of the short
stories in Mr. Zangwill's last volume is

perhaps this is the one that has In

nied by the yellow outward mark.
'. Joseph, the son of Manassoh, has been
i to St. Peter's atttending the midnight
, mass. His impressionable nature is
\ aroused, and its restless cravings after
spirituality are satisfied. He is anxious
to imitate the Christ even to martyr

is, attempts reasoning without avail,

I of his conversion.
Rachel pat on the floor and rocked to
; and fro in an agony of apprehension. The
leaden hours crept along. No one came,
I neither son nor husband. Terrible images
; '>f what was passing between them tor-
I mred her. Toward mid-day she rose and
' began mechanically preparing her hus
band's meal. At the precise minute of
year-long habit he came. To her anx
ious eye his stern face seemed more pallid
than usual, but it revealed nothing. He
washed his hands in ritual silence, made
I the blessing and drew a chair to the ta-
I ble. A hundred times the question hov

ventured to say, "Our son is back. Hast
tbou not seen him?"
"Son! What son? We have no son." He
finished his meal.
Thus is Joseph sacrificed to what
eventually proves to be a vision. Dis
owned by his parents, it only remains
for the inquisitorial Council of Sixty to
render verdict and Judgment, which it
does swiftly.
Joseph ben Manassrh was to puffer the
last extremity of the Jewish law. All
Israel was called together to the Temple.
An awful air of dread hung over the as
semblage; in a silence as of the grave
each man upheld a black torch that
flared weirdly in the shadows of the
synagogue. A ram's horn sounded shrill
and terrible, and to its elemental music
the anathema was launched, the ap
palling curse withdrawing every human
riÃlit from the outlaw, living or dead,
and the congregants, extinguishing their
torches, cried "Amen." And in a spirit
ual darkness as black. Manasseh tottered
home to sit with his wife on the floor and
bewail the death of their Joseph, while
a deatli-light glimmering faintly swam
on a bowl of oil. and the prayers for the
repose of the soul of the deceased rose
passionately on the tainted Ghetto air.
And Miriam, her Madonna-like face wet
with hot tears, burnt the praying-shawl
she was weaving in secret love for the
man who might some day have loved her,
and went to condole with the mourners,
holding Rachel's rugged hand in those
trait Loan Exhibition now on at the
Hopkins Institute of Art.
In studying these compositions one
was forcibly Impressed not only witn
the diversity of thought that one Idea
could suggest, but also with the dit
ferent styles of expression.
While some showed great Imagination
on the part of the artist, others were
only good examples of technical skill.
Some were decorative in conception and
| handling, being simply rendered in ilat
! tones, in good color combinations, while
! others did not quite reach this stand
ard of excellence.
One fact was quite evident, and that
, was that the artist as a rule has little
patience in mechanical work, such as is
i required in lettering, and there were
I not a few cases where the spectator
was permitted to supply deficiencies in
this regard.
The most beautiful design was that of
Miss Louise Schwamm. This young
< woman has repeatedly given us exam
i pies of her ability, and it Is gratifying
; to see her produce something so excel
lent The two beautiful girlish faces
profiled against a broken yellow back
ground are ably complimented in line
and color in the violet iris border above
and In the olive-toned panel below.
The decorative handling of the color
scheme, which is that of contrasted
harmony, and the thought suggested,
make it well deserve the first prize
which was awarded to it.
The second-prize winner consisted of
a sphinxlike portrait of a woman paint
ed in tones of blue green gray on a me
dallion, which made a pleasing contrast
with the broken red background upon
which was placed the lettering of the
poster. The conception of the subject,
by which this talented young artist
aimed to express womanly dignity, was
handled with much feeling.
Probably the most successful piece of
applied design was a very interesting
study in soft yellow grays, by Benja
min Armer, in which two figures repre
senting "Charity" were relieved against
a pair of black wings and enclosed by
some very pleasing conventional â¢ mo
tives. Mr. Armer most surely has a
feeling for breadth of line and symme
try of arrangement. His design was
commended not only for its artistic
qualities, but also for the excellence of
its lettering.
The choice of the designs among the
members of the sketch club was one
soft, sweet fingers that no lover would
ever clasp.
But Rachel wept for her child and
would not bo comforted.
But the dead Jew is resurrected in
the living Christian. The scholarly
apostate is compelled to deliver ser
mons during his novitiate In a large
oratory near the Ghetto. After his ac
ceptance of the monastic vows a Bull
is issued, making it incumbent upon
the Jews to attend his sermons. Rows
of the devout are painfully whipped
toward the church door, and their sober
faces indicate the attention they are
giving to that strange institution, the
Predica Coattiva. Alas! "Joseph the
Dreamer" did not know that, adopting
the whimsical device hit on by a droll,
all these devout Hebrews had wadding
stuffed deep into their ears!
By and by carnival week arrives, and
with it the Roman Hebrew touches the
extreme of indignity, the Jews' race.
Six representative members of the He
brew community are compelled after a !
hearty meal to run a race. To acceler- |
ate their pace, a mounted officer with :
a squad of soldiers gallops at their i
heels. Noble sport, forsooth! On ai
specious pretext it is decided to compel j
the runners to compete again, notwith- ;
standing that a young Jew has been j
tendered the pallio as winner of the !
contest.
One of the runners has fallen un
conscious. The young Hebrew who has
reached the goal first begs for a cup
of water, but no one stirs to give it to
him, and lifting the head of the old ,
man, he finds that he is dead. Then
drawing a crucifix from beneath his
cloak, the young man- announces him
self. It was the renegade. His self
that received honorable mentionâ the
design of Miss Mabel J. Williamson.
This beautiful product represents a well
poised girlish figure standing reposeful
ly in the middle of the Pjetnre, Riding
a portrait in her amis. The subject is
decoratively treated in flat tones and
the color scheme is much admired.
Mrs Arthur Mathews exhibited a
very pleasing study in browns repre
senting a girl observing herself in a
hand glass, while Mr. Joulhn showed a
head of a woman worked in crayon,
and Joseph Strong expressed his idea,
of what a poster should be in an oil
portrait of a woman. Mr. Cxreenbaum
exhibited two water color studies, one
representing some people viewing an
exhibition and the other the interior
of a studio.
Miss Helen Hyde contributed the
study of a chubby little woman gowned
in empire costume inspecting some
pictures. This study was painted on
vellum and was very pleasing in its
monochrome color.
Mr. Nappenback showed some very
skillful drawing and some most excel
lent lettering in both of the studies
he sent, while Robert McKee showed
some very able pen and ink work in
his two examples.
Miss Nellie Treat contributed a very
pleasing study of an old-fashioned
portrait, and Miss Kate Hall's pen and
ink study of a woman looking through
a lorgnette at some pictures is most
excellent in its simple handling. Miss
Mabel Downing's black and white
study called forth much favorable com
ment.
Douglas McClees' allegorical study
had much in it to commend. The
treatment of the background was es
pecially happy. The mass of rich blue
most fittingly relieved a dainty line of
white smoke that subtly wound its up
ward way.
Mr. Raphael's design w s much ad
mired and considerable surpi-e was
expressed that it did not receive some
notice from the judges. It represents
three beautiful figures grouped against
a woodland background arranged in a
series of three decorative nanels. The
design shows considerable conscien
tious thought and effort.
Probably the most artistic design
was that entitled "The Town Crier,"
by Edwin Arnold, a student at the art
school. This is most "postery" inas
much as it suggests the usual mode of
advertising, printing, together with
the consistent use of the materials
from which a poster is made. It is
modest, refined, dignified r nd excellent
in technique. The color schema is that
of analogous harmony and is very sat
isfactory. In this design nothing ui
fends and much pleases. Mr. Arnold's
design was sufficiently appreciated by
the judges to receive hoi.orablo men

sacrifice on two occasions has proved
vain. The Dominican Jew is tried and
found guilty, and is condemned to the
stake.
We shall not quote Mr. Zangwill'fl
powerful description of the Dreamer's
awful punishment, but we cannot for
bear reprinting that horrible drawing
of Joseph's father and mother celebrat
ing the execution.
In the house of Manasseh, the father of
Joseph, there were great rejoicings.
Musicians had been hired to celebrate the
death of the renegade, as tradition de
manded, and all that the Pragmatic per
mitted of luxury was to hand. And they
danced, man with man and woman with
woman. Manasseh gravely handed fruits
and wine t<> his guests, but the old mother
danced frequently, a s^ct smile on her
wrinkled face, the whole frame shaken
from moment to moment by peals of
horrible laughter.
Of a lighter kind, yet, having In its
composition a certain pathetic element.

Pilgrim." Aaron, the peddler, a Russian
exile domiciled in Manchester, has by
dint of much self-denial amassed a few
pounds. He has no family, and deter
mines to spend the rest of his life in an
attempt to establish a Jewish state in
the Holy Land. He broaches the idea
to his associates, and he Is laughed at.
Nevertheless, he makes the journey.
He is on the point of entering the port
of Jaffa, and is in a transport of happi

fathers. Let the concluding para

greatest interest among the members.
The photographs leave no doubt of the
remarkable character of the locality re
ferred to, and no doubt much more of
interest will come to light as the years
BO by.
The most .remarkable aspect of this
wonderful petrified forest is the fact
that many of the trunks are standing.
Some of these are at least fifteen feet
above the ground, and where the trees
grew on cliffs, the roots can be

THE WRITING ON THE WALL
THE recent discovery by The
Call's expedition of the lost
turquoise mines in Southeast
ern California, with the numer
ous untranslatable hieroglyph-
ics on the rocks near tho beds
of precious stone, renews the in
terest that has been spasmodically
accorded to the writings of those
parsed away races that once peopled
this continent.
.Man takes his written histor:es and
goes back a few thousand rears into
the past, and there he finds that his
race was perfect in its development,
even as it is to-day. What transpired
before the historical period has come
down in fragmentary legends about
occurrences during a few centuries
previous and then we find that the
pules bear records of deeds done so
Jong ago that even the memory of tra
dition does not account for the van
ished race. The everlasting rocks bear
the story on from generation to gener
ation and from age to age until every
meaning is almost obliterated by the
changed conditions and environments.
These stone records are to be found
in all parts of the world, but nowhere
in such profusion- as in the United
States. From Maine to Alaska and
from Florida to Southern California,
they are found, constantly telling of
the progress of man. Some are so an
: ient that no man has even a legend to
account for them, while others may
have been the product of yesterday's
labor.
There is no portion of the entire
N'.rth American continent in which
petroglyphfl are not to be found. Is
there .a huge bowlder, v ater worn and
smoothâ there is found some engraved
(igure showing that man tuts utilized it
for a recording place; do canyon walls
rise high and sheer, presenting a suit-*
able tablet for inscriptionâ there are
found etchings made with implements
of obsidian and chert, showing that
man has taken this as a page on which
to write a â¢> â¢â¦'on of the world's his
tory; on cliffs, on ledges, wherever
smooth surfaces are to be found, some
inscription, some writing, some hiero
glyphic notation of the presence of an
intelligent being who had the aspira
tion tn be known to future generations,
is indelibly marked.
Either etched with sharp and flinty
tool, pecked with pointed chert or ob
sidian silver, engraved with heavier
implement of agate or painted with
high mesas that, meeting the sky,
mark a level horizon; a vast area of
table lands innumerable, their fiat
i tups bound round with a wall of
rimrock.
The petrified trees are in the heart of
Virgin Valley, and to reach the valley
one is compelled to go down Hell Creek
Hill. Perhaps that Is why the "for
est" is so little known. That and the
fact that the road thence is simply a
"cow trail." over which but once a
year the "conk wagon" of the fall ro
deo is driven when making its rounds
as the vaqueros are gathering beef for
the great California cattle king whose
stock range it is.

eastern part of that State will take
pre-eminence in the matter of im
portance. The scarred face of a huge

in most elaborate design, of the con

previous nationality.
<Â»n the overhanging underside of this
rock is a series of carvings, which if
properly interpreted might lead to s<.-me
of the most remarkable archaeological
discoveries ever known. It tells the
story of an invasion by men who came
across the sea and of the driving out
of the people who builded the vast
mounds and earthworks which mark
their presence almost across the entire
continent. The point of invasion is
shown, and the line over which the in
habitants were driven is indicated by a
series of birS tracks, the toes pointing
in the direction of the movement. The
invaders were large men, while the
residents were small. Around the pic
ture are numerous figures of mer
maids with many of th>> old style
cheval de frise anchors. Neptune, or
Poseidon, with his trident, rises from
the watt r and Beeraa to direct the
forces of the invading hosts.
Were it the object of this article to
bring out surmises from the petro
glyphs, there is much in this one that
arouses the imagination. Whether the
appearance of Neptune and the mer
maids bears any relation to the inhab
itants of the lost continent of Atlantis
or not will never be positively known,
but it is evident that the people who
etched the history of this remarkable
contest knew of the sea and also of the
ancient god who is the mythological
ruler thereof. Nor is it in this etching

figures which give to the mind of the
student an involuntary impression that
he is approaching the borderland of
that mystery that ha,s puzzled the
world thousands of yearsâ the mystery
of human existence.
Great caution should be exercised in
accepting certain figures that have
been declared recent by scientists as
being in reality the result of contact
with civilization under Christian domi
nation. It is of frequent occurrence
that the Christian cross is found em
blazoned among the grotesque and
unique figures that are etched on the

it is remembered that such a cross was
used as the Toltec sign for the four
winds long centuries before the foot of

the Puebla Indians and also some of
the northern tribes in this same sym- '

The evenings, no less than the days,
in Virgin Valley are compensation for
the trip.
The valley is nnt one belonging to
the lowlands, but lies high in the top
of a mountain range marked every
where by the great lava How. Eight
miles and more in length and a mile
widf, it forms a beautiful meadow of
wild grasses that grow rank and
tall. And down its whole length runs

found in these various petroglyphs are
representations of human, bird and

birds, beasts and reptiles and human
hands. The sun, moon and stars are
also frequent, as is the wave line which
is now known to mean water. There is
also to be found that mysterious fig

jungles of Yucatan to the shores of the
Arctic seas â the sign of the red hand.

For an area of perhaps six miles pet
rified trees are found here and there,
but only very scatteringly. One may
ride a mile or more over low hills of
white earth that yields under foot like
wood ash, and see r.o sign of petrifac
tions, to again come on quite a "grove"
of standing stumps varying from two
to eight feet in diameter, The average,
however, is not over six. The winter
rains eat into the soft banks of the low
foothills that border the valley and
year by year new stumps and logs of
onoenobie pines are being exposed. Few
are agatized, as are the famous trees of
other petrified forests, and many are
white as calcined bones.
The gullies and washes leading down
to the meadow are frequently graveled
with the fine flakes of wood, that, brit
tle as glass, crackle and crumble under
one's horse's footfalls.
Most of the stumps are within a dis
1 trict of a mile square, and there is one
particular portion containing about 150
I acres that is rich in specimens of knots
I and gnarls, and the twigs and limbs
that lie scattered about whichever way
y<>u may turn. A soft earth bank of
'. perhaps five acres shows the end of

A stump eight feet high and of the

Across a little gully made by the
j heavy winter rains a log lies like a foot

which hides the other end. How far it
may reach underground, how tall it
may have been when it fell, we cannot

WOMEN AS LIFE INSURANCE
AGENTS
THERE are but few, branches of
business that the modern woman
has not taken up within the last
score of years.
They have proven to the world that
they can and do work as well, and in i
many cases better than the lords of j
creation. Just now they are invading
the life insurance field and their advent
has brought about some big changes in j
that line of business. It has led to two
things, first, the bnrs prohibiting women
from insuring at the regular rates have j
been let down, and the biggest com- j
panics in tho East have established a j
women's department, presided over by j
a woman superintendent, who judges j
all applications made by the women j
agents. Some years ago life insurance |
companies would not accept women as
"risks" at all.
Mr. Shields, the manager of the Equi
table I^ife, says that women are far bet- i
ter risks than men. "I cannot under- â 
stand." said he, "why the silly law was
rot aJtered long ago. While women are ,
fully as courageous and ambitious as ;
rm>n, they arc more careful and cau
tious. I would rather insure women
than men. Our women's department;
wag opened in January last, a: 1 is pre- \
Bided over by Mrs. Rose Emmons, a !
lady whose business qualifications 1
are well known all over the East, i
Bhe has done a little <>f every- i
thing in a business line, from \
running a real-estate office with !
a dozen employes to superintending a
mine. This is the first company on the
coast to introduce the Eastern innova
tion, and If I have heard correctly
other companies will follow or intend
shortly to follow our example."
Mrs. Emmons herself is a bit sur
prising. After hearing of her wonder
ful success in business of all kinds you ,
would naturally stippose her a large
Belf -assertive woman, who would look
the part of the new woman. But she is
nothing of the sort, for a more womanly i
woman could not be found in this or j
any <'thcr city. True, she wears her j
hair cropped short, and mannish look
ing coat and skirt, but her wearing ap- |
par^l only enhances her womanly face. |
And when she speaks of her children
and her Invalid husband she is all that I
a wife and mother should be, a great j
deal more than some arc. for when ruin \ I
was staring her family in the face she
hnd the courage to go into the world
and battle for those loved ones. Mrs. !
Emmons is very enthusiastic about the ; j
new field for women. "We are not very j
far ta'liirnl the men in this work." she j |
paid. "You know we arenotlimited toin- !
'suring women; indeed, some of the best |
'risks' on men have been brought into
the office by women agents. Yes, we |
have come to stay in this as well as in
many other fields of work. At present | |
I have a dozen women agents under me,
but by the end of the year I expect to |
have fully fifty in different parts of the :

Washington, a Kr^at commander, had
the genius for getting all that was best I
out of the men under him, but the ;
work of or^anizin^ and disciplining the
army at Cambridge was the least of the
troubles which confronted him when he i
faced the situation at Boston. More
over, he knew all the difficulties, for i
he not only saw them, but he was
never under delusions as to either
pleasant or disagreeable facts. One
of his greatest qualities was his abso

SOCIETY
EASTER week, although not so '
prolific in social entertainment as J
the initiated had not only pre
dicted but expected, more than
made up in quality for the lack of
quantity. Elaborate, brilliant af- i
fairs predominated, and the Informal j
gathering was altogether the exception.
Not much in the entertaining line Is
promised for the future, and the season
now may be virtually said to be closed.
Already preparations are being made
for the summer exodus. Those who have '
country places are preparing to take pos- '
session, and there is much talk of house I
parties, according to the prevailing East- i
crn and European style.
Rooms at the various fashionable re- !
sorts are alrenily in great demand, though
pociety as yet has shown no preference :
for any special resort.
The Easter dance Monday evening at j
the Palace was a most elegant affair, and
the dozen university bachelors who acted
as hosts are being overwhelmed with con
gratulations.
On Wednesday Mrs. Darling gave an
elegant luncheon at the Occidental, com
plimentary to Mrs. C. P. Huntington. j
Like all the entertainments at which Mrs.
Darling presides, the luncheon was char
acterized by exquisite taste and elaborate |
detail. Pink and red roses made a most
artistic table decoration.

Huntington, Mrs. Henry 1.. Dodge, Mrs.

in bank on Friday afternoon to hear the
injunction proceedings brought in the
name of the city and county to restrain
Auditor Broderlck from signing the de
mands of thirty-one copyists, fourteen
deputy register clerks and Chief Piper of
County Clerk Curry's office. The suit
was brought by City and County Attor
ney Creswell by authorization of the
Supervisors, on the complaint of Mayor
Phelan that these employes were draw
ing salaries without warrant of law.
The proceedings were dismissed a week
ago, with leave to the plaintiff to amend
the pleadings. The hearing yesterday
was on a demurrer interposed by the
Auditor to the amended pleadings.
After a discussir-i of thu law points In
volved the three Judges sustained the de
murrer and dissolved the temporary in
junction.
The representatives of the city and
county asked that another temporary In
junction be granted pending an appeal to
the Supreme Court. That motion was
denied, and notice of appeal was at once
given.
Auditor Broderick stated after the pro
ceedings that he would not sign the de
mands in dispute until after reasonable
time had been given the city and county
to perfect an appeal.

NEW PASTIMES
For the
SOCIAL SEASON
AFTER Easter Sunday society
will begin to unfold its wings
ready to take flight into the
country. There will be just one
big affrr during Aprilâ the
bachelors" ball at the Palace Hotel.
With the coming of the first May
blossoms the fashionable world and hte
wife will hie themselves to green fields
and rural delights. Drawn blinds and
storm doors will proclaim the family
out of town.
The time remaining before the ex
odus begins will be divided between
the dressmakers, the milliners and
shopping. For the summer outing is
always more or less a dress-up affair.
Last year riding, boating and golf
crowded out all other amusements.
The hops at the big hotels Were dismal
failures. Moonlight drives and strolls
were preferred to tripping the light
fantastic.
A social forecast reveals some new
phenomena on this summer's horizon.
A light breeze of anglo-maniacism is
predicted. It is awaited with pleasure,
for it is not thy malignant sort, but, to
the contrary, promises to be a refresh
ing innovation.
The big hotels and fashionable sum
mer resorts are going to be given the
cold shoulder. Following the example
of our English cousins across the pond,
the proper thing will be to spend the
summer either at your own "place"
or to be an invited guest at somebody
else's "place." It will be one round of
house parties. And the danger of mon
otony is entirely eliminated by the
fact that the summer homes are close
enough together to make it possible to
combine in the jaunts and festivities.
Then, too, the limit of a guest's visit
will be from one to three weeks, so that
there will always be new arrivals to
liven things a bit.
There is no doubt that this is infin
itely more enjoyable than hotel life
with its innumerable cliques, the sacred
inner circle, the cynosure of those on
the outer edges.
All these disagreeable drawbacks are
responsible for the adoption of the
English way of "doing things." A fine
place, a good cook, spirited horses and
a hospitable host â these are drawing
cards that cannot fail to attract. The
much-sought-jifter guest will be the
one who can help the host entertain
and suggest ways and means of ban
ishing dull care. With the country
homes in such close proximity there
will be a spirit of rivalry in getting up
affairs that will assure an element of
originality.
Society has put on its thinking cap
and many are th.* novel ideas stowed
away that will cause a flutter when
they are brought to the light of fulfill
ment. There is always riding, swim
ming, boating, wheeling and golf to
while away the hours with, but the
place that would establish for itself the
title of peer of entertainers will have
to offer its guests something new and
decidedly out of the ordinary. That
is the delightful part of t'if> innovation.
One particularly brilliant suggestion
is a cake-walk cotillon. It would be
impossible to give one in town, but In
the country, where cast-iron restraint
is thrown to the winds, it is bound to
be trie "hit" of the season. At first
thought it is hard to understand Just
how a cake walk could be introduced
in a cotillon. But it is not difficult to
arrange. The first figure is a "follow
your leader" affair. The couples form
a line and follow the leaders only in
point of direction, each couple intro
ducing individual steps and poses. The
grotesque features ' the real cake
lowels! Napkins!

walk are of course left out.
Big hats, fans, scarfs and parasols
for the girls and high collars, stove
pipes and canes for the men are ne
cessary paraphernalia.
Guests who do not wish to partici-,
pate form the audience and give the
required inspiration to the performers.
Any of the figures â  the usual co
tillon can be worked up for the first
part of the cake-walk cotillon.
A half an hour is enough for this
and then the real fun begins. Each
couple is given three minutes alone on
the floor and the modified gyrations of
the "real" cake walk are gone through.
It is safer to have practiced before
hand, but there are those who are
equal to it under the inspiration of the
moment. The little accessories sug
gest postures that are either pretty or
funny, sometimes both. Each couple
endeavors to do something new and if
they have'given it the slightest consid
eration are sure to be greeted with
shouts of laue-hter.
For as a cake-walk cotillon It is by
the amount of mirth produced that the
success of the figure is gauged. After
all have had their turn a short general
figure is executed. With the right sort
of people participating the amount of
fun to be had out of a cake-walk cotil
lon exceeds calculation. And unlik~
any other dance, the audience enjoys it
just as much as the dancers. Once
they get into the spirit of the thing
the couples will not mind doing their
individual "turns," and even if they
do not relish their own there is the
pleasure of enjoying the attitudes of
the next couple. Every bit of the usual
formality Is swept away, and if the
tide of amusement occasioned does not
reach the high water mark, then mirth
is really dead.
A Chinese dinner is another contem
plated novelty. The idea was probably
started by the craze for all things Ori
ental that has taken rooot since the
production of the "First Born." No
expense Is going to be spared in carry
ing out the novel idea to the minutest
detail. The cining room will be decor
ated In a style befitting a mandarin A
frieze of the curious little heads dis
played in the shops in Chinatown will
run all around the room.
Fans, gongs, scr.eens and innumera
ble articles picked up in Chinatown
will help convert the room into Oriental
wonderland. The table itself will be a
work of art and ingenuity. A roll of
the gorgeous red rice paper has been
imported from China and will be con
verted into the table cloth. From the
center of the table will rise an im
mense umbrella, depending from which
will be lanterns of various shapes and
colors, and the soft light shed by the
candles bringing out the vivid color ef
fects. The name cards are on rice pa
per, the name painted both in English
and Chinese, and thrust through one
corner is a miniature chopstick with
the tiny knob of real ivory.
The chef who prepares the menu will
have the viands as Chinese as is pos
sible, at the same time making them
palatable to the Caucasian palate.
The maids who wait at the table will
be got up in the correct Chinese style
shoes, flowing gown, stiffened hair ana
The finishing touch to It all is to be
the music. Just enough real Chinese
discord will be rendered, however, to
make the guests appreciate something
less characteristic, but more tuneful
The dinner will probably be followed
by a travesty on the Chinese play or
something of a similar nature. It wil
certainly be unique enough to cause the
oldest diner out to marvel.
Out-of-doors entertainments will be
very popular. At one garden party
which has been planned the hostess wil
{/if Murphy Building-. J
Martet anfl Jones Streets.
have a stage erected under the trees
and talent hired for the occasion from
the theaters in the city will v.mu.e the
guests. The refreshments will* be
served at little t -a-tete tables placed
within hearing distance of the stage.
An entertainment of this sort could be
given in the eveniner just as well as in
the afternoon and would be even more
effective.
The male members of the family will
probably not need much coaxing to be
induced to attend a "vaudeville tea."
Altogether this season bids fair to
far outshine its sister seasons of former
years.

IN FOOTWEAR
THE latest thing
in the. way .of
footwear is the
- orthopedic boot.
Â» Accustomed as any
lady la to me pointed
toed shoe -made on a
curved last, the new
. boot Appears at first
ungainly. But tue
docton declare that
once used to : them
they will prove not
â only a thing of Joy
but beauty forever.
For once Dame
Fashion is not re
sponsible for a new
style. The physl
cians are the spon
sors of this new
i hoe. Tta< cases of
"flat foot" have be
come so numerous
that they say either
the orthopedic boot
must be adopted or
we will be b flat
footed race.
"Flat foot" Is Just
what the name in
dicates. The bones
which form the arch
of the instep sink
from their proper
position, producing
a strain that is ex
tretnely painful, and.
what is worse, trans
forming the shapely
foot iritoan ungainly
member that might
belong to a Held dar-
Ky of the South.
This Kinking of the
bones is produced
because theshoesaro
made on lasts curved on both sldM
whereas th<- line of the foot Is straight
on the Inside. This unnatural curve forces
the great toe out of position.
The grent toe is of more value in walk-
Ing than all the other toea put together
and when it 13 forced into an unnatural
position It is impossible for it to perform
its full duty.
Cases of "llat foot" wore ifbt so numer
ous when the square toe was the vogue
for, although the shoes. were made on a
curved last, the strain on the big toe was
not so great. When the pointed toe be
\camo the rage doctors predicted direful
consequences, and their prophecies have
been n \liz<-d. .
The "orthopedic boots," which arc madÂ»
> by hygienic bootmakers, follow the natu
ral outline of the foot; that is, the boots
follow a straight line on the, inside and
a curved one on the outside.
In one of the largest hospitals in New
York City thero is a stringent rule de
manding that all nurses employed wear

shoes of this description. The muscles of
the feet are given full play, the great toe
Is allowed to properly fulfill its duties,
and thereby a decided Increase in freedom
and elasticity is gained.
There is a movement on foot to estab
lish the same rule In the Children's Hos
pital in this city. All the; physicians of
that hospital wear the new boots, and are
constantly inducing their patients to fol
low their examples.
One of the leading physicians, when
asked about the new boot, said: "If we
can get people to wear them perhaps in
another generation feet will have re
sumed their natural snape. The distor
tions produced by shoes made on the
fashionable last arc not only hideous but
absolutely incompatible with light, easy
walking and a graceful carriage. There
would be less of that tired feeling' If
properly cat shoes were worn. There Is
a post in the shoe that must bo worn un
til the big toe resumes its natural posi
tion. The post is so placed in the shoe
as to force the great toe to make a
straight line with the foot, and Is placed
between the great tou and the second
one."
The doctors say that we must choose
between properly cut shoes and "llat
foot."
Which shall it be?
PRINCES WHO ARE MONKS.
In the wildest and most desolate part
of the Black Forest is to be found the
most aristocratic monastery in the world.
Almost every monk who has here sought
shelter from the world is of noble or
princely rank, and many are the bearers
of historic names who have done their
part In molding history.
One of the mo-Jt devout and humble of
all its Inmates is Prince Philip of Hohen
lohe at one time one of the chief orna
ments of European courts; and Prince
Edward Schonburg-Hartenstein fulfills
some of the lowliest duties of the mon-

ing soldiers in the Saxon army. Among
other nobles who nave deserted the
sword for the cowl aw Count de Memp
tlrine and Baron yon Salls-Soglio.
â¢\ll the menial work of the monastery is
done by these titled monks, who are con
tent to exchange their brilliant spheres
for a life of solitude and the most rigid j
discipline. _

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 17, 1898.
Pretty Parisian Designs.
Special to The Call from Paris.
THE illustrations represent nearly
all the styles in dress, including
OQtdoor and evening costume, ball
and house dresses, mantles and
garments for morning and even-
ing, cape and cycling costume.
Here is a criticism on them:
If the form of the marone crape dress
is simple, it is stylish and becoming, but
the trimmings are less so. The bits of taf
fetas in marone and white are not pleas-
Ing in effect. I should have preferred a
trimming of taffetas on the cross, a light
passementerie or even a marone guipure
following the movement of the corsage
and of the upper skirt, and also as a
trimming for the skirt.
The shape of the black cloth jacket is
graceful in form, but the collar, which is
very high, swells the appearance at *he
neck. The trimming behind is more be
coming than that in front, and I would
rather not have had the square yoke of
white taffetas.
The mastic cloth cape with four flounces
is quite in the new shap~ which 1 do not
consider graceful, and which should never
be mad* except in light and soft mute
rials. The collar is unbecoming, which Is
the case with all collars as at present
worn.
The cycling costume is exactly what it
should beâ plain, practical and in very
good taste.
The Indoor dress of striped mousseline
de soie is too much of the sacque Bhape,
but the appearance, which is exaggerated
in the sketch. Is minimized by the trans
parent nature of the material. Neverthe
less, it is too much like a chemise, and I
would rather see a waistband round the
iigure.
The white spangled tulle dress is pret
tily composed, and by removing the
gulmpe it can be converted into a de
collete dress with long sleeves. The only
thing I dislike is the rosette on the left
side of the corsage. It appears to me
heavy and useless. I would prefer a
small bunch of pink roses. In a tall
woman the arrangement of the skirt does
very well, but for a short figure 1 would
advise the suppression of the frill of
mousseline de soie around the bottom.
There is no particular feature about the
cut of the green velvet mantle. The
richness of the Japanese embroidery alone
and the harmony of the colors constitute
its beauty. The sleeves, cut in at the
wrists, appear to me rather heavy. I
would have liked them better fuller and
longer over the hands.
The gown by Honnet, 9 Rue de la Paix,
is an outdoor dress in marone crepon. In
the China crape style, with a double
skirt The underskirt is rounded at the
bottom. Hat in front at the top, and very
tight fitting at the sides. The fullness is
thrown behind, and the godets, which be
gin half way down, are behind only.
This skirt is quite plain at the bottom,
and opens in the center of the apron all
the way down, showing a narrow band of
striped and shot ecru marone and white
taffetas the stripes of which run cross
wise This trimming is very narrow at
the waist and widens gradually. The
upper skirt Is set In without fullness at
the waist and widens gradually down to
the bottom. It runs about half way
down each side in front, where it is
rounded, and is prolonged behind to about
forty centimeters from the bottom, giving
the appearance of a tail when seen from
behind. It is ornamented on each side in
front with eight oblong pieces of striped
taffetas like that on the underskirt, one
above another.
The eorsiigo is a blouse of the same
material gathered at the waist, and with
two pleats on each side, which are lost
beneath the waistband. It opens down
the center over a front of striped and
shot taffetas in two bands which appear
to form one with the trimming of the
apron. The front is trimmed on each
side with the same material. The neck
trimming is of orange taffetas covered
with heavy guipure and is very wide: the
collarette Is of guipure. The waistband
is of plain marone taffetas fastened on
the left side with a bow of the same.
The sleeves are made with small puffs
at the shoulders, but are tight fitting all
down the arm. On the outer side are
three small squares of striped taffetas.
The wrists are trimmed with guipure.
The hat which completes this costume is
Of yellowish marone velvet: it Is a toque,
trimmed with a drapery of chiffon, high
est on the left side; a white feather en
circles the crown and there is an aigrette
set in a ntrass buckle. On the brim in
front there is a barrette of strass.
At Red fern' a I have seea an indoor
dress of white mousseline de sole striped
with dead silk. or. wnich arc printed
green and mauve chrysanthemums. This
tight and transparent material is loose
over an independent dress 01 white taf
fetas. The ciress is rather long and mad.>
in ono piece from top to bottom, and
slightly gathered over a â >-oke of spotted
tulle embroidered with violets in Tom
Thumb ribbon. Round tue yoke is a
Greek pattern embroidered in narrow
gathered ribbon.
The skirt Is perfectly straight all down
and Is edged round the bottom with two
rows of embroidery worked in narrow
ribbon. A waistband of mauve taffetas
can, if desired, be tied round the figure,
either over the moussellne de sole, which
would convert the garment into n stylish
Bortie, or over the taffetas dress, which is
very effective, us the moussellne de Bole
dnss falls like a full smock, showing the
taffetas dress confined at the waist. The
neck trimming is of white spotted tulle,
embroidered with bouquets of vloiets,
and the collarette is <â {â  lace, running
round tiie back and sides only, leaving the
neck finite free in front.
The sleeves form small draperies at the
shoulders, over which are epaulets <>f
white moussellne de soie embroider* d
with Greek designs like those round the
yoke, immediately beneath the drapery
Is a circlet of embroidery on each arm.
The Bleeves are quite tight from the
elbow to the waist, very long and em
broidered with Greek designs to the
wrists. â¢
1 also saw a pattern of an evening
mantle in green velvet plush. This gar
ment is made with a yoke, from which
the body falls straight down in front and
at the sides, forming pleats, which widen
gradually all the way. The yoke is
trimmed with braid in undulating ding
onal lines, forming chevrons in front. The
front is ornamented down each sid: j with
broad garlands in Japanese embroidery,
the designs being composed of chrysan
themums and lotus with foliage in their
natural colors. The sides and back are
quite plain.
The mantle is gathered round the. yoke
and is very full, so as to leave plenty of
room for evening dress. The collar is ex
tremely high behind, lower at the sides
and completely sloped away In front. It
is embroidered like the yoke and edged
with a narrow, fluffy ruche of black
mousseline de soie. The sleeves are In
shape like those of children's blouses,
gathered at the inset and full all down.
At Giles", 17 Avenue de I'Opera, I have
seen a dress of large meshed Paris tulle
over a skirt of white poult d soie. The
skirt has a broad apron embroidered with
Sowers in white silk and bright black
spangles, and between the flowers largo
spots of chenille at irregular distances.
The apron is cut into scallops round the
bottom and detached from a flounce of
plain tulle, frilled. The right side and
back breadths of the skirt resemble the
ground of the apron; the left side is com
posed of plain tulle finely pleated. The
skirt is fiat at the top in front and gath
ered behind and at the side. It is rounded
at the bouom ad rather long.
The corsage is a blouse, cut low and
square and gathered at the wast. The
decollete is edged with black velvet,
which is continued into braces both be
fore and behind, and is edged with a
niche 01 white tulle spotted with black
chenille. The body of the corsage matches
the apron. At me fall of the left shoul
der is a large rosette of white tulle. The
neck trimming is a broad piece of black
velvet ribbon simply draped: the waist
band of the samo ribbon, not very wide,
fastened behind with a small straight
bow.
FASHIONS FOR
SMALL PURSES
THE really healthy looking worn:. 1,
man, office or store is so much the
exception that one cannot but won
der if the tired, fagged-out condi
tion may not be due to lack of care
of the oodily health, and particularly to
stiff corsets and heavy skirts hanging
from the waist.
If a woman stands or sits ir-~erly she
will not require, as so many tell me they
do, the support which a corset gives.
A girdle with straps over the shoulders,
ending about ti.ree inches above the
waist, relieves all pressure, which cer
tainly contracts and weakens the vital
organs. Tapes buttoned to the skirts keep
them from slipping down and remove the
weight from t^e waist to the shouiaers.
Try one. and see how cramyed a corset
makes you by the feeling of ease, and
how quickly that dragged-out weariness
will disappear, and you need not look
shapeless, either.*
To keep the skirts and separate waists
together, a contrivance has made its ap
pearance on the coast. Consisting of a
flexible metal belt, about an inch wide,
and hooks sewed to the skirt, it is a puz
zle how, but it does keep that difficulty
well in order, and is perfectly comfort
able.
Leather belts will be worn, but a pret
tier, newer design is two yards of satin
ribbon, four inches wide, to match the
skirt or harmonize With the tie. Pin one
end securely in front and pass the other
twice around the waist, tucking the other
under; hold it in place with a fancy pin.
Hats are literally loaded witn flowers,
some of the smaller ones being made en
tirely of smaller flowers nnd leaves for
the 'crown and brim. Roses wired Into
aigrettes form high trimming on one side.
Purple and white violets use . together
will be very popular, as will also very
natural Scotch heather, tiny forget-me
nots, roses, cornflowers and poppies.
Some of the hats set so far down on the
head as to give the effect at first of being
too big for the wearer, worn down to
shade the face and turned up in the back
over a mass of Â»iowers. Others, how
ever, are worn back over the face; the old
fashioned poke bonnet so becoming to our
grandmothers is among these.
Ties, too, so becoming to some faces, are
to be worn again in big bows at the
throat Bows separate from the bonnet
are very popular, indeed the bigger the
bow the better.
It is distinctly a "one-color season;
that is, the gown and hat and gloves
match instead of harmonize as has been
the fashion so long. Beware, however, of
the chiffon and tulle tucks and folds and
ties which are so soft and becoming. One
good California fog will reduce them to
a thing to be replaced. Although it is so
pretty, chiffon is a thing to be avoided
by an economical woman, for it so quickly
puts on the "soiled dove" air.
In trimming, baby velvet and satin rib
bon are used on every material, in rows
and clusters in different but harmonizing
colors, or all in one color. After a day of
work abroad the great comfort of home
is a wrapper, and its saving in wear on
the street dress will soon make it pay
for itself.
Challie makes a most serviceable and
pretty house dress at a cost of
$2 with perhaps another dollar for lace
and ribbon. A -lainty, pretty gown was
made from challie at six cents a yard,
eight yards being used. Cut with a seam
down the back, the front opened from the
left shoulder to the bottom. The entire
(j reps was lined with five-cent cambric
and bound around the neck, which had no
other collar, and down the front with
white wash silk, a crush belt of the white
ending in a rosette at the under aim
seam belted in the back, leaving the
front' loose, being held in place by tapes
sewed on the inside and tied in front.
Challie Is warm and light in weight and
washes well, coming in beautiful patterns
from fifteen cents to seventy-five cents,
i or dressing sacqiues, too, it is much pret
tier and quite as serviceable as the flan
nelette, which is clumsy and loses its
beauty at the first wash.
ORGAN MUSIC AND BACH.
Organ music reached its climax with
Bach; it may, perhaps, be said that all
music did. At any rate, one thing is cer
tainâviz., if there has been any progress
in music since tne day of Bach it has
been due to him. Bach's music is poly
phonic; and polyphony is true music. To
Its foundation upon this school is due the
fact that there has been no decadence In
music in Germany. â¦ â¢ â¢ There has
been no advance in polyphony since the
days of Bach. Such advance as nas been
made has been in originality and boldness
of modulation.
For pure organ music, Bach still is and
probably will always remain the greatest
of all composers. Even with all the mod
ern mechanical appliances that have been
attached to the organ, his works are still
very difficultâ perhaps the most difficult
of organ compositions. He must have
been as great an organist as he was a
composer. That he should have been
able to play upon the organ of his day
works so exacting in technique as his
own is simply marvelous.
It is one of the phenomena of musical
history that, while orchestral operatic
and other branches oi music were in their
infancy in Bach's day, and have devel
oped since then. Bach brought organ
music t^ Us climax.
SACRIFICED LIFE
For a
LILY WHITE PAGE
SOCIETY women who use the dead- J
lv arsenic wafer for th com
plexlon are increa; ng in numbers, j
According to a prominent phy
sician of this city.
Thougr a: ;enic is known to be harm
ful, "madame of society" forgets this in
her earnest search for something to
take the place >Â£ the legendary Foun
tain of Youth. When the first tiny
crow's feet begin to appear she is sud
denly reminded to take stock of her
charms. L.ate hours, rich food and want i
of proper exercise have done their :
work.
The muddy complexion must be
driven away, but not at the sacrifice of
social dissipations which sum up her
happiness. Somebody in her set sug
gests arsenic.
"But it's poison?"
"Oh, no. Don't take too much of it.
It is large doses you should guard
against."
A few weeks pass before the effects
of the slow poison are visible. The
clouded skin has gradually given place
to whiteness.
No unpleasant symptoms result for a
long time, and the consumer of arsenic
waters is thrown off her guard. When
the evils do cmc she does not for a
moment attribute them to the proper
source.
The first effects of the arsenic wafers
is to gradually destroy the small blood
vessels in the skin; therefore unnatural
whiteness, which a delicate rouge is
called in to relieve. Long continuation
of the use of arsenic brings many ills
in its train. The digestive organs be
come sadly out of order; loss of appe
tite follows, and madame finds her body
is wasting. She sits before her dress
ing-table and gazes sadly at her white,
attenuated countenance, with its fast
increasing defects. Late hours and
imprudent eating all get the blame.
Her physician is not informed of th>
arsenic wafers and other prescribed
drugs therefore increase the disturbed
state of the system. Convulsions, loss
of sleep, headaches, rapid heart action,
delirium and other terrible symptoms
are the result often of a continuation
of the habit.
Worse calamity of all, madame's lily
white skin, like the flower it resembles,
is not lasting in its fairness. If she is
wise enough to guess the cause of her
illness and confesses it to her medical
adviser, she may be relieved. But she
will by that time have destroyed her
appearance to such an extent that she
will never regain what she has lost.
SINCE MAN TURNED COOK-
"Who knows," the new woman cries to
day,
"But 1 was somewhat hasty
When- I forswore the married state?
Some men can turn out tasty
And tempting dishes when they try;
And matrimony's looking
Less prisonlike. I must confess,
. Since men have turned to cooking.
"Should we for single blessednesa,
Beloved sisters, thus band
Against the solid comfort and /â¢'-.â¢â¢
Convenience of a husband - â¢
Who'd -minister to each with cupÂ»
Of timely tea? Nay! Frates,
Come bake and broil for us and watcV
Our lares and penates!
"When from the pulpit or the bar.
Or busy mart or bucket
Shop, weary woman comes at night,
What most uncommon luck it
Would seem to find a man around
Who'd keep the kettle boiling,
And incidentally could keep
Her temper, too, from spoiling!
"Oh, man's improving, there's no doubt.
And soon he'll put a stitch In
Decadent stockings now and then,
As well as mind the kitchen!
To-day I'm more than half inclined
Toward Love, wno's gayly crooking
His finger, beck'ning me to turn
To man, who turns to cooking!"

had time to shave him and leave
bunches of hair here and there." â

TEACHERS AND SCHOOLS.
Some may claim that the old subject of j
the aim of education has been worn
threadbare, and yet It is astonishing what
ever-changing view? on pedagogy and the
ideas on the new education are coming to
the fore in the school world: how fre
quently even now the topic crops up ior
discussion. , . I
In order to ascertain the general trend
Of thought on this subject and also in re- !
gard to school discipline in San Fran- j
cisco, the following questions were-sent
out to a number of our representative
educators, with the annexed results:
1. What is the ultimate aim of educa- ;
tion? . ....
2. What are the objects of school dis- I
cipline? , mâ  . â  i
Miss Jean Parker, principal of the \
Broadway Grammar School, replies as
follows:
1. [appiness; good citizenship.
2. Obedience, Bince perfect freedom can !
come only through obedience to the law.
A. E. Kellogg, president San Francisco
Teachers' Club:
1. Taking education in its broadest
! should >ay that its ultimate end is
grow in the individual a sufficient mo
tive, an efficient will, and the fullest in- :
sight to realize himself in and through
the community of his fellows as It ad- )
vances toward an infinite ideal. School j
education works toward this end by ;
bringing the pupil to assimilate certain j
selected materials of human expei fence.
2. In answering the second question I ;
take "discipline" to mean the whoie op
eratlon of school government an 1 routine.
The end of school discipline is, then, to i
bring the pupil to an intelligent apprecia
tion of the relation of the individual m
ttid community, and to s< ;ure in him a j
willing and habitual co-opeiatior. toward I
the general good.
â¢ â¢ â¢
A. L. Mann, principal Denman School:
1. I should suy that the ultimate aim
of education is the training of thÂ» body, |
mind and soul of the pupil so that he
may be prepared to discharge perfectly I
every duty, private or public, that shall i
be incumbent upon him.
The school alone cannot accomplish al: ,
this. The home and society have each an
Important share In the work; but the !
school should keep this ultimate aim
in view, and so direct its efforts that tl.c
desired end may be attained as nearly is ,
]>"ssible.
2. The obiects of school discipline are j
determined by the work of the school.
That work cannot be efficiently carried
on unless many excellent qualities of '
moral character are well developed. |
Pupils must be obedient, respectful.
St, punctual, diligent, faithful, con- |
siii. rate of the rights of others, self
sacriticing and able and willing to work I
in harmony with others for a common
purpose. A little reflection will convince j
any one that the ordinary exercises of the j
classroom cannot be conducted with the ;
best results unless the moral traits above
named are deeply engraved upon the [
pupils' minds. Thus the discipline of the ;
school even more than the intellectual j
training given therein contributes to the |
attainment of the ultimate aim of educa- !
tion.
Madison Babcock writes:
1. The ultimate aim of education de
- upon the point of view from which
you approach the Question. From the
standpoint of the State it should be to
make an all-around, high-minded, patri
otic citizen. From the standpoint of the
individual the ultimate aim of education
is to make him of most worth to himself

ORDER OF THE AMARANTH.
At the mooting of Crescent Court in
the Red Men's building last Wednesday
nieht the royal matron presented to the
court a specimen of her Jjandiwork in
the shape of a white silk banner with
bullion fringe. On the face of the ban
ner she had placed in oil colors the sev
eral emblems of the order, which are
symbolical, and when grouped together
in the artistic manner they are on this
ullk. produce a fine effect. The gift was
received on behalf of the court by the
royal patron, George W. Drew, who
made a very 'miirf-ssive response and
then placed the banner in the keeping of
Henry M. Owens, the- honored herald.
The banner was very much admired by

2. Correct school discipline leads to |
correct habits and all-around self-control. â¢
In a broad sense every proper school ex- I
erclse Is discipline.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Waiter X. Bush, principal of the Poly- j
technic High School:
1. There are so many types of educa- i
tion growing out of the needs of Individ- |
uals in our complex society, each type i
having its distinguishing characteristics. '
that it is far easier to say what the ulti
mate aim of education is not than to say
what it is. There is a type for the hew.r
of wood and another for the man whose
wood is hewn for him. The special train-
Ing necessary for the first would be worth
less to the second. When the *-riter was
a boy a good hand and a general knowl- .
edge of figures were sufileient require
ments for office work in any of the largi
factories in the East. To-day boys in the \
same relative position, drawing the same ;
pay, are required to have a broader
knowledge of affairs and special training
in stenography, English and typewriting.
The manufacture ajid Introduction of ma- j
chinery of Intricate and delicate construc
tion has made education in the elemen- I
tary principles of mechanics; heat, light j
and electricity, Indispensable even to the
Journeyman.
While these types are changing to meet
the changing conditions of our civiliza
tion the common aim of tb,em all is to
give man power to battle successfully
with the conditions about him. This power
may carry with It culture and social im
portance or it may not, Its quality de
pending upon the breadth of the type he
has followed, the selection of which is
determined by the power of the will, ca- j
pacity for self-denial, by ambition, by i
the degree of freedom from pressing j
want, and, most important of all per- !
haps, by his inherited tendencies, which !
break down all obstacles and drive htm '
Into broad fields of study and research. !
An education of this type should aim I
to secure not only mental power and
growth, but the ability to discern clearly
the source and significance of moral law
and its application to man in regulating
his conduct toward his fellows. In other
words, the ultimate aim of the highest
education is not only to make a man fit :
to encounter severe conditions of com- '
petitive living, but to assist him in his
approach to the fundamental truths of !
the natural and spiritual world.
2. School discipline changes the char
acter as the school changes its grade
from the primary to the grammar, from
the grammar to the high.
At the tender age of the child, when .
the mental faculty is limited to the work '
of the memory and its perceptions, un
questioning regard for authority is help
ful and necessary to it. As the child
grows older, and its power of comparison
gradually enables it to understand and
appreciate character, the arbitrary dis
cipline of the lower grade becomes less 'â 
essential to its development. Its respect
for the teacher grows out of the latter's
healthy mental and moral attitude
toward the child.
A teacher of negative character, of
weak or odd personality, no matter what
support lies behind and outside him, no
matter how profound his knowledge of
his subject, may mar but cannot fashion
the life of his pupil.
School discipline for students attending
our High Schools should be incidental to
the work of the school. It should serve to
assist the pupil to a better mental devel
opment, but not be emphasized as essen
tial to successful school work. The word
"discipline" is too strong. If a school

PROGRESS IN ALAMEDA.
The parents' and teachers" meetings
conducted by Principal Hughes of vie
t.ncinal School, have been productive of
much good to the district. A lively in
terest In educational matters is notice
able. A desire to have the broadest and
most advanced instruction in the gram
mar schools has led many of tae parents
to study the foremost Eastern systems
in order to discover wherein their own is
deficient, and more than all, the close
co-operation of teachers and parents Is
advantageous to both in the highest de
gree.
Several weeks ago, as previously re
ported, the introduction of sewing into
the Eneinal School was discussed at a
meeting, and a committee was appoint
ed to investigate ne system, especially
in the San Francisco schools. So enthu
siastic was the report that at the next
meeting the parents present authorized
the same committee to go before the
Board of Education and request leave
for the experiment to be tried in the
school, all necessary expense beint* borne
by the parents directly interested Per
mission has since been granted, and the
ladies of the committee, together with
Principal Hughes and City Superintend
ent Sullivan, will meet Immediately in
order to arrange the present course of
study, so that it will include sewing in
all the grades.
This is a good start for Alameda in the

Schools." His points were well taken

MR. WORK'S ADVICE TO WHIST PLAYERS,
"Mr. Work, what would you advise our play
ers to do to improve their team work?"
Answerâ To my mind the best method of im
proving team worn is for a team after it has
been selected, to as frequently as possible
practice together. That is, the four men sit
down at a table and play a hand, retaining the
cards in front of them as in duplicate play,
and then as soon as the hand is played re-play
It with the cards all face up exactly as played
originally, but whenever a play occurs the
wisdom of which is doubted by any one of the
four, or in regard to which any one of the
four desires anything said, the replay is stop
ped and the situation and the correct play i
at that time thoroughly discussed. This sys- >
tern of practice has many advantages. It en
fcblea each member of the team to realize how !
the minds of the other three act under certain
situations, and what they are apt to do. It >
brings up points on which there may be any
possible difference of opinion, and if thoroughly
carried out. results almost invariably in the
four men in the end playing a very similar ,
game. I do not believe that there is any other
method of practice that approaches it, or that
a team preparing for an important contest
can do too much of it for its own benefit.
Or course before starting this sort of practice
a system should, be agreed upon which is sat
isfactory to all, but it is not of so great Im
portance what the system may be as that the
members composing the team thoroughly un
derstand It. are satisfied with It. and unite
in the effort to produce the best results from
the use of it. '_

QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS.
President J. H. Todd of the Oakland
Board of Education, in summarizing the
work of the city school department for
the past year, reported that the most
important feature before the board wan
the advance in standard of educational
qualifications required for teachers.
Continuing, he said: "But, in my mind.
that is not so important in selecting a
teacher for a school as that element
which develops the character. It is very
difficult to find just the individual to im
part or develop in the mind and heart
what we call character. That is much
more important than simple instruction
in the several branches of study, and Is
the most difficult to secure."
In these sentiments President Todd has
indicated the tendency of a movement
which is rapidly gaining momentum in
educational circles, and which promises
broader and deeper and higher and in
finitely better things for the children of
our public schools. That education
means merely an Improvement of the
earning capacity has been too much the
dominant idea of those who control
school affairs, and the unsatisfactory re
sults of this have set men to thinking.
After all, are not culture and character
the essential factors in enlarging the ca
pacity for human effort in the direction
of all truly useful as well as worthy and
lofty aims? This movement indicates a
reaction from the painfully practical to
the higher ideal in education.
It means that the child who has been
rightly taught will understand that the
true value of an education is not to en
able him to wear better clothes and :Â«â 
dwell in a finer house and to work 1> ssjÃ
and at easier tasks than his fellows, lo*
teach a child those things which will en
able him to become financially helpful
and self-sustaining is worthy of the best
efforts of the teacher, but the narrowing
down of an education to these mertly
practical ends, without proper ideals of
conduct and without motives which make
possible a higher material and spirtual
life, is fraught with gravest dangers 10
the individual, to the State and to hu-
manlty.
Well-equipped buildings, carefully ai
ranged courses of study and systems of
grading are desirable indeed, but they are
only secondary, while in the fitness, the
fidelity, the efficiency, and, above all. the
wholesome personal influence of the
teacher, is the vital element In the train
ing of the pupils of our public schools.
It is a gratifying indication of the rec
ognition of the value of tti" culture quali
fication in teachers when boards of edu
cation give expression to the thoughts
quoted from President Todd. With the
closer discrimination in the selection of
teachers which such opinions imply there
will surely come more satisfactory and
sympathetic relations between all the
people and our publlo educational sys
tem.
It is well to remember that the puhllo
pchool system is our protection against
greater dangers than those our country
may be exposed to from armored cruisers
of hostile nations, and upon the quality
of the teaching service of these schools
no patriotic citizen can afford to be in*
different. A. MEGAHAN.

of the clubs of Boston at the Sixth Congress:
"You are without the pale of our Institution.
and you must step down and out." The club
was expelled. When the time comes that we
have to blush with shame for taking our sons
or daughters Into a whist club and be obliged
to say to them, "This Is where we come to
spend our evenings; but it is no place for
you." we say the proper course to pursue Is
to cut the cancer outâ lf not. hang out the
yellow flag.
GOOD ADVICE TO WHIST STUDENTS.
By Lander M. Bouve of Boston.
To beginners, or players of limited expe
rience, the numerous new plays and systems
which have been developed during the past
year or two are undoubtedly confusing, and
tend to discouragÂ« students of whist in their
efforts to learn the game. It is not good
policy for any but the most expert players to
attempt to make use of the various new plays
exploited, as even the originators of many n{
these inventions admit that to a. larye extÂ»r.t
they are experimental. The advocates of the
long-suit game believe that the present more
or less unsettled condition of affairs is but a
forerunner of a return, by many of those now
attempting to demonstrate the value of these
so-called improvements, to the established
game as set forth by our most prominent
writers. If beginners will conscientiously
master the American lead?, and the plays
which are the basis of the long-suit gam'?,
they will find that as their experience grows,
they are able to hold their own against many
of the later ideas. The main factor of success
Is to make one's play easy for partner to
understand, and It Is an oft remarked fact that
many of the most brilliant players work their
partners so hard that it is a relief to the latter
when the game is finished. This is entirely
unnecessary, particularly if players will give
partner the assistance possible by means of
the number-showing leads, uniform plays un
der like conditions, and consistent following of.
the straight long-suit system.
BREACH OF ETIQUETTE.
We have been asked a good many times
"If It was allowable In whist clubs for a per
son to bold his cards and play them from
below the edge of the table."
In answer to this query we will say: There
is no written law to prevent such action; It
is only a breach of whist etiquette. The unwrit
ten law Is that the offender is usually Invited
to hold his cards "above board" so the hackft
of them can be seen by every one at the
ble- if he declines to do so. he has no standing
in respectable society, and he is usually in
vited to tender his resignation to the club.
Two such cases that we know of came up in
one of the Eastern clubs some time ago. and
one of the two was expelled, for he was caught
In doing what the very act suggests.
DOES MR. TRIST LIVE IN THE CITY?
At the Trist Duplicate Whist Club rooms
the other evening one of the most enthusiastlo
members of the club was entertaining as a vis
itor a gentleman and his wife from one of the
across the bay whist clubs.
Among other interesting things he was show
ing them, he called their attention to a very
large circular picture, made in the shape and
form of the emblem of the A. W. L., contain
ing some twenty portraits of the officers and
executive committee of the league. He pointed
out with considerable pride the central photo
graph, the father and founder, Mr. Eugene S
Elliott; also President H. A. Mandell. ex-Pres
trtent Theodore Schwarz, ex-Prealdent Walter
H. Barney, the great C. D. P. Hamilton. Rob
ert H. Weems. Vice President E. Leroy Smith
B. F. Richards, and others. Then he points!
to the one whom every child in the whist world
knows only to love. Mr. Nicholas Browse
Trist, mentioning his name with a sort of rev
erence, when our guest asks, "t>oes Mr. Trist
live in the city?"
WHISTLETS.
The Whist Editor of The Call has just re
ceived a letter from Lieutenant-Colonel Elliott,
Third Bengal Cavalry, Fyzabad. Oudh. Ben
gal, India, asking for a copy of The Call's
"Whist Don'ts" and "Whist Whys." The Call
will be delighted to send every Indian a copy.
We have sent several to Spain, but they don't
seem to have had the desired effect.
One of the oldest rules in whistâ in vogn<
over a hundred years ago â required each player
to place his cards in front of him, just as is
done to-day in duplicate whist.
J. A. Sublette of the Office Men's Whist Club
of St. Louis, Mo., Frank H. Goddard of the
Worcester Whist Club of Worcester, Mass.. and
D. W. Stroud of the Toledo Whist Club of To
ledo. 0.. have been sojourning in San Fran
cisco and making themselves at home in the
rooms of the Irist Duplicate Whist Club, where
every whist visitor to this city is welcome.
The Friday afternoon play of the Ladies'
Whist Annex to the Trist Club, which haÂ«
been so popular all winter, will continue
through the summer months. Mrs. F. Freder
icks, the secretary of this little organization, J
has changed her address to Belvedere. '
We have received an Inquiry from Miss Flor
ence Greene, secretary of the Woman's Whist
League, asking information in regard to the Â»
"Ladies' California Whist Club." if any one '
knows of such an organization in this city or
State a favor will be conferred on us by send
ing a list of its officers and members
The Canadian Whist League will hold Ha
annual congress In July at Toronto, Canada.
Further announcement will be made in TheWHY IT IS WISE
TO PAY SEVEN DOLLARS FOR A
MELBA SEAT.
r?y this time next week every oper
atic and theatrical entrepreneur with a
ivc e;ir to his business will have heard
â )f the thousands <>f Golden Westerners
*ho paid their little $7, $6, $5 and $4
md bo forth to acquaint themselves
with th^ musical personality of Melba.
And this should do us a deal of pood;
strengthen the legend of San Fran-
Jfsco'a appreciation of expensive enter
talnments (especially her practical, pe
runlary appreciation) with a few im
mediate facts, and generally boom our
reputation In the little offices on Broad
way, whore now our past prodigality is
almost forgot and we are held in none
too excellent affection. As one whoso
business and pleasure is considerably
mingled with the theatrical and musi
cal Interests "f San Francisco, I am
hoping heavily on this visit of Melba's.
Not that it, individually, is likely to
give us anything strenuously artistic
Â«n either opera or ensemble â that could
nardly be hoped for in the performance
peras whose attractions are, at this
o'clock In the development of dramatic
music, dependent almost solely on the
magic of a voioe and the glamour of
a name â but its financial success will
advertise- to the world and to ourselves
the possibilities of San Francisco as a
market for high-priced entertainments.
We need the ad.
For a long time now indifferent
shows indifferently patronized at the
higher priced theaters have attracted
attention to the bigger business accom
plished by tlio cheaper ones. These
cheaper theaters, the only ones that
kept up with whatever idea the public
has of their standards are, as a matter
of course, patronized; while the East
ern managers who bring vaudeville
and tenderloin farces, one after an
other, to what many persons still re
member as our one serious theater,
profit but slimly. if at all, and gf away
With the idea that this is "a cheap
Bhow town," never taking V .1 account
the fact that many of the old Baldwin
patrons who care only occasionally for
vaudeville (and never at all when it
has the tenderloin twist to it) have
been compelled to give up playgolng
altogether, because they do not know
where to look for the sort of drama
that pleases them.
I think it rankly unfair that San
Francisco should accumulate an unen
viable reputation for, cheapness merely
because si. persistently ref- :es to ac
cept as steady diet a class of theatri
cal entertainment that bears as little
relationship to sane drama as an un
dergrouAod dancehall does to contempo
rary Bocial commerce.
And while a one-star performance of
Verdi's "Travlata," even with the great
est Boritura singer in the world to as
: irgetfulness of the absurd absence
of 'iramati' allusion, may not be as no
ble a cause for â¢ xtravagance as is, say,
the regular symphony season or th>
single performance at Beethoven's
Ninth Symphony at Fritz Scheel's ben
efit, it certainly is the legitimate oeea
â A of excitement In
a city where opera is preciously loved,
where anything but ordinary singing is
th>i rare exception, and where Melba,
the acknowledged empress of her
sphere, has never sung before. The Cal
ifornia Theater Is practically sold out
fur the three nights, I am told by the
management, and an extra perform
ance, made up of single acts of other
operas, Is under consideration. The re
ceipts for the four nights would be
nothing short of $30,000â a pre!*'- com
fortable showing for a comparatively
small and one-star organization.
Then there is the opera-house ques
tion, which comes up every time opera
is mentioned in San Francisco. Every
body knows that if we had had an au
ditorium sufficiently large to house a
grand-opera audience the best Melba
seats would have Bold for about half
of $7 with equal profit to the promo
ters; that long before now we would
have had not only Melba, but the De
Reszkes, Calve, Eames, Placon, Bish
pam and all the big stars who parti
cipated in the high-salary crime at the
Metropolitan. I used to read those
burning editorials on the evils of high
salaries and the inartisticness of stellar
glorification written by the satiated
opera experts of the New York news
papers and gasp with envy.
At that time New York had th^ pick
of the operatic world. Nothing was too

! gond for her; in fact hardly anything
I was quite good enough. She could hear
j Wagner, Gounod, Meyerbeer, the old
! operas, the elderly and the youthful,
\\ ith an ideal cast and an ideal leader
i for eachâ and at prices not much great
i er than we "have paid to hear organiza
tions whose very names were unknown
in New York; and yet she protested on
| grounds not only economic, but artistic.
, I used to read all about it and
wonder just what would happen to the
i man who would criticize opera in San
Francisco from a like standard of ex
cellence.
For many years we have been utterly
out of it so far as opera is concerned.
We h;ivÂ«- h;ul the r.gular reasons at the
Tlvoll, the terrible invasions of Mad
ame Tavary, the operatic concerts of
Nordica, the little French company and
the little Italian company, and we have
come to have a very decent acquain
tance with lots of valuable works â but
not since the last farewell of Patti have
we heard the human voice divine such
as is promised in the singing of Melba.
The operas in which Melba will ap
pearâ"Traviata," "The Barber" and
"Lucia"â are anciently familiar; her
company is not the one that offended
the anti-high-salaryites in New York;.,
but the Voice which will sing the meas
ures of Violetta, Roslna ai.d Lucia is
reputed the greatest for those roles that
the world now knows. So let loose the
flower, fashion and treasure of the town
for Melba â and some day perhaps they
will think bettor of us in New York;
and who knrrws but some day some
dare-devil millionaire of our own will
build an opera-house of stone and
brick on solid ground in place of the
gaudy edifices of adjectives and ex
clamation points that are erected every
week or so in the newspapers.

Here's a musical story that the musi-

: about, writes Acteon Davies: "Last
! week at a concert uptown the audience
' was called upon to rise and sing "The
Star Spangled Banner." All the au
dience save one man sprang to their
feet and began to sing. Noticing this
a man seized the sitting one by the
arm and cried: "What's the matter,
old man? Why on earth don't you get
us and sing?"
The sitting man drew himself up
haughtily, and whether there was a
twinkle in his eye or not perhaps will
never be known. However, his reply
was:
"I do not think it would be at all the
proper thing for a member of the Even
ing Post staff to sing 'The Star Span

critics, in which he alluded to the
American play reviewers as "that Amer
ican herd," the dramatic critic of the
Baltimore American soothes the feel
ings of the British satirist with this
story:
"A certain actor â we'll mention no
names â met, in the course of his artis
tic wanderings in a certain town 'in In
diana, a young man who was intro
duced to him as a newspaper man. In
the course of conversation allusion was
made to some police affairs, and the
actor asked the young man if he were
police reporter on his paper, as he
seemed to take great interest in the
subject. 'Police reporter? Oh, no!'
replied the newspaper man. 'I have
only been on the paper a short timeâ
I haven't gat as far up as police re
porter yet; I'm only dramatic critic' "
With apologies to an unremembered
poet, the Philadelphia Record rises to
remark:
Slay Irwin, it is true you're stout and in your
teens no longer.
'Tls tru^ your charms are opulent and mel
low;
One can't deny your healthy voice Is Just a
trifle stronger
Than that which charms the average sort of
fellow.
And yet I do protest you win my honest ad
miration â
The cause of which effect's extremely simple-
You make mo think of some plump baby, crow
ing in elation.
That beams jocundity from every dimple.
Your fun is of the wholesome sort that passes

Your full-niiMin face is halm for any sinner;
Your rogulsn jests, your jolly songs, facilitate

And make one feel the better for his dinner.

Opera.
Verdi's "La Traviata" has been se
lected for Melba's opening on Tuesday
night because it not only displays Mel
ba in one of her most famous roles, but
because it is said to find excellent in
terpretation at the hands of her sup
porting company, and of the three
works in the present repertory makes
the best showing as a production. The
story of Dumas' lady of the camellias
is an old one and well known here, both
in its dramatic and operatic forms.
Those who have heard Patti as the
tuberculous heroine cannot but have
happy recollections of the part snd a
natural desire to hear it sung by the
one who now universally is acclaimed
Patti's successor. Salignac, a Parisian
tenor, will appear as the hero. Cam
panari, an Italian barytone of reputa
tion, will be the father. Signor Bim
boni, who directs, is one of the very
foremost of Italian opera leaders.
The following is the "Traviata" cast
in full:
Violetta Mme. Metba
Flore Mme. Van Cauteren
Amrriiia Mme. Matfeld
Alfredo Muns. Salignac
Germoiit Bfg. Campanari
Barone Vivian!

The second performanc tal-es place
on Thursday night with "The Barber
of Seville" as the bill, one of the most
playful and b'jnnrous of the old stand
ard operas. It is said by many that
Melba does her finest work in the part
of Rosina. This is the cast for "The

The only dramatic novelty of the
week will be offered at the Columbia to
morrow night in the shape of a farcical
| comedy by Glen Maedonough, who
' wrote "The Prodigal Father," called
i "Delmonlco's at Six," in which Marie
Jansen, who for years was a strong
comic opera favorite in New York is
I the bright particular figure.
Here is the plot of "Delmonico's at
Six":
Dr. Hamilton Clark, a physician, and
his young friend, Captain Holland, who
I is in love with the former's daughter,
i go out on a lark and come home late.
j Clark thinks his life is too tranquil.
j and in order to create a breeze at home
| purchases a photograph of a stage
! celebrity, places it where his wife can
| find it, and then dictates a letter to his
j friend saying that he is to dine at Del
j monico's at 6 with the famous vaude
ville artiste, Trixie Haselmere. The
letter is left where his wife can find
it. Clark sows a mild breeze, but reaps
a cyclone. He repairs to Delmonico's
at the appointed hour and meets Trixie
Haselmere, who has accidentally heard
of his plot and determines to punish
him for using her name by carrying it
! out to the letter. The wife arrives upon
the scene and complications ensue in
quick succession. Other characters are
a dime museum strong man, a French
waiter, who poses as a Count, a sawed
off detective and a maid who is too
smart for anything. Miss Jans^n's
company includes Clarence Montaine,
Harry Beresford, Mack Charles, George
Fell, Frank Caldwell, Mrs. F. A. Tanne
hill. Miss Sylvia .Lyndon, Miss Jessie
Bradbury and Miss Elice Bertram.
BaldWirv.
Hoyt's tenderloin celebration, "A
Stranger in New York," continues all
of this week at the Baldwin. A week
from Monday Ferris Hartman and the
company which he has brought from
New York will give us the first pro
duction in America of "The Purser," a
farce that has been very successful in
the British provinces. The scenes are
on an ocean steamer, bound from Lon
don to Australia, and the characters
are the captain, the ship's doctor, the
purser and other officers of the vessel
and the passengers. Mr. Hartman will
be seen in the title role, a ,part which
it is said suits his peculiarities to a
nicety. The English scene models have
been sent to this country and will be
followed exactly.
Alcazar.
"The Strange Adventures of Miss
Brown" has taken so well with the
Alcazar audiences that it will be con
tinued another week. "The Gay Pari
sians," one of the very cleverest of re
cent farces, arid one that was a big
success at the Baldwin last season
when Charles Frohman sent it out, will
follow. L. R. Stockwell and Howard
Scott have been engaged for the pro

aganza roles he ever has attempted,
and with Thomas C. Leary as Tinbad
the tailor and Phil Branson and Bob
Mitchell as Hokey and Chokey, the
heavenly twins, the fun is fast and
furious. The ballets, under the direc
tion of Miss Christine Stockmeyer, are
most attractive, especially the dance ol
the precious gems in the second act.
Nearly every night new material ia
introduced and new verses added to
the topical songs and ensembles. This
week Carrie Roma will sing a new
song, "To My Love," the words by her
self and the music by R. F. Tilton.
Morosco's.
The first three acts of "The Diamond
Breaker," which will be Morosco's at
traction for next week, take place in
the Alleghany mountains, the closing
scenes transpiring in New York city.
Squire Alden has incurred the enmity
of the "moonshiners" and is murdered.
The squatters take possession of his
lands. His daughter, Rex, on reaching
womanhood, commences legal action,
for the recovery of her estate and is
seconded in her efforts by her lover,
Walter Warren, a young inventor. Thus
far the "lot has been exciting, but later
developments become simply lurid.
Walter is cast into the gaping jaws of
the diamond breaker, which is an im
mense coal crusher. From almost cer
tain death he is rescued by Rex, who
makes a thrilling slide for life to ac
complish her heroic purpose. She in
turn is spirited away to an insane asy
lum, where the torture of the whipping
post, meted out to her by the villain,
and the hideous vagaries of her insane
companions, drive her almost frantic.
She is rescued by Walter, who enters in
the disguise of an Italian. There la
enough of the intensely thrilling about
the plot to give the ordinary auditor a
nightmare and tickle the "gods "' to
death. Scenes of wild enthusiasm will
doubtless be the order for the week.
Orpheum.
The Hyde company of vaudevillers
have scored a large hit at the Orphe
um, where they remain until after the
Saturday night performance. Although
the list of people stands the same sev
eral of the turns will be changed.
Helen Mora will have new descriptive
snngs, Mclntyre and Heath a new
black-face skit, and Williams and
Walker several new songs and gags to
introduce in their cake-walk. Thorne
and Carlton, Charles R. Sweet, the
piano tramp, the Great Lafayette and
the supple Ajax will continue in their
original specialties. Hyde's is the best
all-round vaudeville show the Orphe
um has offered in many a day.
California.
Edward Harrigan closes a successful
week of "Old Lavender" with to
night's performance. Next Sunday
night a local production of "Trilby"
will be given in the California at cheap
prices. Frederick Paulding will be the
Svengali and Fannie Gillette the Tril
by.
Ghutes.
The open-air and indoor attractions
at the Chutes include Wallace, the
"untamable lion"; Jolly, the docile ele
phant: Chiquita, the condensed Cuban
patriot, and a big variety bill in the
Free Theater.
Olympia.
The Olympia Music Hall, in addition
to the usual string of talent, will have
the Martelles, trick bicyclists, and
Mandola, the master of equipoise, in
an entirely new line of tricks in bal
ancing and juggling while poised on
the revolving globe. Others on the bill
are Chevriel, trick violinist; Harry Ell
wood, female impersonator, and Mac
Tunison, soprario.
Gorvcerts.
The many musical and other friends
of Alfred Wilkie, the well-known tenor,
will tender him a "testimonial benefit
concert" on Friday evening, April 29, at
Sherman & Clay's Hall. 223 Sutter

been arranged, and the prospects are

Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high " means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather: "low" refers to low pres
sure and Is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure Is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is Im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. April 16.â The tone of to-day's
stock dealings, while dull and depressed, gave
no very active Indications of apprehension. Tt
was rather a waiting market, as for some time
past. Thp transactions outlsde of operations
by professionals were insignificant. Selling by !
traders found few seekers, and prices conse- i
quently yielded very readily. On the other j
hand, when the professionals turned buyers |
they found few stocks offering, and prices con- !
sequently equally recovered. Naturally the net j
result* of this kind of Juggling from one hand ;
to the other and then bade again was not
large, though the day's price was pretty wide. |
The opening decline was due to sympathy with I
London, where Americans all showed a heavy j
tone and where Spanish 4's relapsed after yes- I
terday's recovery, closing within % of the low
est price made- last Wednesday in the bear
raid. Eurov>oan operators had apparently lost
their confidence In the efficacy of the reported
project for concerted mediation l>y the powers.
The active preparations being made by the
United States admonished observers that the
Congressional differences over the technicali
ties of the Cuban resolution were not expected
to Interfere with the substance of their action
Involving armed intervention, and some slipht
recoveries In the second hour were due to cov
ering by the aborts, but they were not held,
ami the list showed net declines in nearly all
cases, for the most part confined to fractions.
Tobacco absorbed a large rÂ«art of the deal
ings and suffered a loss of 9 a ii on very heavy
offerings, brought out by the recent jump in
prices. Sugar, the Grangers and I'nlon Pa
cific preferred were the other most active fea
tures, but the market was very narrow.
The decline of gold from I^ondon has raised
the discount rate there and stiffened exchange
on London at Continental centers, but the gold
movement to New York continues Without
signs of abatement. The conditions thus dis
closed, combined with the large liquidation of
Indebtedness known to have occurred In the
country, give confidence in the ability of the
financial fnbrlc to withstand the shock of war.
Transactions, aside from call loans for money
wait on the clearinc of the situation, and
partly also on the expectation of a Govern
ment loan. Hut apprehension of the effect of
war 0(1 money and business Is appreciably less
than three weeks ago. Therefore, while prices
are between 1 and 2 points lower than a week
auo, they are very substantially above the
low point touched just 'previous to the presenta
tion to Concress of the Maine Board of In
quiry report.
The market for railroad bonds has been in
tensely dull and prices lower. Government
bonds are lower, declines In the bid price
reaching 2* In the new 4'h coupon, 2 in the
coupons. I' 4 In the new 4's registered, W. in
the old 4'B registered, 1 In the old 4's coupon
and % In the s's.
Total sales of stocks to-day were 1X3,500

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. April 16â The Evening Posfs
London financial cablegram says: Pending the ;
result of the vote on the Cuban resolution In \
the I'nlted States Senate the markets here are ,
dull and stupid, with lower prices. Consols j
were to-day i^Ui per ctnt lower. Americans j
were from .Vic's sl lower, with no business do- |
ing. with business following Wall street. Span
ish 4s were about 42S-
Cables from New York report an impression
In that market that Americans are chiefly
manipulated now from London. This must not
be confused with operations by English specu- ,
lators. Such manipulation as exists in this
market is on behalf of New York operators.
The money market was easier to-day.

BERLIN. April 16â During the early part of
the day business on the Bourse was weak.
notably bank shares, Italian securities and i
American stocks, owing to the continued arma
ments.
PARIS. April 16.â The opening of the Bourse |
here to-day reflected London's weakness. Real- I
izations ruled, speculators were anxious to re
duce their open accounts, owing to the uncer
tainty of the outlook, and there was a further
heavy decline in the price of Spanish 4b, a re
sult of the news that the Senate would not
adjourn until the Cuban resolutions were voted
upon. Rentes. Brazilians. Italians and Rus
sians were also materially lower. Rio Tlntos

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT. .
NEW YORK. April 16.â The Financier says:
Despite the heavy and continued demand for j
funds from the interior and clearing house â 
banks, according to their statement for the
current week, they were able not only to hold I
their own in the way of cash, but added over |
$2,000,000 to surplus reserve, making the latter
Item the largest reported since January 1. In
the light of present events, the statement must
be regarded as favorable, since it reveals the |
wonderfully strong position of the banks. Ordi
narily it would mean lower money rates this
week, but unless a pacific solution of the Span- 'â 
tsh crisis presents itself, no such reduction may
be anticipated. The operations of the week I
brought about a shrinkage of $7. 697. W0 in loans, j
due to continued liquidation and the entire ab- \
sence of new business, the banks confining ;
themselves to the needs of their own cus- :
tomers. Out of town banks, it Is worthy of I
note, are doing some buying in this market, j
tempted by the stringent rates. Deposits were j
reduced $6,637,600. owing largely to withdrawals
of balances. The interior movement is shown :
In the loss of $3,824,200 in legal tender. Specie
imports account for the gain of $4,554,400 gold,
and the net result was an increase of nearly
three-quarters of a million cash.
The loss in deposits lowered the reserve re
quirements $1,579,400. This, added to the caÂ«h
gain, swelled the surplus as above.
The country has now imported or engaged
| over $60,000,000 of gold, but the New York
banks to-day hold only $2,000,000 more cash I
than when the movement started. The specie
received has merely replaced the withdrawals I
1 by interior banks, and It Is a problem whether ,
the futura demand on New York will be aa
! heavy as ftntlelpated.
Domestk- exchange Is at a heavy discount at |
interior cities, and from all that can be learned '
the cash withdrawn is not being employed at
I home. The fact that outside Institutions are
; loaning money here Is not without significance.
' The outlook favors continued imports of gold.
â  and these, with the heavy disbursements made
I by the treasury, may operate to produce an
I easier state of affairs. It would not be sur
: prising if present rates proved to be the maxl
! mum for the year. The country has so much
! money that It Is prepared to meet expenditures
of an extraordinary' magnitude without embar
i rassment. The trouble now Is that this is be
; ing hoarded, rather than put into use.

V CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April 16.â Traders In wheat were
treated to a genuine surprise at the opening.
In spite of all the selling done here yesterday,
millions of bushels by the lonK Interests, and
notwithstanding; the drop of 3c a bushel In
July, all foreign markets rami> higher. Liver
pool In particular whs strong, showing ad
vanceH ranging from ' B Â»tu %d. A feature of
the advance at Liverpool was the fact that the
July price there was 25c higher than the pre
vailing price in this market, or considerably

above the average shipping rates. New York
reported that acceptances of wheat in all po
sitions made by cable from there yesterday
were the heaviest of the season, practically
everything offered being taken. It was evident
from this that the belief In war overshadowed
everything else In the minds of the foreigners.
The opening trades in July were at from 85%@
85%e, against 84%<?84%c at the close yesterday.
For a moment or two the market hesitated.
Then it commenced to advance, and for forty
five minutes the buying demand was simply
enormous. All classes of traders came Into
the market for wheat. It was not a one-man
market ; the demand was general and broad.
Not until the price had advanced to 87% c was
there any marked selling pressure. This price,
however, was well above calls, and selling
against these privileges, coupled with liberal
realizing of a general kind, put a stop to the
advance and caused the market to recede
slowly to 86% c. Apparently by this time the
demand for wheat had been pretty well satis
fied, for although the market reacted to 87Vic.
it was done slowly, the latter point not being
reached until about 11:30 o'clock. During the
last half hour of the short session the mar
ket was comparatively quiet but firm, with
prices keeping within a \c margin. The clos
ing price for July was 86% c.
Corn .was strong from the start. May closed
%<if%e higher. Â
There was an active general trade In oats.
Prices closed rather easy. May closed Vs@Vic
higher.
Provisions were very dull. War talk and the
strength of grain markets caused a small
early advance, which wa.s lost later under sell
ing by local packers. The close was steady.
May pork H%c lower, May lard 24c higher and

HAY AND FEEDSTUFFS.
The only changes yesterday were an ad
vance In Straw and Oat Hay.
Alfalfa Is on Its way from Arizona, but as
it costs $16 here It will not affect the market
much. It costs the same to lay the same
: grade down here from I'tah, and as the sup
; ply from both these quarters will be limited
i we cannot expect much relief in these direc
| tlons. Nor can Oregon send us much of her
j Hay, so we may have to depend on our own
| crop after all. The outlook, therefore, is for
fancy prices for the next twelve months, as
! far as can be seen at present. The State was
< never so hard up for Hay before.

WANTS COMMON SENSE.
French literature wants the saving
element of common sense. Nothing
could be more brilliant than Victor
Hugo in 1830. His verse flashes like
the white plume of Navarre. His was
the most famous charge in literature.
The courage and brilliancy of "Her- j
nani" and "Ruy Bias" are prodigious, '<
but they lack common sense. They j
conquer, win deafening applause, be
wilder men with excitement, but, vie- j
tory won, they have not the aptitude
for settling down. The great French
literature of the romantic period did
not dig foundation, slap on mortar or
lay arches in the cellars of its house
after the English fashion.
Next to Victor Hugo, not counting
Goethe, the greatest man of letters in
Europe of this century is Sir Walter
Scott. Mark the difference between
him and Hugo. Scott's poetry and no
vels have a vigorous vitality from his
common sense, and therefore they are
ingrained in the trunk of English lit
erature; the fresh sap of their romance
quickens every root and adds greenery
to every bough. Victor Hugo is pas
sionate, imaginative, majestic, power
ful, eloquent, demagogical, but he does
not stand the hard test of squaring
with the experience of common men. â
March Atlantic.
"Well, James, how are you feeling to
day?" said the minister to one or his
parishioners, an old man suffering from
chronic rheumatism. "You are not look
ing as brisk as usual."
"Na, sir," replied the old fellow sadly,
"I've been gey unfortinit the day."
"How, James?"
"Weel, sir, I got a letter fra a Glasco
lawyer body this mornln' tellin' me tha
ma cousin Jock was died, an' that he had
left me twa hunner poun'."
"Two hundred pounds," repeated the
minister. "And do you call that hard
luck? Why, it is quite a fortune for you,
James."
"Ay," said the old man sorrowfully,
"but the stipid lawyer body dinna pit
eneuch stamps on his letter, an' I had a
hale saxpence to pey for extra postage."

TOM'S RIDE
UPON A
BALLOON.
BY FRANK HARROLD.
SAN FRANCSCO.
THJSRE was great excitement in
the little country town of Vernon.
Everybody was all in a llutter to
the great balloon that had come
that day. Boat up into the air with a
load of human freight. The balloonist
had set his tent In a field, and was go-
Ing to make ascensions on the follow
lay. The next morning, bright and
early, there had â¢â  sembled around
Farmer Thomps n's field a crowd of
Â«. ;id children of the little
â .a t" witness the spectacle, which
was t>> them very rare. The great bal
loon was already filled with gas, and
was tugging at a large cable which
was attached to a small engine.
"Any one who wishes to ride will pay
fifty cents," Bhouted the balloonist.
The basket was *<Â»jn full. Several as
censions were successfully made and
thi- basket was full every time. Hut It
began to grow windy after awhile: and
the way the balloon tugged and Jerked
was enough to frighten the timid. As
v continued to <nrow more and more
windy, the aerona- t announced that he
would make only '>ne more ascension.
Now, there was one little boy in that
crowd wh.i had a great lovt- for ad

just th'-n a great L-'ist of wind came,
which made the- balloon li>; over on its
Bide.
Tom clung to the ropes like a leech
until the balkon righted. Th"n to his
horror he saw that tin- edges of the
feole in the bo .om of the balloon's
basket, where the cable passes through,
had worn the cable a , Teat deal. As
the wind was continually rising the
balloon swayed fr r* side to side, every
time grinding th : cable against the
sides of the Holes and wearing it away.
The ball ><>nist did not know of this or
be should not have let Tom go up.
"Pull mo "own as quick as you can,"
shouted Tom at the top of his voice.
Tli.- balloonist, being used to hearing
from a distance, understood Tom and
gave the ord^r to his assistant.

Then came another, which was fol

the balloon shot upward in the air like
en arrow from a bow.
A terrific shout went up from below.
The aeronaut snatched up a speaking
trumpet from the cord and shouted:

with all his strength and then could

from the people and was Rearing along
in the air over fields far away from
the dear ones at home.
At Umee the wind would bear down
nn the balloon, and at other times the
balloon would start up as if to pierce
the heavens. At last Tom's grasp was
laid "ii a thin cord which was flapping
about wildly and he pulled it. A
strong hissing sound followed which
Beared Tom and then the thought came
t.> him that he had discovered the valve

again pulled it. The balloon at last

intr, but did not lower any. except from
the "md. He pave another pull and
felt the balloon descending. A cry of
joy escaped his lips, and he pulled stili
harder. The balloon, of course, losing
bo much gas, 1 iscended rapidly, fright
ening Tom so much as to make him

When the balloon got within a hun-
dred feet of the ground it fe.l no more,
but swept rapidly along through the
air. Tom dared not pull the cord any
more for fear of the balloon collapsing
on top of some tree. On swept the bal

thought his end had come.
As the balloon neared the tree it rose
gradually and the basket brushed

Hut as the balloon was drawing

below caught in the- branches and held
the balloon fast. The balloon being too

his trouble to always get his mother's
consent before he did any hazardous
action.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 17, 1898.
THE WRECK
OF A TRAIN
BY FLOYD SMITH
SAN FRANCISCO*
IN the spring of 1882 a special freight
train started from Casa Grande to
Yuma. There were twenty-four
empty boxcars, one car of merchan
dise and one of cartridges and powder
for Fort Yuma. After passing Mohawk
Summit for a few miles the road is
nearly level to Yuma. The crew had
been out eighteen hours and were near
ly all tired out. They had left Yuma
in the morning and were returning
with the special train. The train was
running very fast after leaving the
summit and the fireman, being worn
out, asked the head brakeman to fire
for him, after which â¢ the exhausted
man fell asleep on the seat.
The speed across the fiat was about
twenty miles an hour. This part of
the road was raised three or four feet
by banks of sand. The brakeman was
shoveling coal into the fire very fast,
when suddenly the engineer called,
"The bridge is burnt," and jumped out
of the window. The brakeman, drop
ping his shovel, shouted to the fire-
THE CRITICAL MOMENT ARRIVES AND FRANK KIMBALL STANDS BEFORE A FIRING SQUAD.
man, "EJ. Ed," as he jumped from the
gangway.
Many thoughts passed through the
brakeman's head as he turned over
and over. He could see and hear cars
mashing, jamming and piling on top of
each other and he wondered what had
become of the fireman. When he
stopped rolling he thought he was
killed. The engine and twenty-four
cars had piled up in the creek and he
was under the whole mass of burning,
creaking cars. He managed to crawl
out without help, getting nothing but a
slight scratch. He thought of the fire
man again, and with the help of the
other hands "Ed" was extricated from
under the burning mass. When taken
out the fireman's clothing was all on
fire and he was burned so badly that
he died shortly after.
The engineer had got out through
the window and was slightly scalded.
The two brakemen and the conduc
tor who were in the caboose were bad
ly shaken up, but not seriously in
jured.
The bridge was a thirty-two-foot
trestle, and in some manner the tim
bers had all been burned from under
neath. When the engine struck the
bed it was going very fast. The pilot
hit the bank on the other side so hard
that the engine turned right over on
its back.
After the fireman had been taken out
the men uncoupled the caboose and
ran it away from the other cars, which
were on fire. They tried to get the car
with the cartridges and powder away,
but could not, as it was on the edge of
the creek and pulled tight by the cou
pling of the other cars. The men,
never thinking of the danger of the
powder getting lighted by a spark,
opened the car and put the powder and
cartridges into the end farthest from
the fire. Then they worked very hard
until they had covered the car with
sand. Of course this was slow work,
and one end of it was badly burned.
Not until the work was over did they
realize that at any moment they might
have all been blown up.
A man was then dispatched toYuma,
about eight miles away. At 6 o'clock
in the morning the wrecking train ar
rived. The Yuma Indians came to get
what booty they could, but they were
peaceable and disturbed no one.
The tired men had to lay another
track around the wreck so that the
regular trains could pass.
It was an experience none wanted to
repeat, and r . connected therewith
were so frightened that they never re
called the accident without a shudder.
This is a true story-
The war spirit has evidently taken
strong hold upon the boys. The stories
by the girls deal with much milder
themes. They are varied and pleasing.
The names of the judges will be an
nounced next Sunday.
BOSE SAVED
HIS
MASTER.
BY FRANK McCARTHY,
LOS. ANGELES.
GOOD-BY, Bose; God bless you;
now go!" .
The speaker was an American
boy in Cuba. He was born of
Spanish parents in California. He
had reached Cuba as a stowaway. His
skin was dark. He sp. ke Spanish flu
ently. The Spaniards in Havana took
him for a Cuban. He was brought be
fore a man In uniform, who asked him
some questions and then ordered that
he should be sent to one of the camps
of reconcentradoÃ. Frank Kimball was
not the boy to be downcast even there,
surrounded by starving men, women
and children. To repay his courage
Base, a dog that had voyaged with him
also as a stowaway from Key West to
Havana, found his way to the recon
centrado camp.
Frank Kimball's friends did not know
what had become of him. The captain
of the American steamer Starlight
would help him, he knew, if possible.
Frank had already seen enough of
Cuba to satisfy his curiosity. Here was
Bose! Frank threw his arms around
the dog's neck whsn his canine friend
came to him in his trouble. Quick
witted, the lad hastily penciled a note
and fastened it beneath the dog's col
lar. "Good-by, Bose; God bless you;
now go!"
The dog seemed to understand the
boy. It was dusk and no sentinel no
ticed what had happened. Hardly had
Frank ceased to speak when the dog
disappeared in the gathering shades of
night. Straightway Bose found his
way to Havana; as promptly he plung
ed overboard, and under the frowning
guns of Morro Castle swam to the
Starlight as she lay in the stream.
Luckily the dog was seen and was
taken on board.
Bose would not be kept out of the
captain's cabin. Hs scratched at the
door until Captain Newcomb heard
him. The dog acted so strangely and
was so much excited that Captain
Newcomb knew that something was
the matter.
"Bose, where is Frank?" asked the
captain.
The dog knew- the name of Frank
and barked. Captain Newcomb, who
had worried because Frank, to whom
he had taken a strong fancy, had not
returned to the Starlight, watched
Bose carefully. He saw a piece of pa
per under the dog's collar.
"This is bad," he said as he read
what Frank had written. "There is
no time to be lost. I have heard that
the Spaniards will shoot suspects to
morrow. Perhaps he is threatened."
An hour later the bell of the 'Ameri
can Consular Office in Havana was
rung. Consul General Lee came to the
door. Captain Newcomb told what he
wanted. General Lee went with Cap
tain Newcomb to the office of General
â  â , the Spanish commander in
chief. There a pass was procured for
Captain Newcomb and an order to the
commandant at the camp.
"Speed," said General Lee, "for the
boy will be shot at daybreak, unless
you get there in time."
At daybreak Frank Kimball was
marched, with several others, to a wall
to be shot.
"Hurrah for the American flag,"
shouted Frank in the presence of im
pending death.
The Spanish officer scowled.
"Ready!" he commant! jd, and the
rifles of the guard came to a deadly
aim.
My country, 'tis of thee,
Sweet land of liberty.
Clear and strong the words and mel
ody rang on the damp morning air.
The Spanish commandant raised his
sword.
"Fire!" he said. -But at that moment
Captain Newcomb came upon \ the
scene. He shouted, when at some dis
tance, and the soldiers, hesitated. That
pause saved Frank's life. : : ... -. â¢.

PALE FACE
WAS BRAVE.
BY ALFRED LAWSON,
SEATTLE.
WHITE boy no good. Indian boy
brave. Pale face boy weak like
girl.
I will own that this stung my pride.
I was passing the summer on an In
dian reservation in the Northwest,
and, being a good shot, a fast runner,
a deep diver and a passably good
horseman, I thought that I had the re
spect of the Indians. But here was an
Indian boy, younger than myself,
taunting me with being weak and also
a coward!
"Have a care, Buffalo!" I said. "Per
haps you will know more soon!"
"Ugh!" that was all the answer the
Indian boy would make. I did not say
any more then, but held my temper
and waited.
Huffalo and I went out hunting to
gether not many days after this con
versation. Both had fine horses, and
we \*ere well armed with the best re
peating 1 rifles. We soon struck the
trail of a deer and rode after it hot and
fast. Soon the track of another deer
joined in with those of the first one,
and it was clear hat they were going
toward water or a halt lick, and that
there would be a herd of deer there.
The horses scented the game, and,
with wide nostrils, took in the spirit of
the chase.
I was on my mettle. The words of
Buffalo had not ceased to rankle. I
pushed on and soon had the satisfac
tion of seeing the Indian boy losing
ground. Now my horse was a nose
ahead; now a length: then I lost ';ight
of Buffalo. I knew that I had a better
mount than he had â but not much bet
ter. He quickened his pace, and the
sound of his horse's hoofs came nearer.
Suddenly I realized that I was alone.
Turning in my saddle I saw that Buf
falo's horse had fallen and that he was
down.
Buffalo was smiling when I rode back
to where he was. He could not move.
He had broken some bones. His horse
had a broken leg, having s ppec! into
a prairie do-g's hole while going at full
speed. Twenty long miles to the Indian
camp and only one horse to carry us!
Not one! As I leaped from the saddle
and went to Buffalo to help him a
low, moaning sound came across the
country lying between us and the
buttes beyond. My horse pricked up his
ears, sniffed the air sharply and turn
ed and ran off, homeward bound, and
we two were alone on the plain; one
of us hopelessly disabled and some sort
of wild beast or wild beasts co-ming.
"Wolves! White boy save himself!"
Buffalo smiled even as he told me to
go away and leave him to his fate,
which would be to be torn to pieces by
wolves while still alive.
"Can you use your arms, Buffalo?"
"Yes, I will do very well. Follow
your horse and be safe."
I made no reply. The time had come
to satisfy the Indian concerning my
courage. Half an hour passed before
the wolves were up on us; but it seem
ed an age. I was standing and Buf
falo was sitting when the brutes began
to circle around us, looking for a safe
place to make their attack. They were
hungry, half-famished brutes and as
fierce as one can imagine them to have
been. There were at least fifty of them.
They howled and snapped, their teeth
horribly.
Although Buffalo was in great pain
with his broken bones, his aim was per
fect. He smiled as wolf after wolf fell
before his bullets. But the continual
banging did not scare the wolves. They
were after Buffalo's dead horse, which
might be better to eat than their fallen
comrades.
Before our bullets were all gone two
wolves attacked Buffalo. With a shout
I leaped to his side and rained blows
about me with the butt < f Buffalo's

Crack! Crack! Crack!
Help had come. Indian braves rode
up, firing as they came. The wolves
were at last frightened and ran. That
night we were once more in camp.
Had I proved my courage enough to
please Buffalo? "White boy just as
good as Indian boy," he said, as we re
clined by the campflre a fortnight later.

THE PERIL
OF A
MOUNTAIN.
BY HOWARD BLACKMAR,
BERKELEY.
i*"^ HARLIE and I were tramping In
the Sierras two years ago. We
Uwere just out of the â - High
School, and we thought that we
were bi" 1 enough to look uut for
ourselves. We went up on the -cars to
Inyo County and there unloaded our
traps and started on foot with a pack
mule to carry our tent and camp outfit
and provisions over to Mount Whitney,
which loomed up immensely in the dis
tance.
Charlie knew a manat Independence,
and he agreed to be our guide just for
friendship's sake. He had known
Charlie's father and mine also. "So,"
he said, "it seemed as if he was to go
along with his own, some way. "
Of course we were glad enough to
have him with us, for when we really
saw Mount Whitney, it seemed easy to
get lost there, notwithstanding the well
beaten .trails.
We never got to the top of Whitney.
We went up the mountain some dis
tance and camped. The very night we
made camp Bill disappeared. He left
his gun and some other belongings. We
followed down the trail some distance
the next morning to look for Bill. Two
miles from camp we came to fresh
tracks made by a bear. After going
another mile down the mountain we
saw blood. Then a little farther on
were signs of a struggle. The bushes
were broken and there were rags of
cloth and tufts of hair.
"Man arid bear fight," said Charlie.
That was my idea of it. There was
n<> difficulty in following the course of
the battle. The bushes and grass
looked as if some heavy body or bodies
had rolled down the steep grade. We
followed on until we came to a high
precipice. There was no doubt that
something had fallen over here into a
deep ravine below. A rag fluttered "on
a twig hanging over the precipice. The
rag was brown, the color of Bill's
hunting coat! And Bill? We looked at
each other with dread. Had- Bill fallen
over the precipice? If not, where was
he?
Charlie was game all through.
"I am going over the cliff and search
for Bill!" That was all he said. We
went back to the camp and got a rope.
Charlie tied one end around his waist,
and when he had passed the rope
around a tree I took hold of the other
end. Charlie swung boldly off and
dangled in midair, while I let out the
rope slowly.
Fifty feet or so down there was a
shelf of rock. Charlie rested there an
instant. Then he sent up a great
shout: "Pull up, Jack, for your life."
I pulled with all my might and none
too soon. A bear ran out along the
shelf of rock, and, half famish.'d. tried
to seize Charlie. My brave chum did
not forget even then the use of a pis
tol. Hardly had he swung out pendu
lum fashion from the precipice wall
when he had his pistol ready. Back
he came on the swinging line toward
the bear. It was a beautiful sight.
Charlie did not fire until he was close
in, and when he pulled the trigger he
had such good aim that the bullet
pierced some vital part of the bear, and
the monster foil into the canyon below
with a final roar.
I pulled Charlie up. We were just
shaking hands when we heard a voice:
"Purty good stuff, you two; and
I thought so from the first. Just like
your fathers."
It was Bill!
"I wandered away last ni^ht," he
said, "and fell in with a wildcat, and
we had a little brush, and I killed him
and threw him over the bluff."
The next day we got a longer rope
and I went down and found the bear
that Charlie had shot. It was dead.
Bill and Charlie pulled it up with a
rope after a hard tug; but Charlie
strained himself and we did not make
the big climb after all.

HOW SUPPORT
HIGH SCHOOLS?
Professor Brown on the
Problem of State
Assistance.
Condemns Caminetti's Pro
posed Constitutional
Amendment.
Superintendent McClymonds of the
Oakland Schools Speaks on
â 'Number Work."
In an address to a teachers' class at the
University of California. Professor Elmer
E. Brown gave a historical review of the
progress of secondary education in San
Francisco, relating the facts of the de
â¢ the boys' and Kirls" high
school and the normal class. He sai.i:
The history of these schools exhibits .1 marked
tendency toward rentlation, especially in
the (iirection of vocational training-.
The true tendency is. I think, to make th*
commercial liigrh schix^l training e<iual in ritrcr
to that of the peneral culture echt^jls. if thla
can be done, and technical training 1 "an bo
made thorough and efficient, its importance as
a part of secondary education cannot be over
tstimat?d.
The first hiph school was established in San
Francisco in 1<56. The Hoys* Hisrh School; now
the Lowell High, was established In IS6S. The
Girls' High was established in I^4 and is the
only hi| school in tho city that has not be
come co- educational, the Boys' High &hcol
ha vine been for years, even before" its nanv
was changed, open to students of both sexes.
The otaie constitution makes scant pruvis
ion for the support of high schools. N".. Stale
funds .-an be used for any school not â¢ Dtiir.lv
managed by the State, nd the only _>u-.h
schools now existing ire the normal schools.
In a word, under existing conditions the sup
port of high schools comes entirely from ltxai
taxat; >n. This means, of course, that in any
community there must be a sufficiently strong
sentiment in favor of higher education to ob
tain funds for its support. Various attempts,
among them the CaniiiiPtti act of ISS3. to evade
tiie constitution by establishing "Rrammar
school course schools," have been made and
these Utempts accompli the good -ult of
awakening interest in secondary education.
In 1891 the law providing for the hybrid
formed and unsatisfactory "grammar school
course schools" was repealed and a law was
passed providing for three kinds of high school:
Firstâ That any dlsti of more than 1000
population which would furnish the entire
amount necessary ciuld establish a high school.
Secondâ That â â -â nil districts might unite to
form a "union high school."
Thirdâ That the county may provide for the
establishment of one or more high schools
There is a feeling that the present law does
not sufficiently provide for secondary educa
tion. At the last session of the Legislature a
constitutional amendment was ; r iposed by Mr
Camineui providing State aid for grammar
schools teaching high school subjects and pre
paring students for the university While I
believe Mr. Caminetti is one of the best friends
of >ndary education in thi State I do not
regard the proposed amendment as desirable
It would prevent the establishment of true
high schools and would cause the continua
tion of grammar school methods into second
ary institutions. The methods of each of the>=e
group of schools shrtuld be entirely distinct
Again, under this law holders of grammar
school certificates could teach in the real hieh
school courses and a werlng in the standard
would follow necessarily.
rintendent J. w. McClymonds of
the Oakland rbllc schools spoke briefly
on "Primary Number Work." He said:
t'nfortunately. the first thins we have to
teach the child in number work fs that part
of the subject of arithmetic that is most dif
ficult to understandâ addition. It has been
figured out ih.y B8 per cent of the mistakes
made in computation are mistakes in addi
tion, this difficult part of arithmetic this
development of the "number sense," is the first
thing that has to be taught In our primary
schools.
Number work is mechanical work, pure and
simple. nrill the child long enough In this
mechanical work and he will add with abso
lute accuracy. Train the child on the various
combinations of numbers until they become
absolutely familiar. It is a slow process but
it pays. The teaoher has to show Interest in
the w.irk in order to Interest the pupils aad
when the pupils become interested they will
do pood work.
Subtraction can be best taught by a method
different from that â rnmonly in use. The
method of "borrowing" from one column foj
another should be done away with Suppose
you are teaching the beginner to BUbtri 3S
from 52. Instead of borrowing 1 from the 5
and adding it to the 2. add 1 to the 1 and add
1 also to the 3 of the 3v In other words, the
process instead of being â â¢â¢ from 12 is 4. 3 from
4 is 1. therefore 3> from 52 is 14," should be "S
from 12 is 4. 4 from 5 is 1. therefore SS from 5*
is 14."
Next Saturday morning will conclude
the sories of pedagogical lectures for the
present term.

Betrothal Announced of

The first notable engagement of the

of Miss Delia Davidson and Harrison
Dibblee. For some time the friends of
the contracting parties have suspected
that such an engagement existed, but the
young people managed to keep their In

story got too good to keep and the influ

knowledge their betrothal. ..
Miss Davidson is the daughter of David
B. Davidson of the Nevada Bank, and
made her debut early in the season. She
was educated in the Eastern schools and
is as charming as she is accomplished. In
appearance she is petite and slender, and
her greatest attraction Is her delicate
and exquisite coloring. Her hair is 01 a

THE OLD PEBALTA GRANT.
It Does Not Include Alameda Coun
ty's Two Big Creeks.
Surveyor J. M. Gleaves has denied the
application of M. F. Truett Jr. for an i
extension of the lines of "survey of the
Rancho San Antonio, the purpose of J
which was to Include within the bound
aries of the ranch the waters of the San '
Antonio and San Leandro creeks. The j
decision is of some importance to many â 
people living in Alameda County on |
property adjoining the old Peralta grant j
from the United States. In his decision, J
the Surveyor-General says: I
"To Induce the summary action of this
office under section 8 of the act of July
23, 1556, petitioner relies upon proceedings
which, as has been shown, have culmin
ated in a patent to his remote grantor.
Upon such a showing, for this office to ,
assume jurisdiction over the lands in
question for the purpose of survey, under .
the section mentioned, it must necessar
ily, in effect, deny the solemn declarations
of the Government, evidenced by its pat- |
ent, as construed by the highest court in
the land. That so grave a responsibility |
devolves urvon an officer whose duties are '
so largely ministerial as are those of the
United States Surveyor-General, and in â¢
a proceeding entirely collateral and ex 1
parte, as is this, is an assumption to i
which this office, with a due sense of Its !
proper sphere of duty, cannot assent. The '<
application of petitioner for an extension
of the - lines of the public surveys over

2 south, range 3 west. Mount Diablo base j

NEWS OF THE MINES.
The Government's Defi
nition of Hydraulic
Mining at Last.
Large Prospects for the Inter
national Mining Congress.
Mining Progress.
The formal decision by the California
Debris Commission that the definition of
"hydraulic mining." to which it will ad
here in carrying out the Caminetti law,
shall be â¢â¢mining by means of water un
der pressure through a nozzle," Is the
most important ruling that mining af
fairs have brought forth for .1 long time.
It practically settles a vexed question,
over which the last California Miners'
Convention debated long and about
which authorities disagreed much. It is
now settled that the Federal engineers,
whf-n acting as the California Debris
<'ommission under the Caminetti law.
will regulate drift mining, ground sluic
ing, the washing of tailings, dumps and
all placer mining on the water sheds of
the navigable streams when water is
used through a nozzle under pressure, as
well as when it is used "against a nat
ural bank."
This decision probably settles the ques
tion, because the miners axe not apt to
appeal from the decision. This makes
of practical non-effect the definition
adopted by the State Legislature, which
technically limited the term "hydraulic
mining" to hydraulic operations against
a "natural bank." The definition with its
implied declaration of jurisdiction will
undoubtedly be accepted with fairly good
grace by the hydraulic mining interests,
who are especially and wearily anxious
that some move be made toward the con
struction of the restraining dams. The
spirit in which the decision will be re
ceived by the majority of miners is prob
ably well reflected by the Mining and
Scientific Press, which observes in its
current issue:
â "It is fair to assume that the future of
the great industry of hydraulic mining in
California rests in a liberal administra
tion and interpretation of the existing
law, or some law framed upon the same
! general lines. Insistence upon narrow
rules of interpretation, which do violence
to the spirit of the law, will impede rath
er than advance the interests of the in
dustry."
During the week Ju ian Sonntag. secre
tary of the California Miners' Associa
tion, received from D. Johnson of Den
ver, chairman of the executive commit
tee of the International Mining Congress
a letter urging active interest nere in the
coming meeting of the congress in Den
ver. July 7. and 9. The writer predicts
an exceedingly large attendance and be
lieves that the meeting will be one of the
most Important events in the history of

Mr. bonntag's reply reflected the cordial
interest taken in the congress here and
the expectation of a large California dele
gation being in attendance. He offered
the wise suggestion that Governors and
others who are to I appoint the ' delegates
be specially asked by letter to name only
men practically identified with mining

The initial convention of last year was

j ing a second tunnel or snaft connecting
with the main shaft at a uepth of not
i less than 100 feet.
The only pei.alty. however, for disre
â  garding the lav/ is a provision that if any
miner working in the mine shall sustain
â  injuries or death which might have been
avoided had the second means of egress
j existed, the owner snail be naole for full
I damages for such injuries to the person
sustaining t..em or to the relatives of the

supervision *i see that any regulations
are observed.

As the long distance lines of the Sunset
Telephone Company are being rapidly ex
tended among the towns of the mining
regions many large mines are putting in
private connecting lines at their own ex
pense. In these times it is a daily inci
dent for a mine superintendent to ring
up the office of the company or owner
whose office is in San Francisco, or to ring
! up a business firm in the city, make re
ports, get directions or order machinery
or supplies. Mining men celebrate the
, end of a long, hard ride into the moun
; tains with a draught of the superintend
j ent's best reserve stock and a cheerful
â  report to the wife in the city.
! The dry season will work much hard
j ship upon many of the miners. The Trin
i ity Deep Gravel Mining Company has
constructed at great expense over a half
mile of ditch and has laid about 1300 feet
of pipe to bring water from Boulder
Creek to its Morrison Gulch claims on
the Trinity River. This done the useless
ness of the work at the present time is
discovered, as there is little water for '
any purpose.â Searchlight.

R. R. Christy of Tacoma is managing
owner of a new and promising property ;
| near French Gulch. Shasta County, the

': five claims on the summit of the moun
tain. Two tunnels have been driven with

; ready been taken out to pay expenses. ;
: Development will proceed rapidly.
i One of the throng of new developments '
which are calling increasing attention to

Aetna Standard: A crushing, of ore has
been made by Musgrave : & White from ;
their new find â at the â  head *of Humbug
Creek, between that and the Little Hum
: bug. called the Lost Lenore mine. -This
; vein runs from one foot to three feet wide
at place of disco very, the only place ex- ;
; plored. A crushing ;of ' six tons paid $25
I per ton. This was found last month. The
; vein was uncovered on March 'â  1, and â  the
only development so far on -this find is a
cut eighteen feet long to a depth of ten
,feet. The ; vein- filling is quartz, with .
â  ocher and iron. -Much of the ore > shows
' free gold. The bottom of the cut between
the walls is about eighteen inches â¢ in .
width. The direction of the vein. is north
and south. Two I parallel veins I run with
; the find for a distance of 175 feet.

Sec. 3. Before recommending to the
Supervisors the ordering of any work
or improvement, the expense of which,
or any part thereof, is to be assessed
upon private property, the Board of
Public Works shall pass a resolution of
its intention to recommend the same,
specifying the work to be recommend
ed, and shall fix a day when it shall
take final action upon said resolution.
Upon the passage thereof the Secre
tary of the Board shall forthwith, with
out any further authority, cause a copy
of said resolution to be posted conspic
uously for five days in the office of said
Secretary, and to be published for a
period of ten days (legal holidays ex
cepted) and cause a copy to be deposit
ed in the Post Office at the City and
County, with postage prepaid, address
ed to each person represented on the
Assessment Book of the City and
County for the next preceding fiscal
year as being owner of land liable to be
assessed for said improvement; but if
said lot stand on said book in the name
of unknown owners, such notice need
not be sent.
The Board shall also cause to be con
spicuously posted along the line of said
contemplated improvement, at points
not more than one hundred feet in dis
tance apart, notices, not less than
three in all, of the passage of said reso
lution. Each of said notices shall be
headed "Notice of Street Work" in let
ters of not less than two inches in
length, and shall in legible characters
state the fact of the passage of said
resolution, its date, and, briefly, the
work or improvement proposed, and re

Sec. 4. The owners of a majority of
the frontage of the proi -rty fronting

objections to the same within ten days
after the expiration of the time of the
publication of said resolution of inten
tion, which objections shall be delivered
to the Secretary of the Board of Public
Works, who shall endorse thereon the
date of its reception by him. Such ob
jections shall be a bar for six months
to any further proceedings in relation
to the doing of said work or making
said improvement, unless the owners of
the one-half or more of the frontage or
of the district, as aforesaid, shall
meanwhile petition for the same to be
done, and the same shall, after the ex
piration of said six months, be contin
ued under the resolution of intention
first passed if said Board shall deem
proper. If, however, the owners of at
least two-thirds of the property front
ing on said proposed work or improve
ment, and. in the case of a district,
those owning at least two-thirds of the
superficial area of the district, shall
make written objections to the
same within said six months, no fur
ther proceedings shall oe taken under
the aforesaid resolution of intention.
When the work or improvement pro
posed to be done is the construction of
Bewers, manholes, culverts or cess
pools, and the objections thereto are
signed by the owners of a maiority of
the frontage or of the district as afore
said, the Board shall, at its next meet
ing, fix a time for hearing raid objec
tions, not less than one week there
after. The Secretary shall thereupon
notify the persons making Buch objec
tions, by depositing a notice thereof in
the Post Office at the City and County,
postage prepaid, and addressed to each
objector or his agent when he appears
for such objector. At the time speci
fied the Board shall hear the objections
urged, and pass upon the same, and its
decision shall be final and conclusive;
and if said objections are overruled the
proceedings shall be continued as
though no objections had been made.
At any time before the making of
the assessment as hereinafter provid
ed, all owners of lots of land liable to
assessment therein, who, after the first
publication of the aforesaid resolution
of Intention, may feel aggrieved, or
who may have objections to any pro
ceedings In relation to the performance
of the work described in said resolu
tion, may file with the Secretary' a pe
tition of remonstrance, wherein they
Bhall state In what respect they feel
aggrieved, or the proceedings to which
they object. Such petition or remon-
Btrance shall be passed upon by the
Board, and Its decision thereon shall
be final and conclusive.
Sec. 5. Wh^n the contemplated work
or improvement In the opinion of the
Board of Public Works is of more than
local or ordinary public benefit, it may
recommend to the Supervisors that the
expense of such work or improvement
be made chargeable upon a district,
and said Board shall In its res
olution of Intention set out the district
benefited by said work or improvement
and to be assessed to pay the expense
thereof. Objections to the extent and
boundaries of the district of lands to
be benefited by said work or improve
ment may be made by any Interested
party, in writing, within ten days af
ter the expiration of the time of pub
lication of the resolution of intention.
The Secretary of the Board shall lay
said objections before it and the Board
shall, at Its next meeting, fix a time
for hearing said objections not less
than one week thereafter. The Secre
tary shall thereupon notify the persons
making such objections by depositing
a notice thereof in the Post Office at the
City and County, postage prepaid, ad
dressed to each objector. At the time
Fperified the Board shall hear the ob
jections urged and pass upon the same,
and If said objections are overruled, its
decision shall be final and conclusive
as to the extent and boundaries of the
district.
If the objections are sustained, the
Board shall proceed to set out another
district to the extent and boundaries
of which objections may be made and
a hearing had thereon as above pro
vided; and so on in like manner until
a district has been set out to the ex
tent and boundaries of which all ob
jections shall be overruled by the Board
âits decision in that behalf to be final
and conclusive; and thereupon the pro
ceedings shall continue the same as If
no objections had been made. In Its
report to the Supervisors the Board
shall accompany its report with a dla
pram on which shall be delineated each
separate lot, piece or parcel of land,
the area In square feet of each of such
lots, pieces or parcels of land, and the
relative location of the same to thÂ«
work or Improvement proposed to be
done within the limits of the district.
Such diagram shall be certified to be
correct by the Secretary of the Board.
Sec. 6. When the work under any
contract shall have been completed, the
contractor shall make and file in the
office of the Board of Public Works
an affidavit to the effect that he haÂ»
not entered into any private agree
tnent, verbal or written, with any per
son liable to be assessed for said work,
or with any one on his behalf, to ac
cept a price from him less than the
price named in said contract, or to
make any rebate or deduction to him
from such price. Any such agreement
ehall be deemed a fraud upon all per
sons liable to be assessed for such
work other than the property owners
who were parties to the agreement, and
shall make void, as to such persons so
defrauded, any assessment made for
the work done under such contract; and
where there Is more than one contractor
each contractor shall make such affi
davit.
Sec. 7. When any work In or upon
any public street shall have been com

therefor, together with any lncldentaj
expenses, the rate per front foot as
sessed, the amount of each assessment,
the name of the owner of each lot (if
known to the Board, and if not known,

opposite the number of the lot and the
amount assessed thereon); the number
of each lot assessed, and shall have at
tached thereto a diagram exhibiting
the street or street crossing on which
the work has bÂ«en done, and showing
the relative location of earh distinct
lot to the work done, numbered to cor
respond with the numbers in the as
sessment, and showing the number of
front feet assessed for said work. A
mistake in the name of the owner shall
not invalidate any assessment.
When the expense of such work falls
In part upon any person, company or
corporation having railroad tracks
upon the street where such work has
been done, said assessment shall In
clude an assessment against said per
son, company or corporation, for Its
legal proportion of said expense, and
the same shall constitute a Hen upon
the road-bed, rolling stock, franchises
and other property of such person,
company or corporation, for a period
of two years from the date of record

expense of the work and improvement
is to be assessed upon a district, im
mediately after the contractor has ful
filled his contract to the satisfaction
of the Board of Public Works, or to

appeal, the Board of Public Works
shall proceed to estimate upon the
lands, lots, or portions of lots within

I. 10. If at any time there shall be
street work or Improvement done,
none of the methods hereinbefore
ded are legally sufficient to au
se the Board of Public Works to

c it passes a resolution of its in
jn to recommend the ordering of
said work or Improvement, establish
by resolution a method by means of
which such assessment shall be made;
and on the completion of the work or
improvement to the satisfaction of said
Board, or to the satisfaction of the
Supervisors on appeal, said Board shall
make an assessment to pay the ex
pense thereof according to the method
established by said resolution.
Sec. 11. In making all assessments
the Board of Public Works shall act

(name of contractor) (his or their)
agents, or assigns, to demand and re
ceive the several assessments upon the
assessment and diagram hereto at
tached, and this shall be (his or their)
warrant for the same.
(Date) . (Name of President of
Board of Public Works.)
Countersigned by (Name of Secre
tary of Board of Public Works.)
Said warrant, assessment nnd dia
gram shall be recorded in the office of
the Board. When so recorded the sev
eral amounts assessed shall be a lien
upon the lands, lots, or portions of lots
assessed, respectively for the period of
two years from the date of said record
ing, unless sooner discharged; and
from and after the date of said record
ing of any warrant, assessment and
diagram, all persons Interested In said
ataM nsment shall be deemed to have no
tice of the contents of the record
tho> cot.
After said warrant, assessment and
diagram are recorded, the same shall
hi delivered to the contractor, or his
agent or assigns, on demand, but not
until after the payment to the Board
of the incidental expenses not previ
ously paid by the contractor or his as
signs. By virtue of said warrant said
contractor, or his agents or assigns,
shall be authorized to demand and re
ceive the amount of the several assess
ments made to cover the sum due for
the work specified in such contracts
o.nd assessments.
When it shall appear by the final
Judgment of any court in this State
having jurisdiction to render su*?h Judg
ment, that any suit brought to foreclose
the Her. of any assessment for street
work made under this Chapter, or in
the recording thereof, has been defeated
by reason of any defect, error, infor
mality, omission, irregularity, or ille
gality, thereof or therein, or in the re
turn on the warrant Issued pursuant to
any euch assessment, or in the record
ing of any such warrant, any person in
terested therein may, at any time with
in seven months after the entry of said
final judgment, apply to the Hoard for
another assessment to be Issued in con
formity to law; and the Board shall,
within sixty days after the time of
said application, make an:l deliver to
said applicant a new assessment, dia
gram and warrant in accordance with
law, and sign, record and authenticate
the same as above provided. Such as
sessment shall be a lien upon the lots
of land sot out therein for the period of
two years from the date of its record
ing, and suit may be brought to enforce
said Hen as provided in this Chapter.
Should such final judgment be that of
the Superior Court for the City and
County and an appeal therefrom to the
Supreme Court of the State has been
taken, no such other assessment shall
be made until said appeal has been de
termined.
Sec. 13. The contractor or his as
signs, or some person on his or their
behalf, shall call upon the persons as
sessed, or their agents. If they can con
veniently be found, and demand pay
ment of the amount assessed to each.
If any payment/ be made, the contrac
tor, his assigns, or some person on his
or their behalf, shall receipt the same
upon the assessment in the presence
of the person making such payment,
and shall also give a receipt if demand
ed. When the persons bo assessed, or
their agents, cannot conveniently be
found or when the owner of the lot is
stated as "unknown" upon the assess
ment, then said contractor or his as
signs, or some person on his or their
behalf, shall publicly demand payment
on the premises assessed.
The warrant shall be returned to the
Board of Public Works within thirty
days after its date with a return indors
ed thereon, signed by the contractor or
his assigns, or some person on his or
their behalf, verified upon oath, stat
ing the nature and character of the de
mand, and whether any of the assess
ments remain unpaid in whole or in
part, and the amount thereof. There
upon the Secretary of the Board shal!
record the return co made in the mar
gin of the record of the warrant and
assessment.
The Board can at any time receive
the amount due uoon any assessment
and warrant issued by it and give a
good and sufficient discharge therefor;
but no such payment so made after
suit has been commenced shall operate,
without the consent of the plaintiff irÂ»
the action, as a complete discharge of
the lien until the costs in the action
shall be refunded to the plaintiff.
The Board may release any assess
ment upon the books of its office on
the payment to It of the amount of the
assessment with interest against any
lot or on the production to it of the
receipt of the party or his assigns to
whom the assessment and warrant
were Issued. If any contractor shall
fail to return his warrant within the
time and in the form provided in this
section he shall thenceforth have no
lien upon the property assessed; but if
any warrant is lost, upon proof of such
loss a duplicate may be issued, upon
which a return may be made with the
same effect as if the original had been
so returned. After the return of the
assessment and warrant as aforesaid,
all amounts remaining due thereon
shall draw interest at the rate of seven
per centum per annum until paid.
Sec. 14. The owners, whether named
in the assessment or not, the contrac
tor or his assigns, and all other per
sons directly interested in any work
provided for in this Chapter, or In the
assessment, feeling aggrieved by any
act or determination of the Board of
Public Works in relation thereto, or
who claim that the work has not been
performed according to the contract in
a good and substantial manner, or
having or making any objection to the
correctness or legality of the assess
ment or other act, determination, or
proceedings of the Board, shall, within
thirty days after the date of the war
rant, appeal to the Supervisors, by
briefly stating their objections In writ
ing and filing the same with the Clerk

done, or other subject of appeal, and
to the acts, determinations or proceed
ings objected to or complained of, shall

appeal the Supervisors may remedy
and correct any error or informality
in the proceedings, and revise and cor

of the Board relative to said work,
may confirm, amend, set aside, alter,
modify or correct the assessment in
such manner as to them shall seem
just; and require the work to be com
pleted according to the directions of
the Supervisors, and may at their op
tion direct the Board of Public Works
to correct the warrant, assessment or
diagram in any particular, or to make
and issue a new warrant, assessment
and diagram to conform to the deci
sions of the Supervisors in relation
thereto.
All the decisions and determinations
of the Supervisors, upon notice and
hearing: as aforesaid, shall be final and
conclusive upon all persons entitled to
appeal under the provisions of this
section, as to all errors, Informalities
and Irregularities, which the Supervis
ors might have remedied and avoided:
and no assessment shall he held In

same.
Sec. 15. At any time after the period
of thirty-five days from the day of the
dato of the warrant, or if an appeal
has been taken to the SuDervisors, then,

rant, assessment and diagram, or any
day thereafter during the continuance
of "the lien of said assessment, and re

In all cases of recovery under the
provisions of thlH Chapter the plain
tiff sha.ll recover the sum of fifteen dol
lars in addition to the taxable costs,
as attorney's fees, but not any percent
age upon said recovery. When suit has
been brought, after a personal demand

such assessment so demanded, the
plaintiff shall also be entitled to have
and recover said sum of fifteen dollars
as attorney's fees In addition to all tax
able costs, notwithstanding that the
suit may be settled or a tender be
made before a recovery In said action,
and he may have judgment therefor.

ACQUISITION OF PUBLIC UTIL
ITIES.
It Is hereby '^clared to be the pur
pose and intention of the people of the
City and County that its public utilities
shall be gradually acquired and ulti
mately owned by the City and County.
To this end it is hereby ordained:
SECTION 1. Within one year from
the date upon which this Charter shall
go into effect, and at least every two
years thereafter until the object ex
pressed in this provision shall hava
been fully attained, the Supervisors
must procure through the City Engi
neer plans and estimates of the actual
cost of the original construction and
completion by the City and County of
water works, gas works, electric light
works, steam, water or electric power
| works, telephone lines, street railroads
! and such other public utilities as tha
i Supervisors or the people by petition to'
I the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
cost of the construction and completion,
I of water works by the City and County,
| the Supervisors must procure and place
I on file plans and estimates of the cost
!of obtaining from all of the several
available sources a sufficient and per
manent supply of good, pure water for
the City and County, in order that.
j propositions for the acquisition, con
struction and completion thereof, and,
the incurring of municipal indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and County as herein-,
after set forth.
Sec. 2. After such plans and esti
mates shall have been procured and
tiled, the Supervisors shall, at as early
a date as they may deem for the best
interests of the City and County, enter
into negotiations for the permanent ac
quisition by the City and County, by
original construction, condemnation or
purchase c.f such or any of said
public utilities as they may regard
most important to the City and County |
to be first acquired, and to formulate
and submit to the electors of the Citjr
and County, at a special election, prop
ositions for the permanent acquisition
and ownership thereof.
Before submitting propositions to
the electors for the acquisition by orig
inal construction or condemnation, of
public utilities, the Supervisors must
solicit and consider offers for the sale
to the City and County of existing util
ities in order that the electors shall
have the benefit of acquiring the same
at the lowest possible cost thereof.
Sec. 3. When a petition or petitions
signed by electors of the City and
County equal in number to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
sented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the signers thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any
public utility, and requesting the
Board to prepare for submission to the
electors of the City and County, aa
hereinafter provided, a proposition for
che acquisition of such utility, it shall
be the duty of the Board to immediate
ly take such steps or to enter into such,'
negotiations as will enable it to formu
late such a proposition for submission,
to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
osition shall be so formulated and com
pleted within six months from the date
of the filing of such petition. The Cleric
of the Supervisors must, immediately
upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
nn authenticated copy thereof, without
the signatures, to the Board of Election
Commissioners, and another such copy
to the Mayor, together with a certifi
cate that the required number of signa
tures are appended to the original. Ths
Mayor shall also have the right to for
mulate and submit to the electors %
separate proposition from that formu

sition of the utility named in said petl.
tion. At the next municipal election af
ter the formulation of such proposi
tions by the Supervisors and the May
or, the Board of Election Commission
ers shall submit to the electors the two
alternative propositions. The proposi
tion receiving a majority of the votes
Â©Sst thereon shall be adopted; hut in
case the votes cast in favor of bothpropositions shall not exceed one-half
the total number of votes cast thereon,
both propositions shall be deemed re
jected. .
Nothing K\\ this section, shall be so
construed as to prohibit the Supervis
ors from responding to the aforesaid
petition of the electors requesting the
acquisition of any public utility by pro
ft ceeding at once, without the submission
of propositions to the electors as afore
said, to pass an ordinance declaring its
determination to acquire the same as
provided in section six of this Article

quire the same in the manner herein
after provided.
Sec. 4. In case the cost of any public
utility sought to be acquired under the

ting propositions to the electors for
such acquisition the Supervisors shall
Bpeclfy in such proposition the cost of
the public utility, the proposed method
and manner of payment therefor, and
submit to the electors the question
whether the same shall be acquired
Rupon such terms.
In case, however, the cost of such
public utility sought to be acquired
under the provisions of this Article
shall so far exceed the annual revenues
of the City and County, in addition to
the other necessary expenditures there
of, as to render it necessary to incur a
municipal bonded indebtedness for such
purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub
mitting propositions to the electors for
the acquisition thereof, shall specify
therein the amount of the proposed
bonded indebtedness, the rate of inter
est thereon. . and whether such bonded
indebtedness shall be incurred. At

thereon at such election shall be neces
sary to secure such acquisition and to
warrant the issuance of municipal
bonds therefor, as hereinafter set forth.
Sec. 5. When the electors by vote
shall have determined, as hereinbefore
set forth, to acquire any public utility,
Euch action on the part of the electors
shall be equivalent to the passing of
the ordinance by the Supervisors de
claring such determination as set forth
in section six of this Article, and the
Supervisors shall proceed without de
lay to pass an ordinance calling a
special election as required by section
seven of this Article.
Sec. 6. When the Supervisors shall de
termine that the public interest or ne
cessity demands the acquisition, con
struction or completion of any public
utility, the coÃt^f -which will be too
great to be paid out of the ordinary an

County, the Supervisors shall, by or

utility, the Supervisors by ordinance
shall call a special election, ,at which

election. ..;-

special election shall recite the objects
and purposes for which the indebted
ness is proposed to be incurred, the es

NEW YORK'S BICYCLE POLICE.
The work of the squad assigned to
the town of Newtown fairly illustrates
the work of all. Newtown, by the way,
has an area about as large as Manhat
tan Island, but is divided into only
eighteen election districts. The .village
of Newtown was selected as headquar
ters for. police work, and was connected
by telephone direct with police head
quarters in New York. A roundsman
was placed in charge at this point,
with two foot officers to collect returns
from the village polling places. , Three
bicycle officers were assigned to the
three polling places at Maspeth, two
miles away, one each at Middle Village,
Winfield and Laurel Hill; two each at
Ridgewood, Metropolitan and Glen
dale, and three more at Corona. : These
wiry and athletic representatives aof
the New York police force, as they
wheeled at racing speed over the coun
try roads of Queens, excited no little
admiration and wonder among the In
habitants of the rural villages. Many
looked forward with satisfaction to the
time when, along with the other ad
vantages of consolidation, they,, too,
could claim the protection of ; some of
New York's army of bluecoat defend
ers.âFrom "'The Police ; ;" Control lof I a
