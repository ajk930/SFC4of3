Expedition.
General Miles With Brigades of
Infantry ar)d Artillery Ordered
to Leave Cuba.
WASHINGTON, July 20.â Orders were sent to-day to Ad
miral Sampson to start at once with his fleet for the landing
place in Porto Rico which has been determined upon by the war
authorities.
Secretary Alger said to-night that he expected General
Mile?, one brigade of infantry and some artillery, would leave
Cuba immediately, under convoy of a strong naval squadron, for
the invasion of Porto Rico. He expressed the hope and belief
that troops were already en route to that place. Most of them
had been on board the transports for several days, and the situa
tion was becoming trying to them.
Secretary Alger said there had been no delay in the embarka
tion of the troops, and that, so far as the War Department and
General Miles were concerned, the expedition had been in readi
ness tr proceed to Porto Rico for several days.
No information could be obtained at the War Pepartment
to-night as to whether the fleet had actually sailed.
TROOPS SAIL AWAY
FROM CHARLESTON
CHARLESTON. 8. C. July 20.â
"With bands playing 'and 30,000
people cheering the first expe- i
ditlon to follow General Miles
to Porto Rico got away from here at
7 o'clock this evening. The expedition
Is under command of Major General J.
H. Wilson, and will, when complete,
consist of the Second and Third Wis
consin and the Sixteenth Pennsylvania
Regiments and two companies of the
Sixth Illinois. The first two regi
rftents are on the transports Grand
Duchess and No. 30, respectively, and
they are at sea. No. 21, carrying the
Sixteenth Pennsylvania and the Illi
nois men, is in the stream and will
sail early to-morrow morning. Each
of the ships carries a large quantity
of supplies, and on the No. 21 there are
1000 he-ad of mules and the wagon train
of General Wilson's division. These
men, together with those of the Sixth
Illinois and Sixth Massachusetts, which
sailed from here last week for San
tiago, constitute the first brigade of the
First Division of the First Army Corps.
For two days and nights the work of
loading baggage and provisions on the
transports has been going forward un
der rush orders. All the Btevedores in
the city were employed at it. They
were assisted by details of men from
the various regiments and the 500 ne
gro laborers employed here by the Gov
ernment and destined for work on the
roads and bridges in Cuba. The scene
which accompanied the departure of
the vessels from their docks was one
of indescribable enthusiasm. Practi
cally the entire population of the city
was in evidence. As the vessels made
the stream the bands on shipboard and
ashore played national airs and the
thousands of people cheered like mad.
The expedition will sail directly for
Porto Rico. ____
SPAIN ACCUSED OF
"MORAL COWARDICE"
London Times Says It Is Incredible
That Madrid Can Hope for Any
thing From Cuoa.
LONDON, July 20.â The Times, edi
torially reproaching the Spanish Gov
ernment this morning with "moral
cowardice" in endeavoring to screen its
own mismanagement by pretending
that "General Toral has betrayed his
country," says:
"It is incredible that Spain can hope
for nnything from Cuba, as it is im
poÃSi!>:'- for lllanco, as it was for Toral,
to fight against hunger, and it is un
likely that the former will have any
thing else to light with for some time
to come. N'fither ran anything be
hop^d from .European intervention, if
Commodore Watson's squadron comes,
though Its arrival would be an unwel-
Kne-otacle to more than one Euro
pean power.
"It may be assumed that Commodore
Watson's authorization to visit the
Philippines will now weaken the dispo
sition at Berlin to cultivate friendly re
lations with America and to make light
of the escapades of the German ships
at Manila."

ASSURANCES FROM
AUGUSTI AND BLANCO
Kind of Official News Madrid Re
ceives From the Philippines
and Cuba.
MADRID, July 20.â Senor Sagasta and
General Correa, Minister of War, declare
that the latest news from the Philippines
; is of the most favorable character. Gen
! eral Correa's advices indicate that the ln
; surgents are now displaying "only a luke
warm hostility toward the Spanish
| troops."
Captain General Augustl sends an offi
cial dispatch asserting under date of July
14 that while the blockade is becoming
very strict the enemy has lost heavily in
several recent engagements, "by which
the morale of the American forces has
been weakened and tne Spaniards have
been greatly encouraged."
The dispatch alleges also that "the gar
rison is ready to n~i,t. to the death," and
that General Monet and Â«everal officers
who escaped from Matabebe have ar
rived here.
Captain General Augusti concludes as
follows: "Witnout any exaggeration,
which Is contrary to my character, I have
described with loyal candor the situation,
to which I am consecrating all my efforts
for my country and my King."
An official dispatch "from Captain Gen
eral Blanco announces that the greatest
enthusiasm prevails there and the feel
ing in favor of resisting the "Yankees" is
universal. I: further asserts that the
commanders of the volunteer forces, at a
conference under the presidency of Gen
eral Arolas, military governor of Havana,
resolved to "exhaust their resources and
die rather than surrender." The Ameri
can warships, the dispatch says, are off
Manzanillo. apparently awaiting instruc
tions, hut the bombardment has not been
resumed.

Says Spain Must Seek Peace, and Ad
mits the Humanity of the Unit

Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
MADRID, July 20â The remarkable
thing to-day is that the jingo Impar
rlal says that Spain must assuredly
ask for peace, and that no other course
is possible. The same paper says in a
leading article with the conduct of
Americans toward Spanish prisoners it
has been more humanitarian than that
of the Germans toward French pris
oners in 1871, and Russians toward the
Turks.

PERMANENT ANNEXATION OF
PORTO RICO THE POLICY
The Island Is to Be Made a Strong Military and
Naval Station Commanding the Entire
West Indies.
NEW YORK, July 20. â The Washington correspondent of the Herald sends the fol
lowing: Permanent annexation of Porto Rico to the United States is the avowed policy of
the administration. Whatever may be the ultimate disposition of the Philippines, the La
drones and the Carolines. Porto Rico is to be held. It is to be made a strong military and na
val station commanding the entire West Indies and controlling the approach to the Gulf of
Mexico, the Caribbean Sea. and the future canal across the isthmus.
Members of the Porto Rican Junta in New York City who have been working for the
formation of an independent form of government for the island have received little encour
agement from the administration. General Miles has agreed to accept the services of Dr.
Julio Henna and several other members of the Junta as guides and interpreters in his coming
campaign, but the administration has been very careful not to make any promises about re
cognizing the Junta when Porto Rico has fallen.
In compliance with telegrams from General Miles, Dr. Henna, president of the Junta,
and Senor Roberto Todd, secretary, came to Washington to-day to confer with Secretary
Alger about accompanying the army of invasion. They will leave at once to join General
Miles at Puerto de Fayardo to act as guides in the campaign against San Juan.

timately surrendered there will be scarce
ly more than 12,000 Spanish prisoners, if
that many, to be carried to Spain in
transports. This estimate, based upon
official figures in the War Department,
Is strengthened by an estimate given me
to-day by an official high In authority. It
is not likely that the small forces In
Guantanamo and Karacoa, in view of the
terms of Toral's surrender In the three
eastern districts, will offer any prolonged
or effective resistance.
GENERAL BLANCO
TIGHTLY SEALED
I Havana Cannot Communicate With
Madrid Except Under American
Censorship.
WASHINGTON, July 20.â Two days
' ago General A. W. Greely, chief signal
officer, cabled Instructions to his offl
| cers in Santiago to seal up and place
a guard over the three cable lines con
necting Santiago with Cienfuegos,
whence, by a land line, communication
is established with Havana. To-day
General Greely was informed that his
orders had been carried into effect.
The closing of the Cienfuegos cables
absolutely isolates Havana and Gen
eral Blanco from Madrid. Blanco's
only means of communicating with the
Madrid Government now is by the Key
West cable, which is under the strict
est censorship by the Government of
the United States.
As a result of the sealing of the
I Rantiago-Cienfuegos cables, several
I cipher dispatches passing between
i General Blanco and the Spanish Gov
| ernment drifted into this country to
day. It is scarcely necessary to say
! that they did not reach their destina
tion.
THREE DAYS OVERDUE
FROM PORTO PLATA
The Big Steamer Olinde-Rodriguez
Probably Caught While Run

6T. THOMAS, D. W. 1., July 20.â The
Compagnie Generate Transatlantlque's
steamer Olinde-Rodridguez, formerly the
Franconda (gross tonnage 318 S. net 1676),
plying between Havre and Haytien ports,
is now three days overdue from Porto
Plata, Santo Domingo.
It is supposed that she has been cap
tured while attempting to run the block
ade at San Juan de Porto Rico. After
leaving San Juan on July 4 she was
warned not to attempt to enter on her re

CHATTANOOGA NATIONAL MILI
TARY PARK, Chickamauga, Ga,, July
20.â General Brooke and Colonel William
Richards, adjutant general of the First
Corps, who went to Washington to con
fer with Secretary Alger upon the pro
posed Porto Rican expedition, returned to
Camp Thomas at 10 o'clock this morn
ing.
General Brook* declined to be inter
viewed, preferring that nothing official
shall be said until orders are issued. The
plans for an important movement of
troops from Camp Thomas are, howevet,
progressing. Colonel Lee, chtef quarter
master, was in consultation with a num
ber of railroad men this afternoon, hurry
ing as rapidly as possible the arrange
ments of transportation.
It was learned from excellent authority
this evening that it is the earnest desire
of General Brooke that the entire First
Corps form the expeditionary force golns
from here. This would mean a departure
from Chickamauga of about 30,000 volun-
teers.
Colonel Hartsuff, chief surgeon, said t&.
day that the medical department of thÂ«
First Corps had all the supplies of every
nature necessary for the expedition about
to be entered upon.
"The troops that go out." added Colo
nel Hartsuff. "will go equipped complete
ly, not lacking in any essential feature."
PUBLIC OPINION
FAVORS A PROTECTORATE
Spaniards Prefer Cuba Under Uncle
Sam's Control Than Ruled
by Natives.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Horalrt. Copyrighted. 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
MADRID, July 2).â After talking with
many leading members of the Chamber
and Senate of the different parties I can
positively state the opinion already indi
cated in previous telegrams prevails,
that is, Spain to-day prefers an Azneri
can protectorate to Cuban independence
under the insurrectionists. A fairly logi
cal argument, which seems universally to
have taken hold is that the riches of
Cuba in the main belong to Spanish resi
dents, and that those interests would be
better guaranteed in the hands of a pow
erful civilized nation like the United
States than under the power of insur
rectionists with minds filled with re
vengeful sentiments.

One of these was the Maria Louise, which

BEARS THE TERMS
OF CAPITULATION
Mission of Colonel John Jacob Astor,
Who Is Now on His Way to
Washington.
NEW YORK, July 20.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Colonel
John Jacob Astor is on his way back
from Santiago to Washington, being
the bearer of the terms of capitulation
agreed upon by the commissioners of
General Shatter and General Toral. It
is understood the terms were subscrib
ed to only by the commissioners, not
even the signature of General Shafter
being upon the document. Colonel As
tor is expected to arrive in Washington
by Monday next.

MADRID, July 20.â General Polavla
ja is here. Upon him centers gTeat
hopes of peace, but on the other hand
it is my duty to state that the Cabinet
Minister to-day said that peace seemed
far from realization.
There appears to be much ill-feeling
owing to the statement that the capitu
lation of Santiago was made upon an
understanding with President McKin
ley that it meant the conclusion of hos
tilities on the side of the Americans,
but that, on the contrary, it merely
means an increased energy in the pur
suance of the war of territorial con
quest.
This is quoted as showing the tenor
of the popular feeling:, which does not
stop short of the opinion shared by the
most influential members of the Minis
try that the United States has been sys
tematically tricking Spain into getting
the better of her in the surrender of
Santiago, which, it is here stated, was
made under false pretenses, being the
culminating point of such perfidy.
I am sorry to state this evening that
RECRUITMENT FOR THE
VOLUNTEER ARMY
Fairly Good Progress Made Under
the Second Call, but Some State
Quotas Are Short.
WASHINGTON, July 20.â Fairly good
progress has been made with recruitment
for the volunteer army under the Presi
dent's second call for 75,000 volunteers.
The plan adopted by the "War Depart
ment was to recruit all the volunteer or
ganizations in the army up to their max
imum enlisted strength before entering
upon the recruitment of additional troops.
The total number of men required to fill
out existing regiments was 37,566, and. ac
cording to the latest returns, the total
enlistments under this plan are 27,519
men.
Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jer
sey, Rhode Island, West Virginia and
Wisconsin have exceeded their quota, but
all the others are behind in the supply
of troops. The worst delinquent is North
Carolina, which has furnished only fifty
five soldiers to meet its quota of 783.
Other delinquents are Colorado, Louis
iana, Nebraska, Tennessee and Virginia,
each of which has supplied less than one
third of the number of men required.
Alabama, Massachusetts, Arkansas,
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
the war sentiment once more prevails.
"War to the bitter end" is further
stimulated by the firm attitude of the
Cuban volunteers.
LONDON, July 21.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Times, says: "Noth
ing is known regarding the decision of
the Cabinet on the peace question. Ap
parently the Government does not rec
ognize the necessity of making peace
quickly and the public seems to be in
different. Probably the ministers dis
agree regarding peace, but they are
unanimous in disclaiming responsibil
ity for General Toral's surrender at
Santiago."
The Madrid correspondent of the
Daily Mail says: "Unless peace makes
speedier progress the Queen Regent
will seriously consider changing the
Ministry. Geueral Polaviaja is regard
ed as the coming man."
WASHINGTON. July 20.â Secretary
Day to-day denied any knowledge of
developments in the Spanish-American
| situation.
"I hear," he said, "a. good deal of
peace talk, but only in the newspapers.
That's the only information I have on
| the subject."
Georgia, Mississippi, Oregon and Texas
have done very little better, and are all
very much behind in meeting the require
ments. Complaint has been made also
that in several of the States an effort
has been made to foist poor material on
the Government. The total enlisted
strength of the regular army to date Is
about 44,000 men, being about 18.000 short
of its legal complement. The volunteer
army consists of 153.000 men. and is only
17.000 Bhort of its maximum authorized
strength under the two calls Issued by
the President. The total strength of the
army, regular and volunteer, is 227,000, as
now organized.
WILL TAKE OFF FAST TRAINS.
Agreement Entered into by the Chi-
cago-Denver Roads.
CHICAGO. July 20.â The vice president
of one of the interested lines explained
to-day the agreement just entered into
by the Chicago-Denver roads regarding
fast train service. According to his un
derstanding of the compact, the present
fast trains are to be taken off altogether,
and the lines are to return to exactly the
same basis as existed before the first fast
train was inaugurated. After August 15,
therefore, no road will cover the distance
from Chicago to Denver In less than
thirty-three hours, and there will bÂ« no

Career of the VeteraQ Cubao

NEW YORK, July 20.â A Kingston
(Jamaica) special to the Evening Post
says: "Cubans arriving from Siboney
bring in reports of the death of Gen
eral Garcia. They make a mystery of
it, saying that it should not be known
In Cuba yet, or in the United States,

Spanish refugees here who are official

The last word directly received by the
Cuban Junta in this city from Garcia
was dated before Santiago, July 11. It
was a cable meesage, and stated briefly
that he was well and that the progress
of events was satisfactory. At that
time Garcia was to the west of Santi
ago, guarding the approaches from ex
pected reinforcements to the city.
Horatio S. Reubens, counsel for the
Junta, when given the information
contained In the Evening Post's dis
patch, said this afternoon that news
of Garcia's death had not been re
ceived at the Junta, but at best com
munication with the Cuban forces in
the field was irregular.
"I am greatly surprised, "he said, "but
I do not find it hard to credit the dis
patch. During the assault on Santiago
Garcia was in the west with his com
mand, with the special duty of inter

By a Peculiar Chance of War the
Vessels to Bs Used Are Owned
and Operated Under the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 20.âArrange
ments practically were concluded by
the Government to-night for the trans
portation of the Spanish prisoners at
Santiago from Cuba to Spain.
The contract was awarded to the
Spanish Transatlantique Company,
represented by J. M. Ceballos & Co., of
New York. The company agrees to
carry the prisoners from Cuban ports
w .--pain at the rate of $20 for each en
listed man and 555 for each commis

i by the company on the army ra
tion basis, as provided for in the Gov

The award provides also that the
company shall have live ships at San
tiago In nine days from to-morrow (the
21st inst.), two in seventeen days from
to-morrow, and enough to complete the
transportation of the prisoners in
twenty-one days from to-morrow.
Two days ago, Colonel Hecker, In
Charge of the transportation of troops
in the Quartermaster general's depart
"f the army, went to New York
to consult with shipping companies
concerning the transportation of the
Spanish troops surrendered at Santi
hk". Bids which he had previously ad-
Vi rtised for were opened at the Army
Building in Now York to-day. Colonel
â r returned to Washington this
evening. To-night he had a conference
at the War Department with Secretary
Alger, Quartermaster General Luding

bids of the several companies were
considered, that of the Spanish Trans

garded as the best made. On the basis
i.f 24,000 enlisted men and 1,000 officers,
U will cost tho Government $535,000 to
transport the prisoners.
The ships will fly the colors of Spain
and will be manned probably entirely
by Spanish crews. It was remarked
to-night as one of the curious develop

GENERAL PARREJA
REFUSES TO GIVE
UP GUANTANAMO
Insists That He Is Not Bound by the
Terms of the Santiago
Capitulation.
MADRID, July 20. -General Parreja. the Spanish commander at
Guantanamo. refuses to be included in the capitulation of Santiago de
Cuba. According to Spanish military law a commander can surrender
the troops which he personally commands, but he cannot oblige other
commanders at distant points, even though under his authority to
follow suit. Consequently it is held here that the capitulation com
prises only about 7000 troops, actually at Santiago.
The military code prescribes life Imprisonment for any officer who
includes in the capitulation of his forces other posts, which, "thoujrh
dependent upon his command, are not troops or places included in the
action which caused the capitulation."
It Is doubtful, however, whether General Toral will be thus pun
ished.
Garcia's command to cut off reinforce
ments there. Holguin lies near Manza
nillo and was garrisoned by a consid
erable force, as the American general
must have known. It Is not unlikely
that Garcia and his men came into
conflict with a body of Spanish soldiers
bound from Holguin for Manzanillo."
Callxto Garcia was in his sixtieth
year and was regarded by the Cuban
insurgents as one of their most intre
pid soldiers. In the ten years' war his
skill, bravery and energy won him
continued promotion until he received
a general's star.
In an action in 1874 Garcia was sur
rounded by Spanish troops. Rather
than surrender he shot himself through
the chin with suicidal intent. He lived
and was sent to Spain. He was re
leased in 1877, when the peace of Zen
jon was declared. Garcia at once set
out for New York and organized an ex
pedition to Cuba. He landed in San
tiago de Cuba, but was taken a pris
oner a second time. He eluded the vig
ilance of the prison guards in Spain one
night, after fifteen months' imprison
ment, and fled to England.
Garcia was the promoter of the Haw
kins expedition Which left this cfty in
January, 1895, with 300 men and a large
cargo of supplies and ammunition. The
vessel sunk. He next fitted out the Ber
muda, which was seized upon the eve
of her departure, in February, 1596, by
a United States Marshal and his dep
uties. Garcia was arrested and re
leased in $2500 bail. He at once made
another start and landed in Cuba sev
eral days before the day set for his
trial in this city. Since then he has
been engaged in conducting the cam
paign of the Cubans against Spain In
the province of Santiago de Cuba.

REGRETS THE FRICTION AT
THE FRONT.
Better Class of Insurgents Not in
Sympathy With Those Who
Wanted to Loot
Santiago.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 20.â Senor Que
sada and other representatives of the
Cuban Junta have been in consultation
with officials of the War Department
to-day. The United States 'officials
were assured that there was no dissat
isfaction with the management of af
fairs in Cuba, so far as the Cuban rep
resentatives were concerned, and that
if Garcia and other Cubans operating
about Santiago were not in harmony
with the United States authorities, it
arose from a misunderstanding of the
President's proclamations, and of the
intentions of the United States Gov
ernment in the premises. The Cubans
at Santiago, it was stated, probably
thought that the action of General
Shafter meant the continuation of
Spanish rule and Spanish authority.
It being well understood here that such
was not the case, it was the belief of
the Cuban representatives that when
the matter was made plain to the Cu
ban officers in the field they would ac
quiesce in the action of the United
States and render the United States
army hearty support.
The Cubans assured the -war officials
that nothing was further from their
desires than a rupture with the United
States forces and authority.
It also became known that the junta
had sent dispatches to General Gar
cia and other Cuban officers that their
course at Santiago was not approved
by the junta, and if persisted in would
result in serious injury to the Cubans.
It is believed that the representations
made will bring about a better under
standing between the Cuban officers
and the Americans.
The opinion was expressed at the
War Department that tho better class
of Cubans in the island will have no
sympathy with those who would bring
about trouble, but that it la the lower
and vicious classes who desire to loot
and plunder the city.

GENERAL CALIXTO GARCIA.
WILL TERRORIZE
THE ENEMY AND
IMPRESS EUROPE
Reasons Why the Streogtt} of
Commodore Watson's Squadron
Has Been Creatly Augmented.
NEW YORK, July 20.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: In directing the organiza
tion of the formidable Eastern squad
ron and giving its commander-in-chief
instructions to proceed to the coast of
Spain, President McKinley was actu
ated by a desire not only to terrorize
the enemy, but to impress all Europe
with the sea power of the United
States. I am able to make this state
ment on the authority of an official
who is in the confidence of the Presi
dent. In the formation of the "Eastern
squadron and its dispatch across the
Atlantic will be a notification to the
powers of Europe that it is the purpose
of the United States to compel the Ma
drid government to comply with any
demand it may choose to make. It was
for this reason that the Eastern squad
ron has been considerably strength
ened. As first organized a squadron
with but two battleshjps, one protected
cruiser and three auxiliary cruisers
would have been sufficient to have dis
posed of the remnants of Spain's navy,
and to have bombarded the Spanish
ports as long as such action was
deemed desirable. Further considera
tion of the project convinced the Ad
ministration, however, of the necessity
of strengthening the fleet to the utmost
extent possible, so as to produce a
moral effect in Europe which will be
beneficial to the United States and pre
vent foreign governments from inter
fering in the terms of peace to be made
â not that the President has any infor
mation tending to show a probability
of such interference, but as European
intervention is always ready, the Pres
ident deems it the policy of wisdom to
place under Commodore Watson's com
mand a fleet whoee number and effect
will be sufficient to make the European
sneer give way to the cordial smile of
friendship and acquiescence in the de
mands made on Spain as the price of
peace. Under supplemental orders
which have been given Commodore
Watson, he is to hold himself in readi
ness to proceed to any point the Presi
dent may dosire. Operating in Span
ish waters he will be in a central posi
tion, and can return to the American
coast to protect American ports, or can
proceed to the Philippines to reinforce
Admiral Dewey if any attempt be made
by a third power to wrest any of those
islands from the United States.
RECONSIDERATION
NOW SUGGESTED
LONDON, July 21.â The Daily Chron
icle says editorially this morning: As
1 strong supporters and sincere well
wishers of the United States, we sug
gest a reconsideration of the decision
to send Commodore Watson to Europe.
It could not materially harm Spain
and would be likely to reunite the
Spanish into an impervious obstinacy
of endurance and a determination to
suffer to all lengths. That is their na
tional character. It was that which
baffled Napoleon, who had land forces
to overrun the whole country, while at
every point an American fleet could
touch there would be danger of Euro
pean complications.

BRYAN'S REGIMENT
REACH NASHVILLE
The Commander Makes a Speech In
tended to Particularly Please
the South.
NASHVILLE, Term., July 20.âSev
eral hundred members of the Third Ne
braska regiment, commanded by Colo
nel "William J. Bryan, arrived here to
day, and were met at the depot by a
large crowd. They were entertained at
lunch and soon afterward proceeded on
their way to Atlanta Ga. Colonel Bry
an, with the remainder of the regiment,
arrived this afternoon and was given a
very enthusiastic reception. All of the
soldiers were provided with lunches
and presented with flowers.
Hon. Benton McMillin presented
Colonel Bryan to the large and enthu- i
siastic audience of men and women, !
who greeted him with cheers. Colonel i
Brvaji then spoke in part as follows:
Y>'t do not know what may be the result of
this war. War often brings results which
were not imagined In the beginning, but one
result has already been achieved during this
war. If there was anybody In the United
States who doubted the loyalty of the people
of the South there will be no such doubts here
after. (Applause). When the President of the
rnitcrl States gnve a general's commission to
Fltzhugh Lee and to Congressman Wheeler
the sectional question was forever buried and
hereafter there will be no Dixie line. (Ap- j
plause). When our band started down there I
I told them I wanted them to practice well on !
"Dixie" so that we could play It when we sot
down South, because I told them they Jiad
been practicing for thirty years on "Yankee
Doodle" and we wanted to mix them down I
here. (Applause).
Santa Cruz's Treasurer.
SANTA CRUZ, July 20.â F. W. Lucas
has been appointed by the City Council
as City Treasurer and Collector, succeed

was raised from $60,000 to $80,000. Mr Lu
cas has served the city as Clerk and
Councilman.
INITIATIVE LEFT
TO GENERAL TORAL
Spanish Minister of War's In
structions as to the Surrender
of Santiago.
MADRID, July 20. â A semi-official note has been pub
lished here explaining the circumstances, from a Spanish
standpoint, of the surrender of Santiago de Cuba. It de
clares that the letter which General Toral is alleged to have
written to General Shafter is apocryphal, as the telegraph
version contains a statement which it is impossible for Gen
eral Toral to have made, because it is untrue that his Gov
ernment authorized him to capitulate.
The note continues: "What happened was that the War
Minister received two telegrams from Captain-General
Blanco. The first described General Toral's position, which
was most pitiful, because of the want of provisions and am
munition. It also detailed the enemy's proposals. In the
second telegram Captain-General Blanco gave the terms of
capitulation and requested instructions. The War Minister re
plied to both by telling Captain-General Blanco to leave every
initiative to General Toral, for it was impossible to recom
mend any other line of conduct. General Toral, accordingly,
acted as he thought advisable, and would explain before a
court-martial the motives which caused him to capitulate."
FIELDS GETS
THE BLAME
Story of a Sacramento
Failure.
MIGHT HAVE BEEN AVERTED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT SAID
"ALL'S WELL."
Shareholders of the Union Building
and Loan Association Kept in
Ignorance by the
Expert.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, July 20.â The posi
tion of J. L. Fields, secretary to the
Commissioners on Building and Loan
Associations, is an unenviable one to
say the least. On December 16, 1896,
he made a report to the shareholders
of the Union Building and Loan Asso
ciation, of Sacramento, wherein he took
occasion to say, in the capacity of a
"public accountant," that the books
and accounts of the association were
in a "correct and satisfactory condi
tion." As a matter of fact it would be
most difficult to find the affairs of any
association in a more unsatisfactory or
deplorable condition.
In one instance in particular the ac
counts showed that four years inter
est was delinquent on a certain loan,
and in the aggregate it amounted to
more than the original note. In many
other instances it was evident that
ther there has been woeful lack of bus
iness sagacity. At the same time Mr.
Fields reported everything in a satis
factory condition.
One year later Major Weinstock,
chairman of a committee of stock
holders, appointed to look into the af
fairs of the association in order to dis
cover the purpose and intent of Â®*Â»ids'
report to the stockholders, addressed
to him the following communication:
Sacramento, Cal., Dec. 23, 1897.
Mr. J. L. Fields, Secretary Board of
Commissioners, U. B. and L. Association,
Mills Building, San Francisco, Cal.â Dear
Sir: At the meeting of the stockholders
of the Union Building and Loan Associa
tion, held on Wednesday, December 15,
Mr. E. K. Alslp, secretary, read a report
signed by you which conveyed the im
pression to the minds of his hearers that
you had carefully looked into the matters
of the association and had found every
thing entirely satisfactory. Was that the
impression you intended to convey to the
stockholders in your report? Your usual
prompt reply will oblige yours very truly,
H. WEINSTOCK,
Chairman of Committee of Stockholders.
Mr. Fields' reply was as follows:
San Francisco, December 24, 1897.
H. Weinstock Esq., Chairman Commit
tee of Stockholders Union Building and
Loan Association, Sacramento, Cal. â
Dear Sir: Yours of the 23d received ask
ing as to the impression I intended to
convey by the certificate that I made to
the report of the "Union" and read by
the secretary. First, I did not give a
certificate as "secretary" of this board;
what I did sign was as a "public account
ant," for I never have and never will
give a certificate as an official of this
board. I was asked to come to Sacra
mento and make up the annual report foi
Mr. AJsip; I put In over fourteen hours
on the work on the books, and at the
request of Mr. Stelnman and Mr. Dev
lin I made a certificate, as near as I can
now recall, in the following form:
"I have made an examination of the
books and accounts of the Union Build
ing and Loan Association for the fiscal
year ending December 14, 1897, and find
t*hem neatly and correctly kept and thai
all moneys received have been duly ac
counted for; the values of the shares hayÂ»
not been calculated, as these depend en
tirely on the value of the real estate
owned which is subject to appraisement
by a committee to be selected by your
selves, as per order of the Building and
Loan Commissioners.
"J. L. FIELDS, Public Accountant."
There had been rumors of a defalcation,
but I found that all moneys had been
properly entered and all payments had
been made by defendant, drawn on the
Treasurer and duly entered. Beyond this
the certificate does not go, and if it was
not read in full and as written It should
have been so read, for I never intended
otherwise and do not think that a correct
reading of the certificate can convey such
an impression; on the contrary, with the
valuations that I placed on the property,
I told Mr. Steinman, Mr. Devlin and Mr
Alsip that I could see no way but for the
association to close from that day and
go Into liquidation; still better judges ol
the values of real estate than myself
might put higher values on the property
than I do, as I based my values mainly
on my knowledge of the pro rata of the
assessed values, as given by the county
assessors to the market values and based
on the figures given for the whole State,
which are in possession of this office. On
that idea I agreed as a representative of
the Commissioners that the matter might
rest till the annual meeting and that
there should be a committee appointed
by the shareholders and that an adjourn
ment should be had for three weeks and
on their report the question of continu
ing or winding up should be determined.
Trusting that this may be a satisfac
tory explanation of my individual con
nection with the matter, I remain, yours
very truly. J. L. FIELDS.
It appears from Mr. Fields' version of
his employment that he was In no
manner acting in an official capacity.
DELAY IN THE
PLANNED ADVANCE
ON PORTO RICO
General Miles' Departure Defer
red Owing to a Caution to Com
plete All Arrangements.
WASHINGTON, July 20.â The War
and Navy departments are now en
gaged in making all of the arrange
ments for the dispatch of the Porto
Rican expedition and Watson's east
ern squadron. There has occurred one
of those natural pauses in the progress
of the campaign, incident to the com
pletion of one set of operations. There
being no possibility of the receipt of
news of a great battle or of a surren
der, there was less excitement and less
evidence of nervous strain than for
weeks past.
General Miles' expected departure
was again deferred. The explanation
given was that there was difficulty ex
pected at Santiago in securing the na
val convoy for the expedition. It Is
known, however, in addition, that the
President himself has restrained Gen
eral Miles to the extent of adjuring
him in earnest terms not to commit the
folly of starting for Porto Rico with
out the most complete preparation. The
Government has profited by the lessons
taught by the Santiago expedition.
Aside from the actual loss ot life that
might be expected as the result from
a badly calculated start, it is realized
that our relations with some of the
European powers would be, in a small
measure at least, impaired by the ad
verse moral effect created by anything
approaching a defeat for the American
arms at this stage of the war. There
fore, it is certain that so far as the de
partment can prevent. General Miles'
forces will not be short of food or of
tents to protect them from the tropi
cal rains, nor of the means for trans
portation that were so deficient at the
beginning of the Santiago movement.
General Miles reported this afternoon
that he had with him ten transports,
which, it is presumed, have aboard sev
eral thousand soldiers, although at
least two of them are fitted with equip
ment. The men aboard ship are suf
fering from delay, precisely as did the
soldiers who lay in Tampa Bay before
the departure of the Shafter expedition.
Inquiry made at the Navy Department
to ascertain where the delay had arisen
in securing convoys was met with the
statement that the orders to Admiral
Sampson in this matter were very gen
eral. He was simply directed by the
department to furnish a convoy, and
it was assumed that he would confer
At the same time a close Inspection of
his reply to Major Weinstock shows
that he became convinced of certain ir
regularities, called the attention of the
association officers to them, and then
withheld that information from thÂ«
stockholders. It also appears from his
letter that he extended to the officers
further time in which to adjust matters
he discovered were wrong, and in so
doing he was acting officially and not
as a mere "public accountant." The
letter of Major Weinstock plainly
shows what the impression left by Mr.
Fields 1 report was in the minds of
those to whom it was made. Thomas
Fox, in speaEing of the impression con
veyed by Mr. Fields' report to share
holders, said:
"When we read the report and Mr.
Fields said he had found things in a
correct and satisfactory condition, we
accepted it as such, and knowing that
it came from an expert, and one who
was officially connected with the board
of commissioners which has the super
vision of our affairs as an association,
we naturally thought that when he
used the term 'satisfactory' he did so
from every standpoint. As a matter
of fact, things were in a most unsat
isfactory condition, and Mr. Fields
should have so informed us."
There are many stockholders in Sac
ramento who believe that had Mr.
Fields reported things as he undoubt
edly found them the very serious and
deplorable wreck which followed might
have been averted. In 1897 Mr. Fields
made another report, which he men
tions in his letter to Major Weinstock.
While the terms used might have dif
fered in some respects from those em
ployed in his report of 1596. the impres
sion conveyed was the same, and he
left the stockholders still in the dark
concerning the true state of affairs.
The question uppermost in the minds
of many who have sustained loss by

with General Miles as to the numbet
and character of vessels required for
that purpose. As the campaign, from
a naval point of view, is to be princi
pally a land movement, the naval of
ficers do not believe a very extensive
convoy is necessary.
According to the calculations at the
Navy Department, Admiral Dewey s
fleet at Cavite should now be reinforc
ed by the coast defense vessel Monte
rey, which, with the collier Brutus has
now been about twenty days out from
Honolulu. With the addition of this
fine and powerful monitor, Dewey will
be amply able to take care of himself
so long as the naval forces in the
Philippines are maintaining the rela
tive proprortions -they now occupy.
Howeyer, the disclosure by the State
Department of the lack of foundation
for the sensational stories of strained
relations with Germany has largely
abated the anxiety entertained at the
Navy Department as to Dewey's posi
tion at Manila.
The War Department was agreeably
surprised at the number of bids receiv
ed in answer to its proposals for trans
porting the Spaniards now at Santiago
to Cadiz. The terms offered by some
of the companies were also regarded as
very reasonable, and it is desirable to
terminate the present condition of af
fairs at Santiago at the earliest pos
sible moment. It is expected the
award will be made immediately. The
bid from the Spanish Steamship Com
pany was a surprise to the department
officials and at least one of them
thought that it might be food policy
for the Government to avail itself of
its offer.
Dr. Greenleafs last report to Secre
tary Alger from the American camp at
Santiago came this aftern .n and was
to the effect that while the yellow fever
was widely spread among the troops,
it was very mild in form. General Duf
field, who has been suffering from the
disease, was reported to be improving
yesterday.
The open statement from the Cuban
legation here to-day, made to the
War department officials, that they
were prepared to accept as proper the
programme laid down by General Shaf
ter for the government of affairs at
Santiago, is but a prelude, It is hoped,
to instructions from that body to the
Cuban generals in the field, General
Gomez and others, that will tend to
prevent a repetition of the conduct
that has jeopardized the relations be
tween the American and Cuban sol
diers.
the recent failure of the Union Build
ing and Loan Association is: Wherein
does the official capacity of Mr. Ftelds
commence, and his employment as a
"public accountant' end? The line of
distinction between the two has no
doubt been drawn by Mr. Fields, but
those who have suffered from his si
lence as an official, and his public dec
larations as an accountant, do not un
derstand, and will never understand,
the discrimination.
FBICTION LIKELY TO ARISE.
Relations Between France and Hayti
Decidedly Strained.
PORT AU PRINCE, Hayti, July 20.â
It is rumored here that some friction
is likely to arise between France and
[ the Haytien republic. In spite of the
remonstrances and urgent demands of
the French Minister the Haytien Gov
ernment still refuses to abrogate the
recent decree of expulsion issued
against Mme. Hermanle, a French sub
ject, who was expelled as a person dan
gerous to public security shortly after
her notorious collision in the cathedral
with Mme. Simon Sam, wife of the
President. The Government is much ir
ritated by certain articles damaging to
Hayti that have recently appeared in
the Matin, the Libre Parole, the Au
torite and other Parisian Journals.
At the dinner given by the President
at the palace to-day to the members of
the diplomatic corps the only foreig-n
representative absent was the French
Minister. The relations between the
two governments are evidently much
trained.

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 19, by
Thf rail-Herald dispatch-boat to Port
Antonio, Jamaica. July 20.â Civil or
der has been completely restored in
Bantiago, and no excessive celebrations
of victory are permitted. All cafes were
closed last night, for the authorities
are anxious that nothing shall mar the
good impression made by the orderly
manner in which the city was trans-
Cerred from Spanish to American rule.
Spanish and United States troops
yesterday were both patronizing places
where intoxicants were sold and drink
ing toasts to each other from well-filled
glasses.
The municipal authorities thought it
better to r< strain the joyousness of the
victory fur the present. Stores where
food and clothing are for sale are be
ing reopened, and Americans are the
mere. The soldiers are much
in need of wearing apparel, and now,
for the first time since their landing on
Cuban soil, they have begun to take
is to their raiment.
The food problem will soon be solved,
for <; a 1 transports entered the
harbor to-day and besan to discharge
their cargoes. This greatly simplifies
the work of the commissary depart
ment, which no longer has to arrange
for the transportation of supplies over
muddy trails. Santiago is still de
pending upon wells and cisterns for her
water supply. The supply from out-
Bide of the city is still cut off. It will
probably be restored in a day or two.
Engineers were sent to-day to repair
the pipp.s which broken by the
American troops in order to divert the
the water supply.
Most of the citizens of Santiago are
delighted with American rule. Exceed
ingly cordial relations exist between
the officers and soldiers of both armies.
They met and fraternized In the cafes,
which were open yesterday. The places
were filled with groups, invariably
composed of wearers of both uniforms,
chatting and exchanging reminiscences
of th ' unpleasantness. Many
Spanish and American officers ex
changed swords as remembrances of
the campaigns- The sentiment through
nut th> a American army is vastly more
fav< rable to the Spaniards than to
th* 3 Cubans. The Cubans have not been
permitted to enter the city, in accord
ance with the promise made by Gen
eral Wheeler to GeneralTcral. Even the
Cuban residents feel that it is better
that th-?ir compatriots should not come
into the city at present. The Ameri
can troops in the city consist only of a
skeleton regiment acting as a provost
guard, and some officers. The main
body of the army is on the hills, with
every man eager to get a glimpse of the
interior >t the conquered city.
Dr. OfiOndo Oerkfi, representative!
of the American Medical Society, and
Dr. G Ifellow of General Shafter's
staff, reported to-day to the command
ing general the results of their exam
ination nf th" sanitary condition of the
city. They said the water supply would
be inadequate even when the pipes were
repaired. There is no sewerage, and the
accumulated filth of the city is carried
into the bay by means of surface
drainage. Affairs will be practically
r.ormal in Santiago in a day or two. No
definite date has been set for moving
the American troops. The regiments
will remain in camp on the heights
about the city until it is certain they
have contracted no contagious diseases.
Then thÂ«>y will be loaded on transports
bound for Porto Rico or the United
States.

HAVANA, July 20.â An American ship last Saturday fired 100
shots at a distance at the port of Santa Cruz del Sur without do
ing any damage. Another American ship on Sunday fired 100 shots
at Santa Cruz on the north coast, near Jaruco.
Spanish troops in a battle with a large band of insurgents at
Aqua Villas hill killed five insurgents and captured some arms, am
munition and cattle. The insurgents during the battle exploded
three dynamite bombs. Two Spanish soldiers and one officer were
seriously wounded, and one officer and ten soldiers were slightly
wounded. Ninety kilometers out from Havana on the western
railroad a bomb was exploded under the engine and armored car of
the passenger train coming from Pinar del Rio. The engineer and
stoker were injured. The brigade commanded by the former in
surgent Masso y Para has been carrying on effective operations
against the insurgents near Slguanea and Ciequa. Some battal
ions of Masso's brigade which went recently to Manzanlllo are re
ported to have behaved admirably in defense of that place.

The trades and business houses open
ed their doors for the first time to-day,
cleared their .varehouses and made
ready for the receipt of goods. All the
stores are open this morning.
The pawn shops are doing a rushing
business, their shops being crowded by
all sorts of people pawning heirlooms,
clothes, dresses and furniture.
Officers tender their medals, spurs
and swords, and civil employes their
tortoise shell, gold-headed canes of of
fice for a mere song, which are in turn
bought at fancy prices by American
soldiers, officers or newspaper corres
pondents, as relics of war. ihere have
been more machetes sold to our men
as souvenirs than were laid down on
the morning of the surrender, and
crosses, service stripes and orders are
cheerfull- parted with for American
cash.
There is no ready-made clothing In
the city except blue and white striped
linen uniforms, and many of our men
are dressed in these Spanish uniforms.
They present a strange appearance and
are greeted with laughter. The readi
ness and avidity with which the store
keepers accept greenbacks is remark
able.
Many of the Spanish soldiers are
anxious to become American citizens
and are applying for naturalization

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, July 20.â The steamer
Lakme, which arrived here to-day from
St. Michael brings news that the river
Menen Alfred J. Beach and \V. H.
Evans, which were being towed to the
mouth of the Yukon River, are total
wrecks. When some 250 miles out from
Dixon entrance the Beach hoisted a
signal of distress. She soon began to
leak badly. Finally her condition be
came so bad that her twenty-four pas
sengers took to the boats. They
reached the Evans in safety. In a
short time the Beach went down.
The captain of the Noyo then re- '
turned to Dixon entrance and beached !
the Evans. By the time he arrived at
American Bay she was all but a wreck.
The passengers were transferred to the
Noyo, which proceeded to St. Michael.
The Alfred J. Beach was the prop- ,

Those arriving on the Lakme with
the largest amounts of gold were
two French-Canadian families named
L'Heureaux and Ciulleid. They carried
two large leather grips filled with dust

AGNEWS SCANDAL
WILL BE PROBED
TO THE BOTTOM
State Board of Lurjacy to Tal^e the
Affair Out of the Local Board's
rjands.
SACRAMENTO, July 20.â At a meet
ing of the State Lunacy Commission
to-day the state of affairs at the Ag
news Asylum, as described in The Call,
was taken up officially by Secretary of
State L. H. Brown, who offered the
following resolution:
Resolved, That, pursuant to the
power vested in this commission by
law, an investigation of the affairs
of the State Hospital at Agnews be
had, and that the Attorney-General
be requested, under section 12 of the
act creating the commission, to con
duct said investigation.
Dr. Mathews opposed the resolution, j
on the ground that the Attorney Gen- >
eral had no more business with the af
fair than had the commissioners pres- i
ent. He maintained that it was a re- i
sponsibility which neither Mr. Brown
nor anybody else should shirk. Affairs
were some time ago represented to be
equally as scandalous at the Napa ,
Asylum, and yet Mr. Brown had intro- j
duced no resolution calling for an in- i
vestigation.
"Didn't I try to get at the facts !
at that time?" demanded Secretary
Brown. "You know why we couldn't â
we were not permitted to get at the i
facts.
"I want now to get at the bottom of
the facts concerning Dr. Sponogle,"
continued Secretary Brown, "arid if in ;
order to do that we have to investigate
every asylum in the State I am per
fectly willing to do so."
He said he wanted the truth of the
scandal and would not accept the
whitewashing reports of local boards.
A motion was made by Dr. F. M.
Hatch, calling for a meeting of the
commission in San Francisco on Satur
day next, at which Brown's resolution
was to be considered. Secretary of
State Brown opposed this motion on
the ground that the State capitol was
in Sacramento and he did not believe
in running all over the State after peo
ple whom It was proposed to investl- ;
gate. They could come to the cap'.tul !
as easily as the capitol could go hunt- :
ing after them. He said that he would
oppose any resolution including Napa
and other State asylums as subjects for !
investigation, because no charges had
been filed respecting them. He believ
ed Napa was as bad as any of them;
"but," he added, turning to Dr. Ma
thews, "you know what the power was
which prevented our getting at th*> ;
truth. I will not mention it here. [
know that certain powers wanted to
whitewash that Napa affair. The Napa
board ignored the charegs. They have
even violated the civil service rules
there. I think it is rotten now."
"Well, then, why didn't you do some- j
thing?" asked Dr. Mathews. "Did you â¢
ever bring in a resolution?"
"No. You know why. For three
months we tried to get a report."
At this Juncture a vote was taken on
the motion calling for the meeting in
San Francisco. All save Secretary
Brown voted for it. He said he would j
not be there.
When Dr. Mathews was asked what,
in his opinion. Mr. Brown meant when
he said: "You know, doctor, why we
were not permitted to get at the facts,"
the doctor replied:
"No one can with any decree of cer
tainty tell what another man means by
any expression not entirely clear, but
it is my opinion that Secretary of State
Brown had Attorney-General Fitzger
ald in his mind when he made that re
mark."
Secretary Brown, having been asked
the same question, replied: "In the
first place, there has always been a
very serious difference existing be
tween our State board and the local !
boards of these institutions. There has ;
been a constant conflict, and but two |
members of our board have been ready I
to conduct thes-3 investigations when
our attention has been called to the
abuses and scandals which have con
stantly been reported.
"What I meant when I addressed
myself to Dr. Mathews was that we
were refused certain proofs which were
In the hands of the local board at
Napa for several months. The local
board had reports from certain detec
tives It employed, which showed that
about forty of the employes had been
guilty of gross misconduct. In many
Instances Involving them In absolute,
theft. Before our board was permitted
to see these reports, a mapority of
the guilty ones had been discharged.
Had these obstacles been removed we
could have made a thorough Investi
gation and reported accordingly. As
it was, the local board applied a whole
some supply of whitewash and covered
up the abuses by discharging a few of
the guilty ones.
"In my opinion the Investigation at
Agnews will result in a similar action,
if left to the local board. The au
thority of our State board ha* been
questioned, and until the entire board
stands together and sustains itself as
a body there will be no use or advan
tage coming from the statute which
created the State Lunacy Commission."
MORE INSIGHT TO
AGNEWS' CONDITION
SAN JOSE, July 20.â As early as last
December Frank H. Gould, that would
be apostle of Democracy, had begun to
formulate plans to oust Miss Ella
Royse from the matronship at Agnews
Asylum. This was in order to make
room for Miss Bambauer, his Merced
Importation.
Louis E. H. de Sallier, who was an
attendant at the asylum, visited Mr.
Gould at his office in San Francisco
about Christmas time and asked him
to support him for the vacancy that
existed In the position of dairyman.
De Sallier told him that Trustees Hale
and Curnow had promised to work for
him. Gould then promised De Sallier
he would do what he could to get him
a place. Gould asked De Sallier to keep
his eyes open and if he saw any crook
edness going on to let him know of it.
He said Miss Bambauer was well fitted
for the position of matron. Inquiry
was made as to what kind of a man
Berry, & carpenter at the asylum, was.
De Sallier does not remember distinctly
whether Miss Royse's name was men
tioned In connection with Miss Bam
bauer, but thinks it was. He concluded
from his interview with Gould that if
he could secure evidence to bring about
Miss Royse's dismissal from her posi
tion as matron he would be made
dairyman or something better. De Sal
lier told Gould that if he kept his eyes
open and reported to him it would be
the truth regardless of on whose head
it fell.
De Sallier was seen at his home at
San Martin to-day. He was appointed
an attendant at Agnews Asylum
through the influence of Trustee Hale
on August 1, 1897. After holding the
position nine months he resigned. De \
Lassier said there was inharmony in
the internal workings of the hospital
and he thought it best to get out before
there was a general mix-up and scan- I
dal. Unless one was a pet of the ad- I
ministration there was little chance for |
favors, and the continual warring
among the various factions was disa
greeable. He said Miss Royse was fair- |
ly liked, bore an excellent reputation j
and performed her duties well. He was
there nine months and saw Miss Royse
every day and never saw her under the
influence of liquor, as intimated by 'â 
Mrs. Fadden in the yellow journal of j
San Francisco. If she had indulged in
It at all he would have heard it from
some of the girls or men employed as |
attendants.
De Lassier said the Tourtillott-Madi
gan scandal was common gossip about
the institution, and in January last he !
called Dr. Sponogle's attention to it. j
At that time Dr. Sponogle called De â 
Lassier into the office and reprimanded !
him for talking to female attendants in j
the corridors. De Lassier asked why j
he was made an example of when he
talked to the young ladies openly, I
while he (Sponogle) knew Tourtillott
and Mrs. Madigan sneaked around in
back stairways and talked for hours at
a time. In answer to this Sponogle
said:
"You know how that is; he [meaning
Tourtillott] is Frank H. Gould's bro
ther, and you know what position I am
in."
De Lassier says Mrs. Williams bore :
an excellent reputation, and was a fa- ;
vorite with the Inmates. He knows
Bessie Bailey and Ed Herbert, and said
their escapade was really the fault of
Dr. Sponogle. Miss Bailey's mania was
of a mild nature, and the medical di
rector allowed her to take daily walks ;
with the female attendants. On these
occasions Herbert was always along,
and allowing these two to come to
gether so much was the means of mak
ing them lovers. Sponogle knew they
were together a great deal, because it j
was necessary to secure his permission
to take the young lady out.
CALL FOR THE INQUIRY
NOT YET ISSUED
SAN JOSE, July 20.â Chairman Cur
now of the Agnews Asylum trustees
has not yet issued the call for a special
meeting to Investigate the charges of
immorality made by Charles Williams
against T. T. Tourtillott and Mrs, K.
Madigan. To-day he gave the same
stereotyped answer that the meeting
would be held the first of next week.
The excuse now being made for not
holding the investigation sooner is that
Attorney Bowden, who Is to represent
Dr. Sponogle, is busy in court.
The affidavit made by Detective Er
win Frost that he was hired by White
to obtain evidence against Sponogle is
not taken seriously and it has placed
him in a rather peculiar position. It
is said that at last night's meeting
Sponogle stated that Frost was trying
to blackmail him and that associated
with him in this was Henry S. Weit
man, a brother of the first Mrs. Spon
ogle. It is known positively that Welt
man was in town several weeks ago.
Now Frost, not knowing that Spon
ogle had formed this opinion of the
reason that prompted him to make the
charges, made affidavit that White had
hired him to dig up evidence against
Sponogle in order to force the' latter to
put back Miss Royse.
The statement of Sponogle is being
genrally credited and Frost's affidavit
has fallen flat and is regarded as the
peculiar eccentricity of an excited man
who has had the props knocked out
from under the pedestal upon which he
has been standing.
ALASKAN VESSELS TO
BE USED AS TRANSPORTS
Lakme, Tillamook and Alliance Char
tered and Two Others Soon to
Be Acquired.
SEATTLE, July 20.â The Government,
as represented by the Johnson-Locke
Mercantile Company of San Francisco
and Seattle, has chartered several steam
ers to carry soldiers to Uncle Sam's new
possessions In the Pacific. The vessels
procured are the Lakme, Tillamook and
Alliance, and negotiations are almost
closed for the Charles Nelson. The four
steamers are now engaged on the Alaska
run between Seattle and St. Michael. A
deal is on foot for the chartering of the
steamship Columbia.
The Lakme arrived in port to-day, and
as soon as sho can be made ready she
will be sent to San Francisco to be turned
over to Major Long. The other vessels
will reach here from the north in the
course of a week. These transports have
accommodations for about 3000 soldiers.
Tue Climate of Cuba.
Because of frequent rains in Cuba, malarial
fevers are a common ailment therp, Just as
they are In many sections of the United
States. Ailments of this kind, no matter in
what part of the globe they occur, are quickly
cured with Hostetter's Stomach Bitters. Be-
sides beins a specific for malarial troubles,
these Bitters also make pure blood, strong
nerves and muscles, and firm, healthy flesh.
They have no equal for dyspepsia and con-
stipation.

BUT THOSE DOVES
WISELY MIGRATED.
Then Heard That Jeff Bolton and Fred
Butler Were After Them in a
Wing Shot Contest.
IN thÂ© excitement of the alarms
and victories of war there are mo
mentous events transpiring In
this fair land that are not receiv
ing the publio attention to which
their Importance entitles them. At
the present writing probably the
most absorbing matter In a sport-
Ing way Is the great Bhootlng con
test between Jeff Bolton, the well
known engraver, bon vlvant and
good fellow generally, and Fred
Butler, widely known among Insur
ance men, artists and the lovers of
field sports.
Bolton has never fired a shotgun,
but Is clever with the rifle, while
Butler Is a crackajack at wing
shooting. There were two wagers
on the results. The first was a din
ner at a swell French restaurant for
seven capable "feeders," Bolton
agreeing to kill as many doves as
his competitor. The second wager
was for a fine hat, Butler proposing
to bag five doves to Bolton's one.
After the bets were made Bolton
concluded that he had taken an
alarming contract and he put In
many weary hours Interviewing the
best shots in the city as to the
surest way to do the "Dewey and
Schley act," and also in securing mu
nitions of war. The latter consist
of four guns of different gauge, 1000
shells, two retrievers and a "gillie"
to carry his extra howitzers. He had
a straw-colored suit and a hat of the
same color, constructed from a good
sized umbrella.
"You see this Is all new business
to me," said Bolton, prior to his de
parture for the field of contest. "I
make a snap shot with a camera
first rate, but that won't kill doves.
However, I have talked with Gol
ehr>r. 'Billy 1 Kittle, Charlie Fisher.
"Billie" Brown and a lot of the
other dead shots and I guess I
will win out all right. They advise
me to use ten, twelve, fourteen and
sixteen inch bore guns and I have
secured them. I have a thousand
shells, a couple of good retrievers
and a boy to carry the extra guns
and any surplus of game. I am in
formed that the doves are so thick
up Niles way that one can't miss
them, and I am going to take advan
tage of Butler by shooting two guns
at once. If he can beat that cinch I
will get off the earth in disgust.
"They said something about the
rules barring 'pot shooting,' a term
which they did not explain to me.
Butler only shoots on the fly. and so
I have another surprise for him. I
is said that the birds are around the
water holes over there by the hun
dreds. All I need is to find them on
the ground In droves and turn loose
FOUR MEN WERE
SLAIN BY LIGHTNING
And Five Others Who Sought Shelter
Under a Tree Seriously-
Injured.
NEW YORK, July 20.â New Jersey and
part of New York were swept last night
by a storm, which caused great destruc
tion to life and property. Four men were
etruck by lightning and instantly killed,
and five others were badly injured while
eeeklng shelter from the storm under a
tree near Boonton, N. J. The dead, all of
Boonton, were: James Quick, 27 years
old; John Risschynsky, 20 years old; John
Valentine, 30 years old; Clarence Todd, 14
years old.
The Injured are: John Bott of Boonton,
hurt internally, not expected to live; Lou-
Is Todd of Boonton, burned and paralyzed;
John Quick of Boonton, paralyzed; John
Sweeney of Boonton, paralyzed.

up the other fellow plenty. If he
thinks I am going to bother with
trying to hit a single bird flying a
hundred miles a minute he can pay
for the terrapin and other things.
I understand his scheme Is to shoot
six feet ahead of the doves and let
them collide with the shot. That is
too much like trying to hit a bolt of
lightning, and I draw the line right
there.
"Butler may win the dinner by a
scratch, but I figure that if I kill
five hundred doves out of my thou
sand shells he will be lost, for he
will have to kill 2501, and that would
embarrass a bank to buy the ammu
nition, aside from the wear and tear
on his nerves and gun. Of course,
it will be tough on the dogs to re
trieve all this game, but they are
active and ought to stand the exer
tion.
"I have made arrangements to
have the birds packed in gunny
sacks, so they can be shipped home
by express. So If there Is any se
rious dearth of doves in the market
after this week I suppose the blame
will rest with me. Still it is to be a
contest of skill and the slaughter
must go on, all same the Oregon and
the Spaniards. The redeeming fea
ture is that my friends will not have
to buy any meat for a week, and In
return therefor they have agreed to
meet me at the ferry with a brass
band. However, they did not state
whether It would be a dog collar or
real wind-jammers."
Up to the time of leaving for the
seat of war Butler "sawed wood"
very carefully, but dropped a re
mark that was of great import to
his rival.
"I don't propose," said he to a ;
sympathizing friend, "to pay for the :
terrapin, wine or hat if there are 'â 
any country gamins up that way i
pot-shooting for the market. I will :
be the market." !
Final reports last night from the :
seat of war give the gross and net
results. Butler had plenty of birds :
for his friends, but Bolton had none.
He says he did not know that there
were kids selling doves in that sec
tion. Butler says that the only
thing Jeff struck was a son-strokeâ
i. c., he was hit by a turnip thrown
by a farmer's son for trespassing.

RIGID ENFORCEMENT
OF EXCLUSION ACT
Important Ruling of Assistant Sec
retary Howell on Admission
of Chinese.
WASHINGTON, July 20âAsslstant
Secretary Howell of the Treasury De
partment made a ruling in regard to the
admission into the United States of Chi
nese persons which is more comprehen
sive in its restrictions than any hitherto
made since the passage of the Chinese
exclusion act. This action was in ac
cordance with an opinion of the Attor
ney General, who holds, in effect, that
the exclusion act applies to all classes
of Chinese persona other than those spe
cifically named in the act. The only ex
ceptions, therefore, are officials, teachers
students, merchants or travelers for cu
riosity or pleasure. It is estimated that
the number of persons hitherto admitted
but hereafter to be excluded will aggre
gate several thousand a year The fol
lowing letter of instructions, based upon
the Attorney Generals opinion, has been
sent to the Collector of Customs at San
X' rancisco:
WASHINGTON', July 20, 1898.
Collector of Customs, San Franciscoâ Sir-
KeR-rring to your communication of the 14th
UK., In relation to the appeal from your de
cision rejecting the application of Wonj Yook
bun. a Chinese person, seeking admission to
this country as a trader and confirming the
telegTÂ«rn sent to you on the 19th inst., you
are informed that in an opinion, dated the
lath inst.. the Honorable Attorney General
nolds> that Chinese persons known as traders
should not be allowed to land in this coun
try, even though they submit the certificate
prescribed by the act approved July 5 ism
relating to the admission of Chinese. I in
close herewith for your information a cony
of the opinion of the Attorney General and in
vite your particular attention to that Doctlon
of it in which he says:
"It may ba stated comprehensively that the
result of the whole body of these laws and
decisions thereon is to determine that the true
theory Is not that all Chinese persons may en
ter this country who are not forbidden but
that only those are entitled to enter who are
expressly allowed."
You are therefore directed to hereafter re
fuse admission to all Chinese persons whose oc
cupation or station does not clearly indicate
that they are members of the exempt class of
Chinese as defined by the law, and applica
tions for admission for persons described aa
salesmen, clerks, buyers, bookkeepers, account
ants, managers, storekeepers, apprentices
agents, cashiers, physicians, proprietors of

CAMP MONTGOMERY, Santa Rosa,
July 20. â "Halt and salute the colors"
is the command that rings out sharp
and clear to the visitors at the camp
of the League of the Cross Cadets,
from the sentry who is stationed near
the flag poleâ that is, if visitors should
by any chance neglect to raise their
hats on passing the Stars and Stripes,
that flutter on a big flagpole at the en
trance of Camp Montgomery. Some of
the strangers blush and look embar
rassed at their ignorance of camp
rules, but they remove their hats just
the same, to pay homage to the flag.
To-day the guardhouse contained no
prisoners, and Father Dempsey, who
is loved by everybody in camp, was in
a measure disappointed, as he had pro
curred several dozen bottles of ginger
ale to distribute to the prisoners during
their term in durance vile. One small
cadet in Company F was sent back to
San Francisco to-day, for disobeying
orders. The lad, accompanied by sev
eral companions, visited an orchard,
owned by Mrs. Rogers. Town Consta
ble G. H. Boswell was informed of the
forage and swooped down upon the
party. There was a lively chase. The
small boy was handicapped by weight
of forage and Constable Boswell caught
him. He was released after having
been warned by the constable, but
Colonel Sullivan decided that he be
made an example of and he was ac
cordingly sent home.
Soon after guard mount this morn
ing, stages, drawn by four horses,
double seated rockaways and single
horse rigs, began to line up opposite
the company streets and the vehicles
were soon filled with the youngsters,
who drove to the neighboring mineral
springs to spend the day, singing and
shouting all the way.
To-night the camp was the scene of
a big reception tendered to citizens of
Santa Rosa. Elaborate preparations
having been made, the affair was a
great success.
The sickest boy in camp to-day was
Private Louis Shipley of Company E.
He was unable to drill to-day after
having taken a fifty-mile ride on horse
back.
Company A looks forward with pleas
ure to a visit from Lieutenant F. S.
Drady of the Eighth California Volun
teers some day this week. Lieutenant
Drady formerly was captain of A and
resigned his command to accept a com
mission in the volunteers.
The Rev. Father Cullen of Sacred
Heart parish San Francisco, is here.
He will remain the balance of the week,
a guest of Colonel Sullivan. The field
and staff officers were the guests of
the Rev. Father Cassin, vicar of Santa
Rosa, at dinner to-day.
Great disappointment is expressed
by the officers of the regiment at the
departure of Lieutenant Steele of Com
pany A, which takes place on Friday.
The lieutenant is one of the commit
tee on the field day sports for Satur
day. He received a telegTam yester
day from his employer, telling him to
return to San Francisco on Friday.
Harry and William Davis, nephews
of the Rev. Father Yorke, visited the
camp yesterday. They were the guests
of Colonel Sullivan.

P Every man is given a oertain amount of that element which we call "vital force" to
start on. If he nurses it and cares for it he will be a strong man at sixty.
But it is like your balance in bank. If you draw on it every day and make no
amends for the waste, you are sure to break down the structure.
"THREE CLASSES OF MEN."
It is upon this subject that Dr. Sanden, famous as a physician and scientist, has
written his now famous book, "Three Classes of Men," touching upon the various causes of
the breaking down of the vital structure. It is for young men, middle-aged and old men.
It is full of truths which will appeal to every man who finds his physical and vital force
declining from whatever cause. You ought to read it. It is free upon application.
Dr. Sanden, in this book, proves that the basis of all vital, nerve and organic
' strength is electricity. Some of the smartest men in the land agree that electricity is the
instrumentality of all animal life. It is upon this idea that Dr. Sanden constructed his
now celebrated appliance, \y '.â ''.'
DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT.
It is to fill the nerves and organs with electricity every night while you sleep.
When you awake in the morning you are refreshed, wideawake and full of the joy of living,
for your nerves are charged with the vim, the snap and "go >* ,***&&Â£&>'
of life. Weakness vanishes, the drains and nervous spells *~JffltL 9^
cease, and you soon recover all the vigor of a strong man. /^SlÂ® fS&fr&Ljr

PLEA FOR LESS TAX.
Equalizers Hear the Carson and Colo
rado Railway's .Representative.
SACRAMENTO, July 20.-To-day's ses
sion of the State Board of Equalization
was devoted to the hearing of the appli
cation of the Carson and Colorado Rail
road Company for a reduction from $230,
000 to $70,000 on the assessment of that
portion of the road operated in California-
There were present In behalf of the road
Superintendent R. T. Lewis, J. F. Burke
and H. H. Taylor.
In support of the petition, Mr. Burko
read a lengthy statement to the effect thai,
the assessment heretofore levied was
greatly In excess of the actual value oi
the property. He said the actual value
of Its franchise, roadbed, track and roll
ing stock in the State was $70,000. ThÂ«
shares of stock of the company had no
market value. The actual value of the
entire property of the company did not
exceed $200,666. The net earnings for the
year ending June 30, 1897, after payment
of taxes, were $11,673. During the past
five years the floating unsecured Indebt
edness of the company Incurred in mak
ing renewals and betterments required to
keep the road in operating condition haa
grown so as to amount to $335,000 on June
30, 1897, from which It was apparent that
the company's property really was oper
ated at a loss.
After the petition had been thoroughly
discussed by all parties present, the board
took the matter under advisement and ad
journed until to-morrow.

GALE WRECKS
FISHING CRAFT
Lives Lost on Fraser
River.
SMALL VESSELS CAPSIZED
FIVE MEN DROWNED AND TEN
MISSING.
But for the Timely Appearance of a
Tug the Death List Would
Have Numbered
Scores.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, July 20.â A. E. Tre
gent, the well-known salmon canner of
this city, returned to-day after a visit
to his Fraser River canneries with a
story of death and disaster to many of
the fishermen, due to the recent fierce
gales along the coast.
Almost every day since the salmon
season opened high winds have pre
vailed, greatly interfering with fishing
operations.
Two days ago, while hundreds of
fishermen were engaged several miles
of the mouth of the Fraser, they were
struck by a gale which threw their
frail shells against one another and
emptied many of the occupants Into the
ocean. Great excitement followed, in
tensified by the cries and lamentations
of many "klootchmen," who accompa
nied their husbands on the trip. At the
time there must have been 150 boats
strung out along the coast, and had it
not been for the timely assistance of a
tup the loss of life would have been ap
palling.
In the struggle for life which follow
ed the squall five fishermen went down,
never to rise again.
Ten more are said to be missing, but
the full extent of the fatality will not
be known for several days, when the
head men of the fleet will reach West
minster.
The scene Immediately after the dis
aster was, according to an eye-witness,
one never to be forgotten. Many of the
small boats had been crushed in like
egg shells and their owners clung to
them like half drowned rats, in several
caseo fighting like madmen for safe po
sitions. So convinced were many of the
Indian fishermen that their last hour
had arrived that they sent up their
weird death song and did not close It
even when the tu<? arrived.
ALL-CHICA6OS THE
CRICKET CHAMPIONS
OMAHA, July 20.â A11-Chicago settled
the championship of the Northwestern
Cricket Association this afternoon by de
feating Manitoba In a one-inning match
by 155 to 132. The match was very pretty
and was won by the sharp fielding of
Chicago. The heavy batters of the Cana
dians seemed afraid of the bowling.
Minnesota beat Denver by four wick
ets. In the first inning the mountain
eers were all out for forty, and in the
following inning they declared their in
nings closed, with 76 for seven wickets.
Minnesota went In with forty-five min
utes to play and 44 runs to make. This
was accomplished. Calks, for Denver, did
the only batting worthy of notice, carry
ing his bat for 41 in the second inning.
Edmonds and Goodwin of Minnesota
bowled a terrific gait, and their hitting
was fully as strong as their trundling.
They got 20 and 21, respectively.
Results of Chess Games.
VIENNA, July 20.â The thirty-fifth

spectively, Baird, Trenchard and Wal
brodt. After recess Stelnitz beat Llpke,
Caro lost to Marco, Burn and Blackburne

Tarrasch downed Schlffers and Halprln

"WINDY AND DISAGREEABLE."
When a man blows wind off his stomach, that is flatulence.)
Sometimes people call it gulping *md. . No matter what you call it^
the disease, for it is a disease, is an annoying one to you and disgust*,
ing.to your friends. I once heard a politician speak of a rival, whom â¢
he ' did not admire, as a flatulent old fool. Flatulent means windysr
Usually we mean by it wind collected in the stomach. Wind in thoj
intestines may also be -. just as properly designated flatulence. It is)
always caused by indigestion, A physician, who practices in a toww
near Albany, New York, reports the case of an old gentleman who 5
had been so annoyed by a persistent condition of flatulence that hcl
had consulted all the doctors in the vicinity without securing any?
' benefit . M Finally he came to me and I prescribed several remedies,
which failed utterly. . I then prescribed Ripans Tabules, which he re-;
ported gave him immediate relief, and he is now nearly cured. X think)
it would be an excellent thing to make a strong feature of â  flatulence V

TO SAIL SATURDAY
THE Seventh California Volun
teers have received direct assur
ances from President McKinley
that the regiment will sail for
Manila on the transport Scandia.
The facts were placed before the
President by Governor Budd and Sen
ator Perkins, hence the desire of the
volunteers for active service at the
front will soon be gratified.
At the Presidio there is talk that
Major General Shafter will shortly re
turn to San Francisco and take com
mand of the Department of California.
Occasionally officers get a hint
through private telegrams from in
fluential friends of contemplated
changes. It was remarked yesterday
by an officer: "I believe General
Shafter will be here within three
â week?. He has finished his work at
Bantiago and will not care to stay
there any longer. Should he express
a desire to return here the War De
partment would probably comply with
his request."
The clerical force in the adjutant
generals office at Washington must
be rattled. Statements wired to the
press of the country on the authority
of that office give anything but a cor
rect record of the number of men en
listed under the President's second
call for volunteers. Day before yes
terday The Call received a dispatch
letting forth that "California was
slow in responding to the second call
for troops, having supplied only 624
men." Th-- dispatch was promptly
thrown in the waste basket as rubbish,
because the- fact was well known to
every one who cared to give the sub
ject "the plierht^st attention that a regl
ment numbering more than twelve
hundred men, recruited under the sec
ond call, was encamped at Sather sta
tion in Alameda County.
Adjutant General Karrett was noti
fied, however, that some of the stupid
and Incompetent clerks in General Cor-
Mn's office in Washington were giving
out for publication misleading and
lering statements which were cal
culated to bring discredit on the State
of California. General Barrett at once
raphed to the War Department
that California had furnished 2453 men
under the second call. The Washing
ton correspondent of this paper was
also directed to investigate and ascer
tain why the adjutant general's office
gave out such erroneous figures. In re-
Bnonse to this direction the following
dispatch was received last night:
WASHINGTON. July 20.â Complaints
have come in to-day from several
States that the number of men en
listed under the President's second call,
as given out on the authority of the
adjutant general's office, is incorrect.
Figures from one official to-day give
California's enlistment under the sec
ond call as being 1 near the quota, or a
full regiment, but the exact number is
not obtainable. The adjutant general's
office pays California cannot have fur
nished 2453 men under the second call,
as that is far in excess of the number
required. It is not explained how the
number nf enlisted was announced yes
terday as being 624. and to-day con
ceded' to be little less than 1300.
Qalftornta is not the only State that
ha? been misrepresented by the Wash
ington authorities. Oregon has been
I in a false light before the coun
try, as the following telegram ex
plains:
PORTLAND. Or., July 20.âRegard
inc the statement from "Washington
that Oregon is behind in furnishing
her quota troops under the second
call. Adjutant General Tuttle of the
n National Guard to-day said:
â  The statement that Oregon is behind
in furnishing her quota of troops is
unjust and is not correct. The troops
â¢u-ere recruited and furnished promptly.
Th<-* delay has been in mustering in the
men, for which the State is not re
sponsible. Four hundred and nineteen
men in the second call have been mus
tered. The second battery has been
ready for examination and muster for
a lon> time awaiting the mustering of
ficer. Oregon will furnish another reg
iment in forty-eight hours if called
upon."
PALATIAL BERTHS
FOR ARMY MULES
More Care in Their Shipment to
Maniia Than Manifested
for Soldiers.
Fry two month? past, the quartermas
ter's department of the army has been
largely occupied fitting out transports for
the conveyance of soldiers to the Philip
pines. Just now the department is con
centrating its energies on the fitting out
of the ship Tacoma. which is to trans
port mules to the same destination.
Needless to say, the Tacoma is receiv
ing much more attention than any of the
others.
Those in charge of the preparations ac
count for this great solicitude for the wel
fare of the mules on the ground that it
Is an experiment and the Governemnt Is
determined to make it a success. So â was
the transportation of thousands of soi
dlers 6000 miles across the Pacific an ex
periment, yet on some of the ships of the
first fleet that sailed from this port
notably the City of Pekingâ the men were
crowded on board like sheep in a stock
car. Bunks were built in tiers of threo
to six, without the slightest regard to
sanitary conditions, light or ventilation,
and were as many Chinamen in SaiÂ»
Francisco found huddled together in aÂ»
contracted quarters they would all bo
punished for violating the cubic air or
dinance.
But the soldiers were merely common
American citizens gathered from thÂ«
fields, the forests, the workshops and the
offices, to defend the flag of their com
mon country. These mules are of aristo
cratic lineage, boasting of the bluest mule
blood of Maryland. Thousands of soldiers
can be obtained for $13 a month and somÂ«
shoddy uniforms. The mules cost tho
Government $231 each, landed in San
Francisco. California mules could have
been obtained in plenty for a quarter or
that sum, but lacking the superior pedi
gree of the Baltimore breed they would
not answer the purpose of hauling com
missary trains through the Philippine
Jungles.
In view of all this, It is not surprising
that the Government (through the quar
termaster's department) should lavish a
substantial portion of the war tax in fit
ting up the Tacoma for the comfort of
these long-eared aristocrats. There will
be 150 of them, with 100 horses of thÂ«
Fourth Cavalry that will take passage on
the Tacoma, and if they do not reacn
their destination in safety after as en
joyable a sea voyage as it is possible
for an equine to take, it will be due solely
to their natural perverseness and not to
the solicitude of an indulgent quartex
master's department.
Every mule and horse will have a sepa
rate con }P a rtment in the shape of a stall
padded fore and aft, amidships and aloft
and alow. Every inch of timber used in
the construction of those stalls Is care
fully dressed and covered with a thick,
poft padding, even the ceilings being pad
ded in case the ship gets to tumbling
about too roughly. The mangers are care
fully hollowed out and padded to prevent
the occupants of the stalls from coming
Into too forcible contact with any pro
jection, and each stall will be provided
with an electric light for the convenience
of mules that may be troubled with ln
somnia. Jor this purpose a fine electric
plant has been put into the ship (by the
(.overnmont), and the dynamo will also
be used to operate immense electric ven
tilating fans at both ends of the ship and
?v th .f upper and 'tween decks on which
the high-bred passengers will be located,
i ins will give them a constant current
of pure, fresh air, as there are no bulk
heads on either deck, and is an arrange
ment that would have brought blessings
upon the department from thousands of
sufTerinp: soldiers, had thoir transports
been similarly, equipped.
A passageway extending the full length
A he , Khi P on both sides, also well
padded, has been provided on both decks
ror the promenade of the mules and
horses, and there each day, attended by
Rr .Â°, oms in the livery of Uncle Sam, they
win be given such exercise as their con
stitutions demand.
In addition to all this, careful attention
has been paid to their sleeping arrange-
m f n , ts - a ma *ter that in the c.-fse of the
soldiers was dismissed with little consid
eration. Animals will rarely lie down on
board ship, and if they do they are apt
to be badly battered up by the motion
of the vessel. To obviate this difficulty
the stalls have been built so narrow that
it will be impossible for the animals to
get down, but to prevent them from be
coming fatigued, hammocks will be slung
in each stall for their convenience. These
hammocks are canvas affairs, passing
snugly under the body, the ends being se
curely fastened to the sides of the stalls.
The mules and horses will gradually
learn to rest themselves on these ham
mocks, thus relieving their legs of their
weight.
The Taeoma is supplied with - large
engine and thÂ© Government has put in a
condenser capable of supplying 2000 gal
lons of water a day. So far as known the
stalls are not provided with hot and cold
cold baths.
Forward of the stalls are the quarters
for the twenty-four soldiers and sixteen
civilians, who will have charge of the an
imals. It is gratifying to note that here,
too, every provision has been made for
the comfort of the occupants, while the
cabin of the Taeoma is being newly up
holstered and refurnished throughout and
will be the most elegantly fitted up of
any sailing ship that ever passed
through the Golden Gate.
The Government chartered the Taeo
ma for something like $200 a day, begin-

MERRIAM AND MILLER.
All Orders Are Now Captioned
as Coming From the Major
General.
Matters of Jurisdiction over Philippine
expedition and Camp Merrltt affairs that
were talked over at some length a few
days ago by Major General Merriam and
Brigadier General Miller, have been set
tled to the satisfaction of General Mer
rinm; General Miller's job seems to have
gone Into the hands of a receiver. All
orders now issuing from General Miller's
headquarters, whether they be connected
with the movement of troops or the de
tailing of an assistant adjutant general
are captioned "under Instruction from "
or "by direction of." the commander of
the Department of California.
General Miller has the honor of their
issue. General Merriam the honor of their
promulgation. I'nder the new metho-1 of
procedure the administration of exoe-li
tionary affairs has settled down to a
smooth running basis.
Apropos of General Miller and affairs
the general stated in an interview last
evening that he expected to get away
with the next expedition by August 2.
IN THE KANSAS CAMP.
Medical Board Ordered to Pass
Upon the Physical Qualifica-
tions of Colonel Lit'le.
T'pon representations from the proper
medical authority Brigadier General Mil
ler has ordered a medical board convened
to examine Into the physical condition
of Lieutenant Colonel E. C. Little, once
acting commander of the Twentieth Kan
sas Volunteers, to discover If he be not
physically disqualified for the duties of
his post. For five weeks past Lieutenant
Colonel Little has been compejled to sign
the payroll while lying in his bed at the
Waldeck Sanitorium.
It has come to he a well-circulated al
legation at Camp Merritt that the charge
of "physical disqualification" only serves
to cloak a regimental skeleton. The for
mal charge that has progressed through
the proper channels is as has been stat
ed, but accompanying it have gone let
ters, one of them, it is said, emanating
from Brigadier General King, declaring
Little to be a non-competent of the rank
est order. These letters are in no wise
to be used as evidence of physical inca
pacity. They are simply for the informa
tion and guidance of the proper authori
ties.
Lieutenant Colonel Little is evidently
resolved to combat the charge against
him. He has removed himself from the
Waldeck and has engaged apartments at
Lincoln Inn, overlooking the camp of the
Kansans. There, with the st,rong arm
and glad hand of his favorite lieutenant,
W. A. Deford, he is slapping the backs
of the men of the ranks, and a few days
will show to what effect. The few days
to come and their result are being spec
ulated upon with some anxiety by the
active officers of the regiment.
EIGHTH CALIFORNIA.
Presented With a Fine Stand of
Colors by the Citizens of
Oakland.
CAMP BARRETT, SATHER STA
TION, July 20.â The event of the day
here was the presentation of a stand of
colors by the citizens of Oakland to Colo
nel Henshaw's regiment at 4:30 this even
ing. There were several thousand spec
tators present to witness the scene. The
regiment was drawn up on three sides of
a square, facing the visitors. Adjutant
General A. "W Barrett, with Colonel F. S.
Chadburne, Colonel J. F. Burgin. Lieu
tenant Colonel A. Andrews, Lieutenant
Colonel J. S. Young, Lieutenant Colonel
W. D. Sanborn, Lieutenant Colonel
George H. Pippy, Lieutenant Colonel J.
D. Howell, of Governor James Budd's
staff, were the honored guests of the oc
casion. These, with the color guard and
committee presenting the colors, ad
vanced to the colonel, where the present
ation was made.
The heavy wind, the great distance of
the men of the command, and the small
ness of the audience all com
bined to make the speech-making a mat
ter of duty rather than one of pleasure.
As a consequence the remarks were much
shorter than would otherwise have been.
The speech of presentation was made
by R. M. Fitzgerald. Colonel Park Hen
shaw, on behalf "of the regiment, re
sponded.
The regimental colors had a beautiful
embroidered seal of the State in the cen
ter, while above was the single word,
"California." * Underneath the wording
was, "Eighth Regiment Infantry, Califor
nia, United States Volunteers." The beau
tiful national flag bore the Inscription,
"Eighth Regiment Infantry, California
United States Volunteers." Color Ser
geant Brown of Company E, Santa Rosa,
received the flag from Colonel Henshaw,
and Phil Atkinson, Company D, San
Rafael, received the regimental colors. At
the closeof the speeches they marched
back with their guard to their position
with Company I, Grass Valley. A. S.
Mucdonald carried the flag and P. E.
Bowles the colors out to where the exer
cises took place, nnd held them during the
presentation speech.
The whole regiment saluted the colors
by presenting arms, the bugle corps
sounded their salute and the band ren
dered "The Star-spangled Banner."
At the close of the presentation the reg
iment went through its lirst parade with
the field officers mounted. The evolutions
were well carried out and showed that
mf>n and officers are getting into fine
shape.
The movement of the camp across the
California railway, begun yesterday, has
not been completed, owing to the delay
in laying the water pipes. This was fin
ished to-night, and it Is expected that the
kitchens will be transferred to-morrow.
The officers' tents were moved Irom High
street this morning to the space next the
railroad track, so as to avoid the dust of
the camp.
The regimental band will give a concert
Sunday afternoon at 3 o'clock in front of
Colonel Henshaw's quarters. The band
is composed of fine musicians, and de
spite the short time they have been play
ing together make excellent music.
Leader Gomez has proved himself the
right man In the right place.
Regimental quartermaster. Lieutenant
Heller, is extremely busy, owing to the
arrival of several carloads of supplies.
There is estimated to be over $50,090 worth
of clothing, cooking utensils, shelter tents,
and field tools for the engineer corps. It
is expected that each day will now see
the arrival of supnlies of various kinds
until all of the requisitions are filled.

from General Miller's headquarters.
No orders for breaking camp have been
Issued by the proper authority although
on Tuesday nl ht Brigadier General Otis

THE PRESIDIO CAMP.
Transfer To-Day of the Division
Hospital From Camp Mer-
ritt to the Reservation.
Pursuant to orders from General Mer
riam the transfer of the division hospital
from Camp Merritt to the Presidio will
be made to-day. The undertaking is one
presenting many difficulties, but Surgeon
Major Owen has taken every precaution
to be able to cope with them. He went
over to the Presidio yesterday morning I
and conferred with Lieutenant Colonel
Morris and Dr. Tompkins, with the re
sult that Colonel Morris assigned for hos
pital purposes the extreme northwestern
barracks. This building is a double brick
structure, and it will accommodate over
200 patients. A detail of forty men, un
der Lieutenant Surgeon Page, gave the
building a thorough sanitary overhauling
and cleansing, in order that it might be
In the proper condition for the reception
of tfie sick soldiers. There are 190 pa
tients now in the division hospital at
Camp Merritt, and to move these to the
Presidio will require a number of ambu
lances. These Major Owen has secured,
and to-day he will begin to transfer the
patients. It may take two days to move
all of the sick soldiers to the Presidio.
The accommodations for them at the post
will be vastly better than at Camp Mer
ritt. Major Owen does not anticipate any
bad results to any of the sick" soldier's by
reason of the moving.
The troops at Camp Merritt will be
moved to the Presidio in the next few
days. It has been definitely determined
that the regiments, as far. as possible,
will go into camp on the hills of the
reservation. One regiment will probably
be camped next to the First New York,
between their camp and that of the Alger
Light Battery.
Private Benson, Company E, First New
York, is in the post hospital, with what
threatens to be pneumonia. Private
Keese, Company B, First Washington, is
in the hospital with typhoid fever. Pri
vate Lewis, Company H, Sixth California,
is ill with a complication of measles and
pneumonia.
RELEASED FROM CUSTODY.
Two Boisterous Volunteers Re

Monday and was knocked down and had
his jaw broken, was released from cus
tody yesterday by Acting Police Judge
Barry. The regiment has gone to Ma
nila, and no one was left behind to pros
ecute him. lie expects that he will be
attached to one of the regiments now at
Camp Merritt.
Private William Wilson of Company B,
Thirteenth Minnesota, was also set at
liberty by Judge Mogan yesterday. He
was arrested for breaking into a saloon
at Point Lobos and First avenues early
last Sunday morning and stealing sev
eral bottles of whisky and cigars. Major
Diggles and other officers gave Wilson a
splendid character, and he testified him
solf that he wÂ»ns so urunk that he did not
know what he had done. Fred .Flueger,
the saloon keeper, said he did not want
to press the charge, and the Judge dis
missed the case.
Wilson's father is a well known miller
in Minnesota, and he was never known to
be in trouble before. His sister was in
court, and after the case was dismissed
he threw his arms around her neck and
kissed her.
Private J. W. Monroe, who is stationed
at Fort Baker, swore to a complaint in
J udgo Mogan's court yesterday for the |
arrest of "John Doe" on a charge of em- |
bezzlement. The boys at Fort Baker were i
in the habit of intrusting their spare cash j
to the cook, and he had $24 belonging to j
Monroe. July 11 Monroe asked him for |
the money, but he made some excuse and
disappeared from the fort. Monroe does
not know his name, but he has now as
certained where he can be found.
FIRST NEW YORK.
No Time to Be Lost in Getting
the Regiment Away to
Honolulu.
It now appears from the latest develop
ments that the sojourn of the First New-
York In San Francisco will be a short
one. General Merrlam intends to get the
regiment to Honolulu as fast as possi
ble, and with this end in view the New
York boys will be sent over the sea in
different detachments just as soon as the
transports can be secured. It is rumored
that several small vessels have been
chartered for this purpose, and as rapid
ly as they can be put in shape the regi
ment will be sent to Honolulu for garri
son duty. Colonel Barber will accom
pany the first expedition, nnd if there are
more than two. Lieutenant Colonel Stac
pole will remain until the last one is
dispatched. It is possible that the tlrst
detachment of the regiment may go in
side of ton days, and that the entire com
mand will have departed by the middle
of next month. Mnjor Davis has sut>
mitted a plan for the post hospital to ba
erected at HonoJulu, and it has been ap
proved by General Merriam. It will be
a one-story building with several wings.
Colonel Barber is still con-fined to his
room at the University Club, but he hopes
to be able to assume command of the
regiment in a few days.
LONGEST TOW KNOWN,
Tug Fearless, Now the Iroquois,
Will Haul the Tacoma From
San Francisco to Manila.
The Iroquois, formerly the tug Fear
less and now owned by the Government,
is about to make the longest tow ever
undertaken. She is to haul the ship Ta
coma from San Francisco to Manila by
the way of Honolulu, a distance of about
6GOO miles. The Tacoma is to carry 100
horses and 120 mules and a coal supply
for the Iroquois. Lieutenant George M.
Cameron of the Fourth Cavalry Regi
ment is in command of the Tacoma, and
is superintending the fitting up of the
vessel for the reception of the animals.
He has a veterinary surgeon and a de
tail of twenty men to care for the live
stock.
The Iroquois will steam to Honolulu, a
distance of 2100 miles, on her own coal.
At Honolulu she will rocoal from the
bunkers at that port and then proceed
to the Ladrones and there, getting Into
smooth water, will take on sufficient coal
from the Tacoma to carry her through
to Manila.
The Iroquois Is a swift boat as well as
one of the largest and most powerful
tugs ever built. She will undoubtedly
make good time, as the Tacoma is an
easygoing ship. The Iroquois is well
equipped In every respect for the long

JOHN J. SULLIVAN'S CASE.
His Suit Against Auditor Iroderick
for His Salary Submitted.
The action of John J. Sullivan against
Auditor William Broderick for six
months' salary due him as assistant ex
pert of the Board of Supervisors was
submitted yesterday. In August of 1895
Sullivan was appointed "bond clerk" by
the Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors, but Judge Sanderson held
that the Supervisors had no authority to
create an office. Sullivan then continued
his duties under the name of "assistant
expert." but when he presented his sal
ary warrants the Auditor refused to
audit thorn. Sullivan then brought suit
for six months' salary at $100 a month.
Sullivan was on the stand yesterday and
testified as to the regularity of his ap
pointment. Clerk Russell followed him
and gave it as his opinion that Sullivan's
services were needed, and that the Board
was empowered to employ such help as
v.as necessary to properly carry out the
duties of the office. The case was then
submitted and a decision will be handed
down in a few days.

LET ThjE TRUTH BE KNOWN.
NECESSITY for investigation of the manage
of Agnews Asylum becomes more apparent
Not only have scandalous acts been broadly
charged, but there seems to be a tendency on the
part of the board to override the law. That the mem
bers do not desire investigation is an excellent rea
son why there should be one without delay, sparing
none who may be guilty, and clearing all who may
have been unjustly accused. The latter will be glad
to have the truth known. The wishes of the former
are not to be considered.
Frank H. Gould, by his official conduct, has won
the title "Czar of Agnews." The law does not ap
pear to have made provision for such a personage,
and the law carries weight. Mr. Gould does not seem
to have realized this until recently, but he does now,
and the thought gives him pain. He has no right to
retain as employes people of improper character, nor
to expel those who do not conform to his personal
opinions. There is more to be looked into than the
sensational allegations according to which the asy
lum reeks with immorality; the superintendent is
unfit, and some of the attaches wantonly gross in
their conduct, yet protected by superiors.
The State Board of Lunacy formulates rules under
which asylums are supposed to be governed. Ap
parently the plan at Agnews has been to set aside
these rules whenever they interfered with the ambi
tion of a favorite to secure a position. An investiga
tion will afford opportunity for explanations. By
all means let the trustees have the "sweeping inquiry"
they profess to desire, and if it sweep the institution
clean so much the better.
ODVICE FOR POPULISTS.
THE Populists who at Sacramento the other day
nominated Judge Maguire for Governor are not
likely to derive much comfort from the pro
ceedings on Tuesday evening of the local Demo
cratic Committee of One Hundred. This committee
was appointed by "Whispering" McNab, Frank
Hood Gould and "Hallucination" Alford of the State
committee to take charge of the Democracy of this
city, and its members mostly hail from Republican
districts. Yet it is a fairly representative Democratic
body. The test of a committee's democracy in this
region is the number of its members who want office.
An overwhelming majority of the Committee of One
Hundred want an office.
At its meeting on Tuesday evening the committee
adopted a resolution indorsing Maguire for Gov
ernor. This action was opposed by a Democrat
named McKinne, who thought it would injure the
Jtidge'3 prospects, complicating him, we infer, with
his friends the Populists. In short, McKinne made
it plain that his theory of Maguire's campaign is the
true Democratic theory, namely, addition, division
and silence. In McKinne's judgment it will be fatal
to let the Populists know that the Democracy is
unanimous for Maguire, as in such a contingency
they may suspect that in the event of his election he
will put, as the gentleman tersely expressed it, "none
but Democrats on guard."
However, the Committee of One Hundred differed
from McKinne entirely. The resolution was adopted
with only one dissenting vote (McKinne's), and thus,
so far as the Democracy of San Francisco is repre
sented by the committee, it is pledged to the little
Populist "giant" for Governor.
It is quite probable that any advice we may tender
the Populists at this juncture will be spurned. The
leaders of the bewhiskered party do not take kindly
to advice under any circumstances, and good advice
they always disregard. But if they will listen a mo
ment they will hear of something to their advantage.
Common prudence should teach them that the great
necessity of the present moment is an understanding
with Maguire as to what he will do about patronage
if elected Governor. It ought to be apparent to the
Populists that the Democratic rank and file, through
out the State are declaring themselves in on Maguire
without reference to their rights. If Maguire is suc
cessful theÂ«e Democrats will certainly capture him.
This is evidently the Democratic plan of campaign.
What the offite-seeking members of the hirsute party
should now do is to demand a pledge from Maguire
or take him off their ticket. Otherwise, in the event
of his election, they will not get an office.
With the childlike faith which has characterized
them from the first, the Spanish are said to believe
that the United States has purchased Cuba, and that
their exit from the island is not in token of defeat.
Rut this faith will be wrecked some time, and the re
sulting row will be heard to a great distance.
So many cases of wife-beating are being heard of
lately as to cause a vague yearning for the introduc
tion of the reformatory whipping post.
Cubans seem to be out for blood, but would pre
fer that Americans and Cubans do the shedding of it.
AFFAIRS IN THE PHILIPPINES.
ACCORDING to dispatches from Washington
the officials of the administration are much
more worried over possible trouble with the
native insurgents in the Philippines than with the
Germans. This throws a strong side light upon the
situation at Manila and helps to a better understand
ing of the meaning of the recent action of the Ger
man warships there.
When a short time ago the news was received that
the German gunboat Irene had interfered to prevent
an attack of the insurgents on an island in Subic Bay,
and had immediately retired upon the appearance of
an American war vessel, the story was at once seized
upon by many people as a proof that Germany was
hostile to the United States, but did not dare to face
our fleet. The sensational jingo press that seems de
sirous of fighting the Germans as well as the Span
iards made the country ring with indignant com
ments, and the whole incident was misrepresented
and distorted from beginning to end.
The commander of the Irene made an explanation
to Admiral Dewey at the time, stating that his inter
ference against the insurgents had been 6olely in the
interests of humanity. He had acted simply to pre
vent an island on which hundreds of Europeans, men
and women, had taken refuge from being cap
tured, looted and plundered by men who are little bet
ter than savages. As soon as an American war ves
sel arrived to accept the surrender of the island and
protect the property and lives of the refugees the Ger
mans gladly stood aside.
In this action, as explained by the Germans, there
was nothing for us to complain of. The fact that
our own officials are now fearing an outbreak of the
insurgent natives is itself a proof that the commander
of the Irene acted with discretion as well as with
humanity in staying the attack at Subic Bay until
our own ships came up. We do not need the aid of
savages to defeat the Spaniards, and we certainly do
not wish them to take advantage of the success of our
arms at Manila to carry the torch and the sword
among the homes of European residents.
With the arrival of reinforcements for Dewey
there will be no longer any cause for anxiety among
Europeans in the Philippines, nor will the German
or any other foreign warships at Manila have excuse
for interfering in any way whatever. Our own force
there will then be sufficient to compel the surrender
of all Spanish garrisons and to maintain peace and
order in all places where European residents live.
That will put an end to all possibility of complica
tions with Germany, and, accordingly, at Washing
ton, no further fear is felt on that score.
The insurgents of the interior, however, remain to
be dealt with. Our experience in Cuba has not given
us any exalted idea of the general character of the
insurgents there who claim us as allies, and the Cu
bans are far superior to the mongrel races of the
Philippines. Reports from all sources show that a
good deal of friction has arisen already between Gen
eral Shafter and the Cuban leaders clamoring for con
trol of Santiago. Something of the same nature, but
to a greater extent and of a worse degree is very
sure to occur at Manila when we capture the city
and ba'k the insurgents of their expected booty. In
that direction lies our possible trouble, and not with
anything the Germans have done or are likely to do.
JUGGLING WITH PROMOTIONS.
WE have repeatedly of late directed attention to
the defects of the present system of promotion
in the navy, and have pointed out the injus
tice of moving a man up to a higher place on the
rank list when that implies not so much a promotion
for him as a reduction of some other officer. The
Baltimore Sun now notes a specific case which shows
the injustice in a striking light It says: "Under
existing law there seems to be no way by which a
naval officer can be rewarded for exceptionally bril
liant service except at the expense of some other
officer equally deserving. A monstrous instance of
this recently occurred. Captain CJark of the battle
ship Oregon brought his ship, which was designed
for no such service, about 14,000 miles, and at the end
of that long journey she was ready to go into action.
After performing this great feat Captain Clark found
himself lower in rank than when he started on his voy
age. This had occurred by reason of the promotions
of the captains at Manila."
Upon a case of that kind no comment is necessary.
The fact itself carries the moral irresistibility with it.
It should be noted, however, that since the Balti
more Sun reviewed the case Captain Clark and the
Oregon have accomplished other feats of renown in
naval warfare. All reports of the sea fight off San
tiago agree that to him and his battle-ship the chief
glory of the conflict is due. Stationed at the eastern
side of the harbor, the Oregon was out of the way
when Cervera made his rush for escape to the west
ward. Nevertheless by her extraordinary sailing
power she passed the lowa and engaged three Span
ish ships, the Teresa, the Oquendo and the Vizcaya,
in turn, and mainly by her guns they were driven,
battered and burning, to the shore. Captain Clark,
however, is still lower in rank in the navy than he
was when he started from San Francisco.
The New York Times argues that Captain Clark's
rank will be made up to him when the promotions
are passed around for the Santiago fight. That much
may be readily admitted, but where will he stand
then? If by the promotion he gets he is simply given
his former relative rank he will not have been advanced
at all. Moreover, the Manila heroes, after having been
put above him, will then be once more placed be
low him, and they also will have no promotion.
It will be seen that the present system is simply a
process of shuffling. One shuffle after the victory
at Manila puts Captain Clark down, and another
shuffle soon to take place will put the Manila men
down. The thing is more like a comic opera than
the acts of a great nation. There is but one ra
tional method of dealing with the problem. The
system of promotions in the navy should be entirely
reorganized. The ranks of admiral and vice-admiral
should be restored so that there may be absolute pro
motion for the higher officers, and the navy persohnel
bill should be enacted so that members of the staff
and enlisted men may also have a chance to rise.
These things should be required of Congress this
winter. They have been postponed too long already.
Of course the war is somewhat depressing to Sec
retary Alger, but his gloom has doubtless been ac
centuated by the necessity for signing his name to a
paper awarding the contract for beginning work at
San Pedro.
Camara's best ship is reported to have been dam
aged, but it hasn't a thing the matter with it compared
with what it will acquire a few seconds after meeting

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 21, 1898.
f\A ATTERS for congratulation among the peo
/ \ pie of San Francisco and the San Joaquin,
and indeed throughout California, are to be
found in the report of the affairs of the Valley Road,
made at the annual meeting on Tuesday. It is a re
port of steady progress in the past and a programme
of future progress, and therefore carries with it that
kind of encouragement which rests upon the sure
basis of work performed.
It is now two years' since the Valley Road began
operating, and the financial report shows for the year
just closed a large increase of profits over those of
the preceding one. Notwithstanding the heavy ex
penditures entailed by the extensive construction
work carried on during the year, there is
still, according to the report, a sufficient amount
of money on hand to push forward the build
ing of the road from Stockton to Point Rich
mond and to carry on various other contemplated im
provements.
The construction of the road southward has been
continuous from the start. In September last year
the line was opened for operation to Visalia, and in
January following it had reached Bakersfield. Work
is now in progress on the line frorr Hanford to
Bakersfield, and nearly all the buildings required for
the business of the road along that part of the route
are completed.
The most important work before the directors of
the road at present is the completion of the line from
Stockton to Point Richmond and the opening of di-
rect communication with San Francisco. Of this
work it is reported that the heavier portions have
been completed. Satisfactory progress has been
made at both ends of the Franklin tunnel and con
tracts let for road work six miles at each end, so
that the line will be practically ready for operation
as soon as the tunnel is completed.
So near is the opening of the line that the con
struction of two steel ferry-boats is under considera
tion and the work on them is expected to begin in the
near future. When these are completed San Fran
cisco will have that direct competitive communication
with the rich and growing country of the San Joa
quin for which her merchants and her manufacturers
have so long waited while bearing as best they could
the grinding exactions of the Southern Pacific mo
nopoly.
While the reports for the year show the brightening
prospects of the road itself, it should not be over
looked that the greater benefits resulting from the
construction are not to be found in the report.
These benefits are not in the profits derived by the
stockholders, but in those that have accrued to the
people of the San Joaquin and of San Francisco.
They are manifest in the reduction of freight rates,
not only by the Valley Road, but by its rival, the
old-time monopoly. By these reductions a vast sav
ing has been made to all producers and shippers in
the valley. Every city, town and village along the
line has felt the pood effects of the saving thus made,
and the whole country and all its people are more
prosperous than they were.
DR. COGSWELL'S FOUNTAINS.
IN a communication published Monday Mr. J. H.
Culver asks us a pointed question. He desires to
ascertain our reasons for thinking that it was
proper to remove the Cogswell fountain at the junc
tion of California and Market streets, we having re
marked to that effect a few weeks ago.
We do not know exactly how to answer Mr. Cul
ver's interrogatory. He must be aware of the fact
that the fountain had ceased to be useful, having in
curred the resentment of the people of its immediate
neighborhood, and it is quite probable that the weal
of the city demanded its removal. It was manifestly
vain to maintain a fountain at which nobody would
drink and the sight of which angered small boys
armed with cobbles. Our opinion was that the Cogs
well fountain at the foot of California street, having
fallen into innocuous desuetude, like all worn out
things, was properly removed.
But on the main proposition we agree heartily with
Mr. Culver. The treatment accorded to Dr. Cogs
well's gifts in this city has been outrageous. Making
due allowance for all the doctor's eccentricities, the
spirit of his philanthropy was high and noble. He
gave the city an endowed technical school and at
tempted to beautify its streets with fountains. The
people accepted the school and stoned and demol
ished his fountains. In a less barbarous community
than this the act of the crowd who lassoed the foun
tain at the foot of California street and pulled it
down would have encountered severe punishment.
Here it is regarded as a rare piece of humor.
When Dr. Cogswell, angry at the ingratitude of our
people, attempted to recover possession of the Poly
technic School property we heartily sympathized
with him. He was justified in thinking that a com
munity which would treat philanthropy as his phil
anthropy had been treated would, immediately upon
death, sell his school property and go on a pic
nic with the money. Certainly Dr. Cogswell had no
reason to believe that anybody was grateful for his
gift. Several thousand dollars' worth of fountain ma
terial presented to the city by him has been allowed
to go to ruin at the City Hall; yet somebody pro
poses to put a figure of Admiral Dewey at the foot
of California street. How do we know that our hu
morous youngsters will not lassoo the old seadog and
pull him down? We are expecting daily to hear that
somebody who does not like Mayor Phelan has as
saulted his fountain at the juncture of Market and
Mason streets.
On one great historic occasion this spirit of in
gratitude and envy inflicted almost irreparable dam
age upon the State. About 1883 the late Senator
Stanford contemplated giving his millions to the
University of California. With a view to encouraging
his design Governor Perkins appointed him a regent.
But the legislative session of 1883 was stuffed with
pin-headed statesmen who regarded the railroad with
hungry eyes and its president's money with desperate
yearning. Stanford's name came before the Senate
for confirmation. The pin-heads arose on their hind
legs and flapped their ears. To prevent rejection
Governor Perkins withdrew the name. Soon after the
magnate established the Stanford University.
Those who think the mean spirit of envy which has
characterized the treatment accorded to Dr. Cogs
well's fountains in this city inflicts no damage upon
the country should reflect for a moment on the
glories of the State University with Stanford's mil
lions behind it. It is our opinion that future his
torians will hold the pin-headed Senators of ia^3 re
sponsible for the diversion of this money. If some one
does not sinele them out and erect them as Macauley
erected Barere, upon a pinnacle of infamy so high
that nobody will ever be able to lassoo and pull them
down, we are laboring under a mistake.
However, we are still of opinion that Dr. Cops
well's fountain was prooerly removed. Mr. Culver
makes an argument which may well shame us, but
we think the fountain should have been removed, if
for no other reason than to obliterate a conspicuous
evidence of municipal meanness

moments In the days of yore. He now
holds one eye open when in his naps and
this method of obtaining the "balm to
hurt minds" is changing the angelic dis
position of the colonel to one packed with
moroseness and peevish impatience. One
of Howard Taylor's supposedly humorous
but certainly risque stories was the mov
ing cause. The colonel has been spending
a few days at Mill Valley to get away
from the winds, fogs and dust of this
glorious climate, the discovery of which
is credited to Francis Drake of historic
fame. The colonel found none of these
undesirable elements of weather in Mill
Valley, but something else found him.
Just as Howard Taylor reached the point
of his story Colonel Kowalsky dozed, and
with that dozing came his undoing. Jer
sey claims the palm for mosquitoes, but
it !s parading under false presumptions
as the colonel will attest. The Mill Val
ley product is a sword-flourishing affair,
and it raises lumps faster than anything
on this earth. Taylor's story would have
enshrouded the colonel in oblivious slum
bers earlier in the game had it not been
for the swarm of mosquitoes that had
been hovering over his head and which
he kept at a distance by much acrobatic
effort.
The colonel's propensity for Bleep
caught him In the act of crunching a
mosquito on his neck. The snoring that
followed told the insects of the feast
prospective. For some ten minutes Mr.
Morpheus sat upon the pent-up lids of
Mr. Kowalsky and the mosquitoes took
aggressive possession of all exposed parts
of his body. When the victim awoke he
had lost his identity. His face was lumpy
and his nose was twice its normal size.
Of course, several sweet things were said
by Colonel Kowalsky, but what did the
mosquitoes care? Quick, hurried orders
were given at once for the packing of the
colonel's baggage. It was noticed
when returning to the city that the colo
nel held one eye open, and he was asked
what was the reason thereof. He re
plied: "Never again will I sleep wlthTboth
my eyes. I have been reckless to my un
doing all my life, and now I shall be cau
tious. I need a lotion."

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Lord Beresford recently called the at
tention of Parliament to the insufficient
pensions paid to men in the navy by
which a continuous service man only re- I
ceived 29 cents a day pension after thirty
two years' service, and he advocated a
small increase as asked for by the pen
sioners. In the course of his remarks
upon this subject he referred to the fact
that the "Chatham Chest," established in
1590. had been despoiled in 1814 and $25 -
000,000 to $35,000,000 had mysteriously dis
appeared and had not been made good.
The "Chatham Chest"' fund was coml
posed partly of 5 per cent of the prize
money paid voluntarily by officers and
men and partly of the accumulations of
12 cents per month of wages for 200 years,
the fund being intended to give pensions I
for wounds and other injuries received in !
the service. The sum total for this pur- |
pose was now only $6,750.000, the interest
on which gave but an insignificant sum
toward the object intended.
The battleship Koenig Wilhelm, of 11,000
tons, building at the Germania Works, ;
Kiel, for the German navy, is to be com- i
pleted and ready for trial in thirty-four j
months. The estimated cost is $3,360,560,
exclusive of armament and torpedo out
fit. The ship will have triple screws, en
gines of 13,000 horsepower and a speed of
IS knots.
Austria Is recognizing the value of
economy in coal and has built a cruiser,
called the Zenta, of 2326 tons, to have a j
maximum speed of 20 knots. She has two
maatl with auxiliary sail power spread
ing 6300 square feet of canvas or only
about one-half the sail area required for
full sail power. It is sufficient, however,
for use when the state of weather war
ranta substitution of sail for steam and
thus saves much coal.
Germany is getting the lion's share of
shipbuilding for the new navy of China.
No orders are on hand at Elswick since
the Hal-Chi and Hai-Tien, cruisers of ,
4300 tons and 24 knots speed, were de- j
llvered. The ' Hal-Shen. Hai-Shew and
Hal-Yung, cruisers of 2950 tons and 19.5 i
knots, have been completed at Vulcan
Works, Stettin, and it is rumored that
more orders to that firm will follow as
soon as the Chinese finances are In a con
dition to warrant additional increase of
the navy. Pour torpedo-boat destroyers
named Hal-Lung, Hai-Nju, Hai-Chlng
and Hai-Hoha have likewise been com
pleted at Schichau, Elbing. and are said
to be vastly superior to the best built for
the British navy. They are 193.6 feet in
length, 300 tons displacement and with
twin screw engines of 6500 horsepower
and will develop a speed of 32 knots.
There is not a boat built yet for any
other navy that has come up to that
speed, although it is estimated to be
reached in the Albatross and Gypsy of
360 tons and 300 tons each, with horse
powers of 7500 and 7700. These boats are
building at Chiswick and Gowan for the
British navy.
The recent book of Vice Admiral S. J.
Makaroff of the Russian navy has been
translated by Lieutenant John B. Berna
dou of the United States navy and ap
pears in the General Information series,
No. XVII, issued by the Office of Naval
Intelligence. Vice Admiral Makaroff
treats the subject of "naval tactics" in
all its bearings and his thoroughness and
manner of explaining all that pertains to
naval warfare is so lucid and interesting
as to commend itself even to readers who
may not be familiar with the technic of
warships, ordnance, electricity and tor
pedoes.
Foreign naval powers are directing
their chief attention to quick-firing guns
and their adequate protection. In the
German navy all guns up to and includ
ing 9.45 inch caliber are henceforth to
be quick-firers. In the French navy the
old style 14.5-inch breech-loaders are be
ing displaced by 9.45-inch and 6.47-inch
quick-firers. In the British navy no larger
caliber than 6-inch te yet in use, but the
number of guns carried is on the in
crease. Japan Btill holds on to 12-inch
breech-loaders for the battleships, but is
mounting 8-inch quick-firers on the
armored cruisers under construction, and
the remainder of the batteries are com
posed entirely of quick-firers. The largest
quick-firers in the Russian navy are of 6
inch caliber and the ordinary breech
loaders are slowly being supplanted. The
South American republics' navy vessels,
chiefly built at Elswick, have batteries
entirely composed of quick-firers, rang
ing from 8 inches down to one pounders,
and within a year the ships of the United
States navy will have discarded ordinary
breech-loaders of less than S-inch caliber.
THE DAYS THAT WEBK
The lovely twilight lingers like a spirit
round the place;
The sweetheart roses at the gate are me
mories of her face;
The lilies lean and listen â the ghosts of
lost deligntâ
The sunflower like golden star signals the
silent night.
This is the place I met herâ there, In the
rosy years.
When life was all of hope and all Its ways
too sweet for tears;
This is the place I met herâ this is the
dear, sweet place,
And all the world is wondrous with mem
ories of her face.
Oh, it may be that not for me another
light shall shine
Like the last lightâ like the past light
that made sweet this life of mine;
It may be I shall never see, for all life's
grief and grace,
The beam, the gleam, the stream â the
dream, and over all, that face!
Strange ways, strange days and lands and
hands, and what we think is fate;
But over all some crimson bands that
bind a twilight late
With rare star-sprinkled roses, with all
their youth time grace,
And those sweet lips that kissed me, and
ever more that face!
Let us forget! and yetâ and yetâ we will
remember still
The blood that made the rose so redâ the
ripplo of the rill â
The hills that climbed to heaven, and each
remembered place
That made the whole world sweeter for
one dear woman's face!
Dear face! I may not meet theeâ l may
not ever sight
The phantom ship that bears thee from
the watchflres of my night;
But still the beam, the gleam, the dream,
ami evermore I see
A face that makes life beautifulâ the one
sweet face for me!
F. L. STANTON in Atlanta Constitution,
ONE OF AMERICA'S IIGHTJbRS.
The papers have given many short biog
raphies of H. W. Lawton, now a major
general of Volunteers, who commands
one of the divisions of Shafter's army,
and whose men were engaged in the des
perate assault at El Caney, writes H. S.
Cantield in the Chicago Times-Herald.
They have told of his long years of ser
vice, of how he has worked himself up
through the lieutenancies to his present
rank, and of the training given' him by
more than a quarter of a century of ex
perience; but of the gigantic size, the
phenomenal strength and activity, the
abnormal endurance, the utter fearless
ness and the inalienable picturesquenesa
of the man not a word. I have the honor
to know him well, and, since I like men
whose basic manhood has not been ut
terly refined out of them, I like him.
Lawton reminds me always of Scott's
Norman baron, Front de Boeuf. He has
better morals, of course, as well as a very
pretty taste in red wines and reed birds,
but he is as big as the giant slain by
Richard of the Lion Heart, is as direct in
his methods, and, in personal or general
combat, every bit as savage. There is
plenty of the primal man In him. What
he thinks he says. Ho has a strong sense
of justice, but his temper is terrific and he
is not gentle. He requires of his subor
dinates the utmost endeavor, and gets it.
He asks no one to do work that he is not
competent and willing to do himself. Nat
urally a leader, he goes first, and the more
difficult or desperate the undertaking the
faster he goes. Upon the gray granite
slab which covers the moldering bones of
a Confederate officer who sleeps on the
magnolia-pc-taled uplands of Louisiana is
an Inscription: "He never told his men
to go on." That will do for Lawton when
he dies.
He is six feet three inches high. He
weighs 210 pounds, and nearly every ounce
of it is bone and blood ajid tendon and
muscle. He is 55 years old and as springy
as a youth. His capacity to go without
food, drink or sleep is seemingly unlim
ited. "MacUmazahn," the Zulus called
Quatermainâ "the one who has his eyes
open." Macumazahn Lawton will keep
them open for a week at a stretch, when
necessary, and then walk, talk, eat, drink
or fight a dozen men to a standstill. He
has lived a life of peril and hardship. His
only rule of hygiene is a tub in the morn-
Ing. He has taken no sort of care of him
self. Yet so splendidly was he endowed
by nature that there is no perceptible
weakening of his forces. Apparently he
is as powerful and enduring as when I
saw him first. That was more than ten
years ago. He had completed one of the
most remarkable feats of strength and
perseverence chronicled in the long annals
of the Anglo-Saxon race, but he was as
fresh as a rose in the morning.
He stood on the Government reserva
tion at San Antonio surrounded by the
tawny savage band of Chiricahua
Apaches, whom he had hunted off their
feet. Near him, tactiturn but of kindly
visage, stood young Chief Nachcs, al
most as tall as ho. In a tent close by lay
Geronimo, the medicine man, groaning
from a surplusage of fresh beef eaten raw.
The squat figures of the hereditary ene
mies of the whites grouped about him
came only to his shoulder. He towered
among them, stern, powerful, dominantâ
an incarnation of the spirit of the white
man, whose war drum has beat around
the world. Clad in a faded, dirty fatigue
jacket, a greasy flannel shirt of gray,
trousers so soiled that the stripe down the
leg was barely visible, broken boots and a
disreputable sombrero that shaded the
harsh features burned almost to blacks
ness, he was every inch a soldier and a
man. To the other officers at the post the
Indians paid no sort of attention. To
them General Stanley and his staff were
so many well-dressed lay figures, stand
ing about as part of a picture done for
their amusement, but the huge, massive
man with the stubble on his chin had
shown them that he was their superior
on hunting grounds that were theirs by
birthright, and they hung around hfa
lightest word.
For the tenth time Geronimo's band had
jumped the San Carlos reservation. The
spring grass was two inches high and the
Indian lust for blood was awake. As
usual, troops were started upon a peril
oue chase. For days they followed the
trail over a country that God Almighty
made in wrath. Farther and farther into
the vast solitudes they toiled. Volcanic
crests reared about them. Lava tore the
â¢eat her from their feet. They drank
from springs that gushed thousands of
feet above the valleys. They wandered
in canons so deep and dark that through
the narrow ribbon of white far abcne
them the stars were seen at midday
They lived upon animals no wilder tnnn
the men they were pursuing and scarcely
more wild than they. Now and then,
from a forest of pines far above them,
a shred of blue smoke drifted on he
furnace air. followed by the shrill of the
bullet's wild singing. The horses long
since had been left behind. The cavalry
men were on foot with Lawtona their
head, his teeth hard set. â¢"Well walk,
them down." he told his sergeant when
the mountains were reached. He was
walking them down. _v,rÂ»eÂ«
Six weeks afterward an Indian. *hÂ°* a
bones seemed ready to start through his
skin, came to the camp and said that
Geronimo was ready to surrender. Law
ton went alone to the lair of the starv
ng wolves and received their submission.
Cavernous eyes glared at him. Lips black
from thirst and hunger were drawn back
over discolored teeth. Skeleton fingers
pointed at him. From skeleton jaws
came sounds of pleadings mixed with
wrath The poison of bitter racial hatred
was in every glance "Even the rocks
smelled like mad Indian he told me
with a laugh long afterward. He lounged
among them, their master by virtue of
superior courage and strength and hardi
hood, and they followed him like sheep
to food and imprisonment. That is the
story in outline of the capture of Geroni
mo, physician, wizard, conjurer, orator
and murderer. t fhJk
The man of El Caney is the man of the
Mogallons. and the man of the Mpitallons
is the reincarnation of some shining, hei

shivered to the hilt. The race-type per
sists unchanged in eye in Proflle. In

centuries the Valkyrs have wafted from
the war decks, have hailed from the
holm-gangs or helmet-strewn moorlands

JUDGES DIFFER ON
THE BANKRUPTCY LAW i
HAVE THE STATE COURTS ,
JURISDICTION P
Consensus of Opinion That the Fed
eral Act Has Succ^ded and
Is Now Operative in
Its Stead.
"This act shall go into full force and
effect upon Its passage; provided, how
ever, that no petition for voluntary bank
ruptcy shall be filed within one month of j
the passage therof, and no petition for ;
involuntary bankruptcy shall be filed
within four months of the passage i
thereof.
"Proceedings commenced under State ;
insolvency laws before the passage of
this act shall not be affected by it."
These two concluding clauses of the new
i national bankruptcy law have occasioned
many differences of opinion between Cali
fornia jurists, and in consequence local
attorneys are much interested. Judge 1
Hall of Alameda County has decided that |
las no petition can be filed in the United
, States courts until one month after the
I passage of the act, which took place on
July 1. the State courts have Jurisdiction
; until that time. Judge Hall bases his
I opinion. It is said, on the decision of the
case of Martin vs. Berry, where it was ;
held that the national bankruptcy act of â â 
ISG7 did not deprive the State courts of j
Jurisdiction until the date upon which
petitions could be filed in the United
States courts. Judge Belcher of this city,
however, has held, in an ex-parte pre
sentment, that the Federal law went into
full effect on July 1. and succeeded and '
is now operative instead of the State law
It is stated that Judge Jones of Contra
Costa County has decided the question
in accordance with Judge Belcher's opin
ion, i
The wording of the last clause In the â 
new act, "Proceedings commenced under '
State insolvency laws before the passage
of this act shall not be affected by it "
certainly leaves the inference that pro
ceedings commenced after the act will be
affected by it. and owing to this conclu
sion the consensus of opinion leans in
favor of the decision rendered by Judge i
Belcher. â  â

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 21, 1898.
THEY SHOWED
SOME PRACTICE
The San Francisco Nine
Play Ball.
WORKED LIKE VERY DEMONS
AN IMPROVEMENT NOTED IN
THEIR METHODS.
Manager Swanton Turned Over a
New Leaf and Made the Boys
Get Up and Dig â Now
Watch 'Em-
BY JOE CORBETT.
Last Sunday, before the biggest audi
ence that had ever attended the games at
Recreation Park, the Sand Crabs unmerci
fully defeated the San Franciscras.
The game was not what might be termed
a good one, for the reason that it was
too one-sided; yet it brought to view two
very important points, namely: that the
Sand Crabs have Improved wonderfully
since their last appearance here, and that
the San Franciscos Instead of doing like
wise, displayed the same old miserable
form.
In the case of the latter I was noi
surprised, despite the fact that they hau
only recently participated in a thirteen
inning game.
The form tney displayed In that mem
orable contest I attributed to Providence,
for I was ever of opinion that without
practice a tr-am cannot play steady ball.
It is possible, as the San Franciscos clear-
ly demonstrated in that great Stockton
game, for a team to occasionally pla>
superior ball; and the present standing of
the same team, In a slight manner, ad<3Â»
to the veracity of my opinion that a tean*
cannot play steady and winning ball with
out practice.
The San Franclscos were a long timo
ln agreeing with me on this point. The>
were provokingly persistent in adhering to
the methods employed by them at the out
set, which consisted of one simple ruleâ
"play any old kind of ball and get tho
money."
Whether it -was the awful drubbing
they received at the hands of the Sana
Crabs last Sunday, or the fact that peo
ple only turned out to see good games,
I am unable to state; yet the fact remains
that the San Franciscos have finally con.
descended to practice.
They not only condescended, but really
did turn out to a man on Tuesday aftei.
noon and worked like demons.
This little piece of news will no doubt
shock some of their supporters, and 1
might have done better had I conveyeu
the news more gently, but it was beyonfl
me to remain silent longer, and the reliei
resulting, I assure you, is astonishing.
However. I am not supposed to tell m>
own troubles in this article, and that, by
the way, is something I regret exceeed
ingly.
That the San Franclscos are practicing
certainly is news of a cheering nature.
The fans as well as myself have long
wished for it, and now that it is a reality
an opportunity of gauging th*Â» merits of
the team and its probaole standing is as
sured. This, however, must be left open
for a brief period, or at least until we are
certain that the team intends a pursuance
of Its present methods. I can say tnis
much, however. If the team continues to
practice at least two days out of the week
and secure the services of another goM
pitcher their chances of bringing up the
tail end will no longer be looked for.
I was so taken up with their ( ?ame that
I spoke to tneir manager and askeu him
how he accounted for the splendid show
ing of his team. "Practice." he said;
"nothing more. I came to the conclusion
that to win games my team must prac
tice, and so called the boys together and
told them so. I at the same time told
them that they must meet at my office
twice a week and that I would have car
riages to take them to and from the
grounds. I also placed a fine of $5 on any
one failing to put in an appearance; and
another thing. I went with them to the
grounds and saw that they did practice.
The results you have seen. '
This version of the team's improvement
should speed them on. There is nr.
reason in the world why they should not
accomplish what the Sand Crabs have.
Last Sunday they were shut out by
them. and no one was in a better position
to understand the reason and to soe the
wonderful improvement than myself. If
the reason was not fully understood Mr.
Swanton's statement should convey it.
if the managers of the San Franciscos
would adhere to his policy they
would be a good team and a drawingcard.
If they are not ambitious enough to take
these steps in the hops of improving the
team, self pride should spur the boys on.
One day's practice is far from being
sufficient. A team must practice con
tinually, and. if this be Impossible, at
least two days of the week should be
devoted to it. Don't give up ye "Blue
Ribbons" now that the important woÂ»k
is on. Stick to it. and it won't be long
before big crowds will be in attendance
whenever you play. You were Just on the
verge of destruction. TÂ«t providence has
been kind, and don't prove yourselves
ungrateful by practicing once or twice
and then giving up. And when you do
practice be sure that every man Is placed
in his proper and permanent position.
Put players in certain positions and keep
them there. Don't be changing around.
It demoralizes a team and spoils a player.
Hurrah for the Blue Ribbons!

GLOSSING OVER
LUMBER FRAUDS
School Board's Experts
Submit Their Reports.
A LARGE SHORTAGE FOUNn
MORE SHINGLES USEx> THAN
WERE. PURCHASED.
Derham Wants the Election of
Teachers to Take Place in
Open Meeting of the
Board.
President Barrington submitted to the
Board of Education last night the report
of the experts appointed by him to in
vestigate the lumber frauds unearthed
by the Grand Jury recently. The report,
as stated by Mr. Barrington, was badly
jumbled up and prepared in a great
hurry. His apparent haste to get it be
fore the Grand Jury, which was seconded
by the other members of the board, ap
pears to be the only reason for its present
incoherent state.
About all that could be made out of it
was the totals, which showed that the
department had purchased 724,407 feet of
lumber during the last tiscal year, and
the experts could only trace 649,714 feet,
leaving a shortage of 74,693 feet. The
president, however, reduces this shortage
by 15,000 feet by explaining that that
amount was used at the Durant School
and not credited by the experts.
The experts also found that the de
partment had used 55' JO more shingles
than had been purchase* during the year.
Mr. Barrington had this explanation to
offer for the apparent miracle. He said
that some shingles had been used for
which bills have not yet been received.
As the report only covers the last fiscal
year, no reason can be assigned for hold
ing back the bills for these shingles near
ly a month unless it be that the depart
ment had so far exceeded the appropria
tion for last year that it is endeavoring
to hold back some of its expenditures to
the present year.
While the report cuts down the lumber
deficit found by the disinterested experts
employed by the Grand Jury, still an ad
mitted shortage of S.\4QS feet (accepting
Barrington's accounting for 15.000 feet as
correct; shows some pretty rotten work,
â without taking into consideration the dis
crepancy and the quality and consequent
cost price of the lumber, which the
board's experts considerately refrained
from touching upon.
The following contracts for repairs were
awarded: J. F. Byrne, for graining Web

Fuller, brick work on Washington Gram
mar, $112; Conlon & Shipman. for paint

doing the same work In the Lincoln
School, $495; W. ML Fletcher, bulkhead
ing Irving Primary $2^"j3; P. Abrahamson,

$197.
Director Derham presented the follow
ing statement and amendment to the rules
which caused considerable consternation
among some of the directors. Under the
rules It went over for a week:
The members of this board have been re-
I quested by the chairman of the elementary
i committee to give to him the names of teachers
i to be appointed to places in the department.
i He states that there will be vacancies on the
; substitute list and the committee intends to
recommend that they be .fined. To my mind
the necessity for the appointment, and the ap
pointment of any teacher, is of sufficient Im
portance to require the consideration of the
entire board and should be taken out of the
hands of any committee of the board.
I desire at this meeting to submit for adop
tion an amendment to the , rules . making the
i appointment of any teacher a matter of open
I board proceeding. The name of the director
who proposes an applicant for appointment in
the department should not be withheld; it is
information to which the public is entitled, It
should be a matter of record and was a mat
ter of public record for year* prior to the
change of rule by this board.
Scores of teachers have been appointed and
our board records fail to show the name of
the director responsible for each appointment.
A reform in the procedure of electing a teach
er is necessary; It !s tardy, perhaps, but I hope
I that the board will effect it.
I ask for the adoption of the following
amendment to the rules: â¢
â¢ >Vhen any vacancy exists in the teaching
force of the department, such vacancy shall
be reported to the board by the committee hav
ing charge of the department in which it ex
ists.
â¢If the board desires to fill suoh vacancy,
nominations for the election of a teacher shall
be made in open board and the name of the
nominating director and the vote on such elec
tion shall in all eases be recorded in the min
utes of the board and the name of the nom
inating director shall also be of record in the
book kept for that purpose.
"Unasslgned teachers or regular teachers
temporarily not in charge of a class, shall be
placed at the head of the substitute list of the
department and shall be considered aa a part
of such substitute list."'
Director Ragan presented a long re
port on needed changes In the course of
study in the high schools, and the board
decided to hold a special meeting next
Monday night to consider the matter, and
also the progress of work on the Mission
i High School.
It was decided to build a new class
j room to the Park Primary School and the
! architect was directed to prepare plans

"SAX FRANCISCO, June 7, 1898.
"Quartermaster General, Washing
ton, D. C:
"This depot does not and has not
knowingly, during my incumbency,
employed Chinese labor on uniforms
or anything else manufactured or
contracted for here. On two early
contracts, made some weeks ago, I
discovered that Chinese labor was
being employed, and immediately
canceled contracts. Representa
tives of labor organizations visited
me, and, after explanation, ex
pressed themselves as perfectly sat
isfied. I invited them to investigate
and assist in ascertaining which
contractors employed Chinese labor
and stated that I would at once an
nul contracts. All contracts and
orders require white labor only to
be employed. It 4s my earnest de
sire to avoid all labor complications
which will embarrass the depart
ment or myself, but if the depart
ment desires indorsement from
Chamber of Commerce, Board of
Trade or reputable business men,
they have been tendered.
"LONG.
"Quartermaster in Charge."
The telegram of which the foregoing is
a copy may lead to international difficul
ties, and if it prove not so serious an of
ficer of the army may have to answer
charges of having misled the department
at Washington.
It has all developed from the effort
made by the labor organizations of this
city to force the men who were awarded
Government contracts for army uniforms
to employ white labor. They turned the
bulk of the work over to Chinese, thus
depriving thousands of white men and
women of the opportunity to make a liv
ing. The first complaint came from the
women, who called attention to the fact
that Chinese were employed on Govern
ment work, contrary to the laws of the
State.
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald investi
gated the complaint, found it a just one,
and referred It to Congressman Magulre
at Washington, .tie in turn referred' it
to the Wax Department. Secretar-- Alger
commenced an investigation through
quartermaster General Ludington. In due
course of time the complaint again reach
ed this city. This time It was received'
by Major Long, the quartermaster in
charge of the Department of California.
In reply he indorsed it, with the state
ment that he had canceled the contracts,
and that business men of San Francisco
had offered him indorsement of his
course.
The fact that contracts made with Chi
nese had been canceled was called to the
attention of the Chinese Minister at
Washington. The following correspond
ence, which gives the affair international
importance, is self-explanatory:
Department of State.
WASHINGTON, July 12, 1891.
His Excellency the Governor of California,
Sacramento, Cal. â Sir: I have the honor to
lnc!"se herewith a copy of a note from the
Chinese Minister at this capital. In which he
6tates that orders have been issued by the
Quartermasters' Department of the army to
contractors in San Francisco for army cloth
ing not to employ Chinese in the manufacture
of such clothing, thus making a discrimina
tion against his countrymen, in contravention
of the treaties between the United States and
China.
The Minister adds that Labor Commissioner
Fitzgerald of your State has assumed the po
sition that none of the labor under these con
tracts should be given to Chinese, and that
the commissioner is gathering information as
to what portion of the contracts is being exe
cuted by Chinese, with a view to rescinding the
contracts or stopping payment thereon.
I beg to request that you will cause an In
vestigation to be made of the Minister's com
plaint, and that you will Inform the depart
ment oÂ£ the result. Respectfully yours,

Hon. 'William R. Day, Secretary of State-
Sir: I deem it my duty, as the representative
of my Government, to bring to your attention
certain events which have transpired In the
city of San Francisco, to the serious injury of
Chinese subjects lawfully residents in the
Inited States, and entitled by treaty to the
peaceful pursuits of their industry.
It appears that the War Department of the
T'nitea States has let out contracts to certain
firms in San Francisco for the manufacture of
clothing and other supplies for the United
States Army, and that some of these firmt
have found it necessary or convenient to em
ploy Chinese to perform the labors in execu
tion of such contracts. As a result of this
employment a great outcry has been raised by
certain labor organizations and other persons
evil disposed toward Chinese laborers, and it
is understood that orders have been given
by officials of the Federal Government. thÂ»

practical effect of which is not to allow such
labor to be performed hereafter by the Chi
nese people. It is reported, for Instance. In
the San Francisco Examiner of May 22 last
that Major Oscar F. Long, assistant quarter
master of the United States Army, under
whose authority contracts were made, has
publicly made the following statement: "Com
plaints have been made to me that Chinese
labor has been employed In making some of
these garments (army clothing). For this
offense I have called two contractors before
me and rescinded their contracts with the
Government. I have told the representatives
of labor that if they bring the proof I will
rescind the contract of any merchant who em
ploys Chinese labor in filling Government con
tracts."
A similar declaration of Major Long ap
peared In The San Francisco Call of June 1.
and other newspapers of that city confirm the
correctness of these reports.
It also appears that Labor Commissioner
Fitzgerald has assumed the position that none
of the labor under these contracts should be
gi\-en to Chinese, and that he la employing his
subordinate officers in gathering information
as tn what portion of the Government con
tracts are being executed by Chinese, with a
view of rescinding the contracts or stopping
payment on the same. Statements to this
effect will be found In the issue of the news
papers already cited.
It would hardly seem necessary to recall to
you the fact that my Government, out of def
erence to lim wishes of that of the United
States consented Jo amend the treaty which
allowed free immigration of Chinese subjects
into the United States, and agreetl to the laws
which henceforth prohibited the coming of all
Chinese laborers, and in return thereof the
Government of the United States solemnly
(stipulated to extend to the Chinese subjects in
the United States the most ample protection
and the free enjoyment of all the privileges
and rights granted to the citizens of the most
favored nation.
I feel sure that you will agree with me that
the conduct of Major Long and Labor Com
missioner Fitzgerald Is in direct violation of
the spirit and letter of the treaty, and that
the President, upon this note being brought to
his attention, will order an investigation to
be made in the respective department with a
view to putting an end to the illegal and un
just discrimination sought to be enforced
against the Chinese subjects lawfully in the
United States. I shall be pleased to be in
formed of any steps which may be taken to
this end. Accept, sir, etc.,

Parrott Building, San Franciscoâ My Dear Sir:
I am directed by the Governor to forward you
enclosed copy of correspondence from the Sec
retary of State at Washington and the Chinese
Minister at Washington, which is self-explan
atory. The Governor requests that you imme
diately forward him a full report regarding
this matter, so that he may be able to make
proper explanation as per request from the
Department of State, Washington. Very re
spectfully, A. M BARRETT.
Adjutant General.
Governor Budd is at a loss to know,
why the matter was referred to him.
The officials of the State of California
have nothing whatever to do with the
letting 1 of contracts. Major Long is the
Governmental quartermaster, and the in
vestigation should properly be conducted
under the direction of United States offi
cials. If any treafy rights ha% - e been in
fringed they are the persons who are
responsible.
"I have just received this correspond
ence from Governor Budd," said Labor
Commissioner E. L. FitzgeraM yesterday.
"I am glad that it has assumed this wider
scope. It Is pleasant to know that for
once the appeal of labor has reached the
ears of men hiijh in authority at Wash
, ington, even though it was through the
Instrumentality of Chinese.
"My report to the Government will be
an exhaustive one. It will embrace every
particle of correspondence, testimony and
evidence collected by myself and my dep
uties. It will be farreaching and will have
the effect of placing the work where It
belongsâ with the women who are clam
oring for a chance to earn their living.
1 It will correct all the wrongs they have
I suffered at the hands of the quartermas-
I ter's department.
"Major Long will have to explain why
| he sent the telegram saying that con
i tracts were canceled. The Chinese com-
I plain that this is discrimination. If they
! were not canceled, and we will offer proof
I that they were not, some one spoke false
;ly to the War Department. As late as
i yesterday we found officers' clothing be
ing made at 1120 Stockton street by Chi
nese. Mrs. Eva Bates, president of the
! Federation of Women, and Mrs. Jordan.
I reported that they and other women are
'â â  sewing buttons on clothes that they may
j be made wearable. These garments have
! been accepted as completed by Govern
1 ment officials.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. July 20.â The slight Increase la
the volume of dealings In stocks to-day would
by no means warrant the term animated, but
It conveyed an Intimation that business In
â Wall street is not entirely dead. Any strik
ing development In the situation would lead
to an outbreak of activity in speculation. The i
morning advance was occasioned by nothing
morfe than the covering by short contracts put
out by small traders yesterday morning. The
assertion that the Madrid Cabinet had deter- ]
mined upon negotiations for peace was used i
to advance prices and it was rather significant
that they held firm In spite of the demon
strated unreliability of the report and the de
cline in Spanish 4s in London and Paris. Re
assuring official utterances from Washington I
regarding the yellow fever situation and trom
the Metropolitan Street Railway authorities
regarding the effect of the temporary suspen- i
sion of a part of their lines pending reconstruc
tion removed the principal elements of yester- '
day's uneasiness. The foreign exchange mar
ket is showing the effect of grain bills coming
forward and Is heavy in tone and dropping
toward the gold Imports after net Imports of
gold for the year of about $100,000,000. But
money continues easy and rates for the time
money are quotably lower.
The demand for Denver and Gulf lsts on re
organization prospects continued to-day and
there was a distinct weakening of activity in
Bonie of the other speculative bonds which
moved so conspicuously last week. Prices in >
a number of other cases are notably higher.
Total sales, 12,600,000.
The new Government 3s when Issued were in
strong demand to-day and 103% was bid for ,
them In Wall street. A transaction was made
at 103%. United States new 4s and the 2ds
advanced 1 per cent, the old 4s coupon and the
Is registered *4 and the 6s coupon 4 per cent i
In the bid price.-
Total sales of stocks to-day were 140,100
shares. Including 10,150 Atchlson preferred, 3800

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July 20.â The lower temperature
in the spring wheat territory following laEt
night's rain, together with the early decline j
in corn, started wheat weak. Business during
the first part of the session was dull and the
undertone bearish. The argument was urged
that our export surplus would be of such
magnitude and the foreign demand so re- |
stricted that it is likely to glut the market j
and lower prices would be Inevitable. Another i
factor which served to weaken bull confidence
was Broomhall's figures, showing the world's
wheat crop this year likely to be 120,01
bushels above requirements. Then came a re- j
action on the announcement of the Signal i
Service Bureau oÂ£ the probability of i:<^ts
to-night in the northern sections of the wheat |
i belt. In addition to the frost predictions the i
bulls got some encouragement from the pri- |
I mary market receipts of new wheat being too â 
, light to injuriously affect the price of the cash I
article. There was also a report that crops ,
â  abroad were less favorable, as severe storms
In Hungary had damaged the crops there from i
' 8.000,000 to 10,000,000 bushels. September closed
Vs'S'ic lower and December lost 4c.
Every commission house appeared to have
i selling orders for corn at the opening. Rain
; throughout a large section of the Western
country was the cause of weakness at the
start. This was all changed later, however,
when the Weather Bureau's report of possible
I light frosts In northern sections of the corn
! belt was received. September left oft un
j changed.
Oats held steady on good buying by com- j
mission houses and responded promptly when
corn rallied. September advanced 4c on the
day.

buying sufficed to take all that was tor sale
as "a result of the decline that Inaugurated the
day's business, which was easily overcome.
Pork quit "4c higher. Lard and ribs are up

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, July 20.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say ' to-morrow of the
wool trade: The. market Is improving, not
very fast as regards prices, but with more or
less speed as regards the number of inquiries.
The. fact appears to be that some of the mills
have sold a good deal of yarns, perhaps at
come reductions, though at a good profit,
nevertheless, ana are becoming rather anxious
to get their hands on good lots of wool before
the raw material advances. There have been
very good-sized transactions since our last
report. A feature In the market has been an
increase In the number of sellers. The de
mand for unwashed fleeces has been unremit
| ting and there has also been quite a movement
in the medium and washed fleeces. Prices are
nearly unchanged, but the feeling regarding
them Is somewhat more encouraging than a
week ago.
! The sales of the week In Boston amount to
I 1,639,000 pounds domestic and 815,500 pounds
foreign, making a total of 2,454,600, against a
I total of 1.556.000 for the previous week and a
total of 5,941,000 for the corresponding week
last year.

London's "smart set" no longer uses
the costly table cloths and napkins
seen last year, but at supper parties
the mahogany or oak table is covered
with flowers closely pressed together, a
carpet of rose leaves, carnation petals
or Parma violets hiding the cloth be
neath. London borrows this fashion
from Russia, where, all through the
winter, huge boxes of violets are re
ceived from the Rivera, and, strange to
say, the flowers are perfectly fresh and
fragrant, so carefully are they packed.
One of the uses for which balloons may
be employed is the investigation of the
sea bottom. It has been found by aero
nauts that frequently the bottom is clear
ly visible from a balloon through the
water. This fact has recently been made
use of to recover a torpedo boat which
had been lost off Toulon. Not only was
this found, but two others, which had
vanished at an earlier date.

NOTEâ In the above exposition of the tides
the early morning tides are given in the left
hand column and the successive tides of the
day in the order of occurrence as to time. The
second time column gives the second tide of
the day, the third time column the third tide
and the last or right .iand column gives the
last tide of the day, except when there are but
three tides, as sometimes occur. The heights
given are additions to the soundings on the
T'nited States Coast Survey charts, except
when a minus sign (â ) precedes the height,
and then the number given is subtracted from
the dep'h given by the charts. The plane of

-DIRE CALAMITY
AS PREDICTED BY
AN OAKLANDER
A Spectacle That Republicans in California
Will Be Spared.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway. July 20.
The State Central Committee having
announced that it is ready to take up
the work of the fall campaign, Repub
licans in Alameda County have sud
denly become very active. After next
â¢day, when the committee meets,
there will be some definite object in
Bight for which to work, and the gn v
eling in the dark regarding primaries,
apportionment and time of the State
convention will be over.
The two rival political camps, headed j
respectively, by W. R. Davis and Dr. I
Fardee, are just now interesting poli
ticians to the almost total exclusion
of all other matters, not exceping even
the Congressional contest. The friends
of Pardee, who have considerably de- ;
creased in number during the past two
months, are straining every nerve to
make a good appearance for their in
dependent candidate. Many of those
who are anxious to be known as Re
publicans and who started out along
the Pardee trail are now deserting that
camp and allying themselves with the
Republican candidate for the first place
on the State ticket. During the past
week one of the most positive proofs
of the trend of popular feeling has been
Shown by the frantic efforts of candi
dates for national and county offices to
disclaim all connection with the guber
natorial fight. Not a candidate can
be found who will frankly admit that
he is making his fight In connection
with Mr. Davis or especially with Mr.
Pardee, if such Candida: expects to go
before a Republican convention. _
Dr. Pardee hates to hear the truth,
and if there be one thing that he hates
more it is the truth about himself. A
few days ago he published a statement
headed "The Mask Off." The natural
presumption would be that after seeing
the heading, it would be followed by a
confession from "the doctor." For
many years the doctor, according to his
own statements, has been hiding under
all kinds of masks, and the reader of
his organ expected to be informed as
to which one of the masks was off. But
euch presumption was followed by
grievous disappointment. Dr. Pardee
says: "Whatever a few stiffen political
Bchemers may do or say the Immense
majority of the Republicans of the
county want an Alameda County can
didate nominated for Governor, and
not only that, but they will support
him ben nominated. They may have
their preferences as to who the candi
date shall be, but they do not say or
mean that if their own candidate be
not selected, they will not vote for the
nominee." For once Dr. Pardee, the
independent candidate, inadvertently
told the truth, and it is a puzzle to
the Republicans why the doctor should
have done so. There is only one little
correction to be made In the quoted
statement. It should read, "the Im
mense majority of the Republicans of
this county want an Alameda County
Republican candidate for Governor,"
then it would have been perfect.
"With Infinitesimal exception," says
Dr. Pardee. in his most recent article
published in his paper regarding him
self, "the friends of either candidate
would support the other if he were
nominate J-by â a Republican - conven
tion." This is very eenerous of Dr.
Pardee to offer his Independent follow
ing to the Repu'. licans, but judged in
the light of the doctor's past record, it
must be very humiliating to himself.
In recent campaigns the doctor has
done everything possible according to
his own speeches to disrupt local Re
publicanism. He has two things to
boast of. and he has boasted of them
often. One Is that he walked out of the
Republican convention and devoted his
energies to electing John Glascock, a
Democrat, for Mayor, and the other is
that he allowed himself to become what
he calls a "selfish political schemer" for
the purpose of securing his own elec
tion as Mayor and beating Tim L. Bar
ker, a life-long Republican and an old
time honored citizen of Oakland.
If this spirit among Dr. Pardee's fol
lowers be changed, and he says in his
article, "there Is probably less of this
feeling at the present time than on al
most any former occasion" â the
"infinitesimal exception" must be Dr.
Pardee himself. This deduction is
borne out by the manner in which Dr.
Pardee through his organ Is besmear
ing, ridiculing and misrepresenting
â¢-thing done In the interests of the
Republican candidate from this county.
"We know of no advocates of Dr.
Pardee who would refuse to support
Mr. Davis. They have only the friend
liest feeling toward that gentleman,
and the hlrhest opinions of his motives
and ability." says the doctor. If a cow
could laugh It would laugh Itself Into
hysterics at this statement, viewed In
the 'light of the reports of Mr. Davis'
doings and meetings that have ap
peared in Dr. Pardee's paper. If it be
an impression of "friendly feeling." If it
.be a proof of respect to a "eentleman."
If it be a demonstration of "the highest
opinion of his (Mr. Davis') motives and
ability" to treat a man as the Republi
can candidate has been treated In Dr.
Pardee's paper, then it is lime Agnews
and similar places were turned loose,
for the wrong class of people are now
contained within their walls. It would

WOBKING ON BRAINS.
Food Specialist Brings Out a
Novelty.
A food expert at Battle Creek, Mich.,
connected with the Postum Cereal Co.,
Lim., has produced a food especially
intended for rebuilding the brain. It
is a well known fact among physicians
that examination of perspiration and
urine will tell whether the individual
has been actively using the brain or
not.
Brain work exhausts the phosphates
which appear in the excreta above
mentioned. Administration of inor-
ganic phosphorus or phosphates does
not readily suppl" the waste, for na-
ture demands that phosphates be made
up and blended in food which she fur-
nishes. Advantage has been taken of
this knowledge and a scientific selec-
tion of part of the grain has been
made, and these have been put through
mechanical processes parallel to the
processes through which food is passed
in its management by the human diges-
tive organs. Therefore the .new food
Is not only ready to serve without cook-
ing, but it has passed through the
process where the starches have been
changed to grape-sugar, and that
with the proteids, organic phosphates,
â¢ef\. are at once ready to be quickly*
absorbed and turned to use in vitaliz-
ing and nourishing the parts of the
body like brain, solar plexus, and the
delicate nerve centers.
The new food has been given the
name of Grape-Nuts, and far from
being a "("'rank's Food," "Invalid 1 !
Food," or anything of that sort, it is
a criep, sweet-novelty charming to the
athlete, brain worker, epicure, or In-
valid.
Grape- Nuts can be had of grocers,
and a trial dish for breakfast will bÂ«
found a pleasant experience.
be interesting for some independent as
pirant for the nomination for Governor
to indulge Alameda County with new
definitions of "friendliest feelings,"
'gentleman" and "highest opinions."
And Dr. Pardee emitter all this ;
meaningless and retroactive jargon and i
dissimulation because the fact was i
printed that factionalism in Alameda
County has frequently defeated an hon- I
est Republican candidate. This fact, j
as Dr. Pardee and all Republicans '
know, is lamentably true, and it has
been caused almost entirely by the bit
terness engendered and the example !
set by Dr. Pardee and others of his
own selfish pattern.
Ten years ago the local Republican
party was split by bolters at the muni- '
convention through the personal
ei.orts of Dr. Pardee. as testified to by
the doctor in his tabernacle speech of
February 16. 1593. Five years ago. Dr.
Pardee, knowing he could not obtain
the Republican nomination, was nomi
nated independently, and prevented the
election of another Republican Mayor.
Three years ago, in his Thomas Hall
speech on March 5. he predicted dire
calamities if the Republican party suc
ceeded.
These are the actions which Dr. Par
uee now condemns, but for which he
alone la responsible.
Now, when the doctor heads a state
ment "The Mask Off," one is inclined
to ask, which mask? Is It the mask of
the creature of the railroad, the water
company and the gang," which Dr.
Pardee declared are the constituent ele
ments of the Republican party? Is it
the mask of "independent politics" or
of the "bolter" or the mask of any
other of the many disguises assumed
by the doctor during the past few
years? These questions he alone can
answer.
A week ago the doctor stated that the
publication of some of his own speeches
was done for the purpose of opposing
him politically and for the further pur
pose of falling into the hands of his
opponent and the railroad company at
the proper time. Since the doctor gave
vent to this expression he has taken
another turn on his political wheel,
and In his notorious "The Mask Off"
article he says "the aim was to kill off
the strongest candidate, or else to
equalize the forces of the two that they
might kill one another." This twist of
the Pardee thinking machine inspires
hope that the doctor may yet become
rational enough to be at least logical,
and those who have the interests of
Republicanism at heart are now confi
dent that within another week \he doc
tor will undergo another revolution and
finally discover that there are not two
Republican candidates in this county.
and consequently one cannot kill off
the other, however much this may be
desired.
But the Independent candidacy of Dr.
Pardee is no loneer taken seriously in
this county. Apparently it is not taken
any more seriously in the rest of the
State, for two days ago the doctor pub
lished nine extracts from newspapers
showing the "trend of thought" in Cal
ifornia â toward Pardee of course. One
was from the Herald of Trade, pub
lished in San Francisco; another from
the Eureka Californian; another from
the Elmhurst Rex-lew; another from
the Eureka Standard, whil the remain
ing- fnur are from papers published in
the city of Alameda, Dr. Pardee In this
instance, unhappily for himself, un
doubtedly told the truth. Had he been
able to refer with pride to the opinions
of the great papers of San Francisco,
Los Angeles, Sacramento, Oakland (ex
cepting his own), Stockton, San Diego,
Santa Cruz. San Jose and other towns
in the State a little larger than Elm
hurst and Eureka, he would have ac
complished something In his own be
half. As it is. his self-effcrt to inflate
his own political balloon has most
beautifully demonstrated the weakness
of a farce. And to offset this and make
the farce more complete. If such a
thing be possible, the friends of the Re
publican candidate are busily circulat
ing extracts highly commendatory of
W. R. Davis, published in Frank
Leach's paper before it was controlled
by Dr. Pardee.
One who has closely followed politi
cal history in this county for the past
few years has compiled a comparative
statement of Dr. Pardee's claims to the
Governorship of this State, and, also,
of the facts tending to show why the
doctor. If he has any Idea of propriety,
should go to Castle Crag and stay there
until after the inauguration of the next
Republican Governor of California. The
statement is as follows:

THE SAX FEA^CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JL r LT 21, 1898.
ELI DENISON
NOT WEALTHY
Had Deeded Property to
His Children.
WILL FILED FOR PROBATE
THE ENTIRE ESTATE LEFT TO
THE WIDOW.
His Immense Train Business Was
Incorporated Before His Last
Sickness Came Upon
Him.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
&0S Broadwa^ July 20.
Senator Eli Denison did not possess
much of an estate outside of his interests
in the news business when he died. This
afternoon his will was filed for probate,
and also the petition of his wife for let
ters of administration.
The will of the deceased Senator was
written in October, eight years ago, and
-â aths the entire estate, valued at
I, to the widow and to his two
brothers, Harry Denison and Joseph L.
Denison. The brothers receive $luvu apiece
arid the balance is to be held by the
widow during her lifetime and afterward
to pass into the possession of the two
daughters and his stepson. The petition
states that the estate consists of stocks,
notes, bonds and real estate of the ap
proximate value of JoO.uoG, but It is be
lieved to be much greater. Aoout three
months ago Senator Denison incorporated
his Immense news and other interests on
the Southern Pacific system and his chil
dren are large Htuckholders with himself.
This properly, it Is believed, ifl not In
cluded in the widow's estimate.
After referring to the legacies to his
brothers the will says: "I do give and
bc<;ueath the whole value of my estate,
both real and personal , unto my beloved
wife, Celia M. Dt-nlswn. and I do request
that she manage the said estate care
fully, using only so much thereof as may
be required for the comfortable mainte
nance of herself and children, and that at
her decease she leave the residue of said
property to our two daughters, Olive and
Lurar.la, and to my stepson, Harvey Slo
per, share and share alike. I make no di
rect provision herein for my two daugh
ters because I have already made pro
vision for them by deed from myself to
each of them."
The will provides that the widow do as
she pleases with the property, and that
6he convert enough into cash at once to
pay the legacies and the expenses of the
Senator's sickness and funeral.
SHE PREPARES TO
ANSWER HER DAUGHTER
PRELIMINARIES IN THE BALD
WIN-BAIRD SUIT.
In Justice to Her Other Children the
Mother Decides to Fight the
Legal Battle to the Bitter
End.
Within ten days, the limitation allowed
by law, Mrs. Veronica C. Baird will file
her answer to the suit brought by her
daughter, Marie Baldwin, wife of Barry
Baldwin Jr., praying: for the return of
stocks valued at $43,000.
The suit, while it cajne as a surprise to
the members of the Balrd family, was
not altogether unexpected. Mrs. Baldwin
had freely discussed the suit with her
brother, John R. Baird. No later than
Tuesday afternoon she promised to delay
the matter, but nevertheless with or !
without her knowledge the suit was filed
that very afternoon.
A peaceful arrangement, provided such
a thing had been possible, would have
pleased Mrs. Baird, who feels keenly the
notoriety thrust upon her. Now. how
ever, there is no chance of a compromise,
Mrs. Baird deciding that In Justice to her
self and her other children the suit must
be fought to the finish.
Mrs. Baird smarts keenly under the
charge brought by her daughter, in which
she alleges that her mother advised her
: to cast off arid abandon her husband.
John R. Baird, in his mother's name.
; took special exception to that clause of
the complaint, and stated that although
his mother had never become reconciled
to Marie's marriage to young Baldwin,
1 still she would never advocate measures
that might prove harmful to her daugh
ter's happiiiL-as.
"Marie lived with us for many months
after her marriage," Mr. Baird explained,
"and although my mother never saw her
husband, Mr. Baldwin visited his wife
continually. Their child was born in our
home, and up to a few days ago Marie
was a constant visitor at the house. She
la a very fitful girl," Mr. Baird continued,
. "and I suppose that the suit was filed by
her while in one of her capricious moods."
John Baird attains his majority within
i three days, and to show his unbounded
| confidence in hlB mother he proposes to
turn over his inheritance to her for safe
keeping.
THE FIRST PILOT.
H. S. Steams of Pawtucket, R. 1., the
first pilot of a ferry boat across San
Franciso Bay, arrived from the East yes
terday. With but one exception this is
the first visit that Mr. Steams has made
to this coast since he left here in 1554.
In ISSO, when the tide of immigration
moved westward, Steams came to this
coast with the machinery necessary to
equip a steam laundry. His route of
travel was over the isthmus and the ma
chinery was packed over the twenty miles
from Aspinwall to Panama on the backs
of mules.
Once arrived in this city he engaged in
a number of enterprises. Lam] was very
cheap and he bought lots in the present
location of Sansome street. A few years
after this he sold his property for a half
interest in the Hector, a steamboat
which was built to ply between San Fran
cisco and a point far up the San Andreas
Creek. A very much scattered popula
tion in the vicinity of Oakland wished
him to stop at that place and make it a
station along his line of travel, but he re
fused. Large tracts of land were offered
htm if he would do this, but at that time
it seemed a useless and foolish thing
to accept the offer, considering the scar
city of settlers where the city of Oakland
now stands.
Soon after he had established his Terry
line competition sprang up and Steams
was forced to the wall. He then moved
to the East, where he has been engaged
In cotton manufacturing.
GAMBLING RUINED HTML
William Gridley Purposely Steals to
Get to San Quentin.
William Gridley was yesterday held to
answer before the Superior Court by
Judge Mogan on a charge of grand lar
ceny in $2000 bonds. He went into the
ievrelry store of Glindemann & Schweit
zer 5 Third street. Monday night, and
stole two gold watches. He was chased
and captured.
Gridley's respectable appearance arous
ed more than usual interest in him. He
was anxious to get out of court for fear
that some one might recognize him. It
turns out that Gridley is not his true
name and that he for years held a re
sponsible position with the Pacific Saw
Manufacturing Company. His passion
for gambling ruined him and he deliber
atetly stole the watches to g<?t sent to
San Quentin.

VANCOUVER, B. C, July 20.âAc
cording to advices brought by the Em
press of India from Hongkong, the
, chief news of the moment is that Ma
| nila is ready to surrender. Not that
i the Archbishop and captain general
; are going to voluntarily capitulate be
'â¢ fore they are compelled to do so, but
i that the backbone of resistance is un
questionably broken, and upon a real
â  show of force and intention to bom
bard the town If the officials do not
give In, the Spaniards will haul down
I the Spanish flag. Intimations to this
; effect are received from many sources.
The correspondent of the Hongkong
: Press, writing under date of June 23,
says the chief subject of discussion in
Manila, in Cavite and in the American
; fleet is the meaning of the presence of
j five German men-of-war and one
] transport or supply vessel in port. I
have just interviewed a leading Eng
! lishman here on the subject. He un
hesitatingly informed me that all for
eigners in Manila, as well as Spaniards,
regard It as a remarkable demonstra
' tlon.
"I am sure," he continued, "that the
Spaniards have received encourage
ment from such a naval display. A
Spaniard to-day told me that the com
ing of a large German squadron was
construed by him and leading Spanish !
officials as a direct act of friendly in- I
terest and to warn the Yankees that 1
they could not go too far. Now, when
a Spaniard of influence, as this man
was, will talk like that I think It is
high time to ascertain what the Ger- !
mans mean by appearing here in such
force."
"I am familiar," my Informant con
tinued, "with all the German Interests
In Manila, and my relations with the
Germans are very agreeable, and I am
positive that one German cruiser
would be fully able to protect them to
every extent they required."
Further details of the great fight of
May 1 filter through some high officials
of Manila as time passes. It now ap
pears, according to authentic Informa
tion in the hands of Consul Wildman,
that out of 491 men on the Reina Chris
tina, 364 were killed: only 127 left the
ship. An officer who was aboard and
is now In prison tells me that one
could not step a foot In any direction
on her decks without coming into con
; tact with pieces of flesh of dead bodies.
! Such was the power of the Amer
i ican guns and the skill of the Ameri
| can gunners.
Manila papers continue to publish
monstrous stories about the Amerlcnms
and do not hesitate to employ the most
contemptuous epithets, all of which are
whetting the appetites of the Ameri
cans to get even with them for un
called-for Insults.
More seizures of arms are reported
from Hongkong. It Is suspected that
j the arms and ammunition were to be
I shipped to the Philippine insurgents.
; The seizure consist of half a million
rounds of Mauser ammunition, 20*
breech-loading Mauser rifles and 112
muzzle-loading Enfleld rifles.

SEWING WOMEN TO
ACT IN CONCERT
HOW THEY WILL OVERCOME
CHINESE COMPETITION.
Women's Sewing Association to In
corporate and Maintain a Well-
Equipped Plant.
Preliminary steps were taken at Py
thian Castle last evening for the organi
zation of the American Women's Sewing j
Association, and Mrs. M. E. Squire, Mrs.
Addle L. Ballou. Mrs. Angle Ayres, Mrs.
L. R. Oblinger and Mrs. H. Anselm were
unanimously chosen directors. About 200 ,
working women were in attendance, and i
Mrs. M. E. Squire presided. Mrs. Addle â 
L. Ballou made a few remarks. In which i
she urged the women to act In concert, j
She said she was with the soldier, but i
also with the girl he left behind.
W. W. Allen next spoke. He had en
listed in this work to produce a remedy
for the evil complained of, and also urged
organizing a sowing association. He said
he had submitted the scheme to Labor
Commissioner E. L. Fitzgerald, from
whom he read a letter, in which he did
not favor the Idea of labor purchasing
stock. Mr. Allen said it was the purpose
to Incorporate for $20,000 and issue shares
at $1 each. Labor would not be required
to put up one cent, but could purchase
6tock since this Is a free country. He
also assured the women that he had an
option on a two-story building, and ma
chinery for a plantâ rent at $25 per month
and machines at $17 each: that it was the
purpose of the proposed association to
manufacture articles and place them on
the market, giving the laborers 70 per
cent and the asociation 30 per cent of the
profits. The Columbia Banking Company
would act as treasurer. Major Long had
assured him there would be no more
work let to Chinese employers.
The aforementioned directors were then
chosen, and these will meet to-morrow
evening in Mr. Allen's office in the Par
rott building for the purpose of perma
nently organizing. The ladles will have an
advisory council of gentlemen.
During the evening Mrs. Naomi Ander
son, a woman of color, wanted to know
whether her race was to be excluded.
Mr. Allen assured her If this were the
case he would henceforth withhold his
counsel. Japanese, however, will not be
admitted.
Wants Damages for Injuries.
John C. Tormey filed suit yesterday

BOLDLY WINKED
AT HIS HONOR
THE GRAVE ERROR COMMITTED
BY PRETTY MRS. CARISON.
She Pleaded With Her Eyes, but
Stern Judge Conlan Says She
Must Be Punished.
A comely little woman with black hair
and a hesitating eye had the temerity to
attempt to make a "mash" on Judge Con
lan yesterday, and now she la sorry thai
she did It
She is Mrs. Nellie Carlson, the wife of
a longshoreman living on Langton street,
and she was charged by her husband with
being a "common drunk." She is the
mother of five children, the youngest be
ing only eight months old.
The case came up for hearing yester
day morning, and while her husband was
testifying Mrs. Carlson took a seat close
beside him. The Judge wheeled rounu
on his chair and faced husband and wife.
Carlson testified that his wife had been
a slave to drink for four or five years
and neglected her children.
Mrs. Carlson deliberately winked at the
Judge, to the amusement of those who
witnessed it. The Judge was amazed,
but thinking the wink might be intended
tot some one else he looked arouna. ;
There was no one behind him, and as ho '
again faced Mrs. Carlson she again de- i
liberately winked her eye and said in a
loud whisper: "Don't believe him, Judge
dear."
The Judge's brow flushed with anger,
and as he glanced around and saw the
amused smiles on the faces of those near
Mrs. Carlson he sternly said: "Take that
woman downstairs to the prison. I will i
remand her until to-morrow without bail, !
when she will appear for sentence."
The Judge had not recovered from the
shock to his dignity after the court ad
journed. "The impertinence of the
woman," he said, "to deliberately wink at
me twice. Such a thing never occurred
to me before in my court. I will teacta
her a lesson to-morrow morning. I could
not believe my eyea at first, but when
she repeated the wink there was no mis
taking that she meant me."
Mrs. Carlson was seen in her ce.ll- and
laughed when asked why she had/ so fai
forgotten herself as to wink at the Judge.
"I didn't know he was the Judge," she
said, "and he seemed such a pleasant
gentleman that I couldn't help it. What
harm was there in It. anyway? I am
sorry if he feels hurt about it.
"My husband had no right to say what
;he did. I have been a good mother to his
children and never took more than n
glass or two of beer, which he is fond
of himself. I have been in prison nearly
j two days now. and I think it is punish
1 ment enough."
PRIVATE INSURANCE
EXEMPT FROM TAX
Apropos of the recently passed stamp
tax laws Collector Lynch has dug up an
old decision made June 16, 1863, which in
every particular fits the new law. It is
as follows:
Under Schedule C of the excise law. medi
cines or preparations made and sold, or re
moved and sold, wherever the person making
or preparing the same has, or claims to have,
any private formula or occult art for making
or preparing the same, or has or claims to
have, any exclusive right or title to making
or preparing them, or which are recommended
or held out to the public by the makers, ven
dors or proprietors, as proprietary medicines,
or as remedies or specifics for disease, are sub
ject to stamp duties.
By the 107 th section It is provided that the
act shall not apply to any compounded me
dicinal drug or chemical, nor to any medi
cines compounded according to the United
States or national pharmacopla, nor of
which the full and proper formula is published
In either of the dispensatories, formularies or
text books In common use among physicians
and apothecaries, nor in any pharmaceutical
Journal now used by any incorporated college
of pharmacy and not sold or offered for sale or
advertised under any other name, form or
guise than that under which they may be sev
erally denominated and laid down in said
pharmacopias, dispensatories, text books or
Journals.
The intention of the act of Congress is plain.
It is to subject to stamp duty every kind of
preparation made and sold as medicinal, and
claimed by the maker or vendor to be propri
etary, or recommended as possessing peculiar
virtues Imparted in the manufacture by the
secret art or occult formula of the manufac
turer; and it is to exempt from duty all medi
cines known in trade, or compounded accord-
Ing to some published formula, or any me
dicinal treatise, recognized by the professors
of medical science, and not offered for sale un
der any guise or pretence of proprietorship.
It matters not, therefore, what the commo
dity may be. substance or essence, that is pre
pared and removed for sale. If it Is claimed or
pretended to be a compound of which the for
mula is secret, or which the right of making
is the exclusive property of one or more per
sons. Though it be only bread rolled Into
pills, or rain water imprisoned In little vials
and to be taken in drops, the claim or pre
tense of the vendor determines its character.
It cannot be treated as medicines for the cus
tomer and bread and water only for the tax
collector. The dealer must be taken for what
he professes to be, and If he seeks profit by
deluding the public he must pay for hie privi
lege like an honest man. The assumption
must be taken for the fact, and when that of
a proprietary right or secret art or knowledge
clearly appears, no Inquiry as to the composi
tion of the drug will be pertinent or proper. If
the packet, box, pot, vial or other enclosure is
not stamped the penalties of the act are In
curred and ought to be enforced.
Among other recent decisions is one
affecting mutual benefit Insurance com
panies, which provides that purely co
operative or mutual fire Insurance com
panies, carried on solely by members for
their protection and not for profit, are ex
empt. Whenever the business of the as
sociation or company goes beyond the
point of protection it is liable to taxation
at the rate provided by law. Co-operative
building and loan associations are not ex
empt from any tax except upon their
stock and bonds.
Stamps may be affixed to the books of
underwriters representing the tax on
premiums charged on marine Insurance.
Wines bottled for aging purposes must
be stamped at the time of bottling as
wine bottled for sale.
Statements in the form of goods im
ported by mail are subject to stamp tax
as regular entries. The tax is required
on original entries at the Custom-house
but not on duplicates.
CUTTING RATES ON
CALIFORNIA WINES
The freight war between the steamer
lines to New York. and the railroads has
not abated a jot. The Pacific Mail has
made a further reduction on wine tariffs,
and back of this recent lowering of
freight charges on wine to 36 cents per
hundred pounds is a commercial accident
which will cost several of the large wine
establishments several extra thousand
dollars for freightage.
A few days ago the sailing vessel Roan
oke, belonging to John Rosenfeld's Sons,
left San Francisco for Ne.w York laden '
with 3200 tons of wine. The freight rate
on the clipper line is 45 cents. Hardly !
had the sails been unfurled when the Pa- j
cine Mail reduced its rate from 45 cents
to 36 cents. The clipper line's route is
around the Horn, and the Pacific Mail by
way of Panama. Not only would the
time of shipment have been lessened by
many days but the saving on freight |
charges would have been very considera- j
ble. The aggregate saving would have j
amounted to at least $22,464. The heaviest i
loser is the California Wine Association. !
Lachman & Jacobi are second on the list,
and the California Wlnemakers' Corpora
tion comes a close third.
There has been a general reduction
made by the Pacific Mail within the last
few month 6. The former rail rates on '
wine were 75 cents, by way of Panama 65 :
cents and by the clipper line 45 cents.
Then the Panama lines reduced to 45
cents and the Southern Pacific followed
in the wake. The clipper lines clung to
the 45 cent rate, and now the Pacific Mall
has made another inroad, the present 36
cent tariff. This rate applies to all ship
ments, no matter what siae, materially
affecting the small shippers, who now
have an opportunity to compete with the
big wine establishments since the discrep
ancy between the rates for large and
small shipments has been removed. There
have been other reductions made by the
Pacific Mall steamship line. The tariff
on borax has been lowered from 40 cents â 
to 36 cents; rubber Junks from 50 cents to ;
45 cents, and rags from 60 cents to 45 .
cents.
To meet this reduction on these several
commodities the Southern Pacific will also
be forced to lower its tariff rates. The
clipper line will be in the same position,
and general reductions may be expected.
CAMP MERRITT IS
IN BAD CONDITION
DECLABED A PUBLIC NUISANCE I
BY THE HEALTH BOARD.
Health Officer Oallwey Says That
There Is Great Danger of Its
Spreading Infectious
Diseases.
Camp Merritt haÂ« been condemned as
a nuisance by the Board of Health. This
action was taken yesterday after a re
port prepared by Health Officer Gallwey
had been read to the members of the
board. It was conclusively shown by the i
report that the camp was In poor sanl- ,
tary condition, and that unless it was ,
| removed there was danger of the spread j
of infectious diseases. The United States ;
Government officials arrived at the same i
conclusion a few days ago, and steps
were at once taken to remove the volun- i
| teer Boldiers to the Presidio. Dr. Gall- j
I wey was instructed to notify the owners '.
jof the property now occupied by the !
â¢ troops to abate the nuisance as soon as
| the soldiers leave the camp.
Dr. G. E. Sussdorff . Resident Physician j
I of the City and County Hospital, filed a .
i report, asking that an isolated one-story |
ward of twelve rooms be built on the hos- |
i pital grounds to accommodate those suf
; ferine from measles, diphtheria, scarlet
â  fever and other contagious diseases. The
ward can be constructed for $1200. and it
is badly needed, as at present there is no
provision made for the accommodation of
6uch cases.
Complaint was made that insane pa
tients were being sent from the Receiv
! ing Hospital to the City and County Hos
! pital, and Secretary Godchaux was in
! structed to notify the proper officials that
' the only place for Insane patients was in
the insane ward attached to the Receiv
; ing Hospital.
Professor Frank T. Green was appoint
! Ed chemist of the Health Office during
the Illness of Professor Wenzell, who has
been unable through sickness to attend
to his duties for some time past.
A communication from Auditor Broder
ick. asking by what authority of law the
Health Board spent $600 for office fixtures,
was referred to the legal adviser of the
board.
The committee appointed to investigate
the charges made that Quarantine Officer
Chalmers was using his office to secure
] private practice asked lor and was grant
ed further time to report.
The board then adjourned, after In
structing Chemist Green to analyze the
I water furnished the city, and make a re
; port as to its condition.

THE TRAGEDY
OF MELROSE
INVESTIGATED
Eye-Witnesses Tell What Led
to the Awful Act of Dong
Chang.
Would Have Left the Magazine Had He Been
Given an Opportunityâ His Promise
and Threat.
OAKLAND, Cal.. July 20.â Free |
from all the excitement that nat- j
urally follows a catastrophe such as the j
explosion of yesterday, and, of coursu, j
under oath, several of those conversant
with the details told their stories at the i
Coroner's Inquest to-night
The officials of the fuse works, espe
cially the secretary, gave interesting nar
ratives and with much detail told for tho
first time the conversation held with the
murderous Chinese by the boss of his
tong on the evening preceding the trag
edy. From his story it would appear that
all would have been well had the depu
ties kept outside the works, but othei
evidence made It clear that a minute bÂ»
fore the explosion the Chinaman had
agreed to surrender.
From the questions asked the witnesses
It was very evident that some of the Jur
ors thought the company was not suffi
ciently careful in its methods, and that
t^o much powder was stored in the maga-
Ktne for the safety of the neighborhood.
The first witness was Deputy Sheriff ai
V\"hito. who wont to the fuse works on
Monday afternoon as soon as it waÂ»
known that Gong Chung had attempted to
kill another Chinese.
"After mv arrival I talked with Mr.
Pringle. the superintendent," said the wit
ness, "and introduced him to my fathei.
DEPUTY SHERIFF ED WHITE, a Brother of
One of the Victims, Whose Escape From
Death Was a Miracle.
the Sheriff. At that time all I could see
jf the Chinese was his head through a
hole In the powder magazine. Mr. Prtn
rle said, to the best of my recollection,
is twenty tons of black powder In
the magazine.' My father said that It
there were that amount there It would be
useless to attempt to take him out by |
force. I talked with my father and we j
agreed that we should have to wait until
the Chinaman came out, or until he waa !
starved out. The owner of the wnrhu â¢
came up and passed Into the fence. Some '
soldiers were there, and Captain Baldwin, i
on my advice, did not permit them to gÂ«
In, as we saw the open door barricaded
with scores of kegs or powder. Mr. Pit
man asked the Chinaman to come out ,
and the reply was, "I come out in a couple i
of days, but not before.' A Chinese boss
came to the works and had a conversSa- j
tion with the man in the magazine and !
offered him a $10 bill.
"I then asked Mr. Pitman what would
be the result if the Chinese fired the pow
der, and he said It might blow off the
roof, but he did not think It would kill
anybody on the outside. We then with
drew some distance, hoping that the i
Chinaman would come out as the boss
had advised him to do. He did not como
out, and darkness settled down and we i
remained a little distance off until 10
o'clock. At that time I went out of the
yard and went to some boys who were :
there making a noise and they went j
away. We wanted to keep everything :
quiet, so that the Chinaman would think
we had all gone home. I remained there
till about 10 o'clock with Constable Koch, j
At that time my brother Ed and Mr.
Lerri arrived and a little later my broth- i
or Charles, George Woodsum and Fred
Sherrott. Mr. Cameron was also there. \
I explained to the newcomers what we ;
had done. Charlrs said: "Ed, If this
Is as dangerous as you say it Is, it will j
not be a very dangerous job to lose this ;
Chinaman.' and I said. 'Don't lose him
In any event,' I said to Charlie and George :
that they were married and they should
not take any risk, and Charlie said he
guessed he could go anywhere that I
could. We then exchanged rifles. I told j
Koch, who had elected to stay, that he i
was to see that no one attempted to take i
the Chinaman, but wait till he came out. j
"In the evening about 7 o'clock Chung I
asked for a drink and It was taken to him j
by a Chinaman. I refused to allow it to
be doped. Mr. Pitman drew the water >
from a faucet and a Chinaman took It to j
tfie magazine. Chung did not swallow a '
drop, but merely took It in his mouth and !
spat It out. After placing the men as best
I could I bade good-night to my brother i
and went home. '
Fred Sherrott, a route owner of The
Call, who went out at the Invitation of
Charlie White, was the next witness. He I
took up the thread of the narrative where
It was left off by Al White.
"We went at daybreak to have some
coffee at a house across the street," said ,
he. "After that I heard the Chinaman i
say to Charlie White. 'Well, I surrender.'
Charlie White said, 'All right, we won't
hurt you. The man you cut up yesterday-
Is not badly hurt and will recover.' 'All
light.' said the Chinaman. '1 come out.'
"'Ed White and I crept around the fence
to the railroad track ready to catch the
Chinaman if ho should get past Charlie
White. As we were going along the ex
plosion occurred and I was carried along '
with the force and thrown to the ground, j
1 have Bince been to the scene and find
that 1 was about 200 feet from the maga
zine at the time of the explosion. Just
before the explosion I saw Lerri near the i
d<">or of the magazine, and he might have I
fmÃhed It, but he could not have budged !
t because of the powder cans stored I
there. lT
Henry F. Prlngle, superintendent of
the fuse works, who has been twenty
years employel by the company, told of ;
the duties of the Chinaman, Chung.
"The Chinaman has been with us nine
years," said Mr. Pringle, "and was a
careful man. I heard two shots on Mon
day afternoon, and I found out that two
Chinese were fighting. I at once closed j
down the works. I then saw a Chinaman |
in the magazine and knew who it was by
hl.s voice. Mr. Pitman quickly came over
from San Francisco, und we went to talk
to the Chinaman. When about forty feet
from the door I spoke, and we asked him
to come out. He would not, and said,
'Two or three days," and we left him. Ah
Puck, the boss, came from San Francisco
and he talked in Chinese. Puck said the i
Chinaman would not come out, as he had '
no money. He said all the men in the ;
yard were making trouble, and all he |
wanted was a show to get over the !
fence, and he would not make trouble
for the works. Puck then went to tho
magazine and gave the Chinaman some i
money. He told us that it would be a i
good thing to let him alone, as Chung
would walk out before long. This was j
Puck's report, and it was told to Mr.
Pitman and also to the officers.
"I told the Sheriff I did not know what
would be the effect if the magazine ex- j
ploded. I do not know how much pow- j
der was in the magazine, but I think
there might have been 200 twenty-five- \
pound cans, but no more. It was all
black military powder, but there was no
dynamite."
Secretary Pitman told of the fight that
led up to the Chinaman taking refuge in
the magazine.
"I went to the works as soon as I
heard of the affair," he said, "and made
him all kinds of inducements to come out.
I went with Ah Puck to give him some
money, but the Chinaman in the maga
zine advised me that it was not healthy
for me to go too close, and I took his
advice and Ah Puck took the money.
Chung had stated that he would not come
out for three days, and if at the end of
that time he could not escape he would
commit suicide. He said that the depu
ties must all leave. I should have gfVen
him all the food and water he wanted
to get on the right side of him. I prom
ised him that if he would come out I
would get him a lawyer, would let him
keep his gun and he and I would get into
a buggy and drive off and I would help
him to defend himself against the depu
ties. He at first said he would agree to
this, but later he weakened. I had been
informed by Puck that he would be
turned over to the authorities five min
utes after he arrived in San Francisco.
1 tried to get near him. but when I did
bo he pointed a revolver at me and I
withdrew. He said that if any officer ap
proached him he would at once blow up
the magazine. We gave him to under
stand that he would be given a chance
to escape off our property at least.
"We parleyed through the Interpreter
for half an hour and then we all went
away. I pointed out to one of the depu
ties how the Chinaman would get over
the fence and then the deputies coulu
do as they pleased. This was the con
dition at 8 o clock when I left the scene.
The understanding was that our prem
ises were to be free of all deputies ex
cept one.
I do not know how much powder was
stored in the premises. We never bought
powder in car loads and never had more
than 500 kegs in the premises. It was all
black powder and if a spark reached it
It would at once explode. We were in
need of powder at the time, as our stocK
was low and a consignment was on the
track but not unloaded."
In answer to questions, Mr. Pitman
said he was convinced that the Chinaman
would have come out if given a chance
to escape, and that if any attempt wera
made to take him he would most cer
tainly fire the magazine.
Harry Wilson, who lived near the maga
zine, said he heard the Chinaman's voice,
saying to the deputies, "Go away; I see
you; I blow you all up." He was badly
cut up and was so nervous that he could
hardly control himself.
Juror Mack asked Mr. Pringle some
questions regarding the taking of stock
and the amount of powder used each
day, and stated that on the Ist of this
month there must have been over six tons
of powder on hand. With a discussion on
the methods of the company in allowing
the Chinaman to have free access to the
magazine, the evidence closed.
OAKLAND. July 20.â The jury was out
about half an hour, but could reach no
conclusion satisfactory to all. They de
cided It would be necessary to view the
scene and will go out to Sather to-morrow
morning.
FUNERAL PREPARATIONS.
Much Difficulty Experienced in Pos
itively Identifying Woodsum.
The scene of yesterday's explosion was
visited by thousands of people to-day
and many of these engaged In searching
for fragments of human bodies. Several
small portions of the victims were found
and all have been taken to the Morgue
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 21, 1898.
and, although it is positively known that
there were eight victims in all, nothing
has yet been learned regarding the Iden
tity of the one whose death is only
proven by the discovery of the right ear.
Some difficulty Is being experienced by
the relatives of George Woodsum and
Charles White, and also J. J. Lerrl. in
procuring enough evidence to positively
identify their remains sufficiently for the

IS LOCHNER
A STRANGLER?
Suspect in the Carpenter
Case a Bad Man.
MESHES CLOSING ABCUT HIM
MANY WITNESSES GIVE HIM AN
EVIL CHARACTER.
Police Are Inclined to Think They
Have at Last Caught the
Fiend of the
Alleys.
The police are working assiduously to
find the murderer of Mrs. Sadie Carpen
ter, who \v;u, strangled in room 10 of the
Hut.bard House last Sunday morning', but
nee sufficient to fasten the crime on
any individual has not as yet been discov
ered. Diligent searcn is b^ing made for
Henry Carpenter, the missing husband.
Several officers are endeavoring to get
some trace of him. but up to this time
their efforts have been futile.
That Joe Lochner, the man held under
suspicion of knowing something of the
tragedy, even if he is not the actual crim
inal, is a confirmed degenerate of the
worst type has been established. The po
lice have found several witnesses who will
testify to his evil character if such evi
dence is needed. It has also been ascer
tained that he is of a. violent disposition,
I ; tally when thwarted in his inclina
tions. A woman, whose name is withheld
by Captain Seymour, yesterday made a
Statement to the captain in the presence
o' Lochner in which she declared that he
had treated her With violence and that he
la feared and abhorred by all who know
him. ]x)chner was very much agitated
when confronted by the woman and she
accused him of violence. He trembled
tly tu:d could not sit still in his
chair.
Testimony of a r-imilar import was given
last evening by another woman who lives
in a Fourth street lodging house.
In both instance? Lochner was present
when the statements were made, and sub
sequently he admitted that they told the
truth.
Latp last night two experts on ir.sanity
carefully examined the suspect in the
City Prison. They questioned him closely,
and" when they had finished declared that
he was a man rnpabie of any crime.
He still protests his Innocence of the
murder of kin: r and reiterates
i that Carpenter is the guilty
man.
Captain Seymour is now inclined to be
lieve that Lochner is tho strangler, but
he wlii in t say so positively. Lochner's

Williams will be brought over from
Angel Isiand, where he is now stationed,
to-iiay. and asked what he knows about
Mrs. Carpenter. Williams is not suspect
ed o* the murder, but the police think he
may possibly give them a clew on which
to worK, as he is known to have visited
the woman.
Detectives have visited all the harness
ar.'"; saddlery supply houses in the city in
search of a line on Carpenter, but have
not found anything- which might lead to
his whereabouts. Some weeks ago he
bought a small bill ot poods of Johnson
& Co.. and paid for them, but had not
been heard of since.

not lie man who strangled Mr?. Carpen
ter. They say the asc Is the most diffi
cult the department has ever had to
handle. It is impossible â¢â  formulate any
theory as to the motive of the assassin.
He may have beer, a thief or he may have
been a. madman. If Loehner is the man
the question arises. What did he do with
the watch and money the woman is
known to have had? He left the room
when the clerk went after the officer and
then had an opportunity of hiding the
coin and watch. But his room and cloth
ing were searched and nothing incrimin

he reached the prison. Another strange

Our little daughter, now fifteen months old,

Her face, arms, hands, and neck would break

would swell and become terribly inflamed,
water would ooze out like great beads of per-

phase of the case is that the !
dead woman's eyes were closed when
the body was found, which is not usual
In cases of strangulation. Lochner has
identified the piece of cloth which was
around the woman's neck. It was torn
from a towel which she used in making
a poultice. He saw her tear the cloth and
put the smaller portion in the top of the
washstand drawer. This piece was found
knotted about her neck.
The suspected man seems to know every
detail of the tragedy except the identity ,
of the person who committed the murder.
These things, in the opinion of the detec
tive?, have a great significance.
If Carpenter could be found and he
could not give a satisfactory account of
his doings Saturday night Lochner would
be undoubtedly released and the husband
would take his place in the tanks. But
until something tangible is learned Loch
ner will be detained.
The Coroner has fixed next Monday at
9 a. m. as the date for holding the in- (
quest.
WEAVING A NET.
Police Believe That Lochner Is
the Strangler of Three
Women.
Is Lochner the man who strangled May
McDermott and Bertha Paradis, alias
French Bertha?
This Is the question that Is agitating
the police. The McDermott woman oc
cupied a den on Morton street before that
thoroughfare was ordered closed by the
Supervisors. Some time ago she was
found dead, having been strangled by an
unknown fiend. A few days later the
unfortunate French woman was murdered
in a similar manner. The latter occupied I
a den on St. Mary street, and as she was
preparing to go hume she was attacked ,
by the fiend, who promptly strangled her. >
As he was leaving the scene he was
seen by a friend of the dead woman, who
lives in the adjoining house. After the
murder was discovered the friend of the
dead woman visited police headquarters
and gave a description of the man she had
Been leaving the h^use. She described
him as being about 5 feet 7 inches in
height had a full beard and wore eye
glasses'. Ker description of the supposed
murderer tallied exactly with that of
Lochner. with the exception of a beard.
I' Is known that Lochner for several
years wore a beard, but for some unex
plained reason he had it shaved off a few
days before Mrs. Carpenter was mur
dered. . , .
Yesterday the prisoner was taken be
fore Captain Seymour and closely ques
tioned as to the murder of the French
woman. While admitting that he was a
frequent visitor to the tenderloin district,
he denied any complicity in the crime.
"I never harmed a woman in my life,
he excitediy declared, "i^ poor Sauie
(meaning Mrs. Carpenter) rt-as here she
would tell you I am Innocent of the crime
attributed "to me."
Notwithstanding Loehner's denial the
police are working en the theory that he
not only killed Mrs. Carpenter, but mur
dered both the French women and May
McDermott.
A citizen, whose name the police refuse
to divulge, yesterday visited the City
Prison, and at once recognized Lochner
as the man whom he had seen following
a little girl on Fourth street a short time
ago. After approaching her and beir.g
repulsed he continued to annoy her with
promises of candy, when the citizen, who
wa= a silent observer of his actions,
promptly knocked him down.
The police are now concentrating their
efforts in establishing the guilt or Loch-
ner.
Evidently satisfied that Mrs. Carpenter
did not commit suicide. Captain Seymour
and his men are striving to bring the
|-ime to his door. His actions in the ten
(Terloln district are being carefuity inves
tigated, and it is possinle, they think, that
he will be connected with the strangling
of May McDermott and the Paradis
woman.
The Victim's Funeral.
MOXTKRET, July 20.â The body of
SADIE FOSS TOOK POISON.
Her Young hjusband Deserted Y\er
for Cause.
Mrs. H. L. Foss, commonly known as "Sadie" Fops, -was found lying
among the sand dunes at the ocenn beach near the Seal Rock House yester
day morning In an unconscious condition. The soldiers and park laborers who
discovered her soon came M the conclusion that the woman had taken poi
son. She wrf removed to^he Seal Rock House and every car*- given her un-i
til the park ambuiar.ee arrived. Dr. Tormey, who went with the vehicle, con
cluded that the woman had taken arsenic and that her lease of life was very
short. Although it was only 10 o"clock and few persons on the beach, yet no
one saw her go to the place where she was found. The woman was taken to
the Park Emergency Hospital, but she did not recover consciousness, and late
In the afternoon she was sont to the City and County Hospital.
The only means of learning her identity wns nn envelope, on which was
written "To my husband. H. Foss, SOS Leavenworth street. City." Close to
where the envelope was found was a broken whisky bottle that smelt of liquor,
and It is supposed t;.nt Mrs. Posa mixed the poison with the whisky.
When the woman was found Professor Killlck, instructor of swimming
and life savin? at the Sutro Baths, was summoned, and worked upon the
unconscious woman for three-quarters of an hour until Dr. Tormey's arrival.
From all that can be learned Mrs. Foss has led an eventful life â of its
kind. When well along in middle life, for she is nearly 60 years of age now,
she married a boy, H. 1.. Fosp. Previous to her marriage she is said to have
been addicted to the use of opium and morphine, a habit that she was nÂ»ver
able to conquer. About four years ago her husband, who held a good position,
was arrested with the notorious Emerald smuggling gang of the old Custom
house ring. With the others he was convicted and sentenced to serve three
years in the State prison at San Quentin. During the time her husband was
In prison the wife was under less restraint than before, and although her par
ents in San Ramon Valley endeavored to keep her at their home she invari
ably returned to the city and sought bad company
A ehort time ago Foss was released, but his health was broken by his
long term In prison and he decided that the company of his aged wife would
not be any benefit to him and he left for parts unknown. Mrs. Foss has
made several efforts to see her husband, but failed, and It Is thought that her
mind *avo way and that uhe took tae poison to hasten the end

There is a row on at the Tivoli with dashing Edith Hall, Manager
Leahy, an iron-bound contract and a luscious pair of soubrette "props"
in the cast. Miss Hall and the manager play opposite parts, and their roles
tell quite as opposite stories.
Place aux dames!
Miss Hall claims she has a grievance. According to her story the man
agement has not lived up to the terms of her contract, and she is hurt in
spirit and most bitterly angered. The lady claims that in direct violation
of the terms upon which she was engaged she has been cast for parts not
in her line; that she has been sublet to another theatrical company, and
that she has been made to play at afternoon performances.
The little actress is riled, and, with the inconstancy of the soubrette,
in the same breath declares she "will bring suit" and "treat it with the
silent contempt of the righteous Indignant."
Said Miss Hail: "My contract calls for soubrette parts, and In direct
violation I was cast for the little insignificant part, known to artists as
â¢chorus parts.' In 'Fatinitza' they wanted me to double up as the cadet in
the second act. and a Pasha's wife in the first act, both chorus parts. In
justice to myself and my artistic reputation I had to refuse. So I was
out of the cast 'Fatinitza' week. That was not my fault. I reported every
evening, and Tuesday, when I came round for my salary, It was refused
me."
Mi=F Hnil di6cems method in this apparent madness of the Tivoli man
agement, and sees in it a game of freeze out. "The grand opera season
was coming on," she explained, "and so what were they going to do with
rce? Get me mad, so I would resign."
Miss Hall's greatest grie\-ance, however, is the fact that the Tivoli
management sublet her to "Uncle Tom." "On account of the two mat
ineesâand my contract says I was to play no matinees"â the lady said. "I
demanded and received $25 extra, making my week's salary $100 in all. But
the Tivoli management kept that extra $25, and I only got my $75. That is
what I call small."
Manager Leahy tells an entirely different story. "I want the lady to
sue." says the manager. "There is nothing I desire so much. I have legally
lived up to the terms of the contract. I had the right to play Miss Hall
as many times as I chose, and wherever I chose. Her demanding that ex
tra $25 was unprofessional, shamefully unprofessional, and I returned it to
Mr. Duffield.
"The whole trouble is that Miss Hall is a mischief-maker. She has
been insubordinate and was discharged for it. She was always late at re
hearsals, imperfect on her first nights, and clapped the climax by refus
ing the part the stage manager and musical director cast her for. Let her
sue. I wish she would."
And thus the matter rests, although Miss Hall has been In to Bee the
management, has used unprofessional language and Incidentally put up a
chubby fist while she held one arm on guard preparatory to attacking a
trusted attache In the manager's office.
Mr. Leahy has a clear case against the actress, "striving to intimidate
a witness"â the confidante was there as witnessâ but decides he was such
a success as a referee and peace mediator that he will let the matter go
at that.
Mrs. Sadie Carpenter, the woman mur
: dered in her room on Fourth street, San
1 Francisco, July 17, was brought here on
â¢ the noon train to-day and was taken at
; once to the Protestant Cemetery, where
it was buried. Mrs. Carpenter's mother,
Mrs. J. Q. Anderson, accompanied the
i body here and attended the funeral. Two
' children of the dead woman were al?o
: present. The funeral was quite large, the
services being conducted by the Rev. H.

DEATH OF A GREAT
TROTTING MARE
ETHEL DOWNS DROPPED DEAD
IN HER TRACKS.
The Gallant Mare, Holder of a Cali
fornia Record, Keeps Her Gait
to the Very End.
The well-known California bred trotting
mare, Ethel Downs. 2:10. died at the
Oakland track on Monday night. She
had been a frequent contestant at the
recent Breeders' meeting, winning her
first race this season there in I:l2ft.lower
tag the track trotting record on that oc
casion anJ apparently In the best of
fettle. After that, however, she seemed
to be weak at the end of her fast miles
and was beaten the two or three times
she raced. Her final appearance was the
closing day of the meeting, last Saturday,
in the free-for-all trot, when she made
the winner. Toggles, step in 2:13* 4 to se
cure first honors. The effort was too
much for her. and on reaching her stall
she dropped in her tracks and was un
conscious for some hours. C. F. Bunch,
th<- widely known San Jose reinsman, her
trainer and driver, called in several
veterinarians, but they held out no hopes
from the first, and the gallant little mare
finally expired as she lay on her side,
moving her fore legs as if she were trot
ting to the very end.
Ethel Downs was a black mare, 16
hand?, and the first progeny of the noted
siro Boodle. 2:12. She held the California
trotting record for marcs and had bright
prospects of adding to her reputation on
the track, besides a certainty from her
individuality and conformation of making
a great brood mare.
It is hard to estimate the financial l^ss
to her owner. Mr. Montgomery of San
Jose, in tht-s<- times when trotters are nut
salable save at practical nrices, but it
is not likely that be would have enter
taintd an offer of much less than jixWO.

MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES.
The Various Attractions Are Quite
Well Patronized.
The Alcazar is btill doing a big busi
ness with "Faust" and Morrison apjifnr?
to lose none of his old-time prestige,
notwithstanding the fact of his repeated
productions of the piece in this city, and
the second week of the present presenta
tion. Monday night Frederick Vroom.
the new leading man for the Alcazar, will
make his first appearance, supporting Mr.
Morrison in "East Lynne."
Tho Frawley company's present bill,
"Liberty Hall." is one that is attracting
no small attention. The performance of
R. C. Carton's comedy by this organiza
tion is one sure to win only the highest
praise for all concerned in the interpre
tation of the pretty love story. This
play will remain on the boards all this
week, including Saturday matinee.
The much-iorkeil-for production of the
new war drama. " A Gallant Surrender."
by the Frawley company is positively an
nounced t'r. r production next Monday
evening, and the public wil! then have
an opportunity of passing first judgment
upon the play which Edward E. Kidder
wrote specially for the company. "A
Gallant Surrender" has to do with inci
dents of the late war and its plot is said
to give opportunity for a strong cast and
excellent stage effects. The advance sale
01 .'-â¢â  fits is now 0:1.
"The Bells of Corneville" will be sung
this week only at the Tivoli Opera-house.
Its melodious numbers, excellent plot and
careful production have pleased all who
have seen it. For the next and last week
of the present comic opera season an
elaborate revival of Millocker's romantic
opera. "The Beggar Student," will be
given. On the same evening it is pre
sented here De Wolf Hopper will moke a
revival r.f this charming work at Man
hattan Peach. New York. Monday even
ing, August 1, the grand opera season will
commence. One of the special features
will be a regular Saturday matinee, es
pecially for ladies and the younger the
ater-goers. "Aida" ard "Lucta di Lara
mermoor" will alternate as the first
week's bills.
"Captain Impudence." at Morocco's, is
proving a very enjoyable attraction to
the many patrons of the house. Its mili
tary features and oddity account for Its
popularity.
At the Orpheum. notwithstanding the
extremely dull season, crowded houses
are the invariable rule. This may be ac
counted for by the fact that the bill is
varied and amusing.
Fine weather and an exceptionally good
programme have drawn quite satisfac
tory attendance to the Chutes during the
week. Herr Cannon continues to be the
king of heavyweights.

WAR TAXES
SHIRKED BY
WELLS-FARGO
Merchants Condemn
the Company.
SCORED BY ANGRY PATRONS
POINTED LETTER SENT TO
PRESIDENT VALENTINE.
District Attorney Foote Informed
That the Federal Law Is Now
Being Openly Vio
lated.
The Merchants' .Association, composed
of nearly a thousand business men and
firms, has come out in no uncertain terms
and made a protest | against the express
and transportation companies in general j
and Wells, Fargo & Co. In particular j
compelling- its patrons to pay the war i
revenue tax on all receipts and bills 01 ;
lading-. The law passed by Congress Tor
the purpose of raising funds to carry on j
the war with Spain, among other things, ;
provided that such companies must affix
a.l-cent stamp on all bills of lading and !
receipts. With a nerve, which in its au
dacity implied about the same as the re
mark of the late millionaire Vanderbilt
with reference to the. public, the wealthy ;
express corporation mentioned proceeded :
to ignore the law and made its patrons !
pay the tax which the Government In- j
tended it should pay.
Protests were raised agaiijat the injus
tice from all parts of the land, but in
stead of having the desired effect they i
only caused the express companies ail :
over the United States to draw closer to
gether and combine to defeat the law.
Such is the patriotism of wealthy cor- j
porations which have for years made for- !
tunes out of the Government whose trou- |
bles are now the means of putting thou- â â 
sands of dollars into the pockets of thÂ«
stockholders. When Wells. Fargo & Co.
began to pile on the additional charge
or 1 cent for every piece of paper In busi
ness transactions with its patrons tho
merchants of this city rebelled, but to
no purpose. If the extra 1 cent, that thÂ»
company should stand, was not paid tn e
patron nad but one thing to do, walk out. :
.Being unable to make a light against
so powerful a corporation single handed
the local merchants turned to the asso
ciation, one of the most conservative pub
lic bodies, for some relief. Since the tirsi
of the month the complaints have been
pouring Into the office from such mer
chants as Benjamin Newman, of .Newman
<fc Levinson; Frank Maskey; Mack & Co
wholesale druggists; J. C. Winans, of 22u
Front street; H. M. Heineman, of 109 San
some street; Joseph D. Grant, of Mur
phy. Grant & Co.; W. R. Sherwood, of'
Sherwood & Sherwood, and many others.
They assert that they have no objec
1 tions to assist In the payment of tneir
portion of the taxes, regular or extra, for '
the support of the Government in time:*
or peace and war, and they are doing
so, out they do not see why they should
pay others' taxes as well.
At the regular meeting of the Mer
chants' Association held yesterday the
subject was taken up and nandled with
out gloves. Director D. V. Kelly asserted
that there is no question as to the mean- â 
ing- and wording of the law, which de- i
clares that the. express companies shall
pay their proportion of the war tax, and
not the company's patrons. He said that
the members of the association should use
every effort to compel the transportation
companies to comply with the' law.
W. R. Sherwood, also a director, came
to the point and said: "The express com
panies should not shirk the obligation
imposed upon them by the new act. The
intention of those who framed the act
is so clear as to leave no room for
doubt." Director J. D. Murphy made a
few very pertinent remarks about the
patriotism of Wells, Fargo & Co., and
added that he believed that the associa- â 
tion should begin an action against this
company. It is not necessary that legal
proceedings should be begun just now,
because the Merchants' Association has
already begun action against this com
pany to compel it to stand its part of the
war tax by attaching the little one-cent
stamp to receipts and bills of lading free
of extra charge to the public. The New
York Association has gone into the fight
to win, and knowing that the contest
will be a bitter one, for the express com
pany is determined to shirk Its share of
the general responsibility. Joseph H.
Choate is recognized as one of the best
legal authorities in the United States,
and the New York merchants have en
gaped him to conduct their case.
Others spoke In the same line of argu
ment, and although Wells. Fargo & Co.
as a bank and as an express company is
a member of the association, the board
decided to send the following communica
tion to President Valentine of the com
pany mentioned, as well as to the repre
sentatives of any other companies that
are violating the law:
You will r.'.ease take notice that on behalf
of the memr*-i-Â«< of the Merchants' Association
the board of directors hereby protests and cb
jicts:
Firstâ To thÂ» issuance by you of any bill of
lading or other evidence of receipt an 1 forwarl
ir\K to which and to each dJ plicate thereof
there shall not have been duly attai.i-.d and
canceled ar. Internal revenue stamp of the
value of 1 cent.
Secondâ To any requirement on your part
that the shipper or consignor should. dtre'tiy
or indirectly, pay for such revenue Â«t>>_mri as a
condition of the acceptance of goods for trnnc
portation by you. We hereby furtner :i :t ,y
you that any payment, which may no.v or here
after be made by the shippers or consignor*,
directly or indirectly, for any such stamps tr
pursuant to such requirement. Is and will be
made under this protest, and the shippers 3r
consignors expressly reserve the ritciu to con
test the legality of such requlremeit and ac
tion on your part in such manner .is they ir.av
be advised.
Some consideration was given to the
matter of the association taking active
steps toward prosecuting Wells, Fargo & '
Co. for violating the law because of the
association in New York having the same
matter in hand, as shown by a communi
cation from that body. The letter stated
that legal proceedings had been begun
there to compel the express companies to i
comply v.'ith the war revenue law. That
I â  <ly had engaged J. H. Choate as spe- i
cial counsel to assist the regular counsel
of the association in this matter, and re
quests a contribution of $25 toward tjie ex
pense of the suit. The local boaru
ordered that amount to be at anco
forwarded to the Merchants' Association i
of New York for the purpose of '
testing the legality of the action of the
express companies.
The board also decided to send the fol
lowing communication to United States ;
District Attorney Footo: â¢
The beard of directors of the Merchants'
Association respectfully calls your attention to '
the clear violation of the provisions of the war
revenue lav.- of IS9S by certain express and i
transportation companies doing business in this i
city. We respectfully revest that you Insti
tute such prompt proceedings against said com
panies for the failure to comply with the war
revenue law as will brin? this matter to a
speedy determination. Please consider the offi
cers of this association at your service.
It is believed that District Attorney
Foote will advise that no action be taken
against the company here pending the de
cision of the courts of New York. How
ever, the letter will be sent to him so
as to give him an opportunity to show
how he stands on the matter.
