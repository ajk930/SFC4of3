AsK for Justice.
Generai Gcnge Replies to the Charge of Dis
honorable Action Made Against H im
by Colonel Picquart.
Special Dispatch to The C&JL
LONDON. Oct. 2S.â ln moderate circles, according to the Paris
correspondent of the Times, where a serious effort is being made
to discover the truth of the Dreyfus affair, the impression left by the
report of M. Bard, and by the bequislore (petitionary of M. Manau.
the procurateur general), is profound, painful and discouraging. The
correspondent of the Times continues: "The thought which weighs
like a pall on the country seems to be a reluctance to believe in the
complete innocence of Dreyfus, because such a belief would involve
such terrible censure of those responsible, knowingly or unknowing
ly, for his condemnation."
PARIS, Oct. 28.â At to-day's session
of the Court of Cassation in the Palace
of Justice, M. Bard, the reporter, con
cluded his report of the Dreyfus case,
the first part of which was presented
yesterday. He said this morning that
the court must make every investiga
tion necessary to enlighten It and to
place the whole truth in evidence. It
was for the court to decide what re
mained to be done. The task was a del
icate one, but that was no motive to
avoid it. He concluded: "You have
a great duty to fulfill. Do what your
conscience dictates."
M. Monaud, counsel for Madame
Dreyfus, charged that an investigation
be ordered concerning the divergency
of the testimony of the experts who
examined the bordereau in 1894 and in
1897, and also to ascertain whether or
not secret documents were communi
cated to the members of the court
martial.
The prosecutor, M. Manau, followed
M. Monaud. Discussing the case, he
said:
"Nobody can now take the Dreyfus
affair out of your hands, nor can you
reJinquish it without dereliction of
duty. Tour decisions must constitute
for everybody the expression of truth
and justice. Revise the trial then,
gentlemen, or at least prepare the road
for its revision."
M. Manau declared the court could j
not annul the sentence imposed upon j
Dreyfus without a retrial of the pris- |
oner. He added:
"You must fix the responsibility. If
Dreyfus is innocent, the culprit must
not go unpunished."
The public prosecutor, continuing,
proceeded to argue on the same lines
as M. Bard, the reporter of the case,
urging a revision of the trial and
dwelling upon the fallibility of the
writing experts. He also suggested
that Major Esterhazy should testify on
the subject of the bordereau, saying:
"He can admit its authorship with
impunity, since a court-martial has ac
quitted him of being the author of it.
But what a service he has rendered to
the country in confessing that he is it*
author and what a service he will ren
der the unhappy Dreyfus."
M. Manau concluded with denounc
ing the "villainous attacks upon the
partisans of revision," and made a
strong plea that the court be not influ
enced by outside pressure, but that it
decide in favor of a revision of the
case and the immediate provisional lib
eration of Dreyfus.
At this stage of the proceedings, M.
Bard read a letter from General Gonze
to the president of the Court of Cassa
tion, in which the general said: "I
have just heard of a memorandum in
troduced in court yesterday, in which
Picquart accused me of a dishonorable
action! I have never previously heard
of this memorandum, and I wish to
deny most formally Picquarfs allega
tions. I think my word is of greater
value than that of a man imprisoned
on the suspicion of forgery."
The reading of the last statement
ca'.led forth loud protests in court. The
reporter added that as Colonel Pic
quart's memorandum was publicly read
it was only justice to read General
Gonze's denial. The president of tha
court ordered that the general's letter
be added to the documents in the case,
and the court adjourned.
The court was less crowded than
yesterday, but the same stringent pre
cautions were taken. There was no
excitement outside the Palace of Jus
tice. Only a few people assembled
about the building and the streets in
the neighborhood presented their every,
day appearance.
The newspapers here are sharply di
vided into two camps, one of them
hiphly praising M. Bard's report to the
Court of Cassation as clearly setting
forth the truth and proving the inno
cence of Dreyfus, and the other insist
ing that the report was merely a plead
â¢ kig in favor of the prisoner.
ONE SIGNIFICANT
REVELATION MADE
PARIS. Oct. 28.â T0-day's proceed
ings at the Court of Cassation were de
void of sensation. The only emotion
caused ensued durng the reading of the
pathetic letters from Dreyfus. A sig
nificant point was the revelation of the
fact that General de Boisdeffre gave
orders, after the Dreyfus case was sup
posedly closed, for the dossier, contain
ing tile bordereaux, to be burned, and
expressed surprise to find that hiÂ« or
ders had not been executed.
Thus far the War Office has not been
represented and there is little hopÂ«
The San Francisco Call
of securing the dossier. M. Dupuy
was Premier during the Dreyfus trial,
and his appointment delights the anti-
Dreyfusites. It is asserted that the
father-in-law of Dreyfus has received
a letter from the prisoner in his own
handwriting. Formerly only copies of
his letters were transmitted, and the
new departure is regarded as a favor
able sign.
DUPUY WILL FORM
THE NEW CABINET
PARIS, Oct. 28.â M. Dupuy has se
cured the support of MM. Ribot, Del
Casse and Leygues, and has formally
informed President Faure that he is
prepared to form a Cabinet.
AMERICANS YET HOLD
UNDISPUTED POSSESSION
WASHINGTON, Oft. 28.â The Madrid
telegram printed in to-day's papers
stating that after the departure of the
Charleston from the Ladrones the
Spaniards lowered the American flag
and hoisted the Spanish, the islands
thereby reverting to Spain, is nonsense
and is so regarded in official circles
here.
A number of Government transports
have touched at Guam since then and
soldiers were left to garrison these
islands. The last vessel via Guam was
the Pennsylvania, which arrived in
San Francisco October 15. At that time
the Americans held undisputed posses
sion.
INFANTA MARIA TERESA
WILL SAIL ON SUNDAY
Special cable to The Call and the New York

CAIMANERA, Cuba, Oct. 28.â The
Infanta Maria Teresa will sail Sunday
morning. The Cincinnati, Leonidas and
Potomac will convoy her to Cape May.
All the holes have been patched and
the turret cables tightened. The star
board engine is in a satisfactory con
dition. Just three months ago to-day
the gunboat Sandoval was sunk by the
Spanish. She made a satisfactory trial
trip to-day and will be ready for ser
vice Monday.
PEACE COMMISSION
NEARING CONCLUSION
PARIS, Oct. 28.â The American
Peace Commissioners, at their sessions
to-day, drew up a memorandum on the
subject of the Philippines, which, it is
expected, they will place before the
Spanish Commissioners at the joint
session, which is to take place on Mon
day.
MADRID, Oct. 28.â 1t is rumored that
the Paris Peace Commission will ter
minate in four days. Sagasta said to
day on leaving the Palace that he
thought the work of the commission
would be finished next week.
DEATH AFTER
SIXTEEN YEARS
OF SLUMBER
Close of a Life That Furnished
a Great Scientific Problem
to Physioians.
NETW ORLEANS, Oct. 28. â
Miss Elmire Marie Charpentier,
the last sixteen years of whose
life have furnished a scientific
problem, is dead. When 9 years
old she began to sleep longer
than was normal, and at the
death of her little brother, to
whom she was passionately de
voted, her sleeping spells began
to be more prolonged. She was
IS years old at that time.
Then she had an attack of
fever and went into a trance
which lasted up to her death,
with intermissions of two hours
daily, when she was fed. During
these intermissions she was in
full possession of her faculties
and appreciated her condition.
Miss Charpentier was the
daughter of Abnolr S. Char
pentier of Lobit & Charpentier,
one of the wealthiest commission
houses in New Orleans in ante
bellum days. The war swept
away their fortune and her
father died. For three days be
fore her death Miss Charpentier
evinced no sign of her usual
waking. In sixteen years of her
trance she was awake 11,680
hours and unconscious 140,160
hours. She was conscious one
year and ten months out of six
teen years.

ENGLAND HAS NOT DECLABED A
PROTECTORATE OVER EGYPT.
But the Policy Is Maintained That
the Valley of the Nile Must
Be Egyptian Ter
ritory.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Oct. 28.â The morning
newspaper editorials regard Major
Marchand's movements from Fashoda
to Khartoum as indicative of a yield
ing on the specific question in contro
versy, although the position is official
ly unaltered.
It is assumed that he will push on
to Cairo, in order to be in direct com
munication with the French Govern
ment, and that on reaching there he
will represent to Paris the impossibil
ity of remaining at Fashoda under ex
isting conditions, and will ask author
ity to withdraw his entire force.
The Times says: "The desire as
cribed to France to raise a general dis
cussion ought to be in itself sufficient
answer to the ridiculous rumor circu
lated in ill-informed quarters yester
day (Friday) that we intended to play
into her hands by declaring a protec
torate over Egypt. Nothing could be
more unlikely at the present moment."
The Daily News takes it for granted
that Major Marchand will go to Paris.
The first Cabinet Minister to speak
publicly since the Cabinet Council on
Thursday is Lord Balfour of Burleigh,
Secretary for Scotland, who, when ad
dressing a meeting last evening at Cal
ashiels, Scotland, declared that it was
the settled policy of the Government
that the valley of the Nile must be
Egyptian territory.
Earl Spencer, First Lord of the Ad
miralty in Lord Rosebery's govern
ment, in a strong speech last night at
Greenock indorsed Lord Salisbury's at
titude toward the Egyptian question
and referred with the greatest satis
faction to a "prospect of an Anglo-
Saxon entente."
Baron de Courcel, French Embassa
dor, had another long interview with
the Foreign Office yesterday afternoon
with Sir Thomas Sanderson, Perma
nent Under Secretary of State for For
eign Affairs, and there is no doubt that
important matters were under discus*
slon.
The rumor was circulated on the
Paris boulevards yesterday that Major
Marchand would be recalled from Fa
shoda; but on neither side of tha chan
j neiâ certainly not on this sideâ is any
serious attention paid to the rumor
that England will declare a protector
ate over Egr>'pt.
The Paris correspondent of the
Standard says: "I have excellent au
thority for the assertion that Major
Marchand left Fashoda on his own ini
tiative, but that he will demand per
mission to withdraw the mission, since
his men are dying of hunger and dis
ease."
The special correspondent of the
Daily News at Omdurman telegraphs:
"I have reason to believe that Major
Marchand is waiting for instructions to
withdraw the French mission from Fa
shoda."
ENGLISH SUMMARY
OF THE SITUATION
LONDON, Oct. 28.â The Pan Mall
Gazette this afternoon summarizes the
result of the British Cabinet meeting
yesterday as follows:
"1. Marchand must be withdrawn un
conditionally and no undertaking or
promise can be given to discuss the
questions raised by FraAce in regard
to access to the Nile and such like.
"2. When Marchand is withdrawn it
will be determined whether or not the
questions raised admit of discussion,
and under what conditions discussion
can be proceeded with.
"3. Every possible racllity will be af
forded to assist in Marchand's with
drawal by which ever route is selected.
"4. If Marchand is not withdrawn
there will be no interference with his
remaining at Fashoda or with the date
fixed for his withdrawal. Necessarily
reinforcements will not be permitted to
reach him. He will be treated court
eously as a foreign visitor, and will be
regarded in no other light.
"5. Therefore it is left to France to
adopt any active measures to precipi
tate a conflict."
The Pall Mall Gazette adds that it
has good reason to believe that, while
Russia has counselled France to tide
over the difficulty and avoid war, she
has promised to throw her weight in
the scale at no distant date for the pur
pose of bringing the whole Egyptian
question and the British occupation of
Egypt to the front for settlement.
GREAT BRITAIN HAS NOT
DECLARED A PROTECTORATE
LONDON, Oct. 28.â There does not
seem to be the slightest ground for the
report of yesterday that the British
Cabinet had decided to declare a pro
tectorate of Great Britain over Egypt.
It was based solely on a London dis
patch to the Paris Soir. The papers
do not comment upon the statement
made, and the St. James Gazette alone
alludes to the subject, urging the Gov
ernment to adopt such a course.
MAJOR MARCHAND
RETURNING TO PARIS
CAIRO, Egynt. Oct. 28.â A boat re
cently dispatched to Fashoda has
reached Khartoum on its return jour
ney, and it is asserted that Major
Marchand is on board of her.
PARIS, Oct. 28.â The French Foreign
Office has received a dispatch from its
diplomatic agency at Cairo confirminK
the reported arrival of Major Marchand
at Khartoum.
It is added that the major deemed it
necessary to personally bring to Cairo
the unfinished portion of his report of
the explorations. Captain Gorman was
left in command of the French Mission
at Fashoda.
Killed by a Boiler Explosion.
LAKE LINDEN. Mich., Oct. 28.â A
boiler in the Calumet and Hecla boiler
house exploded at noon to-day, killing:
three men instantly and burning one
seriously.
NEGOTIATIONS
FOR PEACE ARE
PROGRESSING
Encouraging Reports
From Paris.
ADMINISTRATION HOPEFUL
THINKS THE TREATY WILL SOON
BE CONCLUDED.
The Philippine Question Not Beached,
but Will Probably Be Taken
Up Early Next
Week.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 28.â The Presi
dent was enabled to lay before the Cab
inet to-day very encouraging reports
frum Paris regarding the progress of
the peace negotiations. The adminis
tration now fully believes that the ne
gotiations will be concluded much
sooner than was expected from the out
look a few days ago. It can be stated
authoritatively that the commissioners
have not actually begun the discussion
of the Philippine question, and, further,
that it will not be taken. up until next
week. Since the Spaniards have found
that the American Commissioners mean
exactly what they say and that their
presentation of the side of the United
States is really an ultimatum, the use
lessness of prolonged debate, it is said,
has become apparent to the Spaniards,
and it is now believed the Philippine
discussion will be less protracted than
was reported some days ago. The re
cent action of the United States Gov
ernment intimating that the negotia
tions were proceeding much too slowly
has had its effect upon the Spanish
Commissioners, and they are not likely
to debate remaining propositions to the
length they did the settlement of the
Cuban debt.
The United States has not assumed
nor guaranteed the so-called municipal
debt of Cuba or Cuban municipalities,
but it is expected that such debts will
be paid by the municipalities incurring
them for by no reasoning could they be
charged upon Spain. Our Government,
it is said in official circles, would look
upon any attempt at evading the pay
ment of such debts as repudiation and
dishonesty, and whatever government
is established in Cuba will be expected
to see that these obligations are carried
out in good faith. Moreover, some of
the bonds of the Cuban municipalities
are held by citizens of the United
States and the United States might in
sist that the investments of her citi
zens in such securities are made good.
The State Department has no informa
tion as to the amount of these munici
pal liabilities.
Although the members of the Cabi
net are extremely reticent on the sub
ject of the acquisition of the Philip
pines there is now little or no doubt
that nothing less than the cession of
the entire group of islands will be ac
cepted by the American commissioners.
Secretary Wilson brought up at the
Cabinet session the fact that Blanco is
still charging $10 a hundred for beef
cattle going into Cubai. ports controlled
by the Spaniards, while the United
States is admitting beef cattle free of
duty to ports controlled by American
officials. The Cabinet concluded that
it has no power at present to change
this state of affairs, and that Blanco
must bear the responsibility. As soon
as the United States takes possession
of the various ports, however, this will
be changed. Some of the ports near
Havana will be opened to the free entry
of beef cattle and other things and that
will result in benefit to Havana.
PARIS PAPERS ON THE
PHILIPPINE QUESTION
i PARIS, Oct. 28.â La Volente, discuss
ing the Philippine question to-day,
says: "The Americans could well make
concessions to compensate for their
rigor on the Cuban question."
Quoting the Philippine article of the
protoco-1 the paper says: "The word
ing is vague and forecasts the Spanish
contention relative to the meaning of
the words 'control' and 'disposition.'
"Spain," La Volente concludes, "is
minus money and a fleet to re-establish
order and it would be more prudent to
allow the Americans to do so, Spain
claiming a money indemnity in ex
change for her sovereignty over the
archipelago, which it would be diffi
cult for the Americans to refuse."
The Gaulois takes the view that the
Cuban question was not settled by it
self and that by counter concessions on
the Philippine question an arrangement
mutually satisfactory will be reached.
But in the meanwhile, the Gaulois adds,
no decision is possible before the elec
tions, which is according to the desire
of the American commission.

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
BUCK DEATH
REACHES THE
GOLDEN CATE
Duchesse Anne
an Infected
Ship.
HER CREW REDUCED BY TWO
THE BUBONIC PLAGUE SMOTE
THEM ON THE HIGH SEAS.
Ship Placed in Quarantine â History
of the Dread Disease Now Ter
rorizing All of Southern
Europa.
Last evening:, when the French bark
Duchesse Anne, hailing from Hong
kong, passed in through the Golden
Gate she halted in the stream' but
a few minutes, then turned her
prow toward Angel Island and went
into quarantine at the Government sta
tion. It will be weeks before her crew
or cargo will be allowed to land, for
the ship is unclean; from her decks not
long over a month ago two bodies were
cast into the seaâ two bodies blackened
and distorted by the ravages of the
bubonic plague, "the black death."
A note handed by the ship's captain
to the health officer told in simple lan
guage how "the black death" had vis
ited his vessel and reduced her crew
by two when far from aid out on the
high seas. It read:
"August 20 CAPTAIN JOS CER
VANY, aged 31 years, a native of
France, died of bubonic plague and wag
buried at sea.
"September 19 ANGIE MENIER,
aged 50 years, a native of France, died
of the same disease and was buried at
sea,"
This was the simple story, but It car
ried with it terror to the heart of the
health officer. If the dread disease
stretched out and with its grasp of
death laid hand on the people of this
land who knew what might be the end?
So auCTibf wSs weighed and the in
fected ship sailed into quarantine,
where she will remain until the living
germs of death wither in the fumes
that will penetrate every nook and
crevice of hold and cabin.
Europe is now terror stricken at the
alarming -advances of this dread dis
ease. In the temperate climes' of Italy
and Austria it has been stalking
through the land, leaving in its path
scores of blackened victims. But few
live to tell of the pain and dread that
seizes its victims after it has once laid
hold. The disease in itself is a ma
lignant and fatal contagious fever. In
early ages it raged throughout Egypt
and the Levant and spread its devas
tating epidemics throughout almost the
whole of Europe. So fearful are its
ravages that it has teen an obstacle to
the growth of countries and has time
and again turned back the tide of civil
ization. It first appeared in Constan
tinople in A. D. 544, and when the peo
ple of that land looked upon its results
and upon the bodies of its victims they
named it "the pest," "the black death"
and "the great mortality." From that
date the germs of the disease seemed
to have taken a firm hold upon thÂ»
country and many < pidemics have
taken place since then, forty-five hav
ing occurred in the seventeenth cen
tury.
Twenty-five millions of people, it is
estimated, have fallen under the blow
of "the black death," the majority' of
whom were counted among the dead
during the existence of less than a
dozen epidemics â those which occurred
at London in 1665, Copenhagen in 1712,
Marseilles in 1720, Moscow in 1771,
Malta in 1813, Selecia in 1819, Bulgaria
in 1828-29, Egypt in 1844, among the
Arabs of North Africa in 1857, Mesopo
tamia in 1857, and in Persian Kurdistan
in 1871.
The plague is now looked -upon aa a
zymotic disease, dependent upon poi
sonous atmospheric conditions. The
germs of the plague gain access to the
blood, rapidly multiply and destroy its
nutritive elements. In malignity and
nature it is not unlike tynhus fever. Its
propagation is said to occur by direct
or indirect contagion, and is greatly
assisted by overcrowding, uncleanliness
and residence in damp, marshy coun
tries.
After exposure to the disease there is
a latency of from two to seven days,
then four stages of the disease follow
in rapid succession. As termed by the
scientists who have made laborious in
vestigations, the first stage is called
invasion, the second fever, the third
local phlegmons, and last collapse or
convalescence. Lassitude and en
feeblement of mind and body are
precedent symptoms; shivering, head
ache, vertigo, vomiting, hifh fever,
great prostration and sometimes un
consciousness, tell of its definite onset.
Enlargement of lymphatic glands and
carbuncles mark the advance of the
disease, and then, in the fatal cases,
and they are in the large majority,
purple spots and black discolorations
mottle the skin. Hemorrhage into the
lungs and from the lungs is another
complication and was a frequent
symptom of "the black death" in the
Middle Ages. William Pe^ier states
that "Its duration is from two to ten
days and convalescence is slow. It is
prevented by hygienic measures and
public quarantine, but its treatment,
beyond general measures of stimulation ,
and nutritive support, avails little."
Such is the history of "the black
death." A ship infected with its germ
of death has reached our shores, but
the prompt measures of the health au
thorities will stamp it out and turn
away the danger of Its dread results.2

CHATTANOOGA, Term., Oct. 2S.â
The war investigating; commission
Spent the entire day inspecting the site
of Camp Thomas in Chickamauga Park
under the guidance of General Boynton,
General A. P. Stewart, a member of
the CMckamauga Park Commission,
and Mr. E. E. Betts, the engineer of
the committee. The inspection began at
Lytle station and covered all points of
interest in the park and near its bor
ders which have been in any way in
1 in the controversy concerning
the sanitation of the camp, including
berg and Leiter hospitals; the
various springs from which water was
obtained by the troops, including the
famous Crawfish Springs and the point
on Chickamauga Creek at which the
â water of the pipe line supply was taken
out.
Especial attention was given to this
latter place, because of criticisms which
have been made upon this source of the
camp's water supply. They found the
intake pipe submerged about twenty
feet above the m<juth of a tributary
creek locally known as Cave Spring
Creek, which drained the camp. The
charge had been made that the water
the tributary stream had con
taminated the camp's water, being
carried back into it by means of eddies,
and, in one case, by an overflow after a
freshet.
neral Boynton and Mr. Betts, who
had both been concerned in the loca
tion of the pipe line, admitted that
there had been an occasion when Cave
g had overflowed, thus throwing
its water into the main stream. The
I had occurred at night when
the pumps were shut down and no
water was being taken in. They call
ed attention to the depth of the stream
end urged the impossibility of infection
from this stream.
General Wilson gave especial atten
tion to the question as an engineer
ing problem, and while he refused to
himself to be quoted, it was evi
dent from the interest he manifested
and the expressions he dropped that he
was i 1 with the striking im
probability, if not the impossibility, of
infection from this source. It was also
equally evident that a majority of the
committee formed the same opinion.
There were many expressions of com
mendation of the methods- followed at
Steinberg Hospital, and General Dodge
was heard to remark that it was a
pity to have to leave any situation so
well equipped. All patients were housed
in wooden houses. Major Griffin, in
command of the hospitals, said it would
Boon be abandon â â <].
The committee save attention to the |
proximity: of thÂ« various camps to one i
another and the depth and localities of i
the sinks. The conclusion seemed quite :
general that many camps were too {
close together and that this fault could ;
have been avoided by moving, as there !
was in the opinion of at least Borne of]
tnmittee, sufficient space that was
not occupied for the accommodation of
many thousands more of troops. Many
of the sinks were found to have been ;
nearer the tents than proper ideas of |
sanitation encourage and in &onie cases j
the character of the surface was found
to be such as to warrant the conviction |
that the sinks were shallower than they i
should have been, but this war. true i
only of parts of the camp.
After concluding the inspects n of.
the camp Major Griffin, who had
before the commission before, was ask
ed to make a statement concerning I
some criticisms of the hospitals, made '
in a Vermont newspaper by Frank A.
Bailey, who had spent six weeks in the
nursing his brother. When
he returned home he wrote an article ;
sayine, among other things, that he
had heard physicians tell attendants to j
give their attention to patients who j
had a chance to recover and not to \
nurse those who were sure to die. These j
instructions were given, he said, in the i
nee of those designated as of the
latter class, and he had heard other
physicians instruct their helpers 10 j
give ice cold baths with the view of
"finishing their patients."
Dr. Giffin pronounced as false all this ;
Dr. Charles F. Craig, bacteriologist
of the Sternberg Hospital, was also ex
amined. He was questioned especially
with reference to the water supply of
the camp, and he expressed the opinion j
that the water taken from the Chlcka
mauga River through the pipe system
was purer than that in the wells and
springs of the grounds. He said he
had round some sewer bacilli in one
or two of the wells, though no typhoid
germs. He had also found impurities j
in water taken from some of the
springs. He had made two analyses of
Che water from the river, one before the
July freshet and the other after it. and
had found it to be entirely wholesome j
from a bacteriological standpoint. It
was muddy and he thought it should be
filleted: He had also made tests which |
convinced him that there was no dun- :
per- of eddies carrying the water of the
Cave Spring Creek into the pipes.
Dr, Craig expressed the opinion that
common housefiies are capable of prov

ASKS PERMISSION
TO RAISE THE MAINE
A San Francisco Company Applies to
the Navy Depai-cment for Au
thority to Proceed.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 2S.â The Acme
Wrecking Company of San Francisco has
made a request upon the Navy Depart
ment for authority to raise the battle
ship Maine. The company has had ex
nee in raising vessels on the Pacific
Coast, and representations have been
made to the department as to its ability
to accomplish the task in Havana har
bor. The company simply asks authority
to raise th.- Maine and bring her to this
country. If the Government wants the
ship after she reaches the United Stated
the company will want to be paid sal
vage money through condemnation pro

RESTRAINT OF
TRADE ILLEGAL
Trans-Missouri Decision
Clinched.
| RULING OF SUPREME COURT
JOINT TRAFFIC CASE DEFINITE
LY SETTLES ALL POOLING.
Opinion of Solicitor General Richards
on the Result of the Decision
Just Handed
Down.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 28.â Solicitor
j General John K. Richards, who had
j charge of the Government's side of the
I Joint Traffic Association case before the
: Supreme Court of the United States,
and whose brilliant argument, occupy
ing two days, has been the subject of
much favorable comment by members
of the Supreme Court bench and bar,
', was questioned to-day, after he had an
i opportunity to read its full text, as to
the effect of last Monday's decision on
the railroad interests of the country.
Mr. Richards said: "The Sherman
anti- trust act declares illegal 'every
contract, combination in the form of
trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in re
straint of trade or commerce among
; the several States.' The joint traffic
; case clinches the decision in the trans-
Missouri case, holding that the law ap
plies to railroads and prohibits all
agreements in restraint of interstate
trade and commerce, whether the re
straint be reasonable; in addition, it
j holds explicitly that the law is consti
tutional when thus applied, even to
reasonable agreements in restraint of
trade.
"The constitutionality of the act was
not raised in the trans-Missouri case,
but in the joint traffic case. Mr.
Pheips directed his entire argument to
this point, urging that Congress could
; not declare illegal and prohibit reason
i able contracts. The freedom of con
tract guaranteed by the constitution
forbade it, he insisted. The answer of
the court to this was that railroads en
joy public franchises, they perform
public services and when engaged in
interstate commerce are subject to the
regulations of Congress.
"What the ultimate result of the de
cision will be it is impossible to say.
Cases which establish important prln
< [pies usually affect, not simply courts,
but Legislatures, in a way one cannot
foresee. It is gratifying to believe that
the sentiment of the people against in
jurious monopolies can find legitimate
expression through laws passed by their
representatives as enforced by the
court. I know it has been and is in
sisted that competition destroys rates,
and railroads, too, but nevertheless
there is a settled sentiment among the
people against railroad monopolies and
in favor of unrestrained competition.
.Most of the States, some in their con
stitutions and some in their laws, have
prohibited the consolidation of compet
ing lines. Congress' interstate ant pro
hibited pooling, which is simply one
mode of preventing combinations to
keep up rates.
"There are men of thought who insist
that regulation should supplant compe
tition, but the people do not think so
yet. In fact, competition is the recog
nized underlying basis of social and in
dustrial and political life in this coun
try. Competition goes along with free
dom, with independent action. The
country was founded* on the principles
of liberty and equality. Its founders
sought to secure to every citizen an
equal chance under the law â a fair
showing in the race. of life.
"Under this decision, It is left to
open competition to secure reasonable
ness in rates. It is true the common law
requires that rates shall be reasonable.
So does the interstate commerce law.
But this is a mere declaration, and
there is no adequate remedy to enforce
the barren right. Congress has not
given the Interstate Commerce Com
mission power over rates. It has relied
upon competition to keep them fair.
Whether Congress will see fit to take
the railroads out of the operation of the
natural law of trade, and for independ
ent competition substitute govern
mental regulation, remains to be seen."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKER CITY, Or., Oct. 28.â A tele
phone message from Canyon City
states that Columbia Joe and nine war
riors came into Prairie City to-day and
informed the citizens that there would
be no further bloodshed. Great ex
citement prevails and the settlers fear
further trouble, as the number of bad
Indians is increasing and they are well
armed.
Settlers to-day telephoned to Baker
City for a large number of rifles and
ammunition. They say they are able
to take care of themselves and will
easily subdue the Indians upon the ar
rival of the firearms. Cutting was
buried at Canyon City this afternoon.
Dr. Ashford of Canyon City respond
ed to a summons from Cummlngs
Creek, the scene of yesterday's battle
between whites and Indians, in which
George Cutting was killed. Three of
the wounded will die, making a total of
seven killed since the trouble began.
Late advices show that a party of
Indians, supposed to be Columbias,
camped on the right fork of the John
Day River, near Izee, lost two of their
horses. They accused a rancher of
stealing them and demanded that he
give them up. On his denial of any
knowledge of the horses, the Indians
proceeded to enter his barn to see if
the horses were there. The rancher
opened fire on the Indians, but ;
to hit them. They at once left and re
turned to their camp. Last Tuesday
John Hide, while riding on the range,
was shot at by the Indians. Wednes
day a posse of citizens numbering
about twenty started out to find the
Indians and came on them about five
miles from Izee, which is about fifty
five miles from Canyon City. A fight
took place, in which one Indian and a
white man named George Cutting were
killed. The fight became too warm for
the Indians and they struck into the
mountains. Part of the posse fol
lowed them and yesterday had a fight
with them, in which five Indians were
killed.
DANGER OF INDIAN
OUTBREAK IS PAST
Nye County Settlers Do Not Fear an
Uprising of the
Shoshunes.
CARSON CITY, Oct. 28.â The silence re
g-arding the trouble between the Sho
shones and the white settlers of Nye
County was broken by the receipt of a
special to the Carson AVeekly stating that
the men who went from Austin to aid the
Nye County ranchers had returned, and
had no further apprehension of trouble.
The barricade around McLeod's house
has been taken away, but fifty mounted
extra police patrol the neighborhood. The
deputy Sheriff "f Midas and the people
on the Upper Reese River still fear the
Indians may do mischief, but it is be
lieved the armed police will be able to
quell any disturbance.
T-.e Piutes in this vicinity have been In
formed of the threatened outbreak, the
news of which was brought here by Deer
foot Jim, a Shoshone scout, who claims
to have covered the distance on foot,
about l! 10 miles, in ninety hours. When
interviewed Deerfoot told the cause of
the trouble, through an Interpreter, as
follows:
"Ballard. a drunken Indian, and a white
man named McLeod, took a load of hay
to Midas from Reese River. On the way
home a bottle of whisky which Ballard
carried in his pocket broke, und in the
quarrel which ensued <>n the seat the
Indian cut McLeod about the head and
face with a knife. Later, when both en
deavored to settle the difficulty, upon
alighting from the wagon, MoLeod kicked
the Indian about the face and head. The
Indian was taken to Midas and placed in
Jail in a dying condition. His people are
greatly inflamed against McLeod, and
Ballard's brothers threaten to kill him on
sight."
Deerfoot added that if Ballard should
die McLeod would not be the only white
who would suffer for It.

CUBANS LOTH TO
RETURN TO WORK
Still Striving to Main
tain Their Army.
GEN. WOOD AT MANZANILLO
FRICTION INCREASES BETWEEN
GOMEZ AND GARCIA.
Lieutenant Young of the Navy En
thusiastically Received on His
Return to the Scene of
His Big Fight.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANZANILLO, Oct. 28.â The United
States gunboat Hist arrived here to
night with General Leonard Wood,
commander of the military department
of Santiago, accompanied by Lieuten
ent Matthew Ham. On landing. Gen
eral Wood was closeted with Colonel
Pettit and his adjutant and he was
subsequently received by Colonel Pet
tit's entire regiment. General Wood
then visited the barracks, hospitals,
palaces, custom house and postoffice.
Colonel Fettit reports that the Cuban
general, Rios, is apparently making
every effort to prevent the disbanding
of his troops. The Cuban commander
wishes all the sugar estates in the
neighborhood to tell him how many men
they can employ and he will guarantee
to supply all that are required. The
planters unanimously refuse to fall In
with such an arrangement, considering
that it would be a trades union of the
worst possible kind and would tend to
keep up the Cuban military organiza
tion, which in the interests of the isl
ands, the planters are very anxious to
break up. In their opinion it would be
better to have no commerce than to at
tempt it on such conditions.
There is no sickness in Colonel Pet
tit's regiment and yellow fever has
been unknown here for several years.
Lieutenant Lucien Young, the com
mander of the Hist, created more ex
citement on landing than even General
Wood himself. Crowds gathered at the
wharf to see the young commander
who, with Lieutenants Holm and Jun
gen, of the Hornet and Wampatuck, de
feated a whole flotilla of Spanish gun
boats at Manzanillo on July 1, last. The
people of Manzanillo considered Lieu
tenant Young a hero and a terror and
think he ought to be an admiral.
Although the Spanish battery in that
memorable engagement continued to
bombard the American gunboats, it is
generally admitted here that it was the
shooting of the Hist that caused people
to flee to the mountains.
Lieutenant Victor Blue, who has been
Inspecting the wrecks of the Spanish
gunboats, considers it quite impractica
ble to raise them, but he believes that
the Spanish steamer Purissima Concep
clon, which the Spaniards ran ashore In
the hope of saving her cargo when pur
sued by an American warship, can be
raised, as she appears to be in good
condition. A local merchant, however,
claims to have purchased the hull and
its contents from the Spanish authori
ties.
The Cuban general, Jesus Rabi, paid
a visit to Manzanillo yesterday and
was enthusiastically received by the
Cuban element.
According to reports of the Cuban
Assembly at Santa Cruz del Sur, Gen
eral Garcia has been chosen permanent
chairman of the organization. General
Gomez is expected there to-morrow or
next day, and it appears that the Ces
pedes faction believes it can count upon
the help of General Gomez to break the
authority of Garcia. The Cespedes fac
tion expects Gomez to appoint a court
martial to try Garcia for offenses cov
ering practically everything from mur
der to petty larceny. The probability
Is that Gomez, recognizing Garcia's
ascendency in the Assembly, will not
force the Issue.

WITH SONG AND ORATORY
CLOSING EXERCISES OF PHILA
DELPHIA'S PEACE JUBILEE.
Third of the Great Street Pageants
Given Over to the Trades, Which
Make a Grand Civic
Display.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 28.âPhiladel
phians and their visitors again poured
into the streets to-day to seek positions
to witness the third and last of the
great Peace Jubilee processions. To
day's procession was purely of a civic
character, and was a most fitting wind
up of the week's jubilee, the emblems of
peaceful industry following the display
of the nation's prowess in war.
The exercises of the day opened with
the rededication of old Independence
Hall, the historic building from which
the Declaration of Independence was
read to the oeople of the new Republic
on July 4, 1776. The buildings which had
from time to time since that date been
added for use as offices of the munici
pal authorities have all been recently
removed, and the famous hall is now In
its original form, as it was 120 years
ago, when occupied by the United
States Congress and the national Gov
ernment officials.
The redeication exerciseÃ were pre
sided over by Governor Hastings and
were opened with prayer by Rev. Dr.
Brownson. The anthem, "My Country,
"Tis of Thee," was sung by 3000 pupils of
the public schools, accompanied by the
First Regiment Band. The memorial
poem, composed by Mrs. Florence Earle
Coates, dedicated to the Peace Jubilee,
was read by Daniel W. Hutchins, prin
cipal of one of the public schools.
The anthem "Columbia" was sung by
the pupils and then followed the ora
tion by Mayor Charles Warwick.
Upon the conclusion of the ceremonies
the great audience hurried to positiops
from which to see the monster procps
sion. A stand covered the sidewalk in
front of Â«the historic hall, erected for
occupancy during the parade by the
3000 school children who had partici

social Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Oct. 28. â Sonoma
County is ablaze wjÂ£h enthusiasm for
Gage and Neff. The record o-f political
demonstrations in this valley has been
broken by the magnitude of the popu
lar uprisings to-day and to-night.
Everywhere Henry T. Gage is recog
nized a* i he champion of the people,
the defender of their homes. In his
leadership in the cause of the people
against the allied single-taxers, an
archists and treasury raiders he com
mands the admiration of the masses.
The farmers, the business men, the me
chanics and all others of the industrial
Sonoma County are weary of
the isms and schemes of the piace
hunters and job-chasers who have ral
lied under the banner of "Little Giant"
JUaguire.
At 7 o'clock this morning Mr. Gage
and the brilliant exponent of Republi
â¢ can principles, George A. Knight,
boarded the train at .Xapa for Santa
Rosa. The short trip through the pic
turesque and fertile country brought
the speakers to Santa Rosa, where they
were received and cordially welcomed
by L. V. Hitchcock, chairman of the
Republican County Central Committee
Congressman J. A. Barham, W. F.
Price, A. B. Lemraori, J. F. Smith, P.
Bane and W. J. Kardley.
Carriages conveyed the party to the
1-tepubiican headquarters, where the
County Committee was in session. Mr.
Gage and Mr. Knight were greeted with
entnusi&stie cheers by the committee
men. The next Governor, passing the
hall where the ladies of tit. Rose's
Church were conducting a fair, went in
â¢aim met many ct the promoters of the
lair. From this point the standard
bearer and his speaking companion
went to the Occidental Ho-tel, where
lunyheon was served and a little rest
uiifeii before starting for Petaiuma,
he standard- bearer and Mr. Knight,
under the escort of JLyman Green,
prescient of the Petaiuma AlcKinley
Club, boarded the south-bound train
ana arrived at Petaiuma at 4:15 p. m.
When they reached their destination a
vast throng at the depot cheered for
Gage, Men: and Knight. An artillery
salute \\ as Jired to herald the event.
'I'he Petal uxna band discoursed patri
vtio music; a procession was formed
and ' the distinguished campaigners
wove escorted tv the opera house.
Ihe house Vi us. soon crowded to its
utmost capacity. When the next Gov
ernor, accompanied by Lyman Green,
li. P. Brainard, F. A. Wickersham,
Thomas Denny and J. F. Fairbanks,
ascended the steps to the stage the
people gave vent to their feelings with
rousing cheers. .Little time was lost in
preliminaries. Chairman Thomas Denny
presented Mi. Gage as the next Gov
ernor of California and again the build
ing trembled with the applause for the
champion of the people. The high char
acter of the assemblage at once com
manded the attention of the speaker. ,
In the intelligent countenances of the i
men and women assembled cc-uld be i
read the feeling of profound interest
which the campaign against the dan
gerous single tux has aroused.
Mr. Gage spoke of the arduous duties
of the campaign. The promptings of j
his heart reminded him that the magni
ficent ovation accorded to him by the i
people of Petaiuma deserved a better
respu-nse than he could utter. Refer
ring to his travels through the State
and the succession of boundless ova- j
tions in honor of the party of which
he was an humble representative he
predicted that the Republican party on j
the Bth of November would gain the ;
grandest victory ever recorded in Cali
fornia. The standard-bearer proceeded ;
to pierce the fallacies of the fusion j
platform and presented to the assem- â 
bled farmers and merchants the spec- j
tacle of the odious single tax. Intense ;
interest was manifested by the people j
and cheering applause signified to the |
standard-bearer that his points were â¢
clearly understood and appreciated.
Mr. Gage did not talk at great length,
but he took the opportunity to present
Maguire's un-American record in its j
true light. In conclusion he promised |
to give the people of California a clean ;
and honest administration.
George A. Knight's introduction was
the signal for another storm of ap- ',
plause. The brilliant exponent of Re- j
publican principles spoke with his usual j
fervor and eloquence, and the audience j
was edified and inspired. He did not \
use unmeaning phrases in referring to
the "Little 'Want's" public career, and |
particularly his career in Congress. The
"Giant's" refusals to vote .supplies and
sustenance for the gallant California
soldiers who received the cheers and
tears of loyal citizens on their depar- \
ture for Manila to uphold the flag and
maintain the sacrt-d honor of their be- !
loved country was touched upon. Ma- ;
quire's unpatriotic attitude in haggling ;
over details when the men carrying the i
flag needed immediate support was de- j
picted, and not a few rru-n left the hall i
ashamed that they ever had thought uf i
supporting Magulre fur Governor of |
California.
The Petaluma meeting, one of the
largest and most enthusiastic ever hÂ»-ld
in the place, dissolved with repeated
cheers for Gage and Neff.
Returning from Petaluma. the stand
ard bearer and George A. Knight ar
rived at the Santa Rosa depot at 7 30
o'clock. There they were met by a
groat concourse of people. Music, rock
ets, redfire and artillery salutes added
to the effect of the reception.
Santa Rosa was crowded to-night
with cheering Republicans of the re
nowned valley. A special train from
Tkiah with the I'kiah band reinforced !
the multitude. Guerneville Republicans !
came on a special train bringing with
them their band of music. Healdsburg ''<
Republicans, 300 strong, swelled the i
throng. Confident and cheering Re- j
publicans came from Cloverdale, Gey
serville. Windsor and many other !
towns of the valley. Never in the his
tory of this city have the scenes of en- ;
thusinsm witnessed to-night been sur- j
passed. Thousands of spectators view- j
ed the marching columns of Republi
cans and cheered the clubs, and ap
plauded the campaign sentiments in- |
Btyibed on the transparencies.
The spacious Athenaeum, capable of
accommodating with seats and stand- i
Ing room nearly 3000 people, was dense- |
Jy packed before 8 o'clock. The au
dience was of a character to inspire
orators to their hiehest efforts. The
interior of the beautiful Athenaeum
was decorated in superb taste. For
this artistic display of plants, flags,
evergreens and streamers in effective
and harmonious style credit is. largely
due to Mrs. Bonner and her assistants.
An illuminated flag displaying thÂ«.
name of the Republican standard
bearer was a feature of the stage effect.
The electric lightfc were turned on when
Mr. Gage was introduced to the au
dience.
The enthusiasm of the vast audience
was boundless. It culminated in a mag
n i t nt P atrlotl c demonstration when
the band played "The Star-spangled
-Banner," and every person in the as
sembly arose and hundreds joined in
singing. A choir accompaniedfiy Mrs.
lierry sang "The Red, White and Blue."
A sextet composed of \V. Edward
Woodard, R. N. Thompson, Olney G.
Pedigo, Leroy Smith, F. P. Brophy and
v llliam G. Keenan contributed to the
pleasure of the audience.
Many eminent and active men rep
resenting the various precincts of So
noma County were chosen as vice pres
idents and occupied places on the plat
form.
The meeting was called to order by L.
V. Hitchcock, chairman of the Republi
can County Central Committee. He
presented as chairman the gallant vet
eran and esteemed citizen, Judge R. F.
Crawford. The chairman, in assuming
the responsibilities and honor of the po
sition, made a brief speech, in which he
referred to the reflection of Maguire
that Gage had no record. It was sug
gested that Maguire had too much rec
ord. Ha said a record was sometimes
the most uncomfortable thing for a
man to have. A man could no more
escape from it than an elephant could
from his trunk.
, â¢ When Henry T. Gage, the champion
: of the people, was presented the scene
of prolonged enthusiasm was one of the
i most remarkable and Inspiring that has
1 ever occurred in civil life. The audience
i arose and cheered, and continued the
I cheering and waving of flags for an
â  unusual length of time. Mr. Gage was
j not only received as the gifted standard
bearer o fine Republican party, but was
accorded a tribute as the defender of
the homes of the people. The enthusi
j asm to-night marked the appreciation
! of Sonoma County farmers for the gal
: lant and manly fight which Mr. Gage
is making against the home-destroying
scheme of the single tax.
The speech of the standard bearer to
: nieht was one of the ablest delivered
during the campaign. He spoke for one
hour. His highest efforts are called out
when interruptions occur. To-night he
mentioned that Mr. Maguire had drawn
â  $65,000 from the public treasury. A Ma
guireite in the audience asked: "Why
not?" Mr. Gage replying said: "Why
! not? Well, because Mr. Maguire claims
to be opposed to monopoly."
The reply elicited a storm of cheers
; and roars of laughter from the audi
ence. After the standard bearer had
referred^to his record in resisting the
Interference of the railroad in politics,
and presented the Congressional Record
to show the weakness of Maguire's po
sition, he proceeded to discuss the
single tax. When he said It was his
I purpose to devote some time to the
single tax the audience gave rounds of
; applause, signifying the intense public
interest in the question. The masterly
manner in which he exposed the dan.
gers of this phase of Maguire socialism
excited the keenest attention of his?
hearers.
In closing one of the most convincing
and able addresses of this campaign,
Mr. Gage said a few words of a per
sonal nature to the audience. He an
nounced that he would be elected Gov
ernor, and that his opponents would
have no cause to "poke fun at his in
augural suit." When elected he would
serve the commonwealth to the best of
his ability. His administration would
be clean and honest and fair to every
citizen, rich and poor alike.
After a song by the Glee Club, Judgp
Crawford in a graceful speech, present
ed John A. Barham, candidate for re
election to Congress in the First Dis
trict. Mr. Barham was received with
a great demonstration of favor. He
spoke on national topics, paying a tri
bute to the patriotic devotion of the
American people, as evidenced in the
bond subscriptions to raise money t<>
conduct the war. Speaking of his own
public acts Mr. Barham said he was in
strumental in passing a law compelling
the Central and Western Pacific rail
roads to pay their debts. Mr. Barham
created a sensation by telling the lnsld- 5
history of the railroad settlement. PI"
distinctly asserted that Magulre read
the amendment â read it carefully â and
after deliberation recommended that
the word "right" be Inserted, and thert
in Congress, sitting beside the member
from the First District, agreed to every
word and phrase of the amendment
which he now condemns as infamous.
Speaking of the Maguire portraits
displayed all along the upper coast,
Mr. Barham said:
"Why, Maguirc has the words, 'cham
pion of the oppressed' under the pic
ture. The fellow thinks he is running
for Governor of Spain." (Roars of
laughter.)
It was asserted that Maguire had
sent out under the Congressional frank
thousands of copies of his speech in
Congress advocating the sinerle tax.
George A. Knight was presented to
the audience at a late hour and re
ceived a tremendous ovation. He at
tempted to speak in response but his
voice failed him. He made a gallant
and strenuous effort to say some thing
to the magnificent assemblage, but the
open air meeting at Napa last night
and the speech at Petaluma this after
noon had impaired his powers of speech
beyond immediate recuperation.
The great audience dissolved with
mighty cheers for Gage and Neff.
The demonstration to-night elopes
Mr. Gage's tour of Northern California.
He speaks in Oakland and San Fran
cisco to-morrow night. His powers of
endurance and his pluck are remarka
ble.
HON. WEBSTER DAVIS
TALKS AT BAKERSFIELD
His Telling Eloquence Makes Many-
Converts to the Cause of
Republicanism.
BAKERSFIELD. Oct. 28.âNotwith
standing the fact that two prominent fu
sion speakers were here to-night, Hon.
"Webster Davis literally carried the town
off its feet with his wonderful eloquence.
Armory Hall was packed with an eager
multitude. Had there been room in the
hail the fusion speakers on the street
would not have had a corporal's guard
of hearers.
No speaker ever created a more pro
found impression. Mr. Davis spoke for
an hour and a half; and his manner of
presenting the national Issues made nu
merous converts. People were hungry
for such a talk and not a word I was
missed. When McKlnley and territorial
expansion were touched upon there was
wild applause. Old Democrats and Popu
lists admitted the force of the argument.
The conduct of the war and the Presi
dent's patriotic policy were shown in a
clear light.
Mr. Davis left for Los Angelos soon
after speaking.
Republican Rally at Tracy.
TRACY, Oct. 2S.â A Republican rally
was held hero to-night. Frank I). Ryan,
Republican nomine for Congress in the
Second District, and Frank H. Short
were the speakers. Ludwlg's Hall was
crowded and much enthusiasm was
shown throughout the meeting. Frank
D. Ryan was listened to with marked
attention. He made a favorable impres
sion upon those present. Mr. Short's
speech also was well received. The meet
ing broke up with three rousing cheers
for Gage ana Neff, and Ryan.

SACRAMENTO, Oct. 28. â Senator
George C. Perkins and T. V. Eddy re
ceived a rousing welcome in Sacra
mento to-night. Bands played and
street fires flared up at various cross
ings to express Sacramento's enthusi
asm in behalf of the Republican ticket,
while the low-measured boom of salut
ing canno-n added to the impressive
demonstration. At the old pavilion an
immense crowd had assembled, and
when Professor E. C. Atkinson intro
duced Senator Perkins the building
trembled under the cheers from thou
sands of throats.
Senator Perkins made a happy hit by
paying a tribute to old Sacramento,
which held for him many pleasant as
sociations. He sketched the conditions
preceding and following the return of
the Republican party to power, declar
ing that confidence succeeded panic
even before any legislation had been
effected. He said the Republican party
was carrying out its promises to the
people, both in letter and in spirit.
Senator Perkins said he did no-c want
to tire his auditors about the tariff, but
they might as well ask a preacher to
stop talKing against sin as to request
a Republican not to talk patriotism,
for that, he added, was what the Re
publican idea of protection embodied.
He referred to the advance which the
Dingley tariff bill had made in the
price of wool in California and said
that the poor man had to pay no more
than 50 cents a suit extra because of
the advance. Farmers were able to
raise stock profitably, while the poor
man, on his part, was permitted to eat
fresh American meat instead of the in
ferior Mexican article.
The Senator touched upon the foster
ing protection which the Dingley bill
had thrown around the beet sugar in
dustry, saying that in the last season
the beet sugar factory at Watsonvliie
consumed 135,000 tons of sugar beets,
circulating in that community the im
mense sum of $1,000,000.
Senator Perkins said he respected the
Democratic party of Thomas Jefferson,
and he believed that if Tho-mas Jefter
son were alive to-day he would be a
Republican. But the Democracy of this
State had lost its personality by merg
ing Itself into the Silver Republican
party and the Populist party, resulting
in three platforms presenting three sep
arate sets of doctrines. He called upon
his Democratic friends who had lost
their party faith to come into the Re
publican ranks. He made a strong plea
for the elevation of a thoroughly hon
est man, in the person of Henry T.
Gage, to the office of Governor. He
said that for four years the Democrats
had been in power in the State. He
asked that some one point out the work
they had accomplished. A majority of
the Railroad Commission was Demo
cratic, yet the Democratic members
thereof had accomplished no-thing,
making promises before election, only
to renew them, like frogs in the spring
time, when another election year rolled
around.
All Republicans were called upon to
stand by President McKinley on the
monetary question, and, by rolling up a
great majority in California, send on to
the President a vote of confidence in hid
administration.
Senator Perkins was followed by Mr.
Eddy in an eloquent and argumentative
treatment of the issues of the campaign.
GAGE AND MAGUIRE"
COMPARED BY WHITE
Senator Says the Fusionist Should
Win Because He Has Had
More Experience.
MARYSVILLE, Oct. 28.â 1t was a cor
dial reception the Democrats and Repub
licans of Yuba and Sutter counties tend
ered United States Senator Stephen M.
White this evening, when he spoke at
Marysvllle Theater on political issues.
The chairman of the meeting was A. C.
Stagner of Wheatland; the vice presi
dents were: W. H. Carlin. Hon. A. C.
Bingham. Dr. G. Stratton, Hon. H. P.
Stabler, J. G. Cohn, N. Schneider, \V. P.
O'Brien, J. H. Herbert. Mayor Brooks,

J. M. Berry, Thomas Hopkins, T. H.
Kernan, Dr. T. Dobbins, Sheriff Dona
hoe, E. P. McDaniel, \V. G. Murphy and
C. E. Wilcoxon.
Despite counter attractions there was a
large gathering to hear the statesman,
ladies appearing in goodly numbers. The
introduction of the speaker was the sig
nal for prolonged applause, which was
evtidently given in recognition of Mr.
White's station, rather than in approval
cf the cause he is espousing in the cam
paign, lie began with a comparison of
the two candidates for Governor, assert
ing that on account of his knowledge of
Colitlcal affairs and experience in the
alls of legislation the "Little Giant"
was the better fitted for the position. To
the railroad company would the credit be
due were Maguire defeated. The single
tax Issue was not gone into at any length,
the speaker claiming that it was not an
is.Â«ue in this campaign. His tribute to
the volunteer army was most eloquent
and aroused much patriotic enthusiasm.
He had words of commendation for the
local legislative nominees, and exhorta
tions for the support of Mnguire and
Hutchison concluded his speech.
Republicans Gain in Monterey.

AUBURN, Oct. 28.â The Democrats
and People's party men made a big
sho%ving here to-night in honor of their
standard-bearer, Judge James G. Ma
guire, and E. L. Hutchison. While the
demonstration was an immense affair it
by no means came up to the one given
the Republican nominees last week,
either in point of numbers or in mag
nificence.
Judge Maguire, E. L. Hutchison and
H. A. McCraney, the latter candidate
for Clerk of the Supreme Court, spoke
at Placerville last night and to-day
made the trip to Auburn by private
conveyance, stopping at Georgetown,
Greenwood and Co-ol en route. They
were met at Georgetown by the follow
ing Auburnites: Sam J. Pullen, chair
man of the Democratic Central Com
mittee; John Davis, secretary of the
People's Party Committee; Mayor J.
W. Morgan and A. N. Hoffman. Con
gressman de Vries and Railroad Com
missioner La Rue had preceded the gu
bernatorial party by train, and when
all arrived a reception was held at the
American Hotel.
Flags, Chinese lanterns and red lights
took the place of torches and the pa
raders formed at the town plaza. They
were marshaled by Fred E. Brye, F. S.
Roumage and Charles Wubbena, the
Auburn band leading and the bands
from Lincoln, Roseville, Newcastle and
Colfax fallowing and dividing the pro
cession into five sections. The line of
march was along the main street to the
depot, countermarching to the opera
house.
General Jo Hamilton presided at the
meeting. Judge Magulre was the first
speaker. His remarks were on the same
lines as those delivered elsewhere. He
declared the single tax was not an is
sue, but that the railroad was. He
called attention to the fact that M. M.
Estee had been "called down" and a
railroad attorney substituted to stump
the State with Gage. He defended his
course in Congress on the funding bill
amendment and challenged anybody to
name a railroad man who was not sup
porting the Republican ticket. In clos
ing he delivered a eulogy cm Congress
man de Vries and his work in Congress, j
Maguire was followed by Hutchison, j
McCraney, La Rue and De Vries, who
addressed the audience briefly. Dur- j
ing intervals of the meeting campaign
songs were sung by the Forest Hill and
Newcastle Glee clubs. A dance con
cluded the day.

Judge J. M. Fulweiler addressed one of
the largest and most enthusiastic meet
ings ever held In Sutter Creek. Hon.
John F. Davis presided. The addresses
were eloquent and convincing and made
a deep impression on those present.
The indications now are that Amador
County for the first time in her history
will give a plurality fnr the head of the
Republican ticket. Neff will get nearly
all the votes In this county and Ford will
not be far behind.
To-night there was such a large out
pouring of the people to honor the min
er's champions, Xeff and Ford, that the
hall would not hold half, so an overflow
meeting was held.

REA FIGHTING 111
HIS LUST DITCH
Santa Clara's Gang Is
Demoralized.
LOSING FOLLOWERS DAILY
BOSS AND HIS HENCHMEN IN
SORE STRAITS.
Their Campaign Directed Against
Pour Members and Nominees of
the Good Government
League.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Oct. 28.â The Rea gang is
thoroughly demoralized by the condi
tions that confront it. Since Rea's con
viction of slander there has been a de
fection in the ranks, and many old
time supporters of the ring now pass
the leaders by with only a glassy stare.
Until lately few men in business dared
to oppose Rea or the Mackenzies, as
that meant the ruination of their busi
ness. The boycott was the weapon of
these gangsters, and they applied it
effectively.
This is all changed now. The convic
tion of Rea announced a new era for
San Jose, and it Is a question of only
a short time when Rea and the Mac
kenzie family will be retired to private
life. This condition will come as a re
sult of the victory of the reform forces
on November 8. A county government
by the people, economically adminis
tered, instead of one by boss rule, will
be a relief to the taxpayers of the
county.
The great number of the people who
are rallying to the support of the Good
Government League ticket is urging
the gang on to more desperate efforts
than ever before. Rea has given it out
to his lieutenants to do anything to de
feat the reform ticket, and especially
James H. Lyndon for Sheriff, L. J.
Chipman for School Superintendent, E.
\V. Conant for Treasurer and A. T.
Herrmann for Surveyor. These four
are members and nominees of the Good
Government League, and the gang is to
center all its power on this quartet.
Lyndon and Chipman have made excel
lent officials, while Herrmann and Con
ant are well qualified for the positions
to which they aspire.
The Good Government League is over
2000 strong, and it will support its en
tire ticket from top to bottom. These
Republicans who have had manhood
enough to break away from the boss
ridden party in the county are to be
taught a lesson, and the gan^ while it
will work to defeat the whole union
ticket, will make an especial effort to
down these four.
The California Club, the Reaites
headquarters, is the scene of great ac
tivity Just now. Conferences are held
daily and plans of campaign being ar
ranged. Money is being collected from
gang officials and friends for a corrup
tion fund, and city and county officials
have been given orders to get out and
work for voters. i
Boss Rea is trying, hard to re-elect
his brother, G. E. Rea, to the Board of
Supervisors from the First District.
Voters are being: colonized and money
used in Rea's behalf, but it looks very
much as though R. M. Phelps, the anti- j
gang candidate, will win. A meeting of
the Good Government League at Gilroy
this week was the largest ever held
there. Gilroy is the home of the Rea
family, and always considered a hot
bed for gangsters. The defeat of Rea's
brother there would be a direct slap in
the face of the gang. It is afraid of
this result, and Vie Bassignano, super
intendent of the County Infirmary here,
has been sent down there to herd the
voters into line. Bassignano formerly
lived there. The fact that this county
official should leave his duties here and
go to Gilroy to electioneer for Rea is
causing much unfavorable comment.
The Police Department of this city
also is taking a hand in politics, con
trary to provisions of the city charter,
which state it must keep out of politics.
Chief Kidward is especially active, and
he and his pets on the force are out
fighting Lyndon, the Good Government
candidate for Sheriff. The Fire Depart
ment, likewise, is doing service for the
gang, and even the lady teachers in the
School Department are button-holing
friends and asking them to support the
Rea ticket.
DICK LOWE BRINGS
GOLD FROM KLONDIKE
Arrives on the Cottage City With a
Hundred and Fifty Thousand
to His Credit.
SEATTLE, Oct. 28.â The steamer Cot
tage City arrived in port this morning
from Alaska with a large list of pas
sengers, some of whom left Dawson dur
ing the first week in October. They
caught the Cottage City at Juneau, com
ing down from Skagway in a small
steamer.
The richest passenger was Dick Lowe,
who is said to have $150,000 to his credit
here, part of which he brought out with
him. while part was gold sent down the
Yukon. He came out over the Dalton
trail, and has been in Alaska several
years. Lowe has a fractional claim on
Bonanza Creek, from which he has taken
$250,000. His biggest clean-up this year
was $45,000, the result of thirty hours'
sluicing. The best prospect was fifty-one
ounces to the pan. worth $867.
News of the death of O. M. Cole of
Illinois by accidental shooting at Mlnook
Creek has reached Juneau. where Cole
formerly lived. He was with H. Hart
and a party of six coming down the creek
in a small boat. In some manner his gun
was discharged, inflicting a fatal wound.
He died three hours after, and was burled
on the creek banb. Cole once mined in
the Casslar country.
Captain Wallace reports strong head
winds on the trip, which was otherwise
uneventful. The Cottage City had 226
passengers, many of whom were mine
owners, who had started for Dawson but
were compelled to return, as the steam
ers have stopped running.
FRUIT SENT TO HAMBURG.
Solano County Growers Find a Profit-
able Foreign Market.
BUISUN, Oct. 2S.â Large demands have
been received here from Germany for
dried fruits. Suisun has been made the
headquarters of an Influential iirm that
two years ago commenced shipping dried
fruits to Hamburg. Consignments were
at first made on a small scale and the
fruit sent was of first-class quality and
neatly packed In boxes. The enterprise
proved a satisfactory one, and in con
sequence a permanent market has been
established which promises such an ex
tension of business and Increased demands
that an additional avenue for the dis
posal of California dried fruit has been
opened. The season opened with the
shipment of dried apricots, peaches and
pears. The demand at present is for
prunes, and during the past week six
carloads have been shipped to Hamburg.
A large quantity remains for consign
ment and to expedite shipping an addi
tional force of thirty-five hands has been
employed.

ed and as he raised it suddenly the trig
gir caught in his clothes and the gun was
discharged, the ball going through three
privates in the ranks, one of whom has
since died.

STRIKES II ROCK
AND GOES DOWN
Yukon River Steamship
Anglian Lost.
PASSENGERS AND CREW SAFE
ESCAPE IN SMALL BOATS TO THE
SHORE.
The John C. Barr Is Fast on a San 4
Bar Near Fort Selkirk and
Probably Will Become Â»
Total Wreck.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Oct. 28.â The large Yukon
River steamship Anglian was wrecked
near the confluence erf Hootalinqua
aTid Thirty-mile rivers three weeks
ago, according to a report brought to-:
day by passengers on the steamship
Cottage City. The Anglian had tried
to reach White Horse Rapids, where
she was to go into winter quarters, but
failed on account of the very low water,
which usually precedes the freezing up
of the Yukon's uppe^ waters. The
steamship was accordingly turned
around, with the intention of returning
to Dawson. After proceeding about
twenty miles down river she struck a
sunken rock. A few hours later she
went down, as the water steadily
gained on her pumps. She undoubtedly
will be a total wreck, as nothing can
be done to raise her before the ice
breaks up. By that time she will have
been entirely demolished. Her passen.
gers and crew escaped in small boata
and camped on shore until provisions
could be procured to enable them tq
reach Dawson.
The steamship John C. Barr, belong
ing to the North American Transporta
tion and Trading Company, recently
went ashore on a sandbar forty miles
below Fort Selkirk. Great efforts were
being made to get her off. If they fail
she probably will be broken to- pieces
by ice jams when the river freezes.
The Barr was taking a cargo of cat
tle to Dawson for Pat Galvin's com
j pany. Being new to the upper river her
officers got her into a channel having
a sandbar at the end of it. In trying
to turn around she was forced on the
bar and the swift current made It next
to impossible to release her.
CLEARS A MYSTERY
OF TWELVE YEARS AGO
Confession of an Astoria Man Shows
that Herman Johnson Was
Murdered.
ASTORIA, Oct. 28.â According: to the
confession of Herman Roikala, the death
of Herman Johnson in this city about
twelve years ago was a cold-blooded mur-t
der. Roikala, now in custody of tne
Sheriff, tells the following story:
"On Christmas eve, twelve years ago,
Herman Johnson. Elias Kasola and my
self got into a row in a saloon. After thq
trouble Johnson and I started home to
gether, and while proceeding up the road
way in West Astoria, near the bay, Ka
sola, who was secreted in fhe dark, way
laid us, and in the struggle struck John
son on the head with a club and killed
him. Kasola then turned hi? attention to
me and I agreed to say nothing about the
murder if let alone. The 3ead man was
then thrown over the bank into the bay,
and his body was subsequently found. It
was determined by a Coroner's jury that
Johnson was accidentally drowned.
Kasola is supposed to be in Finland.

BEAR CLUB HONORS THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINEES
A Mighty Gathering of Political Brains at
the Den at B'nai B'rith
Hall.
Ursines, Big and Little, Come Forth to Chant the Party
Creed and Make Meat of Democratic
Falsehood.
There was a mighty gathering of the
Bears last night. From their haunts in
the sand dunes and their dens in the
town, they prowled to foregather at their
big rendezvous at B'nai B'rith Hall, to
celebrate their thirteenth birthday and
to do all honor to those honored of all
loyal Bears, the Republican nominees.
it was an enthusiastic, good natured
array of political bruins. They came out
not to hear, but to ratify the principles,
platform, candidates and all else that
pertained to their creed, and many of
them brought their wives to grace the
galleries and lend a social flavor to the
doings of their Bearships in the pit.
Clubs from nearly every district in hte
city sent delegations to add to the even
ing's enthusiasm, and the James F.
Troutt Club of the Forty-fifth District
was there to the full extent of its mem
bership. It was a gala night and an
augury of Republican success, the like
of which the campaign has not before
seen.
Every candidate on the municipal ticket
save two who were ill was on hand and
ready with a speech, and their ranks were
augmented by a number of those who
seek honors in the State lists.
Thomas W. Collins, president of the
club, presided over his 500 and odd un
ruly cubs. It took him a full sixty sec
onds with his gavel to bring quiet out of
the roars of greeting that were going up
as the candidates and speakers of the
evening arrived.
When he did win a semblance of order
he announced a greeting to all of the vis
iting clubs and a welcome to the score
of nominees who were o.i the stage. He
said that he did not know it was neces
sary, but he thought that a lit
tle Bear Club history would not be
amiss, and he called upon Edward I.
Wolff, a Bear of the original band, to
provide It.
"Do I need to tell you," said Mr. Wolff.
"that the Bear Club has been always
identified with and one of the hardest
workers for the best interests of this
city? From the time that it was first or
ganized, way back in ISSS, It has been the
leading club in all things Republican and
has given its best labors and Influence to
bring about Republican success. To the
many Republican victories it has con
tributed largely, and it will contribute
largely to the success that we are now so
sure will come of our work In this cam-
"ft may well be said that this Is to be
an election of unusual importance. In
it we have to elect Judges to our Su
preme bench, municipal officers who will
have it in their power to make or wreck
the fair name and fair promise o f this
city, and we have to elect a Congress
that will either approve of or repudiate
the magnificent course that our Presi
dent has taken through the unhappy'war
that we have just passed through with
such glorious success and lasting results.
We have to elect a Congress that will
appreciate and make the most of the
splendid opportunities that have come to
us through our present administration and
that will uphold that administration in
its future plans for our general welfare.
Only those can do this who are in politi
cal and moral sympathy with the admin
istration and I wish to impress this fact
upon all good' Be;:rs and upon the many
who are here to do us honor to-night."
With his eloquence and evident sincer
ity and the concise expression of the^r
own opinions Mr. "Wolff caught the
house. Cheer after cheer went up to rus
tle the flag-decked ceiling, and Vlce-Presi
dent Vooisanger was obliged to delay his
remarks for as much as five minutes until
the applause subsided.
"The Bear Club, as you have already
been told." said Mr. Voorsanger, "is one
of the oldest Republican organizations in
the city, and 1 wish to add that it is a
source of real pride to us to know and to
feel that in strict adherence to the prin
ciples of the Republican party, in fidelity
to its cause, and in real hard work, Indi
vidually and collectively, for the success
of the various Republican aspirants for
political honors, the Bear Club yields the
palm to no one.
"One of the main reasons why every
right-mlnded citizen in California should
this year of all years support the Repub
lican party regardless of political creed
is because the eyea of ttie world are upon
thousands of our native eons who are now
In Manila. Our own brave Californian
boys, who left loving parents, brothers
and sisters, with a determination to up
hold the honor of our flag with their
life's blood, and the only thing that sus
tains these brave lads in the land of ma
laria and suffering is their sturdy patri
otism. And I say to you now, fellow- cit
izens, that a vote for the Republican tick
et this year will be a vote of thanks to
them and of confidence in the man who
sent them where they are to vindicate
this country's \onor, President McKin
ley."
Mr. Voorsanger was progressing with
his speech when a quickstep from the
band and cheers from the doorway an
nounced the arrival of Julius Kahn. Es
corted by a delegation from the club.
Mr. Kahn was about to take his seat, but
the audience wouldn't have It that way.
Nothing but a speech would do, and it
was not a bit quiet about saying so.
Mr. Kahn said he had not come to make
a speech, because it was a matter of fact
that all Bears knew as much about party
Issues as he did. "I've only come here to
help you ratify In advance," said Mr.
kahn, "but in doing so 1 am going to say
a few things that are of particular Im
portance to us all at this time.
"I have long had the honor of being a
Bear among you and I can vouch for the
enthusiasm of this club for everything
Republican. In no campaign have Its
tnembers been found wanting. They have

ever supported the party principles and
candidates.
"It seems to me that there is but one
question involved in the present fight for
supremacy: Shall Mr. McKinley receive
the indorsement of the people of Califor
nia in the course that he has pursued in
our war with Spain? Shall the people of
this State hold up his hands and help
him with the plans that he has for the fu
ture? This is paramount. Even our ad
versaries admit that he has given us a
wise, a broad, an honest administration,
and tHe least we can do is to say so by
our vote on the Bth of the coming month.
"We of this State have more at stake
than any of the other States in the
Unioh. With our new gained colonies the
time is not far distant when San Fran
ci.sco will be one of the greatest mari
time cities of the globe, and in order to
get the full benefit of the glorious op
portunities that are each day opening to
us we must send men into our council
halls who are familiar and in sympathy
with the politic and plans of our execu
tive."
Mr. Kahn closed with a convincing de
nial that the railroad as a campaign is
sue is a bogie raised by the Democrats
for the want of a better contention.
The Troutt Club had come to ratify and
it considered that its time had arrived.
From all over the hall loud ahouts for
"Troutt!" "Troutt:" "Speech!" and like
calls that were calculated to disconcert
President Collins, who was trying to an
nounce some one else. Mr. Collins com
promised by calling for Judge Troutt.
The kind greeting was most warmly ap
preciated by Judge Troutt. He could not
deal with political matters, for obvious
reasons, but he said many nicÂ« things
about the Bear Club and bears in gen
eral, which were echoed in the cheera of
his adherents in the body of the hall.
Judge Troutt argued for a solid vote as
a vote of confidence in the President. He
also said he had heard that there were
many who were so ignorant of their du
ties as good citizens that in the coming
election they were going to resort to
"plumping." "That is," said Judge
Troutt, "vote for only one or two nomi
nees for an office when there are three or
four running for the office on the same
ticket. Such a practice is not right. It
is not good citizenship, and I stronply
urge you to inveigh against the practice
wherever you hear it is likely to be done."
There was a letup in the serious busi
ness at this point and the Waterman sis
ters filled in the interval with a number
of clever campaign songs.
Congressman Eugene F. Loud came
next. "I find," began Mr. Loud, "that
you have Indorsed the singers and have
fairly elected Judge Troutt and I have
come to the conclusion that this Is more
a ratification meeting than anything else.
And gentlemen, you are right. We have
almost reached that point where we can
ratify with every reason for doing so. I
have been for two weeks past In the coun
try, talking for and in defense of Repub
lican principles and I have found it an
<-asy thing to do. No principles ever pro
mulgated were broader, purer or better
than those in our platform, and the people
of this State realize it.
"Accordlng to his own idea Mr. Ma
guire has been vested with all of the
power and the glory of these United j
States, and with all of the moral recti
tude that ever existed in Congress. He
came back here proclaiming that he was |
the only honest man in Washington, and j
he pptnted out the deficiency bill to prove :
it. He voted against that in the face of
the opinions and votes of the brainiest
and best men in Congress, who thought
that the for best interests of this country
the bill were best passed. He claimed j
that the war revenue bill, that was pro
mulgated by five of the old school Demo
crats in the Senate, was wrong for that
it worked a hardship on the poor. If a
tax on sleeping car berths and seats and"
on telegrams and Wells-Fargo packages
works a hardship on Maguire's poor peo
ple then certainly the bill is wrong, but
as a general thing the people who can
afford these things are able to also pay I
the tax.
"There is one man they have not
claimed, though. They have not laid
claim to William McKinley, whose glo
rious statesmanship it was that led us
through this war with such honor to
ourselves. They have spent their time in
howling that it was not a Republican
war and charging the Republican party
with all of the shortcomings and disas
ters that accompanied It. That's consist
ent, isn't it? If Thomas Jefferson could
rise out of his honored grave and see
his dishonored progeny he'd return to his
dust and ashes and be glad to get back."
Ex-Supreme Court Justice Van R. Patj
erson took the rostrum to 'defend his ok*
â¢ associates on the bench against the vil
lainous'attacks of Phelaii and others of
his ilk.. ;
"Men in their high judicial position can
not stoop to their own defense, but thank
God they have friends who can, and those
friends will do it," said Mr. Paterson.

Kiainig falsehoods that he haa made use
uf in his attack upon the Supreme judi
ciary and argued that because the court
did not decide in the Supervisor case in
the way that Phelan demanded they were
not of necessity corrupt.
In closing Judge Paterson paid a trib
ute to his former colleagues that found
a response in the mighty shout of ap
proval that went up from the throats of
his thousand hearers.
Judge Paterson was followed by all of
j the local candidates in turn, and the
crowd stayed late to hear them through.

Every bill, placard, poster, pamphlet or other
printed matter having reference to an election
or to any candidate shall bear upon the face
thereof the name and address of the printer
and publisher thereof, and no payment shall
be made or allowed unless Buch address Is so
printed.
The State convention of the Democratic
party indorsed the label of the Allied
Printing Trades Council, the municipal
convention indorsed this action and can
didates individually have promised that
all their work should bear this guarantee
of union workmanship. Yet, in spite of
all these pledges and in spite of the btate
law, placards were freely distributed
along Market street yesterday afternoon
bearing neither the label nor the imprint
of the printerâ simply the name of the
publisher, who has ueen a notorious
patron of non-union offices fur years.
Added to this is the fact that the party
must have known what it was about, as
officers of the Allied Printing Trades
Council affirm that lists of all the offices
in the city privileged to use the label
were freely distributed at the headquar
ters of the parties and a copy mailed to
each candidate. There are other reasons,
too. which prevent these self-styled
friends of organized labor from claiming
ignorance. Before the lob in question was
off the presses the officers of the Allied
Printing Trades Council knew what was
being done, and in order that no cry of
"snap Judgment" might be made visited
the headquarters of the County Commit
tee and several of the candidates in per
son and made a plain statement of the
case. The story was listened to. there
was a little scurrying around of political
hangers-on and the placards went up just
the same.
The matter was brought up at the meet
ing of the Labor Council last night and
the following resolution, presented by J.
K. Phillips of the Typographical Union,
was unanimously adopted:
Resolved. That Is is the senseof the San Fran -
Cisco Labor Council that the unfair printing
firms of John Partridge and Charles Boldemann
be denounced for not complying with the laws
of the AlHed Printing Trades Council and also
section 10 of the purity of election law,
which explicitly provides that the name and
address of printers doing political work
be placed thereon, and further that all candi
dates for political office who fall to have the
label of said Allied Printing Trades Council
placed upon their printing be placed on record
The placard In question bears a half
tone portrait of every candidate on the lo
cal ticket, from Mayor Phelan down, and
framed copies are placed in conspicuous
places in almost every saloon and cigar
stand of prominence along Market street.
Much indignation has been expressed
over the matter by union men throughout
the city, who are accustomed to look for
the label before they look at the Job, and
it is broadly hinted that the matter will
be brought to the attention of the Grand
Jury, as the offense is punishable by a
fine of from $1000 to $5000, or proportionate
Imprisonment.
Politics in the Encinal City.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 2S.â Local Republicans
are much exercised over the attempt of
an independent candidate for a township
office to advertise himself as a regular
Republican nominee. D. T. Hard sought
the nomination for Justice of the Peace
at the San Leandro convention. He was
defeated by Harry Morris, and straight
away announced himself as an independ
ent. Party lines are rather closely drawn
in Alameda. Mr. Hard pooled issues with
a regular Republican nominee for Consta
ble, and the two issued a card, which has
openly been declared by fhe party man
agers an attempt to mislead the voters.
Their names appear together in bold type,
followed by the caption, "Regular Repub
lican nominee." The caption is in the
singular, but is made to fit either one of
the candidates.
John Hackett, who is running for the
office of County Assessor, Mas been adopt
ed by the independent party. The formal
announcement was made at a recent
meeting of the party held at Encinal
Hall The independents refused to indorse
Henry Dalton, and were without a candi
date for the office until Mr. Hackett i.ad
a falling out with his own Democratic
party and concluded to go it alone.
Democrats at North Beach.
A meeting of the Democrats was held
last nlffht in Garibaldi Hall at North
Beach. The retinue of speakers went the
rounds of several other meetings and
landed before the audience one after an
other. Mayor Phelan repeated the hack
neyed tale of the brassy grasp of corpo
rate power, and chuckled over the fact
that the yellow Third-street organ's buzz
saw ripped off something this morning
about the Southern Pacilic Company be
ing In politics. He was followed by
Washington Dodge and his bundle of
charts after which E. P. Mogan outlined
his official policy, saying that in slight
offenses he did not believe in administer
ing flagrant punishment, where a repri
mand would subserve the ends of jus-
tice
George H. Cabaniss was loudly applaud
ed at the conclusion of his remarks and
the remainder of the speakers occupied
the attentions of their listener* until a
late hour. They were, William Jordon,
John A. Brown, Barclay Henley, J. Deasy,
F X Lane, J. H. Grady, R. P. Doolan,
Bernard Bienenfeld, T. F. Bonnet, Dr.
Clinton, Dr. T. W. Leland, Flnlay Cook
and others.
Friends of J. A. Drinkhouse.
The friends of J. A. Drinkhouse, the
Republican and Non-Parttean candidate
for Public Administrator, are organizing
clubs in his interest in various sections
of the city. The J. A. Drinkhouse Club
of the Fortieth Assembly District met
last evening at 15D0 Broderick street, and
organized by the election of Fred C. Nob
man Jr. as president and William Podd
as secretary. The club, consisting of 140
members, resolved to divide itself into
precinct organizations and canvass the
Fortieth District in the interest of Mr.
Drinkhouse's candidacy.
Aigeltinger Club Formed.
An E. H. Aigeltinger Club was formed
in the Thirty-seventh Assembly District
last evening, with the following officers;
B. Enright, president; J. Connlff, secre
tary, and A. Wise, treasurer. Meetings
will be held every Friday evening at
Junction Hall. Speeches were made by
William Holliday, B. Enrlgrht, James
Bell, J. Magorty, George Nichols and
Larry Tiernan.
Republican Demonstration.
President Jacob Dreyfuss of the Forty
flfth District (branch) Republi-.an Club,
announces to the voters of that district
that another rousing demonstration wiH
be held at 412 Jackson street this evening.
Several good speakers are engaged to ad
dress the meeting. Members of the club
and voters generally are invited to be
present.
JAMES D. PHELAN
OVERLOOKS FACTS
Some Matters the Autocrat Fails to
Touch Upon in His Self-Adulations.
James D. Phelan, autocrat of the local Democracy and political
purist, in again seeking the suffrage of the people of San Francisco,
nightly goes upon the platform and talks of the great good he has ac
complished, of the high regard in which he holds the humble followers in
his train; of his efforts in their behalf, and, above all, of his loyalty to
the party that invested him with the robe of office.
Mayor James D. Phelan may make himself believe the words he iter
ates and reiterates six days and nights in the week, but nobody else is
hoodwinked by them, for Mayor Phelan's record is too recent and too
glaring to deceive anybody but the few who are wilfully blind to the hol
lowness of his pretensions.
From the very first Mayor Phelan insulted and ignored the ones who
placed him where he is, trampling on their rights and privileges with the
imperiousness of a Nero, and this course he has consistently followed
down to the present time, when he asks his victims to believe that what
he has done was for their best interests, as they were and are totally in
competent to be intrusted with any voice in the^ffairs of their party.
Mayor Phelan, since the campaign opened, has found it expedient to
discard the silk tile of aristocracy and don the felt hat of the masses,
but he could not change his instincts with his headgear, and even as he
talks to those who will listen his sensibilities rise in unbidden revolt
against his honied words.
The appointment of the Democratic County Committee of One Hun
dred by Mayor Phelan, which afterward resolved itself into the Demo
cratic municipal nominating convention at Mayor Phelan's instance, is
a striking instance of that individual's total disregard for political pro
prieties or the rights of his political followers. The Democratic dis
tricts south of Market street that placed him in office were meagerly and
grudgingly recognized in Mr. Phelan's selections, while the aristocratic
and Republican districts of Nob and Russian hills, Pacific Heights and the
Western Addition were drawn upon for 75 per cent of his members. To
be exact, the nine Democratic Assembly districts furnished twenty-seven
members of the Committee of One Hundred, while the nine Republican
districts contributed seventy-three members. The following table shows
the Democratic or Republican majority in each Assembly District in the
city two years ago, and the number of committeemen selected from each
district:

There is one error in this table, for recent developments have shown
that the autocrat of the Democracy could only find ninety-nine members
of his party in this city whom he regarded as fit to associate himself
with, and was obliged to go over to the English colony of Sausalito for
his hundredth member, Mr. M. H. Hernan.
That was the first open evidence of the great disesteem in which
Mayor Phelan held the San Francisco Democracy; the first time he pub
licly announced to the Democratic strongholds that there were none
within their boundaries who were his equals in the social and political
plane; the first time he told his followers they were incompetent to man
age and control their own affairs.
The second announcement of this character Mayor Phelan made was
when his self-appointed Committee of One Hundred, then acting in the
capacity of a nominating convention, ignored those same Democratic
strongholds and again turned to the aristocratic Republican districts to
supply his Supervisorial material. In five wards not a Democrat could
be found acceptable to the autocrat of his party, and five silk-tiled, kid
gloved carpet-baggers were dispatched from their luxurious homes to
seek temporary residences in the south of Market street and water-front
wards in order that these incompetents might be properly represented in
the Supervisors' chambers, according to Mayor Phelan's ideas.
Mayor Phelan has so frequently shown his poor opinion of the hon
esty and intelligence of his followers that it is not to be wondered at, in
his daily and nightly self-laudations, he takes it for granted that his hear
ers will not recall his acts that, if remembered, woutd not endear himself
to them. He does not expect the great mass of people to remember when
he tells them of his vetoing of the city's gas bills, that he is a heavy stock
holder in an opposition company that is seeking to gain control of the
city's lighting, and that his hold-up of the rival company's money may
have been for the purpose of harassing a concern opposed to his own
company. Nor does he expect his audience to look back to the campaign
of two years ago, when the autocrat spent his patrimony by thousands to
secure his election, and afterward nade affidavit that his campaign ex
penses amounted to something like $250.
Mayor Phelan's followers are too dense, in his estimation, to take
heed of the time when a representative of the gas company was before
him for examination, and in reply to the Mayor's questioning said the
company paid its lamplighters $40 a month, whereat the Mayor was
righteously wroth and replied that $25 was enough for them. Nor of
another occasion when told by an employe of the Spring Valley Water
Company that its laborers were paid $2 a day, at which Mr. Phelan ex
pressed his disapproval by saying that $1 50 a day was ample for work
ingmen.
Then there is that firewood pavement. Nobody is expected to
question the motive that led the autocrat to deface nearly an entire
block on Market street by outting down a pavement of tar and redwood
splinters in preference to the substantial California product of bitumen
on a solid concrete foundation. If it was because the Mayor is also
financially interested in the company that laid it and wanted to introduce
it to the citizens of San Francisco as a monument to shifty and shiftless
street work, he carefully refrains from mentioning the fact in his
harangues. Â»
Another thing the autocrat fails to discuss in its entirety, and which
he relies on the ignorance of his people to overlook, is his conduct in the
matter of the ousting of the Board of Supervisors. Mayor Phelan seeks
to make much political capital out of that episode, and in his shuffling of
facts he is ingenious, not to say expert. But one old-line Democrat.
Auditor William Broderick, whom until Mayor Phelan saw fit to discard
as unfit for his charmed circle a majority of the people thought emi
nently capable of filling one of the most important offices in their gift,
has come forward and drawn attention to a few points the Mayor has
refrained from touching upon. According to the decision of Judge Wal
lace the board could be ousted, but it must be ousted as a whole, which
decision Mayor Phelan has always upheld. If men are removed from
office under such conditions they are ineligible to hold public office in this
State for all time, yet Mayor Phelan sought to and did place four of
them (Lackmann, Clinton, Dodge and Rottanzi) back in their old posi
tions, and has placed Dodge and Lackmann on his ticket now before the
people, for Assessor and Supervisor, respectively.
Another point brought to lieht by Mr. Broderick is the worthlessness
of the bonds offered by Mr. Phelan for ten of the Supervisors he selected
at that time. The appointments were actually made on September 16,
but a typewritten corporation bond, prepared under Mayor Phelan's di
rection and presented to the Auditor by Colonel Sullivan, the Mayor's
secretary, read: "Whereas, was appointed a Supervisor
on the 15th day of September." etc. This discrepancy in dates rendered
the bonds worthless, and Mayor Phelan was submitted to a rigid examin
ation on that point by Garret McEnerney when the case was tried before
the Superior Court. Denman and Lackmann furnished their own bonds,
which were regular and binding.
Mayor Phelan has been entirely frank with his followers in so far as
he has branded them moral smd mental incompetents; why is he not
equally frank in his references to himself?

A REPUBLICAN BALLY.
Hearty Welcome to Candidates by
South-of-Market Street Voters.
Black"s Hall, at 619 Bryant street, near i
Fourth, is not a very big or pretentious j
â place of meeting, but it was filled with i
Republican enthusiasm last evening. It '
was full to the doors with Republicans i
and the enthusiasm extended to the over- I
flow on the outside. If last evening's !
demonstration is any Indication of what
may be expected of the voters of the dis
trict on the Bth of next month, it is safe
to say that the Democratic candidates
will not have much to boast of from that
part of the town.
Among the early arrivals was Charles
L. Patton, candidate for Mayor, who, up
on entering the hall, was received with
round after round of cheers. In a brief
address he stated his position in the
campaign in a pleasant, simple
manner that at once won the
hearts and confidence of the audience, D.
J. Murphy, candidate for District Attor
ney, delivered a short address. I. J.
Truman said that when the Mayor comes
around to see how much money there is,
he will see that the money is counted and
not "hefted." A. R. Wells stated that he
too would look after the matter, as that is
a part of his duties. The reception ac
corded to Martin Fragley, nominee for
Street Superintendent, showed that he
was no stranger in that section of the
city.
No heartier reception could have been
given to any one than that accorded to
John A. Hoey, who has every. assurance
that he will be the next State Senator
from that, the Eighteenth Senatorial dis
trict. Among the others who addressed
the gathering were J. B. Cole for School
Director, H. J. Clement for Superior
Judge, H. L. Joachimsenfor Police Judge.
C. A. Low for the same office, Edward I.
Sheehan for Tax Collector, A. B. Tread
well for Police Judge, J. Carson foT Su
perior Judge, and several others. The
meeting was presided over by Captain H.
P. Kilgute.
Prize Campaign Song.
The prize offered by the Gage clubs of
the Universities of California and Stan
ford to the students of both colleges for
the best Republican campaign song has
been awarded to Miss Muriel Eastman of
the University of California. The song,
which is printed below, will be sung at
the great intercollegiate Republican rally,
to be held to-night in Woodward's Pa
vilion. The words are to be sung to the
tune of "The Jolly Sophomore."
In "heftum" Phelan trusted; but, oh, his trusts
were vain:
The sacks were very heavy, he used his might
and main.
Oh, Jimmy, gentle Jimmy dear, why did you
try that name?
Was It to beat the city, lad, or were your
wrusts Just lame!
The best laid plans of mice and men do often
fall aDart,
The best laid plans of mice and men do often
fall apart.
And that Is Just the reason that your coloniz
ing failed
Because one Supervisor just your deep-laid
scheme unveiled.
After the fusion nominee from Sacramento
came, â¢
Hlb head was full of "single tax" to the sum
mit of his brain.
He groaned to think of silver bright that he
would have to give
To be of this great Golden State the chief ex
ecutive.
A popocratlc fuslonlst, a fusion popocrat,
A popocratlc fuslontst, a fusion popocrat;
I'd either be a Republican or lees a Democrat.
But not a measly "mix-up" â  and a fusion
popocrat ,
They call you "Little Giant," but that's a
misfit name;
But you can't help that, can you? Your friends
must take the blame â
They try to keep you thinking that you are
strong enough
To drive straight home your single "tax," but
that is Just a bluff.
A broad Gage line shall span this State from
Del Norte to the south,
A broad Gage line shall span this State from
Dei Norte to the south,
And sweep away the Free Trade talk far from
our glorious age.
And rear a lasting monument to upright Henry
Gase!
It Was a Prost.
A mass meeting of Silver Republicans
was held in Saratoga Hall last
night, which to all outward ap
pearances was a flat failure. Although
bonfires blazed on the corners adjacent
to the hall and a band tooted for a full
half hour in front of the building, the
room was but partially filled and tne ma
jority of those who came in soon left.
D. J. Dexter presided and urged the
cause of free silver and James G. Ma
guire, carefully backing away from the
single tax, which he claimed was not an
issue. Nathan Polk of Los Angeles and
A. J. Ingalls of Oakland made short
speeches on the necessity of a strong or
ganization of free silverltes. 8. P. Hol
land was then Introduced as the speaker
of the evening. He read the Chicago plat
form of 1896, and made a general free
silver soeech.

DEMOCRATS LOSING HEART.
An Advertised Meeting That Did Not
Come Off on Point Lobos Avenue.
The Democratic party is evidently losing
heart in the coming election. To instance
this it will only be necessary to point out
the many cases where fhe single tax
monstrosity has failed to keep it 3 ap
pointment with the people where meetings
were advertised but did not materialize.
During all of yesterday several small
boys were promised an abundance of elec
tion cards if they would hustle about the
base of Lone Mountain and gather a lot
of brush to make a bonfire at the junction
of Point Lobos and Masonic avenues, as a
beacon of light for the wayfarers to come
into "Hefting Jimmy's" net. The brush
was collected and made into a good sized
heap, and when 8 o'clock came a match
was set to the pile. But no speakers
came, much to the disgust of the man
who gave the use of his upstairs livir.K
apartments as a hall and who had ordered
an extra supply of sharp steam beer for
the thirsty crowd that did not come.
Fusion Forces Rally.
OAKLAND, Oct. 28.â The fusion forces
held a big rally at the Tabernacle thi3
evening which was fairly attended, al
though the building would have held a
couple of thousand more. The orator of
the evening was Walter P. Stradley, who
spoke at some length on the necessity for
reform in the expenditure of the people's
money, and incidentally referred to Mr.
Maguire as the man of the hour who
would inaugurate many needed changes
in the State Government. J. Aubrey-
Jones, a candidate for Congress, spoke
of the financial questions. Thomas Scott,
a candidate for the State Board of Equal
ization, made a speech upon the need of
honest men on tho hoard. Several other
county candidates also spoke.

Occurred in the Democratic
Camp Within a

The local campaign has brought forth
many strange things â some of them un
expectedâall of them interesting.
A few weeks ago the followers of
Judge Maguire and Mayor Pheian wer?
shaking hands with themselves and
making preparations to wind up their
private business affairs that they might
be ready to enjoy the spoils of victory
immediately after election. To-day
they are making frantic appeals for
funds and votes with which to down
the "combined villainies." But a short
time ago plenty of men were to be
found who were willing to wager as
high as four and five to one that Mayor
Pheian would be elected. To-day it is
hard to find a man in whom the gam
bling instinct is developed sufflciently
to induce him to commit financial sui
cide by putting up his money on
"Jimmy the Hefter."
And the Examiner â well, that is an
other story, and one that is worth the
telling and to which the attention of
the voters of the city and State is par
ticularly directed. Three weeks ago the
Uxaminer was proclaiming a victoryâ
io-'iay it appears in the guise of a beg
psr, seeking alms from those whom it
has been discrediting 1 . It? latest effort
to stem the tide that is sweeping me
Democratic candidates to defeat is set
forth in the fallowing article published
in us columns yesterday:
The close of the present campaign in
this city and State against the associated
corporations and monopolies represented
l>y the Republican State and municipal
tickets, promises to be cue of the most
exciting in the political history of Cali
fornia. Yesterday the forces making the
for honesty and good government
were strengthened by the arrival in this
city of two of the most prominent crea
tors of p'lblic sentiment and opin
ion in the United States, Ar
thur McEwen and Homer Davenport,
who came from the New York Journal
to join the staff of the Examiner. Neither
of the gentlemen needs introduction to
the readers of this paper, for it was here
that some of the best of their work with
pen and pencil has been done.
The gentlemen are here to take a most
active and vigorous part in the cam
paign, and to dv ail that they can to de
feat the efforts of the Southern Pacific
Company to longer control the politics of
California.
Both Mr. McEwen and Mr. Day n
port are well known and their abilities
in their respective lines is everywhere
recognized and acknowledged. The one
ta a writer and the other a caricaturist.
Taking it for granted that what the
Examiner says about the gentlemen is
true it is to be presumed that Mr. Mc-
Ewen will say, in print, a few kind
words for Judge Maguire. If so, it will
net be the lirst thing he has said of the
single tax candidate for Governor. A
coteparlson of what he has said and
what he will say cannot but prove in
tâ â !â¢. sting, and for the benefit of those
who do not take the trouble to keep
account uf such things Mr. McEwen's
previous utterances concerning Maguire
are here reproduced â for convenience in
future comparisons.
On January 29, 1898. there was pub
lished in this city a letter from Mr. Mc-
Ewen, who was then in New York, over
his own signature, in which the writer
made the following reference to Judge
Maguire:
ker Clubâ it is the thine that fas
bâcontinues to be the most pros
la institution in New York. Its colos
a has helped to swell his ICa-
B head tv the point of bursting.
Among the new members the name of
Representative James G. Maguire of Cali
fornia appears. This will astonish a good
many people in and out of Judge Ma
guire's State. Doubtless he thought it
Bate to follow where Senator Jones of
Arkansas, chairman of the Democratic
National Committee. !<d; but the Senator
Militician who deems it wise to seize
Â» v. ry opportunity to g-f-t a foothold in the
' i â  my'e country and do missionary work
for Bryan and silver. The Judge, how
ever, is more than a politicianâ more than
a silver manâ he is r> vered by the single
tÂ«xers of the T'nited States as or.c of the
foremost disciples of Henry George. That
he should join the gang which crowds
the Fifth avenue shrine to do homage.
fÂ« ial and political, to Boss Croker, whom
Henry George, less than three months
ago, denounced from the stump as a pub
lic enemy, a thief and all-round scoundrel,
whom he would, if elected, do his best
to put in strips. Were Henry George's
son to apply for enrollment as one of
<'rnker's followers it would not be more
strange, more repugnant than this ac
tion of Judge Maguire.
Not even Judge Maguire, who has a
happy faculty of taking credit to him
self from the acts and utterances of
others, could consider Mr. McEwen's
denunciation in the light of a compli
ment. It will be interesting to note
what the talented writer will have to
Bay of Maguire now that he has been
imported from the East to boom the
single taxer's candidacy.
Independent Republicans.
The Forty-first Assembly District In
dependent Club held a meeting at Dewey
Hall, corner of Francisco and Fill
more streets, last evening. Judge Carroll.
Henry H. Davis, Judge Graham, George
W. Collins, Edward Holland, John JLack
mann and Judge Kerrigan made short
speeches and were favorably received.
Colonel John H. Roberts spoke at length
in favor of the absent candidates, and
mentioned all the Republican candidates
fir Â£up<irvisors, and urged the election
of the entire board.
Charles L. Patton addressed the meet
ing and was received enthusiastically.
As hÂ» ascended to the rostrum the band
played "Hail to the Chief." The cheer-
Ing lasted fully five minutes. After Mr.
Pattern's remarks Henry S. Martin made a
fhort address. The Forty-first will surely

UNION VETERANS ARE '
FOR REPUBLICANISM
Men of the Army and Navy League Speak
in Support of President
McKinley.
Metropolitan Hall Resounds With Thrilling Words of Pa
triotism From Men Who Fought for
Old Glory a Third of a
Century Ago.
Patriotism ran dot at Metropolitan Hall
last night, when the men of the Army and
Navy League of California, who fought
through the civil war, met to speak as
they had previously fought for Republi
canism and good government. The patri
otism was touched with sentiment as the
veterans told of the services rendered the
stars and stripes a third of a century ago,
and likened those services to the unselfish
dex-otion of the young men of this country
during the past year. Many well-known
men of the Grand Army of the Republic
graced the stage, while among the audi
tors were many who wore the well-known
emblem of the order. Speaker after
speaker reiterated the stirring sentiment:
"We have heard the long roll calling us
to arms and are falling in to defend the
Republican administration of President
McKinley, which has done so much for
America and for Americans.
Captain W. H. Seaxnana, commanler in
chief of the league, was introduced as
presiding officer. He said:
"Mr. Chairman, comrades, ladles and
gentlemen: This great meeting, as you
know, is held under the auspices of the
Army and Navy Republican League of
the State of California, This organization
is a compact political one, having within
its ranks nearly 6000 active working mem
bers, and I may say fairly represents
more than nine-tenths of the 15,000 ex-
Union veterans in the State, who with
their family connections will cast 20,000
votes at the coming election, place our
friend, Henry T. Gage, In the guberna
torial chair and save the State of Califor
nia to tbe Republican party,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 29. 1898.
"It was my intention to have said a few
words to you regarding the efforts of a
prominent Democratic politician of Los
Angeles County, who recently brought an
action in the courts of that county to
disfranchise the inmates of the National
Home at Santa Monica because a ma
jority of our comrades there are Repub
licans and vote the Republican ticket.
This Democratic statesman is ambitious
to succeeed the Hon. Stephen M. "White
in the Senate of the United States should
by any possibility the Democratic ticket
be successful at the coming election, and
he knew perfectly well that to be con
sidered at all as a candidate it would be
necessary for him to have the backing
of the State legislative delegation from
his own county, and he also knew that it
was absolutely impossible for him to se
cure that delegation so long as the vete
rans at the National Home had a vote;
hence his attempt to rob them of their
citizenship and place them upon the plane
of common paupers. But by the decision
of an upright Judge that incident is
closed for the time being and our com
rades still vote.
"Comrades, grave responsibilities rest
upon you as citizens only less important
than those that rested upon you as sol^
diers of the republic, for you hold the val
ance of political power in the great State
of California; and if you do your duty
now as you did it then and are true to
your comrades, true to yourselves, and
vote as you fought, in the interests of
good government and for your own pro
tection, these Democratic statesnv?n who
are endeavoring to abridge your rights as |
American citizens will be permitted to re
main in private life, the Republican party
will be successful, State, Congressional,
county, municipal and, as far as the State
of California is concerned, the splendid
administration of your comrade, "William
McKinley, will be vindicated and sus
tained. Will you do it?"
At the conclusion of his remarks he in
troduced Eugene F. Loud, who spoke in
part as follows:
"A grave responsibility rests upon the
people of the United States at the present
time, the greatest in all the history of
the Union. This is the time when the old
soldier and the new divests himself of
partisanship and becomes a true patriotic
citizen. There are great questions thrust
upon us by the war which we hope Is
closed, and which will require diplomacy
and tact. Three months ago we could not
foresee the conditions now existing here.
In the spring we wanted to put a stop to
the sufferings of the people of Cuba and
remedy existing conditions there. Since
then we have taken the Philippines and
Porto Rico.
"This combination of parties commend
ed President McKinley and yet it con
demned the Republican party, which is a
part of him and unites with him In pass
ing wise resolutions. San Mateo voters
showed more sense than those of any
other county. They indorsed the nom
inations of the Republican party.
"They are inconsistent in commending
the President at all times and yet con
demning the Republican party for the
conduct of the war when it was in the
President's charge. Last spring journals
were urging McKinley on to Havana! On
to Havana! To that hotbed of death!
Had he sent an army of 100,000 men there
not 5000 of them would have returned
alive. They blame the suffering of the
men to the Republican party. War is
nothing but suffering under the best con
ditions.
"McKinley is to be congratulated for
holding Congress back three months. He
saved many lives. Much was said of the
charge of the Cuban, patriots. There was
only one charge of Cuban patriots, and
that was on Uncle Sam's commissary de
partment. There were not enough Ameri
can soldiers to drive them away from it.
We must caution the American people not
to be misled. We have a patriot at the
helm, and we must support his course.
We will not give him an antagonistic
Congress. We are really fighting the cam
paign of 1900 at the present time. We must
convey back to McKinley the glad tid
ings that we unite in support of him and
will give such a Republican majority as
this State has never seen before."
J. Wade McDonald of San Diego was
the" next speaker. He dwelt on war time
topics past and present, saying: " The
rifle and shotted cannon tf-ere the greatest
of all civilizers." He said the issues of
the campaign were: Shall the adminis
tration of McKinley be sustained by the
American people or shall the flag be low
ered from the great heights to which it
has been raised? Mr. McDonald went a
trifle astray at the close of his remarks.
He forgot himself, and was recommending
his auditors to vote for the wrong people.
He at once placed himself right, amid
much laughter. Â«v__, T â â
While he was speaking Charles L. Pat
ton Republican candidate for Mayor, en
tered the hall and was escorted to a seat
on the platform. He was recognized at
once and the greeting he received was
enthusiastic. This was as nothing to the
demonstration tUflt greated bim when he
was Introduced as "the next Mayor of
San Francisco." He said: "The enthu
siasm with which I have been greeted
convinces me I have a good chance of be
ing the next Mayor of this city. Some
weeks since the Democrats were saying
no one could be found to run against Phe
lan. (A voice â Bosh!) They concede to
day that I have an equal chance. The
support is not altogether for me. but for
the splendid platform of the Republican
party. This gives to all the same privi
leges, treating both the rich and the poor
alike. There are no bosses between me
and the people."
Captain F. J. Cressey of Los Angeles. E.
S. Salomon, Judge A. J. Buckles of So
lano and Majoi T. H. Simpson also spoke.
The latter thrilled the audience with the
fervor of his patriotic oratory.

An insurance and collection agent in Otsego County,

pleasure in relating his own expedience, as follows : " I have
been a sufferer from dyspepsia for a dozen years or more, and
have tried all kinds of medicines that were said to be good (or a
positive cure), but none of them afforded much relief. I hava
always been blessed with a keen appetite and have, perhaps, in-
dulged too heartily at times and suffered accordingly. Last
winter while traveling through an adjoining county I first
learned of Ripans Tabules, and was induced by a friend to try
them. They have done me a great deal of good, and I thinlc
that I have fair promise of a permanent cure. If I would bÂ«

PHELAN'S ASSAULT ON THE SU
PREME COURT.
/"CONSIDERING the quality of his talk, Mayor
( Phelan talks too much. He is better in re-
pose. His recent attack on the Supreme Court
was not only in bad taste, but it showed the Mayor
to be narrow-minded, with a little soul, placing his
own ambitions above the statute, and his desire for
revenge before the dignity of the State's most august
tribunal. The Supreme Court interpreted the law,
Phelan did not like the interpretation and calls for
the defeat of two Judges who concurred in it and
who happen to be candidates for re-election. He
would have the voters work out at the polls his own
petty spite.
Mr. Phelan might have remembered that seven
Justices signed the decision which causes him pangs.
There was no dissent. Among these Justices were
representatives of both parties. There were men who,
learned in the law, have grown gray in the admin
istering of it, and have never before been even in
directly accused of pandering to a vicious element
nor of construing any point with particular reference
to the likes and dislikes of disputants. The vener
able Jackson Temple is a Democrat. He is a man
honored of 'all. Concerning his integrity there cannot
be and never has been question. Yet in his haste
the Mayor condemns the entire Supreme bench. He
could not well logically select any two, pronounce
them unfit, and not at the same time reflect upon the
standing of the others, for the others agreed with the
two.
The Mayor's grievance is over the defeat of his
action to oust the Board of Supervisors. He had
chosen a board so ineffectual and so corrupt that he
wished to be rid of it and have the privilege of nam
ing a new set. Just how pure his motives were need
not here be discussed, but he violated the law, pre
sumed on powers he did not possess, was deteated in
the scheme, and that the Supreme Court said he was
rightly defeated is a fact w r hich rankles, and in
spasms of discomfort he gives utterance to words,
words, words. This is his method of groaning. En
deavoring to assail certain members of the Supreme
Court, he has assailed them all. He ought to have
hefted the consequences in advance.
A FARCICAL PROCEEDING.
AT a meeting of the Board of Election Commis
sioners on Thursday, at which all the members
were present except Auditor Broderick, the
charges of improper and illegal registration made
against certain candidates for Supervisors by Regis
trar Biggy were read and summarily dismissed with
out further consideration.
The whole proceeding was farcical. As soon as the
citations were read Commissioner Block moved to
dismiss, and the motion was agreed to at once. There
was no discussion beyond a statement on the part of
some of the Commissioners that the parties accused
had evidently no intention to violate the law.
The charges against the colonizing nominees was
not that they intended to violate the law, but that
they did violate it. Had the Commissioners con
ducted an examination they would have found that
the violation had been unmistakably made. It was for
that reason the question was set aside hurriedly and
the citations dismissed without discussion.
For an understanding of the farce it is necessary for
the people to remember that among the nominees
cited by Registrar Biggy were five candidates for the
Board of Supervisors who had made the improper
registration at the solicitation of Mayor Phelan or his
backers, and that a majority of the' Board of Elec
tion Commissioners is made up of Mayor Phelan, Tax
Collector Block and City Attorney Gallagher.
Commissioner Block, who as Tax Collector has
been shown to be guilty of stuffing the military rolls
with the names of all classes and kinds of persons
from Chinamen to dead men, moved to dismiss the
charges. Commissioner Phelan, who prompted
the accused to commit the false registration,
and City and County Attorney Gallagher, one of
the Gallagher Maguires, voted to si.stain the dis
missal. What else could have been expected from
such a board in such a case? The only recourse for
justice is the appeal to the people on election day.
An Examiner artist has made the important dis
covery that Charles L. Patton has whiskers. Yet
there are those who think that paper has accom
plished nothing for its side of the contest during the
campaign.
The German Chancellor has just sold 150,000 acres
of land. Possibly he found the task of keeping
cockle-burrs off so large a farm too great a task for
him, as he is getting pretty old.

MAGUIRE'S NEXT FRIEND BARRY.
JUDGE MAGUIRE has recently appealed to
the people of the Fourth District to elect his
next friend, Mr. Barry, to Congress.
This great commercial city should consider well its
interests when it comes to elect a Congressman to
represent it. Mr. Barry is not fitted in any respect
for such duties as fall to a Representative in Con
gress.
His habit of reckless denunciation of men and
measures is not a habit that implies influence over
the judgment of others, which a Congressman must
have to be useful to his constituents.
Last February De Lome, the Spanish Minister at
Washington, was detected in the writing and send
ing of a letter abusive of President McKinley. The |
language used toward the President in that letter was j
grossly abusive.
Barry, in his Star of February 12, indorsed De J
Lome in the following editorial:
"The press has, by some unrevealed means,
obtained a private letter from Spanish Minister
de Lome to a Spanish agent, in which he charac
terized the President as 'weak and catering to the
rabble, a low politician who desires to leave a door
open to me and at the same time to stand well with
the jingoes of his party.' Senor de Lome has cor
rectly outlined the President's character. It is
unfortunate for him as a diplomat that he knows
how to tell unwelcome truth."
Do the people of this city want the man who wrote
that for their representative in Congress?
The Spaniard violated diplomatic decency by insult
ing President McKinley, and was sent home for the
offense. Do American citizens propose now to elect j
to Congress a jack-Spaniard who disgraced Ameri
can citizenship by publicly indorsing De Lome's in
sult?
If they do, they appear as approving the conduct of
De Lome, as admitting that the American people
have elected a "low politician" to the Presidency,
and San Francisco will appear in Congress as vindi
cating the Spaniard and inviting others in like po
sition to insult the President of the United States
with their approval. There are some things upon j
which men of all parties are agreed. The respectful j
treatment of the President by foreign representatives |
is one of those things.
\Ye can imagine no more unfortunate thing for San
Francisco than to indorse De Lome by indorsing
Barry. It is not a question of party, but of patriotism.
If a party nominate a man guilty of conduct so in
sultingly unAmerican, its honorable and high-minded
members should resent it by his defeat.
Barry is begging for Republicans to support him.
Do they have the same opinion of President Mc-
Kinley that De Lome expressed and Barry indorsed?
If they do. their support of Barry will be legitimate
and proper. But we say in all soberness and calm
ness that Barry's offense against his country in in
dorsing De Lome differs only in degree and not in
kind from an indorsement of the President's murder
if the Spaniard had knifed him in the White House.
What influence can such a man have in an Ameri
can Congress? What can he do beneficial to this
great city, which needs so much?
Surely men must be either indifferent to their in
terfsts or frenzied by fanaticism if they support a
man who has so outlawed himself from every legiti
mate sentiment of American patriotism.
REDEEMING THE SEVENTH DISTRICT.
REPORTS from the Seventh Congressioir i Dis
trict show that the Republicans are making an
earnest and aggressive campaign against the
fusion forces of iree trade, fiat money and general dis
content. They are resolved that their next Representa
tive in Congress shall be a supporter of the adminis
tration, an upholder of the great Republican policies
upon whose maintenance the welfare of the industries
of the district is largely independent.
In making the fight the rank and file of the party
have the satisfaction of knowing they are ably and
vigorously led. In fact, it is apparent that in nomi
nating J. C. Needham of Modesto as the Congres
sional candidate of the party the Republicans
"named a winner." He has succeeded in arousing
the enthusiasm of the members of his own party, he
has the favor of the independents, and, accordingly,
is increasing in strength every day.
The strength which Mr. Needham has developed in
the campaign has not been a surprise to his friends
or to the people of his district, among whom he has
long been a notable man. He is still young, being
but 34 years of age, but his career has been steadily
upward from the start, and for a long time past he
has been looked upon as one of the leaders of that
section of the State.
Mr. Needham is a typical Californian. He was
born in an emigrant wagon at Carson, Nev., while
his parents were making their way to California. His
early life, like that of so many successful Americans,
was spent on a farm. Ambitious of supplementing
his common school education by a collegiate course,
he passed his vacations in the work of the harvest
fields to earn money, and devoted his evenings to
study. In due time he entered the law college of the
University of Michigan, and there took rank among
the brightest students.
After graduation he settled in Modesto and began
the practice of law. In a comparatively short time he
rose to a high position at the bar, and was intrusted
with much of the most important litigation of the
district. He soon made himself known not only as
an able and efficient advocate and counselor at law,
but as a man of sterling integrity and of marked
ability for leadership.
Having a public-spirited regard for the affairs of
the State and of the nation as well as for his own
fortunes, he early took an interest in politics. He
first showed his vigor as a campaigner when as a
candidate for the State Senate he heavily reduced the
usual overwhelming Democratic majorities of the
district. Further proofs of his abilities and zeal in
political issues were given by his services as chair
man of the Republican County Central Committee,
as member of the State Central Committee, and by
his work as a speaker and campaigner in every elec
tion since he arrived at man's estate.
With a leader of this quality and approved worth
to direct the struggle, and with every incentive of
patriotism and intelligent self-interest to animate
them, the Republicans of the Seventh feel that they
are making a winning fight. The great mass of the
people are in favor of sustaining the administration,
and the voters of the Seventh will send to Congress
a man who will help the Government to deal with
the problem? before it. instead of fighting it as the
fusion candidate would An if elected.
AS BOSTON SEES IT.
BOSTON, through the medium of the Herald
of that city, has been giving the Eastern sec
tion of the country, and possibly Europe, an
account of the political campaign in this State. It
is an account that merits reading in San Francisco,
partly that we may see ourselves as others see us, but
mainly because of the picturesque variety of Bos
tonian notions contained in it.
The Herald begins accurately enough by saying
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 29, 1898.
the Democratic party in California has nominated as
its candidate for Governor James G. Maguire, of
whom it says: "He is one of the most pronounced
j adherents of the single tax theory of the late Henry
J George, and it is upon this basis he has been nomi
! nated, and upon this issue his campaign is being
fought."
From that point the Bostonian variations upon the
theme follow with rapidity and with brilliance. The
Herald goes on: "California has been for the last
thirty years a land of monopolies, and monopoly on
the part of land-owners who have held real estate for
the purpose of securing the unearned increment has
been one of the heaviest burdens that the Stale and
the people have been called upon to bear. Judge
Maguire makes his professions of tax reform without
any qualification whatsoever, and he hopes to be able
to have elected with him at the same time a suffi
cient number of Senators and Representatives to con
trol the State Legislature, and in this way make prac
tical the reforms he is advocating."
It is difficult to decide whether in that passage the
credit for exceptional vivacity of imagination is to be
given to the portion which depicts the sparsely pop
ulated land of California as being in the hands of
monopolists, or to that which declares the shifting.
evasive, dodging Maguire is making professions of
the single tax without any qualification whatever.
It is not worth while to stop, however, to consider
that point. New variations follow of even greater
dash and sparkle. Describing the character of the
opposing forces in the contest the Herald says: "'The
supporters of the Democratic ticket in California are
the Populist Republicans â that is, those Republicans
who believe the regular Republican party is under the
control of syndicates, railroads and other great
corporations â and the California socialists." It will
be conceded that this creation of such a body of
voters as "Populist Republicans" is about as good as
would be the painting of a white blackbird, but there
is better to come.
The supreme stroke of Boston genius is reached in
this briljiant passage: "The Republican ticket is
supported not only by the regular Republicans, but
by a determined, if not numerous, body of anarchists,
who appear to see in the possible election of Judge
Maguire the success of a movement to place larger
and more important functions upon the Government,
when in their (the anarchists') opinion government
should be deprived of all of its functions, or, in other
words, as a controlling power should cease to exist."
When after this review of our affairs the Herald
closes by saying, "The campaign in California is thus
carried on upon a local basis, but on issues that are
worldwide in their character." w*e feel that we can
say without slang, "Well, we should smile."
WE observe with pain that our esteemed con
temporary, The Non-Partisan, edited and pub
lished by the conductor of the late lamented
Bulletin, at the outset of its career is practicing yel
low politics. We find in volume i, No. i, of our con
temporary the following remarkable specimen of
political rot:
The corporations, bosses, boodlers and "push"
generally appear to be a strong combination, but, on
a liberal estimate, from seven to eight thousand
votes are all that may be credited to that combina
tion. We ask the question, Will the fifty thousand
or more honest, intelligent voters and taxpayers
submit to being ruled by this association of villan
ies, or will they rise in their might and crush out
the dastardly attempt that is being made by the
bosses to stand up this city and plunder it at their
pleasure? Citizens of San Francisco, what say you?
Will you, through Inflifferi-nof and neglect of your
civic obligations, make possible such a condition, or
will you rally to protect the fair fame and best in
terests of San Francisco?
This reads exactly like an ante-election effusion in
an "anti-railroad" Democratic organ. Of course
we do not suspect our esteemed contemporary, The
Xon-Partisan, of any such motive as actuates Dem
ocratic organs in shouting about the bosses, and yet
it is doing politics in the same way and is publishing
the same character of matter. What construction the
peopie will place upon the utterances of a political
newspaper which opens its campaign with such in
sufferable blather as we have quoted remains to be
seen. They may not be as charitable as we are.
In connection with this subject, however, it is per
tinent to address the esteemed Non-Partisan a few
questions. Of the fifty-three candidates who are re
ceiving its support thirty-seven are Democrats who
have been nominated by a committee appointed by
James D. Phelan. Is our contemporary aware of the
fact that all or nearly all of these men have promised
in the event of their election to give their patronage
to Phelan? Can it be possible that the fact has es
caped our contemporary's attention that this patron
age will, if secured, make Phelan the most powerful
political boss the city has ever had? What does our
contemporary mean by referring to the other bosses
in warning tones while actually assisting Boss
Phelan's ambition to eclipse all bosses in political
power?
The Non-Partisan is vigorously supporting sub
stantially the entire Phelan ticket. True, it has a
few Republicans on its list, but they have been named
mostly for unimportant offices. The Board of Su
pervisors with its vast powers, the patronage offices
with their tremendous influence, and the judiciary
with its great strength, have all been turned over to
Phelan and his crowd of autocrats, Fay, Me Nab,
Popper and Braunhart. Does our contemporary
think this is going to promote good government?
As we understand, the objection to bossism con
sists in the fact that it concentrates in the hands of
a single man the power to control the powers of
taxation and disbursement. This leads to corruption,
for the reason that it is human nature to waste and
misappropriate that which belongs to others. What
does The Non-Partisan mean by supporting a scheme
designed to bring this condition about, and which
will place the people of San Francisco at the mercy
of Boss Phelan? Does it think him a saint?
We address our contemporary these questions in
no spirit of idle banter. The Republicans of this city
who have heretofore supported non-partisan move
ments and who are now asked by Deacon Fitch to
vote the Phelan ticket are entitled to have them
answered. The Non-Partisan need not expect them
to vote for its candidates this year unless it justifies
its extraordinary course.
One reason for not attaching importance to the
interview with George Crocker is that it was pub
lished in a paper of such character that the publica
tion constitutes no evidence that the interview ever
occurred.
Populism is not only dead out here, but it did not
experience a pleasing taking off. To be smothered
in the cesspool of Democratic corruption must be a
hard method of departing this life.
Â«
As the campaign advances there is a growing be
lief that a man may wear a silk tat and not have un
der it the quality of brains a Mayor really needs.
If necessity arises for thrashing the Cuban in
surgents, your Uncle Samuel has all the men and
material at command.
PERTINENT QUESTIONS.
THE NIGGErIn THE WOODPILE.
NUMBER SEVEN.
To the Editor of The Call: The power of th, people may be _ used
against the people. This is the dominant note of our system. It s the
cause of all our political institutions. We divide nower because *c are
jealous of power. The true menace to the plain citizen, to you and to me
is not the boss who shares his power with half a dozen other bosses, but
the big boss that may own them all. ,n, n .
The reason why the power given by the people may be used against
the people arises from a very fundamental fact in human nature. TV c are
all looking out for our own interests. Your concern in politics and mine arises
from the desire to protect ourselves. The politician draws a salary, of
course, to benefit his country. He sacrifices himself on the altar of patriot
ism for more than he could earn at any other avocation. We all understand
the value of those statements. Plain people like you and me are birds too
old to be caught with chaff.
One man goes into politics because he can draw a salary from the office
for which he seeks. Another man goes into politics because he is promised
an office by the friend for whom he works. A third man aims for School
Director because he has a big family of girls and he wants to unload them
on the school department. We all understand these motives. Plain peo
ple especially take them for granted. We are made of very plain clay
ourselves and we don't think the Almighty used up all the fine variety in
making politicians.
WHEN A MAN HAS POWER
He naturally uses it to advance his own interests. The Supervisors will
stand by those who stand by them. The Sheriff will give offices to those who
have helped him. The Assessor will not be too scrupulous when it comes
to the valuation of the property of those who have done him a service. This
is a law of human nature, and plain people like you and me are not In the
business of reforming human nature, but of making the best terms we can
with it.
This is the reason why the founders of the republic were so particular
about dividing power. Whenever power is used for the special benefit of
an individual the people are injured. Now there is a constant temptation
present with officials to use political power for their own benefit. The
more power they have the greater the temptation. Therefore the fathers
cut down the force of the temptation by cutting down the power.
Whenever, therefore, we see a man in politics we naturally ask, "What
is he after?" When we find a man grasping, after the control of officials
we inquire, "What has he in view?" When we see that this monopoliza
tion of power is planned on a splendid scale we say. "Surely there must
be a big prize at stake."
MR. PHELAN TELLS US THAT THE BIG PRIZE
Is good government. He says, "I cannot be accused of sordid motives for
I am rich beyond the dreams of avarice. Other bosses have to steal to
get rich; I am so rich that I do not need to steal. Don't believe what you
hear about interested motives. All that may be true of all other men and of
all other times. I am an exception. I have no thought nor wish, no ambi
tion but to give you good government."
Among the chief enemies of good government Mr. Phelan places the
corporations. The plain citizen has no love for corporations unless we
chance to hold a few shares In them or have our money in their bonds.
Then, of course, we may have interest enough in them to find out just
what they are. But you and I are not usually bound by such investments
an 1 we consider corporations merely as things without bodies to be kicked
or souls to be damned. Hence the cry against corporations is a popular
cry. You and I take it up with great gusto and derive much satisfaction
therefrom.
"VVE ARE PARTICULARLY SOUR ON CORPORATIONS
That levy direct taxes on us. Every day we have to pay our nickel or
two to the street cars, every month we have to hand over our coin to the
water company or the gas concern. Direct taxes are always unpopular. In
olden times the tax gatherers did not enjoy the favor of the multitude.
"Publicans and sinners" was the common collocation, and it was not flat
tering. But the idea has survived to our day, only now it might be word
ed, "Corporations and sinners."
But if we take the trouble to examine the composition of these corpora
tions we shall find they are nearly all run by very rich men. The Southern
Pacific Company has been breeding millionaires since it started, and the
directorate of the water company and gas concern is composed of persons
whose estates are as large if not larger than Mr. Phelan's.
Now Mr. Phelan says all these corporations are in politics, and Mr. Phe
lan is an honorable man. By that, of course, he means that these rich men
are politicians. Certainly they are rich beyond the dreams of avarice,
hence they cannot have sordid motives. Other people may go into poli
tics to get rich; certain not the millionaires who have almost reached the
saturation point. They are so wealthy that they can hardly get any
richer. Therefore, if we are to judge them and Mr. Phelan by the one
measure, and Mr. Phelan cannot ask otherwise from plain people like us,
these corporations must be in politics simply and solely because they are
consumed with the desire to give the people good government.
BUT YOU AND I WHO ARE PLAIN PEOPLE
Have thoughts of our own, because we see and mark what goes on about
us. Men who are very rich have oftentimes more trouble in keeping their
riches than in making them. Great estates and wealthy corporations are
shining marks for those who live upon others. We know how politicians
have levied tribute upon such institutions, and when we loudly blame
them for corrupting politics we often say to ourselves that the bribe was
as often given to preserve a right as to perpetrate a wrong. Hence cor
porations are not in politics merely for good, government, but to protect
their interests. These interests are so great that a change that we would
not feel might bankrupt them or double their fortune. Where we pay one
dollar they pay a hundred thousand. Therefore, if they would preserve
their wealth they must keep an eagle eye on the politicians and be ever on
the alert to defend themselves, or to obtain control. .
BUT MR. JAMES D. PHELAN IS NO INCONSIDERABLE CORPORA
TION
Himself. No one knows the exact value of the Phelan estate even in this
city, but every one knows it is enormous. That estate is Just as sensitive
as the estates of corporations to the fluctuations of politics. A cent more
on the tax levy means little to you and me; it means hundreds of thousands
Âf .I. .liars to the Phelan estate. There can be but little fluctuation in the
value of our holdings, but a complaisant Assessor might make quite a dif
ference in the value of Mr. Phelan's property. it is said that Mr Phe
lan once upon a time made statements to an Assessor about his father's
wealth which were not perhaps considered with sufficient exactitude before
he made them. Of course the of his estate may be a secondary
consideration altogether with Mr. I helan in his desire to give us good gov
ernment. But the ordinary citizen that >s, you and I. may well be excused
if we ask ourselves why is he so blamed particular about having his own
Assessor? Yours truly, A PLAIN CITIZEN.

Three dishes are ranged on the hearth,
one containing clean water, another
muddy water and the third is empty. The
young people, blindfolded, are led to the
hearth and they feel for the dishes. If
the clean water is touched by a man he
will marry a maiden; if by a maiden sh?
will marry one never before married: if
either touch the muddy water, then it is
either widow or widower for a partner;
if the empty dish is touched it is a case
of bachelor or old maid.

ARTIST DIXON SCORES
A MARKED SUCCESS
HIS VOLUNTEER CALENDAR
THE HIT OF THE SEASON.
Depict 3 the Citizen Soldier in Action
and Repose as No One Else
Has Shown Him.
The hit of the season has been scored
by L. Maynard Dlxon, a member of 'j..ie
Call art staff. -His United States Volun
teer Calendar for 1899 is pronounced one
of the most notable artistic productions
of its character of the present year. It
deals with the volunteer soldier, and de
picts him in various guises.
Dixon, who is a mere youth in years,
has the heaven-given gift of genius. ius
results are gained in broad effects, as
though drawn by a man brought up out
of doors. He is a protege of William
Doxey. who has done so much to develop
the genius in the young artists and young
writers of the Pacific Coast.
Dixon has caught the spirit and the
movement of the citizen soldiery. Tne
cover shows a soldier and an officer. Both
are full of action. The first page shows
a volunteer apparently on his way to a
transport ship. He is accompanied by a
young woman. One can almost hear the
swish of her skirts, so lifelike does sue
stand out from the page. Others show
the young volunteers in action. A touch
of pathos is added by a scene showing a
man wearing the well-known emblem or
the Red Cross rendering aid to a wounded
Spaniard, although himself wounded.
Mr Dixon is at present enjoying a short
vacation, but will soon return to his duties
on the art staff of The Call.

Improving Precita Valley.
The section over which the Islais Creek
bed had run In former years is now be
ing reclaimed, so to speak, and converted
into neat homesteads for the thrifty set
tlers who purchased property in that
neighborhood years ago. Army street,
which runs in the center of the plat of
the bed of the creek, will have an elec
tric car line in the course of a few
months, while another line will run on
Precita avenue on south. To connect
these two thoroughfares with the princi
pal streets running north and south the
club has had contracts entered into to
have Harrison, Alabama. Florida, Bry
ant York and Hampshire streets gradfi
and filled in from Twenty-fourth to Pre
cita avenue. With this end of the job
finished and Bernal Park filled in and or
namented the valley will be an ideal
spot The?e improvements are due to the
efforts of the Precita Valley Improvement
Club.

The Whaling Bark Charles W. Mor
gan Arrives From the Okhotsk
Sea After a Successful
Cruise.
Another fleet of vessels got in last night.
Nearly all of them reached the Golden.
Gate at an ea.tiy hour, but they would
not accept a. tow as the captains thought
they could sail in. The wind fell light,
however, and after a vuin attempt ax
bi.-u.ting-, the masters gave in about 3:30
p. m. and accepted the services of tugs.
The British ship Falls of Halladale, which
has been outside for nearly a week took
a. tow early in the game and reached an
anchorage during the morning. The
French bark Duchess Anne, seventy-three
uays from Hongkong, the brig Consuelo
from Mahukona, H. 1., the bark Harry
Morse from Seattle and the whaling bark
Charles \Y. Morgan from a cruise In Ok
hotsk Stu were among those which tried
to sail in.
U. T. McMillan, a sailor on the Falls of
Halladale, died on October 13, and was
LurK-d at sea. The poor fellow wanted to
die ashore, and held out until land was
sighted and then succumbed.
The Duchess Anne was so long in mak
ing the journey from China that fears
entertained for her safety. At one
time 30 per cent was paid to reinsure her
c j the gamblers have made another lucky
haul. In this connection the "Bank" line
oi vessels do not seem to be. favorites with
the underwriters. The Duchess Anne was
;y-three days coming here from
Hongkong, and only 20 per cent was paid
on her, while 50 per cent was paid yester
day on the Laurelbank, now out fifty-six
days from Shanghai for Astoria. On the
Sspringbank, which arrived here from
Newcastle, N. S. W., on October IS, after
an average passage, S per cent reinsur
ance was paid, and on the Comliebank,
14* days from Port Townsend for Eng
land, 10 per cent .Was offered and paid
just prior to her arrival yesterday.
The Charles W*. Morgan had a fairly
brings back 1300
barrels of sperm oil, 100 barrels of whale
oil and -AK> pounds of bone. On Septem
ber 7 she was caught in a heavy gale In
the Okhotsk Sea. Her starboard bul
warks and rail wore stove in and two of
the . starboard boats were curried away.
On August 19 the whaling bark California
was spoki d with 740 barrels, and the
Horatio with S4O barrels of oil.
The ship Roanoke arrived at New York
from San Francisco yesterday, and about
the same time the steamer Roanoke ar
rived in San Francisco from Sea'tle. The
latter vessel has been chartered by the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company to
carry wheat from the Sound. The ship
made a smart passage of 102 days from
here. On September 10 she was caught
in a gale in the Southern Pacific. A big
sea which broke aboard stove in the
Wheelheuse and flooded the cabin. A week
later, when off the River Platte, another
gale blew the foresail, the fore and lower
topsails and the jigger staysail.
British ship Galena has been or
to Astoria. About ten days ago

at Howard-street wharf, and as there was
no charter in sight Captain Blair took
her over to Sausalito and laid her up.
A few days ago the order came to pro

WASHINGTON SOLDIEBS SAIL.
The Zealandia Will Take beven Ten
nessee Companies To-Morrow.
The remainder of the First Washington
Regiment, consisting of the First and
Third Battalions, left the Presidio yester
day morning and went on board the
transport Ohio. The troops were under
the command of Colonel Wholley. They
left the post at 9:30 o'clock and were es
corted for a distance by the Fourth Cav
alry band. The two battalions -were given
a cordial send-off by the regular officers
of the post.
Just as soon as the Washington soldiers
had made their exit the companies of tho
Eighth California marched in from Fort
Point and took their place. They com
menced their garrison duty yesterday.
Owing to the fact that the troops did
not get on board the Ohio in time for
her to take advantage of the early tide
the vessel was forced to lay at the sea
wall until 11 o'clock last night, when an
chor was weighed and the transport be
gan her long voyage.
The Zealandia will sail to-morrow with
seven companies of the First Tennessee
Regiment. Orders were sent out to the
Presidio yeseterday to Colonel Smith to
go on board to-morrow morning with
Companies F, C, E, A, B, L and M. The
remaining companies will go on the City
of Puebia, which is to be secured as a
transport. Colonel Long stated yester
day that the Pennsylvania would be
ready to leave by next Thursday. The
Newport is ready now, out will not sail
until the last, as General Miller wants
to see all the troops off before he goes.
General Merriam recently issued an or
der for Private Charles P. Tuthtll, Com
pany A of the Corps of Engineers, to be
sent to the Insane asylum at Washing

back on the Rio de Janeiro. He was sent
here because he was thought to be In
sane. General Merriam has certain evi
dence against the man which leads him
to believe that he is shaming, so he is
sued an order revoking the one direct

Tuthill will be examined here by a board
of physicians, who will ascertain the ex
tent of his insanity before he is sent to
the asylum.

ACTOR FOLSOM
FOLLOWS THE
PERT SOUBRETTE
Left on Wednesday to
Join Miss Thropp.
WAS THE FAIR CLARA'S ANGEL
CONTENTS OF A TRUNK GAVE
THE DOTING ACTOR AWAY.
The Funds Raised In Charity Are
Recklessly Spent in Entertain
ing the Missing
Actress.
At the New Comedy Theater they have
hung out another badge of mourning
and are now wailing the loss of George
Folsom, missing Clara Thropp's leading
man.
Folsom skipped out on Wednesday
morning, and like the fetching Clara,
sent a waiting manager and a matinee
audience a brief note, stating that they
need not expect him to contribute his
share to the programme.
Folsom's absence surprised neither the
company nor the management. In fact,
an atmosphere of direful suspicion hov
ered o'er the leading man since last Mon
day morning, when the greater part of
Miss Thropp's wardrobe was found in his
trunk.
Folsom on leaving the city -went to Sac
ra nifiito and appealed to Wm. J. Jossey,
manager of the "Signal of Liberty," with
which company he was formerly con
nected. Folsom's haggard appearance
and his hard-luck story touched the man
ager, and a subscription was immediately
raised among the "Liberty" people to
enable the stranded actor to purchase
meal tickets and otherwise keep him in
comfort for several weeks to come.
The subscribed money, however, did not
go toward the essentials necessary to
sustain the life of a perishing comedian,
but helped to pay for a soubrette supper
for the missing Clara, whom Folsom had
come on to meet in the Capital City.
It was while hilariously returning from
this supper that Folsom met some of the
"Liberty" people and his real troubles be
gan. The philanthropists traced the re
calcitrant pair to a lodging house near
the Golden Eagle Hotel, and emphatically
and altogether unceremoniously demand
ed the return of their bounty. The money
was returned, iess $1 50 which had gone
toward the entertainment of Clara
Thropp.
William J. Jossey, manager of "Signal
of Liberty" company, now playing at the
Auditorium in San Jose, in speaking of
the matter last evening said:
"George Folsom, who played light com
edy lead in the Thropp company, came to
members of our company Wednesday
evening at Sacramento after the perform
ance and asked us to help him, as he was
without means. Folsom had Just come
from San Francisco, and I suspected that
Miss Thropp was with him. I asked him
if she was and he said she was not.
"With this understanding, we took up a
collection, and raised enough money to
keep him for a while. He went out as
soon as he got it. Shortly after two mem
bers of our company met him and Miss
Thropp together on the street. Our peo
ple are very bitter against Miss Thropp
for the way she treated her company,
and they hastened back to tell the rest
of us that she and Folsom were together.
The company then all agreed to demand
the money thoy had given Folsom, and
asked me to go and get it. I finaJly lo
cated the couple in a lodging-house near
the Golden Eagle Hotel. I told him that
my people had given money .to him be
cause of his former connection with us,
but that under no consideration could
Miss Thropp enjoy any of it. I demanded
its return. I threatened to telegraph his
whereabouts to San Francisco, and he lost
no time in handing over the money. Fol
som then told me he was married to Miss
Thropp."
On Thursday morning Jossey saw Fol
som at the Sacramento depot, and tne
latter asked him to mail a letter that was
addressed to the agent of the . Great
Northern Railroad Company, San Fran
cisco He also requested Josbcv not to
tell any one of his having been in Sacra
mento. Jossey says Folsom. is a very good
actor and until five months ago was a
member of the Jossey-Marvln Company.
He was dismissed from the company in
the Black Hills for insubordination. He
then went East and joined Miss Thropp s
company. He had some money, and it is
understood was playing the part of
"angel" and advancing funds, the com
pany having started out on a "shoe
string" and being in bad financial condl-

who says he is her husband -_._â,._
Miss Thropp says she left Leavitt s
theater because she could get no money
for a week's appearance there. She de
clares she has nothing in her possession
belonging to Leavitt or his manager, El
linghouse, and that the theatrical books
in her possession belong to her The com

she had no contract with Leavitt. She
will go to San Francisco in the morning
in company with Officer Maley and Fol

Car Blockade on Market Street.
The side street car lines and the cab
men did an enviable business between the
hours of 5 a>nd 7 o'clock last evening. The
occasion of such liberal patronage thus
bestowed upon them was the complete
tying up of the Market-strett system
caused by an accident to a car at the
junction of Hayes and Market streets
while switching from the main to the side
line The track was clear down to the
ferry, but when the cars returned tht-ir
way was impeded, until a string of them
reached from Ninth to First streets.

BICMABCK'S PLUCK.
Motley pays Bismarck the tribute,
among others, in a letter to Lady Wil
liam Russell, of possessing the most un- ,
daunted courage. When the Prussians
entered Paris, Bismarck saw that when
the men in the mob recognized him they
scowled at him furiously. He at once
rode up to the wickedest looking one,
asked him civilly for a light for his cigar,
thanked him and received a polite bow in
return. When the late John Morrissey I
saw a "bad man," a gambler who had
threatened to shoot him on sight, stand- 1
ing at the bar of the Grand Union in Sar- ,
atocra, he walked up to the bar quite close j
to him, poured out a tumbler of icewater, i
drunk it, and walked out without once
looking at the man. "In a case of that
kind," said John, in a coarse whisper
peculiar to him, "I always think it best
lo come straight to the front."
So it was with Bismarck, and John was
a bit of a Bismarck in his way; while the
Prince in his younger days was gifted
with tremendous physique and a readi
ness to "box without the muffle." He
gave a fearful tnrashing once in a Berlin
beer hall to a man who wantonly insulted
him. He himself told me that he received
a queer compliment near St. Petersburg
from a Russian Istvochik or cabman, a
very rough fellow indeed, as they all are.
The Prince hired him to take him out of
town to a village near by, paid him with
a handsome gratuity and dismissed him.
The man, however, was dissatisfied,, re
monstrated, and finally became insolent
and even threatening. Bismarck seized
him turned him around, and with one
vigorous kick sent him flying down the
entire flight of stairs. The man got up
and while rubbing himself, glanced at
him not without admiration. "Is naschi,"
he said, "one of us?"â From the North
American Review.

A Fatality Avoided.
From the Democrat, Goshen, Ind.
When neuralgia is accompanied by a
dull, heavy pain near the heart, frequent-
ly becoming intense, it generally termin-
ates fatally. Mrs. Nancy Flynn, who lives
near Goshen. Indiana, survived such an
attack and her advice is worth heeding:
"In the fall of '92." she said, "I began
to have trouble with my heart. There
was a sharp pain in my breast which
became rapidly worse. The doctor was
puzzled and put me under the influence
of opiates. These sharp attacks followed
one another at Intervals and I became
weak and had a haggard look. I was
constantly in pain, seldom slept and had
no appetite.
"At the end of two years I was con-
fined to my couch most of the time and
the doctors agreed mat my death was
only a matter of a short time.

noticed an improvement In my condition,
and when I had taken twelve boxes I was
completely cured. 'Those pills have done
for you what we could not do,' said one
of my physicians, "they have saved your
life '
"That was two years ago and my heart
has not troubled me since. I believe I
owe my life to Dr. Williams' Pink Pills
for Pale People, and I take pleasure in
telling others about them."
Among the many forms of neuralgia are
headache, nervousness, paralysis, apo-
plexy and locomotor ataxia. Some of
these were considered incurable until Dr.
Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People
were formulated. To-day thousands testi-
fy to having been cured of such diseases

HILDRE7H MAY NOT

HUMORED THAT HE HAS SOLD
HIS STABLE OF HORSES.
Said to Have Accepted a Princely Of

Great String of Cracks.
The latest In horse circles i 3 the start
ling intelligence that Sam Hlldreth has
disposed of a portion of his string of
cracks in Chicago and may not send a
stable to race here. The report is also
abroad that he has been offered a big
salary, and has accepted, to train the
horses raced by Sydney Paget the com
ing year. Clawson has already signed to
ride for this latter turfman next season.
Among Hildreth's string is a horse
owned by Bookmaker John Coleman, and
the layer of odds yesterday received a
telegram stating that he, Hildreth, had
sold a portion of his stable and would
turn the balance out, and asking what
disposition to make of the racer. Al
though Hildreth had wired for stalls, this
would, look as if the situation was
changed. Sam is said, on good author
ity, to have cleared $75,000 in the East
with his stable, and can afford to take
matters easy. William A. Pinkerton, who
is interested in the racing venture with
Hildreth, stated last evening that he had
not heard from Hildreth, and the report
may be premature.
Jockey Beauchamp, who rode with con

TUMOK EXPELLED.
Unqualified Success of Lydia EL

Mrs. Elizabeth Wheklock, Magno-

scribes her recovery from a very critiÂ»
cal condition:
" Deab Mrs. Piitkham: â I have been
taking your Vegetable Compound, and
am now ready to sound
den to myself. Was troubled with
smothering spells, also palpitation oi
the heart and that bearing-down feel-
ing, and could not be on my feet much.
"I was growing worse all the time,
until I took your medicine.
"After taking three boxes of Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound
Lozenges, the tumor passed from me.
"My health has been better ever
since, can now walk quite a distance
and am troubled no more with palpita-
tion of the heart or bloating. I rec-
ommend your medicine to all cofferers
from female troubles."
It is hardly reasonable to suppose
that any one can doubt the efficiency
of Mrs. Pinkham's methods and medi-

FRESHMEN IN
FOOTBALL
BATTLE ARRAY
With the exception of the Intercollegi
ate battle of Thanksgiving- day the match
game this afternoon between the frshmen
elevens of Stanford and California' on the'
Recreation grounds is the most important ;
football contest of the season. Since the !
Inception of the freshmen contests in 3894
the interest in this intercollegiate event
has been steadily growing, and now it is
only second to the great contest of the
year. This will be the fifth time that the
youngsters " have measured their â¢ respec
tive strengths on the gridiron and the
honors are even. The winning side this
afternoon will bring to its college not
only the banners of a single victory, but
the reputation of freshman football su
periority.
It ia hard to get a line on the playing of
the California and freshman teams. In
the early games of the season the blue
and gold eleven has shown in much better
form and punished more severely the op
posing teams which both universities
nave met at one lime or other during the
season. The California freshmen have a
good individual eleven, and the team
work is even of a good positive quality,
but there comes a wail from the field of
Berkeley which is full of prescient de
feat. It Is written to the old hackneyed
music of Injuries received on the gridiron
which, while it will not prevent the men
from playing in the game, will bo mini
mize their best efforts that they will be
as other men. : "â¢. â ;,â  :
This is the list of casualties of the Cali
fornia freshmen eleven: Campbell, left
guard, a bad shoulder; Albertsen, right
tackle, a bad knee; KJnsey; quarter, a
severed tongue; Smith, right half, a bad
shoulder; More, full back, a bad ankle.
and Llpman, left half, a most trouble
some knee. Altogether there is a com
posite bad man on the freshman team
which will represent the blue and gold in
the game this afternoon.
From Stanford there is, strange to say.
no such dirge this year. The men are in
good physical condition, but there the
feeling of conteniedness stops. They fear j
the California yourtgsters on account of
past performances, which the cardinal
supporters declare should regulate the
betting. A freshman game is the most
deluding of all events to call. A political
election offers surer signs for prejudg
ment than a game between these young
sters. Last year California scored an
earned touchdown on. Stanford in this
game inside of live minutes. Stanford I
then got the ball and the same thing hap
pened to the other side.
If the work during the season is a test,
then California should win the game this
afternoon. The blue and gold freshmen
have played mu<?h better ball than their
adversaries In the early games of the
season. Still there is that element of un
certainty as to just what progress the
Stanford fillies have made in the last two
weeks, and to how much truth there is in
the reports of injuries to the Callfornlans.
At any rate the game should be an inter
esting one, and on form alone California
should win out. The latest news from
Palo Alto bespeaks a marked improve
ment in the work of the eleven there and
some very good team work in the fresh
man eleven. -. . . . â â ":. â¢â ; '-'â â â ':.
The game last Saturday between the
Olympics and Stanford was full of sur
prises. The Olympics played their best
game thus far and the Stanford their
worst. It was really the Olympics" game, ]
although the single touchdown scored by :
Stanford brought with it a victory for the
cardinals. The clubmen would undoubt
edly have scored twice had they played
with intelligence, and Stanford earned
but one touchdown. It was ill fortune to I
one side and gooa fortune to the other, â 
Except for the one stand made by the
Stanford team, and it was as pretty a
piece of defensive work as has been seen
on a local gridiron In five years, the car
dinal eleven played ragged ball. The
Olympics earned more gains in either half
than Stanford did in the entire game. It
â¢was Murphy's kicking that prevented a
defeat for the cardinal.
The greatest difficulty with Stanford
this year is the development of a center.
The late reports from Palo Alto say that 'â 
James is out of the work there, and this
leaves another weak spot in the Stanford
line. The evolution of a center trio at
Palo Alto is the problem that Cross is
trying to solve. The tackles are fairly
strong, though not as good as they might
be or as they might have been during four
years past. The ends are playing first
class ball, and the backs will be all right
â when they have recovered from their in
juries. Murphy is playing a game this
year that places him well in the fore
ground of quarters. His punting is of an
exceptional order. He is the best in that
phase of the game that has ever been
seen on this coast, and his running is also
magnificent. He is easily the best quar
ter on the coast, and this is not saying
enough, for he combines active intelli
gence with physical ability. He is the
greatest foe that California has this year,
and perhaps the only man to be feared !
on the Stanford eleven.
One. excuse might be given for the poor
showing that Stanford made last Satur
day, and that is that the full Varsity was
not in the line-up. An end, a tackle, a
fullback, a halfback and a tackle were
missing. The practical defeat which the
Olympics administered to the cardinal has
had a good effect on the men at Palo
Alto, for they are now playing with more
vim and spirit. There la an atmosphere
of competition, something which charac
terized the Stanford team in former
years, but seemed lacking in the early
part of this season's work.
At California there have been numerous
changes made in the Varsity. Greisberg
has been put on the second eleven and
Cornish moved into the center position on ]
the Varsity. There has been a general
switching of guards also. In another
week Cochran hopes to be in a position
to decide upon the center men for the
Varsity, at least to form a center for reg
ular play. The final decision will be left
open until a late date in Novemoer, just
before the big game. WhipDle has been
put in at right tackle and Thane Is now
playing quarter in place of Hopper, whose
knee is in a most wretched condition. The
other places are filled up as in the pre
ceding week.
The Olympics are working regularly on
the tan bark. Hobbs is out nightly for
practice, and there is a strong likelihood
that Wells will be found In the ranks be
fore the game with California two weeks
from to-day. Cadwallader may be in the
Olympic line in the game' against Stan
ford next Saturday. ./ith this slant
there would really be no hope for Stan
ford In line play. He rips open the Califor
nia line with ease, and with the support
of such men as Sheehy and Hobbs the
Stanford line would open like swinging
doors for his entrance.
The line-up to-day will be:
California. ' Stanford.

SOME ECHOES FROM
THE GOLF LINKS
The San Rafael Golf Club will know
this evening just what sort of a club
house and grounds they will have for per
manent quarters. The executive commit
tee will irieet in the Hotel Rafael to-night
and decide- upon the plans.
Ground will be broken next week for
the new home of the San Francisco club
house and the work will be carried on as
rapidly as possible. The schedule of tour
naments which was published in Thurs
day's Call will be the scheme of tourna
ments for the season and some very in
teresting days are anticipated.
The league of the four clubs has fallen
through on account of the defection of
the Burlingame and the San Rafael cluhs
but the San Francisco and the Oakland
clubs will still fight it out.
On Tuesday the lady members of the
San Francisco club will hold a handicap
tournament. The entries are Miss Mc-

LNJIEXT SUNDAY'S CALk:
FIELD OF SPORT
GREAT COURSING
AT THE
INGLESIDE PARK
Allowing that horse racing is the so
called sport of kings, it cannot be gain
said that coursing is the sport of queens
as at the great annual meetings in Eng
land and Australia ladies wearing highest
titles attend the great events.
The Queen of England and, in fact, all
of the royal family have been present at
the great meetings, and especially when
the Waterloo cup is run or, rather,
coursed for. Now that coursing has taken
a firm hold in the land of the Golden
West it can fittingly be termed the queen
of sports, judging from the large repre
sentation of ladies who take pleasure in
witnessing the weekly contests.
Readers of The Call (and they are many
among sportsmen) who glanced over the
drawing for Ingleside Park yesterday
could not possibly refrain from saying,
"There is a card that can't be beat," and
certainly a grander aggregation of dogs
than will appear on the coursing sward
;it Ingleside to-day has never entered a
Held of competition. They include native
sons and daughters, foreigners of royal
blood and bucolics from the country at
large. Then apart from the pleasure that
will be afforded the thousands of people
who will witness the contests in the open
and sapling stakes, the Ingleside officers,
who leave no stone unturned that will
add to the sport of poor and rich alike,
have arranged for a grand special cours
ing match to be held on Sunday between
iwo of the fleetest youngsters, represent
ative of the great kennels of America
which are now established on the Pacific
Coast.
Mayflower, that beautiful and promising
young hound, will meet in the slips .the
young Eastern "flyer," Rock Island Boy,
of which so much has been said credit
able to him since his advent wi the Pa
dflc Coast. It should be a grand contest,
and no mistaking the fact. The match is
best three In five courses and the consid
eration is $.rioo. r ioo a side, to wiiich the park
'lded $150, making a grand total of
$1150. which nice little hag of gold will be
handed to the owner of the winning dog.
Leashmen who are desirous of seeing
the run down of the card must not forget
that owing to days which are growing
short coursing will commence on Satur
days at 12 o'clock and on Sundays at 10:30
o'clock sharp.
Any one doubting the success achieved
by the Jngleside Park since Dominick
Shannon and his associates took charge
can dispel all doubt from his mind by a
reference to the amount of coin that is
paid out on coursing days to the owners
of winning dogs. Money talks, and un
less the park was doing a flourishing busi
er.-* it could not afford to give the mag
nificent and costly prizes that fall into the
hands of dog owners. Just think of it!
At the finish of the meeting of to-day and
to-morrow the snug sum of $1960 will be
divided between the winners of the open
and sapling stakes, and $1150 will drop
into the pocket of the owner of the win
ning dog of the match race. This should
be evidence sufficient to make jealous-; the
owner of a thoroughbred racer, who is
lucky ii he can bag $300 or $400 at a race
In the opening stake of to-day, owing to
guards. Royal Buck will meet Victor
King; Flyaway will slip with Marietta
and Rocket and Kerry Gow will come to
g-ether in the run down. Lawrence and
Pet Kirby and Van Kirk and Mira Monte
will also meet. Great will be the sport
and great will be the crowd that will
swarm into Ingleside Park to-day and to
morrow.
The Interstate Coursing Club's meeting
at Merced next week promises to be the
greatest event of the kind ever held in
California. Reports from that section of
the country indicate that the recent rains
have covered the'plains with three or four
inches of grass and that the hares have
been already iffected by the green feed.
On this account, all danger of grueling
courses is obliterated and there will be no
disagreeable dust. A large number of
dogs have already been entered, including
the unbeaten English wonder, For Free
dom Many of the coursing fraternity are
of the opinion that For Freedom will not
be able to stay on the plains: but hie in
vincible speed should return him a winner
in any event. Rosseter has three other
nominations in Santa Alicia, Pocahontas.
and Gallant Foe. Curtis & Sons of Santa
Clara have three nominations, but have
not as yet named their entries. M. Noa
lon has entered his clever bitch Van Clole
and will also run Van Knapp. J. Goldman
of Merced has Sarcastic in, and expects
his entry to run well up in the money. A.
Johnson hashis crock, Mountain Beauty, in
the stake, and has been giving her careful
preparation for the great event. R. E3.
de B. Lopez has Minneapolis, Arrow and
Quiver already entered, and expects to
see the bunch trot well toward the final.
The Yosemite. kennels have three nomi
nations and will name their dogs on the
night of the drawing. They will all be
Eastern importations. Al Austin wi I.'.1 .'. run
Douglas and Glenstone. and expects a
slice of the "long green." Arthur Massey
will have two dogs in. and may make an
other nomination. Russell & V\ ilson or
Illinois pin their faith to Glen Rosy, who,
it is said, is one of the greatest perform
ers on the plains ever brought here from
the East. Tim Cronin claims to have a
mortgage on first money, and says the
only dog in the stake will be his fast and
clever Thornhlll. Black Patti Winged
Foot, Skylark. Crusader and Miss Alice
have already been named, and from ail
appearances the stake will be filled to
the limit. The drawing takes place this
evening at Pythian Castle, at half-past &
o'clock and no doubt one^ of the largest
crowds ever present at a drawing will be
on hand. The advance sale of excursion
tickets has been very large, the low rate
of $4 for the round trip being a great in;
ducement for many to enjoy a few days
outing including hunters as well as leash
men as wild duck and geese are very
plentiful in the vicinity of Merced.
LADIES IN DOUBLES AND
SINGLES TOURNAMENTS
Rarely have the courts of the California
Tennis Club received as much patronage
as during the past week. The fine
weather has brought out the players of
both sexes and some spirited matches
have resulted. On Wednesday afternoon
the ladies played a singles handicap
tournament, which was left unfinished.
Miss Hunter defeated Miss Foster, who
was handicapped 15, in two straight sets,
6-2 6-0. To the surprise of all Miss Mason
played Miss Hoffman for the first place
in the first class, and won out to the score
of 7-5 6-0. Then Miss Hunter met Miss
Mason, the latter giving the former odds
of 15, which proved too big a handicap,
however, for Miss Mason, who lost the
first set, 7-5. The concluding sets will be
played on Monday.
This morningr the ladies will play in a
doubles tournament. The following ladies
will post their names, the teams to be
drawn Just before the tournament: Miss
Mason. Miss Hunter, Miss Bowman. Miss
Eisen. Miss Foster and Miss Chese
brough.
The men have been out in force and
some very fine tennis has been witnessed
on the courts. The football games put a
stop to the Saturday afternoon tennis
tournaments, which will be resumed as
mooo, aa tha erldlron, season la over,
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 29, 1898.
LONG BRIDGE WILL
HAVE ONE
MORE REGATTA
When the skiff and barge races held
in connection with the Independence Day
celebration were rowed at Long Bridge
on July 3 It was believed that the old
familiar landmark would never again be
the scene of a rowing contest. But the
championship regatta to be held at Long
Bridge on November 6 bids fair to be
one of the most notable events .that has
occurred there in recent years. It is un
fortunate that the South End Rowing
Club should have selected the same day
for high jinks at its quarters, as it con
veys the impression that there is a clash
between the South Ends and the regatta
committee.
As regards holding high jinks on thÂ«.
same day as the championship regatta
the South Ends say that it has been their
custom for several years to hold their
jinks at the clubhouse on the Sunday pre*
ceding election day. They have, however.
decided to enter a senior barge crew com
posed of James Pallas, bow; M. Breen,
No. 2; G. Carson, No. 3, and Ed Skully,
stroke. Dr. C. C. Dennis will pull in the
senior skiff and shell races, and J.
Lyons in the junior skiff event. The
South Ends' annual entertainment and
dance will take place at Union-square
Hall on Tuesday evening:, November 1.
Plenty of talent has been engaged, and
a pleasant evening is expected.
The Pioneers are taking a greater in
terest in the approaching regatta than
they have done in any previous one, and
are working enthusiastically to make it
a highly successful affair. To-morrow
the captain will get the crews together
at the boathouse and arrange about the
boats to be used by them.
The Dolphins, who gave a very success
ful ladies' day at their boajhouse on
July 31. proposed to hold another to-mor
row, but have now decided not to do so.
Their twentieth anniversary entertain
ment and reception will be given at Na
tive Sons' Hall on Wednesday evening
next. November 2. The only entry from
the Dolphins at the championship regatta
will be the intermediate crew, which beat'
the Ariel and South End juniors at Long
Bridge on Jufy 3 of this year.
The Ariel Junior crew, consisting or E.
McDonough, bow; A. Haughton, No. 2;
F Loth, No. 3, and E. Lynch, stroke,
has moved into special quarters near the
boattiouse so as to facilitate practicing.
The men go out at 5:30 every morning,
and again in the evening under the coach
ing of J. R. Bockman. The Ariel inter
mediate barge crew is made up thus: H.
Wilson, bow; J. McKenna, No. 2; G. Stef
fens No. 3, and J. Wilson, stroke. They
have been rowing regularly since the
Guerneville regatta and are in pretty
good trim. The new barge, the seats and
rudder of which required some alteration,
was delivered a day or two ago. J. No
lan will get a senior barge crew to
gether but, as it is not yet made up, its
chances of winning will not be very good.
Fv Wilson and G. W. Phelan will enter the
senior skiff race, and J. McKenna and J.
Fickert the junior event. It is possible
that William McAusland may row in a
shell but he has had little or no practice
lately. H. Wittkopp also may enter the
shell race. The Ariels gave their annual
reception and dance at Union-square Hall
on Thursday evening. It was very well
attended.
At a meeting of the Olympic Boat Club
held last Tuesday the following officers
were chosen for the coming season: Vice
chairman. J. O'Connor; captain, George
James; vice captain, H. Collins; .secre
tary, Jesse Godley; executive committeeâ
Frank Grim, L. Pockwitz and John El
liott. The Olympic Club, has promised
vliat JÂ£ the boating men. .will bring in
thirty new members It will hand over the
initiation fees to the rowing people, who
will apply them to the purchase or a
new barge. , ,
At the last meeting of the Alameda
Boat Club A. H. Neustadter and W. Has
kins were elected to membership, me
club will enter a senior and a junior barge
crew and a skiff man.
TRDCKBE RIVER IS NOW
FREE FROM OBSTRUCTIONS
This will be the last month of the sea
son for anglers who take a pleasure in
whipping streams for trout, but accord
ing to the way the law roads steelheads
(which are the king of fresh water game
fishes) may be taken with rod and line
in tide water.
Last winter the grandest sport imagin
able was had on Russian Kiver when the
sfeelheads were ascending the river on
their journey to spawning beds. Owing
to light rains and low water the fishes
were landlocked in the deep pools near
Duncans Mills, and as a consequence the
angler did not have to resort to many
fancy devices for their capture. It is
to be hoped, however, that a goodly sup
ply of rain will raise the stream this year
as another dry winter would result In in-
calculable damage to the country at large.
Angelrs can well afford to lay back
"on their rods" for a few .winters and
discuss the grand entertainments they
had last winter on Russian River.
The striped bass Which promised no end
of enjoyment to anglers who take pleas
ure in "still" fishing, have disappeared
from their feeding grounds in the Oak
land estuary as mysteriously as when
they came. The fishes are roamers, and
to locate their whereabouts anglers must
be out on prospecting trips continuously.
C. A. Vogelsang, one of the deputies in
the office of the Pish Commission, has
recently returned from a trip to the
Truckee River, where he removed half
a dozen obstructions from that stream,
so that the fish could have the full run
of the river. Many years ago the lum
ber men built large dams across the river
so as to make a catchment for the logs
cent down from the side hills in the log
chutes. Now all of the timber is stripped
from the mountains contiguous to the
stream and only a small second growth
marks the place of the forests. Tne mill
men have had to go far back into the
mountains, and hence the dama are of
no use to them. More than that, the Leg
islature of Nevada has taken hold of the
fish preservation question and has aided
the California commission greatly in Its
work.
The reason for the interest of the Cali
fornia Commissioners In the future of the
Trucker River is because Its headwaters
are the finest in the State for trout.
Mr. Vogelsang and a party of four men
worked for several days blowing up the
obstructions with giant powder, for the
dams were built of large logs and so
well put in that it was impossible for
a trout to get over or around them. A
short time ago Commissioner Gould visit
ed â  the Truckee and induced the lumber
men on the lower end to place fish lad
ders in the stream around their dams.
Since Mr. Vogelsang's work is finished
the river is now open from Pyramid Lake
to the very headwaters and It is believed
that the right of way will be productive
of good results In the near future, as
the large mykiss native of Pyramid Lake
will ascend the stream and that will
mean sport ad libitum.
Estate of Le Grand Morehouse.
Mrs. Clara Morehouse applied yesterday
for special letters of administration upon
the estate of her late husband, Le Grand
Morehouse, who died on the 22d Inst. The
petitioner states that the exact character
and value of the estate is unknown to her
except that it will exceed $10,000. The only
heirs to the estate are the petitioner, her
son, Frank L. Morehouse, and her daugh
ter, Morono Morehouse.
EASTERN PLAYERS
SHOULD
NOT BE BARRED
What a great number of "star" ball ,
players arrived in our midst within the i
past week, and what an elegant team â 
they would make. If they could be pre- j
vailed upon to unite. I am afraid, how- :
ever, that such a club would be too strong :
for any collection we might gather from j
the talent now representing the Pacific j
Coaet League; yet am strongly of the ;
opinion that a team could be got together
which would, in all events, give them
a good strong game, and one that would
be worth seeing.
There has been some talk among the |
new arrivals regarding the formation of
& team to be used for exhibition purposes
only, and as every one Is over anxious
to see these men of such great reputa
tion, I have no doubt but what such an
enterprise would be a howling success.
For the good of baseball on this coast,
however, I sincerely believe that it would
be more profitable and acceptable a prop-
osition for the Pacific Coast League to
dispense with that rule which prohibits
these Eastern stars from displaying their
ability in the regular scheduled league
games.
From its very infancy there has been a
scarcity of good talent. Nearly every
ball player available in this State and
Oregon has been given a chance, and
while from among them some very good
players have materialized, yet it is use
less for any one to say that there is not
room for improvement.
Every team in the league could stand
another good man, and some of them,
goodness knows, could stand eight or
nine. Would it not then, in view of this
fact, and in conjunction, of course, with
the other many advantages to be gained
by such a move, be a good Idea for the
directors of the league to open its doors
to these brilliant manipulators of the
horse hide. I think so, and those with
whom I have discussed the subject agree
with me. They say it would boom the
game "out of sight," and as they pay
their little quarters regularly at the gates
of Recreation Park, some little consid
eration should be given them.
It would be an easy matter to distribute
Lange. Hughes, Mertes, Reitz. Chance,
Beckley. Irwln, McHale and Van Halt
ren. Give each club a man, and then let
the weaker team have the preference In
taking those two players who will neces
sarily be left over by an equal division.
No team can then complain; all will
profit by the scheme: the fan's will whoop
er up as they never did before; and
those ever welcome 25-cent pieces will
simply pour in. And then again these
Eastern men will improve the style at
play. Their coaching, particularly dur
ing critical situations, will be of invalu
able service; their presence will even give
a tone to things, and a bit of this will
make us all feel like somebody. I would,
therefore, suggest that the league call a
meeting and have these players signed
at once. Good players are needed, and
such an elegant chance to secure them
should not be overlooked. '

TIBURON YACHTS
SEEK
WINTER MOORINGS
The Pacific Yacht Club, in spite of a
splendid array* of officers, including an
admiral, a commodore, a fleet captain, a
fleet surgeon and several others, in all
amounting to the unlucky number thir
teen, seems destined to come to an end
at no very distant date. It has suffered
from a superfluity of officers and a de
ficiency of yachts. Admiral J. D. Spreck
els' fine schooner Lurline, Commodore E.
A. Wlltsee's schooner Aggie, Vice Com
modore Martin Roberts' schooner Azalane
and W. S. Good fellow's schooner La Pa
loma, all of which are also enrolled in the
San Francisco Yacht Club, with a launch
or two, constitute the Pacific fleet. Suit
has been brought, in the interests of the
bondholders, to foreclose the mortgage
on the club property, which will doubtless
be sold. The Pacific Club was originally
founded by certain seceding members
from the San .b'ranciscos, and when the
San Francisco Club house was burned
two years ago there was considerable
talk about amalgamating the two cluds,
but no definite arrangement was ever
reached.
Last year the club gave an order to
ISngelbrecht, the boatbuilder, for six non
capsizable half-raters, for which $150 each
was to be paid. The boats were lightly
constructed, so that the weight or. the
iron shoes caused the seams to open.
They were constantly in need of repairs
and were a source of continual expense
and worry. During the season of IS9S
there were to have been five races for
the half-raters, and Herbert Law, form
erly commodore of the club, offered a
silver cup to the boat winning a majority
of the races. Later, finding that no races
took place, he withdrew the cup and pre
sented it to the Pacific lnterclub Yacht
Association, by which it was awarded to
the yacht in the twenty-foot speciai class \
â¢making the best time over the special
course at the Admission day regatta.
The Pacific Club was remarkable for
the beauty of its clubhouse and grounds,
the fewness of the boats enrolled in it,
the wealth of several of its members and
the size and costliness of their boats.
But the failure of the Pacifies and the
success of the Corinthians prove that
yachting is not a rich man's sport in San
Francisco Bay. The summer weather is
too rough for luxurious yachtsmen, and
many parts of the bay are too shoal for
large boats. Owners of handsome, ex
pensive yachts manifest less club spirit
than the owners of moderate-sized or
small craft. They seldom join club cruises
and rarely enter regattas.
The San Francisco Yacht Club will hold
a minstrel entertainment on Wednesday
evening, November 16, in Native Sons'
Hall. Vice Commodore G. T. S. "White
will keep the sloop Will o' the Wisp in
commission for some time longer, and
during the winter will lay her up in a
sheltered part of Hurricane Gulch, which
is protected -from the nortKerly and south
easterly gales that occasionally occur.
The schooner Vine, which has been en
gaged in trading in the South Seas, is
anchored off the San Francisco Club
house. Her captain, J. E. Burns, is a
member of the club. Commodore E. A.
Wiltsee of the Pacifies intends to make
the San Francisco house his headquar-
The drawbridge at Tiburon will be
opened to-morrow at about 11 o'clock in
the morning, and most of the yachts and
arks will leave the cove and seek safe
winter moorings in the lagoon. K. Dono
hoe's Speedwell will be taken up to Lark
spur and the sloops Truant, Aeolus and
probably the Nixie will not go into the
lagoon. The Aeolus will be allowed to
dry out, and will then have her seams re
calked. Already the Corinthians, who
have no sooner had one jollification than
they begin to look forward to another, are
talking of their New Year's day dinnerâ
the thirteenth. .
The Encinals have just concluded their
billiard tournament, in which Thomas
O'Connor won the first prize and G. T.
Wright the second. A bowling tourna
ment, with contestants of oth sexes, is
now in progress at the clubhouse. Cap
tain Taylor, in the yawl Emerald, and J.
Ives and Captain Lancaster, in launches,
recently went on a hunting cruise to Al
vjso the Encinals propose to hold a
closing day next month md to give a
P The Californias hold their closing jinks
for members and crews to-night at the
clubhouse, and to-morrow will make tne
final cruise of the season. The South Bays
closed last Sunday.

GRAND OPENING
OF THE
RACING SEASON.
The opening of the California raÂ« â¢
season will be celebrated at On
track this afternoon. The card is an â  ,
cellent one. It Is. perhaps, the best e\ -
offered a race-going public in thi
tion of the country the first day of a.
meeting. The Eastern candidate
Western coin have been tardy th^
son in arriving, and in this respect the
sport may be somewhat devoid of senti
ment. Glancing over the list of en
appear the names of the best hor
training, and the opening day should be
a most successful one.
Joseph A. Murphy and John J. Carter
will officiate in the stand, and diaries
Price, a sterling racing official of Louis
ville, Ky., will fill the newly create.!
tion of chief racing steward. Everything
possible to insure honest racing ha.
done.
The Opening handicap, over one mile,
is the star feature of the programme, an i
so evenly adjusted do the weights look:
that it appears as if every starter in tha
race will be in receipt of more or Ipt-s
support. The other four events tilled be
yond the must sanguine expectations.
J. B. Ferguson will do the starting
he has decided to discard the rubbtr
tubing barrier, using the Australia:
in preference.
Among the new innovations adopted -will
be that of compelling exercise boys to
don the colors of the jockey club, black
jacket with orange cap, when wurming
up horses prior to the races in which th>-y
may be starters. Toe number of th' ,
on the programme will appear on th<s
back of the jacket. This idea ori
with PM Hopper, secretary of the \\
Turf Congress*.
The gay and festive bookie will be on,
hand in profusion. From the- outlook last
evening it was considered certain that ttia
following firms would <ut in: Bill Jack
1 man, Phil Archibald, Jack Atkin.-
Ridley, John Humphrey. Hurlick. I
& Co.. J. K. Willis. George Oxnard, Wal
ter Riggs, Hugh Jones, Johnny Col
Marsh Redon and the Prussia Club. .
The familiar face of Ed Conroy will
again be seen chalking up prices on o:ia
of the field books.
J. Frederick, a layer of odds well known
throughout the East, is apt to br<\-ik q
to-day.
Tom Boyle got in at Oakland trai :
terday from Sacramento with a string f
ten horses. Tom gained considera-ble re
nown some years ago as tlif> trainer of tha
mwsiral horse Banjo, which gelding oft> n,
got the "plunks."
"Virginia" Carroll, considered by all t!.<*
most versatile man in the business, was
due to arrive last night. Carroll has
heard much of the bad men of the West,
and if he eoncludps to weigh in this af
ternoon, will appear on the block clad in
a sheet iron Prince Albert, a woven wire
waistcoat and pair of barbwire panta
loons. With his head incased in a base
ball mask. Mr. Carroll thinks he will ba
fireproof from thf assaults of those who
may object to his outburst? of raillery.
Harry Frolich will probably accompany
him.
W. G. Wilkins. sheet writer, and Joe
Russell, ticket writer, the "old guard"
of George Rose's booking crew, got In
from Chicago Thursday night. Both look,
hale and hearty and say that Mr. Rose
will leave for California to-morrow.
Timer Dick Havey yesterday purchased
a rarp old bottle of Italian olive oil. and
now has his chronometer ready for thÂ©
opening- race this afternoon.
Jim Davis will make th<* poolroom book
for Bart Kavanaugh at Sacramento.

BITTER WORDS
A Hot Time Before the
Supervisors.
IT WAS NEARLY A FIGHT
FBAUD AND FAILURE, MEDDLEB
AND HYPOCRITE.
All Over the Question of Purging
Bacon Place and Belden
Street of Immor
ality.
At a meeting of the Committee on
Health and Police of the Board of Super
visors yesterday the resolution instruct
ing Lee 6to close the disreputable houses
on Bacon place and Beldcn street was
under consideration, having been referred
to the committee by the Board of Super
visors on October 24.
The Chief of Police had been invited to
be present so as to express any views
which he might have on the subject.
There were a number of other persons in
attendance, including Rev. Father Otis,
George D. Shadburne and Frank J Kane,
representing the citizens interested In
closing the dens. Attorney Emilio Las
treto appeared for the property owners
of Bacon place. Supervisor Smith, who
was present, recommended to the com
mittee that it should approve the resolu
tion. Mr. Shadburne then made a short
address, stating that Bacon place and
Belden street, are public thoroughfares
and asking that the resolution be adopt* d
and the Bacon place gates ordered re
moved.
Attorney Lastreto offered some objec
tions to this programme, claiming that It
Was impossible to suppress the social evil,
that segregation of the women into colo
nies was preferable to scattering them all
over the city.
This statement brought Father Otis to
his feet with the declaration that such
only emanated from the devil. "The
facts are these!" exclaimed the :
"young girls are inveigled into those dens
on Bacon place and ruined: I have posi
tive evidence concerning three French
maidens who were recently brought to
this country under promise of obtaining
work in restaurants and were then taken
to one of these places and imprisoned in
a room until they consented to lead im
moral lives. That is the sort of work
â¢ 'ing on then ! Again, the St.
Marys Park Association is hampered in
The condemnation of
â¢ rty for the proposed park by the
presence of women in the dives. The
owners of the property receive enormous
rents from it at present, and when con
demnatlon suits are suggested they claim
that absurd prices should be given them
for their real estate, quoting its profits as
an illustration of its value. This is all
wrong. It might as well be said that any
buil.'.ing where crime is fostered
more value in the eyes of the law than
a that are used for the conduct of
legitimate business. We want those
Bacon place dens cleared of women, and
then ' condemnation proceedings for the
park can be brought on a fair basis of
values. "
Chief Lees had been an attentive lis
tener tn the remnrks made by the various
speakers, and, unable longer to maintain
silence, broke out. "I don't take kindly
to crit: isms." he declared, "and I object
me that have been made of the Police
rtment. In cuse this resolution Is
by the Supervisors, I shall use
my judgir. - legality and enforce
it only if I then see fit. I object to the
closing of the houses on Bacon place It
simply means the scattering of disrei>uta-
Ile women all over the city. The evil ef
â¢>f running them out "of Berry place
and other localities are already " mani
fested in heretofore respectable portions
cf the city where the women have taken
1 am of the opinion that these
women should be colonized, and in that
way kept better under police control. As
for that. fellow Kane, who represents the
â¢ for the Suppression of Vice, I
have Hothi: say. He isn't lit to
anything to do with virtue, inside
of a church or without. He needs re
forming himself. He's a meddler and a
hypocrite."
Kane was just entering the committee
room when Lees -closed his vituperative
remarks and arose to depart. Friends of
the former toW him in a few words what
the Chief of Police had said, and In a ,
moment there was an exciting scene.
"Hold on there. Lees!" exclaimed Kane. ,
"I want you to hear what I've got to say
about you. It shall not -hind ,
:>ack. as your contemptible remarks
about me were hind mine. I
want you to uti that the citizens
of San Francisco regard you as a fraud
failure, and are disgusted with your
lack of Interest in the suppression" of
crime. The thieves and murderers laugh
at you. The keepers of d>>ns slap you
familiarly on the back. Aren't you a
POSTUM CEREAL.
COCOANUT MILK
Used in Place of Coffee for a Time.
Some years ago I was one of a col-
ony located in Costa Rica, a coffee
growing country, and was finally made
so ill by continued use of the berry
0. S. BILLINGS,
Hico, Texas.
that I took to cocoanut milk, and
thereafter noticed that I suffered con-
siderably less than the others from
fever, chills, etc.
Since returning I have been using
Postum.
We have abandoned the use of cof-
fee and tea altogether, and never ex-
pect to use them again as long as we
can have the Posium Food Coffee.
We know how to make it into a de-
licious beverage, and the difference in
our health is so marked that we shall
never return to the old way. We have
been compelled to send up to Waco or
. Cleburne for Postum, as it has not
been kept here, but, while the extra
expense is something, we do not con-
sider it sufficient to keep us from hav-
ing our "cup that cheers."
By the way, the Rev. C. H. Rogers
of Elgin, 111., has been bo greatly
helped by the use of Postum, to my
I knowledge, that his praises for it will
do you a world of good. Our whole
family is in love with Postum. j
pretty specimen to abuse other people?
1 tell you again that you are a fraud and
a failure as Chief crt Police." And Kane
accompanied his remarks By leaning over
the committee table and shaking one of
his long fingers in Lees' face.
The latter was white with rage, and for
a moment it looked as though the two
men would come together in^a personal
encounter. Chairman Delarfy pounded
vigorously with his gavel to restore order,
and finally Lees retreated from the room.
Ap soon as order was restored among
the excited spectators Devon y made a
motion that the resolution closing the
dens be laid over. The other two mem
bers of the committee who were presentâ
Delany and Riversâ voted in favor ~f tnis
motion, and the proposition to purge Ba
con place and Belden street was virtually
shelved It is understood that the com
mittee will not report on the resolution
either way, thus quietly kiliing it off. \lne
n^xt Board of Supervisors can reopen the
question if it sees fit.
Father Otis was very murh disappointed
at the action of the committee, and was
especially incensed at the remarks made
I lef Lees. He stated before leaving
the committee-rooms that the dens would
be closed despite all opposition, as the citi
zens were prepared to push an aggressU o
campaign by prosecuting fhe Â£lye owners
and occupants in the Police Courts He
declared that numerous arrests would at
once be made by the officers of the So
ciety for the Suppression of > ice.

i money was paid. When confronted with
admitted that she wrote
!it and confessed that the testimony on
which Rhyne waa convicted was abso
false. The confession led to the se
curing of affidavits from the girl and oth

show absolutely that Rhyne was guiltless
of the crime of which he was convicted.
A petition Betting forth The facts has

morrow, when the individual champion
ship will be decided. This event, which
was won by Bayard of Prince

viving players of the twenty-four who
began the contest yesterday are from the
New Haven University. These are W.
B. Smith, the runner-up in the recent
amateur championship, and John Reid
Jr. From a college standpoint it matters
little who wins, but as Smith is from

the West's view that creates the interest
on the result.
When play was resumed this morning
there were "eight players for the eligible

FLOAT COPPER FOUND

Golden Gate of San Francisco and C. C.
Cht-rry of Seattle arrived last night from
the mouth of Copper River, Alaska, with
â¢ -ngers. Among them was M.
J. Garrmy of San Francisco, who has
spent more than a year in a vain search
for gold on Copper River. Ho says:
"Native- float copper has been found
on Chitna River, 175 miles fron. the south
of Copper River, and a party of fifteen
will remain there over winter to prospect
for the main copper deposit."
Nicholi, known as the "Talking Chief"
of the Copper River Indians, claims to
know the exact location of a copper de
posit, but he refused offers of several
hundred dollars to guide people to its lo
cation. The Indians use copper for mak
ing bracelets and other ornament.- jus
well as for cooking utensils, and the chief
claims that the whites will limit the sup
ply and thereby deprive many Indians of
the means of making- a living.
On board the Golden Gate is a Copper
River prospecting boat, which was built
of lumber whipsav.^d on the river. The
boat is being shipped to Denver. Colo
whene it will be placed on exhibition.

UNITED LABOR
PARTY A GILT
EDGED GRAFT
Grace's Indorsements
Paid Profits.
CONFESSED ONE * DIVIDEND
"SWORD OF DEMOCLES" HAD AN
EDGE TO GBIND.
Barclay Henley's Agent Said His
Man Was Unpopular and Needed
Grace's Potent In
dorsement.
The taking of evidence on the petition
of the United Labor party for a place
upon the ballots of the next election was
continued before Supreme Court Commis
sioner Chipman at 10 o'clock yesterday
morning. All of the witnesses introduced
were subponaed by the respondent, and
their testimony went to prove that most
of the names of alleged electors attached
to the Labor party's petition were cither
forged or disqualified for other sufficient
reasons.
Among the first witnesses to appear
was Fred D. Siebe, who testified that he
had paid to Grace $100 in the name of i
John D. Siebe for the indorsement of i
Grace's alleged party. To prove his alle- !
gation that the money so received for in- '
dorsements was intended for the personal |
use of Grace and his satellites, Garret Me-
Enerney, for the respondent, called that
person to the stand. Without much hes
itation Grace acknowledged that Mr. '
Siebe's hundred dollars had been divided i
as follows: Grace $50, John Hayes $20, P. I
H. Norton $10, F. A. Seaman $ld.
Henry N. Clement, Republican candi
date for Superior Judge, testified that he
had been approached by Grace for a con
tribution of $100, but had declined to give I
up. Grace finally wanted to compromise
for half, but his offer was declined. Grace
also broached to Tim Treacy a proposi
tion to indorse Maguire if $500 were do
nated, but the Democratic Committee de
clined the honor with nothing more than
I thanks.
Numerous witnesses were introduced i
j who had been engaged by Grace to gather
names to his numerous petitions at a
wage of 2 cents per name. They all testi
fied to having received signatures wlth
1 out ascertaining for themselves whether ;
I or not the signers were qualified.
The afternoon was taken up for the i
moat part with the same class of wit- i
nesses. The most important testimony I
was that rendered by S. M. Williams, who
stated that he had the honor of being pri
vate secretary to Mr. Grace. Being asked ;
I what need Grace had of a private secre- '
| tary the witness answered that for two ',
I months there were at least from six to
eight letters daily to be answered, and ;
I this duty devolved upon him. Mr. Wil- .
I Hams rendered competent testimony upon '
the numerous more or less successful
touches that Grace had made upon differ
ent nominees.
He told at length of how Barclay Hen
â¢ ley, "The Sword of Democles." had sent !
an agent to find out how much it would,;
cost to have his edge sharpened by the
Indorsement of the Labor party. "The
â  --ailed upon mo," said Mr. Williams,
"and told me that he wanted to see Mr. i
Grace about getting the indorsement off
the party for Barclay Henley for District
Attorney. He said that Mr. Henley, he
thought, had a hard fight, for he was not j
what you would -call a popular man. He I
said he thought the indorsement of the !
party would be of value to him. I told !
him "that, though I was Mr. Grace's secre- 1
tary, 1 could not speak for him. but I !
thought Mr. Henley could get the indorse
ment for from $7. r i to $100. He said he
would see Grace about it."
I>r. William Foster, who has an office
at 1069 Market street, was shown what !
purp -rted to be his signature attached
to one of the petitions. He declared the j
signature to be a rank forgery.
"Walter Higgins, a bricklayer, who had
circulated one of the petitions, was shown
bis supposed signature attached to the
affidavit in which the genuineness of the ,
petition was sworn to. He said ti*e slgna- ;
tu re was not his, but that it had been
signed with his permission by a man
named Glynn. who had assisted him in ;
circulating the petition. Higgins further '
stated that he had gathered most of his |
names by Standing in a Fourth-street sa
loon and' catching people as they came in.
He signed them without knowing whether
they were on the register or not.
Charles Chadwick testified that he was.
for the four weeks of its existence, the
editor of Grace's labor paper, known as
"United Labor." "I was not a regular
member of the gang," said Chadwirk,
"and wasn't much on the inside, but when
I told Grace that I wanted money for my i
expenses he told me to wait a few days, j
that a number of the candidates had prom
ised him contributions. He also told m>?
that he was to receive a large sum of
money from a certain person for the in
dorsement of a whole ticket. This was â 
before the Labor party's ticket was filed
in Sacramento."
A number of witnesses followed who
had all been engaged by Grace as solic
itors, and their evidence was practically
the same as was given by previous wit
nesses of the same class.
Before Commissioner Chipman contin
ued the case until 10 o'clock this morn
ing. General Hart informed the court
that he would like to have it prepare
findings upon: 1. Whether the affidavits!
were signed by parties purporting to have
signed them? 2. If there were forgeries?
He also submitted that the court could
not ratify the statement of Mr. Biggy,
and that the papers of the petitioner
were not In proper form and had not
beÂ»n legally returned by the Registrar,
as provided by law.
Mr. McEnernoy submitted that Grace is
not the chairman of the United Labor
party that there never was a political
party of that name as alleged by him.
that Grace is not a party in the case, and
that his petition does not contain the
names required by law.
t'pon these points, the court stated. It
will prepare findings with as little delay
as dps si pie.
MYSTERIOUS MURDER
OF AN UNKNOWN MAN
Found in a Lonely Pool With Every
Means of Identification Care
fully Removed.
PEORIA. 111., Oct. 28.â The body of a
young man has hern found lying partly
in a puddle of mud on' a lonely road seven
miles above this city. It was well dressed.
There was no mud on the polished shoes,
showing that the body had been carried
to the spot and thrown out of a vehicle.
There are two bullet holes in the head,
both entering from behind.
Every particle of lettering had been cut
from the linen and clothinÂ«r. Near where
the body was :ound a small camp fire was
smoldering.
Inquiry at the notels here throws no
light on the matter. The Coroner found
tattooed on the man's right arm the let
t< r=Â« "M W" and a heart. The collar bore
the marks "J. L.â - 4," The clothes were
of fine texture and tailor made. The feet
and hands indicate that the man had
been accustomed to luxury.
SWALLOWED A SAFETY PIN.
Suisun Infant Suffers for Months
Before Believed.
SUISI'N, Oct. 28.â About six months ago
the infant child of Mr. and Mrs. William
S. Morrill. well-known residents of Suisun
Valley, swallowed a small-sized safety pin
and for days the life of the little one was
despaired of. All efforts to alleviate her
acute pain proved unavailing. The baby
was taken to San Francisco and subjected
to an X-ray examination, which failed to
locate the eafetv pin, and the parents'
story was regarded a3 a rather uncredl
ble one. At intervals since that time the
child has nearly succumbed to convul
sions. On Wednesday night the cries of
the little sufferer aroused the parents and
the cause of the pain was located. Medi
cal 'aid was summoned and the dangerous
pin was removed with the aid of instru
ments. The child is now doing well.

LOST TO SPAIN
Situation as Viewed by
Agroncillo.
NATIVE EMISSARY WRITES
PBOBABLE BESTTLTOFTHEPABIS
CONFERENCE.
Confident That the American Peace
Commission Will Never Sur
render the Eastern
Archipelago.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 28. â Senor
Agoncillo, the personal representative
and envoy of Aguinaldo, the Philippine
insurgent leader, who was recently here
to secure a representation on the
Peace Commission, has written a
lengthy explanation of the situation In
Paris with respect to the Philippines
to a friend In this city. A translation
of his communication with reference to
this question Is as follows:
I am glad to say that the prospects for
my country and my people arc brighter
now than they were at the time 1 left ;
Washington.
I must confess that at that time I was |
much disheartened and a little dlsap- i
pointed at the result of our visit to the j
American capital, but, nevertheless, it
was not without the accomplishment of
some good, which would never have been
wrought perhaps had we not gone there.
The chief of these was that the American
impression and understanding of the Phil
ippine Islands and their people was, to a
large extt-nt. changed.
That was a most important thing, and
I believe has had the effect of making the
American people more determined that
our country shall not be given back to
Spain and, above all things, what our
people desire und the desire of the Ameri
can people, I am led to believe, from
what I have learned while in Paris, will
be reflected and carried out by the
American Commissioners of Peace.
I can truthfully say that the Ameri
can Commissioners have treated us with
the utmost courtesy and with considera
tion, so that we have bright hopes of the
outcome.
On the other hand, while the Spanish
Commissioners with whom, of course, we
have had less to do, have acted toward j
us in a gentle manner, they havt-. newr- !
theless, shown that they considered the
representatives of the Philippine revolu- ;
tionary government as intruders in Paris, ;
ami that we should be ignored entirely,
especially so far as having anything- at
all to say with reference to the disposition ,
of the islands in the final peace treaty
between the United States and Spain.
However, this was nothing mure than
wus expected by us, especially if the
American Government re-fu.sed to allow
US a representation on the commission.
Thus fai the commission has pro- :
gressed skwly. but this we regard as
favorable to our Government, although ',
we do not tit sire to have the ijiif-stion too
long postponed, but in the meantime the
revolutionary government is given an
opportunity to become better estab
lished, to extend its control and influence
over the Islands, and the impress). ,n
which this action will convey will surely j
have a decided and favorable effect upon
the American Commissioners! when the
matter of the islands Is finally reached.
We are In constant communication
with President Agtrinaldo and are kept
"well advised of the affairs of the Govern- j
ment and its movements. Moreover, we J
shall in a short time receive in Paris
some important documents from our
Government which we shall lay before
the commission, and which. I am sure,
will tend to place us in a favorable light.
While I cannot say that I have the
positive assurance, yet I am satisfied j
from tho knowledge I have gained in
Paris that the American Commissioners
will not consent that tho Philippine Isl
ands or any part of them shall be re- I
turned to Spain.
If that one thing alone is gainedâ ab- |
solute independence from trie sovereignty
of Spainâ then the revolution of my peo
pie, the government establisned by Agui
naido and our mission to Washington and i
to Paris have not been in vain.
I cannot predict absolute Independence i
for my country immediately, but I believe
that that is its ultimate destiny, and I
have so reported to my Government.

Commodore Hichborn Reports on the

WASHINGTON, Oct. 2S.â A large part
of the burden of equipping the United
States navy for the war with Spain fell
upon the Construction Bureau of the

dore Hichborn, the chief constructor, fur
nishes many Interesting details as to the
extent of this work, involving the trans
formation of more than 100 merchant
craft into auxiliary naval vessels at short
notice. Looking to the future, the chief
constructor -olnts to the importance of
properly equipping and maintaining plants
at minor naval stations along tht- coast
already established, and he submits es
timates for the purpose, averaging about
$2o 000 in each case. He says that had the
consequences of the recent naval engage
ments in the West Indies been nearly as
serious aÂ« there was reason to expect
they might be the Southern stations
would have been necessary for repairs to
ships too badly injured to be sent to
Northern yards. To keep the nucleus of
the force of men at these stations, small
work should be constantly under way and
proper storehouses should be erected to
keep sufficient quantities of material on
hand. It is suggested that while the new
dock at Algiers, La., is building a suit
able repair plant and storehouses should
be erected.

Every continent on the globe, with
the exception of Australia, produces
wild roses. There can be little doubt
that the rose is one of the earth's old
est flowers. In Egypt it is depicted
on a number of very early monuments,
believed to date from 3000 to 3500 B. C.
Rosewater, or the essence of roses, is
mentioned by Homer in the "Iliad," and
the allusion made to the flower in the
Proverbs of Solomon indicates that it
had already been long known.
The Japanese language is said to con
tain 60,000 words. It is quite imp"ssi
ble for one man to learn the entire lan
guage, and a well educated Japanese
is familiar with only about 10,000
words.
Wheat S2 a Bushel.
Some farmers are holding their wheat be
cause they think the price will go to $2 a
buehel. The price, however, may go down
Instead of up, and thus great looses will fol

are dangerous, particularly so in sickness. At

gestion or constipation cure yourself with

your condition to improve itself, fur it is apt

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Oct. 2S.â The stock market to
day took on some of the characteristics of a
bull campaign in full form. Business was large
and exceedingly well distributed, many of the
usually inactive stocks being brought forward
into the market, while the market was much |
less dominated by the specialties, which, bow
ever, continued very active, particularly Sugar
and Tobacco. The former was less violent in I
its fluctuation than yesterday, and although
it advanced several times it met more stock
than it could carry. It ended the day un
changed. Tobacco, on the other hand, after a i
fractional decline, surged strongly upward, the j
extreme rise being nearly Hve points. The i
rise was coupled with rumors of the flotation
of the new plug : liany, and in the !
taking in of many large competitors in that j
field. Another conspicuous move was that in !
the iron and Pteel stocks, which were led by
the dealings in the securities of the new Fed
eral Steel Company when issued. These stocks
were at one time 11,I 1 , to 1% above last night. <
The company certificates of the Minnesota Iron
Company with the cash payment added, giving
the rieht to entry into the Federal Company, j
sold at 131, an advance of four points, and the j
Illinois Steel certificates closed at ..-â  bid, a
gain of two points. Securities of other iron
and steel companies showed strength to a less
decree. Sneculation in the railrcad stocks was
active and varied, the Grangers leading In
point of activity. There was a marked de
traction from the activity in the latter part
of the day nnd the room traders took profits,
reducing the days net gains below the figure
of the extreme advances.
There was very notable activity and strength
In the bond market and evident pressure r,f
large sums of money seeking investment. Bonds
of Western and Southern roads, especially re
organization bonds, seem to be In special fa
vor. Total sale?. $3,313,000.
United States threes old, four registered and
the fives coupon advanced l i in the bid price.
The new threes were very active. The coupon
sold at 106 nearly all day, which is the record
price.'
The total sales of stocks to-day were 378.500 '
shares, including: Atchisoo preferred, 7492;

THE LONDON MARKET.

London financial cablegram says:
The improvement in the stock markets here
noted yesterday was continued to-day, French
specialties being particularly good. The up
ward movement in Americans continues,
mainly on New York support, and the close
was â at about the best, St. Paul being espec
ially BtrODE.
In spite of the general recovery the markets
cannot yet be described as settled.
'Silver was strong. It was- reported that a
Spanish order is imminent for about one mil
lion ounces.
The money market is easier, supply being
rather more abundant. Continental exchanges
were consequently lower.

BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Oct. 2i>.-Bradstreefs Financial
Review to-morrow will say: Prices declined in
the early part of the week on the decision of
the Supreme Court against the legality of the
Joint Traffic Association and on the disturbed
financial and political situation abroad, which
resulted in heavy sales of American stocks for
London and continental account. Later on,
however, the outlook was somewhat improved,
and with it the temper of speculation here un
derwent a decided change for the bettor. Lead
ing interests appeared to take hold of the
Grangers and other favorite stocks and there
was also a slight but sufficiently marked in
crease in the outside participation. At the
same time the market has been a profesional
one and was influenced largely by manipulation
on the part of large interests. The situation
abroad was the main factor and until it be
came reasonably clear that neither war nor
revolution need be apprehended at present
there was a decidedly conservative feeling In
financial circles on this Bide. The decision
against the Joint Traffic Association fiiled to
produce the same impression in speculation as
the trans-Missouri case did. It would seem that
the market disregards the present adverse rul
ing because the association has virtually been
a dead letter for months past and because It
is expected that it will lead to action by Con
gress on a pooling bill.
The continued favorable character of rail
road earnings, particularly at the West, also
tends to minimize the importance of the de
cision. More or leas favorable accounts of
trade conditions contributed to the bullish feel-
I ing of the week, though American Sugar stock
: has beea n weak feature* in the maintenance of
! the competitive price. American Tobacco stock,
j after a sharp rise to above 130, reacted, but
finally rose to over 134 on the announcement
that the plug tobacco manufacturing combina
tion is to go on after all. Apart from these two
specialties the industrial stocks have been gen
erally strung, though the chief activity r,f the
I market was in the railroad sharv list, v.-hich,
I selling off early in thÂ« week, rallied sharply
1 on short covering, manipulation and some fresh
; buying, the Granger stocks taking the lead.
, South railroad securities have also improved
! on the frosts at the i^outh and the ending of
the yellow fever epidemic.
It is noticed that the bond market iÂ« active
and* strong, with renewed dealings at higher
:n many issues, the St. Louis South
! western and Atchison boing the feature.

DUX'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, Oct. 28.-R. O. Dun & Co.'s
weekly review of trade will says to-morrow:
Business has been more affected by foreign
affairs than many realize. London's apprehen
sion of war first caused advance in wheat and
fears of monetary pressure hpre. Then came
confidence In Ix>ndon with a flight of French
money across the chnnnel, and stock markets
advanced while wheat fell. Mobs in Paris did
not mean to influence American interests from
New York to San Francisco, but electric wires
have made the world small. The wires moved
a cargo of wheat from the Pacific Coast, start
ed $2, 500,000 more gold from Australia to this
country on London account, and the selling of
American securities 4hÂ» day and buying the
next. There has been^Tio domestic change of
much Importance, and the rise In price of
WVstern railroad stocks indicates that the Su
preme Court decision against the Trunk Line
Association Is considered helpful to railroads.
Wheat rose 3 cents from Friday to Monday,
and then fell 4%c to Friday. But such changes
do not renresent actual conditions, and with
receipts for the week 9,558.205 bushels, against
6,996,587 last year, nobody can pretend that
holding of stocks by Western farmers is an
important factor. The Atlantic exports, flour
Included, amount to 3.796, R30 bushel? against
3.864,649 last year, and Pacific exports 825,994
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SAT UUP AT, OCTOBEK 29, 1898.
bushels against 1,326.808 last year, making 16,
607,362 bushels in four weeks against 19,418,047
last year, when the foreign demand was far
beyond all precedent. In four weeks the
Western receipts have been over 40.150,693 bush
els against 30,723,288 last year, and yet prices
are 25c lower. This clearly Indicates much
larger supplies and greater readiness to part
with them than was seen a year ago. when no
body doubted the magnitude of the foreign de
mand. Corn refuses to follow -wheat, but
slightly advanced. -" , _
Cotton rope to 5%c last week, but has fallen
to 5%c in epite -of heavy frosts in part of the
growing region. This expresses strongly the
belief that no curtailment of yield is possible
that will affect the surplus more than the clos
ing of Eastern mills one month in three, and
the reduction of consumption abroad, aor Eu
ropean mills, as well as those "* this country,
have surplus stocks produced from the nign
priced cotton of last year which they cannot
profitably market. The frosts seem not to havfi
damaged the crop appreciably, but a }iein
much smaller than has been expected _ win ex
ceed with present stock the quantity the worm

Wool dealers have reached the conclusion
that, with the heavy stocks on hand. It .ls no
longer a question of profit, but of avoid ins,
losses. The concessions have brought a big in
crease in sales for the week, though for â four
weeks the aggregate has been only HÂ»â¢- â¢
pounds against 36,394.098 last year, 28.320,100 in
'Now Ohio"hoi'ders are asking 2 to 3 cents ten
Now Ohio holders are asking 2 to 3 cents less
than a month ago, having 73 per cent of line
and 40 per cent of medium wool yet on hand,
while 104,000 bales of wool are offered to foreign
bidders who may decide to export it. < ; " 1( l e
weather has made somewhat more demand tor
goods and yet not enough to change the situa
tion materially. The cotton manufacturer has
still a good demand late as It is but the mak
ers are depressing prices by bidding against
each other, although in the average of all quo
tations the decline has been ess than hal of
one per cent from the highest point. But the
wire nail manufacturers have reduced prices
5 per cent, and the rail manufacturers, accord-
Ing to current reports, have decided not to ad
vance prices, and there is a prospect that he a â  >
demand for products will be further encouraged
by the later quotations. . ..
Failures for the week have been 226 in the
United States against 219 last year, and M in
Canada against -25 last year.
BRADSTREET'S BUSINESS REVIEW.
NEW YORK. Oct. 25.-Bradstreefs to-mor
row will say: Irregularities in prices and^trade
movements has been rather more marked this
week than for some time past, but measured
by all the usual standards of business devel
opment the situation is one of exceptional ac
tivity and even strength. The active foreign
demand at advanced prices for American cer
eals and their products appeared to have cul
minated early in the week in a virtual war
scare" market, in which the highest prices
reached since early in August were recorded.
The reaction shown, however, has been a small
one. testifying to nervousness both at home
and abroad, growing out of the exceptionally
small gains in world's supplies, reports of dam
age to wheat in the fields in the Northwest
and in Manitoba, activity in the milling 1 "
mand for wheat at home. Minneapolis breaking
all records of flour production for the week
and a continuance of the talk of rather less
than anticipated outturns of crops abroad
noted for some time past. _ Evidences of reac
tion in prices are not confined to wheat but
extend to lard and coffee among food product?.
Bessemer pigiron, lead and cotton, while most
other cereals, pork and beef, copper and print
cloths have remained steady and unchanged.
In distributive trade reports of bad _ weather
interfering with regular demand and collec
tions, but of stimulating retail trade in heavy
winter goods, coming West Â»nd Northwest,
whence also come advices of bad roads, crip
pling the farmers' ability to deliver wheat to
market. Against this, however, must be cited
the fact that primary receipts of wheat are In
excess of one year ago and for the : season are
fully equal to those of last year.. A great burst
of activity in nearly all lines has followed the
freeing of the lower Mississippi section from
the numerous quarantines and country buying
is reported active in that section. From the
Pacific Coast, particularly Puget Sound and
Columbia River points, the advices are of very
active trade, heavy grain receipts being largely
absorbed by mills working on export orders,
and erf Increasing trade with our new depend
encies. Here at least the tone. of business re
mains rather quiet. â '?*â '
The industrial situation has many points of
Interest in it. The cotton goods trade is closely
following the workings of the plan of restric
tion adopted by the Fall River print clot*-,
mills. Much is hoped from the reduction in
output pledged to occur between now and Feb
ruary 1. Mills employing 3500 operatives shÂ»t
down this week, but the non-inclusion of mills
producing similar goods in other New England
Cities has lack of knowledge of the extent to
which those concerned will see to extend the
foreign outlet for these goods are uncertain
features in the outlook for a continuance of
present firm quotations. The movement of the
raw Product to market, stimulated probably
to some extent by removals of quarantine re
strictions is now far in advanceâ 3oo,ooo bales
!at leastâ of last year, and expectations of
a heavier crop than last year is a bearish fea
ture more than offsetting reports of killing
frosts throughout the South. Prices are conse
quently lower and speculation lags. . .
Sales of wool are of increased volume, cut
much of this, particularly at Boston, is re
ported moved at concessions caused by chang
ing of bank loans. The. manufactured product
! remains slow of sale at first hands, but ad-
I vices of good retail buying are more numerous,
as a result, of cold, inclement weather, particu
larly West and South. The iron and steel situ
ation continues without much change, though
shading of prices of Bessemer piglrpn and bil
lets to satisfy the desire of producers to main
tain activity in the face of confessedly quieter
tone of business.
In other industries the report is generally of
plenty of work, but at prices which tend to
confirm the views of those who claim that
profit margins have been permanently reduced.
Instances of this are found in the reports of
52 000 more people employed in New York mate
in industries now than one year ago and in
the reports of Implement manufacturers that
on a lot of business where the per cent is In
excess of last year profits have not been pro
portionately increased.

RAISINS AND PRUNES IN NEW YORK.

merce under this date says: There has been
no change in the California raisin situation.
Nothing further has been heard of the pro
posed advance In prices for shipment, and there
seems to have been no increase in the demand
for goods to be sent forward from the coast
at prices which went Into effect at midnight
of the 15th Instant. For seeded raisins there
it? reported to be a very good demand and the
market is firm. California seedless and Sul
tanas are firm under small supplies and fair
demand. A very firm feeling is noted in the
market for California prunes of larger sizes,
offerings of which both here and from coast
are light. Smaller sizes are somewhat unset
tled owing to the indifference of buyers, but
there has been no quotable change in prices.

HEAVY EXPENSE

GRAND JURY
Inquisitors Hand in
Their Bills.
GOOD THING FOR EXPERT
ANOTHER GRAND JURY TO BE
SWORN NEXT WEEK.
Must Make a Report and Be Dis
charged Before the Close of the
Year and Another Jury
Sworn.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 28.
The Grand Jury which was discharged
yesterday was the must expensive Grand
Jury this county has known. Last year
the total cost of Grand Juries in this
county was $2324. The cost for the recent
Grand Jury alone will hardly be lean than
twice this sum.
The expert, Dunshee, was employed at
$5 per day. He was appointed January
13, and has worked since that time all
but three days, exclusive of Sundays.
This will make his bill $1250. The sten
ographer's fees will amount to $50 more,
and the bills of the Grand Jurors, so far
ajs presented, are as follows:
M. W. Dlckson, $322 10; Albert Wey
mouth, $346 50; Joseph Harris, $125 65; J.
E. Crooks, $20S CO; C. S. Long, $130 90; M.

$130 30; J. F. Storer, $132 10, and J. Tyrrell,
$156 55.
There are one or two bills not yet pre
sentedâincluding that of the late F. K.
Shattuck, who died about two months
ago.
Then there is a large number of bills
for witnesses, all of which are not yet
w presented to the Auditor for payment.
â f County Treasurer Sanford criticizes the
criticisms of the Grand Jury regarding
the charges contained in its report against
the late Frank P. Th wait Mr. Sanford
Bays that Thwaites is not the party to
be condemned in this mutter. Every bill
presented by Mr. Thwaites was signed by
the Justice of the Peace, the District At
torney and the chairman of the Finance
Committee of the Board of Supervisors,
and Mr. Sanford thinks that a portion
of the responsibility should be placed on
these officials, if the bills of the deceased
stenographer were raised.
A new panel for a Grand Jury was
drawn to-day, and the following citizens
of the county must appear before Judge
Ellsworth next Wednesday: E. J. Dodge,

CLAIMS BIG DAMAGES
FOR HIS WIFE'S DEATH
MARTIAL DAVOUST BRINGS SUIT
FOR $50,000.
Mrs. Davoust Was Cruelly Killed in
' Alameda by Coming in Con-
tact With a Live Wire.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 28.
Martial Davoust to-day brought suit in
the Superior Court of Alameda County
against the city of Alameda and the Sun
set Telephone and Tele-graph Company
for $50.00* i damages claimed to have been
sustained by reason of the death of his
young wife, caused through the alleged
careleÃsness of the agents and servants
of the defendant corporations.
The terrible particulars of Mrs. Da
â voust's untimely death are still fresh in
memory of residents of the Encinal city,
The complaint, which was filed late this
afternoon by Reddy, Campbell & Metson,
attorneys for the heartbroken plaintiff,
alleges that on September 2S last defend
ants carelessly, negligently and without
regard for human life allowed a certain
wire, connected with other wires and
poles, to fall down upon the ground of a
certain public path used as a passage
way by the residents from Pearl street to
Versailles avenue station; that the wire
was allowed to remain on said path for
over one month previously, and being
heavily charged with electricity, was a
menace to the life of any person using
the path. In ract, small boys of the
neighborhood had been seen frequently
throwing tin cans at the wire to see the
Eparks fly.
On the particular day mentioned Mr*.
Davoust, bi.Â«.he and happy, walked from
her home on Pearl street over this path
to join her husband af the station, with
out the slightest knowledge of the dan
gerous con ion of the wire, and in some
t- manner touched or brushed against it and
was bo shocked that she was unable to
dlentangle herself therefrom, or be res
cued by others. She was burned to death
in the presence of a large number of per
son*, even the unhappy husband stand
ing by witnessing her agony.
The death of Mrs. Davoust was a se
vere shock to the entire community. To
the husband the loss was so severe that
for a time it was feared he would lose his
reason. The deceased was a highly edu-
I lady of 22 years, was a kind, affec
tionate and loving wife. The couple had
been living happily in marital bliss for
five years, and the blessings of mother
: were about to be bestowed upon her.
By reason of being deprived of the ser
vices, solace, comfort and society of the
â vvifV, and having suffered great bodily In-
Jury by reason of the shock caused by
her terrible death, plaintiff alleges that
he has been damaged in the sum of $30,000.

TO-DAY WILL
SETTLE THE
PARK BONDS
Curiosity Waits on the
Quiet Vote.
ISSUE FREELY INDORSED
ONLY OPEN OPPOSITION FROM
WEST OAKLAND.
A Two-Thirds Majority Necessary to
Raise the Money for the
Proposed Pur
chases.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 28.
To-morrow the citizens of Oakland will
decide whether or not bonds snail be is
sued for the purchase and improvement of
public parks. The proposition in brief is
as follows:
For the purchase of sixty acres of
Adams Point, $240,000; for the improve
ment of this property, $5M.OOO; for the im
provement of West Oakland Park, $20,000;
for the improvement of Independence
Square, East Oakland $10,000.
The question of carrying out the im
provements for which the bonds will be
I used has b<-c n before this city for over a
year, and the Question is now thoroughly
understood by ail the voters. It will re
quire that two-thirds of all the votes cast
i Â£avor the bond issue. In order that the
i improvements be carried out. There has
â  been very little campaigning concerning
1 the park bonds, partly because of the
mure prominent Interest In the general
; election and partly because of the fact
| that thero is very little to be said on the
I matter that has not already been ex
ploited.
The matter is of peculiar 3ignificance,
i because for the first time in me history
of Oakland when bonds have been pro
i there has been no organized oppo
sition or, indeed, any pronounced oppo
sition of any kind. The Merchants' Ex
change, the Board of Trade, many of the
, most prominent merchants, professional
men and capitalists, Rev. Father Mc-
Nally, Rev. Dr. J. K. McLean, and even
men who have been known as anti-bond
agitators, have ail expressed themselves
: as being favorable to the proposed Issue.
The only opposition that nas been made
| public is that of the West Oakland Im
provement Club, and some resolutions
were passed by this club opposing the
measure a few weeks ago. Since that
i time Colonel Irish has stated publicly
| that the bond issue will benefit a compar
: atively small portion of the citizens of
! Oakland.
The result of to-morrow's election will
! be very interesting, because it will show
! the comparative strength of that very
I doubtful quantity in Oakland elections,
i the silent vote. The impression to-night
! is very general that the necessary ma
1 iority will be recorded in favor of the
! bonds.
STILL IN THE FIGHT.
Alameda Woman Suffragists Re
organize for a New Campaign.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 28.â The Alameda la
dies who advocate political equality have
resurrected their organization and pro
pose to renew their fight. When they
campaigned two years ago for the
woman's suffrage amendment they ar
gued that their sex was entitled to a
vote on every question submitted to the
people. Now they are conducting the agi
tation on different lines. They will be
satisfied if only women property holders
are given the ballot, and they only ask
the right of suffrage at school elections.
The Alameda Equality Club held a re
union yesterday at the residence of ex-
Assemblyman J. A. Waymire. The equal
ity question was discussed and a plan of
campaign was outlined. A committee was
ap;>ulnted to intercede with legislative
candidates of all parties to secure their
influence in behalf of the woman's suf
frage cause.
Among' those who attended the meet
! ing were: Mrs. Swift, State president of

Footpads Vanquished.
ALAMEDA. Oct. 28.â Sam Scofleld, son
of the president of the Pacific Coast Oil
Works, was held up by footpads a few
nights ago, and by the rapid and effect
ive use of his fists he vanquished the
ruffians, who made good their escape.
The hold-up occurred at the corner of
Enclnal avenue and Walnut street. Mr.
Scofleld was on his way home near mid
night when suddenly he was confronted
by three men who commanded him to
<stop and throw up his hands. Instead of
obeying the order Scofleld, who has some
pretensions as an athlete, Jumped at the
footpads and began to use his "props"
with telling effect. One of the men went
down from a blow in the face, and the
others took to their heels and ran. While
Scofield was chasing them the fellow who
had been floored disappeared. The affair
was not reported to the police, and there
is no clew to the footpads.
She Bossed the Butchers.
OAKLAND. Oct. 28.â AUce Edith Dick
ason, the alleged contract wife of the
late millionaire Thomas H. Blythe, was
arrested again this afternoon on a charge
of drunkenness by Officer Nick Williams.
She gave her name as Alice Thomas.
When released last Wednesday her hus
band agreed to have her sent to some
institution for Inebriates, but hia promise
has evidently proved hard to live up to.
for to-day the woman created a scene at
Barnum's Restaurant, where she took
command of the butchers at the chopping
block.

MERLIN FLORA
STABS A NURSE
TO THE HEART
George Cook, His Vic
tim, Near Death.
PROVOKED AT HIS REMOVAL
ASSAILANT AN AGED INMATE
OF COUNTY INFIRMARY.
Because He Was Ordered Discharged
as Cured Flora Visited His Spite
Upon the Man Who
Cared for Him.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 28.
Merlin Flora, an aged inmate of the
County Infirmary, murderously assaulted
George Cook, one of the nurses of that
Institution, this afternoon. The latter is
lying at the point of death with an ugly
wound in^ the left breast directed toward
the heart* while Flora Is locked up in a
cell at the County Jail, charged with *n
assault with a deadly weapon.
Flora was admitted to the County In
firmary two years ago, and although 78
years of age is in almost perfect health.
On the 20th inst. he was discharged, but
returned the next day. Superintendent
Dr. Clark, however, realizing that the
man was no longer entitled to ti.e benelits
of the infirmary, had given orders that
his luggage oe packed an<l that he leave
the place.
It was while George Cook was assisting
the old man in gathering his traps in one
of the wards that Flora whipped out a
large caseknife, the point being very
sharp, and dealt the blow that may
prove fatal. The point drove directly to
ward the heart, but it Is not yet known
whether the covering encasing the heart
is torn. The injured man suffered a great
loss of blood, and the physicians are
watching him constantly.
"We have had a great deal of trouble
with this man Flora," said Dr. Lilly at the
Infirmary this evening. "He was very lazy,
and only recently, when asked to tend ihe
cows he refused, although there is no
reason for it, as there is nothing the mat
ter with him. We had discharged him re
cently, but he came back, and was about
to be sent away for the second time.. Ihe
knife with which he stabbed Cook was a
table-knife, the point of which had been
specially sharpened."
ATTORNEY ARAM
IS TO RECEIVE NO FEE
BEDUCTION OF A CHARGE DE-
SERVED NOTHING.
Although Saved From State's Prison,
the Lawyer Is Not to Be
Awarded Pay
ment.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 28.
Attorney Aram will get no fee for de
fending John Tyson on two charges of
felony in the Superior Court a year ago.
This decision was rendered by Justice
Clift to-day and resulted from a suit
brought by Attorney Aram to recover
$100 fee from Tyson.
Over a year ago Tyson was arrested for
committing an assault upon two girls, the
daughters of a man who had befriended
him. The case was bitterly fought and
among the witnesses was a large number
of the membership of the Tenth Avenue
Baptist Church. In the Justice's court
Tyson was held to answer and he made
an agreement with Attorney Aram by
which the latter was to receive $100 if an
acquittal were secured. The case was
tried and there was not evidence suffi
cient to convict Tyson on a felony charge
but the jury found him guilty uf assault
and he was sentenced to six months in
jail. When Tyson came out of jail he de
clined to pay his attorney. Aram con
tended that he had certainly freed his
client from the charges that w;ere lodged
against him, and demanded his $100. Ty
son failed to see how he had been ac
quitted according to agreement, when he
had been forced to spend several months
in jail. The case was argued before Jus
tice Clift and the court held that Aram
had not secured the acquittal of his client
in the sense in which it was implied in the
agreement, and that therefore ne was not
entitled to his fee. The court also held
that Tyson was entitled to a judgment for
the costs of the suit, and such a decree
was entered.

kins and Shorey effected a very clever
capture of a bold bicycle thief this after
noon. During the past week at least
fifteen bicycle 3 have been reported to the
police as stolen, and it is believed now
for a certainty that the thief is behind
the bars at the City Prison.
A wheel belonging to W. Hamilton was
taken yesterday, but Mr. Hamilton man
aged to catch the fellow, who gave up the
â¢wheel, explaining that he had made a
mistake. This afternoon the two detec
tives were skirmishing around in Ala
meda, where they hoped to locate a young
man under suspicion, and after returning,
caught the prisoner on Thirteenth street,
between Washington and Clay, in the
very act of riding away with a wheel,
which A* J. Bertholet identified as his
property.
The fellow was taken to the City Prison
and later Mr. Hamilton called and identi
fied him as the man who stole his wheel
yesterday. The prisoner claims he had
taken the bike by mistake; that his name
is Frank Thompson and that he resides
in Alameda; but he was unable to give
the name of the street or other particulars
asked for, explaining that he has lived
there only two months. Two charges of
petty larceny will be lodged against him
for the present, though he is believed to
be no novice at the business.
Where Is B. W. AllenP
OAKLAND, Oct. 28.â 8. W. Allen, who
for some time has been engaged in the
printing business with W. P. Rigney, left
the office at Ninth and Webster streets
last Monday and has not been seen or
heard from since. Rigney claims that the
books of the firm are badly mixed up and
that Allen collected partnership bills from
the Glrardo, of the Castilian Restaurant.
A. R. Savage and William Raffett, not
a cent of which has been turned in. Allen
also collected for a local weekly paper,
the proprietor of which is wondering what
has become of the collector. Moreover.
It is learned that Allon borrowed liberally
from friends just prior to his departure.
Allen has claimed that he was a widnwrr
and formerly resided In Denver. Rigney
to-day notified the police of his partner's
unexpected leave-taking.
A Habeas Corpus Test.

The feature at the rally of Republican
candidates last night was a speech by Ex-
Assemblyman A. Bretz, the editor of In
dustry. Mr. Bretz said: "I am a Popu
list, a middle-of-the-road Populist, not
one of your weak, swashy Populists who
is willing to have his party swallowed up
in another. I am going to vote the Re
publican ticket just for spite. My party
has been assassinated. Its life has been
taken by the knife and dagger of fusion.
I will revenge myself by voting the Re
publican ticket. If the principles of two
parties are so close that they can fuse
there is no occasion for the existence of
two parties. I say that the Populist par
ty is just as far away from the Democra
tic as it is from the Republican. I call
this fusion an insult, and any man will de
grade himself if he does not leave the
party now. The Democrats stole the
clothes of the Populists and tried to de
ceive them into believing that they had
adopted their principles and our foolish
leaders fell into the trap."
IS STRANGER THAN FICTION.
From the Southern home of Senator
Quay comes the following letter from a
veracious correspondent:
"Being an ex-soldier and having only
fifteen months to serve to acuuire title
to a quarter section of land, I went to
Florida in 1885 to put my plans into exe
cution. Not being posted as to land
marks, I had to hire a settler to locate
the land for me, and we had to go over
about eight miles through the woods
over bad roads, with no bridges. We
went on horseback, and in crossing the
stream I noticed that my friend's horse's
tail caught in an old pine stump, pulling
a hair from the tall and leaving the hair
fast to the stump.
"As you know, a horse hair will turn
to a snake when in water, and I made
up my mind to watch that particular
hair. So, after locating by land and get
ting a big house imilt, I took my gun and
started out on a hunt, and during my
rambles I came to the stream that my
friend and I had crossed, and. sure
enough, there was the horse hair snake
as big as my thumb and ovÂ«r four feet
long. As he was fast to the stump I
let him alone and continued my hunt,
bagging some quail, a rabbit and two
squirrels, which gave me a good mess
or fresh meat. As I was very busy for
the next three weeks I had no time to
visit my pet snake, so you may judge
of my surprise when on my next visit
to find the snake as big as a stovepipe
and over forty feet long. As I was going
to have a log rolling the next week I
kept my secret so that we could have
pome fun after we were through our
day's work. I got everything ready and
sent out my invitations. My friend that
showed me the land came with the rest
of them and told me that his horse was
lost or stolen. We all pitched in and did
a good day's work and had a good din
ner. I told them of my secret and we
went to the branch. You can imagine
our surprise when we found tho snake as
big as a saw log, with a bulge in the mid
dle as big as a sugar barrel.
"Well, to make a long story short, we
killed the snake and cut him open and
my friend's lost horse tumbled out We
thought the horse was dead until he
commenced to move, and soon ran around
all right, and my friend rode him home
I have heard a great deal about horse
hair Bnakes, and this is the only instance
I know of where a horse was swallowed
alive by a hair from his own tail."âBal

NEW ZEALAND BABBIT EXPOBT
Che exportation of rabbits from New
Zealand has assumed such dimensions
that It has quite got beyond the ex
perimental stage and has now become
an important industry. One exporter
is at the present time in receipt of be

and is paying to trappers in wages be
tween $4000 and $5000 per week. He has
24.000 traps out, giving employment to
about five hundred trappers. I,ast year
his export of rabbits was about 700,000,
while he anticipates sendine away
about a million and a half this sea
son. By this exporter alone about
eight trucks are used per week to make
the boxes in which the rabbits are
frozen and exported, while in carriage
he pays over $500 a week.

UNUSUAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS
THANKSGIVING DAY.
Americans at Home and Abroad Are
Called Upon to Observe the Cus
tom of Our Fore
fathers.
Special Dispatch to The CaJl.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 28.â The Presi
dent, after the Cabinet meeting to-day,
issued the following Thanksgiving
proclamation:
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
A PROCLAMATION:
The approaching November brings to
mind the custom of our ancestors, hal
lowed by time and rooted in our most
sacred traditions of giving thanks to
Almighty God for all blessings he has
vouchsafed to us during the past year.
Few years in our history have afford
ed such cause for thanksgiving as
this. We have been blessed by abun
dant harvests, our trade and commerce
have been wonderfully increased, our
public credits been improved and
strengthened, all sections of our com
mon country have been brought to
gether and knitted into closer bond of
national purpose and unity.
The skies have been for a time dark
ened by the cloud of war, but as we
were compelled to take up the sword
in the cause of humanity, we are per
mitted to rejoice that the conflict has
been of brief duration, and the losses
we have had to mourn, though griev
ous and important, have been so few
considering the great results accom
plished, as to inspire us with gratitude
and praise to the Lord of Hosts. We
may laud and magnify his holy name
that the cessation of hostilities came so
soon as to spare both sides the count
less sorrows and disasters that attend
protracted war.
I do, therefore, invite all my fellow
citizens, as well those at home
as thuse who may be at sea
or sojourning in foreign lands,
to set apart and observe Thursday, the
24th day of November, as a day of na
tional thanksgiving, to come together
in their several places of worship for a
service of praise and thanks to Al
mighty God for all the blessings of the
year; for the mildness of the seasons
and the fruitfulness of the soil; for the
continued prosperity of the people; for
the devotion and valor of our country
men; for the glory of our victory and
the hope of a righteous peace, and to
pray that the divine guidance which
has brought us heretofore to safety
and honor may be graciously continued
in the years to come.
WILLIAM McKINLEY.
In witness whereof, etc.
By the President:
JOHN HAY, Secretary of State.

WHAT A BOA EATS.
Among the many interesting animals
at the zoological gardens is the large
tree boa, occupying the glass cage to the
left as you enter the carnivora building.
This is one of the finest specimens in the
United States. This species of snake is
very scarce and difficult to capture. It
was sent to the gardens about a year ago
from South America, where it was cap
tured by some of the natives. It had just
fed on a deer, and was found lying dor
mant in the woods. The boa is said to
be about thirty-five or forty years old, is
twenty-three feet long and weighs 196
pounds.
Superintendent Stephan of the gardens,
showing the snake to a reporter the other
day, said: "He has just had his dinner,
and seems to be quite comfortable. He
usually feeds every three or four weeks,
and then I have a hard time to make him
eat. You see, boas feed mostly on live
animals, and It Is difficult to keep them
on any other food. It is against their na
ture to eat beef or dead animals.
The Humane Society objects to the
feeding of live animals to reptiles, and
hence, in compliance with Its rules, I put
each animal to death before feeding the
same to the snakes. This boa had not
been fed for seven weeks, and I thought
he must be quite hungry. So we decided
to let him feed on a pug dog that we
happened to have at the gardens.
"Some time ago a woman came to me
with a pet dog. He was afflicted with
some kind of a disease and was getting
blind. She hated to part with her pet,
but as she had been informed by several
people that there was no hope for the
animal she decided to let the Humane
Society end his suffering. I said I would
take care of him and see that the animal
was put to death immediately. The dog
was put in an air-tight box Jilled with gas,
so as to suffocate him. In a few seconds
he was no more. This is what our boa
has Just dined on. I put the dog in the
cage immediately, and the snake, having
a good appetite, made a start for It. The
dog made quite a square meal, weighing
about eighteen pounds. Having feasted
the boa curled himself up into a nice coil
and took a long nap. This will do him for
some time, until we find some new menu
for him." â Cincinnati Enquirer.
PROPERTY RIGHTS IN CATS.
Not long ago one of the English Chan
cery courts had before it a case which
involved a very unusual state of facts.
The plaintiff, a maiden lady, claimed ti.at
she; was entitled to a half share in a biue
Persian cat. which rejoiced in the pomp
ous name of Roy. She asked that an ac
count of the partnership be taken and
that other complications regarding the cat
be straightened out. The defendant, as
might have been expected, was likewise
a spinster, and it appears from the evi
dence that during the kittenhood of the
cat she gave the animal into the charge
of the plaintiff, who bestowed upon it all
those tender attentions which the pets of
unmarried ladies so frequently enjoy.
Perhaps all would have gone as merrily
as a wedding bell (despite "the celibacy of
tho litigants) had not the much-fondled
Roy developed some extraordinary char
acteristics. In short, the cat astonished
its most ardent admirers by rtevelonfng nn
amazing capacity for prize-winning. At
all the cat shows the whiskered i|uau
ruped became the prime favorite, and
many trophies fell to its lot, or. more
strictly speaking, to the lot of its owners.
It was entered at the Crystal Palace show
in the joint names of the plaintiff and de
fendant, under the rule requiring the
names of the animals' owners to be regis
tered. But after the development of the
winning streak the plaintiff denied that
the defendant had any property in the
cat.
The Lord Chancellor, after he had duly
scratched his legal pate In consideration
of the much-vexed question, decided that
a partnership existed between the liti
gants, and. therefore, he ordered the ac
counts of the partnership fo be taken. He
also granted an injunction restraining the
defendant from selling or dealing with
Roy in any way prejudicial to the plain
tiff's property In It.
The above ca?e might well strike the
layman as an absurdity and as belittling
the dignity of the court; but household
pets, such as dogs, cats, parrots, monk
eys, etc., have so frequently been the sub
ject matter of litigation that a distinct
and clearly defined line of decisions con
corning them has sprung into existence.
The latest encyclopedia on law devotes
forty closely printed paces to the subject
of "animals." and cites hundreds of cases
â which have been decided on questions per
taining to the brute creation. Nor are the
principles enunciated by any means sim
ple or frivolous.â Richmond Dispatch.
Visitorâ l seem to remember that last
year when I was here there were two
windmills. Nativeâ There were twoâ yes.
but we found out there was only wind
enough for one.â London Tit-Bits.

STANFORD VARSITY
BEATS THE CADETS
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 28.â
The Varsity won from the League of the
Cross Cadets this afternoon by a score
of 18 to 5. Each team scored once in
the first half, and Stanford twice in the
second, when the cadets were very much
weakened.
Both teams played straight football,
and the cadets put up the cleanest game
of any visiting team on the campus this
year. Both scored by backs, although
Stanford varied the game occasionally by
long runs by Murphy and Clinton. Fish
er, Hill and Burmeister are accredited
with ten yard bucks each. The tackles,
Rusk and Wilson, also ran well with the
ball.
The Varsity showed clearly some little
improvement in defensive work, but the
team was still weak. On the offensive the
team was stmng.

poses of organization am! to discuss such other I
matters as the exigencies of the present state
of affairs here may require. Tour punctual
attendance is requested. Very truly yours,
JOHN K. DE HTYTER, Chairman.
There is a proposition on foot among
some of the members of the Pacific Mas
tiff Club to raise the entrance fee. It is
understood that Mr. Simon, who, in the
absence of Dr. d'Evelyn and C. A. Spreck
e!s, is the acting president, is much op- ;
posed to this step.
The Oakland Kennel Club held a meet- :
ing last night to discuss the projected
bench show, but adiourned without ar
riving at a definite decision.
The second derby forfeits will be aue
and payable to J. M. Kilgarif, secretary
Pacific Coast Field Trial Association, on
November 3.
George Bell has departed for Denver, i
but will probably return in three months. !
He has under consideration the offer of
the management of one of the largest
kennel* in the State.
W. W. Van Arsdale has purchased from |
P. J. Kenna, for something over three
figures, the well-known English setter I
bitch Peach Mark, for which Ernest Sul- I
livan paid $250 at last year's field triads at !
Bakersfield.
Hugh Hume has added to his Belmont
kennels a very fine collie dog with an ex
tensive pedigTee. Wellsbourne Charlie ia :
the sire, the dam being a sister to Heather I
Mint.
Two celebrated representatives of the
"holy breed" have joined the great ma
jority. Champion Alta, the finest smooth
coated St. Bernard bitch ever brought to
this coast, and champion Roxle Savage
Taylor, a very good rough-coated speci
men, have both died within the past few
days.
J. V. Geary has already bespoken for his
mastiff bitch Juno the service of the
brindled dog to be sent out by Dr.
d' Evelyn.
The following letter from a well-known
breeder of sporting dogs is self-explana
tory:
FRfITVALE. Oct. 25. 189 S.
Editor of The Call â Dear Sir: In your issue
Of October 15, under the head of "Kennel
Xotes." you stated that the Pacific Kennel
league was going to announce to the public
that they would disqualify all exhibitors show
ing under the American Kennel Club rules
from their shows.
Your Informant, to say the least, was very
much mistaken, or Intended to make a false
impression before the public as to the objects
and Intentions of the Pacific Kennel League.
In the ttrst place, the Pacific Kennel League
â was not formed for the object of opposing the
American Kennel Club, nor having any quarrel
with any other kennel organization, but to pro
mote the kennel interests of the Pa<-iflo Coast
The Pacific Kennel League hap. as a matter
of fact, not seceded at all. as is believed by
many, nor was any vote taken on the riuestion
of "secession." We are simply asserting: our
undeniable American right of local self-gr/Vf-rn
ment. We have no quarrel with the American
Kennel Club, unless they deny our right to
hold shows outside of their Jurisdiction, if it
pleases us to do so.
The Oakland Kennel Club, being one to op
pose the organization of the Pacific Kennel
League, is to hold a show, under the American
KÂ»nnÂ»l Club rules, in Oakland, November 8, 9
and 10 next, and I will say that my dogs, as
well as dogs of other members of the Pacific
Kennel League, will be on exhibition there, and
it would be very foolish for us to turn around
and disqualify ourselves.
It seems that some people vrhn pose as
fanciers delight In writing articles in the pub
lic press which they know to he false, and I
challenge the party giving you the information
above referred to to show proof of his state
ment. It seems that they are trying to create
Impressions that the members of the Pacific
Kennel League are going about like bandits
and outlaws, with knives up their sleex-ex, seek
ing the life blood of every club which does not
happen to look at the question Just as they do,
hut I can assure the public that the Pacific
Kennel League was organized by gentlemen
who are going to use their effort* to promote
harmony among the kennel Interests of the
Coast.
By giving this communication space in your
Issue of the 29th innt. you will greatly oblige
yours respectfully, PERCY WARD.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 29, 1898.
CIVIL SERVICE
SYSTEM WILL
BE MODIFIED
President McKinley's
Proclamation.
CLEVELAND'S GAME UNDONE
OFFICIALS MAY APPOINT THEIB
OWN FIDUCIARY EMPLOYES.
Some Important Changes Said to Be
in Contemplation in the San
Franciscd Custom
House.
A telegram from Washington published
in yesterday's issue of The Call to the
effect that President McKinley was about
to issue a proclamation removing the
Cleveland cloak of civil service from the
shoulders of certain officials in the of
fices of the Internal Revenue Collector,
the Collector of Customs, the Mint Su-
perintendents and the sub-treasury offi
cials, caused a blizzard of apprehension
to traverse the spinal columns of the
threatened officials. The order is expect
ed to be issued by next Monday.
This step has been in contemplation for
many months, and Senator Perkins and
Congressmen Loud and Barham have
been subjected to a strong 1 pressure In the
matter.
As at present determined upon the or
der will affect upward of 6000 places. It
will include deputy collectors of internal
revenue who are authorized to become
i acting; collectors, actually serving in that
' capacit" There are about 2uoo of these
! deputies. The largest class affected is the
I corps of examining surgeons of the Pen
| sion Bureau, of whom there are in all
over 4100. There seems to be a general
i understanding that it win be better to
! have these left out of the civil service, al
â  though Secretary Bliss, while understood
i to favor such action, would not recom
1 mend it. Over 3000 of these surgeons are
stated at the Civil Service Commission
| never to have been classified under the
I civil service law. The order will clear up
; the misapprehension as to the actual
! status of the whole corps and place them
all outside. About fifty office deputy mar
shals heretofore reported as classified,
but concerning- whose status there has
been some doubt because of their being In
the judicial branch of the service, are ex
pected to be placed in the exempt class.
There are other scattering positions, in
cluding some of a fiduciary and confiden
tial character, which will aggregate sev
eral hundred.
Customs Collector Jackson stated yes
terday that as he understood the matter
the order would tnke out of the civil serv
ice list all officials employed under him
in a fiduciary capacity, such as die cash
ier, the auditor, the chief clerk and such
officials as were empowered under the
law to act as deputy collectors. This list
embraces Deputy Collector Farley, who
has been protected by the civil service
system. William Hamilton, familiarly
known as "Billy," was appointed cashier
by Collector Jackson at the request of
Senator Perkins. It is beueved that Mr.
Hamilton will be promoted to the posi
tion of auditor in place of Auditor Cope,
whose position has been a civil service
one. and that a very near friend and
namesake of the Collector will take the
office of cashier. Chief Clerk Jerome will
hold his position, as he appears to be in
dispensable.
The case of William J. Bryan, ex-Post
master of San Francisco, Is said to have
been an important factor in bringing
about the change in the system. While
Bryan was Postmaster one of the civil
service employes stole a large sum of
money and was convicted and sent to the
State Prison. Bryan's bondsmen were
sued by the Government for the amount
of the defalcation, and they set up as a
defense the fact that the thief had not
been appointed by Bryan and that he
could not discharge him and put a trust
ed man In his place before the emhezzle
ment came to light, and that therefore*
thf Government should stand the loss.
The United States Courts decided that
Bryan and his bondsmen were responsi
ble for the defalcation. From this de
cision the defendants appealed, and the
appeal was decided a few weeks ago by
United District Judge H. de Haven, who
affirmed the judgment of the lower court
and held that Bryan was responsible, and
that It was his duty to have kept so strict
a supervision over the civil service em
ployea that they would not have been
able to have stolen anything.
This decision naturally created conster
nation in the bosoms of Federal ofDce
holderg and their bondsmen, and a strong
pressure was brought to bear upon Presi
dent McKinley from all parts of the
United States to modify the civil service
j=o that employes in a fiduciary capacity
should be appointed and removed at will
by their superior officers.
Internal Revenue Collector Lynch,
whose district has as large an area as
the State of Maine, said the proclamation
would affect twenty-seven out of the
thirty of his deputies, but as they all
were Republicans he did not think he
would make any changes for purely po
litical reasons.

WHEELMEN'S PARADE
FOR GOOD ROADS
The organized wheelmen and a goodly
sprinkling of the unattached are taking
considerable Interest in the parade to be
held to-night, under the direction of the
Associated Cycling Clubs, to celebrate the
repaying of Market street.
The Olympic Wheelmen have made most
extensive preparations, each member be
ing furnished with a special uniform and
a new white wheel. The racing contin
gent will wear their relay suits with black
tights, and non-members or unattached
riUers, who turn out with the club, will be
provided with colors by the committee.
All will meet at the Olympic Club at 7:15
to-night, or at 14 Golden Gate avenue at
the same hour.
The Bay City Wheelmen will make a
good showing, and as their club house is
on the line of march, they will throw it
open to members, their lady friends and
visitors generally during the evening.
The Imperial Club will assemble at its
rooms at 7:30 o'clock and Captain Edward
W. Schneider will lead the lineup. The
Californlas will be in command of Cap
tain R. A. Coulter, and the San Francisej
Road Club under Joe Lewis.
The prize list for the parade was given
in The Call last Monday, and many indi
vidual riders and clubs hope to capture
one of the trophies offered. The start will
be at Hayes and Van Ness, to Golden
Gate, to Market, to Kearny and return
over the same route.
Truly the sensation of the week in cy
cling circles was the announcement made
exclusively in The Call yesterday that the
price of the chainless wheels, made by the
leading dealer in that make both here and
in the East, would be cut from $125 to $75
on November 1, and remain at that price,
their chain wheels coming, down propor
tionately. The only hardship it will work
will be to the rider who bought a '98
chain wheel for $75, as its second-hand
price will now be about $20.
All of the clubs will attend the Associ
ated Clubs' annual theater party to be
held at the Tivoli next Wednesday even
ing, November 2. Blocks of seats have
been reserved for them, and a Jolly time
is expected. Jules F. Hancock, 636 Mar
ket street, is in charge of the arrange
ments.
The Bay City Wheelmen will hold a
duplicate whist tournament Saturday
evening, November 12. Captain Menn'e
has a Targe corps of men in training for
the club's handicap road race on Novem
ber 13.
Will Knippenberg, prominent in the
trade at Los Angei'es, is in the city re
newing old acquaintances, and is making i
his headquarters at the Bay City club.
Floyd McFarland, the San Jose racing
man. has returned from the East and will
winter in California. He expects to go
back on the circuit again next season.
Leander Peckham of the Reliance Club,
who went East a month ago, writes the
cycling editor from Boston that he will be
back in less than a fortnight to reopen
the Overman branch that was closed
here some months ago.
Secretary James M. Hamilton of the
Cycle Board of Trade contributes the fol
lowing:
At a meeting held Thursday. October 20, IS9B,
!i c .. ff Â° nn Â° wln S resolution was unanimously
adopted: .
"Resolved. That the thanks of this organiza
tion are extended to the wheelmen's candidates
ror Supervisors of the expiring term, Messrs.
PcP cy any Rottanzi and Sheehan. who have
faithfully kept their pledges to the wheelmen
in the matter of improved streets and the re
paying of Market street, over which we are
now Jubilating."
On motion $50 was appropriated for the
purpose of adding: to the funds of the
good roads committee.
Edward Ross Lozier left'for Portland
an H L he Sound country Monday night. He
will be gone about two weeks and on his
return will spend another week in this
city before finally departing for his home
in Cleveland. H. W. SPALDING.
HUNTERS ARE WAITING
FOR ROUGH WEATHER
Politics and the glorious climate have
much to do with the present slim interest
that is taken by sportsmen in duck and
quail shooting. The weather of the past
few weeks has been a detriment to the
sport and only men of an extraordinary
fancy for shooting have ventured on up
landl or marsh in quest of game. A change
in me weather must result before sports
men can figure on anything that savors
a good bag. Clarence Haight and a friend I
grassed a nice bag of English snipe last
Sunday, but the location is kept within
their pockets. A hunter who returned i
yesterday from Fresno reports that wild '
duck are quite numerous in the fields !
that are irrigated and that the sports
men of Fresno are enjoying good shoot-
Ing. Ihe following letter explains itself:
BELMOXT, Oct. 24M838.
Sporting Editor Call. San Francisco: Hunt
ers for the wily rail were thick on Belmont
marsh yesterday. It was a sight to see the
strings of birds which almost without excep
tion every man carried away with him. A well
known dentist and his friend had over forty
mil, and a square estimate would he from
twelve to fifteen birds to the gun: all being
well satisfied with the day's fun. as the birds
were very lively and flushed easily compared
with last Sunday's experience.

CHARGED WITH
THE MURDER OE
HER SISTER
Aged Mrs. McLaugh
lin Under Arrest.
RESULT OF A QUARREL
MISS MARY DOUGHERTY KILLED
WITH A BILLET OF WOOD.
A Roomer in the House Named How
ard Also Locked Up on
Suspicion of
Guilt.
Miss Man' Dougherty, 67 years old, died
at the City and County Hospital yester
day morning it is supposed from the ef
fects of a beating administered in a
drunken' row by her sister, Mrs. Grace
McLaughlin. aged 63 years. She made a
statement to the effect that her sister had
beaten her on the head with a billet of
wood. Autopsy Surgeon Gallagher exam
ined the body of the dead woman at the
Morgue and found that death had been
caused by the blows on the head.
Mr*. McLaughlin, who Is accused of f
having caused her sister's death, visited j
the Morgue last night and anxiously in- j
quired if she could see the body. Deputy i
Coroner Tyrrell at once suspected that \
ehe was the dead woman's sister and pro
ceeded to question her. After satisfying
himself that she was the woman for
whom the police were looking. Tyrrell
sent for Police Officer Brodt, and he took j
her into custody.
At the City Prison the woman said that
instead of inflicting fatal injuries on her
sipter. her sister almost made a subject
for the Coroner out of her. Her appear
ance substantiated her statement as far
as the beating was concerned. Both of
her eyes were blackened, her lips were
swollen and her nose was fractured.
"It is untrue that I caused my sister's
Mrs. Grace McLaughlin, Who Is
Accused of Murdering Her
Sister.
death," she tearfully remarked. "Some
time ago she engaged me to take care of
the rooms in her house. We always got
along well together until this man How
ard appeared on â¢ the scene. For. some
reason he took an aversion to me, and in
every way tried to separate us. The day
my sister was so terribly beaten Howard
saw me going upstairs, and- in a loud
voice he declared that I was trying to
defraud her out of her property. A few
minutes later my sister accosted me and
after calling me several vile names she
struck me several" times with the cane
she always carried.. She continued to beat
me until I ran from the room and sought
refuge In my. own apartments.
"I am inclined to believe that Howard
Inflicted the injuries which caused my
poor sister's death. He seemed anxious
to get possession of the house. He has
made several overtures in that direction.
I swear I did not strike my sister, and
God knows I am telling the truth.
"Howard, in order to save himself, ha
told the police that I am my sister's mur
flerer, and they have seen fit to arrest
me."
Soon after Mrs. Mclaughlin was locked
up Detectives Reynolds and Dlnan ar
rested Howard. He was attending a po
iitical meeting, but hearing that the police
were after him he returned to the nous
and gave himself up to Reynolds and Di
nan, who were waiting for him.
He was immediately taken to the City
Prison and his name registered on the
"small" book. It is the intention of the
police to hold him pending further Inves
tigation. Howard emphatically denies
that he struck Miss Dougherty.
."It is true I roomed in her house," he
Â»aid when telling his story, "and knew
tier to be an honorable woman. At times
she would drink* too much, and when In
that condition she was Inclined to be
tigiy.
on the day her sister says she beat her
[ heard a row in the kitchen and went to
lee what the trouble was. Miss Dougherty
appeared in response to my knocking on
the door and started to limp across the
hallway. I asked her what the trouble
was. when she Informed me she was suf
fering from a blow on the head. As her
;ondition became worse I hired a carriage
and took her to the City and County Hos
pital.
"I did not know she was dead until a
friend told me."
Howard admitted he hau bought the
furniture in the house from Miss Dough
erty a few days before she received the
injuries which caused her death. He paid
her $95 for it. hut she did not have a cent
when searched at the hospital. The de
t.-. lives have been unable to get a trace I
pf the money, but tney are satisfied it was
Stolen after the unfortunate woman was
Injured.
Howard, Judging from his flippant re
marks, evidently regards his arrest as a |
huge joke. When he was escorted into the
prison he saw Mrs. McLaugnlin seated on
bench. Approaching the woman he :
askedher what she meant by saying he
was responsible, for her sister's death.
"I know enough about you." answered
Mrs. McLaughlin, "and I Intend to tell it
ill when the case is heard in court." I
Howard seemed to regard the remark
is a joke, and turning to the detectives
laughingly declared that the "old woman"
lid not know what she was speaking I
about.

NEW MILITARY HOSPITAL FOR THE PRESIDIO.
It Is to Cost $170,000 and Be Equipped With All the Most Modern Appliances.
THE new general military hospital to
be erected at the Presidio by the
Government is to be one of the most
perfect institutions of its kind in the
country. It is to cost Uncle Sam $170,000,
but only half of this amount is to be ex
pended at present. Colonel Middleton,
the chief surgeon of the department, has
had the matter in charge and he has
given it his closest and most careful at
Morrison. Albert Karlson and J. Bedford.
Next Monday when the trial is again
taken up the testimony of each witness
will be used as a basis upon which to
support the allegations and contentions
of the prosecution which tend to substan
tiate the story of the swindle as given
by Dean upon the witness stand.

Annie A. Bond's Answer.
Mrs. Annie A. Bond filed her answer
yesterday to the suit recently instituted
by her husband. Dr. F. T. Band, for di
vorce. Mrs. Bond denies her husband's
allegations of cruelty one and all. and in
a cross complaint charges her husband
with having abused her in a manner even
more cruel than he alleges she abused
him. In consequence she asks that he
be denied a divorce and that the decree
be entered in her favor, together with
alimony In the sum of $100 a month.

CYCLERS AND HORSEMEN CELEBRTE
THE REPAVING OF MARKET STREET
Ji Glittering Pageant of Wheels and Showy Traps Will Be
on View in To-Jiights Paradeâ T^e Route,
THE demonstration to-night under
the auspices of the California As

sumed unexpected proportions. The

novement have bent all their energies
o making it a success and have appar

The wheelmen Inaugurated the cru

nany influential bodies, so it was ht
ing the Riding and Driving Associa
ion and the teamsters should join in
:o-night's celebration.
Those in charge of the parade know
hat its success as a pageant depends
ilmost entirely upon the ability of the
jollce to keep the street from obstruc
tions. This has been impressed upon
the heads of the Police Department.

WOLF US GONE
AND HIS VAULT
FOUND EMPTY
Light on a Sudden
Disappearance.
THE EXECUTOR IS MISSING
PEAKSON ESTATE WILL LOSE
ABOUT $10,000.
Heirs Suspected They Had Been
Bobbed and the Suspicion Has
Now Become a
Certainty.
The vault in the First National Bank
used by John Wolf of the Wolf-Wreden
Company, t who so mysteriously disap
peared about two months ago. was opened
yesterday, and the dust of many weeks
was found in the place where the securi
ties and money belonging to the estate of
Sarah M. Pearson should be. The wise
men and heirs of the Pearson estate then
nodded their heads and said. "This ac
counts for the disappearance of the once
trusted Wolf."
One morning, about two months ago,
Wolf failed to put in an appearance at
his office. Neither was he seen around
accustomed haunts. Nothing was thought
of the matter, however, his associates and
friends being of the opinion that he was
indisposed or had left the city on a busi
ness trip. The days passed, and then
weeks, still no word from the missing
man. Suspicions of foul play then occu
pied the minds of his friend?, but they
were dispelled when word reached this
city that he had been seen, in Oregon and
later was recognized on the streets of
Chicago. The heirs of the Pearson estate,
of which Wolf was executor, then thought
it about time to commence investigations.
Application was made to Judge Troutt
for permission to open the vault, but as
a contest was entered by the bank the
order was denied. The bank wanted to
give Wolf more time within which to put
in an appearance. As he did not come
back within an agreed time, however, the
order was issued by the court, and yes
terday the vault was opened in the pres
ence of the bank otiicials and Attorney
W. J. Tuska, who has been retained by
the heirs of the Pearson estate. Not a
document or cent of money was found,
and the suspicions of the heirs were con
firmed.
Many non-negotiable instruments have
been taken, for what purpose is not
known, but in any event the estate is
short by reason of Wolf's disappearance,
it is said, about $10,000 in money and se
curities.

MRS. C. F. CURRY A
VICTIM OF PNEUMONIA
AFTER A FEW WEEKS' ILLNESS
DEATH BELIEVES HER.
Thursday She Was Cheerful and Full
of Hope, but a Complication
Arose Which Resulted
Fatally.
Death, for the third time in two years,
has again visited the home of Charles F.
Curry. Yesterday at noon his wife. Mrs.
Lilly Curry, passed away. A few weeks
ago she was stricken down with bron
chial pneumonia, but, notwithstanding
the seriousness of the nature of the dis
ease, but little apprehension as to the
outcome of the ailment occupied the
minds of her husband and children, as
the attending physician expressed his as
surance that a short time would see Mrs.
Curry on the road to health. A compli
cation arose without warning, however,
and death came within a few hours.
Thursday evening the sufferer was cheer
ful and full of hope, and those at her
bedside expressed the opinion that the
disease was passing away. Yesterday
morning Mrs. Curry suddenly became
weaker, the action of her heart Irregu
lar, her breathing laborious. It was ap
parent that a change for the worse had
taken place during the night, and the
physician was immediately summoned.
Jlis labors were fruitless, however, and
after lingering until about noon in a semi
conscious condition death relieved her.
Sorrow was carried into many homes
through the death of Mrs. Curry, bhe
was well and widely known, but none will
mourn her passing more than the host
of deputies in the office of the County
Clerk. All knew Mrs. Curry, either per
sonally or through hearing her many
friends tell of her gracious manner and
her kind and hospitable characteristics.
Mrs Curry was 34 years of age on the
first of last March. She was Miss Lilly
Seperly the daughter of one of the most
prominent families of Butte County, when
she married Mr. Curry. Besides her hus
band she leaves a son and a daughter,
and a host of friends whose whole sym
pathy goes out to them In their boreave-
m On August 25. 1896. C. M. Curry, father
of Charles F. Curry, died in the family
â¢Residence at 317 Oak street. A year later
his brother, W. K. Curry, was carried
from the home to the tomb, and yester
day Mrs. Curry succumbed to a dread
disease. It has left Mr. Curry heart
broken and without ambition, but his
friends are with him trying to cheer him
and in any way lessen his sorrow.

ALEXANDER HARRISON.
Welcomed by Distinguished Men and
Beautiful Women and Made an
Honorary Member of the
Art Institute.,
Distinguished men and beautiful women
met at the Hopkins Institute of Art last
evening, to testify their esteem of and
pay homage to T. Alexander Harrison,
the distinguished artist.
Twenty years ago Mr. Harrison was a
student at the institute, which yesterday

honor. He left a medal pupil to complete
his artistic studies abroad, and returns
famous throughout the continent as well
as in his native home.
Jo!Â»eph D. Grant, president of the Art
Institute, introduced Mr. Harrison last
evening, and his greeting was a eulogis
tic recital of the fame the artist had won.
At the conclusion of his neat little speech
Mr. Grant presented Mr. Harrison with a
certificate, making the celebrated artist
an honorary member of the Art Institute.
Mr. Harrison's response to his warm
greeting was a delicate mingling of pathos
and humor.
He spoke in tender tones of his old
teacher, Virgil Williams, and descanted
on the great changes twenty years had
wrought in the condition of the city artis
tically as well as commercially. Mr. Har
rison was followed by Horace Platt and
Irving' M. Scott, who made brief remarks
appropriate to the occasion. ?
An informal reception followed and the
several hundred guests assembled found
time to admire the many excellent pic
tures on exhibition from the brush of
Rollo Peters. I,atimer. Keith, Strong,
Mrs. Chittenden and Miss Lottie Colby
and others.
The music under the direction of Henry
Heyman was one of the attractive fea
