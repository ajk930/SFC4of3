from the letter written by
the Spanish Minister at
Washington.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 8.
Penor Dupuy de Lome promises to be
the Sackville West of Spanish diplo
macy, and that the smooth representa
tive of land of the castanet will be
given his paseports to-morrow or as
soon thereafter as the unrolling of
red tape will permit, may be regarded
as a matter of course, provided he does
not prove a letter to a friend in his
own handwriting to be a forgery of the
rankest kind.
The letter in question was received
here late to-night and created a sen
sation. Should it prove to be genuine,
as those responsible for it say it will
be, the effect on Congress will be tre
mendous. The letter was written to
Senor Canalejas, one of Spain's ex-cab
inet ministers who lately made a tour
of Cuba, and in it President McKinley
is referred to as "a low fellow, little in
statesmanship, who delights in truck
ling to the rabble." Canalejas is urged
to have some good men sent here that
the attention of the members of the
American Senate may be diverted from
the real Cuban question by "appealing
to the self-interest of this nation of
shopkeepers."
It is due Senor do Lome to say that
though he at first refused to discuss
the letter he late to-night addressed a
note to the press, in which he pro
nounced the document a rank forgery,
adding that he would Indeed be foolish
were he even to think such things of
President McKinley, much less put
them in writing. The pro-Cuban ele
ment, in and out of Congress, however,
profess to believe De Lome wrote the
letter, and say that to-morrow will
witness such scenes in and about the
national capital as have not been
witnessed since the stormy period of
war between the States. The following
!s a translation of the full text of the
letter:
Legation de Espana,

SENOR DON JOSE CANAL
EJAS â My Distinguished and Dear
Friend: You need not apologize for
not having written me; I also ought to
have written you, but have not done
so on account of being weighed down
with work and nous sommes quittes.
The situation here continues un
changed. Everything depends on politi
cal and military success in Cuba. The
prologue of this second method of war
fare will end the day that the colonial
Cabinet shall be appointed, and it re
lieves us in the eyes of this country of
a part of the responsibility of what may
happen there, and they must cast the re
sponsibility upon the Cubans, whom
believe to be so immaculate.
Until then we will not be able to see
clearly, and I consider it to be a loss of
time and an advance by the wrong
road â t # he sending of emissaries to the

THREE CUBAN RESOLUTIONS
PRESENTED IN THE SENATE.
BY MASON.
Resolved, That the
President of the
United States be, and
hereby is, requested
to notify Spain and
the insurgents of Cu

called) must at once

constituted, and the discovery of the
intentions and purposes of this Govern
ment.
The exiles will return, one by one,
and when they return will come walk
ing into the sheepfold, and the chiefs
will gradually return. Neither of these
had the courage to leave en masse and
they will not have the courage thus to
return.
The message has undeceived the in
surgents, who expected something else,
and has paralyzed the action of Con
gress, but I consider it bad. Besides
the natural and inevitable coarseness
with which he repeats all that the press
and public opinion of Spain has said
of Weyler shows once more that
McKinley is weak and catering to the
rabble, and besides is a low politician
who desires to leave the door open to
me and to stand well with the jingoes
of his party.
Nevertheless, as a matter of fact it
will only depend on ourselves whether
he will prove bad and adverse to us. I
agree entirely with you, without mili
tary success nothing can be accom
plished there, and without military and
political success there is here always
danger that the insurgents will be en
couraged, if not by the Government, at
least by public opinion.
I do not believe you pay enough at
tention to the role of England. Nearly
all the newspaper canaille which swarms
in your hotel are English, and at the
same time that they are correspondents
of journals here they are also corre
spondents of the best newspapers and
reviews of London.
Thus it has been since the begin
ning. To my mind the only object of
England is that Americans should oc
cupy themselves with us and leave her
in peace, and if there is war so much
the better; that would further remove
what is threatening herâ although that
will never happen.
It would be most important that you
â should agitate the question of commer
cial relations, even though it would be
only for effect, and that you should
send here a man of importance in order
that I might use him to make propa
ganda among Senators and others fn
opposition to the junta and to win over
the exiles.
There goes Amblard. I believe he
comes too deeply taken up with little
political matters, and there must be
something very great or we shall lose.
Adele returns your salutation, and we
wish you in the new year to be the mes
senger of peace, and take this new
year's present to poor Spain. Always

BY ALLEN.
Resolved, That a
condition of public
war exists between
the Government of
Spain and the gov
ernment proclaimed
and for some time
maintained by force
of arms by the peo
ple of Cuba, and that
the United States of
America shall main

Resolved, By the
Senate that the Pres

States Is urged to no
tify the kingdom of
Spain that if Spain
shall fail to recognize
the independence of
the republic of Cuba
on or before the 4th
day of March, 1898,
the Government of
the United States
will on that date rec
ognize the belliger
ency of the Cuban
patriots and will
within ninety days
thereafter assert the
independence of the
republic of Cuba.
your attentive friend and servant, who
kisses your hands,
ENRIQUE DUPUY DE LOME.
Those who have seen the original
letter and who are familiar with the
chirography of De Lome have no hesi
tancy in pronouncing it genuine. Be
sides it is written on the official paper
of the Spanish Legation.
How It came into the hands of the
Cuban delegation when it was address
ed from Washington to Havana before
Canalejas left Cuba for Spain, is ex
plained as an act of patriotism by a
Cuban secret agent in Havana, who,
knowing the contents of the letter, and
desiring to expose to the world the
character of Spanish diplomacy, stole
the letter in Havana at the risk of his
own life. Photographic copies of it were
taken to-day by several persons, and
many who know the handwriting of
de Lome came * the office, attracted
by curiosity, to see the letter. They all
declared it absolutely genuine.
President McKinley has heard of the
letter, but will not publicly discuss a
matter of such delicacy. After the
'. letter, although private, is brought to
â  the notice of the country he may feel
constrained to take official notice of
! it. It can be stated, however, that
; whatever action is taken it will not be
| until after it is clearly established that
Mr. De Lome wrote the letter. I un
derstand ' that the course will be to
have Mr. Woodford call the attention
of the Madrid authorities to the pub
lication of the letter. It is assumed
that the Spanish Minister of Foreign
Affairs will at once call upon Mr. De
; Lome for an explanation. On this will
I depend his further relations as Span
; ish Minister.
An admission on his part that he
: wrote the letter will, It is assumed
here, be justification for his recall by
his own Government without any di
: rect request for it by this Government.
This, I was to-ld by a high official of
. the Government, would be the easiest
: way out of the unfortunate difficulty,
; and would avoid any rupture in our
relations with Spain which might en
sue should the Madrid authorities not
: recall De Lome on their own account.
A direct precedent for this course was
furnished when Minister Muruaga,
Senor De Lome's Immediate predeces-
I sor, was quietly recalled by his Gov
| ernment on the suggestion of the
I United States on account of his .criti
| cism in a newspaper interview of the
' course of Secretary Gresham in regard
; to the Allianca affair.

LONDON, Feb. 9.â The Daily
News publishes this morning an
Interview which David
Murray, the novelist and play
wright, has had with Mme. Drey
fus. She said that after her
husband's arrest Major Paty
dv Clam visited her on seven
teen consecutive days, denounc
ing her husband as a scoundrel
and traitor and alternately
threatening and cajoling her in
the hope that she would con
fess her husband's guilt. But
she revealed nothing, because
she had nothing to reveal, and
she now says it was impossible
that her husband could have
confessed himself guilty, inas
much as he was Innocent.
PARIS, Feb. S.â When the trial of
M. Emile Zola and M. Perleux, mana
ger of the Aurore, growing out of the
former's denunciation of the Esterhazy
court-martial in a lettflf to the news-
i paper named, was res:) aed In the As
size Court of the SenÂ»- to-day scenes
similar to those of yesterday wore wit
nessed. When the court opened there
was a terrific struggle to enter, people
fighting their way with blows and
kicks toward the hall.
The entrance of If. Zola was the sig
nal for an outburst, during which the
few cries of "Vive Zola!" were drowned
by shouts of "A bas Zola!" When the
Judge entered the scene was so tumul
tuous that he directed the Municipal
Guards to force the crowds from the
doors, and to remove some of the
people from the overcrowded halls. M.
Rochefort was cheered when he ar
rived.
The presiding Judge, M. de la Gor
gue, read a letter from Count Eater
hazy, in which the latter refused to
; testify. Thereupon M. Laborie, ooun
\ sel for M. Zola, insisted that Esterhazy
should he brought to court by force.
The court admitted the claims of the
defense, and decided that General Mer
cier, the former Minister of War, and
Major Paty dv Clam, should be sum
moned. The court also decided that
the other witnesses alleged to be ill
should be visited by a doctor, and that
if found able to appear they should be
summoned.
Mme. Dreyfus was the first witness.
She was dressed in black and was
much distressed. M. Lnborie asked
her whether she could say under what
circumstances she was informed by
Major Paty dv Clam, in 1594, of her
husband's arrest. The Judge declined
to put the question.
M. Zola here arose and cried: "I de
sire the safne treatment as the assassin
or the thief. They have always the
right to defend themselves, but I am
deprived of this. lam mocked and in
sulted in the streets and the obscene
press drags me in the mud. You see
gentlemen of the jury, the position I
am in. I wish to have my witnesses
heard, but I am prevented."
"But do you not know the law?" the
Judge asked.
"No, I don't know, and don't want to
know," was Zola's reply.
This scene caused great excitement
among the spectators.
M. Laborie demanded that the ques
tions be put. The Judge answered: "I
will enter your protest, if y ou desire,
but will not put the questions which
are foreign to the indictment in order
to arrive at a revision of the Dreyfus
case, which has already been deter
mined."
Thereupon M. Laborie exclaimed: "In
the presence of the obstructions placed
I in our way" [Cries of "No, no, quite
right!] "I have the honor to .ask what
means we should employ?"
â¢'That does not concern me," answer
ed the Judge, whereat there was laugh
â  ter.
M. Laborie then proposed to submit '
a list of questions, leaving the court to
indicate which of them might be put,
and the session was suspended in order
for the questions to be drawn up.
During the interval the noise in the
court was deafening. Every one dis
cussed the case at the top of his or her
voice with such intensity of excitement
that the faces of the disputants were
distorted. .In the meanwhile Mme.
Dreyfus retired to the witness room,
where she was seized with a violent fit
of hysterics.
On the resumption of the session of
the court M. Laborie presented a state
ment claiming the right to ask Mme.

Escapes Death in the
Awful Plunge.

PORTLAND, Or Feb. B.â ln the
thundering waters of Willamette Falls
four men were swept to death at a few
minutes past 7 o'clock this morning.
Confused in the dense bank of fog
while crossing the river in a boat a
short distance above Oregon City, and
while trying to find their bearings,
their craft was seized by the mighty
current and hurled to d struction.
Five men started on the ride to what
seemed inevitable death, but one mirac
ulously escaped He was almost insen
sible from the shock and could not
have held out a minute longer when
he was picked up by the rescuers, who
got out in time to see the boat go over
the falls.
Three of the victims of the accident
â¢were members of the same family. All
were employes of the Crown Paper
Mills at -.egon City. They were resi
dents of -anemah. and were on their
way to work. The lost are: George
Freeman, 50 years old, of Canemah,
married; George and James Freeman,
his sons, 26 and 16 years old, respect
ively; L. J. Shannon, 36 years old, of
Canemah, married, and leaves a wife
and four children.
Shortly before 7 o'clock the five men
met as usual at their embarking point.
Freeman senior was at the oars. He
rowed along the usual course and head
ed for the west bank of the river. It
probably did not occur to the occupants
of the boat that the Willamette had
been rising very rapidly since Sunday,
and it is supposed the current carried
the boat farther than they 'suspected
before the discovery was made that
something was wrong. In the dense
fog it was not possible to locate famil
iar sierns and in that pray mist the men
had no warning but the ominous, suiien
roar of the falls as they drew nearer
and nearer the most dnngerous point.
Suddenly the cheery chat of the boys
was interrupted. The boat gave a wild
lurch as the main torrent struck it. In
the same instant all five of the men
discovered that they were far below
the usual point of crossing and that
the powerful current was carrying
them down at a velocity that increased
every second. Additional hands were
put to the oars and an attempt was
made to pull out of the swirling, rush-
Ing stream.
In wild despair each man clung to
the plunging craft in the rapids, which
swept it along at express train speed.
The occupants of the boat began to
shout an alarm. Their cries reached
the ears of some of the employes at the
power station of the Portland General
Electric Works. Rushing out on the
trestle walk which runs into the store ;
they could but discern the outlines of
the boat containing several men. A
general alarm was then given. A boat
put out from the electric works, but it
was some time before the rescuers
could see anything of the ill-fated
party. There iras little hope of seeing
either the boat or its occupants.
The rescuers rowed around the big
eddies to Che west side of the river.
Muffle*. c*iÂ«3 caused them to row to
ward the bank. There they saw an up
turned boat slowly drifting about.
Harry Freeman had just scrambled on
to the bank and lay there completely
exhausted.
Later Freeman revived and stated
that he had left a man clinging under
neath, and that he had shouted once
or twice for help. In his exhausted
condition, he said, it was Impossible
for him to tell whether it was one
of his brothers or Shannon. The sur
viving member of the party was re
moved to a house near by. where re
storatives were applied. The frightful
experience made him almost incapable
of speaking coherently. He could
scarcely remember how It happened,
and in the blinding mists he could not
see the others. He remembered the
shouts of his father as the boat
made the leap. "When it reached calm
water again there was no one to be
seen.
In the present high water it is not
probable that the bodies of the drowned
men will be recovered. The Willamette
is rising rapidly and is now ten feet
above low water mark.

TOLD THE
STORY OF
THEJTtECK
He Could No Longer
Stand the Pricking
of Conscience.
Unburdened His Mind
of Its Load of
Guilt.
Gave Names of Many Others
Who Were Implicated in
the Crime.
SIMPLY OBEYED ORDERS.
Says He Went Blindly to tho Work
Without Knowing What He
Was Doing.
One more murderer has confessed to
his misdeeds. One more man, goaded
by the prickings of a guilty conscience,
has unburdened his soul and admitted
his participation in crime.
Salter D. Worden has sent to Gov
ernor Budd a full confession of his
complicity in the wrecking of the train
whereby Engineer Clark met his death
during the great strike of 1894.
The confession, in the convicted
man's own writing, bearing the date of
the 2d inst., was filed in the Governor's
office yesterday by Warden Aull of the
Folsom prison.
It is more than a confession. It is
an accusation. It gives the names of
others who were also connected with
the crime, and in extenuation of his
guilt Worden pleads that he did not
know what he was doing, but blindly
obeyed orders of others.
It is a startling document, and from
it may arise sensational developments
equal in tragic sequence to any which
have arisen in connection with the
great crime for which Worden stands
convicted and is under the sentence of
death.
It was not an easy matter to induce
Worden to open his lips and reveal hi 3
connection with the crime , but the
agency which finally accomplished this
persisted, until at last the seal was
broken. Those directly instrumental in
securing this confession were Warden
Aull, S. Z. Wilcox, a brother-in-law of
the doomed man, and Rev. Whiting
Worden, Salter's brother, who is a
missionary to Japan.
Warden Aull has labored long and
earnestly with the condemned man urg
ing him to make a clean breast of the
whole matter, while his brother and
brother-in-law wrote him many letters
beseeching him not to go before his
Maker with a lie on his lips, if he were
guilty. To this pressure Worden fin
ally yielded, and has given a statement
which bears upon its face the stamp of
sincerity and truth. Men not hereto
fore thought to be involved in the
crime have been implicated, while other
names are mentioned as principals in
the conspiracy that belong to men who
have been connected with the crime by.
implication and surmise.
Warden Aull said yesterday that
Worden seemed to feel much better
since making the confession, and he
now has the bearing of a man who is
relieved of a heavy burden. No hope of
reward or mitigation of his sentence
has been held out to him. and he says
that he is now ready to meet whatever
fate is in store for him.
Following is the confession :
To His Excellency, the Governor of
California, Hon. James Budd I came
back to Sacramento in search of work
some time the last of January or the
first parT of February. 1894. but did not
obtain any until April, when I went
to work in the repair department under
Mr. Douglass. In May, I think about
the middle, there was a lodge .of the
American Railway Union organized in
Sacramento, of which I became a mem
ber and in the election of officers I was
elected as a delegate to attend the con
vention in the city of Chicago in the
following month (June) and represent
them, that is, the Sacramento lodge,
and for which I was to receive $o per
day, while absent, and they were also
to furnish me transportation there and
return I got leave of absence from
Mr Douglass for thirty days, and he
also knew where I was going. I had
a pass from Sacramento to Ogden, and
return which was obtained for me by
the committee appointed for that pur
pose, and was advanced, the sum of
fifty' (SSO) dollars, and was to have
more sent me to Chicago in care of
officers there, and they did send me,
just before my return, twenty-five dol
lars, by the secretary, John F. Doughty.
When I got up that morning I felt
all broke up and tired, but after taking
two drinks started for headquarters on
Front street and then learned that
United States troops had come that
morning. Room was full, but Knox
nor others were not there; went back
to breakfast at Tremont House; was
about Ba. m. ; then went to Front street
again; found Knox was at new rooms.
Second and J streets, and went there
and talked for maybe a half hour of_
trip to StOCftton and coming from Lath
rop. I was feeling good then. Talked
with Generalâ probably ton or twelve
there.
Went back to hotel, and about one
half hour man came over and said
Harry wanted .3 sÂ«=:e me. I started
right over and met himâ Knox â at
foot of stairs at building. He said
he wanted me to get a team to carry
eight men, and wanted me to go with
them to Dr.visville. Told me Kelly
was going and know all about it,
and gave me the order.
I started across the street; met Kelly
. He asked me if
1 wai â  team â if I had seen
Knox. i .He told me to
to the house for him; said all
risht. and went down Second street
to stable, betw -1; K. and L.. bi:t they
had no v ag< a to carry so many, and
told roe Wilson had carriage, if it was
In. 1 went to Wilson's; presented or
der; think i\as the young man. He
said would not let the team go
without driver went. I said all
right, send driver, and they started
to hitch up. He called the young man
and told him not to drive fasi on ac
â  of heat, and by their clock was
10:30. Went to F6urth Btreet. then to
L street, dbwn 1. to Second, to K.
and drove through alley from X to J
to hotel; went into hotel for Kelly,
but ho left word tor me to come to
Washington, where he would meet me;
drove to Second and Second to the
turn by the bridge; was there halted
by soldiers. 1 ."-truck horses with whip,
and boy gave me lines. As th.-v
Bprung forward they struck a citizen,
and, I thought, knocked him down. I
pulled them di â¢â â  :i before got to bridge,
and when we got to draw I tolu him
to drive on and wait at end of bridge â
probably some one would meet him,
and s see if the man who
; was hurt, but
not learn; might have been ten
or fifteen minutes tvhen 1 again went
tss bridge. Team was not in
one in front of sa
loon; said team with Hatch and Kelly
rove in by oilhouse track.
I went there and found these
n men. Hatch, Appleman, Kel
ly. Uaim (Barrett, I think), Wheel er.
:uid brakeman. on Oregon division,
whese name I don't know. But he
is the man arrested after Appleman,
and was discharged after examina
tion, and waiting, they said, for me,
asked me if I was ready.
It was Appleman asked, and Kelly
spoke and said .would tell me about lit
as we went; said was going to Davis;
I said all right, and all get in, Hatch,
boy and myself on front seat, Barrett,
Dunn and Appleman in middle, and
others on back seat. They ail objected
to the driver, p.nd he said he would go
If the team went, and I told them that
was the only way could got the team,
and could see no reason why he should
not. I said couldn't understand why
not. No more was said; we started;
boy was driving, and went in direc
tion of Davis.
1 tried to find out object of trip,
but they said 1 knew as well as they
did, but it's truth, I did net.
Applemari had a rifle, and I know
they all had â . !v- ra except myself; 1
B to put his up; he had
it in his hand fingering, and he sat
me. Nothing was said
that gave any Intimation of the object
â¢ trip by any one. When we came
to a ruaa that turned to the left, and
which Hatch raid was the road to Da
vis, he told the boy to turn there,
which was done, and we drove toward
the track.
As I wish to be positive, and that you
know these men, and that I have
nenred them correctly, I will state
where those worked whom I knew.
Hatch and Appleman are known. The
brakeman who was arrested and then
discharged broke for Conductor Jor
dan, I think, on freight; Thomas Kelly
was an extra switchman in the yard,
anil was also then, or had been, a mem
ber of the B. "i R. T., and from close
to where Knox was from in Michigan.
think heard him say; Wheeler was
from Michigan, b i I was told; did not
know him but very slightly; Barrett, I
thrhk his name, work".! in the section
puns in iiiÂ» yard under the old man
who had been foreman so lung; had no
knowledge of him before thi-w day;
James Dunn worked in the same'sec
tion gang in the yard, and boarded at
game hotel I did, had known him sinot
lodge was organized; have never seen
any of them since that day except the
three who were arrested.
When we arrived at track, instead of
crossing team was turned side of road
and stopped and all pot out; team wag
'tied to fence; the boy stayed with
â team; Hatch bad a wrench and Dunr>
a track-bar, which was first I had seen
.'of -them, and Appleman his rifle.
I said to Kelly: What are you
going to do? and was told they were
going to take up the rails, and I
stopped still and said I would have
nothing to do with it. I was at once
surrounded by all, and Appleman
swore he would kill me then and
there, and all put their revolvers at
my head and said the same, and
made me swear I would be silent.
Appleman said I ought to be killed
anyway. I begged for my life, as I
believed they would have killed
me. I could do nothing else, and
began to realize the fix I was in,
and what they intended to do. Ap
pleman made me walk ahead of him,
below road crossing, and said he
would kill me if I made a move, and
he would. Others went the other
way toward trestle, and stopped
about 400 or 500 yards from where
we were. Hatch, Dunn and Kelly
went to work at track, and Barrett
and brakeman were at work close to
them, and the man Whseler went
.across trestle.
T could not poe if he was doing any
thing over thereâ while we (Appleman l
and myself) he had rifle toward me all
the time, and no thoughts of attempt- !
ing to get away or make a move enter- j
ed my head; T was entirely used up
and afraid, as he Had the name of be- :
Ing a bau man. He had been there only
a short time at side of track when a
man came from Sacramento on one of
these velocipede cars; when Appleman
'saw him he told me he should stop '
-him. and said if I did not keep still he ''
whhW fix me: he stopped -him and
made him leave his bag on sidetrack. '
and to throw his car down thp bank :
and then to leave the track by the !
wagon road. Telegraph repairer saw !
me piainly. bur could not have recog- i
nixed me. as he I don't think testified !
stgainpt me. Am sure he was badly â 
frightened. Applem&o had on a white '
.Tint. We were (Appleman and myself)
about fifty yards from crossing toward
Sacramento. In a few minutes Kelly, '
I think, hallowed all right, and Apple
man says will go and start for wagon.
And all got in. I think same position' I
After we had got nearly to main
road heard loud shout, and Barrett
sa-id "there she goes'' â or something
like it.
Instead of going back same way as
-we came we went to the left and drove
for I cannot say how far â maybe four
or five miles â maybe not so far, as it
was very hot, and team got very warm
and boy pulled them to a walk. Apple
man then commenced to curse and for
to go faster, but-all others said not, and
he again threatened me, but I could
pay nothing. One horse became quite
warm and had to stop several times,
and then they proposed to leave the
team and to some place where I
think Hatch could get a boat, and fin
ally did stop and all got out but my
self and boy. They insisted on my also
going, but I proved to them that I was
unable to. I was entirely unstrung and
unnerved. They went up the road, and
bey and I turned around and started
back. 1 must have gone to sleep; boy
says I did, as first I remember he spoke
to me and pointed toward the wreck,
and I then began to realize the position
I was in, and what 1 could do, and saw
that wrench and track bar was in
! wagon and stopped and threw them
owr the fence, a? stated. The package j
of dynamite which was found in wagon
I never .saw, and must have been left
by Barrett or brakeman, as Barrett
was one that had it, so they all thought.
We drove on and two or three men
asked to ride and got in, and when
we came to a saloon they bought
Irinks and then went on. Do not re
member as had any conversation or
probably correctly. Cannot say just
how far out of Washington I left
wagon, but evidence is probably cor
net, but 1 was passed by switch en
gine going with wrecking car.
Got drink in Yolo and then walked
directly to headquarters, Second and J
streets, to see what I could do. Jack
Hurley was there and told me Knox,
Cumpton and Mullin had gone to din
ner. Laid down on bed and fell asleep,
and was awakened by Knox and others
when they came in. Think Treasurer
ParKer was one of them; can't say
whether Hurley was there or not. Knox
asked me if I went with the team, and
I accused him then of using me, and
told themâ Knox, Mullin and Compton
â all that I told here and how I had
been treated and made a fool of. He
said I must be silent, and there was
nothing to connect me but the boy
driver, and that was bad.
I accused them of knowing what j
was going to be done and they did
not deny it, but said I must have
known as well.
But I agreed to keep silent, and what â 
elsecould I do? Boy came in then about
an hour and was paid by Knox. I j
only left rooms to go over to i
Rhodes' to get drink, and then came !
back. This was before boy came for I
his pay, and then went to get J
lunch to restaurant on X street. I '
am accused of going to stable to get
dynamite, which was found, and where
I was arrested, but, as I stand before j
my God I knew nothing of it, and j
what I have stated was the truth. I ;
wish to say here on that morning I j
did not know of any trains to be sent <
out until I saw wreck, and was not j
at depot.
In conclusion, Governor, I feel that I
have done my full duty to society in
making this statement, let the conse
quences be what they may to myself
or anyone else. I have told the full
truth, and I feel in my heart that the
blood of Sam Clark is not on my head.
I have led a wild, reckless, and per
haps a foolish life, but with death star
ing nia in the face, and as I have hopes
of a hereafter, my conscience is guilt
less of the crime of murder. In the
name of my family, who have always
borne a high and honorable reputation
wherever known, I plead with you to
save me from an ignominious death,
and my family from everlasting dis
grace. Respectfully.

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1898.
ATTORNEY FEE
HELD FOR TRIAL
Madera Lawyer to An
swer to a Forgery
Charge.
! Accused of Having Altered a
Claim Against His
Client.
Sensational Outgrowth of the Finan
cial Difficulties of Watkins
& Prosser.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MADEKA, Feb. B.â The preliminary
examination of Francis A. Fee, charged
with forgery, which has been in pro
gress at Madera since last Friday, was
brought to a close this afternoon at 2
o'clock. Fee was held for trial.
The charge against the accused grew
out of a transaction some time ago be
tween the Commercial Bank of this
place and Watkina & Prosser, a lumber
firm of this county. The lumber firm
became somewhat embarrassed finan
cially, and, among other creditors, it
owed the Commercial Bank a consider
able sum. In the transaction of which
the alleged forgery is said to have been
the outgrowth the Commercial Bank
was to assume all the liabilities of the
lumber firm and take the prpperty con
nected with the lumber business off the
lumber firm's hands, and thus reach
some amicable adjustment of the in
debtedness of the lumber firm to the
bank.
Among other liabilities which it is
claimed the bank was to assume under
this agreement was a claim of about
12000 due from the lumber firm to Ros
enthal & Kutner. Prosser, one of the
lumber firm, and the prosecuting wit
ness, .and Attorney R. L. Hargrove,
swear positively that the claim of Ros
enthal & Kutner was in the agreement
and list of liabilities. The defendant,
Fee, is charged with having tampered
with the instrument, by removing the
names of Rosenthal & Kutner. Fee
was acting as the attorney for the
Commercial Bank at the time the al
leged alteration was made.
Much contradictory testimony was
| given in the investigation, which occu
| pied more time than any preliminary
examination heretofore held in the
county. The peculiar nature of the
charge, besides the rather sensationaJ
developments and the prominence of
the persons directly and indirectly con
cerned, has occasioned considerable in
terest. At the termination of the in
vestigation the defendant was held to
answer before the Superior Court, his
j bail being fixed at $2000.
ZOLA'S TRIAL.
Continued from First Page.
I Dreyfus certain questions in the Inter
! est of Justice.
The Advocate-General, M. Vnnoassel,
argued that the court could not read-
Judicate facts already legally deckled,
and. turning to M. Zola, he exclaimed:
"You say you do not know the law
and do not want to know it. Well, we
do know the law, and will have it re
spected, with the aid of a jury, in
which we have the most complete con-
I fidence."
This apostrophe evoked remarks of
approval. M. Laborie responded with
great warmth, protesting against the
obstruction of which his client was the
victim. Finally M. Zola said he would
submit to the law and to justice, add
ing: "I do not revolt against the law,
as my words have implied. What I
want, gentlemen, is that you end your
hypocritical schools."
This remark was greeted with shouts
of "Bravo! bravo!" and murmurs of
dissent. The court then decided against
the defense, saying that no question
not contained In the indictment would
be allowed.
M. Scheurer-Kestner, who was next
examined, said he learned last July
that Colonel Picquart had discovered
that the borderau had not been written
by Dreyfus, and he submitted Major
Esterhazy's handwriting to M. Bertil
lon, who agreed that it was in the
tame hand as the borderau. Witness
suggested to General Gonz that a fresh
expert examination be made, but the
general dissuaded him from so doing.
At this Etasre of the proceedings, M.
Scheurer-Kestner was about to give
the giÂ»t of the correspondence between
General Gona and Colonel Picquart,
showing that General Gonz favored re
opening the Dreyfus case, but the pre
siding Judge ruled that the evidence
was inadmissible.
M. Laborle then intervened, saying:
"I ask that these letters be read in
court. M. Zola was aware of the ex
istence of these letters. It is time light
is thrown into the case."
The Judge, however, reiterated that
the letters were inadmissible as pre
vious notice had not been given. This
caused M. Laborie to remark: "There
is still time to communicate them to
you and to the jury."
"You know that is impossible, re
plied the Judge, "as the law formally
forbids it."
M. Scheurer-Kestner further said
that he never mentioned the name of
Esterhazy, except to the Government.
But some time later, Mathieu Dreyfus
(brother of Alfred Dreyfus) came to
him and declared that he also had dis
covered that Esterhazy was the au
thor of the bordereau, whereupon the
witness told Mathieu Dreyfus to write j
to the Minister of War, which he did, I
denouncing Esterhazy.
M. Zola here asked Scheurer-Kestner
to give the court the details of his in
terview with the Minister of War, and
the witness did so, recounting how he
had begged his old friend to take the
initiative in the matter, adding: "I
gave him a fortnight to make up his
mind, during which time I was in
sulted as a Prussian."
"Yes," interjected M. Zola, "as they
now treat me as an Italian."
There was much stir in court when
it was announced that M. Casimir-
Perier, the former President of the
French Republic, would be the next
witness.
When he was called the presiding
judge said* "You swear to speak with
out animus and fear, to speak the truth
and nothing but the truth â "
M. Casimir-Perier at this point in
terrupted the Judge, saying: "Pardon
me. I cannot swear to tell the truth,
because I cannot do so. It is my duty
not to tell it."
This statement caused a commotion
among the audience. The presiding
Judge resumed: "The law compels
you, before speaking or refusing to tes
tify, to take the oath."
M. Casimir-Perier then took th<?
oath.
"Can you say," asked M. Laborie, "if
when you were President you knew be
fore his arrest that a staff officer was
suspected of treason, and that charges
had been made against him?"
The presiding Judse intervened, say
ing, "You cannot ask that."
This intervention aroused murmurs
in court.
Counsel for M. Zola then put another
question to M. Pasir.-i; -Perier, saying,
"Did M. Casimir-Perier know that a
secret tile of papers existed at the War
Ministry?"
"1 was not fi^are of a file of papers
concerning Major Ksterhazy." was the
reply.
"Did you," continued M. L<aborie,
"know that a secret document was
handed to the court martial?"
"You cannot ask t'.iat question," in
terrupted the Presiding Judge, a state
ment which caused renewed murmurs
in court.
"I do not know any facts subsequent
to my Presidency," said M. Casimir-
Perier. "I can only speak as a pri
vate citizen," which I am willing to
do."
"You are pitting a noble example,"
replied M. Lnborie, "which other wit
nesses have not deemed nt to follow,
since it has been necessary to bring
them here by force." (Applause.)
Th/Â» court then rose, amid great ex
citement and shouts for and against
Zola.
On leaving the witness-box M. Casi
mir-Perier received a great ovation.
There was a big crowd outside the low
er court and after the people were leav
ing the building a man cried: "Vive
Zola. Down with France!" He was
immediately arrested.
A tremendous rush followed. M.
Zola, on emerging from the Jury door,
was recognized and obliged to return
and seek refuge in the robing rooms,
the doors of which were then locked.
The crowd remained outside, yelling:
"ConspUez Zola," etc., led by a number
of young barristers in their robes, who
roughly handled M. Zola's sympathiz
ers. Until a detachment of republican
guards cleared the courtyard there was
an immense clamor and shouts of
"Down with Zola!" Long HveZola!"and
"Death to Zola." the last cry dominat
ing the others. The novelist had diffi
culty in keeping his feet amid the surg
ing crowd.
In the meantime the polioe, misun
derstanding their orders, closed the
gates and M. Zola thus found himself
inside the courtyard, surrounded by a
howling, threatening .mob. The police
were powerless, and, for a moment, It
looked as though he would be lynched,
with the friends who formed his body
guard. His friends rallied around him,
and eventually the gates were reopened
and the police, having been reinforced,
escorted M. Zola to the street, while the
majority of the mob was confined in
the courtyard, shrieking threats
against the novelist, who eventually
entered a cab and drove quickly away.
The women in the crowd were especial
ly violent. A man who cheered for
Zola was set upon by a mob, who
hustled him to the St. Mich.-iel bridge,
where they tried to throw him into the
river Seine, but the police were in
formed in the nick of time and saved
him.
The crowd remained in the courtyard
and greeted M. Rochefort's exit with
great cries of "Vive l'Armee" and "Vive
la France." They were eventually dis
persed.
DE LOME ABUSES
THE PRESIDENT
Continued from First Page.
to-night that the original of the letter
may be turned over to the State De
partment in Washington. If it can be
shown that the letter is genuine it un
doubtedly will result in Senor Dupuy
de Lome getting his passports from
Secretary Sherman. Mr. Rubens, in
making the letter public, said:
"We know absolutely that this letter
is genuine, a man risked his life to ob
tain it. We do not hesitate to acknowl
edge that it was stolen from Canalejas.
It is written on the paper of the lega
tion. The handwriting is De Lome's and
the signature la his. He may deny it
until he is black in the face, but it is
genuine, and everybody who has seen It
-;â --â â>
knows that it is. The man who stole
it abstracted it from the envelope, and
left the latter. If he had attempted to
steal the envelope, or had stolen the en
velope he never would have gotten
away with the letter. The stealing of
a little correspondence is not an indict-
able offense, or, at leapt it is not extra
ditable, and all is fair in love and war."
FORMER ATTACKS
OF SENOR DE LOME.
While a Youth He Cast Vile Slurs
Upon the Nation and Its Fair
Women.
NEW YORK, Feb. B.â The letter pro
duced by the Junta recalls a former at
tack made by Senor de Lome on the
United States, written when he was
a young man. It was a youthful in
discretion. The attack of Senor de
Lome was contained in a book pub
lished after a tour around the world
in 1878, and was entitled "Madrid a
Madrid." Referring to the landing at
San Francisco he said:
"We had been told on board steamer
all that is usually said concerning
United States officials. They are
scoundrels and thieves. To strictly
comply with custom house regulations
will be of no avail to you."
American women are thus alluded to:
"We all know what the woman in the
United States is. She is adventurous
and bold. She travels alone with full
liberty, protected more by fear of law
than by respect which she inspires.
She is a spendthrift, elegant, and wears
the most risky fashions, knowing well
that everything becomes her.
"Before marriage, as I said before,
they are more feared than respected.
When they are married, how do they
behave? Who can tell? People have
been inclined to believe they made
model wives. I do not think that thoy
are the worst, people in the world, but
there are indications that do not com
mend them much."
Again of the. future of this republic
he said: "Will the United States be
able long to retain the cohesion from
which the Federal constitution derives
all its force, having, as the natlpnhas.a
government lacking unity and strength
as well as a corrupt administration."
The prediction is made in the book
that the United States must eventually
be dismembered, and that there will
be three republicsâ the East, West and
South.
ALL CHRISTENDOM IS
SHOCKED BY BARBARITIES.
Senator Mason's Thrilling Plea for
the Release of Cuba From
Spain's Clutches.
WASHINGTON, Feb. B.â Three prop
ositions, differing materially as to
methods, were presented to the Senate
to-day for, the relief of Cuban insur
gents. Allen of Nebraska offered as an
amendment to Jhe diplomatic and con
sular appropriation bill a resolution re
cognizing the belligerency of the in
surgents and said that he hoped thus to
afford the Senate an opportunity to
vote on that proposition. Cannon of
Utah offered a resolution urging the
President to notify the kingdom of
Spain that if it did not recognize the
independence of the Cuban republic
before March 4, 1898, the United States
would recognize the belligerency of the
Cubans and v.'ithin ninety days there
after would assert the independence of
of the Cuban republic. Mason of Illi
nois followed with a resolution request
ing the President to notify Spain that
the Cuban war must cease at once and
declare the intention of the United
States to restore and maintain peace
on the island of Cuba.
Both Cannon and Mason grave notice
of their intention to speak upon their
resolutions to-morrow.
Mason's resolution was preceded by
the following- preamble:
Whereas. The war between Spain and
the insurgents of Cuba has continued until
all Christendom is shocked by its bar
barities, pretended autonomy has been
offered by Spain and refused by the Cu
bans in arms; and
Whereas, the Spaniards, as a war meas
ure, burned the homes and drove the
women and children (since known as con
centrados) into fortified towns, where
some of^them have been starved, others
have been murdered and women and chil
dren have been debauched and treated
beyond the power of language to describe;
and,
Whereas, Daughters of insurgent sol
diers have been sold into houses of in
famy and boys of tender years have been
shot as spies, under the form of civilized
war; and,
Whereas, American citizens have been
driven into the towns and refused an op
portunity to work, and left to starve as a
part of the Spanish war measure, until
we were compelled to take, by appro
priating funds of the people of theÂ»United
States, large syms of money to feed and
clothe our citizens and to return them to
our country; and,
Whereas, Now has the Spanish war
measure of concentration continued so far
that the concentrados are unfed and
starving, naked and filthy, insomuch that
disease and death are among them, and
has spread into our own country; and.
Whereas, Hundreds of thousands have
perished in this way and by this means,
while the unholy work of extermination
goes on, the slaughter of innocents and
noncombatants goes on, the flag of truce
has been abandoned and extermination or
Independence of the Insurgents must be
the final outcome; and.
Whereas, The people of the United
States are sending money and food and
clothing to Cuba to aid the dying, which
ought to be furnished by Spain, for the
reason that the concentradoes a"re the
legitimate wards of Spain, having been
put in their present condition as a Span
ish war measure, and their care would
devolve upon Spain and would be so re
garded by every civilized nation in the
world, and
Whereas. Under the present charity
seeking of the administration, charitably
disposed citizens of the United States
cannot contribute money, medicine, food
or clothing to the insurgents In the field
or hospitals, and should any attempt be
made to do so it would be captured and
prevented by order of the Government of
the United States; and
Whereas, All parties declared before the
last election in favor of the independence
of Cuba, and the Republican party em
phasized Its opinion as follows: "From
the hour of achieving their own inde

gles of other American peoples to free
themselves from European domination.
We watch with deep and abiding inter
est the heroic battles of the Cuban pa
triots against cruelty and oppression, and
our best hopes go out for the full suc
cess of the>r determined contest for lib
erty. The Government of Spain having
lost control of Cuba and being unable to
protect the property or lives of resident
American citizens or to comply with its
treaty obligations, we believe that the
Government of the United States should
use its influence and good offices to re
store peace and give Independence to the
island." (Cuban plank in the Republican
platform adopted by the Republican Na
tional Convention at St. Louis, June 16,

Whereas, The people of the United

Cuba, nor do they seek to gain advantage
in any way, directly or indirWtJv of any
nation by reason of this barbarism called
war; they do not complain of the loss
of trade with Cuba and have patiently
borne the assault on the health of the
people by the filth of Spanish rule in
Cuba; they seek no redress for loss of
business, or health, or money; they have
patiently waited, not wishing, even in
directly, to interfere with the affairs of
other nations until the stench on our
very borders has passed endurance and
the barbarous situation in Cuba has be
come a stain upon our continent and a
blot upon our Christian civilization,
therefore, the people of the United States,
demanding no personal profit, having no
fear and seeking no favor, clear and
conscious as to the justice of their posi
tion, do, In the presence of the civilized
nations of the world, and In the name of
justice and liberty, demand that the so
called war in Cuba must cease.
SPAIN'S LATEST
REPLY NOT GIVEN OUT.
Its Substance Is Not Yet Known
Even by the State
Department.
WASHINGTON, Feb. B.â lt Is said at
the State Department that all attempts
to state the nature of Spain's reply to
Minister Woodford's note of last De
cember, at least so far as correspondents
on this side of the Atlantic are concerned,
are purely speculative and must be so of
necessity for the reason that up to this
time the department Itself docs not know
even the substance of the reply.
This disposps of the stories that have
appeared to the effect that the adminis
tration has been disturbed by cablegrams
from Woodford relative to the Spanish
answer. Senor Dupuy de Lome, the Span
ish Minister, called at the State Depart
ment to-day and spent some time in con
sultation with Mr. Kasson, the special
plenipotentiary, talking over the proposed
reciprocity treaties to be arranged be
tween the United States and Spain. The
Spanish Minister has been informed that
Dr. Anguelo will come to Washington to
represent the autonomous government of
Cuba In fixing the details of the treaties.
The doctor is now in New York awaiting
the return to Havana of Captain-General
Blanco, who must sign his commission.
BENICIA MOURNS THE
DEATH OF A PASTOR.
BENICIA, Feb. S.â Rev. Samuel Wey
lor, the Congregational pastor who had
been ill for some time and who had gone
to Paso Robles for a few days, died there
to-day. He was but 34 years old, but
progressive character and mentality pro
cured him a place among the most ad
vanced preachers of the day.
Rev. Mr. Weylor was born in Russia,
near Riga, of Jewish parents, and came
to America when he was 17 years old. He
entered Knox College at the age of 22,
and after graduating entered the Yale
Theological College, from which he grad
uated and entered Into the ministry In
Denver. His health failed and he tried
a change of climate, going first to Buf
falo, Wyoming. Then he came to this
coast and filled the pulpit here in Beni

PATRIARCH OF
MASONRY DIES
Aged George Lord Yields}
to a Stroke of Pa
ralysis.
The Oldest Member of His
Order in the United
States.
Was Born With the Century and
Won Riches in California
Mines.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, Feb. B.â George
Lord, a pioneer, almost a centenarian
and the oldest Mason and Odd Fellow
in the United States, probably in tha
world, died this morning* at 3 o'clock
at his home in this city from a paraly
tic stroke received yesterday. Several
months ago his splendid physical'
strength began to fail, and for several
weeks his death has been dally ex- â 
pected. The paralytic stroke was tha
finishing blow, and his passing was
quiet and peaceful.
George Lord was born in New York
City on June 17. 1800. and was initiated
an entered apprentice, raised to the
degree of fellowcraft and to the degree
of Master Mason in .two weeks, in Jan
uary, 1828. During the same year he
went South, and at Louisville, Ky.,
became a member of Daniel Boone
Lodge No. 1, Independent Order of Odd
Fellows. He went to Ohio in 1536, and
joined the Mansfield Lodge of Masons,
in which he held the offices of senior
warden and chaplain.
During the year 1849, while Mr. Lord
was living at Civic Bend, lowa, his
property was destroyed by fire, and he
made the trip across the continent with
ox teams by way of Fort Hall and the
Humboldt River, and engaged in placer
mining along the Yuba River for two
years. He was the first settler in Dow
nleville, and erected the first log cabin
in that camp. It was still standing
two years ago. His mining was suc
cessful, and he returned to the States
by the way of the Isthmus of Panama
in the spring of 1851, having amassed a
considerable fortune.
He remained East only one year and
during that time married Miss Arabella
Singleton, who, with one son, rorviyi b
him. Then he returned to California
over the same emigrant road hf> had
helped to build two years previous. He
crossed the mountins and plains with
a party of emigrants from Salt Lake
City, who were the first Americans to
settle in San Bernardino County. Be
settled on a ra*hch near the present
city and has ever since lived in this
county. He was the first successful
grower of raisin grapes in Southern
California and took the first prize, a
$5 gold piece, offered at Los Angeles.
At the time of his death he was a
member of Phot-nix Lodge No. I7v F
and A. M., and Keystone Cbaptei
56, R. A. M. He was one of the organ
izers of the Society of California Pi â 
neers and was the first president of the
San Bernardino society until the
of past president was crested for him.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Or., Feb. B.â Four com
panies of the Fourteenth Infantry have
been ordered to start for Alaska at the
earliest possible date, and two more
will hold themselves In readiness to
follow at a moment's notice. The or
der was received at Vancouver Bar
racks to-day by Colonel Thomas M.
Anderson, commanding the Four
teenth, who instantly started the prep
, aration for the movement of the
troops.
The constantly Increasing danger of
disorder at Skaguay and Dyea has
lead the War Department to insure
peace by the presence of a force suffi
ciently large to hold any disturbance
In check. "Whether the Fourteenth
will be permanently located in Alaska
has not yet been determined, but it
seems not unlikely, as only two com
panies are left at the post.
As soon as the order reached Van
couver Barracks, General Merriam,
commanding the Department of the
Columbia, and Major Jacobs, hisV chief
quartermaster, came to Portland to
procure. If possible, passage for the
troops on the steamship Oregon. The
result of their interview with Agent
Poston was not entirely satisfactory.
The latter was not disposed to disap
point those to whom the accommoda
tions on the Oregon have been sold,
and would make no definite reply with
out consulting the officials of the Pa
cific Coast Steamship Company. He
proposed, however, to bring the Aus
tralia, a 2200-ton steamship now fit
ting for the Alaska trade in San
Francisco, to Portland to carry the
trr^ps, a plan which was favorably re
ceived, and which from present indi
cations will probably be accepted.
Everything on the Oregon except ten
berths had been sold, so she could be
of no service to the Government for
- â¢ movement of troops. It is well
f:.-.iderstoc-d that in case of urgent ne
cessity the steamship could be seized,
but such a course is hardly likely to
be taken unless late reports should
bring news of serious trouble in Skag
uay or Dyea.
Colonel Anderson has not yet been
fully apprised of his duties and au
thority, but it is generally supposed
that he will be placed in command of
the Department of Alaska, which will
be at least temporarily created, and be
given full charge. His headquarters
will be at Dyea, and two companies
will be stationed at Dyea. The two
companies which are to follow will be
quartered with the commander at
Skaguay. Colonel Anderson will take
with him Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson
and all but one or two of the officers
connected with the post headquarters,
together with the officers of the vari
ous companies. Major Rohe will take
command of the post on the departure
of his superior. The companies which
are to go had not been fully decided
upon this afternoon, but will* probably
be designated to-morrow.
WASHINGTON, Feb. B.â ln accord
ance with the Cabinet decision to take
steps to protect life and property at
the Alaskan seaports, Â»he War Depart
ment this afternoon iramed and for
warded the following instructions to
General Merriam at Vancouver Bar
racks, Washington:
Make all necessary arrangements to
send the regimental headquarters band
and two companies of the Fourteenth In
fantry to Dyea and two companies of the
same regiment to Skaguay, Alaska, pre
pared to stay at least through the com
ing summer season, some suitable and
temporary quarters to be arranged for
the troops. Further instructions will be
sent later and the troops will go as early
as proper arrangements can be made
_ Report the time troops will be ready to

PERILOUS TRIP
OVER THE ICE IN
SEARCH OF NEWS
Sam Wall Leaves Dawson to Visit
Famine-Scourged Fort
Yukon.
DAWSON CITT, N. W. T., Dec. 13, 1897, via steamer Noyo to
Seattle, Feb. B.â The most hazardous trip ever undertaken by a news
paper man in search of news for the readers of his paper is now being
made by Mr. Sam Wall, the well-known correspondent of The Call.
On the morning of the 10th inst., when the startling intelligence
reached here of starvation and riot at Fort Yukon, Mr. Wall hastily
made arrangements for the long and perilous journey over the ice, 400
miles down the Yukon River. Many hardy men, used to the hard
ships of this frozen region, have perished while attempting this trip;
but, nothing daunted, Mr. Wall, with only two hours' preparation, is
now breaking trail and making his way over the rough, jagged ice
toward the camp of the starving men on the Arctio circle.
For one who has never been through an Arctic winter, it is hard
to fully appreciate the desperate task which Mr. Wall has undertaken.
At this season of the year, the mercury ranges from 40 to 80 degrees
below zero, and one is virtually taking his life in his hands to at
tempt the trip. With the best of luck, twenty-five days is considered
as very rapid time; thus it will be readily seen that Mr. Wall has
undertaken a journey which may cost him his life over an unbroken
trail which, if he is fortunate, it will take him nearly sixty days to ac
complish.
He, however, fully expects to be here again by the middle of Feb
ruary, if not earlier, with a true account of the hardships which are
being endured by the miners and others at Fort Yukon, and as the
news which he will give to the world on his return will be the most
important which has ever gone out from the Yukon River, the readers
of The Call may congratulate themselves on having such an energetic
and self-sacrificing man as Mr. Wall in this region.
Freighters bring word here that Mr. Wall pulled out of Forty-Mile
on the morning of the 12th. He has a team of nine dogs, is traveling
very light, without tent or stove, and Is making very fast time. The
only weight he has is some sixty pounds of United States mail, which,
at the last moment, he consented to take, the mail carrier being con
fined in the hospital here.
Captain W. E. Geiger, one of the most experienced men on the river,
Is in charge of Wall's team, and two famous Indians, Cherooska and
Sousa, complete the party. D. CAMP.

Sacramento's Chief of
Police Orders an
Exodus.
Mayor Land Determined to
Drive Out Games of
Chance.
Says This Is tout One of the Reforms
to Be Instituted at the
Capital.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. B.â Chief of
Police M. M. Drew stepped down and
out to-day and his successor, Thomas
Dwyfr, was installed as chief. One
of Chief Dtvyer's first official acts was
to serve notices on the proprietors of
all gambling houses that the games
must be closed, and if they refuse to
obey their arrest will follow.
Mayor Land has directed the new
Chief of Police to close every gambling
game- that can be found In operation.
In speaking of the new order of things,
Mayor Land said to-night:
"It is my desire to call a halt upon
the innumerable catch-penny devices
that are at present operated in Sacra
mento openly and in defiance of law.
Games are now being patronized In this
city by young men who had never gam
bled in their lives before their atten
tion was attracted by these new-fan
gled devices.
"There are many reforms that I shall
institute just as soon as I find that the
other departments in our city govern
ment are ready and willing to co-oper
ate with me along the lines of general
improvement. I shall exact from the
police department many decided
changes in the manner of its service
to the people. While all these matters
will take time, I believe I will live to
see the day when I shall have accom
plished all I started out to accomplish.
My one ambition is to increase the
city's revenues and lower the tax rate."
The stand taken by Mayor Land in
connection with the games he speaks
of has met great favor.

PETTY JOBBERY
San Jose's Board of Edu
cation Under
Fire.
Seeming Attempt to Give a
Contract to a Favored
Firm.
Becomes Alarmed at the Last Minute
and a Treasury Raid Falls
Through.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PAN JOSE, Feb. B.â What Is said to
have been a job on the part of the City
Board of Education to award a con
tract to the L. Lion & Sons Company
for 100 school desks in order to pay an
illegal contract entered into some time
ago, at an exorbitant figure, failed to
go through to-night at the meeting of
the board. A multiplicity of bidders
and the fear that a bid lower than that
of the favored firm would be opened,
caused the matter to be indefinitely
postponed. So evident were the ear
marks of a job, that express ; ons of dis
gust over the board's action was heard
from the bidders and spectators pres
ent.
The full board was present â Trustees
Kenyon, Weniple, O'Brien and Graham.
About July 1 Trustee O'Brien ordered
100 desks from the L. Lion & Sons Co.
for the Longfellow School. It was in
tended to pay for these out of the
boards' funds, but Mayor Koch became
aware of the matter and warned the
board that it could not contract bills
for $100 without calling for bids. This
was the stumbling block that displayed
the board's hand. In order to go to
the Lions for these desks it was de
cided to call for bids, and a "joker"
was adopted. Bids for 150 or more
desks were called for, but no mention
of samples or styles made.
To-night was the date for opening
the bids. A half carload of samples
was in the room and about a dozen
bidders present. Instead of proceeding
with business the board retired to an
other room to discuss the matter.
Then Trustee Graham announced
that but $20,000 was in the State fund.
It required $6500 a month to pay the
teachers' salaries, or $32,500 for the
next five months. This would leave a
deficit of $12,500 in the fund, and there
would be no money to buy desks. He
moved that the bids be returned un
opened. This was seconded by Ken
yon and carried.
S. N. Rucker, one of the bidders, pro
tested against this action. He said the
bidders had been put to considerable
expense to come and bring sample
desks. He said the board should have
found out whether there was money
on hand or not to buy desks with be
fore calling for bids. Other bidders
also expressed the same viewÃ.
Rucker denounced the whole pro
ceedings as a Job. He asked the board
if rent was not being paid for the desks
Lion & Co. furnished, but the Trustees
said they did not know. He said he
was not surprised at the board's action,
as the same methods had characterized
all its actions.
The job seemingly attempted to-night
was but a preliminary step to one for
furnishing desks for the new High
School.
Although the desks have been in the
Longfellow School since July, Lion &
Sons have not asked for payment of
their bill. The firm has openly boasted
that it would never remove the desks,
as it had "pull" enough to secure pay
ment for them. It is said the price
the board first agreed to pay the Lions
was $3 75 a desk. .The same desks have
been put into schools for less than $2 75
each. It is reported that the Lions be
came afraid that their bid would not
be the lowest, and Gus Lion, one of the
firm, went to San Francisco this week
and made a proposition to the school
desk combine that if they were allow
ed to put in these desks at a low figure
they would obtain the contract for
desks for the new High School for the
combine.
American Marines Landed.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 8.-Captain Leutze,
in command of the Alert, has cabled the
Navy Department that he has landed
marines at San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua
for the protection of the American con
sulate, owing to the fact that a revolu
tion has broken out.
A MODERN
VERSION OF
ENOCH ARDEN
Suit Involving Two
Persons Guilty of
Bigamy.
Husband and Wife Who
Had Each Married
Again.
Woman's Action for Divorce
Transferred to Butte
County.
SHE IS NOW A PAUPER.
Wants a Portion of the Wealth of
the Man She Believed Was
Dead.
SpfJlal Dispatch to The Call.
NAPA, Feb. B.â Upon motion of At
torney John T. York, Judge Ham of
this county yesterday granted a change
of venue from Napa County to Butte
County in the case of Elizabeth Clark
vs. Palmer Clark.
The simple beginning of the peculiar
circumstances involved in this suit
took place in Sacramento, where, in
the year 1801, Palmer Clark married a
Â«=eemingly most companionable woman.
He shortly took his departure by
steamship around Cape Horn, expect
ing to soon return to California and re
join his wife. Clark, after arriving at
New York, joined a party of immigrants
who were bound for California. With
them and the band of horses which he
had procured he started for Sacra
mento. While on his way Clark left
the party of immigrants temporarily.
In vain did his comrades wait for his
return, and, concluding that he had
been killed by the Indians, they pro
ceeded to California. When the ar
gonauts arrived here they informed
Mrs. Clark that her husband was dead,
and from that time until about a year
ago Mrs. Clark supposed that she was
a widow.
Paimer Clark did not perish nor was
he killed by Indians. He deserted his
comrades and went back East and
married another woman, by whom two
daughters were born to him. In IS7B
Palmer Clark, with his new wife,
moved from the Eastern States to
Butte County, Cal., where he has re
sided ever since.
Shortly after Mrs. Clark was in
formed that her husband was dead
she married a man in Sacramento by
the name of T. A. Giauque. A few
years later Mr. and Mrs. Giauque
moved to Napa County, near St.
Helena, where Oiauque, who at time
was the possessor of great wealth,
purchased a handsome home. Giauque
was one of the moneyed Swiss of Napa
Valley. HfÂ» bought ih >usands of tons
of grapes and paid cash for them,
something that none of his neighbors
could do. but notwithstanding his
wealth, the newly married couple did
not live happily together. Mrs. Giau
que had a violent temper, and she was
not reluctant to vent her Ire upon her
husband when the opportunity pre
sented itself. As the Btory goes; Giau
que, who did not quite respect the laws
of the land, sent grape spirits under
the guise of wine to purchasers, and
she, learning of the deal, quietly in
formed the revenue officers of the
United States. Giauque compromised
the matter for the neat sum of $25,000.
Giauque once laid in his house a sack
containing $1000 in gold. Mrs. Giauque
appropriated the money to her own
use and hurried to Sacramento,
where she was afterward appre
hended by her husband. Most of the
money was recovered and peace was
made, and together the couple con
tinued to reside in Napa County.
About twelve years ago the Napa
Valley home which all these years the
Giauques has occupied was lost
through a mortgage foreclosure, and
Giauque and his wife then moved to
Conn Valley, Napa County, and thence
to Napa City. Here Mrs. Giauque still
resides, and here Giauque about a
year ago died. Of the two daughters of
Palmer Clark and his first wife, one re
sides in Napa and is a single woman.
The other daughter about twenty
years ago married a brother of T. A.
Giauque, with whom she is now re
siding in Chiles Valley, in this county.
Amon Giauque and Tuttie Giauque,
the two children of Mr. and Mrs. Giau
que, are residents of Napa Valley,
Amon Giauque having been for years
married and residing in Napa City,
while Tuttie lives in Rutherford with
her husband, named Meyers.
About a year ago Mrs. Giauque
learned that her first husband was re
siding in Butte County. She went to
see him and remained over night, and
told the second Mrs. Clark that her
name was Mrs. Holt. Clark when
asked by his first wife what he pro
posed to do about his position in life
stated that he thought things were all
right and that he proposed to let
them remain as they were. Mrs. Giau
que did not look at the matter in the
same way, for she returned to Napa
and at onre Instituted proceedings on
the grounds of desertion, asking not
only for a divorce, but alimony and a
division of the property of Clark, of
which there is a large amount. ' As
soon as Clark learned that the officers
were locking for him for the purpose
of serving him with divorce papers he
notified them that they could find him
at the home of his brother-in-law in
Butte County, where he was found in
accordance with his suggestion. His
present wife is ignorant of the pro
ceedings taken to deprive her of her
husband.
Palmer Clark is a man of means to
day, but the legal proceedings will
probably change his position. T. A.
Giauque, the man once rich, was pov
erty-stricken long before he died, and
Mrs. Giauque â perhaps legally Mrs.
Clarkâ has for a long time been sup
ported by Napa County.

to-day Herr Rlchter, the Radical lead
er, referring to the Chinese question,
said he regarded the acquisition of
Kiaochau much more useful than
hoisting flags in Africa. Germany
ought to preach none but a free-trade
gospel in China, thus forming a com
mercial community of interests with
Great Britain. He said he feared, how
ever, that all the public's hopes with
regard to China would not be realized.
Japan was a much better market for
European products, and European peo
ple need not be anxious about their
most sacred possessions in consequence
of Japan's development. In conclusion,
Herr Richter invited the government
to give full details of the position re
garding Germany's treaty with Russia,
negotiations for the loan, and for the
collateral matters.
Baron yon Bulow, replying, said the
government was not desirous of veil
ing its foreign policy, but it was im
possible prematurely to divulge the
confidential negotiations, although the
government was fully aware of its
responsibility to the country. The dis
patch of a squadron to Kiaochau was
not, he declared, an improvision, but
was an expression of well-considered,
calm and clearly denned policy.
Baron yon Bulow proceeded to jus
tify the acquisition of a point of sup
port in Eastern Asia as an absolute
necessity, looking to Germany's rap
idly growing interests in one of the
richest markets of the world for im
ports, if she did not desire to become
a second or third rate power in Asia,
for every power, even Portugal and
the Netherlands, had territorial posses
sion there.
Found Dead on His Wagon.
SAN MIGUEL. Feb. B.â Edward Bollen,
a farmer, 67 years of age, living near
Anette, in Kern County, was found in
an unconscious condition lying on the
seat of his wagon at the foot of a steep
declivity on Saturday. Before medical aid
i could be summoned he expired. The cir
| cumstances indicated that his horses had
' run away and that the exertions of the
i old man in trying to stop them caused his
j death. There were no marks on his body
indicating facts to the contrary. Bollen's
I family reside at Monterey. The remains

MRS. HADLEY
VERY SICK
Unable to Appear Before
the Disclosure Com
missioner.
Melcher's Efforts to Collect the
Amount of thÂ»Judg
ment.
All Proceedings Will Now Have to
Await the Fair Defendant's
Recovery.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Feb. B.â A Lewiston (Me.)
special says: Mrs. Louise M. Hadley,
daughter of Hon. J. Dingley Jr. of
Auburn and wife of the wealthy San
Diego hotel proprietor, did not appear
before Disclosure Commissioner Mit
chell here to-day in answer to the cita
tion issued 1 for the purpose of enforc
ing payment of the judgment of the
court in favor of Arthur S. Melcher in
the famous breach of promise case.
Mrs. Hadley sent word that she was
very ill, in fact too sick to appear at
the hearing. Her attorney was present
at the appointed hour and delivered
her message to the Disclosure Com
missioner.
Mrs. Hadley is ill and it is indicated
that she may remin in Auburn the
balance of the winter. She has been in
poor health for several weeks and came
East by advice of her physician, who
thinks the climate in California un
favorable to restoration of health.
Since her arrival in Auburn papers
have been served on Mrs. Hadley at
the instance of counsel for plaintiff in
the suit of Melcher vs. Hadley, citing
her to appear before a Disclosure Com
missioner for the purpose of disclosing
her assets.
At the trial in September the jury
rendered a verdict against Mrs. Had
ley for $1789. The judgment was made
up October 11, 1897, as follows: De
fendant, $1790 50; costs, $57 80; total,
$1848 30. An execution was issued Oc
tober 15, 1897. On February 11 a sec
ond execution was issued. This paper
was returned to the clerk of the court
with the indorsement that the judg
ment had not been satisfied. After
hearing the statement of Mrs Hart
ley's counsel Commissioner Mitchell le
cided to adjourn the hearing until her
health would enable her to be present.
The authorities have decided to with-
hold any harsh measures, in view of
the admitted fact that her sickness is
genuine and serious and not. assumed
or exaggerated, as was at first urged
by some friends, of Mr. Melcher. Thus
the case will remain in statu quo for
the present
MONTEREY PIONEER DEAD.
MONTEREY. Feb. B.â Another member
of the little Monterey band of California
pioneers has passed away and his com
rades deeply feel his loss. Reuben H.
Morey died at his home in this city at
about midnight last night, after a long
period of suffering from inflammatory
rheumatism. Although his death has
been daily expected for the past few
weeks, of late he had seemed to rally,
and the seizure which finally ended his
career came unexpectedly to his family.
Reuben Morey was born In North Au
gusta, Ontario, In ls:tl, and came to Cali
fornia in 1851. He spent several years in
the mines of CaJaveras and Amador
counties and did not visit Monterey until
1853. Since settling here he had been en
gaged in the freighting business. S. E.
Pardee and George Bellamy, both of
whom are residents of Monterey, were
teamsters and companions of Morey
when he came to California.

up Thursday morning. Wilbur obtained

Affairs.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANQUENTIN PRISON, Feb. B.â Tho
committee appointed by the last State
Legislature to visit and inspect publio
institutions and report to the Legisla
ture at the next session was at the
penitentiary to-day and commenced the
work of inspection, which will be con
tinued to-morrow and, probably, Thurs
day. The Senators present were John
H. Dickinson of Marin County, C. W.
Simpson of Pasadena, J. J. Boyce of
Santa Barbara, W. F. Prisk of Nevada
and E. W. Chapman. They were ac
companied by J. F. Brandon, secretary
and Eugene Van Court, official stenog- '
rapher.
After being shown through the prison,
and having the various sy&tems ex- j
plained, they got down to work and put !
question after question to Warden W.
E. Hale concerning the workings of
the penitentiary, the Jute mill and the
grain sack deals. The inspection of the
prison occupied some time, and the
committee was taken into every de
partment. The woman's ward was vis
ited, and through the hospital, the Jute
mill, the old furniture factory, the
kitchen, the dining-room and the other
interesting places in connection with
the penitentiary the committee was es
corted by the prison authorities, who
were kept busy answering questions.
The Senators looked at the affidavits
for grain bags which were received last
year and asked numerous questions in
regard to this important branch of the
prison work.
They also questioned the Warden In
regard to the supply of food in non
contracts. In fact, they went into this
subject deeply. They then branched
off in a series of questions in regard to
the number of employes; whether
those who were receiving salaries
were, in fact, earning them; whether
the force could be reduced without
harm; whether there were any offices
that could be consolidated; whether
there w.ere any men receiving pay who
did nothing in exchange for it. Ques
tions such as these were asked in
rapid succession, and "Warden Hale
and Prison Director James H. Wilkins
answered them in detail.
One of the subjects that interested
the Senators in no small measure con
cerned the food supplied to the con
victs. They asked the Warden if he
did not believe the prisoners were fed
too well, and this called forth an elab
orate explanation of the quality and
kind of food given to the prisoners. It
struck the committee as a good idea
that the convicts might be put at work
in the manufacture of goods and mer
chandise to be used in th/e various
State institutions, such as the insane
asylums and reformatories. Thej r also
favored the establishment of a print
ing plant in the penitentiary.

BIRD'S TESTIMONY.
District Attorney Devlin says
he has a card up his sleeve In
the Belew case. It is the testi
mony which will be given by
John W. Bird to the effect that
Frank Belew often made threats
that lie would kill his relatives.
Speaking of what he would
swear to, Bird said: "I had
many talks with Frank Bele\v
concerning his family affairs. He
and I have been good friends for
years. He first began to threaten
murder shortly after the deatih
of his parents. In many conver
sations he repeatedly told me
he would get revenge, so I have
a chain of dates on which he
made statements to the effect
that he would destroy the lives
of those whom he killed. I am,
therefore, fully satisfied that
Belew contemplated and planned
this murder almost as soon as
he discovered that those whom
he killed had the best of his
father's will."
This evidence will be Import
ant as confirming the ex parte
confessions of Belew, as the Dis
trict Attorney fears a mere con
fession not under oath, unless
corroborated by other facts, will
not be sufficient to warrant a
conviction.
SUISUN, Feb. B.â Frank Belew, who
confessed that he poisoned his sister
and brother, will make a fight to save
himself from the gallows. It was his
original intention to plead guilty to
murder and save the county the ex
pense and trouble of trying him. His
attorneys have since advised him that
he has a technical defense, and with
the assurance of his brother, Arthur
Belew, that financial aid will be ex
tended to him he has decided to make
a fight in court.
It is now very clear that, In addition
to fighting on technicalities, the plea
will be also made that the prisoner is
Insane. Several friends of the family
visited Belew this afternoon, and on
leaving the Jail said that they were
satisfied that one of his mental cogs
has gone wrong, and that he was not
of sound mind. One of them went so
far as to predict that Belew would
within six weeks be in an Insane asy
lum.
When Belew appeared in court this
morning Attorney Lamont appeared
for him to ask for a continuance.
"I understand," said Attorney La
mont, "that Reese Clark has been re
tained to defend the prisoner. He is
unable to be present to-day and has
not had an opportunity to consult his
client. Under these circumstances I
ask that the preliminary hearing be
continued until next Friday."
District Attorney Devlin opposed any
continuance on the ground that the de
fendant had been informed of his
rights and had been given ample time
to consult his attorney.
Justice Maynard said that he did not
Bee where the prosecution would suffer
by a continuance, and accordingly
granted the motion. Belew was then
ordered back into the custody of .he
Sheriff.
Belew would undoubtedly have
â waived examination and gone to trial
had it not been for the stand taken by
his brother. Arthur Belew says that
he wIM engage counsel to defend his
brother.
"Frank must have been insane when
he committted the crime," said he to
r.ig-ht, "and I da not think that he
should suffer the extreme penalty of
the law. He was undoubtedly insane
at the time, and I will do everything a
brother can do to save him from the
gallows."

STORY OF THE VICTIM.
Laughed At by the Dixon Officers
When He Told of the Attempts
on His Life.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Feb. B.â Charles Hough,
who has been mentioned as a farm
hand whom Frank Belew tried to as
sassinate and later poison, is a resi
dent of this city, conducting a second
hand store on Weber avenue, near San
Joaquin street. Hough says that when
he went to Dixon after his experiences
and related his story he was accused
of being crazy, and he hopes that the
officers who refused to take action then
will credit him now with sanity.
Hough certainly appears like a sober
and intelligent man, and tells his story
in a manner calculated to convince.
"I went to Dixon in the spring four
years ago," says he, "and found em
ployment with Frank Belew, helping
him around his place for two months.
I never worked for a man more agree
able to my face. When we got through
he owed me $47, but as I had some
money I told him not to Inconvenience
himself, as I was not broke. I went
dc-wn to Dixon and met him there on
the street one day, and he dunned him
self. Later, while working over at an
other place, I fell and hurt my Bide
and went back to Dixon to rest. I
met Belew on the street again, md he
said he was all alone at the ranch and
suggested that I come out and eat
supper with him.
"I went, and after the meal I had to
go and He down for some time. It
seemed that every bone and muscle
in me was paralyzed. I got better,
hc-wever, and returned to town that
evening. The idea that Belew tried to
poison me never crossed my mind, as
I supposed I was merely sick from
some cause.
"Along in the latter part of Septem
ber I got hard up and I went out to
Belew and asked him if he would not
help me out by letting me board out
that debt. I thought it was all right,
as Mrs. Belew had told me several
times to come out and feel at home.
This was one Saturday evening, and
the following Tuesday, Mrs. Belew be
ing away at the time, Frank asked me
if I wanted to drive across to his other
place with him. He harnessed up and
I went with him. He took his shotgun
with him, but I thought nothing of
that, as he frequently carried the gun
around with him. We arrived at the
place and after looking around I
started to get back to the wagon, sup
posing that Belew was going home.
Since it has turned out as it has I can
see that his actions were wrong, but I
thought nothing of them at that time.
He hesitated and finally suggested that
we walk over to the road fence and see
how things looked in that part of the
country. We went, and he kept hesi
tating and gaining time by small talk.
We were near the haystack at the time
and he said he was going over on the
other side of the fence. I told him I
guessed I would lie down on the straw
and wait until he returned.
"I lay down, with my head resting on
my hand and my elbow on the straw,
and was dozing when I heard the re
port of a gun, which was followed by a
charge of shot tearing- off my hat brim.
My first thought was that it was an ac
cidental shot from tons range, but
when I got up and went around the
stack I saw Belew walking away from
me over on the other side of the fence.
I thought this was funny, so I Jumped
over and overtook him. He looked
rather white, and when I told him he
had almost struck me by a wild shot
he grew very nervous and seemed to be
making no preparations to go home. I
never suspected anything up to this
time, but now I felt a little uncertain.
I called his attention to the fact that
his team was loose, and so we went
down, and catching the horses we rodiÂ»
home. On the way home he told me
not to say anything about the close
call, as it might worry his wife.
"Arriving there Mrs. Belew was not
at horns, and as it was a warm evening
in the early part of October I sat down
on the outside while he cooked supper.
He called me in. and we had hardly sat
down when he Jumped up and said the
grun accident had made him so nervous
that he could not eat. I reached over,
and, breaking a biscuit, buttered it.
The first mouthful was so bitter that I
â¢pat it out on the plate. 1 noticed some
white powder. Then I was scared, and
jumping up I went over and got my
coat. Belew was out in the yard, and
so I went back to the table and got a
piece of the bread and put It In my
pocket. Without waiting further I out
across the fields and did not stop till
I got into Dixon.
"The next day a druggist examined
the biscuit and said it was full of poi
son. I complained to the Constable up
there and he told me I was a stranger
and Belew well thought of, and it
would do me no good to press the case.
I even told Frank's brother, whom he
poisoned, and he made no comment. I
talked some of the day's attacks on me
and to contradict me a report was
started that I was crazy and had tried
to commit suicide.
"When this poisoning: case came up
I told some of my friends here that in
viev,- of my experiences I thought
Frank was the pullty party. Now I
guess they know it."

REFORMERS
AFTER THE
PATRONAGE
Los Angeles School
Board Offices Are
Snapped Up.
Crusaders Get the Plums
With Dr. Mathus'
Assistance.
Fill Two Vacancies "With Men
Chosen From Their Own
Ranks.
ENDING OF A DEADLOCK.
Concession? Macio to the Director
Who Had the Deciding
Vote.
Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. B.â The devel
opments of the session of the school
board to-night tend to show that the
leaders of the purity crusade, backed
by the syndicated local press, are about
as good programmers and are also
about as greedy after the spoils of of
fice as any heelers that ever handled a
ward caucus or carried a precinct pri
mary. For five weeks the election of a
secretary and a superintendent of
school buildings has been held up. The
better government combination was
unable to command the five votes nec
essary on the board to secure the place.
It had only four. On the other hand,
there were four solid votes in the op
position, and Dr. Mathus, director from
the Sixth Ward, had the deciding vote.
The doctor for five weeks tied up the
election to fill these two offices. One
day he would promise one side, and the
next day he would revoke, his promise
of the day before. But the Conrey-
Davis-Braly combine on the board was
determined to have the two jobs, and
it finally effected it by a very cleverly
arranged trade.
In order to win, the combine had to
have Dr. Mathus' vote. In considera
tion of that vote, it permitted Dr. Ma
thus to name C. S. Hogan as superin
tendent of buildings and took X. S. Av
erill as clerk of the board. By a vote
of 5 to 4 this combination was put
through to-night. Mr. Averill is an eld
erly gentleman, and his election is a
reward to Director Conrey. Davis has
been rewarded by his election as presi
dent of the board.
Braly is rewarded by having no in
vestigation made as to his violating
the law in being a party to the dis
counting of warrants for School De
partment employes. Dr. Mathus has
been bulldozed by the syndicated press
until he, out of fear, joined the Davis-
Conrey-Braly combine, for which he
has also been specifically rewarded in
being permitted to name the Superin
tendent of Buildings.
The syndicated press has, however,
accused Dr. Mathus of being a party
to the displacement of school teachers
who refused to take policies in a life
insurance company of which he was the
medical examiner. This charge he has
never disproved, but it is understood
that in consideration of his allying
himself with the truly pure combine on
the board he will no longer be held up
by the syndicated newspapers. This
will be a great relief to the doctor, but
it is probable that his troubles in this
regard have only commenced.
When the board meets again next
Monday Judge A. M. Bragg will take
the seat now held by C. J. Kubach, and
that may result in some good work
being accomplished, as he will have the
deciding vote between the truly good
and the so-called truly Dad rings seek
ing to control the School Department
and its patronage. Judge Bragg is
certain to be elected, as there is no
opposition to his candidacy.
Director Webb created a sensation
to-night by offering the following reso
lution:
Whereas, It appears from letters from
Superintendent J. A. Foshay and Deputy
Superintendent L. C. Ennis that nineteen
teachers, previous to June, 1597. teaching
in the city schools had the same or better
rating than Mies Mac Owen, who was re
elected last Monday evening:, and that
these nineteen teachers were dropped at
the same time as Miss Owen, and seven
teen have not since been re-elected; there
fore, be It
Resolved, That all of these seventeen
having the same mark or better than
Miss Owen be re-elected to teach In the
city schools on tha substitute list, and
that they be given regular positions as
fast as vacancies occur, in preference to
any new applicants.
This resolution was a boomerang in
the camp of the truly good combine.
Director Conrey moved that the resolu
tion be referred to the teachers' com
mittee. This was done and the effect
of it will be to shut off all argument
and some startling disclosures as to the
favoritism shown in. the reinstatement
of Miss Owen.
GERMANY AND THE

Thus Far the Bundesrath Reso

BERLIN, Feb. B.â An official news

German blutlaus with the San Jose scale,
on authority of the president of the Po
molofirlcal College at Geisenheim.
Thus far the Bundesrath resolution re
garding American fruit has been fairly
applied. There has been only a single
case of complaint. Eighty-one boxes of
American fruit stopped at Hamburg are
alleged to be Infected by the San Jose
bug.
In the Reichstag to-day, before the
Budget Committee, Count Posadowski
Minister of the Interior, said the San Jose
louse, according to entomologists, was a
very dangerous Insect. The Federal
Government, he added, had been obliged
to act promptly but considerately and
expert investigations were proceeding
upon which the final decisions of the Gov
ernment would be based. Regarding the
United States treatment of German
sugar, he said negotiations were progress
ing, the result of which must be awaited
Baron yon Thielmann, Secretary of the
Imperial Treasury, admitted that the
complaints of unfair customs treatment
of German sugars were justified, and he
thought that the revival of the Amer
ican beet-sugar industry was especially
injurious to the German export trade.

doubtless be within his power to
do so. He is personally unfav
orably inclined toward the policy
of territorial expansion in the
Pacific, but it would require con
siderable political courage to en
force his views upon his party
which is apparently committed
overwhelmingly on the other
side. A canvass of the House
has been quietly made, with the
result that careful observers be
lieve Reed, as an avowed oppon
ent, would be 3trong enough to
defeat the measure in an open
vote of the House, but the ques
tion is whether the Speaker
would care to lead a Republican
minority in conjunction with the
Democrats against an adminis
tration policy. Without some
such leadership thelatentÃepub
lican opposition to annexation is
likely to vanish before the potent
scepter of party regularity. It
thus seems to depend upon Reed
how the House would vote on an
nexation. The Democrats are
presenting a nearly solid front
of opposition, and claim that only
five of their number will break
over party lines. It â¢would, of
course, be possible for the Speak
er, in combination with the two
Democrats on the Committee of
Rules, to kill the thing by more
arbitrary methods, but it is prob
able that he would prefer to ac
complish such a result by House
leadership rather than by parlia
mentary machinery, since he
would have that choice. It ought
to be apparent before long what
the Senate can do, and if the
sixty votes remain unattainable
the eyes and influences of the
country will turn to Speaker
Reed.
WASHINGTON, Feb. B.â Senator
Pettigrew of South Dakota was the
only speaker on the Hawaiian annex
ation treaty in the executive session of
the Senate to-day. He opposed the
treaty, resuming his speech where he
had left off a week ago, taking up the
line of his argument in connection with
his assertion concerning the area and
population of the islands. He asserted
that the area capable of sugar culti
vation amounted to fully a half-miHion
acres and said that, as the land was
very productive, there was no doubt
that all the sugar necessary to supply
the demands of the United States could
be produced in Hawaii. He quoted
official statistics to the effect that in
eleven months of last year there had
been 496,000,000 pounds of Hawaiian su
gar imported into tb,e United States.
The Senator then undertook to show
that all the sugar grown on the islands
must be produced by Asiatic labor, re
peating and elaborating the argument
that no colonies of the Anglo-Saxon
race had ever been successful within
the tropics. He replied to Senator Tel
ler on this point, saying that the facts
were against the Colorado Senator's
contention and that the Hawaiian Is
lands would prove no exception to the
rule that the white man could not and
would not labor in a tropical climate.
He said that of the 700,000 people in
Jamaica fewer than 15,000, including
the British garrison, were white, and in
the Straits settlement not 1 per cent of
the residents were English. He as
serted that in Hawaii there was no Eu
ropean laborer, aside from the Portu
guese, engaged in the sugar planta
tions to-day.
If, he argued, we should annex the
islands, the Japanese would inevitably
take possession of them, and we could
not in any degree check their inroads
under our new treaty with Japan,
which goes into effect next year. In
view of this fact, he contended that
whatever bounty we give or tariff wo
levy the result would be in the interest
of Asiatic labor in Hawaii. Senator
Pettigrew held that the result of the
encouragement of this species of labor
would be to the detriment of our own
commerce, which, he contended, is al
ready declining in the Hawaiian Is
lands.
"It is absurd." exclaimed the Sena
tor, "to talk of defending San Fran
cisco from Hawaii as it is to talk of
defending New York from Ireland, for
the distance is about the same."
Senator Pettigrew at 5 o'clock an
nounced that he had not concluded his
speech, but would continue to-morrow.
Died From a Fractured Skull.
Thomas Cain, an expressman, who fell

LONDON, Feb. B.â The fourth session
of the Fourteenth Parliament of Queen
Victoria, and the twenty-sixth of the
United Kingdom, was opened by com
mission at 2 o'clock this afternoon with
the customary ceremonies. The Queen's
speech was as follows:
My Lords and Gentlemen: My relations
with tho other powers continue friendly.
The negotiations between the Sultan of
Turkey and the King of Greece have
been brougnt to a conclusion by the sign
ing of a treaty of peace, under which the
territorial relations between the two
powers are practically unchanged.
The question of the autonomous gov
ernment of the island of Crete has occu
pied the attention of the powers. The
difficulty of arriving at a unanimous
agreement on some points has unduly
protracted the deliberations, but I hope
these obstacles will, before long, be sur
mounted.
Intelligence, which 1b apparently trust
worthy, was received of the intention of
the Khalifa to advance against the Egyp
tian army in the Soudan, and I have
therefore given directions that a contin
gent of British troops should be dis
patched to Berber to the assistance of his
Highness, the Khedive.
I have concluded a treaty of friendship
and commerce with his Majesty, the Em
peror of Abyssinia.
The report of the committee I appointed
in December, 1896, to inquire into the con
dition of certain of my West Indian colo
nies has conclusively established the ex
istence of severe depression in those colo
nies, caused by the heavy fall in the price
of sugar, which is mainly attributable to
the reduction in the cost of production
and the great increase in its extent of re
cent years. But the fall has been arti
ficially stimulated by the system of boun
ties to producers and manufacturers of
beet sugar maintained in many European
states.
On the northwestern borders of my In
dian empire an organized outbreak of
fanaticism, which spread in the summer
along the frontier, induced many of the
tribes to break their engagements with
my government, to attack the military
posts In their vicinity, and even to invade
the settled district bf my territory. I was
compelled to send expeditions against the
offending tribes for the punishment of the
outrages and to insure peace in the fu
ture. A portion of the Afridi tribes have
not yet accepted the terms offered them,
but elsewhere the operations have been
brought to a very successful close. The
courage and endurance exhibited by my
troops, British and native, have overcome
almost insuperable difficulties in the
country In which they were operating,
but I have to deplore the loss of many
valuable lives, both among my own
troopa and those whose services were vol
untarily and loyally placed at my dispos
al by tho native servants in my Indian
empire.
I rejoice at the fact that there Is reason
to anticipate a prosperous year, both for
agriculture and commerce, throughout
India.
On the reassembling of the House of
Lords the new Peers were introduced
and took their seats with the usual cer
emony. The House was full and the
galleries were crowded with peeresses
and the daughters of Peers. The gal
leries were filled before business in the
House of Lords began. The Duke of
Marlborough and Lord Dunraven were
among the Peers present on the floor.
The Prince of Wales and the Duke of
York were present.
After the address in reply to the
speech from the throne had been mov
ed and seconded the Earl of Klmberly,
the opposition leader in the House of
Lords, replied that he regarded the lo
cal Government of Ireland as being one
of the most important subjects of the
Queen's speech, and while he regarded
the Government measure favorably he
was compelled to add that the Liberal
party was of the opinion that the only
way to permanently satisfy Ireland
was by establishing home rule.
The Marquis of Salisbury then arose,
and fortifying himself with a glass of
water and leaning his hands UDon the
table which separated him from the
opposition began in plain conversation
al tones, as If addressing Lord Kim
berly alone. The first announcement
which provoked "Hear, hear!" was that
before many months he hoped that
their efforts in Egypt would result in
the capture of Khartoum. When the
Premier reached the question of China
there was a murmur of expectancy.
The pacific assurances he gave were
received with evident approval and re
lief.
On the resumption of business in the
House of Commons this afternoon the
new members took their seats. Gerald
Balfour, the Chief Secretary for Ire
land, gave notice that on Thursday he
would introduce the local Government
bill for Ireland.
After notices of the introduction of
other bills had been given Speaker
Gully read the Queen's speech, which
had previously been read in both
houses of Parliament. The speech was
then moved and seconded. Sir Wil
liam Vernon Harcourt, the opposition
leader, said the Government could not
complain that the House and court
were demanding explanations on many
matters. When 100,000 men were in
arms in various parts, he added, they
could not congratulate themselves
upon Pax Britannia.
The Irish Parliamentary party met
in committee room No. 15. Timothy
Healy and his supporters, who ab
stained from attending the party meet
ing previous to the last session of Par
liament, were present. John Dillon was
re-elected chairman, and the whips and
secretaries were also re-elected.
Mr. Healy proposed Edmund Vesey
Knox, member for the city of London
derry, as chairman, and Michael Davitt
proposed John Dillon, who was elected
by a vote of 34 to 14.

Washington, Feb. 8.
The House to-day entered upon the
consideration of the Aldrich-Plowman
contested election casÂ« from the Fourth
Alabama District. The majority of the
committee reported in favor of seating
the Republican candidate on the
ground of conspiracy, an allegation
vigorously denied by the Democratic
minority. Plowman's plurality on the
face of the returns was 2967. The ma
jority revised the figures so as to give
Aldrich a plurality of 342. Two speeches
were made to-day : oh each side, by
Taylor of Ohio and Mann of Illinois,
and by Fox of Mississippi and Settle
of Kentucky for the minority. It Is ex
pected that a vote will be reached to
morrow.
In the House to-day a bill was passed
authorizing the Lewlston and Concord
Bridge Company to construct and main
tain a bridge across the anake River, be
tween Idaho and Washington.
The Senate amendments to the agricul
tural appropriation bill were disagreed to
and the bill was sent to conference.
"Wadsworth, Warner and Williams were
appointed conferees.
Taylor (R.) of Ohio, chairman of the
Elections Committee' No. 1, then called up
the contested election case of William F.
Aldrich vs. Thomas S. Plowman, from the
Fourth Alabama District.
Plowman, the sitting member, is a
Democrat, and Aldrich was the Populist
and Republican candidate. The majority
of the committee reported solidly in favor
of unseating Plowman. Taylor, who
opened the debate with an elaborate ar
gument in favor of sustaining the ma
jority report, deplored the fact that a
partisan body was called upon To pass
upon an election case, but in this particu
lar instance he said there had been no
draft upon his political prejudices. He
explained the Alabama election laws,
which he said could not have been framed
more effectively to encourage fraud and
thwart the people's will. The illiterate
voter, he said, was absolutely at the
mercy of the ticket marker. Fraud, he
said, was everywhere; not lurking or se
cret, but bold and insolent.
Fox (D.) of Mississippi presented the
case of the minority, which reported that
Plowman was entitled to retain his seat.
He dwelt upon the fact that Aldrich was
not the regular nominee of the Republi
can party and was opposed on the stump
by leading Republicans and Populists,
and that any assumption that he com
manded the full strength of the Republi
cans and Populists of the district was un
warranted. While there was a time, said
Fox, when the magic names of Lincoln
and Grant, together with baseless fear
that the domination of their former mas
ters might again impress them into
slavery, kept the negroes solid, that time
had gone. Republicans from the North
had no right to assume that every negro
was a Republican because his skin was
black. He controverted the claim that
a conspiracy existed, and maintained that
a revision of the returns in accordance
with the testimony would still give Plow
man a plurality of 2457.
Mann (R.) of Illinois, a member of the
You may/ ask yourself, What
is this HUDYAN that is so ex-
tensively advertised all over the
United States ? The answer is :
HUDYAN is a discovery by the
doctors of the Hudson Medical
Institiote. It is a certain cure
for nervous disorders. It, does
not do the impossible. It does
not cure consumption or tumors,
but it does rejnvrnate and re-
store man. HUDYAN cures
those nervous disorders due to
overwork, worry , errors of youth,
dissipation. HUDYAN is sim-
ply marvelous in its health-
giving attributes. The glow of
health perfumes the entire body.
You feel that you are of the
world and can conquer. You
feel full of vim. Don't you know
that it is trueâ we are natural
born fighters? We conquer.
Think of the countless haps that
ivould kill yon from infancy
but for the ego in you! You are
to be brave.
Now, if you are weak it is your
own fault, your own error. Get
strong, be vigorous. HUDYAN
will do it for yon. You ivill be
surprised with the result. You
will feel the brace, the joy of
strength through rvery linib and
organ and pore of the body. The
eye that now lacks luster will be.
electric in its strength. The
gaunt, shambling gait will
break into the sturdy, straight
walk of a man. Then why don't

committee, who followed, in concluinc:
his argument in favor of the majoÃty
. report, said he had gone into the cisc
with his prejudices in favor of the Soiih.
His people were all Southerners. %it
after examination of the testimony frrpd
was patent, and he could not but cti
demn a condition which by conspiracy
sought to control the Congress of tie
United States and legislate throuii
fraud for the business interests of tlfe
country. He appealed to his Republic;*
associates to vote to seat "the man whA
in the face of vilification, had the nervl
and the manhood to say to the rascall
who pursued him, 'I will fight you till I
die. 1 "
Settle (D.) of Kentucky and a member
of the committee, in opening his argu
ment, said that while he feared the ver
dict against Plowman was already made
up he could not believe that honest men
would seize upon a combination of iso
lated Irregularities, none of which
amounted to actual fraud, as a sop or
conscience and vote to unseat a feilow
member because he was a Democrat.
Settle was very severe in his condemna
tion of Aldrich'S tactics. His remarks
were given close attention and frequent
ly aroused his political associates to
manifestations of enthusiastic approval.
Some of his sallies were applauded even
by Republicans. Without completing his
argument he yielded to a motion to ad
journ, and at 5:05 p. m. the House ad
journed.
SESSION OF THE SENATE.
WASHINGTON, Feb. S.-In the Senata
to-day Stewart of Nevada secured the

ment between the Dawes Commission and

In accordance with notice previously
given, Chandler called up the resolution

At the conclusion of Chandler's remarks

People shudder at the tales of Monte
Carlo suicides, but look on with perfect
equanimity while friends and loved ones
commit just a3 certain suicide by neglecting:
their health. Trifling disorders of the di-
gestion persistently neglected lead to im-
purity of the. blood, the tissues of the body
are imperfectly nourished, and emacia-
tion and debility follow. In the case of
t that dread disease, consumption, imperfect-
| ly nourished tissue is built up in the lung 9,
i forming a suitable soil for tte germs of that
deadly .disease. One-seventh of all the
deaths each year are due to consumption.
j This fearful death , rate could be easily
: avoided if the proper remedy was re-
i sorted to. ,- . â  â . . .
A sure preventive and cure of consump-
tion is found in Dr. Pierces Golden Med-
ical Discovery. It cures 98 per cent, of all
cases. It corrects all disorders of digestion,
invigorates the liver, and makes the blood
pure and plentiful. It is the great blood-
maker, flesh-builder, and nerve invigorator.

A NESTEGG
Actual Start of Rev. J. A. j
B. Wilson's Home for
Girls.
He Describes the Ideal Resting
Place for Independent
Young Women,
The Good Work May Be Carried
On by Any Four Benevolent
People.
The Rev. John A. B. Wilson wishes
to establish a home for working
women in San Francisco, similar to
the one he so successfully conducted
in New York some years ago. That
San Francisco recognizes the need for
such an institution Is evidenced by
the fact that a recent article in The
Call has awakened interest in Dr. Wil
son's scheme.
"A gentleman who read of my inten
tion to start a home for women who
must work and who are not receiving
wages enough to pay their board in
the ordinary boarding-house," said Dr.
Wilson yesterday, "has made me a
most generous offer. He promises to
give $100 toward furnishing such a
home and $10 monthly to meet its ex
penses.
"Now, if there are but four more
like him in San Francisco the home
may be established to-morrow.
"I have found the house which is
ideally fitted for my plan. It is just
four blocks from Market and Kearny
streets. It has twelve rooms, a large
garden and a yard where chickens
might be kept. And the rent is only
$25 a month. All these homely details
mean much for the success of this un
dertaking. And people are not aware
of the great necessity for such a place
as I propose to establish. As I have
said before, there are four places with
in ten minutes' walk of my office
where dissolute women may be cared
for without charga, but there is not,
to my knowledge, one place where re
spectable women out of employment
may be sent on the same conditions, j
Do you know that a young girl from
a hospital, without employment, with
out money and homeless, simulated
approaching- maternity in order to pro
cure shelter in a home for the disso
lute? Later, when taken ill and car
ried to the hospital, the physicians
discovered the deception and found her
to be absolutely chaste. I verified this
story. In the winter of 1594 I was told
that virtuous women had become in
toxicated that they might be admitted
to shelters provided for the fallen, they
knowing of none for the pure.
â 'Instances could be multiplied show-
Ing the importance of the movement in
which San Franciscans are only Just
now showing proper interest. There are
thousands of girls thrown upon their
own resources and making a noble fight
to be good against both poverty and
temptation, receiving but from $2 GO to
V per week; and, some of them, with
others depending upon them for bread.
The wonder is not that so many give
up the fight, but that more do not. The
mightiest heroes and heroines are not
the victors of battle, but these working
girls who are fighting to be good
against such fearful odds.
"Here's a case that I met when I
started the co-operato in New York. A
young woman, a literary woman, had
married. She had been very success
ful with her work, but her husband be
came an invalid. She nursed him, had
to give up all her engagements and
when he died she was destitute and out
of employment. Moreover, she couldn't
pick up the threads of her profession
which she had dropped in her trouble.
Finally she secured a place in a pub
lishing house, where she was employed
to make translations in three lan
guages. She was a cultivated and a
bright woman. They would have paid
a man from $25 to $40 a week for such
work. They paid her $5. Xow, where
could she go to get board and lodging
on $? a week and have a little left with
which to clothe herself, pay carfare,
etc.? She came to us and stayed with
us a year, till she got more remunera
tive employment, when her place In our
home was filled by another."
The best point about this sort of a
home for working girls which Dr.
Wilson establishes is its non-sectarian
ism. Imagine a clean, comfortable,
kindly home, where there's a lack of
red tape, of offensive rules; in short,
of the bloodless, inhuman spirit that
bo often mars charitable institutions.
"This home for girls is not to be a
charity, though. It will be self-sup
porting after the home itself has been
furnished and rent paid. After It has
been fairly started it can provide a
real home, including the little extras
that belong to home life, by making
a weekly charge of $2 50. And tor
young women who arc temporarily un
employed there will be work about the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1898.
TOLD OF HER
HAPPY LIFE
Mrs. Hoffman Gives Her
Testimony in the Figel
Case.
Repeated the Statement Made
at the Preliminary .
Examination.
No New Points Disclosed by the
Witnesses so Far
When the trial of Theodore Figel
was resumed yesterday morning in
Judge Cook's court Mrs. Dora Hoff
man, the widow of Isaac Hoffman, was
called to the witness stand. She was
in deep mourning, and her actions
were closely watched and the testi
mony given attentively listened to by
Defendant Figel. In the room in
proximity to the witness stand was the
door taken from the telephone room,
stained with the life blood of her hus
band.
Under the examination of Judge
Murphy the widow told of the rela
tions existing between herself and
husband prior to and on the morning
of June 1. In detail she related the
parting with her husband on the morn
ing of tho shc-oting, and stated that he
was in good health and that they were
on the best of terms when they parted
on the morning of June 1.
By the statement of the witness it.
was learned that they had four chil
dren, to whom her husband had been
devoted, and that the entire estate,
amounting to $100,000, had been left to
herself and children. The witness was
then submitted to the mercies of the
cross-examiner, but the expectant lis
teners were dc-omed to disappointment,
as no questions were asked by General
Barnes for the defense, who stated
that if -he deemed it necessary he
would recall the witness for the de
fonse. Then the heavily veiled widow
left the courtroom without d^lay.
After Mrs. Hoffman's testimony had
been heard all interest in the case dur
ing the remainder of the day seemed
to die out. People came and went and
the defendant smiled. The next wit
ness called was Henry M. Harris, a
clerk in the employment of Hoffman,
Rothchlld & Co. HÂ» testified that he
had been acquainted with the deceased
merchant for ten years, and that so
far as he knew Hoffman had been
practical and industrious, happy and
contented, and that there was no no
ticeable difference in his actions dur
ing the day of June 1.
The witness said that he had left the
store that evening at 5:55 o'clock and
that the store was usually closed at
5:30, but that Isaac Hoffman had not
left the establishment at the time of
his departure for his home.
As has been the rule, nothing new
was elicited from the witness further
than the testimony given at the pre
liminary examination. It was asked by
the defense if it was unusual for Theo
dore Figel to take books of the firm
home with him in the evening, and the
witness stated that it was not. His
examination was exceedingly short.
Harris pave way to Clarence M. Post,
another clerk in the employ of the firm,
who testified that the pistol with which
Hoffman was killed was once in pos
session of the defendant, and that Â«i
month prior to the death of Hoffman
the pistol had been exhibited to the
witness by Flgel, and that he next saw
the weapon when it was in the posses
sion of a police detective. There was
no cross-examination.
He was followed by Herman Ferren
bach, the special police officer who
found Isaac Hoffman- bleeeding and
unconscious in the store on the even
ing of June 1. He stated that he en
tered-on his duties on the evening of
the shooting about 5:30 o'clock; that he
had seen Figel about 6:10 on Bush
street, near Battery, and that the de
fendant walked to Battery street.where
he joined Isaac Hoffman. The witness
then told of his walk around his local
ity and his arrival at the store about
6:45. He tried the door, as was his
usual custom, and found it unlocked,
and passed into the store. He saw a
light in the rear office, and passing in
found the wounded man, who he stated
was unconscious, but still alive and
bleeding freely from two pistol
wounds in the head. He stated that he
had picked up the revolver and given
it to Officer Colen after he had sent the
wounded man to the Receiving Hospi
tal. He testified that his hands were
bloody at the time he picked up the
revolver.
In cross-examination nothing new
was brought to light, but the witness
said that Isaac Hoffman was aware
that it was his duty to guard that
store.
The first witness during the after
noon was to have been Officer Colen,
but sickness prevented his appearance
and the testimony given by him at the
preliminary examination was read to
the jury by Judge Murphy. His
statement as read told the story of his
meeting with Officer Ferrenbach, the
arrival at the store, the hurried call
for the patrol wagon and the removal
of the wounded man to the Receiving
Hospital.
The bullets found In the room and the
revolver with which the deed was com
mitted were shown to the jury, but the
reading of the testimony previously
given did not bring out any new points
and it was asked by the defense what
point was to be proved by the testi
mony, but they were left in ignorance.
The testimony, in part, relates to the
pieces of the dead man's skull found
on the bloody carpet and the paper
which was presumed to have been un
der Hoffman's head before he had stag
gered or been dragged into the adjoin
ing office.
Officer Burr Love, Dr. J. F. Kearney
of the City Receiving Hospital and
Deputy Coroner J. G. Tyrrell were
called to give evidence concerning th>">
removal of the body from the store to
the hospital and afterward to the
Morgue. The witnesses were not cross
examined.
Detective Charles Crockett was then
called and he was questioned at length
concerning the condition of the re
volver at the time it was to him.
Hâ¬ testified as in the preliminary ex
amination ihat he had detected spots
of blood on the pistol and that he had
handled it very carefully, that the evi
dence might be preserved. Questions,
however, brought out the fact that the
slouth had carried the pistol in his
overcoat pocket, and as the witness
stated he had the bloody side up, which
was thought by him to have prevented
contact of pistol and coat, some amus
ing incident* came up during the exam
ination of the witness. General Barnes
stood between the witness and the
prosecuting attorney. Judge Murphy,
and was politely informed by the Judge
that he was not transparent and it was
consequently hard to see Ihrough him.
The General promptly replied that he
had no difficulty In seeing through the
Judge, at any rat? through his actions.
Then Charles Crockett was called Hoff
man, which caused a plight tittering
among the lookers-on. In a moment
the trial was resumed and flowed on in
the even and uninteresting tenor of its
way. More evidence will be introduced
to-day.
AFTER WELBURN.
Circulars Asking for His Arrest to
Be Distributed by the United
States Marshal.
T'nited States Marshal Baldwin Is pre
paring type-written circulars for distribu
tion to United States Marshals in Arizona
and Texas, giving :t minute description
of Osca M. Welburn, ex-Collector of In
ternal Revenue, who is wanted by the
United States authorities here on an In
dictment with thirty-one counts charg
ing him with neglecting to pay over to
the Government money received by him
as disbursing officer. If the Marshal suc
ceeds in getting authority to make the
necessary expenditure he will have sev
eral thousand circulars printed contain
ing a photo of the missing ex-Collector
and a complete description of him.
It is believed that Welburn Is in hiding
in Texas near the Mexican border line,
nnd that the recent departure from hereof
Special Ag<-nt Thrasher was for the pur
pose of tracing the whereabouts of the
fugitive.
Internal Revenue Compromises.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue
has issued a circular with reference to
compromises in cases of violation of the
revenue laws. Collectors are instructed
not to solicit offers of compromise, and no
delinquent should be Induced by threats
to invoke the power of the Commissioner
to compromise, and no assurance should
be given of the probable action of the
Commissioner if an offer Is made- but
w"here the individual is ignorant of' such
a provision of law and desires to make
his appeal for clemency in the manner
provided, it is the duty of the Collector
to give him suitable Instructions. The
offer should he made In writing, and the
moneys tendered as tnx r>r penalty should
be deposited to the credit of the Secretary
of the Treasury.
Horses Are Not Cattle.
The Treasury Department has an
nounced that horse hides are not cattle
hides, and are therefore free of duty.
Cattle are defined as domesticated bovine
animalsâ oxen, cows, bulls and calves.
PECULIARITIES
OF THE POUND
A Dog That Should Have
Been Killed and Was
Not.
Judge Campbell Will Have to
Decide Upon a Serious
Question.
J. B. Marshall Arrested for Allowing
an Unlicensed Dog to Run
at I_.ai\_je.
The peculiarities of the pound were
exemplified in a case mat came for
the second time before Judge Campbell
yesterday.
J. B. Marshall of the Brighton saloon
on Eddy street was arrested on a war
rant sworn to by Miss Emma Balz on
a charge of allowing an unlicensed dog
to run at large. Marsnall was arrested
and gave $20 bail for his appearance
in court.
The case is a singular one. On Janu
ary 6, while Nathan Breslauer, a boy
about 10 years of age. who lives with
his widowed mother at 522 Golden Gate
avenue, was sitting on the fence divid
ing the yard of his mother's house
and the adjoining house occupied by
Mr. Crothers, a dog In the yard of the
latter bit him on the leg. A warrant
was obtained in Judge Campbell's
court for the arrest of Mr. Crothers,
and on the promise that the dog would
be taken to the pound and killed, the
warrant was not served.
Yesterday Miss Balz ascertained on
going to the pound that the dog had
not been killed. She found from the
Poundkeeper that on the previous oc
casion when the dog was taken to the
Central police station some one had
said that the dog would be taken home
and killed, and consequently the war
rant was not served.
Miss Balz on Monday saw the dog
running around the street and yester
day she applied to Judge Campbell for
a warrant for the arrest of J. B. Mar
shall on the charge of allowing an un
licensed dog to run at large. Marshall
was arrested and grave $20 cash bail.
According to Mrs. Breslauer the dog
belonged to Marshall and had been left
with Crothers, who resided at 524
Golden Gate avenue and who is Mar
shall's father-in-law. On January 6,
when the boy was sitting on the fence
that divides the two houses the dog
jumped at and bit him on the leg. The
bite was so painful that two physicians
had to be summoned and the boy for
several days had to walk on crutches.
Mrs. Brps'.auer was afraid of hydro
phobia and insisted upon the dog being
killed. The dog was taken to the Cen
tral police station and on the promise
that it would be killed by thÂ» pound
master the charge was withdrawn.
The poundmaster went to the Nor
mandie Hotel the following day, where
Marshall was staying, for the dog, and
was told that it had been killed.
Mips Ball on Monday was told that
thf> dog was still alive and applied to
Judge Campbell for the warrant for the
arrest of Marshall, and some interest
ing developments are expected in court
to-day.
THE BRISTOL LIBELED.
Suit Against a British Steamer for
Damages for Alleged Breach,
of Charter Party.
A libel was filed yesterday against the
British steamer Bristol by the Portland
and Alaska Trading and Transportation
Company to recover $21,000 for alleged
brfnch of charter party.
The complaint charges that a contract j
was entered into between the parties '.
whereby the Bristol was to convoy and !
tow when necessary the steamer Eugene
with 130 passengers to St. Michael
for a consideration of $15,000. and that the
Bristol by unskillful towing injured the \
Eugene in a .storm after having gone
out of the regular ocean track and after
having deln>ed starting on the voyage j
j"or six days. It is also alleged that the
passengers by means of threats forced
E. B. McFarfand, representing the libel
ant, to sign a release of the contract as i
far as the owners of the Bristol were con
cerned.

CATARRH OFJTHE STOMACH.
A Pleasant Simple, but Safe Effectual ;
Cure for It.
Catarrh of the stomach has long
i been considered the next thing to mi-
i curable.
The usaul symptoms are a full or
j bloating sensation after eating, accom-
\ panied sometimes with sour or watery
i risings, a formation of gases, causing
i pressure on the heart and lungs and
! difficult breathing; headache, fickle ap-
i petite, nervousness and a general
â  played out, languid feeling.
There is often a foul taste in the
I mouth, coated tongue, and if the in-
terior of the stomach could be seen it
would show a slimy, inflamed condi-
tion.
The cure for this common and ob-
l stinate trouble is found in a treatment
which causes the food to be readily,
thoroughly digested before it has time
i to ferment and irritate the delicate
mucous surfaces of the stomach.
According to Dr. Harlanson the
safest and best treatment is to use af-
â  ter each meal a tablet, composed of
! Disatase, Aseptic Pepsin, a little Nux,
! Golden Seal and fruit acids.
These tablets can now be found at
all drugstores under the name of Stu-
art* Dyspepsia Tablets, and, not
being a patent medicine, can be used
with perfect safety and assurance that
i healthy appetite and thorough diges-
! tion will follow their regular use after
meals.
Mr. N. J. Boober of 2710 Dearborn
street, Chicago, 111., writes: "Catarrh
is a local condition resulting from a
neglected cold in the head, whereby
the lining membrane of the nose be-
comes inflamed and the poisonous dis-
charge therefrom, passing backward
into the throat, reaches the stomach,
thus producing catarrh of the stomach.
Medical authorities prescribed for me
for three years for catarrh of stomach
without cure, but to-day I am the hap-
piest of men after using only one box
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. I can-
not find appropriate words to express
mv good feeiinc.
I have found flesh, appetite and sound
rest from their use.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is the
safest preparation, as well as the
simplest and most convenient remedy
for any form of indigestion, catarrh
of stomach, biliousness, sour stomach,
heartburn and bloating after meals.

stomach troubles, by addressing Stu-
art Co., Marshall, Mich. Tie tablets

ize that he has been duly snatched than he wants
the woman who has been instrumental in his
salvation to marry him. Probably, this is that having
been saved he may remain so. Often he is refused,
whereupon he goes back to fan-tan and ways that are
dark. In many instances he is accepted. Then de
cency blushes and pale yellow half-breeds begin to
people the thoroughfares.
But the woman who saved You Fos, and for the
sake of keeping him saved was willing to become his
â¢rife, has backed down. She had a lucid interval and
balked at the altar. It seems that the minister to
whom the twain applied for the tying of the knot
chanced to be neither fool nor knave, so he told the
girl to go home. She went, and the stricken You
Fos has brought suit for damages for breach of
promise. In Pittsburg he may get something more
substantial than what is technically known as the
"ha ha." In this State he would never get a cent
by the verdict of any jury. To be sure there would
be some satisfaction in cinching a woman who had
been so idiotic as to permit a Chinese to make love
to her, yet it mu<t be remembered that she reformed,
and that in all probability a Chinese was her only
chance.
NO EXCUSE FOR BRUTALITY.
COMMON instincts of the human heart check
any impulse to speak ill of the dead, and a
breach of this rule can only be justified when
it has been made necessary in defense of the living.
If the dead are to be protected, surely the unfortu
nate, groping mindless in the borderland, is entitled
to at least equal consideration; in the name of de
cency is entitled to more. The dead are past all
harming. At times the clouds hovering about the
mentality may be dissipated and the vacant eye, tak
ing on again the old light, look once more upon the
world, realizing what it sees. Why prepare for it
an insult or why harrow up the feelings of friends
who mourn as for one who has been called away?
Perhaps the Post will tell.
The statement that Sutro has not paid his share of
taxes comes with bad grace from the organ of the
Southern Pacific, a monopoly which pays no tax it
can wriggle out of. which tries to repudiate its debts,
which preys upon the community it should serve;, an
organization so venal and corrupt as to be a reproach
upon the nation itself. Let the Post look to the
source whence it draws pap.
When General Flagler, chief of ordnance of the
War Department, was informed that tests made at the
Presidio showed that 50 per cent of the shrapne!
shells supplied to the light artillery at this post was
defective he dismissed the subject with the remark,
"It is of small importance, as the shells are used in
small caliber or field guns." This is the first time
high military authority has taken the ground that the
importance of a swindling operation in ammunition
varies with the size of the gun for which the ammuni
tion is intended. According to the Flagler scale of
estimates, if 50 per cent of the rifle cartridges fur
nished the infantry were defective it would be of no
importance whatever.
French politeness is a trait of wide renown. Zola
himself probably has a high regard for it. Yet in
this wild Western Hemisphere an eminent author
brought to the bar would not be greeted by threats
of being spat upon. We even think in our uncouth

upon the sidewalk.

Of course Blar.co's tour of Cuba was a failure.

THE SAX FR AX CISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 9, '1898.
BLAINE'S HAWAIIAN POLICY.
SO much has been said about Blame's Hawaiian
policy that it is well to see what it was.
It has been distorted into nameless shapes to
convert it into an argument for annexation, and that
sentiment in the country which followed the Maine
statesman to the close of his career has been ap
pealed to for a supply of post-mortem enthusiasm in
behalf of the pending treaty.
Mr. Blame supported the independence of Hawaii
and considered only one emergency in which annex
ation could be justified, and that was imminence of
seizure by a foreign power. No such crisis has ap
peared. Its appearance has been often simulated,
frequently pretended and many times prophesied,
when it had no reality, present nor prospective. The
politicians of the Dole oligarchy and their allies in
this country have done their best to nag Japan into
a hostile demonstration, but without success. In
fine there has been no evidence of the actual situation
in which Blame proposed a step beyond maintenance
of the independence of the islands.
In 1881 England was suspected of an intention to
demand consular jurisdiction over British coolies
from Hongkong. Blame, then Secretary of State,
instructed our Minister at Honolulu to this effect:
"The Government of the United States has, with un
varying consistency, manifested respect for the in
dependence of the Hawaiian kingdom and an earn
est desire for the welfare of its people. It has al
ways felt and acted on the conviction that the pos
session of those islands by a peaceful and prosperous
power, with which there was no possibility of con
troversy or collision, was most desirable, in refer
ence to its own large and rapidly increasing interests
in the Pacific. It has declined even at the request of
the Hawaiian people to assume over their affairs a
protectorate, which would be only a thinly disguised
domination, and it has confined its efforts and in
fluence to strengthening their government and open
ing to their commerce the readiest and most profit
able connection with its own markets. But this pol
icy has been based upon our belief in the real and
substantial independence of Hawaii. The Govern
ment of the United States has always avowed, and
now repeats, that under no circumstances will it per
mit the transfer of the territory or sovereignty of
those islands to -any of the European powers. The
United States was one of the first among the great
nations to take an active interest in the upbuilding
of Hawaiian independence and the creation of a new
potential life for its people. It has consistently en
deavored, with success, to enlarge the material pros
perity of Hawaii on an independent basis."
He asserted over and over again that no departure
from this policy could be justified by anything short
of an attempt to acquire jurisdiction by any other
power.
Therefore, in the absence of such attempt, and
none is in sight or likely to be made, the Blame
policy of neutrality and independence must stand.
The threat of the Dole oligarchy to trade the coun
try off to some other nation does not constitute such
an attempt. It is nothing less than a confession that
the oligarchy can no longer rest upon the support
of 2 per cent of the people, and that unless it can use
its usurped and temporary authority to cede the
islands to an outside power, the majority will install
a. government in its place.
RESPECTFULLY DECLINED.
OUR valued contemporary, the Mission street
Boodler, asks us to assist it in getting an "ad
vertising" contract out of the Spring Valley
Water Company. We are compelled to refuse the
request. We are always ready to relieve the op
pressed and uplift the downtrodden in journalism,
but we draw the line at corporation "advertising"
contracts. We do not solicit such contracts our
selves, owing to the moral turpitude involved in exe
cuting them, and much as we might wish to relieve
the financial difficulties of the Boodler, we are com
pelled to decline to assist it in blackmailing the
water company.
Perhaps in respect, to corporation "advertising"
contracts The Call is a trifle youthful, but if it is we
cannot help it. We take the same view of our duty
to our readers as was taken by the Supreme Court of
a newspaper's general duty to its readers in the cele
brated case of Fitch vs. De Young. The Boodler
will remember that the defendant in that case, in
order to escape the penalty of libel, took the position
that the owner of a newspaper, by virtue of his own
ership, had a right to sell its space and Its influence to
whomsoever he wished, and that, therefore, it was not
libelous to say that he had sold it. A Superior Judge
was found who sustained this contention on the sa
cred ground that it is the privilege of a than to do
with his property as he pleases. But when the case
was taken to the Supreme Court that tribunal came
to the rescue of decency and morality. It declared
that a newspaper's readers are its clients and that it
has no more right to sell them to corporations se
cretly than it would have to pick their pockets or rob
their houses.
It may be an evidence of our weakness, but we
think this is good law and good morals. We do not
believe the Boodler should be allowed to force the
water company to "advertise" unless it makes the en
tire business public at the time the sale takes place.
The vice of the $30,000 contract with the Southern
Pacific Company was its secrecy. The Boodler
never said a word about drawing $1000 a month
from the railroad treasury, nor that it had contracted
to treat the monopoly with "justice" through two
Legislatures and a State campaign. In fact, it kept
its readers entirely in the dark on the subject until
Huntingdon himself told a reporter in New York
that the Boodler's enmity was due to the fact that he
had cut it off the railroad payroll.
We do not say that the rates of the Spring Valley
Company should not be reduced. It seems to us as
well as to the Boodler that $778,000 is an enormous
sum to pay in dividends in a single year. But how
would things be improved for the ratepayers if a por
tion of this $778,000 were turned over to the Boodler
for "advertising"? That might contribute to the hap
piness of the sheet, but would it make the people
any happier? The Boodler may think that when it
is happy the people are happy, but we differ from it
on that point. We think the converse is true. When
the Boodler is happy it is time for the people to look
out.
Even though the Boodler might put its request for
assistance in this matter on personal grounds, we
must still decline to grant it. The Boodler elected
the present Board of Supervisors and should apply to
its members 'for aid. It is reported that last year the
board got a contract and "dumped" the Boodler. If
this is true we have no hesitation in saying the board
was ungenerous, if not ungrateful. What the Boodler
should do this year is to avoid being "dumped." We
know of no other way in which it can get a contract
out of the water company.
Even if the confession of the old Tammany chic/
is in existence it is of less importance than a nice
fresh confession from the present chief would be.
THE LOS ANGELES WATER FIGHT.
BY action taken on Monday the Los Angeles
Common Council has given the water com
pany notice to file a complete inventory of its
property within two weeks in order that a basis may
be had for the settlement of the issue between the city
and the company.
This is the most important step which has been
taken by the city government in the interest of the
people since it first became clear that the water com
pany intended to hold on to the water supply of the
municipality after the lease had expired. If the ac
tion is followed up with due vigor it cannot fail to
secure the rights of the city, and may therefore be ac
counted an important victory of the people.
The issue is one that never should have arisen.
The case of the people Is so strong both in law and
in justice that the action of the water company in
opposing it could have emanated only from a desire
to plunder the public. By the terms of the lease un
der which the company has held the sources of water
supply in Los Angeles for thirty years the company
is bound to surrender possession of the property of
the city at the end of the term, and furthermore to
convey to the city all the improvements of the plant
at a price to be fixed by arbitrators.
It is a matter for amazement that under these cir
cumstances the company should have up to this
time declined to take any steps toward the fulfillment
of its obligations, while on the other hand showing a
thousand evidences of an intention # to hold on to the
plant at the expiration of the lease by postponing ar
bitration to the indefinite future.
At one time it appeared as if the scheme of the
company would be carried through with ease. The
three leading papers of the city were silenced and the
Common Council induced to do nothing. Weeks and
months passed, the time for the expiration of the
lease was drawing near, and nothing had been done
to determine the price the city should pay for the im
provements, or even to arrange for arbitration. The
game seemed to be in the hands of the water com
pany. It had only to keep quiet, lull the people to
repose and postpone arbitration in order to be in a
strong position to hold the water property of the city
for a long time to come.
Fortunately Los Angeles had some citizens who
could not be induced to be silent in the presence of
this scheme either by fear or favor, by bribes or
bullying. They began a fight for the interests of the
people which attracted attention throughout the
State, notwithstanding the fact that the leading papers
of Los Angeles either ignored it or denounced those
who led it.
At that juncture The Call discerned the importance
of the controversy and at once gave the advocates
of the rights of the city a chance to be heard. The
whole scheme for retaining possession of the prop
erty of the city was exposed. Public sentiment was
aroused. Mass meetings were held. Popular indig
nation made itself felt and the schemers of the water
company were compelled to abandon their plan of
winning by a still hunt. %
The action taken by the Common Council in call
ing for an inventory of the property of the water
company within two weeks may under the circum
stances be regarded as the beginning of the end of
the contest. Mayor Snyder is known to be strongly
on the side of the people, and now that he has the
Council with him there can hardly be but one re
sult. A victory has been won for justice and law,
and The Call congratulates the people of Los An
geles upon the outlook for the recovery of their
property.
ZOLA IN COURT.
BEFORE the officials of the French Government
entered upon the prosecution of Emile Zola
they would have done well to consider^ the re
sults of similaT prosecutions against men 6i genius
in times past. Had they done so they probably
would have decided to let the case pass and left the
novelist free to make of the Dreyfus incident a ro
mance or a political sensation, as he pleased.
In every single instance where a Government has
prosecuted a man endowed with a high order of lit
erary ability it has suffered a defeat and been marked
through all history with a stain that nothing can
erase. It has not mattered in the least whether the
Government was right or wrong, whether the genius
was a saint or a rascal. The one important fact has
been that the Government side of the case has been
buried in dull official reports which nobody reads,
while the writer has told his with a vigor and grace
that win a way for them into the minds of all who
love literature and delight in eloquence.
Plutarch tells us that King Minos of Crete, who
for so many ages has been remembered as the
original of the Minotaur, was really a just and good
sovereign. He had the misfortune, however, to of
fend the Athenians, and the brilliant wits and poets
of that city of genius at once lampooned him and de
nounced him and fastened upon him for all time the
charges and stories that have made his name a
synonym of all that is most brutal and bestial in na
ture. It is not with impunity, adds Plutarch, that one
can offend the favorites of the muses.
Daniel Defoe was not a particularly good citizen,
nor a very great genius, but the British officials who
sent him to the pillory remain pilloried to this day
in history. There is reason to believe Dean Swift
was not altogether a perfect saint, but all the same
the men who turned him from court and banished
him to Ireland found little pleasure while living, and
no increase of reputation since death, from the pic
tures he drew of them in "Gulliver's Travels." Vol
taire was not a model in any respect, but the Govern
ment that sent him to the Bastille has never been re
membered with special favor by any class or genera
tion of men from that day to this.
It is useless to multiply instances. When law as
sails a man who can write "thoughts that breathe in
words that burn" the right or wrong of the contest
has no effect on the result upon public opinion. The
world- forgives genius that entertains it, and it never
forgives governments for being dull. It reads the
work of the poet and romancer and does not read the
law documents.
Zola may be condemned, and it may be proved he
is rightly condemned, but it will avail his prosecutors
nothing. When he turns away from the Government
and the populace, from the court and the crowd, and
in the seclusion of his library takes up his pen he
will have in his hand a weapon that will win the fight
for him for all time. What he writes will be read,
and the world, interested and charmed by the forceful
and vivid style of the great realist, will never know
any side of the story except his.
Train time between Chicago and Denver was once
nearly forty-eight hours, but is now a little more than
twenty-eight. California people would be glad to
have Mr. Huntington while in the East pick up a
few ideas as to how this sort of thing is accom
plished.
"We think not," announces the Stockton Mail. It 1
is only fair to say that this circumstance had not
passed unnoticed.

THE SONG OF THE SEA.
Oh, the song of the Sea,
The wonderful song of the Sea!
Like the far-off hum of a throbbing drum
It steals through the night to me;
And my fancy wanders free
To a little seaport town,
And a spot I knew, where the roses grew,
By a cottage small and brown.
And a child strayed up and down
O'er hillock and beach and lea,
And crept at dark to his bed, to hark
To the wonderful eong of the Sea.
Oh, the song of the Sea,
The mystical song of the Soa!
"Chut strains of Joy to a dreaming boy
That music was wont to be!
And the night-wtnd through the tree
Was a perfumed breath that told
Of the spicy gales that filled the sails
Where the tropic billows rolled,
And the rovers hid their gold
By the lone palm on the key â
But the whispering wave their secret gave
In the mystical song of the Sea.
Oh, the song of the Sea,
The beautiful song of the Sea!
The mighty note from the ocean's throat.
The laugh of the wind in glee!.
And swift as the ripples flee
With the surges down the shore.
It bears me back, o'er life's long track,
To home and Its love once more;
I stand at the open door.
Dear mother, apain with thee,
And hear afar on the" booming bax
The beautiful song of the Sea.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Special gunnery and torpedo courses
are to be given for retired captains, com
manders and lieutenants of the British
navy who are on the list' of volunteers
for further service, and those who attend
the course will receive the full pay of
their grade. The courses will begin March
28 and terminate June 24.
The total naval estimates of Denmark
for 189S-99 amount to $3,251 .ISO, or at the
rate of $1 CO per capita of the population.
This total includes $200,000 toward the con
struction of an armored ship to be named
Herluf Trolle.
Marquis de Villamayer and Marquis
Courillas have offered $50,000 and $100,000
respectively to the Spanish Government
as an aid to strengthen the navy.
The JUIs and^Hyane gunboats, to re
place old vesels under the same names
in the German navy, have been nearly
completed. They are very much like the
British gunboats of that size, and are of
895 tons displacement, 1300 horse power
and 12 knot speed. As they draw only ten
feet they are well adapted for the service
intended, on the African coast and on the
rivers in the Orient.
The British Admiralty is about to have
tests made of cellulose made from corn
stalk pith, an American invention which
was tried in this country last year with
decided success.
The Portuguese cruiser Adamastor,
built by Orlando Brothers, Leghorn,
Italy, has had her final trials, and ex
ceeded her guaranteed speed of 17.5 knots
by over half a knot. The vessel is 242 feet
2 Inches in length, 35 feet 2 inches beam,
and on a draught of 14 feet aft, with 419
tons of coal, displaces 1902 tons. Her twin
Screw engines are of 4000 horse power,
with four single end boilers carrying 160
pounds steam, having a heating Burface
of 8823 square feet and 262 square feet of
grate. During her six hours' natural
draught trial the engines developed 3100
horse power and gave a speed of 17.19
knots. The forced draught trial gave
4030 horse power and 18.04 knot speed.
The coal consumption was exceptionally
low, being only 1.45 pounds per horse
power at 10 knots, anil giving the ship a
radius of action or endurance at 10 knots
of 8596 miles.
During the past year four battle-ships
in the British navy have been completed
and undergone the specified trials, which
consist of a continuous eight hours' steam
ing under natural draught, four under
forced draught, and thirty hours under
half boiler power to ascertain the coal
consumption under ordinary cruising con
ditions. The following are the . tabu
lated results of the trials in the order
named above:

Jupiter 12,475 15.4
Mars 12.483 17.7
Hannibal 12,138 17.G
Caesar 12,653 18.7
Under half power the Jupiter made 14.1
knots with 1.51 pounds of coal per horse
power per hour; Mars, 14.4 knots, using
1.93 pounds of coal; Hannibal, 14.8 knots
on 1.78 pounds of coal, and Caesar 14.8
knots with 1.93 pounds of coal. The mean
horsepower developed by the four ships
in the order named was. 6198, 6039, 6124
and 6309. A fifth battle-ship, the Illus
trious, had only made her coal-consump

the lowa of 11,410 tons. The steaming
records of the American battle-ships are
given in order to make comparisons with
the latest productions, and considering
the discrepancies in size and that all but

the American battleships' performance is
very creditable:

The American speed data are derived
from a measured course, while the British
are from patent log and overrated.
The German navy comprises the follow

Two admirals, three vice-admirals, nine
rear admirals: forty-seven captains;
eighty-two commanders, of whom sixteen
of superior rank; 171 first liteutenants,
264 second lieutenants and 179 sublieuten

casts of the tenderloin and who tell from
pulpits of the evil done our city by the
sporting fraternity that makes its yearly
visit to the coast," said a gentleman in
the office of the Baldwin last night. "The
reason I speak thus," continued he, "ia
a little occurrence I just witnessed as I
was standing in front of the cigar-stora
about half an hour ago. A little fellow,
who could not have been over 10 or 1J
years of age, was standing near the curb.
When along came a tout, who I know my
self to be about as hard a character as
any racetrack ever produced. He was
walking very quickly, and his whole air
was that of a man in the hardest kind
of luck. Just as he came opposite the boy
the little fellow's sobbing attracted his
attention, and, stopping, he asked him
what was the matter. 'I ain't had nothin*
to eat since mornin', 'cause I lost all m'
dough shootin' craps,' replied the youtn:
'an' I was trun down when der evenin
poipers cum out." 'Well,' said the tout.
'I'm up against it myself so hard that
there is only one case in m' jeans; but
when it comes to goin' hungry 1 guess I
am more used to the graft than you are,
so you'd better take this.' And blessed
if he didn't hand over to the urchin tho
whole dollar, which was every rent ho
had in the world."
HUMAN FENDERS FOR CARS.
- Editor of The Call: The Call has de
voted so much time and labor in explain
ing the many devices submitted for street
car fenders that I fear it may be presum
ing too much on your valuable space to
ask the publication of my views in the
matter. However, as I do not recollect
any one suggesting the fender that is, in
my opinion, the only practical and effi
cacious one. I submit it for what it is
worth. It is simply the Human Fender,
and consists in each street railroad com
pany manning each car with a strictly
No. 1 motor man and a strictly No. 1 con
ductor, well paid for their services and
not compelled to work more than eight,
or at most ten hours per day, so that
their attention can always be concentrat
ed on their work, with strict rules in re
gard to any accident that might happen
on their car. I do not wish in the least
to reflect on the present employes, as
there are doubtless an army of superior
men engaged, but by making the hours of
Labor as short as possible and the pay -as
large as possible it will act as an incen
tive to the very best class of labor to
"seek that employment and to retain their
places by avoiding by their extra atten
tion to duty any accident occurring by
the respective cars in their charge. A
simple rule making it a cause for dis
charge for any motorman to propel his
car at a rate of more than eight miles an
hour will speedily regulate the 'speed of
the cars, so no danger can come from fast
driving. By this means I think the rail
road company will save money by .avoid
ing annoying and expensive suits for
damages, and all that they would be re
quired to furnish each car with would' be
a wire netting or slat arrangement flush
with the front and sides of the car, as
any fender rigged out several feet in
front is an extra danger, and any scoop
arrangement wich might be worked oy
the motorman only divides his attention,
probably preventing him from stopping
his car as quickly as he otherwise would,
or in some cases probably inducing soma
romantic fellow to try to see how slick he
could scoop up the subject. One more
source of some danger lies in running 1 two
cars together, as the extra length some
times causes a person to cross the street
after it passes, without noticing the car
or team coming in an opposite direction.

THE WATER-FRONT NEWS.
Owing to the Scarcity or Vessels
Lumber Freights Have Taken
a Big Jump.
The -wind chopped around to the
northwest yesterday and blew fourteen
miles an hour at Point Reyes. In con
sequence steamers and sailing vessels
that have been bucking heav;| souther
ly weather for the last week managed
to reach port at last. The steamers
Xorth Fork and Jennie had a terrible
time of it, and their passengers, on sev
eral occasions, gave up hope. The big
collier Burma was away behind time,
and the ship Santa Clara and schooner
Marion report a succession of storms
lasting from Cape Flattery to San
Francisco.
The Xorth Fork left Eureka last Sun
day at 10 a. m. and did not reach port
until yesterday morning. The big seas
swept her from stem to stern, and dur
ing the entire trip the passengers were
confined to their staterooms. Off Cape
Mendocino she was hove to, and in
spite of everything she drifted back
about thirty miles. Yesterday she ran
into a lot of wreckage and Captain
Bash thinks that some coaster has lost
her deckload of railroad ties.
The Jennie was four days getting
here from Coquille River, and the Bur- '
ma took five days ten hours to come !
down from Nanaimo, B. C. The Presi- i
dent left Yaquina Bay last Friday, and
under ordinary circumstances she :
ought to have got in Sunday afternoon.
But the head winds and heavy seas :
were too much for. the stout vessel, and
several times Captain Nelson had to i
heave her to until the squalls were j
over. The schooner Marion was nine- !
teen days coming from Everett, and the !
ship Santa Clara, fifteen days from De- !
parture Bay. In reality the sailing yes- j
eels made both better time and better
weather of it than the steamers. The i
captain of the President reports that j
the red buoy on Channel rock in Ya
quina Bay has been washed away.
Ten big- steamers for the Klondike
trade are now on their way here from
the East, and two more from Liverpool, ;
England. The latest addition to the !
Eastern contingent are the Conemaugh,
Ohio and Illinois. All three are load- ,
ing for this port and are consigned to
Williams, Dimond & Co. and James F.
Chapman & Co. The Conemaugh will
get away about March 1 from New <
York, and the Ohio and Illinois from
Philadelphia abmit the same date. On |
arrival here th.-y will go into the Klon
dike trade, probably under the John-;
son -Locke Company's flag.

KLONDIKER MARRIED IN PUBLIC.
The Nuptials Were Celebrated at the Pavilion Before an Immense Gathering of People
Last Evening,
SCENE OF THE BRIDAL PARTY DURING THE UNIQUE CEREMONY.
The vast audience that crowded the Mechanics' Pavilion last night witnessed one of the most unique wed
dings that have ever been recorded. In the presence of an assemblage numbering between 15,000 and 20,000 people,
and in a public place, Henry Miller and Fanny Turner were made man and wife.
As early as 7 o'clock the crowd began to arrive, and at 9, the hour set for the ceremony, not even standing
room was to be had. The galleries were filled to overflowing, and the main floor of the Pavilion was also crowded
to Its utmost capacity. Upon a large stand erected in the middle of the main floor the ceremony was performed.
This stand was tastefully decorated with red bunting and smilax, while from the arch which spanned its
center there was suspended a large wedding bell, also made of smilax. In addition to these decorations there
was upon the stand the outfit necessary for a trip to the Klondike, which was presented the happy couple by the
Emporium.
It was exactly 9 o'clock when the strains of Mendelssohn's wedding march arose above the noise of the many
voices. Immediately a hush of expectancy fell over the assemblage, and there was a craning of necks and a clos
ing In of the crowd toward the center of the large hall. The bridal party entered from the eastern end of the
Pavilion and came down the aisle formed between the crowd.
They were immediately preceded by two police sergeants, who opened the way for them. Next came the two
ushers, and then little Miss Rlbble, Kirby Butler and Master Harry Mangles, who acted as pages In attendance.
Rev. Frank S. Ford walked Just in front of the bride and groom, and he was immediately preceded by Miss Jen
nie Mason and her brother, Ralph Mason, who were the maid of honor and the best man.
When the bridal party had taken their places upon the stand the ceremony was performed, after which the"
happy couple received the congratulations of the immediate bridal party and then retired to a private room where
they held a short reception. Rev. Mr. Ford, after he had made the couple man and wife, saluted the bride with
a kiss, to the great delight of the crowd, who cheered until they were out of breath.
The couple were married in the same clothes which they will wear In the regions where they go to search for
gold. When it was necessary for the groom to place upon his bride's finger the ring, she had to remove her fur
gloves. Miller's costume consisted of boots, fur coat and cape, with pants of some heavy coarse material, while his
bride was clad in a thick brown skirt with an equally heavy jacket, and a fur-lined cape which covered her head.
She also wore leggins and heavy shoes. After the ceremony, when the crowd had thinned out somewhat, Mr. and
Mrs. Miller came down upon the main floor of the Pavilion and took In the exhibits and other things of Interest.
In addition to the outfit given them by the Emporium, they also received from the management of the Fair
the sum of $150 In cold cash to pay the expenses of their trip.
Mr. and Mrs. Miller seemed to be very happy, and expressed themselves as much pleased with the way the
ceremony was performed. The groom said that he and his bride expected to leave for Seattle at once, and from
there they would go by steamer to St. Michael, from which point they will make a start for the gold fields.
Both seemed hopeful of their future and to fully appreciate the dangers attendant upon their venture In the far
north.
To-night the chief feature will be the famous Martels of New York, In their daring bicycle riding feats.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY* FEBRUARY 9, 1898.
BURGLARS VISIT
A WAREHOUSE
Tried to Break Open a Safe Con
taining a Large Quantity
of Opium.
Failing to Get the Drug They Got
Drung on French Cognac
and Kirschwasser.
The Atlantic Bonded "Warehouse on the
southeast corner of Battery and Broad
way was entered by burglars some time
between the hour of closing last Satur
day and that of opening last Monday.
The burglars got on the roof of the
warehouse by passing through the ruins
of the Yates fire in the adjoining build
ing and cut a steel bar in a skylight. This
gave them admission and they had an
opportunity of looting the place at leis
ure. They appeared to have had a com
plete outfit of burglar's tools, and they
began work at the safe, which contained
several thousand dollars' worth of opium.
They succeeded in breaking off the knob
with a cold chisel, but were unable to
open the safe.
Having failed on opium they next
opened a case of cognac and a case of
klrochwasser. They took two bottles of
cognac and a bottle of kirsch, and it is
supposed that they became so drunk that
thpy forgot or were unable to take any
thing else.
They left the chisel and several other
burglar's tools behind them in their flight.
The police were at once notified, but up
to a late hour yesterday they had not
found any clew to the thieves.

Longing Gaze.
The Board of Regents yesterday
adopted the report of the committee
recommending that a commercial col
lege be established as one of the de
partments of the University of Cali
fornia. The measure was adopted
without a dissenting voice.
There was some oratory foreshadow
ing the great importance of the college
to the Pacific Coast, and, on motion of
Regent Arthur Rodgers, + ne president
of the university was directed to make
application to the President of the
United States that an engineer officer
of the United States navy be detailed
in accordance with the act of Congress
approved in 1879 to act as instructor in
the college.
It was the expressed Judgment of the
regents that the college would expand.
Numerous branches would be taught,
and among others that of iron-ship
building. In time diplomacy would be
taught. Mr. Rodgers explained that
the diplomacy in mind was that relat
ing to the duties of consuls, who were
really commercial agents of the Gov
ernment. Ultimately the consuls would
receive education fitting them for a
diplomatic career.
Regent Hallidie felt that the univer
sity had proceeded as far as practi
cable in military instruction, and the
field was now open for instruction that
would have an influence in the con
struction of the navy.
The future possibilities of the college
of commerce stimulated the eloquence
of Regent Foote. He believed that the
country was about to enter upon an era
of unexampled commercial expansion.
The time was opportune for the estab
lishment of the college, and he heartily
rejoiced that the grand, noble and ex
tensive policy had been adopted.
The report of the committee, which
received the unanimous commendation
of the board, authorizes the president
of the university to recommend some
suitable professor to direct the des
tinies of the new department.
The regents decided to invite some
distinguished educator from the East
to corue to Calif6rnia and deliver the
address at the commencement. The
educator who possesses the lung and
brain capacity sufficient to meet the ex
igencies of the commencement event
v ill be the guest of the regents. While
here in the State as the guest of the
board he will be sized up on the quiet
as to his usefulness as a permanent
acquisition to the faculty.
A plan of exchange of talent with the
University of Chicago was suggested,
wherein it was proposed that Professor
Moses should go to Chicago on a six
months' lecturing tour and Professor
Miller of the Windy City should come
here and shower learning on the stu
dents in the university at Berkeley.
The plan would have prevailed had not
Regent Marye began to inquire wheth
er Miller matched Moses in intellectual
merit and college prestige. Mr. Marye
observed that the suggestion for ex
change emanated from Chicago, hence
the suspicion that the Chicago disci
ples of knowledge were trying to palm
off a second rater in exchange for
Moses, our great light on political
science. The whole subject was re
ferred to a committee consisting of
John E. Budd, George T. Marye and
Arthur Rodgers.
Responsive to a resolution previously
Introduced by Regent Wallace, the
chief of the Fire Department submit
ted a report as to the dangers of fire in
the Mark Hopkins Institute. The re
port suggests many precautions, such
as the removal of a workshop from the
attic, the clearing away of rubbish in
the corners of the basement, and the
rearrangement of gas jets. The amount
of Insurance on the building is $176,000.
The policies are maintained by the San
Francisco Art Association. The sub
ject matter was referred to Judge Slack
and Arthur Rodgers.
A report from Lieutenant S. A. Clo
man, military instructor, on the dan
gers of fire at Berkeley, the scant sup
ply of water and the inadequate facili
ties for escaping from the upper stories
of the college buildings in the event of
fire was discussed. His recommenda
tion that fire escapes be provided at
once was adopted.
Last December a conference of re
gents and professors agreed to recom
mend the adoption of this resolution:
Resolved, That such additions be made
to the courses of biology and chemistry
as will render the preparatory course to
the medical college complete and efficient
and that the courses elven be on the
same basis as those of other departments,
with a view to placing the medical col
lege on a high plane.
When the resolution was submitted
to the board for approval. Regent Rod
gers advised against haste. He re
marked: "This involves the payment
of salaries to the professors in the med
ical college."
The subject was referred to a com
mittee consisting of Regents Rodgers,
Relnstein, Hallidle, J. E. Budd, Chase
and President Kellogg.
Instructor Maybeck's leave of ab
sence was extended to November, 1898.
The regents authorized the purchase
of eighty acres of land on Mt. Hamil
ton, adjoining the observatory reser
vation. The cost does not exceed $000.
There were two sessions of the board
yesterday and Regent Phelps presided
at both. Governor Budd attended the
morning session, but did not partici
pate in the discussions. If he noted the
absence of Judge Waymire, he did not
call the regents' attention to the fact.

HOME FROM SOUTHERN SEAS.
After Eight Months of Successful
Research the Rothschilcrfteien-
tific Expedition Returns.
C. M. Harris, G. B. Hull, F B. Droune
and R. H. Beck, the four scientists sent
out some eight months ago by the Frank
Blake Webster Company of Hyde Park,
Mass., to explore the island of Galapagos,
have returned to the city and are regis
tered at the Grand.
The party left here eight months ago
in the schooner Lila and Mattie, which
was fitted out by the above-mentioned
firm, acting as agents for Baron Roths
child, who is an enthusiastic naturalist
and 'who financially backed the expedi
tion.
The vessel went directly from here to
Galapagos Island, where some time was
spent in scientific research, and from
there a trip was made through nearly the
whole of the South Sea group.
The undertaking was an entlrÂ» success
and many valuable discoveries were
made, which will prove of great interest
to the world of naturalists. The party
are loaded down with curiosities and
sppcimens collected during their travels,
which they propose to make the subjects
of future study, after which they will be
shipped across the Atlantic to the Roths
child home in England.

TOBACCO DUTIES.
Begulations for Wrapper and Filler
and Regarding the Disposition
of Damaged Goods.
The Treasury Department has .lecided
that tobacco imported and described in
invoice as "filler," but found to be
"wrapper," and exported in order tv
avoid payment of higher duty and after
ward reimported, must be identified by a
record of bale numbers, etc.
The Government has no right to pro
hibit the reexportation of tobacco er
roneously described in invoice, and .such
erroneous description is not a fraudulent
evasion of paragraph 214 of the act of
July 24, 1897.
Tobacco manufactured in bonded manu
facturing warehouse, laden on board a
vessel for exportation and damaged by
burning of vessel and submersion in
water may be destroyed and export bond
canceled, as no portion of such tobacco
would enter into consumption in the
United States.

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at station Indicate maximum temperature
for the days; those underneath it, if any, the
amount of rainfall, of melted snow in Inches
end hundredths during the past twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure: isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and Is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure la high In the Interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when th^ "low" is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is im
frobable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
daho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather; may be expected
In summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Feb. 1 The stock market sue- |
â  cumbed to the. Cuban scare to-day in spite of |
â¢ London's Indifference to the fears reflected by |
the New York exchange of a rupture between |
the United States and Spain. The ,. strength '
of American securities in London was partly i
accounted for by the process of the periodical â 
settlement of accounts on that exchange, j
Prices were bid up sharply there before the
opening here and resulted .In a sympathetic
rise in International security at the opening.
Not only was this the case, but when heavi- j
ness developed here London was a liberal buyer :
at the decline and was a very important factor j
In sustaining prices during the forenoon ses- I
elon. Americans were in demand in othor for- '
eign bourses and from Frankfort comes the j
report that they were the features and the
sustaining force of the market. Denver and
Rio Grande â  preferred was , the favorite with '
London and it. was able to hold a substantial !
gain to the clone, a conspicuous exception in i
this respect. Early weakness developed in the i
â  Union Pacific stocks and Norfolk and West- I
crn preferred was keenly affected by profit tak- i
ing-. The early weakness of the market had
been to a. large extent caused by the strength
'in special stocks when the news was received i
of the resolutions proposing- Intervention in !
.Cuba which were introduced . in the Senate. !
This broke the market in the final hour and j
resulted in the most severe shaking out since |
the Maine was sent to Havana. The covering :
of shorts made but a feeble rally and there was
a disposition to liquidate before the close.
The money market weakened appreciably to
day, call loans being made ' at" 1 per cent. Do
mestic exchange at some interior points have i
turned sharply against New York and the ]
withdrawal of the additional 10 per cent install- i
ment cf the Government deposits of the Union
Pacific payment 13 due to-morrow. But these. I
i factors were unavailing "to hold the money

London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here are quiet during the progress of
th* settlement, which shows a larger account ;
than expected, notably in Americans, where i
the contangoes are 4 to 5 per cent. They would
be higher but for the comparative scarcity of i
stocks. After a distinctly firm tone during the ;
day Americans and Grand Trunks closed under ;
the best. Argentines were lower on the rise
in the gold premium. Money In India Is get- !
ting very tight again, owing to the movement ]
of the crops. 'â *Â.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHrCAOO. Feb. B.â Wheat was lower at the
start, May opening at 94-Sc aÂ» compared with
yesterday's closing prioa of H%c li-.-y.md the
heaviness of the Northwest receipts there was
nothing particularly striking In the early
news, but the continued heavy arrival at tho
big receiving points was sufficient to cause
weakness at the start, though no selling of
consequence was done. Soon after the open
ing quite a good demand developed and from
a condition of dullness the market took on
quite a degree of activity. Shorts covered quite
freely and the \ May I price advanced to 96V4c.
There was some /attempt ; to break the mar
ket at that point and with some degree of
success, the price being forced ; back to 94% c,
but it quickly rebounded 'again to Kite. : There
it hung for a while. Moderate purchases for
foreign account were reported -by New .York
and private cables stated . that millers 'were
good buyers," especially of near-by deliveries,
and that stocks were decreasing rapidly. As
Liverpool .stocks ' are already - exceptionally
small, this had considerable effect. It was re
ported that Letter 3old in â  Liverpool yesterday
400,000 bushels of spring: wheat, which ho had
taken in exchange for May wheat in New York
at 15 cents less than the cash price. Mr. Leiter
would neither affirm i nor deny the report.
Alter the noon hour the market again became
active. New York reported forty-three boat
loads there and at outports for export, and
when : these figures were posted : there was a
general rush to buy. The market had . been
gradually creeping up, getting to !Â«5%c -before
the final crash came, but the demand I became
so urgent in the last few : minutes' '. trading
that 96U^96%c was reached. , The market
closed strong at 9CV4c. .; . .~<.
â  Cora was moderately active and firm. May
closed %c higher. â¢ â  â â â -
Oats were slow and , easy at the start, but
soon became firm and remained so. â  May closed

There was some weakness jin . provisions at
the start. Weak yard prices caused , moderate
.Belling. and the market receded somewhat, but
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1898.
at the decline there was a very good demand.
This and the strength of other markets caused
a gradual advance, the market closing linn
at about outside figures. May pork closed "4c
higher: May lard closed "Vie higher, and May
ribs unchanged.

GEO. M. PULLMAN
Allecjed Communication
From the Spirit of the
Millionaire.
Says He Is Sorry He Devoted
So Much Time to Getting
Money.
Glad the Inheritance of His Sons WÂ«s
Pruned to Such an Ex
tent.
Special Dispatch *- The CaM.
MEDINA, N. V.. Feb. B.â A man who
was an acquaintance of George M.
Pullman in the days when the great
palace car king was moving buildings
in this county, and who is now a prom
inent resident of this place, has recent
ly been 'investigating the mysteries of
spiritualism, and to-day he made pub
lic a copy of what he believes to be
an authentic message from Mr. Pull
man and which he says the spirit of
the dead millionaire authorized him to
give to the world. The message tran
scribed is fully 1000 wÂ»fds long. The
communication, after stating that Pull
man finds himself greatly hampered by
the worldly life which he has left, says
he bemoans that the tenor of his life
should have been so taken up with
money-getting.
"The books were opened for me at
once," he says, "and my past life was
shown to me, and the sight was not
cheering. I meant always to deal just
ly and fairly by my fellow men. par
ticularly the laboring man. I wished to
be an example for others. I see my
self now selfish, grasping, a holder of
what should have been for many."
Continuing, he describes something of
the spirit life so far as it has been
revealed tn him. and believes himself
preatly assisted by the first opportun
ity of communicating with the earth.
"It Is a source of great satisfaction to
me," he continues, "that th^ wisdom
was given me to take the action I did
respecting my sons" inheritance.
Would it not have applied equally to
my daughters? According to my rap
idly reconstructing ideas it would. Be- j
lleve me your friend.
"OEORGB M. ri'LLMAX."
This is a brief condensation of the j
document which has created a sensa
tfon among spiritualists and others.
The gentleman who received it says it
has all the indications of having been
Inspired by the spirit of Pullman him
self. It is full of contriteness and depre- ;
cation of the life of wealth as a hind
ra.nce to development in the after life. '
SAVED FROM LYNCHERS
BY A SHERIFF`S CAUTION.
Murderer Storms Transferred to An
other Prison in Time to
Elude a Mob.
BFRLIXGTOX. lowa. Feb. B.â Two
thousand men surrounded the Jail to- ]
night and demanded the delivery of A. D.
Storms, the murderer of Mrs. Rathburn
and daughter, that he might have meted '
out to him the justice prescribed by
Judge Lynch's code. The Sheriff, for
tunately for Storms, had been warned
and had succeeded in smuggling the
Intended victim of the mob to a place of
safety before the jail was surrounded.
The mob started from the southern part
of town, where a meeting was held by the
leaders for the purpose of organizing a
lynching party. A man with a rope start
ed down the street waving the rope and
calling to the crowd to follow him to the
jail, where Storms and his accomplice,
< '"x. and a number of other prisoners
were kept. The man had scarcely moved
a block down the street before he was the
leader of 500 shouting, yelling and cursing
men and boys.
Whea the crowd reached the jail, some
blocks north of the business part of the
city, its numbers had increased to luOQ or
2000. and hundreds of citizensâ men,
women and childrenâ flocked to the scene,
and were excited spectators of the events
which followed. The would-be lynchers
rushed up the slight incline to the front of
the jail, where they were met at the door
by Sheriff Smith and two or three depu
ties, who stopped them and demanded
their business. They demanded Storms.
The Sheriff, shouting at the top of his j
voice above the tumult, was heard to say |
that the prisoner had been removed an :
hour before and was on the train en route
for a neighboring city.
At a late hour a large crowd still sur- I
rounded the county Jail, but ft was gen- I
erally believed that Storms was not there, J
as several thorough searches had been
made, even the cupola and roof of the
building being carefully scanned by men
"with lanterns.
REV. HARRIS TO
BECOME AN ACTOR.
Abandons the Pulpit for a Career
on the Vaudeville Stage.
NEW YORK, Fob. B.â Rev. James H.
W. Harris, who says he Is a fully or
dained minister of the Episcopal church
late at San Francisco, will make his de
but in vaudeville at one of Proctor's
houses during the last of February, ap
pearing in a one-act burlesque by Charles
Ross of Robs and Fentor., entitled "An
tony and Cleopatra." Rev. Harris has en
gaged Miss Helene Richmond as his sup
porting lady. Miss Richmond will play
Cleopatra.
"I have decided to go on the stag-e,"
said Rev. Harris to-day, "because my
natural instincts tend In that direction
and because this is a free country- I a.m
a free-born American citizen and have a
right to do as I please withouc asking:
permission of any one.
"I anticipate that something of a sensa
tion will follow my appearance, as I am
still connected with the church, and do
not propose to relinquish that connection
at present. I came East to go on tha
stage. I have piayed In amateur theat
ricals in San Francisco, but, so far aa I
know, my appearance on the stage there
was not seriously disapproved by the
church. I suppose that when 1 go on in
vaudeville the church will think I am
scandalizing it. But it is nothing of the
kind. I have the courage of my own con
victions. I like the stage, and I can make
more money on the stage than by preach
ing. So I propose to make the stage my
vocation in the future, provided I can
make It a success."

FINDS HIS DAUGHTER
IN THE ALMSHOUSE.
Shocking Discovery Made by John
Benders of California at Pem
berton N. J.
NEW YORK, Feb. S.â John Benders of
California visited Pembertnn, N. J., yes
terday to find his daughter Elizabeth, a
young woman of 27. an inmate of the
county almshouse. The circumstances
which led to her becoming a county
charge are pitiful. The Benders origin
ally came from California, but when 12
years of age be worked his way across
the continent to Pemberton. When he
was 19 years of age he married Helen
Fonts a well-known young woman of
berton. They had one childâEliza
beth now the young woman found tn the
almshouse. Benders left his home and
took a trip around the world, finally going
to the West, where be invested what
little money he had saved, and became
rich. Then' he decided to come to Pem
berton to see if any of his boyhood com
panions were in the vicinity. While in
Pemberton he learned of Elizabeth Bend
ers being in the almshouse, and visiting
that institution discovered that the ftar
that she was his daughter was true.
There was a sad but happy reunion, and
now the young woman will return with
her father to California.
HORACE BOIES
FOR A NEW POLICY.
Realizes That It Is Time for Demo
crats to Abandon the Finan
cial Plank of '96.
FAIRFIEI.D, lowa, Feb. S.âEx-Gover
nor Horace Boles made an address on the
financial question here to-night. It was
his first utterance on the subject since
the publication of the widely quoted let
ters in which he denied the sacred and
irrevocable nature of party platforms and
insisted that the battle for free coinage
of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 having
been fought under the most favorable
circumstances and the demand defeated
at the polls, the Democratic party should
abandon the financial plank of IS% and
endeavor to rally on new ground. His

which ho thinks ail Democrats should be
able to agree.
WHITES OF SAVANNAH
ARE VERY INDIGNANT.
Appointment of a Colored Man as
Collector of the Port Causes
a Protest.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 8.-A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: President
McKinley has aroused the greatest in
dignation among white citizens of Sa
vannah by appointing a negro politician,
John H. Deveaux, Collector of Customs
at the port of Savannah. As soon as the
fact of Deveaux's appointment was tele
graphed to Savannah Georgia's Senators
and Collector Lester were deluged with
telegrams protesting against his confir
mation and urging the Georgia delegation
to join the request for the President to
recall the nomination. So bitter is the
feeling in Savannah that threats of vio
lence arc heard should Deveaux be con
firmed and attempt to assume the duties
of office. An effort will he made to pre
vent the confirmation of Deveaux, but the
outlook in that direction is not favorable,
for it is admitted the only objection to
the new Collector 1b his color.

OBJECTION TO
DEATH CURVES
Ex-Mayor Davie Renews
the Harrison-Street
Fight.
Southern Pacific Anxious to
Be Given a Short
Franchise.
The Council Is Not Inclined to Act
Hastily Over the
Matter.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Feb. 8.
There is likely to be a keen fight be
fore the Council before the franchise
asked for by the railroad to cross from
Webster to Harrison street, along
First, is granted.
Ex-Mayor Davie is interested in the
I matter; so is "Old Pard" Bassett, and
'so is Mr. Heitman. Councilman Wat
kinson, who was yardmaster of the
j Southern Pacific up to the time of the
! strike, and who has not yet been rein
' stated, is also very much worked up !
! over the possibility that the railroad I
; company may establish a "death j
i curve" at First and Harrison streets.
There is no time to be lost in this |
matter, for the War Department has j
issued orders that the new bridge at
Harrison street must be constructed i
â  not later than July of this year. The j
plans of the railroad company have !
been accepted at Washington, and the
company is now ready to build, but re
quires a franchise in order to change
its route from Webster street to get to j
the approach to the new bridge.
The plan of the proposed route filed |
by the company with the City Council
shows that they have purchased the
block of land bounded by Webster,
Harrison, First an 1 Second streets, and !
the proposed curve will go across this
block, which will necessitate its cross
ing sidewalks in the middle of the \
block at two places. It is this section
; of the track which is being vigorously
opposed, it being claimed that it will
be a more fatal curve as thj harbor de- â 
. velops than the deathly curve now ex- j
isting at Seventh and West streets.
The petition asks for a franchise ;
' down Harrison street, south of First;
i this is the identical spot opened by
Mayor Davie two years ago when he
; was stopped by an injunction which
is still in force, and which infers that
the land, is private property. Now
comes Mr. Davie and asks the railroad
company how they can consistently ask
i the city to give them a franchise over j
; the very parcel of land which two j
years ago they declared was private j
property and to retain which a suit is
' still pending against Mr. Davie and
others, including the city of Oakland.
This is the situation in brief with which
the Council has t<> deal at its meeting i
one week from next Monday night.
MANSON'S MORAL.
He Tells Wliy Good Roads Are Good

An Instructive lecture was delivered last :

Marsden Manson. the well-known civil en
gineer, and president of the Department
of Highways of the State of California.
The lecture was given under the aus
PRETTY ACTOR MEN DISAGREE.
Alcazar "Hero" and "Villain" Almost Come to
Blows Over a Bunch of Violets.
It all came about owing to a bunch of violets, nnd only the natural mod
esty of William Pascoe, actor, prevented the spilling of good, bright, theatri
cal blood.
Wright Huntington and William Pascoe grace the boards of the Alcazar
Theater, and each has his individual following of adoring matinee girls.
Both men are considered, by those capable to judge, handsome fellows.
Huntingdon is blonde and sports a tantalizing gold mustache, and Pascoe is
dark and parts his hair geometrically in the middle.
Huntington is married, and Pascoe, though single, is extremely modest,
so the charms of both these players are about equally divided.
Previous to Saturday the men, though conscious of their superior attrac
tions, were the best of friends. Then for two dark and awful hours the at
mosphere was filled with ungodly words and dreadful, revengeful threats.
However, finally, good sense prevailed and the pair of Adonises burled their
differences in the cup that cheers, but, unfortunately, inebriates.
It all happened at the matinee. Every stage box was filled with gushing,
big-hatted matinee girls, and at the end of the second act they grew so en
thusiastic that they snatched their corsage bouquets and one by one flung
them at the actor which they adored.
Pascoe and Huntington were on the stage. Pascoe had his "villain" sneer
with him, and Huntington his melting "good man" look. Pascoe picked up
six of the floral offerings and Huntington seven. Then the handsome men
looked daggers at each other and carried their grievances behind the
scenes.
During the remainder of the play rumors of war were rife in the wings.
After the play, both men attired in their Saturday best, exchanged words in
front of the theater.
The men measured each other with coldly critical eyes. Both are big
fellows, and both had on pretty clothes. Their friends came along and ap
pealed to Pascoe's well-known modesty. The modest-man sense of the gen
tlemanly fitness of things finally prevailed, and Huntington, Pascoe & Co.
adjourned to where the white-coated brother of the barrel and faucet reigns
supreme. In the meantime, Jhe management has arranged for several blue
coated preservers of the peace to be on hand at the coming matinee.
pices of the Farmers' Club of San Fran
cisco, and the object was the enlighten
ment of the general public regarding the
best manner of constructing roads and
highways and the great value of their
proper construction.
The lecture was illustrated by stereop
tlcon views of many roads, taken by Mr.
Manson himself during his travels
through Russia, France, Italy, Siberia
and different States in America. Atten
tion was called to the condition oi the
streets of San Francisco as compared to
those of other cities, and the necessity of
taking the control of our public highways
out of the hands of politicians. It was
claimed that California has many natural
advantages, which, by the building of
proper roads, will open up sections far
grander than those of Italy or Switzer
land, which annuallly attract hundreds
of thousands of tourists, who come for
the sole purpose of viewing the scenery,
wnich the splendid highways permit.
The lecture was well attended by an In
terested audience.

An Aged Grocer Ends His Existence
by Turning on the Gas.
E. J. Swordstream, an aged grocer
and saloonkeeper who ran a busi

something wrong examined the place,
found the. door unlocked and the propri

CONSOLIDATED
GOVERNMENT
Strong Opposition Mani
fested by Alameda and
Berkeley.
City Auditor Snow Outlines
the Territory and Rate
of Taxation.
Alameda Expects to Pay All Running
Expenses by Income From
the Public.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 8.
The opening meeting of the Board of
Trade to discuss the advisability of a
consolidated government was largely
attended. Alameda and Berkeley were
represented by leading citizens, none
of whom gave the Oaklanders any
hopes of ever seeing their hopes cher
ished. It was decided to have a com
mittee of three appointed to prepare
figures and gather information and
place the same in form to be distrib
uted throughout the territory affected.
The secretary had been unable to se
cure the City Attorney's opinion as to
how r to proceed in the matter of form
ing a city and county government. M.
J. Keller stated that he did not believe
the question of modus operand! was as
much the question to be discussed as
whether tha cities are ready to consol
idate.at this time. City Auditor R. W.
Snow gave the following estimate of
the cost of a consolidated government.
He said:
My figures are based on the following
terms: First, that the county of Ala
meda will be divided at San Leandro
Creek and a city and county formed of
all the northwestern portion; second, that
the form of government adopted will not
materially differ from the governments of
other combined cities and counties; third,
that the valuation of property for the
purposes of taxation will be the same as
that iixed last year by the County As
sessor of this county; fourth, that the in
come other than taxes will be received
after the manner that now obtains in the
city of Oakland.
The estimated expense for such a ter
ritory under one government is: County
offices and schools, $005,000; city offices,
wharves, libraries and elections, $t>57,000;
total, $1,262,000; receipts from State taxes,
$375,000; income other than taxes, $362,000;
total, $737, 000; balance to be raised by tax
ation, $1,275,000; assessed valuation of new
city, $75,000,000; rate necessary to raise
$1,275,0u0, the amount required to be
raised, $1 70 on each $100 valuation of
property. On $1,000,000 at the present rate
of $2 12 the city, county and State taxes
will raise $21,200; at the rate of $1 70 on
the larger valuation, $17,000. The differ
ence in these is $4200 saved on each
$1,0u0,000. The rate of tax for bonds and
interest is not considered. If these were
considered the saving in the city would
be $250\) on each $1,000,000.
Cralgie Sharp spoke of the possibili
ties of the city under a consolidated
government. He was followed by V. S.
Northey of East Oakland, who favored
the consolidation.
C. A. Bailey of Berkeley declared that
the unanimity of spirit was the great
thing needed to make a great city. He
said Oakland wanted a reduction of
taxation, and would get it in a city and
county government, but what, he
asked, would Alameda and Berkeley
get. They had better streets, better
municipal buildings and more enter
prise than Oakland, hence they had
nothing to cause them to look upon the
scheme with any degree of acceptabil
ity. He did not expect that they would
want to come in.
City Clerk Ben F. Lamborn of Ala
meda said that in their city the taxa
tion was lesseÂ»ed by public utilities
rather than by consolidation. He de
clared that the day is not far distant
when the entire expenses of the city
government will be paid by the income
from their government utilities. He
thought that the city sent $50,000 all
over the world for premiums on insur
ance and $25,000 for a fire department,
making a total of $75,000 in fire protec
tion. He had been told to-day that if
they came into Oakland that these pre
miums would be increased. What for
he did not know, but he did know that
the city had no desire to give up what
they had.
E. W. Maslin of Alameda said: "The
best thing you can do is to move out
and let Alameda move in. There is no
use of wasting strength on a proposi
tion to consolidate. Do you believe that
the citizens of Alameda will vote to
come in when such facts are in exist
ence as have been produced here to
night? Your desire to form greater
Oakland is selfishness to throw taxa
tion on those you want to take in."
John T. Bell* deplored the words of
Mr. Bailey and declared in favor of
consolidation. He was followed by A. C.
Henry, who argued against the points
made by the speakers from Alameda
and Berkeley. Sol Kahn said the pres
ence of representatives from Alameda
foreshadowed success. Twelve years
ago they would have been impeached
by their constituents.
James Naismith favored forming
leagues, hiring attorneys to tell how to
act and going forward on the lines laid
down by them. Max Webber believed
a committee should be appointed to go
to work. L. N. Hagar said he had
worked thirty years for annexation and
now wanted to see consolidation. M. J.
Keller, W. E. Barnard and Fred Kahn
made remarks, after which adjourn
ment was taken until March 8, when all
interested, either in favor or against
the proposed consolidation are Invited
to be present.
FEAR ANOTHER FAMINE.
Berkeleyans Expect Disastrous Ef
fects of the Dry Season on
Their Water Supply.
BERKELEY, Feb. S.â Berkeleyans are
already becoming alarmed at the pros
pect of another water famine this year in
consequence of the present indications of
a dry year. W. G. Sanborn of North
Berkeley, who has thoroughly studied the
local water system, declares that even
with the recent rains the water In the
reservoirs of the Alameda Water Com
pany is very low and that unless some
additional source is secured, Berkeley
will have a worse scarcity of water dur
ing the summer and fall of IS9S than it
did last season.
"I think there is little doubt now,"
said Mr. Sanborn this evening, "that we
will have a dry season and a big water
famine, and Berkeley will not be the only
place to have trouble. It was supposed
that when the wet season arrived all the
trouble would be over, but the rains have
not been heavy enough. Berkeley gar
deners will soon want to irrigate, but
there will be no water with which to irri
gate. There will be no means of getting
sufficient water except from outside
The North Berkeley Improvement Club
at its meeting last night declared em
phatically in favor of adopting the meter
system and lixir.g water rates in Berkeley
at 25 cents per 1000 gallons, with a mini
mum rate of $1 per month.
To Fix Water Rates.
BERKELEY, Feb. B.â The Town Trus
tees of Berkeley held a special meeting
to-night to hear discussion in regard to
fixing the water rates for the coming
year. Representatives of the Alameda
Water Company asked for an increase in
the present rate, claiming that during
the past year they have actually supplied
the town at a loss. W. A. Sanborn, on
behalf of the North Berkeley Improve
ment Club, asked that the water com
pany be compelled to put meters in the
houses of all consumers, and that a rate
of 25 cents per 1000 gallons be fixed for
the coming year. The board will meet
next Tuesday evening to fix the rates
finally.

FAVORITES IN
WINNING FORM
First Choices Head Their
Fields Out on Four
Occasions.
A Straggling Start Nearly
Worked the Defeat of
Mainstay.
â Wawona Led Out the Heavily Pluyecl
Hazardâ Old Red Glann
Scored Again.
Aside from the win of four first
choices at Emeryville track yesterday,
the sport was marked by nothing
eventful. The attendance was a trifle
better than on the opening day of the
week, but there was still much room
for Improvement in the betting:. The
going was stiff and lumpy, and slow
time marked the running of the dif
ferent events decided.
Thorpe, Conley and Clawson divided
the riding honors between them, each
one of the trio piloting two winners
past the wire.
Bookmaker Hughey Jones who has
been out of the sunshine for some
time, nearly experienced a renewal of
his hard luck yesterday. With Mont
gomery scratched from the fourth
event, his big sprinter Mainstay looked
a "moral" and received extensive sup
port at the short price of 4to 5. Fer
guson gave him several lengths the
worst of the send-off, but Thorpe grad
ually threaded his way to the front,
and in a hard drive through the
stretch downed Midlight and Al Koran
over a length. The latter duo indulged
in a fierce duel for the place, in which
Midlight succeeded in getting the de
cision by n nose.
The opening five-furlong scramble
with a field of seventeen starting, de
veloped a warm thing in Tom Ryan's
Al. a son of Al Farrow. Backed clown
from two* to even money, he carried
away the barrier with him and won in
a walk from La Mascota, a 10 to 1
chance. Moringa another long priced
one, was third.
Sixteen platers lined up in the seven
furlong run next decided, with Alma
and Adam Andrew ruling equal choices
in the betting. The former was in
front almost from the first jump, win
ning easily at the wire from Miss Ruth,
a 60 to 1 shot. Adam Andrew, away
from the post very badly, took show
honors in a hard drive from Heritage.
The wise contingent was badly fooled
over the result of the mile and a six
teenth selling event. Hazard, with
Thorpe up, was hammered down from
8 to 5 to even money, and "Wawona,
against which 7 to 1 was laid, beat him
in a gallop. Perseus, which opened
favorite and backed up in the betting,
made the running to the stretch, where
he began to tire, ajid ended up in the
show. The winner was well ridden by
Clawson.
D. J. Daly's mare Distinction was an
overwhelming favorite for the second
five furlong dash, and, with Conley in
the saddle, led the big field out an easy
winner. Durward, a 100 to 1 shot, rid
den by a stable lad named Feighery,
came from the rear of the bunch, tak
ing the place from The heavily played
ML Roy.
The heavy going just suited old Red

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1898.
THE STATE BOARD
MAKES ITS REPLY
California Should Have an
Exhibit at the Omaha
Exposition.
But Many Necessary Conditions
Are First to Be Ful
filled.
The State Board of Trade of California
held quite a lengthy meeting yesterday
In the office of J. A. Fllcher, secretary of
the board, in the Mechanics' Pavilion. It
â was the monthly meeting of the board,
and in addition to the routine business
several matters of Importance were con
sidered. The question of California being
represented at the Trans-Misslssippl and
International Exposition, to be held at
Omaha from next June until November,
was thoroughly discussed.
In the absence of President N. P. Chip- j
man, J. S. Emery presided over the meet
ing, with the following members of the
board present: Colonel J. P. Irish,
Craigle Sharp, W. H. Mills, B. N. Row
ley, M. L. McDonald, E. YV. Maslin, C. F.
Montgomery, L. C. McAfee, C. M.
Worcester and N. W. Spaulding.
After the disposition of the routine
business the secretary read a communi
cation from T: H. Goodman, general
passenger agent of the Southern Pacific,
asking the board for a contribution of
$50 a month for five months to help de
fray the^expense of sending Miss Helen
Kelleher through the country with a
stereopticon show for advertising the
mineral and agricultural wealth of the
State. Miss Kelleher will conduct this
tour of lectures provided that $>.00 a
month can be raised to pay all necessary
expenses for the period of live months.
The board unanimously appropriated the
$50 a month for the requested period.
A. G. Freeman, representing the com
mittee appointed by the joint associa
tions, consisting of the Chamber of Com
merce, the Manufacturers' Association,
Merchants' Association. San Francisco
Board of Trade and other indus
trial and commercial organizations,
appeared before the board to inquire as
to what action they would take in the
matter of having the State represented
at the exposition to be held at Omaha.
Mr. Mills on the part of the board sub
mitted a report as to what the hoard in
its judgment thought best to be done.
The report was generally discussed and
unanimously adopted by the board, and
Mr. Freeman will report the same back
to the joint associations at their next
meeting.
It was the sense of the board that
$36,000 would be necessary to make a sat
isfactory and representative exhibit, and
that 10,000 feet of space would be re
quired. The finance and immigration
committees, with the president and two
members to be appointed by him, are' to
have charge of the disbursements of all
moneys appropriated for the exhibit.
It was still further the sense of the
board that anything less than an ade
quate display would be injurious rather
than beneficial to the State, and that
California should not be represented at
Omaha unless Its building materials, ca
pabilities of resources, agricultural, hor
ticultural and viticultural products, man
ufacturing industries, educational prog
ress, attractiveness of scenery, health
resorts and salubrity of climate could be
properly represented.
Craigie Sharp moved that the board
indorse M. H. do Young as the most
suitable person for the Commissionership
to Paris, to be appointed by the Presi
dent, but the motion was not carried.
He also offered a resolution that the
Governor of the State be requested to
extend an Invitation to the President and
the Secretary of Agriculture to visit
California as the guests of the State
Board of Trade. This resolution was
unanimously carried and the board
then adjourned.
Warehousing Bullion.
The Secretary of the Treasury has made
a ruling that bullion produced in bond
from imported ores and transported from
a bonded smc-iter for reiining need not be
weighed or assayed on entry for reware
housing, since the quantity to be charged
with duty on such entry must be equal in
every case to the quantity so charged on
the transportation entry, so that the
warehousing bond cannot be canceled
otherwise than on the exportation of or
payment of duty on 90 per cent of such
quantity.

MORE TROUBLE FOR
THE SCHOOL BOARD
Plan to Indict the Directors Collectively
Instead of Individually.
The Lease of the Lincoln School Property May Be
Made the Basis for the Adoption of
Such a Course.
Like the ball of snow that gathers
size as It rolls, the school scandal Is
enlarging, until now it has taken first
place In the minds of the grand jurors.
and even the misdoings of the Super
visors must stand aside while the work-
Ings of the school board are brought
Into the light.
The Jury will meet to-morrow and
the session was to have been devoted
to the charges brought against Super
visor Delany and others, but It has
been determined that the time shall be
employed in drawing up the indict
ment against Samuel L. Waller, found
last Monday night, and in delving fur
ther into the surrounding circum
stances.
The investigation is very likely to
cause surprise, for it is probable that
the Jury will take a new method of set- |
ting matters straight. It has come to j
be the opinion that to Indict a single J
member of the board seldom leads to !
any result except a superficial exam- i
lnation in the courts and the final dis- j
charge of the accused, and there is a
sentiment in the jury that there is a
better way than that. The idea is to
indict the board as a whole â not the
members as individuals, but the direo- |
tors as a board â and then bring the j
case up in the courts In that shape. If
the members be put on trial all togeth
er it is certain that those not concern
ed in crookedness will not allow them
selves to be made to pull from the legal
fire the chestnuts of the guilty, and as
a consequence some definite result is
more likely to follow. This plan will
come before the jury and there is every
probability that it will be adopted.
Some question is necessary, however,
which can 6erve as a basis for a rharge
against the board as a whole. ;iti<l this
THE WATER RATES
ARE NOW TOO HIGH
Reservoirs of the Company
Should Contain a Supply Suf=
flcient for Three Years.
Money Has Been Collected From Rate=Payers
to Build Pumping Works and Provide
Adequate Storage.
The Spring Valley Water Works,
through its president, Charles Webb
Howard, sends this petition to the
Board of Supervisors, asking that the
old rates heretofore established for the
year commencing July 1, 1895, be re
stored:
SAX FRANCISCO, Feb. 7. IS9B.
To the Honorable Board of Supervisors of the
City and County of San Francisco:
The Spring Valley Water WorkÃ respectfully
represent that to the present date the condi
tions as to rainfall and catchment of water
therefrom have been such that no water what
ever has been added to the storage supply
of the company In Its reservoirs: that all In
dications point to what Is usually termed a
"dry winter"; that the present and probable
situation In this behalf has compelled and
â will compel the company to make large ex
penditures in way of new works and machin
ery, and to resort almost constantly to the
pumping of water to Insure a safe and ade-'
Quate supply for the consumption of the city
and Us Inhabitants, and for an adequate fire
protection during the coming year; that such
pumping and new works have, for the reasons
stated, become positive necessaries, and are
now being construrte.l. one plant at Crystal
Springs and one at Mlllbrae, besides the plant
lately built and now running at San Andreas
reservoir; that thereby wi'hout any compen
sating increase in our revenue the operating
expenses of the company are largely Increased
and Its Interest account upon the capital in
vested made greater: that the estimated cost
of such new and absolutely necessary works
and machinery is the sum of $670,000, or more,
and the extra and unusual cost of pumping for
the year will be about $S0,000; and that besides
these amounts a new forty-four Inch pipe was
necessary <laid from San Andreas in place of a
thirty inch pipe), at a cost of about J2SMX 11 * 1 :
that the present rates were established on the
basis of the works In use before thene extra
expenditures for construction and maintenance
had been incurred, at a time when the fratar
supplied by pumping, as compared with gravi
tation, was proportionately small; that such
basis for the coming year is not fair or equltn
ble. and will not produce to the company suf
ficient revenue to Justly compensate it for the
service, or to permit it to incur the extra in
terest on this and other new construction and
the extra operating expenses demanded by the
circumstances In it? duty to the public; but
that without such additional and extraordinary
expenses for new works and machinery, and
without such pumping and the consequent In
crease of operating expenses, the supply of
water, the storage of which has been largely
reduced by the wasteful use during the past
year, will of necessity be limited and insuffi
cient the ensuing season.
Therefore, the undersigned represents that
the present rates work Injustice to the com
pany and will Impair its ability to render such
efficient, prudent and full sen-ice, as !n the
past, and hereby petitions your honorable
board, by proper proceedings, to restore the
rates heretofore established for the year com
mencing July 1. 1595.
SPRING VALLEY WATER WORKS,
By Charles Webb Howard. President.
This is the old, old story. The rate
payers, after paying for thirty years
or more the interest on bonds and all
the vast sums of money which have
enabled the corporation to pay divi
dends on its stock, are now asked to
come forward again and pay for more
machinery and pumping works and
the cost of pumping. Going back as
far as ISB6, when Washington Bartlett
was Mayor, one can find definite and
interesting figures. Solon Pattee. the
expert, then reported that the com
pany had up to that time expended
511,000.000 In dividends and had collect
ed more than $22,000,000 in water rates.
An accurate statement of dividends
paid to date would startle the public.
The amount of money that the com
pany has collected on water rates,
added to the amount obtained by the
will probably be found In the recent
lease of the Lincoln School property, on
Fifth and Market streets, a transac
tion which has already attracted the
attention, but unofficially, of several of
the jurors.
The lease was made at the beginning
of this year and to a syndicate known,
not very widely, as the Real Estate In
vestment Company. This syndicate
has agreed to pay the city $4000 a
month for the property, that being the
highest offered in the competition. It
is denied by the School Directors and
by members of the syndicate that there
are any of the Directors interested in the
concern, but In spite of this the lease
will be the subject of much investiga
tion, for it was declared at the time the
board took action that the property
could never pay that Income and leave
any margin for profit. At any rate the
effect of the bid Is being felt by the
tenants, who are up in arms over the
way they are being treated.
* They have all been notified that on
March 1 the rent will be raised, in some
cases $25. In others $50, and in others
$100; in one case, that of the Palace Sa
loon, the rent has been raised $140. The
rents now in existence for that block
are fully up to the standard of rents
for that section and that side ut Mar
ket street, and the tenants are of the
opinion that there is some scheme to
have them out of the place to make
room for others more favored. That
many of them will move out Is a cer
tainty: they are outspoken in the mat
ter and several have declared they can
not stand any such raise as has been
put upon them.
Then, too, there are contracts to be
let for the improving of the property,
and these are being given to contract
hydrant scheme to make the city bear
part of the burden, would exceed $30,
000,000. Before the Supervisors should
think of allowing an increase of rates,
figures should be obtained by an ex
pert to show the gross amount of
money collected from the people, to
gether with the amount paid in divi
dends on the stock of the corporation
and the amount disbursed to pay inter
est on the bonds.
When Mayor Bartlett presented his
figures the cost of construction to that
time was $8,000,000.
In February, 1890, when E. B. Pond
was Mayor, A. W. yon Schmidt pre
sented figures showing that the cost of
the works up to that time was $9,784,941.
! Subsequently he produced memoranda,
obtained from Herman Schussler, chief
engineer of the corporation, which
j brought the total cost of the works up
Ito $13,642,000. This included the big
| Crystal Springs dam and the Alameda
l pipe line.
The people of San Francisco are now
staggering under a burden of rates
that permits the water company to pay
interest on a sum of $22,000,000.
The remarkable feature of the whole
transaction is that the people have
paid for all the permanent improve
ments â for everything in sight and out
of sight â and now are called upon to
pay interest on money collected from
themselves and. disbursed by the com
pany.
When the value' of the corporation's
property was figured up to be $20,000,000
the rate payers were told that exten
sive permanent improvements had been
made to insure the city against the
danger of water famine and to provide
an adequate supply of water to extin
guish great fires. The great dam near
San Mateo, the wonder of the world as
a reservoir, was heralded as the stor
age supply that would carry San
Francisco over three dry seasons. The
works are magnificent, but the rate
payers put up the money for the con
struction and have since paid the in
terest on the amount. they invested.
The company has not encountered a
dry season since the big works were
constructed. The rainfall for the sea
son ending July 1, 1897, was a fraction
above the normal twenty-three inches.
The season's rainfall to date is a shade
less than six inches, .with twenty days
of February and all of March and April
to come. The water company is asking
an increase of rates on the apprehen
sion of a scarcity of water.
Time and again, the public was as
sured that extraordinary disbursements
by the company were made to guaran
tee a three years' supply. Figures were
produced to show that the peninsular
area controlled by the company would
for forty years be sufficient for the sup
ply of San Francisco. Great stress was
placed on this point when the proposi
tion to bring water from Lake Tahoe
was under discussion.
The remarkable petition of the water
corporation at this time should not de
ceive the Board of Supervisors. It wfll
be time enough after two dry seasons
have passed to go to the rescue of the
Spring Valley Water Works. Meanwhile
THE SAX FRASTCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1898.
ors who have friends on the board, al
though It is still denied that the board
has anything to do with the lease.
The old book scandal is also food for
more discussion by the Jurors, and it
is not improbable that the records of
some of the Directors during that trou
ble will be once more looked over for
material to base a collective indict
ment upon. There were several worried
faces in the departmnet when that
scandal was In process of publication,
and there Is still more than one point
unexplained.
The school contracts will also be
made to bear the fullest investigation,
and symptoms of more trouble to fol
low are pronounced. The latest instance
is the contract for tinting and varnish
ing the Interior of the Girls' High
School, let to Scott & Wilkinson for $398
on June 30 last.
Scott took the Job and worked on it
for several days until nearly finished,
when one morning he found other men
at work, and he learned that another
man was to "help" him. He declined
help and demanded that he be allowed
to finish the Job unaided. He was told
it was all the same, he would get his
money, and so it did not matter, but as
he still persisted his tools were taken
from him and he was told they would
be sold if he raised any trouble.
Scott Bays his work was stopped by
Thomas Burns of the Buildings and
Grounds Committee; Thomas Welsh,
architect, and J. J. O'Brien, inspector.
They told him they wanted to put an
other contractor on the Job. Scott dis
creetly declined to say if the other man
had been paid for the work he had
done or if he knew if the contract had
been doubled up. He would only say
that so far as his pay went that was all
right.
the corporation should spend some of
its own money to improve the plant
a.d increase the supply.
FIFTY YEARS MAN AND WIFE.
Celebration of the Golden Wedding
of Mr. and Mrs. Henry
Axton.
The golden wedding of Mr. and Mrs.
Henry Axton was celebrated In a most
auspicious manner last nipht at their
residence, 721 Franklin street.
It would be hard to imagine a happier
scene than that in which the husband
and wife of Zuty years' wedlock formed
the central figures, surrounded by their
children and the many warm friends who
had come to honor the bride and eroom.
On Tuesday, February 18, IS4S, Mr. Ax
ton married a beautiful maiden. Miss
Esther Curl Sweasey, In the village of
New Harmony, Ind. Two years later the
young couple crossed the plains in a
"prairie schooner," with a large party of
emigrants, bound for California. They
arrived at Weaverville in October of 1850,
the husband trying his hand at mining in
that section. Three months of this con
vinced him that a miner's life was not to
his liking, so he concluded to come to San
Francisco, where he engaged in the dairy
ing business for the next live years. Then
he bought a large stock ranch in Hum
boldt County, on which he and his family
resided until about five years ago, when
they returned to San Francisco and set
tled in the home they now occupy.
The Axtons, man and wife, are held In
the highest esteem by all who know them,
and last night's celebration was all the
more enjoyable from the fact that the
congratulations ana good wishes show
ered upon the loving and tÂ°loved bride
and groom were sincere in the last de
gree.
HEAVY-WEIGHT TROUBLES.
Choynski and Sharkey Signed to
Fight in This City Next Month.
Tom Sharkey and Joe Choynski, the
heavy-weight pugilists, signed articles
last evening to fight twenty rounds be
fore the National Athletic Club on the
evening of March 10.
The pugilists agreed to divide 60 -^r
! cent of the gross receipts, the winner .o
I take 75 per cent and the loser 25 per cent.
They aJso agreed to break away "like

The referee will be selected twenty-four
hours before the fight. Each fighter will
deposit $500 to-day as a guarantee that he
will appear in the ring on the evening
selected for the contest, in good physical
condition, and the club will deposit a like
sum that it will fulfill its obligations
Sharkey will train at the ocean beach
and Choynski will do his indoor exercise
in the Olympic Club.
i Billy Kennedy, superintendent of the
; Olympic Club, telegraphed Corbett and
j Fitzsimmons yesterday that if they are
j really anxious for a second contest
the Olympic Club was prepared to "pull
off" the fight in this city, and that it
would allow them any purse within rea
son. Of course Corbett wijl accept this
offer, but Fitzsimmons will not give it
any attention, as he has positively stated
that he will not fight again. Corbett an
nounced his retirement from the ring a
few days ago, but artful James does
funny things sometimes for effect.
Charged With Grand Larceny.
George C. Marks, an electrician, was
booked at the City Prison yesterday by
Detective Cody on a charge of grand
larceny. The complaining witness is Ben
C. Wing, a salesman in the Emporium

THE HARBOR BOARD
Sensational Testimony Ready
as to Jobbery Conducted
by the Chairman.
Why Lumber Merchant D. H. Bibb Was
Daringly Boycotted by the Colnon
Conspiracy.
When the caÃe of the Parafflne
Paint Company vs. the Harbor
Commission is called this morn-
Ing, Attorney Matt Sullivan will
spring a surprise upon the oppo
site side, and in so doing will ex
pose one of the blackest scandals
that has ever been attached to a
State office. The expose will be
made by the testimony of D. H.
Bibb, the well-known member of
the D. H. Bibb Lumber Com
pany, having their offices on the
corner of Pine and Sansome
streets.
Mr. Bibb was subpenaed late
yesterday, and his apearance on
the witness-stand is anything
but voluntary. Not that he is In
any way Implicated, but the
dirty mess has already been laid
before Governor Budd, and Mr.
Bibb believed that there his
duty to the public ended. %
The scandal dates back a year
and a half, and had it not been
for the present case it might
have been buried forever.
When Mr. Bibb takes the witness
stand to-day he will testify to the
following story of attempted boodling
and malfeasance in office:
Eighteen months ago a Harbor Com
missioner went to Bibb and asked him
if he would like to furnish lumber to
the commission. Of course, Mr. Bibb
answered in the affirmative, for it is
well known that the patronage of this
State department iB a snug little busi
ness of itself.
"Well," said Commissioner Colnon,
"I will see that you get it. I don't
think that it will be very difficult."
After a little further conversation
MEETING OF THE THREE CS II<J COURT.
the two parted. In a short time Wil
liam Inglis. whose father Is on Com
missioner Colnon's bond, appeared be
fore Mr. Bibb. Inglis was formerly in
the lumber business, and since the
present Board of Harbor Commission
ers have been in office he was recog
nized for a time as a sort of go-be
tween or middleman between the com
mission and the contractors. His pull
on the strength of his father's relations
with Commissioner Colnon was rated
as having a commercial value.
Inglls took up the conversation with
Mr. Bibb where Colnon had dropped it,
but he prefaced a proposition which he
subsequently made by telling Bibb how
close he (Inglis) stood to the Commis
sioners and how much he could accom
plish for any one upon whom he be
stowed his favor.
Then Inglis made a proposition which
was regarded as decidedly cold-blood
ed. It was that Bibb should give him
a salary of $250 per month for the favor
Bibb was to receive at Colnon's hands,
namely the furnishing of lumber for
water front uses. Bitfb's reply was that
he did not feel justified in increasing
his payroll or providing any one with
a sinecure. Inglis was not abashed,
but said he had another proposition to
make, which was that he and Bibb
should go into a sort of partnership on
the lumber furnished to the State; that
Bibb should sell to the Harbor Com
mission one-half of all the lumber the
latter wanted, and Inglis would sell
the other half. Bibb was too shrewd
to get caught In such a trap and this
proffer also he declined.
It was not long before Commissioner
Colnon hunted up Bibb and asked him
if he had seen Inglis and made any ar
rangements with him. Bibb was not
slow in telling Colnon that he did not
propose to stand and deliver to any
one, and that he would not have any
business transactions that were not
fair, square and open.
From that day to this Bibb has been
boycotted by the Harbor Commission
ers.
The scandalous nature, of the whole
affair vexed Bibb so that he resolved
to Inform Governor Budd In order that
the latter might be kept posted as to
some of the dirty work of his appoint
ees. Bibb and the Governor had a long
interview, and when the latter learned
of Colnon's way of doing business he
used strong language in his denuncia
tions, but he advised Bibb to put in a
bid for the lumber contract Just to see
what the Commissioners would do.
Bibb did not do so directly, but he
put in three bids indirectly. The word
had already passed around among the
lumber dealers and contractors that
the Slade Lumber Company was the
fair-haired favorite. Inglis and Slade
had struck up a Damon and Pythias
friendship that was ominous for all
other bidders. Inglis went on Slade's
payroll, and it is already shown by" its
books that he received $1600 during the
Bix months he seemed to have enjoyed
hjs "pull."
As stated, Bibb's bid was put in In
directly. Byxbee & Clark, commission
lumber merchants, made a proposition
for $8 per thousand, W. H. Smith bid
$7 40 and D. K. McMullin's bid was
$6 90. Before the bids were opened Mc-
Mullin misunderstood~some remarks
made by Commissioner Colnon, and
fearing being pinched, withdrew his
bid.
The others stood together with the
bid of Slade, whose offer was to sell at
market prices. Commissioner Colnon
ignored the other bids, for it was said
he knew that lumber furnished by Byx
bee & Clark and Smith would come
from Bibb's mills, anu at once moved
that Slade's offer be accepted, which
was done. Since then, Slade has been
selling the State lumber several dollars
per thousand more than the market
price.
Governor Budd was among the most
anxious to knov- how the transactions
were carried on, and Bibb wrote a de
tailed account of the whole i atter.
This letter Is likely to be dragged forth
at the trial to-day. So far as the Gov
ernor is concerned, the affair seemed to
have been dropped.
After the chief executive had advised
Bibb to bring charges against Colnon,
Bibb told the Governor that he be
lieved he had done his duty In laying
the case before the State's highest of
ficer. That Bibb has since been boy
cotted by the Harbor Commissioners
as punishment for the part he took In
refusing to be a party to the boodle
scheme has since been demonstrated
by the fact that no one handling his
lumber can secure an acceptance of
any kind of a bid. Although Bibb took
his punishment in silence the story of
the boodling proposition leaked out,
and since the beginning of the case
now in court The Call has made inves
tigations and got to the bottom facts.
To-day these facts will be presented
under oath by Bibb.
Last night, after Bibb had been
served with a subpena, he was very
reluctant about discussing the mat
ter, but said he would not deny the
truth of the story and added: "I am,
and have been, greatly averse to tell
ing anything about my dealings with
the Harbor Commissioners. As I have
been subpenaed I will have to tell the
truth I suppose. I cannot deny the
truth of the story, but if it must come
out I would rather tell it in court."
The appearance in Judge Belcher's
court yesterday morning of "the three
C's" of Harbor Commission fame â Col
non, Chadbourne and ex-member Cole,
was made the occasion of much sym
pathetic hand-shaking and mock jocu
larity.
Counsel for the Parafflne Company
explained to the court at the opening
of the proceedings in the contract
fraud and collusion case against the
board, the manner in which Judge Cope
and himself had been prevented from
examining Slade's books, in despite of
the stipulation made in court last
Thursday. Proceedings for contempt
were suggested, but G. T. Knight, at
torney for Slade, disavowed any inten
tion of contempt on the part of the wit
ness, and said that Slade bad acted

under advice. Mr. Knight did not
think the court had any authority to
order Slade's books into the hands of
opposing counsel. Slade therefore had
Intended no discourtesy, but had acted
merely under legal advice.
Judge Belcher said, "I am convinced
I cannot punish the witness for con
tempt," but subsequently ordered that
counsel for the Paraffine Company
should have access to the hooks while
they were in possession of the court.
After the morning's session and as
Attorneys Sullivan and Cope were
about to exploit the Slade Lumber
Company accounts, Slade made a bluff
to stop them, but was soon made aware
of the presence of the clerk and bailiff.
Judge Belcher was on his way to his
chambers when .the interference was
attempted. Attorney Wright made an
especial appeal to the Judge to allow
Slade and himself to have the keeping
of the books for a few hours, or until
after recess, until he (Wright) might
better determine the rights of his
client. Slade fumed and objected
that he did not want his "private af
fairs" exposed. Both men went after
the Judge with such vehemence and
persistence as would Indicate a rather
tortured state of mind.
Judge Belcher declined to make any
change in his order merely reiterating
what would be regarded as a proper
subject matter for inquiry, and notify
ing Slade and Wright that any at
tempt to prevent counsel from examin
ing the books while the latter were in
the custody of the clerk would mean
contempt.
With the clerk and bailiff on guard,
and Wright and Slade in attendance,
counsel for the Paraffine Company
spent the recess hours trying to ex
tract some specific information respect
ing the Dundon-Slade transactions with
the Harbor Commission from Slade's
accounts.
Brief as was necessarily the re
searches made, enough was learned by
Messrs. Cope and Sullivan before Judge
Belcher reopened court to make it mer
ry for Slade on the witness-stand
throughout the afternoon. It would be
a waste of space and time to attempt a
detailed review of the man's evasions,
denials and veiled impertinence to the
court. One striking fact was estab
lished at the outset. Slade had testified
that he and he alone constituted the
Slade Lumber Company. He has un
consciously and continuously spoken of
the lumber company affairs as "ours,"
and of its existence as "we." The
Slade Lumber Company books give him
away completely, and put him in a po
sition as a witness that few men would
care to occupy, for in them it is written
plainly that the affairs of the Slade
Lumber Company and the San Fran
cisco Timber Preserving Company are
inextricably mixed and confounded.
It is estimated that greater quanti
ties of gold and silver have been sunk
in the sea than are now in circulation
in the whole world.
