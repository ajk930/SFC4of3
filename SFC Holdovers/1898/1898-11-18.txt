VICTIMS OF
A SHERIFF'S
ITCHING PALM
Youthful Convicts Tell Alice Rix
How They Were Railroaded
to San Quentin.
A Recital That Demands an Immediate In
vestigation of the Methods of Certain
Officials of San Luis Obispo
County.
Three young boys sat in Captain
Blrlem's office at San Quentin Prison.
They were Christone Portlock, Earl
Touseley and Guy Lamb. They were the
boys who were rallr I --" Qu< attn
from San Luis Obispo three months ago
on a charge of horse stealing, that a Con
etable might make a record and a Sheriff
earn his fees.
They are minors but their parents were
not notified of their arrest. They are
boys of good character but they were
given no opportunity i'~> call witnesses in
their behalf. They ure the sons of parents
in comfortable circumstances but they
were given no time to obtain means for
a defense. They were Innocent of any
intent to steal but they were urged by
Sheriff Bellew and District Attorney
Dorn, of San Luis Obispo County, to plead
guilty to the charge. The complaining
witness in the case did not appear against
them but they were convicted without
his or any other testimony. No prelimin
ary trial of their case was held in the
RAILROADED TO SAN ttUENTIN BY AVARICIOUS OFFICIALS.
Justin but they were sentenced
by a Judge of the Superior Court to one
year's penal servitude In San Quentin.
They were taken there singly. The
prison records show that Chrlstone Port
luck was committed to San Quentin
Prison or. July > Guy Lamb on August 2
ar.d Earl Touseley on August 5. And on
each separate trip from San Luis Obispo
to San Quentin with a prisoner the
Sheriff Is allowed $5 a day and expenses.
"These ara the boys," said Captain
Birlem.
They rose politely to the introduction
three tall, manly, country bred young
stersâand gave me each an awkward,
boyish shake.
â¢â¢Which is which?" I asked, looking at
the little, young faces above the prison
stripes.
The boys colored, shuffled a little and
smiled shyly ar.d then the smallest of
the three spok-:
"He's Guy Lamb." he said, pointing to
the tall, fair br,y on the left.
Guy Lamb flushed up to the roots of
his fair hair and sat down suddenly with
his eyes full of tears.
"And he's Christone Portlock," the other
boy went on hurriedly, pointing to the
boy on his right, "and I'm Earl."
'â¢Earl what?"
"Earl Touseley."
Then these two sat down.
"Are you the oldest?"
"Nc'm. I'm sixteen going on seventeen
and Chrlo he's just sixteen and Guy he's
seventeen."
"Isn't it against the law to send minors
here?" I asked the Captain.
"Sometimes," answered the Captain
guardedly, "they swear they're older."
"Did you?" I asked the boys.
"No'm."
"Do you know how you happened to
be sent here?"
"No'm."
"Did you know you were coming here?"
Touseley said: "I kirMer thought we were
going to be sent here. Chris thought It
would be. a Reform School, but I heard
some of the men in the jail say it would
be San Quentin."
"Some of the officials In the jail?"
"No'm. the other prisoners."
"And how did they know?" t
"They didn't know, but they said they
< guessed it was a case of railroad fees."
"And do you think it was. Earl?" â 
"I don't know," said the boy, looking
i troubled, "I'm all mixed up about it yet."
"I wish you'd tell me the whole story."
He shrank back in his chair. "Chris
can," he said; flushing.
"Gawan!" said Chris, flushing too. "You
'â â  tell."
"Why don't you tell, Guy?"
Guy shook his head.
. "It ain't much of a story." said Earl
slowly, "but an awful lot came out of it.
We were going to camp over at Pismo
Beach. We'd been saving for it and we
I had nearly eight dollars apiece and the
[ horses and wagon and things, and we
'' started from Portlock's house, didn't we,
; Chris?"
Chris -nodded.
"That's at Bakersfleld. It must be about !
I one hundred and seventy-five miles over j
|to the Beach, but we were tak
ing it easy, so we didn't care. Then :
one of our horses gave out and then the
wagon broke down and we had to make j
packs and sling them on the horses. j
We'd passed lots of poor old horses starv
ing to death on the road "
"Feed was so scarce they turned them
out to forage for themselves or die try
ing," interrupted Chris.
"Yes they did." Earl went on. "And
when we saw this old horse staggering
along we took him for one of them."
"You didn't," said Guy suddenly.
'That's all right," answered the other
boy quickly.
'He didn't have anything to do with
taking the horse himself. Ffe didn't want
us to take It. He was way on ahead of
us and he didn't even see the horse. We
swore to an affidavit to that too, but it
didn'; make any difference."
"It oughtn't to have made any difference
and I'm glad it didn't. We were all in
It together," said the valiant Earl.
"We never, any of us, thought of steal
ing," added Chris.
"No," said Earl; "we didn't. We put a
pack on the old horse, and wnen
we d gone along a ways we met
a man and he said, 'Here!
That's my horse you've got there,' and
he showed us a bill of sale he had for it
and the Blackburn brand on the horse,
and we told him all right and explained
how we happened to take him, and he
didn't seem to think anything wrong, and
he took the horse along, and we never
thought any more about it until they
came down on us in camp."
"Whc?"
"Twelve of them."
"We'd have been scared enough of
three," added Chris, "but twelve of then
came. They said they'd come to arrest
us. and we said 'What for?" They said
they gutssed we knew well enough â
horse stealing. The man who owned the
horse wai one of them. He was a Con

stableâConstable Hubbell, his name was.
We asked him didn't he remember what
we told him about how we came to take
the horse, but he said: 'That's all right.
You come on now and don't make any
'Wed just got the camp fixed fine,"
Earl went on, "but they took us just the
same."
"To San Luis Oblspo?"
"Yes'm."
"And then?"
"Then they took us before a Justice of
the Peace and of course we pleaded not
guilty and he said our case would be
fixed up In a week. Then they put us in
jailâ"
The boy's lip shook a little and he
stopped speaking. Guy Lamb put his
hand up across his eyes.
"Go on," said Chris. "Go on."
i "The Sheriff came to see us," Earl went j
on, obediently, "and the District Attor- I
ney. The Sheriff asked us if we wanted j
an attorney and we told him we'd have I
to write home for money. He said 'all
right.' Then we asked for paper and
things to write with and he said ' All right.' j
And when we asked the jailer afterward
he said 'AH right, by and by.' Then the j
Sheriff kept talking to us and saying it j
wouldn't do any good to bring our folks .
over because It was a clear case against j
us and we were sure to be convicted in
that court and that we didn't have any j
witnesses and we'd been caught with the
horse. The District Attorney said the
same thing and they both said that the
easiest thing for us to do was to plead
guilty. They said we'd get off with a
year in jail and that only need mean ten
months but if we tried to fight the case
they'd keep us in jail at San Luis Obispo I
' for six months before the case would i
j come up at all. They talked so nice to us |
i and as if they meant well by us and we :
! thought they'd ought to knowâ"
"We'd never been in any trouble be- j
fore," said Chris.
"And we didn't want to give our folks
any trouble and expense," said Guy. "My
father has to work." ,
"We asked couldn't we have a week. ;
! anyhow," Earl went on, "but they said |
i the Judgeâ Smith I think his name wasâ
lmd to come all the way from Santa Cruz j
: and he'd be all the harder on us v we j
i made him come over a second time. So j
we did just what they told us to. We .
\ were sure from the way they talked that ;
; they meant well by us, weren't we?"
The other boys nodded.
"And after it was all over and we were
convicted and sentenced and it was too
late, then the man who owned the horse <
said we'd done an awful foolish i
thing to plead guilty. and that i
he'd meant to dismiss the case, j
Then he talked to us and gave us some
good advice about behaving well over :
here and getting credits and getting the
sentence shortened maybeâ"
"I wisht we could," said Chris, "then
maybe I could get home and my folks j
would never know."
"Don't they know yet?"
"No." said the boy. "They don't."
"Haven't you sent them any word?"
"What's the .use? They couldn't help I
It any now. I've been in prison and they
can't help that and there's no use mak
ing them miserable. I'm never going to
tell them."
"Where do they think you are?"
'They'll think I'm camping and that I'm
Just mean and wouldn't write."
"I had to tell my folks." said Earl.
"They found It out through my brother.
He's a Constable and he brought a man
up here and saw me and â " The boy
broke down at the recollection.
"Do your people know, Guy?"
He nodded miserably.
â â My folks are working- for me," said
Earl.
"So are mine." said Guy.
Chris set his lips together. "I'd rather
stay here forever than let mine know,"
he said.
"What do you think of this case?" I
asked an official high in power at San
Qufntin as I went out the gates.
"I think," he said, "that It's the damnd
est case I ever heard of."

BIG RETAINER FOR
GENERAL HARRISON
Ex-Prssident Gets $100,000 as a

NEW YORK, Nov. 17.â A dispatch to
the World from Washington says: Ex-
President Benjamin Harrison has been
retained by Venezuela to represent that
Government before the Arbitration Com
mission that sits in Paris within a short
time to settle the dispute between Great
Britain and Venezuela over boundary
lines. General Harrison is said to have
received a retainer fee of $100,000.
Ex-Secretary Tracy is said to be an as

SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1898
AMERICA MAY
HAVE TO SUBMIT
AN ULTIMATUM
Spain Presents New
Obstacles.
TEXT OF HER MEMORANDUM
INSISTS ON SOVEREIGNTY IN
THE PHILIPPINES.
In Addition Refuses to Discuss Her
Action in Pledging the Re
sources of the
Islands.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Nov. 17. â The clerical force of
the American Peace Commission was
j busy nearly all night in translating the
I Spanish memorandum presented at
j yesterday's â¢ joint session. While the
translators and typewriters were ren
i dering the Spanish argument into
printed English, counsel for the Ameri
; can commission studied it sheet by j
â  sheet, making notes of records to be ex- j
', amined and of law points bearing on j
j the matter In hand. As a result, when j
'â  the Americans gathered for the daily i
! session to-day, the Spanish present- i
' ment lay before them in English, ready j
j for consideration and accompanied by i
! data bearing upon it.
No unofficial person knows the con- j
! tents of the document presented by the \
\ Spanish Commissioners yesterday, but j
it is safe to assume that, added to her ;
insistence on the reservation of her
Philippine sovereignty and her proposi- I
tion to arbitrate the construction of the I
1 third article of the protocol, Spain has
made two other important statements:
Firstâ That, on the high ground of
financial probity, she cannot allow any
discussion here of the validity of her
; action in pledging the resources of the j
> Philippines for the payment of the
\ Philippine debt.
Secondâ That in connection with the
! American proposal to reimburse Spain
' for her pacific expenditures in the Phil
ippines, she cannot -''mit of any in
quiry as to how she has spent the pro
ceeds of the loans based on the Philip
pine pledges.
If Spain has assumed this attitude, ;
and it is believed she has done'so, she
practically compels the American Com
missioners to consider at least the en- :
tire Philippine debt and its assumption j
by the United States or' the Philippine '
Islands as a condition to Spain's ami
able surrender of her sovereignty over
those islands.
It is difficult to understand how the
Americans ran reply to this in any
other manner 'an by strictly outlining
their position and giving the Spaniards
a time limit in which to accept the
propositions of the United States. But
the American Commissioners may pa
tiently continue their endeavors to ar
rive at an amicable understanding on
the subject.
SHIPS READY FOR SERVICE
NEW YORK, Nov. 17.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: "As
soon after arrival in port as practi
cable vessels shall coal and prepare for
sea. in order that they may always be
ready to perform any service that the
department may require."
This significant order Just issued by
the Navy Department has given rise
to much comment in naval circles. It
is believed to be due to the possibili
ties growing out of the international
situation, as well as to the dilatoriness
alleged to have been displayed by sev
eral commanding officers in getting
their ships ready for sea.
It is the policy of the administration
to maintain all warships in commission
in condition for immediate service, but
the naval authorities have been handi
capped by extensive repairs required by
the ironclads. Believing that the work
was unnecessarily drawn out, and in
order to be prepared for untoward de
velopments abroad, the department di
rected more haste, and some overtime
work is being done on the battleship
Indiana, the furnaces of which are in
very bad shape. The New York Is at
Hampton Roads awaiting the remain
ing vessels of the North Atlantic sta
tion, which will rendezvous at that
point. Their central position will make
them available for service in any di
rection.
THINK SPAIN WILL YIELD SOON
NEW YORK, Nov. 17.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Advices which Secretary Hay received
to-night from Paris have encouraged
the authorities to believe that negotia
tions will be satisfactorily completed
at a very early date. None of the au
thorities will talk about the contents
of the dispatches received, but there is
no doubt that they have give.i this im
pression, and the authorities are ac
cordingly gratified over the outlook.
The feeling is that the Spanish Gov
ernment will accede, under protest, of
course, to tke demands of the American
commissioners.
"The entrance of a third power into
the negotiations," said an official to
day, "would be an interference, and
furthermore would delay progress of
the work. The United States will set
tle the matter in the way it sees fit."
It was admitted to-day by adminis
tration officials that instructions had
been sent to the American Commission
ers to negotiate with the Spanish repre
sentatives for the cession of an island
of the Carolines to the United States,
preferably Ualan. No demand will be
made for the cession of the island, but
Spain will be asked to sell it to this
Government.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17.â T1.- ad
ministration f-els encouraged over the
outlook for a successful termination of
the labors of the Ptace Commissioners
in Paris. Whether thif renewed confi
dence is based upon an abstract of the
Spanish reply which was submitted at
yesterday's meeting or is founded upon
private advices indicating a weakening
of the Spanish position is not known,
but it is probable that both of these
had an Influence in brightening the
prospects.
Brighter Peace Prospects.
PRESIDENT DWIGHT
OF YALE RESIGNS
Noted Educator Desires to Retire
Before flge Weighs Too Y\ea\f
ily Upon H* m -
PROF. TIMOTHY DWIGHT, WHO RESIGNED THE PRESI
DENCY OF YfILE UNIVERSITY YESTERDAY.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Nov. 17.â At the meeting ->f the corpora
tion of Yale University late this afternoon President TLnothy
Dwight presented his resignation. The resignation is to take
effect at the end of the university year.
Among the friends of Dr. Dwight it has been no secret
for some time that the president contemplated his resignation be
fore age weighed too heavily upon him. In his letter Dr. Dwight
says:
It has been my conviction for many years that it is desirableâ alike with
reference to his own happiness in the later, less active and more restful peri
od of life, and as related ta the highest interests of the institutionâ that a per
son who is placed in the chief administrative office in a large university like
this should not continue in that position beyond the age of 70. In accordance
with this conviction, I have had the purpose ever since I entered upon the
presidency, to offer my resignation at that time when I should myself
reach that age, which time has just arrived, and I make known to you my
desire to withdraw from the duties of my office at the close of the academ
ic year, and my wish that, at the regular meeting of your body, which is
to be held in May, or at the meeting that will take place in June, you
should elect a president of the uni% - ersity who shall enter upon the duties
of his position Immediately after the next annual commencement.
President Dwight said to-night: "I have no particular plans for
the immediate future. Of course I shall serve out he year, but be
yond that Ido not know what I shall do except to take a rest. Yes,
I shall remain here In New Haven, to make my home here as a
quiet citizen, and I hope to die here."
Professor George J. Brush, director of Sheffield Scientific School,
to-day presented his resignation. It was accepted and Professor
Brush was appointed professor emeritus. Professor R. H. Chitten
den was elected as Director Brush's successor.
The report of William F. Farnum, treasurer of Yale University,
showed that the increase of the permanent fund of the university the
past year has been $57,544. The general fund of the university
amounts to $772,358, and other special funds make a total of $1,635,
550. The academical funds aggregate $1,607,590; the funds of the the
ological department amount to $649,122, and the Sheffield Scientific
School fund ia $406,312; the law department has funds amounting to
$117,347 and the art school has funds amounting to $115,627.

Nebraska.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA. Nov. 17.â For eighteen
years Fred Bechtel of Omaha has been
chief auditor of the Pacific Express
Company. To-day he was placed on
trial for embezzling funds of the com
pany. Erastus Young, auditor of the
Union Pacific, who succeeded Bechtel
long enough to make an investigation,
which he alleges developed that $150,
000 of the company's funds had been
feloniously squandered, supplies the
evidence of the prosecution.
In addition to being the Pacific Ex
press Company's auditor, Bechtel has.
been a prominent politician. He was
president of the Omaha Council when
arrested. Mr. Bechtel's friends declare
that while considerable funds of the
company have been used for political
purposes during Bechtel's incumbency,
the money was paid to members of the
Nebraska Legislature during the past
ten years to head off hostile legislation.
At the time of Bechtel's arrest his
assistant, T. K. Sudburrough, and Chief
Clerk Andy Hunt al3O were arrested,
and President Morseman resigned.
Friends of the interested ex-offlcials as
sert that the prosecution is due to a de
sire of the new spirit in the Union Pa
cific management to make a record, and
since that company owns a big block
of Pacific Express Company stock,
Young took this means of making 1 pub
lic matters which he thought would es
tablish his standing as a shrewd au
ditor.
On the other hand, Young's friend 3
assert that he investigated the business
in the ordinary course and found things
so that prosecutions were necessary.
One of the clerks under Bechtel was
the first witness and to-day testified to
having forced balances frequently, at
one time adding J20.000 to make the
books balance. He said he did this un
der instructions from the assistant au
ditor and understood the money was
used for legislative purposes at Lin
coln. The irregularities had been going
on ten years, he said.
The testimony brought out the ad
ditional fact that many of the books
and papers of the department had dis
appeared when Bechtel was arrested.
The case will continue a week. Its
most interesting phase is that the in
coming Legislature proposes to investi
gate the report that thousands of dol
lars have been used to corrupt Neb
raska legislators, and for this purpose
will force the express company to bring
In its books for the past ten years.
DEPRECATE THE DELAY.
MADRID, Nov. 17.â Almost all the
papers deprecate the dilatory proceed
ings at Paris, expressing their belief
that the United States will decline ar
bitration and urging the Government
to yield quickly, since It is impossible
for Spain to renew the struggle or to
expect European assistance, and, fur
thermore, because it would be better to
cease wasting money and concentrate
attention upon Spain's domestic affairs
and the restoration of her finances.
LONDON, Nov. 17.â A1l the special
dispatches to the London papers this
morning from Paris express the belief
that the Spanish Commissioners will
finally yield, though under protest, to
the American demands.
Why Sagasta Procrastinates.
LONDON. Nov. 17.â The Paris corre
spondent of the Daily Telegraph says:
"I understand that Senor Sagasta de

that the signature of a peace treaty
would be the end of his public life, and,
in the second place, because he desires

FRESNO, Nov. 17.â A. J. Brandreth,
a graduate of Yale University, died at
the County Jail to-day at noon of de
lirium tremens. He claimed to be a
nephew of Dr. Brandreth, the wealthy
patent medicine man. Yesterday he
had a check for $1500 and wore a dia
mond stud. When he was arrested last
night the check and diamond were
gone. It is suspected that he had been
doped and robbed. The matter will be
investigated at the Coroner's inquest

had been waiting on table at Dr. Eshel
man's Minnewawa vineyard until Sun
day, when he was discharged for in
toxication.
An officer is making an investigation.
! into the mysterious death of Brand
reth, but as yet has found no tangible
[ clew to work on. Last Friday he came
to town from the Minnewawa vine
yard and told Al Woodward, a bar
keeper at Harry "Wilson's saloon, that
a relative of his had died, leaving him
considerable money, and that he had
come to town to sign the necessary
papers to obtain the legacy. He 3tated
j that he expected the money Tuesday.
i On that day he showed a chec,k for $1500
I and was loaned $10 by Woodward. Yes
i terday and last night he had been
drinking around at different saloons.
He met Officer Walton last night and
inquired where Rev. Edward Eccleston,
the Presbyterian minister, lived, ex
plaining that he and Eccleston had been
schoolmates. The officer did not know
the address, whereupon Brandreth re
quested him to lock him up. The po
liceman said Brandreth was not very
much under the influence of liquor at
that time, but as he persisted in his
request to be locked up Walton put him.
in jail. He soon was taken with de
lirium tremens, and as he was a re
markably robust man it required two
men to hold him. He had requested
Officer Waltcrn to send Rev. Eccleston
to him In the morning, adding there
would be $50 in it for the officer. This
forenoon the minister reached him just
before he died.
CUBAN ARMY WANTS
UNCLE SAM'S GOLD
This Government Will Be Asked to
Give the Island Soldiers a
Year's Pay.
NEW YORK, Nov. 17.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: An officer of thÂ«
United States army, recently from Cuba,
stated to me that one of the objects of
Garcia's visit to this country was to en
deavor to get this Government to assume
the obligation to pay off the Cuban army
for a year. The statement was further
made that the Cuban army was eager to
disperse, but the men had no means of
support and would be helpless were they
to go to their homes. Property being in
common during military organization the
men are enabled to use what comes in
their way without protest. This privi
lege would vanish at the disorganization
of the army.
Representations in behalf of these Cu
ban soldiers will be made by the com
mission headed by General Garcia and a
strong hope is expressed in certain quar
ters that the plea may be effective. On
the other hand, the administration may
consider the wiser course to be a distri
bution of food after the plan of the Comal
and Bratton expeditions.
BLOODLESS SHOOTING
IN PANA'S STREETS
Hundreds of Shots Exchanged Be-
tween White Strikers and
Colored Miners.
PANA, 111.. Nov. 17.â Non-union colored
miners and white strikers clashed In the
streets of this city again to-day. Several
hundred shots were fired, but the com
batants did their shooting from behind
trees and hedges, consequently no blood
was spilled. The trouble is said to have
been started by an unknown negro firing
upon Wesley Pope, a striker. Pope saya
he was walking near the Springslde col
liery, where the negroes are quartered,
when he was' fired upon. He secured a
rifle and reinforcements. Meantime the
negroes appeared in force and the shoot
ing became general. After several hun
dred shots had been exchanged the ne
groes retreated to their stockade. The
militia arrived too late to get into action,
but are patrolling the Springside district
in force to-night.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 17. âIn the
course of his testimony before the War
Investigation Commission to-day Dr.
Forwood, speaking of the conditions at
Montauk Point, where he was chief
army surgeon, said the kitchens were
in the most expert hands. Miss Helen
Gould had supplied a number of chefs,
and most of them were from the kitch
ens of the wealthiest people of New
York City. He had talked with o-ne of
them who had been with W. H. Van
derbilt for more than three years.
As a matter of fact the hospitals were
never so abundantly supplied. The
army rations were supplemented by
everything that could be found in the
larder of the Waldorf-Astoria, includ
ing roast turkey, pheasants, squabs,
lambs, sheep, pigs, game of all kinds,
pate de foie gras, mineral waters and
the finest champagnes and liquors. At
one time he had noticed eight barrels
of brandy and a large number of cases
of wine. There was so much apolli
naris water that it was in the way, and
when a nurse came for a bottle they
would offer a case.
He said the newspaper men at the
camp were gentlemen, but they ap
peared to be under orders to criticize
the camp. He knew of two instances
when the reporters had received orders
to "roast everything:." He had to-ld
them not to spare where they found
criticism justilied.
In conclusion Dr. Forwood said that
many patients who had been removed
by their friends had often died, and
that in many instances their deaths
were due to the kindness of friends
who had taken them in charge.
Major General S. B. Young was
before the commission at its afternc-on
session, relating in detail his experi
ence at Santiago and vicinity and after
ward at Aiontaulf. He said he had
landed at Baiquiri on the 21st of June,
and that by the morning of the 23d his
entire brigade had been put ashore. He
had notified General Wheeler imme
diately and had received orders to move
on four or rive miles and secure a gc-od
camp. He accordingly had pushed on
to Siboney. He had asked Wheeler
where the good camping ground was,
and Wheeler had replied that the Span
iards occupied it.
' 1 then," said General Young, "asked
permission ttr go out and see the
gTound, to which General Wheeler as
sented."
In accordance with this arrangement
he moved out at 5 o'clock next morn
ing to fight the battle of La Quasima,
sending the volunteers, the Rough
Riders, by one road and the regulars
by another. He declared that there
was no surprise in this fight and no
ambuscade had been reported. He had
reconnoitered the Spanish camp within
a half hour before the fight had begun, !
End he had attacked the Spaniards and
not the Spaniards him. Speakirg of the
Rough Kiders he said there had been i
no greater percentage of casualties
among them than among the regulars,
and that they were not led into any
situation not to be expected in war.
"The report that they were ambus
caded was due," he said, "entirely to
the demoralized reporter and the de
moralized adjutant of the regiment,
who left the service soon afterward."
General Young said he had occupied
the enemy's camp that day. "and it
was a very good camp," he added,
naively.
In reply to a question as to what aid \
he had received from the Cubans in this ;
fight, he replied, "None whatever." !
The Cuban guides had deserted him ;
upon the first fire. General Castillo |
on the night before had told him that ;
he would send 500 Cubans with him, i
but when the next morning came and j
he sent to notify Castillo that he was j
prepared to proceed, his messenger
found a card on the Cuban command- !
er's door saying that he must not be
disturbed. He had, therefore, proceed
ed without the Cubans. After the fight
was over, however, some of the Cubans
had come up under the command of a
Frenchman, who saluted very tragic
ally with his saber, saying that he had
been commanded by General Castillo to
follow the enemy and fight him wher
ever he could find him. General Young
Baid he simply ordered the Cubans to
the rear, and the only service they had
performed was to gather up the bag
gage that the American soldiers had
discarded.
General Young said he had been the
only man in the command at La
Uuasima who was mounted, and that
he rode a mule. He carried no bag
gage except a rubber "slicker," a pa
lama and a toothbrush. The wounded
tvere carried back to Siboney, and while
the hospital was somewhat congested
the men were well attended to.
General Young said that immediate- !
ly after the battle of Quasima he had I
looked the ground over toward El |
Caney and had informed General I

LAUNCHING OF THE FORMIDABLE,
LARGEST WARSHIP IN THE WORLD
PORTSMOUTH, England, Nov. 17.â Thousands of people to-day wit
nessed the launching of the ram battleship Formidable at the dock
yard here.
She is said to be the largest warship in the world, being of
16,000 tons displacement. She is 400 feet long, has 75 beam and
draws 26 feet nine inches of water. She cost over Â£1,000,000, and is ex
pected to steam eighteen knots an hour.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Michael Hicks-Beach; the First
Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Goschen, and Admiral Sir Michael Culme Sey
mour were among those present.
j Wheeler that he was confident he could
I take the place that night with his
' brigade, if allowed to do so. General
Wheeler had replied that his orders
from General Shatter were not to ad
vance without notifying him, and that
Ihe would notify the general of his
j (General Youngs) wishes. He had not
heard anything more officially in regard
to the matter.
With this General Young's service in
Cuba ceased, as he was taken down
with fever on June 30 and sent back
home. Speaking of the situation at
j Camp Wickoff, which he was detailed
j to establish, he said:
"I gave them lumber, hammers and
nails, however, and told them to make
i themselves floors if they wanted them.
I thought they were being treated too
much like babies."
He regarded the commissary supplies,
: he said, as abundant, and that enough
! had been allowed to spoil to feed 1500
! men daily. The hospital and quarter
i master stores also were ample. He had
I never in all his experience seen army
! hospitals so well supplied with medi
cines and stores of all kinds. The con
trolling motive in selecting Montauk
was that of selecting proper quaran
tine, and a very strict quarantine was
I observed. He considered the camp very
1 healthful and the size very desirable.
"As to what was done there for the
soldiers," he said, "I think I deserved
more credit for what I did at Montauk
than for what I did at La Quasima. I
think more was done than sho-uld have
been done for the soldiers."
Telling of the hardships of one com
mand which had just arrived from
Cuba he said:
"They were not the heroes, being only
regulars."
He said the privations, of the war
were not so serious as Indian cam
paigns he had been engaged in. There
had been occasions when his command
had had to live on corn and others
when there was nothing to be had ex
cept horse meat or burro meat.
"But that," he said, "was not in the
newspapers."
He was satisfied that most of the
complaints against the camp were un
founded. Many of these complaints
were made by men and women who
had never seen men in camp. Appre
ciating the s'tuatlc-n the soldiers had
"played it on" the visitors, making
complaints that were without founda
tion, in order to get delicacies.
"Soldiers like to be made babies of,"
he said, "and some of them soon got
so they would not eat their regular ra
tions."
General Young concluded his testi
mony with the statement that the sol
diers were far better cared for than
they had been in the civil war.
More Money Is Needed.
"WASHINGTON, Nov. 17.â Chairman
Cannon of the Appropriations Com
mittee of the House has called a meet
ing of the sub-Committee on Deficien
cies to meet on Saturday, November
26, to consider the estimates for the
maintenance of the extraordinary ex
penses of the army and navy during
the period from January 1, 1899, to July
1, 1899. It will be necessary to frame
end enact an urgent deficiency bill to
provide for these expenditures before
the holiday recess, as the balance of
$226,000,000 and the original $50,000,000
appropriated to carry on the war are
not available after December 31. What
ever remains of these appropriations
must be covered back In the treasury
on that date. How much has been ex
pended is not known, but the presump
tion is that there is a considerable bal
ance.
Some difficulty may be experienced
in getting this measue through both
houses before the new year, as its pre
sentation may open up the whole ques
tion as to the conduct of the war. The
Appropriation Committee will do its
duty and have the bill ready for action
as soon as Congress meets. Further
more, it is the intention of the com
mittee to expedite the framing and con
sideration of the regular appropria
tion bills in every possible way in the
eariy portion of the session in order to
avoid an ex"tra session should the Re
publican leaders later decide that an
extra session next spring was advis
able.

THE FORMIDABLE AS SHE WILL APPEAR UNDER STEAM.
MUCH WORK FOR
CONGRESS TO DO
An Extra Session Will Be
Necessary.
FORAKER AND MORGAN AGREE
LEGISLATION FOR OUB NEW
POSSESSIONS.
Alabama Senator Discusses Spain's
Sullen Attitude and Probable
Outcome of the Peace
Â» Negotiations
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17.â Senators
Morgan and Foraker of the Foreign Re
lations Committee, Democratic and Re
publican respectively think an extra
session of Congress will be necessary.
Senator Foraker said to-day: "Cer
tainly this Congress cannot finish all
the legislation required for our new
possessions, and an extra session is ab
solutely necessary. W r hat Congress will
do in regard to Cuba depends upon the
President's recommendations in his
message. This subject is different from
Porto Rico, the Philippines and Ha
waii, and Congress will treat it differ
ently."
Senator Morgan is of opinion that
Spain can do nothing but maintain a
sullen protest, as she did when Mexico
got her liberty. Her only recognition
of the liberty of Mexico was her evacu
ation. Without acknowledging our
right to the territory we claim, she
would yield possession.
"If a treaty of peace is signed," he
said, "its prospects of ratification by
the Senate will be increased by the
fact that its rejection would throw us
back into a state of war. A treaty
that made too great concessions to
Spain â that restored to her the Philip
pines, for instance â might be rejected
on that ground, since failure of the
treaty would leave us in possession of
the territory. But if the treaty provides
for acquistion of the Philippines by
this country or leaves those islands un
der the protecttion and domination of
this Government, those who oppose
such an order of things can have no
motive for rejection of the treaty.
"This Government cannot set out to
gain advantages by conquest, but the
spirit of liberty advances with enlight
enment. With the first awakening of
love of liberty and an ambition among
people to govern themselves they seek
our friendship and association, and per
haps alliance. We advance by the nat
ural development of the institutions of
free government. The war with Spain
was forced upon us. It was not sought
by us with design to acquire territory
or to extend our commerce, but by its
results people are lifted out of bondage
and introduced to freedom, and we in
turn are benefited by it through the
opening cf new fields of enterprise.
Aside from the intrinsic value of the
Philippine Islands, the liberation of
their people opens up a new field of
enterprise and gives a stimulus to
trade. But these islands, like Hawaii,
have no immense intrinsic value."
"What influence do you think this ac
quisition of remote territory will have
upon our domestic affairs?" the Senator
was asked.
"With territorial expansion and de
velopment of commerce will come the
quickening of enterprise and the open
ing up o* opportunities, stimulus to in
genuity, an expansion of manufacture
and of trade, an extension and liberal
izing of customs, revenue and shipping
laws, and an expansion of our whole
financial system. Instead of contrac
tion, there wilt be an expansion of cur
rency, and all our domestic policies will
adjust themselves to new conditions.
The course of events will accomplish
\yhat party contentions have failed to
accomplish."
CIGAR DEALERS FILE
BANKRUPTCY PETITION
Seidenberg, Steifel & Co. of New
York Involved in Financial
Difficulties.
NEVv 7 YORK. Nov. 17.â Emil Seidenberg,
Joseph Seidenberg and Adolph Steifel,
constituting the firm of Seidenberg, Steifel
& Co., cigar dealers, to-day filed a petition
in bankruptcy. The liabilities are $308,864),
and contingent liabilities $202,932. No as
sets are stated, but a few of the creditors
hold securities.
A notable feature of the launch of the battleship was the enthusiasm
shown by both British and American officers.
With her sister ships how under construction, the Implacable and the
Irresistible, the Formidable is a first-class barbette battleship of the Can
opus and Albion type, but built on a much larger scale, having 2000 tons
greater displacement and 3000 horsepower more than those ships.
Her armament will consist of two 12-inch rifled guns in each of the
fore and aft turrets, twelve 6-inch quick-firing rifles and twelve 12-pounder
rifles "en barbette," besides fourteen quick-firing rifled guns of smaller di
mensions and five torpedo tubes.

Loss â Korean Emperor Being
Forced to the Terms of
Reformers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Nov. 17.â The Oriental
Steamship Company will open its new
line between Hongko-ng, Yokohama and
San Francisco in December, according
to advices received per Empress of
China. The Ninon Maru (6151 tons),
flrst of the company's steamers to ar
rive from England, reached Yokohama
on October 26. After being docked lor
minor repairs she was c-pened for pub
lic inspection early in November. About
November 25 she will go to Hongkong,
whence she will sail for San Francisco,
calling at Shanghai, Nagasaki, Kobe
and Yokohama. Two other steamers,
the America Maru and Hongkong Maru,
are en route from England.
Another battle has been fought in
Formosa, Four hundred and fifty rebels
were killed and many wounded. The
Japanese loss was also large. The
Japanese Government recently granted
a large bounty to native chiefs in re
turn tor their submission. Some of the
chiefs complained of an unfair distribu
tion of these bounties and induced their
followers to rise again. Six companies
of Japanese infantry, sappers and
troopers, marched against and sur
rounded them, killing the number
stated.
A crisis exists in Korea. Natives led
by the Independence Club of Seoul de
manded the dismissal of Cabinet offi
cers who favored reviving the old tor
ture system of punishment of prison
ers and of depriving people of the right
of memorializing the Government. The
Emperor was compelled to dismiss his
Premier and Ministers of Wai", Justice,
Finance, Imperial Household and Agri
culture and Industry. Yun Yongson
was nominated Premier. His appoint
ment raised a storm of indignation, be
cause tht- Independence Club had lately
secured his dismissal from other offices.
His residence was besieged by the agi
tators and he quickly resigned. More
satisfactory Ministers were then named.
The Independence Club is composed of
Korean reformers, who are fighting for
justice and better government. Its
delegates who demanded changes in the
Cabinet sat in front of the new palace
gate for several days, until the Em
peror acquiesced in their demands. The
club now requests the organization of
the Diet, but the Government rejects
the proposal on the ground that Korea
Is not yet sufficiently advanced to have
a national congress. The Emperor has
promised other reforms, including es
tablishment of schools for girls.
AWFUL COLLISION OF
JAPANESE STEAMERS
Seventy Persons Reported Drowned
in an Inland Sea â Leper Scare
at Manila.
VANCOUVER, Nov. 17.â Advices re
ceived by the steamship Empress of
China tell of a terrible disaster in an in
land sea on October 25, when the steam? r
Kinshu-maru came into collision with
the steamer Miagawa-maru, off Takami,
sinking: the latter in three minutes. It is
reported that 180 persons were saved, but
that seventy were drowned. So strong;
was the impact .that the captain, who
was on the bridge, was thrown into the
sea. He was saved, however, with all
the crew.
There is a leper scare in Manila.
Through the neglect of Spanish officials
nearly 200 lepera have escaped from con
finement. For ;i time thi;; was unknown
to the American authorities, and the out
casts were allowed to wander at large.
Orders have been issued to the effect that
all lepers shall be arrested and sent to a
small uninhabited island south of Luzon.
On this island the American Govern
ment will establish harborage for the
lepers of the Philippines. They will be
fed and cared for at the expense of the
Government. As far as can be ascer
tained, about sixty lepers are still at
large on the streets and in the suburbs of
Manila.

TO IMPROVE THE
STATE LIBRARY
Call for an Important
Meeting.
MANY SUBJECTS TO DISCUSS
CERTAIN LEGISLATION THAT IS
NECESSARY.
Trustees of the Statj Library and
the State Library Association
About to Hold a
Conference.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 17. â Interest
has been awakened here in a joint
meeting of the trustees of the State
Library and the State Library Asso
ciation, to be held in the Senate cham
ber on the afternoon of November 25
The call, which is now being sent
throughout the State, announces that
one of the objects of the meeting will
be to discuss and agree upon a plan for
the establishment of a system of trav
eling libraries. Efforts will be made
to secure the enactment of a law pro
viding for carrying the same into effect.
Another question to be eo-nsidered will
be that of inter-library loans, giving es
pecial attention to the splendid collec
tion in the State Library, and the de
vising of a plan by which its riches can
be made more generally available.
Speaking of the approaching confer
ence State Librarian Frank L. Coombs
said to The Call correspondent to-day:
"The conference is to be held at the
suggestion of George T. Clark, Librar
ian of the San Francisco Free Library.
It was deemed best to postpone the
date of the meeting until after the elec
tion in order that the newly elected
members of the Legislature might have
the opportunity to familiarize them
selves with the subject. Whatever our
proceedings may be they will all be in
the direction of a law which we will en
deavor to have the next Legislature
pass. . ,
"The State Library has gone beyond
its original scopeâ that of supplying
State officials and legislators with data,
etc.â and has become a sort of State
storehouse for a large number of valu
able works of art and literature. But
under the present system the library s
volumes are inaccessible to a large
number of its benefactors, the people
of this State in general.
"There is now an opportunity to bring
the State library into touch with the
other libraries of California, by the
suggested system of the interchange of
volumes. This system contemplates the
sending of books to libraries applying
for them, in response to the require-:
ments of their patrons. The libraries
thus receiving the books shall be re
sponsible for their safe return. In this
way many volumes that are now prac
tically out of the reach of the public
will be accessible to it, and the useful
ness of the library to the people of the
State will be greatly enhanced."
Mr. Coombs said that there were
many volumes which were too valuable
to be allowed to leave the library. For
instance, the library contains one set of
"Shakespeare," valued at $2500. There
is also a "Life of Christ" which is
valued at $100 per section. The collec
tion as a whole comprises 100,000 vol
umes, and there are many of these
which cannot be duplicated in any of
the libraries of the State.

25-27 Market St., S F.HOW D. M. TOMBLIN MANIPULATED AFFAIRS
OF THE JOHN BROWN COLONY AND ITS FEEDERS
Startling Revelations of the
Conduct of the Pacific
Bank Wreckers.
Revelry and Extravagance Marked
the History of the Possession
of the Bankers and Their
Tools.
The announcement in The Call yes
terday morning that there is in this
city very valuable property of Dr. R.
H. McDonald subject to attachment
has created a sensation. For over five
years defrauded creditors of the Mc-
Donald bank have been searching in
vain for the evidence that was present
ed in yesterday's Call. The legal*seiz
ure of property that has been made in
the courts of this city will be prosecut
ed to a conclusion as rapidly as possi
ble. There is very little question that
Horace W. Carpentier will make a de
fense to save the Market s* ~eet prop
erty from the creditors of the bank, but
the evidence supplied by Call and
other facts now in possession of this
newspaper will demonstrate that Mr.
Carpentier holds this valuable local
real estate simply as the agent of Dr.
McDonald.
As soon as sufficient time has elapsed
for the necessary legal advertisement
of the summons the action will be tried.
When the facts have been submitted
before the Superi6r Court the property
will be placed in the hands of the cred
itors of the McDonald banks to be used
to their advantage and in liquidation
partially of their claims. The Call re
sumes this morning' the history of the
secret correspondence of the McDonald
bank conspirators, beginning the pub
lication of a remarkable series of let
ters written by D. M. Tomblin, one of
the confidential advisers of R. H. Mc-
Donald Jr.
The correspondence of D. M. Tomblin
reveals the operations of the powerful
conspiracy that ruled the John Brown
colony and the Madera Bank from Oc
tober, 1891. until long after the collapse
of the Pacific Bank on June 22, 1893. A
brief outline of the history of the John
Brown colony and of the Madera Bank
Is necessary to understand Tomblin's
letters and the position the writer oc
cupied in reference to the other con
spirators in the bank. In September of
1889 John Brown purchased thirty-two
hundred acres of land in what was
then Fresno County from Thomas E.
Hughes and J. L. Martin. At a sub
sequent day two thousand acres more
were purchased from E. W. Chapman.
All of this land was within seven miles
of the town of Madera. In payment for
the purchase Brown gave his notes, se
cured by mortpiEres on the land. He
then began his scheme of colonization.
He assumed the superintendency of the
colony, while his associate, W. F.
Baird, took practical control of the
bank that was established at the town
of Madera.
Affairs continued with varying suc
cess for the colonizers for almost two
years, when Brown and Baird discov
ered they needed money. Brown had
posed as a model young man and had
ingratiated himself in the good graces
of Dr. McDonald by posing as an en
thusiastic advocate of temperance.
With this recommendation he went to
Dr. McDonald in May, 1891, and asked
assistance for a scheme of colonization.
Dr. McDonald at once permitted an
overdraft and the trouble began. There
seemed no end to the financial necessi
ties of the Bank of Madera and the
John Brown colony. Draft after draft
on the Pacific Bank was honored, and
the sum owed by the Bank of Ma
dera rapidly increaeed until it was be
tween thirty and forty thousand dol
lars. Nothing could be done to reduce
this enormous sum and the. McDonalds
determined upon an investigation. They
gent D. S. Dora, Dr. W. Jenningson and
D. M. Tomblin to Madera to make an
inquiry. At a subsequent day A. F.
Johns and Frank V. McDonald went
down and an imperative demand was
made upon Brown and Baird to give up
the bank and the colony to the Pacific
Bank.
This was done without hesitancy, and
the McDonalds took charge of the dan
gerous speculation. A. F. Johns was
made president and manager of the
John Brown colony and D. M. Tomblin
was made cashier of the Madera Bank.
As affairs progressed Tomblin became >
vice president of the Madera Bank and |
then president. In this capacity he had
the affairs of the bank absolutely under ;
his control. In addition to- his duties |
as cashier he acted as a spy for Dick
and reported regularly the actions of
A. F. Johns and his son and everybody
else remotely or intimately connected j
with the affairs of the bank. In his I
letters Tomblin permits not a single
detail to escape his notice. When he
found that W. iS. Johns, the son of A. F. j
Johns, had been made superintendent of
the John Brown colony he kept a close j
watch on the young man's actions and
with Boswellian accuracy reported them
to his master, Dick McDonald. When
W. E. Johns, who is better known to
the public as "Billy Elmer," exercised
and displayed his 10-ve for horses and
dogs Mr. Tomblin reported to R. H. {
McDonald Jr. that W. E. Johns wa-8 j
paying a hundred dollars a month to ,
take care of his bull pup and his horses. '
When young Johns and young
"Dutchy" indulged in an innocent Sun
day afternoon pastime of punching
each others' heads for the edification
of admirers D. M. Tomblin unsymDa
thetically reported the incident to the
young San Francisco banker. When
"Spider" Kelly and young Johns in
dulged their ideal of the beautiful by
attending a cockfight Mr. Tomblin was
not slow in sending the information
to his employer. When Johns and the
"Spider" cleaned out a certain habita
tion and ruled a noisy establishment
with more noise D. M. Tomblin meta
phorically chrew up both hands and
declared that the precious three were
on the road to ruin. It is from this
point of view the letters of D. M.
Tomblin are valuable. The man kept
a close watch upon those he believed
were his rivals for Dick's favor. The
financial transactions of young Johns
were carefully noted and Tomblin
made accusations serious enough to
have the elder Johns threaten to kill
him.
When Mr. Tomblin himself was
caught in the act of attending a cock
fight and of betting on a prizefight he
admitted with true Christian humility
that the fact was true, but said that as
cashier of a big institution and dealing
with men who constantly wanted mon
ey he believed it his duty to study the
characters of these men and learn their
habits. To gain the information he
desired he found it necessary to go
among these men.
That was the reason, he told Dick,
why he went and remained a spectator
of the brutal contests. Mr. Tomblin
was probably too busy, however, to
discuss with any degree of minuteness
the financial operations of the Madera
Bank. He may find more leisure some
time perhaps to explain some rather
curious entries in the books of the
bank. Of the material interests of the
McDonalds in Madera and at the
colony D. M. Tomblin wrote nothing
that was material except in reference
to the manipulation of the Johns fam
ily.
A DISCREPANCY OF THIRTY THOUSAND
DOLLARS IN THE MADERA BANK.
When Tomblin took charge of the
Madera Bank, in October, 18U1, he
wrote, "This bank is rotten to the
core" and there is a discrepancy of at
least $30,000. For months he pursued
his investigation and after the com
plete reorganization of the bank went
north to investigate another wildcat
scheme of Dick McDonald, the Cedar
River coal mine. The McDonalds had
been inveigled into this Seattle venture
and had sunk thousands and thousands
of dollars into it. Tomblin went to
Seattle and to the mine and reported
simply on the situation. The sugges
tions that he offered were not feasible
and after several months in the north
Tomblin returned to resume charge of
the Madera Bank. He arrived at Ma
dera in September, 1592, and reported
to Dick that it would be extremely un
wise to give up the Madera Bank or
to sell it to certain persons who seemed
eager to buy it.
Tomblin had under consideration a
project which was subsequently Teal
lzed to erect a new bank building and
increase the operations of the institu
tion. This, as a matter of course,
meant the expenditure of increased
sums of money by the McDonalds, but
Tomblin had his way and the Pacific
Bank was plunged deeper and deeper
into the scheme. At the same time
Tomblin suggested that the McDonalds
take an active interest in the agitation
for the division of Fresno County and
the creation of Madera County. This
scheme was also indorsed by Dick and
several more thousands of dollars were
lost to the depositors of the Pacific
Bank and through it to the depositors
of the People's Bank. On September
19 Tomblin wrote:
"The people here are very active in
pushing matters for a new county, and
if successful Madera will be the county
seat, which will put many thousands
of dollars in our pockets. I think their
claims are good, and with proper work
they can accomplish the result."
"SHERMAN DID WRONG TO WORK THE
PACIFIC BANK INTO THE SCHEME."
After writing this letter Tomblin left
Madera to go to Biverside and investi
gate the affairs of the Riverside Bank.
O. T. Dyer, the manager of that bank,
was then in New York attempting to
negotiate the securities of his institu
tion. His sister, Miss E. C. Dyer, the
cashier of the institution, was at Riv
erside and Tomblin proceeded to bad
ger her to a point almost beyond en
durance. The lady, however, gave him
no satisfaction, and Tomblin simply
contributed as an officious and annoy
ing agent of the Pacific Bank to create
a run on the Riverside institution. Be
yond this h.3 influence had no material
effect, and his letters 'in connection
with the incident possess no particular
interest.
While Tomblin was carrying out his
mission to annoy Miss Dyer and to
force her to a realization of the serious
condition of her affairs Tomblin penned
an exceptionally important letter that
demonstrates two points in the great
conspiracy. In the first place the fact
is proved that R. H. McDonald Jr. was
warned not to permit M. H. Sherman
to trap him into the Los Angeles elec
tric road scheme. Dick was deaf to the
warning, however, and Sherman's trap
WÂ»a sprung. The other point that
Tomblin's letter establishes is the fact
that the schemers surrounding the Mc-
Donalds stood for themselves and al
ways against him after a scheme had
been launched. In his letter Tomblin
congratulates Dick upon the superb
property he has obtained in the Los
Angeles electric road. At that very
Ume Sherman was writing to Dick that
THE SAN FRANCUCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 189 S.
SHERMAN WAS WRONG TO TRAP THE PACIFIC BANK.
In one of his letters to R. H. McDonald Jr., D. M. Tomblin submitted a report on the Los Angeles Electric Road. He
declared his belief that the road would ultimately justify the McDonalds In their enormous expenditure of money,
but at the same time he declared that Moses 11. Sherman had committed a wrong in working the Pacinc Bank
and its managers into the scheme. Tomblin reminded his employer that he had already warned him of the dangerous
character of the speculation, but since he had gone into it his financial existence was dependent upon his ability to
get out of it without being scorched. Part of Tomblin's letter on this subject is given in facsimile above.
the road was not prosperous and would
not be for a long time. Excerpts from
Tomblin's letter are as follows:
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept. 27, 1892.
R. H. McDonald, V. P., San Fran
cisco.âMy Dear Sir: I called upon
Mr. Sherman this morning at the
power house of the electric company.
Everything seems to be running su
perbly. He is a very brilliant man
and has certainly accomplished won
ders. I have been over a part of the
system and must say that I think it
is a grand piece of work, and I be
lieve will bring you out handsomely
at some time not very far hence.
You know I told you before you
went into this scheme that I was
afraid it was a very bad thing for
the bank to go into, and I still think
so, but nevertheless you are in now
and I am a-going to say that you are
a-going to come out all right on it. Los
Angeles has Improved marvelously and
this property you are interested in will
increase rapidly in value and you will
make money out oi it. I think Mr.
Sherman did wrong to work the Pacific
Bank into the scheme, but I know of
no one in the world who can come
nearer in working them out than he.
And I believe his entire energies are
at work in that direction. He is a
man of most wonderful resources, and
I think this will be one of the deals
that will go to the credit side of your
balance. I am, yours very truly.
D. M. TOMBLIN.
TOMBLIN URGED DICK TO FORCE THE
DYERS TO THE WALL.
On September 28, 1892, Tomblin took
the opportunity to characterize O. T.
Dyer and his sister. Miss E. C. Dyer,
with rather broad touches. He wrote
as follows:
"I do not think they are viciously dis
honest but have been driven into their
holes and are adopting tactics to stand
us off, and now that they know we are
after them at every turn they are going
to come out and do something. They
have been allowed to get into us, and
now they must be pounded over their
backs until they are out of the quick
sands and our load of coin delivered
over to us. We must not ease down on
them one bit. They are a great big
pair and won't pull a pound unless we
keep thumping them."
A few days later Tomblin character
ized them even in harder language and
wrote: "They cannot be handled with
kid gloves any longer. If we could only
get them on sale ground once, then we
could get in and press them for full
payment. I want to keep them moving
right along all the time. They are like
a pair of fat porkers. If you give them
a chance to lie down they will make
themselves altogether too comfortable,
and when they are hot we will turn
the hose on them and when cold and in
different will make a literal shield for
them."
[HE RIVERSIDE BANK WAS HOPELESSLY
INSOLVENT.
Two days later Tomblin wrote, still
discussing the Dyers: "I returned from
Riverside last night and found your
letter, and will say it is not a case of
love, but nevertheless Miss D. is a good
one,' and there is one person she is
afraid of and you are the individual.
This whole matter, I believe they can
be got through this month, and when
in our hands I think you should with
draw all support from them and let them
go. It is my opinion they are hope
lessly insolvent. Many of the notes are
worthless. The D. S. Dorn overdraft
of $35,000 represents right of way Â£or
a railroad that is now in the hands of
a receiver, which as an asset cannot
be counted for over $3500 and probably
not that. I am putting it mildly when
I say that their entire capital stock is
absorbed. I believe these are facts that
we will be compelled to face unless we
can set securities enough to slide out.
Their tendency is still to accommodate
their customers at all hazards, regard
less of your wishes."
On October 13 Tomblin was back
again in Madera and had the follow
ing to say about "Jayhawker," that ir
repressible individual who positively
declined to leave the schemers of the
P'aeittc Bank alone:
"I will run 'Jayhawker' in when I ar
rive at Los Angeles, if possible. He
was formerly a reporter on a Cincinnati
and Minneapolis paper and was run out
of that country on account of a similar
transaction. I have sent a tracer and
hope to be able to face him with mat
ters that will forever close his mouth.
The old saying to fight the devil with
fire will probably apply in his case.
How I do want to see you succeed in
all your undertakings. My whole heart
and soul is with you."
WAR AMONG THE CONSPIRATORS AT
THE JOHN BROWN COLONY.
In a letter dated October 15, 1892,
Tc-mblin indicates the first quarrel
among Dick McDonald's lieutenants at
the John Brown colony. The fact is
interesting, as the quarrel developed
Into a very serious affair before the end
had come and the Pacific Bank had
sunk over a quarter of a million dollars
In its Madera enterprises. When the
letter was written W. E. Johns had dis
charged George M. Mitchell and Tomb
lin tc-ok up the cudgel in Mitchell's be
half in the following letter:
MADERA, Oct. la, 1895.
R. H. McDoiiHld Jr., V. P.. San
Francisco.â My Dear Sir: I received
your telegram saying tottave Johns
discharge Mitchell. Now Tdo not an
ticipate then- will be any trouble in
getting rid of him. In fact I am in
clined to think he will be rather glad
to lay down his scepter as he is a
very quiet, good-natured fellow, un
obtrusive, yet faithful, and I am in
clined to believe that no one who is
familiar with the work he has done
can Justly charge him with unfaithful
ness and inability.
The young man, Johns, is a very
bright young fellow, but a boy still.
He, boy-like, loves honor and distinc
tion, which is all right, and so he has
represented himself to be vice-presi
dent of the J. B. colony. Now as I
do not care for that honor, although
elected to fill that honorable position,
I am quite willing to let my mantle
fall on some one of age and experi
ence, and I do think one Johns, like
unto the first, is enough. 1 am, yours
truly, D. M. TOMBLIN.
YOUNG JOHNS EMPLOYS A SONG AND
DANCE MAN AS SUPERINTENDENT.
Two days later Tomblin wrote: "Young
Johns came here last night prepared
to bounce Mitchell. 1 have told him
that I have thought it best to tell
Mitchell to have everything ready to
turn matters over November 1." On
the same day Tomblin declared: "Johns
told me he had employed a man by the
name of Fowler to take the place of
Mitchell at once. Now I do not know
anything in the world regarding the
capabilities of this party. He is a young
man working in a dry goods store here,
but I understand that he was formerly
engaged as a song-and-dance man and
is a horse jockey of some reputation,
and from all I hear it will be a terrible
mistake to intrust him with so impor
tant and responsible a pc-sltion. I am
afraid the young man Johns was not
deliberate sufficiently, although a pre
cocious lad. He is altogether too young
to direct in matters of such magnitude
and it will be very expensive to the cor
poration should he do so."
Writing from Los Angeles on Octo
ber 28, 1892, Tomblin declares in refer
ence to the motor road in Los Angeles:
"It looks to me as if the Southern Pa
cific Railroad Company has got an eye
on the property. Their man Fillmore
came to Riverside in his special car
over the motor road yesterday cm some
thing besides a pleasure trip."
TOMBLIN WANTED TO GO TO SACRA-
MENTO AS A LOBBYIST.
On December 1, 1892, Tomblin wrote a
letter that has an important bearing
on the events that accompanied the di
vision of Fresno County and the crea
tion of Madera County. When this di
vision waa first agitated Pick McDon
aid became very much interested. He
declared his willingness to- assist in
every way possible and made D. M.
Tomblin his agent in the matter. In
reference to the affair Tomblin wrote
as follows :
"There was a committee^ of Madera
; citizens waited upon me to see what we
j would be willing to give toward getting
! the county seat at this place. I told
i them that I thought we could do that
i proposition more good by acting as an
I independent committee, and if neces
j sary I would go to Sacramento when
I the Legislature convened and help
lobby the matter through. Further than
this I could not commit myself. I told
them I could satisfy them that the Pa
cific Bank would be toward the head
of the procession when it came to work
i for the county seat."
I BILLY ELMER " AND " SPIDER
KELLY RAN AMUCK IN FRESNO.
It was not long after this that D. M.
Tomblin elevated himself to a tower
; ing pedestal of morality and in right
i eous indignation reviewed what he con
sidered the scandalous escapades of W.
E. Johns and "Spider" Kelly. Mr.
Tomblin felt pained that he was called
upon to expose the actions of these men,
but in justice to his conscience and
in consideration of the interests of his
| employer, Dick McDonald, he con
! quered the pain and spoke out. Johns
j had become utterly unreliable, and the
j "Spider" was leading him as merry a
i dance as the tenderloin of Fresno af
forded after the lights go out at mid
night. As one reads Mr. Tomblin's let
ter it can be seen that he is sorely dis
tressed over the task of roasting Johns
and the others. It should be remem
bered in this connection that D. M.
Tomblin is not very unlike what they
call a hypocrite. His letter is as fol
lows:
MADERA, Cal., Dec. 5, 1892.
R. H. McDonald Jr., V. P., San Fran
ciscoâMy Dear Sir: I do not always
like to be quoted as a person that has
nothing but evil things to say of other
people, but as you have told me that
whenever things occur that cast reflec
tions on the fair name of the Pacific
Bank that it was my duty to tell them
and in this case I believe It is. While
In Fresno yesterday I heard that W.
10. Johns and "Spider" Kelly, a noted
pugilist, and our superintendent were
out on a lark and visiting houses of
bad repute, and while tit one of these
places got into a quarrel with another
crowd of fellows, which resulted in a
free-for-all fight. "Spider" Kelly and
Johns cleaned out the gang.
Young Johns is wholly and totally
unreliable and the sooner he is re
called the less trouble there will be to
overcome. He is not to be found when
wanted and he leaves no word with us
when he will be found. He has re
ceived telegrams to which he has not
replied and has gone off again with
"Spider" Kelly. I think to the city. I
wish you would send Dr. Jenningson
down here at once, as I don't know as
I have any authority in the matter, as
the young man has always called him
self vice president of the colony since
coming here, and I have supposed it
was by your authority. I don't think
It will be good policy to have the
young man under control here. There
is no reliance to be placed upon him.
This I am compelled to say after care
ful observation. T am. yours very
truly. D. M. TOMBLIN.
The Call will continue to-morrow
morning the publication of Mr. Tomb
lln's letters, carrying the correspond
ence of this man up to the time when
he became president of the Madera
Bank and attempted to evade the con
sequences of the crash in which the
Pacific Bank went down. In his letters
Tomblin reveals all the inside manipu
lations that involved the Pacific Bank
and its feeder, the People's Home Sav
ings Bank, in a loss of $300,000 in the
John Brown colony.

AGUINALDO AGAIN
PROCLAIMS HIS
INDEPENDENCE
Trying to Feel Surer of a Phil
ippiQe Republic by Claiming
Its ExisteQce.
Holds an Interesting Celebration in the
Nature of a " National Fiesta ' at
Malolos.
BY SOL N. SHERIDAN.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
MANILA, Oct. I.â Senor Don Emilio
Aguinaldo, President and Dictator of
the Republic of. the Philippines, has
once more proclaimed the independence
of his country. It strikes me, as an ob
server, that the Senor Don, for a man
who is altogether sure he has won the
liberty of the Filipinos, does proclaim
too much. Perhaps he feels surer, as a
man who lies from the lust of lying
comes presently to believe in himselfâ
perhaps, I say, Aguinaldo feels surer of
his republic the more often he asserts
its existence.
He did the trick of proclaiming, this
time, at his new capital, Malolos, on
last Friday. Rather an unlucky day,
Friday, for ships and republics to be
gin, but possibly Aguinaldo argued that
he has made so many false starts one
more or less could not make a great
deal of difference. At all events, he
started on Friday with a great flourish
of trumpets, sending invitations to his
celebration to the newspaper corre
spondents and to all the officers in the
army below the grade of general, along
with a programme in the way of a cir
cular calculated to commit to his inter
est all those Americans who should be
present at the function. This circular
kept most of the American officers
away from Malolos. It did not keep the
correspondents away. They could com
mit the nations to nothingâ and, if they
could, would not hesitate when it came
to a matter of procuring news. The in
vitations to the celebration I send here
with. The circular which accompanied
it, translated, reads as follows:
PROGRAMME.
âOfâ
National Fiesta for the 29th of Septem
ber, 1898.
In the Morning.
Firstâ Reunited at 9:30 a. m. the Con
gress in the house of the Honorable
President, with the authorities and
popular commissions, are invited to the
scene. The procession is to pass in re
view in the direction of the Congres
sional building, where they are received
by the courts and correspondents of his
high representation.
Second â Once inside the building
when every one has his respective seat,
the President of the Government will
give a lecture on the act, and the Presi
dent of Congress will give another on
the proclamation of independence.
Thirdâ The following act the Presi
dent proclaims the Philippines free and
independent. After the applause ceases
and the bells stop ringing the band will
play the national air.
Fourthâ The removal of the proces
sion to the house of the Government
will be in exactly the same form. The
driveway by which the procession will
proceed will be lined up with troops,
Brigadier General Gregorio H. del Pilar
commanding.
Fifth â The towns of Malolos and Bar
asvain will be admitted in the fiesta
this day. The houses must be decorated
and streets made tidy, as it becomes a
national holiday.
Sixthâ After the court returns to the
Congressional building there will be a
parade by the troops in front or the
principal balcony, where the President
of the Government and the President of
the Congress will be sitting alone. The
guard of Arabarderos will do the hon
ors to the Honorable President during
the parade.
Seventhâ After tho Inspection the
President will receive in his parlors the
consuls and commissions that wish to
celebrate and concur in the act.
Eighthâ A banquet will be given the
troops and bands that celebrate the act.
At Night.
At 9 o'clock in the evening theatrical
performances of the popular class.
The celebration itself did not amount
to a great deal. The village was crowd
ed with natives, and a number of
curious Americans were there who
went to see â and remained to be seen.
The whole thing was rather an absurd
imitation of European public functions,
born of a desire on the part of Aguln
aldo to make it appear to the world
that his people are perfectly up in the
manners of civilized nations and of a
mistaken notion that these manners
consist largely of dress coats and silk
hats of ancient vintage. Neither 'the
silk hat nor the dress coat, with all
true respect to the Dictator-President,
is the true badge of civilizationâ and
when one appears in a silk hat and
dress coat and goes barefooted, as one
of Aguinaldo's high officials did, the
effect, to put it mildly, is odd.
Senor Don Aguinaldo had his proces
sion, as he said he would. About 3000
natives variously armed and more vari
ously attired, passed in review, the
declaration of independence was for
mally read and the wheels of the Fili
pino Republic were started in due form.
It will run along, possibly, until the
meeting of the Paris Commission is
over, because nobody will pay a (Brreat
deal of attention to it. Then. If the
United States proposes to keep the isl
ands, Mr. Aguinaldo will be softly but
swiftly removed, the original mistake
of Admiral Dewey set right and the
whole structure will come tumbling
down like a house of cards.
I observe, on looking over this letter,
that I have used a phrase calculated to
puzzle the average American at this
particular time. The words, "the orig
inal mistake of Dewey," will naturally
pass the understanding of men. Dewey
Is a popular idol, naturally, and the
populace will never admit that its idol
can err. Nevertheless, Dewey di 1 make
an original mistakeâ led Into it. there
is not the least manner of doubt, by the
American Consul General at Hongkong,
Mr. Wildman. Mr. Wildmatji, as San
Francisco people know, is a genius in
his way. He is the man who took the
Overland Monthly and succeeded in
making it worse than it was beforeâ a
thing seemingly impossible, but true.
Mr. Wildman, I have every reason to
believe, is the man who persuaded the
Admiral to bring Aguinaldo down here
and give' him arms wherewith to annoy
the Spaniards pending the arrival of the
American expeditionary force. Now,
if Aguinaldo had never been brought
down here and given arms, there would
have been no proclamation of a Phil
ippine barefooted republic, no compli
cations with the Germans, no attempt
to force upon General Merritt an al
liance with an army of rag-tag and
bob-tailed murderers, whose sole Idea
of war was massacre, whose sole notion
of victory was loot, and who could not
be depended upon to stand fire, no awk
ward situation growing out of the per
fectly legitimate desire of the American
military governor to protect his Span
ish prisoners from murder, and Manila
would have fallen in any event when
ever the admiral saw fit to demand its
surrender. The city was wholly at his
mercy from the hour of his great vic
tory at Cavite. In fact, the Spaniards
to this day do not understand why he
did not go ahead and take the city at
that time. Also, if there had been no
Aguinaldo on the ground, the Spaniards
would have withdrawn just the same
from San Rogue, Cavite, Viejo, Bacoor,
Los Pinos, Paianoque and Tombo before
the advance of the Americans. The
withdrawal of the Spaniards into Ma
nila was in the nature of a concentra
tion, not at all due to the operations of
the insurrectors. That Spanish prison
ers were taken at the various places
was due to the fact that the Spaniards
were badly led, that the Spanish cam
paign directed from Manila was lacking
in intelligent direction and that the
Spanish soldiers, poorly fed, not paid
at all, disheartened by Montijo's de
feat, and in fear of the long knives of
the natives, preferred the chance of
prison to the chance of death after
their officers had deserted them.
The original mistake of Dewey, you
will see, was the mistake he made in,
bringing Aguinaldo down here at all.
That mistake having been made, the
surest way to correct it is to take
Aguinaldo away again â a thing more
easy of accomplishment, I fancy, than
appears on its face. ' An American reg
iment could go to Malolos and get him,
despite his cabinet and his ragamuffin
army â or, if the powers at Washington
disapprove extreme measures, he could
be bought off for a consideration rea
sonably small compared to the value of
the islands. The Spaniards tried that
plan with a measure of success. It is
true he did not stay bought, and per
haps would attempt to break faith with
the Americansâ but a residence at Hon
olulu, say, or the Dry Tortugas, would
have a strong tendency to discourage
any filibustering enterprise in which
he might wish to engage. As Dewey
made the original mistake there is not
the least doubt he would most cheer
fully agree to rectify it â and Dewey
could do, out here, whatever he saw
fit to do. With friend and foe alike, his
name is a name to conjure with.
I made a few remarks, in a recent let
ter to you, about General Greene. There
Is yet one more circumstance which
should be placed to this gentleman's
credit when the people of California
come to reckon with him for what he
has done to the boys from California.
When the boys were at Camp Dewey
Greene Issued an official order that sick
call should be held at 4:30 a. m., with
the result that men stricken with fever
or dysentery, if they wanted medical
attention, were forced to tumble out of
bed by candle light or were pulled out
by their comrades, with what result
even a layman can readily conjecture.
Very often, too, they were called out in
the Vain, sick or half sick, and stood in
line before the hospital tent, up to their
knees in mud and water, waiting their
turn to speak to the surgeon. That the
California regiment kept as healthy
as it did was due not at all to the care
given his command by the brigade
commander. The surgeons who exam
ined the men upon enlistment and
passed only the best are entitled to all
the credit. Of course the surgeons of
the California regiment protested at
this almost criminal order, but be a
regimental surgeon never so faithful
and efficient, his flat goes for little at
brigade headquarters. Dr. Farrell, for
instance, protested most strongly at
Camp Dewey against keeping men in
the waters of the bay all day, and Col
onel Smith forwarded the protest to
Greene. When the men of one boat's
crew were stricken with illness the
general, ignoring surgeon and colonel
alike, calmly sent for another detail for
boat duty. The California lads whose
health had failed in Manila can justly
lay to General Greene the fault that
their originally strong constitutions
have been undermined.
Speaking of men passed by the exam
ining surgeons, it is a pity those doctors
who examined the recruits for the
First California were not so particular
as the original examiners. When a re
cruit sent into the trying climate of
Manila has hemorrhage of the lungs on
his second day ashore there would ap
pear to be very grave fault somewhere.
"Sam" is dead. Every National
Guard officer in the State, every en
listed man. will remember "Sam," Col
onel Duboce's faithful man servant.
His proper name was William Guess,
and he was probably between 25 and
27 years old. A more willing, pleasant,
civil spoken colored lad never lived. He
was everybody's friend, even his own,
and nobody's enemy. He was a part
of the first expedition, a part of the
First California Regiment. He was
brave, too. as few men were brave. On
that awful night of the 31st of July
"Sam" followed Colonel Smith and Col
onel Duboce right into the trenches,
taking his baptism of bullets on the
firing line with the rest. When daylight
came it was "Sam " who hurried baclc
to camp to bring out the colonel's cof
fee before the relieving troops came.
Neither man nor officer ever asked a
favor of Sam and met refi 3al. He came
into Manila with the regiment, and he
died to-night, simply and suddenly in
the palace of Malacanan. The boy
slept on a cot in the balcony of the
room occupied by Colonel Smith and
Colonel Duboce. He had complained
during the afternoon of a severe pain
in his left breast, but h<? smiled with it
all and nobody could take "Sam's"
pains seriously. He did not take them
seriously himself. At a little after 11
o'clock Colonel Duboce heard the boy
groaning and heard him get up. The
groans grew more terrifying, and the
master hurried to the man's assistance.
It was then too late for human aid.
"Ram" died in the arms of Colonel Du
boce. and as I write two soldiers with
sad faces keep watch beside the body.

LAUNCH OF THE
TUG PAWTUCKET
Brilliant Event at Mare
Island.
SUCCESSFUL IN EVERY WAY
MILITARY AIR LENT TO THE
PROCEEDINGS.
Little Heather Baxter Does the
Christening â Gunboat York
town Is Placed in
Commission.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, Nov. 17.â The tug Paw
tucket, intended for use at Port Or
chard naval i itlon, was 'â¢ unched at
Mare Island this afternoon in the pres
ence of many people, including all the
workmen of the yard and hundreds of
visitors from Vallejo. A military air
â was lent to the proceedings by the
presence of a battalion of marines and
sailors from the barracks and war yes-
Beis under the c mmand of Lieutenant
Commander C. A. Adams.
The hour set for the launching was
8 o'clock, and at that time Commodore
J. C. Watson, commandant of the yard;
Commodore Albert Kautz, commanding
the Pacific squadron, and a number of
other naval officers and the ladies of
their fo lilies stood on a platform sur
rounding little Heather Baxter, the s
year-old daughter of Naval Construc
tor Baxter, who had been selected to
christen the tug.
The tug had been wedged up early in
the afternoon and was only held by a
few shores on the sides and the dog
Bhores on the cradle supporting the
vessel. Everything except the latter
â was cleared away and at 3 o'clock Con
structor Baxt - cut a wire supporting
a heavy weigl.t which knocked the dog
shores away and the tug began to glide
toward the water. At that moment
the dainty sponsor cried in a clear
voice, "I name thee Pawtucket," and
swung the btttle of wine against the
steel prow with a crash that shattered
it.
The tug gathered momentum as she
sped down the ways and dipping easily
as she entered the water floated grace
fully into the stream. She was greeted
with a deafening salute of steam
whistles and cheers which drowned the
sound of the two naval bands playing
"The Star-Spangled Banner," which
met the raising of the tug's flags as
she struck the water. The launch was
a complete success in every way and
Constructor Baxter, who superintend
ed it, was the recipient of warm con
gratulations.
The gunboat Yorktown was after
ward placed In commission under com
mand of Lieutenant Chauncey Thomas,
in the absence of Commander C. S.
Sperry. The ceremony was quite elab
orate. The following officers reported
for duty on the vessel: Lieutenants
Thomas. Minnett and Clarke, Ensigns
Standley. Knox and Wurtzbaugh, As
sistant Paymaster Perkins, Chief En
gineer Cleaver and Assistant Engineer
Snow. The other officers will report for
duty in a day or two.

Worked With the Aid of a Flashily

the Police Are Now
Looking.
i
The police have In custory a man who
they say is one of the cleverest shop
lifters that ever operated in this city.
Accompanied by another individual and
by a flashily dressed young woman the
trio, it is claimed, have systematically
robbed a number of wholesale houses,
their booty amounting to several thou
sand dollars. Their latest victims are
Murphy, Grant & Co.. wholesale dry
goods dealers at Bush and Sansome
streets.
A few days ago the clever trio entered
the store and after representing that they
were engaged in business in the interior,
announced that they were anxious to pur
chase a complete stock of silk goods. Onfe
of the clerks took them downstairs to the
silk department and showed them the
display. The woman temporarily left her
male companions and pretended to be ex
amining anoLher line of goods. A short
time afterward the trio left the store, af
ter apologizing to the clerk for causing
htm so much trouble, but promising to
return the following day and purchase
what they needed. A few minutes after
they had left one of the employes of the
firm discovered a number of pairs of
gloves which had been tossed behind a
barrel and suspecting something wrong
he informed one of the proprietors An
investigation was at once begun with the
result that it was found that the trio had
stolen about $3(W worth of silk floods. The
supposition is that the woman secreted
the stuff in her clothing unknown to the
employes. After having taken the gloves
it is believed she concluded that they
were not worth getting away with and
threw them aside. . .
The police were immediately notified ol
the robbery and Detective Tom Ryan was
detailed to make an Investigation, les
terday he arrested a dapper young man
named Collins and locked him up in the
tanks. He has been positively identified
as being one of the men who accompanied
the woman to the store. After being put
through the "sweating" process the pris
oner made a complete confession. He gave
the names of the woman und the other ac
complice and told where they had sold the
stolen property. Subsequently Ryan re
covered a portion of the stuff. He is- con
fident that he will be able to arrest the
woman to-day and probably the man. The
woman, it is said, is a well-known Eastern
operator, having served a term in the
penitentiary in New York for shoplifting.

STANFORD'S BIG
FOOTBALL RALLY
Encouragement for the
Varsity Team.
GIVEN A ROUSING SEND-OFF
GOES TO CONGRESS SPRINGS
TO-DAY.
Speeches Made by Professors, Alumni
and Gridiron Heroes to a
Great Throng in the
Chapel.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD. UNIVERSITY, Nov. 17.
âThe enthusiasm of students, which
has been daily increasing in intensity
as the big game approaches, reached
its culmination to-night in the biggest
football rally in the history of Stan
ford. If the fc >ling that the college ia
behind it to a man will do as much as
is supposed Stanford Varsity will ac-
complish wonders during its stay at
Congress Springs, where it goes to
morrow morning for its polishing
touches and its trick plays.
Long before the time for the rally
the chapel was filled compactly, the
crowd overflowing to the pavement
and quadrangle beyond. A section of
rioters under trained leaders and cap
tains served as a nucleus of the en
thusiasm, which was not confined alone
to male students. Co-eds, too, were af
fected by its irresistible wave and gave
vent to their feelings by
waving handkerchiefs and Stanford
colors.
President Schwartz of the Associated
Students presided. Speeches w ;re made
by Professors Branner and Fetter,
Coach Cross, Captain Fisher, football
heroes and prominent students and
alumni. Most of the speakers believed
the game would hs the closest and
hardest-fought contest seen on a grid
iron in years and insisted on the neces
sity lor untiring effor* at the springs.
After the exercises long lines of stu
dents paraded inside the quad and
finally ended on the football field,
where a bonfire was lighted. Football
songs were sung to popular airs, played
by the college band.
The men that Captain Fisher will
take to the training quarters, as an
nounced by Coach Cross to-ni^ht, are:
Quarters Murphy, Beckley, Erb
backs, Plate, Ciinton, Hill, Dole Dag

Bentley; tackles, Wilson, Rusk. Emer
son, Breckett. Webber, Faris; ends
McFadden, Nourse. Rice, Sell, Parker'
Smith.
At tho springs Coach Cross will de
vote his energies to developing line
men who are unseasoned and ignorant
of the finer points of the same. At
present Coach Cross believes Stanford's
center trio inferior to that of Berkeley
If the line can Xf developed Stanford's
chances will be vastly improved. The
practice work will be secret and held
in the morning and afternoon. The
alumni coaches who will assist Coach

FIFTEEN NEW SHIPS"
FOR AMERICA'S NAVY
Recommendation Made by the Naval
Construction Board to Secre
tary Long.
NEW YORK, Nov. 17.-A Washington
special to the Herald says: Secretary
Long has received from the Board of
Construction its recommendations respect
ing the increase of the navy which should
be authorized during the coming session
of Congress. The board urged that Con
gress be asked to make an appropriation
for the construction of threft battleship*
of 13,500 tons; three armored cruisers *I
12.000 tons; three second-clftss cruisers of
6000 tons and six third-class cruisers of
3000 tons.
Considerable misapprehension exists
with respect to the action of the Navy
Department in the matter of the construc
tion of monitors of 4000 tons Instead of
2700 tons. It has b<H>n intimated that the
board on construction, 1n order to pre
vent contracts being made for larger
ships, had Increased the thickness of the
protective deck to muke it impossible to
bui J vessels within the appropriation I
am Informed that the protective deck of
the proposed monitors will be only two

YALE'S FOOTBALL
TEAM SELECTED
Men Who Will Struggle
With Harvard.
TOWNSEND FOR FULLBACK
REPLACES McBRIDE, WHO IS
INJURED.
Captain Chamberlain Will Attend
to All the Punting and Kick
ing During the
Game.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW HAVE-*, Conn., Nov. 17.â Late
to-night it was learned that the definite
picking of the Yale football eleven has
been made. There were only three po
sitions about which there was any
doubt at all, the two halfbacks and
that of fullback. For the latter place
McÃride has been sent to New York
to be treated by a specialist, as his
ankle is getting worse. In his place
Townsend will doubtless ko in. Such
is the plan to-night. In punting and
all kicking Captain Chamberlain will,
however, act. For halfbacks Dudley
and Durston are picked out, Ely for
quarter-back, with Eddy and Hubbell
for ends, Chamberlain and Stillman for
tackles, Brown and Marshall for guards
and Cutten at center. Should Dudley
give out Corwin is the first substitute.
ITHACA, N. V., Nov. 17.â 1*ne com
petition for places on Cornell's varsity
team, which will line up against Penn
sylvania, will be very close and the
work of the candidates who are trying
for positions in and behind the line is
the best seen at Percy Field this year.
For fullback Starbuck, who was in the
Cornell-Princeton game, and Perkins,
the heavy fullback of last year's team,
are keeping up the struggle for the
place. To-day Perkins was favored by
the fact that hie opponent was not
able to work and he was kept in the
position during the hour's practice.
Will and Windsor are tryinc for right
halfback. Cross replaced Giimshaw at
right end to-day. Caldwell, it is be
lieved, will be put at center by the
end of the week and Wyvill is already
buoked to play at left tackle. It Is
doubtful if Alexander will be out in
time for the game. Quarter-back
Young's position was filled by ; ..ort of
the scrub eleven.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 17.â 1n the
absence of Coach Woodruff Captain
Outland took charge of the University
of Pennsylvania football team to-day.
All the men were out except Overfield
and McMahon. Overfield is still con
fined to his bed with an attack of the
grip and it is possible that he may not
be able to ' play again this season
Should this be the case McCloskey will
probably take his place in the Cornell
game on Thanksgiving day and Smith
may be given a chance at fullback.
McMahnn's ankle, which he wrenched
yesterday, is causing much pain, and if
he should be unable to take part in
the big game Hodge will probably play
left end. The men who are more or
less ailing are Ruegenberg, Garnett
Gardiner, Coombs, Hedges and Mc-
Cracken.
CHOYNSKI AND RUHLIN
PRACTICALLY MATCHED
NEW YORK. Nov. 17. -Joe Choynski
and Gus Ruhlin have been practically
matched to fight twenty rounds at the
Lenox Athletic Club about December 26
Ever since they fought in Philadelphia
three weeks ago, when Ruhlin had the
advantage, the men have been in great
demand all over the country for a return
match. Billy Madden has received an
offer of 60 per cent from the Toledo Club
but Ruhlln's manager says he would
rather have the match come off in New
York. Tom O'Rourke would like to have
the bout take place at hie club and he
will offer a purse for the contest.

Britain.
LONDON, Nov. 17.â The Marquis of
Lansdowne, Secretary of State for War,
speaking at Plymouth this morning on
general politics, referred to his gratifica-
tion over the Anjjlo-Amerlean friendship.
In the course of his speech he sketched
the proposed large scheme of improving
the. home defenses by providing a new

the Government had completed Its scheme
the country would be prepared for the

MADEBA'S CELEBRATED CASE
Merrill Convicted of Assault With
a Deadly Weapon.
MADERA, Cal., Nov. 17.â 1n the Su
perior Court this evening William Merrill
was convicted of an assault with a deadly
weapon, the jury being out an hour and
a half. Merrill was charged with assault
with intent to commit murder. On the
30th of last Jii!y Merrill and his brother
in-law, A. B. Evans, engaged in a quarrel
as the result of a family feud of some
three years' standing, Merrill firing sev
eral shots at Evans while the latter was
sitting in a wagon, none of them taking
effect.
Evans then proceeded to his home, a
half mile distant, procured a Winchester
rifle and returned to the Merrill residence
to fulfill a threat to take Merrill's life.
Merrill, who had concealed himself in his
barn, saw Evans approaching with the
gun in his hand, tired through a crack in
tlu side of the barn, the ball entering
Evans' abdomen just below the navel, re
sulting In his death two days later.
The case was one of the most sensa
tional that has occurred in this county
since its organization. Special counsel In
the person of District Attorney-elect R.
R. Fowler was employed to assist Dis
trict Attorney Larew, while J. M. Mc-
Swain of Mverced, for the defendant, was
assisted by K. L. Hargrove of this city.
The defendant was not tried for the kill
ing, but for the shooting at Evans while
the latter was unarmed. The jury re
duced the charge, which lightened the
penalty from fourteen to two years. The
case will be appealed.
TRINITY COUNTY LAND DEAL.
Important Purchase by a New York
Syndicate.
REDDING, Nov. 17.-A New York syn
dicate, represented by Sam H. Rice, a
civil and mining engineer of Ukiah, has
purchased 18,000 acres of land in Trinity
County from the Merritt estate of Oak
land. The first payment was made on
the 15th inst., the purchase price being
$250,000.
There is a grea f . deal more In this trans
fer than is apparent on the surface. The
late W. P. Merritt and a man named
Fenton original^ bought the land for
grazing' purposes, and when a survey of
the county line i;as being made, a de
posit of copper bearing ore 1200 feet long
by 70 feet wide was discovered on the
property. Tests of the ore have returned
values of from ;) to IS per cent copper, $5
to $10 gold and $3 to 510 silver. This was
the Inducement which impelled the New
York people to buy.
Development of the copper mine will be
begun at once by putting to work a large
force of men. The acreage lies in the
southwestern portion of Trinity County
In the Horseshoe Bend ofEel River,
twenty-five miles from the line of the
proposed Ukiah and Eureka railroad.
Fourteen hundred head of cat,tle were
included In the sale. The property is as
sessed in Trinity County for &0,000.
DESTROYED HERSELF
WITH CARBOLIC ACID
SUICIDE OF MRS. CELIA BODE
WHILE DESPONDENT.
Her First Husband Killed Himself
and Her Second Matrimonial Ven
ture Proved Most Unhappy.
Mrs. Cella Bode swallowed a dose of
carbolic add in the lodging house, 1146
Folsom street, yesterday morning, and
died shortly after in the Receiving Hos
pital. The body was removed to the
Morgues Mrs. Bode's first husband was
a mining man, who committed suicide in
Montana by shooting himself while de
spondent over his failures in mining deals.
She married Bode soon after, but the
couple did not get along well together,
and of late she had been living with her
sister on Zoe street.
About a week ago she left her sister's
house and went to live at the lodging
house on Folsom street where Mrs. O'Con
nor, an old friend, had a room. She
drank considerable liquor and seemed
tired of life. She told Mrs. O'Connor that
she would rather kill herself than go
tack to live at her sister's house, and
when she learned yesterday morning that
her sister had discovered her whereabouts
she went into Mrs. O'Connor's room and
swallowed the contents of a bottle of
carbolic acid that Mrs. O'Connor had for
medicinal purposes. Then she ran down
stairs to a saloon under the lodging house
and fell on the floor. The ambulance
was summonÂ«d and she was taken to the
hospital.
There were marks on her face and
hands which Dr. Weil thought had been
c-aused by rough usage, but Mrs. O'Connor
declared she had sustained them in fall
ing after she had swallowed the poison.
Her appearance qhowed that she had
been on a debaucri. She was about 32
years of age.
J. Vietheer, a brother-in-law of Mrs.
Bode, visited the Morgue last evening
and identified the remains. He stated
that the husband of the woman is still
living, but his whereabouts is not known.
Her first husband committed suicide some
time ago, and shortly afterward the
woman married Mr. Bode. The couple
parted after being married a few
months. Mr. Bode went north on a
whaling cruise, and the last heard of him
be was in Europe.
DISGRACED HIS CLOTH.
Another Chapter in the Life of the
Rev. Donald M. Ross, Minister.
Donald M. Ross, the disgraced Presby

ceived^ reply that the books were in the
basement of the Lebanon Presbyterian
Church, Twenty-third and Sanchez

Ross acknowledged in his letter that he
was a defaulter to the extent of $600, and
was glad to get away from this city. He

CRAZED BY ILL HEALTH.
Charles Ostiund Sends a Bullet
Through His Brain, in the Pres
ence of His Daughter.
Charles Ostiund committed suicide
shortly after 1 o'clock yesterday after
noon by shooting' himself through the
mouth with a pistol, in the kitchen of his
residence back of his saloon at 800 Third
street. His daughter had gone into the
yard for the purpose of performing some
household duty and when she returned to
the door of the kitchen she heard the
report of a pistol and saw her father ly
ing dead on the floor with the weapon
clutched in his hand. Ostiund had con
ducted the saloon for the past fifteen
years. He had been ill for a long time
and was despondent because of that fact.
He leaves a widow and seven children.
Professor Jordan's Lecture.
Professor David Starr Jordan delivered
the last of a series of three lectures be
fore the Unity Club last night. His sub
jtct was "The Struggle Against Drink."
He spoke of the extraordinary efforts
made to exterminate the pernicious drink
liti.it. "Individual effort," he said, "ac
complishes a great deal in that direction.
Temperance lectures -had only a tempo
rary effect, as they appeal to the feelings,
which are liable to reaction. An appeal
to the better side of an individual, his
manhood, was effectual. The Salvation
Army was doing a great deal in the strug
gle against drink by giving the drinking
man something to do, and so saving him
from remorse, which tended to drive him
back to his evil ways. High license and
the regulation of the sale of liquor alao
had their good points. The scientific tem
pjerance as advocated by the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union was not as
effective as it might be."

A NOTED POLITICAL ECONOMIST.
Professor Vigouroux on His Way to
Paris With Data Concerning
Labor Problems.
Professor Louis Vlgouroux, a French
political economist of distinction, arrived
here from Australia on the Moana and
is registered at the Lick.
He is one of twenty representatives of
the Musee Social of Paris, now engaged
in collecting data concerning labor and
social questions in all parts of the world.
"It is our object," said Professor Vig
ouroux yesterday, "to gather a library of
reliable information regarding the indus
trial classes of the world which are not
conlined to any section or nation, but will
be available to all; to have at hand data
and full Information concerning the con
ditions existing In all countries; and to
endeavor to reduce all of the social ques
tions that have disturbed and are dis
turbing the thinkers of to-day to an exact
science."
"How did the Idea originate?"
"It was the practical result of the Ex
position of Social Economy, held in con
nection with the Paris Exposition of 1889.
Statistics, pamphlets and full details of
experiments in problems of social inter
est were then available, and the informa
tion was so valuable and interesting that
the Musee Social was formed to continue
the work thus begun. That institution
took over all the exhibits and established
a library, open to all, and it has received
many valuable additions since. Neither
politics nor religion enters into the con
sirifrations of the society. Consideration
is given to all matters of common inter
est, as the benefits of co-operation, the
extension of a system of co-operative
credit, by which money Is lont to mem
bers; the establishment of what are really
agricultural banks, and similar matters.
"The members of the society include
some of the largest landholders in France.
It is certain that the project would never
have been realized had it not been for
the generosity of the Count of Chambrun.
Very rich, nearly blind and without chil
dren, he has devoted the greater part of
his fortune to the foundation of the
Musee. Besides paying its running ex
penses, he has presented it with a piece
of property on the Rue Las Cases worth
$300,000."
Professor Vigouroux is returning to
Paris this way in order to obtain data
for completing his report on thlÃ country's
social problems.
He will subsequently finish his reports
on New Zealand, Australia and South
Africa, and the result of his entire labors
will be exhibited in the department of
social economy at the Paris Exposition
in 1900.
Captain Blame's Fake.
Collector Jackson has been informed by
the Secretary of the Treasury- that Cap
tain James G. Blalne, who told a New
York Evening Sun reporter that he had
succeeded in smuggling several thousand
cigars on the United States transport
steamer Newport, on her arrival here
from Honolulu two months ago. had been
obliged to pay the duty on his fake story.
Surveyor Spear said yesterday that cus
toms officials are not required to go on
board United States war vessels or trans
ports, but that his men, as a precaution,
searched Captain Elaine's baggage as
well as that of the others officers on the
Newport, and failed to discover any
smuggled good*. He was of the opinion
that Captain Blame paid the duty in
Washington rather than acknowlege thai
he had told the Sun reporter a fake story.

Chief of the Bureau oÂ£ Yards and
Docks Submits Estimates
for the Next Fiscal
Year.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 17.â 1n his an
nual report to the Secretary of the
Navy, Chief Endicott of the Bureau of
Yards and Docks makes a strong point
of the necessity for ample docking fa
cilities, not only for small vessels but
for the battle-ships, upon the waters
near Key West.
Under the head of coaling stations
the report tells what has been done
toward securing a station at Pago-
Pago on the island of Tutuilla, Samoa,
showing that the United States has
acquired fifteen acres of land at Swim
ming Point and Observatory Point and
has contracted for a steel pier, coal
shed and other improvements neces
sary to store 5000 tons of coal and other
iep.
The report states that the United
States haa come into possession of the
: San Juan and a naval arsenal.
The estimates of the various navy
yards for the next fiscal year are as
s: Portsmouth, N. H., $306,000;
Mass., ?367,000; New London,
Conn., $25, <; New York, $612,000;
Bland, Pa., $755,978; Washing
â  $205,000: Norfolk, Va.,
'$1,500,000 being for a new
i; Port Royal, S. C, $145,000; Key
West, $112,520; Mare Island, $851,750;
3 . :.d. $53,500.
Treating- of this last station, Puget
S.iund, Chief Endicott says if it be im
portant to equip a first-class naval
station in that vicinity, a new site
should be selected, for the present has
none of the desiderata of a good naval
station. There is no near-by popula
tion to draw upon for skilled labor; no
available market and no direct rail
road connection with a trunk line.
Under these conditions, it is said to be
doubtful if it be wise to build a large
station at this point.
The report also comments upon the
fact that no battle-ship or heavy
draught cruiser has yet approached
the wharves at Mare Island, and says
it remains to be demonstrated that this
precious location as a navy-yard was a
fortunate one. Attention is called to
the fact that the Oregon was com
peUed to go 800 miles north to Pue-et
Sound to be docked. While the Gov
ernment could construct ample dock
facilities on San Francisco Bay this
would still be 450 miles north of the
southern boundary of the United
States, where it is quite as important
to have a naval station as on the
northern boundary at Puget Sound
Therefore it is recommended that a
board of experineced officers be direct
ed to give attention to the establish
ment of such a station near the south
ern limits of the Pacific coast.
The total estimates of the bureau for
tne next fiscal year aggregate $6,347 4^l
RECIPROCITY TREATY

regarded as of most importance, namely
antic fisheries and reci

tically taken up for the first time, and it
[Uite definitely understood that the

enlarged rights to American fishermen in
Canadian waters of the North MJantic
if in return Canadian fish are admitted

American Commissioners are likely to in
sist, as a preliminary to any reciprocity
that Canada shall wipe out that feature
of her tariff law winch gives Great Brit
ain a preference of 25 per cent on sll
tariff duties If this important conces
sion Is made by Canada and concurred in
by Lord Herschel. who is looking aftr-r
the interests of Great Britain, it is said
a reciprocity list probably will be agreed
upon.
Without the abolition of preferential
rates to Great Britain the opinion is very
positively expressed that a reciprocity
agreement cannot be reached.
The American Commissioners feel that
If they can succeeed in having this Brit
ish preferential stopped it will be greater
than any reciprocity agreement. The de
bate thus far has encouraged the Ameri
can Commissioners to believe that they
will succeed in having this preferential
wiped out.
TWO LIVES LOST ON
A SINKING SCOW
Alaskan Argonauts Perish in a
Yukon River Disaster at
Fifty Mile.
VICTORIA. Nov. 17.-The Dirlgo has
arrived from Alaska with ninety passen
gers, thirty from Dawson. They tell of
the sinking of a scow near Fifty Mile, liy
which two lives and fifty tons of pro
visions were lo?t. Tho rtver is still open
and some think the steamer Willie Irvine
will get up from Dayraon.
The ill-fated scow left Bennett on Sep
tember 21. There were four men on herâ
her owners. Smith & Galloway of Skag
;md two prospectors, whoso names
were never learneu. but who, according
to Galloway, hailed from California The
voyage went smoothly until White Horse
Rapids were reached. In the rough usage
thÂ»Â» craft got by those troublesome waters
bet scares parted and she had aJI but
I'-red before those on her managed
ich her. Repairs were made to her
and tht journey down the river was re
sumed.
At the Fifty Mile Rapids, however, more
trouble awaited the heavily laden scow
Wn..e she was rushing through the rapids
she foundered, her seams having again
parted. Seeing that the scow was a com
plete loss, the four men sprang into the
icy waters and made for the river bank.
Smith and Galloway reached the shore in
safety, but the two other unknown min
ers were swept to death.
Some of the Klondikers who came down
on the Dirigo say that when they left
Dawson on October 20 it was thought
that two men and a woman had been
burned to death in the big fire of October
14. The two men. whose names Tne Call's
informants were unable to give, have been
missing since the conflagration.

BOSTON, Nov. 17.â Senator Lodge, In
an address at the Boston Boot and Shoe
Club's banquet last night, said:
I come now to what I think the Govern
ment ought to do. The success of the
English-speaking race, which has carried
it all over the world and made it the great
industrial and commercial people or tht>
earth to-day, has been duo to the principle
of self-help. But there are certain
things whirh the spirit of American en
terprise must look to the Government to
do.
You cannot expect men to carry your
products and to extend your trade by es
tablishing themselves in a distant portion
of the earth unless you have a Govern
ment that is ready to protect them at all
times and at all hazards.
We want no commerce at the cannon's
mouth, but we do want it understood
that wherever an American is engaged
in business there he is to be protected,
and that thtre is a navy of the United
States big enough to guard him wher
ever he sees fit to go. Therefore, I say
that we- need a large navy as a protection
! to commerce on the sea as well as on the
i land.
The question that confronts us is a
larger one than what we shall do with tne
Philippines. They say we are not an
m power unless we hold those is
lands. We are to-day the greatest power
in the Pacific Ocean. We hold one en
tire side of that ocean except the outlet
which England has to China. We houl
the half-way house in Honolulu, where all
: sh<ps must stop when the Nicaragua
canal is built, as it will be. Are we going
io allow the ports of the east to be clpsea
to us and open to Russia, France and Ger
| many alone? Or are we going to stand up
t and say with England and Japan, me
! ports of China must be c?osed to all or
they must be open to all?
It is going to be a struggle, in my judg
ment, between the maritime nations and
the non-maritime nations. It is going to
be a struggle to see whether the people
who speak the English tongue are to go to
the wall or whether they are to have their
share in the commerce of the earth where
ever they fly their flag. I believe that the
United States is entitled to its share of
the world's commerce. I do not believe
that we should be shut out from it and
I do not think that there is the least dan
ger of war anywhere if we are far-sight
ed enough to make known to the world
just what we want and just what we in
tend to do. Let our Government have wis
dom in its foreign policy and its treatment
of our merchant marine and the genius of
American invention and enterprise will
do the rest.
MATTHEWS GUILTY
OF MANSLAUGHTER
Milpitas Constable Who Killed
Young Hopken Recommended
to Mercy of the Court.
SAN JOSE. Nov. 17.â John Matthews,
who while Constable at Milpitas killed
Henry Hopken. was to-day found guilty
of manslaughter. He was recommended
to the mercy of the court. Judge Lori
pan will pronounce sentence on Novem
ber 28.
Matthews' crime was committed while
h? was drunk and was a cold-blooded one.
Public feeling was greatly stirred up over
it On the night of the killing Matthews
was drinking in Pancera's saloon on the
Milpitas road. A whip and coat were
stolen from his buggy, and the officer
started down the street looking for the
thief. He came across Hopken, a 19-year
old boy. who was visiting in the neigh
borhood. Matthew? accused him of tak
ine the coat and whip. This he denied.
and, according to Matthews, started to
run when the officer shot mm through
the 'head. Matthews claimed he merely
fired to frighten the boy, and did not in
tend to hit him.
ThiÂ». story is not generally believed. It
is believed that the officer drove up along
side" him and shot him without a word of
warning.
MRS. VAN ALSTINE NOW
SUES FOR A DIVORCE
Sequel to the Romantic Marriage,
Desertion and Subsequent
Reconciliation.
SEATTLE, Nov. 17.â The filing of R
complaint for divorce in the King County
court to-day is a sequel to the celebrated
Van Alstlne case. In January last Con
Van Alstine married his present wife and
later went to the Klondike. He returned
on the first trip of the St. Paul to San
Francisco, wuere he was joined by his
'â¢Lou," and together they Journeyed to
New York. She soon tired of him and
skipped to London, carrying away a con
siderable portion of Con's $30. W0. He fol
lowd her and a reconciliation ensued.
They returned to America and arrived in
Seattle on November L
In praying that n divorce be granted
her, Mrs. Van Alstine alleges that her
husband is insanely jealooa of her and
has so often threatened bodily injury that
she fears for her life. Shr-' states that
that Con has mining property valued at
$2ii0,000 on Bonanza Creek. The court is
asked to order that she be paid $1000 in
order to conduct the suit.
Monday n^xt has been tixf-1 as the date
for Van Alstine to show cause why he
should not comply with this demand.

Payday Causes Homesickness at the }
Benicia Barrackr.
WOODLAND, Nov. 17.â Wednesday was
payday at the Benicia barracks. During
the evening twenty or twenty-five soldiers
le?t camp without leave. Among the
number were eight or nine members of
the Colusa company. Captain Ford sur
mised that his men would probably take
a trip home, so he went to Davisville,
and at that place found six of the men,
who, it seems, went to Sacramento
Wednesday evening, and when inter
cepted were on their way to Colusa.
They were turned over to the Davisville
officers for temporary keeping.
â¢ \aptain Ford learned that one of his
mt n was on the Knights Landing train.
He came to this city, and was rewarded '
for her trouble by finding another man on |
the Colusa train and also by overtaking
the poldler who left the Knights Landing
train at this place. He returned to Be
nicia barracks with his prisoners this
afternoon.
One of the soldlerÃ complained of the
treatment received at the barracks. He
said the boys were refused furloughs and I
determined "to take French leave and visit I
their homes. He also said that about 100
men left in that manner Wednesday even-

RAPID GROWTH OF
OUR COMMERCE
America's Trade With
the World.
EXPORTS STEADILY INCREASE.
TREASURY BUREAU'S INTER
ESTING STATISTICS.
Year Just Ended Makes the Lowest
Record of Imports, With a
Single Exception, Since
the Year 1879.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Nov. 17.
The tide of international commerce
turned in favor of the United States in
the centennial year, 1576. Prior to |
: that date the balance of trade against |
; us had been (beginning with 1789) $2,-
I 236,405,610. Since that date the balance
', of trade in our favor has been $3,091,
! 440,952. In the eighty-seven years' ope
1 ration of the Government prior to that !
date it witnessed but sixteen occasions j
I in which the annual balance of trade '
; was in its favor; in the twenty-three ]
j years since that time it has witnessed ;
but three occasions in which the an
! nual balance of trade has been against
1 it. In the eighty-seven years prior to
1876 the exports amounted to $12,309,- j
653,384, an average of $141,000,000 per '
annum, while the imports amounted to
114,546,994,000, an average of $167,000,000 ,
per annum. In the twenty-three years |
since 1876 the exports amounted to j
$18,662,344,445, an average of $811,000,000
per annum, and the imports amounted j
to $15,570,903,493, an average of $677,000,- i
000 per annum. It will thus be seen j
that in the twenty-three years since \
1575 our exports ha-> -- actually been |
more than 50 per cent In excess of those '
of the entire eighty-seven years prior j
to 1576, and that the average annual |
exportation since 1876 has been nearly ]
six times as much as the average an- j
nual exportation prior to that time.
A recent publication by the Treasury
Bureau of Statistics, entitled "imports
and Exports of the United States, and
Receipts and Expenditures of the
United States Government," presents
the figures of our imports and exports
running back to 1835, and the receipts
and expenditures running back to 1856;
and by supplementing these with ear
lier official data, the full record of the
110 years of our commerce may thus
be had. Prior to 1835 there were but
three occasions in which the annual ex
ports reached $100,000,000, and but nine
occasions in which the imports
reached that sum, so that the years
covered by the publication in question
comprise the most important of
our commercial history, presenting, as
it does, the figures by years from 1835
down to and including 1898, and by
months from January, 1884, to August,
1898.
A detailed study of these figures pre
sents some extremely interesting facts
regarding our commerce with other
parts of the world. Prior to 1834 the
exports never reached $100,000,000 an
nually, save in the exceptional years
of 1806 and 1807, while after the year
1834 they never fell below the $100,
000,000 line, save in the exceptional year
1842. By 1853 they reached the $200,
000,000 line; by 1860 the $300,000,000 line;
by 1870 the $400,000,000 line; in 1873 they
passed tha $500,000,000 line; in 1878 they
exceeded $600,000,000; in 1879 thp - were
more than $700,000,000; in 1880 more than
$800,000,000; in 1881, for the first time
the $900,000,000 was reached; in 1892 the
billion dollar liite was for the first time
crossed, and in 1898 the figures were
$1,231,482,330. Thus the exports of IS9B
are practically double those of 1887,
four times those of 1878, and almost ten
times as much as those of 1848, in which
year they were $138,190,515.
The growth of imports, while neces
sarily great by reason of increased pop
ulation, has not kept pace with that of
exports, especially in the last quarter
of a century. The $100,000,000 line in
the import trade was passed as early
as 1801, and again in 1805, 1806 and 1807,
and at intervals unttl 1844, when the
total of $102,604,606 was followed by a
rapid growth, the $200,000,000 line being
passed in 1851, the $300,000,000 line in
1856, the $400,000,000 line in 1866, the
$500,000,000 line in 1871, while 1872 ex
ceeded $600,000,000, 1882 exceeded $700,
000,000 and 1891 passed the $800,000,000
line, the high water mark of imports
being reached in 1893, when the figures
were $566,400,922. while the year just
ended, 1898, makes a lower record of
imports than any year with a single ex
ception since 1579.
The figures covering the receipts and
expenditures are equally interesting.
Prior to 1800 the total net ordinary re
ceipts of the Government never reached
as much as $10,000,000. practically the
entire sum then being collected from
customs. They ranged steadily up
ward from that time until by 1826 they
had passed the $25,000,000 line, b- 1851
the $50,000,000 line, by 1857 the $75,000,
000 line, and in 1863, for the first time,
passed the $100,000,000 mark, increasing
rapidly by reason of the necessary col
lection of war revenues, until in 1866
they were $519,949,564, dropping again
below the $300,000,000 line after the war,
but ranging from $300,000,000 upward
since 1880, the average receipts (aside
from war revenue) at present being
$365,000,000 per annum, or a million dol
lars a day, while the average expendi
tures (omitting war Items) are about
the same.
WITNESS IN CONTEMPT.
Sensation in the Nevills Extortion
Trial â Prosecution Has a
Strong Case.
The trial of Elsie Williams. Grace Loose
and Myron Azhderian, charged with ex
tortion, opened yesterday morning with
a scene that was little less than exciting.
Judge Cook discovered that, notwith
standing his orders that all witnesses in
the case should remain away from the
court room until called, J. Azhderian, a
brother of the defendant, had remained
in the room during the first two days of
the trial. Judge Cook immediately de
clared the disobedient witness in con
tempt of court and fined him $100 with an
alternative of 5 days in jail. Counsel for
the prosecution addressed I^ie court on be
half of Azhderian, stating that his action
had been Innocent in intent, and Judge
Cook revoked his order.
Captain Nevills then took" the stand and
completed his story of his intimacy with
Elsie Williams, how he had paid her $2uOO
and advised her to get ria of the "Arme
nian." meaning Azhderian. William E
Nevills Jr. was next called. He corrobo
rated Captain Nevills" story, and told how
Azhderian had told him that if Dolan had
not squeeled Captain Nevills would have
been "disposed of," and his property
claimed under forged checks. When the
witness left the stand the case was con
tinued until 2 oViock to-day.

STORIES TOLD
BY SCHOOL
BOARD BILLS
Ragan's Brother to
the Front.
HIGH PRICE FOR A BUGGY
TOO MUCH FOR EVEN WALLEiI
AND BURNS TO STOMACH.
Blacksmithing Comes High, but the
Directors Do Not Hesitate to
Invest Liberally Right
Along.
Those claims against the School Depart- j
ment now in the hands of the Auditor, !
| when carefully scrutinized, make some j
i remarkable disclosures. They tell of j
I favorites heavily played and invariably
winning at the expense of the taxpayers; j
of evasions if not actual violations of i
the law, .and of charges for trivial arti- i
cles that would put to blush the most j
! hardened convict wearing stripes.
It would appear from these claims that
as determined an effort had been made to ,
I bankrupt the City Treasury as the Mc- j
Donalds and their pals made to loot the I
Pacific and People's banks; that the for- !
mer effort was not as successful as the ;
other is due to the fact that the city's i
funds were not as limited as the . banks. j
One 'of tne most suspicious accounts ;
awaiting settlement is that of Ragan &
Schlegal, carriage repairers and black- j
smiths. The senior member of the firm
is a brother of Dr. Ragan, the School Di
rector, which relationship may have much '
to do with the heavy bills the firm is con- j
stantly presenting, not alone against the
School Department but against the mu
nicipal branches as well.
There are several claims of Ragan &
Schlegal now awaiting the Auditor's sane- i
tion, and one of them bears evidence that
even such members of the board as Wal- '
ler and Burns considered the charge ex- j
cessive. This claim is for a new buggy ;
purchased for the department on October j
27 1897. Naturally, the first question that
arises in the mind of â¢ the investigator
is, why the board should purchase a new j
buggy from Ragan & Schlegal. wagon re- ;
pairers and blacksmiths, instead of going
to some regular carriage repository where j
it would be likely to save a middle man (
profit. But no satisfactory solution of the
problem presenting itself, the searcher !
turns to the price, $ISO, and reflects that
the middleman's profit was not to be j
sneezed at. Tnen he notices that the
original price of $180 has been scaled
to $165 by Messrs. Burns and Waller of
the Finance Committee, and the mind be
gins to ponder on the freak that induced
those two members to save the city $15.
Had the bill been increased that amount ,
it would seem perfectly consistent with
the record of the board, but to have them
shave a bill is beyond comprehension and
a vision of a $75 buggy, a bill for $180 and
two conscience smitten School Directors ;
presents itself. S> : . _Â£.' .
This vision becomes plainer when pro- !
ceeding with his investigation the search
er finds another bill from ' Ragan & ;
Schlegal dated February 9. IS9B (less than
four months after the purchase of the
buirtrv) for $28 25' for "repairs on tools ana
buggy." The itemized bill is as follows: ,
Jan. 22-Steellng 2 picks. *2 00 !
Jan. Steeling 2 picks \Â£>

Crossbar in shafts .."."..'. 2 60
Steel bar â¢ 1 <Â£ ;

Total J2525
But if this bill makes a practical black
smith fcasp. what will he do when he
rÂ£ads the items in Ragan & Schlegal's bill
of January 7, 1898, which are as follows:
Dec. R-8 hooks. 1-6 bolts and washers.... slo 00
Dec. 13â1 hook J "}
Dec. 24_6 irons and bolts for gates 10 00
4 bolts *>
Shaft string W
Dec. 30â Handles for 4 plugs w w
Total W B9O
That is what the total reads If one
will take the trouble to foot up the Items
he will find they amount to $32 90 or $6 00
less than the total on the bill. But one
does not mind a slight discrepancy like
that in the totals when rapt in admiring
contemplation of the various charges.
Chesney & Co. have the contract for
doing carpenter work for the department,
but that does not signify that they are to
do all the work. At least it ought not.
for there is a statute requiring the board i
to advertise for bids for all work amount
ing to $200 or more. It is an inspiring
string of claims presented by Chesney &
Co on July 24 last that impels one to ask
if the board invariably obeys the law in j
this respect, or if it has found a neat :
means of evasion by which it can play
favorites. These claims of Chesney &
Co are as remarkable as any to be
found, for this reason: There are six of
them all of the same date, and ail for
$197 and $198, just within the $200 limit. The
surprising part is that Chesney & Co.
could perform six separate jobs for the
department at the same time and all for
the same amount. There is nothing to
show where the work was performed,con
sequently it is only natural that the sus
picion should arise that Chesney & Co.
had been given some job amounting to
something like $1100 and the bill split up in
this fashion to hoodwink the casual ob- j
server into believing that the law had
been duly respected.
These are some of the minor claims the
Board of Education expects to have paid,
but they furnish quite as Interesting a
study as do the larger claims.
And there are many more of them, big
and little.

TOUGh| SCHOOL DIRECTORS.
SOME years ago the School Department was
afflicted with a set of Directors who earned the
designation of "Tough old board." The
members were mostly politicians who , had sought
their offices for the purpose either of making places
for would-be teachers or securing a profit on contracts
awarded by the board. As with the present Directors,
the members of the "tough old board" were Demo
crats, many having, prior to election, been of the
"reform',^ variety â loud demandants of low taxation
and honesty in public office.
In its time the "tough old board" aroused much
indignation in and out of the School Department.
The newspapers particularly became white in the face
after every meeting in a fruitless endeavor to record
in cold type the infamies perpetrated by the Directors.
We doubt, however, whether the "tough old board"
was comparable in toughness to the present band of
reform Democrats who are running the School De
partment. The former looted the school fund, con
cluded collusive contracts, packed the department
â \\ iih useless teachers and turned the carpenter-shop
over to Butkley: but in the light of the operations
of the present board the achievements of the "tough
old board" seem conservative and respectable.
The tough band of Democratic reformers who for
two years have been engaging public attention as man
agers of the schools have not only looted the school
fund, concluded collusive contracts and packed the
department with unnecessary teachers, but they have
corrupted grand juries, sold their votes to the highest
bidders for cash, invaded the sanctity of the courts
with their "pull," and in the face of criminal charges
and indictments have laughed in the face of the com
munity.
When John P. Reynolds the other day swore thut
James A. Snook paid School Director Waller $5000
for seven votes in the board with which to pass the
Lincoln School lots lease, the very enormity of the
charge staggered our belief. In fact, the allegation
seemed too frightful to be attached even to a reform
Democratic Board of Education. But the way in
which Reynolds' story has been met by Waller and
his fellow Directors almost proves its truth. No cir
cumstantial denial has been made of it. The accused
men have merely whistled it lightly down the wind,
with every indication that they regard it as a huge
joke.
It is difficult to deal with politicians of this degree
of toughness. They do business with the very
sources of the power that constantly threatens them.
Snook was secretary of the Grand Jury when he em
ployed Reynolds to approach Waller. But there
ought to be some remedy for the state of affairs which
the finances of the School Department and the story
of Reynolds have disclosed to the public. These re
form Democrats ought to be in jail. There is no
doubt about that.
EVANGELINfJ LEAVES US.
ONE of the incidents of the war in Cuba was i
the escape of Evangelina Cisneros from the
island. She got away in the midst of a display
of red fire and a lot of bogus heroism, portrayed at j
space rates by the bogus heroes. Yellow journalism :
started her across the country as a sideshow, but she j
encountered a frost. The box-office was non-produc- j
tive. She was withdrawn as an attraction and mar- \
ricd one of the rescuers. This was supposed to be the !
last of her.
Evangelina has turned up again. Announcement is
made that she has gone back home. This is the final
tcken of peace. No Spanish cohorts were drawn up
to take a shot at her. No gallant Don spitted the
lady on his good sword. The white-winged dove sat
on the cuter wall and cooed a welcome. Probably
the fact that Spain never cared a snap whether Eva
escaped or not had something to do with lack of
demonstration when she went back to beard the
lyin' Blanco in his den.
But there is one remarkable transformation which
merits notice. When she arrived in this country she
was a sawed-ofl brunette suggestive in tint of a dis
ordered liver. She was not beautiful. She did not
possess even the average good looks. Nov., after a
brief residence in the United States, she goes back
to the island, and the truthful journalist describes her
a? beautiful. Probably she feels repaid for all the
trouble to which she has been subjected. If a short
rc-idence in America can make an ugly woman a joy
to the eyes, we have merits as a resort of which we
had never dreamed.
Perhaps the War Department ordered General
Shaffer back to Sr.n Francisco without having con
sulted the Examiner. Still, the order can be annulled.
Even the suicide of the president of a wrecked bank
pays no dividend to depositors.
THE RAILROAD AND POLITICS.
THE Oakland Enquirer considers the question of
the railroad in politics. It proposes to keep
watch and see if signs appear in the form of op
position to or support of any candidate for the United
j States Senate, and take that as a sign of good faith or
! bad on the part of the railroad. Organization implies
power. Politicians always scheme for the support of
any organization, because it controls the force that is
in a "mass of men moved by a common purpose. In
this way the Grand Army of the Republic has been
resorted to by politicians, and was once nearly
wrecked by being subjected to their uses. In this
State the Native Sons and the Young Men's Institute
have been at times regarded as organizations useful to
the politician if they could be captured. In the same
way the railroad has been regarded as a means to se
cure the ends sought by political ambition.
Ambition for office and its honors and power is
such a master motive with many men that rts disap
pointment moves some to reprisal and revenge.
One candidate for the Senate in this State, in an
interview, frankly shows signs of having sounded the
railroad for its support and of having been refused.
He immediately concludes that the support denied to
him will be given to some one else, and thereupon
grows virtuous and indignant over the railroad's dic
tation in politics. Having asked it to dictate his elec
tion and having been refused, he would seem to be
estopped from complaint, since it is no more wrong to
support another than to support him.
Now. suppose that a number of ambitious men go
tc the railroad on the same errand and come away
smarting under refusal, as is quite apt to be the case,
and they pool their revenges and these appear in the
form of "cinches" in the Legislature, the Railroad
Commission, the Board of Equalization and the
courts, then the railroad is driven to defend itself.
In that case there is to the public an apparent entry
of the railroad into politics, and those who have
forced it will bewail it the loudest.
Let politicians keep away from the railroad, cease
urging it to make a choice between them, c|ase to
solicit the power of its business organization as a
force in politics, and then its presence in such matters
will be so willful and flagrant as to be apparent to all
men and will justify unfriendliness on the part of the
people.
The Call has sufficient experience to know that no
campaign was ever freer of railroad influence or help,
financial or otherwise, than the one just finished in
California. It was because the people felt this that
they refused to be stampeded by frantic appeals to
prejudice and passion.
Now let the verdict stand, and let candidates make
their fight openly without solicitation of railroad
support or professions of hostility to it. Individuals
may express their preferences and support them.
Corporations and firms have no aggregate partisan
ship. It is known that individuals in important em
ployment with the railroad supported Bryan and sup
ported Maguire, as was their right.
Doubtless if the railroad were viciously attacked the
same individuals would seek to protect it. The Call
would fight at the drop of a sign of railroad inter
ference in politics, and it would fight as earnestly
c) gainst any attempt to force such interference by
cinchers and blackmailers.
California needs the touch^in amity, of all the in
strumentalities of her prosperity.
On the 19th of December, 1897. The Call signalized
its changed management in the issue of its New Era
edition. It is good to read again the forecast we made
then of the New Era and see how it has been empha
sized by the late election. We said then that:
"Wherever in corporate policy, where that great agent
of civilization, the co-operation of wealth, is neces
sary, there is restraint of individual effort to gain for
tune, that policy must yield not to public prejudice
but to an enlightened and friendly public judgment.
So, too, wherever individual attempts bar the public
good, they must yield, and it must prevail not in the
spirit of anarchy or war upon the rights of person and
property, but in that higher inspiration of good will
toward men." That is a prophetic statement of what
has happened now, and is the laying of a base line
and meridian from which the State has just taken a
fresh start. Let the established conditions stand
while they bring all interests to work as one for the
benefit of the State.
A JUDGE OF GOOD ROADS.
JUDGE STANLEY WOODWARD of Lu
zerne, Pennsylvania, has achieved fame and won
commendation, not only in his own State but
throughout the East, by instructing a Grand Jury
that there were many complaints of bad roads in
various sections of the county and that it was their
duty to inquire into them. He further instructed the
jury that if they found the complaints to, be justified
they should make a return of them to the court, and
the court would then compel the Supervisors to do
their part.
The commendation given to the Judge is due to the
fact that in nearly every county in the United States
there are complaints of bad roads, and his instruc
tions to the Grand Jury give promise of providing
a means of having the complaints properly heeded by
the Supervisors. It is recognized that if the courts
get into the business of road supervision we may get
tetter highways in a comparatively short time.
The subject will be much more interesting when
the Grand Jury makes its report and the Judge sets
about the task of compelling the Supervisors to at
tend to the duty of providing good roads. At present
the situation is one of promise merely. It is gratify
ing to have one Judge in the country who takes an
interest in highway improvement, but until he dem
onstrates his ability to render that interest really ser
viceable the gratification will fall far short of satisfac
tion.
As a matter of fact the improvement of rural high
ways is of so much importance to all parts of the
Union that any potent assistance given to the effort
tc accomplish reform in road management is hailed
with pleasure. There are several counties in Califor
nia where Judges might profitably follow the course
taken by Judge Woodward. Even if Supervisors can
not be made to get a move on they might be com
pelled to squirm a little, and that is better than
nothing.
THE FIRST CUBfiN PROBLEM.
THE first Cuban problem arising from our ap
proaching occupation of the island has made
its appearance, and of course ft is an unexpected
problem. It has nothing to do with the claims of the
Cuban patriots, the property of the Spaniards, the
war debt or the race issue. It is simply the question
whether there is to be or not to be any bull-fighting
in the island while the country is under our control.
It appears that what is known as "The Amalga
mated Association of Cuban Bull Fighters" has sent
to Washington a petition couched in courtly Spanish
eloquence praying the President not to interfere with
the sport when his authority becomes paramount.
In other words, the President is requested to become
something like a patron of the bull ring and to grant
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FIIIDAT, NOVEMBER 18, 1898.
his august favor to its continuance as a recreation for
the liberated people and patriots of the beautiful Pearl
of the Antilles.
It will be seen that the issue is a delicate one. The
sports and amusements of a people are not to be
lightly set aside even in the name of humanity. When
the Puritans suppressed bear-baiting and the theater
in England they prepared the way for the return of
the monarchy by alienating- from themselves the affec
tions of a large mass of the common people. The
Cubans would probably much sooner surrender their
sovereignty as a republic than their bull-fights, and if
we wish to enjoy a sociable time in the islands while
we hold them, it will be advisable for us to leave the
bull ring open.
On the other hand, it is not going to be easy for
the President of the United States, or for the generals
of our army of occupation in Cuba, to tolerate a sport
which our people have come to regard as something
brutalizing and barbarous. If the sport could be car
ried on secretly like a faro game we might forbid it
by law and then look the other way when it went on,
but that is impossible. Not even a policeman could
pretend that he did not see a bull ring. It might be
feasible, however, to change the name of the game
from bull-fighting to bull-wrestling and permit a
twenty-round contest for points.
Fortunately our administration of Cuba will be
purely military for some time, at any rate, and we can
truÂ«t our generals to devise some means of overcom
ing the difficulty. Lord Salisbury recently stated that
the admirals stationed at Crete were better diplo
matists than the statesmen in the Cabinets. We are
likely to find the same to be true of our army officers
in dealing with the problems of managing a'people
whose civilization is so different from our own. We
can leave the issue to them. They may take the bull
by the horns with their own hands, or they may use
their hands to help the pretty Spanish girls applaud
the toreadors. Whichever they do the country will
stand by them.
THE STATE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION.
WHEN the members of the State Library Asso
ciation meet in convention at Sacramento on
the 25th they will find many subjects to en
gage their attention, but it is safe to say not one will
be more important than that of providing for the es
tablishment in this State of that system of traveling
libraries which has been found so beneficial wherever
adopted.
The Call has repeatedly directed attention to this
subject, and the time is appropriate for doing so
again. To render the books of the State Library
available for traveling libraries an act of the Legis
lature will be required. To assure the passage of
such an act something like a campaign of education
will be necessary, and no body of men and women is
better fitted to undertake the work of education than
me State Library Association. The issue is, there
fore, one which should be given earnest consideration
by the convention to the end that every member may
be impressed with its importance to the people of all
sections of the commonwealth.
It must be borne in mind that the supporters of
the traveling library plan are not suggesting to the
State anything in the way of an experiment. It is
not a question of using the books in the State Library
to make a test of some untried scheme. The system
has been tried and thoroughly tested by several of the
most progressive States in the Union. It has been
in operation a long time. It has been found to ful
fill one of the requirements of our American civiliza
tion, and where once it has been established it has de
veloped and grown with remarkable rapidity.
To the State Library Association the people can
surely look for assistance in bringing about the adop
tion of the system in California. When put into opera
tion the plan would result in benefits to every small
library and to every reading circle and literary or
scientific club in the State. It would give to the
people at large the use of the volumes now idle on the
shelves of the library room at Sacramento, and thus
make that institution a vital influence for good, not
in one city only, but throughout the State.
California is sparsely populated, and many of her
citizens are out of reach of libraries; many communi
ties are so small they are unable to afford libraries,
and in some, where libraries exist, the number of
volumes of standard and scientific merit is limited.
To all of these the traveling system will be a veritable
boon of great magnitude. The argument for the
system is so strong that if properly presented its
adoption by the Legislature is hardly to be doubted.
The opportunity for the State Association to render
an important service to the people by urging the
measure is therefore too good to be overlooked.
Probably there is little truth in the statement that
the Cubans are preparing for hostilities against the
Americans. Even inclined to recklessness as they are,
the Cubans will hardly cut themselves off from the
American ration.
Arolas may be murdered by the Spanish soldiers in
Cuba, and while this would not be conventional it
would be just. He himself is a murderer, and not
likely to be executed by any due process of law.
President Valentine of the Wells-Fargo Express
Company submitted to a long interview in New York.
We scan it in vain for any light as to his reason for
refusing to pay his share of the war tax.
When the French have Dreyfus back in Paris prob
ably he will be treated with the ordinary courtesy
due a state prisoner. This will include the placing of
a razor and a pistol in his cell.
The Americans who abandoned the Maria Teresa
will have to explain. The Spanish, who had aban
doned it previously, had so excellent an excuse that
they will not be questioned. ,
With Dr. Gardner as inspector of the Chinese Bu
teau that body seems likely to be no longer employed
in the promotion of the particular crimes it was de
signed to prevent.

WRIGHT WILL
HAVE LITTLE
OPPOSITION
Assured of Election as
Speaker.
RECORD AS A LEGISLATOR
AUTHOR OF THE UNIVERSITY
TAX BILL.
Many Promises of Support Received
From Men of Influence in
All Parts of the
State.
.Reports received from various parts
of the State indicate a general feeling
of satisfaction over the news that the
lower house of the next Legislature
will in all probability be presided over
by Assemblyman Howard E. Wright of
Berkeley. Since the announcement of
his candidacy Mr. Wright's strength
has been growing daily, until it is now
well assured that he will be elected
Speaker by the entire Republican vote
of the Assembly.
Past sessions of the Legislature have I
been so prolific of scandals that there
is a general feeling throughout the
State that at the coming session ihere
should be at the hea 1 of affairs in the
iower house a man who can be depend
ed on to guide the new members over
and around the pitfalls that will be
dug, or can be dug, by an unscrupu
lous lobby or members wh > have a
greater regard for personal advance
ment than they have for the welfare
of the State. Those who entertain such
a feeling do not pretend to criticize the
acts of the gentlemen who have served
in the capacity of Speaker during past
sessions, but they realize that much
depends on the man who holds in his
hands the appointment of committets
and the regulation of all of the busi
ness of this, the most important
branch, in many respects, of the State's
lawmaking body.
The leaders of the Republican party
are also vitally interested in the selec
tion of a Speaker, as they realize that
any scandal or any pernicious legisla
tion would work a great injury in the
minds of the people to the party in
power. It is their desire that every
pledge made during the campaign shall
be carried out in the spirit as well as
the letter, and they also realize that
many powerful influences will be
brought to bear to hinder such a re
sult. This being so they desire that
none but honest and capable men shall
have the immediate direction of the
business of the session, to the end that
the influence of unprincipled politicians
and corporation lobbyists may be re
duced to a minimum.
It is perhaps due as much to his per
sonal popularity as to his eminent fit
ness to perform the duties attached to
the position to which he aspires that
Mr. Wright's candidacy has met with
such instant and widespread approval.
His experience as a legislator has given
him an intimate knowledge of the du
ties that are required of a Speaker, and
the fact that he will have the confi
dence and respect of the men over
whose deliberations he will preside will
serve to lend additional weight to his
authority.
Mr. Wright's work during the last
session of the Legislature in connection
with the introduction and passage of
the university tax bill won for him the
gratitude of every person in the State
who has the interests of higher educa
tion at heart. As the tftithor of the bill
Mr. Wright worked early and late in
its Interest and it was largely due to
his individual efforts that it finally se
cured passage and became a law. By
its provisions the law puts at the dis*
posal of erery child, rich or poor, in the
State an education such as is obtain
able only in a few institutions in the
civilized world. His work in this con
nection was particularly noteworthy
and was of a nature to commend him
to the gratitude of the whole people.

OPENING OF
ThjE SYMPHONIES
Thet Symphony Society commenced the
new season of concerts in the Orpheum
yesterday afternoon with a varied and
Interesting programme find a numerous
audience. The Orpheum, with its stage
liberally extended, is an admirable house
for the concerts. The seats are so many
that everybody can pick out a good one,
and the acoustics is excellentâ as good If
not better than that of the Tivoli. The
one drawback is the aroma of last night's
beer, which lingers rather heavily in the
atmosphere; but perhaps better ventila
tion will do away with this by the next
lim Â£- ÂTi c Programme of yesterday began
with \Venpr s "Jubel" overture and tnded
wit; Massenet's "Scenes Neopolitalneg "
neither of which pieces is new to San
Francisco. The novelties were Tsi-halk
owskys Fourth Symphony and Bach's
Overture and Suite in A minor. A more
startling contrast hardly could have been
arranged. The Tschaikowsky is one of
the last cries of modernity, full of sensa
tional rhythms and bold color, and em
ploying almost every device known to the
modern orchestra. The Bach, which is for
strings with flute solo, is thoroughly
Bachlike, clean and direct in theme and
chastely mathematical in development
Mr. Scheel's successful Interpretation of
both works was another tribute to his
versatility and authority. He played the
Tschaikowsky with nothing short of in
spiration, bringing out all the nervous
force and peculiar dramaisms of the
piece, and yet never slighting the sheer
tune and lilt that abound in every meas
ure. The Bach suite he read with charm
ing simplicity and sympathy. His accent
was true, even reverential, and still it
was never trite and pedantic. The band
was in eager form, and answered to the
last man. Mr. Roderman, the flautist,
again distinguished himself, this time in
the Bach piece. The next concert will be
given on the afternoon of December 1,
with Schumann's B flat symphony and
Tschalkowsky's "Romeo and Juliet" over
ture for special attractions.

STILL PROBING THE
STEAMER COLLISION
EVIDENCE AS TO CONFUSING
SIGNALS OF THE PETERS.
Captain George W. oeaman of the
Czarina Gives Clear Testimony
in Regard to Courses.
The official inquiry into the cause of the
Peters-Czarina collision was continued
yesterday morning before Inspectors
Bolles and Bulger.
Will Johnson, the first witness of the
day, is "the engineer at the stone quarry
on Angel Island. He was at supper when
he heard two coarse whistles and then a
shrill one. He heard two whistles again
answered, but with how many blasts he
did not know. Then the crash came, and
he saw a white light which seemed to be
high up.
Attorney Frank brought out the fact
that there was a hill to the north of the
dining-room, and unless a favorable wind
was Dlowing the sound of a whistle
blown to the north could not be heard.
Fred Pearl was playing a game of cards
in the quarry-house at the time. He
heard two whistles, followed by one, then
two, and the crash came. If the vessels
had whistled when they were a mile
apart he thought he would have heard
them.
Caatain George W. Seaman of the Czar
ina was recalled and asked as to the
courses he steered for "Vallejo. His course
around the Brothers was southeast one
half south, five degrees east of the devia
tion. Abreast of Raccoon Straits he
steered southeast by south, 6 degrees east
of deviation. He did not lose sight of the
red and green lights of the Peters until a
few seconds before the collision. The
vessels would not have cleared had the
Peters blown four whistles and backed
after she sounded two whistles the second
time, as the steamers were too close to
together, -v
When Seaman said that he had blown
one whistle and the Peters blew one, fol
lowed by two. Stanley Page asked him
what he" thought about the contrary sig
nals. Seaman replied:
"I thought the captain of the Peters in
tended to go one way and then changed
his mind."
In reply to a question by Inspector
Bolles why he had not blown four
whistles and backed when he realized the
confusion of whistles on the Peters, he
said: . _ , ,
"There was no time to do so. I wished
to show the other vessel that I was port
ing my helm and obeying the road rules.'
This morning Captain Houldsworth of
the Peters will be recalled and his chief
engineer will take the stand.

PAGO-PAGO
CONTRACTORS
START WORK
Steel Piles to Be Made
at Pittsburg.
TOTAL COST TO BE $200,000
CONTRACTS FOB CAST IRON TO
BE LET HERE.
Healy, Tibbets & Co. Prepared to
Start the Expedition in Febru
aryâForty Men Will Bo
Taken From Here.
The contractors for the Pago-Pago
coaling station. Messrs. Healy, Tibbets
& Co. of this city, are already well under
way with their work. Although the con
tract was only let a couple of months ago,
all the preliminary preparations are now
completed, and the work of manufactur
ing the piles and other material required
for the wharf and coaling sheds is about
to commence.
It is a pretty big contract and will
mean the expenditure of a good deal of
money on this coast. The tender origin
ally accepted by Commander Tanner was
for 5142,000, but since then the Naval De
partment has decided to add five bents
to the T piece of the wharf, lengthening
its eighty feet. This means an additional
outlay of $21,000. Then there is the grad
ing and concrete work ashore to prepare
the foundations for the coal sheds and
caretaker's houÃe. This is paid for by
measurement, at so much a cubic yard.
Altogether the work will cost Uncle Sara
at least $200,000.
"We have all our drawings completed,"
said Mr. Healy yesterday. "We hayÂ«
had six draughtsmen at work ever since
our tender was accepted. We have let the
contract for the manufacture of the steel
piles and material for the superstructure
and sheds to the Carnegie Steel Company,
Limited, of Pittsburg."
Thus the biggest and most profitable
portion of the work goes East, away from
this coast, but this is unavoidable under
the present conditions of trade. No Call
fornlan firm is prepared to compete with
the steel makers of the Eastern cities.
The contract made by the Carnegie firm is
for the manufacture of 2,800,000 pounds of
steel, principally piling. The piles are of
all sizes, some of them with screws, for
boring through sand, others with sharp
ends, for driving through the coral rock.
The largest piles will be eight and three
quarter inches in diameter and seventy
feet long, weighing over seven tons.
Lieutenant Chambers, who is represent
ing the Government in this matter, left
iast night for Pittsburg to supervise the
manufacture of the steel work. With him
went J. B. Leonard, an engineer employed
by the contractors. These gentlemen will
keep their eye on the manufacturers from
beginning to end of the process, and will
take caie that nothing but the very beat
material is turned out.
Still, California is to get something. The
CDntracts for all the cast-iron work are to
be let here. Shoes for the piles, bltts for
the wharf and various other minor arti
cles have to be made, and these will
amount to about 350,000 ' pounds in weight
and $10,000 in value. The method of trans
portation has not yet been decided upon.
"We would prefer," remarked Mr.
Healy, "to send everything in one vessel
from this coast; but considerations of
time may render this impossible, and it
.may become necessary to ship the steel
work manufactured in the East from New
York by steamer. The rest of the ma
terial would then go frojn this coast in a
sailing vessel. But if we can manage to
get every thing across the continent in
cars it would be better, tor the whole
expedition would then leave San Fran
cisec in one ship.
"V.'c have to complete the work by Sep
tember next, so there is no time to lose.
The ship must start in February or March
next. Mr. Tibbets of our firm will go
down in charge of the party, which will
consist of the engineers and forty skilled
mechanics. For the rougher laboring
work we expect to employ natives. Once
we get the material tended it will take us
about four months to erect the wharf.
"The coaling shed alone will be a big
piece of work. It is to be about 150 feet
long by 100 feet wide, and will accommo
date several thousand tons of coal, l'he
wharf will be 256 feet long, with a T piece
352 feet. Then there is a house for the
caretaker and all kinds of subsidiary
work. There is plenty to be done in the
time."
IF I WERE KING.
If I were king, my pipe should be premier.
The skies of time and chance are seldom
clear.
We would inform them all with bland
blue weather.
Delight alone would need to shed a tear,
For dream and deed should war no more
together.
Art should aspire, yet ugliness be dear;
Beauty, the shaft, should speed with w"it
for feather;
And love, sweet love, should never fail to
sere,
If I were king.
But politics should find no harbor near,
The Philistine should fear to slip his
tether;
Tobacco should be duty free, and beer;
In fact, in room of this, the age of
leather,
An age of gold all radiant should appear.
If I were king. .

DARING TRICK OF A BROKER
TRIES TO IMPORT A FEMALE
CHATTEL SERF.
The Fraud Exposed by the Merchants
Whose Names Had Been Made
Use of by the Im
postor.
One of the most daring attempts on rec
ord to effect the landing of a Chinese fe
male slave was made in this city a few
days ago.
A Chinaman giving the name of Fong
Cheong obtained a writ of habeas corpus
for the landing of his daughter, Fong Gim
Toy, a girl of 16 years. Cheong testified
before Commissioner Heacock that he was
a partner in the firm of Coon Yuen of Sac
ramento and that the girl was born in
that city.
The girl herself testified that she was
born at the place stated and that the wit
ness, Fong Cheong, was her father. The
case was continued for more evidence,
there being a contradiction in some mat
ters between the testimony of the girl and
that of her reputed father. Pending the
decision of the ease the folowing- letter
was received by Collector Jackson:
I beg to inform you that by the steamer
Gaelic on her last trip to your port, among
other Chinamen there arrived one who gave
the name of Coon Yuen, who had two wo
men with him. They are now awaiting a
landing, having, aa I learned, resorted to
a writ of habeas corpus.
Now, I wish to Ftate that this man Is
lmx.osing on the Government by attempting
to land fraudulently. He gave his name aÂ»
Cor.n Yuen and aa a rodent of this city
(Sacramento;. Hit name is not Coon Yuen,
a* there iÂ« but one Chinaman of that name
in this city, and that 1b my company or
store narr.p. Upsides, he claims, as I am
informed, that the two women with him
are hiÂ« wl!> and daughter. I have a wife
in China but I have n-.Â»r sent for her, and
hhe is Â«till In thai country. I hope you will
see that a strict Investigation iÂ« made Into
this case and that tins man and his women
are not allowed t<Â» land, as there are too
many frauds cummin*.! by detuning Im
postors c>n Chinamen who wish to ol.ey the
law* and again I don't want the name of
my firm to be used as a means by which
such creatures may come ashore, nor to re
peat the crime at some future date. Hoping
that I may be able to prevent thlÃ fellow's
imposition. I am very respectfully
COOK YUEN, by FONG CHEONG.
The writer of the foregoing made a mis
take when he said that the false Fong-
Cheong was also on the iteatner. He is
in this city and was simpiy trying to land
the girl by the usual method of ciiine.se
perjury. The genuine Fong Cheor.K of
Sacramento and his partner, Fong Glng
of the Jinn of Coon Yuen, told their sto
ries to Commissioner Heacock yesterday
afternoon. Thoir cross examination by-
Walter J. TuFka, counsel for the false
Fong Cheong. failed to shake them in the
least. Then Mr. Tuska asked for a con
tinuance and saifl that he would produce
his client. Fong- Cheong. in court. A con-
Mnuance was taken until Monday, when it
fs not expected the false Cheong will be
visible.

EDWARD GABTLAND IN JAIL.
Arrest of tie Man Who Crueliy
Stabbed a Horse With a
Pitchfork.
Officers Hooper and McCurry of the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
I Animals yesterday arrc-Pted Edward Gart
land for cruelty to a horse. The man lives
at 632 Post street. This case has attract
ed much attention because of the fiendish
ness of the crime. Gartland has been
employed by James C Christensen, who
keeps a coal yard at 209 Ellis street. For
a long time the man has been on friendly
terms with Christensen's family. A week
ago Gartland wanted to use his friend's
telephone, but was refused, Christensen
saying that the fellow was too drunk to
handle the phone. Gartland at once went
downstairs to the stable and began to
stab Christensen's horse with a^pltchfork
the animal being fastened wiin a short
rope in a stall.
R. C. Wilkie, the real estate man, wit
nessed the brutality and notified the own
er of the poor beast. By the tlm* tho
weapon was taken from Gartland the
horse's hind quarters were covered with
blood running from many wounds
Owing to the fact that Gartland has
prominent relatives and for other reasons
Chriptensen refused to prosecute the of
fender and Wllkle was urged not to swear
to a warrant of arrest. The publication of
the outrage In The Call caused many of
the patrons of the coal dealer to demand
that he prosecute Gartland. He yielded
unwillingly to the demands, and* Gart
land's arrest followed, Wilkie swearing to
the warrant. The horse has been in a
most pitiable condition since being in
jured and it will be days before it will be
able to work again.
POLICEMEN FINED.
Several of Them Before the Commis-
sioners Charged With Vari
ous Offenses.
The Police Commissioners Wednesday
fined Officer Wimam Isaacs $25 for being
off his beat. Patrick Perry, charged with
inefficiency, had his case dismissed. Pat
rick Coughran was fined $10 and Charles
Green $25 for visiting a saloon while on
duty. Frank C. Howard. John Lewis and
Smith Carr were fined* $r> each for violat
ing the section relative to leaving the city
without the permission of the Chief of
Police. The men attended the races at
Oakland and failed to report at the
proper time. Several letters were read
indorsing Jerry Dlnan and Tom Gibson
for detectives, caused by the doath of
Joseph Bee, and the promotion of John
Seymour to the position of captain. By
request the appointments were laid over
until after the return of Commissioner
Tobln, who is no- in the East.

A Better Investment Than Hawaiian
Commercial Stock.
The public is now talking about the
fortunate investors who bought the
above stock for $15 a share, which is
now selling for nearly $60, but this in
vestment is not to be compared with
the investment made for one single dol
lar by F. Vette, a grocer, corner of
O'Farrell and Jones streets, San Fran
cisco, Cal. He purchased for $1 a quar-
t r ticket. No. 37,839, in the lottery of
the Beneflcencla Publica Company of
the City of Mexico, in the October 27
drawing, which number drew the capi
tal prize of $60,000, making Mr. Vette's
share $15,000. This prize of $15,000 was j
promptly paid at the office of Metzger |
& Franklin. 35 New Montgomery street, i
San Francisco, Cal.
The lottery of the Beneflcencia Pub
lica Company is popular on this coast
for the reason that so many capital i
prizes are constantly won here.
Another reason is that the public j
know that this Is the only authorized j
lottery In Mexico, and is guaranteed j
and protected by that Government.
The drawings are conducted publicly
under the auspices of the Government, :
which appoints Senator Apolinar Cas- ;

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1898.
"MAN OVERBOARD."
James Kane, boatswain of the Norma, fell overboard from the lower topsail yard while
the vessel was on her way here from Antwerp. The bark was sailing about six
knots an hour at the time, yet the yards were backed, a boat lowered, Kane picked
up, the boat hoisted aboard and the vessel on her course again, all inside of twenty
m invites.

ON THE BARK

THEY HAD A GREAT SCARE

BY A SPANISH CRUISER.

The Steamer City of Columbia
May Reach Seattle
After All.
The British ship Norma, which arrived
from Antwerp last Wednesday night, had
an eventful voyage. She was a partici
pant in "the regatta" held off the Horn
on September 1; her wheelhouse and
wheel were carried away in a storm; the
boatswain fell overboard and was res
cued, and one of the crew died and was
buried at sea. The picking up of the
boatswain was probably as smart a piece
of seamanship as was ever performed on
the ocean.
The ship was moving through the water
at the rate of six knots an hour when
the cry "A man overboard!" was raised.
Captain McDonnell hove the ship to, low
ered a boat, picked up the man, brought
him aboard and put the vessel on her
course again all inside of twenty minutes.
"That's an object lesson for our ferry
boat captains," said an old sea captain.
"When a man falls overboard from their
vessels they generally pick him up on
the return trip."
The Norma left Antwerp with a general
cargo 147 days ago. She made a good pas
sage to the Horn and rounded that point
in company with nine other vessels. A
number of them were bound for San
Francisco, but all of them arrived here
before the Norma. From the Horn to lat
itude 46 south, longitude 86 weet, a succes
sion of northwest gales was encountered,
and on September 24 a sea broke aboard
that carried away the wheel and did other
damage. From that place to port the
Norma was steered by her auxiliary gear.
Early in October the Norma was rolling
along before a steady breeze at a 6-knot
clip when James Kane, the boatswain,
fell overboard. He was on the lower top-
Ball yard and instead of resting on the
footrope he put his feet on the topsail
sheet. The clewlines were not made fast,
so as soon as his weight came on the
sheet it gave and away he went. The ves
sel was hove-to and the dingy lowered
with three men in it. By this time Kane
was a quarter of a mile away, but swim
ming strongly after the ship. It did not
take the boat long to cover the quarter of
a mile, and inside of twenty minutes Kane
was back aboard and the Norma was once
more on her course.
On October 3 Jacob Edlln, an African
died of consumption and was buried at
sea. He had been ailing almost from the
time the ship left Antwerp, but did not
suffer much.
The British bark Nellie Brett has ar
rived at Auckland, New Zealand, in safe
ty. She was formerly an American vessel
having been built at Bath, Me., in 1870,
but was sold to New Zealand parties and
put under the English flag before she
nailed from New York last May with a
general cargo. She was so long in making
the voyage that fears were entertained for
j her safety and 50 per cent reinsurance
was paid on her.
According -to a private letter received
! from Auckland by the Moana, the Nellie
Brett had a lively time with the Spanish
auxiliary cruiser Alphonse XIII. The
bark was becalmed in latitude 27.55 north,
longitude 41.41 west, when a steamer bore
down on her. When close to the Nellie
Brett the steamer ran up a signal, but
Captain Lowry paid no attention to it, as
he could not make it out, until a shot was
fired across his bows, when he ran up the
English ensign. A boat was lowered from
the Alphonse XIII and manned with an
officer and interpreter and twelve men, all
heavily armed. The interpreter was one
of the cruiser's engineers, and, as Captain
Lowry calls him, "a, ' Scotch renegade."
When the boarding party got* on the
deck of the bark a demand was made for
the ship's papers. The crew list was
scanned, and then it was seen that Cap
tain Lowry was the only American among
them. Next the main hatch was taken
off and the cargo examined for contra
band of war, and last of all the liag
locker was overhauled, and when the of
ficer saw the British ensign and the jack
he appeared satisfied.
Before leaving, the Spanish officer told
Captain Lowry he was not to attempt to
make sail until he saw hie boat hoisted
aboard the cruiser. "It took them a long
time to consider," said Captain Lowry,
when telling about the incident, "for the
boat was alongside nearly half an hour
before she was hoisted up, and I was
mighty glad to see her screws revolving
and the Alphonso XIII heading In another
direction from my course."
The British bark Inverlochy arrived
here from Newcastle, N. S. W., in the
smart passage of sixty-eight days yester
day. The British ship Fannie Kerr and
the French dark General Neumeyer left
the same port for San Francisco neany
a fortnight before her, and both of them
only reached the Farallones yesterday.
A private letter from Hilo, H. 1., re
ceived yesterday, says that there is a
chance of the steamer City of Columbia
continuing her voyage to Puget Sound
after all. "She; is leaking a good deal and
is in a b&d way generally," says the
writer; "but I think they will at least get
her to Honolulu. Her owners want to
condemn her, but the underwriters are
going to put her in shape and send her on
to Seattle. The captain has had all ne
wants of her, however, and says no power
on earth will induce him to go to sea in
her again."
Dr. Hill, surgeon of the Harbor Receiv
ing Hospital and Coroner-elect, leaves on
the Santa Rosa to-morrow for a vacation
in Los Angeles County. The genial medico
Is worn out after his severe campaign,
and is going to take a much needed rest.
The many friends of Customs Inspector
Sprague were condoling with him yester
day over the loss of his little daughter.
The childâ Olive Montrose Spragueâ died
at the Springbrook farm, near Los Gatos,
yesterday, and her father was notified by
telegram of the sad fact.
General Dickinson and Secretary Frank
Brandon of the committee appointed to
investigate all State commissions by the
last Senate were at the Harbor Commis
sion yesterday. The other members of the
committee were expected, but did not put
in an appearance, so but lixtle was done.
Chief Engineer Holmes told of the work
done by the board and the condition in

ODD FELLOWS' JUBILEE,
Outlining What Will Be Done in
Celebration of the vjrolden
Jubilee.
The committee of arrangements of the
Golden Jubilee Convention of the Odd Fel
lows met Wednesday and was informed
by Secretary Clifford that of the circular
I letters sent out to the subordinate and
Rebekah Lodges 148 responses had already
been received. Of this number seventy
seven favored a grand celebration of the
â  founding of Odd Fellows' day, to be held
j in San Francisco in the month of October,
during encampment week; while the
others favored local celebrations on the
Bth of September, the day on which the
first lodge was established in 1850. The
committee decided to recommend to the
convention that a grand celebration be
held In this city and that those lodges un
able by reason of distance to join hold
celebrations in their districts. It will also
recommend that there be festivities for
three or four days, that there be recep
tions, exemplification of the work in the
several degrees of the order, a grand pro
cession, literary exercises, a ball and ex
cursions to points of interest in the city
and on the Day. A number of sub-com
mittees were appointed to ascertain the
probable cost 01 the affair.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Nov. 17.â The results of to
ay's stock market operations were rather In
conclusive, except In so far as they showed a
continued lively, interest on the part of the
outside public in securities of all grades. As
far as prices are concerned net changes are
rather mixed, though the majority are on the
Bide of gam*, and those in some cases amount
to one per cent or over. The early period of
the market showed heavy offerings to real
ize, which are at all times usual in the up
ward course of a real bull market. But even
while prices sagged at some points with the
effort to absorb the offerings the other stocks
were mounting up, maintaining the undertone
of the firmness. The very notable movement
in Atchison preferred was continued from the
outlet, at which time running purchases car
ried the price up %c. The gain was subse
quently extended to 1%, and the net gain is
almost a point. There was a very heav-- de
mand early for Denver preferred, which had
been marked up before the opening here and in
London. This stock rose an extreme 2 points,
and Norfolk and Western 1%. Baltimore &
Ohio, Pacific Mail and International Paper
gave tone also to the early market, as did an
upward bound of 3% in Metropolitan Street
Railway. Other weakness in Tobacco and the
reaction in Chicago & Alton from its recent ad
vance had an unsettling effect 'In the first
hour. In the second hour, however, the Grang
ers were taken In hand, and Burlington and
Rock Island were pushed to the highest prices
of the year. Some of the low priced and lately
dormant stocks were also brought Into the
movement and advanced to a higher level.
The late reaction was Induced by the persist
ent weakness of the Northern Pacifies and the
uneasiness thus caused in the minds of hold
ers by rumors of discord and a propective out
break of hostilities in the Northwest railways.
The common stock fell to 40% and the preferred
to 75. Support was apparently withdrawn
from these stocks and heavy blocks were
thrown upon the market.
The bond market showed a recurrence of its
recent strength, yesterday's declines being in
part retrieved. Total sales, $4,040,000.
United St-.tes new fours coupon and the
fives coupon declined %, and the new fours
registered % in the bid price.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 637,100
shares. Including Atchison 25,452. Atchison pre

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Nov. 17.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: Stocks In
this market were lifeless to-day except Ameri
cans, which were animated on support from
New Tork, from Germany and by a profes
sional clique here. There was no public buying
and the continental demand was chiefly for
Baltimore and Ohio. Atchison preferred. Denver
and Rio Grande preferred and Southern Rail
way preferred. Late in the day Paris and
Berlin showed a disposition to sell.
The professional interest in Americans in
creases here and many Jobbers are migrating
from the Kaffir to the American markets. The
Kaffir market was so woefully stangant that a
migration somewhere was a necessity from a
professional point of view. Grand Trunk after
a period of dullness was strong In the street
on Montreal clique buying.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Nov. 17.â Opening trades in wheat
showed ellght changes either way from yester
day's closing prices. May starting a shade
lower and December %c higher. The market at
once developed v considerable - firmness. The
general demand for â¢ December, coupled with
the strength shown by Liverpool and yester
day's large export business, alarmed the shorts,
and for half an hour or more the market --was
very active. London reported more inquiry
for off-coast and passage cargoes, which had
its effect on the strained local situation. Some
reaction then followed. The advance brought
out considerable wheat, showing good profits.
It was all quickly taken, but prices dropped to
66c for May and 67c for December. During the
middle of the session the market was quite
nervous and prices moved up and down rap
idly. December shorts were evidently still
1 very apprehensive of trouble on account of the
! comparatively small stocks and the freedom
I with which wheat is going out of the country,
and that option became so pronouncedly bull
ish that May caught some of the same spirit.
lln the last forty-five minutes' trading the
market experienced a decided reversal. Out-
Bide markets as a rule failed to respond to
the advance here. Realizing also became very
heavy, more wheat being offered than the mar
ket could readily absorb, and prices in conse-
I quence dropped rapidly. The market was quite
j weak toward the close. December closed at
66%@66%c and May at 65% c.
Corn was very active and strong, but did not
maintain best prices. Cash demand was good,
both here and at the seaboard. Buying was
quite heavy until late in the session, but the
closing weakness of wheat affected prices
somewhat. May closed H_Â©%.C higher.
Oats were firm and higher and quite a good
general trade was done. Outsiders were in
the market in increased numbers. Cash de
mand was again excellent. Shorts were large
buyers Toward the close the market weakened
materially and nearly all the advance was
lost. May closed %c higher. â¢;/ _*â¢
Trade In provisions was very small. The
market in the main wae steady, though having
intervals of weakness, due partly to the bad
hog market. At the close January pork was
2%c lower, lard a shade lower and ribs a shade

CONTRACT FOR THE
BRIDGE AMENDED
COTTON BROTHERS FAVORED BY
THE BOARD.
Supervisor Wells Was the Only Mem
ber Who Did Not Vote for
thÂ«! Award.
Oakland Office San Francisco Cail,
Broadway, Nov. 17.
The Supervisors ihis morning awarded
the contract for building the steel bridge
a th-3 estuary to Cotton Bros, for
District Attorney Cook suggested to the
board that in the motion awarding the
contract they incur. fact that
I 1 ; of the Schmidt
ruction Company for good and suffi
cient reasons. Mr. Snook advised that the
board was m t I I award the con
tract to the lowest bidder, and having re-
I any bid could award it to th^ next
responsible bidder.
Engineer Campbell, representing the
Schmidt Company, asked if the District
Attorney meant that the board must flle
specific charges against the Schmidt Com
pany. Supervisor Wells said that it had
not been shown that the company was not
responsible, and he understood the mem
bers had lots of money and had a plant.
â¢ -.'-visor Mitchell differed from Wells,
and Supervisor Koeth agreed with Mitch
ell. Supervisor Church moved that the
contract be awarded to the lowest respon
sible bidder, Cotton Eros. In seconding
the motion Mr. Mitchell said: "I am In
favor of awarding this contract to Cotton
Bros, because they are undoubtedly a gen
uine Oakland concern. A few days ago I
asked Mr. Cotton what the chances were
ii the Judson. Iron Works getting the
.work if they should get the contract. lie
said that the Judson Iron Works would
give a bid as low as any Eastern house,
and would certainly have the preference.
I was not satisfied, and went to the iron
works, and was told that if Cotton Bros,
secured the contract the Judson Company
would probably get the work of making
the bridge. It has been said that Cotton
Bros, have a preference in this Board of
Supervisors Ido not mind saying that
so far as I am concerned they have.
Every bit of work they have done for this
county since I have been a Supervisor him
been well done and we have had no diffi
culty with them. The County Surveyor
sustains this view and that it is one of the
few firms with whom we have no diffi
culty, after contracts arc let."
Mr. Roeth explained his vote by saying
that he was very glad the people of Ala
meda County should know that he bad
been in favor of awarding the bid to a re
sponsible concern. When the motion was
put only Wells opposed It. The bond of
the contractors was fixed at $50 000

Alarming Increase of Actions for Le

OAKLAND, Nov. 17.-If the present

IRATE HUSBAND

WITH BIGAMY
His Tardy Return
From Klondike.
MINER'S STRANGE DISCOVERY
ALICE LORETTA McCOY HAD
MARRIED JOHN COSGROVE.
The Fortune-Hunter Says That She
Has Never Obtained a Divorce,
but He Will Now Bring
Suit.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway Nov. 17.
An irate hushand. who obstinately re
fused to disclose his name, which, how
ever, is supposed to be McCoy, called at
the County Clerk's office to-day. He cre
ated a sensation which, though small in
its incipiency, is likely to develop into one
of considerable magnitude.
"He asked to be allowed to inspect the
record of marriage licenses issued in 1592.
This was shown him, and when he came
upon the names of Alice Loretta McCoy
and John Cosgrove, both aged 29 years
and residents of San Francisco, to whom
a license had been issued on August 29.
1592, his anger knew no bounds, and he
swore that he would have revenge.
Alice Loretta McCoy is my wite!"\said
the stranger, after he had regained! his
composure. "In 1892 I left Sun Francisco
for the gold fields of Alaska in the hope
of acquiring 1 a fortune that we might live
happy and in comfort ever afterward. I
have "been fairly successful, and returned
to San Francisco a few weeks ago."
"Though 1 made a diligent search for
my wife upon my return, I was unable to
locate her until a few days ago, when I
was informed that she had become the
wife of anotherâ John Cosgrove, an iron
molder.
"Then I ceased looking for her and im
mediately searched all accessible records
of the divorce courts and found that Alice
Loretta McCoy had never been granted a
decree pf separation from me. Records,
however, show that she and Cosgrove
were married the same day the license
was issued in Alameda County."
When asked as to what action he would
take in the matter, the stranger declared
that he would most assuredly fiie a
charge of bigamy against the woman, to
be followed by proceedings for a divorce,
since certain property interests are in
volved. _ ______________
SAD CASE OF INSANITY.

SAN LEANDRO
HIS A SMALL
AMBITION
Would Like to Name
the Chaplain.
BRINGS OUT DR. PERRY
WHY THE LITTLE TOWN HAS A
RIGHT TO ASK.
It is Said That No Presbyterian
Minister Has Ever Opened the
State Legislature.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
'MS Broadway, Nov. 17.
San Leandro has been heard from. This
little town, which so hospitably received
the Republican county convention a cou
ple of months ago, has become somewhat
ambitious. It has a candidate for State
honors. It is true that its ambition does
not reach the gubernatorial chair, or even
a permanent deputyship in any State of
flce, lÂ»ut it would like to name the man
who shall pray at the opening of the ses
sions of the next Legislature.
San Leandro's claim is not without
some foundation. Certainly no other
place in Alameda undertakes to receive
political gatherings as hospitably as San
Leandro. At the county convention where
all the Republican candidates recently
successful were nominated San Leandro
earned the gratitude of all assembled
there. Banquets, music, free hall and the
daintiest of service at church luncheons
and similar little attentions were show
ered generously, and now San Leandro
wants her reward.
Rev. Barton W. Perry, D.D., is the
gentleman put forward as a candidate for
the chaplain of the Legislature. Dr.
Perry is no stranger to Republicans in
Alameda County. As chairman of the
entertainment committee of the now fa
mous convention, Dr. Perry made a last
ing reputation. To him as much as to
any one man was due the success of the
arrangements at San Leandro, and the
fact that a minister of the gospel was
selected to preside over the entertainment
committee at a Republican convention
justifies the claim of San Leandrans that
Rev. Dr. Perry was the mascot of the
party in the banner county.
Dr. Perry is pastor of the Presbyterian
church, and has alwajs acted in the in
terests of the Republican party with as
much effort as the dignity of his cloth
would permit. Some one has suggested
that it is doubtful if ever the Presbyter
ians, most of whom are said to be Re
publicans, had the honor of seeing one of
their creed supplicate for a California
Legislature. At the last Legislature the
chaplain was Rev. Charles H. Oehler, an
Evangelical Lutheran, and no <>ne re
numbers that a Presbyterian ever held
the office.
Dr. Perry has the solid support of the
party in this county, including Dr. Par
dee, Joe Herscher, president of the Gage
and Neff Club in San Leandro; J. I. Bar
beiro, president of the Portuguese Repub
lican Club.
The doctor's speech at the San Leandro
convention, -welcoming the delegates, was
a masterpiece and is y< t remembered. He
is not lacking in ecclesiastical talent. For
two years he was the editor of the organ
of his creed on this coa-st.
BUNKOED KLONDiKEBS.
Members of the El Sueno Company
Claim Were Robbed of a
Valuable Coal Mine.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 17.â Information has
been received from Alaska from the
Sueno party, of which Joseph A. Leonard
of this city was a member. Leonard rlad
to leave the party on account of an ac
cident which nearly necessitated the am
putation of his foot. He is now at his
home in this city under medical treat
ment. " v
Captain William Coffey of El Sueno
writes that the vessel has crone into win
ter quarters in a creek tributary to Dall
River, above Rampant City. Many of the
men have deserted the prospecting expe
dition, but their places were easily filled.
Coftey reports the outlook as being most
encouraging and then recites how El Sueno
Company lost *3u,(wo through the alleged
treachery ol one of its members. The
company discovered a coal mine near St.
Michaels. The property was left in
charge of one of the party while the rest
pushed forward to the Klondike country.
Coffey asserts that during the party's
absence the keeper of the coal mine sold
the property for the amount mentioned
and disappeared.
HARD'S COURT UNLOCKED.
All Furniture Has Been Removed and
the Wheels of Justice Have
Stopped.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 17.â The Constable's
padlock has been removed from the por
tals of Judge Hard's courtroom.
A grave legal question arose as to a
Constable's authority to bar a magis
trate from his courtroom, and so tne pad
lock was removed. Every movable arti
cle in the courtroom went v.ith it. The
tables, chairs, benches and books were
removed. Eyen the reclining chair upon
which the-^fudgi used to shine in all his
dignity, and the pen and ink with which
he signed his judicial decrees wore carted
away by an unsympathic Constable.
Justice Swasey, who pi c< ded Hard, re
tijf-<l because, as he states, but two
courses were left open to himâ retain the
office and starve or throw the glory of a
title to the winds, step down and out and
live. Alameda Township has had two
Justice Courts for years, and one of them
has always done all the business. One
department, by an act of the last Legis
lature will cease to exist after January
1, 189!).

U. C. STUDENTS
PREPARE FOR
THANKSGIVING
The Big Game Ab
sorbs All Interest.
EXCITING RUN ON TICKETS
SOCIETY HONORS THE MEN OF
THE PIGSKIN.
Berkeley at the Highest Pitch of
Excitement Over Football â Coch
ran's View of the
Prospects.
BERKELEY, Nov. 17.â A1l Berkeley Is
thinking and talking of football. So un.
usual is the interest manifested this year
over the gridiron, that old collegians de
clare the university never to have known
puch a uniform outburst of college spirit
before.
The excitement gets more Intense as
final preparations for the great struggle
grow apace. Cochran has decided to stop
all regular practice next Monday after
noon, thus giving the men but three more
dajs to put on the finishing touches.
Tuesday and Wednesday of next week
will be taken up with signal practice.
The same large number of spectators
continues to line the field at the after
noon games. Added to the yelling, which
is decidedly more original than in pre
vious years, the noise from the bleachers
has been improved by the addition of the
university band. The latter is a notice
able help in leading- the football songs and
relieving the rooters from making all the
noise all the time. Blue and Gold will not
lack for ardent support when it faces the
C'ar.iinal next Thanksgiving day.
Cochran is very reserved in his opinion !
about the men. He gives them no undue
encouragement; on the contrary, he in
clines to the opposite course. "Thus far
in the season the team has not shown
itself to the best advantage," he says,
"and it oueht to improve at least 100
per cent before taking chances next
Ihursday. I wish 1 could impress upon
the seniors that this is their last year in
college, and that from them at least the
very best effort possible should be forth
coming. I am a little disappointed fn the
way some of the men fall when tackled.
It is almost impossible to keep an East
ern runner from gaining his length after
being tackled, while out here a man goes
down at the least touch. It looks as
though they were too anxious to be
thrown. To defeat Stanford involves a
very great improvement in the team, and
this ca,a only be brought about by the
most faithful, conscientious work."
To-night's reception to the football men
at Harmon Gymnasium was one of the
larpf-st gatherings this season. The whole
college was practically there, including
both faculty and student body. The As
sociated Women Students acted as host
esses of the evening Music was furnished
by the band, the Women's Glee Club and
the University of California Glee Club.
The following committees assisted: Miss
Lola Simpson, chairman of the execu
tive committee of the Women Students,
in receiving and decorating. Reception â

This morning's sale of seats for the
game was unprecedented. Although the
sale did not begin till 9 o'clock, as early
as 3 some of the students living in the
university town braved tup night air and
took their places in line at the ticket
door. At 6 o'clock the line was long
enough to cover all the seats available in
the best sections. At 9 o'clock cash was
freely offered for places below the one
hundred mark. By noon the ordinary $2
seatfl in covered sections were selling for
50 cents and later for $1 above cost.
Full details about the performance to
be given Thanksgiving night in Odd Fel
lows' Hall, San Francisco, were an
nounced by the managers to-day. The
play is an adaptation from "Ici on
Parle Francais." and is full of local hits
and joshes. The cast, Intended as cari
catures of certain members of the
faculty is as follows: Major Zoule,
A. S. Chesobrough; victor Dubois. R. W.

A
My mother's headaches were of the sort that people call sick
headache. They always were in some way the result of a disturbed
stomach. She would have them sometimes more than once a week,
and then she might go several weeks without having one. Generally
an attack would only spoil one day, but sometimes she would be sick
for two or three days. When she learned about Ripans Tabules, she
found that they always relieved her decidedly, and her attacks are
now much less frequent than they used to be. She continues to make
use of the Tabules when occasion arises, but she says that now one or
two will not produce the effect they did in the beginning. She keeps
a supply of them in the house all the time, and I believe if she would
take them according to directions, they would cure her entirely. You
know her life is that of a farmer's wife. I suppose her experience is
that of thousands of others who stay pretty closely at home and de-
pend for food mainly upon those things which the farm produces.
Under such conditions the stomach will get upset now and then unlesg
precautions are taken to avoid it. Ripans Tabules are precautions.

lands cf the Atchison. Topeka and Santa
Fe Railway will, doubtless, secure great
benefits from the admission to the city
of the new transcontinental line. Since
the fact was made public that the com
pany had purchased the block bounded
by Bryant. Harrison, Main and Spear
streets, there has been an advance in
property values, and lease holdings are
now highly prized.
In order to utilize the new landed pos-
Bession the company may rush to secure
the surrender of certain leases. It is re
ported that G. Leisener, who occupies the
premises at 21 Bryant street, has declined
an offer of $5000 for the surrender of his
two-story frame building, and the lease of
the land on which the structure stands.
The railroad company will not be forced
however to submit to harsh conditions,
because additional land within the block
bounded by Main, Beale, Harrison and
Bryant streets, may be secured. Accord-
Ing to inside information an option has
already been secured for additional lots
In that locality.
The point is raised on the water front
that boats of the Santa Fe will find it
difficult on account of the swift tidal cur
rent to enter the Main street slip at other
than nlack water periods. The width of
the slip is 112 feet and the water is of
ample depth. Tiie Harbor Commissioners
are of the opinion that the tides will not
impede access to the slip. The Commis
sioners stand ready to lend the new com
pany all the facilities at their disposal.
TOOK A WIFE
FROM BOHEMIA
Jos. Salz' Choice Displeases
J-lis Family.
THE lights of Bohemia, are dim and the melody of Andalusia is wafted
on the night winds in broken and discordant strains. The satellites
of the Tenderloin mourn, for a good thing has passed beyond the
power of their wiles and fascinations, and the well-filled purse that once
was the ready source of many a bacchanalian revel loosens now its string
only to supply the needs of the wife.
Joseph W. Salz, thorough-going sport, has joined the army of benedicts.
But alas, his union has brought down on him the displeasure of a relent
less parent and the cold shoulder and ostracism of society, for he has
mated to please himself. Tudie Graham, fascinating Tudie of some twen
ty-three summers, whose charms, while captivating, are none the less un
savory, because of the gild and glare of the Tenderloin that in the eyes of
the strict moralist taints them, has proven the undoing of Salz. The couple
were married in this city on the 6th of last October, and are now residing
In Capitola, Santa Cruz County. Joe has sold his horses and traps, sent
for his personal effects and forever shaken from his feet the dust of the
city. The doors of his home have been closed against him.
The story is an old one, but for all that It loses none of its sadness and
only sympathy can go out to the parents of the young man. while for
himselfâ well, he or she who is without stain can cast the first stone.
Joseph Salz socially is down. "And of course being down should be be
reft of hope and friends,"' for he has transgressed the relentless precepts
of society, in that be, a man of education and social standing, has mar
ried a woman of the Tenderloin.
Joseph Salz formerly hf-ld the secretaryship of the Herman Waldeck
Company. He commanded a fine salary and was one of the swell young
men about town. Naturally in nightly revels with friends he became a
well-known personage to the denizens of the Tenderloin, and in this way
it was that he met the fascinating Tudie. She had come to the city from
Capitola, and when she met young Salz she made a rapid and complete
conquest. For a while the couple are said to have lived at 1364 Webster
street, where they had apartments.
The woman's power over the young man seemed to cause him to lose
all responsibility and to ignore all his obligations to his home and friends.
The breach widened and the doors of his home were closed against him.
Thon It was that young Salz. blindly determined against all the conse
quences, flew In the face of the world's disapproval, and as a last resource
grappled with honor In the unequal combat and made the woman his
wife.
It is now understood that the Main
street terminal of the Santa Fe is for
freight business only. There is sUI a
spare slip at the depot, foot of Market
street, for passenger boats, and two extra
.slips can be provided should there be fur
ther demand for passenger terminals.
The Santu Fe people may make some ar
rangement with the Oakland Rapid
Transit Company for ferry service. Ne
gotiations in this direction are said to be
under way. The indications are that the
Santa Fe will be able to offer to the trav
eling public better service than has ever
been given to the people of San Francisco.
An era of development surely awaits
the section of the city contiguous to the
Santa Fe freight terminals. The disburse
ment of money by the city as well as by
the State will be rendered necessary by
the new conditions. On tne city s part for
many years neglect has been the rule, and
anything like attention to the require
ments of commerce has been a marked
exception to the rule. To-day many of
the streets are closed. The open streets
other than those within the jurisdiction of
the Board of Harbor Commissioners, pre
sent examples of neglect and dilapidation
most discreditable to the municipality.
The demand for the extension of the
-.a wall to embrace this region of the wa
ter front will be made in a manner to
command public attention. With the ex
tension of the wall will come the opening
and improvement of streets leading di
rectly to deep water wharves. The Belt
Railroad can never accomplish the ends
which the public had in view when con
struction was authorized until the seawall
is extended from the point midway be
tween Market and Mission streets, where
it now ends, to the Mail Dock. Roughly
estimated, four sections, or nearly 4<)00
; wall, must be put in to round off
the system. The cost of extending the
wall to the* Mail Dock, embracing the ex
pense of removing existing wharves, will
approximate (800,000.
The long and short of the matter is that
'.1./' Harbor Commissioners cannot pay out
$4631 monthly to meet the interest on the
new depot bonds and provide means from
current collections to pay for seawall ex
tension. The Legislature, however, may
be requested to authorize the board to is
sue bonds for the extension of the wall.
Eleven sections of seawallâ 92o3 feet â
have already been constructed at an av
erage cost of $175 26 per foot, and a total
cost of $1,6i2.000. The projected work to
ward the Mall Dock from the wall's end.
between Mission and Market, Is likely to
cost more than $175 per foot.
The interest payments which must be
met from water front revenues will con
tinue until the expiration of twenty years
from the date of the bond issue. On the
water front from Mission street to the
Mail Dock the burden of keeping a thor
oughfare open for commercial accommo
dation falls chiefly on the State. From
the Mail Dock to Spear street the city
seems to have abandoned all effort to
keep an avenue open.
Trie Belt Railroad, in operation along
the seawall from Vallejo to Powell street.
has to some extent met the expectations
of the public. At Lombard street wharf,
for example, ship and car actually join.
The road is not self-sustaining. Inquiry
discloses the fact that the Commissioners
take a car from the boat to a freight sta
tion for a toll of 75 cents. The Eastern
Bfor similar service is $2.
is predicted on the water front that
arrival of the Santa Fe cars will bring
Jt an era of prosperity, development
improvement.

Second and third driving. ,
The light In Lantern burned out rapidly. The winner was backed for a "Wiling."
Mamie Scot was pocketed a greater portion of the route.
attending the races at Ingleside yester
day, and surprises in plenty awaited them.
Leiter. a maiden two-year-old, took the
opening event at odds ranging from 25 to
60 to 1, following which Bonnie lone, a 10
to 1 chance, downed a shifty bunch in the
mile run. Yankee Doodle, a heavily
backed choice, then had his light put out
by Kaiser Ludwig, a 30 to 1 outsider.
Rosinante finished second to Ostler Joe
in the handicap, starting favorite, and
there the dumps in a measure ceased.
Rosormonde, a first choice, and Outaway,
a heavily backed second choice, managed
to annex the two following events.
Bookmaker Hughey Jones overlooked an
opportunity to give the ring a severe jolt
ing in the two-year-old scramble for
maidens, first on the card. Leiter, with
Houck on his back, went to the post at
all sorts of prices, and overtaking Jerry
Hunt the last fifty yards, beat the Schrei
ber entry a scant length. St. Kristine,
the heavily backed favorite, got all tan
gled up soon after the start, finishing last.
Dr. Bernays, with Ward up, had first
call in the betting on the mile selling run,
with a field of seven going to the post,
and only a late run beat him out of the
purse. Bonnie lone, ridden by Powell,
collared the tiring Colonel Dan less than
a furlong from home and in a hard drive
led the favorite out a short half length.
Heigh Ho made a good showing, taking
the show from Colonel Dan by a head.
Trainer Bill Murry said Yankee Doodle
was never better, and all sorts of coin
went into the books on the sprinter, mak
ing him favorite over Zamar. After mak
ing all the running, the hot clip told the
last sixteenth, and he was headed out by
Kaiser Ludwig, on which McHugh rode a
very pretty race.
Five started in the handicap over seven
furlongs, with Coffey's mare Rosinante
enjoying first call in the betting. There
was a healthy play on her at odds of 7 to
5 and better, but no big money went that
way. At the last moment a plunge was
made on Ostler Joe. his friends getting
aboard at 7 to 2. Babieca, the rank out
sider, caused a scare by moving along
easily in front to the stretch, but there
had enough. Joe then assumed command
and Piggott won cleverly with him by a
length. Roslnante was second, two
lengths ahead of Satsuma.
At odds of 3 to 2 Rosormonde ran circles
around a cheap trio of platers in the six
furlong purse run. The highly br*d mars
won with ease from Novia. while La Ma
roma and Formella, two well-played oneÂ§,
finished in the order named.
The closing event on the card, a cheap

GRIEF CRAZED,
SHE CANNOT
SEE HER CHILD
Durie Heithier's Mother Collapsed at the
Receiving Hospital and Had to Be
Restrained in a Padded Cell.
The Wounded Girl Has a Slight Chance to Recoverâ She Bit
terly Denounces George A. Alexanderâ Calls Him
"Coward and Liar"â His Love Letters
Belie His Statements Assailing
Her Character.
Almost within hearing of her
eldest daughter's pitiful cries for
"Mamma! Mamma!" the mother of
erring Durie Heithier is restrained
from clasping her child in her arms.
Crazed with grief, the heartbroken
mother had to be placed in a padded
cell immediately after her arrival
last night. She became violently
hysterical, and it was necessary to
give her a sleeping potion. To-day,
if Durie's life will not be jeopardized
thereby, the mother will be allowed
to meet her child.
Although exceedingly weak and
Buffering agonizing pains, the would
be suicide has a possible chance to
recover.
Young George Alexander is bit
terly denounced by his discarded
sweetheart and her friends for his
cruel attempt to blacken her char- ;
acter. His letters to the girl, who ;
accuses him of her ruin, are full of
fervid love and promises of undying
faithfulness. Durie's school friends
understood she was engaged to Alex
ander.
Careworn and exhausted, Mrs. Car
lotta Heithier, the mother of the unfor
tunate girl, arrived here last evening
from Sonora. She at once repaired to
the Receiving Hospital, and as she en
tered she completely collapsed.
Miss Mitchell, who is acting as ma
tron, with the assistance of Steward
Kelly, carried her into the insane ward
of the hospital. As she seemed to be in
a serious condition. Assistant Police
Surgeon Tormey was immediately sum
moned. He advised her removal to one
of the padded cells and forbade any
one to see her. On account of her con
dition it was deemed advisable not to
allow her to see her daughter.

I wants, the unfortunate woman said she
! knew nothing of her daughter's desper
! ate atttempt at suicide until a telegram
j was shown her by a newspaper corres
!pondent at Sonora.
'What prompted her to shed her
i blood for such a man," she tearfully re
marked, "Is beyond my comprehension.
j She was always a kind and dutiful
; daughter, and as far as I know she was
never mixed up in any love affair.
1 This man Alexander must have com
pletely captivated her. As he threat
ened to desert her I suppose she be
came despondent and resolved to kill
I herself. Only a few days ago I received
; a letter from her in which she said she
was doing -well with her studies and
I was in excellent health.
"She did not refer to her love affair,
nor did she mention the name of Alex
ander. He must be a scoundrel to try
to blacken her name after she had shot i
herself. As soon as I have recovered
I intend to see my daughter and from
her lips learn the cause which prompted
her to attempt self-destruction."
The ward which Mrs. Heithier occu
pies is only a few feet from the cot
where lies her unfortunate daughter.
During the evening Durie awoke from
the stupor in which she was kept all
day and the matron in a gentle whisper
told the poor child her mother had ar
rived but that it was not wise for them
to meet until to-day. The sufferer
begged piteously to see her mother, ana
was only quieted by a narcotic.
Late last night Mrs. Heithier became
hysterical and in her delirium started
to destroy the bedding in her cell. She
raved madly and in a loud voice de
manded that she be allowed to see her
daughter. Matron Mitchell, fearing
that she would injure h.-rself. called Dr.
James F. Kearney, who was on duty
in the Receiving Hospital. After con
siderable trouble the doctor induced her
to take a sleeping potion and in a short
time she dropped into a sound slumber.
To-day if her condition is improved,
she will be allowed to see her daughter
Mrs. Heithier is trc-Ã¼bled with heart
failure and it is feared that she will
collapse when she confronts her wound
ed offspring. , ,
Mrs Gonzales, an aunt of the girl,

"HE IS A LIAR
AND A COWARD"
Durie Heithier Bitterly De
nounces George Alex
ander.
The bullet that shattered the young
life of beautiful Durie Holthier also shat
tered that life's Idol. Stripped of the
glamour of romance with which it is the
wont of the maid of the country to sur
round the man of the town, shorn of the
floss of fine verbiage and the polish of
his college, her betrayer appears to her
as he is. Through eyes dimmed by suf
fering she sees him a coward and a liar, ;
and with lips a-mmblt: with the awful j
pain that racks her, body and soul, she j
says of the things that George Alexander
has said against her that they are lies
all lies. And she does not quite under
stand how it can be so, for the hero of
her first fancy would never have robbed
her of her honor and then traduced her.
"Does he say that I have hounded him
and made him give me money?" asked
she, and her voice was eager, strong,
despite her life is hanging by a thread.
"Would I have wished to end my life
if only money had been refused me?
Ask him that. Money cannot pay for
love, and L have loved him, as God is
my judge. Why could he not give me
just that little In return for all that I
have given him? I gave him all, my soul,
my life. I'll not deny that now. and 1
hoped and prayed to have him love me
as I cared for him. And he led me to
believe that he did, until I discovered he
was deceiving me, and that has
me until I am nearly crazy. When he
told me himself that he would deny the
wrong he had done me I wanted to die.
"He is a liar and a coward," said the
sufferer, starting up In her couch again,
"and I don't want to die now, Sf it is
only to prove that he wronged me and
has lied so cruelly about me-. I want to
go back home where men are men, not
curs. I want to be with my mother. I
want to go away from school and all this
life and just live as I used to before I
met George Alexander. Oh, the coward,
to say these monstrous things. He knows
they are not true, not one word of them.
"There were tlmeÃ when I suspected he
was deceiving me, and one time they told
me he was, but when I asked him and
wanted to know the truth he laughed in
his old way and said he guessed It would
be a long time before he ceased to love
me, and I believed him. But I learned he
had been lying all the time: I found it
out when It was too late, and when I
asked him to treat me as he ought to â
I don't want to talk about that. I guess
I took the only way out of It. It will be

AND THE COLLEGE YOUTH PLEDGED HIS LOVE " FOR
EVER" TO THE PRETTY MOUNTAIN MAID.
hard on poor mamma, but God only
knowsâ l'm so tired of it all."
And Durie Heithier sank back in her
couch and closed her eyes. She had tola
her story as clearly as she might wltn
the terrible pain that racked her.
Young Alexander, the faithless lover, is
apparently endeavoring to escape further
notoriety. It is reported that he haa left
his home in Oakland and will be away lor
some time. His family and friends are
deeply distressed at the outcome of his
love affair with the pretty Sonora girl,
and they hope the scandal will soon be
forgotten.
Alexander flatly and emphatically con
tradicts the statements made by Durie,
and declares she has annoyed and har
assed him by threats and importunities
for money. He denies he is the author of
the poor girl's dishonor and desires to
shift the responsibility upon some un
known man. , Â
Alexander coolly admits guilt to a lim
ited degree only, and says the girl is to
blame for loving him. With the utmost
nonchalance he asserts that the story
wrung from Durie's moaning lips is a
falsehood from beginning to end. The
sad plight of his erstwhile sweet
heart and the anguish of her widowed
RELATIVES WATCH OVER DURIE HEITHIER.
mother awaken no chord of sympathy in
his heart. Even though the poor creat
ure was as vicious as he would have his
friends believe, he refused to spare her
family the greater blow. Alexander says
that 'several months ago Durie c-ame to
him and pleaded for money, informing
him that her disgrace would soo.i become
apparent to her companions and she
wanted to go away. He had no money to
give her and that was the last he heard
of the matter. According to the youth's
own statements, he has been the ac
knowledged lover of Durie for about a
year and a half. During that time they
have corresponded regularly. He swears
he never promised to marry her and that
he was in no way Instrumental in induc
ing the girl to leave home and go to San
Jose against her mother's wishes.
Durie'p friends, however, are now con
vinced that her longing to be near her
sweeeth< art was thj real reason for her
going to San Jose. Since entering the
University of the Pacific they have met at
least once a week. The young man made
frequent trips to San Jose and the girl
often came to San Francisco.
H;irry Ryan, the young man who loaded
the pistol for Durie before she left San
Jopc, culled at the Receiving Hospital
yesterday and asked to see her. Dr.
Thompson would not grant hjs request.
Ryan said he had a premonition that the
girl intended to do something desperate,
although he had no valid reason to think
so. She came to him with the weapon,
having taken the cylinder out and being

GIRL HE DISCARDED.
unable to replace it. While he was put- ,
ting it together she asked him about j
shooting horses and men. but her queries i
were in a jocular vein. Ryan tried to dis- |
her from carrying the revolver, but
she Insisted, and he gave it to her.
Mrs S. Edell of IGO4 Howard street, the
aunt of Alma Tannehill, was with the |
sufferer for a f^w hours yesterday afte *- |
noon. She requested Dr. Thompson to im- |
mediately notify her if Durie needed any- i
thing and she would supply money or
whatever was necessary to make the poor
girl comfortable.
A Mr Badger also telephoned that he
would call and told the doctor to draw on
him for Durie's needs. â 
Late last night the doctors reported that
Durie was very weak, but she still had a
chance to recover. During the evening a
message was received from the faculty
of the university asking about the girl's
condition and notifying the hospital that
the institution would give all assistance
possible to aid in the recovery of Durie.
Although the shock from the impact of
the bullet had partially worn off yester
day. Durie suffered intensely. She com
plained of excruciating pains in her left
side over the peritoneum. This symptom
led the doctors to believe the bullet was
located in that region. Opiates were ad
ministe"red constantly to keep the patient
quiet and relieve her agony as much as
possible. So far there have been no un-
favorable symptoms and unless a relapse
follows soon Durie may recover.
YOUNG ALEXANDER'S
BURNING LOVE
His Letters to Durie Were
Full of Endearing
Terms,
In his letters to Durie Heithier, George
Alexander expresses the tenderest love
for her. He wrote long epistles teeming
with burning words of affection, and be
stowed upon her all the pet names in the
ardent lover's vocabulary. So great Is his
affection that he takes her Into his "dear
ly loved university fraternityâ 'The Sigma
Nu 1 "âand tells her she, like the motto ,
of the fraternity, is his guiding star. He |
says, in one outburst: "I trust you with i
my dear fraternity's dearest possession,
'my honor.' Sigma Nu stands for honor,
friendship and love, and I am one of a
chosen few of that dear, grand f ra-
ternity." This Is his letter written to
Durie before she left home:
My Own Little Sweetheart: I have Just re
turned from Soulsbyvllle, but must answer
your dear letter, although it is twelve p. m.
I am a regular tramp, ain't I dear?. First at
one place and then another. I think 1 will
be in Sonora Saturday evening, so, dear, you
must bear my presence for the entire even
ing, all alone. Saturday evening I want you
all to myself, dear one, so you must grin and
b.-ar it. I am only Joking, dear, for I know you
will be glad to see me, won't you, my love?
I know you will excuse my last letter, dear
est, but I felt terribly mean that day, and,
love, my own, if I hurt your feelings I will
love you all the more, if that can be, to make
up for it. I know you love me, dear, and I
would trust you with all that I hold dear in
this world. I trust you with mine and my
dear fraternity's dearest possession, my honor.
Our one motto Is "Love your honor better than
your life." It is a grand motto and a dearly
beloved fraternity, Sigma Nu. Dear old "Sigma
Nu." But the motto is not too noble for the
Sigma Nu, if you only know what Sigma Nu
means. It la the iron band, love, for one
another, the band that binds a rhosen few in
honor, friendship, love, and If the road of
life be hard for a brother, "Sigma Nu" ex
tends a helping hand. For life are we bound
and none regret It. Is it not a grand thing,
dear? If I could only tell you all the mean
ing "Sigma Nu" means, dear, you would be
proud that I am a Sigma Nu; that I am one
of a chosen few of that grand, dear, noble fra-
ternity.
Well, dearest, you must excuse my enthu
siasm, but I do so love "Sigma Nu" aJid
love to talk about her and praise her.
I am feeling a little better now, darling, so
do not worry on my account. But you, dear
one, must take care of that cough. You will !
for my sake, won't you, my own sweetheart?
You must remember you are my baby now, and i
that I love you, sweetheart, better than all
the world, so, love, take care of yourself, for
you are mine always now. Don't be careless, |
dear, and catch cold, for my sake. When in !
the evening you pet the blues think of your |
true love, sweetheart, and how he loves you,
and that may help to cheer you. I think of
you always, dear one. You are In my dreajns 'â 
at night and my thoughts in the day time, and,
love, if you only knew how much I love you. \
But how can 1 tell you?. I can't. But you
believe me, sweetheart, don't you?
Well, my own, I must close. Will try and
see you Saturday evening and we will take a
walk. Will you. dear? I love to have you all
to myself. Good night, my own precious love I
and a kiss to dream of. I love you, my little I
queen, better than all the world and am, with
all my heart, yours forever, GEORGE.
Other letters are in the same erotic !
vein, full of endearing terms and prom- !
ises of everlasting affection. Here is an- '
other:
My Dear Little Sweetheart: I received your
letter Friday, but could not answer as I could i
not get up to Sugar Pine until Saturday even- j
Ing, that being too late for the stage.
I am about disgusted with this county, and :
believe me, dear one, had It not been for you
I would have traveled long since. |
I was not Immensely overjoyed with the tone
I of your letter, sweetheartâ too much jostling.
; I like a sincere and serious letter. Tou are
' not beginning to tire of me are you, my own
love? If so say the word, and I will never
be Been In Sonora again.
But darling, you do still love me, don't you 7
Tou do not know how much or how strong my
love for you Is; my dreams, my thoughts are
' all for you, my love. I love you. Durle, darling,
as I will never love again. Believe me, dear
heart, and only love me as you say you do,
and I am your slave. I know I am very queer
and somewhat erratic, but you will know me
better as our hearts draw nearer, dear.
This Is all the paper in the cabin, so I will
have to close. Write as soon as you get this
and address to Soulsbyville, bo I can get it
Tuesday or Wednesday. Hoping you are feel-
Ing better than I, with all my love, I am yours
forever, GEORGE.
In a later epistle Alexander's affection
seems to be cooling, and he writes only
of his own plans for the future. He says:
My Dear Durie: I hope you will pardon my
long silence, but it has been almost impossible
for me to write before now. I have Just re
turned from work and am very tired. I have
been working at Mare Island for the past two
weeks, almost day and night. There are now
seven war vessels lying at the navy yard for
repairs, and the Government has been rush-
Ing them through for Rome reason or other.
The general belief Is that trouble with Spain
and Japan Is expected. Two hundred men are
at work day an<l night, a^id no one Is allowed
on the island not employed there, and no mail
is allowed to be sent or received. Therefore,
dear, you see how it was. I went there unex
pectedly, so had no time to write. I am oft
on leave for a day and return to work to
niKht. My uncle has ( harse of the work and
all my orders come from him. I received my
commission In the navy. I don't think I will
stay long, only a few weeks more.
I will probably return to Sonora when the
water comes agrain, but no one knows when
that will be. How are you, dear? I am well.
Saw Phil quite a time ago, but did not have
much time to talk to him. Well, dear. I must
close, as I am so nervous I can hardly write.
Write soon and address Reliance Club. Oak
land, and I will get it when I get off next
time. Hoping you are well, with" love and a
kiss, I remain yours. GEORGE.

DURIE'S LOVE LED
HER INTO SIN
All Her Friends Uphold Her
Good Character.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 17.â The friends of pret
ty little Durie Helthler denounce George
A. Alexander for his malicious attempt to
besmirch the girl's character. The girl
bore an excellent reputation among her
â¢friends and at the University of the Pa
cific. Miss Heithier was always regarded
as an innocent little thing and only her
mad Infatuation for the man who branded
her as a Magdalen and a blackmailer led
her to attempt suicide.
Miss Wilma TannehJll, Durle's room
mate, knows more of the girl, perhaps,
than any ono else. She became acquaint
ed with Alexander and Miss Heithier at
â¢ Sonora. At that time the latter was only
116 years oid. Alexander was up there
studying mining. He did little work, de
; voting: most of his time to making love
I to the injured girl.
Durie never made a confidante of her
i roommate regarding her love affair. But
' she often spoke of Alexander and said
she loved him. It was understood they
1 were engaged.
Miss Tannehill is positive Durie never
I demanded money from Alexander.
Miss Heithier gave as her reason for
! going to San Francisco Monday that she
' -wanted to see her guardian. Ben Rucker.
! She was dissatisfied with the course she
was taking at the university and wanted
I to change to typewriting and stenography
or a commercial course, whereby she
could make her own living after she left
the school.
Dr. Modish, president of the University
of the Pacific, speaks very highly of Miss
Heither. She was a bright pupil and al
ways very lady like. Miss Bessie Mayne,
the' preceptress, also expressed the same
opinion, as did all her classmates. None
of Miss Heithier's friends have anything
but words of praise for her, while they
denounce Alexander's perfidy. She was
in love with him and often said that if
the stories of his fickleness that reached
her ears proved true she. would kill him
and herself. '

â¢ Objects to Unseemly
Haste.
The Jury in the Becker-Creegan case
was unable to reach a verdict as to the
! guilt or innocence of the alleged forgers,
: and yesterday morning at 10 o'clock
i Judge Wallace ordered it discharged. The
i jury retired to deliberate Tuesday even
j Ing at 5:30 o'clock. The hours dragged
' along with no word from the jury and
* Judge Wallace ordered it locked up for
| the night. Wednesday afternoon the in
structions were again read to the jury
and it again retired. All Wednesday night
it deliberated without result, and yester
day morning the members asked to be
discharged. The request was granted
without comment, and Judge Wallace set
the 21st as the date for the opening of
the third trial.
Attorney McPike, who was present in
court in the interest of the defendants,
i objected to such an early date. Henry
Ach, special counsel for the prosecution,
objected to a further continuance and de
manded that the case should again go
Ito trial on the date set. Mr. McPike pro
' fessed great indignation at the haste dis
j played, and stated that when the case was
I again called he would make a legal show
j ing for a transfer to another department
| of the Superior Court.
It is stated that Edward Lange, David
| Brooks and E. H. Seaman held out for
â¢ acquittal, while the other nine jurors mi
i sisted that the defendant should be con
victed.

PRESIDENT HENBY CROCKER'S
ADMUfISTRATION INDORSED
Convention Concludes Its Labors and
Re-elects the Old Board of Direct
ors With. Two Exceptions.
At the second session of the California
Wlnemakers' Corporation held yesterday
in the Chamber of Commerce, the mem
bers upheld the policy of President Henry
J. Crocker's administration by electing
the old board of directors with two excep
tions. Those were P. C. Rossi and John
H. Wheeler. The two gentlemen were
placed in nomination and would have been
elected, but both declined. They took
this course In order to avert criticism
since they are dealers as well as wine
makers. They retire with the best wishes
of the other members.
Ihe board as now constituted consists
of Henry J. Crocker, C. F. Montealegre.
B. W. Paxton, Peter Ball, H. V. Chase,
D. M. Delmas, W. J. Hotchkiss, Osgood
Putnam who represents Alameda County,
and C. N. Pickett of JS'apa, the last two
; being newly elected. The board will or
i ganize and re-elect Henry Crocker presi
; dent.
j At the morning session R. C. Terry, D. M.
i Delmas, Osgood Putnam and J. Jacobi, of
1 Lachman & Jacobi. addressed the mem
j bers, and made powerful arguments for
! a continuance of the corporation and for
harmony in its ranks. The question of
â  the continuance of the organization will
\ be taken up six months hence, as the
agreement will not expire until the pres
i ent vintage is disposed of.
It developed in discussion that certain
> members had violated the agreement en-
I tered into in 1894 to sell to consumers only
; and not to dealers. They had become ais
; satisfied with the price obtained for '96
; wine, and had sold their '97 product direct.
They had not as yet transferred their '98
wine to the corporation on that account,
but after listening to the earnest pleas
! made by some members to stand by tneir
: agreement they have agreed to carry out
: their promises, and will transfer their
! wine.
President Crocker was jubilant at the
I outcome of the convention, and predicted
a brilliant future for the corporation. In
speaking of i.Â»e situation after the ad
journment he said: "I believe that I have
succeeded in getting what I have been
striving for a long time, and that is vie
undivided support of the members of the
corporation. The members came to this
convention intending to find fault with tne
management, but when tilings were ex
plained to them they saw the wisdom of
our course and the result shows they have
unqualifiedly indorsed our administration.
The policy on the old lines will be con
tinued. By the address of Mr. Jacobi,"tne
members see that the wine dealers are
in sympathy with the producers and not
against them as hitherto been supposed
They realize that the dealer can not profit
in the long run unless the maker also
profits. We have been getting S^, and 10%
cents a gallon for our wine, and" we have
the bulk of it left on a rising market, it
is the first time in the history of the wine
Industry that the market is open, and this
has been brought about by the California
Winemakers' Corporation."
