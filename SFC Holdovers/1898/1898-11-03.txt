TRYING TO GULL THE PUBLK
WITH WORTHLESS BONDS.
- -Frank McDonald found that it was
easier to plan than to succeed in ob
taining money in New York. Securi
ties of the Pacific Bank were known to
be worthless and could not be floated
as readiiy as Frank McDonald â¢â¢sup
posed. On â -, the ". very " day . following â¢ the
foregoing letter, *he wrote: "' ~". ~

DICK TOLD TO BEWARE OF SHERMAN.
After Frank McDonald went to New York, In an effort to drag the Pacific
Bank off the financial rocks upon which the wreckers had lured it, he came
more intimately into association with M. H. Sherman and wrote the above
letter warning his brother to preserve the correspondence of Sherman. It
may be some satisfaction to the public to know that Dick obeyed the in
junction absolutely.

brother. There are few epistles in the long correspondence that are more bitter in their denunciation than
this.
McDonald referred in this letter repre
sented the organization of the New
York agency through which the Pacific
Bank and its dishonest managers
hoped to float the worthless securities.
The advertisement read as follows:

For nearly a year after the organiza

Donalds, their parasites, their agents
and their supporters maintained their
headquarters in New York. From
this headquarters, a coterie of flatter
ers, gamblers and financial sure-thing
men organized their efforts to impose
upon the finane'-? Ârld of N*>w York.
FRANK'S CRAFTY SCHEME TO
DECEIVE THE EASTERN .
BANKERS.
In the next letter that Frank McDon
ald wrote from New York to his
brother is a reference which is deeply
significant. Months after this letter
was written, R.- H. McDonald Jr. sent
a cipher dispatch begging his brother
to give him the opportunity to rob the
Pacific Bank. That opportunity was
given, and in the letter which Frank
McDonald wrote on August 9, 1892, he
says:
"I had to come back to New York to
attend to the Chemical loan matter."
Continuing, he declares: "We are trying
to get our investment agency plan into
shape, and I intend to try and sell a lit
tle of everything we have, so as to con
vert as much as possible into money. I
have made up quite a list of things with
Dyer and myself and I have put in a lit
tle Pacific Bank stock and People's Home
and other things to maks as characterful
a list as possible. How we shall succeed,
goodness knows, but this Is the place to
make a good trial. Your loving brother,
FRANK."
THE CAUSES OF THE RUIN OF
THF RIVERSIDE BANK.
While ft wafi the policy of the Mc-
Donalds to correspond with each oth<jr
every day, Frank MrDbnald did hot
again write to his brother until August
17. He then penned a letter that ex
poses completely the dishonest schemes
between the Pacific Bank and the
Riverside Bank. The financial fancies
of Frank McDonald, in connection with
the Riverside project, cost his father's
bank over a quarter of a million dol
lars. Frank McDonald led O. T. Dyer
into chimerical projects. D. S. Dorn
and others were used as instruments to
further the scheme and in the letter of
August 17, 1892, Frank .McDonald ar
cepts all the criminality of various
transactions that ruined the Riverside
Bank and helped to wreck the Pacific
Bank. The letter follows:
N. Y. City, Aug. 17, 1892.
My Dear Brother: You entirely
mistake my feelings with regard to
D. If anything, I am more incensed
toward him than you since I am the
one most largely responsible for the
Â¥osltion in which he has placed us, but
feel if there is any way to get our
money without closing him up and we
can follow It in safety to ourselves
we ought to choose It. You send me
on, and him on here, and Johns, and
we barely reach here and have no
time to turn round to see what may
be done when you say. no use trying,
let him go. Now, unless you are un
able to carry on the struggle for him
any longer I think we all here ought
to have a trial and see what can be
done.
I promise nothing, count on noth
ing until actually accomplished, but
there are possibilities here, perhaps
even great ones for us, and in a few
weeks when once we get the machin
ery started we may be of material
assistance in lightening your burden.
But this" is not summer, no one
feels much disposed to business, so
many people are out of town, and we
have all come here without the mate
rial properly gathered and in business
shape to work with and California
3500 miles away. Everything we need,
one. two. three weeks or a month
away. Things move exasperatingly
slowly and the very thing you keep
mentioning is the most difficult of all
to dispose of, namely, D. stock. I ex
pect sooner to sell some of his other
properties than to realize on that.
That must be handled very gingerly,
or all our efforts will be set at naught.
The reason we wish to sell the water
bonds of his first is that there is a
market for these and even if we get
only $60,000 or $75,000 out of them, that
Is a good help for a starter and we
must not despise little helps all the
while we are striving for large ones.
Mr. Clark will, he says, take more
of the water company's paper, and the
Park will probably give D. some ac
commodation. John and I are after
him. and we will try before long to
materialize something in coin for you.
If we find the task hopeless we will
shortly notify you and then you can
do as you wish. Only give us as much
time as you can, for this is a large
and slow field to work in. In the mean
while strengthen your position all you
can, for If the inevitable comes let
US be as strong as we can. Tour lov-

FRANK THREATENS TO KILL
JAYHAWKER.
. Through all the troubles of the Pa
cific Bank, a Colonel Woodard of L,os
AngeleÂ§ was on the track of the Mc-
Donalds and the schemers who sur
rounded them. Woodard had been a
newspaper man and was then a lawyer.
He was thoroughly informed o"n the af
GREAT EASTERN "FENCE" ORGANIZED.
When Frank McDonald went to New York to attempt to float the worthless
securities of the Pacific Bank and to gull the financial world of the East
he organized what was nothing more or leas than a "fence" o fthe Pacific
Bank. This concern was to be the mask behind which the McDonalds, M.
H. Sherman, A. F. Johns and the other manipulators were to operate.
The establishment was known as Edminster & Co.

Nemesis to Sherman. The newspaper

Times under the name of "Jayhawker,
.and at every opportunity prodded-
Sherman and his knavish supporters in
the Pacific Bank. In August of 189.2-
Woodard's interference became almost
unbearable and Frank McDonald wrote
to his brother as follows, promising
Dick that at the first opportunity he
would kill the newspaper man: ..

A PROPHETIC WARNING TO
BEWARE OF M. H, SHER

During the months and years that
were occupied in ruining the Pacific
Bank not one of the manipulators in
volved trusted another. R. H. McDon

â  brother was afraid of him; both were
afraid of Sherman; all bf them dis
trusted Johns and Johns succeeded in
cheating them all. â¢'.,. *'

While M. H:; Sherman believed that
he was flattering .Frank McDonald into
inactivity Frank McDonald wrote the
following letter of warning to his
brother: "' .'-..â¢ " 'â¢ â¢
â  N. V., Aug. 17, 1892.
My Dear Brother.' Enclosed please
find letter from M. H., which I
wish, filed away. Hereafter we

forget things too easily. I have
other letters from him which I
shall send shortly. They are long and
I have np time at present to answer
them. I shall send on originals and
answers .to yoji, the latter for you to

.FRANK MATCHES HIS CRAFT
. : AGAINST HUNTINGTON,
. A few days after Frank permitted his
feeling with reference to Sherman to
: explode he "wrote Dick he. was on the
point of assassinating Dyer. In giving
expression, however, to his thirst for
blood- Frank permitted a second
thought to intrude #.nd allowed himself
to realize that the death of Dyer would
bring no money to the Pacific Bank.
.He wrote as follows: .
I have worked early and late to get
" : things .as far as they are, for I have
â¢t'p do everything myself. Even Dyer
pokes so In giving the data about his
â  things that F sometimes feel like kill

most- and which I feel we can all take

. Mohawk land- on the market in an

It beats anything I ever saw in attrac

true, if.- we -can' only get this thing
started, it .tfrill be a mint to roll money
in to ..you, -and- .then we: hold on to
much of it for so long, and it will all
be. uri.der our -control. We call the
company the Mohawk Valley Orange

6400 "shares at $100 a share, yielding
â  $640,000, allowing 10 per cent for com
missions, etc., in starting, leaving
$576.000,. the money all to go into the
. Pacific Bank, T to be the treasurer
..and one of the trustees for the seven
'years'- management. So you see the
money will stay with us.

FRANK PLANS TO DECEIVE
â¢ SHERMAN WITH FALSE
'â¢..,â â¢ CONFIDENCE,
On August 24, 1892, Frank McDonald
counseled his brother to be patient with
M.H. Sherman. Frank urged Dick not
to' quarrel with Sherman although both
realized- that Sherman had involved
them in a disastrous speculation.
Frank, with the cunning that after
ward suggested his gigantic scheme to
rob the bank, was alive to the impera
tive, fact that Sherman was necessary.
In begging Dick to be shrewd Frank
wrote:
My Dear Brother:. There Is no use
:in â â  further '- discussing the Dyer jmat
ter. In; all things you may be rlgla
excepting â your.: idea of my â , sympathy .:
for him. That Is . simply absurd. -But ="
as you continually, act on ; that ; , theory, , ;
I you j paralyze ' more tor ; less * all our ' ef- if
-' forts i here, v It 'â  almost ; seems Â« that â  you â¢'
do not wish to have us try i to pull him
- out. Such being the case, whenever
I you are | ready 'â - to close ; him ; out s I-, sup
! pose you .'will do it and end ; the matter
in your own s way. You ask me for
a2
definite figures and plans that will net
you so many dollars. I had none and
do not know that we will get a cent on
his account, but I do feel sure of one
thingâ that if you close him up you
will not realize a cent any quicker,
and you mayâ yes, certainly willâsub
ject yourself to heavy lawsuits and
most unenviable notoriety. You bet
ter let him try to work off onto others
some of his obligations, so as to im
part strength from all parties inter
ested in holding him up. Before long
* we hope to send something besides
words and promises and hopes.
Later â I note what you say in regard
to Sherman and the Electric road, and
much of It is doubtless correct. But
you must not let Boat prejudice you
wrongly. Remember M. H., with all
his faults, is of great value to you, and
the question is to decide just how he
can be of most service to all. Re
member the consolidation of the two
roads is not yet effected, and there is
a possibility of the second mortgage
bond holders or cable stock holders
trying to redeem the property, or at
least make you pay all possible for it.
I have'a very long typewritten state
ment about the road that shows his
head is much clearer than you suppose
in many things. But there are prob
lems within problems that are not so
easily solved offhand. I think you bet- .
ter go along patiently with him for the
present, arid- then- we will take up this
Electric matter. A few weeks will
probably not hurt much of the same
state of affairs. Your loving brother,
FRANK.
A NEW SCHEME OF CRAZY
FINANCE IS SUGGESTED,
. Two days later Frank McDonald il
lustrated in a letter his absurd notions
of finance. In the very midst of finan
cial ruin he suggested another idiotic
scheme by which- he hoped .to' utilize
the Pacific Bank and filch from more
merchants their money. In this letter
Frank McDonald wrote as follows:
My Dear Brother: I have for sev
eral years had in mind a proposition
that I have thought of suggesting,
but these complex troubles coming up
pushed it into the background.- . It Is
mis: Our issuing from the Pacific Bank
coupon time certificates of deposit,
PREPARING FOR THE FINAL CRASH.
Boon after his arrival in New York Frank McDonald wrote to his brother
Dick that the forces of the bank were organized in New York, and every
effort would be made to obtain money for the insolvent institution. If
. ! the endeavor proved hopeless Frank begged his brother to prepare for the
end and strengthen his position as much as possible.
â  paying* say, â¢on .five-year .certificates,
t 4 per cent and on ten-year certificates
5 per cent. D. O. Mills' bank in Sacra
1 mento -has been doing this for some
â time and has kept much money from
floating away from ' " there. You see
' the Savings bank cannot- issue s.uch
certificates, because they are obliged
Â° to declare dividends from earnings,
and although they do occasionally try
to specify a long rate, really they are
? over-setting their fundamental princi
" pies of organization and could at any
time be stopped by the Examiners.
With us it is different in- the Pacific,
â¢we can do as we please. You know
h the time is coming when the: commer
cial banks will have to- stop the Sav
ings' bank drain, and we better get in

BITTER " DENUNCIATION OF
â . MOSES H.. SHERMAN. â¢.
On August 31, 1892, Frank McDonald
wrote one of the most important
epistles in his long series .to his brother.
In' this letter Frank McDonald shame
lessly confesses that he wants to be dis
honest." He denounces Sherman and
exposes the motives' of the scheme In
â which Sherman involved him. He out
â  lines to R. H. McDonald Jr. how an
other parasite of the Pacific Bank may
be used to save the bankers from their
impending disaster. In. this letter
Frank McDonald writes as . follows :
N. Y.f Aug. 31st, 1892.
My Dear Brother:. We all know that
Sherman is tricky, dishonest, un
truthful, vainglorious and in many
respects most contemptible and
weaic; but. we also know that hia
name and means are more or less
tied up and compromised in these
matters, and it is greatly to his in
terest to pull them' out if he can.
We also know the man has consid
erable property in one form and an
other and considerable more prospec
tive wealth. You know he has cer
tain connections and influences that
ought to be of material aid in work
ing out these problems. And I think
we must admit that we shall be
stronger with him in our camp than
with him fighting us. Such being the
case, the thing to do is to make him
work, raise money and carry all the
load possible without calling on us
in any way. And â whenever you do
anything for him make him pay well
for it.
Now, as to the future of the roads.
I long since knew the problem is a
terrible one, and I have been all the
time playing for position so that in
all moves we should come out of it
the best; at least as well as any. We
have now in the bond exchange we
made secured a strong crowd, and we
can afford to all pull together and
take our chances.
Between you and me, confidential
ly, I shall be much surprised if the
roads pay within five years, and
I think the roads before very
long will have to be turned
over to the bondholders. And
â¢whatever interest they cannot get
they will have to take in scrip
and wait until the roajds can pay.
This being the case, stockholders'
liability should be guarded against,
and you better take put of our stocks
and bonds the Electrfkstock in Jen
kins' name and have aenkins make
a demand note for $50,000, 5 per
cent, with that as collateral, and then
we will have to rebate the interest to
him and give him the money in some
other way to pay such interest, we
giving him our checks and then we
will charge it up.
The private undertaking will be
that we sell it to Jenkins on the un
derstanding that we take care of the
interest for five years. But perhaps
it will be better to take a long-time
note, say three years, from him, and
not have the interest begin till ma
turity, we having discounted the
note. This last would be simpler. We
can sever the note when it expires.
Of course it would be better to have
some one outside the bank own it,
but I know of no good person, except
possibly Brown; but Jenkins we can
trust best.
I am in receipt of your telegram re
lating to Perkes placing the Electrics
in London. I have not much faith
in his success, 'because the first call
will be for a show of earnings. If
the cholera takes hold in England
and here in the East it will be very
hard to do anything, but we can keep
trying and can point to the Pacific
Coast as. the place where the cholera
never makes much headway. Your
loving brother, . PBANK.
Having: written this bitter denuncia
tion of Sherman, Frank McDonald tel
egraphed four days later to his brother.
In this telegram Frank McDonald re
turned to the old story of the Riverside
Bank. Sherman, his methods and his
motives were forgotten for the moonent
in the pressing necessity of the River
side Bank and Frank telegraphed:
NEW YORK, Sep. 3rd, '92.
R. H. McDONALD, Pacific Bank,
San Francisco: D. has finally dis
covered that water notes here are the
ones he wishes. I should like to kill
the fool. FRANK.
"NOW BLAZE AWAY AND
TAKE THE CONSEQUENCES."
A few days later the affairs of the
Pacific Bank had reached such a criti
cal state that R. H. McDonald Jr. de
manded from hia brother certain sums
of money to save the bank. It seemed
impossible to deceive the Bank Com
missioners further or' to make any ad
ditional imposition upon the public. In
answer to Dick's frantic letter Frank
McDonald wrote as follows:
NEW YORK, Sept. 9, 1892.
My Dear Brother: Your dispatches
and one from Mitchell relating to deed
at hand. I have nothing further to
say. You are there and managing
. things as you think best, and while I
am not convinced that the course you
are pursuing is the wise one, I am
tired of remonstrating and you better
run things to suit your own view. It
does not do any good to keep threat
ening; you simply demoralize all of
us. We feel no safety in trying. I
wash my hands of the whole affair,
and shall not advise one way or the
other in the future. We cannot ac
complish impossibilities and do not
propose to try it. Your continued ulti
matums are simply ridiculous; we
cannot work any harder, and spurring
on is not necessary. Now blaze away
and take the consequences. We can
not be worried into the grave in a
week's time. I am sorry we cannot
scare up -more money, but hope we
shall, have better luck before long.
Your loving brother, FRANK.
The Call will continue to-morrow
morning the chronological history of
Frank McDonald's secret correspond
ence. One of the most Important char
acters in this part of the correspond
ence will be William H. H. Hart, ex-
Attorney General of this. State.
RAVAGES OF SMALLPOX
IN MANILA CAMPS
MANILA, Oct. B.â The health of the
troops here at present is far from be
ing good, notwithstanding the state
ments of the Medical Department to
the contrary. At Cavite the conditions
are very bad. There have been over
forty deaths f. ore since September 1,
mostly from typhoid fever. One-third
of the officers of the Montana Volun
teer Regiment are on the sick list, in
cluding the colonel and lieutenant col
onel, who are unfit for duty. In one
battery alone over 75 per cent of the
men stationed there have been on the
sick list within a month, the officers
being affected as well as the privates.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1898.
The hospital accommodations are in
adequate. The suppiy of medicines
was exhausted at one time, and for
days there was nothing to administer to
the patients. The place 1b unhealthy
at best. The men are quartered on
ground floors where it is damp, and in
this country especially conducive to
llness. Many of the men worked them
selves ill during the process of cleaning
Cavite, but now that the sanitary con
ditions are being looked after an im
proved health record will doubtless fol
low.
In Manila the conditions are better.
The men are fairly well quartered
and are being given better accom
modations as fast as possible, and it
will not now be long before all reason
for complaint will have passed. Much
Of the sickness of the past can be
traced to the overcrowding of the men
while proper quarters were being pre
pared.
Malaria is the most common of the
diseases among the troops. A malarial
condition Is the natural result of the
climatic and sanitary conditions which
prevail. Typhoid fever also has devel
oped to a serious degree. The average
number of sick in the hospitals, in ad
dition to the number of men relieved
from duty by order of the physicians, is
800. The new cases reported to the hos
pitals daily average about forty.
There have been twelve cases of
smallpox among the soldiers so far.
six of which have proved fatal. The
regimental physicians have advised the
whitewashing of the soldiers' quarters
and the liberal use of corrosive subli
mate but there is not sufficient lime
or corrosive sublimate, or even a good
substitute, to be had. Smallpox is al
ways prevalent among the natives,
many having it as children. The doc
tors are doing everything possible to
confine it among the natives. No
cases have been reported for the past
five days. The hospitals, which in the
past, have been nothing more than
death traps, are being put into sanitary
condition. They are abundantly sup
plied with food and medicines are now
obtainable at a moment's notice. The
Red Cross has been grossly misman
aged and has been of little assistance.
Colonel Lippincott has steadily re
fused to give out any information to
the press from his office up to to-day,
and he does it now only through Gen
eral Otis. Colonel Lippincott said:
'.'With cooler weather a radical Im
provement is looked for."
General Otis recently inspected one
â¢of the hospitalsâ the convent hospital,
established since the capitulation of
Manilaâ and said it was the finest he
had ever visited.
For the three months ending October
1 the number of deaths in this army
from all causes number four officers
and eighty-three enlisted men.
NORTH CAROLINA'S WAR
FOR WHITE SUPREMACY
"Red-Shirts" Join in the Struggle
Which Was Begun Tour Years
Ago.
RALEIGH, N. C Nov. 2.â The fight
now being waged for white supremacy
In North Carolina began four years ago.
Persons opposed to the Democratic party
obtained control of the Legislature,
which resulted in the complete overturn-
Ing of the order of things which had been
in existence for more than twenty years.
The negro came to the front as a politi
cal issue. The black vote Is 110,000 and
entirely solid, not more than 2 per cent
ever failing to vote the Republican ticket.
White Republicans during the last four
years have been forced to give the ne
groes offices and now there are about 1000
In various positions.
"What are known as "red shirt" organ
izations are now formed along the South
Carolina border. Not since 1876 have red
shirts been worn in North Carolina In
political campaigns. Yesterday a thou
sand men wearing red ahirts paraded on
horseback- at LaureÂ»burg. The negro
fears a "red shirt" as he fears no other
being on earth.
YALE STUDENT MADE
CRAZY BY OVERWORK
Clad Only in His Nightshirt He Runs
Through the Streets of New
Haven.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Nov. 2.â Jacob
Verbe, a student in the Divinity School
of Yale University, who has been work
ing very hard and earning his way, sud
denly became insane this morning. Verbe
dashed out of his room, clad only in his
nightshirt, with a Bible in his hand, and
started directly across the green for the
town pump, where he was found by a
policeman, who took him to the central
police station. In the ptÂ».ice station Verbe
called for several of the professors of
the Divinity School, who were sent for
by the police. They had the young man
taken to Grace Hospital for treatment.
Verbe entered the Divinity School this
fall from Lebanon Valley College. His
home is in Philadelphia, and he appears
to be about 38 years old. He has been
getting his own meals and his classmates
believed that he lived on one meal a day.
He usually studied until 4 o'clock in the
morning.
NOT ACCEPTABLE
FOR ORDINATION
DANBURY, Conn., Nov. 2.â Edward
Russell Evans, a cousin of Captain Rob
ley D. Evans of the United States navy,
was to have, been ordained a clergyman
of the Congregational church last even
ing in Redding. A sensation was created
by an abrupt announcement to the large
congregation which assembled to see the
ceremony that the council had decided
that the young man s views upon theo
logical matters were such that the church
could not accept him.
The young man is a student at Yale
Divinity School, and will complete his
course there in the spring.
EX-SENATOR HILL ON
REPUBLICAI "FEArtS"
NEW YORK, Nov. 2.â Ex-Senator
David B. Hill made an interesting
speech at Carnegie Hall to-night. In
the course of his remarks Mr. Hill
said:
This terrible anxiety, largely affected,
of our Republican friends, for fear that
the war may be renewed in case of a
Democratic victory, is really pitiful. It
is also difficult to appreciate the appre
hension of our opponents that the Demo
crats may embarrass the President in
perfecting his plans for securnig perman
ent peace.
Senator Lodge of Massachusetts, in a
speech in this city last week, in one of
his flights of fancy, said in substance that
if his audience was not in favor of plac
ing the people of the Philippine Islands
back under the rule of Spanish tyranny
they should vote for the Republican State
ticket, canal frauds, Raines law, force
bill and all. I beg to suggest to the dis
tinguished Senator that neither he nor
anybody else knows what the policy of
the present administration may be as to
the Philippines. That policy has never
been declared; on the contrary, it . has
been carefully concealed. The only ex
pression heard from any member of the
administration was from the ex-Secre
tary of State. Mr. Day, now one of our
Peace Commissioners at Paris, who some
time ago publicly announced that he did
not favor the retention of thos,e islands.
Perhaps he spoke the President's own
views; who knows?
The truth seems to be that the Demo
cratic hostility which is apprehended
springs from a Republican fear that
some unduly liberal, over-generous terms
of peace, Involving a base surrender of
some of the conquered territory, may be
approved by the administration, to which
Democratic opposition would naturally be
expected. The suspicious delay in the
peace negotiations, which will undoubted
ly not be permitted to be concluded until
after election, confirms this view of the
situation.
Democratic hostility to a humiliating
compromise with Spain which may be ac
cepted by a weak and vacillating ad
ministration is what Republican leaders
fear, rather than Democratic friendship
or sympathy for anything that is Span
ish.

Lack of Beading Hatter One Misfor
tune Which the People of the
State Could Remedy
Easily.
BY CORPORAL FRED A. HEALY.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
MANILA, Oct. 7.â Should you ask
a soldier of the California Volunteers
what is his dearest wish, what he at
present desires above and beyond all
else, he would tell you that the one
thing that would make him happy
is to get home. Ask him what is
the next best thing he could wish for
and his answer will be it is to get
half way home. The boys who have
gone through the hardships and dan-
gers of active campaigning 1 , who have
endured all the privations and discom
forts of the trenches and the field with
out a murmur cannot stand the deadly
monotony and wearing Inactivity of
garrison life without longing to again
taste those home delights which they
forsook when they changed the white
shirt and patent leathers of the civilian
for the blue flannel and brogans
of the military hero. They argue they
left good homes and well-paid positions
to enlist as volunteers because they
thought that there was fighting to be
done and their country was in need of
its young, strong and fearless manhood.
Now, that the fighting is over and the
dove of peace has taken itself to roost
on the broken flagstaff of Spain, they
say that it is only proper that they
should be allowed to return to the
places in civil life which they left, and
that if Uncle Sam needs a garrison it
should be made up of regulars, of men
to whom soldiering is a profession and
a means of livelihood in peace as well
as in nar.
There have been rumors upon rumors
to the effect that an early departure for
the States is scheduled for some of tue
regiments at present stationed here,
and the betting on which regiments
will be the lucky ones and the dates
on which they will leave for home has
been lively in the extreme, some wager
ing that we are to be the flrst to go, and
others that we are to remain until the
last. Ihc- dates range all the wav
from the early part of next montn to
a year from next Uanusry. As It is
nothing hi definitely known, so uncer
tainty is added to the other specula
tive features of the situation. This
much, however, is a certaintyâ that
ninety-nine out of every hundred of the
boys down here want to get home "the
worst way."
Since our arrival in this place there
has been a great deal of illness in the
regiment, principally fever and dysen
tery, though smallpox" has also made
its appearance among the troops and
has been attended by a frightfully
large percentage of loss, seven patients
having thus far died out of a total of
twelve, if I am correctly informed. This
scourge has come upon us in its most
virulent form and all the efforts of
careful nursing, backed by everything
that medical science can suggest, seem
to go for naught. One of our surgeons,
Captain A. P. O'Brien, has been placed
in charge of the smallpox hospital, ow
ing to the long and careful study he
has madq of the disease and the expe
rience he has had with it while on the
Board of Health at home. He cheer
fully accepted the post, though it is one
attended by great danger and com
plete isolation, and the work he is do
ing for the afflicted should entitle him
not only to the highest praise, but to
some more substantial reward at the
hands of his Government. He has suc
ceeded in checking the spread of the
disease, at least for the time being,
and I have heard of no new cases being
reported in the last few days.
The fever, which is both typhoid and
malarial in its nature, and the dysen
tery have both been the cause of many
deaths among the soldiery, though I
am glad to say that, while we have
lost some men from both of these
causes, the mortality has been sur
prisingly small, considering the num
ber of men afflicted. I know of one
company, comprising 106 men, which
could only turn out forty odd men to
drill on one occasion. Yet this same
company has thus far not lost a singie
man from disease.
This must be ascribed to the splendid
work which is being done by our regi
mental medical department, and to the
untiring perseverance of Colonel Smith,
who spares neither time nor energy in
his efforts to improve the sanitary con
ditions of his men's Quarters and to
provide for the comfort and health of
his soldiers. He and Major McCarthy
have just succeeded in obtaining a fine
large building, capable of comfortably
accommodating over a hundred men,
which they purpose turning into a reg
imental hospital in the hone of reliev
ing the congestion which at present
prevails in the division hospital, and
providing a place where the boys from
San Francisco may obtain the greatest
care possible in their illness. This
building has been thoroughly renovated
and will soon be ready for occupancy.
Colonel Smith is also doing all in his
power to provide for the increase of
illness which is expected to come in a
month or two, when the sickly season
shall come upon us in full force, and
when the need for proper hospital
quarters is expected to be even greater
than at present. While I am on
this subject I wish to say to the
people of San Francisco that the
work they have done i!or their boys at
the front cannot be too highly spoken
of, and is deeply appreciated by the en
tire regiment, which desires to express
through its colonel its deep gratitude
to the ladies of the Native Daughters'
Red Cross Society, the Red Cross So
ciety of California and to the Fire
men's Association for the noble work
they haVe done in the cause of human
ity and for the comforts and delica
cies the troops have been able to enjoy
through the generosity and thought
fulness of these good people at home.
There is another gentleman connected
with the regiment whose work and in
fluence among the boys cannot be over
estimated. That gentleman is our
chaplain. Father McKmnon. He works
day and night, attending to the wants,
both spiritual and temporal, of his
boys, and by his many kindnesses
and by his untiring labor in their be
half has so endeared himself to the
rank and file that it I*; no exaggeration
vto say he is the most popular man
among th^ soldiers In Manila to-day.
He is forever thinking of some little
thing he can do to make the exile of
the boys a little more bearable, and in
his efforts neither work, influence nor
personal expense is spared. He knows
no religion in the good he does. The
Jew, the Protestant and the Catholic
fare just the same at his hands. Be
sides his priestly and military duties,
he has been put in charge of the city's
schools and cemeteries, the care of
which alone involves an immense
amount of labor.
The quarters of the California troops
are about the most pleasant in Manila.
The First Battalion is quartered in the
place which was formerly the residence
of the Governor General of Manila. It
is situated on the south bank of the
Pasig River, in the district of Malica
ban; the Second Battalion is on the
same side of- the river a little nearer
the center of the town, in the district
of San Miguel, while the Third Battal
ion is barracked across from them on
the same side of the river and a little
farther down, nearer the center of tha
city.
The boys arise at 5:45 o'clock tn the
morning, get breakfast, and then drill
for about an hour, while the morning
is yet cool. Drill over, all save those
who are detailed for guard duty, are al
lowed to do as they please until 11
o'clock, at which hour they must re
port in quarters, where they remain
until 3 in the afternoon, writing, play
ing cards, sleeping or passing the time
in any manner they please, so long
as they do not go out. This order
keeping them in is made to prevent
them walking about in the terrible
heat of the tropical midday. After 3
o'clock they may again go out, so long
as they appear for dress parade at 5
in the afternoon, after which ceremony
comes supper, then more liberty until
9:45, at which hour all must be at home
and in bed.
Numbers of the boys from different
companies are on special detail in the
quartermaster's, commissary, custom
house or other departments. These
fellows are allowed ration money and
commutation of quarters and live
apart from their companies. In many
cases they club together and rent lit
tle households of their own, living very
comfortably on a very small amount of
money.
The one thing that the boys down
here do long for, and the lack of which
they greatly deplore, Is good reading
matter. The men have so much, time
on their hands (the climate making it
impossible to do work other than that
which is an absolute necessity) that
they find it hard to know what to do to
pass the hours along, and a supply of
reading material, such as histories,
biographies, novels and magazines,
would be a perfect Godsend. The Call,
which is about the only paper that
makes any sort of a showing down
here, helps much. But books are what
we want when once the news has been
digested, and there must be many an
old volume floating around the homes
of San Francisco which could be easily
spared.
The city is full of embryo soldiers
who have come down here in one posi
tion or another connected with the dif
ferent staffs, commissary or quarter
master's departments,- who strut
around in all the glory of gold lace and
shoulder straps and look down with a
high and lofty disdain on the fellows
who carry a gun. These young gold
washed sprigs of army aristocracy are,
for the most part, sons of wealthy or
influential families at home, who have
never shouldered a gun in their lives
or who could not tell their right foot
from their left without turning around.
They have been appointed to soft bil
lets in preference to the men who did
the work and having had nothing but
a summer holiday themselves are ut
terly Incapable of appreciating what
the real men have gone through. They
sneer at and belittle the work which
f hey themselves did not fare and cast
a damper on the achievements in which
they had no part. The reports they
will take home concerning the work
of the troops and the shadow they will
cast on the brilliancy of our Oriental
conquest will be materially deepened
by the jealousy existing among the
troops themselves. Each regiment is
so much afraid of being outdone by the
other that every possible honor has at
least a half dozen claimants, each of
whom, while endeavoring to claim
everything for itself, does all in its
power to decry the work of the others.
The consequence is a great amount of
lying and the consequent confusion is
such that the seeker after truth is lost
in a wilderness of misstatement and
end by disbelieving everything and
putting the army down as an aggrega
tion of inconsequential braggarts. .For
tunately the position of California's
boys is so well defined that it is be
yond question and even the most en
vious are forced to admit that from the
day they marched into the Presidio to
the day they stood beneath the walls
of Manila they have been absolutely
the first in everything.
As I said at the beginning of this
article the boys are all anxious to get
home. Yet the regiment has used no
influence to accomplish that end. It
is composed of soldiers, not of poli
ticians. However much the boys may
wish to see their homes they will not
ask to be sent there, but will wait pa
tiently until their Government says
"come," then they will go as they went
forward to the conquest of Manila â
with a ringing cheer, each fellow rac
ing in the endeavor to be first.
PROMOTER HOOLEY ON
THE WITNESS STAND
What He Paid Sir William Marriott
and the Marquis of Abergavanny
for Patronage.
LONDON. Nov. 2.â The examination of
Mr. Hooley in the bankruptcy proceed
ings was resumed to-day and attracted
much attention. Hooley continued to
testify to the amounts, large and small,
paid to the trustees and directors in con
nection with his promotions. He created
a sensation by saying that he paid Sir
William Marriott Â£1000 for introducing
him at the -Carlton Club, and asserted
later that he paid Â£10,000 to the Marquis
of Abergavanny, a prominent Conserva
tive for the party fund. The witness did
not know whether the money reached the
party or not. Subsequently Mr. Hoojey
explained that he" paid the Marquis of
Abergavanny Â£5000 first and then a sec
ond Â£5000 because he was told that he
had promised Â£10,000. "But." the witness
Interjected, "thatjwas a_He."
PBOMOTEB'S HEAVY FINE.
Rucker's Punishment for Attempting
to Bribe Hooley.
LONDON, Nov. 2.â Martin F. Rucker, a
former promoter of bicycle companies,
who was charged with contempt pf court
in endeavoring to induce Ernest Terrah
Hooley, the bankrupt company promoter,
to alter evidence which reflected upon the
Humber Company directors, was fined
Â£200 and costs to-day, and was further
ordered to pay the money immediately or
go to prison. Mr. Hooley declared that
Rucker, in behalf of four directors of the
Humber Company, offered him Â£500 to
change some of the evidence presented
in the bankruptcy proceedings.
Farmer's Fatal Fall.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 2.â Myron Com

ing him to the stable floor, twelve feet
below. He struck on his head.
Shall We Keep the Philippines?
Public opinion Is divided as to the wisdom of

ventive and cure for malarial fevers, stomach
disorders, torpid liver and impure blood. It Is
agreeable to weak stomachs and soothing to ths
nerves.

SWORN STORY OF THE FATAL
WOUNDING OF CAPTAIN RIGHTER
MANILA, P. 1., Oct. 7.â Certain statements have been made and
published in the press in reference to the wounding in action and
manner of conveyance to the hospital of the late Captain R. Rich
ter the night of the battle of the Malate trenches, July 31, 1898,
which are untrue.
.We, members of Company I. First Regiment California United
States .Volunteer Infantry, make the following statement under oath:
Captain R. Richter was wounded in the head while his company
was advancing to the trenches under a heavy fire. He was imme
diately raised to a sitting position by J. J. Drummond, who at once
saw he was unconscious. Calling to his comrades for assistance,
they carried him to the rear of an old house near the road, where
â¢ First Lieutenant Otto F. Huber joined them. The captain opened
his eyes just at that moment and, recognizing Lieutenant Huber, ex
tended both hands and thanked God he had come. Lieutenant Hu
ber knelt down beside him and taking both hands in his, asked if
he. was badly hurt. "Yes, Otto; I fear the worst. Otto, take com
mand of the company and lead my boys to victory." The captain
swooned for a second, and on regaining consciousness asked Drum
mond, in- whose arms his head was resting, to take him back. He
wanted to die with his company. But at once he became uncon
.scious again and Lieutenant Huber and Lieutenant Moore, seeing the
wound was serious, and deeming it advisable to get him medical at
tendance as soon as possible, detailed Drummond to take him to the
hospital, and with the assistance of private F. E. Funge, Private C.
C. Garfield and Private William Spofford he was carried to the road
where a carametta driven by a soldier was halted. On being asked
by Drummord for the carametta to carry a wounded officer to the
hospital, the soldier said he was looking for a dead soldier and did
not intend to give it up. Drummond drew Captain Richter's pistol,
and finding it was his life or the carametta, the soldier concluded he
would give up the cart.
Captain Richter was lifted into the carametta. Private J. J.
Drummond (now corppral) jumped in and, taking the reins, started
at full speed for" the hospital, Private F. E. Funge bringing up In the
rear and h-elping push the carametta through theTnud. Privates Gar
field and Spufford returned to their company and reported to Lieu
tenant Huber. On the way to the hospital, just below the Passay
road, the carametta was halted by Major McCarthy, who asked who
they had.- On being informed that it was Captain' Richter, he exam
; ined the wound, felt his pulse and gave him some brandy; told
Drummond to drive as fast as" possible to the brigade hospital and
turn him. over to Major Crosby, which was done. Drummond and
'Funge- then returned to their company and reported.

/Summary Court.
.Afruirialdo has no power to release a
prisoner of war?"
"He has no power. The matter muse
be laid before his advisers."
: "Is Aguinaldo, then, not the Presi
dent?""
"He is President."
. 'â¢Without .the pardoning power ?"
â '. "He must consult the Council of Six."
: "Then what is he in the Government
âa mere figurehead?"
"As you have said. He has no
power."
''But will you lay the matter before
him?"
: "Oh, certainly. You are going to Bu
lacan. Well, you drive over there; it
is. three-quarters .of an hour by cara
matta, and I will wire you at 5 o'clock
.what the President says. You can then
return to Guiginto, which is nearer to
Bu'iacan than Maiolos, in time to take
:the train for. Manila."
That was the best I could do. 'i ou
will give me a pass to see Padre Garcia
and the priests at Bulacan?"
";-. "I will telegraph the pass to I;ula
csth." -.' " .
.'I went to Bulacan. The rain was fall
ing: In torrents, Che road was
execrable, and I was a good
three hours on the road. I stayed
there until 5 p. m. and I saw 100
Spanish prisoners who were literally
starving to death, who were ill and
without drugs or medical attendance.
The pass to see Padre Garcia and the
twenty-four captive priests, held in
comunicado In a dungeon unspeak
ably vile, came along by wire at a lit
tle after 5 o'clock, giving me just time
to see the prisoners for five minutes
before, the departure of my train. The
conclusion of the mind of the dictator
upon my application for Garcia's lib
erty did not come at all. Juan Paterno
had settled that matter while I was
talking to him at Maiolos.
On the day following my visit there
was a meeting of the secret Council of
Six at Maiolos, and Aguinaldo himself
was '"turned down" somewhat abrupt
ly. It seems that a promise had been
given to the Archbishop of Manila some
time ago by the dictator himself that
all the Spanish priests and civil prison
ers in the hands of the rebels would be
sef free. The secret council decided
that the prisoners, priests, women, chil
dren and made civilians, should be held.
The Most Illustrious Senor Don Emilio
Aguinaldo meekly acquiesced in this
ruling. The Most Illustrious Senor Don
probably argued that so long as his
confidential advisers permit him to live
he does not care a great deal for what
happens to the rest of mankind. I do
npt. believe, as a matter of fact, that
once Paterno and the rest find out that
the Americans have fathomed the little
game they are playing, they will hesi
tate" a moment to cut Aguinaldo'*
throat. â¢ A figurehead always loses its
effect in statecraft once its true pur
pose becomes apparent to the world.
The way in which sickness is increas
ing in the army is calculated to create
grave uneasiness, once the facts be
come known at home. Tp begin with,
we aTe not permitted to cable the true
condition: The purpose of a press cen
sorship, sq far as I have been able to
observe, seems to be to prevent the peo
ple at home finding " out too much.
Whether this is good policy the events
will probably show, but I do not be
lieve, myself, that anything is ever
gained by concealment." Besides, they
do not censor letters â and every man in
every regiment here will write home,
and write in a much more alarming
way than the newspaper correspond
ents would in any event. Every Ameri
can soldier here knows that sickness is
increasing in the most alarming way.
The California regiment, for instance,
which was the healthiest on the
ground up to the time the city
fell, has over 150 men on the sick list
now, and has been compelled to secure
a hospital of its own because, in the
first place, there was no more room in
the division hospital, which answered
all the needs of the Spanish garrison
before we came in, and because the
men sent to the division hospital did not
and could not receive that care and at
tention to which- Colonel Smith deemed
his boys entitled. Take the case, for
example, of young Horace Powers, the
lad who died on Sunday last of small
pox. Powers was a member of the
Third Battalion, which is quartered
apart from the balance of the regiment.
Dr. Farrell holds sick call for the Third
Battalion boys every day, and when he
discovered that young Powers was se
riously ill, and with smallpox, he or
dered him at once to the division hospi
tal. The man lay in his quarters for
three days after that, because there
was not room enough for him at the
hospital, and was privately taken to the
pesthouse, where he died. The pest
house, by the way, Is in charge of Dr.
O'Brien, of the First California Regi
ment. He lives there, apart from hiR
friends, nobly doing the work of hu
manity.

CZAR'S PLANS BEING PUSHED
BRITISH WARSHIPS AT WEI
HAI-WEI READY.
Now It Is Believed That the Rus
sians Are Preparing to Seize the
Valuable Treaty Port of
Niu Chang.
Special Dispatch to The . Call.
WEI-HAI-WEI, Nov. 2.â A1l the Brit
ish warships here, including the first
class battleship Centurion, the first
class cruiser Narcissus, the second
class cruiser Hermione, the torpedo
boat destroyer Whiting, the torpedo
boÂ».t destroyer Fame; the torpedo-boat
destroyer Handy and the first-class
gunboat Peacock, have cleared for ac
tion and are ready to go to sea at an
hour's notice.
The first-class battleship Victorious
and the first-class cruiser Undaunted,
at Chefu, are coaling to their full
capacity.
The greatest secrecy is maintained as
to the meaning of these warlike prepa
rations, but there is no doubt important
instructions are expected at any mo
ment.
A large Russian fleet is assembled at
Port Arthur.
LONDON, Nov. 2.â The dispatch from
Wei-Hai-Wei announcing the war prep
arations there officials here describe as
grave, coupled as it is with the Anglo-
French war preparations at home. It
Is surmised that Russia, profiting by
the present strained relations between
Great Britain and France, has decided
to push forward her claims in the far
east by forcibly seizing the valuable
treaty port in Niu Chang, which Great
Britain cannot permit, it is said.
A dispatch from London to the Asso
ciated Press October 20 says a cable
message had been received there from
Shanghai as follows: "A Russian reg
iment occupied the town of Nlu Chang
(province of Leao Tong) and the forts
at the mouth of the river Liaou on Oc
tober 15, thus securing 1 complete posses
sion of Niu Chang. The native troops
fled without making any opposition un
der orders from the Empress Dowager
and Li Hung Chang.
"A British gunboat was in the river
at the time. Its non-resista.nce Is re
garded as the virtual British abandon
ment of the whole of Manchuria to the
Russians and gives Russia an Invalu
able strategic point. Great Britain is
certain to lose the Nlu Chang trade, of
which it has had 80 per cent."
BATTLESHIP RENOWN
IN FIGHTING TRIM
HALIFAX, N. S., Nov. 2.â The Brit
ish battleship Renown is in full fight
ing trim and to-night the vessel tested
her electric searchlights. This week"
the Renown has taken aboard large
quantities of ammunition and naval
stores.
SYDNEY, C. B. 1., Nov. 2.â The Brit
ish warships Cordelia and Pelican ar
rived to-day from Halifax. Their visit
is regarded as extraordinary, as both
were supposed to leave for home to go
out of commission. The ships have
submarine mines and heavy guns
aboard, specially shipped at Halifax,
and It is reported they will mine the
entrance to Sydney and St. Johns, N.
F., harbors.

MINNEAPOLIS, Nov. 2.â The Thomp

FASHODA IS
NOT WORTH
WARRING FOR
Sentiment of the Press
of Paris.
FRANCE NOT READY TO FIGHT,
HINTS OF EUROPEAN COALITION
AGAINST ENGLAND.
At the Same Time the Newspapers
Point Out There Are Places in
the British Empire That
Are Weak.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, Nov. 2.â Everything indicates
the warlike spirit prevailing across the
channel. All the journals record the
British naval preparations with pessi
mistic comments. Nobody here desires
war. In the first place, Fashoda is not
worth it. In the second place. France
Is not ready. If force Is resorted to. It
will be England that insists upon it.
The Temps to-night even advocates the
avoidance of a struggle at any cost.
"France," It argues, "ought to consider
her interests and those of civilization,
both of which forbid an appeal to arms.
She ought to preserve her dignity by
imparting a new character to her rela
tions with the United Kingdom. Some
victories, either diplomatic or other
wise, are dearly purchased. By abus
ing the monetary advantage, the risk is
run of determining the general direc
tion of international politics in a sense
quite opposite to the real interests of
the country, which seems to triumph."
This means, presumably, that Eng
land is in a strong position, but that
if she pushes France too hard she risks
bringing about a European coalition
against her everywhere abroad.
In another part of the same journal,
commenting on the news of the day on
the Fashoda question, says:
"As the English Government does not
seem to be actuated by a conciliatory
spirit, it may be as well that France
examine the question of recalling
Marchand."
The Liberte attributes the recrudes
cence of the warlike attitude in Eng
land to the return of Mr. Chamberlain,
who may have thought that as France
accepts the principle of evacuation of
Fashoda that a few more threats would
procure further concessions from her.
"This is by no means certain," argues
the paper; "If Great Britain seems in
vulnerable, there are many points in
her empire where she may be attacked.
Her name is not exactly venerated in
Ireland, where a revolution might
break out the moment war was de
clared, besides which it seems fairly
certain that a strong Abyssinian force
is rapidly drawing near Fashoda."
AWAITING MARCHAND'S
ARRIVAL AT CAIRO
LONDON, Nov. 2.â A semi-official
note. Issued this evening, relative to the
reports of a settlement of the Fashoda
question, says:
"The matter is substantially in the
same position as when the blue book
and yellow book were published. It Is
npt anticipated that France will take
further action until Major Marchand's
arrival at Cairo on Thursday, when
explanations will, be forthcoming aa to
his reason for leaving Fashoda."
NAYIGABLF WATERS MUST
BE SECURED TO EGYPT
LONDON, Nov. 2.â Right Hon. James
Bryce, former Under Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs, subsequently pres
ident of the Board of Trade and now
Member of Parliament in the Liberal
interest for Aberdeen, speaking there
this evening, indorsed Lord Salisbury's
stand in the Fashoda controversy, de
claring that the military control of all
the navigable waters in the Bahr-el-
Ghazal basin, as well as the Nile, must
be secured to Egypt.
Referring to the increasing cordiality
between the United States and Great
Britain Mr. Bryce said:
"When last in the United States I
was much struck with the change in
public sentiment. The spontaneous out
burst of feeling in Great Britain when
the European powers wished to Inter
vene against the United States during
the recent war with Spain made the
Americans understand how close we
felt the tie between themselves and our
selves. They have shown that they ap
preciate and reciprocate our sentiment,
"I would never advocate a formal
alliance. At all events the obstacles
at present are serious, but all the con
ditions exist for a solid and durable
friendship between America and Great
Britain. They have no adverse inter
ests anywhere in the world, and they
have common alms In sundry regions.
Everywhere each can render a great
service to- the other. The Americans
and the British understand each other
better than they can understand any
foreign country. Nature and history
meant them to be friends, and the
closer and deeper that friendship is the
better it will be for the greatness and
welfare of both."

AGUINALDO THREATENS TO OUTLAW
CERTAIN OFFENDING FILIPINOS
MANILA, Nov. 2.â Aguinaldo, the insurgent chief, has. issued a
proclamation, pointing out that, although the stringent orders pre- â 
v-iously issued by him have been generally obeyed, a few Filipinos
have refused obedience and offended in various ways,- and he now"
warns all such that they are liable to be declared outlaws and to'
incur the extreme penalty.
The reference is apparently to the anti-American Filipinos".
In another proclamation issued simultaneously, Aguinaldo allows >
all armed foreigners, except Spaniards, to travel in Philippine terri
tory, but all such are forbidden to approach the fortifications or take
photographs of defensive works. . â¢ â â¢*. .

SPAIN'S COUNTER
PROPOSITION TO
BE CONSIDERED
Administration Will
Deal Squarely.
MONEY FOR THE PHILIPPINES
WHOLE QUESTION NOW ONE OF
DOLLAR* AND CENTS.
People of America Favor an Honor
able Settlement With the Dons
to a Resumption of the
War.
Bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Nov. 2.
President McKinley- and Cabinet
members have no idea that Spain
will refuse to consider the demand
made by the American Commissioners
on Monday and break off further nego
tiations.
The President believes that the Span
iards will make counter propositions.
These will be considered. A close friend
of the President says that it is ex
pected by the administration Spain will
willingly part with the Philippines for
a monetary consideration. This sum
will be a large one, and the whole ques
tion is therefore practically resolved
into this: How much are the islands
worth to us? If we cannot acquire them
as we did Porto Rico, without paying,
do we want them at all?
Members of the Cabinet recall the
fact that we paid Mexico for territory
which we had already won by conquest.
"Even after we had planted our flag
on the Capitol at the City of Mexico
we did not care to annex any of her ter
ritory without compensating the repub
lic for it," said one member, who added
that, aside from all other opinions, he
believed the people of the country now
desired an end to the war. They were
not in favor of returning to fighting
and the maintenance of a large -army
if there could be an honorable settle
ment orf the questions in dispute. To
secure this settlement the Philippines
would either have to be abandoned to
the Spaniards or they would have to
be taken and a cash sum paid for such
juat debts as existed. He had no doubt
the seizure of the islands simply be
cause this country was in a position to
do so would result in the resumption of
war. Such a struggle might not last
long, but there would be greater cost
involved than in paying what appeared
to be Just to the defeated 1 .
"The whole question," he said, "is one
of dollars and cents with the Spaniards.
It is for us to determine how much we
will pay. That is yet to be decided
and will not be answered for some
time."
BUFFALO TO CARRY

NEW YORK, Nov. 2.â The cruiser
Buffalo will .sail for Manila 10-morrow

They are intended to fill vacancies due
to illness and other cause's on the ves
sels of the Asiatic station. A large
amount of stores will also be sent on
the Buffalo. She is expected to make
the trip in about fifty days, traveling at
a speed of ten knots an hour. Com
mander J. N. Hemphill is in command,
Lieutenant S. W. B. Diehl, executive
officer, and Lieutenant George W. Lo

PARIS PAPERS CRY
"BASt HYPOCRISY"
PARIS, Nov. 2.â The Sollel to-day,
commenting editorially upon the posi
tion assumed by the American Peace
Commissioners, says:
"No monarchical rovernment -would
have dared to conduct Itself - 'ter the
fashion of the Americans, who are for
ever talking so much of right and lib
erty. The plan of the Americans is
now evident. It is to take all of
Spain's colonies and leave Spain the
debts of all those colonies. This is the
result of the 'holy war' undertaken to
Insure the independence of the Cubans.

Inch of standing room in the large hall
â¢ were occupied by citizens anxious . to

land who is sure to be the next Gov
ernor of California. And a heartier re
ception than that given to Mr. Gage
was never witnessed 'in* any political
campaign in this city. When Mr. Gage
| walked upon the stage with George A.
Knight the vast audience arose in the
seats and a mighty' cheer, followed by
a mightier one, greeted him. /. Men
waved their arms and shouted approv
ing greetings and encouraging prophe

many. minutes. i .'
Mr. Gage smilingly bowed ' his ac
knowledgment and every acknowledg
ment : was an incentive for another out
burst! As the cheering lulled a little
faint notes, as of far-away music t \were
heard, but the band was immediately
in front of the stage. During all the
shouting the musicians lustily endeav
ored to. make themselves heard, but
their efforts, painful to look at, were
of no avail until the audience had sat
isfied itself that the victorious candi
date for the gubernatorial chair had
been properly welcomed.
The meeting was under the auspices
of the Howard Republican Club, one of
the reliable and patriotic organizations
of the city, which has always been in
the fight for good government and clean
politics. When the demonstration to
Mr.. Gage had. subsided President Fred
Frey of the club presented Hon. Judge
..Coonfy, the chairman- of thÂ© occasion,
who said: .
,-â¢â  "It is the usual custom for the chair

Mr Ga?e arose - from his seat ; when
his name was mentioned, | and the con
cluding words of Judee Cooney's intro
duction were not heard except by those
within reach of his hand. ; The splendid
ovation given to Mr. Gage when he
came upon the stage was repeated, and
the second one exceeded the first in du
ration. The noise would partially die
out and he would attempt to speak, but
was again and again compelled to wait
.until a cheer was finished. As soon as
he could be heard he said: â¢
"Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentle
men: This splendid demonstration in

1 cates that the people are aroused to the
dangers surrounding the perpetuity of

â¢ logical and pernicious Maguirism, can
never prevail in California.

sentiments and , promises met with the
approval of the audience, which was

Several times he attempted to retire,
but cries of "Go on, go on," "Give us
more," caused him to continue. In
matchless eulogy he reviewed the his
tory of the Republican party and ex
tolled the administration of President
McKinley. Every reference to the
loved and admired President was the
incentive for an outburst of applause.
In reference to the State and municipal
campaign the orator said in part:
"This is a year for plain talk, not
oratory. Every man in his home, or on
the street corner after his day's work
is done, is an orator and can wield more
influence than he who speaks with
gilded words and rounded sentences.

â¢ Turner I have been ever sinee â nearly a
| quarter of a century. And iam glad of
It, for besides giving me a constitution
that has stood the strain of a hard
campaign, it has given me friends that
have stood by me through all the years
and will stand by jne through the
years to come. It fS from them that
I I have got my knowledge of the Ger
man character and from my under
standing of this character I know that
in this campaign, where we find the
fusion party opposed to the forms of
government and the rights of property,
the German-Americans will be found
entrenched as they always have been
behind the bulwarks of the party that
upholds the Government and stands
| for all that is right
"And as I have traveled over this
State these past few weeks I have
found that there is Just where the Ger
man voters are. And as I have trav
eled I have found such Information as
warrants me in assuring you to-night
that it will be a glorious victory that
will be ours on the Bth of this month.
"I am not going to talk to you long.
I am simply going to suggest some
things to you to think of. lam going
to direct your attention to the issues
that have been raised by my distin
guished opponent, James G. Maguire,
and that exponent of the confusion
creed, the Examiner. They have an
nounced that the railroad and the so
called funding bill constitute the one
real Issue that the Republican party
has to face In this campaign and
shall try to show you what that
funding bill isâ and that It Is not a Re
publican measure.
"The funding bill requires that ten
years after the day of its passage the
debt of the railroad and the Interest
upon It shall be paid in twenty semi
annual Installments. That's It In a
nutshell. Over, this law the Governor
of no State has jurisdiction, nor has the
Legislature of any State, and no action
body and nobody owns anything.' He is
the great enemy of monopoly, so he
says, and is yaliaiUly fighting the rail
road."
Mr. Knight then indulged in a sar
castic colloquy with "Jimmy," saying
he devoured locomotives and steel rails
daily, and was only waiting to get sight
of C. P. Huntington that he might with
one fiery breath annihilate that awful
old man. Resuming his argument, he
said:
"Maguire is insulting the intelligence
of the people of California. He knows,
as they know, that the Governor of the
State cannot settle the railroad ques
tion. The place to settle the railroad
issue is in Congress, but Maguire
failed to settle it during his three
terms. Is he deaf, blind, can he read,
can he hear? Two years ago Senators
Morgan of Alabama, White of Califor
nia and Jones of Arkansas prepared a
funding bill, the object of which was
to compel the railroads to pay their
debts to the Government. Where was
Maguire when this fight was on in the
House of Representatives; Where, in
the name of God, was he? Why did he
not jump in and with one little statute
kill off the railroad monopoly? He was
going about with a rapacious maw to
eat corporations, but he was not fight
ing for the people
"His Congressional record shows he
never introduced or voted for a bill
which would benefit the peopel. Yet he
has the effrontery to ask the people to
elect him Governor of this State."
Mr. Knight then reviewed the local
situation and closed with a fervid ap
peal to the people of California to in
dorse the administration of President
McKinley by sending a solid Republi
can delegation to Congress.
Julius Kahn spoke for several min
utes and was given a hearty reception.

THE IA/ELCOME
GIVEN GAGE
BY GERMANS
"Hurrah fuer Gage!"
"Hurrah fuer Patton und fuer Kahn
und fuer dcs ganze Republikanishe
Ticket."
Full half a thousand of the German-
American voters of the city of San
Francisco gathered last evening at Tur
ner Hall on O'Farrell street to cheer
themselves hoarse for every principle
and candidate on the Republican regis
ter.
Henry T. Gage they acknowledged as
a fellow Turner and received him into
their open German hearts as one of
their kind and almost one of the blood
itself.. It was an ovation of such great
good-hearted genuineness and cordial
ity that the Republican Governor to be
will carry the memory of it with him
to all time, however fares the battle on
the Bth.
He was cheered and cheered again
and again and only ihe lively tattoo of
Chairman Wieneke's gavel brought
quiet. Judge Frank Davis, who was
speaking, immediately gave way to the
fresh arrival and the next Governor to
be was introduced.
"While I have not the pleasure of the
personal acquaintance of this au
dience," said Mr. Gage, "I feel at home
among you. With the knowledege I have
of the German character I always feel at
home when I am among you, and I
can talk to you without the strain and
the tension a man is under when he
is making a political speech among
strangers. lam going to talk that way
to you to-night. lam Just going to tell
you in a quiet way a few of the things
that I think your thought should be
directed to.
"I have always been a believer in the
idea that as a man's body is built up
and trained so is his mind built up and
fitted for the biggest things that shall
engage It, and with that idea when a
young man I became a Turner, and a
AN OVERWHELMING
VICTORY FOR RIGHT
AND REPUBLICANISM
can be taken upon it by Congress itself
for a year. Where lies the issue?
"Maguire has traveled this State
from end to end denouncing it as a Re
publican measure and an iniquitous
law. He has not rested his tongue on
that score for any longer than he has
had to sleep, and I am going to tell
you Just where that bill came from. It
was conceived and drawn by that sub
lime man, that friend of all the people,
Senator Morgan of Alabama, a Demo
crat of the old school and a splendid
gentleman. He had studied the rail
road debt, and this measure he drew up
he considered the best and quickest
way to effect a settlement without loss.
to the Government. And another man
âone whom you all know, who, though
he Is a political bigot, is an honest man
and certainly without cailroad leanings
âStephen M. White, took that bill
when Mr. Morgan was through with it
and made it even stronger. It was
then submitted to their colleagues, and
every Democratic Senator in Washing
ton voted for it. And Maguire de
nounces it as a Republican iniquity.
"I love the Senate of the .United
States. It is the embodiment of the
highest and purest principles of our
Governmentâ God-given libertyâ it is
above reproach, and the grandest men
that this country breeds are to be found
there And when such men as th?se
and such a body as this says to a man
that this law is good, is just, is for. the
best interests of the people, I turn with
a microscope to look for this Maguire
who comes out to stalk the land, laying
claim to more integrity, more honor,
more honesty and greater wisdom than
all of the Senate of these united
States."
With an assurance that his adminis
tration would not be directed by rail
road or other corporations or bosses of
any ilk Mr. Gage gave way to other
speakers. He was called upon for more,
but he explained that as it was he was
out against the orders of his physician
and he was allowed to depart, but not
without a good-by that was as heartily
sincere as his greeting.
The other speaker of the evening was
General E. S. Salomon, who addressed
his audience in the tongue of the
fatherland and pointed out to them the
paramount questions that they are'
called upon to decide. Following is a
translation of the general's speech:
"It has always been the pride of the
German-Americans to go with the
party of progress and humanity. Up
to 1860 a large majority of them were
Democrats, but when the Republican
party proclaimed itself against slavery,
German-Americans in great number.s
left the Democratic party and joined
those who had placed the seal of con
demnation upon slavery. And when
the Democratic party of the South went
so far in the defense of slavery as to
attempt the destruction of the Union,
the German-Americans could only be
found in the ranks of the party that
stood for humanity and an indivisible
Union.
"In all my political experience I have
never witnessed a State campaign so
bitterly fought as the present one. The
people are aroused to the fullest ex
tent, and whenever they are it augurs
well for the Republican narty. This
great interest of the citizens in our
present campaign will make Henry T.
Gage the next Governor of California,
return a United States Stenator and an
almost solid delegation to Congress.

GRATEFUL
One of the most successful and enthu
siastic receptions held since the com
mencement of the present political cam
paign was extended last evening to Henry
T. Gage at the California Hall by the
members of the Afro-American League.
From the first sÂ«urfd of the gravel the
meeting- was characferlsitrd by a demon
stration of true loyalty that has not been
equaled in the scores of similar meetings
held by the white citizens of the city since
the inauguration of the campaign. To
the principles of Republicanism the col
ored man justly considers that he is in
debted to a great extent for the further
ance of his liberties and the elevation of
the race of which he is a member to that
condition of citizenship which belongs and
is afforded his white brethern.
With these sentiments clearly outlined
Albert Dennis, chairman, called the meet
ing to order and addressed the members
of the league on the issues of the present
political crisis, emphasizing the' duty of
the members of the league present of sup
porting and upholding the entire plat
form of the. Republican party, not ex- â¢
cep.ting a single plank aa it were that haa
been nailed there by the convention that
has placed the present candidates before
the people as worthy for their suffrages
and of their universal support.
"In the coming election," he said in
conclusion, "the negTO owes to himself
and to his party the duty, of voting, for
the Republican ticket from top to bot
tom. â¢. .
"We hope to find in the Republican
party in the future a man who- will go
down in the annals of history, as Abraham
Lincoln has done in the past, as. one of the
defenders of the rights of the black man
and one of the friends and promoters of
his liberties. We hope to see the day
when, as a consequence of, our allegiance'
to the Republican party, the life of a
black man and the virtue of ' a black
woman will be considered as sacred as
the life of a white man and the virtue of
a white woman."
At the concluaion of the chairman's re
marks several candlQates were, intro
duced. They briefly outlined the general
and appropriate sentiment of the rights -
of the negro and his natural place, of
equality with the white citizen. Among
others who spoke .were Julius Kahn and
Tlrey L. Ford.
The main theme of -Mr. Kahn's address
was drawn from the subject of racial
equality. In expounding this thought, the
speaker entertained a ditrressfon on the
remarkable increase of preatige'thÂ© nation
has gained with the. countries of the
world as a consequence of the past fifteen
months of the exercise of Republican
principles and liberal thought.
Upon the entrance of Henry T. Gage,
almost at the conclusion of the meeting, "
the entire audience rose a.nd, led by James
Morton, one of the members of the league,
gave vent to their enthusiasm in a se.ries
of wild hurrahs coined for the purpose by .
the members of the league.EXTRACTS FROM THE DIARY OF JAMES D.PHELAN

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, XOVEMBER 3, 1898.
DID I HEAR A BID?
MAGUIRE'S PROGRAMME
FOR HIS MEETINGS
LIVELY WORK LAID OUT BY
CHAIRMAN LAWLOR.
A Flying Trip to the North and a
Mass-Meeting in the Mechanics'
Pavilion.
Some lively work has been laid out by
Judge Lawlor, chairman of the Union
Campaign Committee, for Judge Magulre
in the next two or three days.
Four large projects are now being ar-
Tanged. A big day meeting at San Lean
dro on Thursday, a mass meeting at the
Oakland Tabernacle in the evening; a
flying trip to Shasta, Tehama, Butte and
Yuba counties on Friday, and a big
demonstration at the Mechanics' Pavilion
at 8 p. -m. of the same day.
On Thursday afternoon Judge Magulre
will address a large mass meeting at San
Leandfo. He will be accompanied by E.
L. Hutchison, candidate for Lieutenant
Governor; Senator White, Governor Budd
and other able speakers.
The large mass meeting at the Oakland
Tabernacle In the evening will be ad
dressed by the same speakers and several
local orators. M. F. Tarpey, chairman of
the Democratic committee of Alameda
County, has these two gatherings In
charge.
Jt became evident some time ago that
Judge Maguire began his canvass of the
State too late to cover all the Important
points. Three weeks ago It was believed
to be necessary to eliminate from his
projected itinerary the territory north of
Woodland. This prospect caused great
disappointment among the voters of that
region, and the committee has been beset
by all sorts of importunities coming from
every town and namlet, to have the
gubernatorial candidate speak in that sec
tion. Accordingly, on Thursday evening,
after the Oakland meeting, a special train
will leave Oakland mole for Redding,
which point will be reached about 7
o'clock on Friday morning. Judge Ma
guire will be accompanied by the follow
ing candidates on the State ticket: Ed
ward L. Hutchison, Lieutenant Governor:
R. A. Thompson, Secretary of State; Will
B. Green, Treasurer; H. P. Andrews, At
torney General; H. A. McCraney, Clerk
of Supreme Court* William M. Conley,
Associate Justice Supreme Court; Irving
H. Mulholland, Surveyor General; Chris
tian Runckt-1. Superintendent Public In
struction; Everett I. Woodman, Superin
tendent -of State Printing.
Requests are coming in from Intermedi
ate points to have the train atop long
enough for Maguire to say a few words to
the crowds along the way.
According to the programme as mapped
out, it is expected that Judge Maguire
will speak at Redding at 8 o'clock. The
train will then proceed to Red Bluff,
where a stop will be made; then to Chico,
arriving there about 1 o'clock. It is ex
pected that Marysvllle will be reached be
tween 3 and 4 o'clock. Short speeches will
be the rule of the day.
From Marysville the run will be made
to the Oakland rrfole without stop and
the party will probably reach San Fran
cisco about 7 p. m. It will be determined
by the various committees having the
meetings In charge whether they will be
held in halls or in the open air. At Red
ding Judge Maguire will speak from the
stand which was erected near the depot
when William Jennings Bryan visited that
point, July 9, 1897.
The officers of the various committees
which will have the arrangements for the
meetings in charge have been invited to
come to San Francisco on the special and
attend the demonstration which will be
held at Mechanics' Pavilion in the even-
ing.
The meeting at the pavilion for Friday
evening -will represent the largest gather
ing of the union forces, both State and lo
cal, during the present campaign. It is
intended to decorate the pavilion with
flags and bunting and to have an im
mense flag over the SDeakers' stand .in
order to improve the acoustic properties.
There will be bands of music and an anvil
crtorus of one hundred voices. Separate
stands will be erected for the singers
and the bands. All the clubs will pro
ceed to the pavilion from their various
headquarters. There will be no formal
parade. The general movement of clubs
toward the pa\'ilion will begin about 7:45
o'clock. The citizens are invited to bring
flags with them, but in addition to these
there will be 10,000 distributed to the
crowd as it enters the building.
Before going to the Mechanics' Pavilion
Judge Maguire will address a meeting at
Sailors' Hall, Mission and East streets.
Walter Macarthur will preside. It is
quite likely that it will be necessary for
Judge Maguire to go there directly from
the ferry. At the conclusion of his
speech to the sailors the audience will he
invited to proceed to the pavilion. Judge
Maguire and party will drive from the
Sailors' Hall along East and Market
streets to the pavilion, under the escort
of the uniformed corps of the Demo
cratic Central Club, accompanied by
bands of music, red fire and fireworks.
Colonel Charles H. Hoicomb will be in
general charge of the escort.
The Thirty-first District Maguire Club,
under the direction of T. E. Treacy. will
join the procession at the Palace Hotel.
The meeting at Mechanics' Pavilion will
be opened at 8 p. m. Seth Mann, chair
man of the Democratic State Central
Committee, will preside. The following
speakers will make addresses: Judge Ma
guire Hon. Edward L. Hutchison. Sena
tor White. Governor Budd. Hon. William
T Jeter. Mayor Phelan, Hon. James H.
Barry. Hon. William Craig. Hon. M. F.

Attorney Neuberger's Nose.
Attorney Neuberger, whose nose Police
Commissioner Gunst says he pulled on
Market street on Tuesday, was ready yes
terday to vow that on that memorable
occasion he saved his distance by about
four inches and a nose. He admits that
Mr Gunst's fist was shaken close to his
nasal organ, but declares that he only
refrained from "licking" his assailant
from consideration of the latter's health.
He claims that he has two witnesses who
will attest the fact that the Neuberger
nose was merely menaced. He denies
that he inspired Mr. Ashe to attack Mr.
Gunst, saying that the imputation of his
having much influence with Mr. Ashe was
altogether too much honor.
"If Mr. Gunst says he pulled my nose," 1
said Mr. Neuberger. "he is a cowardly
prevaricator. My only reason for refrain
ing from thrashing him on the spot waÂ«
the fear that he might sue me and plead
iocomotor ataxla.'

That the. silk, hat .feoss and his man
agers: were kicked :but "tiy; :the men
whom they sought to. buy was not sur
prising' to those acquainted .with the
situation. It is as weir known how aa
.it was three .months ago that the con
trol of. the Democratic party organiza
tion was â  stolen from the Harney-
Rainey committee of. 450 and turned
over to Mr. Phelan by a few political
shyster-S; who had no purpose in view
other than that of securing for them
selves- and their friends. the spoils that
would come from a Democratic victory.
The rank and file of the party was not
taken into the consideration of these
Hessians, and from the date of the or
ganization of the disreputable Commit
tee of One Hundred until the present
day the party voters have had no voice
in the selection of the State or munici
pal candidates, nor have they had any
thing to say. regarding the conduct of
the campaign.
During the past few months Mr. Phe
la.n has taken particular pains to call
those .members of his party not repre
sented by the Committee of One Hun
dre by such names as "thieves."
â¢"blackguards" and "tools of the allied
corporations.'" His pledges to the citi
zens of San Francisco, to the membera
of the Non-Partisan convention and
their sympathizers, and to members of
his own party who have upheld his ac
tions In the. past, contained the stipu
lation that he would devote his energy,
his time and the interests of his friends
to drjre out of politics the Democrats
represented by Rainey and Harney.
Instead of accepting the offer the
Harriey-Rainey Democrats have re
pudiated Mr. Phelan, they being some
what particular in their choice of po
litical, associates. Mr. Phelan now
finds himself deserted by the friends
whom he betrayed and ignored and
cast aside by the men whom he sought
to' ;buy with patronage and party
power;, in this predicament he at- :
tempts to cover his shame and defeat
by shouting that he is opposed by a
corrupt boss, who in turn is supported
in his acts by a corrupt following of
thugs, .ex-convicts and unpunished
criminals. The accusation is worthy
of the source from which it came. It
was to these same men that Mr. Phelan
offered his patronage and the control of
the party if they would indorse his can
didacy. Had they accepted the bait
and made the desired indorsement they
would have been held up to the view of
the public by Mr. Phelan as model Dem
ocrats who were united for good govern
ment â and Mr. Phelan. Not having
made the indorsement, they are ac
cused by the silk hat boss, who calls
them bad names and warns the good
people of San Francisco to beware of
them.
Mr. Phelan is making a spectacle of
himself, and the spectacle is not a
pleasing one.

but no plea such as this can be made now that peace

plenty of money to provide for its men amply and
decently. There are officers whose duty it is to attend
to supplies and to pass upon the quality. Somebody
has been derelict and ' deserves, punishment. Dis
missal from the sen-ice would be mild. The country
freely contributed of its sons to fight or to die, but
the people who sent their loved ones forth with bless
ings and cheers did not anticipate that the efforts of
the patriotic youth were to be rewarded by a diet of
worms.
Some papers are hinting that Spain may fight again.
This course on her part does not seem probable. In
entering upon a war there is necessity not only for an
enemy to fight with, but certain weapons, supplies,
ships and patriotism are absolutely essential.
PHELAN AND THE WORKINGMEN.
THE demagogic methods.' of Mayor Phelan are
aptly illustrated by a letter published in his even
ing organ, in which he seeks to make it appear
not only that the new charter fixes the minimum rate
of wages to Jbe paid laboring men employed on public
! work in this city at $2 per day, but that he was mainly
; instrumental in securing the insertion of the provision
' in the instrument.. In the letter referred to the Mayor
says: "The new charter fixes the standard of wages
on all public work at a minimum of $2 per day, for
eight hours' work, and, as you are no doubt aware, I
was a strong advocate of that provision."
This is What Father Yorke would call a flagrant
case of political mendacity. Phelan knows that the j
provisions of subdivision 24 of chapter 2, article 11,
of the new charter are a fraud and a sham. He knows
this because during the charter discussion last spring j
the subject was prominently mentioned and engaged
his particular attention.
It is true. that the new charter fixes the hours of j
labor for men employed by the city at eight per day,
and : the rate of wages at not less than $2, but it also
provides that all public work of every kind, character
and nature whatsoever shall be let out by contract,
which completely nullifies the section. Section 14 .of
chapter I, article VI, declares that "all public work
authorized by the Supervisors to be done under the
supervision of the Board of Public Works shall, un
less otherwise determine"d by the Board of Public
Works, be done under written contract, except in |
case of urgent necessity, as hereinafter provided," and j
"hereinafter provided", is found in section 30 of chap
ter 2 of the same article. That section limits the
power of the. Board of Public Works to order urgent
necessity. work by day's labor, to expenditures of less
than $500. . .
Thus it is =een that the $2 and eight hours a day
provisions of the charter are a fraud. They were put
in to catch the- thoughtless laboring vote, and, since
practically all work must be let out by contract, they
were designed to obta-in that vote by false pretenses.
Mayor Phelan ought to be proud of this exploit. He
should call public attention to it frequently. As a
friend of. the laboring men he is certainly a champion.
He has offered to them not a granite loaf, but a loaf
Containing a cobble.
As a specimen of demagogy the operation, however, |
can scarcely be called clever. If the workingmen of i
this city do not on Tuesday next resent the fraud
Phelan has practiced upon them in this connection,
they will be singularly blind and meek.
THOSE "CONSISTENT" DEMOCRATS.
... Â . - â 
/ \ N Sunday morning the Examiner, in a state of
v j jubilation so exultant that it fairly chortled
with glee, exclaimed with all the vigor of cir
cus poster type: "One of the most cheering features I
of the present campaign is that the people realize j
j what is at stake. Minor differences are forgotten, i
] and devotion to principle is bringing every advocate j
| of good government into line."
In explanation of this effusive delight the yellow
journal announced that the Harney branch of the
Democracy had resolved to call a meeting to con
sider the propriety of giving united support to the en
tire Democratic ticket â State and local. It added:
"Major Harney himself advocated such a course, and
there is no question that it will be followed."
Then the chortle proceeded: "The action of these
Democrats" is both patriotic and consistent. * * * j
These men have always fought under the banner of
Democracy, they .are devoted to those undying prin- |
ciples that the Democratic party represents and en
forces."
The meeting thus announced with such a hulla
baloo of joy was held on Tuesday evening. It re
sulted in a demonstration that the Examiner was right
in saying "the people realize what is at stake." I
Nevertheless, it was a surprise party and a confusion
to the yellow organ. The "consistent" Democrats, i
the stalwarts who are "devoted to the undying prin
ciples" of Democracy refused to be a party to the
trade with the Phelanites. They would not surrender
even for one-third of the municipal patronage.
Hence yesterday morning the Examiner change*
its song. The warble of rapture was re
placed by ah outburst of billingsgate. The "consist
ent" Democrats were denounced as "rats of civiliza
tion that inhabit the sewers of politics," as "thug
and prowlers from the Barbary Coast, dope fiend
and maquereaux from the most disreputable section
of the tenderloin district, men who spend more tim
in than out of jail, pickpockets and vagrants, sand
baggers and prize-fighters, keepers of low grog shops
City Hall hangers-on and Police Court shysters."
From this contrast between the language of sweet
ness and" light on Sunday and the hell howl on
Wednesday, it is clear the Examiner has learned by
long practice to express the extremes of the "whoo]
her up" at night and the 'difference in the morning.'
It has been there, this Examiner, and the
vivid references to "rats from the sewers" has all the
merit of realism. It has done justice to it
feelings, and Phelan no doubt read the wild tirade
with a sense of gratification that his sentiments hat
been so perfectly expressed.
Far be it from us to take part in this Democratic
fight. We have no side or part in the issue. The
Democrats who were "both patriotic and consistent'
on Sunday and turned out to be thugs, fiends am
maqueraux on Tuesday, may have actually made that
lightning change, or it may have been the Examiner
that changed. All that we know or care for is, tht
incident has given one more touch of humor to the
campaign, and in that we are sure the public will be
well pleased and enjoy the situation.
A SILLY ROORBACK-
ONE of the silliest roorbacks started by the
Phelanites and Maguireites in their despera
tion is the charge that the Republican candi
dates for the mayoralty and the Board of Supervisors
are hostile to the new charter, and that the legislative
candidates of the party will vote against it in the
Legislature. This statement is a plain lie without any
frills either to ornament it or to hide it.
The very first plank in the Republican county plat
form, immediately following the preamble, declares:
"We pledge, the legislative nominees of this conven
tion to vote for the ratification of the new charter by
the Legislature." The final plank, which sums up the
whole, declares: "No person shall become the can
didate of this convention unless he shall wholly and
without reservation indorse the principles of the
platform."
By pledging the legislative nominees to vote for the
ratification of the new charter by the Legislature the
support of that instrument is made one of the prin
ciples of the platform, and by requiring every nomi
nee to indorse the platform as a whole and without
reservation all the candidates of the party are bound
by express promise to join in that support.
The attitude of the Republican convention and its
candidates toward the new charter having been thus
clearly and strongly defined by the platform, the sub
ject is one about which no intelligent man can be in
doubt. That the organs and speakers of the fused
factions should attempt to misrepresent so plain a fact
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, XOYEMBEB 3, 1898.
as this shows how completely they have lost their
heads and how frantically they are floundering.
The question of the adoption of the new charter is
not an issue in this contest, unless Phelan and his
friends in making their treaty with Rainey and Har
ney have agreed to deliver the charter to the bosses
for slaughter in return for the votes of the push.
IS HE FIT FOR CONGRESS?
WE have referred to Barry's indorsement of
Spanish Minister de Lome's insult to President
McKinley, but that was not the only instance
in which' Barry has shown his venom toward
everything that stands for national pride and public
I order. When the anarchists murdered Canovas, the
j Spanish Prime Minister, and President McKinley for
j warded to the Queen Regent of Spain the usual for
j mal expression that passes between all nations under
such circumstances, Barry denounced the Presi
dent for it and declared that he would better have
sympathized with the devil for having to receive the
murdered Minister in hell.
Barry approved the murder of Canovas. "The
Firebrand," an anarchist paper in Portland. Or.,
which constantly denounced all government and all
authority, was jubilant over the assassination, and
when it became obscene was suppressed by the legal
authorities. Barry in his Star approved the course of
"The Firebrand," and said that if all the people in
this country who approved the murder of Canovas
were jailed, there would not be half enough jail room
on the planet to hold them.
Barry's idea for the correction of evils is to do it by
violence and murder. He has time and again advo
cated this in his paper, and has not scrupled to recom
mend physical violence to Judges as a means of con
trolling the judgments of the bench. He has stood
always against law and public order. A narrow and
ignorant man, incapable of logical reasoning, he sub
stitutes his passion and prejudice for reason and runs
to sympathy with violence. Because Canovas turned
the rough hand of Spanish law upon the anarchists
who, in attempting to assassinate the Prefect of Bar
celona, murdered innocent people, Barry believed it
to be right to murder Canovas.
Because the militia of Pennsylvania had to obey
orders and turn out under arms to guard property
during a strike riot, Barry denounced the citizen sol
diers and said that any one had the right to kill them
on sight, and that it was no more a crime to do so
than to kill rattlesnakes.
Every man must finally go to public judgment,
when a candidate, upon what he has uttered as ex
pressions of his opinions.
We have quoted but a small part of what this man
has said against government, against law, in opposi
tion to good order and plain patriotism. The utter
ances are his own. From the fullness of the heart the
mouth speaketh, and if Barry is to be judged by what
he has said he is at heart an anarchist and favors
cold-blooded murder as the best means for advancing
any cause to which he happens to be attached.
His nomination for Congress was a serious mistake
among the many blunders made by the fusion poli
ticians, and his election would put San Francisco in
the worst possible light before the world.
AMONG the men who are to infuse fresh blood
into the California delegation in Congress is
Victor H. Metcalf, the Republican nominee
in the Third District. His election may be taken as
virtually assured, for the district is strongly Republi-*
can, and Mr. Metcalfs personal popularity is calcu
lated to increase the normal strength of the party
vote.
While he is a new aspirant for Congressional
honors, Mr. Metcalf is not unknown in the field of
politics nor to the voters of his district. Born in
Utica, N. V., and graduating from the law department
of Yale in 1876, he came to California to make his
home in 1880, and soon attained eminence at the bar
and leadership among the lawyers of the State. Pos
sessing in a high degree the faculty of making and re
taining friendships, Mr. Metcalf enjoys a deserved
popularity for his social qualities as well as esteem
for his ability as a lawyer and his sterling integrity of
character.
A demonstration of the strength of his personal
following was shown in the contest for the Congres
sional nomination. Mr. Metcalf carried the primaries
by a large majority over all competitors, thus show
ing that he was the first choice of the Republican
rank and file as their leader in the contest and as their
representative in Congress.
Nothing but a feeling of over-confidence on the
part of Republican voters can lead to Mr. Metcalf's
defeat, and even that feeling is not dangerous at this
juncture. The people of the Third District are well
aware that the supreme issue of the Congressional
campaign is that of supporting the administration.
They know how much of national welfare depends
upon the maintenance of the Republican majority In
the Houfe of Representatives. Therefore, however
confident each may be of Mr. Metcalf's election, he
will go to the polls as a matter of pride and patriotic
duty to swell the California vote for the administra
tion party.
At the present time there is no one question suffi
ciently dominant in national politics to exclude others
from public attention. The maintenance of the
tariff, the settlement of the currency, the upbuilding
of the American merchant marine, the construction of
the Nicaragua canal and the solution of the many
problems arising out of the war with Spain, are all
to engage the attention of the coming Congress.
All are summed up in the one comprehensive issue
of supporting the administration. A vote for a Re
publican Congressman is a vote of confidence in
McKinley, while a vote for a Democrat would be a
vote of distrust, division and confusion.
These considerations will not be overlooked by the
voters of the Third District. Neither will they over
look the advantage to themselves of having in Con
gress a strong, brainy representative in harmony
with the administration. Local interests and national
patriotism are as one in this contest, and therefore an
overwhelming majority may be counted on for Victor
H. Metcalf.
While French and Russian editors are abusing
America's part of the Peace Commission, they forget,
among other things, the utility and beauty of attend
ing to one's own business. Also, that the formation
of the commission was in itself a concession Spain
had no right to expect.
The Wisconsin man who shot nine people because
some gay person had caused him to sit down on a
tack rather overdid the business. Still, somebody de
served to be peppered with birdshot.
Spain's representatives in the Peace Commission
threaten to appeal to the powers. There is only one
power to be considered in the matter. We are it.
Spain has not even the subdued satisfaction of say
ing, "All is lost save honor," for honor was the first
to go.

VICTOR H. METCALF.
SANDBAGGING THE SENATE.
Dear Sir: Plain people have a homely saying that the proof of the pud
ding is in the eating. When Mr. Phelan comes before you and me for oux
votes we have a right to inspect his record. What "has he done during his.
term of office? W r hat guarantee does the past give for the future? ."â¢
The Examiner has given a list of Mr. Phelan's good deeds as reasons that
entitle him to re-election. You and I have considered the first of these rea
sons and we have found that it does not bear inspection. However, it was
merely a wordy paragraph that might mean anything or nothing. Plain peo
ple like to deal with facts, and let us see what are the facts on which Mr.
Phelan bases his claim for re-election.
THE PASSING OF THE CHARTER
Is one of the benefits for which it is said that Mr. Phelan is responsible.
"He was foremost in the' constructive work of 4he new charter. He advo
cated with success the election of Freeholders who were free, and then" the
adoption of the great instrument itself. Five failures had been scored before
Phelan took up this work." ' â¢â '".' â¢â  '.
The plain citizen remembers that one of these five failures was engi
neered by Mr. Phelan. You and I recollect that at the election Of 1806 a
new charter was before the people and Mr. Phelan was a candidate for
Mayor. Mr. Phelan in the beginning appeared as an ardent supporter of the
charter. He believed in strong government, and he told us how all the evils
of our times would be plucked out by the root if the new charter were
adopted. In fact, he was the new charter candidate and attracted votes from
those who approved of the instrument. So much was he considered the rep
resentative of the ideas expressed in the charter that the faction of the Dem
ocracy opposed to him organized as the Anti-Charter Democrats. . â  ;â¢'
Mr. Phelan is an observing politician. He. saw that the new charter was
not popular. Many voters who were attracted to him .personally were re
pelled by the charter. Mr. Phelan realized his danger, and to save his- per
sonal cause he sacrificed the cause of the new charter. At his political meet
ings he drew a clear distinction between his own canvass. and the canvass
of the charter committee. With much iteration and many illustrations he tat-.
pressed on the plain citizen â that is, on you and me â the fact that he and the
charter were two very different things. He explained that we could vote,
against the charter and yet vote for him. He urged his hearers to this â¢
course, and with such success that some 14,000 .who supported him did not
support the charter. , :'â  ' -
The plain citizen can hardly understand such devotion to good govern-. â 
ment as this. Of course if good government means simply government' by.
James D. Phelan, the case is obvious. But if good government is a good;sys
tem well administered, then we are inclined to think that Mr. Phelan sa-cri
ficed good government to his zeal for himself.
Mr. Phelan is dealing with the charter now before the people as he was
dealing with the last. When the Freeholders were before the people Mr.
Phelan got into their fight late and did not remain in it long. When the
Freeholders were at work it was notorious that he was not at all pleased with â 
their doings. The new charter did not make the Mayor as much of ap auto
crat as did the old. Mr. Phelan resented this want of trust in his. ability to â 
run the whole city by a very cold campaign in favor of the charter when it
went before the people. . â¢â¢
Plain people like you and me do not wish to be unjust. We do not wish
to deny Mayor Phelan such credit as may be his in the matter of the chartef.
But we do not like to see him overlooking the organizations of merchants'
and other citizens through whose efforts the real work was accomplished.
When we see all these public-spirited citizens lost in the vasty deep of the
Plug Hat we are reminded that this is only another exemplification of Mayor
Phelan's proneness to pose as "I am Sir Oracle."
In the present campaign Mayor Phelan is touching the new charter is
sue with delicate fingers. There are two reasons why he is not making it a
more decided issue in his canvass. He does not, in the first place, wish to lose
the votes of those who, while personally friendly to him, are opposed to the
charter. In the second place, he does not wish to draw too much attention to
the legislative fight. There is such a thing as a still hunt for the Senate, and
in the event of a Democratic victory in the State Mr. Phelan's nominees
would hold the key to the Senatorial position.
The plain citizen does not condemn Mr. Phelan's ambition. Ambition is
laudable when the prize is worthy and the means are straight. There is no
more worthy prize before a rich young man than a seat in the United States
Senate. It is a legislative chamber as honorable as any among the Parlia
ments of the world. For these reasons those who aspire to enter its doors
should not follow devious paths or skulk toward it like the Indian from tree
to tree. If Mr. Phelan wishes to be Senator let him tell the people, and if
the people desire to honor him. Senator he will be. But he should not use
the charter campaign or the campaign for good government as a blind to
hide his real designs. Plain people like you and me are distrustful of those
who come to us under false pretenses. It is a pity that our system of electr
ing Senators encourages the sandbaerging of the office. When a man comes
before us and declares he has no desire but the welfare of the city, we are sus
picious if we see his eye glued on the Capitol of Washington. The plain citi
zen has no use for hypocrites, and as far as the nlain man ran c*Â»<Â» \f r- pi-,Â«u~
is an adept at hypocritical pleas.

BROKER AND CHAFING DISH.
"No, I haven't been sick," said one of
the younger Cotton Exchange men, jn re
sponse to the query of a group of friends.
, "I have been engaged in a set-to with a
chafing dish, and am yearning to inter
view the miscreant who Invented the
blasted thing. 1 want to dip my paws in
his gore. What was the trouble? Oh
nothing much. I heard it was fashionable
to be a chating-dish expert, and bought
one on the solemn assurance of the clerk
that the thing was as easy as lying. Now
1 never found any special difficulty inâ
but let that pass. What 1 tried first was
a Welsh rabbit. All chafing-dish liends
make Welsh rabbits, so I concluded it
must be simple. I got directions from a
chef on Royal street, and invited up a
few friends to watch me and get envious
Well. I couldn't remember exactly
whether you put in the egga first or the
ale first, and I guess I must have got
them switched somehow. Anyway the
rabbit looked exactly like a mustard plas
terâafter using. My friends told me they
liked me personally and were willing to
strain a point for courtesy's sake out
that they had families to provide ior and
would have to draw the line on rabbits
I threw the cursed thing out of the win
dw and nearly brained a nigger. The next
dish I attempted was a Josephine omelet.
Ever hear of a Josephine omelet? Be
tween ourselves, I believe it must have
been the cause of Napoleon getting tha"t
divorce from his first wife. A young lady
up on St. Charles avenue gave me the
receipt, and I have been wondering ever
since what the mischief I ever did to of
fend her. I asked an old and very dear
chum of mine to come up and help me
devour the dainty, and when I went to
work I was particular to follow directions
to a gnat's heel. The omelet resembled
a chunk of beeswax, and after eating a
small piece my guest pried open his mouth
and said he had just remembered an im
portant engagement. I had sampled a
section myself, bo I made no reply. I just
bowed him out and put in the Dalance of
the evening trying to get the Josephine
omelet out of my teeth. Yesterday I

At first the schedule was fixed at ten
days, an average of eight miles an hour
from start to finish. This was cut down
to eight days requiring an average speed
of ten miles. The quickest trip made was
in carrying President Lincoln's inaugural
address, which was done in seven days
j and seventeen hours, an average speed
: of 10.7 miles per hour, the fastest time of
any one rider being 120 miles, from
Smith's Creek to Fort Churchill by

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1898.
COLORED TROOPS
IN OPEN REVOLT
Mutiny at Camp Poland,
Knoxville.
OBJECT TO WHITE OFFICERS
TWO REGIMENTS ORDERED TO
THE SCENE.
Firmness of Commanders Averts
Serious Trouble^ â When Told
About Death Penalties the
Negroes Weaken.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CAMP POLAND, KNOXVILLE,
Term.. Nov. 2.â The camp of the Sixth
Virginia Regiment (colored) was this
morning the scene of a mutiny among
the men of that command. The men
in several companies refused to obey
the commands or orders issued by the
nine white* officers who were recently
assigned to the regiment by Governor
Tyler of Virginia. The officers as
sumed command of the various com
panies a few days ago, and there has
existed during that time a feeling of
discontent among some of the negroes,
who preferred to be commanded by of
ficers of their own race. The feeling
has grown until it evidenced itself this
morning in a positive declaration
against the white officers.
The regiment was called for drill at
the usual hour and the white officers
assumed command. To their surprise
and indignation the negroes refused to
execute the drills, and when pressed for
an explanation it was announced that
the presence of white officers was the
cause. The officers were inclined to
the opinion that it was a momentary
complaint, and accordingly sent their
companies out under colored lieuten
ants.
At police formation the same open
disregard for orders from the white of
ficers was apparent, and it was then
determined to report the matter to
higher authorities. Colonel Croxton,
commanding the regiment, reported it
to Colonel Kuert, division commander,
who in turn visited the camp with
Major General John Bates, who ar
rived in the camp for the first time a
few minutes before the mutiny began.
It was evident that serious trouble
was in order if the riotous negroes were
not quieted, and on that account Col
onel Kuert at once ordered the Thirty
first Michigan and Sixth Ohio regi
ments to the Bcene. These regiments
were under arms, but the Ohio boys
were turned back before reaching the
Virginia camp. Colonels Kuert and
Croxton, and also Major Johnson, a col
i ored officer of the regiment, addressed
! the men. They explained that such
| action was in direct violation of the
military laws and was punishable by
death, and that a continuance of the
same would bring the regiment into
most unfortunate disfavor. They as
sured the mpn that a complaint if such
they felt that they rightfully had,
should be forwarded to the Governor
of v irginia,- and they were assured
that such a complaint sent through the
proper channels would receive atten
tion from all officers concerned.
.Colonel Croxton stated very emphati
cally that a continuation of this revolt
! would mean rigid enforcement of the
! discipline covering such cases, and said
he demanded obedience and had the
power to enforce the demand. The
Muhigan regiment, which had ap
peared upon the scene In double time
and which was armed for battle was
ordered back to its camp and the ne
groes agreed to send their complaints
in through the military channels and
in the meantime to obey their white of
ficers.
It is not believed here that the white
officers will be removed, because it is a
fact that the negro officers who pre.
ceded them resigned on account of in
competenoy The Virginia camp ia
quiet to-night and no further trouble
is anticipated, at least for the prespnt
AMAZING DISCOVERY
OF GENERAL WOOD
Finds a Transport Leaving Santiago
Without Proper Supplies for
the Sick.
SANTIAGO DE CT T BA, Nov. 2â The
United States transport Victor was to
have left to-day for the United States
with a number of sick officers and
men. Fortunately Just before the hour
fixed for her departure General Wood
Military Governor of the Department of
Santiago, went on board. To his amaze
ment he found no provisions specially
suitable to sick persons, an entire lack of
delicacies and an insufficiency of medical
supplies.
General Wood declares that hereafter
he will pay a personal visit to every
transport before it leaves the harbor. He
thinks it very strange that, tor all the
experience had here in that line, the
medical department is not able to man
age its affairs better and that the Der
sonal supervision of the commanding gen
eral should be necessary.
Major Starr, inspector general of the
department, Is on a furlough of thirty
days.
General Wood Is preparing a Thanks
giving proclamation, being ,of the opin
ion that the Cubans ought to give thanks
for the blessings they have received The
Americans want to keep the day "in old
fashioned style, and are writing to their
friends in the north to send on turkeys

The steamer Josefita. which leaves to
night, will call at Santa Cruz del Sur to

REPORTED LOSS
OF A TRANSPORT
Fears for the Fate of
the Panama.
CAUGHT IN A GALE AT NIGHT
STORY BROUGHT TO SANTIAGO
BY A FISHERMAN.
Supported by Wreckage From the
Steamer â Three Hundred Per
sons Aboard the
Vessel.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Nov. 2.â lt is
rumored to-night that the transport
Panama went down in a gale in the
Windward Passage last night. This
rumor is based on the report of a fish
ing schooner which reached here to-day
from Cape Maysi.
Some foundation for the reported
loss of the transport is found in the
fact that a large amount of wreckage,
supposed to belong to the Panama, was
picked up to-day. Eight articles
marked "Panama" were found in the
water, but no trace of the vessel was
seen, so far as is known here.
The Panama, which was taken from
the Spaniards as a prize during the
war, was in bad condition when she
sailed from Santiago on Monday. Her
engines were out of order and her hull
was damaged. Her condition was such
that Postmaster Hugo Hydeman con
sidered her unsafe and declined to
place the mails aboard her. Many sea
men here say the vessel has been un
sea worthy for a long time.
When the Panama sailed from this
port she had 300 persons on board, in
cluding officers, passengers and crew.
Among the passengers were Repre
sentative John Dalzell and former
Representative George F. Huff of
Pennsylvania, who with a party of
seven Pennsylvania railroad men had
spent several days in Santiago investi
gating plans for constructing a rail
road to connect Santiago with Havana,
with which they had been favorably
impressed.
There were several officers of regi
ments now stationed in Santiago who
were on their way home, having been
granted leaves of absence on account
of illness. Most of the passengers,
however, were from Porto Rico. The
Panama was bound for ports on the
north coast of Cuba, for Havana and
for New Yorlc

Special cable to The Call and the New Tork
Herald. Copyrighted. 18i*8. by James Gor
don Bennett.
HAVANA, Nov. 2.â No reply to the
note of yesterday, asking that the date
of evacuation be fixed at January 1,
has yet been received by the American
Commission. General Parrado had a
conference with Blanco to-day on the
subject. Probably Madrid has been
consulted on the matter and instruc
tions are awaited.
I am told that the answer, which will
probably be given to-morrow, will be a
recapitulation of the arguments that it
is impossible to move all the troops un
til a month later; but as the Ameri
cans are insistent in the matter this
must remain their decision.
The Spanish Government has decided
on terms under which soldiers desirous
of staying in Cuba will be allowed to
remain. If they have served three
years in full they will be given their
discharge and paid a small part of their
salary, distributed pro rata, receiving
notes for the balance. Those soldiers
who have served less than three years
will be taken to Spain.
This rule concerning discharge ap
plies to the orden publicos, also, and it
is believed that the majority of them
will take the opportunity to secure free
transportation to Spain.
The date of meeting of the Cuban
convention at Marianao will probably
be postponed, as the representatives of
different corps may not arrive soon.
General Ducasse, representative of the
Santiago division, says they will sail
from Santa Crua to-morrow and may
not return for several days.
La Coste, president of the Junta, tells
me that the Cuban army in Pinar del
Rio Province is almost without food.
He fears they may be a source of trou
ble, as they are not allowed to forage
by their chief.

SCHOOL BOARD
TRIES A RUSE ON
THE GRAND JURY
Avoids a Meeting to
Audit Bills.
A FEW MEMBERS APPEAR
MAJORITY IGNORE THE CALL OF
THE PRESIDENT.
Would Prevent the Jury From Ac
quiring Knowledge of the
Board's Total In
debtedness.
The members of the School Board put
up a little job on the Grand Jury yes
terday afternoon, by avoiding the meet
ing which President Barrington had
called for the purpose of auditing all of
the unpaid bills of the School Depart
ment, amounting to come 530,000. Bar
rington and several of the members put
in an appearance at the city building at
3 o'clock in the afternoon and there were
several whispered consultations in the
corridors, after which the aforesaid mem
bers slipped silently away and disap
peared on the streets. There was no
waiting around in the Clerk's office, as
has been the custom, until a quorum ar
rived. The fact that there was to be no
quorum was understood from the start.
The arrival of two or three members was
evidently a part of the little game of
bluff. Had the ones intrusted with the
carrying out of the bluff remained at the
City Hall until 5 p. m., the usual time for
the assembling of the board, there would
have been less chance of detection. As it
was, they left about 4 o'clock, showing
that they did not expect a quorum.
The reason for these tactics is not hard
to discern. The board does not care at
this time to let it be known to the Grand
Jury in an official manner, that it is
$80,UOO in debt over and above its assets.
The meeting which President Barrington.
had called, for the auditing of the bills,
was evidently announced without due
consideration of the fact that the pro
ceedings would be just what the Grand
Jury would like to see, inasmuch as the
board would officially admit its indebt
edness on many accounts which have
heretofore been held back by the Finance
Committe-e. It is claimed that when
these accounts ccc the light of day
the aggregate will be $18,000 or $20,000.
The Grand Jury is now at work secur
ing evidence on which to proceed against
the bondsmen of the School Directors. It
will hold a second meeting for that pur
pose this afternoon. President Barring
ton, Sam AValler and other members of
the School Board have been cited to ap
pear and tell what they know about un
paid bills. It would have, therefore, been
the acme of bad policy for the board to
have met yesterday and audited bills.
The witnesses can appear to-day and
truthfully state that they do not know
exactly what the liabilities of the board
may be, as the accounts are not all au
dited.
Whether or not this evasion will go
with the Grand Jury is an open question, j
Those who claim to know the sentiment of
that body declare that the unpaid bills,
including 1 all that have not been audited,
will be demanded, and that the findings
of the Grand Jury will be based thereon,
on the ground that all of the bills are
presumably correct.

LOS ANGELES, â  Nov. 2:â One. rea
son, and a good and strong ' one,
why Henry T. Gage will receive
the old-time Republican "majority
from 1 Los Angeles County ' is' be
cause of the fact that the Republicans
have this year placed in the field a
county and legislative ticket that is ad
irittediy the strongest one that was
â¢ever offered for the suffrages of the
voters. The legislative ticket is par
ticularly strong. Six members of the
Assembly and two Senators are to be
chosen this year from this county.
The Republican nominee in the
Thirty-eighth Senatorial District will
be elected easily. He is one of the pio
neer settlers of the county and has al
ways been prominent in the Republican
control of the Nicaragua canal, and am
firmly convinced that that great public
improvement' will soon be under way.
1 believe in an increase of our standing
army to not less th*n 40,000 men and an
increase in the navy commensurate witn
our greatness as a nation.

MADERA, -Nov. 2.â Will A. Harris of
/Los Angeles addressed the largest and

to-night.' â¢â â  "The Republican County Cen

Fangu'i'he expectations more than realized
by the. attendance. E. E. Vincent, chair
man 6 f the committee, called the meeting
io o.'rd.er arid announced J. Vv T . Ragsdale
as the";<hairman of the evening. Mr.
RagsdaVe introduced Mr. Harris as South

As. Mr. Harris advanced to the front of
the. stage he was greeted by vehement
cheers and prolonged applause. For two
hours â he held the assembly spellbound
with the most .eloquent, unprejudiced and
Reasonable explanation of the great prin

good fortune of. a Madera audience to
listen to in years.
' Mr. Harris, for twenty years, was one
of California's most devoted and stalwart

he said .that when the. Democratic party
ceased to advocate true Democratic prin
ciples he' felt it his duty to cast his lot
wKli the Republican party, where he had
found a most congenial political home.
Mr. Harris addressed his remarks par
ticularly to the -young men of Madera
County, and demonstrated very clearly
the danger of placing men in office who I
ware not what they pretended , to be. He j
demonstrated that Mr. Maguire was no j
more a Democrat than he was the angel

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 2.â The Good Gov
ernment League and Democratic Coun
ty Central Committee are taking steps
to balk the gang's attempt to steal the
vote of the city to offset the big ma
jority the reform forces will get in the
country. The joint committee of these
two organizations has decided to offer
a reward of $250 for the arrest and con
viction of any one caught tampering
with the co-unt. All such offenders will
be arrested, and, with J. H. Campbell
elected District Attorney, conviction
will be possible. Watchers for all the
polling places have been appointed by
the Democrats and Good Government
people and Rea's disturbers will not be
tolerated at the polls.
Encouraging reports are being re
ceived from the country and voters are
rapidly getting into line to fight the
gang ticket. A good meeting was held
at Union this evening under the
auspices of the Good Government
League. E. A. Hayes, I. L. Vander
worker and county candidates were the
speakers. Saturday evening the Demo
crats will hold a big rally in the city,
at which D. M. Delmas is expected to
deliver an address and give the gang
a good "roasting."
'â¢Johnnie" Mackenzie and "Jim" Rea
are keeping pretty close to each other
these days and using all their persuas
ive â and threatening, too â powers to
get their disrupted forces into line. The
gang has plenty of money and is spend
ing it to get votes. This corruption
fund was raised by assessments upon
city and county officials and the Fire
and Police departments.
The Rea gang wants to elect, above
all others, B. A. Herrington District
Attorney and Thomas F. Morrison
County Clerk, and at the same time
defeat James H. Lyndon for Sheriff. By
capturing this trio of officers the gang
would really have control of things and
neck" (meaning Governor Smith) and
he, the speaker, would be only too glad
to be with them at the right end of it.
This open advocacy of mob law by a
man seeking the nomination for Dis
trict Attorney, as Phillips then was,
caused a great deal of comment, and
six days thereafter Governor Smith was
shot by one of the inmates of the home
whose brain had become diseased from
alcoholic indulgence. This is the man
ner of man that the unholy alliance is
using to defeat Captain Simpson, and it
can therefore be stated with a cer
tainty that Senator Simpson's second
term will begin in January.
The six candidates for the Assembly
are all good men. W. 8. Melick from
the Saventieth District, L- H. Valen
its members would be safe from arrest
and conviction. The registration of
voters also would be in their hands.
Herrington, the present District Attor
ney, has been a pnant tool in the hands
of Rea and his re-election means a
continuance of the same loose manner
of conducting the office. During his
term Indictments have been quashed,
papers lost and bail bonds stolen. His
last questionable act was to postpone
the trial of John Mathews, the drunken
constable, who shot Henry Hopken
in cold blood, until after election, in
order, it is alleged, to get the votes of
Mathews' friends at Milpitas. The
gang fears the election of James H.
Campbell, the anti-gang candidate, be
cause the dereliction in the office will
be exposed and all violaters of the law
punished.
The Sheriff's office is one Mackenzie
and Rea want badly. James H. Lyn
don, the Good Government nominee,
has the better of the fight. He has two
opponents, School Trustee R. T. Lang
ford and George Y. Bollinger. The for
mer is a Republican and the latter a
Democrat, but Rea owns both men
body and soul. Langford's record in the
School Department is so well known
that it need not be referred to, further
than to say that he assisted Boss Rea
in wrecking the High School for the
nomination of Sheriff. He is the same
Langford Rea told of on the witness
stand. He was the employer of Coun
cilman Martin, and when the latter was
caucusing with other Cc-uncilmen over
the election of policemen and firemen
Rea broke into the meeting and seized
Martin by the collar and dragged him
from the meeting, threatening him wiih
his discharge by Langford unless he
(Martin) obeyed his (Rea's) wishes.
Bollinger's i gang connections cannot
be questioned and he is as close to the
boss as Langford. He was Sheriff once
before and his record is still fresh in
the people's minds.
The other office the gang is making
a desperate fight for is that of County
Clerk. Thomas F. Morrison is Rea's
candidate and by his election the gang
hopes to obtain control of the registra
tion and have no trouble in holding the
upper hand in politics for years to
come. There are five deputyships to be
given out, making the patronage of the
office one of the best in the county.
Henry A. Pfister, the anti-gang candi
date, is making a good fight and his
excellent record of the past four years
makes him almost a certain winner.

Special IMspatch to ThÂ« Call.
NAPA, Nov. 2.â Napa Opera House
was too small to accommodate the great
number of people who turned out to
night to see and hear James G. Ma
guire. An overflow meeting was ad
dressed by H. M. La Rue, Democratic
candidate for Railroad Commissioner,
and local speakers in the courtyard
square while Maguire was speaking in
the hall.
The fusion candidate for Governor
was introduced by Major Fuller. He
said there were ten or fifteen issues in
this campaign, but only two or three
upon which he ccmld speak in belittling
terms of Mr. Gage and the railroad at
torneys who were stumping the State
with him. He stated that the Nica
raguan Canal question was an impor
tant issue in the campaign and claimed
that the Democratic platform provided
for its construction and control by the
American people, while the Republican
platform was ominously silent on the
question of its control, and for that
reason should not be supported. He
treated the railroad as the main issue
in this canvass and .criticized Congress
man Barham for favoring an extension
of the railroad debt; but he acknowl
edged that the Barham amendment was
a good one, as it materially strength
ened the bill.
He said the Republicans were mak
ing the war against Spain and territor
ial expansion the chief topic of the dis
cussion and were claiming for their
party all the glory for results achieved,
whereas the war was waged by Ameri
cans for humanity's sake, and if the
Republicans were entitled to all the
glory they were chargeable with all the
grievous mistakes made.
Judge Maguire said he never had
charged that Gage had been a railroad
attorney of the Southern Pacific. All
Charles W. Bell, a young man who has
had experience in the office, having
served for some years as a deputy and
as clerk of the Board of Supervisors.
Mr. Bell hails from Pasadena, and at
the recent Republican County conven
tion received a grand ovation.
W. A. Hammel, the nominee for
Sheriff, is a young man who was born
and raised in this city. He is of un
questioned integrity, has had experience
in the office as a deputy and will be
elected,
T. E. Nichols, the candidate for Audi
tor, is also a native of the State. His
father was the first Mayor of the city
of Los Angeles. Mr. Nichols has served
very efficiently for one term as City
Auditor, and he will be the next County
Auditor.
he knew about the gentleman .he, had
learned through the speeches Gage had
made in this campaign, and judging
from them as samples of the gentle
man's ability he could understand why
the Southern Pacific did not employ
him. He acknowledged that he had
cost the State a great deal of moneyâ
probably more than he was worth. But
for that reason the people should keep
him in public service rather than pay
for another in the school of statesman
ship.
In closing Maguire stated that he did
not consider the question of single tax
an issue, because it was not mentioned
in any political platform and could not
be enforced without the passage of a
State constitutional amendment. He
said that after the campaign was over
he would be perfectly willing to discuss
single tax with Messrs. Barnes, Knight
and Gage, if they would just inform
themselves sufficiently on the subject
to make it worth his while.
After he had finished Hutchison,
Democratic nominee fc-r Lieutenant
Governor, was Introduced. He paid a
glowing tribute to Judge Maguire and
predicted an overwhelming Democratic
victory for the entire ticket. . '. .
Although the audience was rapidly

Special Dispatch to The Call. â¢
NEW YORK, Nov. 2.â Theodore
Roosevelt began his speech-making to,
the Long Islanders to-day before the
business men of the city had- finished
their breakfasts, and by noon he b.ad
addressed audiences at ten or rnqre
stations along the line of the Long Islr
and Railroad. His principal topic was
Richard Croker, who last night at
tacked Colonel Roosevelt's adminis-r. :
tration of the Police Department durV
ing the Mayoralty of Mr. Strong. At ,
Southampton, for example, Colonel
Roosevelt said, that if the Democratic
ticket were elected in' the State it"
maant that every storekeeper in the
State would be laid under tribute to
Tammany Hall. ' â¢;
"Tammany," he said, "already black
mails vice and collects tribute from
those who thrive on vice., but it is now
beginning to levy tribute on honesty,
where honesty is helpless, and if you
elect Tammany you will assist in that
.operation." . ."â¢ â¢- â  .
The tour of the day closed with two
big meetings, one at Flushing at 8
o'clock, and one at Long Island City. â¢
R. D. Wade has served in the capa
city of City Tax Collector and dis
charged the duties of that responsible
office in the most satisfactory manner.
He has been rewarded with the nom
ination for County Recorder, and will
undoubtedly be chosen.
James C. Rives is the Republican
nominee for District Attorney. He lives
in one of the strongest country Demo
cratic districts in the county â Downey.
Mr. Rives is a young man who has
never before held public office, but
who has made an excellent record in
the practice of his profession.
John H. Gish. the nominee for County
Tax Collector, and Charles G. Kellogg,
the nominee for Public Administrator,

THE SAPPHO TO THE RESCUE.
An excursion party composed of nine men and women had a hard
time of it on the launch Homer a few days ago. Something went wrong
with the machinery, the boat sprang aleak, it came on to blow half a
gale of wind and for four hours the party was making signals of dis
tress and sails out of the ladies' skirts and the men's coats. Captain
Haven of the Sappho noticed their predicament, and after some very
clever seamanship got the Homer in tow and took her into Oakland
Creek.

. ' Leaking.
â . The cleverest piece of seamanship seen
on the bavin a long-time was the rescue,
a few days ago,' of an excursion party on
.'â the' gasoline launch Homer by the crew of
"the -.'yacht- -.- Sappho. It was blowing a
stropg. breeze;, and over toward the Ala
meda shore a heavy sea was running,
the Homerls .party, consisting of nine
men arid women, went out early in the
day and started for home as soon as it
began to blow. â  Just when it was most
'.wanted the' steering gear got out of order
and the launch began to leak. All kinds
of- expedients were resorted to to make
land. The ladies loaned their skirts to
.rnakQ' sails and a tablecloth, with a red
table' napkin pinned in the lower corner,
.was. flown a.s a signal of distress. The
.skirts' were not strong enougli to stand
the- breeze and had to be taken down to
prevent being torn to pieces.
..Then the men tried making a mainsail
by-sewing their coats- together, but that
rag" only served to keep the boat steady
and-- was not- enough to get any headway
on. her." '. In this, way four hours were
-passed, and as during the whole of that
tfme the. ladies ha.d been baling out the
boat, the Joy they.' felt when the Sappho
came bearing- dowivon them can be lm
agiried. â¢ â¢ â  â¢ .
. Captain L. Haven had seen the signal
of .distress' while he was making for the
â¢Sappho's anchorage at .Sausallto with all
'.Sail eet:- The yacht's course was changed
arid *he bore down on- the shipwrecked
excu.rsloniÂ«ls. The. first line thrown from
the:. Sappho the men on the launch faik-Â«i
to catch, owing to the manner in which
: b'oth bouts were pitching. The yacht had
therefore to- fiH away and make another
tack, in order to try again. This time the
.line was caught and made fast. Then the
Sappho was headed for Oakland Creek,
and in- half an hour the rescued party
was .ashore. ..Captain Haven did not wait
lor thanks', but as soon as he saw them
to. a place of safety put about and made
for 'home.
"The torpedo-boat destroyer Farragut
was out on her official trial trip yester
day ,-andfor a time surpassed all expecta
tions. During. her warming up she sped
up and down the front like a deer, but
â¢ when it came to the actual test she set
tled dowji to work and reeled off the
record-breaking knots with ease. On her
last' trial she made 31 76-100 knots, while
yesterday she made fully 32 knots for
forty-two minutes, and then the air
pumps got out of order and the trial had
to be stopped. It was a great disappoint
ment "to everybody on board, as the build
ers were confident the tout would go off
without a hitch. The vessel was taken
back- to the Union Iron Works and Mill
be made ready for another trial in a few
day.s. . â¢
There was nearly a collision between
the Farragut and ferry-boat Oakland.
â The latter did not figure on the speed of
the former, and. got in her way. In con
sequence the Farragut's course' had to be

chased by Captain Charles Nelson and
will probably be put in the sugar trade.
The bark came from tho East here with
a, party of Klondlkers and made one trip
to- St. Mfchael. She is now on Puget
Sound and will load coal at Departure
Bay for this port. Captain Tyson, former
ly of the steamer Cleveland, has gone
north to take command of the bark.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's mail
steamer Mariposa will sail for Australia
with every ounce of cargo she can carry
and- every passenger she can accommo
date. Turner patent bunks have been
fitted up in the hallways for fifteen cabin
passengers who can secure no other sleep-
Ing accommodation. These bunks can be
fitted up at night in five minutes and
taken down in less time than that in the
morning.
â¢ The ship Republic, from Newcastle,
Australia, for Honolulu with a cargo of
coal, has been compelled to put into Syd
ney,-N. S. W.. leaking.
The Republic sailed from Port Towns
end in November, 1597,.f0r Australia with
a load of lumber, and three weeks later
put into San Francisco in distress. She
had been i-n a heavy storm and was leak-
Ing badly. The captain at first refused to
make for San Francisco, but aa he found
that the vessel made more water the more
sail was put on her, and the rudder head
being damaged, he decided to put in here.

She was thoroughly overhauled here, and
started again for Australia, reaching
Port Pirie in safety. She got into more
trouble down there, and was finally sold
to pay her debts. This is the first voyage
she is making for her new owners.
The sea otter hunting schooners Maksa
toff and Baranoff are expected here soon
from Dutch Harbor. Since the passage
of the law prohibiting sealing and other
hunting from schooners the two vessels
are of no further use in Bering Sea. so
they are coming back to the home port.
Captain Bertelson of the Alaska Commer
cial Company's tug Sadie is bringing one
of the schooners down and the mate of
the Sadie will bring the other. Tha crews
of the schooners were made up from men
picked up at Dutch Harbor and from the
Portland before she sailed.
The whaling bark Gayhead arrived from
the Arctic yesterday with 5400 pounds of
whalebone and 325 barrels of whale oil.
On October 17 she spoke the whaling bark
Winthrop with two whales. The entire
fleet seems to have done well this year,
and there will be rejoicing in Whaletown
therefore when the vessels get in.
The transport Peru arrived from Manila
early yesterday morning with fifteen sol
diers and sailors. She was sent to the
quarantine station, where she was thor
oughly fumigated, and during the after
noon docked at the Mall Company's
wharf. She will go back into the China
trade as soon as she can be overhauled.
John Murray, a sailor on the American
ship Dirigo, fell from aloft five days ago
and broke both his arms. AVhen the ship
arrived the man was taken to the Harbor

THE O'BRIEN A HELL SHIP.
Warrants Issued Charging Her Offi
cers With Having Brutally-
Beaten Members of the
Crew.
The men of the American ship Edwnrtl
O'Brien, which arrived in port yesterday
morning from Baltimore, tell a tale of
suffering, hardship and abuse at the
hands of the first and second officers.
They assert that the O'Brien was what
is commonly termed a "hell ship," and
that the officers did not have as much
consideration for the men as they might
have had for dogs. The belaying pin
was used freely, and one of the men
has a broken nose, while others bear
scars all over their heads and bodies.
From the time the vessel left Baltimore
until she reached this port, the voyage
was one constant round of abuse and the
sailors were kicked and cuffed on the
slightest provocation, and often, the men
say, without provocation at all. Many
hard stories are told of Mate McGinnis,
one being that he attempted to kick a
man off the mizzenmast.
Four of the crew, Richard Johnson,
Herman Haas, Steven Stevenson and
August Gertes, appeared before the
United States District Attorney yester
day, and as a result warrants were sworn
out for the arrest of First Officer McGln
nis and Second Officer Craemer. The men
making the complaints are all clean,
bright looking men, and Maas has an
honorable discharge after ten years' ser
vice in the German navy. These com
plaints are Retting quite common, and
they all come from vessels of American
registry.
RILEY GRANNAN
IS BACK AGAIN
Riley Grannan, king plunger of the
American turf, accompanied by his wife,
arrived here yesterday morning' and regis
tered at the Palace. He passed the after
noon at the Oakland track, but his opera
tions there were very limited. It Is Mr.
Grannan's Intention to remain here dur
ing the racing season.

THE LUMBER TRADE.
The Pacific CoaÂ»t Wood and Iron says of thÂ«
lumber trade: .
"That there has- been during the.-pa*t month
a far better feeling among lumber dealer?' than
has existed for some time Is shown In the
'. .firmness at which prices are held. Clear red
wood has been In- demand . for foreign " ship
ment and three of the Mendocino mills ad
!â¢ vanced prices to SU.and $16. Other mills at once '
. ; followed stilt and these have- been the ruling'
prices for the month. Puget Sound mills have
also advanced and are firm. and stiff, shingles
.: are In good demand and the orders from the
: '.East are constantly Increasing. . The fact Is
: that the trade Is brighter ; than ' it ;. has been,
for years, with every prospect for. a good sea
. son. A meeting of redwood men was held the
. 'last week tn the month and a proposition made 1
to unite the sales of redwood -under one house.
â¢ '-. The plan vas submitted te a committee of
. four, two from Mendocino . County and two
â  from Humboldt. At the present writing the
committee is wrestling with the problem/ It
does not look as thoiigh . any agreement can
.": be reached; and the market will' only be ruled
: by the demand and the supply.
; In the East there is a good demand for; lum
ber and' prices are stiffening."- .

* .Â« â¢ . NEW YORK STOCK MARKET. '
NEW YORK, Nov. 2.â News received by the
Associated* Press detailing the hostile prepara
tions of the British and Russian fleets in Chi
nese waters, goes far to explain the recent un
easiness manifest on the London Exchange
In spite of the apparent subsidence of the
Anglo-French controversy. There was a sharp
fall in consols and a strong market In Liver
pool for wheat, which only yielded on the fail
ure of the American markets to respond fully
because the large receipts at primary points
and the liquidation of large speculative lines
In Chicago. The persistent demands for ex
port, however, worked a rally In the American
grain market before the close. Selling pf se
curities for London account in the New Tork
market was a feature o< the day, and the inter
national stocks especially Denver and' Rio
Grande preferred are the heaviest losers among
the railroad stocks. Aside from this there was
a general tendency to stand t>y m idleness and
watch the fireworks among the Industrial spec
ialties, allowing the market to lapse into the
proverbial pre-election dullness. The profes
sional traders naturally turned to the short
eide in such a market, but bear tactics were
not aggressive. In Sugar, Tobacco and Federal
fiteel, the recent order of events was reversed,
the first named showing strength all day on
mysterious Intimation of coming favorable de
velopments which Induced many bears to cover.
The bond market was only moderately ac
tive, but values were bettor sustained than

The stock markets opened here steady to-day,

sols, however, was mainly connected with the

the eontangoes rose 4 per cent. The markets
generally closed at the lowest. Americans weer

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Nov. 2.â WHEATâ Rumored com- ,
plications between Great Britain and Russia
gave wheat a firm start. The opening advance
was added to by heavy foreign acceptances.
New York early in the session reporting fifty
boatloads accepted on last night's cable offer
ings to the other side and a Chicago house also
had fifteen boatloads accepted direct. English
consols were % per cent lower to start with
and ' the - Northwest receipts were j somewhat
lighter than the recent average. The seaboard
clearances were not ' extraordinarily heavy,
however, while the aggregate of Western 'â¢ pri
mary market receipts were enormous, amount-
Ing 'to 1.585,000 bushels, .against 1,123,000 bush
els the corresponding day ofUast year. In ad
dition 'to this ' the early dropV in : British . con
sols was fully recovered about the middle of the
session. That was too much for the bull en
thusiasm, and the market dropped back to th?
opening price' before It took another â¢ upward
flight.- â  ; : -.-â _ : â â¢' â¢â¢â¢â â  â --;.! â 
Hilda Pest was reported 3% higher.'- *'â 'â  â¢
CORNâ Lower : cables and the expectation of
increased receipts on account of : the improved '
weather weakened corn at the start. A great
deal of long corn was sold and for a time the
course of the market was downward; In the
last hour the tendency changed with wheat and
In the. end became strongly upward on, heavy
buying by shorts.
â The market relied upon corn for the
strength. The sellers of yesterday changed
their views and bought back what they had dis
posed of. . ' - . â  .-â¢Â»
PROVISIONSâ The unexpectedly heavy de
crease in . the stocks of. lard caused a better
feeling In provisions. The reduction in stocks
was 65,000 tierces, and It 'was said the world's
stocks ha<l been reduced by 100,000 tierces.- The
English houses opposed the â  advance in I prices

CALIFORNIA RAISINS IN THE EAST.
NEW YORK, Nov. 2.â The Journal of Com
merce under this date says: On spot loose
raisins are scarce, and though there seems to
be comparatively little demand the market lÂ«
firm. Recent arrival?, however, appear to have
been ample in rather quiet condition of con
suming trade to cover immediate needs <>.
consumption, but full deliveries, we under
stand have ton impossible because of tardi
ness of shipping lines, and some of the re
ceivers here are said to b-> far behind in their
deliveries on this account.
California London layers and clusters are
scarce and under increasing demands the
market is firm. Foreign raisins are firm under
small offering and fair consuming demand.
There Â«s a firm feeling in the market for
larger sizes of California prunes, but quota
tions on smaller fruit seem to favor buyer.
For either old or new 40s alone holders are
indifferent, sellers and prices are higher. Old
40a urf closely cleaned up, and small sales
have been made up to 9'ic. New 4/Js are said
to be very difficult to obtain, except in con-
Junction with 50-60s and 60-7 Os, when if equal
quantities of each in 25-lb boxes are taken, 8e
will be accepted. . ....._
Nominal quotation for new 40s alone Is 9ViW
10', 2 c in 2.">-lb boxes, according to holder. Apri
cots are firm, but we hear of few sales either
for home or export account.

Harrison's circular says: "Since the Ala
meda left there have been the following arri
vals of coal from Newcastle, , N. S. W., viz:
Caithness-shire, 2652 tons; Port Patrick, 2631
tons; Holliswood. 1423 tons; Springbank. 1800
tons; Allerton, 3021 tons; total, 11,357 tons. As
all of the above cargoes were sold prior to ar
rival they were all delivered direct to the con
sumers. The present list of chartered vessels
to load coal at Sydney and Newcastle for here
number thirty-one, with a carrying capacity
of about 81,000 tons, thus showing that the
above arrivals here from Australia for Octo
ber are about similar to the engagements there.
Australian freight rates -'still rule high; 19
shillings is v the quoted rate for early .'loading.
This brings the cost landed here so high, that
large consumers are unwilling buyers. It is
not yet definitely settled what the established
coal schedule will be for 1899 at Newcastle; an
advance is pretty well assured if the antici
pated increase is equal to 30 cents per. ton; It
will lead some of our consumers to utilize other
grades of fuel. High priced coal and high
rates of freight will divert considerable busi
ness heretofore controlled by Australia , toward
our Northern coal producers. \
"We are promised several new lines of
steamers for Manila, China, Honolulu, Antwerp
and Tahiti. These combined will consume a
large amount of coal in addition to our pres
ent consumption. Steam grades are meeting
with profitable sale this.- year, and our local
mines on the coast are making a good financial
.showing, as their output is fully 90 per cent
of the amount sold." >

products of the monarchy, will soon leave
Trieste for the chief ports of the Levant,
the Red Sea, Hindastan, the East Indies,
China and Japan. Its arrival will be ex
tensively advertised beforehand at Â«ach
port, and commercial travelers on board
will try to secure orders for the exhibi
tors and to find capable agents at tho
points touched.
The demand for sardines has run ..so
far short of the supply that the French
factories are closing their doors Â£nd the
Government has been asked to come to
the relief of this important national.in
dustry by making- a ration of five or ten
sardines daily part of the regular fare of
the French soldier.

The tactics employed to throw the con
trol of the next Board of Supervisors to
_ the Democrats have been so cowardly
and contemptible that the friends of the
Republican nominees " have decided to
show their true inwardness.
Supervisor Talcott has been bo grossly
maligned and misrepresented that people
have been led to ask "Whom would the
fuslonlsts give us in place of honest John
Â° Talcott?" Every intelligent person in
Alameda County knows Judge Ellsworth
spoke truthfully a few night ago at a'
Republican meeting when he said Mr.
Talcott was as honest an official as any
body of * citizens could desire. Yet, day
after day, the Democratic mud slingers
are putting forth garbled statements,
â which have been disproved time and time j
Â° again. The opposition is continually j
howling for "good business men" in the
place of Church and Talcott, knowing full
â well that the Republican administration
of the county has been the most business-,
like It has ever known. .
In making choice for a man whom the
Democrats would. have succeed Mr. Tal- I
cott, the men anxious to control the Su
pervisorial patronage forgot evidently
f that they were looking for a model "busi-.
..ess man." They nominated Charles W.
Heyer, a brewer' of Haywards, whose
peculiar methods have more than once
brought htm into controversy with Uncle
Sam. The curious have undertaken to
inquire Into the "business methods" of
= the man who is opposed to Mr. Talcott, â 
and they have made some interesting dis
coveries.
A few years ago Mr. Heyer was a part
ner in a brewery at Haywards, and on
onÂ© occasion Uncle Sam seized the brew
ery and all that it contained because of i
certain irregular business methods alleged |
to be practiced by those in charge of the j
concern. Michael B. Clark was at that 1
time an employe of the brewery. He was
a witness for the United States Govern
ment, and under oath made the following
deposition, which 1!':1 !': known as "Uncle
Sams Exhibit No. 2":

Alameda, State of California, deposes and says
that he commenced working for L PÂ«ilmtag.

about two years in all,

Charles Heyer did the tapping; It was my
duty to take the kegs down from the wagon :
â¢ It was the custom to stamp the beer in the '
morning before going out with the wagon, :
and the stamping was usually done In my pres
ence by Charles Heyer, and I helped load the
kegs on to the wagon. ' / .
It was his custom to 'put good stamps on '
about seven of. the kees. which were loaded on
the wagon under the seat, then he would use
old stamps (stamps that.had been used on other
kegs) on the remainder of the load. As Boon
as he would stamp a k<?" * 'th an old stamp he
would immediately turn the keg over so no
one could notice It, -id hen loading them on
the wagon we always loaded them with the
ijjstamps down. . When we desired to unload any
Â« tamps down. When off the. hind unload any
re always took them oit the. hind end of thÂ»
ragon as those were the old stamps, and the
ones In front were kept to the last In ea-e we
had any to return to the brewery with , When
we returned to the brewery It was the custom
for me. to unload the' wagon taking any full
kees back in the brewery -and unloading the
empty ketrs and leaving them next to the wash
house. Under Instructions from Charles Hever
they were always stood on end with the
stamped end up. and the hoi* the stamp was on
out so It could be. got at. Then Charles Heyer
.would take a bucket of water and moisten the
old stamps, (rÂ«nprn.l!y uslne hot water to make
them come off easier: then he would take off
the old stamps lay them out on a board and
put them back of the dry kiln to dry them and 'â 
have them ready for use.
During the time I was working at the brew- '
cry It was the custom to brew during the ;
summer months four or five times a week oc
casionally six times, brewing often on Sun
days. . t
I know that the use of the old stamps was !
â¢known by L. Palmtag, as he often assisted In
putting them on. Charles Keyer is a. stepson
of L. Palmtag and is bow a partner in the
business. Our trips with the beer wagon were-

A THIMBLE
LOCATED IN
HIS SHOULDER.
Swallowed It Over
Forty Years Ago.
LUCILLUS MILLER'S BELIEF
IT MAY BE A FAMOUS SURGICAL
CASE.
Went to Cooper Medical College Once
to Have It Removed, but
Changed TTiÂ«
Mind.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 2.
Lucillus Miller, who for a long time re
! sided in this city, believes he is carrying:
in his left shoulder a silver thimble that
;he swallowed forty years ago. He wiir
soon submit to an operation to have the
supposed thimble removed.'
Forty years ago Miller was a very* little
fellow. He was playing around his
mother's feet while she was doing some
sewing. A knock was heard at the door.
Mrs. Miller answered it, and when she
returned her silver thimble could not be i
found. The little boy said he had swal
lowed it. but his story was hardly credit
ed, although nothing more was ever seen
of the thimble.
A generation passed away, and Miller
began to be troubled with a slight- swell- ;
ing at the bajk of the left shoulder. Little
by little the â  welling grew and hardened,
and it was supposed that a cancer was [
growing. H* was examined by some doc- <
tors, and it was suggested that the trouble
might be caused by the long-lost silver
thimble. During the past three months
It has been possible to move the source
of the trouble between the fingers and
to be assured that it is a thoroughly hard
substance. Mr. Miller and his sister, Miss
Lavonia Miller, are now staying on Treat
avenue. San Francisco, and they are both
convinced that the silver thimble has
worked up into his shoulder.
"There can be no doubt," said Miss
Miller, "that the little fhlmble so long
lost has been found, although we cannot
understand how It could get into his
shoulder. The thimble was a very sma.i
one, and we believe that my brother's !
trouble is caused by it."
Not long ago Mr. Miller decided to have j
the thimbleâ or whatever It Isâ removed.
He decided to go to the Cooper Medical
College and have it cut out. He went to j
the college, and as soon as he entered ..e i
heard the groans of a man op the operat- '
ing table. Miller at once concluded that
It was more comfortable to carry the
thimble around in his shoulder than to
submit to the knives of the surgeons on
the operating table. He walked quickly
to his wheel, flew away from the hospital,
and now his relatives are persuading him
to make another attempt.
Some doctors to whom the Incident has !
been told declare that if the thimble snail ;
be found in Miller's shoulder It will be one ;
of the most remarkable things ever chron- :
icled in surgery. '
WILL PUNISH HIM
FOR HIS DISLOYALTY
ALAMEDA REPUBLICANS IN
CENSED AT A CANDIDATE.
Pooled Issues With a Sorehead to
Defeat a Regular
Nominee.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 2.â Politics took a de
cided turn in Alameda to-day. Feeling â 
confident that the Republican county
nominees, with a possible single excep- |
tion, were reasonably sure of good ma
jorities here, the pafty' workers turned
their attention to the township candi
dates. The fight for Justice of the Peace !
and Constables is waxing warm, and â¢
considerable vim is being put into the
contest. ' Henry Morris is the regular Re
publican nominee for Justice. He has
held the office for many successive terms.
His opponent is D. T. Hard, who sought j
the nomination at the San Leandro con- j
vention, and after being defeated came j
out as an Independent candidate. He
would have attracted littie attention in
the 'campaign were it not for the fact that
George E. Clark, a regular Republican
nominee for Constable, had pooled issues
With him. The pair are making a bitter j
fight against Morris, but are gaining few
supporters. The leaders in the party or
ganization do not take kindly to Clark's
action or his combine against the regular
i nominee. and the word has been passed
along the line to punish him for hie dis- ;
i loyalty. The Democrats put up no one |
against Morris, as he was a favorite with i
: members of both parties. They nominated
. but one Constable. George Smith, when
two are to be elected. George Gray and
t Clark are the Republican candidates, j
! Gray has smooth Bailing, but the Repub
. Means are displeased with Clark's actions |
â â  against Morris and are throwing their I
j strength to Smith.
J. R. Talcott, Republican, and Charles
: Heyer, Democrat, candidates for Super- j
' visor from the* Second District, are wind- ;
ing up their canvass In Alameda, both ap
predating that the vote of this city will
I tell the tale on election day. The fight ia
1 a lively one.
Talcott is supported by his party with
remarkable unanimity, and has the ad
vantage of fighting in a district of Ala
meda which has a normal Republican ma
jority of between 400 and 500.
The Glascock-Church Supervisorial
contest, which involves the West End of
the city, is somewhat mixed. The ad
vent of an independent candidate, George
Lovegrove, witn some Republican sup
porters, is apt to take some votes from
Church. The party war horses are out
for Church, but there is some disaffection
among the erstwhile silent voters that
may cut a figure on election day. How
ever, from careful observations, the con
test so far aa Alameda is concerned is
anybody's fight.
The Democrats will hold their final pow
wow Friday night at Armory Hall. Gov
ernor Budd and Walter Stradley will ad
dress the meeting.

SHORT DAYS
Birdie Jacobson De
sires a Divorce.
ALLEGES WILLFUL DESERTION
HUSBAND LEFT SUDDENLY FOR
HIS SWEDISH HOME.
He Had a Valise Containing Over
$1000 in Gold, but Said He
Could Not Support a
Wife.
Oakland Office San Francisco Cart,
908 Broadway, Nov. 2.
Miss Birdie Jacobson, a bride of three
days, is suing for a divorce from Karl
â Jacobson on th.c ground of willful deser
tion, and testimony 1b now being taken
in the case before Court Commis
sioner Babcock, so that a decision may
be expected within the next few days.
According to the complaint, Karl Jacob
son and the plaintiffâ at that time Birdie
j Siegerâ were married at Virginia City,
; Nev., on February 10, 1895. The young
bride was a popular belle of the city ani
of most respectable parentage. The groom
held a responsible position with the Vir
ginia City Water Works for two years,
and had, through frugal habits and eco
nomic living, saved a snug sum, and with
the" prospects of steady employment for
the husband the young couple started out
on their marital life filled with only the
best of hopes.
But the honeymoon proved a short one,
and Karl's love for gold greatly exceeded
the love he held for his wife, for after
three days of marital bUss, and while the
couple were stopping at the Ahlborn
House, San Francisco, the husband, with
out a blush, informed his wife that he
feared ho had undertaken a greater bar
gain than he could execute on his part
and that he was financially unable to sup
port her, although at the time he had in
hia possession over JlOOo in gold coin, tie
rudely advised her to brave the wond
single-handed, and as a means for driving
the wolf from the door he suggested tnat
she lead an Immoral life.
Thereupon he picked up his grip and
departed, telling the heartbroken bride
that he was oft' for his old home in
Sweden. He has never been seen or heard
from since, either here or at Virginia
City.
Mrs. Jacobson subsequently came to this
city, and has made her home with rela
tives here. She has waited for her hus
band's return for over three years, and
finally decided to sue for a divorce.
Judge Hall to-day granted a decree of
divorce to Mary A. Johnson from Henry
Johnson on the ground of willful deser
tion. On the same ground Judge Ogden
to-day granted a divorce to Mamie Souf
frain from James Souffrain.

ARTISTS LISTED WITH RAPT
ATTENTION TO A MASTER MIND
THERE is much more danger of not making a good picture originally
than of having its colors turn or fade out after being painted." These
were the closing words of Alexander Harrison, the painter, yesterday, in
a charming art to art talk with the members of the Sketch Club. The reply
was brought out by a question as to colors fading.
The reception vai held in the rooms of the club on Sutter street, and
was delightfully Informal. He outlined briefly the history of art from
ancient times to the present day. when Paris is the consensus of art
Art, he said, in

ities that make an
artist are required
equally in all these.
Ancient art, he
held, was more
local In charac
ter, representing
characteristics of
the people and of
the land. The life
of modern people
is so cosmopolitan
that all schools are
blended.
"Paris," he said,
"represents a con
sensuÃ of the art of
the entire world,
omitting England.
There the spirit of
reserve and of iso
lation extends to
art and artists.
The very atmos
phere is good for

The speaker would not name the greatest painter, on the ground that
different schools were represented and a comparison could not bo made fairly.
The schools In order of merit were: French, American, English, Scotch,
Swedish and Norwegian, and finally German. The Dutch school was pro
nounced "one of gentle mediocrity, charming, genial and semi-weak."
Of American art Mr. Harrison has a splendid opinion. It shows breadth
and c constant leaning toward originality, he says. Periodically a great
painter develops and does not follow the leadership of a French master,
but strikes out a course for himself. America would make a superb exhi
bition in 1900 if the best pictures of the year could be collected and suffi
cient space were allowed at the Exposition in which to display them.
He said symbolism was the latest affectation of the artists. In this lota
of color is used, so it is impossible to tell what the artist means. The ef
fect is bo striking one ought to feel it before catching sight of It.
In a catchy way Mr. Harrison mentioned the noted American and French
artlÃts with whom he has associated for twenty years. At the conolusion
of his remarks he held a levee, the artists, both amateur and professional,
crowding around him.

SPOKE AMONG FRIENDS.
Republican Candidates Address One
of Hayes Valley's Banner
Clubs.
The Thirty-eighth Assembly District
Republican Club held a reception, over
which Gus Pohlman presided, last even
ing at 1209 Flllmore street. He was as
sisted by Secretary W. E. Commary.
Long before 8 o'clock Republicans of the
district began to pour In and when the
Xt speakers arrived the hall was filled
the doors and many listened to the
resses from the sidewalk. The speak
ers were received with cheers and the
welcome accorded them made them feel
at home. As a result several very inter
esting addresses were made. The first to
take the floor was John B. Carson, can
didate for the position of Superior Judge.
He had but little to say of his own can
didacy, confining his remarks to na
tional issues, and commending the ad
ministration of President McKinley. He
was frequently Interrupted by the cheer
ing of his audience. Mr. Carson haÃ
made many friends in the district.
D. J. Murphy, candkiate for District
Attorney, is no stranger In Hayes Val
ley, and his welcome was all that he
could desire. He confined his remarks
to explaining his acts in connection with
the defunct Wallace grand jury, as a re
ply to the attacks made upon him by a
certain clay-bank colored morning pa
per. One of the most interesting speak
ers was Thomas F. Dunn, who aaplrea to
the position of Justice of the Peace.
While he spoke of the import
ant issues of the day, his re
marks were decidedly witty and full
of dry humor ana the audience was kept
laughing more than half the time. The I
reception accorded to Martin Fragley, for
Superintendent 01 Streets, showed that he
is not only well known, but well liked in
that part of the city. In his blunt,
straightforward manner he told the peo
ple what they may expect of him if he is
favored by the voters of San Fran
cisco.
Coroner "W. J. Hawkins, who hopes
and has very good reasons to believe that
he will be continued In office, announced
his desires, and pointing to his past record,
in this important position, said that he j
hoped that the people of this city are
satisfied with what he has done to the
extent of having him remain. To W. A.
Deane, called by the boys of the valley
"Billy," was given a rousing reception,
which was all the assurance that ha
wanted that he could rely upon his
friends there when the time comes to vote
to see who is to be County Clerk. Among
the other speakers were: E. L. Head, for
School Director; Henry S. Martin, for
Sheriff; H. N. Clement, for Superior
Judge; George S. Collins, for Supervisor
of the Eighth Ward; Joseph E. Barry, for
Justice of the Peace; A. B. Treadwell, for
Police Judge; A. C. Berthler, for Re
corder, and William Roberts and T. H.
Thompson, who are not out for anything
but the good of the Republican party.
SLAVONIAN CITIZENS.

CHARMED BY HIS SINGING.
A Laborer From Redwood City De
â¢ ceived by a Saloon Acquaint
ance.
Francis O'Neil. a laborer, was arrested
yesterday afternoon and booked at the
City Prison on a charge of grand lar
ceny. The complaining witness is H. A.
Smith, a laborer from Redwood City.
Smith's statement to the police was that
hp came to the city Monday evening and
engaged a room at the Denver House on
Third street, near Howard. He dropped
into the Widow O'Brien's saloon under
the Denver House and met O'Neil, who
caught his fancy, as he could sing. They
had a number of drinks together and
kept the fun up until yesterday morn
ing. O'Neil accompanied Smith to his
room and Smith dozed off. When he awak
ened in about twenty minutes O'Neil had
disappeared and 5123 that Smith had in
his pockets had also disappeared. Smith
notified the police and O'Neil was ar
rested.
When searched- at the City Prison about
$35 was found in O'Nell's pockets, but he
claimed that he had received the money
from the Spring Valley Water Works
Company, for whom he worked. He de
nied stealing the money from Smith.

A FREAK IN PSYCHOLOGY.
Professor Marsters Concludes That the Mind Is
Scattered Over the Universe.
PROFESSOR E. J. MARSTERS
landed here from Stockton Mon
day. He tacked up his shingle
Immediately. On the shingle it
said that he was a mental physi
cian and a delineator of character
and events. At the present time
his address is San Francisco, but
he expects to. change it to Stan
ford University in a short time. He
came for the purpose of explaining
to the world a new-found theory,
that the mind is a free element, juat
as air, water, heat, light or any old
thing, and that it does not exist in
the brains of men, but can be
grasped from out the atmosphere
and spoken with the lips. The pro
fessor has prepared for the press
a treatise headed by the flaring
lines, "The greatest discovery of
the age," and will commence the
education of the /youth on Slater's
old cry, "to know the past, the
present and the future." Of course,
when the faculty of Stanford or Yale
desires to gather him in its fold,
he will relinquish his grip here and
seek wider pastures.
According to his theories, when a
man, who is sick and weary, feels
PROGRESSION
IN THE WORLD
OF REALTY
Market Characterized
by Dullness.
BUT FEW LARGE SALES MADE
ANOTHER PREDICTION MADE
FOR THE FUTURE.
A General Review of the Records,
New Building Contracts, Re
cent Sales and Random
Notes.
The real estate market during the past
week was characterized with little or no
actual progression. In every department
there seemed to be a deplorable dearth of
something to do. There were a number
of sales negotiated but these were of
email valuation and, considered as a
whole, of little importance.
An Improvement, however, is expected
immediacy after election. Many of the
principal brokers of the city predict an
unusual and encouraging number of sales
and transfers will be made in the latter
part of next or the commencement of
the following week.
Such predictions, however, have long
since failed to carry any weight or con
fidence to the general public. They have
been made so often, and have circulated
bo frequently during an entire year or
more that there is little or no confidence
placed in them as the market never seems
to undergo the foretold charge for the
better It seems that every hope is for
the future, which never seems to come.
Property value the entire city over is at
a standstill and from long continued
stagnation the market threatens to de
preciate instead of increase in value.
The brokers of the city in their reports
of the progress of the market generally
fluctuate in their opinions from evident
and undoubted success one week to ab
solute ruin the next.
The building operations for the past
week and, in fact, for several weeks past,
have been less in value and extent than
those recorded during the same period in
the dullest summer month.
Mortgages and trust deeds for the past
seven days have been characteristically
In the minority, there being few, if any,
exceeding an aggregate value of $12,000.
There was not one release or reconvey
ance recorded that amounted to more
than an indifferent value.
REVIEW OF THE RECORDS.
During the week there were seventy mort
gages and trust deeds recorded amounting to
1182,750. For the same period forty-seven re
leases and reconveyances passed to record In
the total sum of $92,700.
The principal mortgages and trust deeds are
as follows:

that he can bear this mortal coil for
a few years more, he corners a lit
tle of this mind that is floating
around and Is Inspired with the
balmy thought which guides his
hand in writing a prescription for
an unfailing panacea. Just so when
he sits down to a little game of
poker and finds his red chips being
substituted by white, the mind
creeps out of unseen depths and tips
the other man's hand off. Science Is
required to accomplish these remin
iscences of the black art, but the
professor claims the requisite ma
terial and expects to diffuse it
throughout the leading seats of
learning. He simply asks a ques
tion and in a few seconds the mind,
laden down with the goldert answer,
comes bumping into his head, and
this mind, when properly bridled, is
infallible. Should he secure many
disciples, the world will become an
apt field for Croesi, and the long
evity of man will begin to resemble
that of the sturdy oak.

Many a life haÂ» been sacrificed by mm-h
needless Fuffering tnfltcC'il by those who rely
upon the knife as the chief remedy for affec-
tions of the female sexual organs, when a
more rational treatment could have been suc-
cessfully pursued by using Vltallsm-Cardlne
for weak heart. Cerebrine for brain fag, etc.,
Ovarlne for amenorrhea, hysteria, sterility:
Uterine for nervous exhaustion, etc. : great

weakened organs; drugs only irritate. The

Editor Callâ Dear Sir: The San Pran

of yesterday moraine- by three columns
: of personal vituperation. I am not in
this controversy for' personal reasons,
and therefore I deem ;*; * beneath me to
waste my time on the Boughten Bulle
tin. I have made certain assertions be
fore the people of this city. If these as
sertions are false let those who ODDOse
me prove their falsity. If these assertions
are true Mr: Phelan stands convicted
of supporting men who. have declared
: that Catholics are not entitled to eaual
rights with their fellow citizens. No
amount of personal, abuse can alter the
truth or falsity of my assertions. I am
appealing to the people, and the people
are B'wayed not by. words but by arsru
.ments.. not by billingsgate but by tes
tlmonyy n.ot by evil-speaking but by
fa^ts./ :-â¢â â . .. â¢ â¢'â  'â  'â .".â 
The people of this city. are quick to
discern the true state. of affairs in a
controversy like the . present. They
know H is. 'a ijuestion of principle not a
question Qf personality. .Therefore all
the personal . attacks, all the lying
charges, all. the, cowardly innuendoes,
all the whispered, suggestions: of the
Bulletin go for -naught. It is not the
first time in San Francisco that my per
sonal character, has. been aspersed, my
standing with my. fellow Catholics as
sailed, â¢. my . motives questioned, my
name reviled. They who- have done so
already have gone down inglorious into
the filth which they so lavishly threw,
and those who now. do so shall as surely
descend..lnto the mud from which they
have sprung;. : .;...;. : ; .-.â¢â â . -. : --, ; . : â¢
I dislike, slr. Editor, to bring my per
. sonal affairs into .this, controversy, tout
the tactics of the Bougliten . Bulletin
leave no other, course. This, the pur
chased organ of Mr; James p. Phelan,
has ch6seh.tO:atJat;k.ni;y..moral'charac
ter and to present me to the public as a
priest unworthy of . his dalling, insub
ordinate to his superiors and deprived
ol his official standing;; I. have' nothing
in this. wide, world but my good name.
I have nothing among my own people
but the reputation of ' doing, my duty
toward .God and toward them. . I have
no money, for I have. not sold.- myself
to a millionaire; I have, no power, for
I have not bartered' my soul for polili
ral prefermentâ l have- nothing but the
"- Iwtly character aid the report, of. an
upright life.. "Therefore I may be par
doned if my personal affairs take up
some of your space this morning. I
owe something to my friends, and the
least that is due to myself is that hire
lings of James D. Phelan shall not .cal
umniate me with impunity. â¢
. The Bulletin declares this evening in
its cowardly fashion that I. am an in
subordinate priest, disobedient to the
commands or expressed wishes of my
, superiors, that I have lost my position
as. editor of the Monitor and that I have
broken with my ' companions- of .the
clergy and my friends of the laity. If
' the Bulletin had the courage that we
usually associate with â  manliness it
would be easy to meef.lt. If the Bul
letin will dare say that in position, in
character, . in office, in- employment, in
grade, in anything in the sight of the
. Catholic church I stand to-day in worse
position than.l- s-to.od a; year ago or two
years ago the : law of : the land, would
give me redress, to : obtain which I
would sell the shirt, off my back and
the shoes offi.my feet.'. Will the. Bulle
tin dare say I am not a. priest in good
standing In the Cath.olic Church?- Will
the Bulletin "dare say. I am not editor
of the Monitor?' Will the Bulletin. dare
say I am not chancellor of the arch
diocese of San Francisco? Will the Bul
letin dare assert that I have disobeyed
even in the slightest : particular' the
expressed wishes or commands of those
who are set over me? Let the' editor of
the Bulletin for. once In the long ca
reer that he has spent in crawling on
his belly on the ground stand erect like
a man, and' then I shall know how to
d"al with him arid tq protect my good
.name by the resources of the law. â¢

HANDS
v CURED BY
About eight years ago I got core hands. It
commenced with a burning sensation on my
fingers. When I rubbed them you could see
little white pimples on the 'skin, and I felt
like twisting my fingers out of .their sockets-.
I had high fever and cold chills, and nights
I had to walk the floor until I fell asleep. I
got the Cctiocha Resolvent and Ccticcba
Soap. The nails hardened up and peeled off,
and I don't believe there is. one of the first
nails left on my hands which are now cured.

Two dollars' worth of CcrcoritA Remedies
cured me of Salt Itheum of twenty years' stand-
inn. My hands and fingers broke out in red,
watery blisters with terrible itching, then a
scab would form, which would peel off and
â  come in great cracks, the blood running out.
, My nails grew out wrinkled like a cow's horns,
but now they are growing nice and smooth.

â  I was obliged to keep the first three fingers
. of my little boy's hand done up all thÂ« time,
as it was a raw sore, beginning to extend
down toward the palm. We consulted three

time. A gentleman recommended Ccticuka ,

Boughten Bulletin has dragged the
name of Archbishop Rlordan Into this
controversy. It publishes a telegram
in which His Grace says "Father
Yorke is alone responsible for his utter
ances." What else would the Boughten
Bulletin have the Archbishop say?
What other reply could I have made
were the inquiry directed to myself?
Of course, Father Yorke and Father
Yorke alone is responsible for his utter
ances. Behind the argument of the
Boughten Bulletin lies the A. P. A. con
tention that the members of the Cath
olic church are dumb, driven cattle,
whose ideas are expressed only in the
crack of the driver"s whip. The Catholic
church has her own methods and her,
own organs of expressing her opinions.
She does not speak to her children in
the orations at church fairs or in the
columns of a shameless and a subsi
dized press. Her head speaks through
his encyclicals, his briefs, hia bulls;
her officers deal with their people
through the decrees of councils and
the pastorals of her Bishops. The idea
that at the mere utterance of every
clergyman, be he priest or Bishop, the
Catholic people are bound to bow down
to the ground, is entertained only by
the bigots and the Ignoramuses who
inflict the Bulletin on a long-suffering
public.
Let me again and again protest in
the name of the Catholic people against
this shameless insinuation that the
Catholics are the slaves of their priests
or their Bishops. No matter what may
be the position of the priest or prelate
that talks to them. Catholics are as
free in their political opinions as any
other men on American soil. There are
Catholicsâ and good Catholicsâ in this
town who speak harshly of me because
of my late action. lam glad of it. I
can endure the discomfort of their
personal animosity because they clear
the name of the church, whose honor
is the ch'iefest concern of my life, and
because they stop the lying mouths of
Crothers and his bigoted fellows who
believe that Catholics are the members
of a political machine driven by blind
fanaticism and controlled by a des
potic power.
I and I alone am responsible for the
opinions expressed in my Oakland
speech and in my subsequent letters.
I and I alone am responsible for every
word I have spoken from every plat
form, for every word I have written
over my own name, for every editorial
utterance in the Monitor of the past
five years. When in 1896 the crowd of
bigots that snarled about me charged
me with being the mere mouthpiece of
a coterie of learned Jesuits, I replied
that the letters signed by Peter C.
Yorke were prepared by Peter C. Yorke
alone, were written by Peter C. Yorke
alone, and that for them Peter C. Yorke
alone was responsible. What I said
then I repeat now. I have not stood
over the people with the bludgeon of
mere authority. I have not appealed
to their passions or their baser
thoughts. I have appealed to their
reason, and in appealing to their rea
son I have recognized no difference of
race or sect. Before Catholic and Prot
estant, before Jew and Gentile I have
stated my case. That case stood on its
own merits, not on the authority of the
Catholic church, not on the name of
Peter C. Yorke. When to-day I stand
before the people I am content to take
the same ground. Hear me for my
cause, and judge me by the facts.
And now James D> Phelan, come out
from behind that rag. That Boughten
hiding- there long enough, hissing with
your forked tongue and befouling my
name with your tainted breath. Who
gave you or your Boughten Bulletin the
right to speak of my priestly charac
ter? Who gave you and your hireling!
gang authority over my position in the
church? If this discussion is to descend
to personalities, James D. Phelan, dis
tasteful though it may be to me, I am
not afraid of you or of any man when
duty is to be done. I trust it shall not
be so. I trust that this discussion has
seen the end of personal attacks. I
have no desire .to complicate the issues
in the minds of the people by extrane
ous matters. James D. Phelan, I have
accused you specifically and by name
of indorsing injustice. I have accused
you of treachery to those who thought
themselves your friends. I have ac
cused you of lying to the people from
whom you seek support. Stand out
from behind that rag. That boughten
Bulletin is no longer a cover to your
shame: Meet my arguments, meet my
facja. The people of this city are not
swayed by hireling abuse, by personal
vilification. They are reasonable men,
and reason shall be their guide.
PETER C. YORKE.
FITTING GIFT FOR
THE BOYS IN BLUE
A CALIFORNIA FLAG FOR CALI
FORNIA SOLDIERS.
Delicate Compliment of the Silk Cult
ure Society to the First Volun
teer Infantry at
Manila.
It is a beautiful and essentially Call
fornlan Christmas gift that the boys of
the First California will receive from the
ladies of the California Silk Culture So
ciety, just as soon as General Miller walks
down the gangplank from the transport
Newport to the dock at Old Manila.
It is a shimmering banner of the na
tional colors that the general is to deliver
to the heroes of the First, as a gift from
the ladies of this State, and it will be j
doubly dear to them with the knowledge
that It Is wholly a product of the home ',
sod. The rich, heavy silk was spun out ;
by thousands of little native born silk- i
worms that the ladies of the society have
been experimenting with the handsome â¢
staff was cut in California's forests, and
the golden eagle, the bullion fringe and
shining cords and tassels were dug in
their original state from the hills of the
high Sierras.
A committee of the ladies, composed of \
the officers of the society, Mrs. Theodore ;
Hlttell, Mrs. J. Kirk and Mrs. D. J. Mur- \
phy, has been busily at work over the .
flag for a month past. The silk which j
was in Its raw state had to be dyed, the
stars to be worked in, and there were a
hundred and one details to be attended
to in transforming the unrefined product
of the Industrious silkworms into the
beautiful emblen designed to go down to
Manila as a token of the love and appre- i
elation that- Is held for the heroes away |
from home. No expense has been spared,
therÂ© has been no Btlnt of hard work, and
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1898.
the ladies of the society are justly proud
of the handsome product of their ener
gies.
Saturday the flag will be on exhibition
in the window of the White House.
It was the idea of the officers of the
society. The society supplied the funds
and the silk, and it is presented in the
name of the women of the State, hun
dreds of whom are working so hard to
make silk one of California's own pro
ducts.
MORGAN CITY ARRIVES.
The St. Paul Also Slipped In Early
This Morning.
The steamship Morgan City anchored in
the stream last night about 9 o'clock. She
left Manila on September 20 and at that
place took aboard her only passenger,
Private Louis Patton of the Fourteenth
Regiment of Infantry. Patton was dis
charged, his time having expired in army
service.
After leaving Manila the Morgan City
enjoyed a beautiful voyage to Hongkong,
where she touched three days later. The
passage was also good to Nagasaki and
she steamed out of that port on October
4. Twelve days later a severe gale brok*
upon the ship which compelled her to
heave to twenty-six hours, but she rode
the gale like a cork and lost nothing from
her decks. When 2500 milee from San
Francisco the crown sheet In one of her
boilers collapsed, and she was obliged to
continue her trip with one-half steam
power, reducing her speed from 10 to 8.68
knots.
Early this morning the transport St.
Paul passed in and anchored off the barge
office near the Morgan City. She also
came direct from Manila.
DEATH MET HIM
ON THE STREET
THE SUDDEN DEMISE OF C. H.
SUMMERS.
He Was General Circuit Manager of
the Western Union and One of
Its Highest Officials.
That solemn admonition in the good
book which warns mankind that "in the
miust of life we are In death" applies
most strikingly to the case of C. H. Sum
mers, general circuit manager of the
Western Union Telegraph Company, who
died of heart disease very suddenly last
night.
Mr. Summers was the representative of
the vice-president of the great telegraph
corporation, and aside from his other
duties was general manager of all the
Western Union lines west of Pittsburg.
He was a hard worker, and came to San
Francisco on a trip combining business
with a search for health. During tha
afternoon he visited several of his friends
and talked of his plans for taking recre
ation trips to the points of special inter
est in the State.
The demands of business occupied his
time till about 10 o'clock p. m. and he then
went for a walk with a friend. While
strolling along O'Farrell street he was
taken suddenly ill and asked to be con
ducted to a place where he could Imme
diately receive the assistance of a physi
cian.
The dying man was conveyed to 220 A
O'Farrell street, and tenderly placed in
a bed. At the same time a physician was
summoned, but the sufferer was long
past medical aid when the doctor arrived.
In fact he had his death stroke before he
reached his couch.
It was a sad and sudden ending of the i
career of a man who was one of the most !
widely known in active business life In
the country.
His career as a telegrapher began with {
the opening of the Civil War, when he |
had charge of a military division of i
telegraphers. This arduous labor was j
continued until the close of the great con- i
test, when he entered the service of tne |
Western Union Company in a minor posi
tion. His abilities won rapid advance
ment, until he ranked with the highest
executive official in the company.
Deceased left a widow and several
grown children, who are prominent in the
society and business circles of Chicago,
where he had his headquarters.
The news of the sudden demise of Mr.

DOLPHINS HAVE a GOOD TIME.
Their Anniversary Entertainment
and Reception a Great Success.
The twentieth anniversary of the Dol
phin Swimming and Boating Club was
held in Native Sons' Hall last night and
was a great success. The hall was
crowded with members and their lady
friends, and the literary and athletic
parts of the programme were thoroughly
enjoyed. President Joseph Laib Jr. was
In the chair, and during the evening he
introduced Charles L. Patton to the au
dience, who was received with tremen
dous applause. He delivered a brief and
pleasant speech, which was loudly
cheered. Ed H. Algeltinger, candidate
for Supervisor, was also introduced and
met with a rousing reception. After the
programme was concluded the hall was
cleared for dancing, which was kept up
till an early hour this morning.
The committee of arrangements was
composed of F. W. Woerner, C. T. Roach
E. P. Sullivan, W. O. Patch, A. L. Schup
pert, C. J. Stewart, J. J. Cronin, J. S.
Earls, E. H. Coney, F. C. Staib, A. W.

H. Pape, J. H. Medau, A. F. Michiletti,
F. C. Schwarting and J. C. Symon. The
onerous duties of floor manager fell upon
F. W. Woerner.
The Beginning of the End.
The suspense of the election canvass
will be passed in a few days, and sink or
swim, every candidate is glad that the
ordeal is nearly over.
Captain Freese, Public Administra
tor, has made himself known to almost
everybody in San Francisco by faith
ful application to his official duties. He
should easily lead in the struggle for
that office.

COLLIER AND
A STEAMER
COLLIDE
The Czarina Run Down by the
J. D. Peters Off Angel
Island.
Badly Damaged the Peters, Which Beached
at Sausalito, While the Czarina Man
aged to Reach Her Dockâ A. B.
Rich, an Electrician, the
Only One Hurt.
The collier Czarina was run down by
the river steamer J. D. Peters last night
oft Angel Island.
The Peters, which carried passengers
and crew to the number of nearly 200,
sank shortly after the collision, but not
until every soul on board had been saved.
The Peters was finally beached at Sau
salito.
She left this city shortly after 6 o'clock
under command of Captain Thoma3 IT.
Holdsworth, on her regular trip to Stock
ton. She had hardly been out more than
ten minutes and was abreast of Angel
Island when the collision occurred. The
night was dark, the moon not being up,
but there was no fog to obscure the vision
of the men at the wheels of the steamers.
The stories of the men on '.he steamers
as to how the collision occurred are of a
conflicting character. There was a mis
understanding of signals, and when a col
lision seemed inevitable the captains of
both vessels signaled for full speed
astern.
Eie Peters struck the Czarina full on
port bow. The collier was coming
n the bay in ballast and was
i out of the water. The sharp
of the Peters went crashing through
steel plates of the collier.
The force of the collision was bo great
that thirty feet of the forward deck of
the Peters was snapped off and now re
poses in the hojd of the Czarina. The
anchors, chains and hawsers remained
and dragged along after the collier as she
slowly made her way to the city.
The Peters commenced to sink at once,
and in a few minutes her brave firemen
and engineers were driven from their
posts and the fires went out. In the
meantime the sailors were clearing away
the lifeboats, into which the women pas
sengers were placed. After the first
spasm of alarm the preparations to leave
the sinking ship were made In an orderly
manner.
The Captain Weber hove in sight just
after the steamers eeparated and drew
alongside in answer to the signals of dis
tress. It did not take long to transfer
the remaining passengers, who could step
from the upper deck of the Peters to the
Weber. After all had been transferred
the women passengers, who had in the
meantime been landed on Angel Island,
were placed on board the Weber and con
tinued their Interrupted Journey to Stock
ton.
The crew worked manfully In an at
tempt to beach the Peters. She was run
on the bottom at Angel Island, but float
ed off on the strong tide. Finally the at
tempt to place her there was abandoned.
The Sea Queen made fast to her stern
post and towed her over to the Sausalito
mud fiats, where she now rests in ten feet
of water. The crew remained in the life
boats and patrolled the vicinity of the
wreck all night.
When Captain Seaman of the Czarina
found that his boat was not taking wa
ter he turned his attention to the Peters
and its pasengers. Before he could ren
der any assistance the Weber and the
Monticello were on the spot and he then
started for the city.
Owing to the mass of gear from the
Peters that remained on the bow of his
ship he found her difficult to manage, but
finally placed her in her usual berth at
Â« ward-street wharf,
he Peters has been in the river service
>ut ten years under Captain Holds
rth. She is a stern wheeier and us
ually has a large passenger list and mis
cellaneous cargo. She is owned by the
California Navigation and Improvement
Company.
The Czarina is used as a collier and is
owned by J. D. Spreckels & Bros. Co. Aft
er she was purchased by this firm she was
entirely remodeled. She haa been in the
coast trade since she was purchased last.
She was coming: from Port Costa in water
ballast when the Peters struck her.
The fact that no lives were lost is at
tributed to two things. First, the Czar
ina was struck well above the water line,
and secondly, the Peters being a wooden
vessel sank gradually, thus allowing
time for passengers and crew to disem
bark. Thus was averted what might
have proved a disaster that would have
gone down in maritime history as the
most dreadful that ever happened within
the Golden Gate.
The story told by Captain George Sea
man of the Czarina i 3 as follows:
"We were coming backfrom Port Costa,
where we had delivered a load of grain.
When off Quarry Point, east of Angel
Island, we saw the Peters coming In the
opposite direction. I gave one whistle
meaning, 'we will cross your bows,' he
answered with a single blast signifying,
'all right,' and we went ahead. When the
two vessels were close together he gave
two whistles signifying, 'look out for me,
I will cross your bows.' I saw that an
accident was inevitable, and at once sig
naled the engineer to back up full speed.
"As nearly as I can recollect the Peters
came on full speed. She struck us in our
port bow, malting a hole big enough to
drive a team through.
"We began making water fast and I
thought for a time I would have to beach
my vessel, but as we had nothing aboard
but a ballast of water I started out to
make my dock. The accident crippled us
so badly we could not steer and I finally
callpd the tug Alert to our assistance." '
The Czarina is now lying at Howard
street wharf with the whole of the bow
of the Peters still sticking in her own
bow. The anchors, chains and hawsers
are all there, too, and these dragging un
der the keel crippled her steering gear
and rendered the boat unmanageable.
The whole forward compartment is full of
water and the vessel is Tying low, but
there Is no danger of her sinking.
The damage has not yet been estimated.
Captain Seaman says he would have gone
to the assistance of the Peters, but his
own boat was so badly damaged he had
his hands full looking after her.
One of the crew of the Peters jumped
aboard the Czarina, but was so badly
frightened he did not know the name of
the vessel on which he had been working.
"My partner told me to yump," he said,
"and I yumped."
Captain Seaman believes that If the olri
cers of the Peters had used ordinary good
sense or Judgment the accident might
easily have been avoided.
So far as known, the only man injured
was A. B. Rich, electrician on the Peters,
who lives at 1601 L avenue, in this city.
He was caught In the wreckage and badly
squeezed. The steward took charge of
him and transferred him to the Monti
cello, which brought him to this city. He
was taken to the Harbor Receiving Hos
pital, but his nerves were so badly shaken
he was unable to talk, and the doctors
were obliged to administer an opiate to
put him to sleep. It Is feared that he has
sustained severe internal injuries.
Steward A. W. Dennison of the J. D.
Peters returned to t}\e city on the Monti
cello with Electrician Rlcn, who was in
jured. HiÂ» story of the wreck follows:
"We left the city on our regular trip
to Stockton at 10 minutes past 6 o'clock.
We were Just off Angel Island and the
cabin was crowded with passengers who
were at dinner. The first intimation I
haa of danger was the signals from the
boats. The first signal I heard was from
the Peters. The captain blew two b'.asts
on the whistle signifying that he was di
recting his course to port and would
thus pass the approaching boat to Htar
board. The Czarina responded, I tliink,
almost simultaneously with one blast,
showing they were directing their course
to starboard
"Both captains apparently realized that
a collision was inevitable, and signaled
'Full speed astern.' The Peters struck the
Czarina full on the port bow.
"The utmost excitement prevailed, as
the severity of the collision indicated that
the Peters had been badly damaged. The
passengers ran about wildly, but trie
crew soon quieted them in a degree and
commenced to lower the lifeboats. The
women passengers were placed in these
and landed on Angel Island.
"The Captain Weber was the first to
render us assistance. She left this city
shortly after we did, and was near by
when the collision occurred. The passen
gers were transferred to the Weber and
continued on their way to Stockton.
"Before leaving she tried to beach the
Peters. After being run aground the first
time she drifted off into deep water on
the heavy tide. She was towed back sev
eral times.
"The Monticello came along on her
down trip from vallejo and I went aboard
with the only man severely wounded in
the collision. We had about one hundred
and thirty passengers on board and a
crew of between fifty and sixty men in
the various departments. The passen
gers lost all their personal baggage and
the cargo will be a total loss.*
"The bay in the vicinity of the wreck
was covered with the cargo, which floated
out of the wreck as she sank down to her
'texas' deck."
An anxious crowd waited the arrival of
C. D. Clark, city agent of the California
Navigation and Improvement Company,
who had taken a tug for the scene of the
catastrophe as soon as the first news was
received.
When his tug arrived off Angel Island
Mr. Clark learned that the Peters had
already been towed on to tht Sausalito
mud flats by the tug Sea Queen, and so
he returned to this city without making
further Investigation.
ORDERS AND COUNTER
ORDERS MAKE TROUBLE
DRAWING BOOKS IN MISSION
GRAMMAR SCHOOLS.
Children Sent Home Because Their
Parents Will Not Buy What
the Board Has Once
Discarded.
There is trouble in the grammar schools
of the Mission. A small sized rebellion
has resulted in over two hundred pupils
taking an unexpected holiday. An order
formulated by the Board of Education,
enforced by the teachers and objected to
by the parents of the children caused the
disturbance.
The order was for drawing books, which
six months ago the board considered un
necessary, but now it thinks a child's
education cannot be completed without
one. In fact so necessary are they that
pupils who turned up at school yesterday
without them or the money necessary
to purchase were told to go homo and
stay there until they obeyed orders.
"It is the same old trouble," said a dis
gusted parent yesterday. "There is a
stack of school books in my house three
feet high that are of no use to any one
owing to the changing of the rules of
the Board of Education. A book good
enough for my eldest daughter Is useless
when my second child gets into the class
from which her sister has just been pro
moted. About six or seven months ago
the Board of Education issued an order
that all the children should buy drawing
books. Well, they did so, mine among
the rest. A few days later the children
were told that drawing was not to be
taught, and that they might take the
books home. Well, of course, they were
no use except for writing exercises in or
as scribbling paper, and as such my girla
used them.
"I thought nothing more of the matter
until last week, when my children came
home and said the order for drawing
books had gone forth again. I was mad
clean through and refused to get them,
and my children told their teacher so.
They were given until last Monday in
which to buy the books, and yesterday
they were sent home from school along
with about thirty others for failure to
obey. Of course I will have to buy the
books, but the children will have a few
days' holiday while I am making up my
mind to put a few more cents into the
pockets of the Board of Education."
OPEN AIB CONCERT.
The James M. Troutt Club of the Forty
fifth Assembly District will hold a grand
open-air concert and ratification meeting
this evening at the corner of Vallejo and
Battery streets. The meeting will be ad
dressed by Hon. Charles L. Patton, Henry
S. Martin, John D. Siebe, Thomas F.
Graham, Charles A. Low, William A.
Deane, Edward I. Sheehan, D. J. Murphy
and others. Frank H. Powers will of
ficiate as chairman of the meeting. The
Phoenix Drill Corps will be in attend
ance.
Southern Pacific Advances Rates.
On and after November 15 the Southern
Pacific will advance rates on the follow
ing articles from California terminals to
New Orleans and New York, via Sunset
Gulf route â the basis of calculation being
cents per 100 pounds: Antimony ore, from
50 to 60; manganese ore, 50 to 60; chrome
ore, 50 to 60; canned salmon, 40 to 60; rags,
50 to 60; borax, 50 to 60; rubber Junk. 50 to
60; wine in wood, 40 to 60. On two ex
tremely important Pacific Coast products,
salmon and wine, the advance, as will be
seen, amounts to 50 per cent; on the other
articles, 20 per cent.
Mariposa Again Delayed.
The sailing of the Mariposa has again
been delayed. Seven sacks of the mail for
which she was waiting were not trans
ferred at Ogden, and so had to be sent on
a later train than the one due here this
morning. As a consequence the mail will
not arrive until 8:45 o'clock to-night, and
the vessel will sail at 10 p. m. Instead of
2 p. m., as was announced.
The famous old JESSE MOORE WHISKY 1Â»

medicinal use because It is pure.
Francis- Valentine Co. Insolvent.
Blake, Moffltt & Towne and other cred
itors of the Francis-Valentine Company
filed in the United States District Court
yesterday a petition to declare the com
pany in involuntary insolvency. The al
legation is made that an unfair prefer
ence was given to the Donohoe-Kelly
Banking Company.
