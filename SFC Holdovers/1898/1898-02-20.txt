WASHINGTON, Feb. 19.â A cablegram received from
Havana to=night created a good deal of excitement, as
Charles M. Pepp % who sent the dispatch, is well
known in Washington, where he acted for a number of
years as correspondent for the Chicago Tribune. He
made a reputation for his conservatism and reliability
and was intimately acquainted with men high in the
councils of the administration. The dispatch said :
4 The Maine investigation promises to bring a cli
max to the strained relations between the two coun
tries. The naval board of inquiry will sift much doubt
ful evidence and end many wild rumors. Opinions here
seem to be that it will show no possibility of accident
through negligence. It may also show that various
plots which find belief could not have been carried out.
k * Many persons credit the story of a messenger
having gone to Washington with the names of the con=
spirators, though why he should proceed there when
the inquiry is conducted in Havana is not known. That
dynamite bombs have been manufactured and exploded
in Havana cannot be questioned. Three weeks ago
one was exploded in the center of the city. The police
claimed to have arrested the conspirators, but that
was doubted.
'No one questions the sincerity of Blanco and the
Government officials in their regret, and the manifesta
tions of sorrow have been followed by acts which were
grateful to Sigsbee and to Lee, but on that account the
theory is not abandoned that the explosion was due to
a plot to blow up the Maine by violent intransigentes,
who are as hostile to Blanco and autonomy as to the
United States. This class showed resentment
when the war vessel arrived. That it made threats is
certain. Whether the threats were idle vaporings the
naval inquiry may help to determine. It must be stated
dispassionately that the ultra Spanish make little at
tempt to conceal their satisfaction. Their feeling is
actually one of exultation.
v I saw evidences of it in a Cuban village two hun
dred miles from Havana, wfien the news was first re
ceived. Evidences multiplied that this was the real
sentiment as 1 approached Havana.
4 The Consuls in their reports to Lee have com
mented on the same feeling. The Spanish Government
is not responsible for this class, but its sentiment
dominates public opinion.
Regardless of the Maine disaster
the situation all over the island is
growing worse and the failure of au
tonomy is absolute. Gomez is also
moving his forces westward in
Santa Clara Province, though it is
uncertain that he contemplates a
demonstration in the direction of
Havana.
The insurgents have had the ad
vantage in two recent fights in
Santa Clara Province and the conse
quent demoralization among the
Spanish troops is growing. Star

also grows. American relief has
not reached fifty miles beyond Ha

NEW YORK, Feb. 19.â A cable to
the Herald from Havana says:
Further friction occurred this morn
ing between the Spanish authorities
and Captain Sigsbee regarding the
United States Government divers for
the Maine. After formally arrang
ing with General Blanco last night

ceived orders from the palace and
Captain Sigsbee was not allowed to
g-o aboard. Afterward an order
arrived from the palace and divers
are now engaged in the preliminary
work.
Captain Sigsbee has hoisted the
United States flag on the wreck and
there has not been the slightest in
terference. Spanish patrols keep
off all outsiders. The divers went
down this afternoon and Captain
Sigsbee informs me to-night that
nothing has been brought up and no
results have been obtained.
The divers are handicapped be
cause they have no diving lamp.
One was sent for this after
noon. The water is muddy and
makes the cabins darker. The
operations to-day were purely pre
liminary, the chief object being to
test the apparatus. Everything
works well and as soon as the lamp
arrives operations will begin in
earnest.
The Maine is still settling. There
is a lull in the excitement of the
public here over the disaster, but
underneath the surface anxiety still
exists. Everybody eagerly awaits
the report of the expert divers.
Several more bodies of Maine vic
tims were recovered during the
course of the day, but it is impos
sible as yet to identify them. As
proof that the explosion which de
stroyed the Jftaine was not on the
outside of the vessel the Spanish
point out that no dead fish have
been seen in the harbor.

mended itself to naval men alike as

calculated to develop the exact facts
in a manner that could not be ques

among the officials of the need of
speedy relief measures for the benefit
of the families of the explosion vic
tims.
Under the treasury rules the allot

of their families made by the men who
perished in the wreck must stop at

RAPIDLY TURNING
OUT WAR MATERIAL
NEW YORK, Feb. 19.â The Atha &
Illingworth â  Company's steel works In
Harrison, N. J.. have been during several
months steadily occupied on large
Government orders. Work Is being
pushed to complete them as quickly as
possible. Last Thursday forty long
Maxim guns of an order of 150 were de
livered to the Government. These guns
are designed for field, fort and marine
| use, equipped with either gun carriage
or on swivel stand.
Work is being pushed on thirty 4-inch
| rapid fire rifles for use of the Naval
j Reserves. Besides these guns the
; company recently made castings and
I forgings for 7 and 8 inch disappearing
gun carriages, and material for I*so
mortar guns was cast at the works.
Projectiles are also in the course of
manufacture. There are more than
12,000 of these, their individual weight
ranging from 200 to 1000 pounds. It Is
expected that the company will be able
to fill all orders.

DEFENSES OF
SAN FRANCISCO
WELL MANNED
While Fortifications Are Strength
ened a Special Train With Am
munition Is Being Hurried
From the East.
The exclusive account published
in yesterday's Call that Major-
General Miles, commanding the
army, had directed the immediate
distribution of ammunition for the
modern high-power guns and is
sued orders directing that extra
care should be taken to guard the
magazines, forts and ammunition
from all damage, was wired as
special from San Francisco to all
the leading newspapers of the
United States. The intelligence
created a profound sensation
throughout the country, as the
official order from Major-Genera/
Miles to General Shatter was given.
In compliance with the orders from Gen
eral Miles troops have taken station at the
high-power guns at the Presidio and Lime
Point. To guard against possible damage
to- the guns and gun carnages the chain of
sentinels has been re-enforced. A vigilant
system of patrolling has been ordered to
prevent the approa ch of parties who have
no business to spy about the fortifications
of this harbor.
When the orders from Washington were

conveyed to Colonel Miles, post commander
at the Presidio, he lost no time in executing
them. The guards were doubled and the
officers were enjoined to use the greatest
vigilance to guard the magazines and pro
tect the guns from injury by accidental or
premeditated explosion.
The military authorities at the Presidio
sought to withhold the information officially
received by wire from Washington, believing
that the publication of the intelligence in
the press would inflame the popular mind.
The fact transpires that the high-power
guns at Lime Point, which constitute the
highest modern battery in the world, were
wholly unsupplied with ammunition, save a
few rounds for target practice. Immediate
steps were therefore taken to send a full
supply of shot and shell for the three
twelve-inch rifles and the four fifteen-inch
guns, which comprise the mounted ordnance
at this important fort on the Marin bluffs.
The ammunition was taken yesterday after
noon from the magazine at Fort Mason
(Black Point) and placed in barges, which
were towed acrjoss the channel to Lime
Point (Fort Baker). The twelve-inch
rifled breech-loading guns of the fort have
a range of ten miles. A ship approaching

HONOR OF AMERICA IS YET SACRED
WILL COMPEL
THE SPANIARDS
TO SELL CUBA
President Medley Said to Ha ve
Made Up His Mind Definitely
Upon the Matter at
Last.
BOSTON, Mas.".. Feb. 19.â A Washington special says: The plan of
the administration for the solution uf the Cuban question by the pur
chase o* the island meets with general approval among the more con
servative members of Congress to whom it was tc-day revealed. New
York financiers to-day offered to tloat the necessary bondÃ. Whether
Congress, as a whole, will indorse the scheme is a question which
neither the President r.or his advisers in the Senate are ready defi
nitely to answer, although Mr. MeKinley has strong hope that it will
receive legislative approval. It is not certain, of course, that the plan
will ever reach the stage where it can be formally laid before Con
gress. Much depends upon the result of the court of inquiry, and
should that be satisfactory there is still a doubt as to the manner in
which Spain will receive such a proposition of sale.
Aa yet there has been no correspondence between the two govern
ments, and there will be none until something more is known about
the disaster to the Maine. But it may be stated that the destruction
of the Maine, following so closely after the De Lome incident, has had
the effect upon the administration in determing that the policy of pur
chase should be followed up. The plan has been more or less under con
sideration for some time, but not until now has the administration
been able to see its way with any clearness to its realization. New
York financiers to-day volunteered to float the bonds to be issued for
the protection of the purchase.
President McKinely proposes to ask Congress to approve an offer
by the insurgents to purchase the island. The security for this trans
action is to lie in the Cuban custom house and Cuban exports. It is
believed that the revenues will rapidly pay any loan that may be ne
gotiated. Without the guarantee of the United States, the bonds need
ed could not be negotiated, but with the indorsement of this Govern
ment they would be acceptable anywhere at par.
The cost has been variously estimated, but it is uncertain what
Spain's attitude would be. Should Spain refuse to fix a price for her
colony, which shall not include the enormous war debt already in
curred, the President proposes to interfere In such a way as to give the
Cubans a chance for independence without any pecuniary benefit to
Spain. In other words, the President proposes to compel Spain to sell
Cuba to its inhabitants. The negotiations for this purchase have been
in contemplation for months.
The De Lome incident almost forced the promulgation of the plan.
The disaster in Havana haibor, it is said, has determined its adoption
beyond question. Nothing can be done, however, until the verdict of
the court of inquiry is given. If it shall appear that the explosion
was due to an accident, thÂ«m the purchase of Cuba will be formally
proposed. If foul play is proved there will be involved diplomatic ne
gotiations for indemnity or something worse. Either result would be
a bar to the scheme for pu-chase.
The administration has taken Into its confidence several Senators,
who have been conducting a quiet canvass to ascertain what the
prospects of such a plan as that proposed would have in Congress.
They report that in their opinion the policy would be approved. The
President is determined that some solution of the Cuban problem
should be reached, and that without much more delay.
Congress would undoubtedly object to the assumption by the United
States, even indirectly, of the Spanish war debt, which is said to
amount to $400,000,000, but the President has no intention at present
of asking for such a guarantee as this. He believes that a payment of
$100,000,000 will suffice.
direction ocean ward would come under the
range of this battery.
No doubt the signs of war will induce
the authorities at Washington to establish
a battery of high-power guns at Point
Bonita. This position commands a sweep- j
ing range, and a battery there would be
highly effective against a hostile fleet.
The big 12-inch guns on the hill back \
of Fort Point were supplied yesterday
with ammunition. So far as ascertained,
only a few of the shells are charged with
explosives, but the powder is on hand for
charging whenever the emergency of firing
arises.
The officers and enlisted men of the Third
United States Artillery are at their respec
tive stations guarding the guns from the
intrusive inspection of outsiders. The
mortars and the dynamite guns are sup
plied with ammunition and are carefully
guarded.
Whatever the conditions may be in New
York, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Boston, Sa-r
vannah and other cities on the Atlantic
coast, the fact is recognized by military
authority and by good judges outside of the
ADVERTISEMENTS.

protected. Should war be declared to-day
and Spain's most formidable fleet be within
striking distance of this harbor, the guns
now in position and ready for immediate
use would stand off the fleet as long as
the supply of ammunition lasted.
The Call is not able to ascertain here or
in Washington the real facts about the
' supply of ammunition for the forts of this
harbor. For good and sufficient reasons,
perhaps, the ordnance authorities do not
take the press into their confidence on this
subject, but diligent inquiry leads to the
belief that the supply at Benicia arsenal is
â¢ limited.
The Call's correspondent at Benicia was
yesterday directed to interview the com
mandant at the arsenal and in response
wired this message :

The special train mentioned in the dis
patch from Benicia may be bringing only
projectiles, as powder for the use of the
high-power guns can be obtained from the
works in California. This is mere conjec
ture, and it may transpire that the Govern
ment does not want to take any chances on
powder and will therefore supply the
arsenal ot Benicia and the magazines in this
harbor with ammunition fixed for imme
diate use.
When a nation prepares for war it is not
wise to underrate the strength or fighting
quality of the opposing power. Spain is a
proud old nation, and if impelled by force
of events to meet the United States in
battle would doubtless make a desperate
struggle to held her own. The chances are
that she would not send a ship of war to the
Pacific Ocean, and therefore San Francisco
would be remote from the scenes of actual
conflict. The Spanish army in Cuba might
be considerably re-enforced by fresh troops
from Spain before our cruisers could pre
vent the re-enforcement. The idea foolishly
entertained that a few regiments could
walk over Cuba and subdue the Spanish
forces ought to be dismissed. It is just
about as absurd as was the notion that the
United States could put down the rebellion
of the South with 100,000 men in sixty
days. It is on a par with the belief enter
tained by the South that one Southern man
was good for six Northerners in a fight.
Spain has an army and a navy, and is capa
ble of putting up a good battle on land and
sea. In a fight to the finish the United
States would give old Spain a terrible
trouncing, but in the first few engagements
our troops and ships might be worsted.
The Americans are patient and slow to na
tional wrath, but when once aroused they
make war in earnest
It is not likely that England, Germany.
France. Russia, Austria or Italy would
interfere in a conflict with the United States
and Spain. The general opinion exists in
Europe that the United States does not
amount to much as a fighting nation. The
defeat of Spain would cause some annoy
ance and surprise, but Europeans would
entertain thereafter greater respect for the
American nation.
President Me Kin ley seems to be very
anxious to suppress the war feeling in this
country. He has been through one war and
knows that war is not so desirable and
beautiful as some imagine it to be.
General Shaffer received the following
telegram yesterday from the headquarters
of the army in Washington, which signifies
to many that the President is seeking to
allay public excitement :
"Washington, Feb. 19.
"Commanding Genera/ Department of
California, San Francisco : The President
directs that the period during which flags
at military posts, etc., were ordered to be
displayed at half-staff as appropriate honor
to deceased in disaster to battleship Maine
terminate at sunset to-day.
SAMUEL BRECK, Adjutant-General."
To-morrow the flags in California will be
displayed at half-staff, in compliance with
the proclamation of Governor Budd, which
was issued last Friday.
In New York and Chicago the display of
flags was remarkable. Many of the flags
were draped in mourning and as an ex
pression of sorrow many of the buildings
were so draped.
WRECKAGE OF
THE LOST SHIP
Companies Putting in
Bids to Do the
Work.
Two Concerns Combine Their
Plants in Order to Save
the Maine.
But the Navy Department Has Not
Yet Awarded the Contract
for the Work.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office. Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 19.
The contract for the work of saving
portions of the Maine, and, if pos
sible, raising her, was not closed to
day, although representatives of
wrecking concerns were in conference
with Navy Department officials
throughout the day. Captain Lern
ley, who will frame the contract, said
that progress has been made toward
understanding the general plan of
operation, but a final agreement had
not been reached. Until to-day the
Merriam & Chapman Wrecking Com
pany and the Boston Towboat Com
pany have been alone in the Held, and
the department understood they had
combined their interests. This would
have insured the Government the
double facilities of these extensive
wreckers and would have given them
the contract. But to-day the LuckiMi
bach Wrecking Company of New
York City entered upon a competi
tion for the work, and before the day
closed it had made a bid.
The other concerns did not bid to
day, but expect to do so Monday. The
plan proposed by them is to use the
large wrecking tug Orion of the Bos
ton company, in conjunction with the
powerful cranes of the Merriam com
pany. If this plan is adopted, the
Orion will carry the wrecking material
to Havana and then serve in trans
porting the heavy turrets, guns and
detachable parts of the Maine back to
the Norfolf navy yards, where it is
proposed to assemble the remnants of
the ship.
The Luckenbach company propose a
different plan. Their bid contemplates
the use of large bargt-s hauled by ocean
tugs, in bringing parts of the wreck to
Norfolk. In other respects the plan of
operations of all bidders Is to assume
the entire work of furnishing appli
ances, divers, etc., and delivering such
material as is savod to Norfolk.
A government official is to make gen
eral inspection of the work as it pro
ceeds.
R. CJ. Packard a wrecking engineer
and contractor, n a.a present and urged
the contracl sh aid be divided into
two partsâ tirst T he saving of such
parts aÂ» can he detached, and second,
the raising of th<- hull. He also made
the point that the removal of the
Maine as an obstruction to navigation
was a duty incumbent on this govern
ment and that the cost of that branch
of the work would be one-half as much
as the cost of saving portions of the
ship. The department is desirous,
however, of having the work done as
8 whole, and bids will be accepted
probably on that basis.
UNCL E SAM ' S MILITIA
ANXIOUS TO SERVE.
Guardsmen, Naval Reserve and
Uniformed Pythians Ready to
Volunteer for War.
Lieutenant W. E. Elliot, aid to Cap
tain Turner, commanding the naval
militia, in talking of the spirit of the
men in that arm of the National Guard,
said: "The men are all ready at a mo
ment's notice to go to the defense of
the flap, and if there should be a call
I believe that almost every man who
has dropped out of the militia would
re-enlist. Our ranks would be fill
ed to the maximum number in no
time. Lieutenant Morey, who a few
weeks since resigned, telephoned me
that in view of the condition of affairs
at this time, he is sorry that he sent in
his resignation, but that if the militia
is called out, he will re-enlist, even if
he has to do so as a cook."
Lieutenant -Colonel Duboce of the
First Infantry, N. G. C, speaking of
the National Guard generally, and of
the First Regiment in particular, said:
"I am confident when I speak of the
First Regiment. if there ' should
be a call for men that within forty
eight hours the twelve companies
would be recruited up to their full
strength, provided they were required
to go to the front, but I do not think
that would be the case if it were to
send them out to the Presidio to take
charge of the post and guard the bat
teries at Fort Point."
There is an organization In the
United States known as the Uniform
Rank of the Knights of Pythias, which
is recognized by the War Department
as next to the National Guard of the
several fitntes. and which is ready at
any time to answer a call from that
department. Brigadier-General (re
tired) Herman Schaffner of this Pity
said yesterday: "The lesson taught
to all Pythlans is that they are to
support the constitution of the United
States. The members of the Uniform
Rank, who are distributed over the
different States of the Union, are all
drilled in accordance with the United
States regulations, and they all under
stand by implication that it is a part
of their obligation to stand by the con
stitution. They number at this time
52.000, more than 1000 of which are in
California. They are under the or
ders of Major-General James R. Car
nahan of Indianapolis, Ind. During
the trouble with Chile, the force of the
Uniform Rank was tendered to the Na
tional Government and if it is needed
at this time it will no doubt be ten
dered again."
SPAIN IS VERY ANXIOUS
TO MAKE OUT A CASE.
MADRID, Feb. 19.â A dispatch received to-day from Rear Admiral
Manterola. the naval commander at Havana, says proof exists that no
dead flah came to the surface after the explosion that wreclced the
Maine, and that when the disaster occurred there was not the slight
eat upheaval of the water, such as would inevitably follow a sub
marine explosion.
THIS COAST
IS PROTECTED
Admiral Kirkland Speaks
â¢ With Confidence of
His Ships.
Ready to Meet Any Force of
Spaniards Thatt May Be
Sent Out.
Vessels at Mare Island That Will Be
in Shape for Service Very
Soon.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
VALLEJO, Feb. 19.â "We can take
care of any force the Spaniards can
send against us on this coast," said
Admiral Kirkland, the commandant
of the navy-yard, to-day. "If we
were to go up against England or
France or Germany we could truth
fully say we were not prepared Just
at present for war, but with Spain we
are now in a position to take care of
ourselves.
"On this coast we have two ships,
the Monterey and Monadnock, ready
for a battle at an hour's notice, and
either one of them could whip the best
ship in the Spanish navy. Then there
is the Oregon. She is now in the
drydock at Port Orchard, but she
could be ready for service in a w r eck,
or perhaps less, if she should be call
ed upon.
"In a few weeks we could have the
Philadelphia. Charleston and York
town that are now in the yard ready
for sea. With those six vessels we
would have a formidable fleet and the
coast could be well protected should
war come with Spain. "
The loss of the Maine Is attracting
all the attention of the officers of the
navy yard. Little else is talked about
and with the conversation comes the
ories that big ships of war are not as
serviceable or as effective as small
ones. There is hardly an officer at the
yard from Admiral Kirkland down to
the newest ensign who is not of the
opinion that big battleships are not
what they are in theory represented to
be.
Whether the Maine was destroyed by
design or by accident, they say, it
shows the fallacy of constructing such
large vessels. A battleship like the
Maine, or the Oregon, or the Texas, or
any of that type of vessel, costs about
$5,000,000 when complete with her ma
chinery, armament, ammunition, stores
and equipment. She carries from 400
to 800 souls. She can be only at one
spot at one given time. She requires
deep water to float in, and most har
bors are inaccessible to her. Should
she touch a soft bottom it means end
less expense and great damage. SHould
she get on rocks she is likely to be
permanently disabled, if not totally de
stroyed.
In case of accident to any one of her
end compartments she will be so sub
merged she cannot enter a place for
safety unless she has a deep channel
to enter by. Fifty pounds of dynamite
or other high explosive under her bot
tom will either incapacitate her or else
destroy her totally if applied under her
magazines or boilers.
A monitor of the Monterey or
Monadnock type would give her a fair
battle, and two such vessels, both
costing almost one-half that rrf a bat
tleship, would easily blow her out of
the water. Ten torpedo boats costing
$200,000 each and aggregating $2,000,000,
attacking her simultaneously under or
dinary conditions of night, will sink
her.
If the battle-ship should destroy one
or two, or even three, there would only
be a loss of $600,000 and a few lives
on the one side as against many mil
lions of dollars and hundreds of lines
on the other.
These torpedo-boats burning liquid
fuel could harass the officers and crew
of the big vessel until the battle-ship
would be demoralized. They could out
run the big warship and make their
attacks at their own convenience.
They could keep her surrounded at all
times and be invisible to her in the
confusion of a night attack. Such a
thing as accurate firing at rapidly mov
ing objects of such small size as a
torpedo-boat would be practically im
possible. ___ __ - ___^_ -

Spaniards Drape a Hog in Old
Glory and" a Bull Gores the
Porker to Death.
A prominent resident of San Fran
cisco, who is not willing that his name
should be published, spoke yesterday
of his travels in Spain some eighteen
months since. He was there about the
time that some speeches on the Cuban
situation were delivered in the Senate
of the United States and the Spanish
people were highly indignant. He said:
"At Seville I attended a bull fight.
Now in Spain the hog is thought to
represent the lowest and most degraded
of all animals, so to entertain the vast
audience which congregated to witness
the exhibition the management brought
into the arena a hog wearing the flag
and colors of the United States. Then
as a combatant for the hog there was
introduced a fine, furious bull attired
in the colors of Spain. The bull at once
gratified the spectators by a furious
rush at the Yankee hog, and the Ameri
can colors were soon tarnished in the
blood of the despised porker. When the
hog was slain and the flag trampled on
the audience cheered to the echo."
This resident of San Francisco spoke
Spanish fairly well and three young
ladies with him spoke it fluently. His
courier gave out that the party were
Americans. The term American is
understood in Spain to apply to South
Americans. The people of the United
States are known as Yankees. The San
Franciscan heard the opinion freely ex
pressed that Spain never was whipped
and never could be, and that in the
event of war between the two coun

Cuban Matter.
NEW YORK, Feb. 19.â The Herald's Washington correspondent
says: Official information has reached Washington showing that
Spain is making an earnest effort to rapidly place herself in a condi
tion to support any steps she may choose to take in the Cuban ques
tion. I was informed by a well-known naval officer to-day that
Spain is placing contracts for smokeless powder, which will be truim
ported to her arsenals in Spain and in Cuba.
It is understood that orders were issued by the Ministers of the
Navy and War of Spain on January 27 to have work at various ship
yards hastened. The orders had special reference, it is said, to the
battle-ship Petayo, the armored eruisÂ«r Carlos V, and the armored
cruiser Cristobal Colon, whose armament is to be put in place with the
greatest speed.
Other orders issued by the Spanish Minister of the Navy which
have come to the knowledge of the department, contemplate the ex
pedition of work on other ships under repair or construction at different
yards. The torpedo-boat destroyer Prosperina, which is now ready
for active service, is expected to shortly arrive in Spain, where she will
be placed in commission. Speed trials of the Dona Maria de Molina
have taken place and she has been accepted.
The battle-ship Petayo has a displacement of 9900 tons. She has
been supplied with new boilers and is to receive a modern armament
of rather heavy character.
The Carlos Vis a 9089-ton armored cruiser. She is supplied with
eleven 8-inch guns and five 5-inch rapid firing guns.
The Cristobal Colon is a sister ship to the Argentina cruiser
Jose Garibaldi, purchased by the Spanish Government. She is a 6840
ton cruiser, and Is one of the most modern vessels of her type.
State Department advices are that the Spanish authorities have
taken necessary precautions to provide American citizens in the pe
ninsula with protection. Around the house of Minister Woodford vig
ilance has been increased. A squad of policemen is continually pa
trolling the grounds and the Minister has a body guard, it is said, of
six men.
tries the Yankees, who were not es
teemed as fighters, would get a terrible
whipping.
"They really believe that they can
whip us easily," said the traveler.
"They cited Napoleon's failure to con
quer Spain and spoke of their men as
the bravest in the world. The hostil
ity to the United States is intense and
is shared by all classes of the people.
Nearly every family in the land has
sent some representative to subdue the
Insurgents in Cuba. All the misfor

GUARDED
Taking No Chances With
the BiÂ£ Spanish
Cruiser.
Small Fear of Anything Happen
ing to Her in New York
Harbor, but the Watch
Will Be Kept.
NEW YORK, Feb. 19.â Fog kept the
Spanish cruiser Vizcaya at anchor off
the Sandy Hocrk lightship to-day. So
thick was the weather that her pilot,
"Dan" Gillespie, would not take the
risk of advising Captain Eulate to en
ter port. If the fog has lifted to-mor
row morning the Vizcaya will get up
her anchor at daybreak and steam
glowly up the bay. Her captain was
not sure to-day whether he would take
his ship to the North River, off Thirty
fourth street, or find a berth off Tomp
kinsville.
Residents of Greater New York will
be informed of the warship's formal en
trance to the port by the sound of her
: . guns, for she will salute thÂ« stars and
stripes at Fort Wadsworth as Bhe
tomes in, and the fort will bellow a wel- j
come in kind.
In case the morning: is not clear the :
Vizcaya will remain off the Hook. Her j
pilot will not move until he can see '
clearly, for, besides the Vizcaya's great â¢;
draught â she draws twenty-six feet â i
the universal desire that her visit shall
be marred by no unpleasant incident '.
will result in the exercise of unusual
caution.
Liners, fogbound, as was the big
fighting machine, were lying at an
chor not far from her, dim shapes in :
the mist. The Vizcaya's big guns
wore their water proofs, as did the
officers and marines on deck. The
men presented a picturesque appear- I
ance. In uniforms the Vizcaya's com- j
pany iÂ« rich.
It â¢<*-Â«Â« a>-<reÂ»iT<itty mi-1 wretched'
weather, combined with the depressing
news;! concerning the disaster to the
Maine and the resignation of Senor i
De-Lome, carried to the Vizcaya after i
she anchored <m Friday evening, ap- !
k ed to have lowered the spirits of i
7. ; ose on hoard.
The <TU!?fr surely gave one an im- ;
lifferent from that made
on Friday evening, when music and
dancing: followed the plunge of her
"great anchors. Their morning- coffee
disposed <â {, the offlct-rs were told that
the big rie; Elder F. Luckenbach was
cm-ins; alongside. As she hailed, they
learne<l that she carried Lieutenant-
Commander J. G. Sobral, naval attache
of the Spanish legation in Washington.
Lieutenant-Commander Sobral, with
Vice-Consul Mariano F. Sotelo,
â¢ :â¢ Manual S. de Suarez, secretary
of thp Spanish consulate, and one of
Captain McClusky's detectives, left the
city at 5 o'clock in the morning, and
ed th^ cruiser after three hours'
cautious steaming through the mist-
The officer of the deck recognized
.'nant-Commander Sobral as an
old shipmate, and hailed him affection
ately.
Captain Eulate received the visitors
and shook hands cordially with each in
turn. Lieutenant-Commander Sobral
informed Captain Eulate of the recent
Fining events. The officers and men
wh-o were not on duty were discussing
these events before the Luckenbach's
arrival, and the lieutenant's confirma-
tion increased the subdued excitement
on :board. All scouted the idea that the
lofs of the Maine could have been due
to anything but an accident. One offl
<-~r. speaking for the group, said the
lose txf so many brave men and so fine
a ship was an appalling disaster, and
that the Vizcaya's company sympa
thized sincerely with the people of the
United States.
The' Luckenbach took off all of the
visitors .except Lieutenant-Commander j
Pahral, who said later that he would j
f-omie up with the ship. The Herald- !
< all tug ran alongside the Vizcaya at i
2:30 o'clock in the afternoon, Just as I
Eulate and Pilot Gillespie were
deciding that the fog would not lift in
time to permit of the cruiser coming ]
up. Before this, tho reporter hailed j
the Vizcaya and asked that Lieutenant-
Commander Sobral be called on deck.
To this the officer of the deck respond- j
<*A politely, "In a moment," and the j
lieutenant-commander emerged from |
shelter with a big coat-collar turned
high and a tourist cap pulled well down
to shed the falling rain.
It happened that while the reporter
was asking the lieutenant-commander
about the effect of the news concerning
the Maine upon the Vizcaya's officers
Captain Eulate himself appeared. The
lieutenant interrupted himself to bow
Jn Captain Eulate's direction. The
Vize aya's commander saluted grace- j
fully and held up his hand to indicate
that he had something to say. He
Spoke most Impressively, as a man
deeply rrioved. He had been asked j
many questions after he had been told j
of the fate of the Maine and her men, j
and he had decided to speak of the j
catastrophe.
"It fills our hearts with grief to
rWr of the terrible fate of the Unit
ed Suites battle-ship Maine and her
brave crew in Havana," he said in
Spanish. "As sailors we sympathize
deeply with the American people in
their bereavement. We are fond of
! this great country and are glad to
\ be here."
He waved his hand in farewell,
: smiled down upon the tug's company
and withdrew.
Lieutenant-Commander Sobral then
said that all on board were deeply
affected by the news. He was unable
to say how long the Vizcaya would re
main in port. He could say only that
she would come up the harbor as soon
as it was clear enough to proceed with
out risk. The reporter was told that
Lieutenant-Commander Sobral did not
GENERAL GOMEZ MOVING
TOWARD THE CAPITAL.
HAVANA, Feb. 19.â Because of the Maine disaster, which has so ex
clusively occupied the public attention during the last few days, no
attention has been paid to the rebels, but reports just received from
the field show that their movements must be taken into account in
studying the solution of this prolonged war.
General Gomez is coming west. For months he has laid inactive in
the mountains. I know of little now that can stop a western invasion
by General Gomez. His forces have now reached Placetas, near Santa
Clara, and led by his own staff officers have fought two engagements
since Saturday. Of these the first was fought east of Placetas on Sun
day afternoon, and the second west of Placetas on Tuesday. In
neither battle did the Spanish succeed in checking the rebel advances.
The Spanish are now throwing re-enforcements into Matanzas province
and will form a living trocha.
Therelief committee, headed by Miss Clara Barton, is arranging its'
work in Havana and the immediate vicinity. Consul Barker, in San
pua la Grande, says he has not yet received either food or money for
distribution, and his district is one of the worst in the island. General
Lee refers all inquiries to Miss Barton. The local committee is com
posed solely of Spaniards.
convey to Captain Eulate the cabled
instructions sent to this port for him,
but it is probable that this was errone
ous, as that was understood to be the
chief reason for the lieutenant's trip
down the bay.
It was decided yesterday that when
the weather cleared sufficiently to per
mit the Vizcaya to come up, Lieutenant
Ward, representing Rear Admiral
Bunce, will board her after she has
given and received a salute and
reached her new anchorage. At the
navy yard four Government tugs await
news that the cruiser has left the Hook,
and will mount guard over her as soon
as she reaches the upper harbor.
It is probable that General Merritt,
commanding Department of the East,
will make a formal call upon Captain
Eulate of the Vizcaya. While strict
etiquette that the senior naval officer
pay his respects in such a case, it is
unusual for the highest military officer
at hand to call upon such a distin
guished foreign visitor in person.
Dispatches from Washington are to
the effect that there will be no extra
ordinary restrictions regarding visi
tors to the Vizcaya as far as Captain
Eulate is concerned. He and his Gov
ernment, however, will accept the
proffered aid of this Government in
preventing indiscriminate visitors from
reaching the ship and in keeping sus
picius persons and meddlesome craft
at a distance.
Senor Duboise, Spanish Charge
d' Affaires in Washington, feels no ap
prehension regarding the safety of the
cruiser in the port, their dispatches
say.
For Chief of Police McCullagh and
his men to-day there was practically
nothing to do in the matter of the Viz
caya but watch and wait. The chief
said this evening that no change had
been made in the police arrangements
respecting the Spanish cruiser.
"Everything is in exactly the same
position as on Friday," he said. "I am
waiting for instructions from Rear-Ad
miral Bunce. As soon as he notifies
me that the Vizraya is preparing to
come up the harbor I shall order a
steamboat patrol and police launches
in charge of Captain Elliott O. Smith
of the harbor police to start down the
bay to meet the Spanish ship. I do
not anticipate the least trouble in con
nection with the ship while she is in
this port.
"Residents of New York I am sure
will treat the visitors with due court
esy. If. however, some foolish and Ir
responsible people should entertain the
idea that he will have an opportunity
to commit any unlawful act in connec
tion with the visiting vessel he may as
well disabuse his mind at once."
The guard that will be maintained
about the ship by the police launches
and navy yard tugs will be so close
that no craft of any kind will have
an opportunity to get anywhere near
her unless satisfactory reason is given.
Captain Smith t-aid that the guard
around the ship will be divided into
three watches. The first watch will
commence at 8 o'clock in the morning
and will consist of two tugs from the
navy yard on which there will be four
marines and a corporal and three pa
trolmen and a roundsman. This watch
will remain on duty until 4 o'clock in
the afternoon. The second watch will

guard the ship until midnight, when it
will be relieved by the third watch,
which will guard the cruiser until 8
o'clock in the morning. The third
watch will consist of police launches
only.
THE MAINE'S WOUNDED
STILL COMING IN.
Ten More of the Survivors of the
Disaster Reach Key West in the
Steamer Mangrove.
KEY WEST, Fla., Feb. 19.â The bat
tle-ship lowa, whose commander. Cap
tain W. T. Sampson, is to be president
of the Board of Inquiry which is to
investigate the wrecking of the Maine,
arrived in port from Dry Tortugas to
day. The flagship New York, with
Captain F. E. Chadwick and Lieuten
ant-Commander W. P. Potter, who are
to be members of the court, had pre
ceded her. The torpedo-boat Erics
son took out mail to the lowa. Rear-
Admiral Skard came ashore during the
day to arrange for the court and to
meet Lieutenant-Commander Adolph
Marix of the Vermont, who Is to be
Judge Advocate. The latter arrived
here from Washington this morning.
I was told that the court would prob
ably convene on Monday. Its sitting
will be in the Federal building In this
city. All of the men who were on the
Maine at the time of the explosion and
who are able to testify will be exam
ined.
With ten more survivors of the
Maine's crew the lighthouse steamer
Mangrove arrived at this port from
Havana to-day. Some of the men had
been unable to save even their cloth
ing. All were scantily clad, and some
had only blankets around them. Most
of them were suffering from severe
burnÂ§, but Dr. Clendenin, who was in
charge of them, said that all would
probably recover. They were supplied
with clothing from the naval store
house by Commander Forsythe, and
were then taken to the barracks hos
pital. This accession swells the total
number of survivors now here to fifty
eight. All of the wounded are doing
well. Eleven seriously injured men in
Havana will probably be brought here
in a few days by the steamer Fern.
NOW READY TO MARCH
AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE.
CHICAGO, Feb. 19.â Since Friday
morning Fort Sheridan, where the
Fourth Infantry and the First Cavalry
are stationed, has been in a state of the
utmost activity. Soldiers have been
polishing their weapons, arranging
mess kits, grooming horses and prepar
ing generally to march at a moment's
notice. Colonel Robert H. Hall, in com
mand of the fort, yesterday received
one telegram among the many mes
sages delivered to him daily which
caused him to take action. He at once
ordered that general preparations for
a possible summons be made.
Accordingly, every man at the fort
was set to work. Every man of the
700 soldiers at the fort busied himself
arranging his army belongings.
Every man has been supplied with
ammunition sufficient for 100 rounds oi
shots. This is in both the cavalry and
infantry. Orders were issued to the
soldiers to turn defective weapons into
the ordnance and new ones have been
supplied. To-day final preparations in
compliance with the orders were com
pleted and those stationed at the fort
were in readiness to receive orders of
any character.

RUMORS
One Is That a Weyler Mine
Caused the Maine
Disaster.
Services of The Herald=Call Diver
Accepted by Sigsbee, but
Later Refused, Owing to
Complications.
HAVANA, Feb. 19.â 1t is not yet
known what caused the explosion that
wrecked the Maine, and not until a
diver makes an examination of the
wreck will it be positively known
whether the vessel was shatter
ed by an interior explosion or by an
exterior one. There are some difficul
ties in pushing this inquiry, but just
what they are I can only conjecture.
This much I know, that I employed a
diver with the intention of having him
make an examination on the part of the
Herald and San Francisco Call. To do
so it was necessary to obtain permis
sion of Captain Sigsbee, and this was
refused. Courteously but firmly the
captain told me that after all the bodies
have been recovered an official exam
ination would be made, but not till
then.
To aid in this work of rescue I at
once offered to Captain Sigsbee the
services of the Herald-Call. The offer
was made at the Ingrlaterra Hotel on
Thursday night and was at once ac
cepted. Accompanied by the diver I
put out to the wreck yesterday morn
ing. Captain Sigsbee was there in the
gig of the Fern, and with him were
three officers of the Maine. I explained
to Captain Sigsbee that the diver was
with me and wished service.
He thanked me and said that "com
plications" had arisen which prevented
him from using the diver just then.
Later he would, but he could not

has adopted ever since the trial began.
He keeps up this manner with remark
able endurance, but, it must be admit
ted, without any great benefit or re
suit to the trial, for it only adds to the
general feeling or lassitude and kind
of anguish which commences to envelop
this case and which, like a rising flood,
goes on little by little until it reaches
even the jury. From this point or' view
to keep up the case eternally is to mis
take public opinion, which cries out
â Enough, enough," and scolds so hard
as to penetrate through the thick walls
of the Palais de Justice.
Even with Zola convicted, such men
as Drummont and Rochefort will not
lay down their arms. They are deter
mined to turn the question to political
account and use it if they can as a
platform at the forthcoming elections
a few months hence. Already this ob
ject is pretty clearly defined, and I can
mention more than one candidate to
whom electoral committees proposed
the question: "Are you for or against
the ant - ttem agitation carried on
oy some with socialist aims?"
By others the idea is that the reac
tion is capable of bringing about a
state of feeling not unlike that which j
gave birth to Boulangism. So strong i
is this sentiment in certain quarters !
that a sea of pretenders whose preten- I
- pass for being singularly pla- â¢
send forth salutations to the !
under the form of letters pub- j
" be newspapers in Paris more |
or less devoted to their cause. The I
Duke de Orleans, after the Esterhazy
sffair. expressed grief, for the affair
k his patriotic heart, and ex
wd bop<? that out of it would
g a return to France of "healthy
-chical traditions.". Prince Napo
â¢ astened to express the same sen- |
ots :n this connection. Under the I
regime of the plebiscite and even !
to Charles Louis Bourbon, there !
has been no one whose effusions we \
have read recently who has not associ
ated the idea of country with that of
the "legitimacy."
The crowd present at the Zola trial
- _;â¢' was very large, but compara
tive quiet was maintained. M. La
borie, counsel for M. Zola, asked Col-
Picquart if the bordereau was
written in March or April, 1894, and i
the witness answered that he did not
remember.
General Pellieux refused to answer
questions put to him, in conformity
with his statement of yesterday that it
was for the Advocate-General to deal
â with matters outside of the Zola case.
He added:
"I am of the opinion that, through
cut this trial, strange things have hap
pended. A person here," turning to
ward Colonel Picquart, "and I say it
to his face (sensation), who still wears
the uniform of the French army, comes
to this court and accuses military men
of having committed forgery and of
having turned it to account." (Pro
longed cheers from the back of the
court.)
To this Colonel Pioquart replied:
'I have said I have too much respect
for my chiefs and for justice to with
hold the truth, and I say it again, in
the presence of my chiefs."
"I also say the soldiers are animated
by pood faith," said M. Laborie, "but
"You are making a speech," inter
rupted the Presiding Judge.
No," replied M, Laborie, "I wish to
establishing something of the greatest
importance, and they are trying to In
timidate me."
"You are making a speech," said
the presiding Judge again. "I shall
have to stop you."
"I am obliged to you every time you
Btop me," remarked M. Laborie, "as
you thereby confer fresh honor upon
me." (Cheers.)
This caused General Pellieux to re
mark: "He has just played with the
rase, and played with it against his
win."
ML Laborie began to comment upon
thf?e statements, but the presiding
Jnige threatened him with disciplinary
punishment if he did not cease talk
ing. This action of the court caused a
row in the back of the court room, and
M. Laborie passionately addressed the
disturbers, saying:
"What rejoices you is to see right and
Justice violated more and more every
day."
Then, addressing M. Zola, M. Laborie
exclaimed:
"I a?k myself â¢whether it would not
be better for us to leave the court than
to allow ourselves to be treated as we
are treated?" (Uproar in court.)
Colofiel Pierjuart said the paper re
r<rr<-<] to in Major Ravary's report ap
peared to applj to an officer of a line
reglmeni rather than to a staff officer,
â¢.-il witnespes, including Anatole
Prance, testified to If. Zola's courage

thai the ''oum-il of Ministers had de
clined to authorize General Billot, the
Minist'-r of War, to testify, and the de
fense made the announcement that it
would not call any more witnesses.
The court then adjourned until Mon
day. The rase will conclude on

TELLS HER
STORY TO
THE JURY
How Mrs. Scully Pur
chased a Star for
Her Husband.
Herself Paid the Money
to Councilman Krieg's
Brother.
Her Husband Turned His Back
While the Deal Was Con
summated,
TALE OF BRIBE-TAKING.
Damning Testimony Against the Ac
cused City Officials of San
Jose.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, Feb. 19.â "1 handed the
money to my husband to give to W.
C. Krieg, but Krieg refused to receive
it from Johnnie, and told him to pass
it back to me. which he did. I then
paid it to Krieg."
This was part of the testimony given
by Mrs. John H. Scully to-day before
the Grand Jury in the investigation of
bribery charges against Councilman
Julius Krieg. a brother of W. C. Krieg.
She had been frightened into silence
yesterday by being told by a number
of people that she would be sent to San
Quentin if she gave testimony before
the Grand Jury. A night's refreshing
slumber, however, had given her fresh
courage, and she went before the Grand
Jury to-day, as she expressed it, to
tell them the whole truth. Her testi
mony to-day, as a whole, was In line
with the affidavit which she had made
a week ago.
Her husband also was again asked
to appear before the inquisitors of the
county, and he, too, broke the silence
which he had maintained yesterday.
He corroborated Mrs. Scully's testi
mony in every detail, but reiterated
his statement that he had not seen the
money passed into the hands of W. C.
Krieg. It is p-esumed that his back
was turned at the time Krieg reached
for it.
W. C. Krieg was one of the witnesses
to-day. His testimony vas of a pe
culiar character, though apparently
given in the expectation that the mem
bers of the Grand Jury would believe
it. In an interview had with him on i
the day Mrs. Scully made her afflda- ;
vit Krieg explained the giving of the j
$50 note to him by Mr. and Mrs. Krieg
by saying that the Scullys owed him !
money for work done for them and for ]
borrowed money. When he was be
fore the Grand Jury to-day the only j
entry he could show against the Scul- j
lys was an item for $1 75. He ex- j
plained his inability to establish his j
claims against them for the full
amount of the note by saying that his 'â 
books had been lost, except the ledger, i
and that he did not keep accounts of j
small amounts therein.
This note is said to have been given
to him as part of the $200, the agreed
price for obtaining for Scully a posi
tion on the San Jose police force. This
money or the greater part of it, the
Scullys understood, was to go to Coun
cilmen Krieg and Dittus.
Julius Krieg, one of the accused
Councilmen, was another of the wit
nesses to-day, but he denied that he
had ever been paid any money to vote
for or procure for Scully a place on the
police force. He said that all his efforts
on behalf of Scully were put forth from
pure friendship, as Scully had helped
him make his fight for Councilman.
C. J. Mensing testified that he had
loaned Mrs. Scully $150. At the time she
negotiated the loan, early in Decem
ber, 1896, she told him she wanted the
money to buy her husband a position
on the police force.
T. W. Carroll, commission mer
chant, testified that about a month be
fore Scully was appointed a police
man Mrs. Scully had visited him and
endeavored to obtain a loan from him
of $150, stating that she wanted it to
get her husband appointed by the
Council as an officer. He declined to
make the loan.
The Grand Jury has not concluded its
investigation of this case, and expects
to obtain some new and important tes
timony between now and Wednesday,
when it is to meet again.
TWO WRECKS IN
ALASKAN WATERS
Schooner Admiral Carried
Ashore South of Fort
Wrangel.
Small Tramp Steamship Reported
the Beach Not Far From
Skaguay.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Feb. 19.â The schogner Ad
miral, which sailed from Seattle In Janu
ary, went ashore on the morning of Feb
ruary 9 on Kaskevarot Island, twenty
five miles south of Fort Wrangel. The
schooner was laden with lumber and did
not sink. There were seven men aboard
and five remained on the island, while
Captain Barlow and his brother, both of
Lopez Island, rowed the twenty-five miles
to Fort Wrangel. On Wednesday the tug
Dispatch was engaged to tow the Ad
miral to Wrangel. The lumber will he
sold there. Little hope is entertained that
the hulk of the Admiral can be rebuilt.
Among the passengers on the steamship
City of Seattle to-aay was J. T. Kelly,
who boarded the steamship at Wrangel.
In speaking of the wreck he said:
"At 8 o'clock on the morning of Feb
ruary 9 the jib of the Admiral was car
rled away when twenty-five miles south
of Wrangel. Everything was frozen stiff
and a new jib could not be bent. Tht
.schooner began to drift ashore. Ar.
anchor was put out, but the chain parted
almost immediately and the vessel wai
dashed upon the shore. Her bottom irai
knocked out, but as she was laden with
lumber did not sink. The crew had nc
difficulty in reaching shore."
It has been reported in Juneau by tht
tug Coleman that a steamship about thf
size of the Wolcott is ashore at Batter>
Point, about twelve miles this side ol
Skaguay, near the sand spit light. Tht
p'ramshJp is not the Wolcott, but fs sup
posed to be a tramp vessel. A small sai
boat passed the wreck last Sunday morn
ing and reported it at Skaguay. No in
dication of life was found ashore.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1893.
SETS THE
COUNCIL AT
DEFIANCE
Los Angeles Water
Company Ignores
an Order.
Will Not Supply an In
ventory to the City
Law Makers.
Withholding Data as to Value
of Improvements to
Its Plant.
PEOPLE LOSING PATIENCE.
Expect Officials to Take Some Action
to Check the Corporation's
Arrogance.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 19.â The water
company is not going to comply with
I the resolution adopted by the City
Council requiring â¢ it to give to the
I that body within two weeks a complete
inventory of the property it received
from the city thirty years ago, and
also an inventory of every improve
| ment made since then to the city's
I plant. At the time this resolution was
j adopted The Call predicted that the
! company would not comply with it and
j furnish the desired information, for if
;it did it would be the first time that
i arrogant corporation had ever taken
j recognition of a request or an instruc
tion from the City Council.
The Council notified the water com
pany that if it fails to give this infor
mation the city will take default on
the company's contract. At the same
time it expressed to the company a de
sire that the report be made within
two weeks. The two weeks' limitation
will expire Monday and the question
as to what action the Council should
take will then come up.
The officers of the water company
claim that they are ready and willing
to retire from business, but every over
ture on the part of the city to open ne
gotiations on a business basis for the
acquirement by the municipality of the
company's improvements to .the city's
plant has been ignored. The water
company has refused to take one step
to aid or effect municipal ownership,
its newspaper organs â the Times, Her
ald and Express â have promptly come
to the defense of the corporation and
its supporters in the City Council.
Unless the City Council takes some
very decided action on Monday with
reference to this last request for in
formation and the failure of the water
company to furnish it the sentiment of
the community is going to be at a
white heat.
The people are tired of this con
stant and never-ending refusal of the
water company to do one single thing
to facilitate the carrying out of the
contract whereby the city is to pur
chase the improvements made to its
own plant. They want the Council to
proceed to action, and if the City At
torney will only do some little pilot
ing in the interest of the municipal
ity they feel certain that the water
company can be brought up with a
round turn.
The scheme whereby the people are
to be mulcted in the sum of $2,000,000
in the interest of the water company
has not been abandoned yet.
The Call has given it some knockout
blows, the effect of which the syndi
cated press has not been able to coun
teract; but the corporation and its
newspaper allies are sparring for time
and they hope to give new life to th<;
same old scheme in different form.
The people will have to be ever vigil
ant or they will either be robbed or
municipal ownership will be defeated
altogether.
GENERAL RATE
WAR IN SIGHT
New Tariffs Applied by the
Great Northern and North
ern Pacific.
Chicago Lines, Given No Alternative,
Must Meet the Extensive
Redvictions.
Special Plspatoh to The Call.
CHICAGO, Feb. 19.â Fresh complica
tions were added to the passenger rate
war instituted by the Canadian Pacific
road, by the Duluth. South Shore and At
lantic, a Canadian Pacific line, announc
ing the reduction of rates east-bound
from Duluth and other Lake Superior
points to New York, Boston. Portland.
Maine, Halifax and other points in the
East to about the same basis as thoso
made by the Canadian Pacific west bound.
This will necessitate the meeting of
rates by the Chicago-St. Paul lines. The
Great Northern and the Northern Pacific
also applied the cut rates east-bound from
Seattle and Taeoma and carried the re
ductions through to Chicago, leaving the
Chicago lines no choice in the matter. A
strenuous effort will be made, however,
to keep the reductions out of the Mis
souri River gateways. To do so it will be
necessary for the Missouri lines to go out
of the business entirely from all territory
in which the Canadian Pacific is a com
petitor, and whether they will agree to do
so is doubtful. Even should they be so
minded, the problem will not be entirely
solved, because the reductions through
St. Paul will affect Montana rates, and
they in turn will have a bearing on Ogden
and other Utah rates. It is more prob
able that an all-around rate war will
have to be fought out before the situfition
can be cleared up and restored to normal
conditions.
"King of Alviso" Dead.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 19.â Jules Pelle, a pio

RICHES OF THE BLUE JAY.
Mining Fever Revived in Redding
by the Arrival of Men and
Treasure.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, Feb. 19.â The gold fever
here was revived to-day by the arrival
of the Graves brothers from their fa
mous Blue Jay mine ~srr Coffee Creek
with $16,000 in gold dust. They were
accompanied by Henry Carter, a young
man who is interested in the mine. The
dust weighs sixty-one pounds avoirdu
pois, and is in its native state, Just as
it was taken from the mine. As in the
former strike, the gold was found in
black manganese and has not been sub
jected to any cleaning treatment.
This strike was made in a lower tun
nel, which struck the vein forty feet
below the drift in which the $18,000 |
strike was made last summer. Richard i
Graves, the elder brother, and Henry ;
Carter cleaned up the pocket before
John Graves was apprised of the new i
find. They estimate that besides the i
$16,000 brought down to-day they have
stored in this pocket matter carrying |
gold to the value of $20,000.
The gold brought to Redding to-day !
was taken from a space not over six j
feet in length. From the lower to the :
upper tunnel there is yet forty feet of
stoping, and if it yields anything like
the six feet cleaned up the total amount
will run into hundreds of thousands, j
The lucky owners would not hazard an
approximation of the amount of treas
ure remaining in the untouched ground, I
but they assert there is enough to make '
them all three independently rich.
The gold was on exhibition in the :
Golden Eagle Hotel to-day, and hun- j
dreds of people crowded in all the after- i
noon to get a sight of it. The fortunate J
miners gave everybody a chance to see
it and test its weight, besides good
naturedly answering a crossfire of
questions from every one.
The miners with their treasure board
ed the California express to-night and
will arrive in Sac Francisco to-morrow
morning.
This last find will effectually dispose
of the story That was in circulation last
fall to the effect that the first pocket
of $18,000 was treasure obtained by the
Ruggles brothers in th,e Weaverville
stage holdup, in which "Buck" Mont
gomery, the shotgun messenger, was
shot and killed, and for which the
Ruggles were subsequently lynched in
Redding. The story got into print and \
received wide circulation, but no cred- I
ence was placed in it by people who j
knew the Graves brothers and are ac
quainted with the rich gold fields of
Trinity County.

BANKRUPTCY BILL PASSED.
Voluntary and Involuntary Features
Contained in the House Measure.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19.â After four
days of consideration the House to-day
passed the bankruptcy bill, reported by
the House Committee on Judiciary as a
substitute for the NelÃon bill, passed by
the Senate at the extra session last sum
mer. The bill is known as the Hender
son bill and contains both voluntary and
involuntary features. It is considered
less drastic than the measure passed by
the last House by a vote of 157 to 87. Tha
involuntary feature, however, had been
passed by sixteen majority. To-day a
motion to strike out the involuntary
features was defeated by a majority of
23, the vote standing ayes 108, noes 120.
Eighteen Republicans voted against the
bill and twelve Democrats for it. TbJ
Populists, with one exception voted
agalntt it. Mr. Henderson <R.) ot lowa,

FORM A TRUST
! Gigantic Pool to Control
the Output of the
Klondike.
Syndicate Capitalized at Two
Hundred Million
Dollars.
Hydraulic Power Will Be Substi
tuted for the Present Wasteful
System of Mining.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SKAGUAY, Alaska, Feb. 14, via Se
attle, Feb. 19.â James E. Scoville of
Syracuse, N. V., arrived here yesterday
from Dawson, which place he left on
January 19. Mr. Scoville is the con
tractor for the Yukon Telegraph and
Telephone Syndicate, which has recent
ly been incorporated to construct and
maintain telegraph and telephone lines
in the Klondike region. The first line
built will be between Dawson and
Klondike City, and thereafter a line
will be built from Dawson to Skaguay
or Dyea. The company is controlled
solely by the mine owners of Bonanza
and El Dorado Creek, and the general
manager is Alexander McDougall, the
"Bonanza King."
Mr. Seovllle brings important news
which will have a decided bearing on
the future output of Klondike gold. It
relates to the formation of a gigantic
pool or combine to be known as the
Bonanza-El Dorado Company, capital
ized at $200,000,000, which proposes to
control mining operations in the Klon
dike country. Mr. Scoville says it will
revolutionize the method of mining.
Hydraulic power will be substituted
for the present wasteful and expensive
system and the miner who is unable to
work his claim successfully will be
given an opportunity to sell it to the
trust or syndicate, which will work it
for him at a rate much cheaper than
he could do it himself. The forma
tion of this syndicate, Mr. Scoville
says, will have the effect of reducing
the output next spring quite mate
rially.
Henry Heinrich of San Francisco ar
rived here on Sunday from Big Salmon
River, where he has been prospecting
all winter. Mr. Heinrich says that on
Dry Creek, twelve miles below Big Sal

ties.
Hundreds of people are arriving in
Skaguay on every steamer. It is esti
mated that there are at least 2000 peo
ple scattered along the trail between
Skaguay and the lakes.
Since the shooting of Andrew Mc-
Grath and Deputy Marshal Rowen by

derstanding is that the next man who
makes a "gun play" will hang.
The steamer Elder arrived on Satur
day afternoon with the advance guard
of the Government relief expedition.
To-day the detachment and supplies

PASSENGERS DESERT
THE NORTH PACIFIC.
Declare the Steamship Unseaworthy
and Decline to Risk Their
Lives.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Feb. 19.â
The steamship North Pacific, which ar
rived here yesterday from Seattle en
route to Alaska, is still hero and is ex
pected to remain for some time. Owing
to the rough weather the steamship did
not attempt to cross the Straits of Fuca
until late yesterday, and when half-way
over was forced to put back on account
of the heavy seas which caused the ves
sel to ship large quantities of water. This
morning all but three of the steamship's
crew deserted, and the passengers, who
number 120. decline to proceed further on
this steamship, as they are convinced
that she is not seaworthy.
Fifty of the passeoffera visited Collec
tor Huestis at the United States custom
house this morning in a body and asked
him to not allow the North Pacific to go
to sea. The managers telegraphed to
Seattle for a new crew, which will reach
here to-night. I'nless prevented by the
authorities, the managers assort, they
will start north as soon as the new crew
arrives and the weather moderates, and
that the passengers who do not want to
go can stay behind, but no money will be
refunded.

will be stationed for the purpose of pre
serving order during this season's rush to
the gold fields. Companies B and H, of
the same regiment, which will be sta
tioned at Dyea, will follow in a few days
on the steamer Australia. The Queen car
ried from here 365 passengers. This num
ber will be largely increased at Tacoma.

Sperlal Dispatch to The Call.
CRESCENT CITY, Feb. 19.-Thomas
Van Pelt Sr. was shot and instantly
kllled this morning near his home In
Chetco, Or., by some one in ambush.
The name of his slayer is not yet
known, and but few particulars have
been thus far ascertained.
Van Pelt will be remembered by the
readers of The Call as one of the princi
pals in the Van Pelt-Coolidge feud Borne
months ago, in which A. Coolidge was
killed and W. I. Smith and E. C. Hughes
wounded. Thomas Van Pelt, with five
sons, and Hughes, a son-in-law, were but
recently released on bonds of $500 each
from custody at Gold Beach, the courity
seat of Curry County, where they were
under indictment for the murder of Ai
Coolidge, and, as the Coolidges, or at
least all of them considered as combat
ants, have removed to Silverton, Or., it
was hoped there would be no further
demonstration of violence. Now that the
feud is again under way more bloodshed
is expected.

Explosion Imminent in
the West African
Country.
Salisbury's Concessions Alone
Have Prevented Breach
of Peace.
English Army Officers and Munitions
of War Sent to the Scene
of the Trouble.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Feb. 19.â The danger of
leaving explosives about, in the shape
of armed bands roaming in disputed
spheres under youthful officers, has
been amply illustrated in West Africa,
where the intermingling of French and
British troops have already caused in
cidents which threaten the most grave
complications. Happily, the positive
instructions of both Governments have
thus far been obeyed and an actual
collision has been averted. But the
fuse is lighted, and unless France with
draws from her provocative attitude,
or Great Britain continues the grace
ful-concession policy she has hitherto
observed toward the French claims, an
explosion is bound to follow.
Some explanation of the attitude of
France may be found in the desire of
its Government to turn French minds
from the inquisition that Zola has pro
voked, while it must not be forgotten
that the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
M. Hanotaux, bears upon his shoulders
the burden of elections close at hand,
and has to face the threatenings of the
colonial party to swamp the Govern
ment if it shows the faintest sign of
yielding.
Next week the supplementary esti
mate of Â£150,000 for the West African
expenses will be presented to the House
of Commons, and an interesting debate
may be expected.
Probably the most vital point is not
the possession of territory, but the
freedom of commerce. Where the
French have occupied the Hinterland
of British coast colonies the latter
have been shut out from interior trade.
In the present instance the control of
the Niger and the free navigation of
that great waterway as an avenue of
trade for the world is at stake.
Another batch of thirty-six British
officers and non-commissioned officers
sailed to-day for West Africa, accom
panied by immense quantities of war
munitions. This critical situation, on
top of the numerous pending serious
questions, has rearoused apprehen
sions as to whether the Marquis of
Salisbury is inclined to unduly sacri
fice the Interests of the empire.

orange blossoms was visited to-day by
over 500 of Mendocino County's leading
residents, who came to inspect the
beauties of the Citrus Fair. This was
the red letter day of the fair. One hun

was rendered this afternoon and to
night by the Ukiah Glee Club and the
Cloverdale band.
The pavilion was filled to overflowing
to-night. The speech of Hon. Thomas

Feb. 19.â 1t cannot be ascertained here
how many passengers were on the steam

twenty or more passengers are known (to

Pheasants Around Aptos.
SANTA CRTJZ, Feb. 19.â Two years ago
a number of beautiful Chinese pheasants
were released on Spreckels' Aptos ranch,
near Santa Cruz. In this short time they
have increased rapidly and a great many
are in the woods about Aptos and they
are as much at home as in their native
country. A law against killing them Is
enforced.GRAND JURY
AGAINST BOXING
City Fathers Informed the
Practice Is Not
Legal.
Supervisor Delany Voices Gen
eral Street Comment in
a Defense.
National Club Men Assert That the
August Body 16 Mistakenâ New
Jersey Opinion.
"Professor" Billy Jordan says, "Oh,
this makes me weary," his character
istic expression when something hard
bumps up against the Jordanic fad.
J. J. Groom and J. D. Gibbs talk sooth
ing syrup and plenty of it. Chairman
Delany of the Health and Police Com
mittee protests that everything is "all
ripht" and some people are laboring
undt-r a strong delusion.
All this talk is caused by the fact j
that the Grand Jury has decided that i
the board should issue no more permits i
for prize fights. Here is what the
Grand Jury says in an address issued j
to the Supervisors yesterday:
The Grand Jury has carefully consid- i
ered the matter of the alleged "boxing I
contests," which are of such frequent oc- j
currence in this city, and has arrived at ;
the conclusion that such exhibitions have
a demoralizing influence upon the youth
of the community.
Your honorable board has been author- '
lzing test contests under the sanction ofl
an ordinance, No. 1534, which allows in
certain cases permits to be issued to so
called athletic clubs for the purpose of
matching prize-fighters and distributing
to them a given percentage of the re
celpts.
The honorable District Attorney states
that these so-called boxing matches are
Bimply disguised prize-fights, and as such '
are squarely within the prohibition of the
Penal Code, and as they are per se ille
gal you cannot by ordinance legalize that
which is intrinsically illegal and forbid
den by the Penal Code of the State.
The Grand Jury believes that it is only
necessary to thus call your attention to
this matter to induce your honorable
board to Issue no further permits for this
degrading form of sport. Respectfully,
for the Grand Jury,
A. GERBERDIXG, Foreman.
ARTHUR F. PRICE. Secretary.
"The board has never violated the
law in this matter," said Delany.
"We have issued permits for boxing
contests pure and simple. Xo <Jis
guised prize-fights or any other kind
have occurred in this city since this
board took office. The police are al
ways at the ringside and if a contest
develops into a fight it is their duty
to stop it. The public is in favor of
these contests, as is shown by the fact
that the best and most influential citi
zens of the community are always tv
be found at them. These contests are
not brutal nor degrading, and we claim
in common with the best of legal ad
vice that they are not against the law.
Until it is shown that they are, no at
tention will be paid to the Grand
Jury's ukase."
Messrs. Gi'obs and Groom both state
that they have, never held any contest
in violation of the law and are willing
to cease their endeavors when it is
shown that they are illegal. The com
mon .street talk is in favor of this view.
An interesting fact in this connection
is a recent decision of a New Jersey
Grand Jury that boxing contests are
not a violation of the law. The New
Jersey and the California laws are
about the same on this subject.

views as to the policy to be pursued
should there be any resistance to the ex

It was maintained that tho members

that opposition to their authority would

FOLLOWING THE CALL.
BY the vigor of its energies in distributing the ex
citing news of the events following the de
struction of the Maine The Call has not only
shown enterprise itself, but is likely to prove the |
cause of enterprise in others. The morning contem
poraries of The Call in this city must follow the
course set and strive to keep pace with it or abandon
the field. In this case, if they shall choose to follow j
they will choose wisely.
Such is the popular excitement prevailing at the
time over the situation in Havana that a prompter
distribution than usual of the news of the day is
something of a public necessity. The Call at once
recognized the demand of the people and set about
supplying it without any flourish of trumpets or self
laudation. It ran special trains from San Francisco
to Monterey, Sacramento. Woodland, Marysville,
Fresno and all intermediate points as a matter of
course, without preliminary announcement, and has
been well satisfied with the appreciation of the service
shown by the people. In every instance all the copies
of The Call sent out on these special trains were
promptly bought up, and the communities supplied
with them have evinced no little gratification at the
manner in which their desire for the latest and most
reliable news has been satisfied.
It will be of little advantage to our contemporaries,
however, to imitate The Call in running special trains
unless they can also imitate it in giving all the news
and giving it accurately. This, with their present
means of obtaining news, they are unable to do, for
the alliance of The Call with the New York Herald
give? it all the Cuban and foreign dispatches of that
great journal, and these are the fullest and most re
liable known to journalism.
The Examiner, it is true, in its efforts to keep up
with the news service of The Call, stopped its press !
on Friday morning in order to issue a later edition
in which it published a story stolen from The Call and
the Herald. For that offense, however, it may have
to answer in court for violation of copyright, and at
any rate it will not venture upon such a theft again.
This puts an end to the "enterprise" of that journal,
and it is not to be a rival of The Call in Cuban news
for some time to come, though it may attempt rivalry
in rapidity of distribution.
In the meantime, whether its course is followed or
the field abandoned by its contemporaries, The Call
will go forward on its way in the leadership of jour
nalistic enterprise on this coast. It has not engaged
in these undertakings with any thought of eclipsing
rivals. Its one aim has been to give the people of
California the best, promptest and most reliable news
service they have ever had. Whatever is necessary to
accomplish that will be done. The Call will be always
the most accurate in the collection of news and fore
most in distributing it by bulletins and by trains.
It would be a little tough for miners having to con
tend with evenings several months in length not to
have the privilege of whiling away a week or two be
fore bedtime at a game of cards. Senator Hoar's idea
of forbidding gambling in Alaska may be based on a
shining set of morals, but there is no particular util
ity in letting it get into a law. The only effect would
be to add zest to the games, and Hv the good man
would not desire to do this.
A man charged with feloniously pulling the treas
ured whiskers of his employer is to be brought before
Judge Campbell. If he fails to secure a change of
venue he will be trifling with fate. There is no doubt
but Campbell would search the code for the severest
penalty and be disappointed if he did not find there
some provision for hanging the wretch.
Why should not Spring Valley pay the salaries of '
its Supervisors? Of course such a plan could only
be defended, and perhaps not even then successfully,
if the Supervisors would consent to serve without
pay so far as the city is concerned. The laborer is
worthy of his hire, but the man whom he works for
ought to pay him.
Since Senator Merrill has declared against the an
nexation of Hawaii there is a natural curiosity to
know what names the Dole organs will find to apply
to him. He has been reckoned a very worthy old
gentleman.
Sacramento's new Chief of Police seems to think
that he was put in his position for the purpose of en
forcing the laws. People in the capital city natur
ally regard this view as unique.
It is not consistent to blame the Japanese for not

PEfJCE WITH HONOR.
DISRAELI, happy phrase-maker as he was,
never coined a term more fittingly expressive
than "Peace with honor." A nation crowned
with peace won and sustained by honor, secure in the
devotion of its people, has naught to fear. But peace
and dishonor cannot abide in unity. It is well to re
member this when the national integrity is assailed.
It is well to understand the lesson of history which
teaches that the waning of patriotism which comes
when the standard of honor is lowered is the
beginning of decay in empire and republic.
The Government of the United States believes in
peace, but if it seek to keep this at the expense of
honor the attempt will be futile. The present crisis
with Spain calls for wise statesmanship, and wise
statesmanship will never lay honor aside in the hope
of peace. When statesmanship shall do this the prin
ciples knitting this people together will have been for-
gotten or thrust aside. The administration should
present a firm and dignified front. It should, espe
cially if suspicions of Spanish treachery be confirmed,
demand the most abject and sweeping apology, the
completest reparation. Having stated its ultimatum,
there ought to be no compromise and no delay. And
in weighing the possibilities of the situation the scales
of Wall street with their balance of gold must not be
employed. The subject is one not to be measured in
dollars and cents.
Of course we could not fight a nation on its knees
and begging for mercy, however ill-deserved. But in
any position less abject Spain will be regarded as an
enemy and the people of the United States will de
mand an appeal to arms. For decades they have seen
the national honor assailed, for decades they have
borne it. They feel that the limit has been reached.
If Spain fail to take warning she will prescribe her
own fate and will go down to ruin, the last vestige ol
her power swept away and nothing of her left on this
continent, which her presence disgraces, save the
memory of decades of violence, misrule and crimes
long unpunished. No maudlin feeling of sympathy
can check the sentiment that Spain must fall to her
knees or before the thunder of American cannon flee
back to her Castilian hills.
0 DAY OF MOURNING.
GOVERNOR BUDD, acting upon a suggestion
of The Call and in accord with the sen
timents and sympathies of the people, has is
sued a proclamation requesting citizens and direct
ing officers in charge of State buildings and armories
to place the flag at half-mast on Monday out of re
spect to the memory of the officers and men of the
Maine who lost their lives by the dread catastrophe
in Havana harbor.
It is altogether right and fitting that the proclama
tion should have been issued, and it is to be hoped
the response to it will be universal throughout the
confines of the commonwealth. A tragedy of this
kind partakes of the nature of a national calamity.
It affects not merely the homes that have suffered
the loss of a loved one, but the people at large. Every
home has been stricken by it. There is mourning
in every household of the republic. It is appropriate,
therefore, that the expression of sorrow should have
some public and official expression from the State
and from the community as a whole.
Whether the Maine was destroyed by Spanish
treachery or by some accident as unaccountable as
terrible, it is nevertheless true that the bravt men
who perished by the explosion or were drowned by
the inrush of waters upon the sinking ship died at
their post of duty defenders of the flag as truly as if
they had fallen gloriously fighting an open foe in
some fierce sea battle that would live in history for
ever. Honor is due to the brave who die for their
country, no matter at what hour nor in what way
death may claim them, and such honor as the living
can give the dead we owe to the heroes who went
down with the Maine.
It is gratifying to note that in all parts of the Union
public sympathy throbs as one heart in the presence
of this calamity to valor and patriotism. Congress
has been prompt to act for the people in providing
means for as much relief as is possible and for show
ing public honors where relief is unavailable. Sena
tor Bacon of Georgia, himself once in arms against
the Union, has moved in the Senate for the erection
in the Capitol of a bronze tablet inscribed with the
names of the officers and men who perished in the
catastrophe. That tablet will transmit to posterity
the names of the heroic dead and will attest the
gratitude of the republic to the memory of those who
meet death in her service.
While the National Government is thus preparing
for relief and honor for the wounded and the dead
California will make a public manifestation of her
share in the national sorrow by observing the day
of mourning set apart by the Governor. Let every
citizen observe it, and to-morrow let every flag
from public building or from private residence float
at half-mast in memory of the heroic dead.
BOODLING AT SAN JOSE.
AS a result of one of The Call's recent expo
sures of official corruption we are just now
being treated to some curious boodle develop
ment- at San Jose. A few days ago a woman named
Satlli n.ade an affidavit for The Call's correspondent
h she charged a politician named Krieg with
procuring an appointment upon the police force for
her husband for the sum of $200. In this affidavit
she related all the circumstances of the transaction.
A part of the money was paid down and the re
mainder was represented by a note given by Mr. and
Mrs. Scully. The motive of the woman was to get
revenge upon her husband who had deserted her and
the politician who had refused to relieve her poverty.
In due time the Grand Jury took up the case and
began an investigation. There were so many wit
nesses to corroborate Mrs. Scully that the jury
seemed to have what is known in boodle circles at
San Jose as a "lead pipe cinch." But much to the
surprise of everybody concerned, when Mrs. Scully
was called to testify on Friday she declined to answer
a single question. As the wife of Policeman Scully
she took refuge under her legal privilege to refuse to
give evidence against him. All efforts to obtain in
formation from her signally failed.
We are, however, left in little or no doubt as to the
cause of her dumbness. Politician Krieg and his
brother, the Councilman, who negotiated the trans
action, and other Coundlmen whom she accused c\
dividing the money, have prevailed upon Mrs. Scully
to close her lips. Whether they have actually "fixed"
her or have terrorized her will have to be ascertained
later on. Fortunately there is sufficient evidence to
convict the perpetrators without her testimony, but
of course the operation will be more difficult.
The affair illustrates the difficulties which beset
grand juries in prosecuting this character of crime.
The boodlers who engage in it always possess in
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1898.
fluence. Their "pulls" extend throughout the gov
ernment, and responsible men holding the highest
positions are often prevailed upon to come to their
rescue in response to personal, family or social soli
citation. It is easy to prosecute and convict an em
bezzler, a larcenist, a burglar or a murderer, but it
is always difficult to even indict a political boodler.
However, the Grand Jury of San Jose has a chance
to make a record. It is to be hoped that it will do its
duty. <
CLOVERDALE is well named. There may be
some doubt about the appropriateness of the
"dale," since from the prevailing prosperity in
the vicinity the place seems to be on rising ground,
but there can be no question about the clover. The
people are living in it. Not literal clover, perhaps,
which is generally of the three-leaved kind and flour
ishes only for a season, but the beautiful immortal
four-leaved clover of metaphor, which proverb and
poetry have long since made the synonym of all that
is delightful and blissful in human life.
It has been a dry winter over California. It has
been a season of frosts and cold spells of abnormal
intensity and duration. Cloverdale apparently has
known nothing of these evils. There have been mur
murs, complaints, prayers for rain and some swearing
perhaps in many localities, but none in Cloverdale.
If they have prayed it has been for oil and wine
and not for water. If they have murmured it has
been only of love. If they have complained it has
been but an expression of impatience with some
crumpled roseleaf that mars the perfect beauty of
their gardens, and if they have sworn it has been
only at the Spaniard or some other villainy far off.
for there is nothing nearer home to swear at.
Such is Cloverdale as it shows itself to the public
in the glory of its midwinter fair. There may be
some details of life in the place which are not quite
so agreeable to the senses as those described, but if
so they are kept in the back yards or up the sleeves
of the people. So far as the visitor sees or hears at
the exposition Cloverdale is all that we have pictured
and her people are all right. Regarding their citrus
groves as an El Dorado, they look upon the Klon
dike as a barren region, and when they hear of a rush
to Dawson they marvel in amazement. "What fools
these mortals be."
In all seriousness, the proofs of prosperity ex
hibited at the Cloverdale fair are among the notable
things of the year. The bad season has apparently
blighted not a single hope of the industrious or
chardists of the county, and all other industries have
made an equally prosperous showing. The fair is
therefore an event of which much should be made.
It is one of the most striking object lessons we can
possibly give Eastern people of the richness of our
soil, the geniality of our climate, the variety of our
products and the wide extent of territory within the
State adapted to the profitable cultivation of fruits
for which humanity has an almost unlimited demand.
Congratulations are due to Cloverdale and to the
men of leading who arranged and conducted the fair.
A notable success has been achieved for the com
munity, and it can hardly be doubted that the un
mistakable proofs thus given of the advantages of
the locality will attract the attention of home seekers
and investors and speed the time when every acre of
Sonoma will be cultivated, when Cloverdale itself
shall be a city of national note, and the fame of its
fruit and wine and midsummer festival be as wide as
the continent and as poptifar as the metaphorical
clover in which all wish to live.
AMERICAN ship-owners on the Pacific Coast
are to be congratulate! on the prompt passage
by the House of the amended navigation bill,
and it is to be hoped the Senate will be equally ex
peditious in acting upon it. so that the disputed
points of coast navigation under the present law may
be settled beyond all doubting.
The need of amendment was occasioned by the en
larged demand for trade and transportation to
Alaskan ports. It appears that under the present law
a question had been raised whether American goods
shipped to the British port of Victoria, there placed
upon British vessels and carried to Alaskan ports,
w.'re shipped in accordance with our laws or in vio
lation of them. The Treasury Department has ruled
that such shipments are a violation of the law, but it
seems the statute is not explicit on the point, and
on the recommendation of Secretary Gage the
amendment just adopted by the House was proposed.
Being thus framed for the express purpose of
meeting the new conditions raised by the Alaskan
trade, the amended bill, it is said, will amply protect
the American coasting trade from foreign competi
tion. It explicitly declares that the coasting trade
between Alaska and the rest of the United States
shall be reserved exclusively for American ships, and
covers the whole voyage, and not a portion of it
merely.
If American goods could be shipped to Victoria
from ports along the Sound and there placed in Brit
ish vessels and so carried the long journey to the
mocth of the Yukon or the Stickeen, the British
would have by far the best of the bargain. The dis
tance from the Sound cities to Victoria is very little,
and but a small fleet of boats would be required to
handle the goods shipped from them to the British
port, while a considerable voyage would then be ne
cessary to take them to any point in Alaska.
The change made to strengthen and make more ex
plicit the intention of the law to protect American
shipping in the possession of the coasting trade of
the country for the whole voyage between any Amer
ican ports constitutes the main feature of the amend
ment. Another feature of note in the measure, how
ever, is a clause raising from $100 to $200 the penalty
for each instance of a foreign vessel transporting a
passenger between ports or places in the United
States, either directly or via a foreign port.
The amended bill is in fact a step in the right di
rection taken at the right time. It might have proven
disastrous to have left these issues in doubt to be set
tled by the courts, under the present law. It is grati
fying to note that the bill was passed without a divi
sion. Its importance was recognized by men of all
parties, and this gives reason for the hope that even
the slow-moving Senate will make prompt work in
passing it.
It was real good of the St. James Gazette to con
cede that this country is not seeking a quarrel. It
might have remarked that Â«t almost any time during
the last two years this country had been chiefly en
gaged in turning the othqr cheek.
Once more the police are aroused to the evil con
stituted by the nickel-in-the-slot machines, but all
they seem able to do about it Js to express commend
able and ineffective regrets.
LIVING IN CLOVER.
THE NAVIGATION BILL
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
Several ladies have done me the
honor to write concerning an article in
this column last week. The article
was based upon the statement of a
minister that prayer as an institution
was dying out. With evident intent
to take exception to my expressions
one lady asserts that I am a worm of
the dust, which is possibly true. A
proper spirit of humility forces accept
ance of the idea that we are all worms
of the dust, even the lady herself ne*
cessarily coming under this rule. But
as there are grades among worms, gal

Compliments to the Rev. W. T.
Thurston of Boston, and will the gen
tleman explain why he chooses to chat
ter with the intelligence marking
the request of a parrot for a cracker?
Recently Boston was visited by a
storm which did much property dam
age and resulted in some loss of life.
Thurston announced that the storm
was a visitation, due to the fact that
wickedness existed and that it was in
tended as a call to repentance. In other
words, the Heavenly Father whose
goodness it is the Thurston duty to
make clear to sinners fined some of
his subjects and killed others in order
that they might turn from the error
of their ways, although of course the
ones executed did not have much
chance in this direction. Probably
Thurston did not realize that he was
ascribing to the Almighty traits of
meanness which he would rightfully
feel insulted to have ascribed to him
self. In the friendliest spirit I would
counsel him to devote more time to
thinking and less to expressing an ab
sence of thought.

In common with every other citizen
who has gas bills to pay, I take the
liberty of wishing the projected com
petitor the most complete success. To
openly express such a wish Is to Invite
the active meter to a livelier gait. The
gas furnished In this city cannot prop
erly be termed an illuminant. It is
merely a questionable substitute for
darkness. As to the quality of the
dim religious light it assumes to throw
off, a comparison with any self
respecting kerosene lamp would be an
Insult to the lamp. But the utter dis
regard for the rights of patjons is the
main point of grievance. People can
grow accustomed to groping in the
gloom, but they never learn to love to
pay a high price for bad gas they do
not burn. I cannot believe myself to
have been singled out by a mighty cor
poration to be robbed, and therefore
reach the conclusion that the aggre
gate stealings of the gas outfit would
in themselves constitute an imposing
dividend. It is only candid to state
that the size of my monthly bill has
little to do with the amount of gas
used. Once, seized of the spirit of
economy, we provided lamps, and for
thirty days burned them almost ex
clusively, it is safe to say not using
more than one-tenth the gas that we
had the thirtj' days just before. The
bill came promptly. It was higher
than ever. No explanation would be
received at the office. Then the lamps
were discarded, and for thirty days
more the household devoted itself to
the consumption of all the gas possible,
this by way of experiment. The next
bill was a trifle less. I have been
pained to notice that the absence of
the family for three weeks out of a
month had absolutely no effect upon
the size of the bill. Now, if this is
not stealing, what is it? One who has
been victimized for years has a nat
ural curiosity to know how common
the practice is. For myself Ido not
believe that a reduction to Jl.a thou
sand by the present concern would not
be of the slightest benefit to consumers.
The meters would simply be keyed up
to concert pitch, and reach the figures
they attain now with irritating and
never-failing ease.

when the Tacoma News takes a pic
ture from The Call, representing a
wharf scene in San Francisco, and
publishes it as representing a similar
scene in Tacoma. Yet it is always
better taste in instances of this sort
of enterprise to eliminate the name of

There has never been in Journalism
a more cruel and silly display than
Hearst is making of himself. If the
man has not gone daft he must
by thia time feel within his being the
unwonted emotion of shame. His offer
of $50,000 for the apprehension of the
person who caused the wreck of the
Maine was not only brutal, but vulgar
beyond all expression. He knew there
was no more possibility of obtaining an
"exclusive" explanation of the tragedy
than there would have been of having
an "exclusive" account of a total
eclipse. The proposition was a boorish
bid for cheap advertising, nothing
more. To make capital of the nation's
murdered dead, to attract attention
even at the cost of donning cap and
bells, to take the lead of the Govern
ment in a matter in which interference
could only be an Impertinence â all
these ignoble ambitions crystallized in
to the $50,000 insult to the intelligence
of the country and the world. Once,
for Hearst to have been guilty of this
would have caused surprise. To be
able to accuse him of dense stupidity
and convict him shows a recent de
velopment In his process of degener
acy. To be so utterly devoid alike of
humor and humane sentiment leaves
Hearst with several essential traits
i lacking. There is such a thing as
grim humor, but this ridiculous offer
is not due to a recognition of the fact.
Humor may be grim, but an ebulli
: tion of heartlessness as somber as the

sence of soul, a shock to decency and
lan exhibition of sordid and callous

It must remain a puzzle to people
outside of official life why diplomats
place so much reliance upon the ef
ficacy of lying. They lie when, accord
ing to judgment untrained in the art
of misrepresentation, the truth would
seem to better serve the purpose. Re
cently orders were received at this
point for the troops stationed here to
exercise extra precautions, to double
the ordinary guard, and otherwise be
prepared for the emergency of war. A
natural interest was felt in the matter,
and inquiry elicited the information
that such orders were being acted
upon. No copy of the telegram could
be procured from a local source, and a
request was sent to Washington for a
copy. The War Department did not
in a dignified manner decline to make
public its acts, but simply sought ref
uge in a tangle of falsehood. The As
sistant Secretary, who was in charge,
declared that no such orders had been
sent, and yet he knew they had been,
and had spurred the army to notice
able activity. I would like to be in
formed as to what Meiklejohn thought
he was accomplishing by this subter
fuge beyond making clear the fact that
his word is not worth the breath ex

Mr. Roosevelt of the navy has been
charged with indiscretion. It appears
that he was guilty. He forgot for a
time that the citizens of the United
States have no right to display interest
in public affairs, and that an inÃult to
the flag is a matter concerning alone
the officers of the Government. During
this reprehensible period of absent
mindedness he expressed his opinion
freely. Of course his superiors rebuked
him, and now the penitent Roosevelt
is both lamblike and clamlike, an honor

Probably the Congressman who pro
poses to have the letter J eliminated
from the alphabet desires to cripple
the critics who have been endeavoring
to properly characterize him.
In a recent number of The Call there
was an account of the disappearance
from England of Arthur Percival and
the cheering information that a for
tune awaits him there. From the same
number it was learned that Arthur
Percival was sick with the grip in
Lodi. Perhaps there are two Arthurs
Percival, but anyhow I would advise
the Lodi gentleman to shake off his
case of grip forthwith and make as
strong a bluff as possible.
If to be indignant when the country
is affronted, to feel the impulse of re
sentment when the flag is trampled
upon and the national honor assailed,
is to be a "jingo," the term, applied in
contempt, is one in which the citiezn
meriting It may justly take pride. The
man meekly turning the other cheek
after having been smitten on the first
deserves to be whacked so hard that
a shower of stars will suddenly illumi
nate his intelligence. He is a despica
ble character. Failing to defend him
self, he proves that he is a coward. I
do not see that a nation stands on a
different moral plane. It is inconceiv
able that the United States can find a
pretext for submitting to further indig
nities from Spain. Because this nation
is bigger and stronger than Spain does
not constitute a reason why a series of
crimes should be allowed to drag out
its bloody length unpunished and unre
buked. For more than half a century
the Castilian has openly hated the
American. No opportunity to show
this has been neglected. When there
was no chance to assassinate Ameri
cans or to seize their property, expres
sions of invective have filled the press
of Madrid and the people of the rot
ting monarchy been ever kept alive to
the duty of holding all things Ameri
can in abhorrence. Patience has not
only ceased to be a virtue but has be
come a crime. The United States has
held aloof while Spain, almost under
the shadow of the banners of freedom,
has wantonly butchered, starved, rob
bed and outraged men and women. It
Is shameful that this can be said as
truly of the present Cuban war as dur
ing the long one when the Americans
of the Virginius were marched out for
slaughter, and the howling populace
spat upon their dead bodies. A de
mand that Spain be taught a lesson
does not necessarily mean war, but if
it does, the lesson should be given just
the same; to do otherwise were a re
proach and a disgrace. Whether the
Maine was deliberately wrecked is not
the one vital point. The fact that the
Spanish have assumed the privilege of
ascribing to us an inferiority, taken
the right to malign us, and suffered no
correction, thus degrading us in the
eyes of all nationsâ for not another
nation on earth would have borne a
j hundredth part as much; the fact that
I Spain has established her shambles at
our very doors and defies us to stay
her handâ these make up vital points
as well. President McKinley's duty is
plain. It is to turn Spain out of Cuba
now. A timid suggestion is not enough.
There should be an order, quick, final
and backed by the whole force at the
command of the President. So far as
this country is concerned, there is
nothing to be compromised, no apol
ogies to be accepted; only the simple
course of telling Spain to go from the
hemisphere her presence stains, and
making her go. But perhaps this is
jingoism.
In an experience of several years in
| newspaper work I have never come in
contact with an episode more dramatic
than that furnished by J. J. Livernash.
He wrote an account of his own sui
cide, sold it without in any way reveal
ing its nature, and then followed to
the most minute detail the plan he had
outlined. I am unable to summon up
a great respect for the average suicide,
and am ready to believe generally that
insanity guides him. Yet a man wha
stands at the border of eternity intu
which he has elected to pass and de
nounces Andy Lawrence as a scoundrel
cannot in Justice be called crazy. t
hope Livernash will rest well in tha
grave he sought. A failure in life, per
haps death may introduce him to con
ditions more kindly. But I .hope als.i
that no idiot with but the faculty o|
imitation left will undertake to follow"
his example. The hero of the most dra-.
matic suicide is soon forgotten, and a,
majority of those who take the trouble
to regard him at all will regard him aa
a fool.

The police of this city need instruc
tion in morals and manners. Perhaps
to volunteer it is no part of my busi
ness, and yet if they read here any
thing tending to make them gentle
men and proper officers, they are more
than welcome. I do not understand
the police privilege of assuming to be
superior to the law-abiding citizen. If
a passer-by happens to pause to rea>i
a bulletin board it seems to me arro
gance on the part of the police to or
der him to "move on." The pavements
are free to all. I have noticed with,
regret the police tendency to be hog
gish and dictatorial, the regret aris
ing from the fact that the average pa
trolman weighs more than I do and
that protest would only result in a.
losing fight. But with tolerable safe
ty I may seek information. I would
like to know by what right the police
put supposed offenders in jail, keep
i them there as long as convenient and
| then turn them loose, no charge hav
ing been made. Such conduct would
not be permitted in Russia, but in San
Francisco it is common, and I have
never heard of a policeman being licked
for it yet, a plain neglect of duty. But
when, in an excess of zeal, a police
man arrests somebody who may be
supposed to have a pull, the haste to
turn him loose again is almost pathetic.
Now, nobody should be conceded , U
have a pull. If it is' rigrht to put Tom
in jail for a fancied offense, it is right
to put Dick there, and Harry is no
better. But Dick and Harry, armed
with a pull, have only to display their
cards and they are told to go and
please to forget the incident and the
mistake is much regretted, etc. I
would make a plea for Tom, who doea
not carry a card, and also I would fira
the guilty policeman.

"Wholesale Kidnaping
in the Chinese
Quarter.
"Women Stolen and Then
Shipped to the
Country.
A Reward of $1000 Offered for
the Arrest of Each of
the Abductors.
CHIEF LEES IS CONSULTED
He Has Detailed Several Men to
Apprehend and Arrest the
Bold Gang.
The respectable residents of the Chi
nese quarter are greatly alarmed over
the wholesale kidnaping of Chinese
â women. During the past week no less
than eight women have been stolen by
highbinders and spirited out of the city.
Last night the Chinese Consul visited
police headquarters and invoked the
aid of Chief Lees in apprehending the
kidnapers.
He intends to-day to offer a reward
of (1060 for the arrest of each high
binder who had a hand in stealing the
women. According to his story, several
highbinders have banded together for
th-e purpose of supplying the Chinese in
other portions of the State with female
slaves. It is claimed that they receive
$200 for each woman they kidnap.
Last Saturday a highbinder, who is
the ringleader, visited a den inhabited
by Chinese women and asked the wo
man who was in charge to allow him to
take one of the inmates to the theater.
Not suspecting that he intended to
steal her, the woman allowed him to
take the girl, with the understanding
that he was to return with her immedi
iit.iy after the performance was over.
After waiting until nearly 2 o'clock in
the morning, and still no tidings of the
girl, the woman became alarmed and
informed Sergeant Shea.
H>- made an investigation, and
learned that after leaving the house the
Chinaman took the unsuspecting vic
tim to a friend's house, where she was
drugged.
Before daylight, and while the unfor
tunate woman was still stupid, her ab
ductor took her to Oakland, where she
was turned over to another member of
The gang. Since then she has not been
Eeen.
The police are satisfied that her ab
ductors sold her to some Chinese who
lives in the interior of the State.
Several days ago the gang managed
to pÂ°: hold of a rather attractive slave
-tarted with her for their head
quarters.
â¢ <n the way her owner saw them, and,
suspecting that they intended to dis-
I ac <">f her, he asked them to release
her. A fight ensued, and as the owner
of the girl was vtlliantly struggling to
set possession of her Sergeant Chris
:ansen appeared on the scene.
After listening to their contradictory

MAY SING IN OPERA.
William McDonald, the Grace
Church Basso, Asked to Join
the Bostonians.
William McDonald, the "man with the
wonderful bass." has been requested by
the management of the 8.-stonians to con
sider an offer to join the company as un
derstudy to Eugene Cowles.
Mr McDonald first attracted the atten
tion of the musical world when he used to
sing while plying his trade of blacksmith
at his forge in Santa Rosa. He was per
suaded to give up his trade and come to
the city, which he did some time ago.
placing himself in the hands of Frank
Coffin to have his voice fully cultivated.
So well has Mr. Coffin succeeded with the
excellent material he had to work on that
the Bostonians anxious to obtain so val
uable an acquisition to their company
have made Mr. McDonald a very flatter
ing offer, which he now has under con
sideration and to which he will give a
final answer in a day or two.
When Eugene Cowles leaves the com
pany at the end of the present season to
Join Wire Nielsen in the new opera Thom
as H. Williams is having written for her
Mr McDonald will succeed to his place
as leading basso of the swellest opera
troupe on the boards.
Mr. McDonald has been singing at
Grace Church and in the Press Club Quar
tet for some months i>ast.

THE BAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1898.
THORNTON STAKE
TO JUDGE DENNY
The Black Horse Gained
a Hard-Earned Vic
tory Over Marplot.
Covered the Four Miles in
7:20 3-4, Superbly Rid
den by Thorpe.
MagdalenesTook the Elmwood Stake
From Humidity â Four of the
Favorites Beaten.
Race-goers did not assemble In such
large numbers to see the rich Thorn
ton stake, over four miles, decided as
in former years, still 5000 people must
have journeyed over to Emeryville yes
terday and cheered lustily as Judge
Denny, the black gentleman trained by
Sam Hildreth, defeated Marplot, The
Bachelor and Wawona and pranced
back to the paddock as kittenish as
though he had simply turned off a six
furlong dash. The winner, carrying
115 pounds and piloted with rare Judg
ment by Charley Thorpe, covered the
distance in 7:20%, which compares fa
vorably with Ten Broeck's record of
7:19%.
The big race was the signal for some
lively wagering and the betting indi
cated that the crowd was puzzled as to
the probable outcome. Judge Denny,
coupled with Wawona, held sway !n
the first odds posted at 8 to 5, with 2
to 1 offered against either of the other
two starters. There was scarcely any
change in the betting with the excep
tion that The Bachelor had a slight
call over the others as the horses were
summoned to the poet. The race la
easy of description. Woods on Mar
plot cut out the pace, with The Bache
lor and Denny under wraps not far
behind him. Wawona was dead after
going a mile, and was eased up. Woods
received his orders to cut loose the last
mile, but could not shake off his com
pany. When the stretch was reached
the last time. The Bachelor despite
Willie Martin's vigorous riding had
shot his bolt and was beaten. Thorpe
astride Judge Denny now set full sail
for the three-year-old. A furlong from
the wire it looked as though he could
not get up, but the final sixteenth the
black responded nobly to his rider's
call, and forging to the front won by
two lengths. The Corrigan entry was
forty lengths away. Thorpe was ac
corded an ovation on his return to the
stand, and the Judge wore the floral
horseshoe placed around his neck as
though- well aware of the glory he had
earned. Little Johnny Woods came in
for much praise for his masterly hand
ling of Barney Schrieber's colt. Many
contended that the latter was best, but
beyond peradventure of doubt the
black son of Fonso justly earned his
victory.
The sport throughout the afternoon
was away above the average. Mag
dalenes, a sprightly daughter of Em
peror of Norfolk, downed Humidity for
the Elmwood stake, and three other
warm favorites were tumbled in the
dust. The betting was good, but the
bookies enjoyed a tempestuous day of
it.
"Long-shot" Conley was much in
evidence in the opening six furlong run
with Distinction. The mare was a 3
to-1 choice in the betting, and in a
hard drive the ebony-hued rider
landed her a winner from the 20-to-l
shot Ricardo by a head. Aluminum
was a close third, beaten by a nose.
The miie selling resulted in the de
feat of the red-hot favorite Lincoln II
ridden by Thorpe, which went to the
post 1 to 2. The outsider Highland
Ball made the running to the stretch, '
where Dr. Bernays assumed the lead j
and won easily by seven lengths. Go- !
tobed, a 30-to-l shot, ridden by a stable
lad named Kelly, led the first choice
out for the place.
The Elmwood stake for two-year
olds at four furlongs was considered a
good thing for Humidity, the Burns &
Waterhouse filly. Coupled with Gold
Scratch the pair closed 2-to-5 favorites
in the betting. Royal Fan was first
into the stretch, where Spencer took
the lead with Magfdalenes and she won
under restraint from Humidity. Con
ley on Ranler finished in the show.
The winner went to the post at odds
of 4 to 1.
Ed Gartland, favorite for the six-fur
long handicap, was about the biggest
disappointment of the afternoon. Back
ed down from S to 2 to 9 to 10 the black
colt could not untrack himself and
finished last. Fonsovannah, ridden by
Thorpe, second choice in the betting,
won with apparent ease at the end
from Imperious.
Old Caesarian led his field a merry
chase in the final six furlong run.
Going to the post at odds of 4 to 5 he
led almost from the start, and driving
at the finish led Sly past the stand a
head in 1:14V4.

ROBBED OF
HER DIAMONDS
Daring Burglary in a
House on Van Ness
Avenue.
Mrs. Dunlap Loses the Con
tents of Her Jewel
Case.
Her Room Was Entered With the
Aid of a Skeleton
Key.
A mysterious burglary, which Is puz
zling the police, occurred Friday night
at 232 Van Ness avenue. The victim is
Mrs. Dunlap, who rooms in the house.
While she was eating dinner a thief en
tered the house, and opening the door
of her room searched her apartments,
securing several pieces of Jewelry, val
ued at $500. The theft was not discov
ered uncil Mrs. Dunlap returned to her
room. . She noticed that her jewel case
had been removed from Its accustomed
place, and that the bureau drawers had
been partly opened. A glance at the
jewel case disclosed that the lid had
been forced open and its valuable con
tents taken.
Mrs. Dunlap lost no time in notify
ing Chief Lees, who sent Detectives
Bee and Harper to make an investiga
tion. They found that the burglar had
gained an entrance to Mrs. Dunlap's
apartments with the aid of skeleton
key. How he entered the house is
what puzzles the police. They made a
thorough examination of the premises,
but failed to find anything which would
show how he got in the house.
They are inclined to believe, how
ever, that the thief slipped into the
house through the front door while Mrs.
Dunlap was at dinner.
One of the pieces of Jewelry taken by
the thief was a valuable gold watch
studded with diamonds. Mrs. Dunlap
prized it very highly, as it was given
her by a dear friend. The thief also
secured a diamond ring valued at $150,
a pair of opera glasses and long gold
chain. Last night Mrs. Dunlap visited
police headquarters and furnished the
police with a description of the stolen
property. ___^^^___^__^_
A ONE-SIDED GAME.
Berkeley Defeats the Alumni With
the Greatest Ease.
The Alumni got another throw-down
yesterday at Central Park, and a hard
one at that. In the game with Berkeley
they were simply not In it. In fact, the
exhibition nut up by the Alumni was
about the worst that has ever beemseen
upon a baseball diamond. The game was
long and tiresome, and it was too one
sided to be of any interest.
Berkeley made hits while the Alumni
made errors. In the fifth inning the for
mer scored twelve runs, and after this
the game was a farce. The Alumni could
<!o nothing with Kaarsberg and Sims, who
alternated in the box, while Lichtenberg
was the easiest kind of a mark, and Mc-
I,aine, who succeeded him, was but little
better. â  â " â¢â¢-â¢

THE GOVERNMENT ON THE ALERT
ARE MANNING
THE GUNS AT
NEW YORK
Ready to Blow Any Span
ish Fleet Out of
Water.
Officers Commanding the Depart
ment of the East Deny War
Preparations, but Con
tinue to Prepare.
NEW YORK, Feb. 19.âUn
usual activity has been mani
fested during the last two days
in the forts and fortifications
commanding the entrance to
New York harbor. Reports from
other points on the seacoast
show that similar conditions
have been noticed, and while the
officers in command of the De
partment of the East acknowl
edge that certain steps have
been taken, they declare these
steps have no bearing whatever
on recent developments in the
relations between the United
States and Spain.
These unusual occurrences were
first noticed late on Friday night when
the commandant at Fort Sehuyler re
ceived a telegraphic order from General
Wesley Merritt, commanding the De
partment of the East. Within an hour
of the receipt of the dispatch, Lieuten
ant Lang, commanding a detachment
of twenty men. had started to take
charge of the new batteries at Willetts
Point Lieutenant Lang's command
took their tents and full camp equip
ment with them. Their orders were to
take charge of the new guns and mor
tars recently mounted there, and to see
that they are kept in perfect condition.
Imperative orders were also issued as
to the care of the large quantity of
ammunition which has also been ship
ped to this point.
The batteries at Fort Sehuyler and
Willetts Point command the entrance
to the harbor from Long Island Sound,
and with these batteries fully manned
and equipped it would be very hard
work for an enemy's warship to force
an entrance from that side.
Additional evidence that the War De
partment is on the alert was furnished
to-day when a detachment of artillery
oommanded by Lieutenant Arnold left
Fort "Wadsworth for Sandy Hook,
where they took charge of the recently
completed batteries there. They were
quickly followed by a detachment of
engineers and other branches of the
rerviee, which brought the total garri
son established at Sandy Hook up to
200 men. They also took tents and
camp equipment.
At the same time Fort Wadsworth
was closed to visitors. Even civilians
whose daily associations made it neces
eary for them to enter the fort were
halted half a mile away by the sentries
and ordered to turn back. No one not
a member of the garrison or of the fam
ilies of the officers was allowed to en
ter, and the sentries even refused to
take notes or cards to Colonel Sinclair,
the commandant.
Ammunition in large quantities is
also on the way to Sandy Hook, where
there are sixteen 12-inrh disappearing
guns, four 10-inch guns and two tor
pedo tubes. At Fort Wadsworth part
of the modern armament consists of
four 10-inch breechloading guns and
five 8-inch guns. A shot from the
latter can sink a ship at a distance of
eight miles.
At Governors Island, the headquar
ters of the Department for the East,
it was learned to-day that in addition
to the batteries already manned orders
have been sent to man those at Grovers
Cliff, at the entrance of Boston Har
bor and at Portland Head, at Port
land, Maine. In each instance an or
der has been telegraphed to the near
est post to send a liputenant and
twenty artillerymen to take charge of
the batteries. It was also learned
that an order was to-day sent out from
Governors Island to sixty military
posts, most of them on the AfTantic
seaboard, enjoining the commanders
that the strictest care be exerted to
keep the guns and other equipment at
the utmost pitch of efficiency., and that
every precaution be used to guard the
stores of ' ammunition and provide
against premature explosion or deter
ioration from any cause. Work is
also being pushed rapidly to comple
tion of the new batteries on the small
island at the eastern end of Long Is
land.
These are still In the contractors'
hands, but it was said they would be
finished in a few weeks. Guns and am
munition are all ready for them and
they will be equipped and named just
as soon as finished. Similar rush work
Is being done at Cape Hatteras and
other points on the Atlantic seaboard.
Notwithstanding all this activity,
the officers in command at Governors
Island declare it has no b*arins; at all
on the recent international develop
ments. They speak of it as routine
work which would have been done in
any case.
"The batteries have been completed
and equipped, and we have simply
placed a few men in each to care for
the guns and equipment and keep
them from deteriorating," one officer
said.
When asked, however, if the force
was sufficient to fight the puns, the of
ficer replied: "Oh, yes. The guns are
automatic. You have only to start
thorn going and they work themselves."
Another officer admitted that while
the batteries would have been manned
sooner or later, it was not expected
that this would be done until late in
the spring or summer.
TRACING
THE VAGUE
RUMORS
Continued from Third Page.
then. An hour later I was on my way
to Key West in the Herald's chartered
tug G. W. Childs. Before departing
it came to me from a trustworthy
source that the complications referred
to by Captain Sigsbee had their origin
in Madrid. The Spanish authorities, ac
cording to my informant, fully realize
the position in which they have been
placed by the unexplained explosion of
the Maine. So far there is not the
slightest clew as to the cause of the ex
plosion.
I spent last night in getting hints
that might have led to a solution, but
found no corroborative evidence, no
tangible results. Theories are offered
in plenty, but every one of these save
one will contradict some other.
A naval board of examination, com
posed of Lieutenant-Commander Wain
wright, Lieutenant Holden and Chief
Engineer Howell, has been appointed
by Captain Sigsbee and ordered to
closely examine the wreck and report
their opinions as to the cause of the
explosion. Accompanied by Captain
Sigsbee the board pulled around the
wreck yesterday and closely scruti
nized it. This inspection was, of
course, of a cursory nature and if the
officers formed an opinion they kept it
to themselves.
"This matter* is far too serious for
hasty conclusions," was the grave re
ply to my question as to whether the
inspection had given the officers any
ne\r idea about the accident. As I have
said, there are theories in plenty, and
in the multitude is one that commands
attention/
"I heard It several times last night,
and I heard it again this morning. It
is that the Maine was wrecked by a
submarine mine laid during the days
of Weyler. To appreciate the signifi
cance of hints that have been given me
it is necessary to explain that once
inside of Havana harbor a heavy ship
of war has the city at her mercy. It
is not to be supposed that the Span
iards neglected the opportunity to plant
mines. There could have been no hit
or miss chance about such an opera
ation, for ships entering port do not
anchor, but are escorted to mooring
buoys located .at various places in the
harbor. Thus the Maine was brought
in by the Government pilot and told
what buoy she must tie up to. That
buoy must have also marked the lo
cation of a mine, and other buoys may
serve similar purposes.
"I am convinced that if such was
really the case, and if the Maine was
destroyed by a submarine mine ex
plosion, the act was perpetrated with
out the knowledge of the Spanish au
thorities. It is conceivable that some
fanatic might have discovered the lo
cation of the mines, and its electrical
connection, and set the spark that
caused the wreck.
â¢ I have tried to verify these whispered
things, but yoii can understand how
well nigh impossible it is. I have also
tried to trace the rumor that what I
have described has been the case, that
the secret is in the possesion of several
men and that one of these is making
his way to Washington to tell what he
knows about it. Such is the theory
and rumors that go with it. There is
no positive evidence here to show that
either is true. Nor is it likely that any
convincing evidence of any sort will be
obtained until divers make a report.
The spectacle that the wreck pre
sented yesterday made one sick at
heart to contemplate. Hundreds of car
rion crows were perched upon it, and
the guard boats pulling around could
not keep them away. At intervals a
body or mangled limb would come
floating upward, to be taken in tow
when discovered by boats detailed for
that purpose. One living thing was
found on board the wreck. That was
Tom, the huge black cat that belonged
to the Maine, and which had escaped
death in some miraculous manner. The
cat was found by the boat's crew from
the lighthouse steamer and was taken
on board that vessel.
In the city all precautions are being
taken to guard against any anti-Amer
ican demonstration. General Lee is
being guarded by detectives in civilian
dress and up to last night the General
did not know that he was the subject
of such espionage.
Here are running extracts from a
letter which Captain Sigsbee has writ
ten to his wife and which he kindly
permitted me to take: "So far as lam
able to judge at noon to-day 253 per
sons have been drowned or killed and
101 saved. Merritt, the dead officer, re
ceived help in the blinding darkness
and watery whirl of his quarters by
Naval Cadet Boyd until they were
swept apart. Jenkins, up to his arms
in water, started for his stateroom,
which was in an opposite direction to
the hatch, doubtless to save important
departmental papers, and was drowned.
Of the crew saved only eighteen or
nineteen are uninjured. The explosion
was under the men's compartments."
Captain Slgsbee has had no letter
from his family for three mails. When

the explosion occurred Captain Sigsbee
was sitting at a table In the port cabin
working with Lieutenant Holden on
important official papers. Strange to
say, he was writing concerning tor
pedoes aboard, and, just as he finished,
the disaster came on. Captain Sigsbee
started for the starboard cabin, and
could have got out that way, but,
thinking to better maintain the posi
tion of command, groped his way
through a passage filled with smoke
and falling debris. Here he met Pri
vate Anthony, who reported that the
ship had been blown up and was sink
ing. He stayed by Captain Sigsbee's
side and they climbed to the port deck.
The whole deck was piled high with
tangled wreckage, and nothing could
be clearly distinguished. Only those
who succeeded in reaching the port
deck Mere saved. The officers were cool
and there was perfect discipline.
Everything was referred to Captain
Sigsbee. The lire continued to rage,
and Lieutenant - Commander Wain
wright whispered to Captain Sigsbee
that he feared the forward magazine
had been torn up, and urged him to
leave the ship. Captain Sigsbee de
clined to go until the officers got in the
boats.
ALL HANDS ARE
KEPT AT WORK.
Orders Given for the Rapid Comple
tion of Repairs to the Puri
tan and Terror.
RICHMOND (Va.), Feb. 19.âCommo
dore Farquhar, commander of the
Norfolk navy yard, received orders at
7 o'clock to-night from the Navy De
partment to keep all hands at work
on the Puritan and Terror ta-night and
Sunday, also on the torpedo boats
Foote and Winslow. All these repairs
will be completed by the middle of
next week.
The order to place the Terror in or
dinary was countermanded this morn
ing. Her crew was sent to San Fran
cisco ten days ago, but a telegram says
a crew will be ready for her in a few
days, when she would go to Hampton
Roads to Jiwait further orders.
Fort Monroe with its new mortar
battery a mile up the beach, and its
big rapid-fire rifles and disappearing
carriages beyond the great mountains
of concrete is in better condition for de
fense than ever in its history. Assistant
Secretary Mieklejohn arrived at the
fort last evening, and his visit gave
rise to much speculation. Secretary
Alger has been at Old Point several
days recuperating. It is believed that
Mr. Mieklejohn is here to ascertain by
inspection the condition of the defenses
of this important point.
Richmond's greatest defense is the
narrow channel at Dutch Gap, twelve
miles below the city, where the river
drives through the narrow cut com
menced by General Butler during the
war and finished for commercial pur
poses by the Government engineers
after the war. A barge sunk in this
swiftly flowing, short and narrow
channel would make Richmond safe.
A large number of extra men were put
to work on the cruiser Newark at Nor
folk this morning. It will take three
months under emergency efforts to
complete her. The battleships Kentucky
and Kearsarge will be launched at
Newport News in a few days.

Resolutions Providing for Raising
the Maine Laid Out by the
Mason Amendment.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19.â Nothing
will be done in the House with the
Senate resolution appropriating $200,
000 for the salvage of the wreck of the
Maine, because of the Mason amend
ment to the resolution providing for
the return to the United States of the
bodies taken from the wreck. Secre
tary Long and Captain Sigsbee both
explained that the return of the bodies
will be impracticable, as many of them
were mangled beyond identification,
and, moreover, that there might be
sanitary reasons why bodies from a
fever-infected country should not be
brought to the United States.
Chairman Boutelle, of the House
Naval Committee, said nothing would
be done with the Senate resolution as
he had no doubt the Senate would
promptly pass the House resolution on
Monday
NEW YORK. Feb. 19. â A copyrighted cablegram to the Even
ing "World from Sylvester Scovel, under to-day's date from Havana,
via Key West, says:
"The consensus of opinion of those who have studied the wreck
closely is now that the explosion was caused by a submarine mine.
The forward magazine, it is now generally supposed, is intact, also
the. forward six-inch magazines.
"This leaves only a few saluting charges and a few small-cali
ber shells in the pilot-house which could have possibly have ex
ploded aboarrl the ship.
"At the sam* time, the fearful damage is too big for any but an
extremely largo torpedo. If it were a torpedo, the divers will find
the torpedo fragments; but if it were a submarine mine, no trace
will be found.
"All the American officers are internally boiling. There is not"
one of them, from Captain Sigsbee down, who is not fairly con
vinced a (icvernment submarine mine did it.
"The Spanish dailies are loudly clamoring 'accident,' 'accident,'
when even now the fact is known that the whole middle deck,
which was blown straight up, never had an ounce of ship's powder
under it, and that there the first flame was seen."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 19.
Secretary Long: and Assistant Secre
tary Day of the State Department had
an interview with the President this
morning, lasting nearly an hour.
Mr. Day read a cablegram from Con
sul-General Lee at Havana, transmit
ting a request from the Spanish author
ties in Cuba that the Spanish officials
be permitted to join with our people in
making an investigation into the cause
of the disaster to the Maine. The mat
ter was discussed at considerable
length, and the conclusion was reached,
and General Lee will be so notified,
that, while this Government is willing
to afford the Spanish authorities all
reasonable facilities for conducting an
investigation, yet it is thought best the
first inquiry shall be made by our own
Commissioners. The request of the
Spanish authorities, therefore, will be
respectfully declined.
â¢ The request of the Spanish Govern
ment for permission to examine the
wreck of the Maine reached the State
Department last night through the fol
lowing message from Consul-General
Lee:
HAVANA. Feb. IS. 1898.
Assistant Secretary Day, Washington:
Sigsbee begins to-morrow with divers
sent him from the United States to re
cover all the bodies still left in the wreck
of the Maine, as well as tne personal, ef
fects of officers and men and whatever
else can be obtained that way. After
that the Spanish Government would like
to unite with ours in having the bottom
of the ship and the harbor in the vicinity
jointly examined. LEE.
The following is the answer sent:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19, IS9S.
Lee, Consul-General, Havana: The
Government of the United States has al
r< ady begun an investigation of the
causes of the disaster to the Maine,
through officers of the navy specially ap
pointed for that purpose, which will pro
ceed independently. This Government
will afford every facility it can to the
Spanish authorities in whatever investi
gation they may see fit to make upon
their part. DAY, Assistant Secretary.
The apparent difficulty attending
the sending down of the divers to the
Maine was relieved, if not entirely re
moved, by a statement to-day by
Senor Dubolse, Charge d'Affaires of
the Spanish Legation, that a complete
and harmonious understanding be
tween Captain Sigsbee and the au
thorities at Havana had been reached
on the matter of the divers, and that
the Spanish authorities viewed the
Maine as extraterritorial, all doubts
part of the sovereign territory of the
United States, the same as a United
States Legation situated in foreign
territory. With the Maine holding its
status as extraterritorial, all doubts
as to the progress of the work on the
wreck wero removed.
The waters of Havana harbor are
of course Spanish territory, and some
confusion had been aroused by the
idea that this jurisdiction over the
waters attached also to the wreck in
its present helpless condition at the
bottom of the bay.
It appears, however, that there is no
disposition to extend this jurisdiction
to the ship, and that the Spanish au
thorities give free consent to the
Maine's being regarded as extraterri
torial and under the immediate direction
of Captain Sigsbee, as the representa
tive of the United States. According
to the view taken by the Spanish au
thorities there can be no trouble at
tending the work of the divers. Cap
tain Sigsbee will be recognized as the
one to direct operations and to send
down the Government divers for such
inspection as he sees proper to make.
Mr. Duboise feels assured, however,
that Captain Sigsbee will extend equal
facilities to the Spanish divers, so that
the inspections ma- proceed together.
As to what divers Captain Sigsbee
will employ, the feeling among the
Spanish officials here is that this will
be wholly a matter of discretion with
Captain Sigsbee, as the one in charge
of a piece of property having the at
tributes of American soil, but, at the
same time, the feeling is expressed that
this discretion will lead to the choice
of authorized divers of the Navy De
partment rather than those represent
ing newspapers.

TO DEFEND
THE HARBOR
OF BOSTON
Hurrying in Hot Haste to
Get the Big Guns
Mounted.
Trains Are Speeding Southward
Also With More Guns to
Be Put in Place at
Mobile.
BOSTON, Feb. 19. â Active
preparations for war are being
made all along the New Eng
land Coast, and particularly in
the Boston fortifications. In
compliance with telegraphic or
ders just received at Fort War
ren, a detail of one corporal and
thirteen men has been sent to
re-enforce Lieutenant Ketchum,
in command of the mortar bat
tery at Grovers Cliff, Winthrop.
The men were fully equipped
and carried 100 rounds of am
munition each. Hospital equip
ment was also taken along.
As there are insufficient quarters at
the battery to accommodate this squad,
it will be obliged to camp in quarter
master's tents supplied the party for
the purpose by the Quartermaster's
Department at the fort. These tents
are the regulation "A" tents of the
service, and as they cannot be heated,
the soldiers are likely to have a hard
time of it during the present weather.
Fifteen hundred rounds of ammuni
tion for the battery arrived to-day,
and mortars of the battery will be put
In condition for instant use. The
breech blocks for the mortars have
been lying in the quartermaster's
storehouse since the battery was lo
cated, but now they will be attached.
Rush orders were received at Fort
Warren on Friday by Colonel Wood
ruff, who was directed to send a de
tachment of one corporal and eight
men to Fort Winthrop, where they are
to get the eight eight-inch converted
rifle guns to the dock in readiness for
shipment. The guns are to go to Mo
bile, Ala., where carriages from New
York have been sent to mount the
rifles.
The big guns will go all the way by
rail, a rather expensive method of
transporting heavy material, showing
the urgency of the call. These orders
of the War Department are sent as a
matter of precaution. There is no-thing
necessarily sensational in either the
strengthening the garrison of the new
Winthrop battery or the forwarding to
Mobile of the guns from the old and
dismantled Fort Winthrop on Gov
ernor Island. An additir.-n to the gar
rison erf the mortar battery would
enable the lieutenant in command
properly to care for and drill with the
sixteen huge mortars located there.
Altogether the Winthrop buttery is
the most complete new fortification
which Boston harbor possesses.
The guns which are to go to Mobile
from Governors Island are not strictly
smooth bores, into which jackets car
rying rifle grooves have been inserted.
In point of range and accuracy these
converted cannon would doubtless be
superior to the old type of smooth-bore
artillery, which is the only kind which
most of our forts as yet contain, but
at best are makeshifts.
They are muzzle loaders and their
crew would be terribly exposed to an
enemy's fire in loading, nor could the
guns be discharged with anything ap
proaching the rapidity and acouracy
practicable with the new breech-load
ing rifles, of which, unhappily, we have
but few.
The War Department made it known
that it proposed to make a special
effort to strengthen the defenses of the
Southern seaports, which were in an
even more unprotected condition than
the great cities of the North. It was
in fulfillment of this purpose that sev
eral new 8-inch rifle cannon were being
sent to Savannah when they were lost
at sea some months ago, and active
work has been going on in emplace
ments for guns not only at Savannah,
but at Charleston, Mobile, Key West
and Pensacola. These converted rifles
from Boston harbor are doubtless be
ing forwarded to Mobile, because the
War Department finds itself deficient
in better guns, and feels that these are
fairly sufficient for the purposes. There
are cities on the Atlantic Coast where
works that have been begun are in
such an advanced state of completion
as to call for garrisons.
Heretofore the old forts not in oc
cupancy have been turned over to an
ordnance sergeant. Such posts are Fort
Independence, Fort Winthrop in Boston
harbor, Fort Constitution, at Newcas
tle, N. V., and others of like character,
but with the new high-power guns
comes an expensive and complicated
mechanism in the breech and carriage
requiring far more care than was ever
bestowed on the old Rodmans. It has
been said that the mechanism of the
retreating gun at Warren, the only one
we have mounted, requires as much at
tention and protection as the finest ma
chinery, and no ordnance sergeant
could give that. For that reason the
number of men is increased, as at Win
throp.
But Major Reilley, at the Watertown
arsenal, is running night and day with
a full force of men employed upon the
retreating gun carriages and the gun
mounts needed.

BOSTON, Feb. 19.â The last letter of
brave Fred Blomberg to his mother in,
Wilton, N. H., was as follows:
"HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. 8, 1898.
"Dear Mother: I got your papers,
but I got no letters. Are you getting
tired, or didn't you get them? We have
been here five days, and think we will
stay here till all the trouble is settled.
We came in here all ready to be fired
on. We had all the guns loaded, and
they will stay loaded till we leave.
When we passed Morro Castle torpedo
boats met us, and would not let us en
ter Havana. But we had orders to go
in. and you can bet when they saw our
ten-inch suns they would not interfere.
The whole North Atlantic squadron is
outside waiting for orders.
"We can Bee fighting going on all
around, but they don't seem to inter
fere with us. In the evening boats go
up and down the harbor, and all you
can hear is 'death to America!'
"It is funny to me that we don't
get blown up.
"I have nothing more to write this
time. I am going to send this letter
by one of our torpedo boats that takes
all our mail. We would not trust the
Spaniards with it. First it has to go
to General Lee there, then it goes to
the torpedo boat. I think you will get
it. Send my punching bag I asked you
for in the last letter I wrote. Good by.

ELY BROTHERS, C 6 Warren Street, New YorkIS MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR WAR
SOBRAL MAY
BE RETURNED
TO MADRID
Spanish Naval Attache at
Washington Has Been
Talking Too Much.
Recently He Contributed Articles to
Home Magazines, in Which He
Criticized Uncle Sam's
Defenses.
NEW YORK, Feb. IP.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Lieu
tenant-Commander Jose G. Sobral, the
naval attache of the Spanish legation,
nay be recalled by his Government be
cause of criticism of the American
navy contained in an interview with
him published in the Herald this
morning. The consideration of the
matter is now occupying the attention
of the State Department, and a con
ference to be held by Assistant Secre
tary of State Day with the President \
will determine the line of action to be
taken.
If Lieutenant-Commander Sobrai ;
should admit the authenticity of the
interview, or if it should be substanti
ated, the present temper of the officials ;
indicates that Minister Woodford will \
be- instructed to request the Spanish j
Government to recall him at once,
just as was done in the case of Senor
Dupuy de Lome.
It is the expectation of the attaches
of the Spanish legation that the State
Department will communicate with
Senor Dubosc, Charge d' Affairs, and
ask him to call upon Lieutenant-Com
mander Sobral to state whether he
moted correctly in the Herald this
morning. It is expected that in the
case of Lieutenant-Commander Sobral |
that either Senor Dubosc or the Madrid i
Government, at the request of Minister
Woodford, will call upon Sobral for an
explanation, should he admit the au
thenticity, or should the department as- j
< <=rtain from any other source that he
was correctly quoted his recall will be
requested, and should it not be granted
he wfll receive hi 3 passports.
Lieutenant-Commander Sobral has
been in all the harbors of the United
The Maine as she lay in the darkness at buoy No. 4 on the night of the disaster, with the object (supposed to have
been a torpedo) described by a member of her crew as moving rapidly through the water toward the vessel. Any one of the
several different kinds of dirigible torpedoes might have been sent against the ship, either from a dark corner along the wharf,
not over 3UO yards distant, or from a boat prowling near in the darkness of the moonless tropical night. Starting out on the
surface it would at any point on its course be submerged to the desired depth and made to strike the motionless vessel with
almost certainty on any selected spot.
The modified Nordenfelt type of torpedo has for. some years been a favorite with the Spaniards. It is propelled by
A'ectrical power developed within itself, and is the outcome of the rapid advance in the improvement of accumulator and electro
motors, both electrically and mechanically. Its dimensions, etc., are as follows : Length, 35 feet ; diameter, 29 inches ; weight,
2 1-2 tons; charge, 300 pounds of dynamite; range or length of cable, 2 miles; speed, 16 knots. By electrical control from the
shore over its cable, which is paid out through a small hole in the propeller shait as she goes through the water, the course
can be set or changed and submergence effected by admitting water into certain compartments through special valves, or by expelling
the water by means of gas liberated through another valve it can be made to rise near or to the surface, as may be desired.

TORPEDO BOAT NO. 16
PREPARED FOR SERVICE.
Significance of the Promptness With
Which the New Craft Was
Equipped.
PROVIDENCE, R. 1., Feb. 19.â Tor- a
pedo boat No. 16, known as the Quinn,
was put overboard from the Herres
hoff shop at Bristol in a hurry to-day.
The boat was launched more than a
month ago, but contrary to the usual
form was at once taken into the ad
joining shop and machinists began the
work of equipping the craft with her
engines and other intricate parapher
nalia. This unusual move was taken
as indicative of the desire to get the
boat into commission as quickly as pos
sible, as the work could bt done with
much greater celerity under cover than
when the boat was moored to the dock.
As soon as the craft was put over
board to-day steam was gotten up and
in a short time the engines began to
turn and were kept going the greater
part of the day. There was no cere
mony attending the launching to-day,
and the promptness with which the
engines were set going served to indi
cate that the boat would be put in
commission in short ord?r. The new
boat is a twenty-knot craft of the us
ual type, and a trim and speedy look
ing vessel.

WOULD UNITE
LATIN STATES
El Pais Thinks Spain
Could Form a Big
Confederation.
Republics Might Be Urged to
Resist Intrusion of Anglo-
Saxons.
Some English Newspapers Indicate
That France Would Aid tho
CastiJians.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
LONDON, Feb. 19.â There is a cu
rious discussion in the Spanish press
as to the possibility of confederating
the Latin republics of South America
with Spain against the United States.
El Pais contends that the Spanish re
publics are weak through isolation,
and that if united in a military and
diplomatic alliance they would be the
first power in the world in territory,
the second in population and that their
armies and navies would have suffi
cient power to insure respect. The pa
pers point out that the jealousies of the
republics prevent them from taking the
initiative, but Spain, it is claimed,
ought to urge her lazy diplomats to
approach the republics with the view
of combining for the defense of Latin
interests, "endangered by the intrusion
of the Anglo-Saxons."
El Pais thinks Spain's advice would
not be discarded if she warned Latin
America against the United States,
adding: .
"For it is well known that the greedy
Yankees, once the Panama canal is
opened to the world's commerce, will
do all which their perfidy can suggest
to wrest it from the Latin countries of
Central America, even as England
seized the Suez Canal. Tending in this
direction is the desire of the Americans
to secure Cuba."
In conclusion El Pais says: "The ad
vances of the United States in the sea
of Antilles are preliminary steps in the
blockade and occupation of the future
canal."
Referring to Latin alliances, the
Spectator, in a long article, points out
that there is no doubt of the existence
of special relations between France |
and Spain, which have lately been
strengthened, and says:
"There are well-informed people who
believe that when in the autumn tho |
United States and Spain almost col- i
lided. the United States found there I
was a stiffness in the Spanish attitude |
which could be only accounted for by j
the fact that Spain knew she could :
appeal to a power whtch could not
neglect her demands for help."
The Saturday Review expresses the
belief that France allowed the United ;
States to understand indirectly that â 
considerations of importance to her
would not allow her to see Spain treat
ed in an unfriendly manner.
RESURRECTION
OF THE MAINE
Naval Officers Believe
That the Vessel Can
Be Raised.
By Repairing the Wrecked
Vessel Three Millions Will
Be Saved.
Shallow Water and Calm Weather
in Havana Harbor Combine to
Favor the Project.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. ly.
There is no abatement of the talk of
the expediency of raising the Maine.
Chief Constructor Hichborn is one of
the most earnest advocates of the res
urrection of the ship. He points out
that the ship lies in a landlocked har
bor, easy for the wreckers to operate
in, and that if she can be rebuilt at a
cost of a million dollars, the Govern
ment will save $4,000,000, the first cost
of such a battleship with all of her
equipment. Great Britain, he said,
never abandoned a ship if there was
the least chance to save her, and has
not yet even abandoned the hope of
raising the ill-fated Victoria.
Commander Francis Dicken, the chief
of the bureau of navigation, and Secre
tary Long's right hand man in the
present emergency, said:
"The Maine must be taken to an
American port if there is enough of
her bones holding together to warrant
removal, and in all likelihood that will
be done. If the explosion were more
disastrous than is now thought to be
the case, if the hull is so wrecked as to
be beyond repair, then as much of the
material as can be secured will be
brought home and placed in a new
Maine. It is to be remembered that
great advances have been made in
shipbuilding since the Maine was de
signed, and a liner ship to bear her
name could be built to-day, but it
would take time, and if any consider
able portion of the ship is good, with a
modernized battery and improvements
in rebuilding the destroyed portions, a
magnificent vessel can be quickly se
cured."
Chief Engineer Melville has decided
views in favor of the proposition to re
build the Maine. "Even suppose this
exists $1,000,000." said he, "a new ship
equal to the Maine would cost nearly
$5,000,000. The repairs could be made
and the ship put in service again in a
year at the furthest. To build a new
ship like her would take at least three <
years. W T ith regard to the practicabil-'
ity of raising the vessel, it is to be re
marked that large vessels have been
raised which were at sea where they
were exposed to waves, while the Maine
is in a perfectly quiet harbor, one end
resting in the mud and part of the
other end above water.
TELLS OF THE
AWFUL WRECK
Captain Sigsbee Describes
Incidents of the
Disaster.
After the First Explosion He
Realized That His Ship
Was Gone.
Declares That He Had Always Main
tained Extra Precautions Against
an Attack.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, Feb. 19.â Captain C. D.
Sigsbee of the battleship Maine, in an
interview to-day with a correspondent,
described in detail the explosion which
destroyed the great ship.
"On the night of the explosion," said
Captain Sigsbee, "I had not retired. I
was writing letters. I find it impossi
ble to describe the sound or shock, but
the impression remains of something
awe-inspiring, terrifying, of noise-rend
ing, vibrating, all-pervading. There is
nothing in the former experience of any
one on board by which to measure the
explosion.
"After the first great shockâ l cannot
myself recall how many sharp detona
tions I heard, not more than two or
three â I knew my ship was gone. In
such a structure as the Maine, the ef
fects of such an explosion are not for a
moment in doubt.
"I made my way through the long
passageway in the dark, groping from
side to side in the hatchway and then
into the poop, being among the earliest
to reach that spot. So soon as I recog
nized the officers I ordered the high ex
plosives to be flooded, and I then di
rected that the boats available be low
ered to rescue the wounded or drown
ing. Discipline in perfect measure pre
vailed. There was no more confusion
than a call to general quarters would
produce, nor as much.
"I soon saw by the light of the flames
that all my officers and crew left alive
and on board surrounded me. J can
not form any idea of the time, but it
seemed five minutes from the time I
reached the poop until I left, the last
man it was possible to reach having
been saved. It must have been three
quarters of an hour or more, however,
from the amount of work -lone.
"I remember the officers and men
worked together lowering the boats,
and that the gig took some time to low
er. I did not notice the rain of debris
described by Lieutenant Blandin or
others who were on deck at the time
of the first explosion, but I did observe
the explosion of the fixed ammunition,
and wondered that more were not hurt
thereby.
"Without going beyond the limits of
what was proper in the harbor of a
friendly power, I had always main
tained precautions against attack, and
the quarter watch was ordered to have
ammunition for the. smaller gunsready to
hand, so that in the improbable event
of attack on the ship it would be found
ready. It was this ammunition which
exploded as the heat reached it."
Captain Sigsbee and all officers here
are very anxious for news from the
United States as to the public opinion
there. The captain has done all he can
to calm the excitement in the United
States and to induce the public to wait
for the results of the investigation be
fore forming a judgment as to the
cause of the explosion.
VERY LITTLE MONEY
LOST IN THE WRECK.
Owing to a Recent Change of Pay
masters Only a Small Sum
Remained on the Maine.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19.â 1t hap
pens that by the rare chance of an un
expected change of paymasters recent
ly very little of the savings of the
Maine's sailors went down in the ves
sel. About two weeks ago Paymaster
Littlefield of the Maine was relieved
by Paymaster Ray. The former came
to Washington and has settled the ac
counts of the ship up to the time he
left. The record shows that Paymaster
Hay had on hand in his safe only
about $3000 cash, probably gold, and a
check for $6000, which, of course, is
safe enough without his indorsement
against loss. _
Getting Keady to Move.
JUNCTION, CITY (Kas.), Feb 19.â
The fact that" the troops at Fort Riley
were busy all day yesterday preparing
their equipment and packing personal
effects, and that all furlmighs to offi
cers and men are refused pending fur
ther orders, has given rise to the report
that orders have been received to be
in readiness to move on short notice.
Two Terrific Beports Heard.
KEY WEST, Fla., Feb. 19.â A pas
senger on the steamer Olivette, from
Havana, which arrived here to-night,
reports that shortly after the vessel's
departure from Havana, when she
was about eight miles off shore, two
terrific reports were heard. The
sounds resembled the discharge of
heavy cannon or large explosives.
Filling Naval Vacancies.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19.â Orders
have been issued for the enlistment of
300 men for the navy to fill the vacan
cies caused by the destruction of the
battle-ship Maine and to complete the
legal quota. The new men will be
sent to receiving-ships, whence they
will be sent to ships In commission
whenever needed.
NAT C. GOODWIN TO
WED MAXINE ELLIOTT.
NEW YORK. Feb. 19.â A Cleveland spe
cial to the Herald says: Mr. Nat C. Good
win and Miss Maxine Elliott will be mar
ried at Hollenden to-morrow morning.
George Appleton, Goodwin's manager,
paid a visit to the probate court late this
afternoon and procured the necessary li
cense He swore the clerk to secrecy in
the matter, and the license was taken
from the back part of the book. The
wedding to-morrow morning will be a
very quiet affair, the only guestsbeingMr.
and Mrs. Appleton and Miss Gertrude El
liott, sister of the bride.
When Goodwin was in Chicago three
weeks ago he received notice that Judge
Pryor of the Supreme Court of New York
had rendered a decree in the divorce case
of Nella R. Goodwin against Nat Good
win, by which she was restored to her
maiden name and given the privilege of
remarrying. He, however, was especially
prohibited- from marrying during the life
of his former wife. This decree, however,
ia only legally operative in New York.
Goodwin was averse to being married
in Chicago, and, as he played in Buffalo,
N. V., last week he could not be married
there. So the marriage is to take place
bere at cncc.
UNDOUBTEDLY
PREPARATIONS
ARE FOR WAR
A Statement Made by Gen
eral Miles, However, to
Allay Excitement. .
While High Officials Continue to
Talk Calmly Uncle Sam's Forts,
Armies and Fleets Are
Strengthened.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington Feb. 19.
The possibilities of the foreign situa
tions are thoroughly appreciated by the
War Department, but it cannot be said
that the authorities have been moved
by any recent developments to take
any new or extraordinary steps toward
increasing the fighting strength of the
country. Certain orders which have
been issued and the shipment of small
supplies of ordnance, coincident with
the recent events in Cuba, have been
interpreted as of sinister import. Con
cerning these Major-General Miles said
to me to-day:
"Day before yesterday I issued a cir
cular letter to commanding officers of
all military departments directing
them to detail detachments of artillery
of about twenty or thirty men each
to the under-garrisoned artilley posts,
where new guns have recently been
mounted. My orders have already be
gun to be carried into effect. For in
stance, Major-General Merritt, com
manding the Department of the East,
has informed me that he has ordered a
detachment from upper New York har
bor to Fort Hancock and a detachment
has been ordered to the new mortar
battery at Boston. This cannot be con
sidered as garrisoning the artillery
posts.
"Detachments are sent in accord
ance with recommendations which I
made long ago touching the necessity
of detailing a few men to each of the
new fortifications to properly care for
the guns and to become familiar with
their operation. Modern ordnance suf
fers from disuse and lack of care, and
it is with a view of preserving expen
sive ordnance that is being mounted
that the orders were issued.
"We have not yet obtained from
Congress authority to enlist two new
regiments of artillery, which are so
much needed. It is therefore necessary
to utilize as far as possible facilities
now at our command. Sine^ we cannot
yet quarter an adequate fore ; of artil
lerymen in immediate contact with the
guns owing both to lack of men and
to lack of barracks, there is nothing to
be done for the present but to detail
detachments to care for and man the
high-power guns and mortars as they
are placed in position. There are
twenty-six points where new ordnance
now requires or soon will require at
tention, and to garrison them properly
will require more than seven regiments
of artillery as a minimum."
The new fortifications to which
General Miles referred are: Portland,
Me.; Great Diamond Island, Portland,
Me.; Fort Constitution, Portsmouth,
N. H.; Grovers Cliff, Boston harbor,
Mass.; Paddocks Island, Boston har
bor, Mass.; Long Island Head, Bos
ton harbor, Mass.; Dutch Island, Nar
ragansett Bay, R. I.; Great Gull Isl
and, eastern entrance Long Island
Sound, New York; Plum Island, east
ern entrance Long Island Sound, New
York; Fort Hancock, New York har
bor; Finns Point, approach to Phila
delphia; North Point, approach to
Baltimore; Hawkins Point, approach
to Baltimore; Fort Washington and
Sheridan Point, approach to Wash
ington, D. C; Fort Caswell, Wilming
ton, N. C. ; Fort Moultrie, Charleston,
S. C; Tybee Island. Savannah, Ga.;
Fort Morgan, Mobile, Ala; Fort St.
Philip, New Orleans; Fort Point, Gal
veston, Texas; Ballast Point, San
Diego, Cal. ; Lime Point (or Fort
Baker), San Francisco harbor; Fort
Stevens, mouth of the Columbia Riv
er, Wash.; Morrow Stone Point and
Admiralty Head.
The shipment to-day of 8-inch double
muzzle-loading rifles converted from
ordnance made more than fifteen years
ago from Fort Winthrop, in Boston
harbor, to Fort Morgan, at Mobile, Ala.,
I am told by Brigadier-General Flag
ler, chief or ordnance, is mere matter
of routine. Eight-inch rapid fire dis
appearing guns are in position at Mo
bile, and carriages for the converted B
inch guns of the old type having been
recently shipped from Watervliet
arsenal, requisition was made for the
delivery at Mobile of some of the guns
which were stored at Fort Winthrop.
Such shipments are of weekly occur
rence, and while the result is to stead
ily put the- coast defenses in more effi
cient condition, no movement of ord
nance that has yet been made has any
special significance.
It is no secret that the military infor
mation division of the adjutant-gen
eral's office is thoroughly informed as
to the strength of the military organ
izations of the various States, and most
elaborate and detailed plans are on file
at the department with regard to their
mobilization on a different basis, ac
cording to different degrees of necessity
as well as to problems of subsistence,
transportation, clothing, ammunition,
The great railway systems of the
country are prepared to transport at
the shortest notice large bodies of
troops to points of rendezvous together
with all the stores of the quartermas
ters, subsistence and ordnance depart
ments, and arrangements are perfected
by which adequate transports for a
large number of troops may be fur
nished from the Atlantic and Gulf
coasts in case of emergency.
It has been estimated by officials of
the Pennsylvania Railroad that they
can transport 100,000 troops over their
system in from twenty-four to thiry
six hours. It is likewise stated that
several divisions could be assembled in
the Ohio Valley and transported to the
Gulf coast in a slightly longer time. In
case of trouble the regular infantry,
cavalry and artillery, according to the
plans of the department, would be
drawn from interior posts and distrib
uted among sea coast fortifications.
The militia summoned by the President
would be assigned to the same points
and assimilated as far as possible with
the regular troops.
Of the National Guards those of New
York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts,
Illinois, Maryland and the District of
Columbia are considered the most ef
ficient in the country, and it would be
from these that the most efficient aid
could be drawn. The President, how
ever, is not empowered to call for a
portion of the entire militia of any or
all States as such. He can either call
for a certain number of troops from
the country at large, or which would
be unlikely to be done, he may author
ize the impressment of any citizens of
States selected by enlisting officers. In
order to enlist in the United States
army tho militia of States as at pres
ent organized an order, of the Gover
nor of the State to that effect is ne
cessary.
Beyond making necessary precau
tions to meet any emergency that may
arise the Navy Department is not dis
turbing itself over the many war ru
mors which have been afloat since the
De Lome incident and the destruction
of the battle-ship Maine. As the Her
ald and Call have stated, it is pro
posed to keep the monitors Puritan and
Terror in commission, and the work on
repairs to the former vessel is being
pushed at the Norfolk navy-yard, and
it is expected that she will be ready
for active service in two weeks.
The Terror is ready for sea. Depart
ment officials say the only significance
which can be attached to this is a de
sire to keep the navy up to a certain
strength and that by the loss of the
Maine it was reduced below minimum.
Consequently it was determined to
place the two monitors in commission.
One of the most interesting precau
tionary steps which the department
has recently taken is the mobilization
of vessels in all portions of the world.
Under Instructions given by Secretary
Long, the battleships Indiana, Massa
chusetts and lowa, the second-class
battleship Texas the cruisers Marble
head, Detroit and Montgomery, and the
gunboat Nashville will be assembled
between Key West and Dry Tortugas
some day next week. It is highly prob
able that either the Montgomery or
Nashville will take the place of the
Maine in the harbor of Havana. Of
the remaining vessels of the North At
lantic squadron the Brooklyn, Annap
olis and Wilmington will be at La
Guayar the first of next week; the
Vicksburg will be at St. Ketts, and the
Newport either at Colon or at Grey
town, Nicaragua.
In accordance with orders issued by
the department several weeks ago, the
Cincinnati and Castine, comprising the
American force on the South Atlantic
station, have moved to the northern
part of Brazil. The European squad
ron, consisting of the cruiser San Fran
cisco and the gunboats Helena and
Bancroft, is at Lisbon, Portugal, and
will not move from that point until or
dered by Secretary Long. The Asiatic
squadron has also been mobilized to
some extent. The flagship Olympia,
the cruiser Raliegh and the gunboat
Petrel are at Hongkong, about 500 miles
from the Philippine Islands, and there
they are expected to remain.
The cruiser Boston, which is attached
to the Chinese squadron, is at Chemul
po, Korea, and the gunboat Concord at
Yokohama. One of these vessels will
join the flagship at Hongkong.
Under instructions issued by Com
mander Dickins, Acting Chief of the
Bureau of Navigation, enlistments are
being made to fill up vacancies in the
enlisted force of the service caused by
the , loss of 251 men of the Maine's
erew r .
So far as ammunition is concerned, it
was frankly told by an official of the
department that all preparations pos
sible to be made with present appli
ances have been perfected. In great
emergencies it is within the power of
the department to draw upon the in
crease of the navy appropriations and
make contracts for ordnance supplies.
This was done by Mr. Herbert when
Secretary of the Navy, Just after Presi
dent Cleveland Inaugurated the nego
tiations with Great Britain for a set
tlement of the Venezuelan question.
This action has not yet been taken by
Secretary Long, nor has he any in
tention of doing so at this time, so far
as can be learned. The officials say
that the report that the Carpenter Pro
jectile Company is working overtime
under instructions from the depart
ment is not the result of any pressure
from them. I was told to-day that the
Carpenter Company had delayed the
completion of the work and that the
department had informed it of its in
tention to impose a penalty unless it
were completed within the time limit.
As a result of this threat it has been
understood that the firm would ex
pedite the manufacture of projec
tiles that is under way.
No special orders with reference to
hurrying work on naval vessels under
repairs have been issued. Chief Naval
Constructor Hichborn has been doing
all in his power to hasten the comple
tion of vessels so as to get them out
of the yards, but no orders of any kind
have been issued to expedite the work

WOULD PROVE A GREAT SUCCESS.
An Exposition in 1900 to Commemorate the Semi-Centennial Anniversary of the Admission of Cali
fornia Into the Union Meets With General Approval.
â â â â â â â â
Mayor Phelan Will Appoint a Committee of Prominent Business Men to Arrange the Preliminary Details â The State Legislature Will Be Asked to Make
an Appropriation to Assist in Carrying Out the Project â Fraternal Organizations Will Assist.
The semi-centennial exposition in
1900 suggested by The Call will prove
a far greater success than the Mid
winter Fair. It is a matter of [oca]
history that the Midwinter Fair
proved of great advertising value to
California, and in addition surpassed
the expectations of the mnsc sanguine
of Its directors. It was held at a tim.
when there was but small hope of
drawing the attention of the East t.i
the wonderful resources and products
â of our State. Many Eastern people
came hero and were so charmed by our
climate and natural advantages that
they decided t<; remain with us. Con
trasted with the winter storms of the
East, our climate proved t<> be what
we claimed. We advertised to the
world that we had a land of almost
perpetual sunshine and we proved our
assertion true. While the peop!.- â â¢;'
the East were suffering with cold
those who visited our hospitable shores
, had the privilege of enjoying . our
balmy climate.
The Midwinter Fair was ;: SU :cess.
The semi-centennial exposition will !><â 
a greater one, for it will be conducted
on a larger and grander si-aie. We have
at our hand everything necessary to
make an exposition thai will rival that
of Paris in 1900. All that ;s required
is a small amount of work on the part
of those who have in the past assisted
in bringing California prominently be
fore the civilized world. The Paris
exposition should not deter us from
carrying out the project. .siany why
will cross the ocean to attend the
World's Fair in i:Â»0o will also visit the
exposition of the Pacific Slope.
The States admitted to the L'ninn af
ter California will join in making the
exposition one that wiii be thoroughly
representative of the coast. All of
the fraternal and labor organizations
have givi n aid and
Major Phelan and Governor Budd are
in accord with the movement.
That the Suit" Legislature will make
an appropriation to forward the pro
posed celebration is assured. All that
now remains to do is to have a commit
tee appointed to take the matter in
hand and arrange the preliminary de
tails. Every county in California can
be safely counted on to do its share of
the work. Mayor Phelan will name :t
committee of business men to represent
San Francisco, and within the next few
tveeks the other counties will have sim
ilar committees appointed. The ex
position will prove a grand success if
there is a concentration "f action.
That such a course will be followed is

INDORSED
BY THE PRESS
Strong Commendations of The
Call's Timely Sug
gestion.
A CALIFORNIA EXPOSITION.
San Francisco Chronicle.
The Call has suggested that the fif
tieth anniversary of the admission of
the State of California to the Union
should be celebrated by holding an ex
position which shall fittingly illustrate
the growth made by the commonwealth
since the year 1850. The idea is an ex
cellent one, and if the people take hold
of it as they should no doubt the pro
ject can be successfully carried out.
There is no question about the ability
of California to get up an attractive
show. The Midwinter Fair afforded
abundant affirmative evidence on that
point, and demonstrated conclusively
that there is a disposition on the part
of the people to support such enter
prises if they have instructive, inter
est ing and amusing features.
In order, however, to make a success
of the undertaking hard work will have
to be done in advance. Public-spirited
citizens will have to turn to and labor
untiringly. No perfunctory efforts will
serve to accomplish anything substan
tial. There must be zeal from the word
go, and words must be matched with
.j. eds.
At this stage of the affair it is not
necessary to outline what can or ought
to be done. The chief thing to do is to
ascertain whether the people desire to
commemorate the fiftieth anniversary
In the appropriate manner suggested
by our contemporary. Tf they do the
i'hr<>nicle may be depended upon to
zealously assist in carrying the affair
to a successful consummation.
CALIFORNIA'S SEMI-CENTENNIAL
Pan Jose Mercury.
The suggestion made by the San
Francisco Call that the semi-centen
nial of the admission of California into
the Union be made the occasion of a
THE â  ; ; SA^ - FRANCISCO CALL, : STTKDAY ) FEBBTJARY 20, 1898;
great exposition, in San Francisco is
worthy of the serious consideration of
the people of this State. The year
1900 will be the nineteenth centennial
of the Christian era and the first semi
centennial of California's statehood.
The material, educational and moral
progress made in this State since 1850
is closely connected with the advance
ment of Christian civilization. An ex
position designed to portray the won
derful transformation that has been
brought about here since the era of
Spanish missions, in which the foun
dations of government, industry and
the intellectual and moral superstruc
ture of to-day were firmly laid, would
attract the attention of the world and
add to the glory of a State, the his
tory of whose marvelous achievements
reads like the chapters of a romance.
The world has never had but one Cal
ifornia. It sprang into existence al
most in a single day. Year after year
it has poured a wealth of gold into the
channels of the world's trade. But that
is the least of its achievements. It has
provided much of the bread for the
millions of Europe. And to-day it is
known as the garden and orchard of
America. Upon it the East depends for
its most luscious fruits, and the pro
ducts of its trees are in demand in
England, Germany and other foreign
countries. Xo State in the Union, no
territory of similar dimensions on
earth, grows so great a - variety of
fruits. And its progress in other re
spects has been equally remarkable.
It ranks high in art, science, architect
ure, education and literature. Here,
no less than in the oldest States of the
Union, are found those agencies which
elevate, refine and broaden humanity.
A celebration such as that suggested
would be an event of more than na
tional importance. Would it be pos
sible for California to raise the money
that would be required to make the
proposed exposition a success? It ia
the opinion of W. H. Mills that a really
great occasion is more easy of accom
plishment than an inconsiderable un
dertaking.
Two millions could be raised more
easily than a hundred thousand. "Cal
ifornia." he says, "expended on the
World's Fair at Chicago over $700,000
to make an exhibit. This sum included
all that was expended by the State,
counties and by individual exhibitors.
But California expended, according to
some intelligent estimates, nearly $10.
000.000 in visiting the fair. If this be
exaggerated, let it be assumed that the
State spent $5,000,000, and the net cost
of the exhibit at Chicago was from six
to seven millions of dollars. This ex
penditure abroad reduced the cash cap
ital of the State by six or seven mil
lions." The money is here. The sum
advanced for the exposition would be a
safe Investment. The exposition could
be made to pay its way, and indirectly
it would attract a vast amount of capi
tal into the State, besides giving us
prestige abroad. Let us celebrate with
fitting grandeur California's semi-cen
tennial.
Alameda Argus.
The Call is making a stir to have a
great exposition of Pacific Coast re
sources and products in 1900. It is a
good move. It should be carried
through. And new is about the time to
begin preparations.
LEGISLATURE
SHOULD ASSIST.
An Exposition Such as Projected
Would Attract Many
Strangers.
M. GREENBLATT, editor California
Demokratâ l have often asked myself
the question, Why is it that California,
so inexhaustible in natural wealth and
so peculiarly free from elementary dis
turbances, does not attract a more
numerous population? Where is there
a State in the Union, aye, a country in
the world, that offers such induce
ments to the home-seeker as does our
State?
There can be but one answer. We do
not appreciate the importance of a
large population to the development of
the country. We have heretofore re
frained from making the proper efforts
to attract and draw strangers to Cali
fornia.
Of course there will be, perhaps, al
ways enough to eat for the people
within our borders. Stream, forest,
vineyard, orchard and potato patch
will yield enough to feed us for gener
ations to come. Hut are we content,
like aborigines, to forever subsist on
such meager farf? Can that be the
sum and substance rÂ»f the ambition of
a modern people? In order to attract
Immigrants we must show them what
our State is and what it can produce*,
and I cannot think of a more potent
agency to that end than an exhibition
such as is suggested by The Call.
There is no time to be lost if we
would do honor to ourselves and jus
tice to the State. The next Legisla
ture should be asked to pass necessary
measures and extend financial aid to
an enterprise which will enure to the
lasting benefit of the entire common
wealth.
ITALIANS WILL
LEND SUPPORT.
Leading Firms Will Give Neces-
sary Financial Aid to
the Hxposition.
C. P. E. FIGLI, proprietor and editor
of La Voce del Popolo, one of the lead
ing Italian papers in this cityâ l have
exploited the idea ofÂ«an exposition in
my paper, and from conversations had
with some of our leading citizens I
feel confident that they will lend their
hearty co-operation. I can think of no
more fitting way to commemorate the
semi-centennial admission of our State
into the Union than by holding an ex
position. The Italians have always
aided in making affairs of that charac
ter a success and will not be found
lacking in their support in this in
stance. Many of the leading firms of
our colony will aid the exposition, as
they know the value to be derived from
one. During the Midwinter Fair thou
sands of visitors came to our State,
and viewed our products. California's
resources were advertised throughout
the country in a way which was of in
estimable value. When the Midwinter
Fair was held here there w r as a gen
eral depresion of business, yet it did
a great deal toward improving things
throughout the State. It is only by
holding exhibitions of this kind pro
posed that California can hope to in
terest outsiders in her resources. I am
in favor of an exposition and will do
all I possibly can to bring about its
realization.
WHOLE COAST
SHOULD JOIN.
Legislature Should Make a Lib
eral Appropriation â San Fran-
Cisco the Place.
M. H. DE YOUNGâ The holding of a
great exposition, such as has been pro
posed, is to my mind the most appro
priate way of commemorating the
semi-centennial anniversary of Cali
fornia.
As it will be of inestimable benefit to
every section of the State, the next
Legislature should make a liberal ap
propriation to assist in successfully
carrying on the project.
A plan for organizing should be put
in shape at once, so that there will be
no delay in formulating plans for the
exposition.
That the exposition should be held in
San Francisco cannot be questioned.
That this city is prepared to take care
of a large number of people has been
clearly demonstrated on former great
occasions. The whole Pacific Slope
should Join in making the exposition a
success. Sectional strife should not
enter into our minds on this occasion.
Let State pride predominate. We must
all work together with a will.
IT WILL BENEFIT
CALIFORNIA.
Should Be an Exposition Worthy
the Great State Whose Honor
It Is to Commemorate.
STATE SENATOR EUGENE F.
BERT â There have been a great
many good things done for the
benefit of San Francisco during
the past twenty years, but I
know of nothing as yet attempted in
the way of bringing California to the
notice of all parts of the United States
-and the countries of Europe, China, Ja
pan and Australia e^ual to this pro
posed semi-centennial celebration of
California's admission into the Union
of States. It will not only be a bene
fit to California, but to the entire Pa
cific Coast, and as a consequence every
State on the coast should join with us
in the movement. It deserves the
united support of every man, woman
and child capable of appreciating the
great good that must follow.
Neither politics nor divisional lines
should be permitted to interfere in
making this semi-centennial one of the
greatest successes ever undertaken in
this city. If all unite in this great
and meritorious undertaking it will, it
must be a success; and by being a
success the entire State will reap the
benefits. Every man, whether he be
a native son or an adopted citizen,
should be proud of the State that has
no equal under the broad canopy of
heaven to-day.
The mover of this project has, by ex
ample, shown his appreciation of thÂ«
benefits of the State and the city in,
which he lives and has done so much to
improve and adorn. This is but one
more act added to many others to bring
San Francisco to prominent position,
In commerce and industry that its situ
ation, climate and advantages com
mand and possess. Now for a cele
bration that will cap the climax and.
be the crowning point of all former
undertakings, I am with the movement
heart and soul.
IT WILL INVITE
THE WHOLE WORLD.
No Better Way to Accomplish
California's Benefit Than the
One Proposed by The Call.
E. F. FITZGERALD, Labor Com
missionerâl indorse the proposed
semi-centennial exposition. I am heart
ily in favor of all such celebrations
held in this State, as I believe they
invite the attention of the world to a
land whose natural advantages are so
great that its possibilities are immeas
urable, but as yet undeveloped to the
degree which they warrant. There
fore, I deem this class of advertising
an attractive display of inestimable
benefit.
California opened the first door to
the commerce of the Pacific and for
years held full sway, but during the
last fifteen years competition has de
prived us of part of this valuable heri
tage; it therefore behooves us to cre
ate a strong spirit of enterprise, ener
getically maintain and jealously guard
this acquisition â awaken our people to
the necessities and invite strangers to
join us in the accomplishment of the
result.
This is one of the many reasons why
our commercial importance and the
many sources of wealth possessed by
the State should be kept before the
world, and I know of no better way
to accomplish it than that proposed by
The Call.

Three masked robbers held up four
men in room 26 of the Baltimore House
â  corner of Bush street and Grant
â¢ I- 1 late Friday night and robbed
them of their jewelry and money. The
heaviest loser was Bert Cubett, a sport
ing man, who was forced to give up a
lond pin valued at $200, a gold
v itch and chain, two diamond rings
and $10 in gold.
- irtly before midnight the robbers
visited the house and knocked on the
door "f the room occupied by Cubett.
Three of the latter's friends were in
the room at the time, and as one of
them opened the door the robbers, with
drawn revolvers, ordered them to
thr"\v up their hands under penalty of
; riddled with bullets.
They were then made to stand

They then waited for the return of
Cubett. He appeared a few minutes
later, and as he opened the door of
the room he was seized by the rob
bers, who threatened to kill him if
he made an outcry. Realizing he was
in the hands of desperate men Cubett
readily submitted to being robbed of
his valuables. After taking his dia
monds one of the robbers, being unable
to unfasten his watch chain, took out
his knife and cut away a portion of
Cubett's vest. In the meantime the
other robbers kept their revolvers un
der his nose, frequently declaring their
intention of blowing his head off if he
made an outcry. During the holding
up of Cubett his fellow victims re
mained under the bed, evidently think
ing: that the armed desperadoes would
not hesitate to shout them if they
dared to move.
After satisfying themselves that they
had not overlooked anything of value
the robbers backed out of the room
and fastened the door with a padlock
so as to prevent their victims from
following them. They then threw their
masks in the hallway and quietly left
the h"US6.
After waiting for some time and be
ing convinced that the robbers would

for heip. Several of the lodgers heard
their screams, and with the aid of a

Captain "f Detectives Bohen was at

THE MINING FAIB.
Thieves Pay the Great Exhibition a
Visit.
The "meanest man" is again in town,
and has made his presence felt at the
mining fair in Mechanics' Pavilion. "When
Secretary Filcher of the State Board of
Trade made his usual rounds yesterday
he found that his exhibit had been
"touched" by a member of the light-fin
gered fraternity. Although the articles
taken are insignificant in value, the spirit
which prompted the robbing of one of
the finest exhibits at the fair is greatly
deplored, and if the culprit can be found
he will be shown little mercy.
Last night was university night at the
fair, and one did not need to be told so
in advance to realize this fact.
The feature of the evening was a cocoa
nut opening contest, which proved as in
teresting as amusing. Handsome cash
prises were offered to the speediest men,
and, judging from the way they worked,
they certainly earned them. The first
prize for opening twenty-five cocoanuts
was won by A. Conrich; second, Antoine
Winnobich; third, George Mellivich;
fourth, V. Bacigalupi. The prize for
shaving ten cocoanuts was captured by
F. Bacigalupi.
The management of the Calaveras
County exhibit has prepared a handsome

OIL IS FOUND
NEAR VALLEJO
E. Pander, a Solano Farmer,
Discovers Petroleum on
His Ranch.
Experts Pronounce It a Very Valu
able Belt and. One That Is
Easy to Work.
In Solano County, three and a half
miles north of Vallejo, a belt of oil has
been- discovered which, according to ex
pert Investigations, is both rich in qual
ity and extensive in quantity. The land
on which the oil has been found is the
property of E. Pander.
About six ' months ago, while Pander,
unconscious of any subterranean streams
of petroleum, was digging for irrigating
purposes, he noticed as soon as he struck
water a strong odor of coal oil. Drawing
this -water to the surface he found it to
be covered with a film of oil, one-half
inch in thickness. Bottling this to send
as specimens to friends in the city, ho
kept on digging and the farther he went
into the earth the greater was the pro
portion of oil to water. Parden adver
tised for an oilwell digger and put him
to work drilling for petroleum. All indi
cations of a strong subterranean stream
of petroleum were disclosed from the sur
face conditions.
An oil expert. H. D. Miranda, who is
the chief engineer of the Peruvian Oil
Company and chief of oil experts on the
staff of a big French syndicate, visited
the ranch of Pander a month ago. in
spected the sunken wells and passed a
very favorable judgment upon it. His
carefully prepared opinion reads as fol
lows:
"You were led to suppose that this land
contained oil by some surface Indications
found on digging a small well fourteen
feet deep In an adobe field adjoining the
house located on the ranch. In my opin
ion these indications are but oil oozing
from the heavier oils or asphalts that
most likely underlie these adobe fields
and which are the flltrations from the
main belt.
"After a careful survey of the land, its
numerous out crop pings, indicative of the
probable general stratification of the un
derground, I am of the opinion that at
some 1500 metres from the house. In a
northerly direction, beginning where the

"The belt seems to me to have a longi
tude f >f four or five thousand metres, and
aa to its breadth, it is difficult to state
with any degree of precision, as no drill
ing has so far been made on the land.
This ground is an ideal location for drill
ing, being two miles from a fresh water
reservoir, where both power and water
service may be had cheap. The same
may be said for the exportation of the oil,
which can easily be sent by gravitation
through pipes to San Francisco bay, dis
tant thence but a few miles."
Assured of the substatlality of his
discovery, Pander disclosed the matter to
one of the largest oil concerns operating
in the West. The corporation has so far
interested itself as to send out one of its
Bastera experts. The land has already
been examined by the corporation's agent
in this city and it is through his advice
that such action was taken.
It ie thought that the oil belt extends
through many miles in Solano County
According to analysis, the oil so far ob
tained gives promise of being very rich
with the constituency of Pennsylvania pe
troleum.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1898.
SWORN TO BY
LIVERNASH
WHEN DYING
The Story by the Dead
Man Unknown
to The Call.
Secrecy and Premedita
tion Attended the
Fatal Deed.
The Misguided Man's Sister
Says He Was Not Insane,
but Desperate.
LAST ACTS OF HIS LIFE.
He Swept and Garnished His Office
Ready for His Suc
cessor.
"I have sold a story to The Call; to
my dying breath I swear they do not
know what is in it." Such was the ex
traordinary statement made by the
newspaper man who committed sui
cide in order that his wife and those
dependent on him should at least have
daily bread for some time after his
death.
That such a thing might one day
happen in connection with a man who
had spent his life in newspaper work
and wished* to make a dramatic exit
from this world has long been a topic
of conversation among reporters, but
when the story of such a suicide as
printed, in yesterday's Call was read
the newspaper men were aghast at the
terrible realism and professional se
crecy displayed by the deceased man.
On Friday evening last Livernash
visited the editorial rooms of The Call
and said he had a story to dispose of
at a certain figure. He hinted that the
Btory was in connection with a Fed
eral official who had been guilty of em
bezzlement and that it would have a
sensational development. He was told
that if the story were worth using and
could be substantiated he would be
paid the price he demanded, but in
the event of the paper not being able
to print his communication his manu
script would be consigned to the waste
paper basket. He agreed to the terms
proposed and left the office, saying he
would write the Btory and send it in by
a messenger. Not a word did he utter
of his suicidal intentions, nor give any
clew as to whom the official implicated
might be.
The messenger who brought the news
of the suicide brought the promised
manuscript, and the entire story was
given to the world yesterday morning.
The mere fact of bargaining for a
price which could only be secured by
his own death, and keeping the whole
matter secret until he had terminated
his existence, mark the occurrence as
one of the most extraordinary that has
ever happened.
"He was not insane; he was a des
perate man," is the statement made by
the wife and sister of J. J. Livernash,
who committed self-murder on Friday
night last. That they are speaking
from an intimate knowledge of the
facts which led to the dead man's self
destruction cannot be doubted for an
instant, when it is borne in mind that
they had for months gone without the
ordinary necessaries of life in order
that the husband and brother, the idol
of the family, might have the money
which he said he so sorely needed.
The suicide of Livernash is the sequel
to the old, old story, of the man who
could not say "No." Unable to resist
temptation, utterly at the mercy of^any
designing scoundrel who made his ac
quaintance, he was helpless and piti
ably weak when enticed by so-called
friends to do that which, for the sake
of his wife and family, he should have
avoided as an unspeakable evil. Gamb
ling and the intemperate use of strong
liquors have been the cause of many
suicides, but in no other case on rec
ord has there been such cold-blooded
premeditation and preparation, as well
as such an Intense desire that his wife
should benefit more by his death than
she ever could have hoped to do from
the kind of life he was living.
Miss Lizzie Livernash. when seen,
yesterday, said: "The letter left by
my brother was not the raving of an
insane man, but a simple statement of
a man who was driven to desperation
by adverse circumstances. All that he
stated regarding our misfortunes with
the Healdsburg Enterprise was true.
We were turned out without a dollar.
As soon as Mr. Menihan acquired pos
session of the paper he turned us out bag
and baggage. My brother's accounts
are not in disorder. The largest amount
he could possibly be short is the small
sum of $50. I have looked into this
matter thoroughly this morning. The
truth is that he was desperate, and of

late he had often Bald to us that he
would be worth -more to his family if
he was dead than he ever would be liv

family in Healdsburg were in the same
predicament. What was he to do to
obtain money for living expenses for
all of us? Ed had deserted us and
brought shame upon us. He has not
contributed one cent to the support of
our five young brothers and sisters
since he was married. He is the cause
of the rumor that there is a taint of
insanity in our family. When he was
A FIN-DE-SIECLE
REPORTER'S SUICIDE.
The Suicideâ Good evening, Death, I've long desired to make
your acquaintance.
Deathâ lndeed! I thought there was an element of fear in ac
quaintance with me.
The Suicideâ Not at all. I intend to call upon you shortly.
There's a little matter I have to attend to first, though.
Death â Young man, as a rule, I make the appointment when
mortals and I shall meet.
The Suicideâ "Leaves have their time to fall, â¦
And flowers to wither at the north wind's breath.
But thou hast all seasons for thine own,
O Death!"
I>eathâ Exactly.
The Suicideâ l'm not quite sure of the quotation, but, anyway
it doesn't apply to me.
Dea Â«hâ Well, come then.
The Suicideâ That's rather a grudging Invitation. But I'll ac
cept itâ presently. If you don't mind waiting.
Deathâ I do.
The Suicideâ Never mind, wait, anyway. Just have a chair.
I've some writing to do â a little over a column; at any rate
not more than a column and a couple of sticks. They'll pay
$100 for it. That's nearly 9 cents a word. Pretty good rate?
Show me the newspaper man in town that gets as much! Be
sides, business is business. I've promised this stuffâ
Deathâ lt's absurd for you to be thinking of anyone, of anything
but me. I am supreme. My majesty is so overshadowing that
it will brook no rival thought.
The Suicide â You wouldn't have a good newspaper man "fall
down" on his detail. "What would the city editor say?
Denih- His remarks will not reach you.
The Suicide â That's a narrow view to take of it. It's plain
you were never employed on a great daily.
I>eatliâ Ts it an important detail?
The Suicide â Why it's a scoop, practically.
I>eathâ And you're proud of it?
The Suicideâ Rather.
I>enÂ«hâ Perhaps you'd better wait about seeing me till to
morrow. Then you can see how your story looks in print.
Tlie Suicide â It wouldn't be a story then. It would be a fake,
and my reputation as a reliable reporter would be ruined.
Deathâ Why should you care? Nothing makes any difference,
when a man once puts his hand in mine.
The Suicide (writing busily) â Don't interrupt. That's a good
fellow. You might be copyreader, for once, if you're Inclined
to be amiable, and read it over. That'll save time.
Death (glancing over Suicide's shoulder at the sheets of copy) â
That's a pretty good introduction â impersonal, business-like.
Do you think you'd run that about insanity? Yes, I suppose
it is necessary. You must pardon my saying it â I am rather
conservative, you know â but don't you think, considering your
nearness to me, you might leave out that stuff about Menihan?
Oh, well, it's your own story! I never met a newspaper man
yet that could see the advisibility of cutting his stuff. That's
a good touch about Leary. Think it'll have any effect? That's
a strong ending terse, reticent. Oh, come now, you're not going
to spoil it by adding that "Later" postscript! Don't. Take a
friend's ad ice. I may not have had your experience in news
paper work, but I assure you it spoils the effect. I appeal to
any man of taste. What an obstinate fellow you are! What's
that mark at the end?
The Suicideâ That's a cut-off mark.
l>eathâ And it signifies? V
The Suicideâ The end. ,

he could do nothing for me. I have I
even been answering advertisements >
in order to obtain a position as a j
housemaid, and would have done any
kind of honest work in order that the
children at Healdsburg might not suf
fer. The mere fact of my applying for
work of this description seemed to
crush all the spirit out of John, al
though I told him that it was abso
lutely necessary that the children
should have food and clothing. I am
quite certain that The Call people
could not have known what his story
was to be, for he was not the kind of I
man to give any one his confidence." I
The suicide of Livernash and the
circumstances which led up to it was !
the main topic of conversation along!
the water front yesterday. It appears j
that before he left his office, he swept
and garnished it ready for his succes
sor. During the day he borrowed a
hose from the schooner Gteogie Woods j
and washed the place thoroughly, both
inside and out. He then cleaned the
windows and polished the office stove.
His last act was to place a bunch of
flowers on his desk before leaving the
office. He then bade all of his wharf
acquaintance a laughing good-by and
left for' his home.
Livernash has always been consid
ered as "queer" by all the habitues of
the water front. When visiting the of
fices of other wharfingers and collect
ors, he would sometimes sit gazing into
space for an hour at a time, never
speaking a word. For the last few
days he had been drinking heavily and
appeared to be under a severe nervous
strain.
The Knights of Pythias have taken
charge of the remains, and to-day they
will be shipped to Healdsburg and be
buried in the same plat with his fa
ther and mother at Cloverdale.

POLICE AGAINST SUPERVISORS.
A Controversy Over the Quarters
for the Detention of the In
sane.
An Interesting conflict between the
Board of Supervisors and the Police De
partment has arisen over the recent ac
tion of the board in selecting quarters
for the detention of the insane.
The rooms chosen were those now occu
pied by the carpenter-shop of the Police
Department, and Chief Lees says he will
not give up the apartments.
A consultation between Health Officer
O'Brien. Chief Lees and Supervisor Clin
ton was held a few days ago, but no de
termination was arrived at, and the
police still hold possession of the rooms.
Chief Lees says that his men will not
vacate; Supervisor Clinton says they
must, and there the matter rests.
Supervisor Clinton has been advised
that he has a right to break in the door,
but he prefers to hear further from the
board before resorting to extreme meas
ures.
CORONER WILL
INVESTIGATE
Ethel Burtis Burried Yes
terday at Masonic
Cemetery.
Maud Dowel 1 Says That the
Deceased Never Used
Opiates.
Telegram From Her Lover Was
Received at the Morgue
Yesterday. #
The investigation of the mysterious
circumstances surrounding the death
of Ethel Burtis, the variety actress, as
told in yesterday's Call, has been taken
in hand by Coroner Hawkins. The pe
culiar action of all parties in connec
tion with the case In endeavoring to
to conceal the fact of three morphine
pills having been found under the dead
woman's pillow first aroused suspicion
that she had not died from natural
causes, and people who have known
her for many years assert that she was
unaccustomed to use the drug.
Miss Maud Dowell, one of Ethel Bur
tis' closest personal friends and a con
stant visitor to the sickroom of the
deceased woman, said last night: "I
have known Ethel Burtis for many
years and have never seen her use
opiates in any form. I do not believe
for one moment that she used mor
phine; had she done so I should have
been the first to have found rt out. I
was a constant visitor to her bedside
when she was sick, and she did not
appear to me to be in any danger of
death. I know that she was ill and did
not eat much, and she complained that
she was without a nurse to attend to
her at night. I think that the matter
should be investigated by the proper
authorities, as none of her friends can
account for the presence of morphine
under her pillow."
Coroner Hawkins has detailed Chief
Deputy Coroner McCormick on the
case, but he has not yet been able to
obtain a written statement about the
case from Dr. Martin. When seen
yesterday Dr. Hawkins said: "I have
taken the matter up and shall investi
gate it thoroughly. The fact of the
body having been embalmed adds con
siderable difficulty to the elucidation of
the mystery. If I obtain evidence which
in any way points to there having been
any foul play I shall order the body to
be exhumed and a complete chemical
analysis made. Until I have received
a written statement of the case from
Dr. Martin I cannot give my opinion on
the matter."
A telegram was received at the
Morgue yeterday from Ned* Foster,
who is at present in Alameda, which
read as follows: "I saw a notice in The
Call this morning. Am at Barnum's if
I am wanted."
Ethel Burtis was buried yesterday
afternoon at the Masonic Cemetery,
the casket being covered with flowers
sent by her many friends among the
variety artiestes in the city.
WAS TO BE ARBESTED
A Would Be Klondiker Who Forgot
All About a Medical Man's Bill.
An order of arrest was issued from the
Justice Court yesterday for J. S. Brown
lie, better known as "Jim" Brownlie, a
well-known barkeeper.
Brownlie has a brother on the Klondike
who owns several rich cfaims, and the
mixologist decided to join him there. He
secured a large number of dogs for the
trip and made ready to depart, when he
was confronted by Dr. T. H. Thompson,
who claimed that Brownlie owed him $&1
for medical services rendered.
Brownlle" had not been .arrested at a
late hour last night, and probably loft
for the Klondike before his importunate
creditor had a chance to interview him.

CYCLISTS ARE
DISSATISFIED
Trouble Over <fhe Washing
ton's Birthday Road
Race.
Many of the Wheelmen Fear to Ride
Against Wing In the Cup
Contest.
There is great dissatisfaction in the
ranks of the local cyclists over the big
meeting of the California Associated Cy
cling Clubs that is to be held on the San
Leandro triangle on Washington's birth
day.
The trouble, which will result in the
withdrawal or non-appearance of a large
number of the entries, comes from the
fact that a man has entered and will be
permitted to ride who is looked upon by
a majority of the riders as a profes
sional.
John Wing is the man who is objected
to and the objection lies in the fact that
in the latter part of last year he went on
the Washington-Oregon circuit with Per
cy Mott of the Reliance Club. On the re
turn of the pair Mott, who had ridden In
the same race with Wing, was profession
alized by the racing board of the Cycling
clubs, while Wing was allowed to go
scott free. It is believed and freely stated
that one was as guilty as the other, and
that if one was professionalized the other
should have been.
This fact, however, was not generally
known among local cyclists until it was
recently discovered that Wing was en
tered in the coming tournament. It is
feared by a number of the wheelmen who
have entered in the race that riding
against Wing will place them in danger
of being professionalized and many will
refuse to compete.
The Bay Cltys, who were considered
the strongest competitors In the race,
will not decline to ride against Wing, but
it is feared that the Acme and Reliance
teams will be crippled by the complica
tion. The race is for the Olympic Club
cup, which has been won once by the Bay
Citys, once by the Acme Club and onco
by the Imperials. Three wins are neces
sary to give any club the permanent
ownership of that trophy.
Swedish Glee Club.
A very successful dramatic entertain
ment, concert and ball was given by tho
Swedish Societies Glee Club at Union
Square Hall last night. The programme
was extremely interesting and the danc
ers were loth to leave their enjoyment
when the hour came for departure.

WAR OVER
ARCTIC TRADE
Retailers Say Whole
salers Are Cutting
Their Throats.
Local Merchants Will Buy
From Eastern Manu
facturers.
The City Is Full of Jobbers Who
Are Doing a Retail Busi
ness.
There is a war brewing between the
wholesalers and retailers of this city.
It all originated because the wholesal
ers are reaching out for some of the
Klondike plums.
While the retailers are unwilling to
speak right out in meeting they are
very sore over the fact that there are
a number of retail departments con
nected with various wholesale houses.
They say that such an arrangement
makes it impossible for them to have a
fair deal.
Speaking of the matter yesterday a
prominent retailer said: "There is a
movement under way for us to com
bine and buy our goods from Eastern
houses because a number of such firms
as Greenebaum, Weil & Michaels, Cluff
Bros., W. Cohen-Hirseh and C. E.
Whitney are trying to capture the re
tail business on the Klondike trade.
If those from whom we are buying
goods open to compete with us there is
nothing left for us to do except to buy
in the East and compete with them."
Speaking of the matter yesterday
Mr. Summerfleld of Summerfield & Ro
man said: "The wholesalers are fak
ers if they say they can sell any
cheaper than we can. The fact is, that
the wholesalers here interfere with
retailers shamefully in every line. The
result is that many of us now buy In
the East and the result will be to
drive the wholesalers out of business.
They cannot expect to hold customers
here if they themselves become retail
ers and therefore competitors."

fluenees he put to work, and, notwith
standing the teachings of religion and the
trouncings of revengeful civilization, the
natives of the far-off islands in the more
remote parts of the South Pacific still
hanker after the taste of human flesh,
and occasions will occur once in a while
that will cause the veneer of their newly
acquired semi-civilization to crack and
show the real cannibal that is hidden be
neath," said L. Maxwell, an old trader
from Tahiti, as he sat in the billiard
room of the Palace Hotel last night. "To
illustrate what I mean, I was at one of
the islands of the Solomon group about
a year ago looking for a chance to pick
up a cargo of copra. Quite a number of
the natives were sitting around discuss
ing the proposed trade, when one of the
young men, who had been fooling with a
sharp spear, accidentally cut himselfwith
it. The.wound was quite serious and bled
profusely. We tried to bind it up so as
to stop the flow of blood, but with poor
success. Finally one of the old fellows,
speaking in the native dialect, said: 'He
has stuck himself like a pig, now let us
eat him like one.' and, will you believe it,
we had to carry the unfortunate devil
aboard our schooner to prevent the
Christianized fiends from doing It. That
same island is reported by the mission
aries to be completely civilized and its
inhabitants among the most devout of
the converts in that part of the world."

Landlord Attempts to Hold Up the

Contract.
It seems doubtful if the San Francisco

It appears that nearly four years ago
the club leased its present premises from
a Miss Waters, who held a lease from the
owners for three years. When she pub
let the rooms to the club she gave the
members a five years' lease. At the end
of the second year of the lease BUM
Waters transferred her interest to a Mr.

the three-year lease expired, and "Walker

not legally bound to do so, and now they

A FAMOUS COACH ARRIVES.
Garrett Cochran, the famous end and ex-captain of the Prince
ton football team, who has been engaged to coach Berkeley, arrived in
the city yesterday morning. He was expected on Friday night, but
his train was delayed. Mr. Cochran looks much tHe same as he did
just before the Yale game, and in point of weight he is close to the
)0-pound mark. He is about six feet tall, has dark curly hair and
a pair of shoulders that are as broad as the continent. He is stock
ily built and his head is poised upon his body by a strong neck.
When seen yesterday he said: "I left Princeton about a month
ago to prepare to come here. My trip across was most delightful
and from all that 1 have so far seen of California I am much pleased."
When asked about his plans for training the Berkeley team he re
plied:
"I shall institute the system now in vogue at Princeton. I will en
deavor to get all of my material together and will start out with
light work on Monday. I shall establish the training table so as to
keep the men in condition, and will live in college where I can keep
them under close supervision.
"In regard to my system of coaching, I will say that in the last few
years there have been same radical changes made in the Eastern col
leges, and I shall follow these. We now give the men champagne to
drink when it is apparent that they are too fine, or else they are
taken from the training table and sent to the beÃt hotel where they
can get. rich food. An occasional pipe is not now considered injurious,
but the men are never allowed to eat pastry. The hours of work will
be arranged by a regular schedule, and the applicants for the team
will arise and go to bed at certain hours."
When questioned as to the purity of college athletics in the East,
Mr. C'ochran said: â¢'College athletics In the East are as pure as they
are here. No man can play upon a team there who does not pass a
certain grade In his studies."
Mr. Cochran will return to Princeton in June to receive his diplo
ma and will get back in time to start the football season with his
men. He has entirely recovered from his Injuries received in the great
game with Yale and declares that his broken shoulder is as well aa
ever.
"Just at present my condition is a little soft," he said, "but it will
not take me long to get In good shape."
During the game yesterday between Berkeley and the Alumni,
Cochran sat upon the players' bench and watched the contest closely,
but made no comments and would not discuss the game or fenuire
any opinions.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1898.
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
FOUND HIS
LOST BROTHER
Rev. C. C. Herriott's Proof
That He Acted
Rightly.
His Change of Faith Led to a
Meeting After Twenty-
Five Years.
One Brother Went Into the Ministry
and the Other Went to
Texas.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 19.
The change of belief of Rev. C. C.
Hcrriott of East Oakland, which was
made public last Aveek, has led to his
meeting with a brother who has been
using an assumed name and whom the
clergyman has not seen for a quarter
of a century. At the time he pro
claimed his disbelief in some of the
tenets of -the Presbyterian faith, Mr.
Herriott said he believed he was being
divinely led. Now he is sure of it.
The Herriott brothers parted twenty
five years ago and went different ways.
C. C. Herriott went into the ministry
and his brother, James, went to Texas
and horse training. A few days ago
Mrs. Herriott received a letter during
the absence of her husband. It stated
the fact that the writer was hard up
and not fixed for traveling; referred
to the fact that his landlady at Stock
ton was a grand Christian woman;
said he had seen an account of Rev.
Herriott's change of faith, and was
signed, "Your brother, James Henry."
Mr. Herriott at once concluded the
letter was from a crank and was sur
prised to learn the truth. According
to the pastor, his brother has had a
romantic existence during the last
twenty-five years.
"I met. my brother in Stockton last
Monday," said Rev. C. C. Herriott to-
day.
When we last heard from him he
was in Leadville, Colo., where he was
married. I was in Indianopolis, where
I had just begun my ministry. His
wife died and he came to this State.
He was a fine horseman and began the
training and taming of horses.
"He spent two years in Texas, but
returned and has resided in this State
ever since. He visited Oakland three
or four years ago, and tamed an ani
mal that killed its owner out on San
Pablo avenue. Like many another man
of his business, he drank some, but
was never what is called a bad fellow.
When I told him of his mother's death
he broke down and cried.
"He says his only reason for drop
ping part of his name was to lose his
identity on account of the loss of his
wife.
"He told me that when he read the
paper with my picture in it he turned
to the hotel clerk and said: 'That is
my brother and that is my last name.
I am going to write to him.' He did
so with the result asÂ» I have stated. Un
der these circumstances I feel that my
action regarding the Presbytery has
the divine approval. "
CHABGES COLLUSION.
Minority Directors of the Bank of
San Luis Obispo Ask for
Belief.
OAKLAND, Feb. 19â T. G. Wlckersham
has filed his . fourth amended complaint
against James L. Crittenden, W. S. Wil
son, Thomas T. Crittenden and the. Bank
of San Luis Obispo. He claims that he
brings the suit in behalf of the directors
of the bank â¢other "than the defendants,
and that he did not secure the directors'
permission to bring the suit, as it is their
acts of which he complains. Â; ; . .:.
, J. M. Wilcoxon and R. v. Bouldin are
the .'other directors, besides the defendants.
The complaint alleges that all of them
were elected in October, 1894, and have
been re-elected annually. The defendant,
James L. Crittenden was elected president
at a salary of $250 per month, W. S. Wil
eon cashier at $150 per month and T. T.
Crittenden bookkeeper at $100 per month.
It further- declares that all of the work
could be performed by one man; that
neither T. T. Crittenden nor W. 8. Wil
son own any stock, but simply hold in I
their names that of James L. Crittenden !
in order to vote; that they vote as he or
dors; refuse to attend j meetings when I
James L. Crittenden is absent; loan i
money to. themselves without security
and that two-thirds of the money af In
terest is so 'loaned, from which the bank
receives no Interest. Â» i
He then states that it is only a matter of

HIGH SCHOOL
FOR ELMHURST
The Growing Town Is at
Present at a Big
Disadvantage.
Pupils Have to Travel Either
to Haywards or to
Oakland.
Present School Building Large
Enough to Admit of the
Advance.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
&08 Broadway, Feb. 19.
Elmhurst is becoming ambitious.
Five years ago the pretty little town
on the San Leandro road did not ex
ist. Now it is a thriving center and
rapidly growing, and its latest idea is
that there should be a high school so
that its pupils will not be at a dis
advantage with those residing at
Fruitvale or Haywards.
One of the most earnest advocates of
the high school has issued the follow
ing argument in its favor:
That all public institutions should
be as centrally located as possible for
the accommodation of the majority of
the people is a point invariably con
ceded by all. For this and other rea
lowing reasons Elmhurst should have
a high school. No doubt Fruitvale will
succeed in her efforts to secure this
advantage for that district, and we
certainly hope such may be so, for
there arfe many pupils in that vicinity
ready to avail" themselves of the op
portunity which the advanced grade
affords. The limits will probably be
extended to High street or Fitchburg,
and will include a district sufficient in
size and population to need no divi
sion for many years, as would not be
the case should the limits be extended
to the boundary line of Haywards
district, which "lies between San Lo
renzo and San Leandro.
Elmhurst is located at an almost
equal distance between the present
limits of the Haywards and probable
extension of the Fruitvale limits, in
the best geographical center of popu
lation and is already able to provide
the costs of maintaining an advanced
school. This could be done at a much
lower figure than the costs of tuition
and carfare to two-thirds of the num
ber of pupils prepared to enter the
higher course at the opening of a new
term. It must be borne in mind that
the cost of carfare from San Leandro,
Elmhurst and Fitchburg is the same
to Fruitvale as to Oakland district,
while carfare to Elmhurst from any
one of the points In the proposed dis
trict is only 5 cents each way or one
half the cost to schools in other dis
tricts. However, the greater number
of pupils live within walking distance
of Elmhurst and could therefore avoid
this expense entirely, but it might
reasonably be supposed that should
this be the favored location, special
rates In fares might be secured by
this district.
For present needs we have grounds
large and ample and a school building
the pride of the whole community,
favorably constructed for an addition
or annex which would serve the pur
pose of the high school department
until the grammar grades might in
crease in numbers sufficient to till the
entire building, when other provision
might be made for a high school
building equal to that of any city on
the coast. With this proposition" the
present building could be made to fill
two necessities of the schools.
And by all means why should not
our progressive and prosperous young
town, which is known far and wide as
the best non-delinquent tax townâ not
only in Alameda County but in all
Californiaâ be most worthily awarded
this grand free advanced educational
facility?

THE HORIZON
IS WIDENING
Political Aspirants Are
Looking Outside the
County.
Alameda Realizes That the
Rest of the State Has
a Voice.
New Phase Comes Over the Family
Struggle for the Governor
ship.
Oakland Office, San Francisco Call, j
908 Broadway, Feb. 19.
A new complexion is now worn by :
! the gubernational situation In this i
' county and it has added additional ln
i terest to the family complication. The â 
, political managers have at last ac- |
i knowledged that to nominate a man |
for Governor is the business of a â¢
â  State convention and not the preroga- |
tive of a county tea party.
It has taken the politicians a long
| time to realize this, but the point has â¢
I been reached at last and although the
balance of the State has for a long ,
; time considered Alameda County as a
| factor in the State fight, it has only
! just dawned upon Alameda tfhat the
balance of the State is a factor also.
The lines along which the battle will
be fought will henceforth be different
i than in the past.
While the Pardee men are proposing
harmony between the two candidates
: for Governor, the Davis men are de- !
dining to notice any such overtures,
! and both are working steadily ahead.
The Pardee men have great hopes of ;
I carrying the county and believe that if
! they can go into the State convention
: with the one cry of Pardee they will
1 be able to make trades that will land
i their man a winner. This is, how
i ever, impossible, for L. H. Brown has j
â¢ already done some work In the inter
| lor of the county and more than one j
1 of the townships is claimed, and not j
without some reason, by the Davis
forces.
The Livermore Herald, which exer- I
I cises a big influence in that end of the j
' county, raises the name of Davis at |
! the head of its editorial page and is |
'â  making an aggressive fight for its man. j
' The other interior, papers are discreetly j
i non-committal. Their position was j
! thus described by a township editor ,
i this week: "We are on the fence," he
! said, "as between Davis and Pardee,
! because we have an eye to the county
fight and cannot afford to be too inde- !
â  pendent regarding the Governor. AH |
; of which means that the support of the
interior papers will depend largely on i
! the combinations between the State j
and county tickets.
This is the way a political writer in
the Davis camp expresses the situa-
tion:
What Alameda- County needs to do just
now however, is to broaden its horizon.
One swallow never yet made a spring.
This little local delegation is not going to
nominate anybody. It cannot nominate a
Governor all by itself. Alameda County
has spent so much time looking at itself
that it is losing sight of the greater po
litical horizon of the State.
It iÂ« time the politician was asking some
pertinent questions. What are the other
fifty-six counties of the State willing to
do? What do they want? How far will
they help? . _ .
It is high time Alameda County began
to recognize the rights of the sister coun
ties and to get a proper adjustment of
her relations to the whole State.
This is just what Alameda is doing
and it remains t<> be seen whether work
in the county almost exclusively, or
work outside the county will be more
successful at the State convention.
DOLE ENTERTAINED.
Oaklanders Do Honor to Hawaii's
President.
OAKLAND, Feb. 19.â President Dole ar
rived here this afternoon with his wife,
and this evening he was tendered a recep
tion at the house of the Alexanders on
Sixteenth and Filbert streets.
The guests were driven to the residence
of Mr. and Mrs. Charles M. Cooke on
Vernon street, corner of Perkins. The
train was about two hours late, having '
been detained in the mountains by snow, i
and consequently did not reach Sixteenlh i
street station until 11 o'clock.
This afternoon President Dole and wife \
were driven over the hills In the suburbs
and the resider.ee districts under the di- ;
rection of city officials and representa- j
tives of the Merchants' Exchange and
the Board of Trade. There were present
Mayor Thomas, Mr. and Mrs. Charles M.
Cooke, Mr. and Mrs. S. T. Alexander,
President Taylor and Secretary Sharp of ;
the Board of Trade, Vice-President |
Brown and Secretary Pearce of the Mer- !
chants' Exchange. City Attorney Dow
and City Engineer Clement. The drive
lasted an hour and a half, at the end of ;
which time President Dole was driven to j
Mr. Alexander's residence.
Engagement of Julius Abrahamson.
OAKLAND, Feb. 19.â The engagement
of Julius Abrahamson to Miss Rebecca
Phillips of San Francisco was made pub
lic this afternoon. The young gentleman
is one of Oakland's best known mer
chants and leaders in Jewish society.
He is also a worker in the synagogue.
His betrothed is the daughter of F. Phil
lips, a retired merchant, and is well
known in this city. She is a pretty
blonde and a talented musician, with
membership in several of the leading or
ganizations in the city of her home.
The Legality of Annexation.
OAKLAND. Feb. 19.âThe suit to deter
mine the legality of the annexation of the
territory north of the old city limits was
submitted to Judge Hall to-day after ar
guments had been made. The principal
point of contention is the legality of in
corporating territory already incorporat
ed. That is. the including of sanitary dis
tricts and parts of districts within a mu
nicipal corporation. The city held that the
latter act did not conflict with any of the
duties or powers of the former. A deci
sion will not be rendered for some time.
Boxing Matches Arranged.
OAKLAND. Feb.. 19.â Wednesday even
ing next will witness a scientific boxing
match at the Reliance Club rooms. Marty
McCue of New York and Jimmie Law
lor are to be the principals. Each will

"You will never see anything
about the savings which I myself
secured for the State by the inaugur
ation of a bureau of supplies, with
a purchasing agent under heavy
bonds empowered to make all pur
chases of supplies and issue them to
different departments only upon
requisitions properly signed by the
respective superintendents. After
this bureau had been in operation for
six months I had an expert account
ant go over the vouchers for the six
months preceding and make a com
parison. The saving per month was
within a few dollars of the combined
salaries of the three Commissioners,
or close to $800. This report was
read in open meeting, but no line of
it has ever appeared in the public
prints. That must be my excuse for
mentioning it here."
Extract from Harbor Commis
sioner Colnon's correspondence to a
Fresno paper upon the merits of
his Bureau of Supplies. A few days
after writing this he was obliged to
suspend Purchasing Agent Peter
son while investigating charges of
jobbery in this department.
If the investigation Into the affaira
of the State Board at Harbor Commis
sioners continues much longer there is
no telling what m.iy be developed. W.
H. Peterson, the purchasing agent of
the commission, and J. J. Kelly, a
sweeper on Missiota-street wharf, are
under suspicion a:,d the books of the
former are n<rw in the hands of the
board's expert accountant, Mr. Har
ries, who Is endeavoring to get at the
bottom of the rottenness in that de
partment. While no formal charges
have been made against Peterson, he
has been accused of having exacted a
commission frfrm all with whom he
gave the State's patronage and to such
an extent that even the president of
the board, Mr. Colnon, was obliged to
take cognizance of the many rumors
of the open and bold stand-up methods
of his subrrrdinate.
The bureau of supplies and the office
of purchasing agent were creations- of
the commisioner from Stockton, and
it was said at the time that this was
necessary in order to make a place for
political friends, for there are subordin
ates in that department. Formerly re
quisitions for the necessaries of the
several departments were made direct
from the heads thereof to the board,
but when the bureau was instituted
the heads of departments were obliged
to make their requisitions to the pur
chasing agent, whose duty it was and
is to go here and there and buy what
was required at the best possible fig
ures for the State. The former pur
chasing agent was S. J. Westlake, and
from all accounts he served the inter
ests of the taxpayers by his good judg
ment and economy. Why he was dis

tfli of women are more
\(/l( flJMwmlm than h ? lf unknown and un-
sensitiveness of their or-
1^ ganism lays them liable to
a thousand exquisite tortures which a
coarser nature can never experience or
comprehend.
The least derangement or disorder of the
delicate special organism of their sex over-
whelms the whole physical and mental be-
ing with weakness and wretchedness.
But it is a mistake to suffer these troubles
in silence. They may be cured in the per-
fect privacy of home, without the repugnant
ordeal of examinations and "local treat-
ment," which the family doctor is sure to
insist upon.
No physician in the world has had a wider
or more successful experience in the treat-
ment of woman's diseases than Dr. R. V.
Pierce, chief consulting physician to the
Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, of
Buffalo, N. Y. His "Favorite Prescription "
is a positive cure for the most obstinate and
complicated feminine difficulties.
It is the only medicine of its kind pre-
pared by an educated, skilled physician.
Mr. J. F. Sneed, of Omen, Texas, writes : " My
wife was badly afflicted with female weakness.
We tried three of the best physicians in the
country without benefit, but at jjreat expense.
My wife grew worse, and we gave up lv de-
spair. She could not get in and out of doors
without help; was not able to stand on her feet
long at a time, complained of dragging down
pains in abdomen. Nothing but an untimely
death seemed awaiting her, when â happy
thought ! â the name ofDr. Pierce came to my
mind. I wrote to Dr. Pierce received his advice,
followed it, my wife improved perceptibly from
the first two week's treatment, continued the
treatment six months, and pronounced the cure
complete, at a cost of less than one month's treat-
ment by the last physician we employed before
consulting Dr. Pierce. She used Dr. Pieree's Fa-
vorite Prescription and the lotions recommended
by him. It has been two years since, and the
good effect is permanent."
missed from this position is not known.
A year ago W. H. Peterson was given
the place, and according to the ac
counts of his stewardship, the cause
of the present investigation, he has
been grabbing with both hands ever
since.
Peterson's perquisites seem to have
been the commissions that he could
squeeze from the trades-people with
whom he did business. If the stories of
his business methods be true, Peterson
Was too shrewd to attend to the com
missitrn business in person, always
sending some one to pull the chestnuts
from the fire for him. One of these was
J. J. Kelly, a sweeper on the wharf,
and on this account Kelly has been
made to suffer with the other. The
salaries of the two men were fair,
Peterson's being $175 per month and
that of Kelly $75, but it is said that
the perquisites, especially of the form
er, was far in excess of the salary.
Among those who did not think they
were being fairly treated in the mat
ter of the State"s patronage was John
Crockard of the firm of H. Crockard
&. Co., 216 Steuart street. For the past
eight years this firm has furnished the
bulk of the iron, bolts, toggles, links,
etc., to the Harbor Commission, and to
all accounts he gave good satisfaction.
A while ago the work was taken from
him and given to a shipsmith named
Tom Rollins, whose place is on Broad
way, between Davis and Front. During
the time that the Crockards had the
work they learned a thing or two, and
they are said to have spoken their
minds on more than one occasion. Their
remarks reached the ears of the Har
bor Commissioners, that is, the ears
of Commissioner Colnon, and he
decided that it was time to take a hand
in the matter in order to prevent any
more scandals in the body over which
he presided as chairman. He sent for
John Crockard, and the two had a long
conversation and the shipsmith is said
to have given such information as to
make any attempt on the part of the
commissioner to conceal the facts and
protect Peterson an impossibility. That
was on last Wednesday, and on the fol
lowing day he set the board's expert to
work on the books.
It seems that in the meantime Peter
son had got word that there was trou
ble ahead, and that Crockard had been
talking, and in order to close Crock
ard's mouth he sent word to him that
if he would not say anything more he
would give back to the Crockards the
trade they had for so many years. This
came too late, for the egg had been laid
and begun to hatrh. The following day
the expert took the books and Mr. Pet
erson was relieved from his duties as
purchasing agent for the board. The
commissioners have not been inclined
to say anything about the matter, and
when pressed for a reason for Peter
son's absence from the purchasing bu
reau, said it was on account of "politi
cal reasons." What Crockard told the
commissioners may never be told, but
at any rate it made a shaking of dry
bones for a time, for with Peterson's
suspension Kelly walked the plank,
and it is doubtful if he ever gets back
to his job again.
In addition to the "commission cinch"
on all trade of the State, there ate
grave rumors that iron, lead, brass and
other stores of the board have disap
peared from the shelter of the purchas
ing bureau, but these may have been
taken by the many bay pirates who in
fest the water front, and Mr. Peterson
may have felt their loss as keenly as
any one. Accountant Harries may be
able to get on the track of some of this
property â in some of the city front
Junk shops.
There is a manifest disposition on the
part of those who know the most about
the crookedness to say as little as pos
sible, for a strong effort is being made
to save Peterson. This may be accom
plished, but it will be at the sacrifice
of Kelly, and perhaps Crockard, whom it
is rumored are to be made the scape
goats in the case. The latter, when in
formed yesterday what was in the
wind, became very indignant and said:
"That fellow Peterson is no good. He
has insulted me and my brother and
ordered us from his office. I am not
sorry if he does get pinched, for he de
serves all that they can give him, but
I am sorry for poor little Kelly. He
was obliged to do just as Peterson told
him. It was just as though I was go
ing to buy four cigars for fifty cents
for you and should send one of my men
out to do the errand. When he came
back he would hand over four five
centers and I would make him give the
difference to me. That was Peterson
and Kelly. I do not want to talk, and
I will not, but if that fellow Peterson
attempts to clear himself at my ex
pense I will tell a few things that will
drive him into his hole so deep that he
will never come out again. I vi" not
tell now what I told to Commissioner
Colnon but if he compels me to, I will
tell more that I told to the Commis
sioner. I have not done anything that
I am ashamed of and my books will
show that I have done a straight busi
ness."
Meanwhile the office, or Bureau of
Supplies, is in the hands of a new lot
of men. William Angier is filling Pet
erson's place and a man named Ingram
is attending to Kelly's duties, while
Expert Harris has full swing of the
whole place. What he has found or
will find is not likely to be the subject
of correspondence to any more country
newspapers.
There are not many people who are
aware that Harbor Commissioner Col
non had taken upon himself the re
sponsibilities of being a correspondent
for a country newspaper. This he did
recently, apparently to convince the
people of the State or certain portions
thereof, that he was not so badly mixed
up in the Harbor Commission scandals
as the witness in the parafflne paint
case made him out to be. He wrote a
four-column article to the Fresno Ex
positor, which he had copied in the
Stockton Mail, in which he attempted
to show what excellent work the pres
ent board is doing, and how much it is
saving to the taxpayers of the State.
In that article he hits hard at the city
press for not telling how much good
work is being done, and says:
You will never see anything about the
savings which I myself secured for the
State by the inauguration of a bureau of
supplies, with a purchasing agent under
heavy bonds empowered to make all pur
chases of supplies and to issue them to
different departments only on requisitions
properly signed by the respective super
intendents. After this bureau had been
in operation six months I had an expert
accountant go over the vouchers for the
six months preceeding and make a com
parison. The saving per month was
within a few dollars of the combined sal
aries of the three commissioners, or close
to $SOO. This report was read in open
meeting, but no line of it has ever ap
peared in the public prints. That must
be my excuse for mentioning it here.
Had not this been written a few days
before Shipsmith Crockard gave away
the snap of the Bureau of Supplies,
Commissioner Colnon's excuse for
writing at, all would never have been
made.

"TAUPOS" IN SAMOA
Exciting Scenes Attending the Great
Gift Ceremonial
DON'T you want to see the
Ta'alnlo?" asked our chief. I
should think we did want to see
a Ta'alolo! Had we not heard
the most tantalizing, accounts of
this tri ft ceremonial of Samoa
when contribution* of food are brought
to some honored recipient to be after
ward divided among the attendant
throng with much Joy and revelry?
Now at last our chance had come; the
village of Safata, on the opposite side
of the island, was having a Ta'alolo
for the benefit of King Malietoa at
Mulfnu, and off we were, driving
througrh Apia to that dingiest of royal
suburbs. To-day Mulinu is en fete and
thrmgs of natives, in gala attire, stalk
beneath its cocoanut palms.
Hundreds of small basketsâ the green
cocoanut leaf baskets so rapidly woven
by the natives â are set out before certain
huts. They contain the offerings of
divers villages toward the festivities,
and a spokesman gabbles over their
contents with comments which pro
vokes roars of laughter from the ini
tiated; but to us, who know only our
set phrases in the Samoan tongue, the
vociferous reiteration of so many fish,
breadfruit, pigs, tares, cocoanuts,
packets of fai'ai (cocoanut creams)
grows at last wearisome and monoto
nous as Mark Twain's cow. The sun is
pouring down midday rays, the tour
ists are rushing off to lunch, and cer
tain inner sensations suggest that their
independence of character is enviable;
but how are we to combine sight-see
ing with lunch? We came forth to see
a Ta'alolo, and see it we -.vill, though we
starve in this land of plenty.
Suddenly relief comes from unexpect
ed quarters. One of the green creels is
laid at our feet. As a chief's friends,
forming nominally a portion of his
family, we are expected to accept and
carry away its contents, with full lib
erty to hand them over should the sup
ply not prove to our taste. Further
more, our immediate necessities are
met by the invitation to join said chief
in the crowded hut, where he squats,
revelling in heat and smoke and the
smell of cocoanut oil. We are a great
deal too hungry to demur, so we squat
on a mat beside him and enjoy our
first Samoan picnic off banana leaves
and plaited dishes. The food is good if
the manner of eating be scrambling.
We shut our eyes to the fact that
though fingers are used for all purposes
the usual bowl of water is conspicuous
by its absence and we meekly accept
the titbits of pig, fish, breadfruit and
fai'ai that are clawed and handed to
,?is. One special honor, however, proves
too much for my civilized prejudices, <
Our hnst, in full career of enjoyment, j
gnawing a succulent bone, suddenly
stops short and holds out the delicate
morsel at arm's length. I naturally
accept this as an attention to the pet
dog on my lap. So does the dog, who
lifts up her eager jaws. But the tempt
ing morsel is angrily withdrawn and
once more thrust in my face. This
time, alas, I understand! The delicacy
ie so irresistibly delicious that I am
requested to share it. I deeply regret
to have to add that at this juncture
my manners take flight and I develop
an ungracious aversion to pork. Where
upon my neighbor, at once distressed
and relieved, at once returns to his
bone with the gusto of one who feels
rewarded for virtuous self-denial.
The heat increases, likewise the
aroma of cocoanut oil and stale to
bacco. Every one is satiated, even
chatter flags. The women have ex
hausted their energies in examining
my washing gloves, the material ofmy
dress, the cut of my hat, which difl#rs
from what they wear to church on Sun
days. Life falls flat and we are specu
lating whether after all there be any
thing in a ta'alolo, when a distant
sound r,f singing floats over the waters
and with a Samoan equivalent for
"They come! The boats come!" there
is a sudden stampede toward the shore.
We follow, excited and curious, eager
to study the "they" who have kept us
waiting so long. The holiday makers
line the shore flvp and six deep, rais
ing themselves up wherever there is a
fallen tree or charred stump. The
waters of the lagoon, circled by palms,
stretch away, a lake of placid blue, to
where a dark line and snowy curvet
ting "sea horses" indicate the reef. A
fleckless blue o'erhead, a fleckless blue
at our feet, and quivering on the balmy
air the sound of the boat song. Then,
with a -rapid swoop, rounding Mulinu
Point like huge sea birds, come skim
ming the long, white boats, their o.irs
dipping in even cadence with th^
measured, monotonous chant of the
rowers. With flags flying and snowy,
red-edged awnings shimmering in the
sun glare, the bronzed, green-garlanded
rowers bend to their work in pairs â
ten, fifteen, twenty oars on each side
splashing In the blue. On the prow of
the nearest boat stands Silenus In per-
Bon, with a short kilt of stiff siapo,
gaudy necklace and wild wreath r.f
shaggy leaves. He is the official jester
of his village, and as he brandishes a
huge knife he cuts strange capers,
turns his face to the shore crowd and
Jeers at them in sallies that provoke
peals of merriment.
When his thirty-six rowers shoot
past, amid applause, a South Sea vision
bursts upon vs â youth at the prow and
pleasure at the helm sailing into our
daily prose. The following boat has a
figurehead sprung from a poet's dream
â the Safata Taupo, her limbs veiled In
filmy drapery that floats on the breeze,
h^r bust garlanded with green, a Greek
fillet confining her hair. Calm and
smiling, her classic profile and ex
quisite form standing out like an an
tique statue against the all-enveloping
blue, she floats past. Hshtly tossing her
knife in time to the rhythm of her forty
v. hite-turbaned rowers, and the chant
of her rowers is light and cheery â In
harmony with the nymph of light and
foam who guides them.
After this comes the largest boat of
all, fifty rowers, their scarlet turbans
blinding brilliantly with their tawny
skins, their chant slow and sonorous;
but these have no figurehead and po
etry seems t<r have passed them by.
Finally the brilliant procession winds
up with the gay little boat of the
American consulate in which sits the
white-robed figure of the American
Consul's wife, a newcomer, as eagerly
curious as ourselves.
There !s nothing more to be seen for
the present and we wander back to our
appointed hut; but a glow of romance
has fallen upon us and the every-day
chatter, the smoking and the glare have
grown Ipss wearisome. The gliding
picture we have watched was worth
hours of endurance, so we sit down
placidly to await further progress of
events and gaze out at the groups of
Samoan lads gathered under the awn
ings of their boats. Presently the pro
ceedings are diversified; the public jes
ter, an elderly gentleman who has
been running about in a faded loincloth,
hands our chief a letter which is duly
read aloud. It is a political circular,
bearing reference to the relations be
tween Tainasese, "the pretender," and
Malietoa, the reigning monarch. It is
heard in dignified silence, but an ex
pression of profound annoyance rests
on most faces, for the occupants of
the hut are all loyal and the festival
is in honor of their King. At the end
of the reading there is a low, general
murmur, an expression of loyalty of
â which the reader is made the mouth
piece. Then, after divers whispered
preliminaries, the public OTator arises
in his full dignity of well nigh six feet
and steps out from the house, prepared
to arrest, with stentorian tones, the at
tention of that open-air assembly.
The orator chief is a never-to-be for
gotten sight, as he stands, his bust
thrown forward, leaning on his long,
black staff of office. His lava-lava, of
brown crackling ciapo, to which his
wife gave dainty artistic touches as he
emerged, from the shadow of the hut,
falls Stiffly, scarcely displaying his
tattooed knees; above, a fine mat,
edged with red and white parrakeet
feathers, stands out like a ballerina's
frill and is bound round his waist with
soft white siapo; a scarlet pandanus
necklace hangs from his throat and a
native cigarette is thrust behind his
ear. As he utters his short, crisp sen
tences with long intervening pause, he
occasionally, by way of emphasis,
brings down his fly-flapper on his slapo
with a startling bang. Save for this
his periods flow in a wearisome mono
tone, the wards "Tamasese. Malietoa.
Laupepa," repeatedly enlightening us
as to the nature of his discourse.
And the people listen In silence, and
; the dogs and the hens peck and play
i and tussle around. As for the pips,
I they have all disappeared into the
i green baskets.
At length it is over; to us it seems to
have lasted an hour. The orator re-en
â¢ ters the hut for a well-earned rest and
the kava bowl appears upon the scenes
with much clapping of hands. Then
the jester returns, announcing, in wh;tt
can only be described as a stupendous
j bawl, that the kava is ready, and his
i jests on the subject are fast and furi
ous, recurring with the name of each
i chief to which the drinking-cup is pre
i sented. Scarce has the festive bowl
I been solemnly discussed â kava drink
ing always seems a solemn function,
I despite jests and jesters â when the
; sound of bugle, drum and cracked fife
is heard, a general rush follows, and
j the two burly native policemen grow
< excitedly busy, cuffing their neighbors
I right and left to clear the way. We
! share the excitement, and, being privi
1 leged papalangi, rush forward to stare
down the road.
Ye god 9! As I gaze at the advancing:
| whirl I am lifted away from the palms
I and ferns of the Pacific to the firs and
heather of bonnie Scotland. The High
land blood flowing in my veins runs
riot, as the shades of my wild ances
try arise; kilts are tossing, dirks flash
ing, limbs flying in a weird maze before
my eyes, the whoop of the reel and
the drone of the pipe is in my ears.
Then, as the human mass whirls
nearer, I rub my eyes, take cognizance
of the non-Highland strain In my veins,
and devoutly hope my ancestry were
not as these. For the approaching fig
ures are grotesque, the dirks are but
butchers' knives, and the display, on
closer acquaintance, is first cousin to
a Christmas pantomime. On they
come, with a forward rush and a back
ward rush, and a series of cries and a
series of capers, their shred-ba
nana-leaf wreaths and tow-colored
wigs giving them a demon-like appear
ance. I have a personal acquaintance
with those wigs, and their high-mir
rored adornment, sticking up like
Prince of Wales' feathers! I saw one
of them the other day ignominiously
hung out to dry in our garden plotâ a
series of strung pieces of human hair
stretched out on the washing-line. But
now the wigs wear their official man
ners, and they are whirling, skirmish
ing, advancing, retreating, pursuing,
performing their part in a mimic fight.
One wig-wearer throws away the knife
and falls in a mock swoon, only to re
vive suddenly and join in the melee.
On it comes, steadily on with an ebb
and flow like that of the sea waves,
and the advancing, gesticulating
threatening figures exercise a strange
fascination. It is the fascination of the
pythoness, the dancing dervish, the
Shaker and Salvationist; a panic seizes
me lest I, too, should be smitten with
the frenzy and drawn into that caper
ing mass. And as some outrunners
come leaping and bounding toward me,
flourishing clubs, I meekly and hastily
, retreat to the side.
On they come, one In advance, others
In hot pursuit, others again playing the
part of franc-tireurs to scare the spec
tators. "But where," I ask in blank
disappointment, "where are the tau
pos?"
"In front, of course," is the answer
f>nd then it dawns upon me that two
of the wig-wearers are women, play
ing the role of pursued maidens. Never
suroly was maiden more willingly pur
sued; the first, a plump little damsel
somewhat heavily built, takes flight
with a comfortable jogtrot, a smile on
her lipsâ her immediate pursuer limps
so as not to overtake her too readily
Fhe it Is. indeed, who acted the swoon
and came round so readily. Strictly
speaking I suppose the young lady's
dress could scarcely be termed modest,
seeing that it is well nigh conspicuous
by its absence, though to be sure her
head is sufficiently disguised to make
up for the rest and looks like a guards
man's bearskin dyed yellow; her bust
and ankles are carefully wreathed but
her leaf girdle floats loosely over' the
merest apology for a black lava-lava
Yet, as a matter of fact, her attire only
strikes me in the light of a very lib
eral display of tights at an open-air
performance. This coy but willing
maiden coquettes and ambles to and
fro in exasperating fashion till at
length her adoring pursuer loses pa
tience and a mimic struggle ensues
Then she gives in. with womanly pro
test, her pursuer's supporters rush for
ward in glee, and the next bewigged
lass comes on, tripping through the
same performance. Last of all comes
the real Taupo, our Nymph o-f the
Prow, who has adhered to her Greek
fillet and who is drapod in a long, light
lava-lava. Her tall figure is of a dif
ferent mold, her delicate Roman profile
is not marred by heavy lip or flattened
nostril; despite her claim to a pure Sa
moan origin some alien white blood
surely flows in her veins. Unlike the

others, she glides and sways away from
her pursuer with graceful, undulating
motion, and when at last she turns
upon him she wields her knife with a
pretty gesture and stubbornly fights to
the bitter ( ?) end. It comes to her, as
to the rest, and then the dancing pro
cession brpaks up. Its members pile
their ecmtribution of green baskets and
the crowd disperses.
Those who remain are staying for
the speechifying and feasting, the bone
gnawing and kava-drinking, and the
sMvfi dancing which will while away th^
night. We drive home along the blue
lagoon. And in the shadow of bread
fruit and palm, orange and hibiscus we
dream of a troop of wild warriors
whirling and whooping, and of a Sea
Nymph with her sweet face upturned to
the blue sky. her diaphanous draperies
floating on the balmy breeze.
ROSE DE BOHEME.
COLONY FOR REFORMING DRUNKARDS.
The most original of all schemes to re
claim the drunkard is tha: of theKeswick
Colony of New Jersey, which Is located
at Gibersons Mills, the southern part of
the State. The founder is William Raws,
who. with his wife, has conducted the
famous "Whatsoever Mission" in Ger
mantown. The scheme has received the
indorsement of several ministers, and is
in practical operation, apparently with
encouraging success.
The tract purchased for the use of the
colony at Gibersons Mills contains 421
acres, of which twenty-five acres is
cleared land, on which corn, potatoes,
beans and other vegetables can be suc
cessfully cultivated. There is also In the
tract an orchard, cranberry bog. 300 acres
of fine timber and any number of huckle
berry bushes. The beautiful surround
ings^ pure air, etc., are regarded as aids
in upbuilding men, and they exercise a
quickly perceptible influence on those
who come to the place as physical
wrecks.
There are several buildings on the
place, and a number of additional dwell
ings will be built in the spring, the lum
ber for which will be cut on the tract
and sawed into boards at the old mill,
which is run by water power.
The timber is now being cut up Into
cordwood by the colonists, who will thus
be kept employed all winter. The lake is
well stocked with pike, and supplies the
residents with many a toothsome repast.
One of the colonists is an electrician, and
he is now arranging to set up an electric
plant, to be operated by water power, so
that all of the dwellings can be lighted
by electricity.
The governing principle of the colony is
Christianity. All the men enjoy the ut
most freedom. They are impressed in
various ways with the idea that there is
no man too far gone to be made right,
and the results have shown that at Kes
wick men can break away from the drink
habit and become useful, self-respecting,
industrious citizens.
The Bible is the Book of Rules â the
court of last resort. From it there is
no appeal. Religious meetings are held
daily, and all the influences are elevating.
The colonists have all things in common.
They are given homes, food and cloth
ing. Whatever they earn goes into the
general fund for maintaining and extend
ing the work. Should any one desire to
leave the colony and seek employment
elsewhere he is aided in every way. No
stumbling blocks are placed in the road
of possible success.
If a man makes the attempt and falls
by the wayside he is taken back and
given another chance to reform. No mat
ter how often he succumbs to the tempta
tion to lead a dissolute life, he is given
to understand that he is free to return
to Keswlck and try again. The gates are
never closed against any one who is ani
mated by a desire to reform. But one
thing is demanded of the applicant, and
that is sincerity. If he is in earnest he
will find every one ready to lend him a
helping hand.
It is asserted that if no American
meat were imported into the London
market for two days the price of all
kinds of meat would go up, and that
if the American supply were entirely
cut off. famine prices would soon be
in force, so large is the quantity con
sumed.

PLACED UNDER
THE POPE'S BAN
Outcome of a Story Started by a Countess
â â¢ â  That the Real : Leo XIII Is a Prisoner
'in the Vatican Md a Bogus Pope
Reigns mi His Place,
THE Pope has Just issued a cir
cular to the Catholic world
warning his people against ac
cepting as authentic any state
ments about himself that ap
pear in a new paper issued in
Rome and called Le Petit Moniteur de
Rome The paper recently started the
story that the real Pope, Leo XIII, is a
prisoner in the Vatican, while a bogus
Pope reigns in his stead. In issuing
this warning the Vatican authorities
claim to have exposed a great fraud
that might have become as serious as
that of Diana Vaughan and her revela
tions of the devil worshipers. Connect
ed with this story of fraud is the well
known Contessa Carolina de Saint-Ar
naud. It is said that several million
dollars has been collected from the
faithful on the pretense of using the I
money to tree the imprisoned Pope.
Leo XIII. the Contessa avers, was
imprisoned about ten years ago be
cause of the liberality of his attitude !
toward the Italian Government and his \
espousing of certain modern Ideas an
tagonistic to the reactionary element
of the College of Cardinals. The Pope
is, she says, imprisoned in a vault di
rectly under the apartments which he
occupied in the Vatican palace, and but
two persons know the intricate wind
ings which lead to his prison.
He has as his fellow-captive the loug
lost Archduke John of Austria, who is
held by his enemies for similar political
purposes. This scion of royalty was, as
is well known, entirely out of Joint with
his time, and on more than one occa
sion was threatened by the Emperor
Francis Joseph with arrest for high
treasoh. He disappeared some twelve
yean ago, and the published statement
oi Contessa Arnaud that he is confined
in a secret dungeon of the Vatican has
caused quite a sensation in European
circles.
Wild and impossible as these accusa
tions may appear, the Contessa counts
her believers by the hundreds, and so
plausible is her story, backed by all
manner of sworn documents purport
ing to come from Monsignori one time
in the Pontifical service, that she has
collected large amounts to aid in lib
erating the imprisoned head of Chris
tendom. The Vatican authorities are
intenseiy annoyed because of the name
she has given her organ, Le Petit Mon-
Iteur de Rome. The Moniteur de Rome
was at one time the official publication
of the Pope. It was suspended by the
Italian Government about four years
ago, but there has lately been some
talk of re-establishing it. The Vatican
authorities fear that the hostile utter
ances of the Contessa may gain cre
dence in some quarters owing to the
similarity of the name. The church
dignitaries in this country do not an
ticipate any difficulty in disproving the
assertion of the Contessa.
The Countess de Arnaud is a well
known character on the Continent.
She is the daughter of the late Duke
of Modena and a lady of his court said
to be allied to the reigning house of
Bavaria. The Duke was of Austrian
parentage and connected collaterally
with the house of Hapsburg. He was
also brother-in-law to the late Count
de Chambord, the Pretender to the
French throne, known among the legit
imists as Henry V.
The mother of the Contessa died at
her birth, and she was brought up by
her aunt, the Princess Massimo, in
Rome. Here the young girl was a
great social favorite. She was pretty
and vivacious, and according to rumor
counted her admirers by the score. She
never married, however, but was con
tent to be for many years the most ad
mired of the many belles at the then
brillinat Pontifical court. During the
regime of Cardinal Antonella, the
Secretary of State for Pius IX, the
home of the Princess Massimo excelled
all other Roman palaces for its lavish
entertainments, and frequently the en
tire court of Pius was entertained by
herself and the charming young Con
tessa de Arnaud. But the Contessa
Evil Spirits AttacKing a Victim.
liked gorgeous raiment, and this was
the cause of her undoing. The Duke
of Modena died almost in penury, and
the Princess Massimo felt obliged to
curtail her magnificent mode of living,
since her young niece was portionless.
But the Contessa refused to give up
her pleasures, and when contrary to
her aunt's orders she bought jewels
and dresses as lavishly as heretofore,
the Princess Massimo put her out of
her house and publicly disclaimed all
responsibility for her debts. She was
soon afterward obliged to leave Rome.
Having in the days of her affluence
made the acquaintance at Rome of a
wealthy and exceedingly devout
French country gentleman, a M. de
Glenard. who owned a fine chateau
in the nighborhood of Lolgny, In
France, she bethought herself of. his
invitation, and established herself be
neath his roof.
Finding that he was a firm : believer
in miracles, N and that he ;? was encour
aged in his. convictions by the parish
priest, Father Xae, she - induced her
host < to found a convent :In " the j neigh
borhood of Loigny,": which v she ; filled ,
with â  a number â  of ; Italian nuns, rome
of : them authentic and r others : merely
bogus. ; those who â , were 7 not crazed with
religion being adventuresses of th*
worst type. v.-. Once these women? wero
established' there the Countess pro
ceeded to invent extraordinary appa
ritions and = miracles, which attracted
the attention of the devout throughout
the entire ; district to the convent, so
that | it gradually became the object of
great '. pilgrimages â¢ and â  the recipient of
immense ; gifts. 1: : :â¢â¢ r ."*'^l^BÃ^naÃffiÂ£
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1898.
It was in vain that the Bishop of
Chartres, in whose diocese the convent
was situated, declined to give his sanc
tion to the establishment or to recog
nize it in any way, and finally the scan
dal became so severe that he referred
the matter to Rome.
The Countess and her nuns paid as
little attention to the orders received
! from the Eternal City as to those given
by the Bishop, and the outcome of the
whole affair was that the convent was
placed under the ban of the church,
and the Countess solemnly excommuni
cated by Leo XIII in person.
The Countess, in no way disconcerted
by this, at once declared that the bull
of excommunication and "of ecclesias
tical interdiction was invalid, and in
1 order to convince people thereof she in
vented an astonishing story to the ef
fect that the real Pope was a captive
in the dungeons of the Vatican, and
that the decree of excommunication
had no value owing to its being signed
and issued by a bogus pontiff.
Strange to relate, this Inconceivable
story obtained wide credence in and
around Loigny, and when shortly aft
erward, at the request of the Bishop of
Chartres, the convent was closed by
the police, the Countess determined to
make use of the tale in order to ob-
tain a means of livelihood. So with the
help of some confederates â one of
whom was a suspended priest, another
a white-haired ex-secretary of the
Duke Torlonia and the third a Hondu
ras diplomat, who styled himself Duke
of Bustella, but who turned out to be
an ex-convict â she started a propa
ganda with the^avowed object of rais
ing sufficient money both in Italy and
abroad to rescue the Pontiff from his
dungeon.
The Countess evidently possesses
some mesmeric powers, for she fre
quently silenced all hesitations and
doubts on the part of her dupes by
throwing weak-minded nuns into
trances and sleeps in which they de
clared they saw the Holy Father on a
bed of straw in the subterranean dun
geons of the Vatican, access to which
could be reached through the cata
combs.
Enormous sums of money w r ere ob
tained by the Countess in this fashion,
and finally the attention of the police
was directed to the matter with the re
sult that two years ago both she and
her confederates were arrested and
sentenced, each of them, to two years'
penal servitude, which she completed
about six months ago.
The Diana Vaughan fraud, with
which this has features of resemblance,
was one of the most cruel and blasphe
mous ever perpetrated. Its real author
was a Frenchman named Leo Taxil, a
Bohemian of literature. He had the
assistance of a wretched woman, who
appeared before the public as Diana
Vaughan.
Taxil made the religious public of
Europe the victims of his fraud. He
took advantage of a widespread belief
in the existence of a sect or sects of
devil worshipers. That such perverts
have existed is certain, and that they
do exist is probable. They are blas
phemous and demented creatures who
worship Satan as the ruler of the uni
verse, and perform In his honor hideous
travesties of religious services. Their
practices have lent themselves to gross
exaggeration by sensational v. riters.
Taxil published a series of fictitious
revelations of the doings ofHhese crea
tures. He reached a climax when he
produced Diana Vaughan, who con-

promised bride of Asmodeus, the mas

She wound up by describing her con

Her story created profound Interest
among the clergy and devout religious
people. Accepting the truth of Diana
Vaughan's statements, they naturally
regarded her as one saved by divine
grace from an incredible, horrible fate.
Diana Vaughan entered into corre
spondence with cardinals and arch
bishops, who praised her for her zeal
for the church. She even received the
blessings of the Pope. Taxll made
money by his books and by the pub
lic exhibition of Diana Vaughan. For
a time he reveled in prosperity and
notoriety.

to mind some of the other famous
deals of the early members of the Van
derbilt family. Curiously enough, the
most noted of these have to do with
"corners" in stock, at which Commo
doro Vanderbilt showed himself a mas
ter. The fact that Joseph Letter is at
present engaged in an attempt to put
through the greatest '"corner" that
was ever attempted â that of controlling
the visible supply of wheat â renders a
sketch of some of the noted "corners"
appropriate at this time.
A "corner," In the vernacular, is a
monopoly or a control of any given ar
ticle, be it stock or commercial prod
ucts, and the more nearly the supply
Is controlled the greater the success
of the attempted "corner." In the case
of wheat Letter and his friends as
sume that in this year of shortage in
the supply the world over, except In
this country, there will be a ready
demand for a II that can be furnished,
and that if they can get control of the
supply they can deal it out at theer
own terms, making a handsome profit
over the price which they paid for it.
It is predicted that this deal will cul

was ever attempted. ,-, Â ... WM

Commodore Vanderbilt ' engineered
against the members â of the Legisla
ture" and their Wall street friends, the
commodore gave orders ;to mark the
price of Harlem Railroad stock ;up â  to
1000 in order to "teach them a lesson,"
as he put it, but* upon the advice of
Leonard Jerome, who '. was "in" with
Vanderbilt, the old war horse relented
and allowed the foolish legislators to
settle for $285 a share. Not long before
It had been selling at $50 a share.
Commodore Vanderbilt was a novice
In Wall street when, as a Staten Island
ferryman, he bought a large interest in
the Harlem Railroad and proceeded to
lay his wires to get control of it. The
Harlem road back in 1862 had its ter
minal at Twenty-sixth street, the cars
being hauled down from Forty-second
street by horses.
The commodore fixed up a scheme to
extend it down Broadway to the Bat
tery, and he thought he had arranged
with enough of the Aldermen to se
cure the necessary franchise from the
city. This privilege, it was assured,
would greatly enhance the value of tha
property and the stock would naturally
go up. It had been "kicking around"
at $15 or $20 a share. The commodore
began to buy the stock freely and it
rose rapidly to $50. Then one night the
Aldermen passed an ordinance grant
ing the desired extension down Broad
way. The next morning Harlem sto^k
Jumped up to $75 and later crept up to
$100.
A couple of months later it was dls
covered that some of the Aldermen
were selling the stock "short" for fu
ture delivery, evidently thinking that
the price would go down. They let all
of their confidential friends into- the se
cret, and the latter in turn let their
friends in, until several hundred per
sons had taÂ«ken advantage of the
"point", and had made contracts for
delivery a month later. The stock was
then 'selling' at 100, and the tip was that
it would go to 60 and perhaps to 50.

some old-fashioned holder and then,
when the price dropped to $60. buy back
what he had sold, he would have
cleared $40 a share, or $4000.
The secret came out when the Alder
men met one evening and rescinded the
| resolution they had passed granting the
I Harlem company the right to lay rails
j down Broadway. The stock at once
| dropped down to 72, but the bears were
selling short. They were not satisfied
j with fifteen or twenty points, but
! "wanted it all," as the expression is in
I Wall street. They expected the price
to go down to 50, and they reasoned
that there would be no difficulty in
covering their contracts at the lowest
I when everybody who had stock would
be only too glad to sell.
But they were caught In a trap. The
stock didn't go below 70. and as the
end of the month approached and the
time for covering "short" contracts
drew near the more timid ones w-ent
into the market to get their stock to
deliver. Up shot the price to 100, then
| 120, 140, and finally to 179. Then there
j w T as none for sale, and it dawned upon
I the unhappy bears that the commo
! dore had bought U all and more tooâ
! that is they had put contracts to de
liver more than the outstanding cap
ital of the road. He allowed the big
! gest bears to settle at $179 a share, re
sulting in a clear profit to him and his
partners of several million dollars.
After this squeeze of the "shorts"
there was naturally no further demand
for the stock, and as the franchise
had been rescinded the price went
back to 50 or lower. In the following
year the commodore conceived the
idea of consolidating the Harlem and
the Hudson River railroads, and \vt
got a majority of the Legislature
pledged to grant the privilege. Up
went Harlem stock again, and, cur
iously enough, the legislators were
trapped by their own treachery, juatlfe
the Aldermen had been.
More than ,the entire capitalization of
the Harlem road, or contracts tor
stock, was again sold.
The legislators had decided not to
pass the consolidation bill, and the
price fell off 59 points to 91. Again the
bears expected it to drop to 60 and
they kept on selling. The commodore
and John Tobin bought 28,000 shares
more than had been issued. Then they
put the price up to $285 a share, at
which figure the leading bears settled.
The commodore in telling the story
later said:
"We busted the whole Legislature,
and scores of the honorable members
had to go home without paying their
board bills."
"Deacon" White made a name by
badly "squeezing"' the "shorts" in
Lackawanna stock, of which there is
always a very small amount afloat, but
he "went down" under his attempt to
"corner" the supply of corn. He found
that the visible supply was much
greater than he supposed, and, having
bought all that he' could carry on mar
gin, he was a vulnerable prey to the
onslaught of the bears when they
learned that he could take no more.
Down went the price, and as nobody
stood ready to take his vast holdings
on a declining market, the decline de
veloped into an avalanche, and many
bulls were ruthlessly slaughtered.
This incident aptly illustrates the
point that anybody who wishes to en
gineer a corner must be prepared to
buy all that is offered. That is what
Leiter and his friends are now doing.

STORY OF A SAN FRANCISCAN
WHO PROCLAIMED HIMSELF KING
Adventurous Gareer ard Jragic Death of Hardeivj-lickjvj.
BY the suicide of Baron Harden-
Hickey there has passed away
one of the most unique charac
ters of the times. A few might
class him as an adventurer, but
the nearest approach he has ever made
to the characteristics of such a being
â was in his having wooed and won the
daughter of the rich oil magnate, H.
Vt. Flagler. Inasmuch as he was never
known to tap the well filled oil tanks
of the rich father-in-law. Baron Har
dpn-Hiekey was a failure as an adven
turer. One hundred years ago he might
have cut quite a figure in the affairs of
any nation which he chose to honor
with his presence. In the days of the
feudal system he no doubt would have
been the most turbulent Baron of them
all. or in the days of the Crusades he
â¢would have unfurled a banner around
which would have gathered the chiv
alry of the times. But in these modern
times he was fated to be but a man
heard of, but whose power was unfelt.
Baron James A. Harden- Hickey was
born in San Francisco ' December 8,
1854, and the past four years of his life
were spent in Southern California.
With his bride of one year he in 1894
took up his residence on South Hill
street, Los Angeles, spending a portion
of their time at Santa Monica. Two
years ago he bought one of the most
beautiful residences in Riverside. The
years intervening between the day ?of
his birth in San Francisco and his
coming to Los Angeles had crowded
into them more romances, ambitions,
hopes disappointments, well conceived
plans and misspent forces and through
it all running a tinge of chivalry, than
has fallen to the lot of but few men.;;.
The Hickey family first attained
celebrity as adherents to the dethroned
Stuarts, and for this they were ban
ished from the United Kingdom and
sought refuge in France. Some mem
ber of the Hickey family has ever from
that day played a more or less promi
nent part in national intrigues and pol
itics, but always on the losing side
Baron Harden-Hickey was educated at
the Jesuit College at Namur, and was
sent to Leipsic for the finishing
touches. â¢â â â 'â  . - â â¢ ,
His career can be said to have begun
when he. was nineteen years of age. At
that time he entered the Military Col
lege at St. Cyr. but at the death of his
father in 1873 he came into considerable
property and concluded that he would
prefer a life devoted to sculpture and
the arts rather than a military career.
He left the school at St. Cyr to begin his
career as a literary man. :At first ; he
did not receive much .. encouragement,
but that the business was unprofitable
did not matter â to the young , baron, â¢ for

FOR?"
earnings. He made his first literary hit
by translating a number of French sto
ries for the English magazines. The
experience he gained in this line seems
to have been just what he was want
ing, for he then began to write stories
in French that were acceptable to the
Parisians. He had attained some repu
tation as a writer on the Continent, and
in 1878 he started in Paris a weekly pa
per, which he named La Triboulet, and
which he soon made the leading satir
ical paper not only of Paris, but of all
Europe. When Baron Harden-Hickey
started in to do a thing he did it re
gardless of feeling of friend or foe, or
other results. He applied the same pol
icy to the conduct of La Triboulet, and
as a result he made no less than one
hundred and fourteen appearances in
the police courts, and his exchequer
was depleted to the extent of some
thing over 300,000 francs as the result
of his having written what he thought.
It was while editor of La Tribnulet
that Baron Harden-Hickey attained a
national reputation as a duelist. His
hot Irish blood caused him to disdain
making these the conventional French
affairs. They were to a finish and the
other fellow was always the one fin
ished. Among his more notable antag
onists were Aurelian Scholt, A. Laver
tujon, Tame and De Cyon.
A feature of his dueling was that it
vraa purely an affair of honor, and po
litical honor at that, for there was
never a lady in the case. Whatever
else may be charged to him Baron
Hurden-Hickey can hardly be classed
as a lady's man in the worldy sense of
the term.
It was while editor of La Triboulet
that Baron Hickey also attained fame
as the leading boulevardier of Pans
and for a time he set the fasnlon, and
was regarded not only as the b-st
dressed man in Paris, but the recog
nized leader of a most exclusive and
refined set that devoted its time 10
fashion for fashion's sake and went
through the ordeal untainted by Its
wicked frivolities.
Between his life as a fashionable
boulevardier, a duelist, attendance at
the Police Courts and the editorial
management of La Triboulet, Baron
Harden-Hickey found himself the most
lalked-of man in Paris. As he rose
on the tide of prosperity and fame he
! became still more aggressive until his
boldness and audacity became ir
repressible, and he was ordered to
leave France. The French Govern
ment could not suppress him in any
other way.
But Baron Harden-Hickey was one
of the world's irrepressibles. Eng
j land was too slow for him, and think
ing America might afford v wider field
for a man of Ms adventurous disposi
tion he went to New York. There wa&
another reason for his leaving the old
continent. At the time when he had
reached the high tide of prosperity and
popularity in Paris he had married a
beautiful and talented French lady,

country, France, preyed on his mind
until he concluded to break away from
all old associates, and he sought a new
field for his talents in America. He
was received in New York as a Baron.
He was petted and lionized to a degree
more extensively than falls to the lot
of most Barons upon their first ap
pearance in America, but Baron Har

stood out in bold relief in any surround-

He had acquired an intimate knowl

after studying its literature he became
a convert to Buddhism. Later he de

style and the deep knowledge of the

his time. About six years ago he met,

of sight, or at least he disappeared
from public view, only to come still
more prominently to the front a little
later as James I of Trinidad. Baron
Harden-Hickey was ever a castle
builder, but they were not the massive
stone affairs which might adorn his
colonial estates, but of the thin, light,
airy, visionary sort which some people
are wont to call "castles in the air."
The kingdom of Trinidad was one of
Baron Harden-Hickey's most pic
turesque castles.
A few years ago he went on a trip
round South America by the merchant
Railing vessel Astoria, commanded by
Captain Jackson. An exceptionally
fierce South American storm arose,
which drove the bark far out of her
course. By the time the storm had
abated the Astoria was lying to off the
Island of Trinidad. Now the Island of
Trinidad does not cut very much of a
figure as an island. In fact, some geo
graphers have forgotten to put it on
their map, but a little thing like that
did not disconcert Baron Harden-
Hickey. He wanted a kingdom of his
own, and as the Island of Trinidad
seemed to have been overlooked by
every one else in the want of earthly
possessions Harden-Hickey planted his
flag and took possession of the island.
It was In the spring of 1894 that Baron
Harden-Hickey proclaimed himself to
the world as ruler of the Island of
Trinidad. He had carefully laid his
plans and his agents in the United
States began to look for subjects for
the new king, who had styled himself
James I of Trinidad.
Heretofore no one, not even the poli
ticians, had bothered themselves about
Trinidad. When it became known that
a new king had arisen the unique idea
attracted the attention of the newspa
pers, and much space was given to ex
ploiting the ideas of the new king and
his domain. James I proved to be an
exceptionally good press agent. It was
not long before he had attracted the
heads of the great nations and they
began to figure to themselves that if
the Island of Trinidad was of any value
to James I it might also prove of value
to one of them. Brazil claimed it as

never known to allow any old rocks to :

cluded that Trinidad belonged to her.
Despite the protest of James I, the
island was taken possession of by an
English cable company. Among the
adjuncts to the court of James I was
the office of Chancellor of the Princi
pality of Trinidad. It was filled by
Comte J. de la Boissiere, who was one
of the most faithful, as well as vigor
ous, subjects of James I.
The ire of James I was aroused anl
so was that of the Chancellor of the
Principality of Trinidad. The Ministers
Plenipotentiary at Washington, those
of England and Brazil, were appealed
to and James I even went so far as to
say that he was ready to declare war,
and, what is the most amusing part of
it, he meant every word of it. He was
just that sort of a fellow. He would
have thought nothing, in fact, under
circumstances he might consider it his /
imperative duty to challenge the Prince
of Wales, as the representative of the
English nation, or the President of
Brazil, to fight a duel; that would have
been his style of warfare.
The Island of Trinidad was finally
awarded to Brazil, but by this time the
ardor of Baron Harden-Hickey had
cooled somewhat, and he was about
ready to abandon his scheme of colo
nization anyway. It had also become
known to the world that Trinidad was
only of value as a possible coaling sta- !
tion, and that about the only means
c-f livelihood it afforded was as a fish
ing station, and a not very attractive
one at that. Colonists for the new j
kingdom were not forthcoming in ;
great numbers and this, too, rather j
discouraged the head of the new nation, i
The plan of government laid down by |
James I seems to have been a sort of j
compromise between that of a republic j
and a kingdom, with a few of the pre- j
rogatives of an absolute monarch j
thrown in. A constitution was drawn |
up and a code of laws adopted by the j
King and his Chamber of Deputies, j
Currency and postage stamps were is- I
sued. James I even went so far as to
seek admission to the International
Postage Union, but his postage stamps
were never recognized as of value ex
cept as souvenirs. He distributed a few
er these to his most intimate freinds in
Los Angeles, and they treasure them
as curiosities.
A navy was secured properly offi
cered with admiral, commander and a
full staff of titled dignitaries and one
ship The navy was a second-hand
bark that had about outlived the days
of usefulness as a merchantman and
was ready to retire to a dignified old
age When not used In defending the few
old buildings comprising tho solitary
port of Trinidad the navy carried the
mails over to Brazil. It was the in
tention of James I to model his king
dom on the principle and the teach
ings of gentle Guatama. It was evi
dent from this that no matter what
his wife's views may have been on the
subject. Baron Harden-Hickey was
still a Buddhist at heart.
J.imes I believed hv valor and its re
ward. He instituted the Order of De
Chavliere and laid in a good stock of
gay golden crosses with which to dec
orate his subjects when they had won
his esteem for deeds of daring and
chivalry. The principality of Trini
dad was also designed as a sort of
haven of rest for letters, art and sci
ence. Those who excelled In any of
these were to find favor and decora

tion at the hand of the head of the
principality.
After abandoning his kingdom, Bar
on Hickey, with his wife, visited South
ern California and there invested in
property. Whether it was an innate
characteristic, or that he had been em
bittered by many disappointments, be
made but few friends in the City of
the Angels. On the other hand. Mrs.
Hickey, who is a woman of great
charm of character, and who, while
very exclusive and diffident in forming
acquaintances, had a large circle of
friends and is highly respected by all
who know her.
While in Los Angeles Baron Harden-
Hickey devoted most of his time to his
family, correspondents, study, a little
writing and but few pleasures. He
received but very little attention at the
hands of newspapers, except on one
occasion, when the chancellor of the
principality of Trinidad had by some
diplomatic move at Washington again
/brought the personality of James I be
fore the public. His peculiarities came
to the surface even in his dealings with
reporters. It was not every one to
whom he would give his story. To
get a good story one had to be per
sonally known to Baron Harden-Hic
key. It was his practice when he
met a reporter for the first time to
start in and interview the reporter
himself. If. after a little talk with
the new-made acquaintance, he con
cluded that the reporter belonged in
the class known as "sticks," he would
immediately shut up as close as a
clam and not a word could be got out
of him. If, however, he concluded
that the reporter knew his business
and could write a good story the Bar
on would start in and give all the in
formation desired. He had the fac
ulty of presenting his views in a
clear, forceful, yet entertaining man
ner. He seemed to know intuitively
what would be interesting to the re
porter and he could present the most
commonplace affairs before his man
in a way that would give the matter a
sensational tinge.
There was one subject, however, on
which ho would â¢ive but very little in
formation, and that was his experience
as a duelist. He seemed to regard
with no little pride the fact that he
had attained a national reputation as
a duelist, but as to the causes which
led to them and the result of the pas
sage at arms he was as silent as a
mummy.
The fact that Baron Harden-Hickey
was a man looking for a kingdom at
tracted the attention of the conspira
tors who wished to overthrow the new
republican government of the Ha
waiian Islands. It was proposed to him
that he join forces with them and in
consideration of his having provided
some of the sinews of war Baron Har
den-Hickey was to be set up as an in
dependent sovereign on the island of
Kauai. The plan was to successively
occupy all the islands, leaving the capi
tal till the last. The plot was exposed,
however.
Some time ago Baron Harden-Hickey
attracted the attention of the literary
world in a book of which he was the
author, entitled "Euthania, or the Eth
ics of Suicide." In this he treated the
subject from a historical and reasoning
point of view. His line of argument
all tended to the one point that suicide
under some circumstances was not only
pardonable but creditable. Subsequent
events have proved that Baron Har
den-Hickey not only wrote as life be
lieved but had the courage of his con
victions.
thoughts dwelt on the beautiful new
home that was awaiting her.
"I love pretty things â isn't that what
they're made for? â to be loved? And
I suppose I'll be able to carry out all
my other plans and still have enough
left for pretty clothes and jewels.
"I've asked all my dear friends to
visit me and they've all promised they
would. There's one I want especially
to come," and she paused musingly.
"And she has consented. It's my chum.
We've been friends ever since we were,
little tots and made mudpies."
â¢Then the way is clear for some
" lord who will carry you off. You may
still come into another title and estate,"
I ventured, again.
â¢Oh, I'm afraid I haven't the proper
amount of respect for a title. I'm very
rr.Bch of an American still. I think I
always will be."
"I must say," remarked Stayathome,
"that I cannot understand why you
took your wife with you to the Klon
dike. I should have thought that in a
place like that a woman would be sim
ply in the way."
"Not c-n your life," said the miner
who had just returned with $100,000.
"In fact, it was through her that I
made my pile in such a short time."
"How so?"
"Why, in this way: Whenever I dis
covered a pocket, I'd point it out to
Maria, and in less than five minutes
she'd have extracted every grain of
gold that it contained."
His Lordship â I am deeply interested
in the new gold discoveries.
Friendâ You don't think of going to
the Klondike, do you?
His Lordshipâ Oh, no! But I thought
of advertising that I should be glad
to communicate with any successful
miner who might happen to have an
unmarried daughter. â Puck.
Macauley â Golding is foolish to go to

Somers â He has had his union suits

That he had but recently been de-<
voting his time to the manuscript of ai
new book is evident from the fact that
such a book is now in the hands of
Comte J. de la Boissiere. It is entitled
"Soul Love," and is said to be a theor
etical romance treating of platonic and'
non-platonlc love.
Baron Harden-Hiekey leaves two
children by his first wife, one a beauti
ful girl of 16, now completing her edu
cation at the Convent of the Sacred,
Heart in Paris. The other is a boy
about 18 years of age, and is said to ba,
the manager of a large ranch in Mex-.
ico, o\vned by the late Baron.
For the past few months the late
Baron spent much â¢of his time in San<
Francisco, but led a very quiet life
while here. He seemed to seek se
clusion. That there was some dif
ference between him and his wife is!
quite evident, but as to the matter In.
dispute between them not even their
closest friends know. It is thought
that he had of late given way to the
chloral habit, and this may have had
something to do with the affair, for it
is said that in one of the letters from
his wife, found among his effects in
the hotel at El Paso, where he com
mitted suicide, she expresses a hope
that he would rid himself "of that
beastly chloral habit."
Neither was the Baron on good terms,
with his rich father-in-law. In a.,
letter found in his room at El Paso,
and addressed to his wife, he says:<
"~AVII. I have drained the cup of bit
terness to the very dregs, but I do.
not complain. I prefer to be a dead
gentleman to a living blackguard like
your father."
It is not likely that the differences
arose over money matters, for no mat
ter what else may be charged to Baron
Harden-Hiekey, he was not an adven
turer from a financial standpoint. He
was just the sort of a fellow who, if
he had taken a notion to marry a girl,
it would not make a whit of difference
to him whether her father was a mil
lionaire or a beggar.

romantically inclined characters In this
very prosaic age.
SAWDUST EXPLOSIONS.
Who ever heard of sawdust explosions?
They are common enough in Canada.
Navigation on the Ottawa River has been
seriously impeded at times by explosions
of sawdust, and the Dominion Govern
ment has at last decided to take steps to
prevent any practice which will enhance
the possibility of these explosions taking
place. One would hardly suppose that
sawdust dumped into* the river would in
course of time reform itself into a gas
generator which would keep the surface
of the stream In a constant state of up
hi aval. But it is true to such an extent
that small boats have been capsized and
large vessels have been Injured by the
submarine convulsions.
The bottom of the Ottawa River is cov
ered with a deep layer of sawdust
dumped there by the lumbermen who
have carried on their log cutting indus
try on its banks and tributaries for
years. The dust becoming water-soaked,
sinks to the bottom, and in the course of
time, rots and generates a highly explos
ive gas. The latter rises to the surface,
each bubble being joined or reinforced by
other bubbles on the way up. Contact
with air seems to be as destructive as
touchfire to this gas, and the moment the
surface is reached it explodes with a loud
report. Legislation may in time do away
with the annoyance, but even if no more
dust is thrown into the stream hence
forth, the millions of tons already there
will take a long time to work off their
gas generating qualities.

EXCITING EXPERIENCE OF A PASADENA MINISTER WHO SWALLOWED A MOUSE
PASADENA, Feb. 16.â Rev. J.
H. Keller, ths colored pastor of
the Friendship Baptist Church
of this city, swallowed a live
mouse Thursday night. Rev. Mr.

and he has expanded them with use

WHAT ARE THE CHIEF CAUSES OF LACK OF EMPLOYMENTS?
THE solving of the problem of
what to do with our young men
is occupying the attention of
some of the strongest thinking
minds in the country. The most
able men in our own city have
contributed their ideas of what should
be done to help the able and willing
unemployed. The unemployed also
have ideas on this subject, and un
theoretical as they may appear to some
they are certainly straight to the point.
As a general thing they attribute most
of their trouble to machinery.
At almost any hour of the day hun
flreds of these men can be seen about

the streets. They congregate about the
employment offices, assemble in front
of the bulletin boards of such news
papers as display their "want" pages,
and hang around places where there
is likely to be work, ready and willing
to do anything.
The argument* advanced t>y most or
these men is that machinery ought not
to be used unless there is an absolute
need of it. Most of them incline to
the belief that the time will come when
the Government will have to prohibit
the use of machinery in certain cases
as is frequently done in France.
Why should a steam digger that is
run by two or three engineers be used
when there are thousands of men ready
and willing to handle the pick and
shovel? is a question many of them
ask. The very fact that the steam
digger is displacing laborers, causing
them to bo unable to buy the necessi
ties of life is sure to have a depressing
effect on other industries.
Some ten years ago the officers who
have charge of the gaslightlng depart
ment of the city of Paris. France, de
cided to Introduce an electric gas
lighter. The contrivance was of the
simplest description and cost hardly 10
cents for each burner. The idea was
to turn off the gas from the central sta
tion in the morning and so extinguish
It all over the city at the same time.
In the evening the gas was to bo

send a spark across each burner and
the whole city illuminated at the same
instant. The idea worked like ;i charm.
But it displaced about 2000 lamplightr
ers, most of whom became a charge
upon the community.
After investigation by the proper au
thorities of the republic it was decided
that the electric gaslighter benefited
nobody, but on the contrary was a
worker of harm. It was then ordered
that the electric gasllghter be taken
out and the walking lamplighters put
back to work.

graph and the ar.imatoscope have been
inventions that made work for thous
ands. But the same cannot be said of
the combined harvester nor the self
acting street sweeper. Why. they de
mand, should a machine, that possibly
does not actually represent more than
ten days' actual work for two men, be
put into a field and made to do the
work of hundreds, who can only look on
and long to be a machine. Why should
an automatic street sweeping machine
be put to work when men are ready to
handle the brush. They claim that
none of the machines mentioned does
the work better than it can be done by
hand.
It is machinery of this kind that our
unemployed object to. When men can
not get work as laborers at living
wages they make an effort to learn
something, and generally get in as
"machine hands." Here their wages
are of the lowest and they are keeping
out of work people who might be kept
at work as skilled mechanics.
The general verdict of the unem
ployed is that machinery should, be
used when there are no men to do the
work. When men are idle, they argue,
the use of such machinery should be
prohibited.
At present there are in San Francis
co about two hundred young men who
have learned the shoemaker trade and
are now unable to get work at it. These
young fellows are ready and willing to
do anything, but cannot find work.
Electricians have also been made to
feel the effect of improvement in their
business. Eight years ago it took ex
perience to be able to run a dynamo,
but now the apparatus is so simplified
it can be managed by anybody with
common sense.
And so it goes all through the list of
trades. Even office men complain and
say that improved methods have left
them nothing to do, as their work can
all be done by girls and boys.
What is to be done with these unem
ployed? They cannot be killed and they
cannot be allowed to live as they are,
lor a generation or two of such lives
will turn them into criminals. Follow

him a helpless burden on the commu
nity.
There are too many carpenters, shoe
makers, machinists, electricians and
such workers being turned out, as well
as too many professional men. New ap
plications of mechanical forces are con
stantly being discovered by inventive
minds, and the cry that men are being
supplanted by machinery growa
stronger daily.
It would not do for the Government
to restrict invention, or the use of in
ventions. That would savor too much
of the paternal rule which is diamet
rically opposed to the principles of our
free land, and when new ideas come
forward which reduce cost to the man
ufacturer he most certainly will take
advuntage of them, even if by so doing
he reduces his working force of men to
the minimum. No manufacturer or
business man is bound in any way to
employ more men than he can use to
his own advantage, but the men thrown
out of work by machines should bestir
themselves to do those things which
machinery cannot do.
A man who finds himself out of em
ployment should. Instead of loitering
about hoping for a chance to work at
his special trade, go to work at the first
thins: that comes to hand that he
is physically able to perform. It is no
disgrace to a cabinet maker, a shoe
maker, an electrician or a lawyer to
wash dishes or wait on tables when
other work Is not to be obtained. It
is far more of a disgrace to suni'l about
idle or endeavor to foment trouble and

I answer without hesitation in the

though, it seemed to me it was trying
to gouge a great hole to freedom

danger that new mechanical contri
vances will cause the disastrous results
which the question implies. America
has always been justly proud of the in
ventive genius of her people. In Eu
rope to say that a certain thing is- clone
according to American methods is
equivalent to saying that some me
chanical contrivance is used.
We are quite right in the pride we
take in this peculiar feature of our civ
ilization. The introduction of machin
ery is a great blessing to society, for
it cheapens production, bringing goods,
once costly, within the reach of many
persons who could not have them be
fore. It renders possible a great in
crease in production, vastly multiply
ing the wealth of .society and enables
the enjoyment of a greater diversity of
commodities. The use of machinery
brings about a high degree of division
of labor, or separation of employments
which is essential to economic progress.
In the end it gives employment to a
far larger number of persons than be
fore. For the increased production calls
for many hands to run the machines,
and many more to send the goods to
market and to sell them. The number
of persons employed in those industries
where the use of machinery has been
most marked has increased with the
greatest rapidity. Without the nu
merous mechanical contrivances now
in use the world could support but a
small portion of its present population.
These and other advantages are not
had for nothing. There is some ground
for the question. It is true that the
bright picture for the future of any
Industry frequently has, when machin
ery is first introduced, a dark fore
ground. In that gloomy foreground we
see the starving families of the hope

the country. Such labor has a
distinct stake in the foundation,
maintenance and extension of such
enterprises. As far as its influ
ence can go in politics, the formation
of public opinion and the securing of
confidence in the country's financial
and industrial future, its interests are
at one with the employers of labor.
A current and very serious mistake
on the part of such labor is the grow
ing idea that its employer is its enemy,
and anything which it can do to his in-
Jury is a benefit to itself. With this
mistake corrected and a renewal of the
former cordial relations and conditions
of mutual friendship and dependence
between skilled labor and its employers
there will arise that confidence in the
future of active enterprises which be
gets their expansion and makes neces
sary the employment of more labor.
Statistics show that the annual va
cancies in the whole field of labor in
this country, from agriculture to the
skilled trades, amount to 700,000. That
many every year drop out by mortality
or advance to independence, and fur

It is constantly changing. The
skilled artisan, through lack of em

the unskilled laborer to-morrow. The

mechanic. Thus each class reacts upon
the other, and want of employment ag
gravates the affliction jpf both.

In regaining the lost ground? Why are
there still so many workingmen, es
pecially skilled mechanics and artisans
in nearly all trades, anxious but unable
to find employment in this city?
The demand for skilled labor depends
mainly upon the amount of goods and
materials consumed at home and for
export. In the field of exports San
Francisco cannot compete, because of
unusual burdens in this city upon com
merce and manufacturing in the shape
of high taxes, tolls, licenses and other
restrictions. In filling the demand for
articles consumed here we are also
heavily handicapped by these em
bargoes.

the industrial ralblution began. This
dates from the Invention of the steam
engine in 1769.
It is estimated that in the production
of flour the labor of one person is equal
to that of one hundred and forty-four
persons in the time of Ulysses. In the
iron industry twenty-five times as
much is now produced as in the Pyre
nees with the old methods. Among the
causes of lack of employment and dis
satisfaction among skilled workingmen
may be mentioned the rapidity with
which men have invented new things
and discovered old forms. The brain
rivaled the hand. The wage system
was introduced, competition began and
the evolution of transportation became
an industrial factor.
Another cause is the large number of
men who are trained fn our technical
institutions and who are constantly
contributed by these schools to the
class of skilled laborers. Our indus

mensurate with this annual army.

to have the land cut up into small

their families and earn an honest and

would relieve the present congestion of
our cities.
The fact that there are more shoe

shoes for other people, places no obli

these men as shoemakers. If too many

The determination on the part of the

goods are offered below cost, when they
know that any sale of that kind is in

Being practiced for
frke Next War.
UNCLE Pam has some little
tricks up his sleeve, which in
time of war could be brought
into service at a moment's no
tice, and which would prove
v.ry annoying to an enemy.
Comparatively little is known about
the signal corps of the army and its
Important work. Aerial military ma
neuver-, photographing from great
heights and distances, laying, equip
ping and operating telegraph and tele
phone lines in time of battle at a rate
as fast as a horse can travel, are inter
matters, and all of them are
achieved by this branch of the service.
The Signal Corps on a peace footing
consists of ten officers and a score or
more of sergeants, together with small
detachments of enlisted men detailed
t r this special service at the various
p.Â»sts on the frontier, where instruction
the work of the corps is given.
Brigadier-General A. W. Greely of
Arctic fame is in command of the
corps, and has his headquarters at
Washington, D. C. Too much credit
cannot be given this thoroughly effi
cient officer, who is to a large degree
responsible for the perfection in all
branches of the work that obtains to
day. The largest school of instruction
at present is at Fort Logan, Colorado.
Captain W. A. Glassford, chief signal
officer of the Department of the Colo
rado, is in charge, and has in his de
tachment three sergeants and eigh
teen detailed enlisted men.
In the present day, owing to the
rapid advance made in modern fire
arms, the necessity has arisen for a
means of instant communication from
one part of a hatt If field to another.
Fir the transmission of orders, in
struction, reports, etc., nothing is so
sv ft as electricity. The aerial ex
ploits of some of these men outrival
the wildest dreams of old-time aero
nauts â for a balloon train is now part
of the field equipment of the modern
United States army.
Supposing that a state of actual war
fare exists, we will go with the signal
men into the field and see how the field
telegraph and telephone lines are put
up and operated. The telegraph train
consists of three wagons, of the usual
army type, built for rough, .hard ser
vice. The electrical batteries are se
curely packed in wooaen bins or cells
in one of these wagons, to prevent
their . toppling over, in transit. An
other compartment in this same wagon
provides safe storage for the tele
graph instruments and necessary sup
plies.
The second wagon Is known as the
wire wagon. It carries a supply of or
dinary galvanized telegraph wire, suffi
cient to erect a line ten or a dozen miles
in length. This wire is carried upon
reels which pay it out automatically,
once the line has been started. The
third wagon carries the slender poles
or lances, together with the necessary
Insulators to support the wire and tools
for setting the lances in the ground.
The wagon train jogs along at a fair
rate of speed, after leaving the post and
no one knows, except the officer in com
mand, Just where or when the line is. to
be put up. The order for "double time"
was given, and after the men had
trotted a short distance the order to
halt was sounded. The officer in com
mand had selected his imaginary line
and directed the battery wagon to be
placed in a certain position when
halted. The men ran to the wire wagon
and swarmed over it; others of them
attacked the pole or lance truck and in
an instant a stream of poles was issu
ing from that wagon that could only be
approached by an army of circus em
ployes dismantling a big tent. The gen
eral direction of the line was indicated
by the officer and the men set to work.
Two of them, armed with huge crow
bars, trotted off in the direction the line
was to take. One of them halted at
about fifty or sixty yards from the bat
tery wagon and thrust the sharpened
end of the steel bar into the ground.
The other passed him and went twice
as far, when he, too, thurst the sharp
instrument into the yielding soil. The
/irst man had now run around him and
hi? place, where he had dug the first
hole, was taken by a group of men
armed with one of the lances, an insu
lator and the end of the wire, which
'â was now spinning out of the rear
end of the wire wagon. In less time
than it takes to tell it, the lance or
pole was set, the insulator was in posi
tion and the wire was attached. The
men were already at the second station,
where a pole was going up, before I had
time to make a photograph. The men
with the crowbars were now far away
and going farther all the time. That
row of bristling poles seemed to grow
like magic and one could almost see
them run. In an incredibly short space
of time â but little longer than it would
have taken me to walk to the edge of
the -timber â the line had disappeared
among the trees. While I was wonder-
Ing what would be done next, the in
strument in the battery wagon began
to tick and a message came in over the
newly constructed line, asking for fur
ther instructions. Orders were flashed
back and the line was continued all the
way to the foothills.

past few years that it will be perfectly
within the range of possibility, in cas<?
of war, to accurately photograph an
enemy's position, obtain accurate maps
of his fortifications, etc.. etc.. without
sending any one within his lines. The
balloon service as it has been con
ducted -ft Fort Logan proves this con
clusively. To the uninitiated it would
seem out of the question to transport
a balloon with an army and to send It
up for observation purposes at any
time or at any place. Yet the difficul
ties that naturally surround this prob
lem have ;iP been overcome and to-day
thf-re is at Fort Logan a fully equipped
balloon field train, ready for service at
ar ; y moment.

maintained through the cable which
holds the balloon to the wagon.
As the members of the Signal Corps

a simple matter for them to prepare

almost incessantly, and in that lies a
great measure of its safety. Nearly all

now equipped with balloon corps, and
the value of this sort of aerial survey

experts, and they ought to know.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1898.
The luillonn corps of the German
army is said to be the equal, if not the
superior, of any in the world. It is
kept in constant practice and experi
ments are made nearly every day in
the year.
The latest series of experiments re
cently took place at Interbock, about
ten miles from Berlin, and were to
test the sustaining qualities of a bal
ioon when riddled with heavy projec
tiles.
Results showed thai at. a distance of
2000 feet above the earth an infantry
lire from either muskets or rifles had
little effect upon the balloon. The at
mospheric pressure being about the
equal of the gas pressure had the ef
fect of keeping the perforations closed
so that the balloon kept afloat the
same as if nothing had happened.
The fire of an artillery battery, how
ever, at a distance of 4300 yards, soon
brought the balloon to the ground, the
shells tearing large holes in the cover
ing and making it evident that a cap
tive ballon to be of service near a for
tification would bnve to be kept in
constant and rapid motion.
Whetherof ii"' experiments have been
made in the use of explosives dropped
from balloons. I have not been able to
learn, but from what one can- see of
the use of these aerial monsters at Fort
Logan it would not be strange if the
wildest dreams of moderns may soon be
realized and the terrible death-dealing
airship may soon evolve, as did the
Holland submarine boat, from Jules
Vfrne's "Twenty Thousand Leagues

WONDfcR AND MYSTERY OF VIBRATIONS.
Science has proven that the planets and
the bodies which make up our solar sys
tem have each an individual motion so
< io;triy defined and mathematical that it
is known for years ahead when the moon
or the sun will be eclipsed, when a star
or a planet will be hidden by the disk
of the passing moonâ in fact, everything
has a perfect, orderly and mathematical
motion.
Only within recen-t years have there
been discoveries made that would throw
much li^ht on anything pertaining to the
human mind, especially the senses. But
the construction of some fine mechan
isms have made it. possible to get to a
definite h.'isif ;is t>> what the sensations
of the human body consist of. It haa
been found that the human organism is
susceptible only to vibrations.
A vibration is a rapid, rhythmic to
and fro motion; for instance, if you take
a thin stick and with your hand move
it to and fro about twenty times a sec
ond, you will have a vibration which will
be heard as a low sound. If you increase
the number of motions a second the
sound will be that much higher, until at
245 vibrations a second you will hear the
tone of lower "C" of the piano. Conse
quently what you hear is only the rapid
motion or vibration that the gases have
been whipped into, which gives the hu
man mind the sensation of sound.
The lowest sound the. human ear can
hear is that caused by 17 vibrations a sec
ond, then tones are heard, octave after
octave, until at about 42.000 vibrations is
reached, when we do not hear nor feel
anything. There is a tan in our sensa
tions. But in keeping right on increasing
the rate of vibrations until we reach
about 120,000 vibrations we begin to
feel the sensation of cold. After 120,000 vi
brations the cold increases until at 400.000
vibrations it begins to feel warm, and at
800.000 it is very hot.
This ends the sensations wherein the
gases convey the vibrations to our senses,
for after this the ether is the medium
which is vibrated ami we begin to
see. When the ether is vibrated at a rate
of from 3,000.000 to 4.000X00 times a second
there is another gap in our sensations, for
we see nothing. After this we gradually
begin to sec color. First lied, and as the
vibrations are increased then Pink ap

have their octaves. When about :5tM,00O."0O
vibrations are reached there is another
gap in our sight, the sum.' as there was
in hearing, for we again see nothing. Fi
nally, when the vibrations reach so high
that they cannot be calculated, then
gradually light begins to be seen, which
increases in brilliancy, until white light
is produced, when the possibility of hu
man sensations teases altogether.
Thus the sensations of the human or
ganism are subject to a mathematical
basis, and all of them caused by vibra
tions. But this is not all. Taste and
smell are also caused by vibrations. It
is known by chemists and scientists that
a molecule of matter has a vibratory mo
tion. One effect of this molecular vibra
tion is the sensation of taste when the
molecules come in contact with the nerves
of the throat and palate. Another is
when the sense of smell is aroused by
these molecules entering the nostrils.
One peculiar fact is that we can only
taste the sweets by the nerves of the tip
of the tongue and the bitters by those of
the. hack of the tongue, while the
a 'nl those between bitter and sweet are
tasted ai the center of the tongue. The
same takes place \yith the nose. The
eweel perfumes of flowers are smelled at
the fore part of the n<>se and the stenches
farther back. Tho. rotison of this is the
fact that a nerve )s composed of a thou
sand fibers as thin as a spider web. and
each one Is only affected by a certain
vibration, then passes to higher ones, or
to one that responds, and so on, until tho
little group of nerves is exhausted, then
the next Rroup is called upon. That is
how the tore and back nerves of the
tongue are each aroused by a particular
vibrationâ those- of the fore part are
pitched in a higher key and only respond
to high-keyed vibrations.
Having made the study of vibrations a
special one for a number of years, dur
ing my travels while lecturing I have
met with some interesting BUfcjectS, SVteh
as men and children who were peculiarly
affected by music. Blind Tom. who was
stone blind, told me that he saw colors
when he played the piano.
Later I met a child in Nebraska who
saw these colors also when her mother
played the piano, and another child in
Chicago who likewise saw them. In that
city is a great organist, whose name I
would not mention, who sees the most
beautiful harmony of colors when he
plays the organ, and especially the great
pipe organ of the Chicago Auditorium.
All of those people had a singular ex
perience which led me to investigate
deeper in the effects of color on the mind.
These people would feel the sense of
warmth when the red colors were dis
played, pleasant when the yellow, and
cool with the blue. The children (al
though a thousand miles apart), would
each object when their mothers played
"hot music" in the summer time. This
"hot music" was the red colors that fol
lowed the base tones. Thus I discovered
that the first two octaves formed a red
color, the middle octave formed yellow
and the last two blue colors, and that
these colors had a purely mental im
pression as to the heat and cold. In ex
perimental psychology I found later a
subject, who. when hypnotized and put
into a state of clairvr.yaney, would see
even the colors of the thought vibra
tions that I would think at her. By
nractice I got so I could produce inese
Sfors on the ethers by intense thinking
of them. Then I found that my sub
ject would have all the symptoms of a
fiver when I sent red colors at her. or
would feel cool with the blue or the
creeii I could make her see snow or
tiro with< 'lit speakinjE a word, by only
thinking strongly of the scene I wished

PROF. SCHENCK of Vienna
thinks he has proved that the
sex of offspring is determined by
the relative status of the two
parents as regard nutrition.
Should the proof be accepted, then one
of the most puzzling and fascinating
problems of the ages has been solved.
But it should not be forgotten that it
is a problem that has been "solved"
a vast number of times before, and
that all these solutions have failed to
stand the test of experiment. Half a
hundred explanations of the reason
why a child is born of a particular sex
are current in popular gossip, but no
one of these has hitherto been ad
mitted to have a semblance of scien
tific backing. Hence the interest
which attaches to the claim of the
German professor, whose standing
as a scientist removes his theory
at once to a different plane from that
of all previous ones.
It is only In comparatively recent
times, indeed, that any guess on the
subject stood the slightest chance of
nearlng the truth, for until the micro
scope came to aid vision no one had
the remotest notion as to what really
constitutes the process of generation,
which lies back of sex. The microscope
brought to light the Interesting fact
that in every process of generation
there are two elements, and two only,
involved. One of these Is a round egg
like cell called the ovum, or female ele
ment; the other an even smaller
motile cell, called the sperm
cell or male element. Observa
tion of many forms of life made clear
the wonderful fact that these elemen
tary cells are marvelously similar in
appearance among all forms of living
beings. The egg cell of a fish, a rep
tile, and a mammal, for example, are
to 'all intents and purposes identi
cal in appearance, and the sperm cell
of the lower forms of aquatic plants
is often almost indistinguishable from
that of the highest mammal, being in
each case an infinitesimal moving
creature, looking for all the world like
a miniature tadpole with an extra
long tail. And from the lowest to the
highest forms of life, the real essence
of generation is the union of a sperm
cell with an egg cell; from such union,
and not otherwise (except among cer
tain lower forms), results the new be
ing.
When these elementary processes of
generation were first discovered sci
entists thought themselves closely on
the track of the question of sex, and
of all the other puzzles of heredity. In
the case of lishes, frogs and other lower
forms of life, the germ-cell was ob
served entering the egg-cell, fertiliza
tion resulting, and the observers not
unnaturally jumped to the conclusion
that the matter of sex might be de
termined by the number of germ cells
that found their way into any partic
ular egg-cell. If the number sufficed
to give preponderance to the male ele
ments, they reasoned, the offspring
must be a male, and vice versa. But
this very satisfactory theoretical
explanation received its quietus a few
years ago when Professor Hertwig
demonstrated that fertilization is ef
fected always by the union of a sin
gle germ cell and no more with an
egg-cell. This being admitted soon af
ter by all observers, the sex question
was returned to its former state of ob
scurity.
Meantime, however, a very different
set of observers had taken the ques
tion up, and brought it to what many
of them believed to be a satisfactory
solution. These were the breeders of
cattle on the great Western ranches.
To these men the question of sex de
termination is one of utmost import
ance, from a purely business stand
point. One breeder, for instance, has
a herd of Jerseys, for dairy purposes.
The male offspring of his herd are
practically of no value to him, being
too small to make good beef, while fe
males are at a premium. Just the re
verse is the case with a neighboring
breeder, who raises beef for the East
ern market, and hence keeps cattle of
a large flesh-forming breed, the cows
of which have little value as milkers.
Various of these breeders discovered
or thought they discovered some years
ago that if the males of their herds
were in particularly vigorous condition,
while the cows were less vigorous, the
offspring, on an average, showed a pre
ponderance of females, while if the re
verse conditions prevailed male calves
preponderated. So certain were they
of this that many of them came habit
ually, to feed the bulls and cows of their
herds in the particular way that would
favor their ends, according to this the
ory; and the 1 claim was made that the
results justified the experiment. These
alleged facts were widely published,
but they excited little comment among
scientists because, from the nature of
the case, the experiments were not per
formed with sufficiently rigid tests to
satisfy the scientific mind. But now
these allegations come at once to mind,
because the alleged discovery of Pro
fessor Schenck. to which the scientific
world is forced to give attention, is
practically a rediscovery of the method
long advocated by the Texas cattla
breeders.
It would certainly be curious if the
solution of one of the greatest biologi
cal problems should have been reached
first by frontier farmers of America;
yet the experience would not be alto
gether unique, for it is well known that
the dairymen of England had been
aware of the preventive power of cow
pox over smallpox many years before
Edward Jenner put the matter to rigid
tests and demonstrated the truth of
their rumored opinions. Indeed, such
a substratum of rumored knowledge
may be found beneath many great dis
coveries. And in this particular case it
is not alone the cattle breeders but a
large number of physicians everywhere
who have held, as a provisional belief,
a theory of sex which is practically that
now formulated definitely by Professor
Schenck. There is at least one New
York physician, for example, who has
long been accustomed to point out the
fact that among families of his ac
quaintance male offspring preponderate
where the mother noticeably exceeds
the father in physical vigor or vitality;
girl children where the father is pro
nouncedly the more vigorous.
He has shown, further, that in a
family where boys have been the sole
offspring, a girl may be born during a
period when the father had suffered
from a long-continued depression of
health. He has even claimed to have
some success in predicating the sex of
unborn children by applying this test.
But as he had made no detailed publi
cation of his observations, his theory
takes nothing from the precedence of
Professor Schenck. It does, however,
tend to strengthen confidence in the
German's alleged discovery that other
independent observers had reached
somewhat similar conclusions.
But there is another and a much
stronger reason for supposing that the
new claims may have some validity.
Thus, it is well known that certain bac
teria will go on producing their kind
by the splitting up of each individual
to form two, continuing this process
over and over so long as an abundance
cf food is supplied and the temperature
is uniform; but that when food be
comes scarce or the temperature unfa
vorable (in other words, when nutri
tion is interfered with), at once this
form of reproduction ceases, and each
cell, instead of dividing to form two,
develops within itself a colony of off
spring in the form of spores, which can
rest indefinitely before going on to de
velopment. Here it would be too much,
perhaps, to say that sex is involved;
yet, beyond question, the spores are a
different order of offspring from the
ones ordinarily produced by division.
A more unequivocal example of a
similar kind is furnished by the
aphides or plant lice. The female of
this interesting species may, and us
ally does, produce a series of off
spring all of one sex throughout almost
her entire life; and only toward the
approach of winter, when food begins
to be scarce, does she produce offspring
of the other sex. Here, clearly, the
influence of nutrition in determining
sex is unequivocal.
There is an impression abroad that
the case of the bee is another instance
ir. point, but this is a mistake. It is
quite true that the worker bees may
by forcel feeding determine that a
certain larva shall become a queen,
whereas without such forced breading
that larva would have been merely
a worker; but it is also true that all
worker bees are of the female sex.
They are simple abortive queons; the
males of the hives being drones. Yet
the case of the bee has its importance
in this connection after all, for thn
worker bee, even though a female, is
incapable of producing offspring unless
put through the course of forced feed
ing while in the larval state, that will
alone develop her into a queen.
In all these cases of real or alleged
predetermination of sex, U will be ob
served, the final settlement of the
question for each particular individual
is supposed to be effected immediately
on the union of the male and female
elements, giving vitality to the new
organism. It is an open question,
however, whether such final determina
tion of sex really takes place so early.
There arÂ» biologists who hold that in
it 3 earliest stages the organism !s with
out sex, or, perhaps better, that it la
bi-sexual. But when one reflects that
al! the potentialities of the male par
ent have been transmitted through the
germ cell, it is difficult to believe that
any fortuitous later occurrences can
change the sex of the offspring.
In such a case as that of the fish,
where the germ cell finds the egg cell
at the bottom of a river, and where
neither parent afterward comes near
the developing young, one can hardly
doubt that the sex is determined by
the balance of vitalities of each pair of
germ cells and ova, at the moment of
their union, and not by any subsequent
vicissitudes. And if this be true of thÂ»
fish, such is the harmony of vital ac
tion throughout nature, one cannot
doubt that it holds equally true of
every other organism. So clear does
this seem that one feels that Professor
Schenck must be misunderstood in
those reports which have stated that
he bases his claims on the nutrition of
the female after conception. If his
theory has any validity at all it must
surely be based on the vitality supplied
the germ cells and egg cells by the
nutrition of the parents, prior to con
ception, not afterward.
Without entering into- exhaustive dis
cussion of the matter, it may not be
amiss to call attention to one familiar
feature regarding the average sex of
large masses of population, which the
new theory of sex in some measure ex
plains. It is well known to statisticians
that during times of war the average
percentage of male births incrcf>-^s
among the warring nations. During
the half decade, 1860-65, for example,
more than the proportionate number
of boys were born in the United States.
The theory that nutrition influences
sex would explain this as due to the
fact that, on an average, the fathers
of the country were more reduced in
physical vitality by the physicn.l vicis
situdes of war ths were the mothers.

ANOTHER BONAPARTE.
/HE FOURTH NAPOLEONâ By Charlrs
Benham. Chicago: Herbert S. Stone
& Co. For sale by Doxey; price $1 50.
This is a first-class tale in every respect
end one that is likely to hold the reader's
attention from its commencement to its
end. The story opens in London, where a
young barrister, an orphan, is pictured
awaiting a chance to supplement a small
Income by practice in the law courts. The
world, however, is against him and he
finally decides to realize on his capital
and live lik^ a gentleman in Paris, even if
only for a few years. He leaves London
and starts for the gay metropolis, where
he meets with an old friend of his pa
rents. This gentleman informs him that
his father was no less a personage than
Paul Bonaparte, a grandson by an early
and unknown marriage of the great
Emperor. The lad's real name is discov
ered tf> bo Louis Napoleon Bonaparte,
and as he is a great-grandson of the first
Napoleon, his legitimate title shyuld be
Napoleon IV.
The time happens* to be ripe for a new
coup d'etat and the former briefless bar
rister finds himself one morning ruling
over the destinies of the French. In the
course of the story he falls in love with
a charming English girl, but is, of course,
unable to marry her. He does not tell her
this until rather late in the game and a
tragedy is the immediate result of the
love affair. Finally, when one wonders
how the Emperor is going to extricate
himself from a dozen embarrassing situ
ations he commits suicide and thus brings
the romance to a satisfactory close.
The story is written throughout in a
semi-satirical vein in which Mr. Benham
appears to be at his best. He fully ap
preciates the ridiculousness of the situa
tions he creates and uses every one of
them to advantage. There is much love
making and intrigue in the book and the
passages are treated in a half-serious,
half-cynical manner that makes them
doubly entertaining. The characters are
live men and women culled from English
drawing rooms and French diplomatic
circles. Their Aery naturalness makes
them the more interesting, and though
the- final scenes in the story are dark an*?
gloomy, the reader will lay down the
book feeling that it was well worth read-
Ing, and original enough to warrant being
)laced in a class all by itself.

This story gives us a very vivid and pa

In Russia some fifty years ago, a time when
the masses of the great empire were
sunk in the lowest depths of ignorance,
when serfdom was still the rule of the
land, and no ray of light from the modern
civilization which regenerated Europe
had penetrated the recesses of this vast
autocracy.

some measure of caution In their deal
ing: with the Jews, and outrages of the
kind portrayed in this novel could hardly j
escape indignant comment. The scene is
laid at Odessa, {there the people of the
Ghetto, by many oppressive regulations,
have been reduced to a condition of the.
direst poverty. But one man stands out
from among them, a Nazarene named
David Rheba, a silversmith of wonderful
skill. His work is in demand all over
Europe, yet he gains no wealth, for his
earnings are all distributed among his
needy brethren.
A great passion arouses the soul of this
man, and furnishes the keynote for the
slender plot of the novel. He falls in love
With a serf girl, Olga. the favorite of a
great Russian lady. Despite the insuper
able difficulties of creed, a great passion
draws the two together. Olga comes to
the Jew with her mistress, who has a
difficult request to make. She wishes the
Jew to execute a crucifix for her, and
here, in a passage of marked strength,
the authoress describes the awakening of
these twin souls.
"Olga touched Marya's arm and whis
pered:
" "Why should it pain to make him an
image of our Lord Jesus Christ?'
" 'Because he is a Jew,' whispered Marya
in reply.
Olga drew In her breath and sighed.

heart; he had forgotten in the over

of him at sight of her that she might

faced her with the thought in his soul.
'Do not shrink from me; thy Christ was
a Jew.' She had risen from the stool,
and was standing gazing intently at him,
and he almost cried out for very joy,
for there was neither shrinking nor hor
ror in her eyes; In her, as in him, love
had overthrown all lesser things; they
were man and woman made by God to
be mate each to each; no creed, 'no ob
stacle set up by man could separate them
one from the other; they had met by
perfect chanO only to discover that they
were one perfect whole and that they
had been so from all time."
True love could hardly be more forci
bly idealized, but unfortunately the old
proverb holds true, and its course does
not run smoothly. Olga's master, who
owns her in serfdom, takes strong ex
ception to the course of events, and de
spite his wife's protest has David sent
to Siberia on the ridiculous charge of at
tempting to pervert a Christian.
Considering that David was already
married to the girl, this seems rather
strong, but all things were possible in
the Russia of those days. Powerful in
fluences, set at work by a friendly Eng
lishman, suffice to obtain David's re
lease from life-long servitude, the wicked
master, Michael Volkenoff, relents, and
out of suffering cometh strength to all
the characters concerned in the little
drama.

A CRITIC ON KIPLING.
To the intelligent admirer of Mr. Rud
yard Kipling, the great charm of that
writer's work is that it Is different from
that of everybody else. Consequently it
is with something of a shock that we
find the New York Evening Post com
plaining that the author of "The Seven
Seas" does not write like Wordsworth,
or Tennyson, or Browning, or Lowell, or
Mr. Aldrich of Boston. All these poets
were young in their time, and their early
writings bore the marks of youth. But,
says the critic, in the case of the Anglo-
Indian, "how few of the marks of the
poetry of youth are to be found in his
verse, bo far."
"This deficiency, this peculiarity, what
ever it be called," continues the critic,
"gives Mr. Kipling a distinct place
among poets of his years. The usual
order is, natural grace of manner first,
delicate fancies to begin with, afterward
the deeper breath, the firmer tread.
Grace may live to put on strength, but
can strength without grace acquire it?
Mr. Aldrich (to put a case) in a Juvenile
poem wrote:
The lily swung its noiseless bell:
And on the porch the slender vine
Held out Its cups of fairy wine.
Nothing so good of the kind is to be
found In all Kipling."
Once upon a time Dr. Watts of pious
memory wrote:
Let dogs delight to bark and bite.
For God has made them ao.
Let bears and lions growl and fight,
For 'tis their nature to.
Hut, children, you should never let
Such angry passions rise;
Your little hands were never made
To tear each other's eyes.
Now, it can be said with absolute as
surance that there is "nothing so good
of the kind to be found in all Kipling."
A little further on we come upon a re
markable accusation^ "The very images
under which he (Kipling) renders his in
frequent observations of natural phe
nomena indicate the subordinate part na
ture plays in his verse. Take this, for ex
ample, from 'The Last Suttee':
All night the red flame stabbed the sky
With wavering, wind-tossed spears.
It Is accurate, it bites in the fact; but
the murderous metaphor bespeaks a
writer absorbed in the play of brute
force and crime. The instance is char
acteristic of Kipling. There is nothing
in him of the contemplative spirit. He
rides reeking over the plains, and sails
the seas chafed and angry, here and
there affixing an epithet as he goes, but
too impatient to wait for nature's ora
cles. They are not given to those who
travel express."
There is certainly something entranc
ing in the image of Mr. Kipling sailing
the stormy Atlantic in a fast liner and
dropping epigrams overboard as he goes,
or careering through the jungle hurling
short stories right and left through the
open windows of his express train. The
only trouble about it all is that Mr.
Kipling has too much consideration for
his publishers and his public to waste
precious copy in that way.
WHAT THE BLIND READ.
With the close of the first twelve
months the Free Circulating Library for
the Blind has issued a report of its opera
tions. From a collection of 500 vol
umes, fairly representing literature's
wide range of subject and of form, it re
ports that Its patrons choose relatively
few books of fiction; that more interest
is shown in poetry, and that religious
works are in large demand.
In so unique a record can we not find
revealed, all unconsciously, the world of
dreams in which these sightless readers
live? Other men and women on the aver
age choose fiction, leave religion for a
Sunday afternoon and poetry for odd mo

ments. They read as much religion as
they do because the Sundays are so many
and so long, and they have opportunity
for very little verse. But the blind ap
pear to have chosen the religious and the
poetic before the books of fiction. It is
not the lives of men and women, their
loves and hates, their intrigues and their
marriages, their adventures and their
courage that attract them. Those who
cannot see live in a shadowy world,
apart; and the dreaming poets and specu
lative writers appeal to themâ the men
of thought, whose activity is in the same
sphere with their own.
They, too, may rhapsodize In thought
about the unseen lark whose melody
comes to their quick ear; they, too, In the
darkness of their affliction can find It
easy to wonder about that other world,
which gains with them no unreality and
remoteness in conception because it is
unseen. And the vivid imagination which
pictures other scenes and times, and
gives to fiction some of its fascination
for those who see, is lost on them, since
they cannot know the greatness of its
conquest. Not in activity but in descrip
tion is their grandest fiction.

THE SECOND FROGGY FAIRY BOOK-
By Anthony J. Drexel Biddle Phila
delphia: Drexel Biddle; London, Oay

The tone of "Shanty Town Sketches" is
fairly indicated by their title; humorous
skits and dialect sketches in prose and
rhyme have been reprinted from newspa
pers and magazines and will help to
make an idle hour merry.
How the worst boy in the sohool came
to be the best is told by Mr. McCaffery
in easy, flowing verse, and the story of
James Grey will appeal to lads who like
their moral lessons served up with good
paper and dainty ilustrations.
Little Effle's adventures with frogs and
butterflies is a happy effort of Mr. Bid
dies. The childish fairy tale is simply
told, and many a little one will fall asleep
hoping to dream of the heroine's roam

and the Illustrations, by Anne Pennock,
would alpne suffice to make the book en

WOULD YOU BE A MILLIONAIRE?
THE ART OF GETTING RICHâ By
Henry Hardwicke. New York: The
Useful Knowledge Publishing Com-
pany.
If you want to be a millionaire you
have only got to step up to a local book
store and expend 50 cents In the purchase
of this paper-covered volume. It is much
easier and cheaper than outfitting for the
Arctic regions and decidedly better than
life-long drudgery in a business office or
store.
The author, acting on Lord Bacon's
proposition that "history makes men
wise," tells us first how other people
have been In the habit of getting rich
ever since the world began. He deals
with the state of commerce during the
Middle Ages and then gives us details
about the manner in which some modern
fortunes have been made. He mentions
such well-known names as Vanderbllt,
Rockefeller, Gould and Russell Sage. An
astounding fact, showing the aggregation
of wealth in New York, is that 125 per
sons now hold between them a sum of
$500,000,000. The last portion of the book
is full of sound advice for intending capi
talists, and doubtless a rapid increase in
the ranks of the wealthy will follow the
circulation of this volume.
FOR LEISURE MOMENTS.
GEORGE FORESTâ By Waverly Greene.
New York: G. \V. Pillingham & Co.
THERE IS NO DEVILâ By Wurus Jo
kat. Chicago: Rand. McNally & Co.
The most remark.-iM" thing about the
first of these papqr -volumes is its binding,
a bright sage green, t;\idently suggested
by the name of the author. "George
Forest" is a novel with a purpose, and
like most works of this character, some
what dreary reading. Mr. Greene's fad
is temperance, and he urges that drunk
enness should be treated in its early
stages as a disease, and checked before
the vice has time to control the will of
the victim.
The famous Hungarian novelist Jokai
does not, of course, appeal so strongly to
English readers as to his countrymen.
There are many peculiarities in his style
which will not bear translation, but still
Mr. F. Stelnitz has given us a very read
able rendering of the romance "There Is
No Devil." As the book is clearly print
ed and published at the low price of 25
cents it should find many readers.
TO-NIGHT.
(From the Greek of Sappho.)
Like a long draught of rare old wine
The kisses of thy mouth;
That soft low sighâ so like a sob-
Breathes of the balmy South.
One rapturous hour of thy embrace,
More worth than weary yearsâ
Without thee, love and life would be
Eternity of tears.
Then silent lie within my arms,
Oh, lean upon my heart!
To-night, my love, we'll happy beâ
Ah, God! how soon we part.
One silken curl has blown across
Thy passion-crimsoned cheek.
Thine eyes are like the waves at night
So dusky, dark and deep.
A mad desire possesses me â
"The boon for which I sigh?"
To hold thoe ever to my breast
And in thy smile to die.
Thy milk-white arms they clasp me close,
Thy warm breath fans my cheekâ
What care I for the fates' decreesâ
For fame or fortune's freak?
One glance from out thy dusky eye
Outweighs all other odds;
To-night, my love, we'll happy be,
To-morrowâ to the gods!

SMALLEST WATCH IN THE WORLD.
THE smallest watch in the world
is at present on exhibition in a
show window in Berlin. It is the
latest triumph in the art of
watchmakingâ that art that has
made such wonderful progress within
the past decade.
The lilliputian timepiece was made in
Geneva. Following are given some of
the tiny dimensions of its works.
The diameter of the little watch is
less than half an inch. The exact
measurement is 10M- millimetres, or
.4137 inch.
Its thickness is three millimetres, or
.1182 inch, being but little more than a
tenth of an inch.
The length of the minute hand is
2 4-10 millimetres, or .09456 inch. That
of the hour hand is 1 3-10 millimetres,
or .05122 inch.
The entire works of the tiny watch
comprise ninety-five individual pieces,
Exact Size of
titty Cent Piece.
and its exact weight is 14.3499 grains,
or, according to the metric system, 93
centigrammes â less than a single
gram!
After having been wound up with
the diminutive key the watch will run
for twenty-eight hours The main
spring when run down has a circum
ference of .13396 inch. Its weight is 38
milligrammes, or .5902 grain.
Thf- weight of the foi r m-iin wheels,
with their springs, is 42 milligrammes,
or .6468 grain. 'I h^re are thirteen rogs
on the little cylinder wheel, which has
a circumference of 2 millimetres, or
.0788 inch, and weighs .75 milligramme,
or .01155 grain.
The balance has a circumference of
3.57 millimetres, or .140658 inch. In one
hour it completes 18,152 revolutions,
traveling a distance of 9842 feet 6
inches.
The most delicate tools and measur
ing instruments were made specially
for the construction of the lilliputian
watch. The preliminary work in the
making of the timepiece was very ex
pensive, and the selling price of the
watch- is comparatively low, being- $1360.HUNDREDS OF DOGS
BOUND FOR KLONDIKE
Goats, Donkeys and Steers Join the
Bow-Wows in Pulling the Pro
cession of Sleds.
TOPSY, the great St. Bernard, sits
patiently on the top of the plank
which elevates her above her
comrades, waiting until the pho
tographer has made his snap
shot.' Topsy. as you will perceive, looks
the very picture of gentle sagacity.
No one would ever suspect that a few
minutes before she had been engaged
in a rough and tumble fight with half
a dozen fellow prisoners, a fight so se
vere that only the muzzles with which
each dog is provided prevented san
guinary results. a hundred dogs on
There are over a hundred dogs on
board, all penned up together in a lit
tle wire cage on the afterdeck. Nat
urally they are all big dogs. No one
would dream of taking a small canine
to the Arctic regions. The terrier and
the toy spaniel are equally out of place
there The Argonauts of to-day are too
much in earnest to think of taking
Vith them. All they want is a
useful draft animal, though it is at
leaVt doubtful whether many of the
dogs now being shipped to the Klon
dike will repay the expense of their
passace. _
lops belongs to a Fresno man, one
of a party of six who are going to seek
wealth in the frozen soil of the north.
They intend to do things well, for they
have with them no less than thirty-six
dogs. And when you consider that the
passage money for each dog is $10, to
say nothing of the value of the animal,
which may be anywhere from $100 to
$200, the initial outlay appears large.
'"Are the dogs well trained?" I asked
my Fresno friend.
â¢â¢Yep; I should say so," he replied.
"I've been teaching them myself. They
very soon get used to pulling a sled,
in fact, after they have been in harness
three or four times they go along all
right."
"But will they stand the climate?"
"Don't see why they shouldn't. Got
plenty of hair on them. Look!" and he
thrust his hand into Topsy's great
woolly coat, while Topsy blinked at
benevolently, as much as to say,
"That's all right, master." Xo doubt
dogs of this class, with their inherited
instincts, will stand the cold all right.
It would require a very severe Arctic
winter to freeze them out. Their an
cestors made light of the snow drifts
and avalanches of the St. Bernard
Pass, where th^ good monks sent them
out nightly to rescue strayed travelers.
But locating lost wanderers on the Alps
was a light, gentlemanly occupation
compared with the task in store for
these gold hunters. In the picture
is of my yuth, I remember, the
St. Bernard was alwaye represented as
going about with a little keg of brandy
strapped round his neck, with the view
df offering a drink to any frozen-out
traveler. In the picture-books of the
next generation the St. Bernard will
appear in very different guise, toil
ing wearily at the heavily-laden sled,
behind him the master with the whip,
and before him a dreary mountain
waste of ice and snow.
One cannot help feeling sorry for the
dnes: their fate is almost certain.
These city-bred animals, brought up in
luxury, cannot at a moment's notice
adapt th*Â»ra l *e?veF tn the laborious life
i hi Eskimo d Â°g- Only the fittest
will survive the toilsome trudge over
the ice-clad rocks of the Chilkoot Pass,
and it is noticeable that most of these
dogs are being taken up by the new
hands.
The old miner who has served his
apprenticeship to Alaskan hardship
prefers to dispense with a team and to
do his own packing. It may be harder
work, but it is more certain. These
half-trained, unacclimatized dogs are
pretty sure to break down; their tender
feet will not stand the rough work over

the frozen snow, and even the most
carefully made shoes will not prevent
lameness.
These things, of course, are matters
for argument, and future millionaires
on the deck of the little steamer dis
cuss the question hotly while waiting
for the whistle to sound the note of
departure. The dogs, too, are giving
vent to their opinions pretty freely, and
it is a pity that, with our darkened
senses, we cannot translate their views
into readable English. It would seem,
however, looking at the expression of
the inmates of the wire-fenced pen,
that there is a general consensus of
opinion as to the undesirabillty of this
Klondike expedition. None of the St.
Bernards seem to care about going,
though they are too dignified to say
much, but the Newfoundlands bark in
dignantly, while the retrievers and set
ters and pointers and bird dogs and
dozens of mixed breeds, which nobody
can describe yel~> in chorus.
It is a canine pandemonium and con
versation is impossible at the after end
of the steamer. One fine, big, black
fellow grows so annoyed that, after
many efforts he leaps the pen and
stands on the deck outside. The poor
brute has been chained up short, close
to the engine-room skylight, with the
afternoon sun blazing on his thick
coat. No wonder he is suffering terribly
from the heat; his swollen tongue
hangs redly from his mouth, and he
even lacks energy to reply to a St.
Bernard on the other side of the fence
who is most anxious to do battle.
A humane bystander finds a bucket
of water and pours it over the poor
creature's head, whereupon one of the
ship's officers rebukes him severely, be
cause, forsooth, he is wetting the deck.
Ship's officers, when the gold lace is
new on their brass-bound caps, can
be humorous sometimes, though it is a
pity their humor does not always take
a kindly turn, and lead them to give
proper attention to the dumb brutes
under their charge.
As the hour for sailing grows nearer,
more men come hurrying down the
wharf, leading great black and brown
dogs, and one by one they are pitched
headlong into the already crowded
pens. The clamor redoubles at the
sight of each new arrival, the St. Ber
nards welcome each other with enthusi
asm as members of the same clan, but
the one Great Dane, who seems
strangely out of place amid this assem
blage Â«of long-haired animals, main
tains a sulky silence in his place of
state upon the skylight.
Still the dogs are not the only beasts
of draught on board. If you make
your' way .along the crowded deck to
the other end of the ship you will find
half a dozen horses and mules, though
these creatures are too commonplace to
excite attention. It is the goats which
attract general notice. There are seven
of them, moored by the horns, and for
tunately, whether by design or lucky
accident, there are several crates of
cabbages in the immediate vicinity. So
the goats placidly munch the green
leaves, while the warm sunlight plays
on their long silky hair. They seem ex
ceedingly comfortable, and if they are
always to be treated in this way, have
no objection to any number of Klon
dike expeditions.
Less intelligent than the dogs, they
have no prevision of the fate which is
in store for them. Their owner, asturdy
countryman, clad in one of the leather
jackets which seem, judging from the
number who wear them, to be consid
ered the most suitable garment for the
voyage, gazes admiringly at his
charges.
"They are the best animals of all for
the work," he remarks in sanguine
mood; "they'll do more than all the dogs
put together."
"But how are you going to carry fod
der for them?" I ask.
"Oh, goats will eat anything," he re
plies with the utmost confidence.
This answer in his opinion seems to
solve the whole problem.

WHY DO MEN STRIVE
TO REACH THE POLE?
Important Events That Will Follow
When Some Intrepid Explorer
Reaches That Goal.
WHAT is the use of trying to
reach the north pole? What
is to be gained for mankind?
What will you do with the
pole when you get it?
These are questions which every
friend of Arctic exploration is often
called upon to answer. They are pro
pounded in all seriousness and good
faith, and deserve reply in kind.
Many men who applaud a Lick or a
Yerkes for their liberal endowment of
1 great telescopes with which to discover
new stars in the stellar universe, says
the Review of Reviews, have fallen
into the habit of sneering at the men
who propose to discover the north pole
and thus add to our knowledge of our
own world.
Men who rejoice whenever a new fact
is learned concerning the heavenly bod
ies or the internal structure or history
of our globe have little patience with
those who venture into the unknown
regions of the north with a view to
learning what is there. They forget,
perhaps, that this earth was given man
for his home, and that the desire to
conquer and to know all of It is as in
stinctive as life itself.
The results of efforts to explore the
great unknown area about the pole may
be divided into two- parts: One has to
do with the extension of knowledge,
with the ascertainment of those facts
which build up and broaden and per
fect the sciences; the other caters to
love of adventure, to admiration for
conquest of difficulties, and certainly
these are not the least praiseworthy
traits of human nature.
To the man who asks, "Can people
live about the pole â what can be
grown there?" and who thus implies
impatience with exploration which
does not open up either mines or farms
or some productive industry, there is
no answer. The same man might ask,
Of what use is a poem? He must be
permitted to go his way, along with
the man who can see no value in dredg
ing the depths of the sea, scaling the
heights of mountains, or widening our
knowledge of the stars, because in
none of these places can wheat or
corn be grown or precious metals be
mined.
Bu- to those who look upon the gar
nering of every new fact concerning
our universe as a contribution to the
sum of human knowledge, and there
fore to human power and to human
happiness, the value of arctic explora
tion is obvious.
"Nowhere are more questions to be
found for which to seek answers,"
wrote Professor George Gerland, the
physicist, "than in the polar regions.
â¢ * * Man's disposition to make all
the earth his home and himself at
home everywhere in it is only sharp
ened by the problems offered there
and the tendency to go becomes irre
sistible.
"The explanation of the glaciation of
the northern part of our temperate
zone during the ice age, still unfound.
is a matter of great importance, for the
topography of the land at the present
time was brought out and the organic
life of the whole earth was modified
by it; and it is the general opinion
that the solution of the problem is to
be found, if it is found, by a study of
the polar regions.
" â¢ â¢ â¢ Man could not refrain
from inquiring into the nature and rea
son of these things if he would, and
hence he is willingly or unwillingly
led to the poles, where he is brought
into the closest relations with them
and where the explanations of them
can be most hopefully sought."

NEWS OF THE MINES
That there are undeveloped mines along i
the mother lode that will become Raw
hides, Utlcas and Idahos when faith and j
capital take hold of them is not doubted j
by intelligent mining men. There are I
unquestionably great bonanzas up there j
which are yet plain ordinary prospects j
which holders are vainly waiting to sell
or bond for a few thousand. In a few
instances capital is now putting a few
hundred thousand into properties which ;
seem to promise great things. One of
them is the Black Warrior, in Tuolumne i
County. Many mining men who know
something of the property and the re- |
suits of the development work of the i
past few months believe that the Black i
Warrior is destined to be another Raw- ;
hide, though but little has been said â 
about It. The latest account of this mine j
is given in the Sonora Union-Democrat as |
follows:
"Of all the mines in the county none
are being mor. aggressively developed
than the Big North Star and Black
Warrior pr. pert; on Moccasin Creek.
A representative of the Democratic called
at the mine one day this week and was
surprised at the vast amount of work
that had be> :i done both underground
and on top since his last visit. A force
of miners are at work in driving the
main tunnel to tap the east vein, and
when this is accomplished sinking will
be commenced, a series of drifts run from
levels that will be cut out as fast as
depth is attained, and the extraction of
ore commenced from both ledges simul
taneously. The west, or true mother
lode vein, lias already been crosscut by
the same tunnel and shows forty feet of
well-defined quartz, and tests made at
various points between the foot and
hanging walla show that it is universally
good in free milling ore, with a largo per
centage of rich suiphurets. Disinterested
mining men who have been permitted to
inspect tin- underground workings and
who are thoroughly familiar with good
and bad indication* on every ledge in the
county, unhesitatingly say that the North
Star and Black Warrior will unquestion
ably rank with the most prolific output
ters of gold in the State. All about the
mine are many improvements that have
1 D made lately, including new build
ings, shops, etc., while the engines, air
compressors, etc, are powerful and of
the latest pattern. Tne other day mere
arrived several carloads of new machin
ery for the mine, all of which is the best
that money can buy.
The mining enterprise of most Impor
tance to the Industry in a large region of
Southern California is the prospective fif
ty-stamp custom mill.smelter and cyanide
plant at Barstow, San Bernardino County,
the planning of which was recently men
tioned in this column. The development
of many new mines and the larger and
more profitable working of many others
will result. The establishment of similar
plants by capitalists is badly needed in
other districts of the State. Regarding
the new enterprise the San Bernardino
Times-Index says:
'â¢The flfty-stmp mill at Barstow is an
assured fact. The contract for the erec
tion of a steel-framed building and the
placing of fifty stamps, together with a
complete smelting outfit and cyanide
plant capable of handling at least 600 tons
of ore per day by the three processes, has
been let to the Colorado Iron Works of
Denver. The material is on the road and
the plant will be in operation on or before
May 1 of this year.
"The contract for the grading, etc., for
Bide tracks has been let to Knmish
& Marsh of Los Angeles and they will be
gin operations at once. They expect to
have the lower track done within a week,
when the materials for the mill, which
are now on the way, can be hauled tn and
unloaded and work prosecuted on both
the upper track and mill at the same
time. Water for the plant will be pumped
from the Mojave River to a large reser
voir on top of the hill, from which It will
be piped down. This will give ample
pressure for use in case of fire as well as
for all other purposes. The company fig
ures on using about 250,000 gallons of
water per day. With their fifty stamps
they will be able to handle 250 tons of ore
per" day. while with the smelter and cyan
ide plant they can work fully as much
""This is hy long odds the biggest piece of
McKlnlev prosperity that has struck this
county. It will enable mine owners who
have hot sufficient capital to put up mills
to have their ore worked and get their
money for it at once, as the company will
be prepared to pay cash on the spot for
everything brought in.
"It will out hundreds of teams and
teamsters to work hauling ore to the rail
road stations from mines which are locat
ed a few miles away from the railroad. It
will put miners to work digging out the
ore. It will give employment to hundreds
of men at the mill. All these people must
have clothing and provisions and the mer
chants of the county will be benefited to
that extent. In fact there are dozens of
ways in which the people of San Bernar
dlon County will be benefited by such an
enterprise. Â, , ,
"The Santa Fe Company will work In
harmony with the owners of the mill ana
will mnke such* low rates on ore that the
very low grades can be shipped from Ari
zona and even Nevada and milled at a
profit, while the owners of the mines In
San Bernardino County have a Klondike
brought right to their doors.

illustrates that there is no backward ten
dency in the general prosperity of the
camp.
The Rand mine, is producing eighty tons
of ore per day, which is improving as
depth is attained. The Wedge mine is
doing considerable development work and
the mine never looked better. This com
pany has made application for a patent.
The Little Butte is down over 400 feet,
and is making regular shipments of rich
ore of a sulphide character. The King
Solomon is another of Randsburg's deep
est mines which shows improvement as
depth is attained. Its main shaft is down
425 feet and the recent strike at the 413
foot level continues rich in free gold.
The famous Kinyon. or Good Hopemine,
which lately received Its Government
patent, has about 200 tons of ore on the
dump ready for the mill. The Napoleon,
over in the Stringer country, three miles
north of Randsburg, has produced $40,000
the past year from a shaft not yet down
150 feet, and is not for sale at any price.
All of the other deep mines In camp are
showing decided improvement as they go
down. In 1597 the Rand mining district
is said to have produced nearly a million
dollars in gold. Of this amount Los An
geles refiners and assayers have reported
handling about $2. r >o.ooo, but the bulk of
Randsburg's gold product finds a market
in San Francisco at the Government
mint.
Dry washing has revived considerably

A -j WSOTOBRT is still much used
rfor ornamenting certain descrip
tions of dresses. Inlaid lace or
guipure, spangles and precious
i.' 0 stones are frequently adopted;
but one of the simplest and pret
tiest trimmings is embroidery in cord, re
lieved by velvet chenille, like that on a
white cloth dress made by Ernest Raud
nitz, of which an illustration is given. The
skirt is quite tight fitting in front and at
the sides In the upper part. It is slightly
held up around the waist behind, and the
fullness Increases gradually till it pro
duces, by means of a bias, considerable
fullness at the bottom. It is ornamented
behind almost to the top and in the lower
part in front with light arabesque de
signs worked In black velvet chenille.
The front is made with a broad rounded
apron of white cloth, coming down below
the knee and embroidered with small
chenille flowers. Beneath the apron, en

PAREPA ROSA`S SONG IN THE DESERT
Queer Experience of the Famous Prima Donna in a Breakdown on a Stage Trip
Jlcposs tlie Plains to California.
IT was in 1K66, and we were travel
ing slowly across the plains In a
lumbering stage coach, instead of
flying overland in a luxurious
sleeper with a dining-car attached
and every other convenience. I
tell you we had something to complain
of in those days besides the alkali dust.
There was Parepa Rosa and her hus
band, and her maid, and De Vivo, her
manager; and there were a couple of
men, I remember, whom we suspected
of being Mormons; and there was a
quiet man, a very quiet man â in fact,
he never spoke and was no great ac
quisition to the party, as you may
imagine. And then there was the
driver and myself, and I think that was
all.
One Mormon, Carl Rosa, De Vivo and
myself played cards a great deal and
we managed to while away the time
rather well. The other Mormon flirted
with Parepa Rosa's maid, who was a
pretty girl with red cheeks and snap
ping black eyes. It was a great risk
he took, for the snap in her eyes told
plainly that she wouldn't brook a rival,
much less a family of rivals. How
ever, that was his lookout and, as we
didn't need him for a fourth hand, we
let him alone. The silent man was
out of everything, for he didn't play
cards, it was Impossible to draw him
out, and he didn't even seem to have
the gratification of taking in our con
versatlon, fur when De Vivo would tell
his adventures -or relate anecdotes of
the celebrated people he had met â and
De Vivo was a talker â his expression
never changed. For the matter of that,
nothing seemed to strike him or arouse
his interest until some one alluded to
Lincoln's assassination, and then, with
a faint show of interest and a slow
drawl, he said: "Dew tell! Is Lincoln
dead?"
We let him severely alone after that.
He was stamped "back woods," and
we never tried to draw him out again,
having come to'Â» the conclusion that
there was nothing to draw.
It was a glorious moonlight night. We
were rolling along smoothly enough. In
four days we would arrive at our des
tination, Salt Lake, and all was well.
"We had enjoyed a good dinner at five
and now we were happy in the remem
brance thereof, for it was far better to
look back on a good meal than for
ward to the uncertainty of the next.
Suddenly the stage stopped with a
sertkm, spotted with black chenille edged
with a narrow black trellis pattern.
These bands run all around the skirt and
rise up behind it: one of the two rows
rises to :i point as high as the waist. A
similar trimming ornament:; the skirt
around the bottom. The corsage is blouse-
Bhaped in front and tight in the back,
when- it is ornamented with flowers
worked in black chenille, and just above
the waist is a design in the same mate
lial, forming a kind of chevron. The up
per part of the back is ornamented
with a large square collar, also embroid
ered and edged at the sides with black
chenille insertion. This collar is con
tinual over the shoulder and forms point
lapels, descending to the waist in front;
embroidered in the same style as the rest
of the dress and opening over a front of
white frilled mousseline de soie. The neck
trimming is of the same material over
white satin. The sleeves are very simple
and tight from the shoulder to the waist.
â¢ bump and a jar, and came to a dead
standstill.
"What's up!" called De Vivo, and
[ he opened the door of the coach and
j sprang out. The driver was already off
1 his seat examining the coach.
"What's the matter? What's the
matter?" asked De Vivo Impatiently.
"Well," said the man at last, finish
ing his anxious inspection, "the tire is
broken, and we can't go on â that's all."
"But why not fix it? We will wait,"
said Parepa Rosa, with the charming
impracticability of her sex, and from
the rest of us were suggestions galore,
the Impossibility and futility of which
were made apparent to us one by one.
We were struck: helpless, immovable!
A long stretch of unpopulated district
behind us, a wide waste of country in
front of vs â no possible aid to be ob
tained, not a mechanic among us and
no hope of release from the situation.
Down upon us shone the silvery'
moon, lighting up the vast loneliness of
the plains â the dense growth of sage
brush â bringing Into clear relief the
fallen faces of our now hopeless party.
Then was the language of De Vivo
both loud and warm, for had he not
booked his star to appear in Salt
Lake City four nights hence, and was
not this delay disastrous?
Noisy were the lamentations of the
Mormons, heartfelt were the exclama
tions of disappointment from Parepa
Rosa and her husband, wild were the
regrets of the maid and strong were
my. own observations.
But the silent man spoke not. And
thus the night advanced and the moon
sailed up and up over the starry heav
ens. The driver walked sulkily about
his coach. The suggestions of the pas
sengers availed not. Gloom settled
down like a heavy fog over all, and at
last we were silent, having exhausted
our ideas.
Suddenly, upon the still night air,
was wafted the sad, sweet strains of
"Ben Bolt," and Parepa Rosa threw
her soul into it and sang as though an
enthusiastic audience were waiting to
break Into rapturous applause.
She stopped with a laugh. "At least,
let us make the best of it!" she cried,
in her jolly way.
The pause which ensued was broken
by the Silent Man.
"Gosh! that was great!" he said, In
slow accents.
But the rest of us found it Impossible
to rise to the situation.
"I kin mend that wheel," continued
the Slient Man, after a moment, "and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1898.
Tiny are eml.roidered with fine arabes
que designs, similar to those on the back
of the skirt. The waistband is round and
rather narrow, being composed of a gold
band ornamented with three designs in
gold arid precious stones, and fastening in
front with a square buckle. A toque
hat of white velvet, draped like a turban,
completes the costume. This hat is
trimmed on the right side with two black
feathers, one upright, the other running
along the brim and drooping over the
hair behind. In the center in front is a
strass buckle.
"I'll do it. Mrs. Rosa, if yer'll sing all
the time I'm workin'."
"Oh, I will; I will!" cried Parepa
Kosa.
"It'll take me pretty nigh all night,"
said the Silent Man, after a brief ex
amination of the damage, "but I'll do
the work if you'll do the singin'."
We all applauded, and the compact
was made. With the air of an expert
the silent man started work. It was
soon evident that he was a master me
chanic, and we clustered around and
watched his skillful worn.
"Within a Mile of EdinbortV Town,"
"I Dreamt That I Dwelt in . Marble
Halls," arias from "The Bohemian
Girl" and snatches of oratorios, song
after song rang through the still night
for the benefit of a very small audi
ence, and when the singer paused the
Silent Man, lacking inspiration, also
rested. The more he liked her selec
tion, the harder he worked, and he pro
gressed so rapidly under the strains of
"I Know That My Redeemer Liveth,"
that it brought a triple encore.
The moon sank down to the horizon;
the first faint, cool flush of dawn broke
In the west.
Oft in the stilly night,
Ere slumber's chain has bound me,
Fond memory brings the light
Of other days around me;
Sang Parepa Rosa.
"Great!" drawled the Silent Man.
"Well, we're all hunky dory. I guess
I've earned my concert, and you've
earned your ride, Mrs. Rosa."
"All aboard!" shouted the driver.
Into the coach scrambled the men,
back into her seat sank Parepa Rosa
with a sigh of relief, and -with a crack
of the whip and a sudden jolt, on we
rolled toward Salt Lake City.

in circulation on those islands.
The coin is about the size of a silver

made of vulcanized rubber. It 1b bright
red in color and is stamped with the name
of the man who made it on the obverse
side, while on the reverse is thenumber

"Veinte centavos" around the edge.

Rut the coin itself is not the most pe

A HARVEST OF HUMAN HAIR.
Perhaps there is no staple article of
commerce about which less is known
by the average person than the human
i hair. It will doubtless surprise many to
1 learn that the dealers in human hair
do not depend on chance clippings here
and there, but there Is a regular hair
harvest that can always be depended
upon. It Is estimated that over 12,000
pounds of human hair are used annu
ally in the civilized world for adorning
I the heads of men and women, but prin
! cipally the fair sex.
The largest supply of hair comes
from Switzerland, Germany and the
French province. There is a human
I hair market in the department of the
lower Pyrenees, held every Friday.
Hundreds of hair traders walk up and
down the one street of the village, their
| shears dangling from their belts, and
\ Inspect the braids which the peasant
j girls, standing on the steps of the
; houses, let down for inspection. If a
bargain is struck the hair is cut and
the money paid on the spot.
A woman's hair may grow to the
length of six feet. A single hair will
bear up a weight of four ounces with
out breaking, but the hair thus heavily
tried must be dark brown, for blond
hair breaks under a strain of two and
one-half ounces.
Dealers in human hair can tell in a
moment whether the locks offered them
have been cut off or combed out. They
do this by rubbing the hair through
their fingers. If the hair has been cut
from the head and has not been mis
placed It remains in its original posi
tion. If it has been pulled or combed
out and put together regardless of the
direction in which it grew one portion
of it will slip to the right and the other
to the left. It does this because the
' jagged edges catch upon each other
; and pull in opposite directions.
ming is of peach-colored velvet, is simp
ly draped, and covered with black lace.
The waistband is of black velvet, cut on
the cross, and fastens in the center in
front beneath a velvet bow, composed of
one loop falling over the corsage, and one
with single end falling over the skirt.
The sleeves are striped in circles and are
slightly puffed at the shoulder.
At Redfern's I have seen a costume of
' claret velvet for outdoor wear. The skirt
! is composed of gathers produced by ma
; chinery, the threads of which have been
I taken away and all traces of the process
obliterated. There are six gathers on
the skirt, the smallest being at the top,
and each bouillonne has three gathers.
The upper part of the skirt is made to ap
: pear very tight, and by means of volum
inous petticoats is widened very much
toward the bottom. The skirt is rounded
and touches the ground. The corsage Is
a blouse, gathered in the same manner
i as the skirt, made with a yoke of thick
i white silk ornamented with a rich design
of arabesques In silver and precious
stones; this yoke is prolonged into square
HOW TO WIN A WOMAN`S LOVE
Advice of a .Man Wfoo .Mappied Seven Wives, Was Jlppested fop Bigamy and *Now
T^ink.B .He K,nowÃ Jill Jlbout tfoe Sex.
HERE is the advice of a man who
has married seven wives on
"How to Win a Woman's Love."
The man is David E. Bates. At
present he is in jail, charged
with bigamy. Bates attributes his sue
; cess with the sex to "his knowledge of
; women and human nature."
Do I love my wives and do they love
i me? Earth contains no better, truer
i or fairer flowers, and I sincerely believe
I that each loved me with all the inten
sity of passionate love that good
women cast about their hearts' idols.
I was born and raised on a farm un
till my twenty-fourth year. I never paid
â  any attention to the fair sex until I was
18 years old. I did not go to parties or
dances. I was naturally bashful and
afraid of the girls. At the age of 18 I
accompanied a girl to a little country
party. It was my first effort as a beau.
Since then I have acquired great ex
perience in the ways of the world and
the ways of women. I will not speak
of my past or uphold or give details of
my career, except in a general way.
What I am accused of doing was from
no criminal desire on my part, and the
circumstances shall be held sacred by
me out of respect to those concerned.
After my first party I felt different
in every way. I was prouder of my
personal appearance and was more am
bitious. I looked upon woman with
different eyes. I began to think of the
kind of woman I would like to marry.
Should she be tall or short, fat or lean,
blonde or brunette?
At an early age I was made to be
lieve that the dark-haired girls were
sweeter, truer and better tempered than
the fair-haired ones; but I have been
forced to believe the contrary. While
the brunette may not exhibit such high
temper, yet her deep, quiet nature fur
nishes fuel to prolong the fire of her
angry passion.
While the blonde may fly at you like
an enraged tigress, yet the tempest is
soon over and all is sunshine again.
Wear a mustache If possible. I have
found that women greatly admire
mustaches, no matter what color they
are. Of course, this is merely an ad
junct, but it will help you to win your
battle.
Go about your suit with the cool de
liberation of a philosopher. Do not be

gree silver buckle enriched with precious
stones. The sleeves are gathered like the
rest of the costume and are tight from
end to end; they are finished with flounces
over the hand, beneath which are lace
undersleeves. Over this costume is a long

behind and prolonged in front into a bow

A theater wrap made by the same firm
is of black satin, very long all around,
which entirely covers the dress over
too gay. When a girl is in love with
you it is time enough for gayety.
When you are talking to her look
her squarely in the eyes; not rudely or
boldly but calmly and honestly.
Women do not like men who cannot
meet their gaze. They like to do all
the blushing themselves.
Much also depends on your feet.
Wear patent leather if possible. I have
also found, as a general thing, that
girls do not like red shirts or pink
neckties. They look too effeminate.
For brunettes I would suggest dark
and quiet clothes. Brunettes are gen
erally quick observers, and loud clothes
seem to annoy them.
If you are courting a blonde you may
wear big checks if you like. They do
not seem to care much about the
clothes you may wear so long as they
are in good taste. At least that has
been my experience. Blondes are also
fond of blue and white neckties.
Don't startle a lady with the vehe
mence of your love. The days of melo
drama have gone by. I have found
that love Is a tender plant, and must
be tenderly nurtured. Do not be a dude
No woman likes an effeminate man so
long as there are other kinds to choose
from. Do not use slang unless the lady
uses it. I lost a brilliant match once
by a pernicious habit of saying "You
bet." Then I quit slang altogether,
Let me tell you: No matter what
your feelings may be, do not let your
heart run away with your judgment.
Take things easy. There are very few
girls you cannot kiss before becoming
engaged to. Most of them will love
you if they kiss you. Therefore, if.pos
sible, get up a wager of â say a box of
candy against a kiss. Lose the first
two or three bets, until the lady thinks
she has a cinch. Then work in a sure
thing. Call as usual In the evening.
When the opportunity arrives insist
upon payment. Do not tremble or lose
nerve. The girl will blush and try to
change the subject. If she blushes she
will pay up. with proper coaxing.
If she says, "I prefer to give you back
your candy," all is off and there is noth
ing doing.
There should never be a trace of li
quor on your breath. Neither should
a young man indulge in cloves, sassa
fras or cardamom seed. Girls look upon
them as mere subterfuges. Keep your
mouth clean and you will have nothing
to fear. When the time comes for you
to kiss a young woman do not grab
them off like cakes off a hot griddle. Go
about it slowly. Do not dishevel her
hair or muss her collar, or take it like
I which it is worn. The ground Is emÂ«
broldered all over with bouquets of flow
ers, the centers of which are enriched
with bright-colored precious stones. The
back is made with broad pleats, from the
neck to the ground, widening as they
descend. The front falls straight and
opens down the center over a narrow flat
breadth. The cloak is trimmed down each
: side in front with a broad band of rich
Venice lace, laid on flat or turned over,
as may be desired. At each edge of this
i guipure is a wide frill of moussellne de

medicine. Kissing is a very Important
function, and an ignorance of its prin
ciples often leads to mutual disgust.
I lost the love of a most estimable
young woman once through pure care
lessness. We were engaged, and were
sitting one evening in the darkened par
lor of her home. J asked her for a kiss,
and without replying she put her arms
around my neck and started to kiss
me. By a piece of criminal neglect I
had a clove in my mouth.
She retired to her room, and shortly
afterward I was given my conge. No
effort of mine could ever win her back
again.
When the time comes to ask the mo
mentous question be sure that you are
dressed in your best frock suit, and be
equally sure that she is in a receptive
humor. â¢
Do not wear a dress suit. It is not
a graceful thing, either in case of ac
ceptance or rejection. I have never
knelt in proposing. In nine cases out
of ten it will make you appear cheap
and affected.
There are a hundred different ways
of telling whether or not a girl loves
you. I have noticed that when they
are in love they are full of softness and
curves. When they are indifferent they
are angular and polite. A girl will find
a thousand different ways of showing
that she loves you. Flowers, dances
and boats are all right, but you can
never win a woman's love with them
alone.
In conclusion, I would say don't for
get the little attentions due a fiancee.
Don't walk along the street three or
four feet in advance of your betrothed.
After marriage do not forget that it is
your duty in time of sickness and
trouble to share the burdens and sor
rows as well as the joys of life.

rived in the pr^at valley where the white king
of the Afarklse lives Tl >-y marched through
the wood? until they came to a lofty table
mountain that overlooked the valley. On the
mountain Harry < >stend found plants arrowing,
the leav.-? of which were as stout as leather.
He caused a large quantity of these leaves to
be cut and then fastened them together with
the gum of the glue tree. He had now four
huge sheets of cloth-like substance. Baskets
were maiie. each capable of carrying three
men and. with ropes, four great paracnuti a
were completed. In these parachutes the white
men made a Bensational descent int" the val
ley which was surrounded by I" rpendicular
mountains. Only by a trick did Harry Ostend
save hi? party from instant death at th.
of howlinp savages. He made the savages
think that he was about to Bet fire t the worw
and the black hi rde fled, but the sltuatl
the white men was still very perilous.)
CHAPTER XVII.
Harry Ostend at once set about find
ing a place for a camp, for it was not
safe or wise to go into the savages'
village then. Koti had interpreted all
that the witch doctor had said about
the white men having come to carry
away the white king. The witch doc
tor had awakened the black men to
such fury that a visit to the village by
any white man would have ruined the
whole enterprise, and might have led
to the death of Harry Ostend and of
all his follower?.
A small grove, which was almost sur
rounded by a thick hedge of briarsâ
such a hedge as Kemona had found
on the river bank above the great
waterfallâ was selected. Pineapple and
cocoanut trees and melon vines abound
ed in the grove, and through it ran a
stream which was well stocked with
fish.
The first care was to place the para
chutes in a place of safety. Looking at
the perpendicular walls of the moun
tains around all sides of the valley,
Mr. Ostend saw that, unless some ex
traordinary plan was devised by him,
his party was in a trap from which it
must be very difficult, if not impossi
ble, to escape. He therefore began to
think about a fire balloon of great size,
capable of carrying three or four men.
It was necessary that he should have
Borne light but very durable fuel, capa
ble of producing an intense heat, and
sure to burn in a gale, even should
rain fall upon it. ,This he secured by
mixing the gums of two very resinous
trees. One mass of this, he learned by
experiment, . would burn fiercely two
hours. The shells of enormous snails
furnished him the vessels in which to
safely carry the blazing masses of
gum. Mr. Ostend was now overjoyed,
for the parachutes had enough cloth
to cover a great balloon one of the size
needed.
By night as well as by day Kemona
and Koti acted, as sentinels that the
party might not be surprised. But no
savage came near the camp until after
the balloon had been completed. . In
fact a trial had been made, and it had
been found that the balloon would eas
ily carry three men. The white men
now had a way to escape, in install
ments, but how were they to get pos
session of the white king?â for he was
Jealously guarded.
When the savages came near the
grove, it appeared that the greater, part
of the nation must be there. Harry
Ostend had celebrated the success of
the balloon by exploding powder, which
he had buried in a mine. This caused
a quaking of the ground in the village
of the savages and excited their fears
anew. -. . - . \ :
' Their witch doctor had told them to
go to the white men and beg that they
would not shake the earth to pieces.
Harry Ostend had foreseen that the
savages would be alarmed, and his pur
pose was to force them to come to
him.
The tribes came with the sound of
BOYS AND GIRLS` PAGE
beating snakeskin drumsâ with the
wailing of women and children â with
the strange and weird chanting of sav
age death songs. Surely such a volume
of sounds of woe had never before
arisen in any savage land. First of all
in the long lines of dusky savages
walked their witch doctor. He was the
most magnificent man, physically,
that Mr. Ostend had ever seen. Not
less than 7 feet tall, with a build that
Hercules might have envied, he walked
like a king. His voice was loudest in
the chanting of the death songs. He
it was to whom all of the many thou
sands of savages looked for guidance.
He was like a statue carved out of
ebony.
His fellow-savages were all tall and
athletic. All, men and women alike,
were skilled in the use of the weapons
of savages. Their faces bespoke
ferocity and hate but â not less unmis
takably â fear of the white men. They
were now unarmed. Seeing this, Mr.
Ostend had no hesitation in going out
a.nong them, accompanied by Koti,
who would act as an interpreter. The
savages gathered around Harry'
Ostend, who waved them back. The
witch doctor spoke to them and they:
withdrew to a distance, but there they
could hear what was said.
"Who are you," demanded Harry
Ostend, "and what would you ask of
us?"
"We beg that you will leave - our
country and not bring woe upon us?"
"Are you the King of this people?"
"Yes."
"Do not lie to us," said Mr. Ostend,
sternly. "Bring us your King at once
or we will shake the land with earth
quakes such as will throw down the
mountains about your heads. Send us

your white King. Him alone will we
consider."
The witch doctor went to where the
savages were gathered and repeated
what had been said. At once war
seemed to be near. The savages de
manded that the parley should end,
and that the white men should be
driven out.
'"Better," they said, "that some of us
should die now than that all should
perish."
"Be it so," said Harry Ostend, proud
ly. 'The white men who came down
from the sky have nothing to fear.
Look to your mountains, that they do
not fall upon you this night."
So speaking, he waved his hand as a
sign. His watchful comrades upon the
instant, while Harry Ostend stood fac
ing the great crowd, with a smile of
disdain upon his face, lighted the fuses
to several mines that had been made in
the land surrounding the grove, for use
in just such an emergency. Hardly had
Ostend spoken, therefore, when the
savages on the knolls, upon which
there was the greatest gathering of
warrfors, felt the earth upturn beneath
their feet by some mysterious and hid-
den power. Smoke and sudden flame,
a noise as if the hills were being torn
from thoir bases, the odor of powder â
these startled the savages.
They looked up only to see Harry Os
tend standing before them, cool and
smiling', his right hand upraised, as if
he would call down from the sky the
power to finish the work of destruction
and really topple over the vast moun
tains from their bases.
He, at whose only gesture the solid
earth crumbled â he still stood before
them. Hark! He speaks to them

again.
"Your King- at once, or the work of
ruin shal! not stop until the mountains
have filled up the valley and you are no
more."
"It must be so," the people wailed.
"Oh, great witch doctor, bringtheKing,
that we may not allâ the warriors and
the women, the old men and crur little
childrenâ perish.
Silent the great multitude stood, si
lent and trembling, as the witch doctor
escorted from his village the white
King. But when the King and the
witch doctor, obeying a haughty gest
ure by Harry Ostend, entered the
grove, their wails and death songs
broke forth with all the strength of
the people.
The witch doctor had a cruel-looking
knife. This he held over the white
King, with the evident intention of
striking the King d..wn at any motion
he might make to escape.
Harry Ostend's time had not come.
The balloon was not full.
"One week from to-night," said the
King, in German, "my brave friend, the
people will celebrate the birth of their
witch doctor, with sacrifices of victims.
If you make a move now the witch doc
tor, who is at once fearless and a fa
natic, will kill me. Come, then, if your
courage and ability do not fail you."
"We will be there," said Ostend.
When the savages saw their King re
turn to them they were glad, and even
showed signs of friendliness, but Harry
Ostend mistrusted them.
"They will see us in their village," he
said, "but it will be in connection with
the most remarkable surprise that ever
yet befell to savages, since the earth
was made." Â£>â¢ W. H.

BERNICE AND
HER CHIPMUNKS
BY LILLIAN E. PURDY.
Way up in the mountains of Alpine
County, California, thirty-two miles
from the nearest railroad and 5676 feet
above the level of the sea, lives a little
girl of 10 years who has a special fad
of her own â she traps, raises and
trains chipmunks for pets.
Her pets are trained so that they will
come and lick her fingers when she
calls them. They are always glad to
see her, for she is very gentle with
them.
I have seen Rernice, the little mis
tress of the squirrels, with her furry
friends. Once, when Bernice had called
to the â squirrels, she opened the door of
a cape in which there were two chip
munks. Slipping her hand in she*
brought out one of her pets to show
me all his tricks and antics. She
stroked his soft coat, and the little
trembling creatureâ trembling, because
his rapid heart beats are observable
even to the tip end of his fur â licked
her hand and looked contented. Then
she placed him upon her head, and he
nestled there as comfortable "as a bug
in a rug." She then allowed him to run
over her shoulders and arms and back
to her lap again, and before the little
fellow was returned to his cage he had
been up her sleeve and even into her
pocket, where he was rewarded for his
performances by finding a heap of pine
nuts.
It is a curious fact that there is not
another member of the household who
dares lay a hand upon Bernice's pets,
for it will be remembered that chip
munks have sharp teeth and are very
fond of biting. Once, when one of the
pets made his escape from captivity,
Bernice's brother might have caught
the deserter, for he saw him on the
porch, but he knew that there was
danger near those pointed teeth and
the chipmunk would struggle against
being captured by any hands but those
of his gentle mistress.
For several summers Bernice has
caught chipmunks, and this she accom
plishes in a very simple manner. She
arranges the most primitive sort of
trap, consisting of a box and a stick
baited with apple or grain. The unwary
creature nibbles at the apple, the sup
port moves and the box flies down over
him. She thus catches him without any
injury to his slender body or downy
coat, and keeps him as long as her
sweet will pleasesâ which is from a
day to a year or two, and sometimes
longer.
At one time her company of pets
she keeps from three to six in the
cages. When she is off camping in the
summer she often catches three or four
in a day, plays with them and lets
them go at night. All animals, even
little insignificant chipmunks, know
their friends, and it is surprising with
what readiness they will respond to a
gentle touch or a kind word.
It is the habit with chipmunks and
squirrels and all other animals of that
family to lie dormant in winter, but
not so with Bernice's pets. Their cages
always stand in the neighborhood of
a warm stove, and there is not a day,
though the wind be groaning around
house corners and the snow piled to
second story windows, that Bernice
may not coax her mountain friends
from their cage and pass a pleasant
hour or two in frolic with them.
And food? Why, if she did not deal
out to them daily the pine nuts that
the Indians give her by the bagful in
autumn the chipmunks would be well
supplied with food, for they have a
larder of their own. They will crack
pine nuts with wonderful deftness,
peel off the thin skin, cram as many
as ten of the unshelled nuts into their
mouths at one time, running with them
to the second story of their house,
where they pack them away carefully
in the fuzzy mass that makes their
bed. Indeed, just under that scrap of
carpet of which I have spoken you will
see dozens of pine nuts tucked away
ready for the winter, when the deep
snow hides from them a daily susten
ance.
Crackers, bread and grain form also
a part of their winter fare. In the
spring, of course, when insects are more
plentiful, their menu is more varied.
It is then that grasshoppers are their
special relish. And many are the times
that Bernice had dropped a live grass
hopper into the cage to see them clutch
at it with lightning rapidity. They de
vour legs and head.
They make the little nest or bed of
HERE IS A NOVEL CONTEST
Boys or girls? Is there any superiority of
sex in literature ?
lit Is proposed to institute a novel competi
tion upon the boys' and girls' page of The Call
to assist in determining this question,
Upon successive Sunday mornings, the dates
soon to be named, there will be an opportunity
for a demonstration of the relative literary
abilities of our boys and girls,
One Sunday morning the boys will occupy
the page, The next Sunday the page will- be
given up entirely to the writings of the girls,
From the communications six written by boys
and six written by girls will be selected for pub
lication, Upon the six selected champions for
the boys and the six who represent the girls the
interest of thousands of readers will be cen
tered, The honor of occupying the represent
ative positions will be eagerly sought.
Now suggestions concerning the competition
are requested from all the boys and girls, Do
you prefer to write stories or essays? Perhaps
you fancy that poetry is your forte.
Mow do you wish to have the jurors selected
to decide whether the boys or the girls are the
victors in this novel rivalry?
Shall they be educators, journalists or Judges
of our courts? Suggestions upon these and all
other kindred considerations are now in order,
their house from scraps of cloth that
are given them for the purpose. If you
give them a bit of burlap four inches
square in less than fifteen minutesthey
will have it torn into a wooly mass in
which you cannot distinguish a single
thread.

CATHERINE'S SACRIFICE.
CATHERINE LEE was silent and
th "What Ul 'is my child thinking
about?" asked her mother.
"I have not found out any un
selfish way to celebrate my thirteenth
birthday." .
"Let me see. Yes, your birthday
should find you doing gV>od to some
one. Catherine, dear, I have been
thinking about Elsie Brown."
"My school rival?"
"Yes, your rival. Elsie's mother is
very poor and is an invalid. I called on
her only yesterday and found Elsie
there. The child was working busily
making dolls' clothes."
"For her dolls?"
"No. Her mother told me that their
money was all gone. Elsie must work
early and late. Often she toils at the
sewing machine until midnight. Rich
ladies have agreed to take the dolls'
clothes she makes for their children.
By such labor she keeps food and fuel
in the house."
"When does she study so hard? Oh,
mamma," said Catherine, with tears in
her blue eyes, "I see it all now. She
must give up her play time, and just
to think the girls have all blamed her
for being offishâ keeping by herself,
and they have called her proud, vain
of her scholarship. And, mamma, I
have done her wrong by thinking so,
too."
Mrs. Lee looked grave. "Well, my
dear," she said, after a pause, "there is
a way to undo your share of the wrong,
and it would be nice to perform your
duty on your birthday."
"What can I do?"
"Would my little girl give up her
promised birthday party for the sake
of Elsie?"
To give up that birthday party!
Catherine had long dreamed of that
party. Her little cousins from Philadel
phia, who had never been in San Fran
cisco, were to be there, Alice and Mary,
who were about her own age; and all
her nice friends had been invited; and
there were to be music and games,
cakes and candies and rich presents.
She had been promised a new piano
and she knew that her uncle from Phil-
adelphia would give her something fine.
- Catherine uttered a little cry of
alarm.
"It is not compulsory, dear," her
mother said, "you shall do exactly as
you please. Come, I am going to make
a call, and I wish you to go with me.
Perhaps you will be able to make up
your mind during the day."
A few minutes later Mrs. Lee and
Catherine were ready and walking
briskly along the street in which is
their handsome San Francisco home. It
was winter, but the air was sweet with
flowers growing in the door yards. A
few blocks farther on Mrs. Lee led the
way into a small court, removed from
the street, and. going to the door of a
poor-looking house, rang the bell.
"Catherine!"
"Elsie!"
The two girls were face to face. The
faces of both suddenly flushed. Elsie
had heard the girls mutter that
she was proud and unsociable and had
been hurt by their Injustice. The same
thought was in Catherine's mind, but
she impulsively seized Elsie's hands
and kissed her. That one act broke
down the barrier between them, and
tears rushed to Elsie's eyes.
Entering Mrs. Brown's home, Cather
ine's quick glance took in all the poor
surroundings of the invalid mother and
her heart smote her again. The call
was made short, for Mrs. Lee saw that
Elsie had many dolls' dresses to com
plete and also that on a table lay open
her school books, which she had evi
dently been studying as she moved
about doing the housework.
"Elsie has no idle moments, Mrs
Brown had said sadly, "she studies all
the time she is not working for me.
"Tut, mother," brave Elsie had an
swered, "by and by I will be a teacher
and earn lots of money. Then I will
take you to ride in the park, and you
will be strong and well. Besides
mamma, I am glad of the chance to
3Â£Sâ¢o'u how much I really love you
These words rang long in Catherine a
memory. All day she struggled with
her selfishness. She had several cry ing
spells before she could decide to give
up her party. When she had con
quered self she was filled with curiosity
concerning what her mothe- had in
V '"There will be no party, mamma."
she said softly, as she looked up and
saw Mrs. Lee. j Â
"Come then," said Mrs. Lee, well
pleased, "we will hold a charity fair
on your birthday; only no one must
know for whose benefit it is intended.
The birthday arrived and the fair
came off. What was the surprise when
Catherine asked her mother to put up
her new piano, her choicest present, for
sale. Her mother's friends vied with
each other in running up the price of
this instrument, and it was finally sold
for a large sum.
While the day was filled with self
sacrifice, Catherine was happy when
night came, and sang even as she saw
her piano being carried away. Her
uncle bought her a finer one the next
day.
Mrs. Brown never knew where the
large sum of money came from that en
abled her to have the comforts neces
sary to hasten her recovery. She may
have guessed, but Mrs. Lee and Cathe
rine never spoke of the matter. When
Catherine won the school medal for
which she was competing with Elsie,
her only real rival, no one was more
pleased than was Elsie. Catherine
would have given it to Elsie, but Elsie
said "No."
AN ADVENTURE
ON THE YUKON.
by harry Mccarty.
With rifle strapped across my back,
provision bag in one hand and survey
ing instruments in the other I started
down the Yukon.
While rounding a place where two
icebergs had toppled over I was startled
by a growl, which sent a chill to my
bones. Well did I know the sound. I
turned as I skated on and saw a ter
rible polar bear.
By degrees as I skated he gained on
me, till at length but a few paces sepa
rated us. In my desperation I un
strapped my uncharged gun and as best
I might at the speed I was going with
trembling fingers loaded it. I had little
hope in taking a successful aim in such
an awkward position.
But taking chances I turned, glanced
speedily along the gun barrel and fired.
Then I sped over the ice as rapidly as
I could go. The shot took effect and
the bear slackened his pace, but soon
my terror was reawakened when I
heard the brute's labored breathing
nearer and nearer. The wound I had
inflicted was not severe and he was not
disabled.
I turned abruptly toward the river
bank, hoping to escape by stratagem.
The bear might pass without noticing
me. A strap of one skate broke and I
fell. My reloaded gun was discharged.
Simultaneously with the report I heard
the ice crash. I rose just in time to see
the bear sink beneath the icy waters of
the Yukon. My bullet had struck him
just as he was on thin ice and by a
wonderful chance had hit a vital part.
I knelt upon the ice and offered up a
prayer.

THEIR OPERA, THEIR INDISPOSITIONS

Tn the past week the stars of the Bos- !

them. Macdonald has been out of the

hardly the boys he was several years

the Bostonians' stage manager â and an
excellent one, by the way â so I suppose
he knows who is the most available
and best fitted fo-r the part. But from
a this-side-of-the-stage point of sight

is any funereal features that time

have been the guileless Barnabee who
put Mr. Fitzgerald to the front as a
comedian. In some of Tuesday's papers,
you know, It was hinted that Barna

as it is known that Mr. Fitzgerald is
the next in succession I do not think
that this impertinent suggestion will be
repeated.

It gave me pleasure in an earlier is
sue to chronicle the success of Miss
Eleanor Giusti in Miss Nielsen's part
of Yvonne. I went to the Baldwin that
Thursday night in a somewhat skepti
cal mood. So much, too much, of the
friendly "advance notice" had been
published about Miss Giusti. Her fair
face was pictured to the extent of
many square Inches in nearly all of the
newspapers, and the panegyrics that
went with the pictures were such that

'. performance. There was nothing me
! teorlc about her singing, and she acted
as almost any clever amateur might
have acted in similar circumstances.
But what she did do was to reveal that
! personal charm which, in both vocal
1 and histrionic work, is the spine of
! success. Miss Giusti is in no sense a
j startler; there is nothing of the dia
j bolic, the insinuating, in her profes
sional make-up, and she hasn't the
' sporty twist of Alice Nielsen; on the
! contrary, her personality beams with
j the large, easy, good nature that is so
j signal in Jessie Bartlett Davis. There
is in her presence something well-man
[ nered, affable and unquestionably re
spectable. And as she bears out these
qualities in a true, companionable
voice, there is no reason why she
, should not become a characteristic and
valuable Bostontan. Next season Miss
â  Nielsen and her bankers will be out in
i the starry realms with troubles of their
j own, and the Bostonians might do
| worse than give Miss Giusti a serious
trial.
â¢ â¢
It will depend solely upon that good
nature of Jessie Bartlett Davis whether
her understudy. Miss Jennie Hawley,
has a chance at the calcium and the
glory during this engagement. It is of
no use for Miss Hawley to build hopes
on the decline of the Davis health.
Jessie Bartlett is indestructibly well.

A rehearing of "The Serenade" sug
gests to me nothing new to say about
it. While it is less intimately tuneful
than "Robin Hood"â a difference that
is shared by every other piece of the
kind that has been written in the coun
tryâstill it is tuneful enough, and in
both song and story fits the Bostonlans
very neatly. I haven't even yet been
able to grasp all the intricacies of Mr.
Smith's book; but that does not mat
ter. The song's the thing with the Bos
tonians. This unique band of all-stars
â or no stare, Just as you please â be
lieves in the good old fashioned comic
opera that is to be sung; and the
prominence must be divided with some
showing of equality. The soprano can
not be ignored; it would not be a Bos
tonian performance if Jessie Bartlett
were not well to the front; Macdonald
simply must be the barytone singer;
Barnabee will have his little fun; ditto
Frothingham; and who would dare to
slight Cowles, the only basso in the
business; and the tenor, even though
he be in a sense an outsider in the
present regime, must be given some
thing to do in order to maintain the
balance. And such super-fair distribu
tion excludes all one-or-two-star
operas. I do not envy the man his Job
who sets about writing a piece for the
Bostonians, and I think that in "The
Serenade" Harry B. Smith and Victor
Herbert have builded tactfully well.

The new week consists mainly of con
tinuances. The Columbia bids for the
attention of the first-nighters with Ma
rie Wainwright in a recent English
play called "Shall We Forgive Her?"
The title suggests a problem; the story,
as much of it as may be discovered in
advance, suggests melodrama. The
press agent is inclined to call it melo
drama, and says that this is Miss

Wainwright's first appearance in a play
of melodramatic nature. The press
agent forgets that Miss Wainwright's
last appearance here was in support of
Wilton Lackeye, and that she played
the heroine in "Captain Bob."
"Shall We Forgive Her?" is said to
be a play "built upon purely legitimate
dramatic lines," and in no manner de
pendent on mechanical effects or sensa
tional scenery. The first scene is in
Queensland, where live Neil Garth, a
vagabond miner, and his mistress. She
is a young woman who had known him
in England, and, when left an orphan,
had gone to him in the colonies as his
fiancee; but he had not kept his prom
ise, and she, a stranger in a strange
land, had accepted the alternative of
living with him. But, says the press
agent, her finer sense revolts at the life
she is compelled to lead and she re
solves to return to England. Before
leaving Queensland, she has an oppor
tunity to save the life of a young en
gineer whom Garth attempts to
rob. Garth turns upon her, and In
turn hep 'life is saved by the young en
gineer.
To London goes the wronged heroine,
where she enters upon charitable work
in the slums in association with Paul
Elsworth, a missionary, who once had
been in the colonies. She meets Oliver
West, and marries him without men
tioning her past; and all goes happily
until the evil Garth appears on the
scene, threatening exposure. She bribes
him, and while so doing is overheard
by Joana, a poor relative and former
housekeeper of Oliver's, who is very
much In love with that gentleman, and
who straightway informs him of his
wife's dark past. The wife is driven
from home in spite of the intercession I
of a friendly cousin; and Oliver awak- j
ens from the shock to find himself
blind.
Having lost everything that life holds
dear, the unfortunate heroine is now
driven to "literary pursuits" â as the
press agent calls them â and earns
enough money to secretly support her
blind husband and their child, and to
secure the services of a noted oculist
who- performs an operation that re
stores his sight. The details are now
explained to the husband, and all ends
joyously.
What becomes of the young engineer
is not told Jn the press agent's ac
count.
TiVoli.
"The Vlce-Admiral," Milloecker's
nautical comic opera, will be sung at
the Tivoli Monday evening. The opera
was originally presented in this city at
the Baldwin Theater by the Conried
Opera Company, and afterward repre
sented at the Tivoli on two successive
occasions with success.
The score is one of the most airy of
German comic operas, and possesses
many popular solos, duets, trios, en
sembles, finales and marches.
The cast will include Edwin Stevens
as the Spanish grandee, Don Mirabo
lante; Florence Wolcott and Edith Hall
as his daughters, Seraflna and Sybyl
lina; Tillie Salinger as their Cinder
ella-like dependent, Gilda, an orphan;
John J. Raffael as the Marquis Henry
de Villeneuve, rear admiral in the
French service; Phil Branson In one of
his greatest successes, Punto, the mas
querading sailor; Thomas C. Leary
will be the Donna Candida de Quesada,
the widow of the commander of a frig
ate and quite a sea dog; Arthur Boyce
and Fred Kavanagh have the parts of
her foppish twin sons, Don Narcisso
and Don Deodado, and George Cooper
is the leader of the serenaders, Don
Carambola.
Jhe Qrar\d.
"The Last Stroke," a play dealing
with the Cuban struggle, goes on at
the Grand next week. The piece is
advertised as one of Jacob Litfs re

of timeliness is certainly up to the min
ute.
The scene is laid in Florida, at the

taken unto himself a young wife. The
I American Consul at Caranzas, Cuba,
pays him a visit and effects his rescue
from his burning home, which has been
fired by the villain, who also abducts
I the wife. Two years later the wife, be
! lieving her husband dead, becomes a
| nun and devotes herself to nursing
i wounded Cubans. Vance appears at
Caranzas as a volunteer in the Cuban
army, and detecting the villain in an
assault upon the Consul's niece res
cues her, while the renegade escapes
by leaping from a high cliff. In the
third act a night attack upon the rec
tory is led by the escaped villain at the
head of Spanish mercenaries, who are
gallantly repelled by the Cuban sol-
I diers. In the fourth act Vance, who
ha^ been condemned to death on a false
charge, is again rescued by the Ameri
can Consul. The play is said to abound
in stirring situations, and the stage
settings are promised to be of an elab
orate nature.
OrpKeum.
The Orpheum announces several
changes and five new a.ts for next
week's bill. A strong drawing card is
expected in Lima Pantzer, who claims
to be the artiste supreme of the high
wire, and another novel feature will be
the acrobatic turn by the CarlDamman
troupe who are said to do a turn quite
different from anything that has yet
been 6een at the Orpheum. Other fea
tures are George W. Day, a monologue
entertainer, who is something of an
Eastern celebrity in his line; M. C.
Lawrence, the trick bicyclist, and Mat
thews and Harris in a sketch that is
said to be exceedingly funny. Tha
holdovers include Filson & Errol, who
have scored a success; tlie musical
favorites, Adelman and Lowe, and
Maud Beall Price, vocalist and mimic.
Baldwin.
The Bostonians will continue in "The
Serenade" all of this week. The fol
lowing week will be devoted to a re
vival of "Robin Hood," and the one
following that to their new work, "Rip
Van Winkle."
California.
Black Patti's Troubadours have dona
so well at the California that the man
agement has concluded *o retain them

Alcazar.
"Charley's Aunt" continues to crowd
the Alcazar at every performance. It
will play a week longer, giving way to
the comedy drama, "False Shame."

There will be no symphony at Thurs
day's symphony concert at the Tivoli,
but two symphonic poems will be
played by Mr. Scheel and his band:
Moskowski's "Joan of Arc" suite and
Saint Saens' "Rouet d'Omphale"
("Omphale's Spinning Wheel"). Bee-

"Merchant of Venice," and Ada R"ehan
will at last realize her long-cherished
ambition to play Portia.

The committee having charge of ar
ranging a grand fair to be got up In aid
of the building fund of the Masonic Wid- â 
ows' and Orphans' Home, now building in j
Decoto, at a meeting last Friday night
decided to hold the fair in the Mechanics'
Pavilion in the first week of May. The
fair will last one week. Sub-committees i
to arrange the details will soon be ap- j
pointed.
ORDER EASTERN STAR.
A correspondent writing from Nevada
City says that, not wishing to detract
one word of praise accorded to the worthy j
matron of King Solomon Chapter for the ;
perfect manner in which she performed j
the work of the worthy patron in addi- j
tion to her own, recently, he desires to
call attention to the fact that outside of |
San Francisco the dual work has been I
performed by worthy matrons, notably ,
by Mrs. Louisa Plummer of Evajigeline
Chapter, Nevada City, in 1895-96, and by
the worthy matron of Friendship Chap
ter, Elizabeth Agnes Fleming, of Lin
coln, Placer County, each having de
livered the patron's lectures.
Laurel Hall in the Shiels building was
the scene of a large gathering of friends
of Harmony Chapter last Friday night.
and the occasion was the presentation of
a most delightful programme of song,
music and recitation, given under the di
rection of Dr. Millberry as master of
ceremonies, assisted by Mrs. M. Short
and other members of the committee of
arrangements. The entertainment, which
was a most enjoyable one, embraced the |
following numbers: Recitation, Miss Ethel
Herman; vocal solo. Miss Ethel Lazarus;
recitation. Miss Mildred Levy: vocal solo, j
Mme. Seamour: recitation, Miss Clara
Dobbins; solo, Miss Coleman; vocal solo,
Mrs. Ellen Coursen Roeckel; zither solo,
Mr. Sonneberg; vocal solo, Mrs. Lewis; [
recitation. Mr. Rolla; funny stories. Ed
die Sweeny; whistling solo. Miss Cordie !
Wetjen; and fancy dance. Miss Lillian
Rhoades. Each number was loudly en
cored, and deservedly so. An effort was
made to recall Miss Wetjen a second j
time, but the charming labial performer
declined the honor. This young lady, who !
is gifted with an accomplishment pos- !
sonacd by but few of her sex. Is con
tinually improving in the rendition of se- !
lections, and the sweetness of her whist
ling charms every audience before which
she appears.
Golden Gate Chapter at its meeting
last Thursday elected two candidates,
initiated one and received one petition.
The chapter was visited by Worthy Grand
Matron Mrs. Eva M. Porter.
Mrs. Ella T. Hall. P. G. W. M., was

Reginald H. Webster. Superintendent of
Public Schools in San Francisco and pres
ident of the Board of Education, is a
native of Maiden, Mass. When he was
a year old his parents came to California,
where his father, who was a pioneer, had
established an extensive mercantile and
hanking business.
Mr. Webster's early education was ob
tained in Stockton, Cal., and in Boston.
At the age of 19 he graduated with honors
: from the University of California with the
: degree of A. B. In ISS2 the regents con
| ferred upon him the degree of A. M.
Immediately subsequent to his gradua
tion from the university, he equipped
Superintendent Ames of Napa County has recently issued the fol
lowing circular:
OFFICE OF SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS OF NAPA COUNTY.
To the Teachers of Napa County:
One of the greatest questions of the day is how to promote profes
sional education and keep the teaching force in touch with the spirit of
advancement with which we are surrounded. The doctrine that both
teachers and pupils shall move on the same planeâ that both shall be
tyros and learnersâ is crowding upim us. Absolutely speaking, this is
true; relatively, the teacher should be learned.
Our scheme for the last two years has been to present to you a
course in professional reading, the principles of which can be applied in
the actual work of the schoolroom, and devote one day of the institute to
its discussion. The historical work of last year will be continued. I
have before urged the formation of clubs, and I would again suggest
that these be formed where possible. The study of the year should be
made in the spirit that Pestalozzi suggests, of earnest inquiry. His
work is of intrinsic value.
The spirit erf Pestalozzi can not be accurately described, but it is
something akin to that of the painter that makes him an artist and cre
ator rather than an artisan. It -was this spirit that enabled him,
through the weary years of disappointment and misunderstanding, to
work out the theory that became the foundation of the reformation in
the German schools, and is to-day influencing all Europe and America.
The following subjects will be taken up by teachers of the county
and be followed by discussion: "Rousseau and Pestalozzi"; "Pestaloz
zl's Theory and Practice"; "What Pestalozzi Thinks of Home Train
ing"; "What Pestalozzi Thinks (it the Course of Study"; "What Pesta
lozzi Thinks of Method." Dr. Bailey will have two or three periods in
which to gather up the points made in the papers and discussion and
give their application.
Improvements in education are real and rapid. We live in a
day of intelligent thought, and must find our way to better
things in education. It is just as essential that a teacher should
know the interdependence of sensation, perception, imagination and
judgment as for a physician to know that of the lungs, stomach, liver
and brain. Without in some degree an understanding of this no teach
ing, even of tolerable excellence, can be done. Many teachers are pos
sessing themselves of this knowledge. Matter, method and spirit deter
mine all teaching, and to secure best results these should be in accord
with the individuality of the child. The spirit that animated Pestalozzi
âthat of earnest inquiryâ we should gather from his works, and in ap
plying it find better how to know the Individual child, and, knowing
him, surround him with opportunities better suited to his needs. Very
sincerely, KATE AMES,
County Superintendent of Schools.
himself for teaching, and by reason of
eminent rank in examinations, was elect
ed to the San Francisco school depart
ment, assuming the duties of his position
in January, 1878.
Mr. Webster immediately displayed
marked ability as an instructor, and after
four years of successful work in the
primary and grammar grades â during
which time he taught one year also in
the evening schoolsâ he was elected to
the Boys" High School, and later became
connected with the Polytechnic High. He
is the author of some magazine articles
on educational themes, including two
prize papers.
In November, 189G, Mr. Webster was
elected to his present position. His can
vass was made against odds, as his own
party was divided, but the plurality of
5000 votes he secured was a handsome
testimonial to his popularity and the es
teem and confidence he enjoys of those
who know him.
Among the most modern and best
equipped school buildings in San Fran
cisco stand those of the Irving Scott In
termediate Grammar School. This school,
which is the pride of the Potrero folk,
faces on one side a vista of rolling green
California Lodge. Such visits are very
pleasant and ought to be more frequent.
Grand Master Workman Vinter will
visit Tamalpals Lodge next Monday, and
on Tuesday he will be with Mount Ham
ilton Lodge of San Jose, which will hold
I an open meeting, when new banners will
be presented to the drill team of the
; lodge. Grand Receiver Booth will be pres
ent.
There was a large meeting in San Jose
last Monday under the auspices of Enter
prise Lodge. A fine programme of music,
song and addresses was presented.
Last night Crockett Lodge of Crockett
gave a party and entertainment. An ad
dress was delivered by Grand Overseer
Judge Bahrs. __
DEGREE OF HONOR.
An illustration of what can be done by
a few energetic members of a subordinate
body was furnished recently by Peerless
Lodge of Colusa. On the 24th of last
month the lodge met for the purpose of
surrendering its charter on account of the
lack of interest of the membership gen
erally. This fact becoming known to Mrs.
Kate M. Poland, grand recorder, who was
in the vicinity instituting a lodge, she at
tended that meeting and by her words
of encouragement aroused a spirit of in
terest in the few who had been faithful
attendants and a few more, with the re
sult that they nromlsed to start afresh,
j and at the meeting on the 9th inst. the
| lodge initiated eleven candidates, rein
stated one member and passed favorably
on two propositions. The lodge also paid
its per capita tax and ordered a set of
new rituals.
With few exceptions there has been an
increase In each lodge since the first of
the year. Progress Lodge increased its
i membership by sixteen In January. Rose
I City Lodge of Santa Rosa, started last Oc
tober with thirty-five members, now has
seventy-five names on its roll.
The peti#>n for a lodge in San Fran
cisco now has sixty-six names upon it.
Mrs. Evelyn F. Mayon, G. L. of H., as
sisted by Dr. J. L. Mayon, G. M. E.,
instituted Madrone Lodge In Lakeport
last Tuesday. The lodge has forty char
ter members.
Through the efforts of Mrs. A. T. Clip
pinger, wife of a member of Tulare
Lodge, A. O. U. W., a lodge of the Degree
of Honor was instituted in Wadsworth,
Nev., on the 12th inst. with thirty-one
charter members. It is known as Alpha,
and is the first instituted In the Sage
brush State.
THE NATIVE SONS.
Grand Trustee H. R. Noble will visit
Rincon Parlor In this city on the 23d and
Alcatraz Parlor on the 24th inst.
Last Monday the members of Sea Point
Parlor at Sausalito gave a ball that was
attended by a large number of the resi
dents of that place. The parlor was dur
ing the week visited by Grand Marshal
Dunbar.
Grand Treasurer Henry S. Martin paid
an official visit last Tuesday to Solano
Parlor at Suisun City.
Charles R. Heverin, D. D., visited Ukiah
last Monday and arranged for the reor
ganization of Uklah Parlor.
C. A. Carroll, president of McLane Par

hills, at this season covered with wild
flowers, while on the other side, up the
streets one catches beautiful glimpses of
the bay.
The Irving Scott school numbers this
term some 670 pupils, with perhaps a trifle
larger percentage of girls. Although Miss
Murphy, the principal, was transferred
here from the Le Conte only four weeks
ago, she has already found her way into
the hearts of boys and girls alike.
Whether reciting In the classroom, sing
ing in the asscmblv-hall or drilling and
playing in the yard, the children have
learned to respond with promptness to
her quick, decisive commands, and to look
eagerly for approving nods and smiles.
Thus tho whole atmosphere of the school
is like that of a big. pleasant home.
Large, airy rooms, delicately tinted and
flooded with light, are the rule in the
Irving Scott. The new cooking-room has
been but lately equipped with all the
paraphernu.Ua belonging to the art, and
will be ready for occupancy next week.
Miss Moran has been appointed teacher.
Miss Murphy recently learned that a
number of the boys were also very anx
ious to become chefs, und when asked
about the matter, ten of them emphati
cally declared their preference for the
work of the cooking- class over that of
the wood-working shop. When they
learned that there was s.ime doubt about
the purchase of materials, the boys took
up a private contribution among them
selves to defray the expenses. Little
Elias Otterbeck gravely assured Miss
Murphy that he would like nothing bet
ter than to become a "real good cook."
so that he could help his mother. With
pride he announced that already he could
cook griddle-cakes, porridge and make
coffee. Some of the hoys had an eye to
future camping trips; one boy was al
ready contemplating: cooking in the Klon
dike, while another little chap said, sig
nificantly: "You might grow up to be a
bachelor!"
Mr. M. Doyle, in charge of the wood
working shops, is a firm believer In the
aloyd system, which, however, he thinks
is still In an embryonic state. Its ad
vantages he enumerates as follows: First,
this system rivets the attention of the
pupil on the work from the fact that he

night.
Grand Inside Sentinel Lutrell and As
sistant Secretary Jamison have been con- I
fined to their homes by illness for some |
time past.
THE NATIVE DAUGHTERS.
Grand President Mrs. Belle W. Conrad
has announced the following visits: Mon- i
day, Vendome Parlor, San Jose; Tuesday, j
San Miguel Parlor; Wednesday, the par- [
lor at Watsonville; Friday, Santa Cruz
Parlor, and Saturday, San Jose Parlor.
On the evening of the 12th inst. the '
members of Alta Parlor had a joyous
valentine party in Shasta Hall. N. S. 8.,
which was attended by a great number
of the membership and many visitors. ;
There was a distribution of valentines to j
all present, addresses by Deputy Grand
President Mrs. T. Lunstedt, Mrs. Minnie !
Kalloch, Mrs. Clunie and Miss Walsh, !
and dancing to music furnished by Mes- |
dames Smith and Kemp Van Ee. At the !
close of the festivities there was served \
a collation.
The officers of Las Lomas Parlor were j
installed last Monday by Deputy Mrs. :
Lunstedt, D. G. P. assisted by Miss Mac
B. Wilkins, P. G. P. The latter at the
close of the ceremony paid the parlor a
compliment for the work it has done in
the past term, after which there was an
adjournment to the banquet room, where '
the balance of the evening was pleasantly |
spent, and the district deputy took oc- |
casion to express her pride of Las Lo- I
mas Parlor. Previous to installation four i
candidates were initiated. It was re- |
ported that everything was in readiness [
for the grand masquerade social to be i
given by this parlor on Tuesday even- |
ing next. Those who know the hospi- I
tality of the members of the parlor know !
that there is a pleasant evening in store !
for them.
Oro Fino Parlor will not give its annl- !
versary ball this year on account of the j
recent death of Miss Margie Hendrlx, who
was one of the most popular members of
the parlor. Her sudden death, from
typhoid fever, has affected every mem
ber, and all sincerely mourn for her, as
they all loved her.
Ramona Parlor had an open meeting
at Martinez last week, and it was at
tended by a large number of young la
dies, eligible, but not memberÃ of the
order. Tbere was presented a splendid
programme of entertainment, and the
evening as a whole was one of the
most enjoyable that has ever been given I
by a parlor of San Francisco. Miss
Marian Bertola, past grand president,
delivered an address that was received
with many marks of warm approval.
Last Wednesday Golden State Parlor j
initiated two candidates and had among
its visitors Mtes Mac B. Wilkins, P. G. P.;
Mrs. Genevieve Baker, D. D. G. P., and I
Mrs. French of Alta Parlor. Miss Rosa !
Day was Installed as financial secretary j
by the district deputy, assisted by Miss
Wilkins.
FORESTERS OF AMERICA.
Last Monday night Court Independence
had its hall crowded on the occasion of
the initiation of five candidates, the work
being done by the uniformed team of
Court Golden Gate with Julius Caiman
as Chief Ranger. The work was as
perfect as individuals can render it, and
the team was complimented by Deputy
Shaben and others for the memorized and
floor work. There were a number who
had for some time past been antagonis
tic to the new ritual, but when they
saw it so well exemplified .came to the
conclusion that, like a singed cat, it is
much better than it looks.
Grand Chief Ranger Saunders, Grand
Secretary Cordy and Grand Trustee Hogg
visited Court Rose Hill at Mountain View
last week and installed the officers for
the ensuing term, Grand Trustee Hogg
being the installing officer and the grand
secretary acting as marshal. This court
with a membership of thirty-six has $275
in its treasury and furniture valued at
$300. The new officers are R. M. Wy

produces something which can be used, i
For everything properly made in sloyd, j
Mr. Doyie contends, really has a use. If i
the boy understands this, he is interested. ;
In the old system common joining, halv
ing, mitering, mortising, dove-tailing, etc.,
are taught, the whole being mainly a
study in parts. Second, the latent es
thetic side of a childis nature is devel
oped to a higher degree by the sloyd
system, whereas in exact joining, on the
other hand, this is not at all a feature
of the pupil's education, unless one con
siders the architectural character of the
work. In sloyd the greatest attention is
paid to the study of curvature and form,
which develops a sense of proportion and
symmetry.
However, there is one defect in the lat
ter system, which lies in the fact that
the boy is often too eager to finish his
work, and consequently makes a botch of
it. Some might also assert that the stu
dents of sloyd are never as exact in their
work as those beginning with joinery.
But the great advantage of the sloyd sys
tem is its concrete teaching. This is in
perfect agreement with the ideas of es
talozzi and Herbert Spencer.
WORK OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
Tn my long experience as a teacher the
watchword of the lower grades seems to
be "cram," and "cram" supplemented by
".smattering" that of the high schools,
let I have only words of praise for the
conscientious, self-sacrificing teachers,
too often overworked, and my compli
ments for our modern text-books. The
fault in the whole system lies in too much
work, too many subjects, and a too fre
quently changed course of study, in spite
of our laws to the contrary.
I agree with Chadwick when he asserts
that a child from 5 to 7 years old can
concentrate attention on one subject for
fifteen minutes; those from 10 to 12 years
about twenty-five minutes, while the at
TERRITORIAL NORMAL SCHOOL AT TEMPE, ARIZONA.
ARIZONA boasts of one of the most effective normal
schools in the Union. It is located at Tempe, ten

till the Territorial Legislature of four years ago
made a grant of funds to start construction of a com
modious and modern edifice to replace the four-roomed
structure erected in 1885.
The formal dedication took the form of a reception to
the Governor and staff. Over 500 shook the hand nf
Governor McCord and then assembled in the school's
spacious and handsome auditorium. The Governor was

meeting received two applications for i
membership.
During her visit in the southern part of |
the State. Mrs. Emma Harrington, grand
chief companion, found that calls upon
the circles there located did much to en
courage and enthuse the membership.
She gave then very encouraging reports
and from the assurances she received
from the membership of the various cir
cles there is every reuson to believe that
the southern part of the State will make
a good showing by the close of the pres
ent term. The circle at Santa Barbara,
known as Ocean View, she discovered was
a credit to the order, A.he officers being en
ergetic and perfect in their work. On last
Thursday she was entertained by the
members of the circle.
At Los Angeles she found that Laurel
Circle has a number of go-ahead members
who are anxious to make their circle the
banner one. The circle gave a ball in her
honor, and in company with Mr. Krimin
ger led the grand march. She was shown
many courtesies that speak well for the
membership of the circle.
Her visit to the circle in Kern City was
a very pleasant one, and at the close of
the visit she was the circle's guest at an
entertainment at which the following pro
gramme was presented: Vocal solos. Miss
Mollie Thompson; declamations, Misses
Annie Cross, Allie Frazler, Maggie Har
rington and Thomas \V. Lockhart; stories
of the day. Dr. J. H. Fulkerson, and then
the visitor delivered an addresrf on the

During her stay in that city she was the
special guest of Mrs. Shaffer. The grand
chief returned on last Wednesday even
ing well pleased with her visit.
KNIGHTS OF PYTHIAS.
At a meeting of Golden Gate Lodge on
last Thursday night a resolution was
adopted extending sympathy to the be
reaved families of the men who lost their
lives by the explosion of the battleship
Maine, and expressing consolation in the
thought that they sacrificed their lives on
the altar of their country.
The endowment rank continues to thrive
and reports show that during the quarter
ending December 31, 1897. 105 sections were
organized and 2200 a--lications accepted,
making the membership 51,478. The
amount of endowment now carried is litt.
675.500. During the ouarter named $292.
500 was paid to beneficiaries of deceased
members, making a total of $11,873 since
the organization. The surplus now
amounts to $465,699 06. Invested in interest
bearing securities, the earnings for the
past term being $7570 71.
During the past six months Red btar

who axe preparing for the grand event to
toe given in Odd Fellows' Hall on the even

one of the grandest of its kind ever got

members as have paid their dues.
KNIGHTS OF THE MACCABEES.
San Francisco Tent as its last held re
tention of pupils from 12 to 15 ran be
held steadily for some thirty minutes.
Every minute in school after their power
of attention is exhausted forms a habit
of inattention in the scholars, which I
believe to be the curse of the American
school system. Another defect is that the
classes in our average schools, especially
In the cities, are too large in proportion
to the number of teachers.
A child of 6 years of age should work
but three hours a day. In the high schools
not more than seven and a half hours
should be allotted to study and recitation,
with the addition of half an hour for
gymnastic exercise. Three-fourths of the
ailments of school life can !>â¦â¢ traced to

PATRIOTISM IN OUR SCHOOLS.
How much in years gone by has been
engendered in that word "patriotism"!
what sentiment, what reality! In our
days of peace it can be interpreted in its
full inner meaning, and when we pause
to reflect upon the blessings of peace we
long to perpetuate it among us.
Surely the school room is tho center of
all effort in this direction. Far away
among our pine-clad hills in some remote
school room may be wrought most won
derful, lasting, patriotic sentiments. Here
is pliable material, here are natures
ready to imbibe the best that we as teach
ers can bestow. Is it not for the uplift
ing of the nation that we spend much
time in the study of the lines of our great
menâ not as dead facts, but as living,
moving characters; that we teach our
children patriotic songs, and encourage
the discussion of national events along
with the history lesson?

CALIFORNIA TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION.
On February 12 was held the first meet
ing of the executive committee of the
California Teachers' Association. Already
arrangements an- being made for the next
programme, which is to be presentee at
Santa Rosa during December 27-33. Upon
this programme the committee hopes to
have the names of President Eliot of
Harvaru, G. Stanlej Hall. Thomas
Hughes, Dr. Jordan and John Swett. It
is proposed to make the coming conven
tion the most interesting and enthusiastic
session yet held. In order to accomplish

give thf- greater part of his own time to
the work. At his right hand stands an
able coadjutor in the person of the secre
tary of the association, Mrs. M. M. 1-itz
gerald. This lady has long been widely
known in San Francisco and without, on
account of her reputation as a worker
of the most energetic sort, w.fh great
ability for the management of details.
She may be depended upon to snare no
time nor trouble to render the programme
a complete success.
The Santa Rosa peonle have already
started the work at their end of the line,
and propose to give the teachers better
accommodations than ever before, mis
they will be able to do. as the city con
tains a number of ane, large "halls, and
the people are noted for their hospitality.
It -s the intention of the San Francisco
members of the executive committee, es
pecially the secretary, Mrs. M. M. Fitz

Sonoma County teachers are well repre
sented on the programme.
Arrangements have also recently been
made for the publication of the last an

Pomona was a cattle and sheep range j
y years agoâ a part of the vast Ban !
ranch that was a Mexican grant, j
: When the Southern Pacific Kail
was built from Los Angeles to New
Orleans, a company of grangers saw the
: ilitlea there were for fruit grow- j
ing in so fertile and wide a valley, where
the climate was fostering and water
could be had for irrigating purposes from
the foothills and San Antonio Canyon.
'Some SOOO acres were bought from the
cattle and sheep herders, capital was in- j
vested in developing and in conducting
water to the soil, and Pomona took its
start. The new colony was appropriately j
named the Goddess of Fruits, for,
haps, nowhere else may such a great
variety of fruits b< gr iwn bo luxuriant

rewards of the horticulturists' labor so |

THE HOME
OF FRUITS
beauty spots for which travelers on the
cars watch on their way through South
ern California. With Its winding, gravelly
paths, its sweep of verdant lawns, its
uniquely shaped shrubbery, its curious
forma of palms ana its variegated flower
beds, it is a little gem. Out at the San
Jose hills that project Into the city limits,
one of the finest natural parks in this iv
gion is being formed. It is a big under
taking, and it will take large capital and
some years to complete' the plans for it.
Winding roads are being cut among giant
rocks and through copses of live oaks to
the summit of the hills, where may be
viewed a landscape, which no less an
authority â¢ than Charles Dudley Warner
once said was the finest of pastoral
scenery he had ever looked upon in
America, In future years, when shady
groves, beds of Mowers, terraces of green
grass and pleasure spots amid the shade
of trees shall have been created there,
Pomona will have as lovely a public park
as anywhere in the country.
The population of Pomona is made up
of the best class of people, who have
come from Eastern States to live in the
genial climate of Southern California and
to make their livelihoods by the most
charming of all human occupations under
favorable conditionsâ that of horticulture.
The domestic and cultured tone of the
Pomona people Is evidenced in the attrac
tive home surroundings, the steady at
tendance upon literary and musical en
tertainments, the number of clubsâ both
for men and womenâ self-culture In
science, literature, music and philosophy.
The first to lose his head, of course,
is Phillipe. He does not reach the
amorous stage so quickly as more vul
gar souls. Oh, no. He first admires
and then adores. He is still at the
mystical stage of love when he indites
these lines: "Everything about you
and your child, Heiene, appears a har
mony. Do not tell me that I am mad;
do not tell me anything, lest some ir
reparable word should come between
us. Rather let me keep the thought of
you within my heart as that of some
thing holy."
But the inevitable is not long de
layed.
"The hour has como," writes Philippe.
"I have deferred it till now, with all
the will at my command. I have lived
with my mad desire, suffering as of a
physical disease. I was waiting for
some opportunity of proving how utter
ly my heart, my life are yours â I love
you. I cannot live away from you."
Cier.tly and patiently Denise chides,
reasons and expostulates. She does not
affect prudery. She is touched, pained,
flattered by the man's failure to live
up to his ideal of friendship. She for
bids him to see her again for a time.
To help him. she will keep away from
Paris for a. time.
The French philosopher, who said that
the character and aspirations of a people
was best shown by their hands, certainly
hit the mark of truth, so far as Pomona
is concerned. New England has contrib

A prominent feature of Pomona Is trio
numb, r <>f its churches. .%.i arÂ« well
ki-i't. and man-- ar.- models. Several
church structures here are particularly
handsome and stately. All the
Christian denominations of tne world are
here represented by churches and targe
congregations, ;tnrt there are smaller con
gregations here of a large part <>f the
newer and oftshootihg â  >n iminatlons. In
;i word, think of all the Christian denoml
nations you ever heard of and you will
find a representative of each In Pomona,
besides several more. Altogether, some
twenty-eight religious congregations as
semble here on each Saturday or Bunday
for worship. There are twenty-one
church structures .n Pomona. The Meth
odist Episcopal, Congregational. Chris
tian. Baptist, Presbyterian mid Catholic
and Episcopal have the largest congrega
tions, in the prder of their Importance
named above. The local clergymen took a
census of the active church membership
i f Pomona a few years ago, and it was
found that over 2300 people here were
church membersâ a larger percentage of
churchgoers than elsewhere in a town of
Pomona's size in the Union.
The public- Horary of I'omona Is an In
stitution In which every one here takes
a Just pride. It was established by the
women of this city nine years ago. By a
series of flower festtvals â which, by the
Way, made Pomona famous throughout
the newspaper - reading worldâ several
thousand dollars were raised for the
library fund. The library is now a public
institution, and is supported by general
taxi s. It has over SSOO volumes, besides
a great quantity of pamphlets and peri
odicals. Its reading-room is well filled,
and to the youth of the community who
cannot afford to buy books and periodi
cals It has been an academy.
Secret and benevolent societies have
their quota in this place. The Odd Fc\
lOWS, Free Masons. Knights of Pythias
and Foresters are the principal organiza
tions. There are a dozen others, and
every weekday evening two or three so
cieties are- In session somewhere about
Pomona. The odd Fellows have a large
and costly building of their own, and

Thenâ he goes abroad. In a year or
so he comes backâ cured.
"Love is a fever." saysStendahl. "It is
born and it dies. The will has nothing
to do with it."
The months run on. Philippe and
Denise have resumed their old friend
ship. He loves his lady still, but in a
different way. His passion has been
changed to a less ardent sentiment. To
him she is, as ever, the most charming
of all women. But
"It rs oyr malady," he sighs, "it is the
malady of the century, that we have
not the strength to love. You are one
of the rare women whom I should have
loved to love, even before I had met
you, dearest lady. Now I feel what an
abyss would have divided us if we
had loved, and know what pain you
would have caused me by exacting of
me a vigor of soul which Is not mine
to give."
Au fond, perhaps Mme. de Tremors
resents the success of the treatment,
she has prescribed. But if she doss she
keeps her counsel well. Day by day
the, tender companionship becomes
closer and â to her â more perilous.
their lodge hall is one of the handsomest
of the order in California.
Pomona has been known as one of the
strictest anti-saloon towns in the country
for a decade. During six years of this
period it has been on a prohibitory liquor
basis, and during the rest of the" time it
has had but two saloons on the most
stringent high-license regulations ever de
vised in Californiaâ if not in the Union.
The drastic Pomona saloon law is known
far and wide among temperance people.
The coming of Xew Englanders and lowa
people has revolutionized ideas in this
land of the vineyard and wine press con
cerning the looking upon the wine when
it is red; so that Pomona is commonly
quoted nowadays for its prohibition and
temperance principles. There are two sa
loons now in this city of 6000 people. Each
pays $KK'O a year license, and each is un
der the most" watchful police surveillance.
That Pomona grows all the time is dem
onstrated in many ways. The constant
increase of school Children shows it main
ly. Four years ago two elegant, large
public school buildings were erected at an
expense of $40,000. It was thought then
by every one that ample accommodation
was made for the school boys and girls
for at least a dozen years. For the last
year the local Board of Education has
been at Its wits' ends to provide room for
the growing number of pupils, and there
are now plans for more large school
buildings. Ten years ago there were 308
pupils in Pomona's public schools; now
there are over 1200. The constant building
of new residences and the scarcity of
houses for rent show that the city is wax-

the growing 'weight of mail matter sent

Philippe is at her house constantly. He
is her confidant, her squire, her more
than brother. Yet the innocence of the
bond uniting them is never suilied. For
she is really a good woman, and he
does not love.
How is it, then, that having traversed
one great crisis safely. Mme. de Tre
mors at last feels that it is her turn
to confess her human frailty?
Partly, I suppose, the intuitive van
ity of even the best women would ex
plain her lapse from immaterial saint
liness. Possibly she grows Jealous of
an incipient flirtation between her very
material niece and Philippe. Or, as
the cynical philosopher assures us, per

The one great industry of Pomona Val
ley is fruit (arrowing. To be sure there
are other forms of agricultural activity
here. There are alfalfa and barley fields,
extensive apiaries and nurseries, but 90
per cent of the capital earned by Po
mona people is in orange and lemon
groves, peach, olive, prune, apricot and
pear orchards and in some vineyards.
The boast of the Pomonans is the un
commonly wide variety of fruit that may
be grown in this valley in like luxuri
ance. Pomona Valley is said to be un
surpassed in this respect by any other
section in the Golden State. While other
horticultural loca'ities may grow oranges

while still other valleys may have thou

Mme. de Tremor 9 (who is a musician)
composes a song or suite it is to
Philippe that she sends it to be praised
or criticized. When Philippe who is

vial amourette, it is to Denise that he
talks of his "bonnes fortunes"â as
some men might take to their club
friendg, thoughâ with a difference.
Denise, however, has not wholly
realized the imminent danger which
besets- her when she writes this pas
sage: "My friend, have you not felt
how wholly, solely, absolutely, I am
yours? Apart from you nothing now
interest me."
So, slowly for a time, and then more
rapidly, she passes from her earlier
platoniam to the absorbing passion of
a woman's first great love. A dis
paraging remark of Philippe about a
new dress which she has worn at the
opera angers her unreasonably, and
for a whole fortnight she is "not at

been restored she sends him letters,

Behold the weakness of my heart, the
disorder of my life. Philippe. I am
coming to regret I ever met you. Be
fore I knew you I was almost happy.
â¢ â¢ For pity's sake, Philippe, help
me; save me from myself: "
Much to his credit, Philippe does try
to help her. Had she not helped him
once?
Most happily for him (and far more
happily, Indeed, for Denise) his cold
replies at last have good results.
"Philippe, you are right; I was mad.
I wanted your love, a love equal to
my own, and nut your pity," writes
Mme. de Tremors on receiving wh,at ia
apparently an offer of moral surren
der. "I am not cured yet, "but I am
calm. The crisis is past. I shall not
die of it if I can keep your friend
ship."
Months later, when the anguish of
that second and most dangerous crisis
has been dulled, Mme. de Tremors
asks her friendâ now honestly her
friendâ to send her back her letters.
He obeys. And this is what she \vrites
after re-reading them;
"The beatings of our hearts, perhaps
the best of them are in these leaves.
What matter, dear, though we should
both grow old, while we can be so mar
velously, so amorously friends!"

EDUCATIONAL
UNIFICATION
Professor Brown Traces
a Constant Tendency
Toward It.
Too Little Provision Made for
the Education of
Geniuses.
Need of Improvement In the Pres
ent Method of Teaching
Literature.
Professor Elmer E. Brown of the de
partment of pedagogy at the State
University, in an address yesterday
morning: to a teachers' class at Berke
ley, declared that the history of Amer
ican education shows the constant
growth of a tendency toward unifica
tion. He compared educational ideas
of the last century and the ideas now
prevailing, and intimated that the
present system makes insufficient pro
vision for the discovery and education
of students of genius, such as many
earlier educators aimed at. In the
cmirse of his remarks Professor Brown
said:
"The idea of unification which plays
so important a part in philosophy and
ethics is an important element in the
American character, and the movement
toward unification is a very important
fact in our educational history. The
University of Xew York was the first
embodiment of this tendency toward
unification, and in time has had a
great effect upon the subsequent de
velopment of American educational in
stitutions.
"The tendency toward unification,
characteristic as it is of American in
stitutions, prevailed in revolutionary
France. The idea of education in
charge of the civic rather than the
ecclesiastical power, * which prevailed
strongly in America at the time of the
establishment of the University of New
York, also came from France.
"The old grammar schools were, so
to speak, a step downward from the
universities; the later high schools
have been a step upward from the ele
mentary schuols. The academy is a
comparatively independent type.
"The University of New lurk was |
founded in ii 77 S 4 . The ecclesiastical
character of Columbia College prevent
ed it from being made the central in-
BtitUtiOD of the system, Just as the
ecclesiastical character of William and
Mary College prevented it from being i
the central institution of the educa- j
tional system ut Virginia, and led to
the establishment of the University of
Virginia. Besides, In New York there
was, at the time of the founda
tion of the University of New
York, a strong disagreement be
tween the "college" and "academy"
factions, headed respectively by Alex
ander Hamilton and L'Hommedieu.
The result of this disagreement was a
Compromise in 17b7 by which the Uni
versity of New York was made entirely
independent of Columbia College, and
a system of academies and secondary
schools was provided for.
"No immediate provision for elemen
tary education was -made until later.
At present New York has two different
systems â the regents' system, including
the higher and secondary schools, and j
the common school system, which has :
charge of elementary education. These
two systems are to some extent united
by being both under the direction of
the State Superintendent.
"The idea of the University of New
York doubtless grew out of earlier the
oretical suggestions by Diderot, Four
croy and Talleyrand in France. Both
Fourcroy and Talleyrand took an' im
portant part in the establishment of the
University of France in 1806, and had
taken an interest in the establishment
of the University of New York. Each
institution, doubtless, exercised an im
portant Influence upon the other. None
of the other American States succeed
ed in attaining the university system
which was the central idea of the Uni
versity of New York. The attempt to
realize the university idea in Georgia,
however, is of interest, as indicating
the growth of the American desire for
unification, and as showing also the in
fluence of the University of New York
on the early educational history of the
United States.
"A unique system, devised prin
cipally by Thomas Jefferson, was pro
posed for Virginia. Schools were tv be
established in each 'hundred,' and
every year the best student in each of
these schools was to be sent to the
nearest grammar school. Here, at the
end of one year, one-third of the stu
dents were dropped; at the end of the
second year all but one were to be j
dropped. This one student was to have ;
four years more of free tuition. Of
these grammar school students, half !
were then to be sent out to teach school '
and the more proficient half were to i
have three years' free tuition at Wll- j
Ham and Mary College. These provi- J
slona were never carried into effect, but j
it is doubtful whether Thomas Jeffer- j
son's scheme of discovering and edu- j
eating the most promising geniuses 1
â would not be better than the system
â which prevails at present."

criticism upon the prevailing method of
teaching literature in the schools. He
said in part:
"Literature is one of the fine arts.
Like other arts, it must be a pleasure
and must appeal to the emotions rather
than to the intellect. Let us see. then,
whether literature, as taught in the
schools, is really giving pleasure, or
whether is is a torment. All children
have not equal talent or taste for liter
ature, but all have some taste, and we
should cultivate it.
"The trouble is that in the schools at
present we use literature as a means
of teaching the children to parse or to
diagram or to make a mechanical
study of figures of speech. Often the
thought is disregarded, and as a result
the taste, of the child for literature is
destroyed. Parsing, diagraming and
analyzing may be useful as subsidiary
helps, but the principal idea should be
to bring out the beauty of the thought.
Much of the grammar that is now
taught, however, would be rendered
unnecessary if the passage were prop
erly and intelligently read. So with the
study of figures of speech and the ety
mology of words. If the child shows by
his reading that he understands, do not
call him down from the enjoyment of
a piece of literature to compel him to
dissect words and phrases. Analysis
of figures and of words is valuable in
it? way, but for this purpose take the
t 'ongressional or Patent Office reports
rather than destroy the beauty of a
piece of literature. So with scansion
of poetry; scansion should be taught
not as an end but as a means of better
appreciating the music of a poem."
THE STOCK MARKET.
Mining stocks were firmer yesterday and
some touched the highest figures of the week.
Consolidated California and Virginia sold up
to $1 and Sierra Nevada to $1 10. Trading was
also better, and there was more life to the
market all around.
The feeling on the Bond Exchange was also
stronger and the lighting stocks showed a re
covery from their recent pronounced depres
sion, while the other favorites exhibited a ten
dency toward better prices.
The Elkton Consolidated Mining Company of
Colorado will pay a dividend of 2 cents per
share, amounting to $20,'>K>, to-morrow.
The Spring Valley Water Company will pay
a monthly dividend of BO cents tomorrow.
The Hutchinson Sugar Plantation Company
wlll pay a monthly dividend of 40 cents to
morrow.
The Consolidated California and Virginia out
put last week amounted to 20 tons of ore, the
average assay of which was $40 22 per ton.

SCAVENGERS`
GRIEVANCES
The Other Side of the
Question Fully Set
Forth.
President of the Reduction
Works Replies to Their
Complaints.
The Crematory Not Responsible for
the Increased Charges
Demanded.
Ex-Mayor L. R. Ellort, president of
the Sanitary Reduction Works, was
seen yesterday in relation to com
plaints made by the scavengers of this
city, In which they claim that since the
establishment of the crematory they
have been compelled to increase their
charges to householders from 50 to 100
per cent to meet the charges of the
He said: "It is not my purpose to
enter into any controversy with the
scavengers of this city. I desire only
to have the situation placed before the
publican its true light, hoping thereby
to show that we are not responsible
for the increased charges made by the
scavengers. The franchise for the in
cineration of the garbage of the city
was granted us by the Board of Super
visors about two years ago, and the
charges specifically set forth therein
and have never been exceeded."
The following is contained in a letter
to the secretary of the Merchants' As
sociation and in a measure covers the
bitant increase in the cna . g . T
scavengers fqr hauling away garoage, l
desire to say that the Sanitary Reduction
Works are 'not responsible for any such
increase, if there has been one.
Prior to the introduction of an inciner
ator for the disposal of garbage in this
city, 1 ascertained by investigation that
the scavengers received about $30,000 per
month for gathering the refuse and dis
posing of it. They now pay this com
pany about $140 per clay for taking it
from them and destroying it by fire, or
about $0500 per month. The receipts of
the Sanitary Reduction AVorks for cre
mating the garbage are a matter of rec
ord and may be ascertained by consult
ing our books. I need not say that the
latter are open at any time for the in
spection of your association.
I have been informed that the scaven
gers have increased their charges form
25 to 100 per cent. If they have done so
they are using the Sanitary Reduction
AVorks for the purpose of extorting
money from the public. The greatest In
crease necessary, if any. in order to en
able them to pay for burning their refuse.
should not exceed 20 per cent, which in
most cases would not exceed a or 10 cents
per month for each householder.
It is the intention of the Sanitary Re
duction AVorks to prevent extortion if
possible, even if it is compelled to em
ploy persons to collect the garbage It
self. In any event, I do not propose that
the company shall be held responsible for
whatever each individual scavenger may
choose to charge for gathering the gar
bage. The fact is a very slight increase,
if any, in their rates will pay for burn
ing the refuse of this city.
Mr. Ellert said further: "The city is
interested in the crematory to the ex
tent of 3 per cent upon the gross re
ceipts thereof, which he estimates will
amount to about $500,000 during the
term of the franchise, which is for fifty
years. As a matter of self-defense the
reduction works are putting on a large
number of sanitary carts, and many
contracts have already been made with
householders and others for the col
lection of garbage, cinders, etc. It is
expected that the whole city will be
covered within the next six months."
THE BALL WAS A SUCCESS.
Council No. 59 of the Y. M. I. at
Native Sons- Hall.
The first annual ball given by Ca
thedral Council No. 59 of the Y. M. I.

Ing proved to be one of the most success
ful given this year. There were about
two hundred couples present, among this
number being many pioininent members
and officers of the institute. It was a full
dress affair, and strictly invitational. The
committee of arrangements consisted of
the following members of the council:
John D. Mahony, Arthur Dollard. Fred
Farmer. Louis A. Kelly. P. A. Farrell,
James M. Hyland, Thomas F. Ryan, \V.
A. Hofmann, Chester W. Keogh and Wil
liam Lynch.

following: William F. Humphrey, Wil
liam O'l.eary, William Moore, Ed L. Mil
an, W. C HopptT and B. J. Hyland.
Those appointed on the reception com
mittee were: Dr. James P. O'Connor, Wil
liam P. Henry. Frank S. Drady, Jules
Hancock, William Rattigan and J. J.
Clifford.
E. J. Dollard, the floor director, was as
sisted by Constant J. Auger.
McKAY MUST PAY.
His Former Wife Secures Alimony
for Her Minor Children.
In ISS4 Emma McKay secured a di
vorce from Angus McKay, the court
awarding her the custody of the two
minor children. Mrs. McKay afterward
remarried. In 1897 the old case was re
opened and the plaintiff petitioned the
court for alimony for the maintenance of
the children in the sum of $50 a month
each from the time of the divorce, and
also for the same amount until the
further order of the court.
The court granted the petition, giving
her $3750 alimony. From this McKay ap
pealed, filing a bond. Then the court
made an order directing him to pay $250
to the children to defend the case in the
Supremo Court. The defendant next ap
plied for a writ of certiorari to the Su
preme Court to review the acts of the
lower court.
The Supreme Court finds that in accord
ance with section 38 of the Civil Code the
Superior Court has the power to make
the order for maintenance of children at
any time during their minority. The pe
tition is dismissed.

The directors of the Odd Fellows' Li
brary Association, Max Goldman, J. M.
Williston, William Thackeray, Maruca
Rosenthal. Charles A. Sumner, George J.

corporation. The directors decided to ap
ply for a dissolution of the association at
a meeting held on the 12th inst.

FOR GLORY
AND GOLD
This Is the Slogan of "Mexican
Pete," J^ate of Cripple
Creek, Colorado.
A Heavy- Weight, Just Arrived, Who
Challenges California
Pugilists.
Peter Everett of Cripple Creek, Col..
known In pugilistic circles as "Mexican
Pete," Is a new acquisition to San Farn
â  Cisco's sporting circles, he having arrived
In the city yesterday morning.
Everett Is the heavy weight champion
of Colorado, and a long string of victories
] is claimed for him, without a single de
feat to detract from their glory. His lat
est achievement was at Cripple Creek on
I the night of the 11th inst., when he
i knocked out Billy Woods in six rounds.
This new aspirant for gladiatorial fame
has invaded this part of the land for the
purpose of inviting local heavy weights
to tread on the tail of his coat. Provincial
i victories have commenced to pall on his
i thirst for gore, and he feels that he is
entitled to a compensative whack at some
of "the big 'uns," to thrash whom would
be something like an honor. He has had
enough of the small fry of country pug
dom and yearns for a go at the best tal
ent in California's fistic arena.
"Pete" will go Into training at once at
I Jim Carr's place. Sutter street and Cen
! tral avenue, and hopes to arrange for a
! mill before long. An effort is to be made
I to fix a match for him at the Jackson
i Jeffries mill before the Olympic Club on
i the night of March 22. He is delightfully
J impartial as to the personality of his an
tagonist and is generous enough to bar
none.
The newcomer Is a man of fine physique,
displaying undoubted indications of both
\ strength and agility. He weighs from 170
! to 175 pounds when in condition and is
only 23 years of age. He claims to have
fought thirty-three battles.
"Pete" is also a great lover of coursing.
and he brought hither from his old home
half a dozen fleet-footed hounds, which
\ are to run in the Grace cup competition
1 fit Ingleslde next Saturday. What with
his dogs and his "dukes." he claims to be
; well-equipped for his campaign for lucre
I and renown.
Neglect of Children.
The California Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Children has been pe
titioned by George Sells, a railroad man
llvirg at 523 Folsom street, to aid him in
securing the custody of his two minor
j cu'.Mren from his former wifv, who keeps
j a lodging house at 19V4 Sixth stro.?t. lie
! says thru she Is not a proper person to
! have the care of the children, and al
j leges thrt she once ran away from her
' home in BaktTsfield with Henry Klack
well, an engint-t-r whom Sells hu>i be
friended. He says he forgave this, but
when she ier-eatod the performr.iioe wl'.h
a man named Connors he turned her
away f: oni her home. Mrs. Andrew St.
Ores of 22^ Mason street has a similar
complaint lodged against her w'th the
society. She is accused of neglecting
her children, and a man named Duncan
Miller is said to be concerned In the case.

SUTRO'S
ESTATE
His Land Holdings
Comprise an Eighth
of the City.
By Rough Estimate the
Valuation Placed at
$3,000,000.
The Famous Library and Other
Belongings Worth Half
a Million.
NO APPRAISEMENT YET.
Colonel Little and David Rich Sworn,
but Thomas Magee Away on a
Hunting Trip.
A rough appraisement of the estate
of Adolph Sutro, declared to be of un
sound mind and incompetent of manag
ing his affairs two weeks ago by Su
perior Judge Belcher, gives its value
as in the neighborhood of $3,000,000. It
is believed that it is, if anything, worth
a little over this amount. The regular
appraisement has not yet been made
and the statement that such was a
thing of the past is denied by Attorney
Reuben H. Lloyd.
Yesterday the lawyer appeared in the
County Clerk's rooms at the City Hall
with a document. It was given to
Deputy Clerk Northrup, who stamped
it in the belief that it was to be filed,
but it was taken away. This gave
rise to a belief that the official ap
praisement had been finished. Ac
cording to Attorney Lloyd, the docu
ment was nothing more or less than a
certification by the clerk that Colonel
Little, Thomas Magee and David Rich
had been appointed appraisers of the
estate by the court. This certification
is necessary before any of them can be
sworn.
As evidence of the fact that there
has as yet been no official appraise
ment, Attorney Lloyd cites the fact
that only two of the appraisers have
been sworn, Little and Rich, who ap
peared before Notary Public Holland
Smith and duly qualified to act yester
day. Magee is away on a hunting
trip and no harmonious action is pos
sible until he returns.
A rough appraisement places the
value of the estate at about $3,000,000.
The land holdings are enormous and
include among them the Byfield tract,
real estate along the line of the Haight
street railway, the Cliff House prop
erty and Sutro Heights. Then
there is the Cliff House bath prop
erty and Sutro's library. The land
holdings represent about an eighth
part of the city and are worth about
$2,500,000. The library is placed at
about $250,000 and personal belongings,
including art treasures at the Heigrfts,
furniture, pictures, etc., are placed at
as much more.
Mrs. Merritt, the physician, daugh
ter of Sutro, is now in the active ad
ministration of her trust as guard
ian.
WOMAN SWINDLER CAUGHT.
Minnie Campbell and Her Accom-
plice Arrested in Los Angeles.
Captain Bohen received a dispatch
early yesterday morning from Chief Glass
of Los Angeles that Minnie Campbell and
her alleged brother, William Lewis, had
been arrested there. Policeman W. F.
Brophy left by last evening's train to
bring them back to the city.
The story of their villainy was told ex
clusively in Friday's Call. The woman
some months ago met Alfred Overend, a
wealthy capitalist, in this city, who be
came enamored of her. By various pre
texts the woman, assisted by Lewis, who
was introduced to Overend as her
brother, swindled him out of about $10,
000. He finally became suspicious and
complained to Chief Lees, and Policeman
Brophy was detailed on the case. The
woman and Lewis fled from the city, but
now they will have to answer for their
crime.
CHAFED WITH MAYHEM
F. L. Turpin, Proprietor of the Royal
House, Arrested.
F. L. Turptn, proprietor of the Royal
House. 126 Ellis street, was arrested yes
terday afternoon, on a charge of may
hem. He was Immediately released on
bonds.
The complaining witness, J. P Rudd, a
miner, is lying in the Receiving Hospital
with a broken leg. His story is that he
had been living in the Royal, but for pri
vate reasons Turpin wanted to get rid of
him. Friday night, while Rudd was sit
ting in the office Turpin called him out,
and, picking him off his feet, threw him
down a flight of stairs. Rudd was taken
to the hospital, where it was found that
both bones of his left leg were broken.
Rudd says he came from Alaska last
September, and was preparing to return
but this accident will upset his' plans.
He has a claim there.
Booked for Burglary.
Joseph Rechaud broke into the house
of Mrs. Hyer. 405 Geary street, on Feb
ruary 1. and stole a lot of clothing, part
of which has been recovered. He was ar
rested yesterday by Sergeant Helms and
charged at the City Prison with bur
glary.
IMPROVED ORDER RED MEN.
Past Great Sachem Williams of New
York in a letter to Past* Great Sachem
Chase of this city says: The Red Men
In New York aTe still booming. We have
instituted since last August seventeen
tribes, with an average membership of
seventy-live. I should judge that the
gain in New York State for the term is
about 2000, if not more. There are a
number of new tribes forming and the
wigwams are resounding with the war
whoops of braves and warriors returning I
from successful hunts. We hope to
make an increase in this great sun of at
least 5000. The members are filled with
enthusiasm for the cause and the desire
to place the Empire State at the head of !
the column of Redmanship. We are j
very close to Pennsylvania, only a few
thousand separate us.
Great Chief of Records Burgrman. as

Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal

by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure Is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north

but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain .south of Oregon is Im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Feb. 19.â There was a feeling j
of uneasiness over the European political situ- '
ation reflected from all foreign exchanges to
day before the opening of trading on the New ;
York Exchange. The collision of. British and !
French authorities in the Niger district and
thÂ» excited condition of the public mini In
France were the motives of the heaviness
which in London resulted In a fall of >Â£d in
British consols. American securities were af- |
fectefl By the general lif-aviness growing out
of f'uhan questions. Declines In Americans ,
reached a point in London in a number of I
eases before the opening here, and as a conse
quence tilling orders were placed for London '
account- at the opening. There was no local '
support for prices. On the contrary there was ;
a resumption of liquidation and bears were en- j
couraged to raid the market. Prices quickly
fell not only to the London parity, but below
It. The teclloea ranging up to three points i
and over Invited covering by the shorts and
prices harened. but at no time, did they fully
recover to the. close. Weakness apparent in j
Sugar made It the center of a fierce raid in
the final dealings and It sank to 125%, the !
whole list selling off to the lowest. There was
very determined support for Sugar at below
129 and the closing of the market saw a battle I
royal in progress between the bulls and bears, i
and the market consequently in a very unset
tled condition. Rallies of over a point were j
made by a number of stocks besides Sugar, but \
net losses were left on an average of over a ;
l.oint. London selling was a feature of the :
Â«ay and the supply of fl. Paul from that* 1
source was sufficient to meet a large demand j
here and keep the price down. The rate war j
in prospect between the Canadian Pacific and I
the Transcontlnpntal lines in the United States I
for Klondike traffic was a large factor, caus- j
ing a decline of three points in Canadian Pa- ,
rlfic and of less amounts in the other roads |
affected. _ , I
Union Pacific fours were very heavily dealt :
in two Individual transactions of a par value
of 12C0.000 and $150,000 respectively being re- I
corded. One block of lOO.OtJO of Rock Island ex- j
tension fives also changed hands. The week's i
development in the Cuban question effectually
unsettled the market and precipitated a heavy
liquidation of 'speculative accounts. Prices of
â¢e*urltles were recognized as discounting to a
certain extent future prospects, but confidence
In the future had been sufficiently linn to j
prompt the holding of long lines until the De
Lobm incident ana the Maine : disaster awak
i ened renewed uneasiness. This uneasiness
cauutd the bulls to abandon plans for any pres
ent .advance in prices and 'Caused
| the liquidation of numerous â¢ Holdings of long
stock as well' as the throwing on the market
of large amounts of stock dislodged by -un
covering or margins. The . bears suio*wed some
hesitancy during the week, and their haste . to |
cover at the low -level effected a rally on two
â  days, namely Tuesday and Thursday, after the
severest declines. There is a question as to how
far the powerful Interests which have of late
Â«rest controlled course question to how
the powerful interests which have of late
L-iy controlled the course of the market are
reducing their long holdings. . Hut the-situa
tion generally, aside from the Cuban question,
is recognized as a strong one. To-day s.tiahk
statement reflects conditions that may count I
lor some of the week's liquidation in -.Wall
street. It â¢ was expected that the movement
of money from New York and the withdrawal
of installment of the Government's deposits |
;t. It was expected that the movement i
loner from New York and the withdrawal !
D installment of the Government's deposits
of the Union Pacinc might be offset by a con
traction of loans resulting from liquidation on
the Stock Exchange. Instead there has -been
an expansion in loans of over *7,000.0u0 and a
decline In the surplus reserve of $t>,745.600. The
loan account Is probably affected by opera
tions in connection with ! the Kansas Pacific
Bale. Hut allowing for the undoubted reduc
tion of -loans -for stock ' speculation that must
have occurred there is still indicated a largely !
Increased demand for money, a good proportion |
of which has gone into commercial paper.
This indicates a good basis for the expectation
I among bankers that the money market . has
higher rates in prospect and may alÂ«o account
for the cheap rates at which sterling ex
change for future delivery is sold as com- <
pared with present rates. This, while it ;
i might curtail resources for immediate pur- j
' poses is a sign of the continued growth" of busi
| ness activity. The astonishing growth of our
foreign trade is indicated in the Government's |
report 'for January, the large - consumption of j
iron at advancing prices, the continued foreign !
demand for grain at high prices and the favor- i
able traffic returns of railroads all point to an
increase In values, but prices on the Stock Ex
change were unable to withstand bear -pres- j
sure for the time being.
Bonds were held relatively much firmer than !
stocks during the week and showed the cvi- ;
j dences of continued large absorption for In
' vestment. Business was not as large as in
I the previous week, which was of considerable
I volume, and net declines in prices were un
important. Total sales $24,220,000.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1898.
CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Feb. 19.â The most â¢ important â¢ In
formation which wheat ? traders had to start
with was the statement made by Joseph Letter
that he had -engaged, ocean, freight â  room for
4.000,000 bushels â¢of his wheat, all of which
had ben " sold to millers and consumes. Liv
erpool cables also showed some , strength. Tha
result | was | a very strong opening. . May start
ing unchanged to %c higher at from $1 03% to
$1 04, advancing' at once, to $1 05. There was
a remarkable scarcity of offerings, and It took
but : very : little buying to advance the price.
July : was, fully as active and strong as May,
opening : \L@%a { higher at . SBV4@B9c.". and . rising
to 90c ; before enough wheat came ' out to stop
the advance. The advance to :$1 05 in May
was followed by; He reaction, but reports that
500,000 bushels of Letter's wheat at Duluth
was to be shipped all rail to the seaboard
stiffened the . backbone of the market, and
prices soon, got back to the previous high
point and then passed it.": For half an hour
tne market held around $1 05 lor May. and 90c
for July. . July then suddenly broke loose.
i raders in trying to protect themselves against
weekly calls discovered that the market wa*
practically bare of offerings, and in > > their
anxiety to get wheat began raising their prices
half a cent at a time.. .'That brought short
Interests to the pit in a hurry. About the
same time brokers for Leiter appeared with
a number of buying, orders. . especially for
July. The market advanced so fast that
changes in price could hardly be kept track
oi. ah shorts tried to stop losses, and for
nearly a half hour the market was In a state
of excitement seldom seen. In the mean
time Hay had advanced :to $1 09 - and July to
.Â»â ,* <\ n ' ore than 5c over yesterday's close. At
those- figures the market- was flooded with
wheat on realizing sales, and : sharp declines
â¢followed. May dropping irregularly to $1 05 and
July to Â»19 4 c, after which the excitement died
down to a great extent. Nevertheless the mar
ket was extremely nervous to the dose, and
fluctuations in both of the futures were rapid
and at times violent. The ordinary news of
the day \*as entirely neglected. Closing prices
were $106 for May and 92& c for July Corn
was excited and -higher, due principally to the
bulge In wheat. May closed *6%c higher.
Oats was fairly active. TiTe strength of
wheat and corn was the Influence. May clos^l
?ic higher. .. . : ..; - . . "
Realizing in provisions j waÂ« pronounced all
day, but the demand was good, especially from
shorts. At the close May pork was 7&C higher;

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK, Feb. 19.â The Financier says:
The statement ot the Associated Banks for the
week ending February 19 is remarkable for its
loan and cash showings. Ordinarily an in
crease of $7,07R,800 in loans is accompanied by
a proportionate expansion In the deposits, but
in the current statement deposits are also sta
tionary, showing a decrease of $136,600. On the
other hand, there was a loss of $6,779,400 in
cash, the gain of $1,866,100 in species having
been offset by a decrease of $8,345,500 in legal
tenders.
Where this money went is somewhat prob
! lematlcal, but the statement analyzed as to
I individual changes shows one large bank to
i have lost, nearly five million In cash. Its
I loans remain at nearly the same figure pre-
I viously reported and its deposits have fallen
I off five million. Three^bf the other large
S banks seem to have lost three millions in cash,
I thus accounting for the total change of the
i week.
! The only inference is that the cash loaned,
ior an amount as large, has grown out of
banks, since It does not show in the deposits,
, and the increase in loans and the decrease in
cash almost exactl- offset each other. As the
reserve requirements for the week were not
â  affected by heavy deposit changes, the loss In
j cash, reduces the surplus reserve by almost the
! same amount drawn ou,t of the banks. The
j excess money in bank 1r now down to $25,688,
; 450, an amount almost one-half as large
| as reported for the same week last year. Since
! January 29. this year, the loss in reserve has
I been $10,000,000, while deposits have increased
I $16,000,0 M and loans $23,000,000. In other words,
j loans are expanding, faster than deposits and
' cash is decreasing as a result. Although the
; latter has been the case for only one week, it
j is significant as showing that the flow of
! money to this centeT has been checked to
meet growing demands at interior points New
i York Exchange at nearly all domestic centers
1 is at a discount and the actual shipments of
currency to the banks In a number of cities
widely separated is a healthful Indication of
! better trade conditions. If It continues, and
i the outlook Is that it will, a firmer money
I market will be only a natural result.

SMITH FAMILY DISCORD.
Judge Campbell Dismisses the
Charge of Battery Against
the Father.
The charge of battery' against Charles
H. Smith, cashier in the Southern Pa
cific Company's office, preferred by his
son. A. Carlyle Smith, was dismissed by
Judge Campbell yesterday after he had
heard the evidence of the complaining
witness and his mother.
Mrs. Smith admitted that when she
called upon her husband with her son
"Wednesday night at his rooms on Sutter
and Kearney streets she took with her a
horsewhip to use upon him if necessary.
While her son and his father were fight
ing she told her son to fight '.ike a gentle
man and not take any unfair advantage
of the old man.
The Judge, in dismissing the case, told
young Smith that if he did not look out
he was iiable to find himself a subject
for the Coroner. Mrs. Smith raised a
laugh in court by remarking, after the
Judge had dismissed the case: "I want
to dismiss the case, as I do not wish to
see my husband punished." She then
walked out of court with her young hope
ful. Smith was represented by Attorney
Walker, who did not bother himself to
cross-examine either of the two wit
nesses.

FIREWORKS FOR
THE FOURTH
The Ship Kenilworth
Arrives With Seven
Hundred Cases.
A Revenue Cutter for the Yu
kon River to Be Built at
North Beach.
Union Gas Engines for Use in Japan
ese Launches Being Shipped
on the Gaelic.
The American ship Kenirworth fin
ished a splendid run of 118 days from
New York to San Francisco yesterday,
beating the M. P. Grace by a month
and the Benjamin F. Packard by
forty-five days.
On October 4 last the Packard was in
latitude 24 north, longitude 40 west,
while on November 7 the Kenilworth
was in latitude 27 north 39 west. The
latter vessel has evidently made a run
away race since that time, as the
Packard has not yet been reported.
The Kenilworth was purchased from
her British owners after the Port Costa
fire and was rerigged as an American
four-masted bark. Handled by Ameri
can sailors she has proved herself a
clipper, whereas while she was under
the British flag she was not considered
a crack sailer.
Part of the ship Kenilworth's cargo
is 727 cases of fireworks, torpedoes,
nags and caps for the Fourth of July,
and as there are several other consign
ments on the way, the small boys of
this city will be well supplied on our
nation's birthday.
The schooner Nellie G. Thurston,
with a party of miners aboard for the
Klondike, left New York nearly a fort
night ahead of the Kenilworth, but
then she has stopped a couple or three
times on the way. On December 9 she
left Montevideo after a short stay, and
seventeen days later she was spoken
by the Cottage City while lying out at
anchor in the Straits of Magellan.
The French bark Marguerite Molinos
and the Kenilworth were in company
for a couple of days outside. The
Frenchman took IIS days to get here
from Cardiff, but a slant of wind
brought him into port a few hours
ahead of the American ship.
Work on the new revenue cutter for
use on the Yukon River Is to begin at
once. Yesterday Captain Hooper, on
behalf of Uncle Sam, signed a contract
with Birch & Co. of South San Fran
cisco for the boat. The hull will be
built at North Beach and the engines
by Birch & Co. at their machine works.
The sum of $40,000 has been allowed by
Congress for the building and equip
ment of the boat. As soon as com
pleted she will be taken to pieces and
shipped to Unalaska, w>;ere she will be
put together in 'order to be ready to go
into commission when the river opens
next June.
The Pacific Steam Whaling Com
pany's handsome new steamer Valen
cia "is being got ready for her initial
voyage to the gold fields on March 1
next. Deck houses to accommodate
125 cabin passengers are being built on
her, and an electric plant is being put
in. She will take away about 400 pas
sengers, some of them to mine and
some of them to go over the Valdez
Pass to the Klondike. The Valencia
will also go to Dyea and Skaguay, but
will carry freight only for those points.
The same company's steamer Excelsior
is expected to sail for Copper River,
Dyea and Skaguay next Tuesday.
Every berth on her has been taken and
she will only lie at Vallejo street wharf
long enough to take aboard her pas
sengers and freight.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany s Cottage City got away last
night for Dyea and Skuaguay via Se
attle with a big crowd of passengers.
She will be followed by the Umatilla
to-day, the Australia to-morrow and
probably the Humboldt and Excelsior
on Tuesday, so that the rush to the
gold fields may be said to be now in
full swing.
Owing to the Maine disaster and the
fact that the Marion's flag is now at
half mast, there will be no reception
aboard the sloop-of-war next Tuesday.
The dance to be given to-morrow night
by the non-commissioned officers and
men will take place, however. A gang
of men was busy all of yesterday put
ting in electric lights and on the occa
sion of the ball the Marion will be
lighted up for the first time by elec
tricity.
The Japanese seem to have taken a
linking to the Union gas engines manu
factured here in San Francisco. The
last steamer that went out took away
quite a number, and six more hava
been shipped by the Gaelic, which sails
next Wednesday. The engines are put
into lanches on their arrival at Yoko
hama and are used on the canals and
harbors of Japan.
Chief Wharfinger Root and Assist
ant Chief Wharfinger Scott started for
Bolinas Bay on a quail hunt last night.
A delegation of 150 people will be down
to meet the boat that brings them
home_ to-night. Each one of the 150
has been promised at least four birds,
so Messrs. Root and Scott will have
to do some tall shooting.
FRUIT BLOSSOMS
ON THE TABLE
Elegant Luncheons Given
by Mrs. H. L. Dodge
and Mrs. Preston.
Mrs. Henry L. Dodge gave a charm
ing luncheon on Monday, which closed a
most delightful series of three similar af

yellow; jonquils and acacia blossoms
prevailed.
Covers were laid for twenty.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1898.
SHOTS FIRED AT
CLOSE RANGE
Secretary of the Marine
Firemen's Union the
Target.
J. Sullivan, a Rejected Member,
Tries to Put Two Bullets
Into Him.
The Assailant Arrested and Booked
on the Charge of Assault
to Murder.
Bernard Ward, secretary of the Ma
rine Firemen's Union, had a narrow es
cape of being a subject for the Coroner
yesterday afternoon, two shots having
been fired at him at close range, both
of which fortunately missed him.
Ward bought a parrot Friday from
a fireman on the steamer Newport that
arrived from Panama. It was stipu
lated that if he was not satisfied with
it he was to go to the saloon of Marco
Mertivich, 207 Brannan street, and
make a selection from five others that
would be left there. Ward went to the
saloon about 1 o'clock yesterday after
noon and asked about the parrots.
There were several men standing at
the bar, one of them being J. Sullivan,
a marine fireman.
Sullivan went up to Ward and ac
cused him of preventing him from be
coming a member of the union. He
was abusive and Ward told him not
to bother him as he had business with
the proprietor of the saloon. Sullivan
left him, but returned almost immedi
ately with a bottle in his hand. He
again began to abuse Ward and the
latter pushed him away and took the
bottle from him.
Ward and Mertivich then left the
saloon and went upstairs to the lodg
ing-house to have a look at the par
rots. Sullivan lived in the lodging
house, and just as Ward bent down to
examine the parrots, which were in a
barrel, Sullivan came out of his room
with a revolver in his hand, and walk
ing up to Ward said: "Now I have
got you just where I want you," and
fired a shot at him. The bullet whizzed
past Ward's head and went through a
window. Ward quietly picked out a
parrot and was walking away when
Sullivan fired another sh*ot at him, the
bullet again missing him and burying
itself in the wall.
When Ward got outside he met Po
liceman P. Sullivan and notified him of
the shooting. Sullivan went to the
lodging-house and placed his name
sake under arrest. He took him to the
City Prison, where a charge of assault
to commit murder was booked against
him.
Ward says he has a faint recollection
of Sullivan wanting to join the union,
but as he could not put up the neces
sary admission fee, offering security
instead. Ward told him his application
could not be entertained.
SCHOOL FUNDS
ARE OVERDRAWN
Mayor Phelan Is Looking
Closely Into the
Matter.
Economy Must Bo Exercised to Bring
the Department Out
Even.
In response to a request from Mayor
Phelan, the following statement of the
condition ef School Department funds has
been furnished:
February 17. 1898. drawn to date $839,318 28
February 28, IS9S, allowance 8-12 of
11,200,000 800,000 00
Overdrawn to date 39,316 28
February salaries 8S,(jO0 00
Miscellaneous bills unpaid 26,000 00
Shortage at the end of the fiscal
year, at least $153,316 28
The Auditor's view of the account to date
was presented as follows:
February 17, 1898, appropriation $1,200,000 00
Deduct back salaries paid 120,840 45
Leaving $1,079,159 55
Monthly allowance $89.930 00
Allowance, 8 months to February
28 ! "719.440 00
Drawn to date 718,475 00
So that the shortage to date is only
the February salaries 88,000 00
Bills on hand 26,000 00
Shortage in eight months. $IH,OOO 00
Figuring on the basis of expenditures
since the beginning of the fiscal year,
there will be a heavy deficit as shown by
the tabulated figures, but it is probable
that expenses will be largely reduced dur
ing the next few months and that the de
partment will come out all right by June
30.

LIVE BASEBALL SEASON.
President E. F. Bert of the Pacific
States League Makes Some
Promises.
President Eugene F. Bert of the new
Pacific States League denies that the
Mission street journal is interested in
the latest baseball venture. In speaking
about the -matter Yesterday Mr. Bert
said:
"Nothing could induce Mr. Lawrence to
support another baseball tournament af
ter the experience he went through last
season. The constant squabbles and dis
putes which occurred during the ending
of the tournament sickened him of any
further interest. The Examiner will be
as much interested in this season's games
as we hope The Call and Chronicle will
be, and that they will do all possible to
arouse an Interest in the popular national
pastime.
"Wo have completed arrangements to
have the whole State represented in the
tournament. Sacramento will have its
crack team,- the Gilt Edges, to uphold
it, while Stockton will be represented
by a clever aggregation. Santa Cruz will
have the same team that made such an
excellent showing during last season, and
it is understood that 'Unhappy' Joe Mc-
Gucken will get together a team com
posed of graduates from the Santa Clara
College.
"The left field fence will be moved fur
ther back, and a live ball will be used
in each game. Central Park will receive
a thorough cleaning, and the new league
promises the cranks a season of baseball
similar to that seen in the halcyon days.
"Jac"k Bonnett, the present license col
lector and a popular athlete, has been
elected treasurer of the league. He will
lay aside 2 per cent of the proceeds of
each game, and the three teams win
ning the greatest number of games will
receive 50, 30 and 25 per cent of the
amount set apart. A beautiful pennant
will be offered as a trophy by Governor
Budd, to become the property of the team
winning the greatest number of games."
Ban Away From Home.
Stella Kleeman ran away from ber
home at 772 Tenth street, Oakland, last
Monday, telling her mother that she wan
going on the stage. Detective Anthony
and Policeman Skaln arrested her yester
day and she was sent home. She had
made arrangements to go to Stockton.
Stella Is a pretty girl 15 years of age, but
says she has no idea of "becoming an ac
tress. She told her mother so, as she
thought it would please her.
THROWN DOWNSTAIRS.
J. L. Rudd Becomes Involved in an
Argument and Gets the
Worst of It.
J. L. Rudd, a returned Klondiker, be
came involved in an argument with the
proprietor of the Royal House at 126
Ellis street Friday night and was thrown
downstairs, breaking his leg in two
places. Rudd was removed to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where he stated that
the trouble arose over the proprietor
being angry at his not standing in with
him.
He said: "I took some people around
town to buy provisions for the Klon
dike, and did not go to the places the
proprietor suggested. Had I done so
he would undoubtedly have received a
commission. Having been disappoint
ed he called me to his office in the even-
Ing and told me to leave the house.
I refused to do so, and told him I had
paid my rent. He offered to return
the money, but I objected to his mode
of treatment, and he became incensed
and threw me downstairs. I shall have
him arrested for doing so, and I will
also sue him."

fight at 128 pounds, and there must be a
decision. Neither man has been whipped
6n this coast. Lawlor has defeated all
comers since he entered the professional
ring, including Twoedie, champion of Aus
tralia, whom he defeated in two rounds.
McCue has whipped all comers also since
â¢his arrival on this coast. He won a de
cision over Yank Savage last Tuesday at
the Reliance. There will also be an eight
round contest to a decision between Yank
Savage and Jimmy Riley. Riley got a de
cision over Savage two months ago and
this will be to settle old differences.
Exchange of Sergeants.
Sergeant Davis has been taken from
Captain Splllane's division and sent to
the Mission district. Sergeant Anderson
will take Davis' place.

THE MONTEREY
EXPRESS DERAILED
A Hot Box Causes an Accident
at Twenty-Second and
Folsom Streets.
About Sixty Feet or Track Was Torn
Up, but Nobody Was
Injured.
Train No. 4 of the Southern Pacific Rail
road, known as the Monterey express,
was wrecked at noon yesterday at Folsom
and Twenty-secoftd streets, but fortunate
ly no one was Injured.
The train is due here at 11:45, and as it
was nearlng the city yesterday the engin
eer noticed that something was wrong
with the forward trucks of the engine,
but did not stop, as he attributed the
trouble to a hot box and thought he could
reach the freight yards without any mis
hap As the train rounded the corner at
Twenty-second street the rear axle of the
forward truck of the locomotive broke.
One of the wheels flew off. It struck a
four-foot board fence across the street,
tore a hole through it and stopped. The
train plunged on, tearing up the track as
it went, until it reached Twenty-first
street, where the engine jumped the track
and came to a standstill.
There were only about thirty passengers
aboard the train and these were transfer
red to the city over the various street-car
lines. A wrecking gang soon arrived and
cleared away the debris. Within two
hours after the mishap trains were run
ning as usual, and another pair of wheels
had been fitted on the damaged locomo
tive. _
