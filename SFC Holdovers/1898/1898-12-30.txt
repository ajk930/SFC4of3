VOLUME LXXXV.-NO. 30.
ARGUE LONG HOURS TO SAVE
MRS. BOTKIN FROM THE GALLOWS
Frank McGowan Demands Justice, Not
Mercy, in the Name of This Woman
Charged With Heinous Crime.
Attorney Hosmer Will
Close the Case of
the People To-
Day.
It Will Hardly Reach the
Jury Before Wednes
day of Next
Week.
THE dying days of the year 1898 will
act bring to Mrs. Cordelia Botkin
surcease from the conflicting emo
tions that beset her as her trial for
the murder of Mary Elizabeth Dunning
draws near its close. Contrary to expec
tations. Frank McGowan. In his closing
argument in her behalf, occupied the en-
Tiro Cay. District Attorney Hosmer will
me all of the allotted time to-day,
and this will carry the celebrated case
over until next Tuesday, when the attor
neys for each side will make their prayers
to the Judge regarding his Instructions
to the jury.
This charge will be of vital Importance,
as the construction placed by the court
on the law and the evidence in the case
will have, if anything, more weight with
the jury than anything else. There is a
possibility that this will . consume the
greater part of Tuesday, so the day on
which the jury will be charged and the
rase placed ki b hands can hardly be
earlier thai! Wednesday.
ttor Frank McGowan had the last
say to the jury on behalf of Mrs. Botkin
rday< Like his co-worker, George
lit, he spread hi? argument over too
great length of time and wasted his elo
quence on matters that caii have no pos
sible influence un the minds of the jury
men. Instead of dwelling on the alibi by
which Mrs. Botkin proves she was in
Kuivku on the day one of the anonymous
letters whs mailed in this city; on the fact
that there is no record on the books of
the < ' ! '..ri? iihr.wing- the sale of
handkerchiefs to a person residing at
Hotel Victoria, and such other mat -
ten -*ri<*re it is difficult to connect Mrs.
Botkin with the case, they are trying to
that the box of candy never went
through the malls to Delaware, that the
women did not die from arsenical poison
ing, and are spending time in such con
tentions.
The attorneys for Mrs. Botkin take dif
ferent points of view regarding certain
phases of the case. For instance, Mr.
Knight admitted that Mrs. Botkin had not
lived that life of h,gh ideals that an ad
mlr>:. but he declared she desired a chance
to live down the past und blot from her
memory those violations o the code of
morality which in part have brought her
to the bar of justice and placed her on
trial for her life. Mr. McGowan takes a
different view from this. He affirms that
â¢'tuore is not a blot on her escutcheon, not
a word breathed against her fair name
iX'i in those that flowed from â¢â  sin-pol-'
lutt <1 lips of Dunning."
The burden of his argument was the
Shadow of doubt that hung like a pall
over almost every link in the chain of
circumstantial evidence welded by the
ration in tne effort to connect Mrs
Botkin with the heinous crime of poison
ing two f.'tinwlilu women. He held that
the fabric of the case for the people had
fallen to the ground when they failed to

dwelt at length on the fact
Professor Wolf when he analyzed the
candy in Delaware found only lump ar
senic. In keeping with this he intimated
broadly that the police had' fixed the
candy so that when Professor Price an
alyzed it in this city he found the pow
dered drug. They had to do this to bear
out their theory as formed against Mrs
Ik'tkin.
One by one he paid his respects to the
witnesses for the prosecution. It was
thought that everything possible in the
way of vitriolic words, both written and

The San Francisco Call
1 ppoken, had been uttered against John P.
Dunning. He demonstrated that the limit
had not been reached. His compliments
to Miss Magpie Smith, coo~ of the Hotel
Victoria, and she is "a goggle-eyed pot
walloper." Then there was that "human
Jumping-Jack, Rosella. against whose wife
he had nothing, except that she should
have married such a man." Mrs. Ruofff
was a "flippant witness," and so on down
the long line.
Tears, the relief of the distressed, come
readily to Mrs. Botkin's eyes now. Sev
eral times yesterday she sobbed convul
sively, invariably placing herself where
she would show to the best advantage to
the men who have her future in their
hands.
Senator McOowan commenced his ar
gument upon the opening of court and
hammered away at it all day like a faith
ful artisan. His argument was scatter-
Ing-, going over the same ground again
and again, showing the weak places in
the case of the prosecution. He paid
tribute to his associate counsel and to the
Judge; whom he said was endeavoring to
hold the scales of justice evenly between
the people on one hand and the unfortu
nate â¢woman on the other. He "laimed
the case was a peculiar one, as every
technicality possible had been employed
by the prosecution to thwart what he
called the ends of justice. The defense on
the other hand admitted everything de
sired; everything was open and above
board, even ail the sources of evidence.
Had their client been guilty they would
have made a vicious, technical fight,
shielding and fighting against the evi
dence.
The speaker reminded the Jurymen of
the responsibilities resting: upon them,
but said they never before had so much
depending upon their judgment. Here was
a human being to be cast either into utter
darkness or to once again breathe the
pure air of liberty. He asked them, as
they decided the woman's fate, to think
of "the dimpled fingers of their loved ones
that wound their way into the tendrils of
their hearts." The pitiless storm that for
some time past has beat down upon Mrs.
Botkin must soon cease, he said, as, when
she placed her case In the hands of the
jury, she felt she had reached a harbor of
safety.
McGowan dwelt, long upon the question
lof circumstantial evidence. He cited the
j present case as one .vhere there was an
| unusual amount of doubt as to the relia
bility of certain testimony. He said that
if a fact could be construed either toward
guilt or Innocence that it must be con
strued toward innocence, the law not per
mitting Its construction toward guilt. He
said his client was not before them cring
ing for sympathy, but was seeking only
â¢ Justice. The case against her was not
j proved by the evidence adduced by the
prosecution, to such a point as to Justify
them in taking the life of the woman. He
deplored the heinous crime by which the
lives of two estimable women were ended,
but their death, he said, did not afford a
i reason why that offense should be fol
lowed by another one.
Mr. McGowan spoke of unreliable and
â  unworthy circumstantial evidence, saying
if one link had to be molded or changed

SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 30, 1898.
ATTORNEY HcGOWAN PLEADS FOR MRS. BOTKIN.
Counsel for the accused woman claims that the prosecution has not formed
a chain of circumstantial evidence connecting her with the Dover tragedies.
Contrary to expectations, he consumed the entire day with his argument.
He attacked the credibility of the witnesses for the people, and demanded
justice, not sympathy, for the woman on trial for her life.
It was a confession it was not consistent
with the case. He claimed that there
had been a tampering with and a manu
facture of evidence in the case. A dis
cussion of the testimony was then com
menced and doubt was east upon all pre
sented by the prosecution. He doubted
whether the candy box had ever gone
through the mailâ from its unbroken ap
pearance he did not believe it had. He
said Postmaster Goodin dirt not know it
went through the mail because he did not
lift it out of the mail sack himself. He
spoke of Chief Lees as "Ah Lee engaged
in ironing out the wrapper and thus ef
fectually removing the evidences that
would show whether it had ever been
wrapped around another box."
WONDERFUL DISCOVERY
IN ELECTRICAL FORCE
One Million Volts Can Be Diffused in the
Body and All Forms of Bacilli
Destroyed.
Call Office, Riggs House,
WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec. 29.
There will soon be filed fn the Patent Office an appli
cation for a patent on a discovery in electro-therapeutics
which promises to create a tremendous sensation In the
medical and electrical world. It will be shown that glass
is the conductor of an electric current of wonderful elec
tro-motive force, but by means of the Intervention of glass
plates. It is positively asserted that by the process to be
patented 1,000,000 volts of electro-motive force may be
diffused and evenly charged to all parts of the human
body, not only without physical sensation to the patient
but so as to bring sure death to all forms of bacilli, In
cluding tuberculosis.
Parasites to Destroy .tests.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 29.â The Super
i visors of this county have received a re
! port from George Compere, their eom
i missioner in Hawaii, who was sent there
', for the purpose of securing parasites for
â  fruit tree posts. He states that he has
forwarded parasites which destroy aphis
! and also the pests which have been at
tacking the English walnut trees. The
I success of the new acquisitions will be
1 watched with Interest by fruit men.
He next attacked the theory of the
prosecution as to the motive. There was
no adequate motive to drive this woman
to such a crime or suddenly develop this
criminal instinct. He said there was
"not a blot on her fair name, not a stain
on her escutcheon." The prosecution
holds, he said, that this woman was en
amored of Dunning and had murdered
his wife to get him. He said Dunning
was neither mentally, morally nor phys
ically the man that any woman would
commit crime for. She had every posses
sion of him. She fed him, clothed him.
put shoes on his feet and provided a
house to shelter him In the storm. How
would the k.lling of his wife bring him
back to her? Didn't the jury think she
would have suggested divorce before
murder? She did not suggest that he dis
card the wife of his bosom. All the acts
Of friendship she did for him were held
against her as acts of criminality by the
prosecution. The motive was a mystery
and the solution of it was held by Dun
ning, he declared. Dunning should have
been forced to tell and must have sealed
his lips to protect the Identity of some one
who might have had a deadly affection
for him.
"He swore Mrs. Botkin's good name
away," continued McGowan, "and only
Suicide of a School Boy.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 29.â Horace B.
Todd, 18 years of age, a pupil at the High
School here, committed suicide about 1
o'clock to-day by shooting himself in the
head with a revolver. No cause 1b known
for th._> act. The boy"s father. Dr. B.
Todd, is a dentist in Aspen, Colo., and hla
mother and sister are traveling in Eu
rope. He was living here with a younger
brother In the family residence. The
brother can offer no reason for the deed.
from his lips comes the testimony of im
proper relations existing between them.
He comes with malice in his heart and
strikes her down."
He poked some quiet fun at Dr. Bishop
of Dover, Del., saying the only patients
in the Pennington household who died
were those upon whom he attended. The
children who did not take any of his po
tions recovered. He gave the two women
whisky and digitalis, both irritants, but
never used the stomach pump or gave
any antidote for arsenical poisoning. This
closed the morning' session, and the after
noon saw all this gone over again and
again, until every grain had been
thrashed out.
The speaker took up the question of
motive first, and soon dismissed it, going
on to a discussion of arsenic. He said
that while the box of sweets was in the
possession of Detective McVey of Dela
ware the arsenic in it changed in some
unaccountable manner from lump to pow
der, to fit the theory of the prosecution.
This inconsistency he left for the jury to
explain away.
He attacked the testimony of the candy
girls and their methods of identifying
Mrs. Botkln as the woman to whom they
sold the candy on thaft Sunday afternoon
in July. He could not understand why
a woman of Mrs. Botkin's intelligence
would say she wanted some candy left
out so that she could put in a handker
chief, when it would fit there without any
being removed, and her request would
surely be a hint that she was the woman
who was wanted for a crime if it had
heen committed. He claimed that the
defense had impeached Kitty Dettner
and the prosecution did not try to
strengthen her standing by calling rep
utable witnesses who knew her.
The lobby gave vent to its amusement
when he referred to the cook of the
Hotel Victoria as the "goggle-eyed pot
walloper," and Judge Cook thereupon or
dered that those who could not find seats
be removed. He maintains dignity and
decorum at any cost. By this time Mr.
McGowan had again reached the candy
box on his rounds, and attacked it with
his old vigor. Later on he ridiculed the
detectives who had examined Mrs. Bot
kln's room and found no evidence. Later
Rosella found the bit of pasteboard. "A
detective who could not find that seal,"
he said, "could not catch an afternoon
train if he had a schedule in his hand."
Discussing Mrs. Harris, the saleswoman
of the City of Paris, he quoted. "O. what
a tangled web we weave when first we
practice to deceive."
When he finally came to the matter of
expert testimony. Attorney Hosmer ob
jected to his reading from a law book to
the jury. Judge Cook told him the jury
must take its law from the Judge and
not from the attorney. He quoted from
the testimony where Ames said "the note
in the candy box was most clearly dis
guised; it is drawn, not written, and the
letters are distorted." Expert Elsen
schimmel had said: "There are no dis
guises in it whatever. It represents the
natural handwriting of defendant, the
only change being in the slant of the
letters." He asked the jury not to take a
human life on a matter of handwriting;
it was too frivolous a pretext.
In closing, he asked the jury not to
cast a stain on the fair name of the ac
cused woman's family (Brown). He
warned them of the terrible penalty of
their taking an innocent life and to spare
the fair name of the State from an unjust
verdict; to decide In the light of the evi
dence as sanctioned by the law, which
was founded on justice.
Mr. Hosmer will make the closing argu
ment for the prosecution to-day.
CHURCH THE VAGRANT
NOT MURDERER DUNHAM
So the Columbus Prisoner Escapes
With a Sentence of Five Days'
Imprisonment.
COLUMBUS, Ohio. Dec. 29.â The police
reached the definite conclusion- to-day
that Church Is not Dunham. The pris
oner was sentenced to five days for va
grancy, the motive for the detention be
ing a telegram from Milwaukee asking
that Church be held until officers from
that city can get here. Church is wanted
at Milwaukee to answer to several
charges of swindling 1 in connection with
a closing out sale. He interested a Mil
waukee citizen to such an extent that the
latter mortgaged his property for $200.
Church took this money and later ap
peared at Waukesha, where he swindled
another man.

The Nation's Policy Should Be Such

NEW HAVEN, Conn., Dec. 29.â At the
morning session of the American Eco
nomic Convention, now being held In this
city, the report on banking and currency
was presented. Following is an extract:
"Under existing conditions the only wise
and consistent policy for the United
States is the frank recognition of the fact
that the actual monetary standard Is now,
and for some time to come will be, gold,
and the adoption of legislation which
shall insure the entire stability of that
standard, until such time as the nation
may have decided to establish some
other."

Hitchcock as Ambassador to Russia.
GAGE NOW RESORTS
TO PETTY EVASIONS
He Is Here Asfed a Plain, Straightforward
Question and an Answer Is
Desired.
Proofs Are Offered to Establish the Fact That He Seeks
to Retain Gnnst in Office at the Re
quest of Colonel Dan
Barns.
GOVERNOR-ELECT GAGE does not
take kindly to criticism. He is
shocked and grieved because The
Call has related in detail the man
ner In which he proposes to carry out his
promise to Dan Burns to keep Burns'
gambling partner, Moses Gunst, in Oifrct;
as a member of the Board of Police Com
missioners in this city.
Being loth to remain in a bad light be
fore the people of the State to whom he
made such glowing promises during the
recent campaign, Mr. Gage has had him
self interviewed by the Examiner, Col'jrel
Burns' organ, the interview being evi
dently intended to soften the fall which
the Governor-elect seems to think he is
about to experience in the minds of
those who voted for him and who sup
ported him during the campaign. Among
other things Mr. Gage says that the ques
tion of the reappointment of Gunst had
nothing to do with the fixing of the date
of his inauguration for January 4. To
prove this he quotes at length from nu
merous legal decisions in this and other
States relative to the status of Mr.
Gunsfs incumbency, thus proving beyond
a doubt that he had never given a thought
to the question until the moment he was
approached by the interviewer.
A careful reading of the Interview dis
closes the fact that Mr. Gage did not deny
that he had promised Colonel Burns
to keep Gunst in office; that he did not
deny that he had told Governor Budd
that he (Gage) had fixed January 4 as the
date of his inauguration because he had
been requested to do so by the executive
Aimmlttee of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee; and that he did not deny
that he sent Governor Budd the following
message some days ago:
"Do yon intend to appoint a Â«nc-
MMtof to Police ComiaUtiloner
GniiMt f
"Colonel Burn* haa been very
kind to me, and I feel ; that I am un
der obligation* to him. He wants
Gaunt to continue in office,' and now
that I am in a position to handle
this matter for him I feel that I
Â,,h i to do It. I am in no hurry to
be inaugurated, and -would prefer
to let matter* take their usual
course, but if it becomes necessary
I can be inaugurated in time to
handle this appointment. Unless I
get the proper assurances I feel that
I ought to take such a course a*
will prevent any mistakes."
Governor-elect Gage did not see fit to
deny that he sent to Governor Budd such
a message as the above, though he is
quoted as saying that the question of Mr.
Gunsfs reappointment had nothing to do
with the fixing of the date of the inaugu
ration.
Mr. Gage in now given an oppor
tunity to deny that lie went sm-h a
MM-NNiiK*' to Governor Iludd through
the Governor's private necretary. If
he hai a nnfflclelit dUreÃard for the
trath an to deny that he sent such a
niemmge The Cull will produce the
proofs of his nntruthfuliie**.
The issue is plain and no honest man
will seek to avoid it or pretend to mis
understand it. Either such a message
was sent or it was not. The Call says
that it was and stands ready to prove it
if Mr. Gage sees fit to deny it. if the
message was sent, then Mr. Gage, by his
own words, has undertaken because of
his friendship for Colonel Burns to con
tinue Mr. Gunst In office. It is also true
that upon the certainty of being able to
keep his promise to Colonel Burns de
! pended the fixing of the date for his in
auguration. He says: "I am in no hurry
to be inaugurated, but if it becomes ne
cessary 1 can be inaugurated in time to
handle this appointment. L'nless I get
the proper assurances I feel that I ought
to take such a course as will prevent any
mistakes)."
The "proper assurances" were not
forthcoming, for Governor Budd refused
to promise that he would not appoint Mr.
Gunst's successor. Thereupon Mr. Gage
fixed the date of hia appointment for
January 4, "in time to handle this ap
pointment," and so prevented the liabil
ity of there being "any mistakes," be
cause Mr. Gunst's term of office expires,
if it expires at all, on January 5.
It is all a very simple matter. Mr.
Gunst and Colonel Burns are personal
friends and gambling partners. Colonel
Burns and Mr. Gage are personal friends
and political associates. Mr. Gunst wishes
to retain the office of member of the
Board of Police Commissioners. Colonel
Burns has promised to aid him to that
end. Colonel Burns has asked Mr. Gage
to retain Mr. Gunst in office and Mr. Gage
had promised to do so. After communi
cating with Governor Budd he ascertained
that he would be unable to keep his prom
ise to Colonel Burns unless he fixed the
date of his Inauguration for January 4.
This date was fixed upon accordingly and
for the reasons mentioned.
The Call knows little and cares less con
cerning the legal status of Mr. Gunst's
incumbency. If there is a difference of
opinion between gentlemen learned in the
law regarding the expiration of Mr.
Gunst's term 'of office the question can be
easily and finally determined by resort
to the courts. It is \ery evident that .Mr.
Gage has studied the matter carefully, be
cause 01 his ability to refer in detail to
numerous judicial decisions bearing on
the point at issue. It is equally apparent
that he believes that Mr. Gunst's term
of office will expire on January 5, from
the purport of his message to Governor
Budd and his subi^iuent action in fixing
the date of his own Inauguration for Jan
uary 4, thus giving himself the privilege
of allowing Mr. Gunst to remain In office.
During the campaign that resulted in
Mr. Gage's election The Call did what
was In its power to promote his candi
dacy, believing that the assurances of
his honest Intentions to serve the best In
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
terests of the people â such assurances be
ing made both privately and publiclyâ
were made in good faith and would be
carried out. "Whatever course this paper
or its proprietor has taken with reference
to the matter that forms the subject of
this and previous articles has been dona
for the sole purpose of preventing Mr.
Gage from violating his ante-election
pledges and making. the mistake that put
a smirch upon the closing days of Gov
ernor Markham's administration.
The people of San Francisco gave Gov
ernor Budd a majority of about 12,000
votes. They gave Mr. Gage a majority of
about 4000. Under his proposed leadership
the city changed from a Democratic com
munity to a Republican community. This
fact alone should entitle its people to
very thoughtful and careful consideration
ut his hands;-
When Governor Markham appointed
Moses Gunst Police Commissioner mass
meetings composed of the best and most
highly respected business men. capitalists
and wage earners of this city were held to
protest against the insult that had been
put upon the people of San Francisco.
Unfortunately the law was so construed
as to render these protests futile. Now
there is a possibility that circumstances
will permit of the retirement of Mr.
Gunst to the society of the associates
from which he was elevated at the re-
quest of Dan Burns Governor-elect Gage
steps forward, again at the request of
Dan Burns, and proposes to prevent the
retirement.
Is this the way Mr. Gage proposes to
keep his ante-election promises? Is this
the manner in which Mr. Gage intends to;
reply to the people of . San Francisco for
supporting him . so ' handsomely at the
polls on election day?
â¢ During the campaign and since Mr.
Gage asserted r that' he woul d not be
dominated by any person, newspaper or
corporation. Now that he Ib put to the
test is he going to permit himself to be
dominated by the person or persons who
wish to retain Mr. Gunst in office? : A : ;~. : i
The Call does not ask of Mr. Gage that
it be allowed to dictate who shall or shall
not be appointed Police Commissioner for
San Francisco. It does propose, however,
that the people of this city shall be made
aware of the manner in which their inter
ests are being considered by the chief
executive of the State, and it reserves for
itself the right to criticize his acts and
to adopt such measures as it deems neces
sary to reveal his motives and make them
plain, if it so be that there is good ground
for believing that such motives are not
for the best interests of the city.

JIM CORBETT SAYS
SHARKEY WILL WIN
But the Sailor Thinks That Kid Mc-
Coy Will Give Him the Battle
of His Life.
NEW YORK, Dec. 29.â Jim Corbett tips
Tom Sharkey as the winner over McCoy
in their tight January 10. When asked to
give his opinion, Corbett said: "Sharkey
will win, of course. He ought to put
McCoy to sleep before the twentieth
round is reached." Corbett said he would
be at the fight.
McCoy Is still a slight favorite in the
betting at 100 to f*o, and unless something
unforeseen happens he will remain at
these odds up to the time the men begin
their fight. McCJoy is visited every day
by sporting men from this city, and if
their statements of the Kid's condition
are true, It certainly looks as if he stands
a chance of defeating Sharkey. The
latter, however, is not a bit worried over
the glowing reports he hears of McCoy's
condition, and says he feels as confident
of getting the decision as McCoy does.
Sharkey. in speaking about his chance of
winning from McCoy, said: "I feel pretty
sure that I will beat McCoy, but I don't
expect to do it before going through the
hardest fight I have experienced. McCoy
I consider a great fighter, and as I re
gard him as being a better fighter than
Corbett I am sure he will make me fight
the battle of my life before I finally beat
him."

WASHINGTON, Dec. 29.â At to-day's
session of the joint committee appointed

Ernst of the Boston Postoffice was on thÂ»

Mr. Loud, with aspertty.
"The Representative from California
seems to have constituted himself an at

This led to further controversy of such
a character that it was deemed proper to
close the doors, and. In other words an
executive session was moved and carried

OF REDWOOD
An Affidavit Tells the
Story.
SAYS COIN WAS DEMANDED
SOME SENSATIONAL REVELA
TIONS ARE PROMISED.
The Official Under Fire Denies His
Guiltâ Declares Politics Is at
the Bottom of the
Affair.
Special Wswitch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, Dec. 29.â The om
inous cloud of political discord that
has been hanging over the heads of the
chief officials of San Mateo County
has broken at last, and the first thun
derbolt has struck where it was least
expected. Now there is consternation
among the officials, and each in turn
is wondering what is to drop next.
W. L. Davis, the proprietor of the
Redwood City Democrat, deals the first
bolt In the shape of a sworn affidavit,
published in his paper, accusing P. H.
McEvoy, chairman of the Board of
Supervisors of San Mateo County, of
attempting to cxtnrt a bribe from him
for giving support tv the Democrat for
official printing.
Mr. Davis, when interviewed by a
Call representative, said:
"I have had no personal quarrel with
P. H. McEvoy, and must say that I
â¢was rather dazed at his bold and un
varnished attempt at extortion and
bribery. My acquaintance with him
has only been casual, and even that
for only six months.
"During the late political campaign
he came to me and asked that the Dem
ocrat take up his light for the nomina
tion for Sheriff. This I declined to do
at the time, as the nominations had not
been made, but assured Supervisor Mc-
Evoy that should he secure his uarty's
indorsement, the Democrat would sup
port him freely.
"1 am not dealing in human souls nor
trafficking in the honor and manhood of
my felluw citzens. I refuse to accept
the goods that Supervisor McEvoy
agrees to deliver on the abominable
terms he dictates, even though h'<* of
fer carries with it his small appraise
ment of his fellow members of the
board. Ido not believe his fellow mem
bera are guilty of such a damnable de
mand. I believe that Chairman Mc-
Evoy would rake in every dollar of the
boodle for himself.
"There is another feature of this bold
scheme of corruption that should not
be overlooked. Supervisor McKvoy, as
chairman of the board, personally
scans and approves all claims against
the county. He knows that all bills
for printing presented by this paper
are made in accordance with the low
rate fixed by the board, and that such
bills do Dot ..verage $100 a month.
Then his proposition is virtually this:
In order to meet his demand for cash.
I would be obliged to raisv. my bills at
least $100 monthly and rob the county
to that amount, and it is presumed
that Chairman McEvoy would wink at
the thefts. "
Mr. Davis was then asked if he had
an" other evidence cor. erning his ac
cusation against Mr. McEvoy. He re
plied that he would say nothing more,
save that he craved a suit by Mr. Me-
Evoy, also an investigation by the
Grand Jury which is now in session.
"The Grand Jury," he said, "is now
Jn session, and it is their provinre as
well as duty, to thoroughly look into
the facts, and if found true, as I sol
emnly declare they are, and there is
other corroborative evidence to be had.
to indict and remove P. H. McEvoy
from the high and honorable office he
has disgraced by his attempt at intimi
dation, extortion and bribery."
ACCUSED HAS ARRANGED
TO BRING SUIT
MENLO PARK, Dec. 29.â P. H. Mc-
Evoy, when seen at his home this
evening in reference to the charges
made against him by Editor Davis of
Redwood City, made a denial of the
whole affair. He admitted gome to
Davis' office and having an interview
â¢with him, but stoutly denies that he
asked the editor for $100 a month for
the official printing. 2jo conversation
pertaining to money matters passed
between them. McEvoy says he will
fight to the bitter end. He has re
tained Attorney Delmas of San Fran
cisco to begin a libel suit against
Davis.

DAVIS' SENSATIONAL AFFIDAVIT
CHARGING ATTEMPTED BRIBERY
REDWOOD CITY, Dec. 29.â Editor Davis* sensational affidavit,
charging P. H. McEvoy, chairman of the San Mateo County Board of
Supervisors, with attempting to obtain a bribe, is as follows:
W. L. Davis, being first duly sworn, deposes and says: That he
is the publisher and proprietor of the Redwood City Democrat, a
weekly newspaper printed and published in Redwood City, County
of San Mateo, State of California; th&t on the morning of the 19th
day of December, 1898, at or about 9 o'clock, P. H. McEvoy. chair
man of the Board of Supervisors, of said county, entered my office
and while I was conversing with my associate, J. V. Swift, called
me into the back room, he leading the way, as he wished to speak
to me privately; that as near as can be stated in the absence of a
literal shorthand report, the following is the conversation that took
place between Mr. McEvoy and myself: Mr. McEvoy said: "Mr.
Crow and you have treated me badly; now, Mr. Davis, if you want
the county printing you must give me $100 a month; I have had
chances to make money out of my office, but have not done so: I
intend to make my office pay me something during the balance of
my term. I will give you till Saturday to give me your final an
swer."
Replying to McEvoy I said: "I have not treated you badly. Tour
quarrel with Mr. Crow and others of the party was none of mine:
I was almost a stranger in the politics of this county; I refused to
take part in the personal quarrels inside the party before the nom
inations were made; I have endeavored to conduct a clean paper,
and for this you propose to punish me; I cannot accept yow offer;
the board's patronage does not amount to $100 a month to me. and I
cannot be a party to any such transaction."
Mr. McEvoy said, with great agitation, "You have till Saturday to
give me your answer; you must tell no one about this matter." I
replied: "I shall certainly tell my partner, Mr. Swift, right away."
This ended the interview, and as soon as Mr. McEvoy left the
office I called Mr. Swift, who overheard part of the conversation,
and told him what was said.
I will further say that I have never solicited any patronage of any
kind from Supervisor McEvoy. "W. L. DAVIS.

charges, Supervisor McEvoy said: "It
is a scurrilous attack and Is made of
whole cloth. That man must be insane
to make b-ch a charge as that. He has
no ground whatever for his attack. I
went into hia office about a week aero
and told him that I had not been treat
ed right by the Democrat, and, there
fore, would withdraw my support and
would give It to the Times-Gazette.
We a few other words, and then
I walked out.
"This may be a political move, but to
day I am not ready to say so for cer
tain. If it Is, there will be some fun.
I know that several of the head offi
cials have no use for me for the rea
s that they cannot use me as they
want. For that rea. on I was thrown
down at the Democratic convention
prior to the election. But you can say
that I do not fear them.
"I will commence suit against Mr.
Davis to-morrow, and - this is a politi
cal move, It will come out, and then
there will be some startling revela
tions."
The leading merchants of Redwood
City and of Menlo Park, the home of
P. H. McEvoy, say that they do not
believe the charge. Some even ko bo
far as to say that this will be the be
ginning of revelations that have been
withheld for some time.

STOCKTON. Dec. 29.â For some time
the Board of Supervisors of San Joaquin

of over 510,000. The specifications were
such, it is alleged, that only the Peck-

MYSTERY AS TO THE
LATE MARY MOEDINGER
John Dempsey, Who Claims to Be the
Husband, Said to Be an Impos
tor and a Fraud.
WOODLAND, Dec. 29.-Fred Moedinger,
brother of Mary Moedinger, who died in
San Bernardino December 5, left for that
place this morning to make an investiga
tion concerning the disposition of some
personal property she was known to pos
sess at the time of her death. Judge
Gaddis on Wednesday appointed young
Moedinger a special administrator for
that purpose. This property consisted of
stock in the Woodland Building and Loan
Association, valued at $500, a note for $400
given by M. R. York and jewelry and
other personal effects of the value of $100
The body of the young woman was bur
ied in Woodland Cemetery under a per
mit issued in the name of Mary Moedin
ger and in a lot purchased by F P
Moedinger. Nobody was in charge of' the
body when it arrived in this city on De
cember 10, but on the box was a card
bearing the name of Mrs. Mary A Demp
sey. v
The family of the deceased communi
cated these facts to the Sheriff's office
and sought assistance in that quarter A
letter was written to the Sheriff of San
Bernardino acquainting him with all the
facts so far as they were known here and
requesting him to make an investigation
In reply a letter was received in which it
was stated that a man named John
Dempsey was in possession of the per
sonal effects of the young woman, claim
ing that she was hia wife.
Two letters were written to Dempsey
but there was no response to either Tele'
grams were next sent to the County
Clerk, and it was ascertained that no
license to marry had ever been issued to
John Dempsey and Mary Moedinger
There are many suspicious circumstances
that tend to confirm the theory that John
Dempsey is an Impostor and that he was
not the husband of the deceased

THREE MEN
CAST UPON A
HAUNTED ISLE
Found Famished by
Indians.
WERE CARRIED OUT TO SEA
LITTLE SCHOONER OHIO BROKE
HER MOORINGS.
After Two Desperate Battles With
Gales the Men Aboard the Ves
sel Sought Refuge on an
Island.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, Dec 29.â George
Rudge, a well-known prospector whose
residence when at home la at Victoria,
reached Nanaimo this morning, bring
ing a thrilling narrative from Port
Simpson.
About two weeks ago the eight-ton
schooner Ohio was lying in the harbor
of Port Simpson and all was being got
ready for a trip farther north. On
board were Dr. Phillips, a dentist from
.New York; Robert Blick and Bill
Bridges. Without warning a gale
sprung up and the little craft broke
from her moorings and was carred out
to sea.
The skipper decided to run before the
wind and set the sail. Like a cork the
Ohio was tossed and buffeted about un
til off Berny Island, when her sails
were carried away. Control was al
most lost of the vessel, but the three
men were fighting for their lives and
after several hours succeeded in rig
ging a jury sail. Then the schooner
was headed for Tongas, Alaska, but an>
other gale was encountered in which
the jury rig was carried away. Again
the three men had to fight the fury of
the elements and again they were suc
cessful, for another rig was got to
gether and the schooner was put on her
course.
But disaster followed in her wake and
without warning the vessel grounded on
the reef of a small island. The men
had not an instant to lose and jumped
overboard. Each managed to fight his
way through the surf and reach the
shore. Hardly had they done so when
a big wave dashed up the reef where
the schooner was wedged, lifted her
high on its crest and retreating took
the little vessel out to sea.
On an uninhabited island, far re
moved from civilization, the three men
were left. So suddenly had the calam
ity occurred that they had not found
time to save a thing, while the prospect
of a passing vessel picking them up was
the remotest. Their only hope lay in
tho Indians of the district, but as the
Island is said to be haunted by abo
rigines, it was soon realised that it
would be a difficult matter to get them
to approach, even should they come
near when the gale abated. They man
aged to make a fire, Dr. Phillips hav~
ing had a tin box of matches in one of
his pockets. He dried his clothes and
then set out to find if any one was liv~
Ing on the island. Not a soul was to
be found, and nothing remained for
them to do but resort to mussels as a
means of appeasing their appetites.
For seven days and nights they wear
ily walked the beach, never relaxing
their lookout for passing vessels. A big
fire was kept up and when the wind
shifted it had to be removed to a mor*
protected spot, as their matches had
been used up. On the seventh day,
when the Btrength of the three men
was ebbing, two Indians hove In il?ht.
The men rushed frantically up tTid
down the beach in an effort to attract
the attention of the Indians. At l^st
they succeeded and the boat reached
shore. The older Indian would not
leave the boat and set foot upon thfe
haunted island, but tho younger man,
who has been born in Alaska and was
not superstitious, landed and promised
to take the men to Port Simpson. On
the trip down they became delirious
and the two Indians had a hard time to
keep the three castaways In the boat.

JOHANNESBURG SEETHES
WITH DISCONTENT
Boers Are Now Discussing the Pros
pect of a Conflict With Great
Britain.
LONDON, Dec. 23.â A disquieting situa
tion Is developing at Johannesburg. Ac- j
cording to the latest advices the place is
seething with discontent, as it was on the j
eve of the Jameson raid. In consequence
of recent and proposed Government meas- j
ures which the Ultlanders regard as being
a fresh series of Impositions. In addition
racial animosities are intensifying at the
vexatious treatment of the "British In
dians" and "Cape Boys," which Is caus
ing much bitterness.
The newspapers publish venomous arti- ]
cles on the subject. The Boer organ, the j
Rand Post, yesterday discussed the pros- |
pect of war with Great Britain ana ad- I
vised that on the first British act of war i
the women and children at Johannesburg
be given twenty-four hours to leave: that :
the whole place be then razed, and that
"the perpetrators of those turbulent pro
ceedings, if caught, be thrown into the
deep shafts of their mines, with the debris ]
of their machinery for costly shrouds."
The paper added that "the whole Johan- ;
nesburg will exult if the Africander Ward
Is converted into a gigantic rubbish heap j
as a mighty tombstone for the authors of !
the monstrous deed."
The Pretoria Volksteln suggests that
January 2 be observed as Jameson day j
and that Dr. Jameson be burned in effigy.

CALCUTTA, Dec. 29.â Advices received
here from British East Africa say that
on October 10 a force of rebels attacked a
detachment of thirty men belonging to the
Twenty-seventh Baluchis, commanded by
Lieutenant Hanninton, which was
marching to Masindi. A native officer and j
twelve men were killed and nine wound- '
cd. including Lieutenant Hanninton. who
was shot through the right arm and had
his left hand shattered by a bullet. The '
rear guard repulsed the advance, and the
wounded were conveyed fourteen miles to
Kisallzl, tn the western shore of Lake ;
Kioga, which place was held by a com- i
pany of Ealuchis.
Later the rebels attacked Kisallzl and
lost twenty-five men. The casualties on
the British side were two men wounded
Troops were dispatched to pursue the reb

WHITE OPPOSED
TO EXPANSION
Predicts That It Will
Bring Disaster.
BARBARIC LANDS NOT NEEDED
THINKS IT FOOLISH TO ABAN
DON OUR OLD POLICY.
As to His Successor, the Senator
Thinks He Should Be Pledged
to Watch Work at San
Pedro Harbor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 29.â Senator
White left for Washington to-day. The
Senator does not anticipate any cur
rency legislation, nor does he think
much will be done outside of the or-
dinary appropriation bill routine.
Should the President determine to Dress
the Spanish treaty, White says it will
give rise to protracted debate unless
the Senate changes the rules regarding
a secret session to consider the meas
ure.
"What do you think will be the out
come of the present Senatorial cam
paign? Do you anticipate your suc
cessor will be from the south?"
"Well, on that point I have nothing
to say. The Republican party is in
possession of the Legislature. I do not
know that it is any part of a Demo
crat's duty to attempt to interfere in
the situation. Our advice during the
last campaign was not heeded, sugges
tions now would amount to nothing
less than intrusion.
"I will, however, say that it is the
duty of every one to demand that the
candidates shall declare themselves
upon the San Pedro harbor proposi
tion. I have sounded the various as
pirants, and have not found one who
will refuse to state his position in ac
cordance with our wishes, but this
ought to be definite and positive and
ought not to rest in memory or verbal
statements."
Regarding his position on the Philip
pine question and the Spanish treaty,
he said: "As far as the Spanish treaty
is concerned, I do not know that the
issue will partake of a partisan char
acter. I am utterly opposed to the ac
quisition of distant and barbaric lands.
The United States are assuming a lead
ing position among nations of the
earth, not only as to military prowess,
but commercially, now that we are on
the high road to control, it appears to
me foolish to embark on the line of
policy which we have heretofore
avoided.
"It is my earnest conviction that the
carrying out of the rxpansion pro
gramme will ultimately prove disas
trous to the Republican party. This
result may be postponed for years, but
that it will be reached if we abandon
our precedents and stay away from the
teachings of the great men who largely
contributed to our national life I do
not doubt.
"Holding 1 these views, I cannot do
otherwise than continue to maintain
the position which I have heretofore
explicitly assumed. I do not do this
in the spirit of opposition to any one
or to any class or section, but because
I am convinced of the rectitude of that
course. I might also add that I shall
vote in compliance with my own
judgment on questions of a basic char
acter."
The Senator said that owing to the
war Congress did not pass any river
and harbor appropriation at the last
session, and although it is unusual to
enact bills of this character at a short
session, there is some talk of chanerine:
the custom, in order to prevent the de
terioration of much of the work com
menced in aid of navigation at various
points throughout the United States.

SLAIN BY NATIVES
IN NEW HEBRIDES
Massacre of Fourteen frer)cY)men
of t\)e Warship Eure Sent to
Stop a Cannibal Feast
VICTORIA, B. C, Dec. 29.â Shortly before the steamer "Warrl
moo, which arrived this evening from Australia and the South Seas,
left Suva, an interisland steamer arrived from Nukualofa, the capital
of Tonga, bringing news of the massacre of a landing party of marines
and bluejackets from the French warship Eure, which patrols the
New Hebrides group for the French. The Eure reached Nukualofa
on December 7, and there reported the disastrous affair.
A correspondent writing to Suva tells the story of the affair in
which the soldiers of the tri-color were killed as follows: The French
warship Eure reports that while she was cruising through the New
Hebrides Islands she lost a lieutenant and thirteen men, besides
having a number wounded in a fight with the blacks of one of the
smaller islands of the group. Early in November last a report was
given to the Eure's officers by a trader of a cannibalistic feast ar
ranged to take place in a New Hebrides village. The Eure at once
proceeded thither to stop the barbaric seance. Lieutenant Fautaux
and a squad of marines and bluejackets were put ashore and under
the guidance of a native interpreter attached to the ship they made
their way through the tropical foliage to where the feast was to take
place, thinking to surprise the natives. The surprise was, however,
all with the French, for as they were making their way through
the forests they were suddenly attacked on the flanks by a heavy
ambuscade of blacks. The attack came without the slightest warn
ing, their first knowledge that they were attacked being when the
rifles cracked and the lieutenant commanding the squad and four men
went down. The four marines were killed.
Lieutenant Fautaux was alive, although it was noticeable that
he was severely wounded. As he lay in the jungle grass he drew his
revolver, and presumably thinking that the guide had betrayed the
party, shot him dead. His men were unable to reach him and he was
captured and killed by the blacks. A running fight then occurred,
the French hurriedly retreating to their boats. But five men, and
they were all more or less wounded, reached the boats and made way
to their vessel.
The others, one by one, were dropped by the blacks and if not
instantly killed were soon dispatched as they lay wounded. The
blacks, after following the flying Frenchmen as far as they dared,
retreated to their fortresses in the woods, defying pursuit.
According to the officers of the Eure, the correspondent continued,
an avenging expedition will probably be landed and the village of
blacks destroyed to avenge the massacred sailors.

the canned beef. General Miles stated
at the time that he had started an in

line. A synopsis of the report as fur
nished follows:
Commanding officer, Fourth Infantry,
Major Bakerâ The beef seemed to be of
inferior quality and was anything but
palatable. Quite a number of men could
not eat it.
Commanding officer. Sixth Infantry,
Lieutenant Colonel Minorâ The meat
was utterly unfit as an article or diet
for either sick or well. It had no nu
triment in it and turned the stomachs
of the men who tried to eat it.
Commanding officer, Ninth Infantry,
Colonel Powell â The meat produced dis
ordered stomachs, is not nutritious,
soon became putrid and in many of the
cans was found in course of putrifica
tion when opened.
Commanding officer, Twelfth Infan
try. Major Humphreys â The meat pre
sented such a repulsive appearance that
men turned from it in disgust. 'Nasty'
is the only term that will fitly describe
its appearance. Its use produced di
arrhea and dysentery.
Commanding officer. Thirteenth In
fantry. Colonel A. T. Smithâ Many
complaints were made concerning the
meat. It was four.d very unpalatable,
and is unfit for issue to troops.
Commanding officer. Seventeenth In
fantry, Major O'Brien â The nutritious
qualities having been cooked out of the
meat, it was neither nourishing nor pal
atable. It was unfit for use. It should
no longer be issued.
Commanding officer. Twenty-second
Infantry, Major Van Horne â The meat
issued was nothing more than refuse
after various kinds of soups had been
extracted from it. Further issues of it
should not be made.
Commanding officer. Third Cavalry,
Major Jackson â The meat for canning
was too fat, and as an article of diet
soon became nauseating to a large ma
jority of men. If made of good beef
and properly seasoned it might be sat

THAT SPAIN
PLAYED FALSE
Evacuation of Iloilo Made Un
der Very Peculiar Circum
stances.
Believed to Have Been Inspired ]ju
a Design to Embarrass the
United States.
Call Office, Riggs Hous*Â»,
Washington, Dec. 29.
Suspicion is entertained here that
the surrender of Iloilo by the Spanish
general to the insurgents just before
the arrival of Colonel Potter with
American forces may have been de
signed for the purpose of embarrassing
this Government.
The Spanish general was aware that
the Americans were to be there, anil it
Is regarded as a somewhat remarkable j
coincidence that on the very day of the j
Bailing of the American expedition (
General Rios should evacuate Iloilo
and cable to the Madrid Government
that he had surrendered.
The Spanish had been able to main
tain themselves in their position there
f"r a long time, and it might have been
possible for them to hold out a few
hours longer with the knowledge that
the American forces would relieve
them. The fact that the insurgents,
though the town was evacuated by the
Spanish on the 24th, did not take pos
session until the -6th, seems to indlcaite
that General Rios was not so closely
pressed as his precipitate evacuation
Would imply.
There is evidence of an unwarranted
suspicion of the United States by the
natives, and it looks as if certain ele
ments were being inspired to acts of
hostility. It is realized that if this sus
picion and hostility is developed to a
great extent the United States Govern
ment is likely to be placed in the atti
tude of having traded places with
Spain, in being compelled to establish
order by force. This is a thing to be
avoided, of course, and if fair treat
ment, good government and generosity
toward natives can acomplish it, tran
quillity -will be restored, but it is un
certain what secret agencies may be at
work making trouble.
Should the natives of the Philippines
assume an attitude of active hostility
under the inspiration of tbis secret in
fluence, a very difficult problem will be
presented. It would practically be im
possible at this time to cut off the sup
plies from any considerable band of
belligerent natives if any foreign gov
ernment had a motive in assisting
them.
MERRITT CRITICIZES
RIOS' SURRENDER
CHICAGO, Dec. 29.â Major General
Wesley Merritt, who is spending the
holidays in this city, was very much
surprised to hear of the surrender of
Hollo by Ceneral Kios to the insur
gents. General Morritt believes the sur
render may have been an Intentional \
move on the part of the Spaniards, de
signed to make it difficult for us to
maintain control of the Philippine
Islands.
"It is, of course, impossible," con
tinued General Merritt, "to predict
what bearing this move will have on
the ultimate disposition of the islands.
ml Rins had no right to surrender
to the insurgents, unless, indeed, his
command was on the verge of starva
tion or in some equally tight place.
Wh":i Manila fell, all the islands in
the archipelago went with it. and al
though the surrender, then made on
paper, niipht not have amounted to
muÂ«"h. and might have been terminated
should the Spanish have felt themselves
sufficiently strong, yet the signine of
the protocol gome six days later pre
vetrted Â»r.y further movements, either
on the part of the Americans to pain
further control of the islands, or on the
part <>f the Spanish to attempt to wrest
any of th>- surrendered territory from
their victors. Consequently Rios' only
move should have been to turn over
Hollo to th" (iiited States troops.
"The idea the Insurgents have is that
the more territory they can assert that
they hold the better their claim to the
right of independence when the time
romes f>>r them to treat with the United
States regardnig the mode of govern
ment."
EVERYTHING QUIET AND
ORDERLY AT ILOILO
MANILA, Dec. 29.â The expedition
under General Miller arrived at Iloilo
lay and found the Spaniards had
.evacuated the place on Saturday. The
steamer Churuca transferred the Span
ish forces to Mindanao.
In accordance with an agreement the
rebels entered the city and trenches on
Monday at noon. They immediately es
tablished a. municipal government.
(Juards were placed over foreign prop
erty. Everything is quiet and orderly.
There waa some looting during the
right, but five natives were phot, and
this had an exemplary effect. The only
forelgrn ship in the harbor was the
British cruiser Irene.

NEW YORK, Dec. 2?.â Colonel Kim

ders from thp War Department to se

to 2000 tons for use as a cable ship to

The ship will be kept on station as a

GENERAL LAWTON TO

WASHINGTON. Dec 29.â The War
Department has issued orders assign- |
nig Major General Lawton to service in !
the Philippines. This assignment is I
considered one of exceptional import- I
ance. General Lawton, who was one
of the conspicuous officers in the Cuban j
campaign about Santiago, will be sec
ond in command to General Otis, and in
the event of General Otis' appointment
as Governor of the Philippines, will as
sume military command of the forces
in the Philippines. His new duties will
require a combination of nerve and
tact
A COMMISSION MAY GO
TO THE PHILIPPINES
NEW YORK, Dec. 29.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: The wisdom of sendnie a
commission to the Philippines to study
conditions and report to Congress was
the subject of a long conference at the
White House to-day between the Presi
dent and a member of Congress who
is regarded the world over as a teacher
of diplomacy rather than as a scholar.
While the President has no desire to
coerce Congress by taking precipitate
action, he fully appreciates the grav
ity of the situation in the Philippines.
With wider information at his disposal
than is in the possession of many of
those who are disposed to antagonize
the ratification of the treaty or delay
it for an indefinte period, he desires to
maintain the firm policy which has
characterized the administration in
dealing with the Spanish problem since
the destruction of the Maine rendered
war inevitable.
FOUGHT TWENTY FAST
ROUNDS TO A DRAW
: Jimmy Barry and Caspar Leon Di
vide Honors Before the Tri-
City Athletic Club.
DAVENPORT, lowa. Dec. 29.â Jimmy
Barry, the bantam-weight champion, aÂ«d
his old-time rival, Casper Leon, fought a
fast twenty-round fight to a draw to
night before the Tri-Clty Athletic Club.
The small hall in which the tight was held
was filled to overflowing, large delega
tions from Chicago and adjoining cities
being In attendance. The fight was an
even one from start to finish. In the opin
ion of many of the spectators Leon out
pointed his man. but Barry's apparently
superior strength easily evened up mat
ters. There was very little betting on the
event, Leon's previous defeat? making
th*Â» sporting element shy of the invest
ment. Owing to long delays, caused by
awaiting the arrival of special trains, the
fight was not concluded until after 1
o'clock.
Though the fighting was very fast in
every round, neither contestant scored a
knockdown, j^eon came out of the mill
with a badly damaged eye, Barry inflict
j Ing the injury with a hard right smash
during the third round.
The decision of the referee, Malachi Ho
, gan, met with the approval of the specta
tors. Harry's seconds were Frank Bart
lev, Tommy White and Patsy Fitzgerald,
while Ijfnn was backed by Morris Rausch,
Kid Manning and Dan Leach.

Manners in the Field.
There is some occult influence which
frequently causes well-bred and well-in
tentioned people to forget their breeding
;.nd their manners directly they have a
gun in hand and find themselves on an
other person's land looking for game Vet
tlier^ is surely nothing inherent in a taste
fur Held sports which involves such dis
regard of others. On the contrary, as is
demonstrated by shining examples in
great multitude, there are sportsmen who
show themselves in the field as at home
and everywhere thoughtful of their fel
lowmen, and whose pleasant fellowship is
sought not only by the companion with
whom they go shooting, but by the resi
dents among whom they shoot, and -to
whose courtesy they are indebted fur
their opportunities of spurt. Every shoot
er who thus treats a land owner as he
would be treated in turn by him will have
no difficulty in linuing In this country to
day an abundance of good shooting Even
if he shall at first be warned oft and de
barred by trespass notices, he has to thank
for this, in all probability, the gunners
who have preceded him, and who have
made their invasion of the fields so intol
erable that they have put a brand and
stigma upon all of the craft. But even
the most hostile and bitter misanthrope
of a Northern or Western farmer or
Southern plantation owner will gradually
relent and make himself agreeable if the
sportsman who covets his game will but
persevere in the pursuit of it according
to the Golden Rule.â Forest and Stream.

TWO PETITIONS
FOR DISARMAMENT
Presented to President
by a Delegation.
REPRESENTS MANY CHURCHES
MILLIONS OF CHRISTIANS WHO
FAVOR LASTING PEACE.
Not Advocates of Peace at Any Price,
but Thoroughly Desirous of
Securing International
Arbitration.
Bi>eciaJ IMspatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 29.â A delega
tion presented to the President to-day
two petitions, one from the great ma
jority of the organized Protestant
Christian churches of the world and
the other from the Pan-Presbyterian
Alliance. The first petition was signed
by the representatives of the 145 na
tional and denominational churches,
existing on all the six continents, viz:
The Church of England, the Church of
Scotland, twenty-nine other churches
in Great Britain and Ireland, the gen
eral of the Salvation Army, two
churches in Belgium, two in Switzer-
land, six in Holland, twelve in Aus
tralia, eight in the United States and
sixty-four in other parts of the world.
All unite in their approval of the pe
tition. It asks for the reduction of the
heavy armaments maintained by Chris
tion nations, "ready upon provocation
to go to war and settle their disputes
by bloodshed," and also requests the
influence of the Government of the
United States in favor of international
arbitration as a substitute for war.
The second petition is from the Pan-
Presbyterian Alliance, which also
united in the first petition and with it
Includes eighty national and denomi
national churches throughout the
world. This second petition asked for
a "permanent and peaceful method for
the settlement of all controversies aris
ing between the people of the British
empire and the republic of the United
States."
The delegation stated that they were
not to be regarded as "the advocates
of a policy of peace at any price," or
with maintaining the opinion that all
war is sinful. They quoted the West
minster confession to the effect that
"Civil magistrates may rightfully
now, under the New Testament, wage
war upon just and necessary occa
sions."
The signers of these petitions repre
sent more than 80,000,000 of Chrtstians
in all parts of the world, 25,000,000 of
whom are Presbyterians.
The President responded cordially to
the delegation, sayine that he favored
arbitration between Great Britain and
America. He also said that he had re
s^nded promptly to the Czar's pro
posal for disarmament, but that under
present circumstances the armaments
of the United States could not now be
lessened, but would in any event be
less than would satisfy European na
tions.

LINE EXPECTED
Northern Californians
Have Strong Hopes.
LANDS ALREADY BOOMING
EXTENSION OF BURLINGTON OR
UNION PACIFIC PREDICTED.
But the Southern Pacific Is Also
Watching the Situation and
Will Endeavor to Shut
Out Competition.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, Dec. 28.â Strong hopes
are entertained in extreme Northeast
ern California that rumors of the com
ing: of an Eastern trunk line railroad
are soon to be realized. The rumors
are so persistent that people all along
the prospective route are becoming In
fected with the- speculative spirit
aroused by the advent of a great over
land road into new territory, and the
price of farm and stock lands has re
ceived an upward tilt in consequence.
Several years ago the Union Pacific
surveyed a line from Redding up Pit
River, through Modoc County, and on
to Boise City, Idaho, where conneeum
was made with the Oregon Short Line.
The survey was without result to the
country traversed, as the Union Pacific
never made any attempt at construc
tion work, though the engineers made
a most favorable report to headquarters
in Omaha. It is now reported that sur
veyors were again in the field, working
this way from Idaho, and were only
withdrawn late in the fall. It is ex
pected that early in the spring they will
again take the field and push forward
to the head of the Sacramento Valley.
What road these surveyors represent is
not known, but it is the general opin
ion here that the Union Pacific is be
hind'the survey.
Were it not for the fact that the "Q"
road has considerable realty holdings,
besides dock privileges, at Grays Har
bor, Washington, there would be rea
son to believe that the Chicago, Bur
lington and Quincy was headed this
way, making for San Francisco by the
most feasible pass through the Sierras
by following the course of Pit River,
passing down the Sacramento Valley
and entering Lake County and thence
to a Junction with the Donohue road at
Hopland or thereabout. Billings, Mon
tana, is the western terminus of iÂ»<e
Burlington track. The Union Pacific
would follow the same route as out
lined for the Burlington. One of the
most fertile stock regions on the coast
lies directly in the path of the survey.
Three spurs from the lines of the
Southern Pacific Company, lying In
waiting for indications of overland
competition from northeastward, ara
gradually being thrown forward in the
direction of Idaho, though on the sur
face these branches appear to be noth
ing but feeders to the main line from
the Sierra timber belts. One road
leaves the Shasta route at Anderson,
in this county, another at Castle Crag,
and the third at Upton, in Siskiyou
County. The latter, the McCloud River
Railroad, has been built with a solid,
substantial roadbed, inspected and ac>
cepted by the Southern Pacific engi
neers, and railroad people have Inti
mated time and again that that roaa
would be used to head off any Eastern
trunk line that might seek to enter the
State from the northeast. The Castle
Crag line will be pushed forward in thÂ«
spring to Modoc County, following thÂ»
timber belt to the Whitehorse forest?,
where a Michigan svndlcate has a bond
on 90,000 acres of sugar and yellow pine
lands. The people of Modoc believa
that it is this road which will event
ually be continued forward to South
eastern Oregon with the idea of shut
ting out the Union Pacific or any other
incoming road. If the development of the
Ociental trade, together with the easy
matter of financing a road with money
so abundant in banking and financial
centers of the country. Induces any of
the big companies in the Northwest to
strike toward California it will be over
the route along Pit River down to thÂ»
Sacramento Valley. It Is through a
roush country for pÂ«-"**v or one hun
dred miles, but cannot be compared
with the Shasta route in expense pet

TO AMEND MAIL
SUBSIDY ACT
Proposed Encourage
ment of Shipping.
UNITED SUPPORT EXPECTED
BOUNTY ON TONNAGES AS WELL
AS SPEED AND DISTANCE.
Legislation in the Past Caused to Be
Constructed Vessels That Were
of Great Service in
the War.
Special LHspatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Dec. 29.
There will be a strong effort made to
amend the mail subsidy act by provid
ing for a bounty on mail tonnage as
well as for speed and distance. This
measure seems likely to enlist the
united suport of the Republican party
in Congress, inasmuch as President
McKinley, in his last annual message
to Congress recommended legislation
calculated to assist the American mer
chant marine, especially between the
United States and the Hawaiian Isl
ands and the islands acquired from
Spain.
Senator Hanna's bill provides that
tonnage compensation shall be paid to
owners of vessels registered by an
American citizen, and which at the
time of entry are engaged in the for
eign trade of the United States, the
Secretary of the Treasury beingauthor
ized to contract for a period of twenty
years and pay one and one-half cents
per gross ton for each 100 nautical miles
for the first 1500 miles, outward or in
ward, and one cent for each 100 miles
over 1500 miles.
Representative Bingham of Pennsyl
vania, who is the author of the law
providing for a subsidy to American
ships carrying United States mails to
foreign ports, is much interested in the
subject.
"The bill for a subsidy for American
mail-carrying ships." said Bingham to
The Call correspondent to-day, "was
reported from the Committee on Post
offices and Post Roads in the Fifty
first Congres by myself. It was enact
ed into a law in lieu of the Farquhar
bounty bill, which Congress regarded as
too radical at that time. The law paid
a subsidy to United States vessels car
rying mails on a basis of mileage and
speed.
"The immediate outgrowth of that
law was the construction in an Ameri

RAID ON UNLICENSED DENTISTS
Dr. F. F. Lord Secures a Warrant for
the Arrest of *Tr." Strong.
There is a rattle of unhappiness among
the toothpullers and the fillers of hollow
cavities over the raid just started by Dr.
P. F. Lord against dentists who have
been practicing on the molars of the un
suspecting public without flrat procuring
a license for that purpose. Yesterday
afternoon Dr. Lord appeared before Police
Judge Low and swore to a warrant for
the arrest of "Dr." Thomas E. Strong,
whose toothpulllng establishment is lo
cated at 235 Kearny street. Strong was
arrested and admitted to bail in the sum
of $500 to appear for trial before the suc
cessor of Judge Low, as that jurist's term
expires at 12 o'clock to-morrow night.
Dr. Lord Is determined to bring the un
licensed dentists to the bar of justice with
a round turn. He says there are over
ninety of them in this city unlawfully
following the practice of regularly li
censed dentist.s. Before making the com
plaint Dr. Lord communicated with Dr.
Q. S. Backman. president of the State
Dentist Examining Board, and also Dr.
W. A. Moore, the secretary, who informed
him that Strong was an unlicensed man.
With this information in his possession,
he expects to have Strong sent to the
County Jail for six months. Other arrests
will follow as soon as the present one is
disposed of.
It is the intention of the regular uentists
in this city to weed out what they call the
toothpulling quacks.

MYSTERY STILL
SHROUDS THE
CORNISH CASE
Authorities Entirely at
Sea.
NO TRACE OF THE FOISONER
MRS. ADAMS' DEATH DUE TO
CYANIDE OF POTASSIUM.
Opinion of the Coroner's Physician,
Divorced Wife of the Intended
Victim Makes a
Statement.
NEW YORK. Dec. 29.â The Adaras-
Cornish poisoning case remains as great
a mystery as ever. When the detective
bureau, the District Attorney's office,
the Coroner's office and others seeking
to find a solution of the strange case
ended their labors for the day all said
nothing had been learned that might
assist in bringing the guilty persona to
justice.
The police are inclined to- believe that
the person who sent the poison to Cor
nish is a woman, although the evidence
is of the most flimsy character and is
largely based on opinions of more or
less responsible parties.
Mr. Cornish, who was also poisoned at
the time of Mrs. Adams' death, is now
completely out of danger, though con
fined to his bed at the Knickerbocker
Athletic Club.
Captain McClusky denied that he had
placed or contemplated placing Mr.
Cornish under surveillance. He sent
word to the Knickerbocker Athletic
Club, however, asking if Cornish was
able to come to headquarters.
Dr. Coffin, who is attending Mr.
Cornish, replied that his patient would
not be able to leave his bed for two
days. He said he is undoubtedly out
of danger, but he did not want him to
take any chances. Dr. Coffin gave an
interesting statement of how Cornish,
escaped death, while Mrs. Adams,
drinking from the same glass, was kill
ed by the deadly poison.
"Cornish mixed the poison," said Dr.
Coffin, "and 'gave it to Mrs. Adams.
She drank but a little, complaining that
it waa bitter. Cornish then took the
remainder and drained the glass to the
dregs. I think that the reason Cornish,
was not killed is that he drank the
dregs and Mrs. Adams took the poison
in solution. The quantity of powdered
matter acted as an emetic and cleared
his stomach."
When they found he was unable to
come to them Captain McClusky and
District Attorney Mclntyre, accom
panied by a stenographer, went to the
Knickerbocker Athletic Club and were
in conference with Cornish for more
than an hour.
Captain McClusky said little had been
learned that had not already been pub
lished. Cornish told him that the sil
ver holder had evidently been used and
while it was marked "sterling," it waa
plated. It was not a Tiffany article,
but came in a Tiffany box and had a
Tiffany card in the package.
Late this afternoon an autopsy -was
held. "When the anatomical process
was completed and the parts of the
body desired for analysis were sealed
in Jars, Coroner's Physician Weston is
sued a report in which he reiterated
his opinion expressed yesterday that
death was due to the use of cyanide of
potassium.
No date has yet been fixed for the
holding of the inquest.
BOSTON, Dec. 29.â Mrs. Ada Cornish,
the divorced wife of Harry Cornish, the
Knickerbocker Athletic Club manager,
stated to-day that her only knowledge
of Mr. Cornish of late has come to her
through the newspapers, or letters writ
ten to her by her daughter Edith.
Mrs. Cornish declares that she is not
acquainted with Mrs. Adams, described
as the aunt of Mr. Cornish, and the vic
tim of the Christmas package poison.
She says she never met Mrs. Rogers,
described as the daughter of Mrs.
Adams and separated from her hus
band. â  Mrs. Cornish added that little
Edith went to New York some time ago
and on her return told of having been
to the house of Mrs. Adams, but be
yond this Mrs. Cornish has no knowl
edge of the woman. Edith is now in
Hartford spending the holidays with
her grandmother.

COMES TO
THE RESCUE OF
MR, ROBERTS
President Snow Makes
a Statement.
POLYGAMY NOT PRACTICED
iIEAD OF THE MORMON CHURCH
SAYS LAW IS OBEYED.
The Question of Seating the Repre
sentative-Elect From Utah Is
Yet Causing a Great
Controversy.
Special Dlswtch to ThÂ« Call.
SALT LAKE. Dec. 29.â 1n connection
â with the election of B. H. Roberts to
Congress and certain charges circu
lated by the Presbyterian Board of
Missions, President Lorenzo Snow of
the Mormon church furnishes a signed
statement to an afternoon paper here
to-day, in which he says, in part:
1 declare most solemnly and emphatically
that the statements which are being pub
lished to the effect that the Mormon
church is encouraging and teaching
polygamy are utterly untrue. Ever since
the issuance of the manifesto on this
Bubject by President Wilford Woodruff,
my predecessor in office, polygamous or
plural marriages have entirely ceased in
Utah. Since my accession to the presi
dency of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-da} Saints 1 have repeatedly as
serted my Intention to stand by that
manifesto and my determination not to
permit any marriage to take place under
the sanction of the church which is con
trary to the law of the State, and I now
reaffirm that statement.
The implied understanding with the na
tion when Utah entered. the Union as a
State has been sacredly observed. There
is no intention or disposition on the part
of the church to violate or depart from it
in the future. The enabling act required
a provision In the constitution in the
State of Utah that polygamous or plural
marriages should be forever, prohibited.
Laws have been framed in support of this
constitutional enactment. Heavy penal
ties are provided for in case of their vio
lation.
The election of B. H. Roberts to the of
fice of Representative in Congress from
Utah was an entirely secular affair. Non-
Mormons participated in his nomination in
the regular convention of his party. Non-
Mormons also aided in his election. Many
Mormons not being of his party voted for
his opponent. He 'was elected as an
American citizen by American citizens,
and the question of religion did not enter
into the purely political contest. â¢ The
church has nothing to do with the action
of Congress in relation to his seat. If,
however, notice is to be taken of the wild
statements and artl-Mormon fulmlna
tions from the pulpit and the press to the
effect that Mr. Roberts has violated the
State constitution and the requirement of
the enabling act. it is proper for me to
state, as I do most positively, that thÂ«
charge, which incidentally affects the
church of which we both are members, Is
entirely without foundation- in fact. If
he should be unseated the result as to
polygamy would be no different.- .There
have been no polygamous marriages since
1890. There is no movement in the church
for the revival of such unions.- I am per
sonally opposed to any such change Mv
associates In the leadership of the church
unite with, me in this determination.' '
The excitement that has been caused
during the last few weeks Is without rea
son and it appears to me without excuse.
WILL ROBERTS GET
SEATED IN THE HOUSE?
NEW YORK, Dec. 29.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald sends
the following: Representative-elect
Roberts, tht-Mormon Congressman from
Utah, will probably be confronted upon
his arrival in Washington to take his
seat in the Fifty-sixth Congress by the
prope-sition of expulsion because of his
alleged polygamous practices. Some of
the ablest constitutional lawyers in the
House, who have studied this now cele
brated case, declare there is nothing in
the constitution of the United States to
prevent Mr. Roberts from taking his
seat, but they add that the House, by
."i two-thirds vote, may expel him on
the ground that he is living in violation
of the general laws which govern the
United States.
Nine of the objectors to Mr. Roberts
seem to have recognized the constitu
tional aspects of the case, but have
based their opposition to him solely
upon the fact that he is a Mormon,
and therefore, they declare, he should
not be admitted to- Congress.
Representative James Hamilton
Lewis of Washington is of the opinion
that Mr. Roberts cannot be denied his
seat In the House of Representatives
<>n the more ground that he is a polyga
niist, and has been living with three or
wives in Utah. Mr. Lewis is
firmly convinced that when Mr. Roberts
appears at the first session of the next
<".mgross he must be allowed to take
the oath as a member of the House.

CAPTAIN DREYFUS
MAY BE IN PARIS
Reported" to Have Been Taken From His Island Prison
and to Have Sailed From Cauenne on Board
a Convict Transport.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1808,
by James Gordon Bennett.
PARAMARIBO, via Hayti, Dec. 29.â 1t is reported here that Cap
tain Dr&yfus, who for the last three years has been kept in solitary
and close confinement on Devil's Island, one of the Saluti Islands, a
few miles east of here, has been removed from his island nrlson to
Cayenne and sailed from there for France on December 4 last on a
convict transport.
No details regarding the departure of the prisoner or as to his ulti
mate destination can be ascertained. It is believed that he will be
taken to Paris to await the orders of the Court of Cassation.
NEW YORK, Dec. 29. â If Dreyfus sailed from Cayenne for France
on December 4, he should by this time have, reached Paris. Convict
ships make slow progress, but the average voyage from French
Guiana to France rarely takes longer than three weeks.
If Dreyfus was taken to Paris at all, his journey would probably
be surrounded by the greatest secrecy, owing to the hostile attitude
of the anti-revisionists, who have openly threatened him with violence
if he returned to France. Some, however, believe Dreyfus has already
reached Paris.
The correspondent of the London Telegraph said recently: "Cur
ious rumors are current in Paris. There is a mysterious and unknown
prisoner at the fortress of Mont VaJerien and although the military
authorities are most reticent as to his Identity, belief grows strong
that this captive Is no other than the celebrated prisoner of Devil's
Island. However, no confirmation is to be obtained of the report,
which for the present must be treated as a mere guess."
ABSCONDING GEORGIA MERCHANT CAPTURED.
ATLANTA, Ga., Dec. 29.â The Constitution will say to-morrow: S. La
fayette Almand. a Georgia merchant, who is charged with absconding
with some $40,000 or $50,000, was arrested in Tulare, Cal., last Sunday
morning, and Monday night an officer started for California after the ab
sconder. Almand was a Georgia merchant with headquarters at Conyers, and
did a large business throughout the State. He had the confidence of the
business men of the State and almost unlimited credit. He appeared to be
flourishing when, about three or four weeks ago, he suddenly disapneared,
and when those who had trusted him examined his affairs, they claimed he
had carried with him several thousand dollars which he ought to have turn
ed over to them. Just how many were victimized cannot be said, as all of
them decided to keep quiet and try to catch Almand. Nor can the exact
amount of the money alleged to have been taken be named, as even the
victims do not know, but it Is estimated that the amount will be between
$40,000 and $50,000. Almand is a young man, not more than 30 years age,
and is well connected throughout the State. He is married and his family
had been residing in Conyers., Last Saturday the Sheriff of County
came to Atlanta and saw some of the parties interested In the capture of
Almand. He said he had received information which led him to believe that
Almand. was in Tulare, Cal. Sunday morning a telegram was sent to that
town and Monday a reply was received stating that Almand was under ar
rest.
TWO MOST SENSATIONAL SUICIDES.
TACOMA, Wash., Dec. 29.â There were two sensational suicides in this
county last night. Charles Lang, an employe of the Southern Pa
cific's coal mines at Carbonado, went on a Christmas carousal and
spent his last month's wages buying liquor for his friends. Yesterday he
spent the last of his money at a road house between Carbonado and Wil
keson. His whilom friends then deserted him and he became despondent
over his debauched condition. Lang had frequently threatened to kill him
pelf at the close of one of his periodical sprees. Last night this idea pos
sessed hi a-ain and he told an acquaintance he intended to end It all.
A few min-utes later he walked into a small room in the rear of the road
house and killed himself in the presence of four men and five women. Be
fore they knew it he had placed a revolver at his right temple and fired.
He died instantly.
George Remond, a German rancher, aged 50, died of starvation, having
absolutely refused to eat since he. was prevented from killing himself two
weeks ago. He shot himself at that time, but the bullet glanced on his
skull and did little damage. He wanted to aim again at his brain, but the
police interfered and sent him to the county hospital. Since then Remond's
chief aim has been to die. All efforts to have him eat have been unavailing.
He had a fancied grievance against his daughter, living in Seattle, and de
clared she should not inherit his farm at Roy. Yesterday he. sent for a
lawyer and made his will, presumably disinheriting her.
CANADIANS AFRAID OF ANNEXATION.
TORONTO, Dec. 29.â The Toronto World, which opposes the present Lib
eral Government at Ottawa, has a startling editorial to-day under the
heading "Canada on the Brink," in which it warns the people of this
country that times are critical, so far as the maintenance of Canada as
a free, independent and integral portion of North America is concerned.
"Unless Canadians," declares the World, "are fully alive to the situation
and speak out in no uncertain way. they will find themselves between a
grasping annexation movement in the United States, having for its end the
domination of the whole continent, and a great party in England, prepared
to make almost any sacrifices to the United States In consideration of <ome
kind of support of England in her race with Russia, France and other
European powers."
The World then refers to the recent speech at Macon, Ga.. of Major
General James H, Wilson of Delaware, in whic'.i that gentleman expressed
the hope that he would see the day "when our starry flag shall float every
where from the frozen north to the sunny clime of Central America."
"We believe," the World proceeds, "that these words of Mr. Wilson
only show too well the opinion of a great number of Americans, when once
their appetite for. expansion Is aroused in the direction of the north, and
if once they get it into their heads that they only have to go far enough
in their great game of bluff, which seems to be their best and their strong
est card in diplomacy, will force Canado willy-nilly Into annexation."
In conclusion the paper says: "We are nearer to absorption than ever
we were. Do Canadians realize it?"
RUSSIA FAVORS THE PANAMA CANAL
PARIS, Dec. 29.â Rupsia is evidently beginning a campaign against the
Nicaragua canal. The Novoe Vremya publishes an article not only
warmly advocating the Panama scheme, but, filled with bitter dislike
of the United States. The writer says the predominance of the United
States would have been desirable for. Russia a few years ago, but all this
has changed since the last war. The writer goes on to Bay that having
despoiled poor Spain, the United States ha 3 become a colonial party and
an Asiatic power. "Forgetting the Monroe doctrine of 'America for Ameri
cans,' which implies the other doctrine that American dominion must be
confined to America, the Yankees." he says, "are now entering into open
competition with us in China and Korea. They have no scruples over an
alliance with their traditional enemy. England, and with Japan for this pur
pose."
The Novoe Vremya then says: "For this reason Russian financiers and
diplomats ought to give their support to the French undertaking when it
comes to seriously deciding the neutralization of the Panama canal and
placing it under the general control or guarantee of European and Ameri
can powers." ' '
The writer declares the Panama route would be more beneficial to Russia
than the Nicaragua route. . â¢
WELLSFARGO ROBBED OF SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., Dec. 25*.â The local office of the Wells-Fargo Ex
press Company is out a money package containing $60,000. The money
was sent here from Houston for the southern Pacific to meet its pay
roll west from that city to El Paso. It arrived Wednesday morning and Was
given to C. A. Beeler, the Wells-Fargo money delivery clerk, to hand over.
Beeler started for the depot and was seen en route. Four hours after his
departure his wagon was found five miles west of the city in a thicket,
the horse almost dead from the eltects of hard driving. Inquiry developed
the fact that no delivery had been made. There was ho evidence of a strug
gle in the vicinity where the vehicle was found.
Beeler had been in the employ of the company for nine years and en
joyed the confidence of all. He spent several years on the frontier as a
cowboy. His friends stoutly assert that he is the victim of foul play and
his wife also inclines to this belief. Superintendent Taft of the express
company is here investigating. . He admits that the loss will reach the sum
stated, while rumor nearly doubles the amount.
WILL BE THE FASTEST REGULAR TRAIN IN THE WORLD.
S~> LEVELAND, Dec. 29.â As a reÃUlt of a meeting of division superin
( tendents of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railroad, Just held
here to rearrange time tables, it is announced that the new fast mail
â¢which is to be started next Sunday between New York and San Francisco
will be the fastest regular train in the world. That is to say there is no
other train which goes as great a distance In as short a time every day in
the year. The new mail train will reduce the time between Buffalo and Chi
cago from fifteen hours, twenty-five minutes, to thirteen hours, fifteen min
utes, a reduction of two hours and ten minutes. The total reduction in time
between New York and San Francisco over the present schedule Is a lit
tle over thirteen hours.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 30, 1898.
BUSINESS AND
PLEASURE FOR
THE TEACHERS
Topics Before State
Association.
VERY INSTRUCTIVE PAPERS
THE VARIOUS BRANCHES ARE
WE.L..L, ATTENDED.
State Superintendent-Elect Kirk Ad
vocates the Abolishment of
the County Insti
tute,
Special Dfsj>atch to Ths Call.
SANTA ROSA, Dec. 29.â The fact
that three of the principal drawing
cards of the week were presented this
morning caused State President Childs
to announce at the conclusion of last
night's session that the State Teachers'
Association would meet in the Athen
aeum to-day, Instead of In the South
Methodist Church across the street, as
It did yesterday. Subsequent develop
ments demonstrated the fact that the
change was a wise one, for although
the Athenaeum will hold an audience of
2000 people, it was taxed to its utmost
capacity all during the morning ses
sion. Had the association met in the
church some 1200 people would have
been deprived of the pleasure of hear
ing the most interesting programme so
far crowded into any one ession of the
association since it was first called to
order on Tuesday.
The association met promptly at 9
o'clock. The morning was a beautiful
one, and as the members of the asso
ciation took their seats it was apparent
from the bright eyes and rosy cheeks
and general air of animation manifest
ed on every side that the bright sun
shine had put everybody in a happy
frame of mind, and in just the right
condition to hear the treat in store
for them.
Frank Coffin, the well-known San
Francisco tenor, and who years ago and
before he ever thought of becoming a
singer, used to live in Santa Rosa, and
who consequently is a great favorite
with a Santa Kosa audience whenever
he appears, followed Mr. Childs in am.
exquisite solo, which was warmly re
ceived. A few preliminary announce
ments were then made by the presi
dent. Then the association got down to
business.
'Ihe first speaker was Dr. Washington
Wilson, the well-kncrwn Berkeley pro
fessor, who spoke of "Our Language and
Our Duty." His subject was an inter
esting one, and he handled it in a
highly interesting manner, speaking at
length of the duty the teacherÃ of the
State owed to their profession to see
that the English language was taught
In all its purity.
The Hon. John Swett, ex-Superin
tendent of Public Instruction and the
pioneer educator of the public 'schools
of the Pacific Coast, then was invited
to the platform and read his paper upon
"The Evolution of the American Sys
tem of Public Schools." Mr. Swett
was to have addressed the convention
yesterday, but he gave way at that
time to Dr. Hall, whose visit to this
coast Is limited, and spoke to-day In
stead. His paper proved to be one of
unusual interest. He traced the evo
lution of the schools of America from
the time of the landing of the early
pilgrim fathers at Plymouth Rock, en
livening the story with many incidents
relative to his own experiences while
upon the Pacific Coast.
Frank Coffin here favored the audi
ence with another vocal solo, after
which Dr. G. Stanley Hall, the presi
dent of Clarke University, delivered a
splendid address upon the subject of
"Food and Nutrition." discussing at
length and from a highly scientific
standpoint the great importance of
none but the most nutritious foods be
ing served to either teachers or pupils,
"or to anybody else for that matter,"
as he naively put it. At the conclu
sion of Dr. Hall's able address tne con
vention adjourned for lunch.
The "Round Table" sessions held In
the different parts of the city this af
ternoon developed some especially good
features. The work of these special
sessions has proved so valuable that a
large number of instructors came up
from Oakland and San Francisco this
morning especially to be in attendance
upon and take part in those discussions
which, from their special nature, were
most valuable to them in their Hne of
work.
In the department of manual train
ing and industrial education, with
headquarters In Rldgeway Hall, thf
special order of the day was "The Pres
ent Status in the Grades of Our
Schools." L. A. Buchanan of that city
told "What Stockton Is Doing."

COSTLINESS OF THE
EXPANSION POLICY
NEW YORK, Dec. 29.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
The anti-expansionists are now piling up official estimates and figures
to aid them in staying the heavy tide of popular support of the treaty
of peace. Senator Gorman, who Is opposed to expansion and also to the
large increase in the standing army of the United States, will deftly
employ official figures to support his position. As a member of the
Senate Committee on Appropiations, now engaged in formulating the
annual money bills, he is able to obtain something like a fair estimate
of what expansion will cost the United States.
In thlÃ connection Senator Gorman remarked to-night that while It
Is probable the treaty will be rati fied, the country will realize later
what an enormous amount of money we are about to pay in times of
peace. To maintain an army of 100,000 men it will cost, Senator Gor
man BayÃ, $120,000,000 per annum, to say nothing of the incidental ex
penses attending the various form* of provisional government pro
posed.
He contends that when thepeople settle down to a calm considera
tion of the immense debt now being piled up, and which we must
continue to pile to carry out the present policy of government, there
will be a material change of sentiment on the subject of expansion.
There will probably be, he says, a strong disposition to let the Fili
pinos work out their own salvation without calling upon the United
States to pay all the bills.
James Keith, San Andreas; Dr. G.
Stanley Hall, president Clarke Univer
sity. Next came an Interesting talk

Hall, and 2000 people listened to able
addresses by Superintendent - elect
Thomas J. Kirk of Fresno upon the
subject, "The County Institute," and by
Professor Bernard Moses of the Uni
versity of California on "Social Life in
Japan." Several private affairs were
also arranged in honor of certain city's
guests.
State Superintendent-elect Kirk's ad
dress at the Athenaeum attracted con
siderable attention, both on account of
its subject matter and from the fact
that as the next State Superintendent
of Public Instruction Mr. Kirk will In
all probability endeavor to put some of
the reforms he advocates into effect.
The speaker's subject was "The County
Institute," and in strong terms he ad
vocated its abolishment in the future.
Upon this subjoct the speaker said:
To the Institute as now conducted I
make the following objections:
Firstâ The time (three to five days) is
too ahort for the most valuable profes
sional training, or for any considerable
Instruction. Hence, the Institute must
deal largely with generalities and cannot
meet the wants of individuals. The
teacher returns to her work, conscious of
her Ignorance. She has been permitted
to look upon inviting fields of knowledge
which she has not had time to explore.
She realizes that she has not succeeded
as she ought; she has learned that there
are good methods which she has not
mastered, but her fund of available,
knowledge has been little increased, and
she has* lltue added power to overcome
the difficulties in the dally work. Seme
few teachers may have written thoughtful
essays, the preparation of which has, no
doubt, done them good. Institute Instruct
ors have waxed eloquent over their re
spective themes, but the mass of the
teachers have not received the benefit
commensurate with the time and expense,
certainly not if that time and money can
be better expenued.
Scond â There has been a lack of unltv
In the programme and a lack of connected
work between the Institutes from year to
year. An hour or two is spent In the dis
cussion of one topic; then another 13 I
taken up, and so on. The evenings are
devoted to lectures generally entertain
ing and instructive but with every chang
ing theme and speaker. On the following
year new instructprs must be secured,
because the teachers and the community
have heard the others, till it may be said
of the teachers of California and . the
strangers w..0 come here that "they spend
their time in nothing else but either to
tell or to hear some new thing." Too fre
quently these "new things" are untried
theories and visionary schemes, the trial
of which by the unskilled teacher has
frequently resulted in great injury to the
unsuspecting child.
Thirdâ Of necessity the institute can
not at the same time be greatly helpful
to the rural teacher, the teacher of the
city schools and the high school teacher.
There can be no question that the insti
tute is of much value to the rural teach
er, affording as it does an opportunity
to come to town, to fraternize with fel
low teachers, to renew old acquain
tances and to make new ones, and to lis
ten to and participate in the musical and
literary exercises in addition to all peda
gogical discussions which cannot be dis
pensed with. The city teacher and the
high school teacher not being bo Isolated
do not feel so much the need of such re
union, and it must be confessed that
many attend the institute as a matter of
duty rather than of pleasure or for profit.
To remedy as far as maybe these de
fects and to remove these objections 1
submit three plans and ask that you give
them careful consideration. The tlrst
calls for an institute to last five full days
with the subjects to be treated to be re
duced in number and increased in effec
tiveness. In the opinion of the speaker
not more than two subjects should be
taken up by any one institute until the
entire school curiculum has been covered.
The second calls for the amendment of
the law providing for the Institute so as
to allow a two weeks' session to be held,
allowing all teachers half pay for their
time in attendance. Hold each institute
Just oefore the opening of the first term
in the school year. Let the Instructors
be appointed by the State Board of Edu
cation, and let them be paid stipulated
salaries by the State, their time when
not engaged in institute work to be de
voted to instruction in the State Normal
schools or in the State University. Six ca
pable State instructors at salaries of $;iOOO
each could be secured for the money now
annually paid by the counties for irreg
ular instructors. The third, and, in the
opinion of the speaker, the best plan,
provides for the abolition altogether of
Teachers' Institute and for the estab
lishment of summer and winter schools
of special training, to be under the aus
pices of the State University and the in
structors of the State normal schools.

GUARDS WHO

Aided in Taking Opium
to Prisoners.

UNDERGROUND RAILWAY VIA
THE PRISON WALL.
Warden Hale Investigating the Lat
est San Quentin Scandal and
Discharging the Officers
Found Implicated.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Dec. 29.â
Despite the reticence of the officers. It
is now definitely known that the prison
is on the verge of the greatest opium
scandal in its history and that the dis
charge of Guards Cramer and Brooks,
as given exclusively In Sunday's Call,
was simply the beginning of the shake
up. It Is known that two more guards
will follow, and it is believed that seve
ral others will be shown to be impli
cated before the investigation is over.
Last Sunday Warden Hale was
closeted all day with Stenographer
Reynolds and during this time fully a
dozen guards were sent for and their
testimony taken one at a time. The
evidence secured proved that at last
the famous underground railway by
which opium has found its way Into
San Quentin Prison has been located
beyond a doubt. The "tip" by which
it was done came from a convict named
Miller, who is closely guarded in order
to prevent the infuriated prisoners
from taking his life. Last week Miller,
who assisted in the tower gate, In
formed Gate Keeper Gillardin that Jo
seph Brooks and John Cramer were
smuggling the drug into the prison.
Warden Hale was then in Oakland,
but Gillardin set Guard Alden to watch
the two. He saw Cramer walk down
the wall between the tower gate and
the jute mill and hand Brooks a pack
i age, which the latter lowered to a con
! vict by means of a string. Alden
j waited until the prisoner was out of
1 6ight of his confederates and made him
i give up the package. It contained half
| a pound of opium. When the Warden
returned he was acquainted with the
| farts and immediately gave the two
] their discharge.
Letters and papers discovered by the
Warden's emissaries showed others to
I be in the plot, and the investigation
began. One of the guards to be dis
charged, it is stated, comes from Ala
meda County. So fierce were the
threats made against Miller fey the con
vict "merchants" and peddlers of the
drug that it was found necessary to
keep him away from the table where
I his fellow prisoners ate. shut him in.
his cell at a different hour and have a
guard constantly keep his eyes on
I Miller. The slightest relaxation of vig
| ilance and Miller will pay for the in
] formation he gave with his life.
Brooks was a clerk at the last session
! of the Legislature and owed his ap
i pointment to Sip Bettman. Cramer la
said to have been on the notorious
"temporary roll" of the same body and
secured his appointment as guard
through Senator Dwyer.

In view of the fact that the Republican organization of Santa Barbara

! ble that such a man could be chosen to
represent California In the upper house
of Congress. Laying; aside his reputa
tion ho is utterly lacking in the require
ments essential to be of service to the
State in that body.
'â¢Bui the great thiiiÂ£ is his awful rec
ord. It has become known to all the
world a:id how could we hope to ever
regain our self-respect were we to send
a willful transgressor of the laws of
two countries to represent uh in the
Senate? It would take many years for'
California to recover from the stisma;
it would disrupt the Republican party
in the State.
"D. M. Burns as Senator is an im
possibility; he must hot become the
choice of the Legislature. Every lio-nest
man in the State should rise up and
protest against such a thins. 1 have
I been loth to believe that Burns was
seriously considered as a Senatorial
! candidate, but now that there is no
longer a doubt that he is bending
every energy tQ accomplish this end I
foci that were 1 to remain silent on this
matter any longer I would be derelict
in my duty as a citizen of California.
"If Mr. Burns is efr-cted oenator by
the Southern Pacific Company it will
create an opposition in this State that
will wmk the corporation more injury
than Mr. Burns as Senator can bene
fit it."
This is the opinion of a representative
business man. Below are the senti
ments of the spokesmen of the party
throughout the State. It is for the
legislators t" mark and heed:

He still believes Bulla is really in the

therefore, he pays he will obey the in

"As long as Bulla lias a chance I will
vote for him," said Melick. "I do not be
lieve that the people have any idea how
much strength Bulla has."
"Do you think Bulla Is the catspaw of
Burns"
"No, I do not," said Melick. "In any

of circumstances could arise which would
Induce me to vote for Burns."
"Will yon vote for (Jrant?"

Notice lias been given that the seat of

the Sixtieth Assembly District, which
comprises the counties of .Mono, Inyo and

majority of fifteen â¢ votes over his Re

w;i^ the fusion candidate, and the contest
between himself and Mclver was 'spirit
ed and occupied the attention of voters
in. a degree second only to the contest be

Both men ai" well kiun-n and equally
popular, a fi'ct that i? made apparent by
the cir.se vote recorded. The contest
brought by Mclver will be one of the in

fort Is made to secure a decision of the

LANDS IN HAWAII
CAUSE LITIGATION
UNAUTHORIZED AGREEMENTS
CREATE TROUBLE.
Rudolph Spreckels Accused of Ex
ceeding: His Authority as Pres
ident of a Big Company.
.Suit has been filed by the Hawaiian
Commercial and Sugar Company against
tho- Mani Railroad and Steamship Gom
}ii<iiy and' Rudolph Spreckels to declare
null, void and fraudulent certain pur
ported agreements entered into between
tlje corporations, / such so-called agree
ments having been- made â¢without the
knowledge of the plaintiff but with tho
full knowledge of the defendant. The suit
involves title .to valuable lands and the
'\i<e of railroads near Maui, H. 1., which
both companies claim but which it ap
pears from the complaint rest legally
with the plaintiff corporation.
In February of the present year, it is
! averred in the complaint, Rudolph Sprec
kela was the president of the plaintiff
cur;. oration. While.so Officiating, when In
Honolulu, ho. communicated with the
Maui Railroad and Steamship Company,
having headquarters in this city, stating
that as tho president and attorney in fact
| of the Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar
Company, he could offer, on behalf of the
corporation which he represented, certain
valuable lands near Maul. H. L, in ex
change tor 600 shares of the capital stock
of the Maui Railroad and Steamship Com
pany. Which ho (Spreekels) would hold in
trust for the company. In a second com
munication, written the same day, Ru
dolph Spreckels offered to lease a railroad
twenty milts in length, running from
BpreckelsvillQ into the sugar lands, for
[ certain specified compensation. Subse-
I quently agreements or contracts, in ac
; eordaneÂ» with the communications re
j ferred to, were drawn up and signed by a
I representative of tho defendant corpora -
I tion and Rudolph Spreckels. as president
and attorney in fact of the Hawaiian
i Commercial and Sugar Company.
The facts surrounding the agreements
finally became known to the various
stockholders of the Hawaiian Commercial
and Sugar Company, and they decided to
bring suit to declare the agreements null
and void. The f.OO shares of Â«tock ac
cepted by Rudolph Spreckols in exchange
for the title of the lands referred to were
! never turned over to the company, it is
I alleged, and. furthermore, the agreement
I was never authorized Ây the company.
This stock received by Rudolph Spreckels
in exchange for the lands has been trans
ferred to a third party, it is further set
forth, and has been withheld from the
company for unassigned reasons. Tn the
prayf of (he complaint the court is asked
to declare the agreements null arid void
and to adjudge that the agreements work
as a fraud against the interests of the
company and for general relief.

ASSEMBLYMAN
CHARGED WITH
MANSLAUGHTER
C. F. Kennealy Held Responsible
for the Death of William
Quane.
Quane Was Thrown to the Sidewalk and His
Skull Fractured During a Quarrel Over
a Long Unsettled Account Between
the Two Men.
WILLIAM QUANE, a retired
shoemaker, who has been run
ning a printing establishment In
the rear of his residence, 91 South
Park, Is lying dead at the Morgue as the
result of injuries received in a row with
Assemblyman-elect C. F. K.ennealy of 514
Bryant street yesterday morning. The lat
ter was arrested and charged with man
slaughter, but was released on his own |
recognizance soon after being taken to !
the Central station by Judge Mngan.
The squabble which resulted in the
death of the old man occurred at 10:40
in the morning, near the corner of Third
and Brannan streets. There were many
people In the vicinity, but the affair oc
curred so suddenly that the first intima
tion any one had of the catastrophe was
when they saw Quane lying on the side
walk and Kennealy bending over him.
Even then it was not thought that the
old man was seriously Injured.
A crowd quickly gathered .and in answer
to questions put by Officer James CCon-
nor, â who was among the first to arrive,
Kennealy said that Quane had been hurt
by falling on the sidewalk while squab
bling with him. .Quane's son, James, ar
rived, about this time and the old man was
removed to 'his home in a hotel bus. The
officer and most of the civilians present
peemed to think that tho injured man
was suffering more from the effects of
liquor than from physical harm and no
attempt was made to detain Kennealy.
As he started away he said to the of
ficer. "You know where you can find me
when you want me."
Dr. A. T. Dlcksoti of DS9V& Bryant street
was summoned to attend Quane as soon
as he had been removed to his home
and a brief examination only was neces
sary to show that the patient was beyond
medical aid. Quane died at 12:30 p. m.
The police and the Coroner were at once
notified and the body was removed to the
MOrgue. Officer O'Connor was ordered to
priest Kennealy. He found the Assem
blyman at the "Palace Hotel at 1:30 p.m.
and took him .into custody. Kennealy
was greatly surprised when inform* d
that the man with whom .he had quar
reled was. dead, and he strenuously de
nial that he had knocked him down. His
version or the. affair is as follows:
"I left my house at 544 Bryant street at
10-30 a. m. to go to. my barn on Brannan
street When near the corner of Bran
nan, on Third, I met Quane, who was
leading two greyhounds. â  I asked him
vhen he was going to pay me a bill
which 1 had sent him for the storage of
two wagons, but which he had paid no
attention to. The bill amounted to about
$k He said I had used one of his wagons
during the campaign for carrying a ban
ner. This I admitted was true, but told
him 1 had allowed him for that in tho
bill.
'â¢ â¢Well, I am not going to pay you any
thing. anyway, 1 he said.
"Then I told him 1 would send him an
other bill and ho could deduct what he
thought was duo for ttie uae <>i the wagon
and pay me the balance. He swore he
would pay nothing and acted in such a
manner that I thought he had been drink
ing. He started toward me and I told him
to keep awa<", as 1 did not want any
trouble with him. At. that he drew back
his foot to kick me and I put out my left
hand and pushed him away. As I did so
Quane's greyhounds ran between us and
he tripped over them and fell to the side
walk. He strmk on the back of his head
and was rendered unconscious. I propped
him up against the building and then r;m
to AlcGaffegan's saloon, at the corner of
Brannan and Third, when? I got some
whisky and a wet towel with which 1
tried to revive him. He did not seem to
be badly hurt, and with the help of sev
eral men who had arrived I placed him
in a Ha,ckmeier Hotel bus, which was
passing, and sons him Homo. Then 1 came
down town. I did not strike him. F bore
him no ill will and had no thought of do
ing him an injury. We had turned into
IJrannan street while the quarrel was go-
Ing on and he fell about twenty feet from
the corner."
Kennealy was taken to Chief Lees'
office in the City Hall, where be was
( -barged with manslaughter. Flo made a
sworn statement of the affair, substan
tially as given here. He appeared very
much affected by Quane's death and
seemed completely unnerved by the tragic
consequences of the quarrel. Kennealy
sent for Attorney A<-h as soon as he. was
arrested, and the latter soon appeared at
tho City Hall, accompanied by Judge Mo
ti.iTi. who released th-* prisoner on his own
recognizance within an hour after his ar
rest.
Tho Quane residence is within a block
of whero the quarrel occurred. The old
man and his 15-year-old sun Thomas
started from the house at 10:3u to exercise
the dogs. The boy was leading one of the
dogs by a strap and his father had the
other two. They walked through a little
alley leading from the rear of the house
to Third street, and had Just emerged on
to the main thoroughfare when they met
Kennealy. As the elder Quane stopped to
t;ilk with the Assemblyman the boy con
tinued on his way up Third street, cross
ing to tho other side of Brannan street.
As ho stopped on the curb he noticed the
drivers or passing rigs looking back, and
turning he saw his father lying on the
sidewalk. He ran back and secured the
dogs and hurried home. He burst into
the house with the announcement that
"Charlie Kennealy knocked father down
on Third street," and promptly disap
peared, not to be found again for a couple
of hours. When finally corraJed he could
throw no light on the affair. He had
heard no words pass between his father
and Kennealy, and had seen no blow
struck. Apparently there were no wit
nesses to the occurrence, as no one has
Tbe Arrested flsseroblymar) and the Mao Whose Death HÂ«
Is Accused of Causing.
yet been found who saw, or noticed, the
men until the unconscious form of Quane
was lying on the sidewalk.
Dr Gallagher performed an autopsy on
the body and found that the hack part
of the 'skull had been fractured by a
blow or a fall and that death had re
sulted from hemorrhage of the brain. Ine
only exterior marks of violence on the
body was a lump on the back or tne
head, midway between the ears.
Kennealy is a small man. weighing
about 130 pounds, while Quane, who was
!-68! -68 years old. weighed fully 200 pounds
i The Coroner will hold an inquest at 9:30
! a. m. to-day. Â
[ Mr. Quane was a widower. 58 years old.
He leaves five childrenâ Mrs. M. Hook.
| Mrs J J. Neely and John F., James and
first thought there
were no eyewitnesses to the altercation
between Kennealy and Quane. G. F. Law
son claims to have been In the vicinity at
the time and to have seen Kennealy
strike the old man. He says that as he
\v;is cumins up Brannan street from his
work he stopped at the corner of Third
! street and saw William Quane, whom he
know by sight, standing on the opposite
side of 'the street. He was In company
'â¢ with Kennealy at the time. Suspecting
from the heated remarks that were ex
changed between the two men that
something was wrong I,awson concluded
to remain unobserved and watch the de
velopment of the quarrel.
After a short discussion he saw Ken
nealy attempt to thrust the old man to
ward the edge of the sidewalk. Quane
protested and stepped toward his antag
onist. At the time he had the guard
lines of two dogs in his hands. Without
the least warning. Lawson says, Ken
nealy struck him in the mouth. Quane
fell from the force of the blow, striking
his he;!/* against the pavement.
"Kennealy." said Lawson, "then lifted
the old man up and attempted to seat
him against the side of an adjoining
building. He then went into the saloon
I on the corner, where he procured a bot
tle of whisky, and he poured a few drops
i if the Honor into the injured man's
mouth, but Quane's stomach rebelled
against it.
"The Assemblyman-elect," continued
Lawson. "then suggested to one of the
many bystanders who had by this time
formed Into a crowd around the uncon
scious body of Quane that It would be a
good Idea for some of them to take Quane
borne. maintaining that he was perfectly
able to stand and walk if he wanted to."
At ibis juncture Lawson claims to have
interfered, protesting that the injured
man was unconscious and that it would
be impossible fr>r him to be conveyed
home in any other way than in an arabu
lance. Acting under this suggestion a
! hotel bus was obtained and the injured
I man conveyed to his home at 91 South
j Park.
Joseph Berry also claims to have seen
j a scuffle between the two men, but he
is unable to say positively whether Quane
was Htruck by Kennealy or was thrown
to the sidewalk as a consequence of be
coming entangled in the guard ropes of
the dogs as they made an effort to escape.

The San Francisco members of the
Pacific Coast Hardware and Metal Asso

I Washington districts, and Messrs Griss
i man. ("lark and Heath of the California
ijlstrlct. The committee of arrangements
was composed of M.-s.-rs. Tay, Carrigarv
and Scott. The elaborate menu and hand
some decorations attested the fact that
tlio committee was well chosen.
Thf. association was organized four
years ago for the purpose or bringing the
gentlemen engaged in the hardware busi
ness closer together socially and thereby
enable them to make a stronger fight
against the common enemy, the invader
from the. Kast. The success of the or

THE T. C. WALKER EXPLOSION.
IZ^ROM the report made by Captains Bulger and
Bolles, United States Inspectors of Steam Ves^
, it appears the explosion of the boiler of the
T. C. Walker was not due to accident which could
not have been foreseen and avoided, but to a culpable
nee whose inevitable result could have been
nothing else than what happened.
The findings of the report are that the boiler-room
far from the engine-room it was not possible
for the single engineer to give proper attention to
one without neglecting his duty to the other. He
could not be in two places at once. It is to be re
gtctted the inspectors did not notice that fact before
the accident happened, but there is comfort in the
fact that they have learned the lesson at last and state
in their report, "We will issue an order to the owners
of steamers where like conditions obtain to place two
licensed engineers on watch."
The lack of a sufficient number of engineers to at
tend to both the engines and the boilers was not, how
ever, the only negligence on the ill-fated steamer. The
inspectors found that the tubes in some of the boilers
showed evidences of having been overheated and the
fusible plug was about melted out. Moreover, it ap
pears that an iron plug was used in place of the fusible
plug, and no report of the fact was made to the in
spectors by any of the officers of the vessel.
On this showing the report says: ''It is evident to
us that in many cases the licensed officers of steam
vessels fail to report occurrences on board which it
is their duty to make known to the Inspectors of
Steam Vessels, for fear of dismissal from employment,
and that this fear likewise causes them to withhold
tlvngs known to them concerning the steamers upon
which they are employed when testifying in. investiga
tir.ns held by this board."
While declaring "we are unable to attach the
blame of this explosion to the engineer in charge at
the time or to any other licensed officer of the
steamer," the inspectors nevertheless suspend the li
cense of the chief engineer for three months for using
an iron plug instead of a fusible plug, and the licenses
of the engineer in charge and of the assistant en
gineer are suspended for two months for neglecting
to '-eport the fact.
The findings are not severe, but they should serve
as a warning to river boat owners. Cases of acci
dents caused by similar acts of negligence or careless
ness may not be so lightly treated hereafter.
THE BILLBOARD NUISANCE.
THE action of the Supervisors in referring the
ordinance regulating the height of billboards
and imposing a license Upon them back to a
committee, in order that a local firm of bill posters â 
may make an "argument" upon the question, is a I
virtual transfer of the subject to the. new Supervisors, j
The present board holds but two more meetingsâ '
Saturday and Monday. Both days will be devoted !
to the obsequies of the members and no attention will
be given to practical legislation. â¢ :
It is in ruder, therefore, to call the attention of the
new Supervisors to this subject. These gentlemen will
find the ordinance of the present board before their
C< mniittee and ready for their hand. All they need
to do will be to listen to the "argument" of the bill
posters, report the ordinance favorably and pass it. |
Mayor Phelan undoubtedly will sign any reasonable j
enactment. But his action need not bother the new i
Supervisor?. It will be time enough to present facts

common weni and common sense demand shall- be

The locality and height of the signs should be regu

should not be left to the bill posters themselves. The

the firemen, who look after their own as well as
other lives, are constantly enforcing the fire laws'.
Finally, the billboards should be made to pay a
license. This is no more than fair. Bill-Sticking now
pays nothing into' the treasury, notwithstanding it is
a nuisance of the most virulent character. The new
Foard of Supervisors cannot devote its attention to
a Dipre important question than this, and in legislat
ing it will have practically the unanimous support of
the people. Outside the ranks of the bill posters them
selves nobody desires the maintenance of high bill
boards. which pay nothing toward the support of the
government, while drawing heavily from the bast
ross interesti of the city.

would have been expressed by different figures if he
had not chosen Dan Burns to manage his mine.
CELEBRATE OUR SEMI-CENTENNIAL.
y~* ALIFORNIA was admitted into the Union
September 9, 1850. In 1900 she will celebrate
J the fiftieth anniversary of her statehood. How
[shall it be done?
To appreciate the achievements of that half century
one must reflect upon the conditions under which it
began. For a hundred years there had been here and
there on this soil a dreamy- civilization. It had slept
and enjoyed its reveries in unknown contact with the
wonderful natural resources, n >w partly known and
partly developed. From clustering around the early
missions it had secured here and there a foothold in
our grassy valleys, where the lords of the great
grants lived as the Highland chiefs lived, in the
midst of their clans. Flocks and herds roamed at will
in the valleys, cropping their forage, sharing it with
the deer, elk and antelope, and sharing with them also
the risks from mountain lions and their predatory
partners. Beyond the ecclesiastical authority, seated
in the missions, there was no conspicuous attempt to
found institutions, and. in justice to those pioneers
of civilization, it must be admitted that their simple
lives gave but small occasion for the exercise of
governmental authority. California was but little
known to the outside world. Guarded by its moun
tain wall on the east and by the wide stretching
deserts of water on the west, its topography, physical
geography, its seasons and its soil and sky were the
subject of interesting speculation, as the vast reaches
or Africa are now, but there was less actual knowl
edge about them than the world of to-day has of the
Dark Continent Fremont came as an explorer, and
though this generation cannot realize it, his own time
rtvogp.izeil in him all that civilization sees now in
Livingstone, Speke and Stanley. The simple story of
his trials, his passing of parched deserts and scaling
of lofty mountains; his nights in the somber forest on
guard against wild beasts and wilder men; his descent
upon the plains, all the man-els which he first
brought to the world's attention, appealed to the im
agination and inspired romance. It was the first
achievement to excite the fancy and rouse the
sprit of adventure in the New World since the expe
ditions of Fizarro and Cortez. Followed closely by
the discovery of gold, the world's imagination, fired
by the adventures 01" the Pathfinder, was inflamed by
the vision of wealth. The pastoral civilization of the
country was swept from the valleys by the besom of
a crusade before which crumbled all that had been.
When the admission of California was put among
the compromises of 1850 in Mr. Clay's omnibus bill
this State was introduced upon the theater of national
politics. Though it was yielding gold, the knowledge
of its more permanent resources was so meager that
many things in the debates on Clay's measure seem
remarkable now. Webster's speech will always stand
as a monument to his genius. The ultra Southern
sentiment resisted the admission of California as a
free State because it would destroy the sectional bal
ance. Free and slave States had entered the Union
in pairs; Vermont and Kentucky in 1791-92; Tennes
see and Ohio 1796-1802; Louisiana and Indiana
1812-16; Mississippi and Illinois 1817-18; Alabama
and Maine 1819-20; then came the break in this
order and the first compromise. Missouri and
Arkansas came in 1820-36, and the Missouri com
promise line of 36 degrees 30 minutes was drawn,
south of which all should be slave and north
all should be free. Between 1820 and 1846
four slave States came in and only one free. In
the next two years came two free States, and then
California. knocked with the line of 36 degrees 30.min
utes dividing her into two nearjy equal parts. Begin
ning at about Cypress Point, on Monterey Bay, that
line crossed the San Joaquin Valley between- Fresno
and Visalia, crossed Mount Whitney and cut off the
northernmost sands of Death Vailey. If those who
stood by the compromise of 1820 had prevailed, rlav
cry and freedom would have metat that line.
The situation was. portentous, and the solution
came in the speech ot Webster. Turning to the Sen
ators of the slave States., he told them they would
lose nothing. Slavery was an incident of physical
conditions. It had receded from New England and
the Middle States because in their climate it was un
ptofitable, and, like every system of labor, .the essence
of its being was in its profit. Then, turning to Cali
fornia, he said it was, in its physical geography and
its topography, Asiatic. . It differed in these respects
from the rest of the continent. Its products would
be found peculiar to itself, different from those of the
rest of our domain. Chattel slavery had never flour
ished in Asia for physiqal reasons, and, as Congress
could not repeal nor compromise a natural law, slav
ery, if founded in this Asiatic atmosphere,. would per
ish and fade away. â¢ â  â¢ . . â 
Looking backward through the events and across
the development, of two score years and. eight; one
stands as enchanted in the presence of Webster,
struck with the universality of his knowledge and- the
prophecy that was in his analysis. The source of his
ir, formation has been a mystery to students. But it is
j known that he gained it from a man who was by na
' tyre an empire builder and the keenest observer of
j nature and her resources this coast and country have
! known. Dr. Gwin was one of our first Senators, He
i was in Washington. from his election in 1849 to the
admission of the State in 1850. Bom a slaveholder, a
participant in the exciting history of Jackson's ad
ministrations, he pioneered here and put his hand to
the foundations of California. From him Webster
had the accurate description of the physical condi
tions of California from which his genius developed
that generalization which has been proved in every
j detail.
I . So. impinged upon history, this land merged from
j its past into . statehood. Every step of the way is
j written in romance and every advance is bowered in
I beauty, and spread with abundance.
When this became the first Pacific State it stood
! alone. lowa, Missouri, Arkansas and Texas were the
frontier. We were the isolated star on the flag. Now
out of the vast region held by wild tribes, fortified by
mountain and desert, which lay in splendid solitude
between us and our sisters of the Union, and north
Ito the confines, ten States have been erected. We
i are alone no more. The subject expands as we con
! template it. How shall all of its suggestions find em
j phasis in the golden wedding anniversary of our
j State? Let California invite her ten juniors here to
:an exposition of her developments. We have had a
midwinter fair. Let us celebrate in 1900 with a mid
summer exposition our semi-centennial as a State of
this Union. Let us rebuild in Golden Gate Park the
; first mission consecrated on this soil and in architec
i ture, productions and institutional progress illustrate
: each step we have taken in fifty years. The world's
I eye is turned again to the Pacific Coast and the
world's hand reaches across all latitude and longitude
Jto grasp the newly found treasures of our north. In
such a semi-centennial exposition all lands will find
I interest. The clemency of our summer climate, our
I cooling trade winds, our capacious cornucopia, filled
with our rare products, and our lintels bright with
blooming garlands, will invite the world to enter a
j fairy land and rest with us in the midst of beauties

and sovereignty and led on to a destiny up to the full
measure of our natural endowment. Let us exploit
it all and justify our pride in our inheritance.
BY the open letter of Thomas V. Cator, published
in The Call of yesterday, public attention is
directed again to the increasing evidences of the
decline of Populism. In all parts of the Union the
defections from the party are numerous, and long be
fore the next Presidential election is held the organ
ization will have gone the way of Coxey's army.
The reasons for the disappearance of the party are
not hard to seek. It was made up of three classes of
citizens. First, those of socialistic tendencies who
desire to attempt to equalize human conditions and
make all men virtuous and prosperous by the enact
ment of certain laws which they regard as
panaceas for all the ills of society; sec
ond, those who, by reason of the hard
times and industrial depression, had been rendered
so discontented with existing conditions they were
willing to accept any sort of change simply for the
sake of change; third, those who had become indig
nant at the boss rule and machine methods of the two
old parties and hoped to attain political reform
through the new organization.
The capture of Democracy by the Bryanites on the
Chicago platform drew the great mass of the
socialistic element of the country to that party, and
to that extent weakened the Populist organization
by taking from it its most aggressive element. The
restoration of prosperity under the McKinley ad
ministration by the re-establishment of the protec
tive system and the maintenance of the gold standard
caused thousands who had voted with the Populists
in former elections to return to the Republican party,
and finally the capture of the Populist organization by
the Democratic bosses completed the ruin of the
movement by driving from it all who had hoped to
see it conducted on lines of honesty and indepen
dence.
It is hardly likely the factors that made Populism
so strong during the last eight years will ever come
together again. The tie that bound them in the past
was never a strong one, nor was their union based
upon any fundamental principle of political action.
That much was shown by the fact that in the North
ern States the party acted with Democrats against
Republicans, while in the South it acted with Repub
licans against Democrats. It had no convictions on
questions of tariff or sound money, and was animated
in each State mainly by a desire to defeat the domi
nant party in that State.-
In his letter Mr. Cator pointed out many reasons
why earnest Populists who have been sincerely seek
ing the welfare of the people should return to the Re
publican party and hereafter act with it. The coun
sel will doubtless be accepted by all former Populists
of that class. In fact the overwhelming vote by which
Maguire was defeated is. an evidence that the more
conservative members of the party have already be
come disgusted with fusion and Bryanism and are
ready to work hereafter in the ranks of the great party
of prosperity and constructive statesmanship.
The country is to be congratulated on the decline
of this organization,, which at one time threatened to
seriously disturb the politics of the nation. Its rise
was caused by hard times and discontent, and its fall
is the surest sign of the return of prosperity and po
litical common sense among, the people. .
\A ORE than once since practical, possession was
/ \ taken of the Philippines there- has been occa
sion to use the homely figure portraying the
position of the Government as similar to that of the
man who had the bear by the tail. He wanted to let
go, but there were manifest difficulties in the way.
â¢Every day the fact becomes more strongly impres
sive that to hold the islands will be a continual an
noyance and expense of men and money. It is true
the Spanish have been subdued, but the natives have
not, -and they show scant inclination to bow to the
authority, of the conquerors of Spain. So far has the
administration been committed that it is bound as
a tribute to its own pride not to submit to the semi
savages. It may be obliged to defeat them, and just
how long and disastrous this will be is a matter the
future holds secret.
The present situation calls into prominence that to
Americans the approved style of government is by
consent of the governed. The implied sentiment is
not that this consent is to be won at the point of the
bayonet. Once thoroughly licked, the inhabitants of
the Philippines, in order to avoid a further visita
tion, might consent to extend fealty to the stars and
stripes, but it would not be a glad and loyal fealty.
It would have to be kept in working order by the
presence of troops, backed by warships in the harbor.
Thus it is that Uncle Sam has a large bear by the
tail. If he could with dignity loose his grip he would
be glad to do so. But he can't, and the laugh is on
Uncle.
Judge Belcher says that if he had his way the nine
notorious School Directors would be put in a cage
and dumped into the bay. Judge Belcher is a jurist
of discernment, and it is to be regretted that he lacks
power to pass and enforce such a sentence as he sug
gests. . â¢
To restrain such a brazen lot of rascals as the ma
jority of the School Directors requires something
more than a court injunction. Why not place them
within the hampering environment of San Quentin,
an institution provided for people of their stamp?
Perhaps the Czar is trying to borrow that $150,000,
000 to strengthen his army only in order that he may
be able to dictate the terms of the universal peace for
which his heart is yearning. Either this, or the
Czar is a royal josher.
According to the Examiner, the Assistant Secretary
of War doe's not have any original opinion as to the
situation. If he wants to say anything he corrals a
Hearst editorial, marks it, '"Them's my sentiments,"
and turns it loose.
The Supervisors might amend their signboard re
stiictions so as to tax the boards reaching to a height
of one thousand feet or over. This would salve their
consciences and make the proprietors of the nuisances
fe- 1 good.
When the lawyers in the Botkin case are appealing
to the jury for justice, an impertinent, irrelevant and
immaterial question will arise as to whether it is
really justice that they want.
There is a footpad at Santa Rosa whom the citizens
desire to hang. To hope they may catch him before
they have had time for a sober second thought is a
natural impulse.
The effort to secure the release of Mrs. Brandes for
some reason fails to excite public sympathy, although
it is known that the woman positrvely objects to re

THE END OF POPULISM.
UNCLE SAMUEL'S BEAR.
WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE PHILIPPINES?
Since the publication of my article
(Shall We Annex the Philippines?) in
The Call of December 19, I have been
burdened with inquiries as to what we
shall do with the Philippines. That
is, if we do not keep them, how shall
we get rid of them? It does not seem
to occur to most people to ask or try
to answer the somewhat Celtic inquiry,
but the more difficult one, what shall
we do with them if we do keep them?
It really seems to me that while but a
few weeks ago the overwhelmingly pre
vailing sentiment was to keep the is
lands because they were a good thing
to have and to keep, that very many,
perhaps a majority, have come to see
the matter differently upon reflection
and would honestly like to be well rid
of our responsibilities as to these is
lands and their inhabitants, but have
now assumed the rather difficult and
dogmatic position that we have them
and are morally and legally responsi
ble for their future and government
and can discharge this obligation only
by annexation in one form or another.
I do not assume that I am asked this
question because it is supposed I have
the ability to answer it, but as the
most available way to answer the ob
jections urged to annexation in any
form â to answer a question' intelli
gently â we must first consider how it
originated and next consider whether it
is predicated on fact or falsehood.
Ever since Dewey sailed into the har
bor of Manila and sunk the Spanish
fleet it has been industriously heralded
and proclaimed that we were the real
possessors and rulers of all the Philip-
FRANK H- SHORT
pines and the inhabitants thereof
while, In fact, we then had only one
harbor with no. land or military pos
session of even one island or city anc
have advanced little beyond this even
now, and doubtless thousands of the
aforesaid .Inhabitants do not know to
this day that' we are in possession of
Manila or that there is such a country
as these United States of which we as
sume they are "truly loyal" citizens or
Inhabitants. The heroic performance
of Dewey and his brave men was sole
ly a war measure to destroy a fleet
that if left at large would menace and
possibly destroy our Pacific commerce
and Pacific Coast cities. If it could
be destroyed it was indispensable in the
prosecution of the war to destroy it at
once. It was therefore destroyed and
with a celerity and dispatch calculated
to add Imperishable luster to American
naval annals. Immediately thereafter
it was proclaimed by the press, the pul
pit and the campaign orator that
American valor had added many and
populous islands to our dominions, and
that we were advance agents of lib
erty and prosperity to bring to these
oppressed people freedom of thought
freedom of conscience and were but an
instrument in the hands of Divine
Providence to accomplish these and
oth.-r miraculous results.
We might remark in passing that the
most unreliable specimen of the uncer
tain human race is the unlicensed pur
veyor of advance information' of the
wise provid'-nce and secret purposes o
Almighty God. The fact is and we state
it confidently that there is not and
never was the slightest reason or au
thority for any if these claims or as
sertions. We had a right until peace
decreed otherwise to star as long as
we wanted to and sail away whenever
we chose. We respectfully challenge
history for a single example and inter
national law for a single precedent to
sustain such a contention; that by the
conditions existing we were under any
such responsibility or obligation or
possessed any such assumed right to
rule these islands or these people ex
cept the assumed right of the despot and
the arbitration of the sword. Accord
ing to the code of international law es
tablished among those nations that for
hundreds of years have assumed the
right to rule any people they could
conquer we could at will if we could
dispossess the ruler and subject the
subject, rule them if we chose, but that
we were obligated to, whether consist
ent with our constitution or best for our
own people or not, is without a shadow
of force or precedent. According to our
announced theories of government
Spain ruling these people by force and
without their consent was doing so
wrongfully, yet by destroying that
power and wrong we assume, not only
the right, but adding hypocrisy to the
power and desire assume the duty and
obligation to rule these people by force
if need be. They have not only not ac
tually or technically or in any way
asked us to rule, protect or enlighten
them, but a large majority of them
have undoubtedly neither the freedom,
information, intelligence nor understand
ing to do so, and those that have the
intelligence are protesting against an
nexation and demanding independence.
If they had the freedom, intelligence
and opportunity to and did ask us to
do these things, then and not until then
we would have the right to assume the
privilege and duty, but at the same
time the undoubted right to refuse if
we did not consider it agreeable, profit
able or beneficial for our own people
so to do. It is essential to national
existence that every nation shall pur
sue a course of enlightened selfishness.
The first and controlling aim and al
most exclusive purpose of each gov
ernment is the preservation, protection,
advancement and well being of its own
subjects or citizens. It is essential to
national existence that such should be
the conduct of each nation and it is
so expected and any contrary assump
tion is not only unwise but usually
hypocritical. As an illustration, but
not as an example, when Emperor Wil
liam of Germany, by the generalship of
Yon Moltke and the iron hand of Bis
marck, camped in the capital of France
and held the French people in his
power, he assumed no obligations and
pretended none as to the future govern
ment of France or the future wellbeing
of the French people. He dictated his
terms, took what he wanted for his
people and left the rest to the empire,
the republic or the commune of France.
This pretense of obligation, this pre
tense of unselfish desire to rule, with
out their will or consent, and to en
lighten at our expense as a nation, if
need be, a lot of equatorial Malays, is
bo unmanly, so false and unAmerican
_as America has hitherto stood among
the nations of the world that we ought
to be ashamed of it and ought either to
come out and say we want them De
cause we need them in our business or
we do not want them because they
would be injurious to us.
The American people can assume an
obligation only as ordained by law and
the constitution. The army and the
navy, the executive and the judiciary,
all acting, cannot annex any country
or people or obligate us to annex them.
It is only by treaty, ratified by two
thirds of the Senate or a majority of
both houses of Congress, that such can
be done or such real obligation in
curred. Even if the treaty were rati
fied we would then only be substituted
to Spain's rights, which is the right to
forcibly rule a people without their
consent and which is foreign to our
theories of government. To-day what
ever form of government exists in the
Philippines, other than Spanish or
American military rule, is insurgent,
avowedly seeking to establish some
form of independent government. If
the treaty be ratified it can only be
prevented from working incalculable
injury to this people by allowing them
to do what they obviously want to do
set up a government of their osvn. We
are told that it will not be stable and
cannot defend itselfâ a most excellent
argument against, mixing it with our
own. Suppose it is not stable, the
Central American republics so-called
here in our own hemisphere have a
revolution about every ninety days and
seem to enjoy it. In any event if the
treaty shall be ratified we can then co
operate as expeditiously and honestly
as possible in assisting these people to
set up as respectable and stable a form
of government as they are capable of
and then wash cur hands of the whole
uncongenial and unAmerican business
and return to our own jurisdiction.
The person who advocates that these
people are incapable of self-govern
ment, present or future, and therefore
we cannot humanely leave them to their
own resources and follies and at the
same time advocates bringing them in
as prospective American citizens, has
certainly an impossible position to de
fend. In the first place the whole pres
ent and past argument as to moral,
legal or other responsibility is strained
and false, but if the responsibility be
admitted, for the sake of the argument,
or shall be in a greater or less degree
assumed in the future, nevertheless this
irresistible conclusion results: If we
cannot invite them into the family of
States as citizens, and there is certainly
no representative or general sentiment
of the American mind that we can or
should; if we cannot with respect to our
principles of government or with re
gard to our well-being colonize them
and rule them as subjects (and they
must be one or the other, citizens,
present or prospective, or subjects) and
in our former article we discussed the
matter at sufficient length, then there
is and can be but one conclusion:
Sentiment cannot govern, not such a
sentiment at least; it could not govern
if it were well founded and much less
when it is unfounded and false and
hypocritical. The islands must be dis
posed of, must be got rid of, freely
and voluntarily, and for self-govern
ment would best suit the American
mind, but in any event get rid of them.
The protection, the well-being, the lib
erties of this people, the progress, the
advanc-.-nvnt of this one grand and
representative government of democ
racy must not, and in God's providence
we hope will not, be sacrificed in be
half of the pretended interests of a non
consenting, unhomogeneous and alien
race.
We entered this war disclaiming all
greed, all desire fur gain, acquisition or
annexation. We may yet quit with
honor and credit, glory even and re
nown, but equally we may stand con
victed as an Ananias in the beginning
and an Uriah Heep among nations at
the end. It Is easy to tell what to do
with the Philippines before we actually
have them in comparison to being atJle
to tell what to do with them when
once "we have the elephant on our
hands."
I have no great hope that the sug
gestions here made or any suggestions
will satisfy those who have set their
hearts on annexing the Philippines.. "A
man convinced against his will is of the
same opinion still," and some of our
fellow citizens have strongly set their
hearts on decorating our plain demo
cratic apparel with a goodly quantity
of Oriental jewelry. Therefore the
true policy of those opposed to annexa
tion on principle is to show the disad
vantages and injurious effects to this
country and those now favoring annex
ation if once convinced it is wrong and
injurious to us will, answer the ques
tion how not to do it themselves. Hav
ing destroyed the power that governed
or misgoverned the Philippines, we
may assume if we choose to give them
self-government and assist them in that
direction, or in providing some other
kind of government less objectionable
than that we have taken from them.
But thg.t we must hold the.m as colo
nies or territories and prospective
states is only suggested by the wish
fathering the thought. If in necessary
self-defense an American citizen had
killed the brutal husband of one of
those Malay ladies and taken away her
support, such as it was, he might feel,
if unusually high minded, obligated to
make some recompense or provide some
sustenance for her for a reasonable
time: but unless in need of servants or
in the habit of keeping them, would
hardly feel morally obligated to make
her his handmaiden for the rest of her
natural life, and much less to marry
the widow and make her one of his
family. It is rather a nice and deli
cate question, this mixing of races. As
a self-governed and self-governing race
we have no right to colonies or to sub
ject this people to. our domination; as
a self-governing, self-respecting race
we have no right to brin~ into our fam
ily and the sisterhood of States any
people not possessed of the qualities or
characteristics of self-government en
titling them to such a position, present
or prospective.
Remove your eyes from the Orient,

JUDGE BELCHER
ON HIS DECISION
Editors The Call â Gentlemen: Your
paper this morning seems to impute to
me an inadequate discharge of public
duty in the casa of Lane vs. the Board
of Education, in that the injunction
was not made sufficiently broad. Of
course The Call does not wish to do me
an injustice, and of course it is an in
justice to me that the public should be
given to understand that I have not
performed my duty.
It only needs to be stated to one
familiar with the law and the practice
that a suitor in the courts can have no
more than he sues forâ that the meas
ure of relief granted him cannot ex
ceed what he prays for. If it were
otherwise actions in the courts would
not be necessary, but the courts would
proceed of their own motion to do jus
tice as they saw it. We know that the.
courts have no such power. ' Their or
ders and proceedings are and must al
ways be within the lines of the plead
ings of the parties. In the school di
rectors case certain specified relief was
prayed and all of the relief prayed for
was granted.

Editor Call: Will you kindly allow
me to say only a few words through
the columns of your valuable papefr^
There seems to be a great objection tv^f
all whose names have been mentioned
as probable candidates for United
States Senator. The Times of this city
has come out for V. S. Grant of San
Diego, and uses up a column and a half
trying to frame an apology to its read
ers for so doing. It says anybody to
beat Burns, and Grant is the son of hla
father. If Grant has any brains, how
flattered he must feel over such an
apology to the people from a paper for
hoisting his name. Hut, really, I hard
ly think Grant will be considered. He
is a man of no special ability, no promi
nence (only as the son of his father);
he has never done a thine-, said a
word, or in any manner whatsoever
performed an act that entitles him to
even be considered. For God's -ake.
has the State no material in the Re
publican party for Fnitod States Sena

An English
# gentleman, who

*Â£ pleasure and who
w Is a guest at one
<*> of the hotels In
# this city, tells nf-m
$*> some interesting i*
experiences he had when an officer in the
English army in Egypt. It was In con
nection with the fanatic bravery of the
Dervishes, who prefer to die on the field
of battle rather than fall into the hands
of the British and be cared for by their
surgeons, that the Englishman told the
following story:
$ THEY KILL
â¦ THE WOUNDED
JJ DERVISH.
"There Is no kinder man In the British
army than the surgeon, and he is always
anxious to attend all wotmded men. ITo
makes no exceptions, and Is just as eagf r
to tend the wounded Dervish whenever
one is brought in, but no wounded Der
vish is ever brought In to receive his
care. It Is as much as one's life is worth
to go near a wounded Dervish. After
they have been wounded they lie on the
ground glaring about them like wild ani
mals. Approach one and out will come
his curved sword. He will feign death
until you are within reach, when he will
give you a vicious sweep, and if the_blow
reaches you it is more than probable that
you are malned for life if not killed. The
problem of dealing with the wounded
Is a difficult one. In 1855 after a batâ¬a
the English soldiers, commanded by thmr
officers, used to go out and kill tW
wounded Dervishes. One soldier wotjd
prod the body between the shoulders
with a bayonet. Jf there was no move
ment the party went on; if the Dervish
proved to be alive another private in
stantly blew out his brains."

Z-VIGHT LOSES A FEE,
His Wcrk in the Eureka Chinese Riot
Cases Goes for Naught.
Oeorge A. Knight, the lawyer, consid- i
ers that he has been "done" out of a fee
that he is entitled to. It was not a very
large fee, on:y a mere bagatelle of $5000,
hut he hates to lose the case. Many years
ago the citizens of Eureka, Humboldt
City, decided that the city was not large |
enough for them. and the Chinese popula- I
tion to live In at the same time. Two
l'cpular movements were started, one by
the citizens for the Chinese quarter and
the other by the Chinese to get out- of

owners brought suit to recover $132,520
damages.

for $5000 as special counsel, which was not
allowed. He sued the city and- lost. Not

GOOD SCOTCH
SYMPHONY AND
BAD SCOTCH PLAY
The Best Concert of
the Season.
O'NEIL AS MEG MERRIUES
FUTILE EFFORTS IN A BELATED
DRAMATIZATION.
How "Guy Mannering." With Its
Calcium Bathed Gypsy QueÂ«n,
Impressed an Uninitiat
ed Critic.
The value of conducting the sym
phony season on a subscription basis
was happily illustrated by the i
that attended the concert in the Or
pheum yesterday afternoon. It was a
nasty, soaking day and in the middle
of holiday week; on the ordinary pay
as-you-go plan there would not have
been two hundred persons in the house.
But the subscribers turned out In fash
ionable . mob and the afternoon was
one of the smartest of the season. It
was also one of the most artistic. In
fact the programme as a whole was
the best played of the season: and it
was a stunning programme. Men
delssohn was the smallest man in it.
and he was represented by his largest
achievement, the "Scotch" symphony.
All the rest was Wagner and Beeth
oven. The latter to be sure was in only
the overture, the good old "Leonora"
overture number three: but Scheel
played that veteran standby with such
delicate beauty and care that you ac
cepted it in any thing but- a perfunc
tory spirit. Usually the "Leonora" is
a sort of opening ceremony, an accom
paniment to the removal of overshoes,
stacking of umbrellas arid settling of
silk skirts; but this time it was a care
fully attended masterpiece, played with
unimpaired enthusiasm by a leader and
his bandsmen who, every one of them,
know the score backward.
However, It was the "Wagner pieces
that made the deepest dent in the ap
preciation of the crowd and proved the
band to be in a condition of balance and
responsiveness that it had not quite at
tained to in the earlier concerts of the
season. The brass especially was
clearer and better blent with the
strings and reeds; it blew boldly and
with fair tonal integrity, and its pianis
simo was sure and suggestive of re
pressed strength rather than of wob
A PROMINENT JURIST RESIGNS.
Judge Niles Searls Retires From tfie "Supreme. Court
Commission to Private Lite.
JUDGE NILE? SEAKLS, Commissioner of the Supreme Court, has resigned
his position, and from now on he will get all of .the enjoyment he. can out of
U nre. He -will rest and travel wherever fancy takes him. Judge Searls thinks
that after fifty years of labor In the legal profession and on the bench he has j
earned all the- rewards that are supposed to go to the industrious. His resig

Imo .was never ragged and the
â¢ whole interpretation was marked by
stnsative fiancy. ;The "Albumblatt'' I

I the composer is so popularly known as
[a scherzo specialist; but. it was the
adagio, which to my thinking reveals
the noblest ideals of Mendelssohn, that
was the real feat, although the finale,
too, was piayed' with brilliant crash.
â¢ â¢ â¢-
Several times it has been my fortune
to meet late in .life and for the first
j time a play supposed 16 be more or less
a claspie, only to find myself too late
jto appreciate it. Just such an experi-,
ence I had in the California Theater
last night when Nance O'Neil appeared
as. the antiquated Gypsy Queen in the
antiquated play' of "Guy Mann'ering."
! Never having read the particular ro-
I mance- of Walter .Scott's, from which
l this piece is taken, and having no key
' to the plot or purpose of the dramatiza
tion, . I could make neither heads nor
tails of It and. was all at sea as to what
under the sun it might mean. Perhaps
to those familiar with the book this
stage version brings happy souvenirs;
for I observed a number of persons ap
plauding last night's performance; but
to any one who is not familiar, with the
novel and not, therefore, able to read
â between the acts, so to say,. I cannot
for the life of me .see where the fun
comes in. I have seen more plot and
dramatic action in a comic opera than
i were divulged at the. California last
i night, and much more chance for se
j rious acting than was offered Miss
O'Neil and her associate players. The
old Gypsy girl, Meg, who bathes in cal
cium and carri-es a forked stick and for
ever shouts In the incantation' voice,
was not half so impressive as is,' say, the
old miser in the "Bells of Corneville,"
and I could name you a dozen comic
operas whose subsidiary personages
are more lifelike than those in this
play. On the way o-ut I told my trou
bles to my colleague, Peter Robertson,
who was fxtremely sympathetic. He
! said that the present time was out of
i joint with "Guy Mannerjng," and that
! he didn't blame me at all for not pre
tending to enjoy it. As for himselfâ
well, he was a Scotchman and knew. the
story by heart and had grown used to
; the play in the old days of the Cali
i fornia Theater stock company, and he.
i thought Miss O'Neil's make-up was.
very successful. .I, too, thought it suc
cessful, if Intended to frighten women
and children; but I really couldn't see
anything in the part to make the mu
tilation worth Miss O'Neil's while. Cer
tainly it called for no acting, no elo
cutionary skill; it was merely a matter
of make-up and mugging and fake
voicing. I can now understand the
sensations of Max Beerbohm, the dra
matic critic of the Saturday Review,
who recently witnessed a dramatiza
tion of the "Three Guardsmen" with
out having first read the Dumas book
and straightway recommended the
piece to the stellar attention of the
Three Sisters Levy, vaudeville ladies
whose specialties are size and shape. I
can imagine Edwin Stevens or De Wolf
Hopper having lots of fun In this part
of Meg Merrilies, but I think Mlsa
O'Neil is wasting time on it that might
be devoted to valuable experience.

THE PURE FOODS BILL.
Promptly Indorsed by All Big Com-
xnercial and Industrial
Bodies.
TThen the legislators meet next week
in Sacramento they will have presented'
for their consideration a matter in which
the best citizens of .the State and all the
big commercial and Industrial bodies are
Interestedâ namely, the pure foods ques
tion. IÂ«i?t summer when the Pure Foods
Convention met in this city its delegates
were from all parts of California. What
its members desired to accomplish was
discussed and the work of putting mat
ters in shape to be presented to the com
ing Legislature was left to the pure foods
committee of the Producers' .and Manu.
facturers Association. With the assist
ance of Attorney Duntie of the District
Attorney's office a bill has been framed
on the lines indicated by the convention.
The bill provides for the creation of a
pure foods bureau or commission, with
officers and subordinates to see that the
laws are enforced, etc. In the meantime
the same matter was taken .up By the Re
gents of the University of California,
State Horticultural Society, Dairymen's
Association and other bodies. The pure
foods committee of the manufacturers'
organization' soon saw that, the ends
would be defeated if there were too mahy
fingers in the pure foods pie, and they in
vited all of these to join irn a united and
mighty movement to the wished for end.
The invitation was accepted, and yester
day all of t.;e organizations named, and
the Council of Associated Industries, com
posed of the Manufacturers' and Produc
ers' Association, Mechanics' Institute, the
City and State Boards of Trade, Board
of Health and Miners' Association, met
in the Mills building and discussed the
proposed measure. It was indorsed by all
and arrangements will be made for having
copies of It presented to every legislator
in Sacramento. More than that, the coun
cil will send representatives to Sacramet
no to work in the interests of pure foods
and the bill.
INSOLENT BEGGARS.
Judge Conlan Is Determined to Pun-
ish Mendicants as Severely as
the La-w Will Allow.
Two professional beggars, John Mc-
Dowell and James Dunlap, appeared
before Judge Conlan yesterday for sen
tence. As Dunlap Is slowly dying from a
loathsome disease, .the Judge sentenced
him to twenty-four hours in the City
Prison, but humanely ordered that he
should be sent to the City and County
Hospital. McDowell- was sent to the
County Jail for throe months. When Mc-
Dowell heard his sentence ha remarked,
"I'll be dead before I get out," and the
Judge retorted, . "If you are dead you
can't gef out.".
"The city is overrun with beggars,"
continued the Judge, "and they not only
beg for money but use the most disgust

lan's Sentiments.
Mayor Pheian has ordered the stars and
stripes raised over the City Hall on
Sunday next in honor of the evacuation
of Spanish soldiery from the shores of
Cuba. This order was made at the re
quest of the Cuban League, which was
formed in this city before the beginning
of hostilities. It is probable that that or
ganization will conduct appropriate ex
ercises in this city on the same day.
A committee from the league will visit
Superintendent of Streets Ambrose this
morning and ask his permission to use
Union square for the occasion.
At the request of an Eastern paper,
Mayor Phelan expressed the following
sentiments:
The expulsion of Spain from the "Western
hemisphere by the triumph of our arms Is well
worthy of patriotic commemoration, ana I
have ordered the flag raised over our muni
cipal building on evacuation day, January L

MONEY AND BONDS.
GROWING FINANCIAL [MPORTANC9E
OF THE UNITED STATES.
Henry Clews' New York circular says: "The
attempt of foreiÃn nations to place loans her*
is especially significant. Russia's success, how
ever. In her negotiation is somewhat problem
atical, as our people have had little experience
on so Inrge a scale a* proposed in foreign gov
ernment loans; but the fact that Russia has
come to this markt-t is proof nevertheless of the
position we now occupy In the estimation of
the world. New York Is pre-eminently the Em
porium City of the Western Hemisphere, and
always will be to the United States what Lon
don is to Great Britain and Paris to France,
London and New York are now the world's
two Kieateat financial centers and security
markets. That it will not be long; I venture
tii- prediction, before the bonds and stocks of
many toreign nations, .including government
issues, will be actively dealt in at the New
Tork Stock Exchange, thereby making it a
recognized world's market.
"The United States national banks holding
ratlflf Railroad bonds, known as currency Us.
which become due January 1. 1899, and upon
which their circulation and Government de
posits are based, should at once take other se
curities for reinvestment, as the amount ma
turing 1512,513 560), of which the banks hold
laierly . will cause a heavy demand for United
States 1 Government bonds, and. with prices
now strongly advancing for the best class, the
need for action is Imperative. The present con
dition of affairs has very encouraging features.
ThiÂ« country is the world's creditor, and the
l ars ,. balances to be paid in must be Invested
here giving strong support to the bond mar
ket Universal confidence in Increasing pros
perity is drawing vast sums from idle deposits
into active and profitable channels of trade,
which will give better employment for the
banks' funds. "The expansion of the country
will call for enormous capital in new commer
cial enterprises, quickening the exchanges and
broadening the possibilities of the banks, and,
judging from the rlcht settlement of every
nnanclal question thus far, the coming subject
of currency reform and the future of the bank
ing system will receive wise and liberal legisla
tion. ' The United States bonds now In the mar
ket are: Continued 2s ai 99Â®99%, at option of
Government: 4s of 1807 at 111%, yield fi M in
terest as eight and a half years' Investment; Is
of r.<25 at 12 1 *!... yield }2 50 interest as twenty
six years' Investment; us of 1904 at 112%, yield
$2 30 as five years' investment: 3* ot 190S-1S at
IQ6U yield 82 30 Interest as ten years' Invest
ment; 3s of 1908 â  at 107.53, yield 12 50 Interest
a-Â« twenty years' Investment.
"The continued 2s are the least desirable, as
they yield less than average interest, and are
payable only at the Government's option Indefi
nitely at par, which holds them In a narrow
market below par. The occurrences of the year
have made at times quick and large declines in
bonds of high premium, and' the new United
states C-- JirÂ« most In demand at present, as
costing ti-.e least and having certainly ten
years'. poFsihly twenty years', duration.
"The recent advance in wheat and the 10-cent
higher price of corn at the present time over
the corresponding date of last year is a strong
bull argument tor the stock market. High
prices for cereals make capitalists In the West,
while low prices tor them make Populists la
â tead."

NEW TORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Dec X Aftef an early perl 1
of hesitancy and Irregularity stocks to-day re
sumed their upward movement. In some stocks
the advance was large, while in standard
shares It wan confined to fractions. The trad
big was board and th>-re were few la^sards in
the advance. Although Lor3on was v moderate
buyer on ba!ar.'eÂ«, there was a disposition in
the early irwding in that quarter to be \^ry
cautious after the decline here yesterday. The
tendency in the hunie market was downward.
sympathetically with the foreign prices. The
grangers and Pacifies were off fractionally,
and professional traders worked for a reaction,
but found few vulnerable spots. a-Â« all offer
ings were absorbed by commission house scale
orders.
Sugar was marked up on the shorts, who had
put out their lines because of the disturbing
factors In the trade situation. The recupera
tion if the market spread from one group to
another, and the rates for money, which had
advanced Slightly, gradually eased off with a
plentiful supply to a very low figure. The
grangers rallied a point or more from the low
figures, and teller! of yesterday were puchas
ers to-day of Central Pacific, which advanced
over 3 per cent, and the other Pacifies im
proved In a lesser degree. New York Air Brake
mad* an extreme rise of 9Â»Â£. The closing was

concessions from the bent in others.

been too fast. . May opened HijUc . lower at

After advancing to 70% c the market' broke to
89%@70c. For an hour the market kept within
about %c. of that price, with- trading much
narrower than of late. ', Then .evidences of re

here and heavy clearings started buying, which
carried the price back to 709* c. During the
latter part â¢of â¢, the , session there- was a good
deal of selling to clone accounts over the
holidays, and although. buying In -general was
very steady, there was enough liquidation to
give the market .'a rather weak' appearance
during the last half hour's trading. May-de
clined to 70Uc and closed at .that price. ' â¢

Track Nrtes.
James Garland, the well known trainer, is
seriously 111 at his home in Oakland with
pneumonia.
Highland Ball, winner of the last race, was
b osted J3OO over his entered selling price by
U A. Ix>fk. The stable retained the colt.
I'li.uloy Thorpe and "Skeets" Martin divided
the saddle honors, each piloting two winners.
"Hketis" was also second on two occasions.
Campus, owntd by H. J. Jones, father of the
rider, was one of the many good things un
corked In the opening scramble. The colt ran
flatteringly to the stretch and then flatteced
out.
Dave Fountain, the Idaho horseman, owner
of Juva,, I Don't Know and others, will have
to put up a competent rider if he expects to
win races in this section of the country.
Mounce had- the leg up on Juva in the first
event and sat astride I Don't Know in .the last
field, anil In each instance the clock was strik- ;
ing twelve when Mounce and his mount started
for the wire. â¢ â  :
"VlcksburÃ" * Woods, formerly betting com- i
missioner for the firm of .Burns & Waterhouse, i
is now In- the â custody of the Emeryville police
authorities. Woods, it is alleged, has lately j
made it a custom of betting "'markers" on |
different horses and obtaining money, claiming
to be acting, as the agent of Thomas H. Will
lam* Jr. "ViclcsbUrg" has many friends about
the track, and' it is to be hoped he can prove
the charges to be groundless ones.

General Hart Sued.
Arthur G. Flak, administrator of the
estats of the late Asa Fisk, the money
lender, has filed suit against General W.
H. H. Hart to recover $448 IT, which he
alleges is due upon a promissory note
! December 10, 1^36. He also asks
that Interest be compounded at the rate
of 3 per cent per month.
Not in Theatricals.
S. H. Friedlander denies that he has any
theatrical ventures up his sleeve. He says
the story circulated that he was again to
assume control of San Francisco play
houses is without any foundation. He is
at a loss to understand its origin.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 30, 1898.
TWO WORKMEN CRUSHED
UNDER TONS OF EARTH
FATAL ACCIDENT IN AN OPEN AND
UNBRACED SEWER CUT.
Wfocre tt)e Bodies of Reilly and Ncalon Were TaK^O From the Cut.
TWO laboring men, John Nealon and
John ReJlly, had their lives crushed
out yesterday afternoon while
working in a ditch on Filbert street,
between Broderick â  and Baker. John
Lowney, a third laborer, narrowly es
caped death.
The ditch was being dug by the San
Francisco Paving Company for the new
sewer on Filbert street. It is through
soil of varied formation, chiefly sand and
clay mixed, with brown shale and a lit
tle soapstone. The section where the ac
cident occurred was three feet wide and
varied from six to twelve feet in depth.
The walls looked solid and no braces were
used.
Just what caused the accident nobody
seems to know. Shortly after 2 o'clock
yesterday afternoon a little shower of
rain carrie up and this probably loosened
the walls, for at about 2:30 the sides of
the ditch suddenly came together with a
rumble and crash. Fortunately there were
but three working in that part of the
trench. Two of them. Rellly and Nealon,
were buried up to the neck and Lowney
up to the armpits.
Lowney and Nealon called out lustily
for help, but Reilly was already uncon
scious. Nealon was dug out first and
ARREST OF A
MAN WANTED
IN TACOMA
P. J. Flynn Is Locked
Up in the Tanks.
SHORT IN HIS ACCOUNTS
ACCUSED OF HAVING EMBEZ
ZLED a large amount.
Recognized by Detective Reynolds
on Market Street He Is Taken
Into Custody â Denies
His Guilt.
Locked in the tanks of the City Prison
Is P. J. Flynn, a well dressed young man,
who Is wanted in Tacoma for embezzle
ment, tie was arrested yesterday after
noon while walking along Market street.
Several days ago Chief Lees received a
dispatch from the police of Tacoma ask
ing him to be on the lookout for Flynn,
as he was wanted on a serious charge.
Detective Reynolds was detailed on the
case, and, after considerable trouble, he
located Flynn in a lodging-house on Mar
ket.street. Reynolds visited hla room, hut
failed to find him. About an hour later
he was seen walking along Market street
and was placed under arrest.
When taken into custody Flynn ecemed
surprised and demanded to know why he
had been arrested. The detective took
him to police neadquarters, where he was
closely questioned â¢by Captain Bohen.
Flynn denied that he was guilty of the
crime charged against him. Despite his
entreaties he was escorted to the City
Prison and Chl^f Reed of Tacoma Im
mediately notified of hla arrest. He re
plied that an officer would start from
the north to-day to bring Flynn back.
Last night the following dispatch con
cerning Flynn'a alleged crime was re
ceived here:
TACOMA, Wash.. Dec. 29.â P. J. Flynn,
arrested in San Francisco to-night, is
wanted for alleged embezzlement. For
some time past he has been selling pianos
In Walla Walla and Whitman counties
for D. S. Johnston, wholesale piano
dealer of Tacoma and Spokane. It is
claimed that Flynn has nut accounted for
all his collections and' Is short something
like $1000. Chief of Police Reed was in
terested In the case over a week ago.
He corresponded with the Prosecuting
Attorney of Walla Walla County, who de
clined to swear out a warrant. Mr. John
ston was ready to swear out a warrant
here, but learned that a formal charge
must be filed In Wana Walla County. Hla
Spokane agent was accordingly sent to
Walla Walla to swear to a complaint.
Chief Reed in the meantime located
Flynn in Portland and had him shadowed
there for several days. He concluded that
Flynn had gone by rail to ban Francisco,
and was there arrested on advices frnm
Portland. He thinks Flynn will be taken
to Walla Walla for trial.

A Bogus Card.
Some clever individual has been making
use of the name of the Palace Hotel on
his card for the purpose of peddling toilet
i taken to the Receiving: Hospital, where it ;
was found that he had sustained a contu
sion of the right side and a possible frac
ture of the ribs.
After releasing Nealon the other work
'â  men set to work lustily with picks and
shovels to rescue the other unfortunates.
; but it was too late. Both had died in less
p than five minutes after the crash, the
life being crushed out of their bodies.
Officers Creegan. Kissane and Wilson of
1 the North End Station arrived soon after
the accident and telephoned to the
Morgue. The sight of the black wagon
, standing on the side of the hill drew the
usual crowd of morbid euriosity-Reekers,
; who were eagerly craning their necks
into the pit to catch a sight of the unfor
i tunate men.
The work of recovering the bodies was
slow. They stood face to face in a half
j stooping posture with the shovels still
! grasped in their cold hands. The ground
was hard an:l wet and but two men could
work at a time, and these, fearful of the
fate of their fellows whose doad bodies
they brushed against at every move.
worked slowly and cautiously. Ami all
I the time there was one pitiful sight. X>a
i lon's brother was working on the same
; job. \\ hen he heard what had happened he
: walked away from the scene and leaned
! up against the side of a building a hun
i dred yards away. All the time the work
was going on he stood in the one spot, a
articles. The man has his cards engraved |
"M. J. O'Rouko," and is supposedly occu
pying room 240. The management" of the !
hotel has been unable to ascertain if this
man has be^n victimizing- the public, but j
no such person is staying at the Palace.
One of the cards came into the possession '
of Assistant Manager Warren yesterday,
and he is using every effort to find out
who O'Rouke is.
THE EIGHT MAN FOR REFEREE
The National Club Made a Good Se
lection in Jack Kitchen.
The betting yesterday on the Creedon
and Green fight, which will be decided
this evening at Woodward's Pavilion,
favored Green slightly, although Creedon
had good supporters, who will Bhow their
coin when the odds, as they expect, will
favor Green.
The selection of Jack Kitchen, tha
clever boxer of the Reliance Club of Oak
land, as referee of the bout is an evi
dence that the National Club has arrived
at the wise conclusion that to be a good
referee v man must he honest and have
a thorough knowledge of Queensberry
rules, which very few of the alleged
present day referees possess. Kitchen
is a first-class referee, and, regardless of
what the gods in the gallery may think,
he will decide the contest on points made
up of stopping, clean hitting, side step
ping, ducking, etc. The Marquis of
Queensberry, when he decided upon a
twenty-four foot ring, took into consid
eration that a clever man could in such
a ring avoid an awkward and powerful
rusher by clever footwork and good gen
eralship.
If the Marquis intended that boxers
should make a stand-up fight and slog
away at each other regardless of the fine
points of the game he certainly would
have decided upon a twenty-four inch
ring for sloggers and stand-up fighters
only.
The preliminary to the evVnt of the
evening should be very interesting. The
boxers will come on at S o'clock sharp, as
the club has decided not to keep its
patrons until midnight waiting for the
linish of the entertainment.

belongings and started horne â alone.
At naif-past 4, just two hours after the
accident, the worktngmen reverently
raised their hats and the body of John
Nealon was taken from the pit and placed
in a receiver. Twenty minutes later
Reiliy's body was recovered and the
wagon went away bearing the two sons
of toll from their last day's work.
Nealon was 31 years of age and leaves
a widow and one child, a girl about a
year old. He lived at 1357 Mission street.
Reilly was but 19 years of age. He ar
rived from Ireland about six months ago
and has been living with his brother, at
Howard and Tenth streets. He was un
married.
No one seems able to give a good expla
nation of the <-au6e of the accident. The
men working on the job refer all ques
tioners to the foreman, and he stoutly
. avers that he knows nothing about it.

'as the work progressed. It was mostly

Dougald, C. Hussey and C. W. Doyle, was
appointed a few weeks ago to consider
the matter, and it decided to hold a ball
in Scottish Hall on January 28. Members
of the committee are visiting the various
organizations, and much interest in the
coming affair has been awakened.

A SENSATION
SPOILED BY
LONG DELAY
Hellar's Contest Was
Filed Too Late.
ROGERS IS DISAPPOINTED
HE WOULD LIKE TO TELL HIS
STORY UNDER OATH.
Heilar Said to Be Merely a Nominal
Contestant in the Hands
of His Vindictive
Friends.
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,
Broadway, Dec. 29.
Pam Hellar's eleci â¢ . â¢ ontest has been
thrown out of court by Judge Ogden on
the ground thai It was not tiled within
the forty-daj limit required by law.
When the petition of Hellar for a cita
tion to issue against Rogers was brought
up. his attorneys at once declared that
the law is very â¢peciflc in regard to the
lime within which election contests must
l - Bled. Attorney Lin Church declared
that ihe election returns were filed No
vember 14. and forty days from that date
would be December 24. The action was
not commenced until December 'Si. No
other argument was made by Rogers'
attorneys.
Attorney Sawyer, representing Hellar,
stated that the time limit clause In the
!;iw U i roint, as the law did not
spedflcajo designate when the election
returns were received, lie argued that
the pr< sent contest is pliunl} within the
jurlsdk tlon of the court. .
.ludf Ogden did not agree with Hellar s
attorn. aid that the last day re
quire.! by law tor the presentation uf the
ion returns was November 14. He
the case >>f ('nrlson vs. Hurke, which
boars directly upon the matter. He con
cluded bj saying that as the action was
brought three days too late it was need
;or the court to Bx â  date for its
..â¢ application would be
denied. Hollar's attorneys were permit
ted to record an exception.
Sheriff-elect Rogers says that if It were
I >t a useless proceeding entirely he would
like th.- mattt-r to be heard in court, for it
would give him an opportunity to tell
under oath his side of the interesting
story. Rogers declares that the whole
thing is a conspiracy engineereii by some
Hellar and says that "Sam"
la merely being ased as an instrument in
others' hands to try to throw mud upon
his (Rogers'! political career.
Rogers is positive that h*' did not make
n single promise before his election, and
declares that neither Dr. Derrick nor any
other of Hellar's friends can show proof
to the contrary.
Rogers' attorneys are considerably
amused at the peculiar confession madf
by H.'llar in his action. Hellar admits
that he was a party to the same alleged
illegal transaction for which he seeks to
havo Mr. Rogers punished, and that he Is
therefore liable to conviction for felony.
If the facts to which he confesses couid
be proved by evidence other than his own.
Mr. Hellar ha* been talking for some
weeks about his grievance and the opin
ion has been expressed that it was not
altogether accidental that he filed his ap
plication too late for it to be heard, and
that the purpose was more to cast an as
persion on Rogers than to promote the
cause of Justice and purity of elections.
XIRCHOFER'S TROUBLES.
Does Not Want His Wife to Secure a
Divorce.
OAKLAND, Dec. 29.â 1n the divorce i
suit of Christina Kirchofer of Alameda |
against Gustav Klrchofer, defendant this !
afternoon filed an answer denying the al
legations of desertion and failure to pro
vide. Mr. Klrchofer does not propose to
allow bis wife to secure a decree without
a bitter contest. The parties have been
married about two yearn and have a child
aged nine months. They formerly re
sided in Mendo< Ino County, where they
own a homestead, but according to Mr.
Klrchofer' statement country life proved
too dull and uninteresting for the wife
and she induced him to locate in Ala
in <?da.
Then the trouble began. The little
money saved on the Mendocino property
coon vanished, and it became necessary
for the husband to seek employment else
where. He went to Los Angeles, re
maining there four months, but without
securing work. He alleges that he is
still in pursuit of employment and that
he has registered letter receipts showing
tint he frequently vent home money, al
though recently the court allowed plain
tiff $1.". monthly for her support.

About r\ year :iro Mrs. Aebi sued for

SNOW WOULD
REALLY LIKE
TO BE MAYOR
Modestly Waiting to
Be Asked.
THE LEAGUE MAY NAME HIM
PROSPECT OF THEBE BEING TOO
MANY REFORMERS.
Tlie Republicans Have Not Definitely
Decided Whether They Will
Hold Primaries or Ap
point Delegates.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Dec. 29.
Auditor Snow is modest. His modesty
for eight years has been the means of his
election and re-election as City Assessor.
Mr. Snow, it is said, has never sought an
office, but fate has been good and the of
! flee has gone to him.
Auditor Snow has long been recognized
as one of the logical candidates for
Mayor. Two years ago he could have had
the nomination at the hands of the Re
publican delegates by asking for it. But
his modesty forbade him. Mr. Snow was
asked to-day what he thought of him-
I sell' as a candidate for Mayor and he re
i piled:
"If the citizens of Oakland were adver
tising for a general manager 1 would not
I hesitate to apply for the place. The office
of Mayor Is, unfortunately for the tax
1 payers, quite another thing. If. however,
; the citizens of Oakland want me to serve
them In any capacity and will say so ;
â  with a fair degree of unanimity 1 will I
' serve them,"
The Municipal League is now taking the i
1 preliminary steps toward calling its con
; vention. None of the delegates are yet {
1 known, but its candidate for Mayor will
i be> either John F. Towle or R. W. Snow, i
with Giles H. Gray and Fred V. Wood as !
j possibilities.
It is probable that in nearly all the
i wards there will be little gatherings of
citizens of every political creed to decide
! on their candidates for Counci linen. The j
1 Fifth Ward has set the example by agTee-
Ing upon Frank M. ParceUs. who was the !
j Republican nominee two years ago. and
who was beaten through the action of!
: another Republican. *vho ran lndepend- \
ently and .split the party vote.
This method of obtaining candidates is !
similar to that followed by the Municipal j
League in principle, and unless the league
shall indorse candidates sn chosen it is
: possible that there may two "reform" ;
, candidates where one would be safer ;uid
more acceptable.
So far none of the regular parties have :
, done anything, but assert that they are
thinking the matter over. The Republi
can City Central Committee will meet
next week, and it is possslble that the
members will decide as to whether the
convention shall be called by primaries ;
1 or by the appointment of delegates'.
Street Superintendent Miller, as fore
, cast in The (Tall last week, has announc
! Ed himself as being positively out for the
; nomination of City Engineer. It is very
probable that he will be thÂ« candidate of
the Municipal League as Mr. Dow cer- j
talnly will be for City Attorney. Candi- ;
dates are cropping up in all directions, i
many of them being unable to shake off '
the habit of having themselves mentioned
1 for any old thing every time an election j
i approaches.
MRS. BRANDES HELD.
Must Stand Trial for the Murder of
Her Daughter Lillian.
OAKLAND, Deo. 29. â Mrs. Etta
Brandes was held to answer to-day for
the murder of her stepdaughter, Lillian.
The proceedings only lasted a few min
utes. Justice Olift agreed with the Dis
trict Attorney that no argument was
necessary on behalf of the State, and as
the defense does not intend to put in any!
testimony until the case comes to trial
thf woman was held to answer.
Her attorneys conferred with the Dis
trict Attorney about trying Mrs. Brandes
lirst. The State refused to do this, and
Brandes' attorney asked for a copy of
the court records that they might bring
habeas corpus proceedings in the Supe
rior Court.
Mrs. Brandes will be arraigned next
Wednesday morning.
Report on Schools.
OAKLAND. Dec. 29.â J. N. MeClym
onds. City Superintendent of Schools, has
presented his annual report to the School
Directors. It contains the report of
Professor Burckhalter on the expedition
to India, and deals largely with -the sub
ject of native study and the qualifica
tions of teacher?. Regarding the latter
subject it says, referring to Professor
Elmer E. Brown:
"If you are to seek for the best you will
not confine yourself to the city of Oak
land alone." This recommendation would
interfere somewhat with local pride, but
we are to keep in mind that the -chooLs
of Oakland are being conducted for the
children of Oakland alone. This being t ha
fact, the children are entitled to the best
teachers that can be found. Irrespective
of residence or the school of preparation."

"I USED TO GO AND
HELP KICK, TOO"
Young Brandes Finally Tells of the Brutality
of His Parents and How They Used to
Treat His Sister.
T"*\ERKELEY, Dec. 29,â Aside from the bruises which literally covered
[â J the body of the unfortunate Lillian Brandes at the time of her death.
I 1 more evidence has come to light which goes to show that the report!
â *"* of Brandes' cruelty have not been exaggerated. The testimony in
question is from Milton Frandes, the â¢ ten-year-old son of the man and
â woman who are now in the Oakland County Jail, held on the charge of
murder.
At the time of his father's arrest the boy would say nothing about the
treatment his sister Lillian had received in her parents' home at Berkeley.
He seemed to show little concern in the awful tragedy which had taken
one of the members of the household, and professed ignorance of any of
the circumstances connti-ted with the case. He appeared quite Indifferent
to the events which brand his parents' names with infamy, and showed no
signs whatever of regret or sorrow for the tragic end of his sister's* life.
People Interested in the affair thought at first that Brandes had prob
ably frightened the child into silence, and that possibly he could be in
duced to divulge details later. But their efforts bo far have failed, as all
attempts to draw from him any of the incidents connected with the last
days of Lillian's life have met with failure.
Within the last two or three days, however, this silence has been
broken, and the boy has been talking about the' matter to Brandes'
neighbors freely, and in a way which, shows that his home life was well
fitting him to be the son of his father.
He is now telling people in a bragging way of how Brandes used to
abuse unfortunate Lillian, and his story conforms exactly with the opinion
now freely held us to the brutal cruelty which the young girl endured. He
even boasts, in a boyish way, that he used to help In the abuse.
The most direct testimony thus far given is his answer to a question
from one of the neighbors asking if he. ever saw his father thrash the girl.
"Why, yes," he said, "father and mother used to kick her all over the
house, and I used to go and help kick, too."
DR. GRAIF SURPRISES
HIS CONGREGATION
WILL LEAVE IN ANSWER TO
AN EASTERN CALL,
Given Three Months' Leave of Ab
sence, but Is Not Expected to
Come Back.
Oakland Office San Francisco Cal
908 Broadway, Dec. 29.
Dr. Philip Graif, pastor of the First
Free Baptist Church, created a surprise
a tthe annual meeting of his congregation
last night by asking for three months'
leave of absence, which. It is understood,
Is equivalent to handing in his. resigna
tion.
A few days ago Dr. Graif received a call
to : the First Free Baptist Church of Lew
iston, Maine. This rhurch is allied with
Bates College, the leading institution of
the church in this country, and tho ap
pointment is considered to be one of the
best in the Free Baptist faith. A ftw
months ago Dr. Graif was honored with
a degree from his college, which has been
followed up by sending for him to preside
over the allied church.
The pastor's request was granted and in
an Interview to-day he stated that he
would undoubtedly accept the call and
that as soon as he had visited his new
charge he would at once formally resign
from his local pastorate.

NEW MOVE IN LOCAL ADVERTISING
EDGAR JOHN ARNOLD.
Specially engaged for seasons IR9B-1599-1900 ns advertising manaper for Hale's
Â«>ven Californlan stores, on and after January 1, 1899. will a)so take charge of the
mall order department of Hale'a large stores In this city. This 1b tn the. further
line of promotion which has come so rapidly to Mr. Arnold during the pa*t five
years. He was for some time connected with the advertising department of
The Call, and for one year was advertising manager for Goldberg. Bowen & Co.,
the largest grocery house west of Chicago, and left them to engage In the gen-
eral advertising field.' His work brought him prominently Into public notice, and
several offers were made, but Hale's In March, 189$, secured his services for
their Callfornian stores,- and. the. latest move Is that he will undoubtedly issue
the most attractive mall order matter, and as the mall order trade is naturally the
result of newspaper publicity, it Is to be expected Mr. Arnold will prove more
valuable in his dua.l capacity. Hale's are the largeat dry goods advertisers on
â¢ the Pacific Coast, and probably conduct' the largest mall order business. Firm
and parsistent believers in and users of advertising, their success has been one
of the great .features of Pacific Coast retailing. The present move in the mall
order department Is In line with the progressive policy of this firm.
a difference in the figures of over $1200.
Monday of this week Mrs. A. B. An
drews, sister of the woman, received a
letter from her mailed in Humboldt
County. Mrs. Andrews is watching at
the bedside of Mr. Smith and could not
be seen, but other relatives stated that
Mrs. Holden expressed regret for- what
she had done. This is the first direct
communication received from the woman.
Thomas. A. Smith, who is now sick unto
death, was a firm friend of the woman,
and her queer actions and the fact that
she had been unfaithful to her trust vis
ibly affected him. His friends state that
the affair hastened his present Illness.
â¢ Mrs. Holden's relatives will strive to
prevail upon her to return to Alameda.
At present, they refuse to disclose her ad

Prospects of Friction Among Chil-
dren of the Deceased.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 29.â There is a pros
pect of friction among the children of the
latu Mrs. Susan Barlow over the disposi
tion of her estate. She left property val
ued at about 110,000, consisting of the
Loyal Oak Hotel and furniture. The de
ceased made a will in 1596. naming her
son. Albert Barlow, and daughter. Mary
Wallace, executor and executrix. In this
document she devised her estate to her
four children, share and ?hare alike.
Subsequently she sought to avoid the
expense of probate proceedings by exe
cuting deeds to the property. The deeds
were placed in the hands of Thomas A.
Smith, but a few weeks before Mrs. Bar
low's last Illness she recalled them and
made a codicil to her will In which she
revoked the nomination of her son as ex
ecutor, bequeathed her piano to her
daughter. Mrs. Wallace, besides giving
her the free use of the hotel and furniture
during the period the estate is in probate.
It Is over this latter clause that the
heirs ore clashing. Mrs. Wallace Is per
fectly satisfied with its provisions, but
her brothers, and sisters do not take to It
kindly. They insist that the deeds to the
property were not destroyed, but are
still In existence, and that they take
precedence over the will. They will not
consent to the probating of the will until
a thorough search has been made for
the deeds.

BARCLAY WAS
BETRAYED AND
BY A WOMAN
Sequel to the Palo Alto
Bank Robbery.
HE TOLD HER OF HIS CRIME
SHE INFORMED THE POLICE OF
HIS WHEREABOUTS.
The Police Said to Have located
Minckler, the Telegraph Oper
ator, at Dunsmuir, Where
He Is Under Arreet.
B. H. Barclay, otherwise known as
Harry L. Cator, the young man who was
arrested Wednesday night for obtaining
$840 from the Palo Alto bank on a forged
telegram, was betrayed by a woman.
Barclay and another man named Mi.nckler
conceived the bold scheme of sending a
bogus dispatch to the bank, instructing
the cashier to pay Cator the amount stat
ed in the dispatch. Cator got the money, at
once left Palo Alto and came to this city,
arriving here late Tuesday night. With
his ill-gotten gains he visited the tender
loin and proceeded to have a good time.
After visiting several saloons and or
dering champagne he met a woman who
is known to the police as "Moonlight
Mattle." At his invitation she accom
panied him to a restaurant on Stockton
street, where they had supper. He flashed
the money he had received on the bogus
telegram and gave her $20 to buy a pres
ent for herself. After leaving the restau
rant they went to other places and finally
brought up in a lodging-hove on Bush
street and Grant avenue. During his con
versation with the woman he told her of
his crime and asked her how he could
leave the city without the police getting
on to him. She listened to his story, and,
after getting all the details, excused her
self on the pretext that she wanted to see
a sick friend and would return imme
diately.
After leaving him she went to the near
est telephone and rang up Lieutenant
Blrdsall at the Cenfral police station.
She told him all the particulars of Bar
clay's crime and gave him the number of
the room where he was asleep. Birdsail
lost r , time in notifying Chief Lees, who
at o- c ordered the lieutenant to send one
of his trusted men to arrest Barclay. He
was found in the room described by the
woman and placed under arrest. He at
first denied that he was the man who was
wanted, but finally admitted his guilt.
He said that after reaching this city he
bought a diamond ring for $225, and think
ing he might be robbed he gave $500 to
the landlord of the house with instruc
tions to keep it until he called for it. He
was very much astonished at the action
of the woman and threatened to get even
with her at the first opportunity.
It is understood that she will be called
as a witness for the prosecution when the
case against him is heard.
It was reported yesterday that Minck
ler, the telegrph operator, had been lo
cated at Dunsmuir, where he was arrested
and an officer had gone there to bring him
back to Palo Alto.
SA-N JOSE. Dec. 29.â Ha1l Barclay,

PIE-CRUSTED
PROMISES OF
A POLITICIAN
Martin's Days Are
Full of Deep Woe.
fIOT NEARLY ENOUGH PLACES
TRENCH DINNERS AND GALLIC
LANGUAGE AT THE JAIL.
Novel Condition of Affairs When the
New Sheriff Gets His Bastile
Into Smooth Working
Order.
riff-'Mect Martin, the prize fat boy
of S;m Francisco, has got himself into all
kinds of trouble with a horde of would-be
deputies, and has brought about a con
dition of affairs between himself and
Kelly and Crimmins bordering on an open
outbreak.
The trouble is all due to Mr. Martin's
penchant for milking promises. It may
be Inferred from this that Martin is a
promising individual; may bo he is, but
the outlook is not very promising for Mar
tin.
Martin has forty-eight positions in his I
office to parcel out, but it is asserted!
that 44S would not be enough to make [
good all his pledges. There was a small j
army of patriots booming Mr. Martin !
along during the campaign, and not one
of them was carrying a torch and ped
dling Martin's cards for his health. More
over. Messrs. Kelly and Crimmins have a !
few friends of their own to take Vare of, j
and they feel that they are entitled to !
some recognition at Martin's hands in the
matter of appointments. They figure tnai.
thirty-six would be about the proper num
ber of positions for them to till, leaving
twelve for the solid man to wedge his
friends into.
A delicate situation for a heavy-weight
to be placed in surely.
Now. Mr. Martin has his own ideas
about the management of the County Jail
and branches. If it lies in his power the-
Gallic tongue shall be the official court
language of his deputies, and every
Frenchman in town, it i? said, has been
promised a position by him. Whether he
has arranged to employ a French teacher
for the inmates and will furnish them
with French grammars has not been an
nounced. However the inmates are more j
interested in knowing whether Martin is
going to serve French dinners daily to j
them. It looks like it, for he has already ;
selected Marchpbout, the Montgomery
avenue furniture dealer, as commissary.
But just a 1 present the great strife be
tween Martin and Crimmins is whether
Edgar Peixotto or Tom Rlordan shall be
the Sheriff's attorney. Martin promised
the position to Peixotto long ago; In fact,
it was with the understanding that he
should have the place that Jerome Deasy
and James Wrenn took hold of Martin's
fight. Peixotto will get it and it will be
his reward for defending Widber.
But Crimmins and Kelly say that Rior
dan is entitled to the position because
of his work in the campaign as chairman
of the County Committee, and that he
shall have it or something will happen.
And there you are.
Deasy and Wrenn have been promised
? laces by Martin, and Deasy is to put a
riend in; but they see the best jobs going
to others, and the horde of clamorous
Frenchmen undiminished. So it is not to
be wondered at that they anxiously ask
where they "get on."
Dave Martin will be Under Sheriff by
the grace of Martin himself. That posi
tion was expected by Jack Gleason, for j
he more than all others has stood by Mar- :
tin. Gleason spent his money for the fat
boy, and gets "dumped" for his pains.
However, he will fare just as well, for
he is to have charge of the criminal de
partment of the County Clerk's office.
'"Billy" Â±>lattner, Crimmins' selection, will
be chief outside man. Harrison House
worth has been slated by Martin for book
keeper. Crimmins has secured for Tom
Ford the position of chief jailer, and that
and outside deputy seems to be about all
he gets, for Martin has turned down Tom
Meagher and Kincaid. whom he had
promised should be in charge of branches
2 and 3 respectively, and Joseph Windrow
and James Gateb" are to have the places.
William Daly and Ben Jones fe^l reason
ably sure that Martin will keep his prom
ise and make them deputies.
Tom Cunningham of North Beach. Mar
tin's rent collector, is booked for bailiff
of .Judge Seawell's court, and Louis
Cooper will also be made a bailiff of some
court.
The Democrats will be well cared for by
Martin. Ned Lanlgan has been given
two places to fill, while Healy Davis and
Charles Hay den, both of whom are under
"U'helan, 'will remain where they are.
Leon Velller. now cared for by the Dem
ocratic Board <>f Supervisors, will have
a place, and so will Antone Schoembs, .
Martin's fnvorite barkeeper, despite the
fact that five clubs in his ward have pro
tested on the ground that he is a Demo
crat. William Lawdcn, who came from
Santa C'tuz a year ago and distinguished
himself in the last campaign by knifing
the Republican candidate for the Assem
bly In the Forty-fourth District, will be
cared for. as will Jennings Philips, one of
the delegates to Buckley's convention
two years ago.
The remaining places are likely to go
to the French colony. Raphael Weill
will name one deputy, although the
merchant has never been known to wear
himself out in the political arena; and
there are others, so that when Martin's
force finally lines up many of the old
stagers will be found to have given way
to a brand new lot of deputies.
There are some who say that all thl9
row is merely a bunko game; that Mar
tin is trying to evade some of his obli
gations by saying that Crimmins has
tnken upon himself ti.e appointment of
all his deputies, and when the disappoint-,
ed office-seeker turns to Crimmins he is
told that Martin has thrown Crimmins
down hard and will not let him have any
thing.
Blackmail Fails to Appear.
Cassius EL Blackman, the policeman ac
cused of stealing $ISO from Cornelius Cro
nln of Nevada, apnin failed to appear in
Judge Mogan's court when his name was
called yesterday morning and the Judge
continued the case till January 3 at th.'
request of the prosecution. Blackman has
apparently left the city and his bonds
are worthless. The police ascertained
yesterday that Saloon-keeper Rood, his
co-defendant and surety, had sold out

FROM BIRTH
Our little daughter had Eczema from birth;
The parts afflicted -would become terribly In-
flamed, and water would ooze out like great
beads of perspiration, finally this would dry
up and the skin would crack and peel off. Sue
Buffered terribly. Had to put soft mittens on
her hands to keep her from scratching. Two
of our leading physicians did not help' her.
After bathing her with Ccticlra Soap, I
applied Cuticuha (ointment) freely, and gave
her Cuncuiu. Resolvent regularly. She im-
proved at once and is now never troubled. The
statements I have made are absolutely true
and not exaggerated in any way.

CALIFORNIA TROOPS.
Captain Herbert Choynski Resigns.
A Tribute to the Late Cap
tain Richter.
Captain Herbert Choynski, California
Heavy Artillery, United States Volun
teers, stationed at Fort Baker, has re
signed from the service of the United
States. He assigns as a reason for his res
ignation the fact that there is no Imme
diate prospect of active duty at the front.
He sets forth also that his law business
requires his attention, as it has been neg
lected for a long time.
Captain Choynski's resignation would |
have been sent In some weeks ago If I
I sensational rumors had not been clrcu- |
! lated regarding the discipline of his com
1 mand. The men made complaint against
I the officers, and the result was an inves
tigation of the complaints by Lieutenant
Bennett, U. S. A., of General Merriam's I
staff. It Is said that Lieutenant Bennett j
found nothing to sustain the statements
of he men who made charges against the
officers of the- battery.
Colonel R. L. Peeler, assistant adjutant
general of California, has been promoted
I to the rank of brigadier general and as
, signed to duty as adjutant general to BUC
| ceed General A. W. Barrett, who was re
i cently appointed Bank Commissioner. Or
ders recently issued by the comander-in
chlef, Governor Budd, announce the pro
motion of Colonel Peeler.
The commander-in-chief also announces
officially the appointment of Walter S.
Martin as lieutenant colonel and A. D. C
Colonel Martin was ordered to report' to
Brigadier General Charles King, U. 8. \ Â
commanding the Second Brigade of Phil
ippine expeditionary forces. In obedience
to orders Colonel Martin accompanied the
i expedition to Manila and subsequently
1 transmitted to the adjutant general of
I California an excellent report of the
| movements of the forces.
The following paragraphs from official
orders refer to' Captain Relnhold Richter:
Captain Relnhold Richter, commanding
! Company I, First Infantry, was mortally
i wounded August 1. 1898, in a night attack
1 at Malate. P. L, and died August 4, IS9S,
I regretted by all of his acquaintances.
Captain Richter was an officer of ster
! ling character, and died the most glorious
i of all deathsâ that of a soldier on the field
! of battle, in the full discharge 'of his
j duty.
The Third Regiment, United States In
fantry, will leave New York by steamer
for Manila on January 15. It Is under
stood that the regiment's tour of duty at
the Philippines will be prolonged as many

THE INVESTIGATION
OF THE DEPOT C NDED
ONE CONTRACTOR BLUFFED THE
COMMITTEE.
At the Lowest Estimate the State
Lost by Faulty Changes and
Poor Work $70,000,
The Senate Investigating Committee j
yesterday closed its research ito the i
ferry depot frauds, and the report will
occupy the Legislature's attention early
in the coming session.
One item escaped the consideration of
the committee, notwithstanding it la- '
bored three weeKS in that direction. This
was the measurements of Bateman Bros.,
the woDdwork contractors. The Bateman j
facts and figures were so far away from :
those of the State expert that the Senate â 
committee ordered the contractor to get
the exact dimensions of his partitions for
a subject for discussion. The committee
became weary of the delay and adjourned
without the contractor's figures.
The report that will go before the Sen
ate will state that after a careful search
through the records of the construction
of the ferry depot, giving the builders the
greatest latitude in the matter of quan
tity and prices of material, allowing to
the fullest extent where there, was a pos
sibility that the change in plan was prac- !
tical and the . work fairly done, it has
been found that the loss to the State is
close to J7Q.000.. This is the lowest esti
mate, but the general belief in the minds
of the investigators is that the actual
loss will reach $100,000.
The expert architects found all manner
of reasons for this deficiency. There were
cases where the workmanship was good,
but the change bad; where workmanship
was bad though the change was good,
and finally where both were bad. The
most atrocious piece of work was the
Joining of iron to wood, instead of join
ing to the steel frame of the building.
Contrary to the plans or common-sense
the sheets of iron were nailed to the wood.
The specifications called for the bolting
of metal to metal, but the nails, far apart,
were considered the proper thing by the
architect, and he was permitted to Jog
along in his own way. Not only was the
iron-man given this right of way, but
the State paid to a carpenter contractor
$300 extra to put up the wooden "fixings"
so- that the iron fellow would have no
trouble In driving his nails. The experts
also reported faulty work on the roof. The
corrugated iron was in places damaged
and not well put on. The steel, stone
and brick work was found to have been
well done. In numerous cases the suc
cessive changes had overlapped and piled
upon each other until the original plan
was burled deep under the strata of dif
ferent periods in the construction of tae
great building.
General Dickinson stated in an Inter
view that the report of the committee
need not cover many page,*, as the labor
was practically finished when the experts
were ready with tjieir figures.

most talented negro in the
South, tells how the dark

WHAT STRUCK O'BRIEN P
The Well Known Banjo Player Meets

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 30, 1898.
VOTES WERE
SWAPPED FOR
GOLD BRICKS
I School Jobs That Did
Not Exist.
WALLER WAS MADE A VICTIM
HOW THE BOARD WORKED WED-
NESDAY'S MEETING.
Barrington, Bantel and Hammond
Were Won Over by Gilded
Promises That Could
Not Be Kept.
Who handed out the gold bricks?
Sam Waller wants to know; Bantel
won't cast another vote until he finds out;
School Directors Barrington and Ham
mond are sawing wood, but they have the
knife out for the man who did, when
time or unforeseen circumstances divulges
his name.
There were four of them passed out at
the meeting of the School Board on Wed
nesday evening, and each one of
them bought a vote for the elementary
committee report that ostensibly cre
ated eight nice vice-principalships by
raising the grades of eight schools. If
the figures on the last monthly reports
prove anything, only four of the eight
schools were entitled to a raise in grade,
but there were four votes to be bought,
and some one or other interested in the
elementary report temporarily raised the
grades and offered the four gilded parcels
to the four Directors who were nervous
about standing for the job. It worked.
President Barrington got one. His sis
ter was elected viee T principal of the
Everett First-class Grammar School, just
created, though he got cold feet and did
not stay to cast the vole for which he
had collected.
Bantel voted and got his brick in the
election of Miss L. F. Simon as vice-prin
cipal of the Hawthorne Intermediate
Grammar School. Sam Waller was
passed the gilded gift in the election of
Miss M. H. Lannigan as vice-principal of
the Richmond Intermediate Grammar
School, and Phil Hammond came in for
the appointment of another relative. Miss
G: Carrol as ."V. P." of the Humboldt
Intermediate Grammar Scnool.
Hammond may yet find that the brick
passed by him is the pure quill, for tue
average of daily attendance at the Hum
boldt is fluttering between the minimum
and less, but. the rest of the quartet will
have nothing but their records, to show
for the votes out of which they have been
bunkoed. The Everett is bejow the stand
ard, and .so are the Hawthorne and
Richmond, and it wll only require the
attention of the new board for a few min
utes to. rectify these matters, and put
the four schools back to the grades from
which they have been wrongfully raised.
This action of the Incoming board will
also reduce the new-made principals to
the status and salaries of the ordinary
teachers of the department.
Drueker. Ragan. t'arew and Burns got
the real thing, and have no kick coming.
Drucker had Miss Mi F. Lorrigan ap
pointed vice-principal of the Whittier;
Ragan placed his political adherent. Pro
fessor Babcock, in the principalship of
Lincoln School; Director Carew secured a
$125 job for his daughter as vice princi
pal of the Denman Grammar School, and
Burns was satisfied to have Miss R. Har
vey made vice principal of the Fairmount
Intermediate Grammar School. It took
votes to accomplish so general a distri
bution of good things, and counterfeits
of the same proposition were made up and
passed liberally around. Just how the
rest of the crowd will stand for it re
mains to be seen at the next meeting.
ARRESTED IN DUNSMUIR.
L. F. Minckler, the Postal Telegraph
Operator, Will Be Brought Back
to Answer His Crime.
L. F. Minckler, the Postal Telegraph
operator, who, in conjunction with Harry
L. Cator, alias Barclay, swindled the
Bank of Palo Alto out of $840 by means of
a bogus dispatch from the Farmers' and
Merchants' Bank of Los Angeles, was ar
rested In Dunsmulr yesterday morning on
a dispatch sent out by Chief Lees. Acting
on the suggestion of the Chief a warrant
was sworn out in Palo Alto for Minck
ler's arrest and a constable left by last
evening's train for Dunsmuir to bring
Minckler back. He will arrive here to
night with his prisoner.
Cator was taken from the City Prison
yesterday morning to Palo Alto by Con
stable Brownell, who arrived in the city
with the warrant for his arrest. Cap
tain Seymour yesterday discovered the
jewelry store where Cator purchased a
diamond ring for $220. He returned the
ring and received back the money. The
whole of the $840 has been recovered, ex
cept $60.
The Postal Telegraph Company will do
everything possible to prosecute the case
against the two young men. It appears
that on December 13 the telegraph com
pany received a dispatch from the Farm
ers' and Merchants' Bank of Los Angeles
to pay a gentleman in Palo Alto $500.
Minckler received that dispatch and from
it he got the idea of sending the bogus
dispatch, which proved successful.
County Officers' Bonds.
The Supreme Court having decided that
certain city and county officers are county
officers the Mayor, following the county
government act, requires personal bonds
for such officers, because otherwise, in
case of a suit for collection on the bonds,
the city would be at a disadvantage or,
perhaps, have no standing in court. The
amounts of the bonds as fixed by the Su
pervisors many years ago will be ac
cepted.
To comply with the provisions of both
the county governmert act and the con
solidation act the Mayor recommends
that both forms, so far as possible, be
complied with as to the approval on the
bonds, that is to say, by both the Judges
of the Superior Court and the Mayor and
Auditor.
The bonds will be delivered to the Aud
itor, who records them and provides for
custody according to law. The Mayor
believes in surety bonds, but cannot af
ford to take chances where the possible
rights of the city are involved. The at
tention of the Legislature will be called
to this when i^ is drafting a county gov
ernment act during the session, but the
charter in giving San Francisco home
rule makes ample provision for this.
The new Western Union Telegraphic
Code, which has been enlarged and
greatly improved, is now being issued
to subscribers.
In its present form it embraces more
than 150.000 words, covering every con
ceivable use of the wire, and reducing
the cost of telegraphic and cable com
munication to a minimum. In addi
tion to the code proper, the book con
tains a directory with cable addresses
attached.
Prompt application to the Interna
tional Cable Directory Company, 30
Broad street, publishers of the "West
ern Union Telegraphic Code," will in
sure insertion of names in the direc
tory in the second edition. Banks,
firms and individuals, on payment of
$12.50, can have their names inserted
in the book and will be furnished with
two conies of the code. This is a mar
velously low figure for so comprehen
sive a work.
Esqueda Held for Murder.
Miguel Esqueda was yesterday held
without %onda to answer before the Su
perior Court by Judge Conlan on a charge
of murder. He was accused of killing
hia wife, Boledad, in their home at 1317
Powell street by subjecting her to the
most atrocious cruelty in September lust.
THOUSANDS WILL
FIND EMPLOYMENT
Salvation Army Decides to Introduce the Salvage System in
San Francisco Immediately â Captain Robert Neil
to Direct the Work.
LLEUTENANT COLONEL, W. EVANS, commander of the Pacific Jurisdiction
of the Salvation Army, yesterday received a telegram from Chicago an
nouncing the departure from that city of Captain Robert Nell,' who will
come direct to San Francisco for the purpose of inaugurating: here the sal
vage system of the Salvation Arrfty, a comprehensive and important scheme
which originated with General Booth and which is outlined in the latter's famous
work. "In Darkest England."
"For many months past I have been laboring to the end that the salvage sys
tem might be brought to this coast," said Colonel Evans last evening. "By this
plan waste material is linked up with waste labor and employment is created
for a vast body of idle poor. Captain Neil is an able, practical man. Before en
tering on his career in the army, he whs the secretary of the Y. M. C. A. of West
Philadelphia, whence, at my instance, he proceeded to Chicago and there in
troduced the salvage system, which had previously been in operation in only two
American cities â New York ana . iiiladelphia. In establishing the salvage scheme
our organization has in view the principle that 'the direst danger to the nation is
not anarchy, but idleness." There is no question in the minds of thoughtful men
that enforced idleness is one of the most prolific sources of sorrow, misery and
crime In the world. Few men are brave enough to stand idly by and see their
wives and children slowly die of starvation. Rather will they steal or beg. One
s can easily understand the desperate actions of men who return home to starving
k>ved ones after a fruitless search for work. Myriads In all our cities are in this
condition, and the Salvation Army is meeting this condition.. 'j..ie army wastes
neither precious time nor precious money inquiring into characterâ it divides the
people into two classes only, 'ue willingand unwilling to work.' Wherever it
finds the willing, the army gives them employment to the limit of its capacity.
The salvage system Is among the most practical ways of finding employment.
The word salvage signifies the saving of a wreck. Humanly speaking, that is true
with us.
"We shall establish a salvage depot in San Francisco, under Captain Neil's
direction. These depots are large warehouses, from which we send men into
every part of the city to solicit and collect the waste. This waste is then sorted
and utilized in various profitable ways, and the money thus derived is turned to
the wages and help of the poor men thus employed. In Chicago at the present
time ten large wagons are in constant service collecting waste, and quite an army
of men is kept at work gatherlne rags, iron scraps, etc. and mending ol<l furni
ture; while great numbers of women are engaged in the work Of cleaning and re
pairing garments sent in by the charitably inclined. In connection with the de
pot here, we shall have a store, and articles of utility will be sold to poor people
at the very cost of repairs. Fur instance, if some broken chairs are brought in,
they are mended at the depot and put on sale. The chairs, new, might be worth
F<o cents of 75 cents each, and they will be sold for probably 10 cents each, and
this goes to the mender. In a somewhat similar manner, old furniture of every
other description and old clothing will be disposed of. Arrangements may possi
bly be made with the big newspaper offices whereby the salvage department of
the army will agree to sweep out and cart away every morning all waste paper,
and the waste paper will readily find a market with the paper manufacturers.
Whatever the paper brings will go to pay the laborers who collect it.
"You will observe," said Colonel Evans, in conclusion, "that In the develop
ment of this salvage Idea there are possibilities unlimited. The Salvation Army
in San Francisco will make the saivage system the initial departure for 1599."
EMPORIUM POLICE
ACCUSE MRS. PORTOISE
ARREST HER ON A CHARGE OF
SHOPLIFTING.
The Woman Stoutly Declares She
Found the Goods on the
Store Floor.
Mrs. Clarlase Portolse, who for years
has conducted a dressmaking establish
ment in this city, was arrested at noon
yesterday in the Emporium and a charge
of shoplifting c-ntered against her at the
City Prison. For some time past the lady
has been under suspicion, and about half
past 12 yesterday a clerk at the handker
chief counter reported to Captain Green
of the Emporium police that the woman
had taken two articles from his depart
ment.
The detective followed the suspect as
she boarded the elevator and made her
way to the ribbon counter on the second
floor. ShÂ«: would not examine ribbons in
bolts, but Insisted that she be shown
remnants. The clerk says that she at
tempted to stow away two small pieces,
but dropped them back In the basket
when she found that he was watching
her. When an opportunity came fhe
picked up a small bolt of ribbon and left
the counter. She was allowed to pass on
for a considerable distance before ar
rested, and when the officer seized her
right hand the ribbon dropped from it.
Upon being searched nine handkerchiefs
were found upon her person, of which
only one had been paid for. She was Im
mediately locked up In. the City Prison.
P. Portoise, the husband of the woman,
is a Belgian, and is reputed to be weal
thy. He is an Invalid and 85 years of age.
The couple occupied room 554 in the Bald
win Hot.'l on the night of the conflagra
tion. Later they resided at the Lick
House nnd now make their home in Oak
land. Mrs. Portoise's establishment is lo
cated at 27V> Fourth street, where she is
associated "with Mrs. Dehauger. The
major portion of their business is done
with theatrical people and the profits
have always been excellent. Her friends
were astonished when they learned of
the woman's arrest, and say that necessi
ty for theft on her part has never been
apparent to them.
Mrs. Portoise explains the presence of
the handkerchiefs on her person by say
ing that she picked them up oft* the floor.
She was released on $200 bonds and has
retained an attorney.
The Lederer Burglary.
The police are still searching for the
burglar who entered the residence of
Charles Lederer, at 2102 Bush street, sev
eral nights ago and stole Jewelry valued
at several hundred dollars. Yesterday De
tective Crockett, who Is working on the
case, discovered an Important clew, which
he thinks will lead to the detection of the
culprit. The police are now convinced
that the jewelry was not taken by a mem
ber of the family, as they had at first be
lieved.
EASTERN MINERS INVITED.
American Institute of Mining Engin-
eers As&ed to Hold Their Con
vention in This City.
The committee on the conservation of
water of the California Miners' Associa
tion met yesterday morning and during
its session transacted business which is
of vital importance not only to the min
ing industry but to the agricultural in
terests of the State.
It passed two resolutions. The first is
to hold a convention on January 21, to
which representatives of all commercial
organizations in the State will be in
vited.
The paramount matter to be considered
will be the storage and use of water. The
droughts of the past years have shown
the necessity of having available water
when nature fails to furnish the regular
year's supply. The proposition is to con
struct large dams and reservoirs and save
the water which runs to waste. The
farmers as well as the miners will be
benefited by such action, hence the com
mercial people are asked to put their
shoulder to the wheel in conjunction with
the Miners' Association.
The second resolution is a request to
the presiding officers of both branches of
the coming Legislature to appoint stand
ing committees on the conservation of
water.
The Miners' Association has sent the
following invitation to the American In
stitute of Mining Engineers urging them
to hold their next annual meeting in this
city. Should the invitation be accepted
one of the largest representative bodies
of mining men In the world may be ex
pected here during the autumn of the
coming year, and their visit may assist
materially in stimulating the mining in
dustry in California.
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Deo. 29, 1898
To the President ami Members of the Ameri
can Institute of Mining Engineersâ Dear Sir
and Gentlemen: The California Miners' Asbo
elation send greetings to your honorable body
and desire to extend an invitation to you to
hold your next annual fall meeting in the city
of San Francisco. â  *
Every effort in the power of the association
will bÂ« used to make the visit pleasant and
profitable. California is the proud possessor of
a mineral country second to none In the world
and we foe! confident that if your body will
visit us and hold your deliberations in our
midst that we can more than repay you for the
long trip necessary to reauft this ooast.
We shall be pleased to have your reply at as
early a date as possible In order that the neces
sary committee of arrangements may be. ap
pointed and ways and means provided for your
comfort and entertainment.
Trusting this will meet your approval and
awaiting your favorable reply, we beg to re
main respectfully yours.

AN OPEN BOAT
The Timely Arrival of
Captain Jordan.
PICKED UP OFF FARALLONES
DESPERATE BATTLE WITH A
RAGING SEA.
Lighthouse Keeper Beaman Attempt
ed the Trip to This City in a
Whitehall During a
Gale.
While cruising near the Farallon Isl
ands yesterday afternoon Captain F. \V.
Jordan of the pilot-boat America came
upon an open boat, in which were W.
Beaman, head lighthouse keeper, his wife
and two children, one an infant of two
months and the other a boy of ten years,
and H. Engleberg, the assistant light
house-keeper. They were in distress and
Captain Jordan picked them up and
brought them to this city, making a spe
cial trip and returning to sea last night.
The son of Mr. Beaman has been 111 for
some time, and as he became worse yes
terday It was decided to attempt the trip
to this city in an open boat. The party
left the island about 1 o'clock p. m., ex
pecting to reach San Francisco in about
three hours. The sea was very heavy,
and the wintl was blowing a gale from the
north. Despite the efforts of the two
men at the oars but little progress could
be made. After being out four hours but
sixteen miles had been made, and this
considerably out of their course. Both of
the men were greatly fatigued by their
battle with the heavy sea when Captain
Jordan arrived on the scene and went to
their rescue. He landed them at Meiggs
wahrf about 10 o'clock last night, and the
!<i( k boy was immediately taken to a doc
tor.
The father had been waiting several
days for a quiet day to bring his son to
the city and had also been on the lookout
for some vessel which he might hail. Ves
sels very seldom touch at the islands, the
tender Madrona being about the only one,
and her trips are about a month apart.
The serious illness of the boy required
medical attention, and Mr. Beaman deter
mined to risk the trip in an open boat.
The fortunate appearance of Captain Jor
dan and his kindness in taking the party
on his boat probably saved their lives, as
the Whitehall could not have lasted in the
heavy sea.
IMPOSED ON A BOY.
P.aul Teirea, Aged 12 Years, Robbed
by a Despicable Thief.
Paul Terrea, a 12-year-old boy, while
walking along Mission street last night
was accosted by a well dressed young
man, who asked him If he wanted to
make a dollar. The boy replied In the af
firmative, and the stranger told him to go
to 105 Mason street, where, he claimed,
his horse was stabled, and bring It to
him. The boy started on his errand, and
had gone only a few steps when the
stranger called him back. He asked him
if he had any money, and when he re
plied that he had a silver dollar the des
picable thief induced him to give It to
him. He said he would hold it until the
boy returned.
When the little fellow showed up a
short time afterward the stranger- was
fonc. Realizing he had been robbed the
oy visited police headquarters, where he
told the story to Lieutenant Hanna. Dur
ing the past few weeks the same man
has succeeded In robbing a number of
boys by this means. He Is described as
being rather tall, has a smooth face and
wears a dark fedora hat. The police have
determined to catch him, and when they
do they propose to see that he gets a
long sentence.
SHOWERS -TO-DAY.
Bain for San Francisco and the
Northern Part of the State.
Weather Prophet W. H. Hammon was
somewhat surprised yesterday by the
small rain that slipped In on him. He de
clared that he had seen it coming yester
day morning, but that he did not know Us
exact cause, unless it might be attributed
to the general depression in Eastern Ore
gon and Northern Nevada. The weather
has been much colder In Utah and Neva
da and also In the northern part of the
State.
There Is a severely cold wave In the Da
kotas moving in a southeastward direc
tion. Mr. Hamrnon thinks that in view of
the rapid falling of the barometer along
the north coast of Cape Mendocino rain
may be expected to-day from San Fran
cisco northward. There will be a deoided
fall in temperature in the southern part of
the State, with probably disastrous re
sults to citrus fruit.
Mr. Hammon expects showers to-day
but not a steady rain.
New Year's Masquerade.
The annual prize masquerade ball of
the Arion Benevolent Society will take
place at the Mechanics' Pavilion to-mor
row, New Year's eve. The old year will
be ushered out and the new year ushered
in in a lively and lolly manner.
