PrTTSBURG. Oct. 9.â Not in the
â ry of Knights Templar con
es, from 1816 to this day. has
ye ever been opened <'ii
i more beautiful day than it was
In Pittsburg to-day. The sun. after
having been hidden behind ru in-filled
Is for several days, burst upon the
awakening city this morning and threw
his rays of smiles and admiration upon
the festival array of streets and build
which made every one feel that
this was an omen of the weather god.
The influx of Knights, which com
menced yesterday, continued during the
day. and up to midnight, when the for
mal opening of the conclave was in
augrurated with the festival sermon at
the Trinity Episcopal Church. There
â was a congregation assembled larger
than this historic building has ever
held.
ThÂ» first formal event of the pro
gramme of the twenty-seventh Trienni
al Conclave of Knights Templar took
place in Trinity Protestant Episcopal
Church. It was the official divine serv
ice of the Knights Templar, and was
very impressive and largely attended.
Most Eminent Sir Xn J ght Warren La
rue Thomas, Grand Master, was escort
ed to Trinity ("hurch by 500 Knights]
Tempiar, u-.ia as many more crowded
the church yards, unable to obtain ad
mittance. The old church was filled to
Its utmost capacity. Rev. Dr. Alfred
W. Arundel, rector of Trinity, read the
service, aid the sermon was del;
by Rev. r r. Cornelius L. Twing, rector
of Calvary Church, Brooklyn, X. V.,
and Grand Prelate of tne Grand En
campment.
After a graphic description of Tem
plariaxn, ac related to the relieving of
distress and the uplifting of the fallen.
Dr. Twing said:
"To-day ye meet in this beautiful
temple err-rted to God and consecrated
to his worship, to ask his presence and
his blessing upon the labors in which
we shall be engaged and upon the
pleasures we shall enjoy. From every
part of our land there com* 1 .- to this
goodly city thousands of Knights Tem
plar.
"We come in peace, from all parts
of a land that is ;n pÂ»ace. The sound
of war has ceased; the strife is Â«.v r:
the bravery of our army and navy has
won a glorious victory, and a war that
has lasted about 100 days has advanced
civilization 100 years in the lands that
have been freed from the power of a
nation that has always persecuted Free
masonry and tried by inquisitorial
methods to suppress it.
"Thank God for that victory; thank
God for the loyalty and patriotism of
the entire United States. Thank God
for the good example of the brave boys
â who have given up th^ir liv^s for the
cause of humanity and progressive lib
erty.
"The Grand Encampment soon toas-
Ff-ml-le in triennial conclave are repre
sentatives of the great and glorious or
der of Christian Knighthood. L,ike our
ancient brethren we are marching to
ward Jerusalem, but not the one of Ju
tiut the Jerusalem on the hills of
heaven. 'In hocsipno vincs'was the mot
to of the hen 'Â»â : of the cross in the past.
They put the precepts of the Christian
religion into practice, and it bore fruit
in their lives and action. We must do
likewise, or our profession is a vain and
idle thing."
During the day enouph Knights ar
rived In the city from all parts of the
country to swell the number now here
to something like 10,000. The local re
ception committee expects at least 25,
000 Knights before the parade on Tues
day.

tending divine services In Trinity Epis
copal Church the California delegation
to the twenty-seventh Triennial Con
clave of Knights Templar spent a pleas
ant day in Pittsburg. Before the Cali
fornia ns were awake the members of
Pittsburg Commandery, No. 1, were at
the Hotel Henry, planning pleasure
trips for them. They were told not to
leave their hotel after luncheon.
About 2 o'clock a long line of stylish
equipages drove up to the hotel, and
the Californians were invited out for a
drive. There were over tweirty-five ve
hicles In the parade. The route was out
Fifth and Forbs avenues to Schenley
Park. After making a hasty examina-
tion of the Carnegie libraries, music
hall, art galleries, etc., the party whs
taken through the park. From Schen
ley the drive was along the new boule
vard to Highland Park, where the Zoo
was inspected, and the visitors given
a view of the Alleghany Valley, as
seen from Highland. A short stop was
made at the bandstand In the park, the
ladies wanting tv hear the concert mu
sic. The party then came back to the
city, arriving at the hotel about dark.
Some of the delegation did not go on
the drive, but were entertained by per
sonal friends. Among these was S. G.
Murphy, president of the First Nation
al Bank of San Francisco, who, with
his daughter, Miss Adelaide, was laken
out by Mrs. Oliver McClintock. Mr.
and Miss Murphy were guests at the
Mercur-Speer wedding last evening.
Several dinners have been planned for
th^-m.
The Californians will be taken on a
sight-seeing and Instruction trip to
morrow. Members of Pittsburg fnm
mandery will escort them to a special
train for Homestead, where they will
inspect the armor plate and other
works of the Carnegie Steel Company.
They will view the Bcene of the
slaughter of Pinkerton detectives dur
ing the great strike in 1892. From
Homestead the party will go to Du
quesne, and then to Braddock, where
the other Carnegie plants will be in
spected. If time permits they will also
visit the works of the Westinghouse
Electric Company at East Pittsburg
and Wilmerding. If unable to visit the
electric plants to-morrow they will
probably go there Wednesday. Thurs
day is the date of their big reception.
The committee on escorts received no
tice to-day that Golden Gate Com
mander^- of San Francisco, which has
been expected, will not be here.
Twelve commanderies arrived to-day.
The majority had brass bands, and their
entrance to the city, under escort of
local Kniehts, was in every instance an
imposing one. The streets of the city
were crowded to a greater extent than
ever known before. Bands of the vis
iting commanderies paraded the down

MELINE SPEAKS OF THE
GLOOMY OUTLOOK FOR FRANCE.
EPINAL,, France, Oct. 9.â Jules Meline, Premier of the French Ministry preceding the present Government
of M. Brisson, who presided at a banquet of the Association of Railway Employes here last evening, uttered a
serious warning against the agitation and unrest in France.
Referring to the divided state of the country, the violence of polemicsand the sectarian spirit displayed in
politics, he said it was impossible to see France thus torn by factions, and devoured by political passions, while
daily the principle of authority was undermined, the army weakened and the institution upon which rested the se
curity of the nation shaken, without thinking of "that opening in the Vosges through which an invading
army could pass," or without thinking of "some unforeseen temptation being offered to the foreigner."
The adversaries of France, however, had no need to declare war, said M. Meline. They were content to
await the exhaustion of France.

PORTLAND, Or., Oct. 9.â Senator-elect
Joseph Simon, in an interview regarding
his course on the leading questions which
will come before Congress, to-day said:
"I favor the retention of the entire

to the ratification of a treaty that remits
any portions of them to Spain. I am for
Government construction and control of
the Nicaragua canal and favor a Pacific
c.-ible. I am for a largpr standing army
and a greater navy. I am especially anxi
ous for a firmer establishment of the gold
standard and reformation of the cur
rency by retirement of Government paper
obligations and creation of a banking
currency. These measures are of great
urgency, both because of our prospective
trade expansion and because postpone

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 9.â The World's London
correspondent cables that war with France may be
declared within forty-eight hours.
The Journal's correspondent says that work is
being rushed forward in British dockyards and
arsenals in order to guard against eventualities.
LONDON, Oct. 9.â The Foreign
Office has issued a Fashoda blue
book, giving the correspondence
between the French and British
governments. It begins with a
dispatch dated December 10, 1897, from
Sir Edmund Monson, British Embassa
dor at Paris, to Lord Salisbury, refer
ring to rumors of the massacre of the
Marchand expedition, and expressing
the Embassador's satisfaction that he
has been allowed to acquaint M. Han
otaux (French Foreign Minister of that
day) with Lord Salisbury's view that
if other questions are adjusted Great
Britain will make no difficulty regard
ing the French claim on the northern
and eastern shores of Lake Tchad. The
dispatch shows, however, that the Em
bassador made it clear that this conces
sion must not be understood as admit
ting the right of any European power
except Great Britain to occupy any part
of the Nile valley.
M. Hanotaux replied r.n December 24
in a long dispatch of respectful protest
against Lord Salisbury's views.
On August 2 of this year Lord Sal
isbury wrote Lord Cramer, British dip
lomatic, agent at Cairo, giving him in
structions that, after the capture of
! Khartoum, two flotillas should ascend
\ to Fashoda and go up the Blue Nile
as far as it should prove navigable fo^
steamers. Under these instructions the
! Sirdar was personally to command the
Fashoda flotilla and to take a few
troops, if he should consider it desirable,
the object being to assert Great Brit
ain's sphere of influence in the Nile val
ley.
On September 7 Sir Edmund Monson
reported to Lord Salisbury a conversa
tion in which M. Del Casse, French
Foreign Minister, announced that Mar
chand had no authority to decide on
questions of right, and had been in
! structed to abstain from any action
likely to lead to local conflict. M. Del
Casse further expressed a conviction
that the matter was susceptible of ar
rangement by means of discussion.
To this Lord Salisbury replied on Sep
tember 9 that Great Britain regarded
the operations of the Sirdar (General
Kitchener) as placing all the territories
of Khalifa Abdullah, by right of con
quest, in the hands of the British and
Egyptian governments, and insisted
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
that this contention admitted of no dis
cussion.
Then follows various dispatches re
cording the discussion before Sir Ed
mund Monson and M. Del Casse, the
latter explaining that Marchand was
now virtually a lieutenant to the Lio
tard expedition, and that, therefore, the
situation at Fashoda, even if Marchand
was there, could not be as dangerous
as Sir Edmund Monson had repre
sented.
On September 25 the Sirdar reported
the results of his expedition to Fa
shoda, fully confirming the announce
ments already cabled to the Associat
ed Press, including the fact that Gen
eral Kitchener's removal there pre
vented a second Dervish attack on
Marchand.
The French officer informed the Sir
dar that he had concluded a treaty,
which he had sent to France for rati
fication, whereby the Shillock chiefs
had placed the country under French
protection. Marchand replied in the
negative to General Kitchener's ques
tion whether he was prepared to resist
the hoisting of the Egyptian flag, but
he maintained that he had orders from
the French Government to occupy Fa
shoda.
On the departure of the British forces
General Kitchener notified Major Mar
chand in writing that all transporta
tion of war material on the Nile was
absolutely prohibited.
The Sirdar's dispatch concludes as
follows: "The chief Shillock came to
our camp and positively denied that
they had concluded any treaty with
Marchand, while all the Shillocks de
clared their allegiance to the British
Government. Moreover, Marchand was
in such a precarious position that noth
ing could have prevented his annihila
tion by the Dervishes had we been a
fortnight later in crushing the Khalifa.
Other dispatches indicate that M. Del
Casse declined Great Britain's request
for the immediate recall of Major Mar
chand, and that Great Britain agreed
to dispatch a message for the French
Government to Marchand as a matter
of courtesy without accepting ajiy re
sponsibility for the results delay might
entail and still maintaining that the
matter admitted of no comr-nmlse.
In the final dispatch appearing in the
blue book Lord Salisbury, under date
of October 3, instructs Sir Edmund
Monson to inform M. Del Casse that
the latter's message to Major Mar
chand has been sent, but that Great
Britain views the Marchand mission as
having no political significance what
ever.
CAIRO, Oct. 9.â The report that the
treasures of the Khalifa, valued at
Â£10.000,000 ($50,000,000) has been
found and was being forwarded to
Cairo is without foundation.
Equally baseless is the report thAt
General Kftchener will resign the Sir
darship.
TROOPS FROM KHARTOUM
DYING LIKE FLIES
LONDON, Oct. 10.â A dispatch to the
Daily Chronicle from Alexandria says:
The troops who have returned from
Khartoum are dylnp like flies from en
teric disorders, supposed to be due to
canned beef and indulgence in cheap
spirits.
LONDON, Oct. 10.â All the morning
papers applaud Lord Salisbury's firm
ness in the F&shoda question and the
fact that he has approved all the do
ings of General Kitchener.

By HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
JI'NEAU, Alaska, Oct. 5, by steam
ship Al-Ki to Seattle, Oct. 9.â The
scenes of a superlatively romantic com
edy-drama in real life, with all the gen
uine emotions and a touch of the tragi
cal to make it more thrilling, are shift-
Ing about between three places â San
Francisco, Juneau and Dawson City.
Th^ first act took place in San Fran
cisco, Just one month ago to-day. Then,
as was related in The Call of Septem
ber 19, exclusively as now, a young
Klondiker named Francois Pigeon en
tered, as unexpectedly as a meteor from
heaven, the home of his fiancee, after
an absence of two years in the Klon
dike, and found her wedded but an
hour to another. He owns a claim on
Bonanza Creek, and returned to lay the
gold at her feetâ the feet of Virginia
Reiffel, tall and fair and false. She
swooned. He turned and left her.
On the morning of October 1 the scene
changed to Juiieau. The curtain went
up in San Francisco without an audi
ence, but the climax is here. Among
the passengers who trooped down the
gang plank from the eleamship Al-Ki
were an earnest looking young Kion
diker and a tall, handsome, black-haired
gil in stunning costume, who hung
fondly nn his arm. Such a couple could
not escape attracting attention, es
pecially as it was whiapered among the
passengers that they had had Quite a
romance. He registered at v. hotel as
"J. Brunser and wife, Dawson City."
That afternoon the scene shifted to
a room characterized by books in
leather binding and tables strewn with
legal looking papers. Enter the same
young man.
"I would like to have your attention,"
said he.
"Fire away," replied he of the musty
tomes.
"Can I get a divorce for my wife from
another man?"
"What i â¢
"Yes, that's it. She's married to an
other man and I want to get a divorce
for her."
"Young man, be more explicit. Do not
trifle with the law, sir; the law in
Alaska, for anon it arouseth itself and
gocth about like a roaring lion over
coming the whisky seller with fear and
trembling and a semi-annual line. Tell
me all of yuur troubles, sir."
As the young Mr. Brunsor of the hotel
told his story, substantially as previous
ly related, he (â â â u.il not compose his
feelings. Tears came into his eyes as
they have into the eyes of many a
lover. He told how Virginia, the Vir
ginia for whom he had tuiied two long
years and made a fortune, had secret
ly sent for him at his hotel in San
Francisco two days after she had mar
ried Mr. Miigaium; how she had wait
ed long and patiently for him, had not
received a single letter, and, supposing
he had forgotten her or his love had
gruwn cold, had accepted the other man
while even at the moment thinking of
him in Alaska far away. Then she
told him her heart was still his and
ever had been; that she wouldn't live
another minute with her lawful lord,
and, weeping, that if he wanted her he
could have her and she would go with
him; that she despised herself more
than a faded ribbon or any old thing
and she didn't care what happened to
her; that it was all an awful mistake
and she %vould throw herself into the
bay and he could chuck his old gold
In after herâ so there!
They cried together awhile like chil
dren and then â but that was shown
when they came happily together down
the gangplank of the good ship Al Kl.
This Alaska Blackstone advised that
as the statute required a year's resi
dence in Alaska for eligibility for di
vorce, and as the ycung lady had not
been in town more than four hours nor
In Alaska much more than thirty-six,
they were confronted by an obstacle
which could not be legally removed.
Once more clouds settled darkly on the
hearts of the young elo-pers.
Complications arc more mixed for the
reason, it is said, that the young hus
band in San Francisco will fight a di
vorce suit. The lover here said he was
told by nn attorne" in San Francisco
that she could pet a divorce here with
but little delay, and, acting under that
advice, they camp on to Junoau, ex
pecting her to be speedily divorced and
then become his bride.
1 ii.sked him this afternoon if his
name was Bruns'T. He said "No," and
avoided conversation. He evidently
feels their position keenly. Their story
leaked from the ship Into the hotel and
the peculiar situation has won fur them
sympathy and friends even among
those who riu not krviw them. Mr. and
Mrs. Brunser conduct themselves with
rjuipt propriety. Men raised their hats
to them when they went out together;
but they do not go on the street to
gether now. The ladies in the hotel
pppak pleasantly to her as they pass
her in the parlor or halls. The happy,
yet more unhappy, couple do not know
which way to turn or what to do bo ,
that they can be lawfully wedded.
He of the musty tomes holds an opin
ion that indicates, as tho speediest way
yut of the dilemma, that the third and
last act of the drama will be played I
In Pan Francisco with the curtain iis- \
Ing before a divorce court scene.
ALASKAN SURVEYING

a. week apo to the effect that (inly two
of the several Government surveying 1
parties sent to Alaska last spring by
the United States survey would reach
the coast of the Territory in time to re
turn home before the winter storma
should block the trail, the fortunate
parties being those of Spurr and Mc

MAKES CHARGES OF
TERRIBLE CRUELTY
AstouQdiog Abuses at the TopeKa
Insane Asylum Alleged by the
Superintendent.
KANSAS CITY, Oct. 9.â A special to the Journal from Topeka,
Kans., saya: Dr. C. H. Wetmore has tendered his resignation as
superintendent of the State Insane Asylum at Topeka to Governor
Leedy and the State Board of Charities. Accompanying the resigna
tion was a letter to the Governor in which Dr. Wetmore gave his
reasons for resigning.
The letter tells an astounding story of alleged cruelty, inhumanity
and debauchery at that institution under the present management.
The doctor tells of alleged instances of death of patients from neg
lect; speaks of the "drunkards and incompetents placed over the un
fortunate inmates"; charges that a State "joint" exists at the asy
lum; accuses Chairman H. C. Jumper of the State Board of Chari
ties with being on a continual debauch for the past fifteen months,
and openly charges subordinate officials with attempting to ruin
pure women.
These are only a few of the sensational charges made in the let
ter, which is published in full. Dr. Wetmore declares he stands ready
to prove every charge, and says he can prove even more. Dr. Wet
more is an appointee of the present Populist administration.
by this time, judging from their posi
tions when heard from in August on
their proposed route toward St. Mich
ael. Mr, Barber, a member of the par
ty, has just communicated with the of
fice, requesting permission to stop off at
Canton en route east. There arc two
survey geologists, Mr. Schrader and Mr.
Mendenhall. under detail from the War
Department expedition, under Captain
Abercromble. From these men there
are no recent advices, but it is under
stood they will be out of the Territory in
good season. It is thought probable
that Captain Abercrombie is the Cap
tain McCmmbie referred to in the dis
patch as the head of one of the two
fortunate parties."
SEATTLE. Oct. 9. â The Government
purvey party, under George Eldrldge
and Robert Mulldrow, arrived to-day

The party has been surveying all sum

HALDEMAN SAID TO
HAVE DISAPPEARED
When Cincinnati's Grand Jury Takes
Up the Murder Case a Sensa
tion Is Expected.
CINCINNATI, Oct. P.â When the Grand
Jury meets to-morrow sensational devel
opments are expected in the case of W.
J. Haldeman, charered with killing his
brother-in-law and business partner, ex-
Senator J. C. Richardson of Glendale.
After they quarreled In their paper mill
at Lockland and the fatal shooting oc
curred, on September 22, Haldeman re
mained in concealment. Richardson died
a week later and the day preceding his
death Haldeman left for Chicago. Learn
ing that a warrant had been sworn out by
Coroner Herr, charging murder in tho
first degree, Haldeman returned last
Tuesday night and e-arly the next morn
ing wns bound over for manslaughter i.y
his neighbor, the Mayor of Lockland. He
was admitted to bail and has not been
seen since.
The officers of the city have never been
able to serve their murder warrant, but
the case will come before the Grand Jury
for indictment for murder in the ftnu de
gree and then it will be known â whether
Haldeman has really disappeared. His
attorneys promise that he will surrender
if indicted. Owing to the prominence of j
both the Richardson and Haldeman farni- I
lies the case is attracting unusual atten
tion.

THE SAN FKAISTCTSCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1898.
FOR A LEAGUE OF
MUNICIPALITIES
Project of the Mayor of
Santa Clara.
IDEAS COULD BE EXCHANGED
WOULD TEND TOWABD BETTER
GOVERNMENT.
Letters Sent Out Over the State Bring
Replies Heartily in Favor
of the Plan Sug
gested.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CLARA, Oct. 8. â Mayor
i Druffel of this city has sent out a com
â  munication to all the cities in this
! State, which number nearly one hun
dred, suggesting the formation of a
"League of California Municipalities"
after the manner of similar organiza- J
tions In the East. The purpose Is to
exchange views concerning the work
being done by cities and to discuss
problems of municipal government;
also to try and amend the laws of the
State concerning municipal corpora
tions so that a better system may be
obtained. Numerous replies have been
received, all of which heartily favor the
plan suggested and the Idea is general
that a great measure of good may re
sult.
The receipt of a few more replies will
result in the calling of a meeting to be
held about December 1 at Santa Clara.
This place has a reputation for using
business methods in its management !
and is up to date in the matter of pub
lic improvements. The following is
Mayor Druffel's letter:
Dear Sir: At the request of the members
of the Board of Town Trustees of Santa
Clara, I write you to suggest the forma
tion of an "Association of California Mu
nicipalities," after the manner that simi
lar oragnizations are being formed in
Eastern States.
I can conceive that a great good may be
achieved from a meeting of the represent
atives of tho several cities of this State;
we could be kept informed as to what was
being done In the way of municipal ad
viuicement; various experiments In muni
cipal government could be studied and i
discussed, and new ideas might be Im
parted that would be of advantage to all
concerned. At present but a very meager
knowledge is obtainable as to what other
cities are doing and we are entirely out
of touch with each other upon many im
portant propositions. Furthermore, the
laws governing municipal corporations are
in an almost chaotic state, and some at
tempt to establish order might be maxle
by the* proposed association.
Therefore I earnestly Invite an expres
sion from you concerning the desirability
and practicability of forming this associa
tion. Should it meet with the approbation
of a considerable number of the represeta
tives Of the cities of this State, I shall
tako tho liberty of calling such a meet
ing for some time about December 1. If
there is no objection, would suggest Santa
Clara as the place for the first meeting.
It is true that It la not a big city, but we
think we have one or two things Vo show
that are up to date in municipal govern
ment. Yours, respectfully,
D. O. DRUFFEL.

SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT
MODEL SERVICE AT ALL STAGES
OF THE WAR.
Woman's Grand Work Gratefully Ac
knowledged â Special Refer
ence to Miss Long and
Her Associates.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 9.â Probably no
better illustration can be found of the
foresight exhibited by the navy in pre
paring for the war than is afforded by
the history of the medical corps during
the struggle. This is set out in the an
nual report of Surgeon-General W. K.
Van Reypen, which is the first of the
navy bureau reports submitted for
publication.
Surgeon-General Van Reypen begins
with a modest tribute to the good judg
ment and foresight of his predecessor,
General Tryon, who in putting in order
and equipping the several naval hos
pitals, was of incalculable service to the
bureau, enabling it to properly care for
the sick or wounded of the navy dur
ing the war. When the Maine was
blown up Surgeon-General Van Reypen
was in charge of the bureau and began
preparations immediately for any con
tingency. The hospitals were fully
equipped, plans were prepared for pa-
vilion wards, and the naval laboratory
prepared to furnish medical and sur
pical supplies in any quantity. No ad
ditional expense was incurred until war
seemed imi nent; then every vessel
likely to be engaged was given a full
outfit of medical supplies for war. In
anticipation of a large increase of the
navy, proper outfits were made ready
and boxed for a large number of ships,
ready for call.
"There has not been an Instance dur
ing the war," says the sur-eon-general,
"of any vessel having had to wait for
her medical stores."
It was known that the medical corps
was inadequate In number for war, yet
there was no law authorizing the em
ployment of volunteer medical officers.
But medical boards were sent out In
anticipation to the principal cities to
examine applicants for appointment,
and as a consequence when the war
broke out Lhe medical department had
at hand from which to make selections
of volunteer surgeons, a long list of well
j educated men, and thirty-seven of these
were appointed out of 2000 applicants.
Surgeon-General Van Reypen says:
"They have rendered efficient service
and have been a credit to the navy.
Some have had unusual and trying ex
periences, but they have accommodated
themselves to their environments and
have Justified their appointments."
Only one medical officer was killed
during the war. Assistant Surgeon John
Blair Gtbbs, who fell at Guantanamo,
serving with the Marine Battalion.
The Medical Department had long de
sired to establish a hospital service at
sea on a specially selected vessel, and
the approach of war gave it an oppor
tunity to demonstrate the wisdom of
its propositions and the efficiency of its
methods. The steamer Creole was pur
chased, and with the valuable assis
tance of Naval Constructor Woodward
was converted Into an ambulance ship
within sixteen days, having every ap
pliance of modern surgery, disinfecting
apparatus, cold storage, laundry and
elevators. She was a pioneer In her
work indicating a step in advance that
It well became the United States to
take.
The report gives a succinct history of
the valuable services rendered by the
Creole in caring for the sick and
wounded.
The surgeon general continues: "In
this war woman has done her perfect
work and the medical department of
the navy 1b profoundly grateful for the
money contributed and supplies fur
nished for the aid of the sick and
wounded of the navy. Patriotic women
have ably supplemented the efforts of
the Government, and their assistance
has been thoroughly appreciated."
In this connection the report calls at
tention to the fact that as soon as war
was declared the daughter of Secretary
Long and three of her associates at the
Johns Hopkins Medical School volun
teered thtir services as nurses and
were assigned to duty in the hospital.
In conclusion the Surgeon General
says: "I cannot close this portion ol
the bureau's report without bearing tes
timony to the efficiency, skill and de
votion to duty of the personnel of the
medical department. Not a word but
of i 'raise hap the bureau heard of any
of them, regulars or volunteers. When
war was imminent they vied with one
another in their efforts to get on fight
ing ships. Some have had greater op
portunities than others, but all have
done well the work assigned them. Sur
geon Edgar saw his associate. Assist
ant Surgeon Gibbs, shot by his side in
the Spanish attack and he continued
his work alone, doing it thoroughly and
well, and it was known no would. The
medical officers of the vessels in the
fi^ht at Manila and in the battle of the
3d of July shared the dangers of their
comrades and should participate in the
praise accorded them.
"The medical officers of the Solace
have the honor of inaugurating the first
complete system of antiseptic surgery
at sea. They have adapted means to
ends, have improvised apparatus, have
been fertile in expedients and have
the satisfaction of having demonstrat
ed that with skill and intelligence the
percentage of mortality among patients
on a well-equipped ambulance ship will
be no greater than In the hospitals on
shore.
"Medical Inspector Persons found
himself suddenly confronted with 226
Spanish sick or wounded prisoners in
a partly established hospital. He was
equal to the emergency, and he and his
associates were complimented by Ad
miral Cervera when he visited the
camp.
"The mpdical officers of the other hos
pitals have had sudden large acces
sions of patients. They were always
ready and always cared for thorn well."

NEW YORKERS VIEW
BATTLE OF INDIANS
Goes -to -War Leads the Sioux,
While Big Brave Guides the
BlacKfoot Warriors.
OMAHA, Neb., Oct. 9.â The total attendance at the exposition Inrt
week was nearly 150,000. Hon. Chauncey M. Depew and visiting
New Yorkers viewed the sham battle fought by the Indians on the
exposition grounds. Few of the distinguished visitors from the Em
pire State had ever seen Western Indians and their methods employed
In war, and these proved most interesting. The battle was fought
along stated lines, Goes-to-War looking after the interests of the
Sioux, while Big Brave was the guiding star of the Blackfeet. There
was a brilliant charge made by the Sioux routing their enemies, and
In turn there was the return charge of the Blackfeet, which had been
reinforced by a lot of Indians, who had been loafing down among the
trees on the west side of the camp. In the final charge the Sioux
were outnumbered and routed, leaving their pretended dead upon the
field.
After the battle Chauncey M. Depew and the members of his
party, under the guidance of Captain Mercer and the exposition of
cials visited the camp and looked in upon the Indians, shaking hands
with some of the big men of the tribes and admiring the little fel
lows.
ALMOST A RIOT
AT THE MEETING
Sausalito Trustees in
Stormy Session.
DENOUNCED BY TAXPAYERS
TROUBLE OVER THE LETTING OF
A CONTRACT.
Attempt to Give San Franciscans
Preference Over a Local Firm
Arouses the Wrath of
Citizens.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 9.â The Board of
Trustees tried to operate a little
"cinch" game on local contractors at a
meeting held last Friday evening and
the result surpassed Its liveliest imagin
ation.
The session almost ended In a rlo-t as
a consequence of sensational charges
by S. Cheda and Christopher Chisholm.
The language used by these indignant
taxpayers was so plain and reflected
such discredit on Individual members of
the board that Trustee Henry Eickhoff
grew Infuriated and demanded that
Marshal Healy eject Chisholm from the
room.
About a month ago bonds for a new
outfall sewer system were voted in the
sum of $25,000. The specifications pro
vided that Iron-stone mains should be
laid. After the bonds were voted the
Trustees arbitrarily changed the speci
fications so- as to read that wooden
mains should be used. This move cre
ated a deal of adverse comment, and
its legality was questioned by a local
paper.
Last Friday night the board received
bids for laying the woodwork of the
new system. The bid of Thomas O'Con
nor, a local contractor, was $15,887; that
of the Excelsior Pipe Company of tfan
Francisco about $400 more. The San
Francisco firm was about to get the
contract when Cheda jumped to his feet
and shouted:
"As a taxpayer I protest against this
raw work. It is a 'cinch game' pure
and simple, and I ask that all bids be
rejected."
Prior to Cheda's Interruption Henry
P. Wood had spoken warmly in favor
of granting the Excelsior Pipe Com
pany the contract on the rather pe
culiar ground that its bid was "only a
few hundred dollars more than O'Con
nor's." He now arose and repeated his
language, whereupon Chisholm sprang
to his feet and declared the board to be
a "set of clowns."
"You are trying to get the royalty
out of the patent rights of the San
Francisco firm," he asserted, "and as a
taxpayer I protest."
At this Trustee Eickhoff, whose ar
guments showed him to favor the San
Francisco firm, arose and in a voice
trembling with anger demanded that
Marshal Healy eject Chisholm. So
warm waxed the excitement that the
board was forced to adjourn without
taking any action to next Tuesday
evening.
The trouble over the contracts, It is
alleged arises mainly ooit of the fact
that the board is aiming for the roy
alty coming through the patent rights
of the San Francisco company, and this
the taxpayers are averse to paying. In
addition the latter firm wishes to bring
its own men over to work on the sewer
and throw local men out of employ
ment.
A highly inflammatory poster, headed
with a skull and crossbones, has been
placarded in the window of E. Krun
bull, a watchmaker, denouncing the ac
tion of the board and railing on the
citizens to be present at the next meet
ing to stop the "cinch" on local men.
Crowds daily block the sidewalk view
ing the poster. ___

Canadian Officials Obtain Possession
of a Murderer.
SEATTLE, Wash.. Oct. 9.â Thomas
Allen, a colored man known as "Pegleg"
Allen, who Is alleged to be none other

prevent his escape and later killed
Police Officer Toohey at London, Ont.,
was taken across the border into British
Columbia last night by Deteotive Nickles
of London, Ont. Allen was arrested at
North Yaklma on Friday. The arrest and
the preparations to take him to Canada
were kept quiet in order that the Texas
authorities might not hear of it and re
fuse to permit him to be taken to Canada.

NEW YORK, Oct. 9.â The auxiliary

MAY TURN BACK
SPANISH CRUISER
Washington Likely to
Protest.
LATEST MOVE OF MADRID
WABSHTP SOON TO REACH THE
PHILIPPINES.
This Government May Request
Through France That Its Arms
and Ammunition Be Not
Landed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 9.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: It may be that the United
States will submit a diplomatic protest
to Spain through the French Govern -
ment against its action in sending a
Spanish auxiliary cruiser laden with
arms and ammunition to the Philip
pines. In any event the matter is un
der consideration, and, it is believed,
has been called to the attention of the
American commissioners in Paris.
The cruiser in question is the Buenos
Ayres, belonging to the Spanish auxil
iary, which. Rear Admiral Dewey re
ported to the Navy Department several
days ago, is due to arrive at the Sin
gapore Straits Settlement on October 13.
It is appreciated by the authorities that
Spain has the same right in the eyes
of international law to send reinforce
ments to the Philippines as this Govern.
ment has. and any protest made would
be of the most diplomatic character
and simply designed to make it plain
that a continuance of the voyage of the
Buenos Ayres is objectionable.
On the other hand a member of the
Cabinet to-night said that all of the
Philippines with the exception of Ma
nila are in nominal possession of Spain
and that it is her undoubted privilege
if she deems it advisable to do so to
send troops to the eastern islands to
subdue any insurrections that may oc
cur.
Another member of the Cabinet who
talked the matter over with the Presi
dent admitted that Spain had the moral
right to dispatch reinforcements to the
Philippines, but as the forces of this
Government were in control It was
within its authority to prevent such re
inforcements reaching their destina
tion.
However, it is expected that the mat
ter will not go beyond a protest if it
goes that fai\

CIVILIZING THE
AMERICAN INDIAN
What Is Accomplished
by Education.
SCHOOLS LARGELY ATTENDED
SAVAGES TRANSFORMED INTO
GOOD CITIZENS.
Commissioner Jones Reports tne
Progress Made in the Regen
eration of the Nation's
Wards.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 9.â The annual
report of Commissioner of Indian Af
fairs William A. Jones shows a gen
eral advancement in the condition of
the "nation's wards." Education, the
greatest factor in solving the status .if
the Indians, is being pushed forward
in the service, and now there are 147
well-equipped boarding schools and an
equal number .>f day schools engaged
in the education of 23,975 pupils. The
average attendance and enrollment has
steadily increased for the past twenty
one years. Vigorous inquiries show that
89 per cent of these pupils who have
gone through the schools and returned
to their homes are reported to be in
good physical condition, contrary to the
frequent suggestions that the change
might break naturally strong and vig
orous constitutions.
Of the pupils attending school 3 per
cent are reported as excellent or first
class; 73 per cent as good and medium,
while only 24 per cent are considered
bad or worthless, showing in the com
missioner's judgment the value of a
system which can in a generation de
velop from savages 76 per cent of good
average men and women.
Under the present regime the large
net decrease in enrollment and attend
ance of last year has been changed in
to a net increase of 1040 and 995, enroll
ment and average attendance, respect
ively, for the present year. The res
ervation schools show the largest gain.
Agents are now being urged to greater
exertions to fill the schools to the limit
of their capacity and future develop
ments, Mr. Jones predicts, will un
doubtedly emphasize that a regulation
enforcing compulsory attendance upon
the schools must be enacted. The plac
ing of Indian children in the publics
schools of the country for the purpose
of co-education of the races does not
appear to meet with much success, but
a fuller test of its value and practica-.
bility is to be mado this year.
The school plants in the service arÂ»
valued at over $3,000,000, and larger
funds for keeping them in repair are
urged. Out of the general school sup
port fund the Indian Office contem
plates the expenditure of a sufficient
sum to radically increase scholastic fa-.
cilities for the great tribes of the South-,
west, and to that end adequate addi
tions will be made to the schools now
established for the Pimas, Papamos,
Navajos, Moquis and Apaches; at Sac
ton, Fort Defiance, Keams Canyon, Sara
Carlos and Fort Apache.
Discussing the work of the commls*
sion to make allotments on the Un-Â«
compaghre Reservation, Utah, the corn*
missioner says it is believed many aU
lotments were made to Indians not oc-Â»
cupying the lands allotted and willing?
to remove to the Uintah Reservation,
and that authority for such allotments
is questioned as well as whether even,
the Indians In possession of the lands
can be allotted. Congress is asked to
legalize the allotments on the Uncom-*
pahgre Reservation made after April 1Â«
IS9B. to remove all doubt.
Referring to the torturing: and burn-*
ins of Seminoles in Oklahoma last Jan*
vary, the report says it is thought in-t
demnity will soon be paid by the Gov
ernment to all members of the Semlnola
nation injured by the mob of lawless
whites in that occurrence, and tha
whites guilty of the outrages are now*
being prosecuted.
No Trace of Dougherty.
GILROY, Oct. 9.â No trace has as yet
been found of Thomas Dougherty, the old
gentleman who wandered from his horn*
in Gilroy on Friday. Mayor Chesbro
summoned the citizens of the town andi
organized a searching party last evening.
Men have reached the adjacent county"
and the only clew found is that Dough
erty walked through Miller's vineyard
northwest of town, toward the Onslcy
bills. He has not been seen since and tli<i
greatest fears are entertained that ha
has taken his life. Marshal McElroy haa

SITUATION GROWS
OMINOUS ONCE MORE
Belief That the Supposedly Friendly-
Indians Are Joining Their
Warlike Tribesmen.
MINNEAPOLIS, Min-. Oct. Â».â A
al to the Tribune from Its staff
correspondent at Walker says: The
situation to-night is more ominous than
At the agency to-day n council
was held the Indians, General
Bacon, Colonel Â Jndian Agent
Sutherland and Marshal O'Connor. The
result of tl not in any
way like that previously held,

leading men of the different bandi
â¢ nt.
There were, however, representatives
n1 from Bear Island, ("its'; Lake,
Tall I'oint and Fmc Point, but
if these have any influence with
the tribesmen. The only conclusion to
be drawn Is that the leaders of the dif
- i:t men there merely as
stool pigeons, and that others of their
er are now preparing for the war
path.
A most significant fact is this: On
thirty canoe loads of Bear
and their families, pro
: g to be peaceful, arrived at the
agrem 5 . ry one of the bucks
in the party left, but whither they have
gone is only to be surmised. There is
littlo doubt, however, that they have
left for Bear Island to join those who
are already prepared to fight There
must be by this time several .hundred
armed men on the island, and from
what ran be learned to-day many more
are on the r . .ad.
Two or three of the Bear Island men
who are still on the agency have been
questioned in regard to last Wednes
day s battle, but they positively stated
that they knew nothing whatever in
regard to the dead and wounded among
the Indians, and had seen none of those
who were in the fight.
General Bacon answered that the last
council would be held on Monday and
the Indians dispersed.
DYING MAN CREMATED
IN A MISSISSIPPI CHURCH
Terrible Crirt)e Comn)ittecl to Prevent
the Spread of Yellow Fever at
at a Sn)all Inland Town.
JACKSON, Miss.. Oct. 9.â Dr. T. B. Harrison, health officer of Tallahatchle county, to-night makes a re
port to the State Board of Health of a grewsome tragedy near Philips, a small inland town Just over the line
in Le Flore county. I'nknrtwn parties, he reports, burned a dying white man in a church in which he had taken
refuge when attacked with a disease subsequently diagnosed as yellow fever by Dr. Harrison.
A white man. who was evidently a tramp, came into the neighborhood about four days ago. He attract
ed no attention, and was thought to have passed on through the town on his way to one of the stave camps
in the swamp counties. Yesterday morning he was discovered in a negro church in a dying condition. The
nearest physician was at once summoned, and immediately diagnosed the case as yellow fever. No one could
be persuaded to go near the dying man. The State Board of Health was at once wired to send an expert to
confirm the doctor's diagnosis. The tramp had been in the house alone for two days when he was discovered
by negmes going there yesterday to prepare for services to-day.
I >r. Harrison saw that the patient could not recover from the attack of fever. He did not anticipate the
end however, which soon came. Finding it impossible to get any one to stay with the man while he attended
to some necessary calls he was compelled to leave him alone for a few hours. When he returned the church
was in ashes and the body of the tramp had been consumed in flames. There was absolutely no clew to the
persons whose fear of the spread of infection impelled them to adopt this desperate remedy.
SAD HOME-COMING
OF THE McKINLEYS
Silent but Sympathetic
Welcome.
SCENES AT CANTON STATION
PRESIDENT'S WIFE BEARS UP
BRAVELY.
Family Views the Body of the Mur
dered Saxton â Arrangements
for the Funeral, Which
Will Be Private.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CANTON. Ohio, Oct. 9.â The home
coming of President and Mrs. McKin
ley to-day for the funeral of "Jeorge
' D. Saxton was attended with a most
touching and pathetic scene at the rail
way station.
Many people were at the depot when
the train arrived and extended the
party a silent but sympathetic wel
i come. The party arrived at 10:26
! o'clock. M. C. Barber, the President's
brother-in-law, was at the station with
several friends of the family and Dr.
Fauntfelter, who was railed to take
charge of Private John Barber, the sick
soldier.
President and Mrs. McKinley were
the first out of the oar and were assist
ed by George B. Freaz to the carriage
In waiting. Mrs. Barber, Mrs. McKln
ley's sister, followed and was joined by
her husband. John Barber was carried
from the train by his brother George
and by George C. Clark. Mips Helen
McKinley and Mr. and Mrs. Stewart A.
liowman of Loralne, the latter the Pres
ident's ni<->''-, who start, d with the party
from Washington, left the train at
Pittsburgh to take another road.
The President and party wont direct
to the Barber home, which is the old
Saxton homestead, and was the Canton
home of the McKlnleys during the
President's life in Congress. Mrs. Mi -
Kinley showed evidences of the Buffer
ings from the shock ana ol fatigue
from the journey, but bore up remark
ably well and was able to be about
the house.
Both slaters and the President viewed
the remains, which look natural,
none of the marks of the tragedy be
ing exposed on the face or features.
Except when the President, accompa
by Mr. Barber, took a short walk
the party remained at the Barber house
all day.
Many flowers are being received from
sympathetic friends of the President
and the family, Washington friends
having placed many on the train before
It started.
The funeral arrangements were con
cluded after the arrival <-t the party.
They nre to be held from the Barber
home at 2 o'clock Monday afternoon
and will be private. Rev. O. B. Milli
gan pastor of the First Presbyterian
church, will officiate, [nterment will
be In West Lawn Cemetery, in the Sax
ton family lot.
The train bearing the < ablpet and
other officials from Washington to the
omaha Exposition will arrive- in Can
ton Monday evening, and about 9 o clock
the private car of the President will
be attached thereto and he will join th<
party Mrs. McKin'ey, it is not thought
to-night will undertake the trip to
Omaha, but will be with the President
in Chicago. She will remain in Canton
for several days and more than likely
km to Chicago with Mrs. Lafayette Mc-
Williams and Mrs. W. A. Goodman, her
c.rasins who are expected to be here
for the funerai services.
The day brought no new develop
ments in the tragedy. Mrs. George re
mains in jail and has seen no on.- but
Mayor Rice during the day. He was
with her for five minutes. She is to be
arraigned at 10 o'clock Monday morn
ing. ThÂ» Coroner will resume the tak
ing of testimony Monday.
TEN THOUSAND TROOPS
TO BE SENT TO PARIS
Special Orders to Garrisons Near the
City to Send Five Hundred
Men Each.
PARIS. Oct. 9. â The Government has
issued special orders to the garrisons of
numerous towns near the capital to send
Immediately to Paris 500 infantry each.
All the tmops will be supplied with two
days' rations and sixty rounds of ball
cartridges.
The Journal dcs Debats claims that
these reinforcements will amount to I'j.
i>ni men. The paper expresses the hope
that the country is not on the eve of a
revolution.
To-day has passed off quietly. President
Faure, instead of visiting the races at
Longchumps, as he had intended, pru
dently remained to shoot at Kaoouuoi.,
thus avoiding a demonstration.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1898.
WILL TEST THE
POWER OF REA
Suit to Be Brqught by
a Teacher.
DEPOSED WITHOUT CAUSE
REFUSED TO SOLICIT VOTES FOR
THE GANG.
Miss Stockton Will Attack the "Clas
sification System" by Which
the "Boss" Controls the
Schools.
Social Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 9.â A suit will short
ly be brought in the Superior Court to
; test the validity of the section of the
, new charter which provides for a clas
sification committee to annually report
Upon the teachers of the various
schools. This committee is the agency
' through which Rea keeps teachers
â  within his power and causes them to
get out and work for gang votes dur
| Ing th^ campaign. It is a bugaboo to
! the average teacher, for those with the
: least bit of Independence or who re
fuse to serve Rea or the MacKenzles
are soon "classified" out.
The step to tÂ«-st this matter lg to be
taken by Mips Fannie Stockton, who
for many years was a teacher in the
Lowell Grammar School. Last June
she, with Minnie Simonda and Mrs. R.
B. Dunlap, were dropped from the de
partment without a word of warning.
Such prominent attorneys as Frank 11.
Gould, of San Francisco, and James 11.
Campbell, of this city, have taken up
(he young lady's fight, and the case
will be thoroughly ventilated in the
courts.
The classification committee that re
moved Miss Stockton was composed of
Trustees Graham and Kenyon. When
approached by friends of th<- teacher
for the reason of her dismissal the only
excuse they gave was that Rea had or
dered it done. They sa.id they knew
Miss Stockton to be a pood teacher and j
wanted to keep her in the department,
but Rea would not listen to their en
i reaties.
The classification committee report
that deposed Miss Stockton was adopt
ed a 1 a secret meeting of the Hoard of
Education that was called by Rea him-
At that time the committee pre
-â¢â ' i >d a printed list of all teachers in
th" department. Lines had been drawn
through the names of those Rea want
ed dropped. This report was not even
signed by the committee at that time,
nor even to this day has it been signed.
s tion 13 of Article IX of the char
ter, which provides for fh^ classifica
tion committee i? as follows:
The committee on classification shall
mnke themselves thoroughly acquainted,
by personal Inspection, with th<- work of
every employe of th*- lÂ»oÂ»ir<l. and it shn!]
he the duty' of this committee, at least
twenty days before the close of the
school year, to make a written report to
the hoard, stating what duties are being
irged by each employe and the na
ture of the service rendered. In this re
port they shall distinctly state what em
shall, in their opinion, be retained
for the ensuing year.
But this Is not all. The second par
agraph of Section 14, Article IX, pro
vides:
All teachers thus elected to permanent
positions in the department who are re
ported upon favorably by a majority of
the committee on classification, shall re
tain th<-ir positions for the ensuing year
without re-election, and shall be remov
able only for cause. No teacher shall be
removed from a position held in the
schools of the city, except by the votes of
four members of the board.
The last clause of this section was
wantonly violated. On the committee
report there was a tie vote. Trustees
Graham and Kenyon voting for it and
Wemple and O'Brien against.
All the teachers in the department
are deeply Interested in the suit, and
their sympathy, which they are obliged
lo express secretly in order to hold their
positions, is with Miss Stockton. The
young lady has hosts of Influential
friends, and these are insisting that the
;,,.Â»â¢ b* tested and she reinstated.
Her trouble arose because she refused
to get out and work for the gang dur
ing the late charter election.

GAGE'S STRENGTH
IN THE SOUTH
Gratifying Reports From
Seven Counties.
CONSERVATIVE PREDICTIONS
TEN THOUSAND PLURALITY
BELOW TEHACHAPI.
Alarmed Democratic Managers Call
Upon Maguire to Again
Tour Southern
California.
Special I>lsratch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 9.â The reports
from the seven southern counties of the
Stateâ Santa Barbara, Ventura, Or
ange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San
Diego and Los Angeles â ut the head
quarters of the Republican State Cen- I
tral Committee in this city are oi a j
generally encouraging nature.
They indicate that Gage is certain to j
carry all of the seven counties save Or- i
ange and Ventura, and that by proper i
effort he will win in those boroughs.
Judge Magulre and his frienas are j
not satisnea with the results accom- j
plished in this part of the State us h
result at his first tour, and It ha.s been ,
decided to bring the great single-tax
advocate again into Southern Califor
nia.
The second advent of Judge Magruire
will occur in the latter part of the cam
paign.
It seems that the Democratic leaders
are alarmed at the feeling among the
ranchers and farmers down this way
with regard to JudÂ«e Maguire's single
tax views and he will make the second
tour to explain more explicitly Ur them
what his poaitlon is and how bis elec
tion as Governor would affect the adop
tion of the single ta.\ in tfiis State.
The farmer this way has the Idea that
while Judge Magulre as Governor could
not in his individual official capacity
make the single tax a part <>f the law
of the State if he were elected the
single tax would be advanced as a
principle. This principle they do not
take kindly t". They disagree with
Judge Maguire's theories on the propo
sition and do noi desire a single-tax
agitation. For this reason many <>f
them will vote for Gage who otherwise
would not do bo.
Judge Maguire on his former visit to
this city stated publicly that he would
be perfectly willing If he were con
ducting an individual canvass to make
the single tax an issue. But. as he was
the head of a ticket which included
many other candidates who did not be
lieve as he did he could not follow his
own desires and openly advocate that
proposition from the stump.
Fusion will lose the Democratic State j
ticket in this Bection thousands of votes. I
Many Democrats will vote the straight
Republican ticket,while others will vote
only for the straight Democratic nomi- !
nees. This last element of the party
looks upon Judge Maguire as among the i
Populist nominees Inasmuch as his was
tin- lirst nomination made by the Popu- j
list State convention in July last, over
a month prior to the time the Judge
became the Democratic nominee.
The old-line Democrats, and they are
Bryan Democrats at that, are disgusted
with the fusion principle. They lc-ok
upon the alliance as an unholy one,
which detracts from the honor and dig
nity of the Democratic party, and, as
one of them very aptly put it:
"The only method we have to- cure
this disease is to cut away the proud
flesh. This we can do most effectively
by defeating the alliance from top to
bottom."
This vote Is going to Gage, and it
is going to materially assist him in
bringing a tally sheet to the Tehachapl
mountains which will indicate 10,000
plurality.
The Socialist-Labor party will go on
the official ballot, and by this Gage will
be a gainer In the seven southern coun
ties to the extent of several thousand
votes. Job Harriman is the candidate
of this party, and he comes from this
county. Every vote he receives is a
vote taken away from Magulre. He is
a radical reformer and an excellent
platform speaker. Twice he has
challenged Judge Magulre to a joint
debate, and twice has he been
refused. Mr. Harriman states that
he Is still willing and anxious to
debate the questions of the day with
Judge Maguire on the same platform,
but he does not think that the Judge
will give him the opportunity.
The Republican headquarters of the
Sixth Congressional District is in this
City. William Arthur is in charj;- .-f
the campaign being conducted by R. J.
Waters, the Republican who will after
March 4th next occupy the seat now
held by Charles A. Barlow. Arthur pre
dicts the election of Waters by 2000 ma
jority at a minimum. There is quite a
bolt among the Democrats as to Bar
low. His candidacy was forced upon
the Democracy this year and the price
paid was fusion on the State ticket.
This deal many Democrats are going to
resent by voting for Waters. The La
bor World and Silver Champion openly
expressed its disapproval of the candi
dacy of Barlow in its last issue.
Mr. Barlow has already commenced
his campaign in this county, but he has
not explained anything, and the result
is his name will not receive the X mark
opposite it on the ballot of hundreds of
Democrats.
ALGER EVADING
MAIN QUESTIONS
Fails to Satisfy the War
Investigators.
COVERS ONLY A FEW POINTS
DUMB ON THE SELECTION OF
CAMP SITES
Says Nothing of Suffering Endured
by Troops at Tampa â A Supple
mental Report Will Be
Called For.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Oct. 9.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald sends
the following:: Secretary Alger has sent
an answer to the War Investigating
Commission, which, in the words of one
of the commissioners to me to-night,
"does not answer."
"In the first place,'" said this com
missioner, "we asked who had been in
iluential in selecting the camp sites.
The only answer vouchsafed is that
General Lee selected the camp at Jack
sonville. I do not think any other camp
is mentioned; but this omission will no
di'Ubt be remedied In the supplemental
report for which we will call on Sec
retary Alper."
Secretary Alger's report, in addition
to the Jacksonville eamn matter, covers
only these points: Selection of Tampa
as a point of embarkation; Hear Ad
miral Sampson's disoatch the cause of
hastening troops to Santiago; Commo
dore Remy's spor.k dispatch the cause
of subsequent delay of the troops. Dis
cussion of these topics exhausts the re-
I port. No attempt seems to have been
j made to explain the causes of the hard
: ships suffered by the soldiers in Tampa.
Then the arraignment of Sampson
and Remy is approached with pomp
j and ceremony. As exclusively stated
i in the Herald two days ago, these dis
patches were so managed in Adjutant
General Corbin's report that they
should be emphasized before the com
mission. In the face of the subsequent
: denial of General Corbin, as reported,
comes practically a direct charge from
Secretary Alger th;it the very dispateh
1 quoted so significantly and triurnph
:ly are relied upon by Secretary Al
â  as the chief point of his defense.
"he < "inmissioner who talked with
failed to see how these dispatches
â¢ â  upon any alleged neglect except in
istant and perhaps irrelevant way.
What we want to know," said he,
why these men suffered, if they did
suffer, unnecessarily. We get no suffi
cient answer in the report."
Secretary Alger will be asked for a
fuller answer.
SHAFTER PLEASED WITH
.WHEELER'S TESTIMONY
NEW YORK, Oct. 9.â A Kalamazoo,
Mich., special to the Herald pays: Gen
eral Phafter has been here since last
Thursday, and will remain several days
visiting old friends and scenes of his
boyhood. Speaking of the work of the
War Investigating Commission, Gener
al Shafter said:
"General Wheeler's testimony before
the investigating committee is very
forcible and very convincing, but wait
until the line officers tell their stories.
They will not be as cautious as General
Wh.-Her, and will toll a story that will
not only corroborate General Wheeler,
but be much stronger.
"General Miles and others may say
that this commission is not legal. Per
haps not, but the testimony it Is bring
ing out will satisfy the public that the
stories paraded up and down he land
about neglect and starvation and need
less suffering of troops at Santiago have
been grossly exaggerated for political
purposes." _^_^__^^^^_^_^_

A prominent vocal instructor, living in one of the prosperous cities of
Connecticut, relates a curious experience: "In learning," she says, "to
properly place and sustain the tone, pupils sometimes feel a faintneea anddiz-
siness arising from the peculiar action of the diaphragm and the effort of con-
trolling of the breath. I have known a girl to actually have to sit down for
fear of fainting. I became convinced that the difficulty came from a weak
Stomach and talked with my physician about it. He was inclined to think
that I had the right solution of the trouble. Some time after that I, from
time to time, gave a Ripans Tabule to a pupil, suggesting that it be taken
before coming to the next lesson. The effect was precisely what I had hoped.'
. The pupils were relieved of the difficulty and able to take the full half hour of ;
vocal exercise without any of the old trouble. It seems a queer use to soaks

TRODE IN GOOD CONDITION.
NOTHING could be more auspicious than the
opening of the crop year of 1898-99. The early
and frequently recurrent rains have started the
green feed all over the northern part of the State and
promise a copious rainfall later on, though it is too
early yet to make rash predictions. California
winter weather is beyond human prediction, and it is
a common remark that the longer a man lives in the
State the less he knows about the weather. But thus
far the conditions are brilliant. True, some grapes
have been spoiled and some drying fruit has been
caught out in the wet here and there, but the aggre
gate benefit greatly outweighs these scattering draw
backs. There is a feeling of confidence all over the
State. Stocks of ail kinds of farm produce are light
and prices are good, and the lightness of supplies al
assures profitable returns for the coming sea
son's output. Country credits are accordingly on a [
sound basis, the farmers have lately regained much
of the ground lost during the past four or five years,
and the State seems to be entering upon a period of j
prosperity which bids fair to last for at least a year
longer.
General trade, however, is not especially active,
though it cannot be called actually dull. The bank
clearings of San Francisco, as frequently mentioned
of late, have been running behind for some weeks,
though the decrease has been small. As an offset to
this, however, the failures throughout the State have
been few, and as a rule confined to small concerns.
Money is in abundant supply at the usual rates of in
terest, and a good many old scores have been wiped
out by the farmers during the past year. Another
I year will greatly reduce the farming indebted
of the community. It is this condition more
than any other that creates the widespread feeling of
confidence mentioned above. We are essentially a
producing State, and anything that benefits the farmer
increases the commercial activity of all the cities and
s in the State. It is this condition upon which
we are new apparently entering.
But while the feeling in State produce, both rural
and urban, is firm, the outward movement of produce
and merchandise is rather slow. Canned fruits are
active and going to the East and Europe in large
quantities, but cereals, dried fruit and wool are slug
gish. Wine is doing rather better of late, and hops
are selling well at prices which net the grower good
returns. The local manufactories are running their
average force and putting out the usual amount of
goods at a fair profit on the investment, as shown by
the uniformity with which the monthly dividends are
declared. Trade, therefore, is in a normal condition,
and bids fair to continue so for some time to come.
The greatest activity, however, is exhibited by the
farmers, who. encouraged by the early rains and the
high prices for this year's produce, are seeding vast
areas and getting them in early. Generally the farmers
are apt to overdo a good thing, but this danger is
hardly probable this year owing to the extreme light
ness of stocks, which almost insures practically bare
markets next spring and summer.
In the East the conditions are tame and uninter
esting. The weekly commercial reports sing the
same old song of smaller failures, fluctuating bank
clearings, a lively iron market, extreme depression
in the wool trade, low-water prices for cotton, a
brisk distributive trade in the West and Northwest,
and an unsteady market for wheat. A gradually ex
tending yellow fever quarantine In the South has
checked business more or less in that section. Still,
the general aggregate 5s favorable, as the bank clear
ings show a small gain of 4.7 per cent over the same
week last year.
Wall street is having a period of tips and downs at
present. Speculation in railway shares has fallen off
lately, notwithstanding the increased earnings re
ported by most roads. The growing ease of the
money market has stimulated purchasing of bonds,
but neither this nor the continuance of gold imports
seems strong enough to revive the flagging spirits of
the speculative community. The industrial stocks,
notably tobacco and sugar, ruled soft all the week.
A noteworthy feature at present h the failure of
the colonial boom to pan out as expected a few weeks
ago. It may be that the public are cautious about un
duly rushing into investments in Cuba and the Phil
ippines, but at any rate not much is heard about
either of these propositions now. It takes vast
amounts of money to exploit these colonial schemes,
and perhaps the public have found it out. To be
sure, many Antillean enterprises have been floated,
but not to the extent anticipated during the war,
when the excited American imagination pictured a
wholesale rush to Cuba and Luzon immediately after
the cessation of hostilities. It may be, however, that
capital is waiting for the consummation of actual
peace, for it must be remembered that the present sit
uation is merely a cessation of hostilities and that
peace itself yet remains to be declared. So the ex
rected rush may occur later, though there is cer
tainly very little enthusiasm shown about it at the
moment.
THE PARTIES AND THE NATION.
AN illustration of the striking contrast between
the attitudes of the two great political parties
of the country was given recently in the re
ports from the East, one containing the letter of
Roosevelt, who speaks for the Republicans, and the
other the plank of national issues adopted in the plat
form of the Democratic State Convention in Massa
chusetts.
Mr. Roosevelt, after pointing out that national
problems are paramount this year, and that "it is not
more possible to conduct a State election now with
out regard to national issues than it was possible so
to conduct one in 1861 or 1863," went on to say:
"The issues for honest money, for protection to
American industry, for the upbuilding of a merchant
marine adequate to carry our commerce with the
world, and to form a naval militia in times of war,
are as vital this year as they were in the great cam
paign of 1896. Moreover, we must strengthen our
navy and build up our army so that they may bo
equal to meet every demand made upon them."
In that statement is outlined a broad and compre
hensive scheme of national policy. It is a platform
that appeals to patriots. Its purposes include the
grandeur of the nation and the welfare of industry.
It is addressed to no mean passion or prejudice,
nor is it designed to excite class antagonisms. On
the contrary, its promises are for all the people and
for all sections of the Union. All loyal hearts can
respond to it and loyal votes be given for it.
Now note the contrast in the sentiments of the
opposite party. The Democrats of Massachusetts in
their State platform declare: "The military adminis
tration during the recent war has been a stigma on
the history of the republic and a disgrace to civiliza
tion. The army which sprang into existence has been
made the prey of incompetents and favorites, who
have fattened on the sorrows of the American sol
diers. The brave men who fought our battles in the
West Indies were left without adequate food, medi
cine or surgical assistance. '
In that declaration there is nothing but falsehood
and folly. At the very time it was being prepared for
submission to the Democratic convention General
Wheeler was in Washington giving testimony before
the War Investigation Commission and saying that
the stories of suffering were exaggerated, there had
been no neglect, that the hardships had been only
such as are inevitable in a campaign hastily made,
and that the spirit of the army was such there was no
disposition to complain.
The issue before the people is whether the affairs
of the Government shall be committed to the charge
of a party with a broad national policy, or to men
who have no policy save that of denouncing and
maligning the administration and the army. Are
we to have statesmen in Congress or a wild set of
calamity howler?'
TEACHING HATRED.
BAILEY of Texas, the Democratic leader in the
House of Representatives, has been making
himself very busy during the campaign and has
apparently started out to stump the Union. It seems
from the tenor of his speeches that he is by no
means satisfied with the way tilings are going, and is
hurrying all around the country in an endeavor to
get his party and its leaders into decent shape.
One of the things to which he objects most stren
uously is the tendency of the time to align political
parties along lines of sectional interests and class an
tagonisms. Thus he is reported to have said in his
speech at Indianapolis: "My countrymen, no crime
is greater in this beloved country of ours than the
crime of those narrow and bigoted politicians who
testify their love of country by trying to teach their
countrymen to hate each other "
The language of the statement is somewhat strong,
but there is no questioning the soundness of the sen
timent. Mr. Bailey is doubtless well aware that it is
his own party, or at least its chosen representatives,
who are most persistent and most outrageous in their
efforts to arouse class antagonisms.
As a full report of the speech has not reached us,
we cannot be certain to what particular set of poli
ticians Mr. Bailey wr.s referring when he made it,
but it sounds very much like a condemnation of the
whole Bryanite clique who took possession of the
Democratic party in 1896 an<? are now running it as
a species of Populism without the sincerity which
animated the original Populist movement.
If Bailey had made his speech in California the pas
sage quoted would have been recognized at once and
by everybody as a rebuke to Maguire. That candi
date of the fused factions is the most conspicuous
representative on this coast of the class of "narrow
and bigoted politicians who testify their love of coun
try by trying to teach their countrymen to hate each
other." He is the man who, in this community, next
after the Examiner, is the most persistent force tend
ing to stir up strife between what he and the Exam
iner call "the clashes and the masses."
It is gratifying tint the leader of the Democratic
party in the House of Representatives has perceived
the danger to the nation and the disaster to his own
party that exists in that form of campaigning. It is
to be wished he will have the courage to live accord
ing to the new light that has dawned upon him. If
he made his Indianapolis speech with any intent of
heading oft Altgeld and other agitators of class strife.
we fear he has entered upon a forlorn hope; but if
it is to be construed merely as a sign of his own re
pentance, he may yet prove to be a useful member
of Congress, not to h.13 district only, but to the whole
Unton.
THE SCHOOL LUMBER STEAL.
THE Grand Jury is said to have satisfactorily es
tablished the fact that certain contractors, act
ing by authority of the Board of Education,
have succeeded in stealing 500,000 feet of lumber
from the School Department. Or, to state the case
in more technical language, that the board has paid
for that number of feet which was never delivered â
a method of stealing adopted by the contractors as
mere convenient than actually hauling the lumber to
the schoolhouses and then carting it away.
But the jury is unable to indict anybody. It knows
the names of the guilty parties; it can, in fact, put
its hand on the School Directors who are responsible
for the theft, and it could at a moment's notice hale
the rascally lumber dealers into court. The District
Attorney, however, advises that while the evidence
upon which the jury might act shows malfeasance in
office or conspiracy to defraud, no indictment can be
found because both these offenses are misdemean
ors and not punishable by indictment or information.
So the Grand Jury is going to content itself with a
report to Presiding Judge Belcher in which it will
''roast" the culprits.
At this juncture it cannot fail to occur to an out
sider that an important question remains to be an
swered. If the luniber thieves of the School Depart
ment cannot be indicted or prosecuted by informa
tion, what is the matter with somebody arresting
them for misdemeanor? Malfeasance in office is
cognizable by the Superior Court, and a conspiracy
to defraud may be tried before a jury. Why pause
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAKL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 10, 189s.
at a report which can result in nothing but smoke?
The School Department ring will laugh at such a
fulmination, while a warrant in the Police Court
might turn its humor into consternation.
The offense committed by the conspirators of the
School Board is especially grave because it has been
consummated in the sacred name of education.
These men have stolen money devoted by the pub
lic to the education of the children of the people, and
they have committed the crime while discharging a
trust which ought to bring with it the highest moral
responsibility. They are, therefore, worse than or
dinary thieves. Indeed, stopping stages is respectable
business compared with stealing the money of school
children.
If the Grand Jury knows the names of the villains
It should swear out warrants for their arrest at once.
It would be some satisfaction to land them, if only
for a few minutes, among the fleas and cockroaches
which infest the City Hall police station. Their
"pull" would probably soon get them out, but the
mark of disgrace would be placed upon them. That
might not trouble them much, but it would perhaps
discomfit them for a few minutes at least
ELECT REPUBLICAN SUPERVISORS.
THE men named by the Republicans for Super
visors have the peculiar advantage of not hav
ing been selected by Phelan, or any other boss.
They are strong, clean men, such as would be above
forming "Solid Eights" or "Solid Nines" for the loot
ing of the city. They have also for the most part
the added advantage of not having been indorsed by
the Non-Partisan partisans, a clique oi the dis
gruntled too cowardly to make open war, and given
to stabbing in the back. They can be serenely secure
in the knowledge that the Phelan-Fitch sideshow
management has not presumed to trot them out as
exhibits. To this circumstance they owe a part of
their strength.
The fact cannot be brushed aside that the present
Board of Supervisors is made up of men selected by
Mr. Phelan. That it is a rotten and incompetent
body there will be no denial. Even the maker of
it became disgusted and tried to oust it. It has read
ily adapted itself to every opportunity to create a
scandal and line its pockets. The few good members
are over-ridden by the bad. Against the reputation
of Lackmann there has been no word. He has met
the opposition of the Mayor. For once the potency
of the executive failed. So loud was the clamor for
the re-election of this gentleman that the Mayor had
to consent to his receiving a place on the ticket. Thus
he appears on the Republican list and both the Dem
ocratic lists. It is as a Republican he will be elected.
The Democrats merely want to steal thunder. When
there is nothing else in sight, they will steal thunder.
Voters should follow the plan of making a cross
after the name of every Republican nominee for Su
pervisor. There is too much at stake to admit of any
scratching. The city has had one Phelan board. It
wants no more. It cannot afford to have any more.
It must display regard for its reputation, as well as
for its purse.
BOSSES AND MONGRELS.
CHARLES J. BONAPARTE of Baltimore in a
recent review of the many serious objections
to the annexation of the Philippine Islands di
rected attention not only to the incapacity of the
mongrel races of the islands to administer their own
affairs, but to the evil effects which would result from
the attempt to apply our system of boss politics to
the government of such races.
In the course of his review he said: "Imagine our
own old 'ring' or the worthies of the 'Anti-Civil Ser
vice JLeague' set to rule over millions of poor, ignor
ant, half-savage Malays thousands of miles from
home and with no one to either discover or punish
their enormities except the same politicians who had
given them their places in return for dirty work!
Such an administration would constitute a veritable
political Sodom, fit to call down fire from heaven.
And yet no one can reasonably doubt that such men
and none other would be chosen to govern any such
dependency. A little island like Guam, a wilderness
such as Alaska was, might be allowed by Congress to
have for a time a purely military and therefore fairly
honest and efficient government, but it would be an
idle dream to think that our 'statesmen* could keep
their eager fingers out of such a dish as the patronage
attendant on the government of eight or ten millions
of people! To expect this would be as absurd as to
hope for a Congress of honest men."
The soundness of that statement is beyond dispute.
Once the Philippine Islands arc under the control of
the United States it will not be possible to keep them
long under the supervision of the army as military
colonie3. The spoilsmen of politics will demand
that the offices in the islands be included among the
spoils that go to the victor.
The Philippines would become a place where the
bosses would put up the most pliant of their push and
pull. The government would be a mixture of ring
sters and mongrels, and the result would be a cess
pool of corruption in comparison with which any
thing produced by boss rule among our own commu
nities would be like the sweet fields of Arcady.
Hopeful Barry, wiping the honest expectoration
from his countenance, remarks that the new-born
labor papers are to be shunned like so many rattle
snakes. The allusion to rattlesnakes is unfortunate.
Not very long ago the same gentleman said the
militia of Pennsylvania ought to be killed like rattle
snakes. A little later, when these same Americans
passed through this city on the way to Manila, no
body manifested any desire to slay them, and even
the Barry hand was stayed. When they made a gal
lant stand under Spanish fire the idea that they ought
to be killed failed to flash through the American
mind. In fact, when Barry has snakes he should not
put his tremens on exhibition. The spectacle tends
to show that he is as well equipped for service in Con
gress as a cow for skating.
It is thoughtless of the Star to say the city is being
bunkoed in the matter of the lease of a cyclery for
police purposes. The entire deal has been engineered
by sundry gentlemen whom Mayor Phelan insisted
must be placed on the Board of Supervisors and the
School Board.
The gentlemen arranging the peace banquet at
Chicago have generously excluded California wines,
but unless watched closely they will manage to work
in a course of local bacon and decorate the tables
with cubes of pressed beef bearing the brands of lead
ing citizens.
Barry says Phelan has made an ideal Mayor, and
Phelan thinks Barry would make an ideal Congress
man. The beautiful manner in which these opinions
dovetail is one of the most pleasing coincidences of
the campaign.
Spain might as well conclude now as later that the
United States Government has no intention of pay
ing for territory which it ha 9 gone to the trouble to
win by force of anna.
IRRIGATION
OF ARID LANDS
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 9, 1898.
Editor San Francisco Call: I received
with my mail at my home last Sunday
a copy of The Call of the 27th of Sep
tember marked "X," which I was glad
to get, as it contained the editorial,
"Better than Imperialism," comment
ing on the enormous benefits that
would result from the irrigation of the
arid lands of the West. I almost al
ways get The Call, but sometimes when
I am away in the interior I miss it. and
I would esteem the favor very highly
if you would have a copy sent to me
containing any editorial matter relat
ing to irrigation.
It occurred to me in reading this edi
torial that it might perhaps have es
caped your notice when you said "the
proposition of course does not come
within the domain of practical politics,"
that it really does in this campaign in
California, and I have been rather sur
prised that so little attention has been
given to this great subject in the cam
paign. The Republican party is the
only one which has pledged its repre
sentatives in Congress to a national
policy which would result in the con
struction of Federal storage reservoirs
and the utilization of the wasted water
supplies of California and the reclama
tion of the arid public domain.
A few days ago I received a letter
from Dr. Clarke Gapen, now of Madi
son, Wis., who was formerly for a num
ber of years the superintendent of the
Illinois Hospital for the Insane at Kan
kakee, 111., and while there made some
Very successful experiments on quite
a large si'ale to show the Increased
production of lands in the humid re
gions by what he calls the supplemen
tary Irrigation. In his letter to me he
says:
"Less than a year ago I was asked
by the principal of one of the schools
of Chicago to look over a group of
childi en afflicted with various forms of
nervous disease. A more pitiable spec
tacle I never looked upon, and what
made it especially so was the fact that
in th<"> whole group there was nut a sin
gle case which was not due to lack of
air and food. Not a single one of the
could be helped in the least with
out fr.-sh air and good food, and these
were both Impossibilities to these poor
creatures, innocent of all misdoings for
which they could be paid to be responsi
ble. We <an never Justly claim to be
civilized while these things be. The
Government ought to make habitable
the present waste places and put thou
sands of those poor sufferers on them.
Can we not do this as well as to spend
th^ thousands we are spending on alien
races? I believe in uplifting charity to
all mankind, but home is a good begin
ning place."

Th|E UNITED
LABOR PARTY
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir:
In the issue of The Call of even date
there appears an article headed, "Ticket
Refused Filing." It refers to an at
tempt made by one James Smiley, to
Impose upon Registrar Biggy. The
simple truth is that this alleged United
Labor party as represented by Smiley
has no existence in fact, but was en
deavoring to usurp the rights of an
other party which has labored hard
and long in the interests of labor, and
has been recognized throughout the
State for more than a decade.
As you have given so much space to
the Smiley episode we beg leave to
make reply so that our nominees and
the main body of the voters may fully
understand our true status.
The United Labor party of Califor
nia has filed its State ticket and con
templates the filing of its municipal
ticket at an early date. Permit me
through the columns of your paper to
pay that Mr. Smiley has nothing to do
with this organization nor had he any
authorization to act from our State or
County Commltee. It will be danger
ous for another fak-T to undertake a
similar trick. Futhermore, in this
mm-nine's issue of your paper appears
an official draft of the State ticket to
be voted at the coming election in No
vember. By what I take to be a typo
graphical error the name of P. B. Gal
lagher appears as the nominee of the
Socialist Labor party for Superinten
dent of Public Instruction.
P. B. Gallagher is the nominee of
the United Labor party for the office
named, and has received no other nom
ination or indorsement.

AN ISSUE
IS WANTED.
Editor of The Call: "Wanted by the
â  ratio party â An issue for this cam
paign,"
The above, signed hy the Democratic
State Central Committee, should be in
serted in all the public prints of Califor
nia from now until election day.
It is very evident that the Democracy
of California is without an issue, and
perhaps by the means above suggested
some Democratic Cromwell or Joan of
Arc may bring forth that which James
O. Maguire and the Examiner have beea
endeavoring to manufacture.
Maguire and a hust of other Democratic-
Populist, Silver-Republican and any-old
thlntf spell-binders, as well as the Ex
aminer, have been circulating about the
State telling the people that the single
tax question is not an issue In this cam
paign. All right, it isn't.
Now as to the railroad question. Mr.
Maguire says that is an issue. For the
sake of argument, I will admit that/
Ax if to prove the fact, the Examiner
placet; before its readers, in black type
(as U' to make up for the common sense
which it lacks) a long article on the ques
tion.
Notwithstanding the fact that Senator
John T. Morgan and other eminent Dem
ocrats have declared that the refunding
bill has been satisfactorily disposed of,
the Examiner finds it necessary to devote
half a pase of its space to the same old
anti-railroad. anti-Huntington cry, and,
as if to clinch the argument, the article
says: "Suppose Maguire were defeated
and a Legislature elected to send a Hun
tington man to the Senate, how about
San Pedro harbor?" Too bad. The writer
of that article should be informed that
the San Pedro harbor matter was settled
in a manner satisfactory to the people of
California at the last session of Con-
Toward the end of this article the
writer says something about anarchy in
the event of Mngulre's defeat. I would
advise the gentleman that the less said
in a Maguire paper about anarchy the
better it will be for Maguiro.
Truly, the fusion job-chasers are sadly
in need of an issue. Be charitable. Mr.
Editor. Have the first sentence of this
communication printed amonp your want
ads. WILL L. OVERSTREET.

Call a communication headed "A Non-
Partisan Piece Club"' and signed "A For
mer Non-Partisan." A few words in re
ply. The convention just closed was the
fourth since the Non-Partisan party was
called into existence, at which time both
national parties were dominated by cor
rupt political bosses. It is a well-known
fact that the gentlemen composing the
Non-Partisan convention are men with
established reputations, many of them
men of wealth and heavy tnxpnA-ers, to
whom it is most ridiculous to apply the
epithet of "Piece Club." Your correspond
ent, claiming to have been an active
member of the organization, should know
these facts from association. What mo
tive induces him to distort the truth and
vilely insinuate and apply the term
"Piece Club" to an organization whose
members net only give their valuable
time for the sole object of improving the
political condition of our municipal af
fairs, but in addition assess themselves to
pay the expenses of these conventions,
meeting- promptly all claims, andof which
an accurate record has been preserved
and is open for the closest inspection by
any citizen who has a;i interest In doing
so? The Non-Partisan party stands for
the best interests of this city. It is not
dominated by any man or set of men.
Kvery member is his own "boss-." We
simply make use of the American privi
lege of meeting and associating for clean
politics, using no undue influence, but
leaving to the good judgment of the
voter to approve our recommendations.
The motive, therefore, of your corre
spondent cannot be other than a vicious
one, having for its origin some persona,
grievance. The attempt to belittle the
writer by slurring insinuations is be
neath my notice. To the charge that I
am interested In church work, moral re
form and good government I plead
puilty C. B. PERKINS.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Tickers Sons & Maxim at Barrows
have got a contract from the Japanese
Government to build a battle-ship of lo,ouo
tons for $4,650,000. _
Italy will use Belleville boilers in the j
ships 'under construction and will also in- ;
stall them in some of the older vessels in
which the old boilers have given out.
The Almirante Brown, armored ship of \
4200 tons belongs to Argentina, and ;
built in ISM by Samuda at PpPjax, mar
London, was the tirst armored ship built ;
of steel and also the first vessel in which j
steel-faced armor was placed.
The military fighting top on shlps-of
war appears to be going out of fashion,
â¢in the French navy the tops have been
removed from tweny-flve ships and low- i
ered in seven. In the British navy there (
have been thirteen removals and nine low- ,
erlngs. Italy has discarded the tops in
four ships. Russia has done likewise in
two vessels, and in the Japanese and
Spanish navies the tops have been lowered
from their elevated heights down to on a
line just above the conning towers on two
and three ships, respectively.
According to Lord Brassey's statement !

The averages appear very fair, but in |
the absence of conditions and distances j
under which the hits were made are some
what unsatisfactory.
M Lockroy. Minister of Marine, is j
greatly pleased with the results of the tar- j
get practice of the battle-ships Brennus,
Jeauregiiiberry, Charles Martel and Ma
genta and .the cruisers Chauzy and Gali
lee, which took place last month off Tou
lon. The old floating battery Arrogante,
built of iron in 1864, protected with 44 S 8
inches of iron, served as a target at a dis
tance of about two miles from the tiring- I
ships, and was sunk in less than fifteen i
minutes. The French squadron fired live
hundred projectiles, ninety of which were j
of 13V2-inch caliber. The total number of !
hits were 30 per cent, a very high percent
age, and M. Lockroy claims that the skill
of French naval gunnery is superior to
that of the Americans, as In the battle off
Santiago only 3 per cent were hits. The
comparison under such dissimilar condi- j
tions is hardly fair, for In the Santiago
affair it was a running fight with varying j
distances and a return fire from the flee- j
ing enemy. At Toulon the distance was
known to exactness, and the firing was at
an inanimate object and the skillful grun
ners on the six ships had no occasion to
get nervous, as there were no return
shots.
It is nearly two years since the British
cruisers Terrible and Powerful passed
through their steam trials. The latter ship
steamed to China and failed to make a.
record, and It Is only quite recently that
the alleged troubles with her engines have
been remedied and she is claimed to be as
fast as Intended. The Terrible has not as
yet had a foreign commission, but has
been undergoing overhaulings and passed
through trials since January, 1597, and is
now at last claimed to come up to the an
ticipations of the admiralty. The trials
have been quite severe, including 1 sixty
hours at sea under 15.000 horsepower, sixty
hours under 18,000, eight hours under 22,000
and lastly four hours under 25,000 horse
power. The eight-hour trial on a mean
draught of 2S feet 6 inches, or eighteen
inches over the normal draught, resulted
In 23,053 horsepower and a speed, by log, of
2ii. 7 knots. The boilers carried 235 pounds
of steam and the revolutions worked up to
a mean of LO4.S. Two days afterâSeptem
ber 15 â the shin passed through her four
hours' trial in the channel under fu!! pow
er. Unfortunately a heavy fog interrupted
the trial, and on the second attempt she
was equally unfortunate. It was. how
ever, thought expedient to take the means
of the results of the two interrupted
trials, which gave 25,112 horsepower and a
speed of 21.9 knots by log.* The steam was
at 235 pounds and the revolutions 108.57.
The ship was down to a mean draught of
88 feet I - Inches, making her displacement
luarly in*) tons over the normal draught
capacity. As compared with the results
In January, 1897, the ship was then down
to 27 feet, the engines developed 25.572
horsepower and the speed was logged at
22.41 knots. The recent performance shows
a falling off of 460 horsepower and a re
duction In speed of .31 knots, the latter
being probably due to the increased dis
placement of the ship or, perhaps, to the
vagaries of the log. While the two mon
ster cruisers cannot be termed as failures,
yet it is entirely unlikely that they will
', be duplicated.

A Large Audience Listens to the Fa
mous Hindoo's Discourse on the

An Interested audience that filled every
chair in Odd Fellows' Hall last evening
listened to the lecture of J. C. Chattergl,
Brahmacharin, upon the "S
ml."
Tho lecture nf the Bramacharln was
of twofold Interest. The subject matter,
thouprh consisting of the same tenets as :
the theosophicaJ <-ult, that twenty-three
years of exposition have made familiar
to many, was handled In so skillful a
manner that the broadest possibl*
struction was obtainable, while the per
fect mastery of English which the Hindoo ,
displayed urn! tl â¢â  â  rquisite periods with
which he punctuated his theme, held the j
attention of his audience for a full hour, j
The point of the Bramacharin'a
themp upon which he spoke at greatest
' length was the relation of man to the
ersal cosmos, the stupendous sys
tem of vibrations that, acting upon the
the objects
that pass before the eye and works oul
the life and destiny of every one. "No

suppress this eveil," said Mr. Frawley yes
terday. "It is a most trying thing for an
actor to speak his lines with his auditors

that disconcert him. It Is sufficiently dif

being troubled in this manner. San Fran

is, if anything, a greater offender. I at
tribute the evil solely to the people who
attend the theaters from a distance.

AUXILIARY FLEET
WILL BE MAINTAINED
Needed for Service in the Weet Indies
and Our Possessions in
the Pacific.
NEW YORK, Oct. 9.â Tho "Washington
correspondent of the Herald telegraphs:
Secretary Long has determined to retain
in service all of the auxiliary vessels
which were bought before and during the
war. This decision Is due to the necessity
of maintaining a fleet of small vessels
which can be of service In Cuban, Porto
Rican, Hawaiian and Philippine waters
after the treaty of peace shall have been
sig-ned. The report of tho Higpinson
board recommended the sale of some
twenty-five vessels and the recommenda
tion submitted by Captain Crowinshield
suggests that seventeen of the vessels be
sold.
Secretary' Long has directed the sale of
the old monitor Wyandotte. which was
built in I^2 at Cincinnati, 0., and which
was used as a coast derense vessel dur
ing the war with Spain. The Wyandotte
-.: at League island and the depart
ment officials say that she can be of no
further service as a man-of-war. The
cost of the hull and machinery of the
Bhip was $633,327 and since the civil war
comparatively few repairs have been
made. It is said that she will be bought
;md used in the future as a coal hulk.
PRESIDENTIAL PARTY
BOUND FOR OMAHA
An Elaborate Special Trnn Leaves
Washington To-Day â War He
roes Also En Route.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 9.â The special
train which will carry the Presidential
party to Omaha, where they will be the
guests of honor of the Trtuis-MissiÃslppl
Exposition, leaves here at 9 a. m. to
>W over the Pennsylvania to Chi
cago. The President and Mrs. MoKinley
will join the party at Canton. Those leav
ing here will be Secretary and Mrs. Gage,
Secretary and Mrs. Alge'r, Postmaster
General and Mrs. Emory Smith, Secretary
Bliss, Secretary and Mies Wilson, Assist
ant Secretary Melkle.iohn, Secretary Por
ter, Secretary Cortelyou, Mr. and Mrs.
W. N. Babcnok. The train will be an ex
ceptionally handsome one, composed of
comers who have dined not always wisely.
Many persona sitting in boxes have
proved unbearable, and I have had on
occasions to send an usher to quiet them.
Thi y are given to commenting audibly on
the persons on the stag* .
"Reverting to the incident of Saturday
night's performance reminds me of a
quarrel I once had with Y\"iiton Lackaye
on the same lines. The epilogue fell to
him to deliver. He started it properly,
and in the midst of thr confusion he con
cluded it with : 'The epilogue is for over
shoes and umbrellas.' This threw me
completely out of my lines, and I had to
whistle for the curtain to descend."
"The foundation of all this trouble,"
said Manager Alt' Ellinghouse of the
Comedy Theater yesterday, "lies in the
fact that the people know when the close
of a play draws near. This is usually
foreshadowed in the reconciliation of the
stage, lover. The auditors' first thoughts
are to get away, and they spoil the finale
for those who do not know the denoue
ment. People are naturally selfish
and give no heed to the discomfort they
may cause others.
"This condition is not peculiar to San
Francisco, but obtains all over America.
The evil of late coming has not troubled
us, as we made a rule at the opening of
the theater that no one was to be seated
during any act while the curtain was up.
This does away with the slamming of
seats and with the inconvenience of per
sons already seated. It would be a no
table advance if the people would lend
their efforts to the correction of these
twin abuses."
Manager S. H. Frledlander, who has
just returned from an extended Eastern
trip, says San Francisco is not the only
offender. "This is an evil that managers
throughout the world have grappled with. !
Germany is the only country free from
the complaint. It applies to churches as
well as theaters. Some weeks since I was
in the Mormon Tabernacle In Salt Lake
City. There were over 7000 people present |
and fhfy made, a grf-at noise getting out \
during tho benediction. It was the snme,
in a tabernacle In this city last Sunday
night."
The result of Mr. Frawley'p efforts to
abate this nuisance in the theaters will
be awaited with Interest. It affects a
major portion of theater-goers, who I
would gladly see his crueado prove a sue- j
cess.

CALIFORNIA'S CLAIM
FOR WAR EXPENSES
Officers Arrive at Washington With
the State's Bill Against
the Government.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 9.â General A. W.
Barrett and Colonel J. F. Kurpln of San
Francisco, hearers of Governor Budd's
ebilm ntrninpt the Government for â¢
ments, etc., furnished by the State of Cali
fornia in t lie war with Spain, arrived
here to-day. They will call at the \\";ir
Department to-morrow and present the
claim to the adjutant general, who will
rei<-r it to the auditor of the War De
partment.
As California's claim Is quite a way
down on the list. It would under ordinary
circumstances be some time before it
could be considered, but General Barrett
has taken every precauton to have the
claim of his State meet every require
ment of the Government. One preat
cause of the delay in auditing the claims
of the several States has been due to fail
ure to have proper receipts accompany
the Items of expenditure. General Bar
rett brings receipts for every dollar ex
pended, and It is believed this' will greatly
expedite the allowance of the claim. Cal
ifornia was more energetic than any
other State in having her troops mus
tered in, there being in one instance not
more than two days between the enroll
ment of troops and their muster In.
The claim to be presented, amounting
to something like $170,000, does not in
clude the nay of the men and officers
while in the .Niate service. While the
claim was being prepared the question of
rate of pay was a mooted one. The au
ditur of the War Department had held
that men between the date of enrollment
an . mustering in could only be allowed
the same pay as when regularly in ser
vice. The Comptroller of the Treasury
has recently net aside this ruling, and
California soldiers will be paid $2 per day,
the rate ilxed by the statutes of the
State. The officers, not having been mus
ter. -<1 In until two days after the Califor
nia soldiers, their pay claims will be rela
tively greater.
Asphyxiated by Gas.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 9.â Edward Le
may, a nephew of Victor Lemay, foreman
in the railroad shops here, was asphyxi
ated by gas in his room this morning.
The man with whom he hoarded detected
the odor of gas as he was going to his
work early, and, linding the burner from
which it was escaping, turned it off and
went away without awakening Lemay,
not thinking of the latter's danger.
WHY HE REFUSED TO PAY.
"One dollar, please," said the clair
voyant.
"Not much," he replied; "I'll not pay
you a cent."
"Do you think I reveal the future for
nothing?"
"I don't care anything- about that.
You told me I was to marry three
times, and I don't propose to put a
premium on bad news." â Chicago

COMMODORE
WATSON ON
WAR TOPICS
Praise for the Men in
His Command.
SCHLEY AGAINST SAMPSON
DISAPPOINTMENTS IN HIS LATE
CAREER.
The Commander of the Blockading
Squadron Tells of the Tedious
Life in Patrolling the
Cuban Coast.
As Commodore John C. Watson, the
new commandant of the Mare island
navy yard, appears now. crowned with a
ribbon of bandage and his finger sv.
in linen, be looks like a hero returning
from the wars. It does not make the
heart of the commander of the blockad
ing squadron glad when one Bpeaka of
the battle's roar or tl ' : ' the
great guns, for he was in the late war but
not of it as far as actual fighting is con
cernedâand this is what stings.
â¢^d in a lai irtable chnir at
the Cosmos Club yesterday afternoon the
commodore spoke freely of his trying la
an roast, bis disappoint
ments and the glory of American arms.
He said:
"You pee, I have my head bandaged as
If I had Just gone through an action on
dock. No. there is no glory attached to
these â¢â â  They nre all due to a rail
road accident which you have no doubt
heard of. But it Is of no consequen<
Commodore Watson loves to linger over
the results "of the war, especially the
deeds of his friends Schley, Dewey and
Sampson. Continuing he said: "1 have
been most unfortunate in not having been
at the front where the lighting was done.
My labors were in establishing the block- j
ade about Havana and it proved very te
dious and tires before we were re
lieved. The work was of such a sort as
to prey upon the minds of the men. The
voting officers with their hearts and their
thoughts in the places where the fighting
was going on. chafed under the rigid and
severe routine of the blockade. It was
quiet action under a stress and they
longed for the boom of battle. For them
and the green men who came under my
charge 1 can say nothing but words of un- [
stinted praise. The men who came from
the Naval Reserves were practically green
seamen, yet they displayed a great will
ingness to learn and they did learn in a
very short time. There were young men
from all the -walks of life in my fleet and
there never was an instance of dissatis
faction or of recalcitrancy. They con
ducted themselves like true seamen and
true Americans."
It is with regret that Commodore Wat
eon speaks of the altercation between tho
friends of Schley and the friends of
Sampson. In regard to this difficulty the
commodore said: "Nothing Is to be re
fretted so much as these foolish disputes.
I know both men well; Schley and myself
are most intimate friends and our fami
lies are likewise. I am positive that the
appointment which Sampson received was
not of his own seeking. He was selected
by the Navy Department and there was
nothing left for him but to obey. He is a
man of ability and merit and was deserv
ing of the high honor bestowed upon him.
Schley practically was in command at
the time of the destruction of Cervera's
fleet and he won the laurels of victory as
well as Sampson. Really, I think of this
question only with regret, for I know of
the true worth of both men and that
Sampson was not at fault.
"Oh. yes, the one transcendent hero of
the war Is Dewey. His entrance into the
harbor in the stillness and gloom of
night, running the dangers of a mined
port; his plan of attack, all things taken
together, make him a naval tighter who
has no comparison. I remember him as a
young man at Annapolis, two grades
above me. He then had the reputation
of a hot-headed youth with a most un
governable temper. Why, he would fly
Into a rage at a moment, but it was not
very long after when we were with Far
ragut on the Mississippi and we were
under action that his former disposition
changed. He lost his hot temper and be
came the coolest and most self-controlled
of young men. He then gave evidences of
the greatness of his ability. A few years
ago when he received the appointment
â¢which placed him In charge of the Asiatic
squadron there were a number of people
â¢who persisted in saving that he had seen
his best days. Well. Manila Bay, May 1.
is all that need be said on the question.
"The intention to send a fleet to Europe
â was looked upon as a bluff, but I think
the department was sincere at the time.
I received the notice from the Navy De
partment in cipher and started for Key
West at once, elated and overjoyed, for
I thought at last my time had come.
"When I arrived at Key West I was sur
prised to discover that the entire coun
try had already learned of the news.
But disappointment was again my meas
ure.
. "There is one thing I cannot under
stand and that is the so-called Spanish
honor. There I was with a fleet of gun
boats, converted yachts and a motley col
lection of every vessel known to the water
service. Cervera knew of it and neglect

NATIONAL BANK FOR
HAWAIIAN ISLANDS
WILL SOON BE ESTABLISHED AT
HONOLULU.
Hawaiian. New Tork and Local Cap
italists Are Interested in the
New Financial Venture.
When the Gaelic leaves this port to
morrow she will have on board two local
bankers bound for Hawaii. Upon their
arrival a bank will be established in Hon
olulu, which will be called the First Na
tional Bank of Hawaii, with a capitaliza
tion of J1.000.C00.
At present there is stopping at the Pal
ace Fletcher S. Heath of New York. Mr.
Heath is the representative of some very
wealthy Gothamites. who, together with
the local bankers, whose names are with
held for the present, and a few well
known Hawaiian business men, are at
the bottom of the incorporation. Mr.
Heath said last night:
"The importance of the establishment
of the First National Bank is greater
than it at first seems. Since the annexa
tion of the islands the United States as
a Government has suddenly developed
business relations with Hawaii which
can be transacted only by means of a
quasi-governmental agency. At present
this country cannot deposit its money
with any private banking institution.
This difficulty will be soon obviated in
Hawaii upon the establishment of the
national bank. Then the paymaster of
the United States troops may deposit the
money with the national hank and in fact
the bank will be a quasi-agent of the
Government in all Its Hawaiian busi
nes relations."
Mr. Heath would not disclose the names
of the parties interested. ;

Abandonment of a
Race Meeting.
BROWN QUITS THE STARTING

PASO FILLIES.
Coming of Bookmaker Carroll, Turf
Character â The Winnings of
Jennings and Hil
dreth.
The abandonment of the California
Jockey Club's Los Angeles meeting was
no surprise in San Francisco or its vi
cinity. A rumor was In circulation even
before the fair association's meeting be
gun in the City of Angels that the club's
weather and financial prophet predicted I
the coming of a black frost, similar to the I
one folt at Sacramento, and the managers
decided that a fat bank account was far
better than a big: balance on the wrong
side of the ledger. Besides, there was a
paucity of fleet gallopers on hand, J.nd
small fields meant meager gate receipts
and limited speculation.
Because L. P. Tarlton, the well-known
racing judge, did not fancy the operation
of "foreign books" on Turf Congress
tracks (and said so) he was "fired" from
bis position as judge at Newport without
ceremony. Fowler, the manager of the
track, did the discharging. It is high
time laws were passed by the governing
turf bodies making as capable man as
Colonel Tarlton more secure in his posi
tion, so that he may not be placed at the I
mercy of a man or sot of men whose ideas j
might be at variance with hie. Racing
omcial6 in America, if they desire to ke<v |
their places, may have to see to It that ;
they are not "out of line" in their ideas.
If they are. they should saw wood and j
look "owly." . , __Â
It will greatly surprise a host of Call
fornians to learn that H. D. ("Curley )
Brown gave up starting race horses at ;
the close of the Newport, Ky.. meeting |
and will hereafter devote himself to con- j
ditioning * string of gallopers owned by I
himself. Brown nas made a great name
as a flag wielder and barrier raiser and ;
was supposed to be wedded to his proles- j
sion. Hence the surprise will be all the
greater. "Curley" began starting horses
at old Bay District track along about 1892,
and even' then gave promise of making j
one of the best in the business, a promise
he fully kept.
"Tony" Cook, for a long time associ

W. E. Applesrate bought Tuba Dam

Beautiful Morris Park, which cost the [
late John A. Morris $1,500,000, will in all !

chester, it is thought the Morrises will ex
perience llttje trouble in realizing $5,000,

The forty-five yearlings from Rancho j

Now that the California breeder J. B. ;
Haggin, has pioneered the way, Ken- j
tucky and Tennessee breeders will doubt

Young Willie Applegate, so successful
in England, where he went to play Tod
Sloan's mounts, will probably not need
his father's assistance in paying off the
bookmaker creditors who mourned his
departure a few weeks ago. Reports are
to the effect that he has made the bank
rolls of many a bookmaker look as if j
Jumbo had jumped on them. Plungers j
make seesaws out of the betting-ring j
boards, don't they? At last reports we j
would have Riley Gronnan this winter, i
but not 'â¢Plttsburg Phil." The latter !
could never get on to the curves of the j
California contingent very well.
Briar Sweet will probably be as hard ;
to beat here aa she is at the far East. j
So far they haven't found any galloper i
over there capable of beating her at any
distance from five furlongs to a mile and
a quarter. If she had met Hamburg at
about a mile and a sixteenth there would
have been some track records burned up,
and it Is hard to say which would have |
won. for she beat her fields just aa easily
as the colt did.

J. J. ("Virginia") Carroll, who will book j

the great "characters" of the book- j

voice like a buzzsaw In active operation,
a temper capable of becoming as warm J
as a Hawaiian maiden's heart, and on j
short notice, and as to taking: in the coin. j
when you ask him his limit he'll answer,
"Your conscience." If there Is a lull in
the storm of excitement Carroll will \
either get up a fight (with himself as one \
of the principals) or sing you a few bars
of the latest popular melody. As a
natural consequence the big, sandy haired j
bookie Is always the center of attraction :

BACON PLACE TO BE CLOSED.
The Executive Committee Beports
Progress on St. Mary's Park.
At a meeting of the executive commit
tee on St. Mary's Park held Saturday in
the basement of St. Mary's Church on i
California street, George D. Shadburne,
its chairman, reported that the title to the !
property was now being searched, and j
until this work had been completed noth- :
ing definite could be done In the way of
commencing condemnation proceedings.
There was much pleasure expressed at
the action of the Supervisors in removing
the conditions upon which the appropria
tion of $75,000 was made, that Is. provided
the mover? of the park scheme would
: raise J25.000 before July. ISS&. As the ap
propriation now stands, It is made avail
able at any time.
After disposing of the park project, the
discussion turned on the removal of the
inhabitants of Bacon place. With the
establishing of this park a movement will
be made to close Bacon place on the south
side of Pine street. Superintendent of
Streets Ambrose has been requested to
remove the gates, but he has refused,
unless furnished with an ' order from
Mayor Phelan. which has not been forth
coming up to date. A similar request has
been made to Chief of Police Lees, but
the old man positively declines to move in
, the matter. He says he has no official
knowledge of Bacon place being a public
street, and, further, he would not act
unless fortified by an ordinance from tae
i Supervisors signed by the Mayor.

In fairly good trim, but the Indiana has
taken a' very long time to get back. She
made the run to Yokohama in fourteen
days and there she coaled. From Yoko
hama to San Francisco she took twenty

The cruiser Philadelphia 1b baok at her
old anchorage off Folsom street wharf.
She went down to Honolulu in the good
time of six days, nineteen hour*, but as
there was no hurry to get home the re
turn run occupied nine days, nineteen
hours. During the first part of the voy
age she was delayed by strong heud
winds. Early yesterday morning Rear
Admiral Miller came ashore and on his
return to the cruiser will turn her over to
Commodore Kautz, who will succeed him
in command of the Pacitic station.
Admiral sillier will go on the retired list
by operation uf law early next month. He
has been more than forty years in active
service and has commanded in all j>u.rt>*

the faculty at Annapolis and served with
distinction throughout the civil war and
has therefore seen the evolution of the

Captain John Carl Cattermoie. the well
known ship chandler, died yesterday at
the ripe age. of 74 years. He was hale and
. almost to the last, so his death
comes as a surprise to his hosts of
friends. Captain Cattermoie came here in
1564 in command of the German bark
Gottfried. He ran her between here and
Mexican ports for a long time and then
in IST3 he returned to Germany. He sold
out a!l his interests in that country and
with his family came back to San Fran
c!s=oo For a time he ran on the coast in
the old bark Bohemia, but finally he gave
up the sea and went into the ship chand

with his son Charles H., up to the day or
his death.
The steamer Wo Ha Walla arrived from

with a drummer who was making the
trip to Seattle. Eva or Florence became
very lively the eecond day out from San
Francisco" and the chief steward had to
send her to her room on one or two occa
p'.ons. At Victoria, B. C, she left the
vessel, and on the return trip of the
Steamer some of the crew say they saw
her on The street in company with *
couple of fast women. The girl was
alone during the voyage and evidently
went north of her own volition.
Wong Sam. an old. frif-ndle?s and pov
erty-stricken Chinese, attempted to com
mit suicide on the water front yesterday.
The last 10 cents he had in the world he
invested in a Chinese lottery ticket, and
when it did not win anything he walked
down to Union-street wharf and Jumped
overboard. Some of the crew of a Brit
ish ship fished him out and took him to
the Harbor Receiving Hospital, where
Drs. Fitzglbbon and Green brought him
around.
William Thompson, a driver at Palo

early yesterday morning. H-? was drunk

George W. Pratt, who was asleep on the
State tug Governor Irwin, heard his
soreamÃ for help and went to his assist
ance. They got a loop of a rope over
Thompson's shoulders and under his
arms. Then It took four of them to get
him on the wharf. Thompson went back
to Palo Alto last night after signing the

HOLMES WON
THE TEN-MILE
ROAD RACE
A Reliance Club Rider
Victorious.
FIRST OF 115 STARTERS
JULIUS SMITH OF SAN JOSE
TOOK TIME HONORS.
A Muddy Road for Half the Distance
Prevented Record Breaking,
but the Race Was Speedy
Nevertheless.
Oakland and San Jose divided equally
the honors of the California Associated
Cycling Clubs* big ten-mile road race
across the bay yesterday morning, C.
Holmes of the Reliance Club winning
first place and Julius Smith of the Gar
den City Wheelmen making the fastest
time.
The event was the fifth annual handi
cap of the association and it differed in
many respects from the four previous
ones. There were 115 entrants, the larg
est list of starters ever entered in an
event of the association. Of this number
16 were scratched, and of the 99 actual
starters 73 finished.
There were no serious accidents to mar
the sport, something unusual in this
style of a race. Several men suffered
from slight falls and the usual dozen or
so punctured wheels were In evidence,
but that was all. The condition of the
road from the start at Fniitvale for
about the first three miles of the dis
tance precluded any thought of record
breaking. The recent rains had left a
layer of mud two or three inches deep
through which riding was slow and te
iluus. Occasionally there would be a
narrow strip of dry going where the men
had to line up in Indian file and "follow
the leader" until a better stretch was
reached near the electric road power
house at Elmhurst. From there or; to
San Leandro the course improved, though
still rough and muddy in places. From
San Lt-andro to about a mile before Hay
wwrds wui reached a newly made road
was found with a perfect surface, and
here many a link was let out that forged
some epeedy man ahead and blighted the
hopes of his slower competitors.
"Ihe entrance to the town of Haywards,
the linish of the race, was so muddy :hat
it had to be rolled for several hours in
the morning before the racers arrived to
put it into any kind of shape, and then
it was very uncertain in places. Under
these conditions the best time made, 2.
minute* 46 seconds, was very fast, even
when compared with the great r
made by Howard \V. Squires in 1896 of
L4.-V.
The handicaps of the different starters
varied from nothing to three and a half
minutes. Holmes, the winner of first
place, was on the 3.13 mark and had prac
tically an eusy race of it. He overtook
the half dozen men ahead of him before
they had covered half the distance, and
crossed the tape alone, fifty leet ahead
of the second man. It was the third man.
however, whom he might well be afraid
of, and he was Julius Smith, time prize
winner. Smith started from the l:lfl
mark, and practically gained two minutes
on Holmes. He was coming so fast at
the nnish he would surely have landed in
fir?t pi; !( 'c had the race lasted another
quarter of a mile. As it was he took
third place and first time, beating out
the scratch men for the latter honor by
almost a minute.
It was expected that J. E. M Ing. the
Olympics' pride, who was given no handi
cap would get the time prize, but he was
out of form. Another thing that upset
Wing's chances was the fact that of the
six men on scratch but three started,
Wing, Hozlo and Llnd. Fuller, Russ and
Delmas kept out for reasons of their
own- This lessened the pacing material
of the scratch men and they were unable
. as well as they might otherwise
have dune.
Deacon. Reliance Club; L.tvinps=tnn. Bay
Cltv Henderson. Olympic, and Clark,
Garden City, met with falls along the
route which spoiled their chanc-s, but
none of them were badly hurt. The other
accidents were side slips caused by the
mud and many a weak-hearted rider,
tired from the stiff pace, used the occa
sion as an excuse to drop out then ani
there and eeek the cool seclusion of a
wayside inn. of which there are many on
the* San Leandro-Haywards road.
The arrangements for the race wen
very complete, and the prize list ej
ingly liberal, there being twenty
place prizes, the best of which was a suit
of clothes, and three time prizes, the nrst
being a gold watch. The linieh was well
patrolled and ropes stretched along the
road there kept back the crowd and
avoided the possibility of a serious acci
dent at that point.
Julius Smith, the winner of the time
prize, is an old stager at the racing game.
He made his initial bow on New Year's
Day of IS*S at the track constructed with
in the old Haight street baseball grounds,
and won. a couple of events on the high
or "ordinary" machine. Evfr since then
he bas been racing on the track and road
with varying success, and no track or
road event is seemingly complete without
Smith's entry. He is Just as fast to-day
as ever, as witness his performance of
yesterday.
On the other hand. Holmes, winner of
first p!ac<Â». is a new comer in the racing
game, and "Pop" Jerome, the mentor of
things cycling in the Reliance Club, is
so pleased with his protege's victory that
he proposes to tender him and tha other
Reliance racers a banquet some night thi =
week in honor of the achievement.
The timing and judging at the finish
was remarkably efficient when the diffi
culties of those positions are considered,
although the duties devolved upon but a
few. Chairman Loos of the racing board
had appointed twenty-nine scorers, timers
and judges, but many of these loitered
along the road to watch the race, and
came In to the finish when it was all over.
They were never missed, however, for the
few who were there did their work well.
Special crÂ«<slt in this respect Is due to
Timers Wetmore. Montealegre, Stodiiard
and Bailey, Judges Kerrigan. Mullen and
Boeckman. and Scorers Owen, Hammer
smith. Clark and Spalding.
The following table will show the con
testants, th^ir positions at the 'finish,

SENATOR NEARLY READY.
The Valencia Will Sail Next Week,
and Possibly the Ohio.
The coming week will be a busy one in
military circles. It promises much to the
soldiers now encamped at the Presidio j
for the Senator will sail for Manila with
some of the forces now here and in con
sequence interest is at fever heat among
the soldiers, who are eager to learn which
command will be sent away first. Yester
day General Merriam called on General
Miller for the complete field returns of all
the troops in his command. This he did
for the purpose of seeing how to t-est se
lect commands to go on the dilferent
transports. They have to be chosen with
regard to the capacity of the vessel. One
important thing will be observed in send
ing away the transports, and that is that
the vessels will not be so crowded as for- â 
merly. It was evident that the former ex
peditions were overcrowded, and this
caused great inconvenience to the men.
and no little suffering, and was doubtless
responsible for some of the deaths that
occurred on board ship.
The order assigning troops to the Sena
tor will be Issued from department head
quarters to-morrow or next day. The Va- ;
lencia will sail next week and possibly the
Ohio if she can be got ready, but there j
are a number of alterations to be made
in her. The Indiana and the Newport will
hardly get away next week, although I
there is a bare possibility of their doing
so. General Merriam was Informed yes- i
terday that the transport Peru sailed
from Manila on Saturday.
Colonel Smith of the Tennessee R^
ment has been ordered by General Miller
to send one non-commissioned officer ana !
a private to Fresno to bring back Private .
William Casey of Company M. who is con- ,
fined there as being insane. Casey went ;
to Fresno some time ago upon a furlough
to visit friends, and a few days ago Colo- ;
nel Smith was informed by his friends
that Casey has become insane and had !
been confined. He reported the matter to
General Miller and was ordered to send
for the man. Colonel Smith does not know
any of the particulars Of Casey's sudden
insanity. â 
Captain C. A. Rogers, assistant surgeon
Sixth California, has been assigned to the
California Heavy Artillery; Assistant Sur- '
geon Captain J. B. Ladd. Seventh Cali- !
fornia Regiment, has been assigned to the
Third Battalion of "the Twenty-third In
fantry. Private C. B. Crawford. Hospital
Corps, U. S. A., upon the advice of the j
chief surgeon has been appointed acting j
hospital steward.
Major P. H. Whitman, Twentieth Kan
sas, has been detailed upon fhe general
court-martial, relieving Colonel J. H.
Wholley, First Washington. Captain A.
C. Gillem, First Tennessee, has been
granted a fifteen days' furlough.

TRYING TO

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, October 9.
For the next thirty days it would well
become the Republicans of Alameda
County to possess their souls and bodies
in patience. There Is certainly no need to
ie hysterical. The regular Republi
can ticket, it is true, has aroused Boma
opposition within the ranks of the party,
and an independent movement is said to
be threatening all kinds of calamities at
the polls. These Independents, it seems.
to me, are wasting a great deal of energy
and thunder. They are decrying the
methods of everything done under the au
thority of the regular Republican party
of the county. They even go oehind the
primaries and I â  they
were held tho ticket had been made up,
and that primaries and convention were
. for the purpose of blinding the
public.
Now all this may be true or false, it
rs not. The public ma-- be I
sometimes, but even the astute Republi
â â f Alameda County cam :
râ n< ith< r can the independents.
It is safe to assume that owing to the
1 scattered and broad rial
supplied to the Intelligent ;
of this county, each voter Is now cogni
sant of all the facts, and can deduce his
conclusions. Each voter can I
for himself the mai
even office. There is no compulsion and
ssity for the regulars to ridicule
the independents or for the Independents
tp obloquy on the regulars. All have
efore the public ami he'd aieir con
ventlons, made their nominations, and
this 'â  !-:â â *
tern of effort known as "campaigning.
T!>- ' "i when voters can
have a ticket forced down their throats.
The candidate who is turned down at the
who scorns a convention
. | crookedness is in a
.. -Sully than the man
â who r rty nomination, and
inflict upon the
public his grievances, because they have
6n provided fur and the remedy is
in his own hands.
It would be well for every candidate

Since it is evident that the name of
every candidate, party or non-partisan,
â will get before the voters, it will be Inter
esting, this November, especially, to no
tice the verdict of the county regarding
the people running for offices. Although
there were mistakes made at San Le
andro. there were possibly a few made at
Germania Hall by the independents, and
yet I do not think that the preponderance
of public support will be accorded the
Germania Hall ticket. There are good
m"n among its candidates, and the fact
that Ffime are Democrats and others have
no political party significance, wiU cut
no figure, for on the ballot they will
all appear as independent candidates,
and no one will be on hand to

Since so much liberty in the matter of

objection made by independent candi

of fair play and rorely no citizen whose
exalted opinion of himself and his civic
duty Induces him to run f.>r office would
desire any unfair advantage over any
cither candidate.
The muddle that now exists at the City
Hall is perhaps the beet object lesson pos
sible of the necessity of party discipline
In municipal government. The present
officials, most of them creatures of a
"committee of twenty-one," which was
and is yet a mystery, are responsible to
no party platform for their actions and
as a resuft Oakland is presenting indta-
Inutable proof that Rev. -Mr. Whitaker
told the visiting Baptists the truth last
week by declaring this to be the "City of
K-uls " There is no sympathy between
iny'two of the excessive number of
branches of the city government and it
to be impossible to bring about har
iÃony. Consequently, there Is a stupid
squabble over the tax levy and all the
has b*en informed that th-
Library has been closed, that the schools
will have to be closed for a great portion
of the present ttscal year, that the streets
. .leaned, that in tjb< very heart
of the city is a disease-breeding lake and
from all 'this the natural inference Is
drawn that Oakland's city government
.r aggregation of political
marionettes bent on destroying the fair
name of tin ;r city. Nor is this overdrawn j
â -t is actually short of the truth.
A stranger to Oakland called on a city
official last Saturday, telling him he had a
couple of hours to spare a.nd asked where
he could pleasantly spend the time. "We
have no park, no public museum, no pic
ture gallery, the public library is closed
Just now, but there Is the lake " The
official was baying when he was inter- 1
rupted.
"Lake Herri ttâ that cesspool?" asked
the man from Los Angeles, and then an
adjournment was taken to a saloon,
where the official told the visitor that we
had recently witnessed half a dozen po
litical conventions and that there are
more independent candidates for office than
even Oakland has known in the past, and
that there were seven political "demon
strations to choose from in the evening.
The visitor crossed the bay on the next
ferry boat.

What a farce for the city that gTew upon
the foundation of its private and public
schools until it was known as the Athens
of the Coast, to close her schools and her
free library because a crowd of politicians
are at swords' points and obstinate. It
bae ceased to be ridiculous, it is serious
and if ever an unselfish statesman were
needed, it Is now. No man who thinks
more of his $10 per week salary than of
the public interest can bring the exist
ing complications to an acceptable con j
elusion, and it begins to look as though
wires were already being pulled for the
spring election. STUART W. BOOTH.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 9.
Coroner Baldwin and a Jury will next
Wednesday night inquire into the death
of John McKee, who died at Fabiola Hos
pital last Friday night from Injuries sus
tained at the new sugar refinery at
Crockett on Wednesday last.
Deceased came by his death in rather
a peculiar manner. He was passing by a
lime kiln, on the top of which several
men were working, when a heavy sledge
hammer, being lowered by one of the
other workmen by means of a line,
slipped, and, falling- a distance of
about twenty feet, struck McKee on the
top of the head, knocking him senseless
and injuring him fatally.
Deceased was 42 years of age and a
native of Baltimore. He formerly re
sided at Vallejo.
Coroner Baldwin to-day also received
news from Livermore announcing the
death of another of the four men in
jured by the gas explosion at Tesla coal
mine last Tuesday. Axel Norl died from
his injuries yesterday, and to-day Joseph
Patton died under similar circumstances.
Inquests will be held to-morrow at Liv
ermore.
Patton was aged 40 years. The two
others injured in the explosion are still
in a critical condition.
FRIGHTFULLY BURNED
BY A BLAZING LAMP
INSENSATE DEED OF DRUNKEN
WOMAN.
Mrs. Mnlarkey Hurls a Lighted
Lamp at Mrs. Mettie Suits
With Fatal Result.
Mrs. Mettle Suits, who conducts a lodg
ing house at 1046 Folsom street, was prob
ably fatally burned at 1 o'clock this morn
ing by blazing oil from a lamp that was
hurled at her by Mrs. Jane Mularkey, ono
of her lodgers.
Between midnight and 1 o'clock Mrs.
Suits heard a commotion in the room of
Mrs. Mularkey. and. lighting a lamp, she
went downstairs to investigate.
At the door of the woman's room she
rrint Mrs. Mularkey, who also carried a
lighted lamp, which, with no more
warning than a furious oath she hurled
at her landlady's head. It struck the
lamp she carried and both exploded.
The blazing oil set fire to the wrapper
worn by Mrs. Suits, who ran shrieking
into the back yard followed by her daugh
ter Alice, who succeeded in stripping her
mother of the burning clothing. Mrs. Suits
was frightfully burned about the neck and
right arm and lower part of the body,
and is not expected to live.
Mrs. Mularkey was immediately ar
rested upon a charge of assault with a
deadly weapon. She denied having
thrown the lamp, but there are numerous
witnesses who bear out MrÃ. Suits' story.
SPAIN DESPAIRS OF
FOREIGN ASSISTANCE
Believed the Peace Commission Will
Complete Its Work Before
Congress Meets.
NEW YORK, Oct. 9.â The Washington
correspondent of the Herald says: From
dispatches received from Chairman Day
the authorities here are still of the opin
ion that the work of the Peace Comission
will be completed before Congress meets.
Mr. Day takes quite an optimistic view
of the situation. It Is his desire to limit
the time of discussion of various points
raised as much as possible in order that
the negotiations may reach an early con
clusion. Information which has been re
ceived here shows conclusively that Spain
has no further hope of foreign interfer
ence, and this fact leads the authorities
to believe that she will not attempt to
drag the negotiations out as long as she
would if she believed there was a chance
of any European government attempting
to ; ure a modification of the American
terms.
LONDON. Oct. 10.â The Madrid corre
spondent of the Times says it is the pre

ion.

statement comes from Somoa, per steam

FORECAST OF THE
COMING ELECTIONS
Republicans Will Con
trol the House.
DEMOCRATIC GAINS LIKELY
WILL NOT OVERCOME THE
PRESENT MAJORITY.
Lack of Interest in the Present Con
tests One Obstacle to the Suc
cess of the Party in
Power.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 9.â The Wash
ington Post will present to-morrow in a
series of dispatches from correspond
ents in every State in the Union except
Maine, Vermont and Oregon, where
Congressional elections have already
been held, a view of the political situa
tion with especial reference to the com
plexion of the next House of Represen
tatives. In summarizing its dispatches
the Post says:
While Democrat gains are outlined
in many States the figures given by the
correspondents of the Post do not yet
make it positive that the Republicans
will lose control of the House. There is
at present in the House of Representa
tives a Republican majority of fifty-six
over all parties combined, and this large
majority will be difficult to completely
overcome. There is no doubt that it vv 111
be reduced to a very small number but
the present indications do not point to its
e Vln> estimates made by the Post's cor
respondente show that 1Â« districts in the
United States will certainly be Republi
can in the approaching electionâ unless
the unexpected happensâ and thirteen
additional districts will give the Repub
licans a majority of the House.
According to the Post's advices there
are no less than forty-two doubtful dis
tricts, the large number being in a great
measure due to the caution of the Posts
correspondents in declining to place in
the certain column any district which
contains an element of doubt. Out or this
forty-two however, there are at least
twenty district* in which the chances are
paid to favor the Republicans. For in
stance, there are districts in Massachu
setts Maryland. Delaware, New
West Virginia. Ohio. Michigan and Wy
oming which are classed as doubtful but
which the Republicans will probably
carry With 166 districts assigned with
certainty to the Republicans, as against
l^S assigned to the Democrats, according
to the Post's figures, the party in power
has an easier path to travel to the de
sired poal. The Populists are piven thir
t.en seats and the Silver Republicans
All the correspondents of the Post
agree in their statements as to the
apathy shown everywhere in the coming
elections, and that this lack of intrest
Is the one great obstacle to Republican
success All efforts are now being made
to get out the vote, and the campaign
is undoubtedly becoming enlivened. The
Democrats are. encouraged by their fight
ing chance, and the Republicans, appre
ciating the danger that threatens, are
vigorously laboring to Impress upon their
voters the necessity of casting every bal
lot at the polls.

WON THE GAME
BY STICK WORK
IN TWO INNINGS
San Francisco Defeats
"Sand Crabs."
IBERG WAS IN GREAT FORM
ONE OF THE BEST CONTESTS OF
THE SEASON.
The Athletics Check the Onward
Career of the Millers by a
Lop-Sided Game at
Stockton.
By Joe Corbett
Despite the very poor weather a record
breaking crowd found its way into Recre
ation Park yesterday afternoon, and was
treated to one of those heartrending:
games, in which the rejuvenated Friscos
defeated the famous Sand Crabs by the
score of 6 to 4.
Tho game throughout was replete with
brilliant and clever plays, and wound up
with one of those unexpected finishes that
di) more to perpetuate the popularity of
the great national game than anything I
know of.
The Friscos at the outset of the contest
lit on to Mr. Balss and in the second In
ning scored four runs. From this on to
the seventh the game was marked by
very steady playing, when the Sand Crabs
found Iberg for a couple of two-baggers
and scored their first run of the game.
In the next inning, with the assistance
of two bases on balls, a parsed ball and
two hits, they scoreu three more.
This last rally evened up things and the
excitement was intense, those Santa Cruz
fans making a deafening racket. The
Friscos, however, proved themselves equal
to the emergency, and by clever batting
and base running scored two more runs,
and won one of the grandest games of the
season. Iberg pitched a masterly game
up to the eighth, and was also well sup
ported. The score follows:

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., MONDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1893.
DR. RODGERS
BREAKS A HIGH
RIFLE RECORD
Sets the Mark at 461,
German Target.
BEST TWENTY SHOTS MADE
EIGHTEEN BULLETS IN A SIX
INCH CIRCLE, OFFHAND.
Gennania Club Is Proud of Its Cham
pion â Good and Fair Records
Made by Many
Marksmen.
i
The twenty-shot rifle record of the Pa
cific Coast on the German ring: target was
broken by Dr. L. O. Rodgers yesterday at
the Shell Mound range. This feat was
performed while shooting for the cham
pion class medal of the Germania
Schuetzen Club, single entry. Dr. Rodg
ers' score in twenty shots was 461 rings.
The Individual shots were 23, 23, 19, 24, 23,
24, 21, 23, 24, 22, 22, 24, 23, 24, 25, 24, 23, 25,
22, 23 â 461. The doctor was highly com
plimented for his remarkable marksman
ship, which to riflemen has much signifi
cance. The last ten consecutive shots
were kept within a six-inch circle and
eighteen out of the twenty were kept
within the same space; which, consider
ing the distance, 200 yards, off hand,
means that he must have been under a
terrible, strain to hold out so well.
His previous rf-cord In twenty shots was
451. As stated, he broke the coast record,
which was 454, held by F. P. Schuster.
The latter held the honors of being high
man of the West only two months. The
next in tho line was A. Strecker with 451.
It Us believed that it will be many a day
before Dr. Rndgers' mark will be reached
on this coast. The doctor has been an
enthusiastic rifleman for the past twenty
or twenty-five years and has won many
medals and honors, but of all he is more
proud of yesterday's performance. Dur
ing the last of the shooting over half of
the members of the Germania Club were
present watching every shot with the
keenest of interest, and when the last was
announced they pave him an ovation that
any man would be proud of. NonÂ» were
more eager to express their congratula
tions than Schuster and Strecker. While
it cannot be stated now as a fact it Is
believed that 4M rin^s Is the hiphest rec
ord ever made in the T'nited States.
The day was none too good for fine
rifle shooting, the light varying every few
minutes so that the elevation was hard
tfi keÂ»p. In the bullseye contest for cash
prizes in the Norddeutscher Sehuetzen
Verein D. Salfield won Hrst money on a
center measuring 261 points on the ma
chine. In the San Francisco Schuetzen

rings. J. E. liorman of the Columbia

years. The youngster followed up her great
victory of the previous Sunday, when she
captured the annual Produce stake, win
ning the Puppy stake at Union Park yes
terday. She had pitted against her some
of the bst dogs in her class.
Despite the threatening weather the
usual large following of coursing enthu
siasts attended the popular nark, and
were treated to a number of surprises.
Thornhill, T. J. Cronin's white possession,
rounded into form yesterday and came
within an ace of winning the open stake.
He started out by defeating Jersey Lily,
over whom he was favorite, and then con
tinued his success by downing the great
Lord Byron, McKinley and Wait a Little
In order. Lord Byron and McKinley were
looked upon as sure winners by the talent
who banked heavily on their chances.
Firm Friend was also looked upon as a
loser, owing to her poor work on Satur
day, but the Pasha kennel's representa
tive pulled himself together and beat
Moonlight, Vigilant and the 1 to 3% fa
vorite. Cavalier, to the surprise and con
sternation of followers of form. Although
Firm Friend gained greater speed after
each course, he succumbed to the match
less Rosette, the eventual winner of the
stake.
Wild Tralee endeared himself to the
"short-enders" by putting out Thad Ste
vens at 1 to 3, after a no go. Wait a Lit
tle, who has just risen from the puppy
class, beat Douglass and Commodore, two
old-timers, and gives .promise of being a
stake runner. He gave way to Thornhill
In the last round after a hard struggle.
Walt a Little and Riot Act were the only
short-enders in the second run-down of
the open stake to land a flag. The former
beat Forgive at 3 to 1 and the latter beat
Joy Bells at the same odds. Commodore
had a very narrow escape in his race with
Riot Act. falling twice in the course and
allowing Riot Act to score many points.
Curtis & Sons had their usual large
number of entries in the open stake, but
were unable to divide the money, as they
have done during the last three Sundays,
The well-known dog owners were, how
ever, satisfied, as Rosette, their foremost
representative, captured the purse.
Following were the results:

MAYFLOWER WINS HANDILY.
She Captures the Open Stake at the
Ingleside Park Yesterday.
Mayflower captured the open stake at
Ingleside yesterday and Promise Me was
runner up. The result was a great sur
prise to the talent, as Rock Island Boy
was played heavily In all the long 1 odds
books and his victory was a foregone con
clusion. But Rock Island Boy was bested
by Bonita in the second round at the good
odds of 4to 1. His defeat by Bonlta was
a great surprise, but can be accounted for
by his recent sickness, and Rock Island
Boy could, therefore, be truly termed a
false favorite. Favorites again won nearly
all the courses yesterday, the few excep
tions being Mission Tip at 6 to 2, Jack of
Spades, 7 to 2; Rosalie, 2 to 1; Counterfeit,
2 to 1; Bonita, 4 to 1, and Mayllower, 5
to 3.
The longest and most sensational course
of the day was between Campania and
Telephone Girl, which was won by the
former bitch. The crurse was long, fast
and grueling-. The lead up was made by
Campania, but was relinquished by her
after the first turn and then for a num
ber of points all went to Telephone Girl's
credit and would if it had terminated ear
lier been won by the latter bitch; but the
pace was. too hot for her, and Campania
in a fast run past the grand stand again
resumed the lead and killed by a score of
19 to 14. Sharkey was a big- dump for tal
ents, as they piled their money aboard the
dog, thinking he could defeat Counterfeit
easily, but Counterfeit showed . increased
speed all the way, and won by a score of
36 to 22.
Soubrette and Lissak furnished a world
of excitement. Soubrette was made favor
ite at odds of 2 to 1, but in a "no go" both
dogs seemed to run on even terms. In tne
second round Soubrette showed up hand
somely under the faithful training of
Johnnie Maher. She ran with less signs
of distress than the other and won with
ease and a number of points to spare.
Soubrette eventually met defeat In the
third round from _ Mialmo. In the final
course Mayflower . showed . the foot over
Promise Me and won the stake, which her
owner, John Eagan, richly deserved, as
Mayflower was without doubt In the finest
form of any of the entries.
The results were as follows:
. First roundâ Dean's Brilliantlne beat P.
Brophy's Uenlcia Boj;; A.- and B. kennel's Ir

HON. HENRY T. GAGE TELLS
WHY HE WILL BE ELECTED
HON. HENRY T. GAGE left San Francisco yesterday afternoon
jound for Bakersfield, where ho wDI open his campaign in the San
Joaquin Valley this evening. Mr. Gage is very well satisfied with the
existing conditions, and believes that the Republicans in the metropolis
will give a good account of themselves.
Since he began his campaign in this, the alleged stronghold of Maguire,
the Republican standard bearer has not expressed himself in an inter
view. However, just prior to his departure he gave to a Call representa
tive some personal opinions on the campaign and the situation that will be
of particular interest to all Republicans and the Democrats as well.
"I desire to say that I deeply appreciate the cordial welcome that has
been accorded me by the people of San Francisco," said Mr. Gage. "The
ly attended meetings and the genuine enthusiasm invariably dis
played convinced me that the Republicans of this city are taking a very
lively interest in this momentous campaign. From my personal observa
tions and the information that has come to me from private but reliable
sources, I believe that the contest in San Francisco is progressing in a
manner highly advantageous to the Republican party.
"I can say the same with respect to the other districts in the State I
have visited. Everywhere I have found the same conditions. The meet
ings have invariably been large, and the enthusiasm of the good old sort
that means active work and votes. These conditions I think will be found in
otln-r sections of the State yet to be visited.
"I wili say frankly that I feel confident that I will be electedâ that this
will be a Republican year, notwithstanding it is an 'off' one, when the in
terest of voters is not so keen as in a Presidential election.
"My reasons for believing that I will defeat Mr. Maguire in this con
test arV. tlrst. that with scattering exceptions I will receive the full vote
of the Republican party, and second, that Mr. Magriire will not poll the
full strength of the Democracy. This latter statement is made not alone
on the many reports that have come to me of defections in the Demo
cratic ranks, but from the fact tnat during my campaign hundreds of old
line Democrats have told me that they proposed to vote for me. Further
more they stated In many cases that this would be their first Republican
vote in a State or national election.
"I did not enter this contest without mature deliberation, and after
looking the situation over carefully I concluded that I could win. Mr.
Maguire is telling the people that he will come out of his horne â San
Franciscoâ with 10,000 majority. I do not think he will, and I will say that
if he intends to defeat me he will do well to increase that figure to a point
nearer the 15,000 mark, for I propose to come out of the interior with a
majority sufficient to require some such a following for my opponent.
The attitude of the many thoughtful, earnest Democrats in this city
and elsewhere who do not propose to indorse the anomalous position of
their standard-bearer should not be overlooked. Neither should the fact
of the large falling-off of registration in the Democratic districts of this
city. For these reasons I fear Mr. Maguire will be disappointed when the
final results are known. In fact, I saw wagers made yesterday that the
Republicans would carry San Francisco. Without reference to such in
cidents I think the conditions here are very encouraging.
"I leave for Bakersfield this afternoon and will make my campaign
"throughout the San Joaquin Valley, where my opponent claims a formi
dable support. With reference to that section I feel warranted in say
ing that I also have some friends there.
"So far as Mr. Maguire is concerned the conditions go to show that
ho is steadily losing ground. This has been going on since the campaign
proper opened and will continue until it closes.
"In conclusion I desire to impress upon the minds of my friends the
fact that it is unwise to belittle the strength of an opponent. There
fore I urge upon them to keep up the good fight to the best of their
abilities until the polls close and thereby roll up a vote of which they
may justly feel proud."
BURGLARS PLY THEIR
NEFARIOUS TRADE
CARRY AWAY THE SUPPLIES OF
SEVERAL FAMILIES.
For Months Thieves Have Been En
joying Themselves on Van
Ness Avenue.
Unusual activity on the part of Jap- I
anoee and Chinese cooks and one or two
American servant girls In and around the
â¢is numbering from 926 to 932 Van
avenue yesterday told the story of
an unusual "happening. Butchers and
:: were being dragged from
their homes to satisfy the demands of
rvants, and had the gTocers
d on Sunday they as well would
een among: the unfortunate. No j
vet was in preparation, neither did;
cupants of the flats seek viands un- j
usually palatable. The fact was they !
mething to eat. Callers had
i the night before, uninvited |
unwelcome. The callers were bur- j
i he same that have fur weeks been '
g their trade in the neighborhood
tested by the police.
Not a sound of vagrant feet was heard
during the night by any of the occupants
of the several flats, and It was only with
the dawn that they discovered the visit
of thieves.
The burglars first visited the residence
of Dr. Taylor, being the second time In
two months, and then In turn took in
all adjoining lardc-re. As looters of
larders the thieves were expert. That j
they were also epicures is easily proved '
by "their acts. From the house of Dr.
Taylor they took a turkey, oysters, eggs
and everything edible in reach. They â 
next visited the apartments of Mrs. Me- ;
Killip. Here they satisfied themselves
â¢with taking not only everything in sight '
but several things that were under lock |
and key. The apartments of Mrs. Cor
nelia Tlbetts were next visited. The
burglars evidently were frightened away
Just as they were preparing to thorough- !
ly loot the place. The doors of the store i
house had been forced and everything
turned about, but nothing was taken.
This was the last place visited by the
thieves.
The case was reported to the police and
a detective was sent to Investigate, but
as usual a wise look or two completed his j
observations and doubtless will end his i
investigations. For the past six months :
an organised gang of thieves has been
working in the locality of the burglary of
Saturday night, and the property-owners I
and householders are determined that
unless the police wake up and afford
them better protection they will see If
some action cannot be taken that will re
sult in .stimulating the guardians of the
peace to at least a degree of wakefulness.
FORM OF CONFESSION.
Bey. Father Mahoney Explains the
Sacrament at St. Ignatius.
Rev. Father Manonoy delivered ,a ser
mon last evening at St. Ignatius Church
to a large congregation on "How Christ
Built the Confessional." The Father at
first explained the origin of confession.
It came from the divine power entrusted
to the apostles in the words, "Keosive
ye the Holy Ghost whose sins ye shall
forgive, they are forgiven them; whose
Bins ye shall retain they are retained."
This power was relocated to the apostles
and their successors to the end of time.
â¢'lt is not sufficient." said the priest,
"to make an abstract confession, such as
*I have sinned.' The specific sin must be
mentioned aud absolution given accord
ingly. In a court of Justice the Judge
must hear the evidence before pronounc
ing sentence, just so must the priest un
derstand what sins have been committed
before he relieve* the sinner from his bur
den of em. The reason of this is evirif-nt
in the case of the man who has sinned
against another. I'ntll that person makes
reparation for the injury' done no priest
can give him absolution. If he Is guilty
of theft, he must repay what he has
stolen. Should the law of tho church
make no such requisition, confession
would be a trifle and a farce. It seems
humiliating to human flesh and blood to
be required to lay at the foot of a fel
low man every secret and wish which was
is.it pure and every sin and offense they
have committed against the law, both
human and divine, but it was instituted
for the purpose of e-xeiting true contri
tion and a desire to sin no more."
THE ARMY CANTEEN.
Rev. E. A. Woods Deprecates the Ba- !
x loon as a Pest.
Rev. E. A. Woods of the First Baptist !
Church spoke , last night on the "Army
Canteen," and his words were aimed at j
the hearts of the roistering soldiers who j
gin in drunkenness. !,r â  -
"The army canteen." he said, "is the
cause of more sin, more wickedness, more
ill health and destruction of life than any
sickness the soldiers battle against. The
ri-Kiments that had these canteens at
tached to them suffered more severely
than the others. There sickness was to
be found in greater abundance than in
the other regiments, for the soldier who ;
drinks exposes himself to all things with
out a thought of the consequences,
"I hope the President will in his In
vestigation of the management of the
fuisrf bring this finny canteen pest -be*
fore the commission and demand its abo
lition."

The Board of Health has Instructed its
veterinary surgeon. Dr. I. W. O'Rourke
and Chief Food Inspector Dockery and
Assistant Inspector Davis to investigate
the condition of the dairy herds In neigh
boring counties where milk and beef are
sent to San Francisco, and report at the

lence of Texas fever.
If the conditions are found to be as re
ported a strict quarantine will be ordered
against infected districts. The inspectors
have already begun their work, but so
far have found little to warrant the tak
ing of such summary action. They have
not reached the localities, however, where
the most alarming reports come from. Of

Mrs. Mclntosh Falls Out of Bed and
Is Almost Instantly Killed.
Mrs. Ellen Mclntosh, a domestic, aped
47 years, met death in a peculiar manner
yesterday afternoon. The unfortunate
woman lived in a lodging-house at 304
Eighth street, and shortly after noon one
of the lodgers heard a peculiar noise in
her room as If the occupant had fallen
out of bed. As Mrs. Mclntosh had not

Summoning a lodger, she had him break

On the floor lay the woman, her head
resting against a cuspidor. Thinking sne

Yesterday Vosmer was to make hla

ADMIRAL MILLER ARRIVES.
He Will Be Believed by Commodore
Kautz, Now on His Way
From the East.
Rear Admiral Miller returned early
yesterday morning on the Philadelphia
and is at present a guest at the Occi
dental. His trip to Hawaii, where hd
was commissioned by the Government for
the flag raising seremonles, seems to have
agreed with him Immensely. The admiral
has put on several pounds of flesh since
his departure from this city and he is
healthily burned from exposure.
â¢â¢Everything was successful as regards
my mission." he said yesterday. "It was
a "simple ceremony which went off with
out a hitch. The islands are now a part
of us, as you have read these many times.
I have asked the Government to relieve
me from service, though my time for re
tirement does not arrive until November
22. I do not know whrmer I will go to
Washington or not. At any rate, I am
practically on the retired list at the pres
ent time. I will be relieved by Commo

few days from the East."
pital. She may recover, although her con
dition is critical. Her father was the
late George O. Spencer of Oakland, who
died about a year ago, leaving her $IWO
to be paid to her on attaining her ma
jority. She said she did not want to live
without her husband, and he called at the
hospital and BOOOthed her by telling her
that he would never leave her.
Half an hour later Tdrs. I,ulu Fisher,
wife of E4 F. Fisher, a plumber living at
216 Vi Sixth street, was taken to the hospi
tal In the ambulance, suffering from car
bolic acid poisoning. l>r. Thompson did
all he could for her, but she died in a
few minutes. Fisher accompanied the am
bulance to the hospital. He said his wife
was a highly nervous woman and suffered
Kr.-;itly, which made her despondent.
Sometimes she was almost out of her
mind and talked about not wanting to live.
A few days ago she got a bottle of car
bolic acid as a medicine, and yesterday
afternoon while he was out for a few
minutes she swallowed the poison. When
he returned he found her unconscious in
bed. They had been married seven years
and had no children. She was 28 years
of age and her mother, Mrs. Gaffe, lives

in Port Cob ta. Tlie body, was removed to
the Morg~aa.
he tried to move he had to close his
eyes from pain. He was told to rest
and in a brief time the facts of his
narrow escape from death came back
to him and he closed his eyes again,
as though to cast from his mind the
memory of an accident most remark
able in that death was not its end.
At 5 o'clock In the afternoon . thÂ«
aeronaut left the theater to make the
ascension. The huge balloon, filled to
the vent, was swaying In the brisk
breeze, but this failed to frighten Vos
mer or cause him to abandon the as
cent. He took his place on the trapeze
fastened to the parachute, which he
calculated would safely conduct him to
earth again, gave the signal, the ropes
were cut and the monster bag bounded
toward the heavens. At a hundred feet
the balloon seemed to leap into
the midst uf a whirlwind in the upper
currents. Tho balloon spun like a top,
half collapsed and careened toward the
ground. The aeronaut smiled and han
dled the bag as a master would rein a
fractious horse. It started again for
the skies, was caught again in the
whirlwind, careened and, as though
the struggle with the elements had
ruffled its spirits, it turned its spout
upward and like a volcano in minia
ture, belched forth a cloud of smoke
and noisome ga.=. The smoke enveloped
the aeronaut. Once he swung free of
the poisonou.Â« pas, but again the dead
ly fumes filled his lungs. The balloon
careened again and out fpirn the
smoke shot the body of the aeronaut.
WORK OF THE PURE
FOOD INSPECTORS
COMPARATIVELY FEW RESTAU
RANTS IN BAD CONDITION.
One Fruit Cannery Condemned and
Ordered Closed by Chief In
spector Dockery.
The Bureau of Food Inspection of the
Health Department, in charge of Chief
Food Inspector James P. Dockery, has
completed its report for the month of Sep
tember. It shows that during the month
725 restaurants, hotels, bakeries and eat
ing houses were visited for the second
time. Of these t>3o were found to be In good
condition and 95 in very baa shape. No
tices were served on the proprietors of the
latter, giving them ten days to renovate
their kitchens. Thirty-three cases w>re
referred to the plumbing department,
while 67 were served with notices to abate
nuisances. Of 02 candy factories Inspected
all but two were found to be in good con
dition, a;:<l these two were given ten days'
notice to put their places in good order.
Three hundred and eighty-nine of the 445
fruit storey inspected were found to be
in satisfactory condition. Two were in
very bad shape. Notices were served on
fifty-four to put in proper garbage recep
tacles. The inspectors condemned twen
ty-nine dozen melons, eight boxes of
pears, eleven boxes of tomatoes, eight
boxes of plums, seven boxes of figs, four
boxes of peaches, six boxes of apples,
twelve boxes of berries and seven boxes of
gra.pes.
Thirty-two pickle factories were visited
and ull were found to be in good condition,
but of the thirteen fruit canneries in
spected one was found to be in such bad
condition that It was closed forthwith.
Thirteen tamale factories and thirty dai
ries were inspected and all found in good
order.
It Is the Intention of Chief Dockery to
continue the work right along and see
that the restaurants, hotels, bakeries,
canneries and factories do not lapse into
their former filthy state.
AT THE PARK AND CLIFF.
Small Crowds Visit the City's Pleas-

Several new exhibits have been added j
to the museum during the past week and j
many enjoyed themselves in the big !

the storm. Among the new exhibits re- j
ceived are an original die used in coin- :

Rally, Republicans.
A mass-meeting under the auspices of
the regular Republican Club of the
Thirty-sixth Assembly District will be
held at Twin Peaks Hall, Seventeenth and
Noe streets, on Tuesday evening, October
11, at 8 o'clock. Hon. Eugene Loud, Hon.
Henry N. Clement, E. L. Head and other
prominent candidates will addreea the
meeting. Hamilton J. Higgins is chair
man, of the executive committee.
Head foremost to the earth he plunged
and, amid the shrieks and cries of
women and children and the shouts of
men, he was carried unconscious and
bleeding from the grounds.
A physician was hurriedly summoned
and a cursory examination disclosed
the fact that through some kind in
tervention of fate the injured man had
escaped with several cuts and bruises.
No bones were broken, and as far as
could be ascertained he escaped inter
nal injury, but time alone will de
velop his true condition. The balloon
was picked up at Kleventh and How
ard streets and was returned to the
Chutes by order of the police.
At a late hour last night the unfor
tunate aeronaut was resting as easily
as could be expected, considering the
nature of his hurts. The physicians
in attendance would give no opinion as
to the probable result of his injuries,
but stated that to-day they would
know whether or not death or recovery
was to be the aeronaut's fate.

Speak in Oakland Next
Saturday Night.
The center of active Republican cam
paigning will be transferred to-day to
the San Joaquin Valley where James G.
Mag-uire has just concluded his efforts to
convince the voters that he is "the whole
thing"â Democrat, Populist, labor, every
thing but single tax. The latest reports
from the valley indicate that the Demo
cratic-Popocratic leader has made a
losing fight. It is now predicted that
San Joaquin County, upon which Mr. Ma
guire has based great hopes, will not
supply enough voters to carry the day for
him. Cheering news also comes from the
upper end of the valley, where leading
Democrats and Populists are abandoning
the Maguire standard and announcing
their intention to vote for Gage.
During this week Mr. Gage will be ac
companied by E. F. Preston of this city.
The itinerary will be Bakersfield. Mon
day; Tulare. Tuesday afternoon; Visalia.
Tuesday evening; Hanford, Wednesday;

TO MEET THE ROSEBUD.
Young Pluto, the Australian feather
weight, has signified his unwillingness to
meet Sammy Maxwell in a limited round
go, and the efforts that were being made
to effect a meeting of the two clever
lightweights are off. It is said, however,
that a match for young Pluto has been
found in the Kentucky Rosebud, a col
ored star of the Eastern firmament.
Whether the fresh proposition will result
In a go or not is a matter of conjecture,
but the fact is significant that on Fri
day Billy Kennedy mailed two tickets to
Philadelphia that are intended for the
transportation of the Rosebud and his
trainer to this city.
Gus Herget is still looking for some
thing in the line of fists to go up against
Sammy Maxwell, and he says that Max
