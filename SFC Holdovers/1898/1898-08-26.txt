CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA-
I sTO, Aug. 25.â The Republican
State Convention has passed into the
: -political history of California.
Its nominees are in the field ready
. for an active, aggressive battle for suc
c?fs. * The delegates have returned to
their homes, and after the noise and
confusion, the excitement and enthu
siasm of convention scenes, the capital
i ;ty has returned to its normal quiet
:and peace.
â¢.:".-' On every hand are congratulations.
The delegates express a belief that they
, have placed before the voters of Cali-
fornia a ticket that merits attention
'"â¢and will receive consideration. The
.. nominees enter the campaign with the
spur of coming success upon them, and
â â¢the- cÂ©nvfctloÂ» that they owe the hon-
oni already won to one of the most
representative conventions that ever
assembled in California.
In the history of convention Inci
dents The Call will find a conspicuous
place for its journalistic triumphs. On
Wednesday morning, before the con
vention had begun Its vital work of
nomination, The Call published a com
plete forecast of the ticket that the
State convention had assembled to
nominate. At that time all was con
fusion In the convention city. Scores
of aspirants for the different offices
were In the field clamoring for favor
arid votes. To many of the shrewdest

politicians in the State the situation
was chaotic as far as any certainty of
results was concerned. From the Gov
ernor to the least of district candidates
men were making and unmaking com
binations that, to the untrained judg
ment, seemed to preclude the predic
tion of the nominees. In the face of
these facts every newspaper, except
The Call, shrank from the labor and re
sponsibility of even guessing the re
sults. Other newspapers were not
prepared and could not undertake the
task that The Call assumed and sue-
cessfully accomplished. A forecast of
the entire State ticket, including all of
the executive offices and those of rail
â  road,, equalization and Congressional
, Districts, was published on Wednesday
â  morning. This forecast in every par
' tlcuiar, from one. end to the otter, -a-a*
absolutely accurate.
The nominees of the Republican State
SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, AUGUST 26, 1898.
Convention were thus published by The
Call before the delÂ°~fes had cast a
single ballot for a single candidate.
There has seldom been In the history
of newspaper work on the Pacific Coast
a triumph so complete. It illustrates
the thoroughness of The Call's news
paper service at Sacramento and ex
plains the natural advantages pos
sessed by The Call over other news
papers.
The task that was so successfully ac
complished involved a thorough and
very exhaustive poll of the general
convention and of every district
convention into which, on occasions,
the general convention was segregated.
To predict the results of the labors of
nearly 800 men moved by complex con
ditions and representing vast interests
required labor, patience and judgment.
The Call accomplished the feat and won
the greatest newspaper victory of the
convention.
In leaving the convention city the
delegates expressed the conviction that
they had performed a double task. They
are convinced that they have submitted
to the people of the State the names of
candidates who are known for their fit
ness, ability and probity.
For the politicians of the State the
delegates believe that they have sup
plied that other element of geographical
representation which is often so neces
sary for success. Every great geo
graphical division of California, every
great interest within the borders of the
State is represented on the State ticket.
This result is one of the most signifi
cant achievements of the convention
which has just adjourned, and it illus
trates with what care and judgment the
delegates performed the duties intrusted
to their care. The Republican S^ate
ticket four years ago was noticeably
defective In this regard.
One of the not least important victo
ries of the convention was its emphatic
and unmistakable repudiation of Rea
ism. The boss from Santa Clara was
justly humiliated in being thoroughly
discredited. His only nominee was de
feated by an overwhelming vote simply
because his sponsor was Jim Rea. For
the first time in many years the dele
gation from San Francisco asserted
an independence and insisted upon
recognition.
This assertion of liberty supplied an
other element of interest to the con
vention and won its reward In the suc
cess of a nominee.
The action of Alameda in withdraw
< ing from a contest in which It had cen
tered all its hope of recognition, and
upon which it lavished persistent effort,
is one of the results of the convention
that is now being most generally dis
cussed. This attitude of Alameda's
delegation had its effect in the conven
tion to-day. For the sake of harmony,
and with a belief that the strongest as
pirant should be given honor independ
ent of individual ambitions; many can
didates withdrew and made the unity
of Republicans throughout the State
absolutely sure.
This action on the part of various
delegations that had favorite candi
dates to present explains the incidents
of this morning's session of the conven
tion. Those men best fitted to lead the
fight in November won the coveted
places on the State ticket, and when
the great convention at last stood ad
journed three hearty cheers were given
and given again for the success of the
party and its nominees.

CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 25.â The only people here
who are not glad the convention is
over have wares to sell to thesojourner.
The delegates themselves felt an imme
diate sense of relief and flitted home
ward by the earliest train. The fag
end of a convention in hot weather is
not a time of gayety. There still re
mained an imitation enough to furnish
cheers to the winners and good will
enough for the defeated to join in ex
tending congratulations.
Heavy-eyed and listless the delegates
were in their seats about half an hour
later than the terms of adjournment
called for and nominating speeches were
soon in full blast. Not being a politi
cian, I am unable to appreciate the
utility of the average nominating
speech. A little spreading of eagle is
justifiable when so important an office
as that of Governor is at stake, but
beyond this I would limit such speeches
to thirty seconds and the seconding
speech to one second. After a candi
date has been formally projected into
consideration the delegates, having

known for weeks that he was in the
field, and having: had a period of days
in which to weigh his merits, the
eulogies expended for his benefit repre
sent a waste of wind and words, a trial
to the patience, the promotion of
perspiration, the production of profan
ity. Or to be specific they cause that
tired feeling.
There was only one speech yesterday
worth the span of time it consumed.
It was made by Van Duser, whose San
Francisco identity had been laldv aside
by virtue of a Siskiyou proxy, and he
begged for his new home in the north
the boon of recognition on the ticket.
He was reminiscent, personal, jocular,
voiceful. His range was from laughter
to tears, and he covered the distance
between at a 2:40 clip.
He was happy in the adaptation of
terms. He held up a map to show
how the northern "reconcentradoes"
were cut off by a "trocha" crossing the
State at Sacramento. Well done, but
ineffective.
Elwood Bruner made the only ad
dress of the day for the convention
which needs expurgation, and so well
did the speaker enjoy his infraction of
rules ordinarily prevailing among gen
tlemen that he repeated it. Like most
of the other speeches this one was sup
plied with an anti-climax.
The closing hours were marked by
the utmost harmony. Sections which
had fought and lost showed no Â«ign of
bitterness, but hastened to insist that
the selection of the triumphant oppo
sition be made, by acclamation.
Republicans are gratified at the char
acter of the ticket, and I do not hear
it praised by Democrats, a circum
stance which will also tend to elevate

MENTO Aug. 25.â Another fair day de
.iifcbted the delegates. They loitered into
the pavilion late as usual. Believing that
the unfinished business of the regular or
der could easily bÂ« disposed of before the
departure of the first afternoon train for
San Francisco the city delegates made no
haste to begin work. The members rep
resenting the interior counties did not
manifest impatience over the delay, but
waited on the pleasure of their fellow
men without a murmur.
Chairman Neff rapped the convention to
order at 10 o'clockâ thirty minutes later
than the appointed timeâ and announced
that the first business in order would be
the nomination of State Controller.
Immediately James MeLachlan of Los
Angeles ascended the steps of the plat
form and in a graceful speech presented
the name of E. P. Colgan of Sonoma. A
motion to close the nominations carried
and the 7SB votes of the convention were
cast for Mr. Colgan.
The office of Surveyor General, coming
next on the list, E. O. Larklns of Tulare
went to the forum and named for the
place on the ticket M. J. Wright of
Visalia.
George A. Wentworth of San Francisco
moved that the chairman cast 788 votes
"for Mr. Wright. Grove L. Johnson of
Sacramento seconded the motion. The
motion prevailed without dissent and Mr.

there would be a contest over the office
of State Treasurer, hence more than
usual attention was given when nomina
tions for that position were declared to
be in order.
John G. North of Riverside named for
the office Truman Reeves of San Bernar
dino, directing attention of the delegates
to Reeves' army service. In the battle
of Cold Harbor Reeves lost an arm, and
this gTeat sacrifice in the country's cause
was mentioned in the several speeches
which followed the nominating speech.
Mr. Reeves' nomination was seconded by
J. W. Cook of Santa Clara, and Elwood
Bruner of Sacramento.
A. P. Van Duier of Sleklyou fancied
that it was time to introduce a little op
position from a region In Northern Cali
fornia which cast forty thousand votes
for McKlniey. He depicted the Republi
cans of Northern California as reconcen
trados. He exhibited a map illustrating
the lines of the trocha within which the
Republicans of that section were starv
ing for recognition. Mr. Van Duser
placed in nomination Robert Nixon of
Yreka for State Treasurer.
E. Sevier of Humboldt advocated the
claims of Northern California for a place
on the ticket and closed by seconding
the suggestion to nominate Mr. Nixon.
General E. 8. Salomon of San Francisco
declared that he had not intended to
speak again in the convention, but In the
Interest of 20,000 veterans who live on
both sides of Van Duser's ditch he im
plored the convention to nominate Tru
man Reeves.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 26, 1898.
ALL OF THE DELEGATES READ THE "CALL" BEFORE ORDER IS CALLED.
Miles .Voody cf Alameda, representing
an organization of nine hundred old sol
diers and sailors, demanded that an old
soldier be placed on the ticket. He in
dorsed Truman Reeves.
A. B. Lemtnon of Sonoma spoke In favor
of recognizing the newspaper fraternity
and approved the nomination of Editor
Robert Nixon.
R. S. Taylor of Siskiyou seconded the
nomination of Robert Nixon, and ap
pealed to the good judgment and sense
of fairplay of the convention to accord to
Northern California some little recogni
tion on the ticket.
G. A. Sturtevant of Mendocino spoke in
behalf of Truman Reeves, citing the fact
that Siskiyou had won everything in the
district convention, and therefore had no
right to demand the nomination of Nixon.
Max Goldberg of San Francisco moved
that, nominations be closed. The motion
prevailed. The call of the roll was or
dered, resulting as follows: Nixon, 240;
Reeves, 544.
On motion of Mr. Sevier of Humboldt
the nomination of Mr. Reeves was made
unanimous. The chairman (A. Ruef pre
siding) announced that the Attorney Gen
eralship was next in order.
John F. Davis of Amador placfd in the
field Tlrey L. Ford of San Francisco, tak
ing occasion to eloquently allude to the
candidate's accompli sments in the law.
W. M. Abhott of San Francisco second
ed Mr. Ford's nomination.
M. L. Ward of San Diego, speaking on
behalf of W. C. Guy, the opposing candi
date, moved that the vote of the conven
tion be cast for Tirey L. Ford.
Chairman Neff, according to in
structions, cast the 778 votes for Mr. Ford
and declared him the nominee for Attor
ney General.
Superintendent of Public Instruction
was designated as the next office on the
list. Frank H. Short of Fresno submitted
to the convention the name of Thomas J.
Kirk of that county.
Chairman Neff called a halt in the regu
lar proceedings to mention that he ob
served on the floor of the convention Hon.
George C. Pardee, and therefore desired
that he should come forward and occupy
a seat on the platform. The doctor
obeyed the call. As he went forward the
delegates arose to their feet and gave
him a mighty round of cheering ap
plause.
Ira G. Hoitt of San Mateo seconded the
nomination of Mr. Kirk.
H. C. Flrebaugh of San Francisco moved
that the chair cast the ballot for Mr.
Kirk. The motion met no opposition.
Chairman Neff cast the 788 ballots as
directed and declared the result.
Next in .order was the position of Super
intendent of State Printing. Judge Swin
nerton of San Joaquln roasted Governor
Budd and placed in nomination A. J.
Johnston of Sacramento â the incumbent.
D. L. Fitzgerald of Alameda presented
the name of \V. W. Shannon of San Fran
cisco, and praised Mr. Shannon as a
worthy representative of his craft.
Grove L. Johnson, in behalf of every
school and all the school children of Cali
fornia, seconded the nomination of A. J.
Johnston.
On behalf of Mr. Shannon, D. L. Fitz
gerald moved that the ballot of the con
vention be cast for Mr. Johnston. The
motion was unanimously carried, and the
ballot was accordingly cast. The chair
announced the result.
E. F. Preston of San Mateo Introduced
the following 1 question, which was
adopted:
Resolvod, That the executive committee of
the Republican State Central Committee to be
named by the nominee of this convention for
Governor be and they are hereby authorized
and empowered to appoint the auditing com
mittee for the nominees of this convention, as
provided for In the act to promote the purity
of elections by regulating the conduct thereof
approved February 23, 1593.
Resuming the regular routine of busi
ness, the chair announced that candidates
for Clerk of the Supreme Court should
be named. Â«
A. B. Lemmon of Sonoma put in nomi
nation George \V. Root.
C. M. Belshaw of Contra Costa, W. H.
Galbraith of Santa Cruz, R. W. Church,
Rudolph Marshall and Dr. Tlsdale of Ala
meda and many other delegates joined in
asking that the nomination of Mr. Root
be made by acclamation. Following the
course which the lawyers suggested In
the Governor's nomination, the chairman
cast 788 ballots for George W. Root for
Clerk of the Supreme Court.
Chairman Nen", Jn a few remarks,
sought to impress the convention with the
importance of making promptly the se-
Ipt'tion of the best men to eomprisl; the
Republk;:i State Central Committee. The
roll was called by counties and names
were given to the secretary.
W. M. Cutter of Yuba moved that the
thanks of the convention be given to Hon.
Jacob Neff for the courtesy, impartiality
and ability displayed as presiding offi
cer.
Mr. Cutter put the motion and it was
carried with cheers.
W. F. Price of Sonoma moved that the
thanks of the convention be extended to
the people of Sacramento. The motion
carried.
On motion of Mr. Cutter the convention
with three rousing cheers for the ticket
adjourned sine die.

The conventon was called to order by
the charman at 10:15 a. m.
The chairâ The next business in order
will be the nomination of a candidate for
Controller.
James McLachlan â Mr. Chairman and
gentlemen of the convention: The gentle
man that I shall name for the office of
Controller of the State of California is dis
tinctly a man of the people. Born in a
humble cottage, a Native Son of the Gold
en "West, educated in the public schools of
the State of California, trained as an arti
san, by means of which in early manhood
ho earned his living by the sweat of his
brow. While his hands were yet callous
in his daily occupation he was elected
Sheriff of the county in which he was
born and had resided all his life. He was
re-elected and, so well did. he perform the
duties of that office that he was finally
elected Controller of the State of Cali
fornia. During his term of office he has
disbursed over sixty million dollars of the
funds of this State and not a word has
ever been uttered as to the manner in
which those funds have been distributed.
Fellow Republicans I need not even men
tion the name of the gentleman, for you
all know that I refer to E. P. Colgan, and
I now nominate him for that office. (Ap
plaise and cheers.)
It was moved and seconded that the
nominations close. Carried.
Senator E. C. Voorheis of Amadorâ Mr.
Chairman: I move that the chairman of
this convention cast the entire vote of
this convention for Mr. Colgan for State
Controller.
Seconded and carried unanimously.
The chairâ ln accordance with the mo
tion just carried, I have the honor to
announce that I have cast 788 votes on
behalf of this convention for the office
of Controller of State. (Applause.) I now
declare E. P. Colgan the nominee of this
convention for that office.
The chairâ The next order of business,
gentlemen, will be nominations for the
office of Surveyor General.
LARKIN OF TULARE
NAMES MR. WRIGHT
Social Qualities and Integrity of the
Surveyor General Praised by
the Speaker.
E. O. Larkln of Tulareâ Gentlemen of
this convention: That which commends
the Republican party to this nation is its
ability to do well whatever it undertakes,
its disposition to treat am sacred tlia rishta
of the most humble citizen and a realiza
tion that, after all, it is rmt the servant
of the people, each of whom is in himself
a sovereign.
1 have the honor to-day, gentlerten of
this convention, to place in nomination
a gentleman who believes that every citi
zen of this great commonwealth of the
State of California is a sovereign and en
titled to be treated as such whenever he
enters the office of the Surveyor General.
Whatever may be our rank, 'We are al
ways met with a smile and welcome in the
office of the Surveyor General. He is
willing to do our business well. Liko the
great party to which he belongs, he is
able to do and has ability to do well that
which he undertakes. Like the party to
which he belongs, he believes that the
rights of every citizen of this State of
California should be held sacred. In ail
of the great battles that the Republican
party has fought in defense of human
rights, in all the struggles for commercial
supremacy, in all of its contests for the
preservation of the American market for
the American product, he has stood the
champion of its liberty, a brave soldier in
its ranks.
I am not here for the purpose of urging
his nomination at the hands of any par
ticular delegation on this Boor, as I be
lieve that he is the choice of us all. He
belongs to us all. Whatever may be our
differences, gentlemen, upon other mat
ters, I believe that you will agree with
me that we are united upon M. J. Wright
for Surveyor General of the State of Cali
fornia. (Applause.)
Four years ago we of Tulare County
presented him to you as an experiment,
and stated to you that we believed him
to be an honest and an efficient officer;
but to-day he stands before you as no
experiment. He is ripe In the experience
of the office and has proved himself to be
a man of the people, a man capable of at
tending to the business of that office. He
was then as big as the county of Tulare;
but to-day, gentlemen, he is as big as the
State of California, and I hope that every
delegation on this floor will support M. J.
Wright for Surveyor General of the State
of California.
Mr Wentworth of San FranciscoâBe
lieving as I do that General Wright is
the unanimous choice of this convention
for the office of Suveyor General, I move
that the nominations be closed, and that
the chairman of this convention cast 788
votes for Mr. Wright for the office of
Surveyor General.
The chairâ Are there any .further nomi
nations?
Grove L. Johnson of Sacramentoâ Tn
behalf of the twenty-four delegates, and
in behalf of the 4600 Republicans of Sac
ramento County, who have learned about
Mr. Wright during the four years he has
been here, recognizing him as an hon
est man, a faithful public servant and
stanch Republican, we second the motion
of the gentleman from San Francisco.
The motion of Mr. Wentworth being
duly seconded and carried, the chair said:
The chairâ The chairman of the con
vention casts 788 votes for M. J. Wright
for the office of Surveyor General, as
the nominee of the Republican party. I
now declare M. J. Wright the nominee
of this convention for the office of Sur
veyor General.
The next order of business, gentlemen,
will be the nomination of a candidate for
the office of State Treasurer.
HONORING AN OLD
CRIPPLED SOLDIER
Truman Reeves of San Bernardino
Nominated for the State
Treasuryship.
Mr. North of Riversideâ Mr. Chairman
and gentlemen of the convention: In the
nominating speeches which have been
made before this convention we have
heard much regarding the war which has
just happily closed. We have heard
much of its magnificent successes. We
have heard much of the grand achieve
ments of those heroes who have, within
the past few months, blazoned their
names upon an imperishable page of our
country's history. But I say to you, gen
tlemen, that within our recollection this
country has passed through a war fraught
with more important issues, a war which
decided the very existence of the nation,
and these glorious deeds which we have
heard of here have but served to bring
afresh to our memory the trials, the perils
and the sacrifices of the men of 1861. It
is for one of these men, gentlemen of the
convention, that I ask your support. It
is for one of these men who, at the out
break of the war of the rebllion. took
his place in the ranks of his country's
defense. Who, as a member of the Sixth
Ohio Cavalry, fought through twenty
battles and left aa arm finally, ou the
bloody field of Cold Harbor. Gentlemen
of the convention, I place before you the
name of Truman Reeves of San Bernar
dino. (Applause).
Mr. Reeves -has been a resident of that
county for twenty years. During that
period he has been repeatedly nominated
and elected to public oflice. and has never
been defeated in a convention or at the
polls. He has always been elected, either
practically without opposition, or by a
majority far in advance of his party
strength. When I see. gentlemen, an
empty sleeve and know that the arm
which once filled it has been offered up
as a sacrifice on the altar of my coun
try, I resolve, gentlemen, that so far as
it lies within my power that sacrifice
shall not go unhonored and unrequited.
(Cries of "Time. time").
Gentlemen of the convention, time has
been called and I do not desire to de
tain you by any lengthy speech, but I
say to you cast your votes for that one
armed soldier, that upright citizen, that
honest man, that faithful Treasurer, Tru
man Reeves of San Bernardino.
J. W. Cook of Santa Claraâ Mr. Chair
man and gentlemen of the convention: I
toke great pleasure in seconding t,he nom
ination for the office of State Treasurer
my old friend and associate legislator,
Truman Reeves of San Bernardino (ap
plause), and when nominated, as he
surely will be, rest assured that that
empty sleeve, emptied at the battle of
Cold Harbor, will prove no handicap in
his race for the office of State Treasurer.
(Applause.)
Elwood Bruner of Sacramento â Mr.
Chairman and gentlemen of the conven
tion: When, a few months ago, the call
came from the gallant sons of the repub
lic to go forth to do battle for the honor
of the country, no greater thing was done
for the American citizenship than the
fact from that moment dated the obliter
ation of sectional lines throughout the
Unied States; from that moment it was
no longer the North or the South, the
blue or the gray, but it was a people
united by bonds of love, stirring forth in
the cause of humanity, and that done by
the American people. (Applause.)
Tv-day, as a member of this conven
tion from the northern part of the State,
I say to you that if the same feeling ex
ists between the north and south of this
State as when the war with Spain be
gan, the Democratic, Populist and Silver
Republican party will be wiped from
the face of the political map of Califor
nia as was the Spanish possessions of this
country, and on behalf of us from the
northern part of the State we extend to
you that hearty feeling and second the !
nomination of Truman B. Reeves of San
Bernardino County. (Applause.)
The Republican party has been too
modest. The Republican party has done
more for the welfare of the country and
of the world than any other political
party that has ever existed. The Demo
cratic party, that political harlot that
sleeps more than two in a bed, has joined
hands to defeat the will of the people:
has opposed every interest that the Re
publican party has put forth In the many
years of Its existence. It opposed the
homestead laws, it opposed the pension
laws, and It was a Democratic President
who vetoed the giving In one term of 600
private pension bills. It was the Demo
cratic party, a Democratic Governor, that
within two months past discharged from
employment, for political reasons, an old
soldier of the Union, and It is time for
our party to take these matters up and
show to the people of the country that we
will stand by our old soldiers and sailors;
that we will put ourselves forward for
what we have done. (Applause )
Of the man from San Bernardino I have
this much to say: That he was a man
who, when the call to arms came in 1861,
went forward to do battle for his coun
try, and when his term of enlistment
expired he re-enlisted, until in one of the
trenches at Cold Harbor his arm was shot
away, and he was released from service.
I have this to say: That the man who
will go forth to do batle? O'l (|'!(|'!SH
will go forth in battle to defend his coun
try's honor will with his life defend his
country's treasury. That man is Truman
B. Reeves. (Applause.)

VAN DUZER TALKS WAR
FOR FRIEND NIXON
Be Thinks the State Will Tip Up With
the Weight of Southern
Candidates.
Mr. Van Duzerâ Mr. Chairman and gen
tlemen of the convention: This acclama
tion business saves time, and la a good
thing for the candidates, but It doesn't
look well in the newspapers. I think it
is about time now to have a little op
position, and we have in Northern Cali
fornia a man. There I spent the best
days of my life before I came to San
Francisco. â¢' lt was forty-one years ago
that I arrived In - Slsklyou County. Cali
fornia, and the first man I met â¢ making
battle then for the Republican party, one
of seventeen who voted for John C. Fre
mont in 1856, was the man I nominate
here to-day for State Treasurer of the
State of California.
I want to say here that there. is no
man living who has a greater regard and
a higher veneration for the Grand Army
of the Republic, and I say for them that
they do not come here demanding an of
fice, not a bit of it. Of course, we can
compliment them. There are thonsands
of places which they can be given; there
are hundreds of 'places of honor and emol
ument in which they have been placed by
the Republican party. And when I say
that. I place before, you to-day a veter
an Republican, who has held aloft the
banner of our party in the Democratic
end of this State for forty years, and has
changed that part of the State from two
to one Democratic until it is now a Re
publican district by his efforts alone. V
Now, my friend who has just taken his
seat says he is speaking for the north.
Have they moved the State Capitol?
(Laughter.) I didn't know , it. Is Sac
ramento in the northern end ot Califor
nia? If it is I did not realize it. The
gentleman is a delegate from Sacra
mento. Now, gentlemen, I want to say
one thing here, and don't call time on
me, because we have plenty of time. I
want to say to you this: This Â«iio sen
timental business at all, for ii 1Â»* great
office. The State Treasurer is noT"ft mat
ter of sentiment; it is a matter of strict
political business. - â 'â 'Â-.
Look here (exhibiting a map). Do you
know what the situation of this ticket
is, saying nothing of geography? But,
look at this. Here is a map of Califor
nia. I want to hang it up here as an
object lesson. Do you see that? Do you
see that part, the blue band running long
the north side of Sacramento County m
a line from the ocean to the mountain.
Every office on the State ticket .i.~ south
of that line. Look at it, and ask your- 1
selves if that is good, common, norse
-sense. (Applause.) That Is what I want
to show you.- I say that this represents
150 Republican delegates sitting in mis
convention north of the north line Â«i

.to challenge you as to -because
they do not get this nomination, they asK
it as a matter of = right and justice 11
you do not give it to them, they will â¢ t Â®

vote any other ticket. But, as a matter or
right and justice. -I want to say. to you.
I â  know s the : miners in the mountains-^

years of my life. I know they are rougn

you want to. Don't you do it. Don't you

â¢ ing's' Examiner, is running away from
his record. i wrote the single tax plank
and .put it in the platform word for
. word as it is now. He says this morning
he .did not deny he was the apostle of
.-single tax, but he pays it is not of record.
r.:ist March he stood In Congress and
made a speech for that infamous doctrine
that all taxes should be placed upon land;
that no single man living can get a title
to. his homestead; he cannot get title to
the homestead where his wife and chil
dren have decorated his home. He can
not get a title to his grave where sle<'p
the dear ones of his. O, no, I say he hus
. run away from his record. We will pur
sue him as our gallant ships pursued the
â  Spanish fleet, and will shatter his army,
. as ..that Spanish fleet that went down to
\ the depths of the sea, and with it
bigotry, cruelty and wrong and blood, to
â  the bottom of the ocean, so shall the old
â¢.Democratic craft be sunk. , t
â¢' ' '"We-, have come here in the cause of
-Robert Nixon. Do you know who he is?
â JDr>' you know what kind of stock he is

Nixon, was the high sheriff of the Vigi

â  : E. SevlET of Humboidt CountyâGentle

of the north to demand that the north

'Mr. 1 Salomon of San Franciscoâ Mr.

'et.-fwo years ago when the names were
presented of the standard bearers of the

have just been told of the great and

(Applause.) You have been shown his
geographical location, and what that

TAYLOR OF SISKIYOU
POINTS TO THE MAP
Bis County Nearer the North Pole
Than Is the Citrus Belt of
California.
n. 8. Taylor of Slskiyouâ Mr. Chairman
and gentlemen of the convention: Bear
with me hut a very few moments. J urn
o.nly' a part of the dummy show that
comes down from the northern part of the
Stat". We go through the performance
biennially, and we go home, as usu.il,
with nothing. Who elected your Con
gressmen from the northern part of the
State, and the only Republican Congress
men that were elected last time?
A voice â The north.
Mr. Taylorâ That is right; it was the
north. You have seen the map. The gen
tlemen from Sacramento rxhorted us to
be united. Is Sacramento County the ce
ment that binds Northern California to
Southern California? In union there is
strength. It Is known to us men that
every office goes below Sacramento and
nothing to the north. Is that common
sense? Is that strength? It is true that
your candidate has an empty sleeve. \\ c
say to him, "He is honored." Our nation
honors the soldier. We say he is a living
monument of our country's chivalry. M c
grant him that. Heroic as we are, going
home with none of the fruits nor spoils
of victory, we take off our Jackets and go
to work as Republicans. We elect our
man; we roll up the majorities. How long
will you ask us to continue it without
recognition? You are asking us again to
return to our homes, and you expect us
to meet a new foe this time, and expect
us to put on our armor and fight â what?
The product, the fruits of the union of
Populism and Democracy; an infant just
bornâ the leprous progeny of a most un
natural union. You want us. 1 say. to re
turn to our homes, put on our armor ana
fight this new foe, and there is not one
place on the ticket that you can accord
to us. Is that good politics? Is it good
sense Is the press to have no voice in
all of Northern California, from Sacra
mento up? He is not only an editor, but
the editor who has stood steadfast in
every fleht we have made. \\e ask on
behalf o! the north that you take another
look at the map and accord us fair and
decent recognition if it be in thermal
event of things to do so. (Applause.)
Mr Sturtevant of Mendocinoâ Mr.
Chairman and gentlemen of the conven
tion' Just one word, please. I wont
take up your time but a minute. lam
only here to ask for fair play. Last
nieht I was present in the railroad dis
trict convention. I heard a gentleman
who has been here and addressed this
convention from this platform on this
very question get up there and say that
they must have a representative on the
ticket, that they must have the gentie
man from Siskyou as Railroad Commis
sioner. I got up there and said you
must do it, too; you must give them a
representative up there; you must give
them one man from Siskiyou, If you can
possibly do it. And then this gentleman
from Sacramento opposed it, but it never
theless was carried, and the very credi
table gentleman, Mr. Edson, from Sis
kiyou was put on the ticket. â¢ Now, gen
tlemen, divide these otiices all around
over the State, and give every county
its fair share. We do not ask one in
Mendocino. We let every county in the
State have everything and we never ask
anything. We let Sonoma County and
Sacramento County and Alameda County
take what Los Angeles leaves.
A delegate from Alamedaâ What has
Alameda County got?
Mr. Sturtevantâ That is all right; this
gentleman from San Bernardino comes
to you most highly recommended. Noth
ing is urged against him. San Bernar
dino has got nothing. Give them that.
They are entitled to it.
It was moved and seconded that the
nominations be now closed. Carried.
During the roll call it was moved and
seconded that the nomination of Mr.
Reeves be made unanimous. Carried.
Mr. Wentworth moved that the candi
dates appear at the convention this after
noon and indorse the platform. It was
moved and seconded that the motion
made by Mr. Wentworth be laid upon
the table. Carried.
The chairâ The next in the order of bus
iness, gentlemen, will be nominations for
the office of Attorney General.
TIREY L. FORD FOR
ATTORNEY GENERAL
Placed in Nomination by Judge Davis
of Amador in a Eulogistic
Speech.
Judge John F. Davis of Amadorâ Mr.
Chairman and gentlemen of this Republi
can convention: I appear before you at
this time to place in nomination for the
office of Attorney Genera! of the State of
California the Hon. Tirey L. Ford of San
Francisco. You all know the man, and
you all know his record for cleanness, for
integrity and for ability- There is no
candidate that has come before this con
vention that is better loved as a man for
all that is good In him and for all that he
represents than the Hon. Tirey L. Ford of
San Francisco. (Applause.) As a lawyer
he is one of the keenest minds of this
State He started where all start at law,
at the foot of the ladder, and he has
wnrkpd his way up. For four years he
was District Attorney of the County of
Sierra For four years he represented the
d strict of Plumas. Sierra and Nevada in
the State Senate, and there, under the
leadership of that man whose name is an
inspiration to the mountain and is no
firebrand to the valley-the Hon. Jacob
Npff of Placerâ he became the leader of
the miners throughout the State of Cali
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 2<>, 1398.
; fornla. Something has been said here to
i day that the miners should have a rep
resentative, and I say to this great con
vention of the Republican party that al
though Mr. Ford comes from San t ran
cisco, his name is a household word in
every gulch and ravine and in every
miner's cabin throughout the length and
breadth of this great State of California.
He has endeared himself to the mountain
people so that, thougn you have him as
your resident in San Francisco, we claim
him as ours, and we refuse to have it
said that he represents only one section
of the State, but that he represents us
as well as he does the metropolis. His
career as a lawyer in San Francisco, as
attorney of the State Board of Harbor
Commissionersâ an office which he has
held now for almost four yearsâ has
placed before the people of this fetate a
record upon one fight which is the test
which indicates the character of the man.
I For twenty-five years there has existed a
controversy between the city and county
of San Francisco and the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company on the. question of who
should be the owner of Channel street in
that city. Though that controversy has
existed all these years, and though it has
engaged the attention of different men
who have been attorneys for the State
Board of Harbor Commissioners in the
past, it was reserved for Tirey i< ord to
make the fight that finally gave us a vic
tory against that corporation for what
actually and rightfully belonged to the
city and county of San Francisco. It is
to him that you to-day owe the fact that
Channel street belongs to that city. 1
eive you as the nominee for attorney
General of this State, Hon. Tirey L. * ord.
(Applause and cheers.)
Mr Selvage of San Franciscoâ Mr.
Chairman and gentlemen of the conven
tion: On behalf of the young men of this
State, and on behalf of the young men
of San Francisco in particular, I desire
to second the nomination of Hon. Tirey U.
Ford for the office of Attorney General
of this State. If you want a man of high
character, of sterling worth, of strict in
tegrity, of eminent legal ability, and a
i thorough dyed-in-the-wool Republican,
I then he is the ideal candidate. I speak,
Kentlemen, from a personal knowledge
when I say that Mr. Ford has the courage
to fight the demands of corporate power,
for it has been my pleasure to have been
associated with him in le-al contests
against the allied corporations of the
Southern Pacific. You may rest assured
that the potent influence of their finger
Is not nor will it be found resting upon
him. Give us, gentlemen, Tirey Ford
for Attorney General and the enthusiasm

THOMAS J. KIRK OF
FRESNO WINS OUT
There Will Be a Hot Time in the
Baisin Center When He Takes
the Stump.
Judge Short of Fresno â Gentlemen: If
you will divide time with me, it will
take me quite a while to say what I de
sire, but if you will allow me to talk
I will get through in three minutes. You
have heard a great deal of discussion
to-day about the north and south. We
have the honor to have within the city
of Fresno a monument that marks the
geographical center of the State of Cali
fornia, and I now come to invite you
gentlemen to come to the center. (Laugh
ter and applause.) Gentlemen of this
convention, we Republicans of the San
Joaquin Valley are a very modest people,
present company excepted, and, gentle
men, we have not asked much in the past
history of the party at the hands of the
Republican party, but we have with us
a gentleman who has aided us in the
long fight that we have fought in that
part of the State, that has at last re
deemed that part of the State from Dem
ocratic rule and placed it in line with
the Republican party of the State. That
gentleman has been for eight years
County Superintendent of Schools of
that county. He is honored and esteem
ed In that capacity, and in that portion
of the State. As president of the State
Teachers' Association of this State, he
Is known and honored among the educa
tional profession. We understand that
this matter of the public schools is close
to the homes and the hearths of the peo
ple of this State. We would present no
man for that honorable office who was
not entitled to it, and who would not
advance its cause. The peculiar boast
of the Republican party is in the public
schools, and therefore we name a leader
in the educational interests of this State
for this officeâ the Hon. Thomas Kirk.
(Applause and cheers.)
Ira G. Holtt of San Mateoâ Mr. Chair
man and gentlemen of the convention: I
rise to second the nomination of Thomas
J. Kirk of Fresno for the office of Suner
int<-ndent of Public Instruction. On behalf
of ex-State Superintendent Crandall, on
behalf of ex-State Superintendent Ander
son, and having occupied the office my
self. I feel that I know the du
ties of the office, and being personally ac
quainted with the candidate, with his
ability, his energy and his executive
force," I can heartily indorse and second
his nomination. Mr. Kirk has not the
good fortune to be a native-born Califor
nian, but I am sure that if he is ever
born again and has anything to say
about it himself, he will be born in Cali
fornia. (Laughter.) He has been in Cali
fornia for nearly a quarter of a century,
and during that time he has been en
gaged in training up that type of citizen
called Americanâ the strongest, the no
blest and the best. Such a type of citi
zen will stand by that flag and make it
broad enough and its power strong
enough to protect every American citizen
in whatever part of the globe the flag Is
allowed to float. I thank you, gentlemen.
It was moved and seconded that the
nominations close, and that the chairman
oi this convention cast the ballot for
Thomas J. Kirk for, the office of Superin
tendent of Public" Instruction. Carried
unanimously.
The chairâ For Superintendent of Pub
lic Instruction. Thomas J. Kirk, 788 votes.
I therefore declare him to be the nominee
of ihis convention for Superintendent of
Public Instruction. The next business in
order is Superintendent of State Print
ing. Nominations are now in order.

Judge Swinnerton of San Joaquln Coun
tyâGentlemen of the convention: We are
near the end of a Democratic administra

that it is the latter end. (Applause.) We
have had four years of benevolent despot
ism the Governor has taken the people by
the' throat and said: "Now, i you rascals,
economize or I will be , the death of you."
He has economized the people of this State
out of about a s million and a quarter of
dollars extra taxes. He has economized
every one of the sixty-one State offices
and the heads of departments. and com
missioners out of the means to give to the
people an account of their stewardship.
He has economized the children of this
State into the payment of 100 per cent ad
vance on school books and he, has econo
mized the State school registers from
seventeen cents furnished by the State
Printer. -to seven ty-flve cents ; produced
in the open market. Now, among these
items of economy there - are , two things
that stood out prominently. One was

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 25.â The city looks desert
ed to-night. The last of the delegates to
the Republican State Convention left on
the evening train, cheering for Gage and
the entire State ticket. The work of
the convention was concluded about 12:30
o'clock, and many of the delegates hur
ried from the convention hall to pack
their grips and take the afternoon train.
Those who remained behind had still
district convention work to perform. The
Fourth Equalization and Third Railroad
District conventions did not adjourn un
til it was too late to catch the first train,
and as a result fully 500 delegates and
gentleman is a native of this State. For
a quarter of a century he has pursued a
craft that makes him a competent man
for this position. W. W. Shannon of
San Francisco has been the representa
tive of his craft to the national body in
the United States time after time. He
has proven himself a worthy representa
tive of that craft. I think you
will get the support of the crafts
men whether you nominate him or
not, but if you desire the earnest sup
port and the enthusiastic support or
every printer within the confines of the
State of California you will nominate W.
W. Shannon of San Francisco. That
office, if he receives the nomination of
this body and I think he will, will be as
economically conducted and as well con
ducted as it is at present. Gentlemen, I
desire to place in nomination for the of

State of California that hopes to attend
the common schools, in behalf of the par

man who, more than any other man in
the State of California, represents to-day
the common schools, and the public
school books, and the State printing of
school books in California. A. J. John

In nominating Mr. Johnston, you give
force and point to the platform which
condemns Governor Budd. In nominat

meant what you said. In nominating
him you snap your condemnation upon
the wicked act of this rotten Budd of
California (laughter and applause) that
sought to pluck the flower of a bastard
economy for himself and his party by
crippling the public schools of
California. (Applause and cheers.) The
common schools of California are the
bulwark of our liberties, the hope of our
prosperity. You, who like myself, ob
tained your education in the common
schools, know their worth, know their
value. Palsied be the hand, whether it ia
that of a Prince, a politician or a Gover

schools. You cannot manifest your love
for the common schools, you cannot man
ifest your belief in their dignity and their
greatness, any better than by voting for
Al Johnston, the honest man, the faith

man in the State, for State printer. (Ap

EARL IS ACCUSED BY STANLEY
TREACHERY
AMONG THE
ALAMEDANS
Guy C. Earl Is Charged by
James Stanley With Sub
serving His Own Ends.
Said to Have Taken Sides With the Enemies
of Pardee and the Men Who
Defeated Him.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, OAKLAND.
Aug. 25.â James Stanley of Mission San
Jose, who served several terms in this
county as Public Administrator, and who
was supposed to be a candidate for the
State Board of Equalization from this
district, created some excitement to
night by publishing the following state
ment:
I was a candidate for the State
Board of Equalizaton from Alameda
County, and was instrumental in
electing the nine delegates to the
State Convention from the Forty-
Birth Assembly District. This was
one of the moves that made the coun
ty delegation solid for Pardee.
Because of the stand I took on be
half of Dr. Pardee I was assured by
that gentleman of the support of his
entire delegation from this county In
my fight.
My lifelong friend, and N until re
cently my attorney, Guy C. Earl, who
was making Pardee's fight, assured
me that after the gubernatorial fight
was over he would use every effort
to secure my nomination.
The effort that he made will show
exactly where his interest lay. On my
arrival at Sacramento last Monday
evening I was Informed of a caucus
held that day by the Alameda Coun
ty delegation. The delegation re
fused to trade on the office I was
seeking. At 2 o'clock Tuesday morn
ing my friend, Guy Earl, informed
me that no trade had been made. He
also told me that the Alameda city
delegation and a portion of the
Fourth Ward delegation were for
Morehouee. who was not a candidate,
and that the Calaveras man, Brown,
had a cinch on the nomination. He
knew all this to be an absolute false
hood, because Mr. Brown never could
have received the nomination with
out securing nine votes from Alameda
County.
At that time Earl had traded forty
flve- votes for ten without the consent
of the Alameda delegation. He knew
then that the caucus had refused to
make a trade on this office, and he
did this on his own responsibility and
without the consent of the delegates.
The next day G. B. Daniels spent his
time interviewing the delegates, get
ting their consent to ratify Earl's ac
tion. The result showed that by the
combined effort of Mr. Earl and all
his friends they could only deliver
thirty-two of the forty-five, which
they did under pressure. At no time
could the ten votes of Calaveras Coun
ty do Pardee any good.
It remains for Mr. Earl to explain
how Alameda County could be bene
fited by agreeing to give forty-five
votes for ten, knowing at the time
that Pardee was beaten and out of
the race.
The only excuse he has to offer is
that in the temporary organiztion of
the convention there might have been
a chance to break the slate. His
course afterward showed that he was
a party to the slate or programme.
â¢ He united with the very men who de
feated George C. Pardee for the nom
ination. By the trade he made with
the Brown delegation, which secured
ADVERTISEMENTS.
Pears'
No other soap in
the world is used so
much ; or so little of
it goes so far.
for the latter the nomination, the lat
ter sought, Earl defeated the only
chance Alameda County had to get a
place on the ticket.
It was a -well-known fact that
Brown was a slated candidate and re
ceived the support of the railroad.
The course that Guy Earl pursued
in the Brown matter and his abso
lute programming' subsequently show
ed conclusively that his interests were
all with the programme or slate men;
the enemies of Dr. Pardee and the
men who defeated him.
In conclusion I may add that Guy
C. Earl's interests were not those of
Dr. Pardee or any other Alameda
County candidate. He simply used the
delegation elected by Dr. Pardee to
further his (Earl's) own interests, as
the political boss of the Second "Ward.
I am not giving this publication un
der the sting of defeat, as I did not
expect to receive the nomination. I
simply give these few facts as an ex
planation of the conduct of a man
whom I have befriended and have
been associated with for years, and
who claims to represent Alameda
County. He has betrayed me as well
as Dr. Pardee. He has betrayed Ala
meda County, which once honored
him and pushed him to the front for
a time.
The letter of James Stanley, taken in
connection with various other letters that
are now being produced, presages a warm
county campaign. The statements pub
lished in to-day's Call referring to a let
ter written by Lou Brown asking his
friends to support any ticket on wnich
appeared tho name of Joe Lanktree, has
brought forth another document of the
same nature. The second one, bearing
Lou Brown's signature, is a personal let
ter exhibited this morning by Attorney
R. B. Tappan of Alameda, in which
Brown says that Lanktree and Tisdaie
were his friends and could be safely sup
ported. Recorder St. Sure said this morn
ing that he had seen a letter written to
Alfred Baroteau from Lou Brown advis
ing support for the unpledged ticket in
Alameda. This is the' ticket that caused
the discussion at Sacramento which has
developed Into a disagreement of grave
proportions among the camps of the vari
ous candidates for county office.
When coming down on the train from
Sacramento the Pondinkey Club and the
Young Men's Republican League passed
the following resolution:
We, the undersigned members of
the Pondinkey Club and Young Men's
Republican League, returnine- from
the State Republican convention held
August 23, 1898, do hereby reaffirm our
allegiance to the Republican party and
again voice our intention to support
the nominees.
But we do at this time express our
renewed confidence, in George C. Par
dee; that he is a natural leader of
men: that we are not unmindful of the
inspiring lesson of party fealty he has
this day plven us In withdrawing his
name from consideration of the Re
publican convention in the interests of
harmony and for the success of the
party.
And for ourselves and the young:
men of Ainmeda County we pledge
him enthusiastic support should ne see
fit to again be a candidate for Gover
nor of the State of California.
WORKING FOR THE
NICARAGUA CANAL
CONVENTION TO BE HELD IN
CHICAGO IN NOVEMBER.
Efforts to Have Congress Take Up
the Question on the Opening of
the Coming Session.
In all probability the Nicaragua canal
question will be one of the most Important
that will come before the next Congress,
which will meet In the latter part of the
year. A strong movement is now on foot
to have a Nicaragua canal convention
held in Chicago on November 15, 18 and
17, at which ways and means will be de
vised for getting the matter properly pre
sented to the lawmakers of the country.
One of the most active organizations In
this movement la the American Nicaragua J
THE SAN FRAN CISCO CAJLL, lItiDAY, AUGUST 26, lbsÃ.
Canal Association, located In San Diego.
Yesterday the local Chamber of Com
merce received a letter from the secre
tary, R. H. Young, inclosing a circular
setting: forth the purposes of the organiza
tion. One object is to secure the earliest
possible favorable legislation by Congress.
Among other points it is desired to have
the canal built, operated and owned by
America. The great advantages of this
Is discussed at length, and particular ref
erence is made to the recent long voyage
of the battleship Oregon.
According to the desires of that body
the convention will be composed of dole
gates appointed by the President of the
United States. Nicaragua and Costa Rica,
State Governors, counties, cities, Cham
bers of Commerce. Boards of Trade and
all commercial bodies. In the letter re
ceived yesterday Secretary' Young says:
â¢ â¢ â¢ We in<?lose copy of a proposed call
for a proposed Nlcaraguan canal congress to
be held, most likely. In the city of Chicago
next November. Everything seems to be go
ing our way and It looks as though the Nicar
agua Canal is on the slate sure; still, the ene
my might do some work that would result In
delay, by referring the whole matter to a com
mittee or demand further surveys or something
of the kind. We are receiving many letters
and find general and active Interest ; In the
canal. We are, in answering the same, urging
all to work for early action. It occurs to us
that If a canal congress were held, as pro
posed, and a strong committee appointed to
wait, first upon the President and then to ap
pear before Congress, that said committee
might so present the question, backed up as
â¢they would be by the entire country, that Con
gress would take up the matter at once and
stay with It until It was settled. â¢ '
Our association Is becoming quite strong and
we are in hopes that In all the cities of the
country other commercial bodies will take up
the popular movement and see to It that canal
associations are organized. -- * â â¢^â ^
The position .of the local Chamber of
Commerce Is well known on the Nicara

at once answered that the San Diego or

for all the help and support possible to

JIM REA IS
DEFEATED
People of San Jose Re
joice at His De
feat.
Did Not Want the San Jose
Boss to Hake State
Politics.
SAN JOBE, Aug. 25.â There were
smiles on hundreds of happy faces on
the streets to-day over the turning
down of Boss Rea and his man Austin
in the Republican State Convention.
The people of San Jose are beginning
to realize. that Rea Is not only distaste
ful to them but to the State at large.
Austin's desire to be Secretary of State
was not taken seriously by the resi
dents of the city and county and no one
outside of the Rea gang thought he
stood any show for the place. Rea's
braggadocio was even appalling, and
when he made the statement that he
was going to run the convention and
nominate Austin knowing ones winked.
For years Rea has had an ambition
to take a hand In State politics, and In
the placing of Austin he saw a possible
chance of extending his bailiwick as a
political boss. The quietus given him
yesterday, coming so quickly upon the
"rolling" he received at the hands of

utmost privacy would be observed. A
request was made for a personal inter

GEORGE GREEN IN TOWN.
He Has Backing to Fight Any Wel
ter-Weight â Jimmy Carroll
in Dawson City.
George Green, the welterweight pugi
list, arrived yesterday from the East." He
is in the company of a man of money
named J. H. Quann of Vancouver, B. C,
and can find backing to the extent of
$10,000 to fight any welterweight in the
country. Green looks first class and said
that he was very glad to return to his
native city.
"The weather is so exceedingly warm
in New York," he eaid, "that when train
ing for a fight you grow weak instead
of strong. I was not in prime condition
the night I fought Smith, but as he
promised me a return 1 match the chances
are that we will meet again in this city.
This is the only place to train for a mill
and the sporting people of Frisco will
always turn out to see a good fight. The
game is getting murdered in New York
on account of the many clubs that are
running. I should not be surprised to
see O'Roufke out here soon. The Irish
of New York are very sweet on Sharkey:
they consider that he is the champion of
the heavyweights. That trouble, or
rather reported trouble, I had with Cor
bett amounted to nothing. Jim and I
are on the best of terms and always will
be."
Billy Jordan received a long letter from
Jimmy Carroll a few days ago. The pugi
list and his family arrived safely in Daw
son and they hope to strike it rich when
they are settled down to business. Car
roll says that the match which was to
have taken place in Dawson on July 4
between Frank Allen and Frank Raphael
fell through, and that Allen, Slavin and
Raphael are having a hard time making
enough money with which to buy food.
He also states that "Swiftwater Bill"
was a hlppodromer and that his saloon
was Bold out by the Sheriff. The pugi
list advises all men without plenty of
money and provisions to remain away
from Dawson.
STOLE GAS BURNERS.
Jacob Strelitz, an Old Man, Sent to
Jail for One Year.
Jacob Strelitz, a gjay haired old man,
was sent to the County Jail for one year
by Judge Mogan yesterday. He was ar
rested some days ago by Detectives
Ryan and ODea on three charges of
burglary, but he consented to plead
guilty to petty larceny and the charges
were accordingly reduced.
Strelitz was for years a merchant tailor
In this city and his family are in good
circumstances. For some years he has
been possessed of a mania to visit houses
to let and steal automatic gas burners
which he sold to second-hand dealers.
He had visited one of Dr. Buckley's
vacant houses three times within the
past six months and stolen all the gas
burners. The old man did not say a
word in his own defense.

EARL DID
NOT BETRAY
THE DOCTOR
Stanley's Charges Termed the
Utterances of a Disap
pointed Candidate.
Pardee Affirms That His Political Manager
Served His Interests Well at the
Convention.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, OAKLAND,
Aug-. 25.â Dr. George C. Pardee and Sen
ator Guy C. Earl returned from Sacra-
I mento this evening, and their attention
i was at once called to the letter made
i public by James Stanley. The two gen
! tlemen sat in the doctor's library and nar
rated in detail all that happened in con
nection with trading the Alameda delega
tion at the State Convention.
"The statement made by Stanley," said
Dr. Pardee, "is farcical, and his assump
tion that Senator Earl betrayed md at
Sacramento is as false and ridiculous as I
It le gratuitous. The statement is so
clearly the utterance of a disappointed
candidate as to be unworthy of notice.
Senator Earl had and still has my Im
plicit confidence, and I will swear that
he did everything possible at Sacramento
to further my cause. He acted judicious
ly and honorably, and all statements to
the contrary are unqualifiedly false. Noth
ing was done without consulting me. Earl
was the only man who succeeded in in
ducing one of the slate men to break
away from the leadership, and this was
done by Brown of Calaveras when he
voted for Campbell for chairman of the
convention."
Senator Earl referred to the passage of
the resolution by the Alameda caucus
that gave Dr. Pardee absolute control of
fifty-nine of the delegation and partial
control of the remaining nine. He then
said: "Mr. Stanley has misrepresented
matters from beginning to end. He as
sumes all kinds or false and Illogical posi
tions and then proceeds to immolate me
upon the altar of his own baseless
theories.
"Mr. Stanley only came from the Klon
dike after Dr. Pardee had really won- his
fight in Washington township. Yet he
says that because of the stand he took on
behalf of Pardee he was promised the
support of his entire delegation from this
county in his fight for State Equalizer. I
have yet to find with whom he had such
an assurance, for everybody whom he has
yet mentioned has denied any such trans
action. Now, I will relate a little inside I
history. Brown of Calaveras knew he
had strength enough, with some help from I
Alameda, to secure the nomination from
the Third District."
"He showed his strength and promised
us twenty-seven votes for Dr. Pardee. '
Owing to the resolution empowering us I
to trade, we agreed to give the Cala- 1
veras man fifty votes; this left out the I
seven from Alameda and the nine from
Washington Township of which we were
a shade doubtful. After this was done
Stanley met me and said it was contfary
to agreement to trade on State Equal
izer. I told him that It was unanimously I
agreed to trade for anything for Dr Par- I
dee's advantage. He said Dr. Pardee I
was already beaten, and he (Stanley) !
wanted the delegation. This was sheer I
nonsense, as at that time there/ was a
plan on foot to combine all the candi- I
dates against Gage, and the test was to
come on the vote for temporary chair
man.
"The test came, and the votes for I
Campbell that were promised by Brown, j
Flint, Dickinson and Patton, did not i
materialize. Brown of Calaveras was a '
slate candidate, and yet he kept his |
trade and delivered thirty-three votes, |
six in excess of his pledge to Campbell, !
so as to help Pardee. When Stanley saw '
how the vote on chairman stood, he pro
posed that we let our trade with Cala- ;
yeras slide. This was preposterous, af
ter Brown had prejudiced his position I
with the leaders for the sake of Pardee. !
and we voted thirty-two votes for Brown I
in the Third District Convention, and |
would have kept our word and delivered f
fifty but for the absence of some of Ala
rneda's delegation. That is the truth, and
I think that no Intelligent man, much \
less a politician, such as Mr. Stanley pro
fesses to be, should desire any further
explanation.
"As to Mr. Stanley's 'befriending' me
and his 'life-long friendship' I do not de
sire to speak. I have known Mr. Stanley
for about ten years, and when he was I
Public Administrator I was one of his
attorneys. We have done business to
gether, but it is absurd for him to imag â¢ i
me that all the work done In Alameda
County for Dr. Pardee was to be ap
propriated by him and by his dictation.
As to Stanley's utterances that I united
with the men who made the slate and
who defeated Dr. Pardee, the doctor has I
already answered. Stanley says 'Guy C.
Earl, who was making Pardee's fight, as
sured me that after the gubernatorial
ngbt was over he would usÂ© every effort '
to secure my nomination.' This is untrue
I told Stanley we would do what wÂ«
could for him, after Dr. Pardee was
through with the delegation, but this did
not suit him.
"The falsehood that I 'simply used thÂ«
delegation elected by Dr. Pardee to fur
ther his (Earl's) own interests as thÂ«
political boss of the Second Ward' is too
childish to notice. I would like to know
how the keeping of an agreement witb
Calaveras County could further any in
terests I may have in the Second Ward.
"In conclusion I feel constrained to say
that Mr. Stanley's remark that his ut
terances are vented under the sting ol
defeat, is an unfortunate one, as it \s
wide open to criticism. I can only refei
Mr. Stanley for an example of how to
come out of a contest to Dr. Pardee,
whom Stanley declares I betrayed."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ASHFIEKD, Mass., Aug. 25.â The
twentieth annual dinner in aid of the
Sanderson Academy was given this af
ternoon with Charles Eliot Norton,
president emeritus of fine arts of Har
vard, University, presiding.
The principal address was by Profes
sor Norton, who devoted himself to a
discussion of the late war. He referred
to the academy's prosperity during the
year, and continued as follows: "And
yet our hearts have been heavy with a
new weight of care and the very
brightness of the sunshine has but
deepened by contrast the cloud of our
sorrowful thoughtsâ sorrowful that our
nation should have turned its back
upon its old ideals and, standing at the
parting ways, should have chosen the
ancient path, familiar to the old world,
worn by the bloody feet of hapless gen
erations and which has never led to
anything but illâ the path of aggres
sive war, of foreign conquest, of alien
territorial aggrandizement, the path
that leads from trouble to trouble.
"The black and brutal visage of war
has Indeed been lighted up from time
to time during- the summer by the gal
lant deeds of our men In service, and
by the good conduct and marvelous
good fortune of our navy and. by the
general temper of humanity displayed
so soon as the actual fight was over by
both officers and men. But it has taken
on a deeper shade of gloom from the
needless sufferings which our brave
soldiers have had to endure from the
lack of due provision for their needs
alike in camp, on field and In hospital.
It has been a miserable spectacle of
lncompetency, for which account must
be rendered and penalty exacted."
After a review of the events leading
up to the war, Professor Norton said:
"Peace has nominally come. The ac
tual conflict has ended, but less than
100 days of war has resulted In a revo
lution In the United States. The foun
dations on which the republic has
rested have become unsettled. The
principles upon which the Government
depends have been violated. We havo
undertaken obligations which neither
i our Institutions nor our national char
j acter enable us properly to discharge;
we, the one great non-military power in
' the world, have suddenly joined the
I ranks of the nations burdened with
' great armies and navies: we have
' loaded ourselves with an enormous ad-
I ditional debt and with an enormous ln
i crease of annual expenditure, a perma
nent oppressive tax upon the industry
of the people, and whatever disposition
may be made of the Philippines, we arc
| already, through holding them and
I claiming the right to dispose of them,
brought into entangling relations with
the nations of the world, and run the
rif.k of losing the inestimable boon
which has hitherto been ours, of free
dom from the complications of the inter
national politics of the old world and of,
remaining the independent masters of
our own fortunes. It Is, indeed, a mo
ir.entous revolution."

He is perfectly satisfied with the way in
which things are proceeding and is will
ing to leave everything in our hands."
The matter of a clear course, Mr. Od
die said, was merely touched upon, and
no mention whatever had been made of
the Dunraven happenings in connection
with the last international contest for the
America cup. The committee, Secre
tary' Oddie said, is ready to rtceive the

TAKES HER LIFE IN
A SACRAMENTO HOTEL
Ethel Greenbank, a Young Woman of
Allegheny, Sierra County,
Shoots Herself.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 25.â Ethel Green
bank, aged about 20 years, committed sui
cide last night in the William Tell Hotel
in this city. It has been ascertained that
her home was at Allegheny, Sierra
County, where her parents reside. She
left a sealed envelope addressed, "Papa
and Mama," and an unsigned note,
reading:
"Fate is more than cruel. It did not
let me do this before. I might have died
happy."
J. Wunder, proprietor of the hotel, told
The Call correspondent that the young
woman came to his place last Tuesday
and rented a room. She gave the name
of Miss Johnson and said that she lived
in Sacramento. On Wednesday morn
ing 1 , when she came downstairs, Wunder
noticed that the girl was nervous and her
hair was disarranged. He was of the
opinion she had not retired, as he saw
a light burning In her room at a late
hour.
At 11:45 o'clock last night Wunder was
aroused by a pistol shot. He ran up
stairs, but could not locate the room the
noise came from, and afterward con
cluded that the shot was fired in some
other building. When Wunder retired
the gas was still burning in the young
woman's room.
In her room there was found a piece
of brown paper, upon which had been
written the name, "F. F. Misley,
Loomis." The Coroner telegraphed to
Loomis and learned that the young wo
man was a niece of F. F. Misley's brother
and that her name was Ethel Green
bank, and her home was in Allegheny,
Sierra County.
F. F. Misley arrived here from Loomis,
Placer County, to-night and received
from the Coroner a letter addressed to
him. It was written by the suicide beÂ»
fore her death and contained another let
ter addressed '"Alama and Papa,"
Mr. Misley said that the contents of
his letter from the dead should never be
made known, as it threw no light upon
the cause and contained a simple .'md
tender message to him and the girl's par
ents, and there was nothing in her let
ters, said Mr. Misley, that would indicate
any trouble caused by an affair of love.
"Now that the girl is dead," said Mr.
Misley, "we can recall that of late she
had been acting strangely. I believe that
she became despondent over ill health."
Miss Greenbank came to Sacramento a
few weeks ago from Stockton, where she
had been employed us a bookkeeper in
an undertaking establishment. Upon her
arrival she took up her quarters with
Mrs. Kane at 412 N street and remained
there quite a whine. Mrs. Kane found
her a tender, sensitive girl, who seemed
worried and troubled on account of âill
health.
Mr. Misley will return with her re
mains to the home of her parents in the
foothills of tire Sierras to-morrow.
URGE UNION OF SILVER MEN.
Butler, Patterson, Simpson and Bell
Speak at a Populist Picnic.
DENVER, Aug. 25.â A basket picnic was
held this afternoon and to-night at
Elitch's Gardens under the auspices of
the leaders of the Populist party of Colo
rado. At the meeting this afternoon Sen
ator Marion C. Butler of North Carolina,
national chairman of the People's party,
was principal speaker. Hon. T. M. Pat
terson, proprietor of the Rocky Mountain
News, acted as chairman of the meeting 1 .
In his opening remarks Patterson favored
united action by all silver forces until the
money question is settled.
Senator Butler devoted most of his ad
dress to urging co-operation between his
party and all other friends of sliver In
the coming campaign.
Hon. Jerry Simpson of Kansas was the
principal speaker at the night meeting.
He congratulated the People's party on
its progress and the fact that many of
Its creeds had been adopted by the Demo
crats and were even becoming popular
with members of other parties. He had
no regard for a mere party name and
cared only for the principles it stood for.
He believed it the duty of Populists to
join with all other friends of free silver
to secure the party's aims in that respect
and then go on in the fight for the other
principles of the party.
Simpson was followed by Hon. John C*
Bell, Congressman from Colorado, who
also urged union of the silver forces.

SUN JOSE PUPILS
FOR SANTA CLARA
Boss Rea Tries to Stop
the Stanfpede.
BRINGS AN INJUNCTION SUIT
SEES LOSS OF BUSINESS AND
HIS OWN UNDOING.
Organ of the Gang Devotes a Page to
the Garden City's High School
and the Merits of its
Teachers.
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 25.â A new tack has
been taken to head off the striking pu
pils, who are determined to attend the
Santa Clara High School. In the action
of the scholars of the High School the
gang sees the beginning of a trouble
that will largely tend to their defeat.
About half of the old pupils are going
to Santa Clara and several thousand
dollars annually will thus be diverted
from the business men of this city.
The gang organ, the Mercury, this
morning devotes a whole page to the
new High School and the merits of the
teachers. Interviews are published
with graduates of the school testifying
to the high merits of the institution.
On another page is an article telling of
the enjoining of the trustees of the
Santa Clara High School from using
money from a certain fund to fit up
their school.
"Boss" Rea's work is plainly discern
ible in both articles, and it is but an
attempt to drive the students back to
the local school.
The suit in question is that of Morrill
W. Henderson vs. D. Henderson, G. W.
Fowler, L. M. Kimberlin, G. H. Worrall
and C. E. Moore. In the complaint
plaintiff alleges that defendants are
using State and county school funds to
furnish the High School at Santa Clara
and asks that they be enjoined from
using such funds.
This suit was brought at the Instance
of Boss Rea and in the hope that It
may prove a barrier to the improve
ment of the school so as to accommo
date the new pupils. While the law
provides that only high school funds
shall be used for such purposes the
other funds have been used
In this county for years. No objection
was made as long as gang trustees
were using the money.
It has Just leaded out that the ap
pointment of B. D. Wigle as Instructor
of chemistry and assistant instructor
of mathematics in the high school was
at the instance of Boss Rea. Two years
ago Rea threw Hichborn, a newspaper
man, out of a Republican meeting.
Hichborn ran a weekly paper and had
been exposing the crookedness of the
gang. Hichborn was refused a warrant
for Rea's arrest for battery in this city,
and finally secured a warrant from
Justice Wigle at Palo Alto. That Jus
tice later threw the case out of court.
For this reason, it is asserted, the boss
secured the appointment of the Jus
tice's brother in the high school.
MUST SOON FACE THE
NINE-HOUR PROBLEM
The United Typothetae of America
Has a Knotty Affair to
Untangle.
MILWAUKEE, Aug. 25.â The United
Typothetae of America has a knotty
affair to untangle in the nine-hour prob
lem. With two protracted executive ses
sions to-day, the matter still remains in
be straightened out. Both President J. H.
Bowen of the International Pressmen's
and Assistants' Union and George W.
Harris, national organizer of the National
Typographical Union, gave the employing
printers to understand that it was only a
question of a short time when a general
demand would be made for a short-hour
work day. The unions are willing to sub
mit to a slight reduction in cities where
the scale is high, but where the pay is low
they ask that no change be made. As the
situation now stands, the employers will
either have to grant the nine-hour day or
stand a strike of gigantic proportions. It
is said several of the employers are In
favor of granting the demand witnout a
reduction In wages; others are willing to
comprise on nine and a half hours, while
the remainder are much opposed to it and
are ready to fight.

DEDICATION AT
OLD SAN CARLOS
Mission Convent For
mally Opened.
VERY IMPRESSIVE SERVICES
CLASS OF FORTY CHILDREN
CONFIRMED.
Bishop Montgomery Performs the
Dedicatory Ceremonies, Assisted
by Clergy From All Parts
of the Coast.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MONTEREY, Aug. 25.â A1l was sol
emn pomp about the old San Carlos
Mission Church to-day and sacerdotal
vestments, lighted tapers, religious in
signia and perfume of Incense com
bined to form a brilliant and impressive
picture, both in and outside of the
quaint old adobe building. The occa
sion was the dedication of the San Car-
Los Convent, the corner-stone of which
was laid in October last. The dedica
tion ceremonies were performed by
Right Rev. Bishop Montgomery, Bishop
of the Diocese of Monterey and Los An
geles, assisted by Rev. Fathers Hudson
of Gilroy, Marronof Watsonville, Aguil
era of San Luis Obispo, Smith and Far
ley of Hollister, O'Reilly of Santa Cruz,
Closa of San Juan, Serafin of the-Wat
sonville Orphan Asylum, Mahoney of
Castroville, McGinty and Connelly of
San Francisco, Rearly of Menlo Park,
Fathers Riordan, Raggio and Gallagher
from Santa Clara College and Father
Mestres of Monterey.
The day's ceremonies began with
high mass, celebrated at 10 a. m., at
which a class of forty children was con- I
firmed by Bishop Montgomery. At 2
p. m. dedication service was begun by
forming a procession composed of the
various sodalities of San Carlos parish,
children of the convent led by the nuns,
members of to-day's confirmation class
in white robes and white veils, acolytes
carrying religious emblems and priests
wearing gorgeous vestments and carry
ing missals, which passed from the pa
rcrchlal residence through the church
grounds and into the church, where the
opening service was sung by the San
Carlos choir, assisted by Mrs. Kerlin,
soprano, and Mr. Kinney, barytone,
from Santa Cruz.
The procession was then re-formed,
and, led by small children, proceeded to
the convent grounds, where Bishop
Montgomery performed the formal ded
ication of the house and grounds to San
Carlos, patron saint of this parish. The
Bishop, attended by priests, then en
tered the house, blessing each room in
turn and dedicating it to the service of
Christianity.
The religious procession was formed
for the third time and returned to the
church, where the Bishop delivered a
dedicatory sermon, taking "Christian
Education" as his theme. He talked in
a broad-spirited and scholarly way of
the needs for religious teaching in secu
lar schools, giving as reasons for build
ing parochial schools the fact that less
and less religious training of any sort
was being yearly given In American
schools. He emphasized the need of
such training, whether from a Catholic
or Protestant standpoint, in making
good citizens and quoted George Wash
ington, whom he said should be Amer
ica's patron saint, that security for life,
property and reputation of Americans
depends on the Inculcation of a sense
of religious obligation attaching to an
oath. For, he said, haw can a man en
tering office respect the obligations of
an onth if he does not respect Chris
tianity, on which the oath is based?
Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament
followed the sermon and closed the
day's ceremonies. The new convent Is
a handsome building of large dimen
sions and well-arranged interior and
the school is In charge of the Sisters of
St. Joseph.
CONNECTING HAWAIIAN
ISLANDS BY CABLE
Volunteer Engineers Will Aid in the
Development of the Pro
posed System.
HONOLULU, Aug. 18.â There is soon to
be telegraphic communication between the
islands of this group. A cable connecting
the Islands with one another is to be laid
almost immediately. One of the first
duties of the Engineer Corps that is here
nowâ the Third Battalion of the Second
Regiment, United States Volunteer Engi
neers â will be the construction of this fn
terisland cable system. The general
plans for it have already been adopted by
the War Department, and the material,
if not actually contracted, has been ar
ranged for.
The fact that the Government intends
to proceed at once with this work is
pretty conclusive evidence that the fran
chise for a cable from the Pacific Coast
to Honolulu will not bo delayed. Tins
fact, together with others, makes it pos
sible to count on cable communication
with the world within as reasonably short
a time as such a big work can be accom
plished.
SERIOUS GAS EXPLOSION.
Melvia Snow and an Italian Badly
Burned Near Summerland.
SANTA BARBARA, Aug, 25.â Melvin
Snow, editor of Equity of this city, and
nominee for State Printer on the Shana
han Populist ticket, while inspecting the
petroleum tunnel of the Occident Oil and
Mining Company, back of Summerland,
was badly injured to-day by the explosion
of gas. His face, hands and arms were
badly burned, but the injuries are not
neceasnrily fatal. Unless internal com
plications caused by the violent concus
sion develop, he will recover. His com
panion, an Italian miner, suffered similar
injuries. The Italian had carelessly
lighted a torch, and before Snow could
order him to extinguish it the explosion
took place.
DELICACIES FOR SOLDIERS.
Acting Secretary of War Meikeljohn

ON THE TRAIL OF
COUNTERFEITERS
Charles Irwin Chief of
the Gang.
AN OLD SAN QUENTIN BIRD
HAS SERVED FOUR TERMS IN
FIFTEEN YEARS.
San Rafael Officers and Secret Service
Agents Confident They Will
Capture All of the
Crooks.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL,," Aug. 25.â The" iden
tity of the counterfeiter who for three
months has followed his illegal pursuit
In a ravine on the north side of San
Rafael hill has now been fully estab
lished by Secret Service Agent Brown,
and It is believed that it will be only a
short time until he is in the clutches of
the law. The name of the man is
Charles Irwin, and he is an old of
fender, having been in San Quentln no
less than four times within the last fif
teen years. The last two times Irwin
was sent to the prison by the Federal
courts for "shoving the queer." His
last term was for two years, and he has
not been out of custody for much more
than a year.
Through the efforts of Constable
Louis Hughes and Deputy Constable
Trainor, who have aided the United
States Secret Service officers, the fact
has been developed that in this in
stance Irwin has not conducted his un
lawful work alone, but has probably
been at the head of a well organized
gang. So much spurious coin has been
circulated that it is believed Irwin
must have taken his product to San
Francisco and had it distributed by the
others. Doubtless much of the money
found its way back into this county
through the medium of the poolrooms
at Sausallto.
Another reason for this belief is the
discovery of the photograph found
among: Irwln's effects, which was at
first believed to be Irwin himself, but is
now thought to be that of one of his
"pals." This "pal" was frequently seen
to drive up the rough road to the ra
vine with a horse and cart, by which
means the money was probably taken
to the metropolis.
Either this companion or Irwin Urn
THE EMPORITJM.
self must have been almost within the
clutches of Constable Trainor yester
day, but the latter was ignorant of the
fact. When Trainor first visited the
mountain fastnesses of the counter
feiter a set of buggy harness hung on
an oak tree. When he returned after
taking the outfit to the Sheriff's office
this harness had disappeared. It is
evident that the malefactor toc-k warn
ing and vanished, taking the harness
with him. The harness itself was prob
ably a set stolen from the barn of a
citizen named Duffy about two weeks
ago.
The county authorities are keeping a
sharp lookout for both men en this side
of the bay, but they have probably
taken warning and will endeavor to
get out of the State. Secret service
agents, aided by the police, are now
searching for Irwin at all his known
haunts, while the outgoing trains and
steamers are closely watched by offi
cers having in their possession an ac
curate description of the old offender.
What hidden information the authori
ties have cannot of course be obtained,
but that they are confident of capturing
Irwin and running the whole gang to
earth is evident from the language of
Under Sheriff Cottingham.
"We have him spotted," he said, "and
will have him by to-morrow, sure."
SAN JOSE BALL STRIKE OFF.
Trouble Settled by Iberg Retiring
From the Team.
SAN JOSE. Aug. 25.â Harmony has been
restored in the San Jose Baseball team,
and the alleged strike of ball-players
has ciphered down to the single retire
ment of Ibere. Some money was due a
few of the players, but this bas been set
tled satisfactorily. C. R. Thomas, form
erly pitcher for the Fresno team, has been
signed in Iberg's place. He will appear
Sunday in the game with Stockton, and It
is said will strengthen the team mate
rially.
Manager Weston's friends are loud In
denouncing the ingratitude of Iberg. They
claim he Is indebted to the management
of the club 54i>. Shortly after he came to
San Jose he was married to a Miss Ryan
of San Francisco. The wedding was an
elopement. The pitcher had no ready
cash and the manager's friends say Wes
ton paid for the license, bought me wed
ding ring and advanced money to set
the couple up housekeeping. A couple of
days ago Iberg was arrested for cruelty
to animals and is now awaiting trial on
the charge.

primary election law. Both political parties have felt
the need of the purifying influence of such a statute,
and all the people who have sought to represent their
parties in State, county and district conventions, and
who have been â 'turned down," have observed that
the radical defect in our system is the absence of a
legal method of electing delegates.
A large number of faithful men in both parties are
sore this year. They are not exactly dissatisfied with
the nominees of their respective conventions, nor do
they disagree with the platforms which have been
framed lor their entertainment. The trouble with
them is that they have been refused an opportunity
to represent their constituents in a party convention.
If they had been deprived of this privilege after a fair
contest at the polls or by being outvoted in a political
club the condition of their tempers would be differ
ent. But they have been routed by a boss or counted
out at an unfair primary.
It may be. as has been stated, that even if a primary
law under which every faction would be guaranteed
fair treatment were enacted, the people would not go
to the polls and vote, and that consequently conven
tions would still be rent and torn by disputes and fisti
cuffs. But with this argument the State has nothing
to do. If a primary law were passed under which a
"fight" could be conducted with some show of fair
ness all excuse for the dissatisfaction which is now
felt among the partisans of both political parties
would be eliminated. If the people refrained from
voting at primary elections they would have only
themselves to blame for bad nominations and corrupt
government.
. . It is probable that the Legislature of 1899 will be
Republican, and if it is it- should at once set to work
on a primary law. The credit of enacting such a sys
tem ought not to be a matter of competition among
Republicans. The entire party should unite in a de
mand for a statute under which all factions, as well
a? the people, may have a fair chance to represent
their political party in conventions. Until such a law
is passed and enforced a fruitful source of partisan
disorganization and trouble will continue to exist.
SEMI-OFFICIAL AUTHORITY.
1 \ EPEATEDLY it has been stated of late that
lâS President McKinley is desirous of learning the
sentiment of the people concerning the policy
the Government should pursue with regard to the
Philippines, and that in his eagerness to obtain this
information he gladly welcomes advice from all
sources, communications from all sorts of public
bodies, letters from private citizens and reports of de
bating societies.
Whenever this statement is repeated care is taken
to add that it is given out on "semi-official authority."
Such carefulness is commendable. Statements of the
kind clearly need some authority to rest upon, for
otherwise they would be met with incredulity. That
the President is desirous of knowing the drift of pop
ular sentiment on all political questions is a matter of
course, but that he is in any way eager to hear from
the multitudinous writers of the country on the sub
ject is doubtful. Unless, therefore, some authority
for the story were given no one would believe it and
the President would get no letters.
Under the circumstances it is to be regretted that
the authority itself is unreliable. Since the war with
Spain broke out a great deal of information has been
given to the public upon semi-official authority, and
without exception the information has proved to be
delusive. "Semi-official," in fact, seems to be some
obscure personage whom it would be permissible to
describe as an "anonymous cuss." His versatility is
enormous, but as for accuracy he is not in it even
with the Weather Bureau.
Why he shouid seek at this time to turn upon the
President the full force of the letter-writing, advice
giving power of all able-bodied citizens in this coun
try, it is not easy to understand. Possibly the Presi
dent has refused to give him an office and thus raise
him to the rank of a total official, and he is playing to
get evert, and possibly he is the editor of some Wash
ington newspaper who wishes to turn the tide of
communications from "Veritas," Taxpayer" and the
rest from his own mail to that of the White House.
In any case "semi-official" has not done the square
thing in this instance either by the country or the
President. He has started a report, out of which
there is likely to come a great nuisance, and if he can
be discovered he should be sentenced to imprison
ment and the task of reading every letter of advice
on the Philippine question that is sent to McKinley
for the rest of his term of office.

THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE.
NO Republican convention for years has seemed
to more nearly indorse the popular choice than
in the selection of Henry T. Gage as the party's
candidate for Governor. The Call, with its ample
resources for getting knowledge of the sentiment
abroad among the people, was clearly conscious and
well informed of the steady drift of sentiment toward
the candidacy of Mr. Gage, and so announced before
the convention met. Every argument that could be
made on sectional and personal grounds was enlarged
and frankly put long in advance, that it might go to
the judgment of the people. By them each reason
was weighed and balanced against its counter reason,
and when so weighed was dismissed as insufficient.
This process having adjusted the party choice to the
popular preference, the nomination of Mr. Gage came
naturally and without trade or combination. The gen
tlemen of the field in competition with him for the
honor and the hard duty of the candidacy were quick
to recognize all this, and their prompt appreciation
g.- ve to their withdrawal the grace of ready assent arud
hearty loyalty. Each one earned thoroughly the good
will and timely rewards of the party.
There is no room for doubt that the impression
upon the party and its convention made by Mr. Gage's
personality and qualities will be transferred to the
people of the State by his presence in the canvass,
and will there, as in the convention, command the
favor and support of a majority. In the prime of life,
for he will not be 46 until after his election, with a
thoroughly trained mind, the architect of his own
fortunes and so familiar by experience with life's
early vicissitudes as to feel the pinch in the lives of
his fellow-men, he is the home and fireside candidate
of the people.
Believing thoroughly in the principles of his party,
he knows the citizen's right to an administration of
public affairs in the interest of all the people, leaving
party advantages to follow the strictest recognition
of every man's rights under the laws of the common
wealth, without regard to his party preference.
As a candidate he is a Republican. He will be the
Governor of the whole people, their trustee and the
instrument of their will, as expressed in the constitu
tion and statutes they have made for the protection
of their rights of person and property. He represents
no wild assault on institutions, no airy plans for de
priving the minority of the inalienable rights secured
to them by our system of government, no scheme to
destroy representative government and throw the
whole body and spirit of the laws protective of per
son and property into the scale in each election cam
paign, to be changed with the shifting of majorities.
He stands for that stability of government which is
the best safeguard of the interests of all men. Of his
election there is no doubt, and that it will be recog
nized as a delivery of the State from policies that
would instantly injure all of the great interests of the
people goes without saying.
THE LEPER PROBLEM.
rOR some time past California has not been
seriously disturbed by the problem of provid
ing a place for the care of lepers, and the issue
has to some extent passed out of the public mind.
This is due solely to the fact that there has not been
of recent occurrence any case of a leper whose con
dition was sufficiently extraordinary to excite com
ment. We have had such cases in the past, however,
and they are likely to occur again, so it would be well
to take time by the forelock and make provision now
for the proper handling of them when they arise.
It will be remembered that a few years ago the sui
cide of a leper who had been kept isolated in a cabin
back of Oakland gave rise to a movement toward
making better provision for the care of these unfor
tunates. At that time an attempt was made to pro
vide for the admission of lepers from this country to
â¢the Molokai settlement, but the effort was rendered
futile by the opposition of the Hawaiian Government.
The islands have now been annexed to this country
and are under the supervision of Congress. It would
seem, therefore, that the project might now be re
newed with good prospects of success.
Past experience renders it certam that by reason of
the existence of so many Chinese and Japanese
among us there will be always more or less leprosy
in the United States, and that unless all who are in
lected be carefully secluded the dread disease may be
come very widespread indeed. The seclusion and
proper care of the lepers involves the maintenance of
a leper settlement, and the only question at issue is
whether we shall use the settlement at Molokai for all
lepers that may be found among us or establish a
new one.
At the present time a leper finds hardly anywhere
in the United States a suitable place of seclusion. If
sent to Molokai he would find himself in a com
munity where he would have companionship, and be
saved from the dread loneliness of utter isolation. His
condition therefore would be in every way better, and
moreover the seclusion would be more complete than
can possibly be attained anywhere else.
The site of the Hawaiian leper colony is an ideal
place for such a settlement. The climate is mild, the
country beautiful and the isolation virtually perfect
in every respect. The lepers confined there are not
imprisoned. They have a considerable area, over
which they may wander at will, and where they can
and do cultivate gardens and carry on several kinds
of industry. With such a settlement now under con
trol of Congress it would appear to be a simple mat
ter of common sense to make it a place of residence
for all lepers in the United States, or at least for all
on this side of the continent. It would be well to
have such provision made at once, so that when the
next case of leprosy confronts us we* will know ex
actly what to do about it.
In more than one respect the profession of pugilism
fails to elevate. In recent events "pulled off" in this
city three of the participants bore the names Dud,
Kid and Bud respectively. This is enough to stop
prize-fights. It is worse than an occasional death in
the ring.
One sad feature of the death of three people at the
East from eating poisoned ice cream is the chance
it affords a lot of fool paragraphers to revivify an
elderly joke, not particularly good when it was young.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, FRIDAY, AUGUST 26, 1898.
DISCOURTESY TO PATRONS.
IN the matter of miserably inadequate accommoda
tions the Southern Pacific always endeavors to ex
cel and generally succeeds. The latest illustration,
so far as known, was given yesterday, when a special
train was run from Sacramento to this city, presum
ably for the convenience of delegates and visitors re
turning from the convention. The overland, being
belated, as is not unusual, the special train took the
regular's time, leaving the capital at 5:10 o'clock. It
was made up of two Pullmans and six very common
coaches, all of them crowded. Of course the passen
gers had had no dinner, and expected to secure it on a
dining car. There was no such car. There was a
buffet furnished with a colored attendant, a price list
and not a morsel of food. Hope arose that on the
boat at Benicia at least a lunch could be obtained. It
was a vain hope. The wretched little lunch-counter
on the boat could not supply so much as a sandwich
apiece for one in ten of the hungry men who rushed
in. There seemed no desire on the part of the people
in charge to wait on anybody. Many had to turn
away without a bite or sup. They took consolation
in the fact that the city was not far distant, but the
endeavor to prolong their discomfort did not abate.
When "Fatty" Fillmore's minions undertake to do
the disagreeable, they are doubtless acting under or
ders, and not personally culpable, else to have tossed
them into the straits would have been simple justice.
The special was held on the boat until the regular,
equipped with a dining car and drawing the Southern
Pacific directors' car, had come up. Then the tired
and famished passengers expected to start on, but
again were they befooled by the corporation. The
special was still held, while the regular, of which it
had had a lead of half an hour at Sacramento, was
sent on. Finally it was permitted to trail the direc
tors' car, with its well-fed officials and its passengers,
who had had access for hours to a well-stocked diner.
There was much protest thong the neglected,
weary and abused people on the special, and had Fill
more heard the comments freely made the thought of
paying attention to patrons might have occurred to
him. They reached the mole in angry mood, justly in
dignant at treatment which in its inexcusable bru
tality and selfishness was little less than barbarous.
The total nin of the famine train from Sacramento
occupied almost five hours, a startling speed of about
eighteen miles an hour.
If Fillmore does rot know better than to do busi
ness in this way he needs instructions as to how to
attend to it. These brief instructions are advanced
only in the feeble faith that they may teach him as a
start toward reform to mend his manners.
POSTAL SAVINGS BANKS.
SINCE the recent annual meeting of the New
York Bankers' Association was made notable
by an address strongly opposing the'establish
ment of postal savings banks in this country, it is
gratifying that at the assembly of the American
Bankers' Association at Denver a champion of such
banks had the opportunity of delivering the opening
speech, and in doing so made an earnest plea for the
proposed innovation.
The question of establishing postal savings banks
has long been before the people of the United States,
and has been discussed extensively both by the press
and in Congress. With the incoming of the present
administration the issue was made one of practical
politics. The Postmaster General recommended the
adoption of the system, and a bill providing for its
establishment was favorably reported from the Senate
Committee on Postoffices. The outbreak of the war
caused a postponement of the subject, so that nothing
was done at the last session, but it is certain the meas
ure will be taken up this winter and if possible car
ried to success.
While the bill now before the Senate is in some
respects an administration measure, it is not going
to be a party question. A considerable number of Re
publican as well as Democratic papers in the East
have already pronounced against it, and Eastern Con
gressmen of both parties will probably be largely ad
verse to it. On the other hand the friends of the plan
are many, and there is reason to hope they will be able
to make a winning fight.
The New York Mail and Express opposes postal
savings banks on the queer ground that following the
war there will be a large expansion of commerce and
industry, resulting of course in an enlarged demand
for money, and, it says, "Under such conditions there
will be no necessity for providing Government means
of caring for the savings of the people. There will
be plenty of employment for money in safe enter
prises and at better rates of interest than prevail to
day."
This argument means that when the banks pay
higher rates of interest than they now pay there will
be no need of postal banks. It has therefore no rele
vance whatever to the real problem which the postal
banks are expected to solve. It was never the idea
of any one that postal banks would pay higher rates
of interest than existing banks have been paying. It
is expected of the postal banks that they will place
banking conveniences within the reach of all classes
of people; that they will gather up the savings of the
whole country and make them available for trade and
commerce.
The very conditions which, according to the Mail
and Express, render postal banks unnecessary are
those which augment the demand for the system. The
larger the earnings of the people the more important
it is that they should have a safe place in which to de
posit their savings. The greater the demand for
money in trade and commerce the greater the need
of bringing back to the channels of trade all that is
paid out for wages.
In the cities where banking facilities are abundant
postal savings banks are perhaps not necessary, but
in the rural districts they are among the imperative
needs of the time, and it is gratifying that the issue
has been promptly brought to the front at the Denver
meeting.
Spain is reported to be overwhelmed with disgust
at the surrender of Santiago. The present is a little
late for criticism of Toral, on the ground that, having
had opportunity to act like a fool, he acted like a
man of sense. He can't be pure-bred Spanish.
There seems to be an idea that because Becker and

ST. PATRICK'S SEMINARY AT MENLO PARK DEDICATED.
Services Conducted Under the Direction of Archbishop Riordanâ Opening of the Institution.
St. Patrick's Seminary, the new Catholic theological college at Menlo Park, was dedicated Wednesday morn-
Ing with solemn and impressive ceremony. $
With its dedication has come the crowning of the one cherished hope and the life object of Archbishop Rior
dan, its founder, who hns labored for years in planning and realizing its institution as a means of educating
young men of the State who are desirous of embracing the ministry of the Catholic church. Robed in the sacred
vestments of the altar, assisted by clergymen from all parts of the State and members of the Franciscan. Salesian,
Marist. Jesuit and Sulpician orders, the Archbishop conducted the ceremony of dedication in
person, piving to the Catholic church, as the sacred words were pronounced, one of the largest and
one of the most perfect theological seminaries in the country.
Immediately after the banquet which was tendered at the close of the religious exercises the Archbishop gave
a hrW'f and eloquent address on the object of the institution, its aim and his hopes as a founder for its future.
Ho was followed in the address by Bishop Montgomery of Los Angeles and Bishop Grace of Sacramento, who pro
nounced a Joint eulogium on his efforts in realizing the consummation of his cherished plan in giving to the State
and to the church the institution which now claims him as its founder and guardiun.
Rev. A. J. B. Vuibert. S. S. . together with a number of other members of the Sulpician Order, were installed
by the approbation of the Archbishop, immediately after the banquet., as the faculty of the new seminary. To them
is* Invested the trust and the confidence to properly guide and educate the young men who are sent, and will be
sent, under their care for thorough preparation as ministers of the gospel and of God.
â With the choosing of Father Vuibert, the Archbishop has chosen a member of an order famed for its educa
tors and renowned for its history as an educational community in the Catholic church.
The order, which takes its name from Its founder, St. Sulpice, was first organized in the sixteenth century, and
has since flourished as one of the greatest educational bodies in the teaching of theology in the church. For 200
years it has been in existence In Montreal, and for over a century has prepared, educated and watched over the
destiny of students that have matriculated during this time In the college at Baltimore, the greatest theological
seminary in the United States and, perhaps, greatest in the world.
The time scheduled for the formal opening of the seminary is September 20 next, and already there are nearly
forty applications for entrance from young men from various parts of the State.
Those entering the college will have to undergo a thorough preparatory course which will extend over a period
of five years. Upon graduating from this school of fundamental preparation they are then eligible for enroll
ment in the theological seminary proper, where they will undergo a course of study of seven years' duration.
The architecture of the new edifice conforms rigidly to the Romanesque style with all its beauties and impres
slveness. The main entrance, situated in the west wing, the administration building and the annex, are already
completed and it is anticipated that the other unfinished portions of the building, as yet, will be completed within
the near future and before the time indicated for the formal opening of the seminary. All through the entire
building the floors are of polished inlaid woods with a similar effect in wainscoting and ceiling decoration.
On the main floor are the living rooms of the professors, reception rooms for guests and various other apart
ments. The other floors of the edifice are divided off and devoted to the various purposes for which they
have been designed in suiting the comfort and convenience of the students, the faculty and visitors.
Among those who attended the ceremony of dedication were the following: Archbishop Riordan, Bishop Mont
gomery of Monterey and Los Angeles, Bishop Grace of Sacramento, Rev. Peter Yorke, chancellor; Rev. P. E. Mulli
gan, secretary of the Archbishop; Very Rev. J. J. Prendergast, vicar general: Rev. Edward Dempsey, assistant

In memory for months to come by one
of the largest houses which the Morrison
engagement has seen. The performance,
as has been all the week, was "The Mer

of the evening was the presentation dur
ing the third act of a mammoth vase of
flowers from the Alcazar management to
Mi-s Florence Roberts, and to Louis Mor
rison an elegant laurel wreath of solid
silver and gold in a beautiful plush case. ;
The wreath measured ten inches in cir- ;

Special Dispatch to The Call.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Aug. 25.â The
election of the officers of the Supreme
Lodge. Knights of Pythias, did not
take place this morning. It Is usual
to elect officers on the third day of the
biennial session, but it was occupied
by investigations that are going on.
There were stormy times in the lodge
rooms this morning. Appointments
which usually went through with a
whirl at former meetings were either
referred or voted down, and there was
a strong determination on the part of
those opposed to the present supreme
officers to track close to Pythian laws
in everything. This morning a resolu
tion was introduced that will cut the
expenses of the meeting of the Su
preme Lodge in two, and will make
this session the cheapest ever held with
so many representatives.
A resolution was passed requiring
reports from the officers as to sup
plies furnished and declaring that in
the future such purchases must be
made by competitive bids.
The sensation this afternoon was the
report of the estimate of the finance
committee. The committee went at
thr- salaries with an ax and choDDed
everything in sight. It recommended
that the per diem of the supreme repre
sentatives be reduced from $5 per day
and 5 cents a mile each way to $3 a
day and 3 cents a mile actually trav
eled. The report as presented is as
follows:
Salary of supreme chancellor, two
years, $6000: salary of clerical force. two
years. $1800; office rent, at actual cost
and not to exceed, for two yearÃ. $800.
Postage, telephone, telegrams, sta
tionery, express, removal of furniture
from Hastings, Mich., all at actual cost
not to exceed, for two years, $1000.
Salary of supreme keeper of records,
two years, $7200; clerical assistance of
all kinds, two years. $2000; office rent,
heating, lighting, Janitor, telephone,
postage, packing boxes, wrapping paper
and other incidentals, at actual cost,
not to exceed $2000; traveling expense
St X R and S., at actual rate cost and
not to exceed, two years. $300.
Salary of S. M. of Ex.. two years,
$1500; traveling expenses, at actual cost
and not to exceed $400.
Expense of the Supreme Tribunal,
two years, $3000; official records, at
actual coot and not to exceed $3000: al
lowance to daughters of founders.
$1400; traveling expenses of the finance
re- -iinittee, $1200; interest on mortgagps,
$1350; Supreme Chancellor's jewel, $150.
Total. $33,500.
This report has precipitated a fight
that has almost become personal be
tween some of the members.
The parade of the Knights of Khor
assan took place to-night and was wit
nessed by thousands upon thousands
of people. It was the greatest gather
ing of people attracted down town any
evening during the encampment. About
2000 Knights of Khorassan marched,
garbed in Arabic costumes.
The Supreme Temple of Rathbone
Sisters discussed the question of an in
surance feature and votes sufficient to
adopt the resolution on creating it have
been received.

Anglo-Egyptian Expedi
tion Ready to Strike.
WILL MARCH ON OMDURMAN
THEN COMES THE BATTLE WITH
THE KHALIFA.
So Far General Sir Herbert Kitchener
Has Operated Brilliantly and
Success Is Now
Predicted.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WADY HAMED, Aug. 24.â The whole
Anglo-Egyptian expedition has arrived
here and the advance is now commen
cing to- El Hajid, where final concen
tration will be made for the march on
Omdurman, forty miles distant, which
will occupy two days, if the Khalifa
decides to await attack at Omdurman,
as now appears likely.
Refugees are arriving daily from Om
durman. They all agree that the Kha
lifa means to fight. They report that
he has 70,000 men. The attack is ex
pected to occur about September 4. Our
camp of 20,000 men, extending thrÂ« c
miles, with the white gunboats and an
innumerable fleet of native boats, pre
sents a picturesque sight to--night.
General Sir Herbert Kitchener's
achievement so far is a brilliant opera
tion. Some weeks ago he announced his
intention to concentrate his forces at
Wady Hamed on August 22. He ar
rived there to-day.
"Wady Hamed is a village forty miles
above Metammeh, and between fifty
and sixty miles from Omdurman. It is
at the foot of the long sixth cataract,
the head of which is at Shabaluka.
Considering the difficulties of moving
24,000 men and impediments over the
desert and along the Nile uftder a blaz
ing sun, the achievement is proof of the
splendid organization of the expedition
and augurs well for the final overthrow
of the Khalifa's power.
Major General Archibald Hunter
commands the Egyptian forces, which
comprise two-thirds of the expedition,
and which critics agree now form capi
tal fighting material. Major General
William Forbes Dacre commands the
British forces.
POISONS AND
CANDY-MAKING
Confectioners and Chemists Disa
gree on the Vital Points.
The vital point of interest, around which
the famous Dunning murder case re
volves, is the box of poisoned candy,
packed by careful fingers, and sent across
the continent, to carry death into the
homes of its unsuspecting victims.
A plan, diabolical in nature, careless in
detail, but fatally sure of success, on ac
count of the well-known love for candy of
the world feminine, was doubtless, carried
out by some fiend in woman's form. As
far as the public knows, this candy was
made in San Francisco. Fart of it was,
no doubt, manufactured by Home regular
confectioner, the rest by the .hand of an
hysterical, jealous woman, thinking only
of revenge upon the innocent cause of her
own unhuppiness.
The possibility of taking from the box
half of the confectioner's bon bons, sub
stituting home-made candies, and con
cealing therein, a poison not only deadly,
but tasteless, is interesting not alone to
the public, but candy manufacturers and
chemists as well.
Withing the past month, the four walls
of some room witnessed the manufacture
of dainty chocolates, tempting in appear
ance, yet tilled with death. But there was
presumably, no one to note the odor of
the boiling candy, and no one to tell
whether it was made In the early hours
of the morning, or at a time when the in
mates were all away and the murderess
alone.
"I should not think it possible," said
Mr. Gruenhagen, the confectioner, "for
a person to boil candy without the rest of
the people in the house knowing it. The
odor is very penetrating, especially that
of tames or caramels. It is not necessary
to use coloring matter to darken caramels,
and we use nothing but the sugar and
pure chocolate.
"Well, I've never tried It, but presume
poison could be introduced without it be
ing detected. Say something in the liquid
line. I don't know what effect arsenic
would have upon the candy or whether it
would mix with the sugar, but unless the
poison was very bitter the tuste of the
chocolate might cover it Up."
F. C. Warren, for ten years a manufac
turer of candies, is of the opinion that tne
ordinary inmate of a lodging-house "who
does light housekeeping could by opening
a window to let tne steam Escape or by
cooklng other things at the same time,
boil candy without the odor being de
tected."
"Why, of course," said he, "poison
could be put in without changing the ap
pearance of the candy, and 1 doubt if It
could be tasted, for the bitter of the
chocolate would obviate that. You can't
tell from the looks of candy what's in It.
It all depends upon the honesty of the
person who makes it. Any malicious per
son could put a lot of poison in this hot
candy and I would not know it by the ap
pearancfl of it."
George Haas, the well-known confec
tioner, said:
"Why, yes, I think candy could be made
In a room without any noticeable odor
fienetrating beyond the closed door. That
s. unless it waa molasses candy. When
we make taffy the whole town knows it,
but, then. New Orleans molasses always
does make itself known. So far as boiling
caramels or chocolate creams Is con
cerned, I do not think the odor would at
tract any one outside the room where
they were being made."
"Half a dozen different poisons could
be used," said Will Mack, the Market
street druggist, "but I am of the opinion
that it was strychnine; or It is possible
liquid morphine may have been poured
into the boiling candy. It could not have
been cyanide of potassium, for that would
have left not only an unpleasant taste
but an odor like bitter almonds, and would
have proved fatal more quickly. Pure
chocolate has a peculiarly bitter, acrid
taste, and that would cover the taste of
most poisons. At any rate, one swallows
candy so quickly that the poison would
have to be very pronounced to cause any
unpleasant Impression upon the palate.
It's a case of plugged watermelon,"
remarked Frank Clough. the well-known
chemist. "You se<\ sho took a very sharp
knife, cut out a little plug of the candy,
put in the arsenic, heated the candy a
trifle, smoothed it over, and there you are.
Arsenic? Of course it was arsenic, for it
would be the least liable to be detected,
and too, the length of time before it
proved fatal sounds like arsenical poison
ing. No, strychnine was not used. That
would have caused convulsions and froth
ing at the moutn. with almost Immediate
dissolution."

TRAGIC SUICIDE OF
A WIFE MURDERER
Ernest Joseph Passel
Kills Himself.
DIES IN A PARIS CAFE
HAD POSED AS THE MARQUIS
DE GONDEVILLE.
Jb ailed to Collect Heavy Insurance
Upon the Life of His Wife,
Whom He Threw
Over a Cliff.
. Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Aug. 25.â Ernest Joseph Possel,
the German who had been trying to col
lect a claim of Â£ll),000 upon a life insur
ance policy issued to his late wife, an
Englishwoman, by the Urbane Insurance
Company, which had resisted payment on
the ground that he had thrown her off a
cliff near Florence, Italy, committed sui
cide last night at the.Durand restaurant,
in the Place de la Madeleine.
Possell, who called himself the Marques
de Gondeville, and pretended to be a
French subject, was under heavy bail,
and the authorities had ordered the ex
humation of the body of his wife.
The maiden name of Mrs. Possel was
Eleanor a'Beckett. and she was about 21
years old. The couple had been staying
at Florence, and one day Possel returned
home alone from a drive, saying that his
wife had fallen off a cliff on the edge of
which she was resting while ho was
mending his harness. They were married
in England last March, and Possel in
sured her life almost immediately. It de
veloped after her body was found be
neath the cliff that Possel had been seen
there, several days before, throwing down
large stones and watching their descent.
Possel took a private room in the res
taurant and asked for writing materials
and breakfast. Shortly after shots were
heard. The attendants rushing in. found
him lying on the floor and dvlng. He had
shot himself in the head. Feeblj" waving
his hand toward two, letters that were
lying on the table, he asked to have them
delivered. They wore addressed to his
mother and to the Chief of Police of the
district. The letter to the police func
tionary revealed his Identity. In it Pos
sell declared that he had killed himself
because of the accusations against him
since the death of his wife.
Possel came to Paris after his release in
Italy to obtain the insurance money on
his wife's policy, but the Insurance com
pany refused to pay him until the cause
of his wife's death should have been es
tablished.

years of age, of medium height with scant
pray hair and grayish mustache, dressed
in a well-worn sack suit, and was ap
parently a laboring man. He had shot
himself through the temple and the re
volver was still tightly clutched in his
right hand. There was nothing- about his

COMMISSIONERS TO
NEGOTIATE THE
TREATY OF PEACE
MeQ Chosen by the PresideQt to
Meet Spaniards in a Diplo
matic Struggle.
Representatives of This Country Not in Favor of
Uncle San) Controlling All the
Philippines.
Secretary William R. Day of Ohio.
Senator Cushman K. Davis oF Minnesota.
Senator William P. Frye oF Maine.
Justice Edward Douglas White oF Louisiana.
Whitelaw Reid oF New York.
NEW YORK, Aug. 25.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: These are the commissioners
definitely decided upon by the Presi
.. dent to negotiate the treaty of peace
between the United States and Spain.
The decision to appoint Justice White
... was reached yesterday, and his accept
ance was received by wire this after
noon. The formal tender of a commls
sionership to Mr. Reid was made this
morning.
The American Peace Commission ap
parently Is not going to Paris to de
mand the entire group of the Philip
â¢ pines, but to contend only for the occu
pation of Luzon Island. This was
strongly developed at a conference at I
the White House to-day between the |
.President, Secretary Day and Senators
Davis and Frye, a majority of the
. members of the commission. During the '
conference to-day the whole Spanish I
' question was fully discussed, and the :
policy of the administration was dis- !
tinctly outlined.
While the fact is recognized that a
DEWEY'S SQUADRON
TO BE REINFORCED
Crack Warships Destined
for Manila.
OREGON WILL BE IN THE LEAD
OTHER VESSELS THAT ARE TO
â  BE SENT TO FAR EAST.
In- the Event of Complications the
Vnitea States Is Not to Be
Handicapped in Its Fight
ing Force.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 25.â A Herald spe-
c ial from Washington says: Admiral
Deweys squadron at Manila is to be
reinforced. At least three or four of
the crack vessels of the .North Atlantic
squadron will be sent to Manila in the
near future. They will go by way of
the Suez canal and will reach Asiatic
-,\ aters in the early fall. The detail for
this new eastern squadron has not yet
been completed, but It is known that
â¢ the battle-ship Oregon, the fast cruis
ers New York and Brooklyn and prob
ably the battle-ship Indiana are to be
overhauled and put in shape for the
. trip.
It is semi-officially admitted to-day
that the Oregon is sure to go, and that
it is very probable the other three ves
sels mentioned will accompany it. The
: sible reason for sending four big
fighting vessels to the far east is that
Admiral Dewey'a ships, having been in
commission so long cannot be properly
: docked and cleaned for months. As
Manila is to bo a theater in which in
ternational questions of grave import
; are to be settled within the coming six
. months the administration believes the
presence there eof a fleet of American
fighting craft is an absolute necessity.
The State Department will not admit
-the situation in Manila is anything but
tranquil now, yet it does not attempt
to. conceal the fact that should trouble
arise with Germany or any other na
tion over the disposition of the Philip
pines Admiral Dewey would be handi
capped and the nation put at a decided
disadvantage should his fleet be not
materially strengthened. From an au
thoritative source it is asserted at
least four more of the vessels of the
fighting line will be churning the path
way across the seas to Manila within
the next six weeks, !Lnd that the power
ful Oregon will be leading the proces
sion. ______ââ
SPREAD OF THE REVOLT
IN SOUTHERN CHINA
American Missionaries and Native
Converts on Hainan Island Jflee
From the Rebels.
HONGKONG, Aug. 25.â A serious Insur
â  roction has broken out at Nadoa, in the
interior of Hainan Island. American
missionaries and native converts have
Bought safety In flight. On August 14
the rebels fought the soldiers, who used
the American Presbyterian property as
defenses and repelled tho attack. Nadoa
la situated ninety miles from Hnisow, one
of the richest valleys on the island.
T'nless the revolt is speedily suppressed
the insurgents probably will be reinforced
by refugees from Kwungsi; where the of
ficial* are coping with the recent rebel
lion. Should it not be suppressed there
is an opportunity for French interfer
ence. The French are using vigorous
measures to protect the native Christians
near Kruang-Chow-Wan and are anxious
to extend their Influence in Southern
China.
CHOKTAWAGA THE PLACE.
Battle-Ground Selected for the Cor
bett-McCoy Match.
BUFFALO, Aug. 26.â 1t has been defi
nitely decided that the Corbett-McCoy
battle wi'l take place at Choktawaga on
October 1. McCoy left Huftalo for Sara
toga this morning, where he will resume
training at once. Tho Olympic Athletic
Club has decided to transfer the Erne
and Lavlgne light to the Hawthorne Ciub,
and it will come off at Choktawaga Sep
tember i.
large majority of the American people
are Inclined to favor the taking of the
Philippines by the United States, the
participants in the conference to-day
advanced what they considered sub
stantial reasons why this should not be
done. In order to obtain absolute con
trol over the entire group of islands the
United States would be required to pro
vide a standing army of from 30,000 to
50,000 men. The members of the com
mission do not believe that this would
be advisable. It is believed the commis
sioners will make a straightforward de
mand for Luzon In accordance with the
suggestions supposed to have been re
ceived from Admiral Dewey.
It is said the Spaniards are endeav
oring to make it appear that the great
and alUabsorblng question is the dis
position of the Philippines, encouraging
that impression in the hope the United
States may be induced in consideration
of certain concessions in the Philip
pines, to assume the responsibility for
the Cuban debt. The judgment of the
commission thus far Is against assum
ing one dollar of the Cuban debt. It is
believed now that the Cuban debt ques
tion will be as troublesome to the com
missioners as that of the Philippines^

Santiago Merchants Say
Business Is Menaced.

Commercial Operations of the Prov
ince Paralyzed Because No
Produce Is Coming In
From the Country.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. UM, by James Gor
don Bennett.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Aug. 25.â 1
talked to-day with many merchants of
this city and every one of them was
anxious that the Cuban army should
be disbanded at once. It Is a standing
menace to business, they say. They all
are anxious to resume, but found it
impossible to do so because property is
threatened by the ill-disciplined levies
of Garcia's command.
Cultivators refuse to return to plan
tations, where they will be subject to
contributions for the support of the
Cuban soldiers, who are still in the
field. No produce therefore will come
to market here and ships that bring
cargoes cannot take anything back. If
the province Is to return to a self-sup
porting basis and trade begin again the
Cuban army. It Is generally admitted,
must be disbanded.
Robert Mason, British Consul here,
who is locai manager for Brooks & Co.,
told me that his business is absolutely
at a standstill.
"No produce is coming from the
country,'' he said, "because the condi
tion of things there Is unsettled and
merchants are afraid to engage in op
erations until the political situation is
better defined. Owing to the lack of
labor, lighters and wharfage facilities
we are completely blocked and our
business Interests are suffering. We
cannot order cargoes. There is no
money In the province. If trade is to
be resumed some definite step must be
taken immediately by the United
States."
I have Just returned from a visit to
San Luis, where I made inquiries aa
to the truth of reports of outrages com
mitted by men of the Eighth Illinois
that had come to us here. The Eighth
is stationed in San Lifis. These reports
were brought in by Cubans. I found
they had been much exaggerated.
CAPTAIN CLARK TAKEN
TO THE NAVAL HOSPITAL
He Is Suffering From an Attack of
Dysentery â Treated to an Im
promptu Ovation.
PHILADELPHIA. Aug. 25.â Captain
Clark of the battleship Oregon was car
ried through this city to-day on his way
to New York, where he will be placed In
the naval hospital to be treated for dys
entery.
Twice when the captain was recogniz
ed on the litter upon which he was borne
he was heartily cheered by the crowds
which quickly collected. In the Broad
street station of the Pennsylvania Rail
road an Impromptu ovation was tendered
the hero of the 15.000 milÂ« voyage
"around the Horn," to which he, un
fortunately, was too weak to respond.
Shortly after the St. Louis was docked
at Cramp's to-day Captain Clark was car
ried on a stretcher from the vessel Into
a carriage. He was rapidly driven
through the city to the Broad street sta
tion. Again he wns placed on a litter
and carried aboard a sleeper attached
to a train for New York.

AGUINALDO READY
TO CO-OPERATE WITH

Complains of a Lack of Honesty and Ability
Among Rebel Leaders and Is
Anxious to Disband.
BY SOL N. SHERIDAN.
MANILA, Aug. 25. â I have just had an interview with
General Aguinaldo in Bacoor. The insurgent leader de
clares he is anxious to support the authority of the United
States in these islands and that he has persuaded other
rebel leaders to accept his views. It is his desire that the
insurgent army be disbanded and return to the provinces.
He complains of lack of honesty and military talent in the
rebel leaders and says he has not an army but only an un
ruly rabble. The general seemed dispirited. He adds that
he trusts the United States will form a free and liberal gov
ernment, and says the Americans can count on his co-op
eration.
The rebellion is spreading in the south. Sorsogon has
fallen into the hands of the rebels, five Spaniards being
killed in the assault.
WRESTLING AND BOXING

TIMOTHY HEALY TALKS
ABOUT HOME RULE
One Stand the United States Might
Take That Would Cause Bless
ings in Ireland.
DUBLIN. Aug. 25.â Timothy Healy,
member of Parliament for North Louth,
addressing a meeting at Dublin this
evening, said he regarded the new local
government act as the vestibule of home
rule. There were two ways, he said, of
winning the latterâ either by turning the
fleets and armies against the British
Government, or by enlisting the sympa
thies of British statesmen. He favored
the latter policy, and therefore consid
ered the refusal of the Dublin corpora
tion to join in a national memorial to
Mr. Gladstone as one of the gravest
blunders ever committed by any public
body.
In conclusion, ho said: "If America
should insist that Ireland were equally
entitled to self-government with Cuba
and should refuse any friendship or alli
ance with England until that was
granted. Incalculable blessings would re
sult."

IDENTIFYING RAILWAY CAR
RIAGES.
Who that has traveled by railway has
not experienced a difficulty In finding ns
seat again once he has got out at an In
termediate station? You get out to get a
glass of beer or a hurried snack at the
refreshment buffet, and when you get
back to the platform you wander along
the train, looking into every compartment
to identify the luggage you have left !n
order to keep your seat. The Western of
France Railway has come to the rescue
of its passengers in this respect. On Us
express train in the morning from Paris
to St. Malo and Parame it has put car
riages with pictures upon them. One has
an elephant, another a lyre, another a
snake, etc. There are anchors, hunts
man's horns, balloons, tricolored flags,
bunches of grapes, swallow?, a pair of
scales, a star, an angler with his fishing
rod. It is thought that one of these de
signs will be more readily remembered
than a number, and. according to ail ac
counts, passengers are very pleased with
the innovation. Before long the Western
of France directors hope to have picture
trains on all their lines.â London News.

GERMANY WOULD
PARTITION THE
SAMOAN ISLANDS
Inspires a Feeler for the Purpose
of Sounding* America and

This Country Will Not Listen to the Proposal.
Correspondence That May Lead to
Serious Friction-
NEW YORK. Aug. 25.â The Herald's Washington correspondent
sends the following: Trouble is brewing over the Samoan Islands,
which under the treaty of 1890 are governed under a joint protect
orate by the United States, Great Britain and Germany. The recent
proposition advanced by the Marine Politlsche Correspondenz that the
islands should be divided, England t.-".ing Suval, Germany Upolu and
America Tutuila, it is believed here, was inspired by the German
Government as a feeler for the purpose of finding out how the .United
States and Great Britain would receive the proposition. This propo
sition would give Germany the best of the islands and Great Britain
the worst.
As far as the United States is concerned the proposition to par
tition the group will not be considered for an instant. Correspond
ence is now in progress between the United States and Germany that
may lead to serious friction. It is thought probable that there will
have to be eventually a new commission to frame a new treaty, and
if so it is likely Germany will then propose to partition the islands.
The United States will not consent to this. Great Britain has always
taken a rather passive interest in Samoan affairs, but there is no
doubt that her influence will in the future, as in the past, be thrown
on the side of the United States.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW TORK, Aug. 25.â The Thing
valla line steamer Norge, which arrived
to-day, reports that she sank the
French fishing schooner La Coquette of
Bayonne, France, on Saturday last on
the Grand Banks. The captain and
eight seamen were saved, but sixteen
men went down with the vessel.
The Norge sailed from Stettin August
3. The weather was generally fine to
the banks of Newfoundland, when it
became foggy with patches of clear
weather. Saturday, August 20, between
3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the
weather was foggy, but not so thick
that the vessel's speed was reduced.
Captain Knudson said he could see
about three cable lengths ahead. The
wind was fairly brisk from the west
southwest, when a vessel suddenly
loomed from the north with sails full
and stood directly across the bow of the
steamer. The bells were rung to stop
and back at full speed, but too late to
check the steamer's headway. The
stranger, a fishing schooner, fell across
the bow and with a crash was forced
over and sunk. Three men sprang
aboard the Norge.
The passengers of the Norge, most of
whom were about the decks, rushed
about in alarm at the shock, but were
soon quieted when they learned thai
the steamer was uninjured. A boat
was lowered and six men and a dog
were picked up. The vessel sank al
most immediately, and in sinking car
ried with her sixteen of her crew.
Captain Knudson said that, as a
steam vessel, the Norge was obliged to
keep out of the way of all sailing craft,
but this was a time when the sailing
vessel could do more to help herself
than a steamer.
â  The latter was going ahead at full
speed, but there was not time, in the
judgment of the captain, to reduce the
speed. The fisherman was an active
vessel, had a good breeze and was un
der good steerage way, but made no at
tempt to avoid the collision, keeping on
: with sails full until squarely under the
bow. The large hull of the Norge,
Captain Knudson said, should have
been visible for a long -distance.
At the office of the French Consul the
following names of the lost were given:
Lemant, Gannen, Allain, Lepron, Mon
slnet, Graffet, Curnitem, Halmgont,
Lescot, Iforquet, Gerard, Guernara, De
crotx, Minguri, Buurel and Bonper. All
were fishermen.
'"lit- report of Captain Berre of La
Coquett<* to the French Consul states
that when the collision occurred there
! was a heavy fog prevailing. The men
were all on deck fishing. Suddenly the
Norge appeared coming toward them,
head on. for their side. It was impos
sible to do anything to get out of the
way. The Norge, which was going at
, a speed of from eight to ten knots an
â  hour, struck La Coquette in the side.
! Her af termast fell toward the wheel.
j There were sixteen men in that part of
I the vessel and the rigging, sails and
, mast pinned them down, so that it was
inevitable death for them as the vessel
began to sink. The wheel was smashed
by the fallen mast' and control of La
Coquette was lost.
The Norge cut La Coquette clean in
i half. The steamer backed ;as quickly
as possible and; her crew lowered boats
and v went to the rescue of ~ the -â¢ men in
j the water. It was impossible to save
the sixteen men 1 who perished. La Co
j quette sank : at ; once. 7 â

I
SCENES AT HIS LAST ILLNESS
THERE WAS NO BLOOD POISON
ING AS ALLEGED.
The Physician Also Tells How the
Iron Chancellor Was Bobbed
of the Whole Object
of His Life.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN, Aug. 25.â Through the me
dium of his friend. Count yon Hohens
bruch, editor of the Taglische Bund-
s # chau. Dr. Schweninger gives a history
of his personal relations with Prince
Bismarck and his illness. Says Dr.
Schweninger:
"My whole thoughts were centered
upon the Prince. Now my life seems
aimless. My telegram of July 27 was in
no sense a lie. It was directed against
the sensational papers' announcement
that the Prince was afflicted with pois
oning of the blood. When I telegraphed
you the Prince was particularly well.
After a long series of sleepless nights
he had slept seven .hours and he felt
fresh and invigorated. He smoked five
pipes, one after the -other. I felt no un
easiness in leaving him. He was, in
deed, so well that I invited him to take
champagne after having forbidden him
to take any alcoholic drink since March.
" 'What, my dear Schweninger, may I
really drink some sec again?' cried the
Prince, rnGredulously.
"We drank a bortle and a half. He
was once again the Bismarck of old.
His pains had left him."
Dr. Schweninger described his histor
ical return to the dying Chancellor. He
says :
"Death was due to want of air in the
lungs, though he had imagined that it
would result from sudder. paralysis of
the brain or heart. There had always
been trouble in the lee: since the St.
Petersburg incident: but thit was by
no means as bad at the time of his
death as at many times previously. The
rapid closing of the coffin was dictated
by no desirv to prevent anybody what
ever from â Â»twi the body."
Passing from his professional to his
private rotations with Prince Bismarck,
Dr. Schwentnger relates that Bismarck
had repeated to him again and again
that his dismissal was his death sen
tence. It robbed him of the whole ob
ject of his life. The hermit of Fried
richsruht? had no field in which to ex
ercise his energy.
"His superb energy of soul." says Dr.
Sohwenin^er, "was intense. Often did
h.' say u< me: "The old Unmans volun
tarily took leave of life when they were
forced to quit the scene of their activ
ity, but this fate is not for nv>.' "
Eulogising Prince Bismarck's conver
sational powers Dr. Schweninger says:
"i remember not lontr since listening
to him discussing a particular subject
which he had hettcr left unmentloned.
In his passion ho suddenly clasped his
head with both hands and stormed: 'If
I could but interfere in this disgusting
business and tell thpin what result it
will have: but. a? you know, Schw.-n
inger. my trumpet will >ound no longer
It no longer holds wind.'
â¢â¢Mournfully the Iron Chancellor look
ed into the political future. 'We are
advancing toward difficult and danger
ous times.' he would say.
"Despite his temperament Bismarck's
pulse was scarcely sixty to the minute
His hings were magnificent. One breath
a minute would have sufficed him if
necessary. His character which I got
to know as no one else, was simplicity
itself. The phrase 'No one is great in
the eyes of his valet* did not apply to
Bismarck."

â¢and on the heels of him a neat, pink

â¢little' Japs with their hats on. And all
of these have their wives upon their

rwedded to their hats.
"Somebody is addressing me. It is the

. able man â and he says:
"Very gratifying, isn't it?"
"Is it?" I say, feeling that I' have
missed something and looking around

gentle, likeable eyes. I feel a firm
r ]j, s p â the same, alas! that was given
thÂ« hacK and the soda water and the
dry goods and the four little Japanese
hats â over my hand. I hear a pleasant
voice saying that it is very glad to see
me, and that it hopes I am enjoying
â Honolulu, and havp I met Mrs. Dole?
And' then I have that pleasure and
ppeak to the others whom I know and
pV, the way of the greater and the less.
'What do you think of this?" I ask
the Army.
"Very nice," the Army replies sol
emnly, ac though it never had seen the
brilliant balls of fine old Virginia, the
." smart cotillons of gay New Yorkâ
"Very nice, indeed."
Ah: I forgot. Every one is not
here, like myself, for pleasure.
As 1 1 look about I wonder if any one
else is here for pleasure. The crowd is
coming. The hall is a wad of incon
gruous costumes and flushed unquiet
faces. This wad crushes into the ball
room and loses identity in another wad
of the same kind, color and pattern.
The room wears that troubled, uncer
tatn. inquiring air, peculiar to the
crowd which never has found itself all
together before.
A stunning woman comes through
the door and sweeps the room with a
turn of her head, and for a moment
sees no one that she knows, and then
drifts slowly toward a little group
which holds itself aloof. Presently
the crowd is punctuated by several of
these little groups, none of which seem
to have bowing acquaintance with an
other, for ail they are so slightly se
lect. My beauty wears a frock that
shows a handsome shoulder. She is
very tall, very vain, very suberb in
color, height, carriage, poise, with a
free and charming glance and a frank
and charming smile. lam told she is
the .wife of a Marshalâ to whom I offer
the respectful felicitations of a stran
ger. She is easily the belle of this
shabby little gratifying Annexation
Ball and might as easily be the belle of
a much more splendid affair. And, be
sides, I see one beautiful girl with
dark hair wrapped about a little cameo
head, which rises like a pure, pale
flower from a simple muslin frock that
suits its sweet, chaste outline well.
And, besides, again, a score of younger
girls, all sweet to look upon because
all youth is sweet and fresh and fair
to see, and light of foot and eager to
enjoy.
The band has been playing for an
i hour before the ball begins. I think it
i is the soda water clerk who sets it
rolling. If not, then another as gal
lant and brave as he. It takes both
courage and gallantry and some phys
ical strength to trip the light fantastic
;at the Annexation Ball. It is a matter
of elbows rathor than of heels. But
after the first heroic example everybody
i develops these handsome qualities and
! takes to wrangling for the floor. The
j official party sinks wearily into the old
j throne chairs and smoothes its tired,
nerveless hands and talks entirely to
I itself, and does not look one-half so
I democratic as it did; but, rather, a lit
j tie bored and distant and as if all this
| were more of duty than of pleasure.
j And at about a quarter before 11. when
j the gratifying ball was at its height.
I the President and his wife and the
i United States Minister and his wife and
the army and the navy and the very
few people who mattered went quiet
ly out from the ballroom and got them
selves into their wraps and down the
steps and into their carriages and away
to their homes to seek deserved repose.
I slipped out, too, but not so far. Only
to the grounds by the stairs at the back
and through the trees to see the hun
dreds of electric lights starring the
double row of balconies and blazing in
color from the Union's shield above the
door; to hear the night wind sighing in
the palms, the sleepless mynah calling
to his mate; to look upward to the
calm, cold stars which keep so near a
watch above Hawaii nei.
The ballrooom was insufferable. I
went into the hall and sat upon the
noble stair beside a lady who wore
a white sailor hat and feather boa with
her black decoilete gown.
"Did you get any punch?" she asked
socially.
"No," I said, "I did not."
"You didn't miss anything." Then
she relapsed into gloomy silence.
"What is the matter with it?" I in
quired.
"Nothing," she said, laughing sud
denly. "Nothing this time."
"I don't think I understand."
"Weren't you at the last one? Oh!
Then you wouldn't. They had a long
j supper table with things spread on it
] and a big bowl of punch in the middle,
i and the Portuguese all came, and while
: the dancing was going on they made a
\ raid on the supper and carried every
: thing off. You know they take their
babies with them everywhere, and
! while one of them was reachin-g she
I dropped hers and it fell into the punch.
j Of course It screamed and she screamed
| and everybody rushed out, and there
j she was with a turkey, a whole turkey,
jin one hand and the baby, all over
! punch, in the other." She laughed wild
â  ly again at the recollection.
"Dear me!" said I, hopefully. "Do
I you think anything like that will hap
j pen to-night?"
She shook her head. "There's no
Portuguese here to-night and there's
no supper. I believe they're going to â¢â 
pass around ice cream and cake after
a while. I shan't wait for it."
The punch was ladled from a corner !
of the broad balcony. My friend in I
the white sailor hat and the black ball
gown had a little more and then she
went home. I noticed that she went
alone, and, after she was gone, my
laundress came and whispered to me
mysteriously that she was no lady.
I had been sitting with her In peace
and amity for fifteen minutes on the
stairway in the sight of all the world.
Bat then this was such a democratic ;
and gratifying ball.
I walked forthâ under close escort this
time â to the broad balcony and looked
on the claret punch, where It was pale !
pink in the bowl. My friend who was
no lady was right.. There was nothing
the matter â nothing â not even claret.
The ice cream and cake went around, j
Also sandwiches and the rÂ«st of the I
punch. The ball devoured the refresh- 'â¢
ments standing, with the wondering !
eyes of the Kamehamehas looking !
down from the old Palace walls,< i
in memories of royal feasts.
They looked on no sons or daughters ;
of their dusky race. Hawaii nei sent
regrets to the Annexation Ball. For the
first time in the history of these ipl- â 
ands an entertainment has been given i
and attended exclusively by whites.
But it was Hawaii nei who drew the
color line.

PRESENTATION OF THE STARS AND STRIPES TO THE NATIVE HAWAIIAN
REGIMENT.
; take the oath of allegiance to the
United States of America and pre
sented with the old American flag
j which was used on the United States
! cruiser Boston.
The scene was touching in the ex
treme. The men of the Hawaiian
I Regiment wept freely and several of
j them, eight or nine out of a single com-
I pany, refused positively to take
I the * oath. While their comrades
| uncovered and with uplifted hand
! received and acknowledged the
i oath of allegiance to an alien land,
I they stood sullenly with their caps
1 drawn over their eyes and their guns
< clasped in their hands, blind and d ftf
; alike to the urging of their officers and
j the example of their brothers in
i arms.
Colonel Fisher presented the Ameri
can Flag with an appropriate speech.
The old flag from the Boston has
seen better days. Its red and blur- are
faded, its white is dingy and its stars
are dim. This, which would make it
all the dearer to Americans, was re
ceived as something of a slight by the
sensitive and so recently wounded Ha
walians. Many of the men of the
Regiment regarded it with ill-concealed
contempt, and their weeping friends
and sweethearts in the crowd gathered
about the grounds, smiled derisively as
the faded flag went up when the giy
Hawaiian colors had Just been low
ered.
One hearty American cheer saved the
moment to both Hawaiians and Amer
icans as Old Glory went marching by.

MADRID, Aug. 25.â The Liberal In a

NEW YORK, Aug. 25.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
I understand that the Instructions to
the Cuban commissioners do not con
template the evacuation of Cuba before
November 1, though no specific date is
mentioned. A Cabinet officer told me
to-night that the American flag will
probably not be floating o-ver Havana
before that date. The American army
of occupation, he said, would not start
for Cuba before the latter part of Oc
tober.

Special Correspondence of The Call.
BY ALICE RIX
HONOLULU, Aug. 18.â The Commis
sioners arrived in Honolulu by the
Oceanic steamship Mariposa yesterday
morning at 5:30 o'clock.
As soon as the San Francisco papers
were distributed, I called personally on
Senator Cullom, who is at the Hawai
ian Hotel, and showing him a copy of
a San Francisco morning paper of the
11th inst., which printed certain state
ments purporting to come from him
and reflecting seriously on the accom-
modations and management of the
Oceanic Steamship Company's line of
steamers and the business character
of one of its proprietors.
Senator Cullom had not seen the is
sue of the paper in question and ex
pressed great surprise when he learned
that his name had been used and in a
manner by no means flattering to his
dignity or his position as United States
Commissioner.
He gave me full authority to deny
flatly and in whatever terms I might
ccc fit the statements attributed to
"What I did say and what I did
feel," he said, "was Just this: "We were
going to the islands on business of im
portance to the Government of the
United States and, as a commission, we
were disappointed to find that better
accommodation could not be given us
for the ocean trip to the islands, to
which we had looked forward as the
pleasantest stage of our journey. We
found the Mariposa crowded with pas
sengers and freight â which," and Sena
tor Cullom bowed politely, "is a tribute
to the popularity of the line. "We had
ladies in our party and we regretted
they could not have had roomier quar
ters. We did not know â I did not ask
at leastâ until I was directly Informed
in San Francisco of the demands made
on the Oceanic line by reason of send
ing American troops on to Manila, and,
in my first annoyance at finding it
must be cramped quarters or no quar
ters until another sailing day, I did not
consider the matter from any stand
point but that of our personal incon
venience. I understand here in Ho
nolulu that the demand for food sup
plies and other freight has been far in
excess of the means of supply. Now
you may quote me as saying further
that our trip was one of the most en
joyable I have ever taken In any dl- |
rectlon or under any circumstances.
Everything was done for our comfort
and pleasure and I shall be pleased If
you will make this statement In my ;
name. I have made a vow, founded â¢
on sad experiences of the past, never
to give a signed statement to any
newspaper, but you may use my name
in this matter as freely as you please.
I leave It, with perfect security, In your
hands." *
Congressman Hltt. speaking In rela
tion to statements attributed to him
regarding the "using as a freight boat"
of the steamship carrying the United
States Commission, said: "Of course
we were all slightly annoyed at the sit
uation, but no blame ran be attached
to the Oceanic Steamship Company.
Through an act of war their service
has been severely crippled. Their
steamers are being used to carry Old
Glory to the farthermost ends of the
Pacific, and It would be most unpa
triotic on our part to censure the men
to whose enterprise the quick trans
portation of American troops to Ma
nila has been due. We know that the
people of Honolulu have suffered con
siderable inconvenience by being de
prived of necessary food supplies, and
I can say for our party that the slight
annoyance we were put to counts as
nothing as against relieving the situa
tion in these islands which have been
of bo much benefit to our Government."
FAMOUS "FAMILY
COMPACr IS BROKEN
Political Machine of Hawaii Will Be-
come Demoralised Under the
New Turn of Affairs.
HONOLULU. Augr. 18.â The fa
mous "family compact," the politi
cal machine which not only direct
ed hut dictated the government of af
fairs of the so-called republic of Ha
waii, is broken.
In fact, it has been literallr smashed
to pieces, and the pieces have been
gathering themselves together and
forming into little minor machines,
each one of which is buoyed with
the hope of running things after
the commission has made its re
port and Congress has decided
what form of government is best
adapted to the peculiar conditions of
the islands.
The missionaries who conducted a re
public by a few people and for a few
people are discovering that being a
part and parcel of the United StateÃ is
not all that it was cracked up to be.
They are asking one another, "Where
are we at?" and the guesses are not
always reassuring.
True, the Dole Government is still
managing the affairs of Hawaii under a
provision of the Newlands resolution,
but ex-Mlnister Sewall is to all intents
and purposes temporary Governor of
the islands, and the change is not at
all to the liking of the men who for
rive years have perpetuated themselves
in offlce and grown fat and independ
ent at the public crib.
The action of the American Union
party, which is undoubtedly the ruling
political power in the islands, in openly
advocating Sewall for Governor has
caused consternation in tha ranks of
Dole and his Cabinet. While apparent
ly in sympathy with the Dole party,
they have been secretly working for the
ex-Minister, and confidently expected
that President McKinley's proclama
tion would name Sewall for Governor,
with full power to select a new Cabinet.
The patronage to be distributed by this
arrangement was what the American
Union party banked on. and now that
the expected change has not taken
place they are in a measure left en
tirely out in the cold.
The proclamation sent here by the
President was very vague, to say the
least, and the American Union party
dispatched by the last mail a strong
letter to Washington asking for ex
plicit instructions, and thoroughly de
fining their position. The terms of Dis
trict Judges and other minor officers
come to an end on September 1, and the
politicians want a finger in the pie
when the new appointees are named.
Considerable patronage is attached to
these offices, and the Filters, the cous
ins and the aunts of the "family com
pact" are liable to find themselves out
of a job when the instructions reach
here.
That Dole and his Cabinet are con
cerned about this new development of
things politic is evident from the un
natural desire of several of the party to
'retire to private life." It was not sup
posed that this element was anywhere
to be found in their compositions.
Attorney General Smith has already
sent in his resignation, and several oth
ers of the close corporation are leaning
strongly in the same direction.
A great and freezing coldness has
come between President Dole and Min
ister Sewall even in this land of glori
ous sunshine. Mr*. Dole is said to
j have snubbed Mrs. Sewall at the now
! famous "democratic" ball given In
j honor of the fin "-raising, and this seri
ous political rupture has set the gos
sipy tongues of all Honolulu to wag
ging furiously.
So the new political pot of Hawaii
boils merrily, and until definite instruc
tions arrive'from Washington every one
from Sewall down to the Janitor of the
executive building will still keep ask-
I ing, "Where do I get off?"
Splendid Dogs Are En ered for the
Union Park Stakes on
Saturday.
That there will be great sport at Union
Coursing Park on Saturday and Sunday,
goes without saying. The largest puppy
stake ever run on this coast will be de
cided and two rounds of It will be run
down on Saturday. The prizes amount
to the total of $852 50. Of this $525 is for
the old dog and . $327 50 for the puppy

NOW FRAMING A
GOVERNMENT FOR
HAWAIIAN ISLANDS
Members of the Commission Sent
From the United States
Reach Honolulu.
Upon Arrival They Exchange Courtesies With
Dole and Cabinet and Then Com
mence Their Labors.
HONOLULU, Aug. IS.â The steam
ship Mariposa and the steam schooner
Lakme arrived almost simultaneously
about half-past 5 o'clock yesterday
morning. The troops on the Lakme
were in excellent health, and had no
cases of sickness to report. They were
landed on the arrival of Colonel Barber
and in due course marched down to the
temporary encampment grounds at
Kapiolani Park.
Senators Cullom and Morgan and
Representative Hitt of the Hawaiian
Congressional Committee and their
contingent also arrived in perfect
health. They were greeted on board
by ex-Hawaiian Ministers to Washing
ton. Hon. F. M. Hatch and Hon. W. R.
Castle, and a few others, including
Senator Morgan's previous and pres
ent host, A. M. Ballou, the compiler of
our new code system.
"Over Seas," near Nuuana Valley,
will be Senator Morgan's domicile,
while Senator Cullom will reside at
suite 17 of the Royal Hawaiian Hotel,
made notable as the former dwelling of
ex-Secretary John W. Foster and many
other distinguished personages. Rep
resentative Hitt occupies the rebuilt
Snow cottage, adjacent to the hotel,
also distinguished as the former resi
dence of "Paramount" Blount, United
States Ministers Merrill and Stevens,
Senator Pettigrew and others.
The Commissioners exchanged cour
tesies yesterday afternoon with the
President and Cabinet, Hon. H. M. Se
v.all. Admiral Miller and the repre
sentatives of the press, and other dis
tinguished citizens. This morning they
visited their fellow Commissioner, As
sociate Justice of the Supreme Court
Walter F. Frear, who is invalided at
his residence, and there he took the
oath of office. This afternoon they will
meet to personally organize, and as
soon as possible and before setting to
work will proceed on a tour of inspec
tion of the island of Hawaii and prob
ably of all the principal islands of the
Hawaiian archipelago. Next week the
native Hawaiian .patriotic associations
will hold a formal meeting to appoint
a committee of conference with the
Commissioners.
Even in the few hours they have been
here Messrs. Cullom and Hitt have
created a most favorable impression
upon all who have had the pleasure of
meeting them; Senator Morgan, of
course, is well remembered by his
friends, and especially so by his oppo
nents, who are very uncharitably and
unforgivingly reminiscent.
It is practically useless to give you
interviews with them, for they have
said nothing of any importance or upon
which anything of the nature of infor
mation or of a line of action could be
based, except that they desire accurate
information of the conditions of the
country and the people before they
proceed to deliberative action. They
are rather seekers than imparters of
news. Acting in an advisory and not a
legislative capacity they are willing, if
consulted, to tender their advice to the
temporary Government on local mat
ters, especially in connection with the
loan acts passed by the last Legislature
to aid in internal improvements and
such like matters M would not in
trench upon the privileges and func
tions of Congress. Their future place
of deliberations will probably be the
legislative hall of the House of Repre
sentatives, the ancient throne room, as
there they will be in close connection
with the officials of the Government
and the archives. The sessions will be
partially of an executive nature, but
not strictly so, as they will adopt the
Blount precedent of sending for per
sons and papers and of listening to
suggestions. They decline most direct
ly to indicate the form of government
they may feel inclined to favor, and no
one can honestly blame them for their
reticence on a matter that they are
scarcely qualified to discuss upon so
brief an acquaintance. It is, however,
the feeling of those best qualified to
judge that If their investigations, as
undoubtedly they will be. are consci
entiously and thoroughly pursued, a
very liberal form of government will be
advised. One of the main contentions
will be that this has been a self-gov

Civil War Veterans and Naval Re
serves Escort the Body of the
Rough Rider to Its Last
Resting Place.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, Aug. 25.â Never
in the history of Santa Barbara have
such high marks of honor and respect
fceen bestowed upon the remains of one
of its citizens as were shown this af
ternoon at the funeral of Stanley Hol
lister, late of Roosevelt's Rough Riders.
Flags have been flying at half-mast
since his death, and this afternoon the
banks and business houses all
closed their doors and the schools
dismissed their pupils out of respect to
his memory.
The veterans of the Civil War, both
Confederate and Federal, about a
hundred In number, marched together
from the Grand Army Hall to
Knight's undertaking parlors, where
they were jojned by the Naval Re
serves of this city and Company A of
the local sharpshooters, and from there
they led the funeral procession to Trin
ity Church. Arriving there the mili
tary companies faced in line, the vet
erans bared their heads and the other
two presented arms as the body was
borne into the church.
The church was beautifully decorated
with floral decorations and national col
ors, and the solemn and beautiful ser
vice of the Episcopal church was read.
The ceremony was not a prolonged one,
the Rev. Mr. "Wakefield of San Jose of
ficiating in the absence of Rector Ram
! sey. The body was taken to the ceme
tery for Interment, it being a private
affair, and was witnessed only by the
near relatives.
Thus passed to the grave all that was
mortal of one of the most popular of
young men. He was the youngest son
of the late W. W. Hollister, whose
name is so closely connected with early
California and early Santa Barbara
history. A graduate of Harvard in its
literary department, a student of its
law school, he was among the first to
â  lay down his books and erasp his
musket in his country's service. Thrice
wounded in his short service he re
covered to fall a victim to malarial fe
ver.

A Ruling by the Internal Revenue
Commissioner at the Request of
California Wine Men.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 25.â The Commis
sioner of Internal Revenue modified his de
cision of July 5. I&9S, to the extent of
holding that when foreign or domestic
wines are transferred from bulk pack
ages to bottles in an immature state for
.storage in bins for a considerable length
of time for aging purposes, wine so trans
ferred to bottles will not be regarded as
having been "bottled for sale" until such
time as it arrives at a marketable con
dition, and the stamping of the bottle
may be deferred until then. As soon as
wines are in a marketable condition the
liability to the tax at once attaches and
stamps must be affixed. The affixing of
caps or labels to such bottles will be
taken as 'conclusive evidence that they
ar>- "bottled for sale," and if proper
stamps have not been attached prior to
that time the bottle must be stamped
without fail when caps and labels are
affixed. This ruling is rendered at the
urgent request of the associated vltieul
turlsts and wine merchants of California.

Four Herders Arrested by the New
Commissioner â Utah. "Volunteer

the Reservation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WAWONA, Cal., Aug. 25.â The Yo
semite Park, for the first time since it
became a national park, has been this
summer under the supervision of civil
ians. The custom has been to have the
park guarded and patrolled by the sol
diers of the regular army. The war
with Spain, however, caused the War
Department to send the soldiers in
tended for here to the Philippines, in
consequence of which Yosemlte Park
was without guard or patrol until June
25, when J. W. Zevely arrived to
take charge of the park. He immedi
ately gathered some of the best moun
taineers In this section and sent them
out into the park, one detail being in
charge of Special United States Land
Agent H. C. Cullom, and the other un
der Special Agent W. A. Buck.
They have done excellent work, not
withstanding the fact that the park
was being overrun with sheep at the
time, as the parties in charge of the
sheep had all the spring to drive their
flocks into the park. One hundred and
seventy-five thousand sheep have been
ejected from the park by the two de-
tails.
Special Agent Cullom returned yes
terday, having In charge four herders
whom he had under arrest for trespass
ing, their flocks being found in the
park. The sheep they had in charge
was the property of Miller & Lux and
G. W. Mordecai of Madera. Quite a
feeling exists among people here
against Miller & Lux for grazing nu
merous bands of sheep in the park, as
the firm is known to have thousands of
acres of land of its own. The herders
of these flocks have been ejected once,
and notified that if they returned they
would be arrested, but as they did not
heed the warning and were found in the
park, they were arrested and brought
here, their sheep being scattered by the
special agents.
Quite a number of other bands of
sheep have been found and have been
scattered, and other arrests have been
made..
Owing to the existence of numerous
and extensive fires In the park an extra
force of men was engaged by Super
intendent Zevely to fight them, and
they are now under control. Utah
Volunteer Cavalry which left San
Francisco on the 13th arrived here to
day. They are under command of Cap
tain Came, and are to guard the To
semite Park the balance of this season
under the direction of Superintendent
Zevely. The troops go into quarters at
Camp A. E. Wood, formerly occupied
by the regular troops.

Flyers Ready for the
State Fair Meeting.
HOST THAT WORKED WELL
EX-LONG DISTANCE CHAMPION
GILEAD DOING NICELY.
Local Plungers Many Thousands
Ahead at the Far East â News
of California Racing Men
and Horses.
Gallopers, trotters and pacers are re
ceiving their "preps' for the State Fair
meeting 1 at Sacramento, which begins
September 5. Oakland, Sacramento.
Fresno, Los Angeles and other "horsey"
cities will have good representatives at the
(â¢timing meeting, and the number of good
horses in training insures a rousing meet
in the capital city of California.
Burns & Waterhouse have about twenty
head in training at the Oakland course
nearly, if not all, two-year-olds. Trainer
Ben Timmons has been sending mout of
them along pretty fast.
George Bertolacd's Olive, Major Cook
and a few others are doing nicely at the
same track, and Frank Taylor has a few
in charge and doing well.
The Messrs. Boots left a large string at
the Elmwood ranch, Milpitas, and it is
expecn-d that they will have several rep
resentatives by Brutus at the Sacramento
meeting.
Nkk S. Hall Is expected to return from
Chicago with his flyers In. time to take
part in the running, and most of the Cali
fornia strings at present racing in Mon
tana will have returned by the time the
first bell rings at Agricultural Park.
From Sacranlento we received the fol
lowing anent the horses In training:
Tom Boyle's Morlnga is looking and go-
Ing well, and the same can be said of J.
Welsh's Lump and stable companion,
down from Woodland.
Goldscratch, by imp Goldfinch-Helen
Scratch, has as much speed as ever, but
It is extremely doubtful if he ever fancies
going a long Journey, for he tires at the
finish of his workouts.
Scarborough, the California Derby win
ner, and the consistent Harry Thoburn, of
Atkln & Lottridge's string (leased now,
however, to others), are shaping up ex
ceedingly well and will take some beating
when they "go to the races."
Covlngton's Carbineer seems to be con
siderably Improved over his laÂ«t spring's
form, and is working most satisfactorily.
\\ . Gardiner's sister to Candelaria has
a lot of speed and works along like a race
mare.
There is a black filly in Martin's string
that works well enough to make most
folks think she should win early at the
coming meet.
Gilead, the ex-champion long-distance
horse, which has been "on the shelf" for
a couple of years, bounds along with ap
parently more speed than ever, and if his
"leg" stands the tinal touches old Dan
Reeves will give him, he may be able to
down a Rey El Santa Anita again and
break a record or two. Reeves deserves
frreut credit- for getting this grand old
cripple "up to a race" again.
Arbaeea, the brother to Olinthus, Sutton
and Diggs, is surely rounding into a race
horse, and is moving in a manner most
satisfactory to Trainer Ab Stemler, and
the gr<"*at "mare Fleur de Lls Is looking
well and beginning to trot along some.
Callente has been fired and blistered.
El Mero, by Morello-Mifis Pickwick,
looks mighty well and moves well In his
workouts.
Old Buckwa, the record-breaker, Crom
well and Rey del Tierra are big and
strong and doing satisfactory work for
Trainer Murry.
Among the light-harness horses at Snc
ramento that are going nicely at "the
Park" are Dynamo, by Falrosa, and a
chestnut two-year-old colt by Dynamo,
both pacers; Sophie R (pacer), by Roy
Wilken; You Bet (pacer), by McKinney,
the bay gelding Toney Junto (trotter);
Bixbv, by Strathway; Silas Simon (pacer),
by Cfolonel X R; Homeway (trotter), by
Strathway; De Bernardl-Basler (pacer);
Bobbie J (trotter), by George J; Who Is

ToggleÃ, Liaterlne, Nellie Ely, Bull Sadie,
Harry Raymond, a Brigadier mare, a
full sister to Joe Wheeler, and Arthur
Holt (trotter).
Abe Stein, the plunger of this city. Is
$25,000 winner on the Saratoga meeting.
Jack Newman, the Kansas City heavy
bettor, who wae a heavy winner here
lust season, is reported to be a heavy
loser at St. Louisâ in fact, to be nearly
"broke." Joe Hopkins, who was "out of
luck" at the local tracks for a couple of
seasons, has struck a winning gait at the
far East and is roported several thou
sands of dollars "to the good."
Bob McKibben, the official announcer at
both Oakland and Ingleside tracks, has
just returned from Chicago, where he has
been working for Bookmaker George
Rose. He reports "the game" around the
Windy City in a most nourishing condi
tion.

Flavored With Lemon
Extract.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MIDDLETOWN, N. V.. Aug. 25.â Ice
cream prepared with lemon extract,
purchased from a traveling salesman a
few days ago, has caused the death of
three persons, and a score of others are
sick and more fatalities are expected.
The dead a^-e: Mrs. Herman Mlch
aelis, 613 Ninth avenue. New York;
Mrs. William Seder, Mount Vernon, N.
V. ; Robert Jones, a farmer living near
Greenfield, N. Y.
The seriously sick are: H. J. Bard
ing, New York; Herman Musdereh,
Mount Vernon; Mark Holmes, New-
York; Mrs. Snyder and daughter, New
York; Mrs. Hanson, New York; Mrs.
D. A. Oaborne, Newburg; Mrs. C. E.

Mrs. Catherine Taylor, Philadelphia;
Miss Alice C. Leaton, Brooklyn; Henry
Weber, New York; Mrs. Arthur Jones
and three sons, Greenfield, N. V. ; Mr.
and Mrs. William Jones, Mountain
Dale.
These constitute nearly all the sum

at Greenfield, which is about five miles
from Mountain Dale; also the proprie
tor's parents and family. The ice cream
was eaten at Sunday's dinner, and
about 9 o'clock that night Mrs. Seder
was attacked with nausea. Soon after
others were similarly seized, and by
midnight the two cottages were filled
with sick. Dr. J. F. Curlette of Moun
tain Dale was summoned, and he diag
nosed the cases as ptomaine poisoning.
He called in Dr. Munson of Wood
burne, and the two have worked inces
santly. Mrs. Seder died Tuesday, Mrs.
Michaelis Wednesday night, and early
this morning Robert Jones died.
Dr. Curlette believes six deaths will
occur.

BRACES BCDY AND BRAIN.
What Mariani Wftae Does to Sooth*,
Strengthen and Sustain
the System.
Vln Mariani (Marlanl T7!ne) is recom-
mended as a tonic by the medical pro-
fession all over the world. It has re-
ceived written recommendations from
more than 8000 American physicians.
Mariani Wine soothes, strengthens
i and sustains the system and btacet
body and brain. It gives strength;
therefore may it be described as the
conqueror of disease and the "promoter
of health and longevity.
Mariani Wine Is especially indicated
for malaria, fever and ague and all
miasmatic fevers. It promptly dispels
chills, abates malarial fever, and givea
a sense of buoyancy and vigor.
Mariani Wine is furthermore of espe-
cial value In cases of Neuralgia, Nerv-
ous Debility, Muscular Relaxation,
Mental and Physical Depression and
Exhaustion, Overwork or Overstrain,
Insomnia, Headache, NervouÃ Dyspep-
sia, Loss of Appetite, Emaciation and
Consumption. It builds up the vital
forces and is a powerful rejuvenator. It
gives strength to the nervous system,
firmness and elasticity to the muscles,
and richness to the blood. It benefits
all and injures none.
Mariani Wine is palatable and suited
to the most delicate stomachs. In the
cases of pale, puny, sickly children it la
invariably used with great benefit.
For overworked men and delicate
women Marianl Wine works wonders.
Marianl Wine is sold by all Druggists.
Try It and you will find that It will well
sustain its reputation. One word of
caution, howeverâ let no representation
or explanation induce you to accept a
substitute. "Just as good" usually leada
to disappointment.
To every one writing to Marianl &
Co., 62 West 15th street. New York City,
will be sent, free, an interesting little
book containing portraits and auto-
gTaphs of Emperors, Empress, Princes,
Cardinals, Archbishops and other dis-
tinguished personiurM. indorsing Vln
Mariani.

The following interesting letter was re-
Ci Iwed.by.a :r.< mber of the Knights of the
Red Branch from Joseph E. Donnelly, a
member of Company L. of the First Cali
fornia Volunteers, who wont to Manila
with the first expedi
tion.
Mr. Donnelly was
burn in Cnuntv
Longford, Ireland,
where he received
his education. He
came here a few
years ago and was
employed in the es
tablishment of J. J. i
O'Brien, but recently |
left that position to
study medicine un- I
der Dr. Shiels. He
was an enthusiastic
member of the
Knights of the Red
Branch Rifles, and
when the services of
that organization
were not accepted,
he volunteered with j
the First Regiment:
CAMP DEWEY. Be
fore Manila, July 25,
My Dear Friend: We
have been here and at 1
Cavite for the past
four weeks, but have ;
made no move against
the Spaniards as yet.
We" spent two weeks at |
Cavite, opposite which
â  in Manila Hay
the fight took place be- ;
tween the American '
and Spanish fleets. 1
Frcm th" Marine bar
racks, where we wore
quartered, we could
f see seven of the
sunken ships. Cavite !
ed a few shots
from Dcwey which
.: ' â¢ played sad havoc with
. -.th.--' '-place, the fort being a complete -wreck,
" .w-h!le the barracks where we slept had a few
.â¢â¢ hi-les'ln- the roof which let the rain in on us,
and.- it rains here with peculiar persistency,
â¢ especially at night. The heat at times is ter
rible. The sun comes blazing down with a
â ;. glar-trig intensity and not a breeze to relieve
the 'grilling heat.
â¢ â  -.We are now encamped at this place, which
'. Is about ' four miles from Manila, and have
J>eeh- here since the arrival at the second ex
pedition. The whole army, with the exception
â¢ ! -of -the "Fourteenth Regulars, is here. Between
â : . â  up find Manila the insurgent army is posted.
/ -Th.?ir furthest outpost Is about two miles from
â¢ the .city. The Spanish intrenchments extend
â  . To "within a half mlie of the insurgent lines,;
. â â¢ a'nd'the intervening space is the scene of nlght
''.' â¢â¢!>â¢â ' battles. Were it not for us the Spaniards
would -wipe the natives off the island. They
. "defeaj: them in almost every engagement, and
" '. the' only reason for not following up their vie
.:.. â¢ tofy.ls that we are behind the insurgents, who
â¢ m variably fall hack on us. The Spaniards do
' riot- seem to care to attack us. I guess they
.-â " fes.f it would be a good excuse for Dewey
â " -.to -.bombard the city, which is completely at
â  hie 'mercy from the sea side. They therefore
'.'wish us to assume the offensive; then they can
. â¢â¢ claim that they- were only defending their own.
. and hope that- some of the .European . powers
.'â¢"will intervene to prevent the bombardment of I

'-. .W; J. Sinclair, E. Duncan and Matt.

â ; the â¢ Rush House yesterday afternoon.
â¢ â¢ They are the Klomlikers who returned on
: the steamer Brunswick, laden with gold
dusts which they had picked up on the
Yukon. The dust was, in two packages.
One 'was a cylinder made of galvanized Iron
â â  -whlch'-.waa securely lucked. This weighed
;â¢ about â¢ seventy-live pounds. Then they
hal a small valise which contained about
. sixty or .seventy pounds more. The dust
' was; taken to the mint to be transformed
â¢ into the coin of the realm, and this is
what; .made the trio so joyful, for double
eagles are an easier form of payment than
: the -weighing of gold dust. \ '
â ' . ;"The amount of treasure which we have

SLY TACTICS
ARE EMPLOYED
Want Overhead Trolley
Systems.
MARKET-ST. COMPANY AWAKE
AIMING TO OBTAIN A CHEAP
LINE DOWNTOWN.
E. P. E. Troy, the insurance Man,
Makes Some Statements Bear
ing Strongly on Thig
Point.
The statement is made by E. P. E. Troy,
the California street insurance man, that
the Market Street Railway Company is
bringing various influences to bear to ul
timately secure the privilege of stringing
overhead trolley wires along Market
street. Mr. Troy said yesterday: "In or
der to lead gradually up to this end the
company recently suggested to the Mer
chants' Association the circulation of the
printed query blank, of which mention
has been made in The Call, asking prop
erty owners and tenants on Montgomery,
Sansome and adjacent streets if they de
slred an electric double track service on
Sixth to Market and Taylor, along iay
lor to Post, on Post to Montgomery, with
a single track service, using turnouts, on
Montgomery to Jackson, along Jackson
to Sansome, and further, with double
tracks from Sansome to Market. The
question was also put, as an evident al
ternative. 'Do you desire all tracks on
your street to be taken up and no street
car service there?' While the statement
was not directly made, the inference was
plain that if the electric service was not
desired no service of any kind would be
furnished.
â¢'Now," continued Mr. Troy, "the pro
posed electric lines are all within me tire
limits of the city, and there is serious
objection to the erection of overhead
wires on these business 'streets, both on
account of the interference with the tele
phone wires, the increased danger from
lire and the other risks incident to the
stringing of highly charged wires over
the center of busy streets. Many prop
erty owners have filled out the query
blanks thoughtlessly in favor of the elec
tric overhead wires, not having consid
ered the consequences. They do not bear
in mind the fact that the granting of the
privilege asked will place another elec
tric wire across Market street and also
bring two other wires down to ft. There
are already two electric wires crossing
Market streetâ one at Third and another
at Fourth. Now how easy it will be, if
the company secures the new concessions,
to come forward after a while and ask
the city for the privilege of connecting
the various ends of wires along Market
street by running an overhead trolley
down that thoroughfare. The company
sees ahead. It is gradually encroaching
so as not to attract attention and opposi
tion.
"The company, by going at the matter
in the way that it has. cleverly manages
to give the Board of Supervisors an ex
cuse to grant the privilege for overhead
trolleys on the strength of the claim that
the property owners want them erected.
In truth, very few of the citizens whose
interests are actually involved have
signed the petition."
DIRECTORS TO ACT.
Consider a Request to Operate the
Sixth and Post Street Lines
by Electricity.
A meeting of the directors of the Mar
ket Street Railway Company was held
yesterday afternoon. General Manaeer
E. P. Vining read the letter which he had
received from the Merchants' Association
in regard to changing the Sixth street and
Post street lines to electric roads and
asking for various other transfer privi
leges. Manager Vining was authorized to
use his own judgment in regard to the
new transfer system asked for. The ex
ecutive committee of the board of direc
tors will decide as to the advisability of
operatine the two lines mentioned by
electricity, and it is expected tnat they
will act favorably on the proposition.

LIGHT FOR THE STREETS.
Electricity Will Soon Take the Place
of Gas Lamps.
The Merchants' Association is gratified
that its efforts to improve the lighting of
the city by having electric lights in
stalled upon the business streets in place
of gas lamps have succeeded. Complying
with the recent request of the association,
the Board of Supervisors has just or
dered electric lights over the crossings of
all the business streets, in accordance
with the schedule prepared by the asso
ciation. These lights will be installed as
rapidly as possible. The electric light
company has already begun placing them
on Polk street, and the lights will be
turned on there next week.
The Merchants' Association requested
the company to install the lights on Polk
street first, as a recognition of the enter
prise of the merchants on that street,
who were the first to light their street
with electric lights, and have maintained
part of them at their own expense for
nearly two years. Assoon as the light
ing of Polk street is completed the work
of installing the lights downtown will
commence, and the lamps will be lighted
on each street as soon as all the lamps
on that street are installed.
Trouble Over a Chinese.
The Chinese Bureau Is in a quandary
over the case of Ginn Ken Yin, who ar
rived here on the Zealandia on May 28.
He applied for admission to the coun
try on the claim that he was born here,
but it was proven that he was born in
China, and Commissioner Heacock or
dered he be sent bark to China. When
the time came to deport him the Pa
cific Mail Steamship Company refused to
carry him, as they had not brought him
bt-re, and it is impossible to send him
to Honolulu, as he was ordered to China.
The case will probably be taken to the
United States courts to have the kinks
straightened out.

FIRE CHIEF'S
ANNUAL REPORT
More Engines Should Be
Provided.
OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS
FULLY PAID DEPARTMENT IS
STRONGLY ADVOCATED.
Water Supply Should Be Increased
by the Removal of Small Mains
and Larger Ones Sub
stituted.
At the meeting of the Fire Commis
sioners yesterday afternoon Chief Sulli
van submitted his annual report, which
contained some valuable information.
The appropriation for the past fiscal
year was $62Â»,000 and the expenditure
$625,975 10, leaving a balance of $24 90. The
total losses by tire amounted to $878,
259 72, the total Insurance on the prop
erty $4,317,721 76, and the total amount
paid on insurance $673,786 72. There had
been 911 alarms of fire, including still
alarms, and sixteen and four-sixths miles
of pipe had been laid.
The chief made the following recom
mendations:
I renew my recommendation that the de
partment be reorganized Into a fully paid sys
tem, with the entire force continually on duty.
The force should be increased to at least thirty
five steam lire engine companies, nine truck
companies, six chemical engine companies, two
water tower companies, one nreboat company
and two monitor battery companies.
The engine-houses now occupied by engine
company 22 and truck 5 ehould be torn down
unJ a new modern structure erected in
its place. A Bultable lot should be purchased
in the vicinity of Point L*>bos and Masonic
avenues and a new engine-house built thereon,
and engine company 22 transferred there from
its present location on Post street, near Fill
more, as said district Is in need of better pro
tection. A lot and house should be purchased
and erected in the vicinity of tuxth and Bran-
I nan streets and a new truck company stationed
thereat Tins in in the heart of the milling dis
trict, where numerous fires have demonstrated
the necessity of better protection. I further
recommend the purchase of a suitable lot and
the f-rection of a new building for the water
In view of the immense value of shipping
interests of this city better protection should
be glvi-n tn the water front, and I therefore
earnestly recommend that a light-draught,
high-power nreboat of good speed and large
pumping capacity be provided for that pur
pose Hundreds of thousands of dollars might
be saved to the community by tfce expenditure
I of comparatively few thousands in this direc-
A new steel drill tower should be built in tha
rear of enÂ«lne-houÂ«e 28. All en*lne-bpOMi
should be lighted by electricity and the latest
appliances employed for that purpose. The
; silent system of signals and new switch boards
â  should be provided in all firehouses of the de
i partment. The latest improved keyless doors
! should be placed on the fire boxes in the raer
j cantilf districts, as a means" of saving much
i valuable time in turning In alarms of fire.
I again recommend the immediate removal
i of the fire alarm office to pome suitable place
1 in the City Hall, and the purchase of a proper
â  plant for the conduct of this important branch
; of the Fire Department. In its present location
the office Is in great danger of being destroyed
I by fire, together with its valuable appliances,
, and should be located in a safer position.
I also recommend that the water supply
throughout the city bt- increased by the re
moval of all small and inadequate water mains
and replacing them with eight, twelve, sixteen
an<] twenty-four inch mains in all portions of
the city not already supplied with mains of
large and sufficient capacity, and more fire
liy.lr.ints ph^uld be set in all districts that are
not sufficiently provided therewith. I further
recommend that all cisterns now available for
fire purposes be repaired, and that 100 addl
i tlonal underground reservoirs, with capacities
of not less than 10,000 gallons, be built on the
I corners of streets in thf> hotel and mercantile
: districts, and fed by eight-Inch pipes with gate
I valves attached directly from the street mains.
| By this means many more engines could be
! stationed nearer to fires, nnd their streams
advanced into one large stream would enable
I the department to fight fires more effectively.
REPORTS FROM RAILROADS.
One Road Shows a Gain for the Year
and Another a Large Deficit.
In accordance with the law, the Nevada,
California and Oregon Railway filed its
annual report for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1898. with the Railroad Commis
sioners yesterday. This company operates
si-vi nty-nlne mites of track, running be
tween Reno, Nevada, and Amedee, Cali
fornia. The report shows that the gross
earnings were $84,738 05 and the operating
expenses $05,069 *'â <. leaving a net income
for the year of $19,663 22.
The Areata and Mad River Railroad,
which is eighteen miles in length, also sub
mitted a statement which shows their
gross earnings to be $39,082 99. and the
operating expenses $78,662 08, thus leaving
a deficit of $39,57:) 09.

Valley Road Prepress.
Connection will soon be made on the
San Joaquin Valley road between Visalia
and Tulare, the track layers having
reached a point just one mile from the
latter place. It Is expected that all work
will be finished by Saturday next, but
no trains will be run on this branch of
the road until the fourteen miles of track
between Tulare and Corcoran Junction
will have been completed, which will be
by the end of next month.
Work on the tunnel through the Contra
Costa hills for the extension west from
Stockton to Point Richmond is pro
gressing as rapidly as the tedious nature
of that work will allow. Of the 5700 feet
to be bored, the east end is In nearly
500 feet and the west end 700 feet, thus
making a total of 1200 feet, or about one
fifth of the entire length.

A PBOIHSINa FUTURE.
A WELL-KNOWN AUTHORITY PREDICTS
A FINE FALL TRADE.
The cncular of Henry Clews, under date of
New York, August -' . says: "The return of
peace the promise of business prosperity and
en abundance of cheap money have been ir
resistible factors of the Stock Exchange. Of
course many of the sensational advances of
this week can be attributed to manipulation,
but such manipulation would not have been
possible did not the favorable conditions exist.
As a matter of fact there was much less ma
nipulation than usual in a market of the recent
magnitude and strength. Professional operators
saw the market taken right away from the
by the rush of outside buying, and all *Â«<Â£"
to check the advance Â«"Â« fruitless for a time
day's rise would have marked the culm nation
of a bull movement, but this can hardly be co
new. although no surprise need be exprtsbed
If the pace has been shown too rapid and i
resting *peil U. needed. Ac we have, however,
repeatedly stated these are not ordinary times
[he ccndttioM Â«ue very unusual and one-sided
and it iÂ« many yew.) since we have had each
a complex absence of disturbing conditions.
The putting of Burlington and Qulncy . upon a
6 per cent basis was a very practu-ai l 11 "? 1 â¢"
lion of the improvement In the railroad situa
tion. A lew roads have already increased
their dividends and others are sure to follow.
Oa a i per cent basis an advance of 1 per cent
In the dividend rate ought to raise the value
or an ordinary stock at least 20 points, so .that
the prospect of Increased dividends affords a
bail* for the strongest and most active kind
Â°'-Th;-'war : "i"no longer a factor affecting the
interests that center in Wall street. Its ex
citing uncertainties are ended. For some time
at least the reopening of the late blockaded
ports will be attended with a return to more
than the normal movement of merchandise,
hut the matter of chief interest will be the
eager outlook for opportunities for American
Investment In plantation properties and in
mercantile undertakings. Indeed the interest
in such ventures has risen to such a pitch that
It will not be surprising if this tort of enter
prise is overdone. There can be no doubt, how
ever that under Spanish domination the
rich' sources of both Islands have never re
ceived much more than a surface development
and a large and valuable trade with botn
k-lands must soon be forthcoming.
"The future of this country is certainly full
of mlae, and all the favorable conditions
that exist stand for an active stock market
with a rising tendency. The half of the year
JS3S say from July to January 1, will beyond
doubt mark the highest notch of prosperity
which this country has attained in its history,
and it Is that prospect which Is at the bottom
of stock values at the present time. It Is not
surprising, therefore, that the current Is at
"In all my business experience In Wall street,
which covers a period of forty years, 1 nave
never seen a brighter outlook for all business
interests in this country than the situation now
presents." ,

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Aug. 2"i.â The close of the stock
Market v.-day gave every indication of re
newed absorption on a large scale by a pow
erful speculative interest, which accounts for
an additional rise in prices. The buying in the
la-Â«t hour followed a period of extreme dull
ness, during which the market was JÂ«ft to
itself. The tone of the trading In the earlier
part of the day showed that there was a con
siderable outside element disposed to take
pr 'fits, or to stop losses if they were
the unfortunate ones who bought stocks at the
top figures last week.
Hut it was also evident that the pressure of
this Liquidation was not severe and that the
offerings of stocks were nnt increased at the
low level of prices. On the contrary, there were
sufficient buying orders with commission
houses at a level below the market to check
the decline. Some of the recent elements of
weakness were also removed. For instance,
Manhattan showed recuperative power by ris
lng 2 points, to the distress of the bears. There
Was also sufficient vigor in the upward move
ment of sugar to give color to the rumors
prevalent of the conclusion of a working agree-
BM at with new competitors. The quarterly
statement of Lake Shore was a significant ex
hibit of the possibilities of refunding the large
decrease in nt t earnings for the present quar
ter, being so far offset by the decrease in the
charges that the surplus is still above last
year's level. The buying of New York Central
was induced by this exhibit and the buoyant
recovery of Burlington had in view the possi
bilities for that property in a refunding of Its
mortgage indebtedness. The ready response of
sterling exchange to any hardening tendency
to the .money market gives assurance of relief
from that ciuarter of any money stringency.
The special strength of the Pacifies was due
to the transference of speculative profits from
other stocks, notably St. Paul, and to a con
viction of the great benefits to accrue from the
agreement to arbitrate the trouble with the
Canadian Pacific.
There was a yielding tendency in some of the
standard railroad bonds to-day, which was
possibly a reflection of the firmer tone in
money. Low priced speculative bonds, how
ever, showed sharp advances. Total sales $3 -
275.000.
Government bonds were unchanged.
Total sales of stocks to-day were 451,401

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Aug.- â Lower Liverpool , cables,
the continued liberal receipts in the northwest
and the weak sentiment carried over from yes
terday started Wheat lower. September, which
closed last night with buyers at 63% c, started
with sellers at from 62% c down to 62% c. Not
much could be secured at the lower figures, nor
could much be disposed of at the higher price
just then, but the , market soon improved and |
advanced to a shade above the price at , the
close on Wednesday,- reaching 63%@63Vic about
an hour after the start. The chief reason . for
the recovery from opening bearlshness was one
of long standing. - The shorts for September de
livery gave further expression to their = nerv- j
ousness concerning the very small quantity In |
Bight that was available for delivery on British
contracts. Trading In September was much
smaller than the j trade >in December, showing
that the trade: in September had been reduced
to slender proportions. Shorts' in September,
however, continued to take the offerings. on ail \
soft spots and â  at â  times were anxious â¢. enough j
to pay the sellers their asking price. The gen- .
eral * result : was 'â that t September a ruled â  strong I
after the first five minutes, and latterly at some |
Improvement on yesterday's closing values. De
cember, â â¢ however, â  did not â  advance correspond- |
ingly, although It recovered He from the initial
decline. A strong cash market at Duluth was
an additional bullish feature near the â  end,'
and the best prices here were made at the close. j

New York trade papers report the market for
dried fruit there dull on account of the abund
ance of fresh fruit, which deters dealers from
buying. The Commercial says: "Compara
tively little fruit is being bought on specu
lation, though the conditions Justify it. The
California crops are known to be short, and
Peaches and Apricots are failures. The can
nerÃ have taken everything possible. An in
teresting situation will probably develop later
on and prices will probably go much higher
than now thought."

Oakland Offloe San Francisco Call.
90S Broadwy, Aug. 25.
William Tucker Valentine, known to all
the Alameda school children asr "Grandpa
Billy," died suddenly at his home. 2252
Raiiroad avenue, Alameda, last night.
His' death was a great surprise to his
' legion of friends. He was universally
known by the young men and women
now married, who in their early days .at
tended the old Alameda School and the
High School, having had charge of the
building and grounds for the past thirty
years, and many times delighting In
:ing the youngsters In their amuse
ments.
. deceased weighed 260 pounds and his
death was due to fatty degeneration of
the heart. He was a native of Indiana
and nearly 60 years of ago. Last night
when he went to his room to retire he
laughed and joked, but before he disrobed
he screjuned for help, saying he was dy
ing; â¢ Drs. Keys a-nd Lubbock were sum
moned, but they could do nothing for
..him.
For the past twenty years deceased had
been tyler of Oak Grove Lodge No. 215,
â¢F. & A. M., under whose auspices the
. funeral will be held next Sunday after
noon. He was also a charter member of
Citizens' Hook and Ladder Truck, No. 1,
was Fire Chief in lhS3-*4. and a member
of the Exempt Firemen's Association of
California; also one of the early mem
i-.-rs of Howard Engine Company of San
Francisco.
He leaves a widow and one daughter,
Mrs. F. F. Hobbs of San Francisco. Hus
band and wife have lived apart for sev
eral years, and the property of the de
ceasedâa lot with a commodious home
â on itâ is left to his closeÃt and most inti
mate friend. Thomas J. White Jr., by
deed, which has been recorded. Mrs. Val
entine came over from San Francisco to
day and it is understood that there will
be litigation over the property, which is
valued at about $4000.
Mr. Valentine's mother was Mrs.
. Rachael Neal, who fought a bitter legal
.battle over the estate of her sister, Mrs.
Lemon, which it was claimed was ob
tained by Mrs. Mary Smith, the famous
"trumpet medium," who made use of her
powers over Mrs. Lemon to good ad
vantage.
. Deceased was a steadfast and sincere
. believer In Spiritualism and, according to
Thomas White Jr. he received a message
last Tuesday from the splritland warning
him of his approaching death. "We ware
seated in the front parlor," said Mr.
White to-day, "when all at once the
center table rose up from the floor and
came toward Billy. Of course we knew
that was a message and I inquired and
J.arned that it came from Billy's mother,
Mrs. Xeai. We did not discuss the mat
ter much, but we' both realized ihat some- :
thing was going to happen to Billy."

HARD PLAYS
IN RARD LUCK
A Justice Who Earns No
Salary in Office.
ALAMEDA'S MANY COURTS
FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH IS NOT
WORTH COLLECTING.
Next Year the Law Will Do Away
With an Office for Which
No Need Ever Ex*
isted.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 25.
Some surprise is shown In the Auditor's
| office that Justice Hard of Alameda
j should have any desire to continue in of-
I flee. Four months have passed away, and
j Justice Hard has not earned enough sal
ary to Justify him In filing a single state
ment. It is said that the #Uary of the
office does not produce $5 a month, yet the
Justice maintains a courtroom and is al
ways ready to do Judicial business in Ala
meda.
Under the law which will soon go into
effect the difficulty of having too many-
Judges across the estuary will be obvi
ated, as there will, be but one Justice of
the Peace. The new law declares that in
cities having a Recorder there shall not
be more than one Justice of the Peace.
Alameda now has a Recorder and
two Justices, and the salaries of all
three combined would not appear to make
the office worth seeking.
Justice Hard was appointed by the Su
pervisors several months ago. Prior to
his appointment the office had been prac
tically vacant, because the incumbent,
Judge Swasey, was lying sick at Fablola
Hospital. The income from the office for
the last fiscal year was under $40, so that
if Justice Hard be making, as is stated.
$5 a month, he is evidently doing much
more business than his predecessor.
In strong contrast to the predicament
of the Alameda Justices Is the Justice
Court of Oakland, for which the county
paid last year $4501 to the Justice and over
$3000 to the constable.

CONTROLLED BY
FEAR OF DEATH
Mrs. Cook's Big Estate
Is Saved to the Heirs.
SUPREME COURT DECIDES
SHE DEEDED EVEBYTHINO TO
HEB FB.IEND WHEN SICK.
Public Administrator Knight Will
Control the Property and At
tend to Its Distri
bution.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Ausr. 25.
After three years of litigation the Su
preme Court has handed down a decision
which finally closes the dispute over a
vast amount of property deeded, when in
fear of death, by Mrs. Cook three years
ago to her late husband's partner, Mr.
Tripp.
The principle involved in the case, which
has twice been to the Supreme Court, la
a very interesting one, as it establishes
a precedent regarding the deeding away
of property prior to death for the purpose
of preventing nrobate proceedings.
Three years ago Mrs. Cook and her hus
band and Mr. and Mrs. Tripp came to this
city from lowa, The husbands had been
partners in business, and on their retire
ment the two families decided to end their
days in California. Cook died soon after
their arrival, and Mrs. Cook, who had no
children and had lived for years apart
from her brothers and sisters in the East,
confided her business to the Tripps. She
was suffering from a severe illness and a
capital operation was declared to be the
only hope of saving her life. Fully realiz
ing that the cuances were greatly in fa
vor of her death Mrs. Cook sent for Mr.
Tripp and gave him a statement setting
forth how she wished her estate to be
distributed. She then transferred her
bank books to him, deeded over property
In Oakland, Berkeley and Los
and also transferred mortgages on prop
erty in lowa. In addition to this she gave
him a hill of sale upon her household
furniture and all other personal effects
of which she was possessed. The entire
estate thus placed in Tripp's hands
amounted in value to $40,000, over one
fourth of which was cash.
Three days after the operation wae per
formed Mrs. Cook died. Attomev Fred
Whitney, acting for Public Administrator
Knight, ascertaining that the deceased
had lef+ no will and applied for letters of
administration. They were granted and
a demand was then made on Tripp to
turn over all the property of the deceased
woman in his possession. Tripp replied
that there was no property belonging to
Mrs. Cook's estate, as it had all been
deeded to him. Tripp was then cited to
appear in court and was forced to tell
the- whole history of the proceedings. A
replevin suit was next brought to recover
all the personal property, including the
money in bank, which had been trans
ferred to Tripp's personal account. Judge
Ogden gave a Judgment for the Adminis
trator for $11,000. Tripp argued for a new
trial, which Judge Ogden granted. The
Public Administrator appealed from the
order granting the new trial and the Su
preme Court decided against the order,
thus establishing the original Judgment.
The attorneys for Tripp succeeded in get
ting the Supreme Court to hear the ar
gument for a new trial in bank, and the
result was to deny the order and re-es
tablish the original judgment of Judge
Ogden.
Another suit is now pending to recover
the real property, valued at 130.000. The
evidence in this case is the same as for
the personal property, and the attorneys
declare that the judgment will dÂ« against
Tripp. as the Supreme Court's decision
handed down yesterday, clearly sets
forth the law in the case.
LIEUTENANT BUTT
SEVERELY CENSURED
GETS A LETTER DEFINING HIS
DUTIES.
Informed That He Does Not Own the
Port of San Francisco and Must
Obey Orders Without
Question.
Lieutenant James O. Butt, command
ing the revenue cutter Golden Gate, re
ceived a stinging letter from Washing
ton yesterday which appears to settle the
question as to whether Mr. Butt is sub
ject to orders from the customs officials
or not.
Collector Jackson, Surveyor Spear and
Chief Deputy Chauncey St. John have
had frequent passages at arms with the
commander of the cutter. They were of
the opinion that it was for the use of
the customs service, while Mr. Butt held
that It waÃ for the use of the service
subject to certain rules laid down by him,
and he accordingly took orders when the
orders suited him. This caused so many
clashes that he was finally allowed to
have his own way, but complaints were
nevertheless sent to Washington. In re
turn Lieutenant Butt received the fol
lowing letter, which he will probably
have framed and placed where all may
read it:
Treasury Department, Office of Secretary,
Washington, D. C. Aug. 16, 1898.
Lieutenant James G. Butt, R. C. S., Com
manding IT. B. S. Golden Gateâ Sir: Herewith
are transmitted four letters received from the
collector of customs at San Francisco. You
will at once submit a full explanation as to
why you have declined to comply with the
written Instructions given you under date of
April 13, 18Â»8. In thÂ« meantime and from and
after the receipt hereof you will comply with
all Instructions given you In person or In writ-
Ing by the collector of customs. If In the
future you have any doubt as to your duty un
der the laws and regulations of the revenue
cutter service, you will ask for written orders
In the premises, obey the same without ques
tion, and then. If you have a protest to make,
submit the same to the department, with a full
explanation.
You are reminded that much complaint has
been made against you by the collector because
of your manner of performing duties as com
mander of the Golden Gate. There Is no pos
sible reason for past or existing friction as
between your command and the chief customs
officer In whose district you are serving, and
you are admonished that there must be no
more of It. You, therefore, will govern your
self with a view to rendering all possible aid
to the customs authorities and you will be
careful to work in harmony with the collector
to this end. W. B. HOWELL,
Assistant Secretary.
Many instances of Lieutenant Butt's
ignoring the orders of the Collector and
Surveyor of the Port are related, one of
which is that when recently ordered to
follow a steamer outside the heads to
prevent smuggled opium being passed
from the ship to a row boat. Lieutenant
Butt refused to do so, saying that it
would do no good and waste too much
coal. As a result the vessel got away,
and it is believed that the opium which
the officers vainly searched for was
thrown overboard and picked up by
"bay pirates," who work hand in glove
with the members of the crew.

A Boy Burglar.
Raymond Swett, a 16 year old boy,
who claims} to be a wood-turner from Ar

booked for burglary and carrying bur
glar's tools. S. H. Williams, the sexton

reading; in tbe library when he heard a
noise in the vestibule.- On investigation
he says he found Swett attempting to
break into a money box. Swett had
in his possession a "Jimmy,' a file, a
knife and a piece of wire. He claims
that he went Into the church to rest, and
had dropped 10 cents into the box. His
parents live in Los Angeles, and he is
visiting relatives here.

When the car arrived there the conduct

mind with another one of Celtic persua.

made the request, he stopped the car and
addressing himself to the daughter of j
Erin he said, "Go-off street!" She made
no response, and the deaf lady did not
hear the name of the street at which she
wished to alight, or else did not under- !
stand it as pronounced. Fixing a stern
look of offended dignity on the woman
for delaying the car, he repeated In a |
higher key, "Go-off street!" She now
realized that he was addressing her, and, I
arranging herself as If to take a firmer '.
grip on her seat, she gazed at the ex
asperated conductor and said In decided
accents, "I'll not go off. I've paid my
fare, and I am going to ride to the end
of the line." By that time the deaf lady
had made out that it was her street, and
she left the car. which proceeded on its

their visit, from an official and social
point of view.
CORBETT WILL SOON LEAVE.
The Ex-Champion Is Anxious to Get
Back East â McConnell and
Green Will Be Matched.
Jim Corbett will leave for New York on
Monday. The ex-champion cannot say
what his plans will be when he will ar
rive in the big Eastern city, but he will
doubtless make some arrangements "with
McCoy with a view of holding their pros
pective fight in the near future. ( Corbett
says that McCoy acted very manfully
concerning the postponement of their en
gagement, but as it is purely a matter
of business with him, he will try and
have the contest carried off according to
the original plans, excepting that the
time of the fight will necessarily be
changed to a later date. ,
/ The National Club signed Frank Me-
Connell last evening to fight George
Green in this city some time next month.
McConnell stipulates, however, : that
Green must - not weigh over 152 pounds,
and that if he should fail to meet that
weight when he weighs in he will have
to forfeit 75 per cent of the fighters 1 por
tion of the proceeds. Green could not
be found last evening, but as he ex
pressed great anxiety to fight any man
in his class, doubtless he will agree to
McConnell's terms, and that will mean
a warm contest between ; two clever fel
lows In the near future.

MRS. QTJACKENBUSH'S GLAjMS
Her Case Concluded and the Defense
Opens Monday.
The case of the plaintiff in the action of

McCarthy informed the father of the son s
arrest he asked him how It was that the
young man had repudiated his na jn e :
Quackenbush answered that he had had
some difficulty with his wife, and that she
left him and took the name of Dawson.
The son did the same. Other witnesses
were put on the stand and the case of the
plaintiff completed. The defendant ex
pects to break down the showing of the
plaintiff without difficulty, and many wit
nesses have been summoned to appear.

THE EIGHTH CALIFORNIA.
Will March Up Market Street
To- Morrow Afternoon and
Drill at Recreation Park.
The Eighth California Regiment, in I
command of Colonel Park Henshaw, will j
make Its flrst appearance in San Fran-
Cisco to-morrow afternoon, and that it !
will create a most favorable impression
there is not the least doubt, as it is â 
finely equipped and thoroughly drilled. It !
is composed of some of the best material
In Northern California. That the boys j
â will be given an enthusiastic reception is j
an assured fact.
At noon the regiment will arrive at the j
ferry from Oakland and march up Mar- !
ket street to Sixth, down Sixth to Fol- \
som and out Folsom to Recreation Park,
at Sixteenth street, where a drill will be i
given, beginning at 2:30. The programme |
arranged by Lieutenant Colonel Carring
ton embraces many Interesting features i
and maneuvers, among which is a street I
riot drill by the Third Battalion, Major
Forbes commanding. Captain Simpson's
Company <J of Alamcda will have an im
portant part, as will also Company C,
cnmmaniiHii by Captain Barnes. Nearly
the entire regiment will participate. A
review stand has been erected, and Gen
eral Miller and staff will review the regi
ment. All the colonels and staffs ot the
various commands will be in attendance;
also Governor Budd and staff. Music will
be furnished by Hie First Tennessee,
Twentieth Kansas and Eighth California
regimental bands. There will be ample
accommodations in the driveway for car
riages for all who df-sire to come in their

quested to bring small American flags.
A SERIOUS CHARGE.
Made by the Embezzling Com-
missary of the Twentieth
Kansas Regiment.
Commissary Sergeant James A. Young
of the Twentieth Kansas Raiment, who
was tried by a court-martial and con
victed of tho charge of embezzling com
missary stores and sentenced to one year's
imprisonment in the penitentiary at Fort
Leavenwortb. made his first statement
concerning the case yesterday, and if
what lie says ho true there has been an
awful miscarriage of military Justice com
mitted by the court that tried him.
Young claims that he disposed of the
commissary stores with the knowledge of
the officers and men of the regiment and
that the total .sum was invested in to
bacco for th? regiment. This he sold to
the officers and companies, each captain
being responsible for his company. Young
lias a statement prepared from his ac
counts, which shows that, with one ex
ception, no officer paid for any tobacco
purchased, and none of thÂ» companies
paid anything at all. Captain Hamilton
paid Young for the tobacco he ought
from him. and this Young says he has in
his possession, ready to turn over. The
amounts charged against the officers and
companies is $139 4.">, and Young's state
ments account for every cent of this. The
sergeant hints at a combination that was
at work in the regiment to ruin him. and
intimates that it so affected the court that
no effort was made to investigate the cor
rectnesses of his accounts or his state
ments of the affair.. He declares that the
blamf has not been settled upon the
proper person.
Events at the Presidio.
The Dewfl of the intended mustering out
of the volunteer regiments causes very
little disappointment amonc the men of
the regiments at the Presidio. As they
are not to see active service they are all
anxious to go home. In the opinion of
the best informed officers at the Presidio
the troops now mobilized upon this coast,
with the exception of the First Washing
ton, will be the last to be mustered out.
They declare thai from a point of econ
omy the (Jovernment cannot afford to
muster these regiments out until the
peace question ha.s been formally dis
posed of and the perplexing problem of
Hawaii solved. If troops shoum for some
reason be suddenly roc4Uired in hte Phil
ippines tuose now here would be hte most
readily available, and it is cheaper to
keep them here for a time than It would
be to bring them from more distant
points.
The Third Battalion of the Twenty
ihird Infantry and the Oregon recruits
attached will move over from Camp Mer
ritt to-day to the Presidio. This means
the last of the pest hole. The subsist
ence depot on Point Lobos avenue will
remain ther^ for the present.
There were no new cases of typhoid
fever sent to the Division Hospital yes
terday from the Seventh California Reg
iment. Major Choate said that of the
sixteen cases now there eleven are sus
pects, and he is unable to determine as
vet whether they are typhoid or some
other kind of fever. Two of the total
are malarial fever, and all of them were
getting along nicely yesterday.
Private Lynch. Company X, First
Washington Regiment, now lies in the
Post Hospital at the point of death. His
spine is injured find his intestines rup
tured as a result of falling down the
stairs in the barracks where his com.
I>any is quartered.
Private Anderson of the First Tennes
see was before the general court-martial
yesterday to be tried for having been
implicated in tifc attack upon Dan
Thomas. A number of men from the
Fifty-first lowa Regiment were exam
ined. The charge against Private
Scruggs of striking Thomas over the head
when he was in the custody of an officer
was quashed, as the charges failed to
Bpeclfy the time and place of the assault.
The court will be in session again to
day.

A MILE OF DEEP-WATER SHIPS.
There are more deep water vessels in the bay just now than there has been for months past. Five ships and
two barks arrived from foreign ports Wednesday night and yesterday, and nearly all anchored in the
stream to the north of the ferries. The ships Mayneld, E. Baggio, Thornliebank and Duchalburn are
coal-laden, the barks Inversnaid and Inverurie also have black diamonds aboard, while the barken tine
Archer is sugar laden from Honolulu. These, with the ship Santa Clara from Kodiak, make the biggest
arrival of deep water vessels within twenty-four hours this year.

CHARGED WITH MURDERING A BABE.
JOSEPH ROSSI, a Bootblack, Who, in a Fight With G. Annuzzi,
Accidentally injured a Child.
Joseph Rossi, a bootblack at Third and Mission streets, was arrested
at an early hour yesterday morning, and later was booked at the City
Prison on the charge of murdering a baby, 13 months old, the son of G.
Annuzzt, a bootblack living at 171 South Park.
Rossi had purchased the bootblack stand from Annuzzi about two
months ago, and Annuzzi soon afterward made overtures to Rossi to get
back the stand without success. On the night of August S Annuzzi, car
rying his baby boy In his arms, was passing the stand and he stopped to
talk with Rossi. A quarrel ensued and Annuzzi- drew a razor out of his
pocket and Slashed Rossi on the shoulder. Rossi grabbed one of the feet
rests and nrade a swipe at Annuzzi, missing him and striking the babe on
the base of the skull. Charles McCarthy, 735 Mission street, saw the brawl
and rushed In between the combatants, receiving a cut on the hand from
Annuzzi's razor.
Annuzzi was arrested by Policemen Tyrrell and T. C. Murphy and
booked at the City Prison on two charges of assault with a deadly weapon.
He was released on bonds the following day. On August 15 Annuzzi had
Rossi arrested for assault with a deadly weapon, as Dr. ISercndt, who had
been called in to attend the baby, expressed the opinion that it was suffer
ing from a fracture at the base of the skull and might die. These cases
are still pending in court. ,
The baby became unconscious and four other physicians were sum
moned by the anxious parents to consult with Dr. Berendt, but their com
bined skill was unavailing and the baby died early .yesterday morning.
The police were notified and Rossi, who was out on bail, was arrested.
The body of the babe was taken to the Morgue and Dr. Gallagher
made an autopsy on it and be found that death was due to pneumonia
and not to a fractured skull. He found a contusion at the base of the
skull, but no fracture. It Is probable that when Dr. Gallagher gives his
evidence in court the charge of murder will be withdrawn.

NOW BE FIXED
Inqueston Mrs. Paxton's
Remains To-Day.
RECOVERED FROM THE BAY
MISFORTUNE ATTENDED THE
DAWSON CITY.
Ban Out of Coal in Midocean, Next
She Broke Down, and Finally
Was Mistaken for a Span
ish Pirate.
The remains of Mrs. Charles E. Paxton
were recovered from the bay yesterday
morning. The body came to the surface
off Mission-street wharf, and, therefore,
had not moved a great distance from
where the Scandia's launch went down
last Wednesday week. The launch, it will
be remembered, was backing out from the
slip between Broadway and Pacific street
wharves when the Government steamer
McDowell, on her way from Alcatraz,
struck and sunk her. The supposition is
that the undertow, caused by the com
ing and going of the ferry steamers, car
ried the body along in a southerly direc
tion.
Early yesterday morning the mate ot
the American ship Santa Clara engaged
George Price, a. boatman, to take him
out to his vessel, which was lying in the
stream. When midway between the Mis
sion and Howard-street wharves they
saw the body of a woman floating face
upward in the bay. After making a rope
fast to the remains, Price towed it to
the Folsom-street float and notified the
Coroner. All the unfortunate woman's
jewelry was intact with the exception of
her earrings. The crabs and fish had
destroyed the lobes of her ears, and, of
course, the earrings disappeared.
The inquest over the remains will be
heard this morning, and the chances are
that Some insight will be obtained into
the cause of the disaster. Among those
who have been subpoenaed are Mate
Peter Grimm and Deckhands Jacob Jen
sen and Alec Riehter of the McDowell,
and Captain Hart. Mate Thompson and
Nat Messer Jr. of the Scandia's party,
and Captain Richardson of the steamer
Sunol.
Mrs. Paxton's body was, by tho courtesy
of the Coroner, removed to Gray's under
taking parlors ajid will be cremated to
day.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
Moana arrived from Sydney, Auckland,
Apia and Honolulu last Wednesday night
with 117 cabin and 110 steerage passen
gers. She was late getting in. owing to
having been caught in a heavy storm
between Sydney and Auckland, and also
through the breaking of a water main in
Honolulu, which delayed her in getting
water. The Moana was six days and one
hour from Honolulu, beating the Belgic'a
time by forty-three minutes. The Moana
brought up |1,660,000 in treasure from
Australia, representing the balance of
trade In favor of the United States.
The Moana brings the news that the
schooner Wing and Wing from San Fran
cisco arrived at Apia, Samoa, July t %,
and sailed again for this port on Au
gust 5.
The gold hunters who went north from
here on the steamer Dawson City ha% r e
had a hard time of it. Their vessel was not
what she was cracked up to be and
never fulfilled the expectations of her
trial trip. At no time did she develop
any speed, and it took thirty-five days
to make a voyoge that ought to have
been covered in ten or twelve days. A
private letter from one of the passen
gers, dated at Dutch Harbor, says the
rudder is too small, and the vessel
almost impossible to keep on her course
in consequence. When fourteen days out
from San Francisco the coal was all
burned up, and for seven days every
body aboard was wondering whether or
not they would ever see land again.
After a great deal of maneuvering
enough sail was got on the Dawson City
to give her steerage way, and finally Ko
diak Island was made. All hands and
the cook were sent ashore to cut fire
wood, and after some hard work suffi
cient was obtained to carry th" steamer
to Wood Island, where a supply of coal
and water was obtained from the North
American Trading and Transportation
Company's agc-nt.
Three days out from Wood Island the
Dawson City broke down, and as a storm
was coming up, the captain decided to
put into Halibut bay on Walibut Island.
This spot is leased by the McCollom
Fishing and Trading Company, and the
fislK-rmen. having beard of the war, at
(â net- sÂ«t tho gold hunters down for â 
band -if Spanish pirates. When they at
tempted to land they were met by an
armed force, and Messrs. Rosendorg and
ftiockel were in such a hurry to get back
to the Dawson City that they capsized
their boat and were nearly drowned. It
was only by displaying Old Glory that
tho fishermen realized that it was their
countrymen they were attacking. Ros
endorg' n:id Mockel swiim to a rock, and
it was only after a great deal of trouble
and at some personal risk that Captain
Bruce got them off.
After repairing damages ana laying in
a stock or halibut the Dawson City sailed
for Dutch Harbor, which <.y;.p finally
reached, thirty-five days out from San
Francisco. The company on the steam
er does not expect to do any mining, but
will dredge the many bars in the Yukon
Ri\>r for gold. â  '
Tho transports Australia. City of Syd
ney and City of Peking are going back
on* their old runs. The Sydney is being
got ready for a voyage to Panama, the
Australia for Honolulu and the Peking;
for China. Tho other transports as they \
arrive will be returned to their various
owners.
E. L. Colnon, president of the State
Hoard of Harbor Commissioners, re
turned from a trip to Puget Sound yes
terday. He sailed from here on the ship
K. p. Rice and was down on the articles
as an "A. B." He came back on the,
Walla Walla as n cabin passenger. Life
before the mast evidently did not agree [
with him. Mr. Colnon says he had a
most enjoyable trip up tho coast on the
Rico and returns to work feeling ten
years younger for his outing.
George 1... Rowland, the chief engineer
of the steamer Emma. Is back from a
hunting trip. His friends will be revel
ing in venison and bear steaks for a
week to come, as George's trusty Win
chester brought down eight full grown
bucks and two cinnamon bears. Mr.
Rowland is a great pedestrian, but
nevertheless the tramping after those
eight door was a little too much for him
and yesterday he went to Southern Cali
fornia to recuperate.
The Alaska Packers Association has
been given the use of Folsom street
wharf for the season. The salmon pack
Is expected to be a good one this season
and tho bulk of it will be handled at
that wharf. The ship Santa Clara, the

GATTRELL'S STORY CORROBORATED
Raymond Miller, His Fellow
Clerk, Remembers the Candy
Store Incident
The Accused Woman Engages CounselâRela
tives and Friends Hurrying to Her
Assistance,
Raymond Miller, junior clerk In â¢
the Wave Candy Store at Stockton, â 
corroborates QattreH's story of the â 
strange woman who bought candy
from him three weeks ago and sub- â 
stituted some bonbons she had with â 
.her for Fome of those in the box.
Miller will probably go to the City â 
Prison to-day, and will be given â 
an opportunity to identify Mrs. â¢
Bntkln, the suspected poisoner. A â 
numbor of other women will be
present and Miller will be brought
Into the room and asked to point
out the woman who bought the
candy.
Dr. Stone of Stockton has made a
statement concerning Mrs. Botkin's
demeanor while she was hysterical.
Chief Lees has the statement, but it
Is not given out for publication.
George A. Knight will defend the
suspected poisoner.
As soon as Detective McVey of
Delaware arrives with the wrapper
which inclosed the poisoned candy
and the note which was Inside the
box, experts in chirography will be
called upon to make comparison be
tween the address and the hand
writing of Mrs. Botkin. A dispatch
from Dover says David N. Car
valho, the world-famed writing ex
pert, will accompany McVey to this
city.
It is hinted that the police are
taking special precautions against
Mrs. Hotkin taking her own life.
. A late dispatch from Dover says
that J. P. Dunning admits that he
has identified the writing in the
anonymous letters received by his
wife, and this taken in conjunction
with the fact that Mrs. Botkin was
arrested mainly on his evidence is
considered as likely to weigh very
heavily against the imprisoned
lady.
." Raymond Miller, a boy now living in
Stockton, may prove an important wit
ness in the case in connection with the
statement of Frank J. Gattrell, clerk in
.the Wave candy-store.
.- The boy was brought to the city last
night and an attempt was made through
the telephone to get Chief Lees to allow
him to visit the prison, with the object
of seeing if he could identify Mrs. Botkin
as the woman he saw in the candy-store.
The Chief objected strongly to the propo
sition, on the ground that It would not
be a fair test to take the boy into the
. room with only Mrs. Botkin and himself
â present.
He urged that the test should be de
layed until to-day, when Mrs. Botkin
would be dressed in street costume, which
â¢would be just to all concerned. The Chief
insisted, and the test will be made some
time to-day.
In regard to Gattrell, the Chief does not
intend to bring him here to Identify Mrs.
Botkin until the box that contained the
poisoned candy is received from Dover, j
QattreH will be first shown the box, and
if it is the one he handed to the lady in
. the latter part of July Its identification
â¢ might assist him in positively saying
whether or not Mrs. Botkin is the woman
â In question.
..Raymond Miller is the 16-year-old son
of. E. G. Miller, the real estate man, re
.â¢ siding at 406 Kast â arket street, Stock
;ton. and has been employed at the Wave
in. the latter city a little over a year.
For the past few days he ard his
mother have been visiting friends at 669
East Twenty-fourth street, East Oak
-land. He read the story of the Dun
ning poisoning case yesterday and that
part referring to the circumstances sur
rounding the purchase of the chocolates
at the Wave attracted his particular at
tention and called to mind this special
instance. v
"As soon as Raymond saw this in the
pap^r he discussed the matter with me,"
said Mrs. Miller last evening. "He be
came quite interested in it and told me
he remembered the purchase referred to.
While he is not certain that he could
identify â¦he woman should he see her |
again, we are willing to do everything
in our power that will lead to an identi- j
flfcation and will tend to bring the guilty
â¢ party to justice."
The boy's story runs as follows: "about
two or three weeks ago a lady dropped in
at the Wave and called for some choco
lates. Mr. Gattrell waited on her. She
had some other candy in a small bag and
wished Mr. Gattrell to arrange them in
a box such as we usually do chocolates
up in. Mr. Gattrell told her that we are
not in the habit of putting up other peo
ple's candy in the Wave's boxes, but she
urged him and he sent me to get several
ordinary bonbon boxes. One of these Mr.
Ga.ttrf'll selected and did up the package
to accommodate her. She left and we said
nothing more about it, and I would .never
again have thought of it, had I not seen
the articles referring to it in the papers."

cused woman was In the city, has
made a statement to Chief of Police Gall
which, it is believed, has an important
bearing on the guilt or innocence of the
woman. Dr. Stone was closeted with the
Chief some time, and it is said that the
officer took down his statement very care
fully and forwarded it to Chief Lees by
the first mail. Chief Gall refused to talk
of the matter, saying it Would do no
good and might do harm. Dr. Stone said
to a Call reporter to-day:
"I regret exceedingly that I have been
dragged into this case. I assure you it
I was not of my own volition. Tuesday
evening I was passing the jail on my
way home, and noticing the commotion
went over to ascertain the cause. I saw
Mrs. Botkin in the corridor, a prisoner.
Knowing her hysterical condition and
that she had the morphine compound I
privately informed the jailer to watch
out for It. aDd. of course. It soon became
known that I had been her physician.
"I am free to say that I have an opin
ion of the guilt or Innocence of the ac-
People Who Are Trying to Unravel the Dunning Poisoning Mystery,
cused woman. I have no occasion to
withdraw this statement, but to say upon
what grounds I form this opinion would
be a breach of professional honor I would
not consider for a minute. If my state
ment to Chief Gall Is of any value all
right. What I said i.Â« safe with him.
But it would be unprofessional and out
rageous for me to express opinions on
the characters of my patients. I have
no objection to stating that Mrs. Botkin
was suffering from hysteria and nervous
prostration. The prescription which I
gave her is one for that trouble, as any
physician will readily recognize."
"Hysterical women sometimes talk a
great deal, do they not. doctor?"
"Yes. but remember this has no bearing
upon the condition of Mrs. Botkin. Fur
ther than this I have nothing to say."
The late Dr. Luke Robinson was Mrs.
Botkin's physician for many months, and
it is said he probably knew more of her
temperament and characteristics than
any other man.
Chief Gall and his officers are engaged
in making a careful search through the
registers kept by the drug stores for
poison purchases. The detectives refuse
to discuss their day's work. If they can
discover Mrs. Botkin's signature or even
one which she used as an alias the evi
dence will at once show where the poison
was purchased, and also her handwrit
ing about the time she addressed the
package of poison.
Young Gattrell stated to The Call cor
respondent this afternoon that the more
he thought over the event of the strange
woman the more he was convinced of
the correctness of his statements of yes
terday. When asked if he was sure he
could identify her he said he could not tell
till he was brought face to face with
her. Her appearance might recall some
characteristic by which he could make
a positive identification.
Gattrell says he put the candy in loose,
mixing that which she brought to the
store and that which he sold her. He
says he is reasonably positive he can
Identify the box.
Proprietor Kuhn has none of the class
of boxes on hand at present which Gat
trell sold to thfc strange woman. They
were made for him some time last Feb
ruary by Flelshhacker & Co., 620 Market
street, San Francisco, and he has sent
to the firm for a duplicate of the stock
In order to assist the officers in their in-
. vestlgations.
His conclusions of the dimensions of the
box arrived at, from comparison with
another the same size, but of different
stock, are as follows: Length S%, breadth
3*4, depth 1 13-1G inches. The boxes also
had a peculiar lace paper on the inside
for folding- over the candy, and this will
assist in the identification.
Beverly Botkin is completely crushed
by the calamity which has come upon his
family, and the efforts of his friends to
persuade .him to take a hopeful view of
the situation have been futile.
THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 26, 1898.
THE ANONYMOUS LETTERS IDENTIFIED
A Strong Link in the Evidence That Is Being Forged
Aronnd the Defiant Woman in the City Prison.
DOVER, Del., Aug. 25.â Attorney General "White to-day talked freely
on the main evidence in his possession of Mrs. Botkin's guilt. Among
other things he divulged was an important link in John P. Dunning's
statement to him, which had hitherto been a secret jealously guardedâ
Dunning's reason for picking Mrs. Botkin from the many women with
whom he had intimate relations in San Francisco as the one that unques
tionably sent the box of poisoned chocolates which killed his wife and his
sister-in-law.
"Dunning," said the Attorney General, "made a clean breast of every
thing to me. He held nothing back. He was as sincere as he could
be in his desire to bring the fiendish murderess to justice. The moment
he was shown the anonymous letters that were sent from San Fran
cisco to Mrs. Dunning, telling her that her husband was paying promis
cuous attention to women there, he recognized the handwriting and
Â§aid it was that of Mrs. Botkin. We had already been on her trail and
that statement from Dunning made us doubly confident, for it was the
first piece of sure evidence we had obtained against her. In a like man
ner Dunning identified the writing on the wrapper of the box and note
inclosed. He had received many letters from her, letters so teeming
with love and terms of affection that he could never forget the hand
writing. Unfortunately, he did not have any of Mrs. Botkin's letters
to him in his possession at the time, all of them having been destroyed.
He expects that when his delayed mail is forwarded to him from Porto
Rico it will contain several of her letters. These he will turn over
for use In the trial."
CLAIM TO HAVE
STRONG EVIDENCE
A Fear in Dover That Mrs.
Botkin Will Commit Sui
cide.
DOVER, Del., Aug. 25.â Attorney Gen
eral White. to-night sent to San
Francisco the requisition papers for Mrs.
Botkin, who Is under arrest there,
charged with the poisoning of Mrs. Dun
ning and Airs. Define by means of candy
sent through the mail.
The affidavit to secure the papers was
sworn to by ex-Congressman Pennlng
ton, the father of the two poisoned
women, and the papers charge Mrs. Bot
kin with murder in the first degree.
Before leaving here for Georgetown to
night Attorney General White said:
1 "We have the murderess and we have
evidence that no defense can shatter. Tne
only thing we fear is Mrs. Botkin's, seÂ«-
destruction."
It is stated here that Detective Witsil
and a police matron will go West to
bring Mrs. Botkln here. The California
witnesses will not be summoned to Dela
ware until the trial is called, but their
affidavits will be taken at San Francisco.
The trial will probably bo called in Oc
tober.
WILL NOT FIGHT
EXTRADITION
Attorney George A. Knight
Will Defend the Accused
Poisoner.
Mra. W. A. Botkln. the suspected pois
oner, has employed George A. Knight as
attorney. Mr. Knight returned from the
Republican State Convention yesterday
morning and at his office he found a mes
sage from the accused woman, asking
him to take charpe of her case. He im
mediately dispatched a note to Mrs. Bot
kin, informing her that he would call at
the City Prison at the earliest possible
moment. Knight is an old friend of Mrs.
Botkin's familyâ the Browns of Ferndale,
Humboldt County.
The attorney went to the city prison late
yesterday afternoon and had a long con
sultation with his fair client. He was
ushered Into the matron's room, where
Mrs. Botkin is incarcerated, and remained
talking with her nearly two hours. After
leaving Mrs. Botkln Mr. Knight had a
short talk with the prison officials, and
asked them to protect the prisoner from
interviewers and curious Individuals and
to frustrate any scheme to secure a state
ment from her by any underhanded trick.
A peremptory order was immediately
given to the sergeant at the desk, who
books and assigns prisoners to the several
ceils, to obey the request of Mr. Knight
and not place any other female prisoner
who might be arrested In the cell with
the alleged murderess. The Jailer was also
instructed to prevent any outsiders iram,
approaching the door from the corridor
to the room where Mrs. Botkin is con
fined.
When asked what legal steps would be
taken in behalf of Mrs. Botkin her attor
ney said: "Nothing can or will be done
until the Delaware officer arrives in San
Francisco with requisition papers for Mrs.
Botkin. No legal steps to secure her free
dom or release on bonds will be taken for
a few days at least. Mrs. Botkin is in the
hands of the law and is perfectly satisfied
to remain there. She has nothing to fear.
"All I know about the case nas been
obtained from perusing the newspapers,
and as I have been at Sacramento all the
week attending the Republican State Con
vention, I have not followed the story
very closely. However, I am satisfied
that the accused woman Is Innocent of
the charge against her. I have known
her family for years, although I never
met her until to-day. Her parents live
in Ferndale and are highly respected by
all who know them. Her three sisters are
all most estimable women. The parents
are quite well-to-do.
"My client has acted wisely In refusing
to grant interviews to reporters, and I
have advised her to maintain strict si
lence, so far as the newspapers are con
cerned. My reason for silencing my
client is based on the presumption that
the Delaware authorities have what they
consider strong evidence connecting: her
with the tragedy. Were it otherwise
her arrest would not have been ordered.
"Now, I assume it is more than likely
Mrs. Botkin will be taken to Dover for
trial, and as all the newspapers contain
ing references to this case are sent to
the State's attorneys it would be unwise
for the accused to grant any Interviews.
I know, of course, that the newspapers
endeavor to be fair and just In these
cases, but discrepancies and mistakes
will occur and, while not materially af
fecting the result of a trial, they cause
a vast deal of trouble. If the papers
were full of interviews written by differ
ent reporters, although corresponding in
substance, the shading of sentences
would involve the accused In an endless
cross-examination. The prosecuting at
torney would read the statements, note
all inconsistencies 'and demand an expla
nation from the defendant. The publi
cation of all Mrs. Botkin could say in
reference to this terrible double crime
would not incriminate her, but to save
time, trouble and expense for myself and
herself I must forbid any further news
paper interviews.
'"The laws of Delaware are most string
ent and the methods and practices of the
courts diverge widely from ours, and
when I go back there to defend Mrs. Bot
kin. which I shall probably do, I do not
want to become involved In any technical
controversies during the trial, if it ever
takes place,
"There will be no technical fight at this
end. If the requisition papers are all
right Mrs. Botkin will consent to return
with the officer to Delaware. "We will
not begin habeas corpus or any other
proceedings which will delay the speedy
termination of the case.
"Mrs. Botkin has 1 told the police the
story of her life, giving all incidents and
details in full. Nothing she has said can
be construed into evidence against her."
Attorneys McGowan & Squires of this
city will assist Mr. Knight.
Mrs. Botkin's brother-in-law and sister
will arrive here to-day from Ferndale.
They telegraphed to friends Wednesday
to do everything possible for the pris
oner's comfort until they reached here.
t.Tba suspected woman has plenty of
money and her husband gave orders to
a restaurant to supply her meals in tne
City Prison.
Mr. Kotkin returned to Stockton yes
terday afternoon.
HAS REGAINED
HER COMPOSURE
Mrs. Botkin Is the Star Board-
er at the City Prison.
Mrs. Botkin dropped her tragedy queen
airs yesterday and came down to the
realities of everyday life. She addressed
her jailers like twentieth century men and
put aside the hallucination that they were
her vassals and retainers. The luckless
garcon to whom fell the task of bringing
to the prisoner her morning meal got a
gratuitous dose of the emotional wrath
that survived a night spent in the City
Prison.
"Boy," said Mrs. Botkin, with the air
and the deep bass of a barnstorming Lady
Macbeth, "you are five minutes late. Let
it be understood that I am not to be kept
waiting one moment beyond the appointed
time; otherwise I shall have to give my
orders to some other restaurant."
The boy trembled, the lady waved him
aside and then sat down to her breakfast.
Mrs. Botkln has made herself perfectly
at- home, and as comfortable as her
cramped quarters will permit. Yesterday
afternoon she was seen in a white siiK
peignoir, the loose folds of which half dis
played yet half concealed the lines of ncr
rather too plump figure. The sleeves,
which reached only to the shoulder,
showed *to advantage the rounded con
tours of perfectly modeled arms, on which
gleamed bracelets brilliant with precious
stones. She spent the better part of the
day in the matron's sitting-room, and
rocked incesantly in the shabby little
cane-seated chair. Her pose was what
L>elsartian disciples would call "artlessly
negligent," with the white arms encir
cling her head, which was thrown well
over the back of the low-backed chair.
Mrs. Botkin has attained the dignity of
a star at the City Prison. All day long
;l line of morbidly curious women sought
admission to the prisoner. Some came in
sympathy, some to give advice and still
others impelled by the law they rail
"women for women." However, the ma
jority brutally admitted that curiosity
alone brought them there. All were ae
nied admittance.
Mrs. Botkln still adheres to her resolu
tion not to be interviewed. It is her de
clared intention never again to see or
speak with a press representative, and her
Jailers maintain that they have every rea
son to believe she will stand by her word.
The Letter From Dunning.
What shall be done with the letter in
transit from Dunning to Mrs. Botkin on
its arrival here is a problem that is puz
zling the Chief of Police.
The Chief declines to say what action
he will take, but it is supposed that the
solution of tne problem will rest with the
postal authorities.
In ordinary cases a letter could not be
intercepted and opened, but in a case
where the interests of justice would be
subserved, such as the probaonity of giv
ing a clew to a poisoner, it is a question
whether the courts could not be resorted
to in order to have such a letter inter
cepted and opened.
The letter is about due now, and its
final disposition will be watched with the
keenest interest.
COMES FROM A
GOOD FAMILY
Mrs. Botkin's Parents Are
Highly Respected Citi
zens of Ferndale.
HEALDSBURG, Aug. 25.â Mrs. Bot
kin's parents, Colonel Richards Brown
and wife, 76 and 75 years of age respec
tively, have been for twenty years or
more highly respected residents of Fern
dale, Humboldt County. Colonel Brown
is a native of Tennessee and acquired his
military title in the Missouri State mili
tia during the Mexcan War. He was a
pioneer of Nebraska and was the founder
of Brownsville in that State, which was
named in hia honor. He was a banker
and merchant in Brownsville, and was a
member of the Nebraska Territorial Leg
islature. Colonel Brown came to Cali
fornia twenty-three years apo. He is
the father of seven daughters and one
son, Mrs. Botkin being the fourth daugh
ter. The son. A. C. Brown, was at
tached to General Dodges headquarters
at Omaha during the rebellion. Three
of Mrs. Botkin's sisters live with the
old folks in Ferndale, one married sister
lives in New York, one in Kansas City
and her eldest sister, Mrs. McClure, is a
resident of Healdsburg. Mr. and Mrs.
McClure are highly respected residents of
this city and feel deeply the trouble and
notoriety that has been brought upon the
family. Mrs. McOlure returned a few
weeks ago from a visit to her aged par
ents and was met at St. Helena a few
days after her return, on August 4, by
Mrs. Botkin, who had come from San
Francisco, after repeated invitations, to
pay her sister a visit. They drove over
to Healdsburg on Sunday, August 7. and
It was in her sister's home in Healds
burg that Mrs. Uotkin first learned
through the city papers that she was
suspected of being connected with Mrs.
Dnnning's death.
Lived at Kansas City.
KANSAS CITY, Aug. 25.-Mrs. Ada Bot
kin, the woman under arrest in San

of pAsoned candy which caused the'

where he had amassed a small fortune.
He became connected with tho MiÃSOun
Valley Bank and remained with that in
stitution for several years. Later he en
gaged in the grain business in a small
way. He was never an operator on the
Board of Trade, at least none of the old

cents in stamps on the wrapper.
postal rules forbid the transmission o<
candy through the mails unless it is
tame"d in tin boxes, and the ass
knew this, and to prevent the package
being opened by an inspector it was sent
as first class matter. Chief LÂ»-os thinks
the 25-cent handkerchief was placed In
the box to deceive the postal authorities
if the box was opened a*nd not examined
closely.
No Clue at the Postoffice.
The postoffice authorities, in a quiet
way have been attempting to assist the
police in ascertaining in what part of
the city, if at all. the poisoned bonbons
were mailed. Most of the carriers have
been interrogated, but no information of
value has been obtained. It Is pretty
generally conceded by the officers that
the package was mailed at the general
postoffice or at one of the sub-stations.
The box of candy is supposed to have
been put in the mail about August 3 or
4, about the time Mrs. Botkin left San
Francisco for Healdsburg, and had the
package been taken up from any of the
boxes the carrier would doubtless have
some slight recollection of the matter.
Officers have visited many of the drug
stores in the locality where Mrs. Bot
kin roomed, but were unable to obtain
any clews. Druggists keep a record of
the purchases or poison, and thus far,
it is said, no incriminating evidence has
been discovered. Many of Mrs. Botkin's
acquaintances have been questioned by
the police as to whether she had inquired
as to the effects of poison. It Is more
than probable, though, that the person
who so skillfully planned and executed the
horrible murders was cunning enough to

In the vicinity of The Victoria, on Cali

resided from the time she left 927 Geary

borg, is a drug store. The poison record
kept by the proprietor shows that not a
single "pale of arsenic has been made
since last November.
Anxious About Her Mail.
Additional light has been thrown on
Mrs. Botkin's private life at The Victoria
l :omas Kida, a well-educated Japan
?ie, who Is a graduate of a San
soo business college. Speaking of
uter last evening he said:
B. Botkin lived at The Victoria
I was employed there. She had a
stove in her room, on which she
COOlted her meals. Frequently she tipped
m<> to run errands. She received consid
erable mail. Almost every other day a
letter or two would come from Florida
and in these she was particularly inter
ested, and if for any cause they were
not received when expected she would
send me downstairs to the mail box sev
eral times during the day. Once she told
me that the letters were from her cousin
who was one of the crew on the battle
ship New York.
"In a little room adjoining I frequent
ly found empty whisky bottles. She re
ceived very few visitors, one of whom
was a young lady about 25 years old,
medium build and of dark complexion.
When her son, who was about 14 years
old, came to live with her she stopped
receiving company.
"She was absent from the house the
latter part of July for two or three days,
but between July 28 and August 3 or 4
she was in her rooms every day.
"I am positive that I never saw any
candy or candy boxes or poisonous drugs
in her apartments. She was quite tallca
tive but never mentioned anything about
her husband or acquaintances. To my
knowledge she did not make any home
made candy tn her rooms, and she never
gave me any letters or packages to mail."
Kida is an intelligent Japanese, and
readily told his story in good English.
He seemed to entertain a very high re
gard for Mrs. Botkin because, as he said,
she frequently gave htm a quarter for
running errands.
Besieged by the Curious.
Several ineffectual attempts were madÂ©
last "evening 1 to see Mrs. Botkin, and as a
final resort Chief Lees was appealed to.
The Chief positively declined to be a
party to forcing any one into her pres
ence, and Captain Seymour, who is in
charge of the prison, also turned a deaf
ear to all requests of a similar nature.
"Attorney Knight." said the captain,
"gave me positive instructions after his
interview with Mrs. Botkin that on no ac
count should any one be permitted to see
her, and I shall respect his instructions.
Some one awoke Mrs. Botkin about 2
o'clock this morning, demanding to see
her, and both she and her husband com
plained bitterly to the Chief and myself
