yesterday between President Mc-
Kinley and a United States Sen
ator, I am informed, on the au
thority of the Senator, that the
President has apparently signi
fied his approval of the policy of
selling the Philippines. More
over, it was developed during the
conversation that at the proper
time a measure to this effect
would be introduced in the
Senate.
This Senator stated that Japan
had already offered $200,000,000
for the islands, and, though au
thority for this statement was not
forthcoming, the Senator said
that it was semi-official.
He favored, if such a thing

OBJECT LESSON IN
FEDERAL OWNERSHIP,
Found in the Telegraph Lines in the
Islands of Porto Rico
and Cuba.
WASHINGTON. Dec. B.â The situation
in Porto Rico promises to force on this
Government, for a time at least, the ex
periment of Federal ownership of tele
graph and telephone lines. The War De
j artment ; now controls all lines in Porto
Rico and in the evacuated sections of
Cuba. In both places the lines are being
repaired, and the Government is handling
commercial messages after Government
matter. The signal service in charge of
this work says it is too soon to draw con
clusions as tp the expense of the service,
as the cost for maintenance and long-de
layed repairs in just now more than the
Income from the lines. But in six months
from the Ist of January the signal service
expects to be able to furnish some inter
esting data as to the profit in the insular
wire service. This enforced object lesson
In Federal management is naturally ex
pected to have considerable influence in
the agitation for like control in this
Country.

it was stated, would not probably
be introduced during this session
of Congress, but would be ma
turely considered pending the
military regime, which would
continue until the meeting of the
Fifty-sixth Congress.
It was urged that the holding
of the Philippines by the United
States would only demonstrate
the inconsistency of this country
in insisting upon the Monroe

would keep the doctrine intact,
preserving the Western Hemis

that this proposition would com

ASK AN INVESTIGATION

Petition Presented to the House and
Senate From Archbishops of the
Catholic Church.
WASHINGTON, Dec. B.â Cardinal Gib
bons, In behalf of himself and the Arch
bishops of the Catholic church in Ameri
ca, has submitted a petition to Congress
asking that the question of the contract
school system be reopened and that Con
gress again go over the whole subject of
Indian education. The petition sets forth
at length the history of the Indian school
question and the legislation applying to
it up to the recent provisions In a bill
looking to the gradual discontinuance of
Government aid to sectarian schools.
The petition asks that a Congressional

SUPPORT OF MILITARY AND
NAVAL ESTABLISHMENTS
Passage of the Urgent Deficiency
Bill Practically Without Op
position.
WASHINGTON, Dec. B.â The urgent de
ficiency bill to provide for the support of
the military' and naval establishments was
passed by the House to-day, practically
without opposition. A fear had been ex
pressed that the measure might open up
a prolonged debate upon the conduct of
the war, but the Democratic leaders de
cided that such a debate would properly
come later upon the regular appropria
tion bills or upon the bill for the reorgan
ization of the army. There was not a
word of criticism of the war during the
debate. The only point upon which an
Issue was raised to-day was as to whether
the bill, providing, as it does, for the pay
of the volunteers until July 1, 1899, might
not be construed as a modification of the
law under which the volunteers were mus
tered into service.
McÃae of Arkansas offered an amend
ment providing that it should not be so
construed, and upon it there was a gen
eral discussion as to the advisability of
mustering out the volunteers before the
regular army was increased.
Cannon finally accepted the McÃae
amendment, and that removed the only
shadow of opposition to the bill. A num
ber of amendments were adopted upon
the recommendation of the Appropria
tions Committee, which received soma
supplemental estimates after the bill was
prepared. The largest of these was an
item of $3,000,000 for an emergency fund
for the War Department, $578,000 for thÂ«Â»
Ordnance Department, increasing th*>
amount carried by the bill to $rt&,859.592.

The House adjourned over until Mon

to work without interruption.

BANKRUPTCY LAW UPHELD.
But Judge Seaman Divests State
Courts of Jurisdiction.
MILWAUKEE, Dec. B.â Judge Seaman
upholds the Federal bankruptcy law and
declares In an opinion filed to-day that It
divests the State courts entirely of the
jurisdiction in insolvency cases. Judge
Sutherland of the Superior Court held a
few days ago that he had exclusive juris
diction of insolvency proceedings com
menced before him before the commence
ment of the proceedings in the Federal
courts. Judge Seaman declares that the
State courts are absolutely without juris
diction in such matters.
TREATY IS
READY FOR
SIGNING
It Adheres Strictly to
the Protocol Pro
posals.
TOOK LONGER THAN THE WAR
Spaniards Embittered and Crest
fallen Over the Results
of Their Work.
Fpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Dec. B.â The United States
and Spanish Peace Commissioners con
cluded their work to-day and finally
settled the terms of tire treaty of peace.
They will meet once more in formal
session on Saturday or Monday next,
wh^n the Spanish Commissioners, sor
rowfully, and the Americans, with feel
ings of relief, will write their signatures
upon the document which embodies the
results of the war and the preparation
of which has consumed eleven weeks,
a longer time than the war itself. In
the meantime the treaty will be en
grossed under the supervision of Mr.
Moore and Senor Ojeda, the secretaries
of the respective commissions.
The Spaniards are exceedingly bitter
over the result, though observing the
forms of friendliness and courtesy.
Montero Rios, whose strong and per-
Bistent struggle to save for his country
every possible asset from the wreck of
her colonial empire has cemmanded
the respect and admiration of his op
ponents, went from the council cham
ber to-day to his bed in a state of com
plete collapse, as a result of the long
strain and his chagrin over the small
fruits of his efforts.
Senor Ojeda has been prostrated since
yesterday and was unable to attend the
joint session to-day.
The . Spaniards charge equal blame
upon the European powers and the
United States for their downfall. One
of the Spanish Commissioners said this
evening: "The European nations have
made a great mistake in deserting
Spain and leaving her to spoliation by
the brute force of a conscienceless
giant. They all know that in the Phil
ippines Amftf.ca has takm moix* than
she can digest. She will ultimately sell
the islands to England or Germany and
when the transfer is made they will
precipitate a general European strife.
We have refused to sell any island in
the Carolines. We never thought of
considering an offer. Nor have we con
sented to negotiate upon any questions
except those directly involved in the
protocol signed at Washington."
Judge Day said to-day: "We have
settled all the points on which we can
agree. It only remains to engross and
sign the treaty. That will be done in
two or three days."
CONTAINS LITTLE
OUTSIDE THE PROTOCOL
PARIS, Dec. B.â The members of the
commissions say the treaty will contain
little outside the scope of the Washing
ton protocol and the matters directly
based thereon, like the provisions for
the evacuation of the ceded territories,
the t/ansfer of public property therein
and guarantees of the safety of the
property and rights of the Spanish citi
zens remaining there.
The details of the last class of ques
tions covered by the statement which
the Americans handed to Senor Mon
tero Rios at the last meeting, were con
sidered to-day, but all the commission
ers refuse to divulge the details of the
conference. Several points upon which
they were unable to agree were left

HER TO DEATH
open for diplomatic negotiations.
The Spaniards refuse to admit that
they had failed to respect former treat
ies guaranteeing religious freedom in
the Caroline Islands or that there was a
necessity for new guarantees.
The conclusion of the worx was, ac
cording to the commissioners, marked
by politeness and all outward evidences
of good feelir.g and relief at the fact
that the task was accomplished.
WILL AGUINALDO
SURRENDER PRISONERS?
NEW YORK, Dec. B.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: A report was current here to
night that Aguihaldo, the insurgent
leader in the Philippines, had refused
the request of General Otis to release
the friars held by him as prisoners of
war. Secretary Alger, whom I saw. de
clared there was not a word of truth
1 nthe report, and that he had received
no such information from General Otis
and he appears to be confident the
rebel leader wll surrender the prisoners
now that peace is practically concluded.
DIPLOMATIC CONTEST
WITH FRANCE NEXT
PARIS, Dec. B.â Diplomatic circles in j
Paris predict, as one of the results of
the Spanish-American treaty, a diplo- '
matlc contest between France and the
United States, which will have an im
portant chapter in history.
The French Government is reported
to have resolved to take up the case of
the French holders of Cuban bonds, and
it is believed France will declare that
the .repudiation of the bonds is the re
sult of the treaty which the victorious
nation imposed upon Spain. It is ar
gued that, through the treaty, respon
sibility has been shifted upon America,
and, therefore, the French Government
will endeavor to exact some pledge for
the payment or guarantee of the bonds.

SEQUEL TO MAGDA
LEN A WITTMEIER'S
SUICIDE.
HAUNTED BY THE TERRIBLE VOW
OF THE WOMAN SHE HAD
ROBBED OF HUSBAND AND
HOME.
Prayed to death by the woman she had
robbed of husband and home.
The Coroner's jury has returned a ver
dict of suicide, but there are some who,
knowing all the circumstances, look be
yond the emptied bottle of strychnine
found beside the body of Magdalena Witt
meier, and see the answer to the pray
ers of the discarded wife of the late
"Bottle Meier."
For Bertha Wittmeier, or, as she is now
known, Bertha Bockman, made a vow

TO f*RA V TO DEA TH.
that widow of her former husband
would die within two years, and within
a month of the expiration of that period
her enemy dies apparently by her own
hand, but without any known reason for
ending: her life. Moreover, there were
circumstances attending the finding ot
her body in her apartments at 515 Pacific
street last Tuesday morning that are dif
ficult of explanation.
For instance, the woman was found
with her hands folded across her breast,
which In itself was remarkable, for phy
sicians will tell you that ordinarily per
sons who die from strychnine poisoning
pass away in frightful convulsions, their
features distorted and limbs and body
drawn into most unnatural positions.
That the dead woman was aware of
Bertha Bookman's threat to "pray" her
to death is certain, for the threat was
first made in the presence of friends who
repeated the terrible old woman's words
to the intended victim. That it made a
deep Impression was manifested by vari
ous acts of Mrs. Wittmeier during the
twenty-three months prior to her death.
Mrs. Bockman is not present to tell of
the wrongs she has suffered at the hands
of the woman she swore to pray to death.
A month ago the rooms on Seventh street
near Adeline, in Oakland, she had occu
pied with her son by her marriage to
Bockman were vacated and nobody can
be found who knows where she is now.
To some of her neighbors she said she
was going to Arizona, She told others
she intended to remove to Idaho, while
one family with whom she was on terms
of intimacy has since received informa
tion that Mrs. Bockman is now in San
Francisco. Her son, George Wittmeier.
who lives in Alameda, has no knowledge
of his mother's whereabouts more than
that she told him she was going to Ari
zona.
The other son, Frank, gave up his po
sition with David Kerr & Co. in this city
about a month ago, and this fact would
indicate that he and his mother have left
this vicinity. She was not an agreeable
person, and her neighbors rejoiced when
she betook herself to parts unknown,
leaving only the tradespeople in the vi
cinity to mourn her departure, their grief
being due to sundry unliquidated bills.
The life story of the first Mrs. Witt
meier is full of pathos. Landing in New
York some thirty-five years ago she en
tered service as a domestic, and at the
house of a mutual friend, who had come
from the same part of Germany as her
self, she met John Wittmeier, a sturdy
young German, working at his trade as a
hatter. It was a case of love at first
eight, and within a year the pretty frau
lefnâfor she was pretty then â and the
stout young hatter were married.
They were both of a frugal yet specu

lative disposition, and as soon as they had
saved money enough the husband came
to California, hoping to pick up gold in
the streets, as people were supposed to
do in those days. Fortune did not smile
on him, however, for Instead of making
money he lost what little he had brought
with him. and fell sick besidesâ so sick
that he was removed to a hospital, and
word was sent to the waiting wife that
he could not recover.
Mrs. Wittmier decided that if she were
near her husband he would weather the
storm, and Bjae straightway made the
rounds of her acquaintances in New York,
and by borrowing' a little from each man
aged to raise sufficient means to bring
her to San Francisco.
Arriving here, penniless and friendless,
after comforting her husband by her
presence, she tried to find employment;
but at last, in despair of securing any-
thing better, she was obliged to take In
washing for some wealthy families.
She prospered from the startâ so much
that she was soon able to give her hus
band the best of medical attendance and
care, and it was not many months before
he was discharged from the hospital a
well man, his recovery being, the physi
cians in attendance said, almost a mira
cle, and entirely due to the influence of
his young wife's constant devotion and
self-sacrificing love. When he returned
to active life he found a son as well as a
wife awaiting him, for a child had been
born shortly after Mrs. Wittmeier's ar
rival in California, and the father and
mother had an incentive to Industry in
the person of their baby boy.
For some months the husband was en
forcedly idle, and tried to regain the
strength he had lost, but meanwhile the
bit of "hand wash" had grown into a
laundry and Mrs. Wittmeler was, by close
attention to business ana good work,
making money rapidly. At last John
Wlttmeier obtained work as a porter in
a hotel down on the water front. Later
he bought out a saloon on Pacific street
and, aided by his wife's efforts, soon made
it the popular resort of the seafaring
men. The name â¢ \dotUe Meier" was
given to the proprietor because of hia
being the first one on the coast to bottle
his beer and sell it in that form to his
customers.
For a time peace reigned in the Witt
meier houehold. The husband and wife
were both engrossed in money making and
all went well with them until Mrs. Witt
meier, finding herself unable to attend to
the demands of both business and home,
engaged a pretty German girl as a house
servant.
That servant girl was the woman who
was found dead last Tuesday.
From that day trouble began In the
Wlttraeier household. "Bottle Meier"
fell in love with the buxom servant girl,
and the hard working wife soon found
herself relegated to second place in the
household. Sent on some pretext or an
other to Germany Mrs. Wittmeier re
turned to find "Lena's" personal belong
ings lying about Mr. Wittmeier's room
with an unpleasing appearance of famili
arity and habituance, and a divorce suit
was the result.
Mrs. Wittmeier won her case and a
large share of the community property,
together with the custody of George, the
only child. Shortly after the decree was
granted Lena and Mr. Wittmeier were
married and kept on serenely making
money at the old stand. For nearly
twenty years Mrs. Wittmeier No. 2 and
her spouse prospered; and then one day,

INTENSE EXCITEMENT OVER
STREET RAILWAY FRAN

PEOPLE PARADING THE STREETS WITH
HANGMAN'S NOOSES TO TERRIFY
ALDERMEN.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Dee. S.â This city seems
to be on the eve of a convulsion
that. If brought to the issue
sought by the promoters, cannot
but result in violent disorder, in
volving murder, arson and rapine.
At the extra session of the State Leg
islature held at Springfield last winter
a law known as the Allen law was
passed, giving Common Councils of
cities power to grant to street railway
companies franchises running fifty
years, providing mutual agreement re
garding compensation could be reached.
Inder this law local traction compa
nies caused, at the last meeting of the
Council, to be introduced an ordinance
extending franchises to the limit and
offering what they deemed to be a fair
compensation. This has brought on a
storm of denunciatory disapproval from
the Tribune, Times-Herald, Record,
News and Post. While the law was
pending in the Legislature the papers
named protested vigorously against its
passage and denounced Senators and
Representatives who voted for it and
the Governor who signed it in terms of
unmeasured violence.
Mayor Harrison, whose private secre- j
tary was formerly an editorial writer I
on the Times-Herald, is opposed to
the passage of the ordinance, and in an
Interview Tuesday said he wanted 150.
000 men to surround the City Hall next
Monday night and, if the ordinance
was approved, to wreak summary ven
geance tipon the Aldermen voting in
favor of the measure.
This interview was published by the
papers named and each had an editorial

carrying out of his plan. This has been

Incidentally, during the trial. It came
out that the first- Mrs. Wittmeier, since
the divorce which separated her from
her first husband, had assumed the bonds
of matrimony with five other men. Her

wrinkled, loud mouthed harridan, with an
unenviable record, and a red wig. the lat

not a little to damage her son's cause. It
was vain for George's lawyers to argue
that the heartless conduct of Wittmeier
had been the first cause of the trans
formation which had occurred since the
days that she only stole time from her
washtub sufficient to visit his bedside and
nurse him back to health and strength.
The verdict of the Jury was against the
son. who has always been, under all cir
cumstances, the Idol of his mother's ex
istence. She heard the decision silently
and left the courtroom as one dazed. On
the corner she stood for a few minutes in
utter silence. Then she raised her head
and looked at the little group which had
followed her.
"She got my husband away from me."
Bhe said, "and now she has got my son's
money away from him. Let her be happy

who stole my husband and my son's In

She said the same thing in Oakland,
with a wild force of gesture and a light in
her eyes that struck terror to the timid
hearted who listened to her. And she said
the same thing to Magdelena herself once
when she met her by accident on Pacific
street one day, when shn had come across

held In various parts of the city to

newspapers, and warning the Aldermen
who believe the pending ordinance to
be a good one and who have signified
their intention of voting for Iv.
The Inter-Ocean cautions the people
to be slow to take the advice of its
contemporaries and in an editorial to

the fact that the anarchists who were

participation in the riots, but for incit

men hanged were connected.
So great is the interest in the ques

two great camps. Mass-meetings are

That was her invocation up to the day

JOINT COMMISSION
MAY PROBE SCANDALS
Senator Vest Introduces a Resolution
Providing for a War Inves-
tigation.
WASHINGTON, Dec. S.â Senator Vest
to-day introduced in the Senate a resolu
tion providing for the appointment of a
joint commission to investigate the
charges of corruption in the conduct of
the war with Spain.
The preamble to the resolution recites
that "charges have been made through
the press of the country over the signa
! tures of responsible parties that corrupt
I and improper means have been used to
i secure contracts from the Government for

APPROVE THE NEW CHARTER.
Citizens of Vallejo Vote in Favor of
Proposed Reforms.
VALLEJO, Dec. Sâ The election he*re to
day on the adoption of the new freehold
ers' charter resulted In 658 for the char
ter and 170 against it. Only one-fourth of
the vote was polled. Vallejo has virtually
been without a charter, working under
the general laws. The new charter Is not
radical in its changes from the old, nor
does It in any way attack local Interests.
The new charter makes a small increase
in the list of salaried officers, gives the
city a Mayor with authority which prop
erly belongs to such officer, a unifomed
police, whose continuance in office will de
pend on efficiency alone, a Superintendent
of Water Works, who will devote his
whole time to the duties of his office, a
Board of Health with power to enforce
its orders and a Board of Public Works to
look after the city Investments. It pro
vides safeguards against extravagance,
and the duties of the officers as defined In
sure great improvements in the city gov
ernment. The only material change In
the government of public schools was the
doing away with a salaried Superintend
ent, and making heads of families only
eligible as members of the Board of Edu
cation.
After passing to the Legislature the
charter takes effect in 1901.

New Phase in the Salinas Mayoralty
Contest.
SALINAS, Dec. B.â A new and lnterest-
I ing phase of the Mayoralty contest de- \
j veloped this afternoon, when Renlson &
Jones, attorneys, filed an attachment for
the sum of $1055 against Charles Francee,
now seated as Mayor, pending the dcci- j
â tea of the Supreme Court. The suit is
for legal services rendered during several
trials, transcribing testimony, printing
briefs, costs and other incidentals. The i
Sheriff .took possession this evening of the
furniture-store of Francee, who furnished
bonds shortly afterward. The attachment ,
and suit are the result of a quarrel be- ;
tween the parties over matters recently '
before the City Council, and It is believed i
; that when the case comes to trial some '
i spicy and very interesting details as to :
â  the Mayoralty contest last March and
. subsequent proceedings will be exploited.
SOCIALIST ELECTED MAYOR.
HAVERILL, Mass., Dec. B. âAn
avowed disciple of social democracy will
on January 2 be inaugurated Mayor of
this city, being, so far as known, the first
socialist to be elected to an administra
tive office in the country.
By the municipal election on Monday
John C. Chase, aged 28 years, a clerk in
a co-operative grocery-store, was elected
Mayor, as the candidate of the Social De
mocracy, by a plurality of 350 votes in a
field of six candidates. With him on the
victorious ticket were three socialist can
didates for Aldermen and three for Coun
cilmen.
. THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1893.
TWO HUNDRED CASES OF SMALLPOX AT BEDFORD.
HUNTINGDON, Pa., Dec. B.â Among Bedford's population of 2800 there
are about 200 cases of what is said to be genuine smallpox. This
alarming condition of affairs was discovered yesterday, and up to
that time there continued an uninterrupted commingling of the citi
zens of the town. The disease prevails from one end of the town to
the other. The Bedford physicians disagree, some pronouncing it to be
chicken-pox and others a harmless skin disease. Dr. Atkinson, State Health
Inspector, says it is genuine smallpox. Men, women and children, he de
clares, with smallpox crusts on their bodies and faces, have been traveling
the streets day and night and visiting from house to house, unconscious of
the true nature of their affliction. The whole town is now closely quaran
tined, policed and guarded and vigorous measures will be prosecuted to
check the plague. The danger to the whole central part of the State i 3
manifest, as the people of Bedford, while infected with the disease, have
been traveling far and near.
George Martin, a member of Company A, Fifth Regiment, of Hunting
don, who is afflicted with smallpox, contracted the disease While playing
football in Bedford from an opposing Bedford player, who at the time
showed the crusts of smallpox on his face.
PECULIAR FINANCIAL SITUATION IN CUBA.
HAVANA, Dec. 7 (via Key West, Dec. 8). â Serious problems confront
the last days of Spain's sovereignty in Cuba. One of the most delicate
and difficult of solution is the question of the return of bonds given by
civil officials and employes who now cease to hold office. Many of
these are cash bonds furnished years ago, the refunding of which
now becomes imperative. All such moneys having en appropriated and
spent, the Government is unable to meet these obligations or to fulfill the
guarantees.
The settlement of the arrears of pay due the mobilized and all the
regular troops offered a brilliant opportunity for masterly i.'rancierinK on
the part of the military intetidant. With money in hand for the full settle
ment of all pay due the troops, the quartermaster general devised an ingeni
ous plan. Paying the men off in notes payable in Madrid, he otrered, through
trusted agents, to discount such notes at 20 or 30 per cent for cash. As
practically every one of the irreeular and mobilized troops will remain on
the island, the men eagerly embraced this opportunity to have their notes
cashed, and a handsome profit therefore accrued to the astute originator of
the scheme.
SHARKEY AND M'COY SIGN ARTICLES.
NEW YORK, Dec, S.â Articles of agreement for a twenty-round boxing
contest between Tom Sharkey and Kid McCoy, to take place at the
Lenox Athletic Club, this city, January 10, were signed to-day by both
principals. The men are to box for a purse of $20,000 and 50 per cent
of all receipts exceeding $40,000. Tim Hurst was mutually chosen as
referee.
In order that the fight may not result in a fiasco like the Sharkey- Corbett
affair, the articles provide that the interference of any fighter's seconds or
their invasion of the ring will not stop the contest. A second or outsider who
tries to enter the ring during the contest will be immediately placed under
arrest.
The men will box under Queensberry rules, with the exception that they
will not be permitted to hit in clinches or breakaways.
After the match had been made Sharkey held a friendly conference with
Jim Corbett, who wished him luck in the fight and announced his intention
of going to the Pacific Coast to fight Jeffries. Corbett afterward sent a
dispatch to his brother in California, saying: "I' will take on Jeffries.
Match me to meet him in February."
WOMEN WORKING HARD TO SHUT OUT ROBERTS.
NEW YORK, Dec. B.â The efforts to prevent Brigham H. Roberts, Rep
resentative-elect from Utah, from taking his seat in the Fifty-sixth
Congress because he is a polygamlst and advocates the doctrine of
the Mormon church is to have the organized support of hundreds of
thousands of women in the United States. The initial woman's move
ment is to take an organized form in this city at a meeting of the Presby
terian Woman's Board of Home Missions on December 20. There are a hun
dred thousand members of the Presbyterian Home Mission Society alone in
the United States. The Home Mission Societies of Congregational and Bap
tist churches are preparing to make a similar campaign against Rob
erts and women's societies of other denominations are becoming interested
in the fight. The women are to give information regarding Roberts' case
and the supposed danger of a revival of polygamy and to unite in obtain
ing personal letters to Representatives in all districts throughout the coun
try protesting against the seating of an avowed polygamist.
ROMANTIC TALE OF AN ALLEGED DUKE.
NEW YORK, Dec. 8. â A dispatch to the World from Ixmdon says:
The Johannesburg correspondent of the Mail telegraphs:
"A remarkable story was told to-day during the hearing of a charge
of fraud against Charles Gunn. A statement was put in by the pris
oner In which he declared that he was the brother of the late Duke
of Hamilton, and had left England after fighting a duel. For private rea
sons his death was formally announced and a sham funeral took place.
"Gunn asserts that Robinson of Rotherwellbaugh filled a coffin, which
was sent to Hamilton palace and nlaced in a mausoleum, and says if the
coffin is opened and examined his statement can be verified."
The late Duke of Hamilton died May 16, 1895, leaving no son, and was suc
ceeded by his kinsman, Alfred Douglas Hamilton.
The late Duke's only brother was Charles George Archibald. It is re
corded in Burkes Peerage that Charles was born May 18, 1847, and died
childless in May, 1886. If Charles can prove that he is alive he may get the
dukedom and vast wealth.
DAYLIGHT ROBBERY OF A CAPITALIST'S HOME. \ i
MILL VALLEY, Dec. B.â While Ebenezer Wormuth, the capitalist,
was absent in Sausalito this afternoon, his residence in East Mill
Valley was entered by robbers and looted of everything of value that
could be carried away.
The robbery occurred in broad daylight and yet was so cleverly
planned and executed that not a clew to the identity of the miscreants
has been discovered.
Though Wormuth refuses to state the amount, it is a matter of com
mon belief that the thieves secured several thousand dollars in coin, as the
capitalist is known to have kept a large sum of money concealed on the
premises. _* â - ,
"ANOTHER INSULT" TO THE FRENCH ARMY-
PARIS Dec 8 âThe Court of Cassation this afternoon ordered a stay of
proceedings in the Picquart court-martial. Several of the newspapers
here assert that the court has examined the secret documents in the
anti-Dreyfus papers are very angry over the decision of the
court, which they describe as another insult to the army.

Senator Stewart has introduced a bill
granting to the State of Nevada 2,000,000
acres to be selected by the State author
ities from unappropriated non-mineral
land, and to be disposed of under the laws
of the State. The proceeds are to be set
aside as a special fund to aid Irrigation;
also reserving and dedicating all lands in

The Secretary of War has submitted
to Congress the report of the board of

improved by a system of wing dams at
or near shoals so as to give a depth of
seven feet; that a four- foot depth can bo
obtained above Sacramento City to Col
usa and a three-foot depth then to Red

temporary works at an annual expense of
$25,000. The board reports the river has

Representative Loud has Introduced
a bill amending "An Act in Relation to
Internal Revenue." by adding at the end
thereof the following: "Provided, how
ever, that the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue be authorized upon application of
a distiller, to allow any package or cases,
or packages, encasing not less than two
tins, said packages or cases, or packages
encasing tins, to be of not less capacity
than ten gallons, wine measure, to be fill
ed with distilled spirits from receiving
cisterns in such manner as said Commis
sioner may, by regulation, prescribe for
the purpose of exportation from the
United States. And there shall be charged
for each of Bald packages or cases for
the expense of providing and affixing
stamps five cents, instead of ten cents as
now required by law."
The hill Is limited to export, and, there
fore, in no way conflicts with the spirit
distilling interests of the country. The
size of the package is in keeping with
the law and regulations of the department
and does not increase bureau labor. The
charge for export stamps is not designed
by Congress to realize revenue, but to
assist the export and shipping trade.
Representative Barlow has intro

Sijecial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. B.â The 'Wash

in favor of opening negotiations
with Great Britain for the pur
pose of modifying the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty so as to permit the construction

the United States.
Should Congress during the present
session fail to enact the pending Mor
gan bill the President also favors en
tering into negotiations with Nicaragua
and Costa Rica looking to the construc

and control of the United States. On
the authority of a high official of the
administration I am able to state there
is absolutely no foundation for the re
port tha.t Great Britain, through Sir
Julian Pauncefote, has protested to the
State Department against that feature
of the President's message dealing with
the canal question.
On the contrary the authorities have
every reason to believe that Great Brit
ain will consent to any reasonable mod
ification of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty
that the President may desire, so as to
remove obstacles which it places in the
way of the control of the canal by this
Government. So satisfied are the offi
cials on this point that I understand
negotiations will seen be actively under

in an agreement especially intended to
CHECKS HASTE IN
PENSION BILLS
Vest Calls a Halt in the
Senate.
MAKES DEMAND FOR QUORUM
PAST DELICACY TO OBJECTIONS
REMOVED.
Regards Payment to Veterans a Sac
red Duty, but Seeks to Secure
All Proper Consideration
t of Measures.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. B.â ln connec
tion with the consideration of bills on
the pension calendar, in the Senate to
day, Vest of Missouri said:
"I do not want to be captious about
this pension business and do not want
to set myself Â«â¢Â» as a reformer, but this
thing of passing a lot of pension bills
simply by the reading of the titles, and
when a quorum of the Senate is not
present, has got to be stopped."
After further referring to the meth
ods by which pension bills are passed
by the Senate, Vest said:
"Men of the South have permitted
these bills to be passed, having some
delicacy about entering objections to
the course of procedure. Recent events
have obliterated sectionalism and we
are united. We can, therefore, come
here and object to this spoliationâ and I
use the word advisedlyâ without fear
of having our motives impugned or our
words misconstrued.
"We are payin 0 " out in round figures
$141,000,000 annually for -fusions, and it
is our duty to find out why It is that
thirty-three years after the cloÃe of the
Civil War this thing of pension claims
shows so enormous a sum. I have been
criticised by some of my people because
I have not taken a more determined
stand on this pension question. I want,
however, to pay munificently and liber
ally in pensions. I regard such pay
i ment as a sacred duty, but I do object
to the passage of these bills without
proper consideration and with the same
restrictions that are hedged about
other measures."
Qallinger of New Hampshire, as
chairman of the Pension Committee,
agreed with Vest in his desire to have
the pension bills carefully considered.
He thought a quorum of the Senate
ought to be in attendance when the
pension calendar was considered.
The anti-scalping bill passed yester
day by the House was received and. at
I the request of Cullom, chairman of the
! Committee on Interstate Commerce,
was laid on the table instead of beinc
referred to the committee. A similar
bill has already been reported by the
Senate Committee on Interstate Com
merce.
A considerable number of pension bills
had been passed before the Senators,
one or two at a time, began to leave
I the chamber. Finally true to his warn
! ing, Vest raised the point of no
i quorum. Forty-eight Senators re
sponded to their names and considera
tion of the pension bills was resumed.
At the expiration of the one hour al
! lotted to the consideration of the pen
sion calendar, twenty-six bills had been
passed.
At 11:50 o'clock the Senate west into
executive session. At 2:15 the Senate
resumed business in open session.
Morgan called up the Nicaragua
canal bill, with a view to making it the
unfinished business. He moved that the
Senate proceed to the consideration of
the bill.
Pettlgrew moved to adjourn. De
feated, 13 ayes, 42 noes.
Morgan's motion to proceed with the
consideration of the Nicaragua canal
bill was then carried, and after the bill
he.d been laid before the Senate, thus
becoming the unfinished business, the
Senate, on motion of Morgan, at 2:25
p. mi., adjourned until Monday.
Gallagher Given the Decision.
LOS ANGELES. Dec. B.â Billy Gal
lagher, formerly of Oakland, and Jim
Trimble of this city fought fifteen rounds
give this Government the right to con
struct and control the proposed water
way.
It seems to be pretty generally under
stood that the conflict of interests over
the construction of the Nicaragua canal
will prevent action during this session
on the Morgan bill, and in this event
there is reason to believe that when
President Iglesias of Costa Rica re
turns to Washington the latter part of
the winter he will discuss with Presi
dent McKinley and Secretary Hay the
advisability of entering into a treaty
for the construction of the canal by
this Government. Iglesias is in favor
of such action and so Informed the au
thorities while here. But nothing can
be done by the authorities on this line
until the Clayton-Bulwer treaty is
modified.
WASHINGTON, Dec. B.â ln the Sen
ate to-day Caffery of Louisiana intro
duced the following resolution:
Resolved, That it is the sense of the
Senate of the United States that the
President enter into negotiations
with the Government of Great Britain
for the purpose of abrogating or mod
ifying the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty so
far and to tue extent that the same
may be deemed to prevent the United
States from owning, constructing,
controlling or operating an oceanic
canal across the Isthmus of Darien.
here to-night. Gallagher was given the
decision by Referee John Brink. The
contest took place before the Los An
geles Athletic Club. Gallagher â was the
aggressor during most of the match, but
Trimble cleverly ducked his blows and
escaped punishment until the final round,
when he attempted to mix It up and vat
worsted. The men had fought once be
fore to a draw.

INTERNAL REVENUE DECISIONS
Thomas Will Not Arrest for Serving
Wine in Pitchers.
The following recent decisions have been
issued regarding internal revenue taxa
tion and the special war tax:
Merchants do not bring themselves within the
definition of bankers in the Hrst paragraph of
section 7 of the act of June 17, 18Â»#, by reason
of selling their own drafts to thejr customers'
they are not on this account required to pay '<
special tax as bankers.
An unstamped package of cigars cannot be
repacked in another box made expressly for
it. The stamps on an outer box will not pro
tect the Inner box, neither can a stamped box
be contained in an unstamped outer box.
The office will not approve of dummy pack
ages for the purpose of advertising cigars
Cigar packages having a less or greater num
ber of cigars packed therein than the number
denoted by the stamp will be forfeited.
In reply to a letter of inquiry which you have
addressed to this office as to whether you "can
make and sell blackberry wine without spec
ial United States Internal Revenue license "
you are hereby advised that you cannot do bo
unless the wine is made by you from blackber
rieÂ« of your own growing or gathered wild by
yourself or by persons in your employ, and un
less this wine is sold by you only at the place
of manufacture, or at but one "general office"
(Section 3246, Revised Statutes). If this or any
other wine is put up In bottles for sale, tax
must be paid thereon under the following pro
visions of schedule B of the act of June 13,
189S (war revenue act): "Sparkling or other
wines, when bottled for sale, upon each bottle
containing one pint or less, ie; upon each bot
tle containing more than one pint, 2c."
A fair or entertainment given by a fraternal
organiiatiun (even though the public pay for
admission) Is held not to be such an exhi
bition or show as is contemplated by the eighth
paragraph of section 2 of the act of June 13,
1898, If the proceeds are to be> devoted to "sick
benefits" or to other like subjects, and sqpcial
tax is not required to be paid therefor under
this act.
A draft or order drawn on the treasurer of
such an organization by another of its offi
cers for the payment of money to a third per
son whether "for payment of bills or for "sick
benefits,' " as you state, or for any other pur
pose requires a 2c stamp under schedule A of
this act.
An entertainment riven by a grange of the
Patrons of Husbandry, such as a "harvest
home festival" or the like, is not regarded as
such a public exhibition or show for money
as the statute contemplates and special tax is
not required to be paid therefor.
Jugs, pitchers, etc., used In serving wine in :
restaurants and elsewhere for the purpose of '
evadinp the war tax stamps will be considered
as bottles and must be stamped as such. But a '
saloon-keeper selling wine by the glass in al
lowed to draw it from the ca*k into bottles for
that purpose without stamping the bottle.
Special Revenue Agent Bert M. Thomas i
said yesterday that he would not arrest !
any restaurant keeper for serving wine '
in unstamped pitchers. He is of the opin
ion that the courts will not decide that
a pitcher is a bottle.

Capitalist Frank 7. Capitain Sued for
Breach of Promise.
Frank J. Capitain. a well-known busi
ness man and capitalist of Los Angeles,
was made defendant in a breach of prom
ise suit filed in the office of the County
Clerk Tuesday afternoon. The plaintiff
in the action is Miss Nellie Wallace, ]
daughter of Mrs. Martha R. Edwards,
who resides at 622 Post street.
In her complaint Miss Wallace avers
that she became engaged to Mr. Capitain.
who is her senior by almost a score of
years, last Christmas day. They were to
have been married on the 12th of last
April. The wedding was postponed, how
ever, and the groom to be, as Miss Wal
lace supposed, was called from the city
on business. While absent he daily
penned his fiancee messages of love. His
ardor began to cool by degrees, how
ever, and at last the day came when he
spurned his love and broke the engragre
ment. Miss Wallace now seeks to sooth*
her outraged feelings by recovering a
judgment for $50,000 against the capital
ist. Capitain, who has been long and fa
vorably known in business circles, is salt!
to be exceedingly wealthy. He was born
in Frankfort in 1846.

THE AFFAIRS OF
GREAT BRITAIN
France's Policy of Ex-
asperation.
PREVENTS UNDERSTANDING
RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND
GERMANY AGREEABLE.
The Colonial Secretary AlSo Rejoices
Upon the Development of Good
Feeling Between John
Bull ana Uncle Sam.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Dec. S.â Right Hon. Jo
seph Chamberlain. Secretary of State
for the Colonies, speaking at a Con-
Bervative gathering In Waketteld, York
shire, this evening, fully discussed
home and foreign affairs and the Gov
ernment's policy in Egypt, which, he
raid, depended entirely upon the pos
sibility of reaching an understanding
â¢with France, "a thing which is impos
sible as long as the French pursue a
policy of exasperation."
With regard to the relations between
Great Britain and Russia, in connection
with the far East, he said that while
hitherto the endeavors to reach an
agreement had failed he believed &n
agreement with Russia was necessary,
unless very serious complications were
to be encountered. There were, he con
tinued, no insurmountable â  hstadea to
an agreement. On the c< it was
quite possible to conciliate ... reason
able ambition of Russia with the fixed
policy of Great Britain to maintain
equal opportunities of trade for all na
tions.
"1 am more sanguine of arriving at
a settlement," said Mr. Chamberlain,
"because it is not for our interest alone.
The objects we have in view, are shared
also by the United States, Germany
and Japan, all of which have identical
interests. I dare say you have ob
served the very pregnant passage in
the recent message of President Mc-
Klnley iv ihe United States Congress,
the passage referring to the very im
portant interests of America in the
East, in which he declares that these
Interests shall not be prejudiced by ex
clusive treatment. That is a very
noteworthy passage, and, without being
a prophet, 1 think I shall not be too
sanguine if I say that in the future we
shall not stand alone as guardians of
the "open door.' "
Mr. Chamberlain then referred to the
charge o-f inconsistency brought against
him in boasting of Great Britain's
"splendid isolation" and then touting
for alliances. He said: "When I re
ferred to isolation I meant the isolation
of the British empire, comprising the
United Kingdom and our children over
seas, who are well able to defend their
own possessions and their own ex
clusive interests against all attack, but
surely it is not unreasonable to seek an
alliance and to expect co-operation
â where the interests involved are those
of others as well aa of ourselves.
"In the case of Germany we have as
certained by a friendly and frank in
terchange of opinion that there are
many interests regarding which we can
assist one another. 1 \hink 1 may hope
that in the future the two nations â the
greatest naval and the greatest mili
tary power â will come more frequently
together, and that our Joint influence
will be used in behalf of peace and of
unrestricted trade.
"But, if 1 congratulate you upon the
development of good feeling between us
and a great Continents state, still
more do I rejoice at the growth of
friendly relations between ourselves
and our colonies, between ourselves and
the United States. Already the United
States, if regarded from the standpoint
of potential resources, is the greatest of
civilized states â with its Immense pop
ulation of intelligent citizens, chiefly
Anglo-Saxons, and if we are assured of
the Anglo-Saxon race, whether it
abides under the stars and stripes or
the union jack, there is no other com
bination that can make us afraid."
Replying later in the proceedings to a
vote of thanks for his address, Mr.
Chamberlain said he hoped ere many
years had passed to see a federation of
the empire, with colonial representa
tives in the imperial Parliament.
Referring to a personal allusion to
"his setting a good example in forward
ing the hoped-for alliance with the
United States by marrying an Ameri
can," he said: "So many Englishmen
are following the example that I think
it quite possible that the alliance may
be accomplished without the interfer
ence of Governments." (Laughter.).

YOLO CATTLE IN
DANGER OF FEVER
Supervisors Asked to Enact the
Stockmen's Protective Asso
ciation Ordinance.
WOODLAND, Dec. S.â The Board of Su
pervisors has been appealed to to enact the
Stockmen's Protective Association ordin
ance for the protection of Yolo County
herdÃ from Texas fever. A few days ago
a drove of three or four hundred head of
cattle were driven through this county to
the Curtis ranch for pasture. It is claimed
that they originally came from the south
ern part of the State and that they were
on pasture in Solano County for several
weeks and have been exposed to Texas
fever It is probable that tho ordinance
will be passed at the next meeting of the
board.
SAVING TO SOLANO COUNTY.
Salaries Reduced Under the New
County Government Act.
BUISUN, Dec S.â The new county gov
ernment act that goes into effect on Jan
uary If VHt, will mean a saving to the
taxpayers of Solano County of $14,590 a
year. The amount formerly paid to county
officers was $26,500 per year, which Is re
duced to $22,750 per year; and salaries paid
to Justices and Constables under the old
e<'t amounted to $25,680 annually, reduced
to $15,240 per year.
ROSEBURG'S COURTHOUSE
RUINED BY THE FLAMES
Beautiful Structure in the Oregon Town Visited
by a Fierce Fire of Most Mysterious
Origin.
COURTHOUSE AT ROSEBURG, OR., DESTROYED BY FIRE.
ROSEBURG, Or., Dec. B.â Last evening after the adjournment of the Circuit Court flames were observed
issuing from the Courthouse cupola and from under the roof. Before the Fire* Department could begin
work the whole upper story was afire. To make matters worse, the hose burst. Meantime the fire
gained such headway that the fine building was doomed. There being no wind blowing, the progress
of the fire was slow, giving time to carry out all the records. Circuit Judge Hamilton had moved his ex
tensive library into his chambers adjoining the courtroom. He lost a collection covering many years, with no
insurance; also papers in cases under consideration. The upper story of the Courthouse is entirely gone, and
the lower floor is seriously damaged, the courtroom floor being burned through in places. The building cost
$40,000 six years ago. The insurance is supposed to be from $12,000 to $15,000. The origin of the fire is un
known. It is thought to have been caused by a defective flue or electric wires. The prisoners were moved
from the County to the City Jail when the fire was first discovered.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALX, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1898.
CONDUCT OF
MEDICAL SERVICE
Gen. Sternberg Before
War Investigators.
NOT HAMPERED BY SUPERIORS
! BUT SECRETARY ALGER'S POL
ICY WAS TO WAIT.
On the Subject of Female Nurses the
Surgeon General Said They
Were "Expensive
Luxuries."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. B.â The con
duct of the medical service 'of thie
army was taken up to-day by the War
Investigation Commission," and Surgeon
General Sternberg was rigidly ques
tioned about his administration. The
medical department, he said, was
equipped only fbr an army of 25,000 men
when the war broke out, and from year
to year the estimates he had submitted
had been materially reduced by Con
gress in a policy of economy of appro
priations. As soon as there was a pros
pect of war he had begun preparations,
though not making any expense. He
had models of chests made, he said, and
equipment developed, but when he sug
pested to Secretary Alger the propriety
of making purchases for his service, the
policy was to wait.
General Beaver asked: "Were you at
any time hampered in the discharge of
the duties of your office by your su
periors in the department?"
General Sternberg hesitated consid
erably and said, "Tso; certainly not, to
any appreciable extent."
There was a pause, and General
Sternberg hastened to add: "You will
understand that one man cannot do
everything at once, and there were oc
casional delays in getting the ear of the
Secretary, but nothing beyond this."
"Then," said General Beaver, "we are
to understand you had at all times the
hearty support and good will of those
over you in forwarding the work of
your department?"
"Yes," was the reply, "most undoubt
edly."
,As to the general condition of the
troops in mobilization camps, he said
their trouble could nearly all be
summed up in the two phrases, "neg
lect of sanitary measures" and "letting
the troops remain too long in one
camp."
"You have to do one of two things,"
said he. "You must maintain your per
manent camp under the sanitary con
ditions of civilized life, or you must fol
low the Indian method and shift your
camp when you foul your ground. I
can make rules which, if followed, will
insure reasonable immunity from ty
phoid, but I cannot insure their being
followed by the men in the field."
As to a new ration for the tropics,
General Sternberg said he had made no
specific recommendation yet. but had a
competent officer now investigating the
methods of the British army in Ja
maica, and hoped soon to be able to
make a report.
Touching the subject of female nurses
General Sternberg said, seriously, but
somewhat sadly, that "they were ex
pensive luxuries." He said the War
Department was getting requisitions
now for bureaus, rocking-chairs and
other things which were unknown un
der the male nurse regime.

LECTURE ON WAR
Praises the Bravery of
American Regulars.
ALSO THE ROUGH RIDERS
OTHER VOLUNTEERS OF LESS
USE, IN HIS OPINION.
Witness of the Conflict in Cuba
Predicts a Great Future for
the "New Colonial
Power."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN, Dec. B.â Count A. yon
Goetzen, former military attache at the
German Embassy in Washington, who
was commanded by Emperor William
to accompany the United States army
during the Spanish-American war for
the purpose of observation and official
representative, addressed a large and
distinguished audience this evening at
the Kaiserhoff on the "New Colonial
Power."
Although most of his hearers were
members of the Colonial Society, there
were some 300 military men present.
The lecture, which dealt largely with
the war, was illustrated by photographs
which Count Goetzen took personally â
views of the embarkation at Tampa,
the camps, the landings in Cuba and of
scenes in the fighting around Santiago.
The lecturer spoke sympathetically
of the American army and navy, ex
cept so far as the volunteers were con
cerned. He said the only good volun
teers were the Rough Riders. He se
verely condemned the insurgents, who,
he said, rendered little assistance to
the Americans. He did not see a single
white among the insurgents, except
among the officers.
Count yon Goetzen said the dynamite
guns proved ineffective, because they
lacked distance apparatus. He praised
General Shafter's treatment of the for
eign officers who accompanied his staff.
The United States regulars were char
acterized by the lecturer as "a most
excellent body, though small," and
their uniform practical.
A portion of the lecture was devoted
to a description of the extreme diffi
culty with which both the American
and Spanish troops were provisioned.
Count yon Goetzen prophesied a
great future for the new American colo
nies, because, he said, "the Americans
are prime colonists."
The lecturer was frequently ap
plauded.

FORTY-FIVE SEAMEN SAVED
BUT -REMAINDER OF A CREW
OF EIGHTY-EIGHT PERISH.
Officers of the British Steamer Veda
more Struggle in a Fierce Gale
to Aid Unfortunates on
the Londonian.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. B.â The Brit
ish steamer Vedamore, which sailed
from Liverpool November 2. for Balti
more, passed inside Cape Henry last
night and reported she had on board
forty-five of the crew of eighty-eight
men of the steamer Lor.donian. The
Londonian sailed from Boston Novem
ber 15 for I/ondon, and on November
23, in a violent gale, her cargo shifted
and sho almost capsized, finally resting
on her beam ends with big seas break-
Ing over nor, and for two days she
drifted about at the mercy of the winds
and waves. Assistance came at 5 o'clock
on the morning of November 25. The
Vedamore hove in sight five miles dis
tant, and as it was still quite dark the
Londonian burned signal tires and flred
distress rockets.
The signals were seen by the officers
on the Vedamore bridge and reported
to Captain Bartlett, who gave imme
diate orders that the Vedamores
course be changed. The Londonian
was then to the southward of the
Johnston liner. It did not take the
Vedamore long to cover the five miles
that la- between them, ai^ as soon as
ehe arrived alongside she was signaled
to stand by.
"Do you wish to abandon the ship?"
was signaled from the Vedamore as
Boon as daylight would permit her sig
nals being seen. Captain Lee of the
Londonian signaled back that he
wanted the Vedamore to tow his ship.
Captain Bartlett saw at a glance that
this was an impossibility and refused
to attempt it as it would have endan- j
pered his own ship. Captain Lee then I
signaled, asking that the Vedamore
Itaxtd by to render assistance. Soon
fcfterward he signaled, "Will abandon
ship,'-' and at noon, in the teeth of a
stiff gale Second Officer Hobbs and a ]
volunteer crew gallantly launched one i
5f the Vedamore'a boats and attempted i
to reach the sinking Londonian. For j
three hours the sturdy Britons battled |
with wind and wave in a vain attempt j
to reach her, but were finally forced to '
return to their own ship. Captain
Bartlett then steamed to windward of
the doomed steamer and other attempts
to rescue the Londonian's crew were
made fruitlessly.
As it grew too dark to do anything
more Captain Bartlett signaled, "Will
Btand by you until morning."
The piteous signal, "For God's sake
don't leave us," came back In reply.
During the night the wind increased
and by morning it was blowing very
hard. Then another means of rescue
was decided upon. For hours life buoys j
with lines attached were floated to the
Londonian and at last her crew suc
ceeded in getting one aboard. One
of the Vedamores lifeboats, im
provised as a life car, made a trip suc
cessfully and twenty-two half frozen,
exhausted men were hauled up over the
side- of the Yedamore and given every !
comfort the ship afforded. As the boat
was going back to the Londonian wreck
a big sea demolished it. The lines were
carried away and the communication
was broken.
Chief officer Doran of the Vedamore
volunteered to launch another lifeboat
to attempt the rescue. The seas were
by this time terrific, and it was only
owing to the splendid manner in which
the boat was handled that shj lived it
out. Fur two hours the boat's crew
struggled at the oars, but could not get
closer than sixty yards of the wreck.
They were at last forced to give up
and return to their ship, and in doing
so the boat was smashed against the
ship's side and lost. AH came near
drowning, but were hauled aboard with
lines.
Another fearful night of peril and
fear passed. The next morning twenty
three of the men of the Londonian suc
ceeded In launching one of their own
boats and reached the Vedamore in
safety. Their boat was also lost, and
all that day was spent in trying to
again establish communication with
the wreck. The gale was constantly
Increasing, and all efforts to save the
others were in vain. Even after night
haid fallen the Vedamore was kept
cruising about in the vicinity, but when
uuy broke next morning the Londonian
had vanished.
The saved members of the London
ian's crew were Second Officer Gittings
of Lcrndon; Second Engineer Granham
of London; Third Engineer Ayres of
Scotland; C. Tagan of Hamburg, don
key man; Charles Johnston of Dunedin,
N. Z., first cook; R. Cross of London,
storekeeper; O. Fiske of Germany and

of Dunedin, N. Z., and Frank Leimke
of Waldast, Germany, seamen; Mal

James Clarke, Thomas Bright and H.
Bartlett of London, John Foyjie of Liv
erpool, Gilbert Elliott of Dumbarton,
Scotland; F. Cupid (colored) of St. Vin
cent, W. 1., firemen and coal trimmers.
These twenty-three men were about
one-half of the ship's complement. All
the others are regarded as having per
ished. In addition there were twenty
one cattlemen. Patrick Ward of Bos
ton, foreman for Swift & Co., had 263
head of cattle on the vessel, and Daniel
Callahan of Somerville, Mass., foreman
for Nelson, Morris & Co., had 392 cat
tle. The cattlemen in the gangs were

among the missing.
The supposed lost are: Captain Wil
liam Lee, Chief Officer Mifrray, Chief
Engineer Stafford, Third Engineer
Slater and twenty-one other seamen,
firemen and cattlemen.
The Londonian was a fine steel vessel,
built at Glasgow in 1896, and registered
5532 tons gross. She belonged to the
Wilson-Furness-Leyland line. Her orig

CALIFORNIA
GROWERS NEED
PROTECTION
Protest Against Treaty
With Greece.
DUTY ON CURRANTS REQUIRED
THIS STATE CANNOT COMPEJE
WITH FOREIGN MARKETS.
Senator Perkins Presents the Views
of California Raisin Men and
a Strong Letter to the
President.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Dec. 8.
Senator Perkins in forwarding the
California fruit growers protest to the
President to-day wrote a long: letter
in which he said the people of Cali
fornia were greatly alarmed at the
reference In the message to a reciprocal
commercial treaty with Greece â that
has in view the restoration of currants
to the "free list."
"The cheap labor of Greece and
Southern Europe." says Perkins, "with
cheap transportation by water to this
country make it possible 'it the dried
product of foreign vineyards to com
pete successfully with those of our own
country. In California alone there are
at least 3000 growers, of whom 1100
met In Fresno December 6 to rejoice
over the increase in the market for
their products, and the bright future of
their industry. It was, as accompany
ing telegrams show, a severe blow to
their enthusiasm to learn that it was
proposed to again throw open the door
to competition with their products,
which competition would flood the mar
kets of the United States with inferior
raisins and currants whose price would
mean disaster to California producers
of similar products of vineyards.
"A duty on raisins and currants Is
absolutely necessary to enable the
great and growing interests of the
United States to even exist, and this
fact was fully recognized by both Dem
ocrats and Republicans in Congress,
and in the State whose great vineyards
form the means of support for many
thousands of people. 1 would therefore
respectfully suggest that no action in
favor of a reduction of the duty on
these products tie taken, by means of
a treaty which will nullify the acts of
both Democratic and Republican Con
gresses."
PROTEST OF CALIFORNIA
RAISIN GROWERS
FRESNO, Dec. B.â Following is the
full text of the telegram sent to Presi
dent AlcKlnley by the California Raisin
Growers' Association regarding the
tariff on Zante currants:
We beg to say that you have been mis-
Informed regarding Greek currants. These
cheap raisins, commonly called currants,
ruined our market for raisins, liuv-two
million pounds imported in 1894 through
the port of New York alone having been
used as a cheap substitute for raisins in
cooking. After five years of suffering and
foreclosures, due to low tariff on our pro
ducts, on Monday last we he ; d a jubilant
mass meeting in Fresno. 1100 growers be
ing present, listening to the favorable re
turns reported by our directors of
this season's sales, the result of
the present tariff. Suddenly all is
gloom again, for we know that if
Greece is allowed to dump her surplus
currants on the American market the
ruin of our Industry is certain. Over 3000
growers will be driven to seek other em
ployment, and the millions of dollars in
vested In our vineyards will be wiped out.
Such a blow is nard to bear, particularly
as it is to be struck by the
apostle of protection and the Republican
party. This blow directly affects all the
great fruit industries of California, of
which the raisin industry is a leading one,
and will paralyze their efforts at exten
sion owing to uncertainty of tariff meas
ures, and when your attention is called
to the fact that we have just elected a
Republican Governor and a Senator in
place of Democrats and have returned
only one Democratic Representative out
of seven, we feel you will agree with us
that California does not deserve such
treatment. We have won from the Span
iards the supplying of the American mar
ket with ra'sinp. and we are now engaged
In a similar struggle with Greece in sup
plying: our markets with currants, which
we will Just as sureiy succeed in if we
present tariff is allowed to remain. We
therefore beg of you to delay action in
this matter until we can have a full hear
ing of our side of the case. Very respect
fully,

SOCIATION.

FEAR THE ZANTE CURRANT.
An Urgent Protest Against Its Im-
portation Free of Duty.
The proposed treaty with Greece, at
least that part of it which relates to abo
lition of the duty on Zante currants, has
stirred up the directors of the State Board
of Trade. Yesterday the following tele
gram was sent by that body to Secretary
of State Hay:
The California State Board of Trade most
earnestly protests against any commercial
treaty with Greece by which the duty on the
so-called Zante currant will be removed or re
duced. While on the free list their competi
tion almost destroyed the raisin industry of
the State. We produce sr. 000, 000 pounds annu
ally by over 4000 individual ownen of vine
yards in which not less than $25,000,000 is in
vested. The industry lo hut Just recovering
under the beneficent Influence of the present
tariff. All thlg will be made clear to you if
opportunity be given.

SATAN LOST IN
TEN HOT ROUNDS
A SALVATION ARMY CONTEST
WITH THE FxEND.
Each Time He Changed Opponents
He Fared Much worse
Tuan Before.
Satan was one of the principals in ten
fast and furious single round contests in !
a twelve-foot ring last night in the ,
Salvation Army Temple on Market street. [
Though he was knocked out in every
round he came up smiling until the tenth, !
when he was knocked out by an "un- '
known," who, though sick, landed a ter- '
rible blow on his solar plexus, and Satan
went down and out Just as Corbett did
at Carson. There was no betting on the
contest, though some of the ungodly in .
the audience offered 10 to 1 oh. the devil
with no takers. Major Winchell acted as
referee, and at no time was he obliged to
tell the contestants to "break away." He
had to caution Satan very often for fight
ing foul. At the end of each round tne
referee rendered a decision in the form of j
a scriptural quotation.
The devil entered the ring arrayed in a !
swallow-tail coat, red hood and trousers
and a blaok silk hat. He appeared to be
trained too fine, and was overconfident. â .
The fight by rounds follows:
First roundâ His opponent was a baby
Ib his mother's arms, and as the little
one was not up to weight his mother took J
his part. Satan was extremely cautious,
while the mother was cool and acted on
the defensive. ThiS round was a battle
of words, and Satan endeavored to per
suade the mother to deliver up the child
to him; but when she offered it to God
instead Satan retired from the ring in
confusion, and so lost the contest.
In the second round Satan met a Salva- :
! tion Army lassie as he was tempting a \
young man to coninue in his evil ways, i
There wtis n
was handed to the devil by the lassie, who
was trained to the hour, and again
Satan lost.
Prayer was Satan's antagonist in the
third round, and he received a tern lie
uppercut, delivered by the tteavy-welght
drummer who vociferously seconded i
Prayer, and Satan went to the floor. |
He got up at the call of nine, but was pre- j
sented with another blow of the same de
scription and his seconds carried him '
from the ring.
The pace was beginning to tell on Satan
as he came up for the fourth round to en
cor.nte 1 " a carpenter who had never fougnt
before. The evil one sparred for an open- ;
ing and countered with his ieft, but was j
met v. ith a beautiful cross-counter which ;
tlackened his left optic. Sair.n coaxed
the carpenter in a corner and was. de- j
livering several foul blows when Faith,
Hope and Love. In the persona of three
beautiful young ladies, "McVeyed" them
selves into the ring and Satan threw up ,
the sponge.
A young man desiring to give himself
to the Salvation Army was his opponent
In the fifth round. They danced away
from each other and no damage was done ,
by either. The army man was awarded
the decision on points.
The sixth was slightly in the devil's
favor, as he met two Salvation Army men,
and while he got one the other fell upon
and almost annihilated him.
In the seventh round the taking up of
the collection was opposed by Satan, but
Referee Winchell decided tnat he had lost
by several dollars.
In the eighth round Satan tried to In
j timidate his opponent by disguising him
. self a:< a policeman. He did not scare
thf recruit a little bit. and amid halle
lujahs he retired from the fray consider
ably disfigured, but in the ring for the
ninth round, when he met a captain in a
prayer meeting. Satan was beginning
to lose confidence and he came up groggy,
but determined. The captain was on the
aggressive from the start and he deliv
ered body blows in quick succession and
so won the fight.
In the tenth and last round the devil
showed the effects of the punishment he
received in the ninth, and was very weak
when he met an "unknown," who was (
sick unfo death. He thought he had an ;
easy game, but the sick man, after super- i
human efforts, pulled himself together
and forced Satan against the
ropes, where he punished him at his own
sweet will. Satan sank exhausted over j
the ropes and for the last time was de- I
clared out.
MORE OF PRIOR'S
BODY FOUND
FIRE LADDIES EXONERATED OF
A BASE CHARGE.
False Accusations That Members of
the Department Looted the
Baldwin.
A portion of a body which is presumed
to belong to the dismembered remains of
Tate Prior was found In the ruins of the
Baldwin Hotel yesterday afternoon and
taken to the Morguy. Dr. Gallagher ex
amined the decomposed fragments and
pronounced It the pelvis of a man. As it
was found within a few feet of the spot
where Prior's head and trunk were dis
covered it is almost a certainty that it is
another Bection of his body, which was
cut into pieces when the building fell.
Since the morning of the fire accusations
have been flying about thick and fast
accusing members of the Fire Department
of looting the trunks and rooms of guests.
For a week past The Call has been run
ning down these reports and not a sin
gle instance where a fireman was guilty
of bo despicable a crime has been veritied.
When guests who occupied rooms not to
tally destroyed went after their jewelry
and other valuables in many cases they
found the bureaus broken and the trunks
ransacked. The first cry made was that
the firemen had looted the place, but in
vestigation does not bear out the charge.
Many persons who now claim to have lost
various sums of money are known to have
been practically broke the night of the
flre. This applies particularly to a num
ber of racetrack habitues, who have been
shouting about losing anywhere from $100
to *10,0 W.
E. J. . Baldwin declares that all the
trunks and bureaus in his rooms were
broken open, but he does not accuse the
I firemen. He says he does not know who
i did it.
Mr. Terrill, an Eastern drummer, recov
ered four trunks after the fire, all of
â which were broken into, probably before
the flames broke into the hotel. Thieves
| had plenty of time to ransack rooms after
1 guests left them and before the flames
i drove them from their nefarious work.
The only man known to have lost any
considerable sum of money is Mr. Mc-
Tuska, a regular guest at the Baldwin.
i He had $1100 in gold when he retired Tues
. day night and he placed It on the bu
| reau. His room was not burned and he
I sought to recover his money, but not a
I singie piece was found. One of the ser
| vant girls who ran by his room when the
I frightened people were fleeing for their
lives saw several men in McTuska's room,
i and they were, as nearly as she can tell,
| dividing this money among them. The girl
thought they were firemen and she void
i them they ought to be saving lives in
j stead of stealing. The girl told this story
I to several people and it was the founda
! tion of the story that firemen were the
I thieves who robbed the hotel. A diligent
I inquiry,, carried on secretly for over a
I week, has not produced any evidence to
I show that these men belonged to the Fire
I Department. From other sources it is
almost established that the men who
â â  stole McTuska's money belong to a gang
!of vagTants who infest the vicinity of
Eddy and Taylor streets, and who would
: not hesitate a moment to steal under cir
| cumstances such as were offered when the
I Baldwin was burning.

TO ENDOW A COT FOR
STAGE CHILDREN
Little Ones Will Give a Matinee Benefit Performance of
Francis Powers' Play, "The First Born," on Christ
mas Day, at the Alcazar Theater.
GEORGE OSBOURNE'S plan for organizing a society of "Children of
the Stage" is booming, and applications for membership have come
pouring in. So eager are the youthful members to at once plunge into
the serious business of the club that the invitational entertainment
and Christmas tree festival, originally slated for Christmas day, has been
entirely lost sight of, and in its place It has been proposed to at once
undertake the more serious aims of the organization. The most am
bitious goal that the "Children of the Stage" have as yet proposed Is the
endowment of a cot at the Children's Hospital. To realize funds for the
undertaking of this noble purpose, a performance of Francis Powers' Chi
nese drama, "The First Born," will be given by the little members on
Christmas day at the Alcazar Theater.
This ia the first time in the history of the local stage that children have
sought to interpret bo ambitious a work. George Osbourne, to whom all
honor Is due as sire of the organization, Is coaching the diminutive com
pany, and reports most gratifying results. So spiritedly and enthusiasti
cally have the children entered Into the Idea of the benefit performance
that Osbourne looks upon the management of the affair as an ideal pleas
ure. On Sunday at noon there will be a dress rehearsal, and tne tiny actors

NORTHER SHAKES UP
CRAFT IN THE BAY
A FIFTY-lIILE BREEZE CAUSES
DAMAGE.
The Lumber Raft Broken to Pieces.
Schooner Mary C. Russ Badly
Chafed at Powell Street.
Quite a breeze came up after sundown
last night and gave the vessels lying at
the seawall a shaking up. At 6p.m. It
was blowing twenty-eight miles an hour
from the north and from that on the
wind gradually increased, until at 9 p. m.
it was blowing fifty miles an hour.
The schooner Mary C. Russ was lying
at the Powell-street wharf and she got
the full force of the breeze. She began
to chafe, and when some of her bulwarks
were demolished the captain thought It
was time to move out into the bay. He
sent a telephone message to the Red Stack,
tugs and the Joseph H. Redmond soon
had the schooner in tow and dropped her
in a safe anchorage.
The quarantine boat Sternberg and the
revenue cutter Golden Gate got the full
benefit of the blow, and as it seemed to
be Increasing, Captain Macfarland took
the Sternberg around to the Mail dock
and Lieutenant Buner steamed the Golden
Gate to the south side of the Lombard
street freight slips.
At section 3 of the seawall the Italian
bark Stefo.no Razeto and the British ship
Peleus chafed a little and had to nut out
extra mooring lines and get out renders,
but the wharf suffered more than the
steel ships. The big raft, which gave so
much trouble to the tugs to tow her here,
nearly went to pieces. ,It did consider
able damage to the underpinning of the
wharf and a goodly portion of tha sawed
lumber escaped from the raft and went
to sea on the ebb tide.
All the tugs were on duty and Captain
McCoy was on hand to superintend opera
tions at the Black Stack office and Cap
tain Gray at the Red Stacks.
NEEDS OF WEST MISSION.
Property Owners Clamor for Improve-
ments on Silver Heights.
Prom West Mission street, formerly
Mission road,, from the residents and
property owners comes a complaint of
j neglect on the part of the Board of Edu
| cation. It is complained of for not pro
viding funds for the erection of a suitable
school building near China avenue and
| Mission street. The present school build
| ing, the Monroe, which was moved from
East Mission, near the City and County
Hospital, about fifteen years ago, has
been undergoing patch work at the hands
of the School Department for years, until
now it is unfit for the housing of cattle,
much less of children. Besides, the build-
Ing is not half large enough to accommo
date the number of pupils who seek at
tendance.
Another complaint comes from the prop
; erty owners against the Supervisors for
! neglect in not providing against flre by
having- an engine house near at hand. Tne
nearest engine is three miles away from
the thickly settled section. So far as be
ing any real protection to the dwellings
j in the West Mission section, it might as
i well be located in Oakland. The district
I has no hydrants and no proper supply of
water; not even a flre alarm box can be
found, should such a thing be sought.
A requisition for electric lamps on tne
line of Silver avenue, from Mission street
to the San Bruno road, has been filed
1 with the Supervisors for months, but so
I far none have been erected.
FORGOT THE GOLD DEMOCRATS
A Man Denied Naturalization Be
cause of an Alarming Blunder.
Otto Montz Becker, a native of Ger
many, and Albert Sinyard of Newfound
land applied to United States District
Judge de Haven yesterday for admission
to citizenship. Becker passed the exam
ination and was naturalized, but Sinyard
made a serious blunder and was turned
away, still a foreigner. When Sinyard
was asked by Assistant United States
Attorney Banning as to the manner of
the election of the President of the Uni
ted States he replied that the President
was elected by the votes of the Republi
cans. Colonel Irish almost fainted when
he learned that the Gold Demo
crats had been ignored. Sinyard also ex
pressed the opinion that United States
Senators were elected by the votes of the
people.
MUST BXJTLD OR LET GO.
Southern Pacific to fie Kept Strictly
to Its Promise.
"Erect the shops or open the streets."
That is, in effect, what the Board of Su
pervisors has eald to the Southern Pa
cific.
The promise made by the company In
1892 to erect shops and improvements in
the district bounded by Channel and
Brannan and Fourth and Fifth streets
has not been kept nor has any action
been taken toward its fulfillment. ThÂ«
promise to erect improvements that
would be valued in the millions was given
in all sincerity and upon it the Board of
Supervisors of that day closed the dis
trict described to all traffic and uses save
those of the railroad company.
Since then the company has made use
of the property and has kept none of its
pledges, and the following resolution,
passed favorably upon yesterday by the
Street Committee of the board, is calcu
lated to settle the matter one way or
the other:
Resolved, That the Southern Pacific Com
pany be and are hereby notified to erect their
shop? in this city, as per agreement set forth
in their petition presented to this board Octo
ber 31. 1892.
Hale & Norcross Judgment
The distribution of the Judgment re
ceived in the case of Fox against the Hale
& Norcross Silver Mining Company has
nearly been completed. On Wednesday
morning Judge Hebbard signed an order
authorizing Receiver Groom to pay out
$95,000, and yesterday morning signed an
order authorizing an additional payment
of $43,016. There still remain 17,000 out of
112,000 shares upon which dividends must
be paid.
THE PASSING OF
WILLIAM J. SINON
SUCCUMBS AFTEB A LONG
ILLNESS.
Was a Prominent Member of the
Democratic Party and Held
Many Responsible
Positions.
"William J. Sinon died of consumption
at his home, 2015 Hyde street, yesterday
morning after an illness of more than a
year. He was a prominent member of
the Democratic party for years, and by
his faithfulness to the principles in which
he believed and the generous manner in
which he treated his associates he won
for himself a host of friends who mourn
his death.
Mr. Sinon was born in Brantford, Can
ada, in 1854. Early in the sixties he came
to California with his father, William
Sinon. the well known contractor, who
died recently. He was elected to the As
sembly from the Ninth District in 1868 and
re-elected two years later. After finish
ing his second term he was made a mem
ber of the Democratic State Central Com
mittee. He served as wharfinger for four
years, was Deputy County Recorder for
two more and served as Deputy County
Clerk under M. C Haley. In 1894 he was
appointed superintendent of Station A of
the Postoffice Department, which posi
tion ho retained until July of last, year,
when he resigned on account of 111 health.
A daughter, 9 -years old, an unmarried
sister and an uncle, all residing in the
city, are left to mourn his death. The
funeral services will be held at his former
home Saturday morning at half-past 3
o'clock and at St. Brigid's Church at 10
o'clock. The remains will be interred in
Mount Calvary Cemetery.

NOW BANK AS DETECTIVES.
Policemen Dinan and Gibson Beceive
Deserved Promotion.
The Police Commissioners on Wednes
day night promoted Policemen Jere
miah Dinan and Tom Gibson to
the rank of detectives to fill
the vacancies caused by the death of
Detective Joseph Bee and the promotion
of Captain John Seymour. For some time
past both Dinan and Gibson have been
doing special duty in the upper office.
Dinan's principal work has been in the
tenderloin district, where he has made
some brilliant captures. Gibson, since be
ing under the direct supervision of the
captain of detectives, has personally at
tended to a number of important cases.
Both men are highly esteemed by their
fellow-officers and the promotion was a
source of congratulation not only among
the members of the detective department,
but to all the patrolmen with whom they
are on friendly terms.
Patrolman Van de Bogart, charged with
being in a saloon while on duty, was dis
missed from the force.
WELLS-FARGO'S FIGHT
AGAINST STAMP TAX
THE CASES MUST GO TO THE
FEDEBAL COUBTS.
This Will Give the Patriotic
Corporation the Desired
Delay.
"Wells, Fargo & Co. are not letting any
opportunity go by for defeating i-a
war revenue tax case. At the very
first its officers made the declaration
that they would not pay the tax for
carrying on the war with Spain, and
later they stated that if the courts de
cided on a teat case that the burden of
the one-cent stamp fell upon the com
pany and not the public the corporation
would abide by the decision of the court.
It was also argued that there was no use
for the merchants of this city to begin
any proceedings here, as fhe question was
under consideration of the courts of the
East, and a decision by the Eastern tri
bunals would be observed "here. Assured
by this promise, the Merchants' Associa
tion decided not to push Tne matter, es
pecially where it was sure of receiving
so little support by the United States
District Attorney. Nothing was done m
this city until Attorney General W. F.
Fitzgerald began a proceeding to compel
the express company to stand the cost of
the one-cent revenue stamps. About that
time there was a case taken into the Jus
tices' court, where the complainant won,
but, being a poor man, he could not stand
the expense of carrying it much further.
After the Supreme Court decided that
the case brought by the Attorney General
should be brought in the Superior Court,
Mr. Fitzgerald ttWl the papers in the ac
tion there. Yesterday the express com
pany began its campaign of delay and
technical fighting. Papers were filed in
the Superior Court to have the matter
transferred to the United States Circuit
Court. The bonds were filed, and the
matter will next appear in the Federal tri
bunal. This trial is not likely to happen
until after the new year, aa the Circuit
Court's next term will not begin until
January. The end of the case appears
about as far away now as at the begin
ning.
Suit For Water Bights.
The Merced Gold Mining Company, a
Montana corporation, has filed a suit in
the United States Circuit Court against
David Dorward. C. M. DÂ»bney and Daniel
Corcoran of Coulterville, Mariposa coun
ty, to quiet title to the water rights of
a ditch forty-flve miles long, from the

DON LUIS A CONUNDRUM
AN EXCITING DRIVE IN THE
HANDICAP.
Soscol Beaten a Head by Etta H,
Ridden by G. Wilsonâ Schnitz
Beat the Barrier and
Won a Purse.
When Johnny Reiff. the jockey. Is tossed
upon the back of the big sprinter Liber
line he resembles very much a Stockton
Slough mosquito trying to straddle an
olophant. Galen Brown's bay horse was
j^ked to beat some very moderate com
pany in the third event at Oakland yes
t.-rd"ay a seven furlong affair, and the
ring laid 8 to 5 against him. A year or
bo ago he could have performed the feat
without half trying, but is not the horse
of yore He was also a trifle sore, and
was last away when the barrier was re
,l. Master Reiff took matters coolly,
and gradually picking his way to the
front led Imperious, with "Skeets Mar
tin up, past the judges a length. The
.mart little speck of a man was enthusi
astlcally cheered by the occupants of the
stand, with whom he Is a great favorite.
Long shots had quite an inning during
the afternoon. Don Luis aowned the odds
on favorite. Chihuahua, at odds of 10 to
1 and Schnitz made a runaway race of an
other sprint, with 15 to 1 at one time
chalked againet his name. ** vori *f
reached the wire first on but two occa-
Eions. ,
On his brilliant showing some days ago
In a ruce with Obsidian. Limewater and
iV Medals, the Morello colt Marte o
was picked to win the opening scramble
for two-year-olds, closing, an S to o
choice. Thorpe kept him m f"> nt Â« n "j
within a few yards of the wire, where he
waa collared and beaten out a head by
the second choice. Peter Weber. Olen
hi' ked by the stable, finished third.
Although he had a hard race the day
before, Chihuahua was started again in
the six furlong spin, second on the card.
Jt looked easy for him, and the fast
(-printer closed a 2 to 5 chance. Looking
:ill over a winner. Turner got up the last
;>art with the outsider Don Luis, winning
by a scant half length. Colonel Dan was
a Close third.
The high weight handicap, decided over
the Futurity course, was a very prettj
. contest, resulting In another win for the
good mare Ktta H, splendidly ridden bj
Gus Wilson. In the betting Sport McAUis
: ter closed favorite, with Amasa next in
demand. After leading to the stretch
. weight began telling on the latter anrintei
and he was soon passed by both Etta H
suid the favorite. At the paddock Spor
was all out, and in ;i furious d--iv<- >â¢"â¦â¢
H just lasted lonp enough to finish a head
before the fast coming Soscol, a 15 to 1
shot, piloted by Turner.
Schnitz. at one time as good as 15 to 1.
â was presented with the fifth event, also
decided over the Futurity course.
"Skeets" Martin beat the gate with him,
nnd the chestnut won alll the way. Maj
esty, a rank outsider, was second, and
Kirardo, one of the favorites, third. The
latter, with any kind of an even break,
would have won handily.
Dan Honig's Zamar opened favorite for
the final seven furlong run. but receded
when a heavy play was made on Mamie
CL Zamar made all the running, but was
beaten handily at the end by the latter
mare, with Eddie Jones in the saddle.

FORGERY ALLEGED.
Warrant Out for the Arrest of F. T.
Duncan, a Druggist.
A warrant was issued by Judge Joach
imsen yesterday for the arrest of F. T.
Duncan, druggist in the Press Club build
ing, on a charge of forgery. The com
plaining witness is E. C. Heller, a clerk
in Raphael's store.
Dunfian, prior to July 9, had a drug
store at 359 Devisadero street. That day
he removed to the Press Club building.
While in business on Devisadero street
he became in arrears to the Bell Tele
phone Company and was put on their
"black list, which meant that he could
not get a telephone again.
After removing to the Press Club build
ing he went to the office of the telephone
company and, it is alleged, represented
that he was E. C. Heller and made a
contract for a telephone in his store. He
paid up for a month or two and fell into
arrears again. The telephone company
found that Heller was employed at Ra
phael's, and when seen he denied all
knowledge of the contract and also de
nied that he gave Duncan authority to
sign his name to the contract. Hence the
warrant for Duncan's arrest for forging
Heller's name.
Deputy Poundkeeper Held.
John Logan, a deputy poundkeeper, was
yesterday held to answer before the Su
perior Court by Judge Conlan on a charge
of assault with a deadly weapon in $1000
bonds. Logan was one of the pound men
who assaulted Charles Mitchell, a saloon
keeper, on Kearny street, while he was
trying to rescue his dog from their
clutches.
Murder Charge Dismissed.
The charge of murder against Mrs.
Mary Elizabeth Balkwell in connection
with the death of Mrs. Jennie Fisher of
Berkeley was dismissed by Judge Con
lan yesterday on the ground that no evi
dence whatever had been adduced to sus
tain the charge. Mrs. FalkweU. on hear
ing the decision, burst into tears.
Sanborn, Vail & Co. have mirrors,
combs, brushes, atomizers and manicure
tools in their perfumery department. The
very best moderate priced goods made. â¢
PRESS CLUB
ENTERTAINMENT
A BIG SUCCESS
The Columbia Packed
to the Doors.
THE SIXTH ANNUAL BENEFIT
POTPOURRI OF THEATRICAL
AMUSEMENTS.
The Show Was of an Exceptional
Character, and Despite Its
Length Was Run Off
Smoothly.
The annual entertainment of the San
Francisco Press Club packed the Colum
bia Theater yesterday afternoon with an
audience of the typical matinee genus
all silent and absorbed appreoiation and
but little applause. The entertainment
furnished was a potpouri in which noth
ing theatrical but deep, breathless trag
edy was omitted.
George Lask, whose recent transconti
nental adventure for Cyrano's sake has
told on his weight, held the rudder lines,
and he did his best to run off a pro
gramme that was long enough for a con
tinuous performance. By some gigantic
mental process he succeeded in material
izing the larger part of the bill. The
relict he attached to the index expur
gatorius when the clock struck 5, Mr.
Lask's dinner hour.
The entertainment was ushered in by
an overture by Rosner'a Hungarian or
chestra. This was succeeded by Miss
Louise Veiller's "Keeping Up Appear
ances," In which the Alcazar company has
won much success. Then came vaude
ville, John Morrisey's contingent from
the Orpheum, which was most cordially
received. The audience clamored for en
cores and the trouble began to boil and
sizzle. Lask for the first time in his life
surrendered to the omnipotent star.
Straight down the line of vaudeville the
show went without a hitch until the fe
male barytone, Miss Emma Cams, was
reached. Just then it was discovered that
Miss Carus had left her music and her
hat pins at home, both of which a mes
senger boy brought into court, and the
show continued.
In order to please the lovers of the
fadum modernum, "Cyrano de Bergerac"
was given a chance. Those who had not
seen the performance at the Tivoli and
who expected to see a Cyranese de Brlc
abrac were again disappointed. The third
act, the most beautiful of Rostand's wild
fire comedy, was tue one to which the Ti
voli Company limited itself, and it was
the most nrtistic number on the pro
gramme. Miss Lichter's singing of the
serenade, "To Roxane." was applauded
with more than the matinee abandon.
After the Tivoli Company had had its
brief hcur on the stage the vaudeville re
serve was called Into action. The "Gay
est Manhattan" stars took the front this
time and they worked as amusement
servers until the striking of the stage
clock warned the manager that dinner
time was upon him, so the rest of the
card was scratched.
The benefit to the club from the per
formance will exceed that of former
years. Every seat in the house was sold
and the advertisments in the souvenir
programme, which is the handsomest yÂ«t
produced, netted large returns.
The programme was as follows:

FOR OUR SOLDIER FRIENDS.
THE soldiers now in Manila will have occasion to
bless the thoughtfulness of Mrs. Price of
Healdsburg. It was owing to this lady that ar
rangements were made for forwarding to the troops
books and magazines. All contributions will be sent
free if placed in the care of The Call. The California
Northwestern Railroad will carry from points along
its line all reading matter that may be con
signed to it through the agency of Mrs. Price. This
allows the citizens of San Francisco and of a wide
scope of country to remind the boys at Manila that
they have not been forgotten. Within a few months
the soldiers may be returning, but there are weary
weeks still in the tropics and the long voyage home.
The next ship to Manila will have on board a sub
stantial token of remembrance, and every ship to fol
low until all the volunteers shall be again in their
native land should have a similar store.
LEES VS. WALLACE.
THE case of Lees vs. Wallace, although not by
this title, will come up in court to-day. The
Prince of Forgers, Karl Becker, the "Dutch
man," the wizard of the pen, will be brought to the
bar for sentence.
A brief review may not be out of place. Becker
was at the head of a gang who contrived a successful
forgery which involved the raising of a check for $12
to a check for $22,000, and getting the bogus paper
cashed. There were several in the scheme, and be
cause they disagreed among themselves an exposure
followed. Becker, together with one Creegan. was
arrested, put upon trial, found guilty ;.nd sentenced
tc the penitentiary for life. Since the passing of the
sentence Becker has been in the County Jail awaiting
a new trial, which, occurring recently, culminated in
a hung jury. Before a third trial could be had
Becker's associate deserted him, in the hope and upon
the promise of clemency, stipulating with the police
that he would testify against Becker, a despicable
piece of roguery, stamping him as a deeper dyed
scoundrel than his chief.
Becker, seeing that his own case was hopeless, then
pleaded guilty, being led to this by the assurance
from Chief of Police Lees that a sentence of seven
years in the penitentiary should be meted cut to him,
with credits for the time spent in the County Jail. A
question naturally arises as to whether the Chief has
not exceeded his authority. What right has he to
be Judge and jury? Thus the affair simmers down to
an issue between Chief of Police Lees and Superior
Judge Wallace. If Wallace shall abide by the in
iquitous arrangement concocted by Lees in the inter
ests of a dangerous felon, plainly the bench becomes
but an adjunct to the Police Department, a powerless
and discredited mouthpiece.
Becker was once proved guilty. By his own con
fession, he is guilty. Happily Judge Wallace has not
been even indirectly a party to the unholy bargain.
He is in no manner bound by the dictum of Lees. The
Bankers' Association is a private concern, which, by
declaring itself satisfied with a sentence of seven years
for Becker, commits an impertinence. No difference
what Lees may decree, or in what the bankers may
acquiesce, for the climax is in the hands of Wallace.
He can demonstrate that the court is bigger than
Lees, bigger than the Prince of Forgers, and above
being swayed by a dicker between crime and incom
petency.
It is not within the province of a journal to argue
with a Judge. Wallace knows the facts. He has a
full conception of their impo'-t. He is near
ing the end of a term during which his in
cumbency has been an honor to himself and a
gratification to law-abiding people. It is hardly
a supposable contingency that among the last acts
of his official career will be one catering to a Lees
or kowtowing to a Becker. We confidently expect
that the arrangement for imposing a nominal sen
tence will be swept aside as a presumption, an insult
and an attack upon the public welfare. For Wallace
to impose a less sentence than he did before would be
not only a degradation of his high authority, but
open confession that in the former instance he had
been wrong.
The sympathy which Mrs. Mentel is getting is
hardly enough to soothe and sustain. In fact, the
sentiment that a young woman is at her best when
unarmed is steadily growing in this community.
Spanish and Cubans still seem inclined to fight,
and. while this is to be regretted, the fact that Uncle
Sam is there to act as referee is a guarantee that
that there will be fair play.
The pleasing rumor that a number of Chicago
Aldermen were to be hanged to lampposts seems to
have been based on inadequate information-
THE ZANTE CURRENT COSE.
THE McKinley tariff bill put "currants, Zante or
other," on the free list. This was done without
knowledge of the fact that the Zante currant, be
ing a grape, enters into direct competition with the
raisins of California, for which it is a kitchen substi
tute. The Wilson bill put a tariff on "Zante cur
rants," omitting "or other."
The New York importers contended that this meant
a tariff on this class of dried fruit only when grown
en and exported from the island of Zante, and that
grown on the mainland at Corinth, and at Patras or
Ithaca, etc., must be admitted free. The Collector of
the Port of New York overruled this contention, and
it was carried on importers' protest to the Board of
General Appraisers, before which the case was heard.
The Government case was very imperfectly made out;
the witnesses introduced to sustain it were in a
nebulous state of opinion as to what the Zante cur
rant is, and their testimony rather favored the idea
that it is the common shrub currant, dried. Under
the law, the Collector of the Port, or the Secretary of
the Treasury, has a limit within which to appeal from
the General Appraisers to the United States District
Court. As the Collector and Secretary had no case
on the testimony taken, they declined to appeal, and
the decision of the General Appraisers stood as the
law of the case, and these currants under it were free.
The effect of this decision may be estimated when
it is known that no currants had been exported from
Zante to the United States for about forty years, and
our whole import came from the Morea and vineyards
on the mainland.
In this emergency Naval Officer Irish determined
to take jurisdiction of the case here, where the com
petitive interest lies and the testimony is accessible.
At his instance an importation was made to pay duty
and the importer was compelled to protest. Under
the law all actions in a port of entry under the rev
enue laws are brought in the name of the Collector,
so this one was brought. The case was fully made
in the brief of the Naval Officer, and upon that went
to trial. Under the law in such cases a member of
the Board of General Appraisers is assigned as a
Commissioner to take the testimony, which then goes
to the United States District Court, with the briefs
and oral arguments of the lawyers. General Ap
praiser Shurtleff was assigned to take this testimony,
and sat for many days in San Francisco as Commis
sioner. The first stand taken by the attorneys for the
importer was an accusation that Naval Officer Irish
had exceeded his authority and had overruled his su
perior, the Secretary of the Treasury. But, as the
Naval Officer's action had secured jurisdiction here
and the amount involved was several hundred thou
sand dollars of Federal revenue, this point had no
point.
In his brief the Naval Officer's premise was -that the
Zante currant is a dried grape, and that it is the same
fruit whether grown on the Greek islands, the Morea
ot any part of the mainland of Greece. He brought
to bear upon his case all the resources of botany,
etymology and commercial custom and nomenclature.
As the issue is a burning one now, in view of the free
admission of the fruit being again imminent, we re
sort to the copious and complete statement of the
Naval Ofticer's brief for the facts.
The so-called Zante currant is the dried fruit of a
grapevine, first known and for ages cultivated near
Corinth, and known botanically as the Vitis Corinth
inca. In commerce it was early called the Corinth.
This came to be shortened into corint, and corrupted
into currant.
Dr. Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English
Language, 1773, defines it: "Currant, a small dried
grape, properly written Corinth."
McCulloch's Commercial Dictionary: "Currant, a
small species of dried grape, largely cultivated in
Zante, Cephalonia and Ithaca, of which islands they
form the staple produce, and in the Morea, in the
vicinity of Patras."
French Dictionary of the Institute of Belles Let
tres: "Raisin de Corinth; blanc variete de raisin,
nomme aussi pasarelle," the latter being &c name of
a kind of white grape.
Standard Spanish Dictionary: "Pasas de Corinto,"
pasas being Spanish and Portuguese for dried grapes.
Imperial English Dictionary: "Currant, a small
kind of dried grape."
Encyclopedia Britannica: "Currant, the dried fruit
of a variety of the grapevine."
American Dictionary of Commerce, De Colange:
"Currants, the raisins of a small, seedless grape,
growing in huge bunches, often eighteen inches long.
Originally Corinth was the principal place where they
were raised, whence the name Corinths, from which
the word currant has been derived."
Skeat's Etymology of thy. English Language says
the fruit was known in England long prior to 4553 as
a Corinth raisin, which name was corrupted into cur
rant, and that when the shrub ribes was introduced
in the above year it was called currant, from its re
semblance to Corinths, although not seedless.
The inquiry ran through a long list of commercial
and botanical dictionaries, all confirming the Naval
Officer's premise that the fruit is a grape, and that the
name when corrupted to currant passed over to the
fruit of the shrub ribes, our common bush currant of
the garden, to which the Zante currant has no. bo
tanical affinity.
Historically, it was shown that when the Turks
were masters of Greece they completely extirpated
this grape from the Morea and the mainland and
from all the islands which they dominated. The Ve
netians were the masters of the island of Zante and
they domesticated the fruit there, and it continued
to enter the commerce of Europe and came to be
known as the Zante Corinth, or currant. After the
battle of Lepanto, and ensuing upon the final expul
sion of the Turk from Greece, this grape was re
patriated on the Morea, but continued to be known in
commerce as the Corinth currant or Zante currant.
The Naval Officer secured the testimony of the bo
tanical and horticultural professors of Stanford and
Berkeley universities, and introduced Greeks, Turks
and Armenians as witnesses, all proving his conten
tion. He also procured the importation from the
American Consul at Patras of a complete vine, with
the fruit on it, showing it to be a true grape and with
out resemblance or physiological affinity to the shrub
ribes, or common currant. When the case went to
Judge Morrow he decided that the Naval Officer's
contention was correct and had been proven.
Then places were changed. The importers had no
case for appeal from the District Court, and Judge
Morrow's decision stood as the law of the case. But
under the law that was not a finality, the rule stare
decisis did not apply, as it was not the decision of a
court of last resort. Therefore the New York im
porters again rallied, and on a new protest again took
jurisdiction in New York, and that case was pending
when the Dingley bill passed. The case as presented
by Naval Officer Irish influenced the Ways and
Means Committee in putting the present tariff on
Zante currants, and the result was satisfactory to the
raisin-growers of California. As to reciprocal trade,
it was shown by the Naval Officer that the balance on
Greek trade was heavily against us. that she took
of us practically nothing buy petroleum, and that in
1896 she made a commercial treaty with Russia
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1898.
agreeing to take her petroleum of that country.
Mr. Botazzi, the Greek Consul General in New
York, has been a wily agitator of the issue, and has
always cunningly fostered the idea that this fruit is
the common garden currant, dried. As we don't dry
garden currants in this country, of course it would
not be a competing article. The fact, however, is the
exact reverse. It is a grape and competes not only
with our Muscats, but with the seedless Sultana and
Thompson's seedless grapes.
In the testimony presented by the Naval Officer it
was shown that these Zante currants in Greece are
usually dried in the sun on the ground and on beds
of cowdung, which, by fermenting, supplies heat to
hasten desiccation. This accounts for the amount of
filth found in them, which requires that they be laun
dried before fit for use.
The raisin men of California have enjoyed one sea
son of fair prosperity under the Dingley tariff on rai
sins and Zantes. The President is misinformed in the
matter of this competitive fruit, and we appeal to our
members of Congress to inform him and prevent the
ruin of a great industry that will result on making
this fruit free.
THE SUPERIOR COURT VACANCY.
ALTHOUGH they have presented a great deal
of wisdom calculated to illuminate the subject,
the able lawyers of the dail) press have not yet
handed down a decision in the case of the vacant Su
perior Judgeship. In short, they have not yet decided
whether Governor Budd or Governor-elect Gage will
appoint to the late Judge Borden's place, nor whether
the legal tangle caused by the death of the jurist will
result in any appointment at all.
It is not with any expectation that these able law
yers will agree with vs â newspaper lawyers, like real
lawyers, never agree on anything â that we interfere
in this matter, throwing, as it were, our legal castor
into the ring; but the subject is interesting in its com
plications, and that is sufficient excuse for attempting
to cast the effulgent glare of our intelligence upon it.
At the time of his death Judge Borden was filling
an unexpired term by appointment of Governor
Budd. He had also been elected to fill a full term be
ginning January 2, but the official result had not yet
been declared. There is no doubt that Governor
Budd can appoint to the term which expires on Jan
uary 2, but can he or anybody else appoint for the
term which begins on that date? Judge Borden's cer
tificate of election has not yet been issued; in fact,
no one knows officially whether or not he has been
elected. When the Election Commissioners conclude
their labors â unless some one double crosses Judge
Borden's name in the meantime â they will probably
make out a document certifying that he received a
sufficient number of votes at the late contest to elect
him. They have not and cannot have any official
knowledge of his death, and the only way they will
ever discover that he has been summoned to his last
account will be by his failure to appear and claim his
office.
Judge Troutt had been re-elected and will claim his
certificate. Judge Murasky will in due time come
around and get his. Judge Seawell will probably
take a day off and call for his. But Borden will
never put in an appearance. Whether this will create
a vacancy for the term beginning January 2 is a ques
tion the journalistic jurists ought to decide before
they proceed any further with this matter.
There is surely a vacancy in the Superior Court of
this city at the present moment. It is equally certain
that Governor Budd has the power to fill it. If he
does so will there be a vacancy on January 2, or, if
there is, and he names the same man between that
date and the inauguration of Governor-elect Gage,
who can contest the title to the office?
The constitution limits the terms of Superior Judges
to six years and arbitrarily terminates them at the ex
piration of that period. Section 70 of the Code of
Civil Procedure authorizes the Governor to appoint
in cases of vacancy, and the appointee holds until the
election and qualification of his successor. There is
no provision of law enabling a duly elected Superior
Judge to act for a longer term than six years, and the
assumption that Judge Wallace can hold over by vir
tue of an election which took place six years ago is
untenable.
It is our opinion â presented with due deference to
our learned brethren of the daily press â that Gov
ernor Budd controls the situation. If he appoints a
Judge before January 2 and reappoints him after that
date, the gentleman will hold office, not until the elec
tion under the new charter next year, but until Jan
uary 1, 1901.
Concerning a young lady who was recently taken

spice of life, these conflicting statements are of course
welcome.

is that of robbing patrons.

THE CLAYTON-BULWER TREATY
Previous Contentions That Were Made for Its
Abrogation.
The contentions and discussions preced
ing and leading up to the making of the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty and the reasons
that made it apparently necessary and
desirable as well as the several efforts
that have since been made to have it
mutually declared Invalid and abrogated
form a very interesting chapter in the
history of American diplomacy.
The treaty was signed at Washington
April 19, 1850. by Mr. Clayton, Secretary
of State in President Taylor's administra
tion, for the United States, and Sir H. L.
Bulwer, the British Minister at Washing
ton, for Great Britain.
The opening of interoceanic communi
cation had become a matter of paramount
importance to the United States, on ac
count of the vast rush of population to
the newly acquired California, where the
discovery of gold had closely followed the
formal transfer of the territory from the
possession of Mexico, to that of the United
States by the treaty of Gaudaloupe
Hidalgo, May, 1848.
Already in December. 1546, there had
been ratified a treaty between the United
States and New Granada (now Colombia),
by which a right of transit over the Isth
mus of Panama was given to the United
States and free transit over the isthmus
"from one to the other sea," guaranteed
by both of the contracting powers.
Under the shelter of this treaty the
Panama Railroad Company, composed of
citizens of the United States, and working
with capital supplied from the United
States, was organized in 1850 and the road
put in full operation in ISSS.
In 1549, however, before this company
had taken shape, the United States en
tered into a treaty with Nicaragua for
the opening of a ship canal from Grey
town (San Juan), on the eastern coast, by
way of the San Juan River and Lake
Nicaragua to a convenient point on the
Pacific Coast.
Grey town was then, however, virtually
In possession of and occupied by British
settlers, mostly from Jamaica, and the
whole of the eastern coast of Nicaragua,
so far as the terminus of such a canal
was concerned, was held, so Great Brit
ain maintained, by the Mosquito Indians,
over whom she claimed to exercise a pro
tectorate.
That the Mosquito Indians had no set
tled rights over such territorial site and
that, even if they had, Great Britain had
no such protectorate or sovereignty over
them as authorized her to exercise any
dominion or control over their soil, was at
the time insisted on by the United States,
and that position has since been repeat
edly affirmed.
But the mere fact that pretension and
claims, baseless as they were, had been
set up, and that any attempt to force a
canal through the Mosquito Indian coun
try might precipitate a war, induced Mr.
Clayton to ask, through Sir H. L. Bulwer,
the then British Minister at Washington,
the administration of Lord John Russell
(Lord Palmerston being Foreign Secre
tary) to withdraw the British pretensions
to the coast, so as to permit the con
struction of the canal under the joint
auspices of the United States and Nica
ragua.
This the British Government declined
to do, but agreed to enter Into a treaty for
a joint protectorate over the proposed
canal. After some long discussion the
treaty was drawn and signed in April,
1850, and ratifications were exchanged on
the 4th of July following. The provi
sions which it is now sought to abrogate
are embodied in the first article, in the
following language:
The governments of the United States and
Great Britain hereby declare neither the one
nor the other will ever obtain or maintain for
itself any exclusive control of said ship canal;
agreeing that neither will ever erect or main
tain any fortification commanding the same or
in the vicinity thereof, or occupy or fortify or
colonize or assume or exercise any dominion
over Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Mosquito
coast or any part of Central America; nor Will
either make use of any protection which either
affords or may afford, or any alliance which
either has or may have, to or with any state
or people for the purpose of erecting or main
taining any auch fortifications, or occupying,
fortifying or colonizing Nicaragua, Costa Rica,
the Mosquito coast or any part of Central
America; or of assuming or exercising domin
ion over the same; nor will the United States
or Great Britain take advantage of any inti
macy or use any alliance, connection oÂ»* in
fluence that either may possess with any state
or government through whose territory the
said canal may pass for the purpose of acquir
ing or holding directly or Indirectly for the
citizens or subjects of the one any rights or
advantages In regard to the commerce or navi
gation through the said canal which shall not
be offered on the same terms to the citizens or
subjects of the other.
Since the execution of the treaty there
have been many controversies and much
diplomatic correspondence between the
two Governments respecting the inter
pretation of the principal clauses. Great
Britain having maintained her dominion
over the Belize, or British Honduras, it
has been claimed by the United States
that the treaty is void or has become
voidable at the option of the United
States, on the grounds (in the language
of a dispatch from Mr. Frelinghuysen,
dated July 19, 1884)â first, that the consid
eration of the treaty having failed, its
object never having been accomplished,
the United States did not receive that for
which it covenanted; and, second, that
Great Britain has repeatedly violated her
agreement not to colonize the Central
American coast. On November 19, 1881,
Secretary Elaine, through Minister Low
ell, proposed to the British Government
certain modifications of the Clayton-Bul
wer treaty. He argued that the conven
tion was made "under exceptional and
extraordinary conditions, which had long
ceased to exist â conditions which were
at best temporary in their nature and
which can never be reproduced"; that the
interests of her Majesty's Government
were insignificant, while those of the
United States were paramount; that "the
presumptive Intention of the treaty was
to place the two powers on a plane of
perfect equality, but that in practice this
would prove utterly delusive and would,
instead, surrender It, if not in form yet
in effect, to the control of Great Britain,
as the treaty binds the United States not
to use its military forces in any precau
tionary measure, while it leaves Great
Britain perfectly free and unrestrained,
ready at any moment to seize both ends
of the canal and render its military occu
pation on land entirely within the dis
cretion of her Majesty's Government."
Lord Granville ably fenced the proposi
tion, and a long letter, to which Secretary
Frelinghuysen replied on May 8, 1882, re
counting the history of the treaty and the
changed condition of things since it was
entered into, and saying:
The Clayton-Bulwer treaty waa concluded to
secure a thing which did not exist and which
now never can exist. It was to secure the con
struction of a canal under the grant of 1849
from Nicaragua that the United States con
sented to waive the exclusive and valuable
rights that had been given to them, etc., etc.
Through no fault of theirs (the United States)
time was necessarily lost, the work was never
begun and the concession failed. The Presi
dent does not think that the United States are
called upon by any principle of equity to re
vlve those provisions of the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty which were ipeclally applicable to The
concession of 1849 and apply them to any other
concession which has been since or may here-
after be secured.
In reply, Lord Granville, in a dispatch
of December 30, 1882, denied that there was
any reason for the United States de
nouncing the treaty or that any necessity
existed for removing any of its provi
sions.
Mr. Freling-huysen, in a dispatch of May
5, 1883. reaffirmed his position as to the
voldabilfty of the treaty, on the ground,
first, that the first part of it "related to
the construction of a canal by the Nica
raguan route only; and secondly because
Great Britain has at the present day a
colony instead of a settlement at Belize,"
besides advancing many other argu
ments fully demonstrating the contention
of the United States Government. Further
correspondence ensued, but no definite re
sult was ever reached.
The United States Government has thus
maintained from the outset of the contro
versy that the treaty was void or void
able at its option.
KIND WORDS FOR
O'SHAUGHNESSY
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7. 1898.
To the Editor of the San Francisco
Callâ Dear Sir: You allowed me this
morning a brief comment on the life of
the late Rhodes Borden. To-day the
spectacle of a large congregation of
men and women kneeling before the
altar of St. Joseph's Church, while the
funeral services over the body of Charles
O'Shaughnessy were intoned and sung,
in a different sphere of life furnished
another example r the young men of
this State, which a daily journal may
well notice. I am not given to moral
izing, in fact, as a rule, I dislike theor
etical moralists, but this particular
scene was practically impressive.
O'Shaughnessy was a young man with
a fine face, clear eye and manly bearing.
His working life for ten years had been
spent in an elevator at the Palace.
His appearance and his voice were fa
miliar to thousands of guests repre
senting every part of the world. In a
place involving very great responsi
bility, he had never failed, and his one
act of temporary forgetfulness cost
only his own life. He had been sober,
honest, intelligent, careful, steady,
obliging and agreeable, and, when he
died, he had acquired a character and.
earned a reputation which secured re
gret for his loss and honor to his
memory. It is true, therefore, that
here and everywhere, merit gains suc
cess. The actual business of the world
is not conducted by pothouse politi
cians or by the rioters who pollute the
day and make the night hideous. While
our State produces young men of the
type of O'Shaughnessy no serious danger
will threaten our institutions, our so
ciety or our civilization. The music,
the perfume and the sympathy which
floated about his remains were more
than an clegy â they were an inspira
tion. PUBLICOLA.

ARCHBISHOP
RIORDAN WINS
A NOTED CASE
The Bequests in the
Donahue Estate.
RECOVERS TWENTY THOUSAND
IMPORTANT DECISION BY DIS
TRICT JUDGE BEATTY.
An Honest Agreement Not Against
Public Policy and Must Be
Fulfilled by Mrs.
Sprague.
United States District JiJdge James H.
Beatty of Idaho rendered his decision in
the case of Archbishop Riordan vs. Mrs.
Belle W. Sprague in the Circuit Court yes
terday. The questions presented arose
upon a demurrer to the complaint, and
were presented before Judge Beatty while
he sat in the Circuit Court several months
ago. His opinion has been forwarded to
the clerk from Idaho. The defendant, Mrs.
Sprague, is a daughter of Judge William
T. Wallace, and was formerly Mrs. Belle
W. Donahue, widow of James Mervyn
Donahue, deceased.
While Mr. Donahue's estate was in
course of administration at San Rafael,
two agreements were made by the Arch
bishop, Mrs. Sprague and certain Catholic
asylums. By the terms of one of these
stipulations Archbishop Riordan and the
Catholic asylums agreed that in any dis
tribution of the estate two-thirds of the
property should be regarded as com
munity property, and that the estate
should be distributed accordingly.
The law allows a man to give in char
ity one-third of his separate estate and
one-third of half the community proper
ty, the other half going to the widow.
Consequently, the larger the amount of
community property, the more would go
to the widow, and less could go to char
ity.
Judge Angellotti decided that the com
munity property did not reach two-third*
of the entire estate, and, consequently,
those charitable institutions which did
not make the agreement that two-thirds
of the estate was community property
received a greater share tTian Archbishop
Riordan and the Catholic institutions that
did sign the stipulation.
The amount which the Archbishop and
these institutions lost by their stipula
tion was $20,858 40, which the Superior
Court of Marin County distributed to Mrs.
Sprague.
The stipulation upon which the suit de
cided by Judge Beatty was brought was
a part of the same transaction. By that
stipulation it was agreed by Mrs. Sprague
that if a bequest of $2~.,000 for the build
ing of a fountain was decided to be a Kift
to charity and to be taken out of the fund
legally disposable for charitable purposes
she would make up the loss to Archbishop
Riordan and the Catholic charities which
had signed the stipulation with her that
two-thirds of the estate should be regard
ed as community property.
The Superior Court of Marin County
did decide that the fountain was a char
ity, and the losses sustained by that de
cision were as follows: Archbishop Rior
dan, $15,151 51; Roman Catholic Orphan
Asylum, $3030 30; St. Vincent's Roman
Catholic Orphan Asylum of San Rafael,
$3030 30, and St. Joseph' s Roman Catholic
Infant Asylum of San Francisco. $757 57.
Notwithstanding the agreement Mrs.
Sprague refused to pay the several
amounts above named, and suit was ac
cordingly brought in the Superior Court,
which she caused to be transferred to the
Circuit Court upon the ground that she
was a resident of th' State of Louisiana,
where she lived with her husband, Rich
ard T. Sprague.
The point upon which she attempted to
avoid her contract was that it was
against public policy, in this: that the
result of the stipulation was to give more
than one-third to charity. This claim is
disposed of by Judge Beatty in an opin
ion covering nine pages, in the course of
which he says: "It may be observed that
at the threshold of the negotiations be
tween these parties their declared pur
pose was to avoid the trouble, expense
and delay of litigation. Such contracts
honestly entered into are not discouraged
by the courts."
In conclusion Judge Beatty said, speak
ing of the plaintiff: "I can perceive no
reason why he may not by such a con
tract as he made with the defendant
protect himself against the possible
adverse action of the court," and con
cluded by deciding that the contract was
not against public policy and that it was
enforceable, and accordingly overruled
the demurrer.

The contest is declared a draw." From
this it appears that Lavigne did not win

The clerks at the Merchants' Exchange
h;ul a very quiet time of it yesterday.
From 9 a. m. to 5 p. m. there were only
two arrivals and six departures. Two of
these were the steamers Walla Walla
from Puget Sound ports and the Peru for
Hongkong via Honolulu and Yokohama.
The latter took away fourteen cabin and
a few Chinese passengers, but was load
ed to the guards with freight. All the
unoccupied staterooms were filled with
merchandise and every available space
on the ship was taken up with cargo.
Even then the Peru could not take away
all that was offered and a large quantity
of stuff had to be left behind for the next
vessel.
On the bay it was just as quiet as if was
on 'change. The water was like glass
and the only thing moving outside of the
ferry boats was a fleet of scows which
were trying vainly to make their way
against the tide. There was no wind, so
those whom the current did not suit
came to an anchor to wait the turn. . " â 
The Italian bark Stefano Razeto and
British ship Peleus came together at sec
tion 3 of the seawall. The Razeto was
docking and the tide carried her down on
the Britisher, which was fast to the
wharf. The damage was slight and the
vessels were separated without any dif
ficulty.
The overdue American ship St. John ar
rived at Hiogo, Japan, from Philadelphia
yesterday. She was 212 days out and 35
per cent reinsurance had been paid on
her.
The Italian cruiser Etna will start for
home next week. She is, taking on board
COO tons of coal and over a hundred tons
of it has been piled up on the forward
deck. It has been thoroughly lashed
down and is expected to remain in place
even though a storm be encountered. It
has not yet been definitely settled whether
the Etna will go to Italy via the Straits
of Magellan or Yokohama and the Suez
canal.
Alexander Harrigan was arrested yes
terday by Officer W. E. Gwin and was
locked up in the Harbor police station.
Harrigan keeps a saloon at 72l Davis street
and he and his wife do not get along well
together. Wednesday night they had a
row. and according to Mrs. Harrigan's
Story he threatened to blow her brains
out. She was not taking any chances, so
had him arrested for threats against life.
Harrigan took the matter philosophically,
and when Captain Dunlevy fixed the
bail at $500 cash he pulled out a leather
sack and stacked up twenty-five twenty
dollar gold pieces without a word.
George Fay did not fare as well as Har
ridan, as he had to remain in Jail for lack
of bail. Fay secured a horse and wagon
and a bogus order and went to Jackson
street wharf, where he got twenty sacks
of beans on the order. He was driving
away with the load when Officer P. A.
Mahoney came along and after asking
a few questions took the whole outfit to
the Harbor police station. Fay was
charged with grand larceny, and horse,
wagon and beans were held as evidence.
The steamer San Bias was put on the
California drydock yesterday and will get
away for Central American ports on Sat
urday. Captain Alfred Urry will take

Tacoma will stop at Honolulu and take

There was no wind and the sun was shining brightly, bo the crews of the various soow schooners enjoyed
themselves. Those of them whom the tide suited drifted along with the current and took a sun bath, while
those whom the tide was against came to anchor and took a rest. They did not whistle for a breeze, but con
tentedly went to sleep, leaving the dog on watch. Outside of the ferry boats the scows had the bay to them
selves yesterday.
IRVING AND
DUNNE IN A
VERBAL JOUST
Warm Words in the
Jury-Room.
JUDGE BELCHER PRESIDED
CHAIRMAN ACCUSES THE AT
TORNEY OF NEGLIGENCE.
Absence of Witnesses Makes Diffi
cult the Lchool Board Investi
gation by the Grand
Jury.
The Grand Jury mot again last evening
to resume its investigation into the af
fairs of the Board of Education, but
owing to the absence of important wit
nesses the session was of no avail, and
the proceeding resolved itself into an
ample scrap between Grand Juryman
Irving and Assistant District Attorney
Joe Dunne.
It was such an unpleasantness as one
would expect to see between men high
in the political order. There were charges
made and unkind things tossed back and
forth, but by nicest imputation only. The
imputations came quick and hot, but
couched in such English that Judge Bel
cher, who presided at the ringside, could
find no fault.
The difference was brought about by the
absence of John A. Reynolds, whose ex
pose of School Board criminality appeared
exclusively in The Call, and precipitated
the present investigation. Chairman Irv
ing needed Reynolds' testimony, and he
left word with District Attorney Dunne
to have him subpenaed. Reynolds did not
turn up at the meeting last night, and
after waiting a reasonable time the jury
adjourned to Judge Belcher's courtroom
to report a couple of important indict
ments. Judge Belcher filed the papers,
and was about to dismiss the jury, when
Mr. Irving got up to say: "Your Honor,
I wish to ask if it would be permissible
for me to bring in outside counsel to as
sist the District Attorney's office in this
investigation, providing that I can secure
the services of an attorney without ex
pense to this jury? The District Attor
ney's office is evidently so busy that it
cannot give us just the kind of assistance
we want at this time."
Judge Belcher did not perceive the veiled
sigmticance of Chairman lrving's gently
put suggestions and he thought it would
be a very graceful thing to provide help
for Mr. Dunne and he said so.
Dunne didn't think so, however, and he
did not display the soft phrases of an
Irving in saying so. "I want to say,"
said Dunne, "that the District Attorney's
office is now and has been willing, anx
iously willing, and competent to give this
Grand Jury all of the assistance it needs,
and it does not require any imported help
in doing so, and I wish here, in the most
public and pointed English at my com
mand to resent any imputation of unwill
ingness or incompetence, no matter how.
direct or indirect it may come. But I
want to say that I shall always be against
finding an indictment against any man
on any but legal grounds.
"There is no outside assistance needed
or called for and I think it's late in the
day to come here with any such cry as
this. I've had troubles and fignis enough
Eince this investigation began, but I am
In this investigation to work till the last
chapter is finished, no matter what impu
tations and no matter what source they
come from.
"If this matter is based upon any ques
tion of subpenas for witnesses 1 want to
ask your Honor to instruct the gentlemen
of the jury to hand in their lists of wit
nesses early and with addresses attached
and if necessary the whole police force will
be sent out to round them up. But in
stead they wait until the last minute, and
I can find no one if I have not time
enough to do so.''
Mr. Irving assured Mr. Dunne that he
had intended no imputation of neglect of
duty or incompetence. Quite the con
trary, but at the same time he pointed
out that two meetings had been adjourned
without result because witnesses had not
been haled into the jury room, and he
naturally laid it to the fact that Mr.
Dunne was doing at least three, if not
four, men's work.
Mr. Dunne bit his lip over this rejoin
der, but allowed Judge Belener to render
his decision. The Judge declared it a draw
and Instructed the Jury that thereafter it
should consider none but school matters
until the end of its term.
It is the intention of the jury to sit
every' night next week, it its witnesses
can be found. If not it is likely that this
regular annual school investigation will
wind up as have its regular annual pred
ecessors.
WHEN LOVE GROWS COLD.
Mrs. Mary Meyers Institutes Suit
for Divorce, Alleging Her Hus
band's Affection Has Waned.
After living: togetherâ to all outward ap
pearances happilyâ for three years, Mrs.
Mary Meyers yesterday commenced suit
for divorce from her husband, William
Meyers, alleging cruelty. From the com
plaint it appears that the couple were
married by contract three years ago. A
recent decision on the subject of contract
marriages aroused Mrs. Meyers' fears,
and she insisted, for the sake of her little
daughter, that they be married in accord
ance with the canona of the church.
This was on the 11th of last month, and
from that time forth a coolness developed
between the couple, which culminated in
yesterday's suit. The husband, it is al
leged, declared in the presence of friends

of the family that he did not love his wife
and was, in fact, tired of her.
In addition to this, the complaint alleges
that the husband had transferred his af
fections to another. He is charged with
entertaining a Miss Emily Wreath at din
ner at a well-known restaurant and with
paying her other attentions not in keeping
with his position. The husband is an em
ploye of the Union Iron Works. Mrs.
Meyers asks for $85 a month alimony, in
addition to her attorney's fees, and the
custody of the child.
TRIAL OF WALTER ROSSER.
His Prosecution Is Being Conducted
With More Vigor.
Walter Rosser, the youthful slayer of
Henry Hilderbrand, must make his fight
for liberty against greater odds than at
the first trial. The prosecution is con
ducting its case with more vigor, several
new witnesses have been summoned to
testify on behalf of the people and others
are being looked for.
Among the new witnesses that testified
yesterday are Stephen TTaverson and
John Diehl. Diehl insisted that the de
fendant on the day he entered the Spreck
els market and shot Hilderbrand was ex
tremely abusive, cursed those who were
waiting on him, helped himself to fruit
in C. M. Foster's stand and did many
things to provoke trouble. His state
ments are also corroborated in a measure
by Stephen Traverson. W. F. Londsay,
C. M. Foster, Dr. J. J. Gallagher, A. M.
Miller and John T. Baxter made the same
statements as on the first trial, to the ef
fect that the killing was unprovoked and
to them seemed a cold-blooded murder.
The case went over till Monday, owing to
the case of the forger Becker, which will
be disposed of by Judge Wallace this
morning.
FORTY-SEVEN MORE
DOCTORS OF MEDICINE
COMMENCEMENT EXERCISES AT
COOPER COLLEGE.
The Class of Ninety-Eight Bids Fare
well to Its Medical Alma
Mater.
Forty-seven young men and women
were presented with diplomas at Cooper
Medical College last night and the degree
of doctor of medicine conferred upon
them.
The auditorium of the big building waa
crowded long before the orchestra sound
ed the first strains of the overture, and
hundreds of people were turned away. At
a few minutes after 8 o'clock the orches
tra struck up a march, and the members
of the graduating class, preceded by the
faculty, filed in. There was a prayer by
Rev. William Rader, a musical selection,
and the veteran physician and president
of the college, Dr. L. C. Lane, stepped to
the front of the platform and, after a few
brief remarks, presented the diplomas and
launched another class out into the world.
The valedictory was delivered by Pro
fessor Stanley Stillman, M. D., one of the
faculty. He gave the graduates the cus
tomary amount of good and wholesome
advice and bade them the formal farewell
in behalf of the faculty. Mayor Phelan
gave a short talk on general topics, Rev.
William Rader pronounced the benedic
tion, and the class of '98 went out from
the college walls for the last time as a

The site will be the property now occu
pied by Wilson's restaurant on the north
side of Post street, west of Kearny, and
adjoining the Bohemian Club building.
The lot fronts 99 feet on Post street, with
a depth of 137 feet 6 inches. It is intended
to make the building an ornament to the
city.
The plans have not yet been formulated,
pending the decision as to who will occupy
the building when it is erected. When it
was given out that a building would be
erected there the estate received some
twenty bids for the lease of it. After a
time negotiations narrowed down to four
firms, chief among them being, it is af
firmed, W. J. Sloane & Co. and the Cali
fornia Furniture Company. When it is
determined who the tenants will be the
size of the building and other details will
be considered.
The intention is to lease It in Its en
tirety to one firm, making no provision for
office rooms. The representatives of the
Crocker estate are said to hold the opin
ion that the city is sufficiently supplied
with that class of buildings to meet the
demands to be made upon it for the next
ten years.
Bendix Recital.
Otto Bendix will give a piano recital
in the Sherman-Clay Hall this evening.

the best classical composers.

and dealers in lubricating oils, with offices
at 615 Front street, died yesterday at
Phoenix, Ariz., of pneumonia. A telegram
announcing his ueath was received during
the day by Manager T. J. Finch of the
firm from William Barrett, traveling man
ft.r J. A. Roebling & Co., who was with
Mr. Millar when the end came.
"Jack" Millar, as he was familiarly
called by his friends, was one of the best
known and most popular men in San
Francisco as well as on the Pacific Coast.
He came to this city about six years ago,
being transferred from St. Paul, where
he had entered the employ of the firm a
year previously. He had in that brief
period so thoroughly impressed his em

ployers with his ability that it was de
cided to transfer him to the coast, where '
he could have a larger field in which to |
exercise his talents and with increased ,
responsibilities. The wisdom of the move [
was quickly proved In the almost immedi- â 
ate increase in the firm's business in this '
section of the country. Mr. Millar's ter
ritory extended from Victoria, B. C, to
the Mexican border, and he made frequent
trips up and down the coast, establishing
new agencies, securing new customers
and holding the old ones in line.
It was while on a trip of this character
that he succumbed to the dread destroyer.
Mr. Millar was taken ill with pneumonia
in this city two months ago, and was con
fined to his bed for several weeks. He
was naturally robust, and of an active
temperament, and the confinement was i
extremely irksome. As soon as he was ;
able to move about he insisted on getting
out of doors, and otherwise neglected to
give himself the care that his condition
required. He had been making prepara
tions for one of his regular business trips
south when taken ill, and thinking that
the mild climate of the south might
hasten his recovery he decided to start at
once. He left San Francisco on November
15 but upon reaching Los Angeles suf
fered a relapse and was confined to his
room for ten days.
He recovered sufficiently to resume his
journey to Phoenix. Mr. Barrett accom
panied him on the trip and did every
thing possible for his comfort. But
against his advice Mr. Millar insisted on
taking the northern route, and when the
high altitudes were reached he collapsed
completely. At Jerome it was found ne
cessary to take him from the train. Ha
was given every possible care and at the
end of three days it was deemed safe for
him to resume his journey and he was put
aboard the train for Phoenix, where, with
additional facilities to be had, it was be
lieved^he would soon be on his feet again.
He arrived in Phoenix early in the pres
ent month, but the disease had obtained
too firm a hold and the beat efforts of
the physicians failed to restore his shat
tered health.
Mr. Millar's only relative on the coast
Is a brother, George E. Millar, traveling
man for the Anglo-American Crockery
Company. The latter was within a short
distance of Phoenix, where his brother
lay dying, but without knowing of his
presence or illness. Mr. Finch used the
wires freely yesterday in an effort to ac
quaint George of his brother's death, but
was unable to reach him, as he had start
ed on his return to San Francisco. A
telegram will probably reach him on his
arrival at Mojave, however.
Mr. Millar was a tine looking man, six
feet in height, well proportioned, and
about 34 years old. He was unmarried.

I have a friend, in fact he is my brother-in-law, who is the outside
man for a New York crockery warehouse, a sort of salesman, purchas-
ing agent, collector and what not He used to suffer from a catarrh
of the stomach. When he woke in the morning there would be a
gripping, a contraction, a tightness of the stomach, which, he said,
seemed to be clogged with a slimy, phfegm-like substance. Carlsbad
salts always did him some good, but now he uses a Ripans Ta6ule. He
only takes one when occasion requires, just one now and then. When
this man, his name is Scalding, was asked to describe the effect of the
Tabule on him, he said : "Why, it brightens me up. It has an effect
like dry air ; makes me feel something as I used to of a spring morning
when the air was crisp but tempered with sunshine. I dont kaow

CONDITION OF TRADE.
ALL ELEMENT? IN FAVOR OF A PROS
PEROUS YEAR.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"The month of December presents a situation
of "more than usual interest. Admittedly there
are important operators who will need to get
In a good amount of stocks if they are intend
ing to participate in a movement for a Janu
ary rise, and yet the conditions are not favor
able to their success in an attempt to depress
prices materially with that view. All condi
tions continue favorable to a high scale of
prices.
"The general trade of the country is more
than usually prosperous, in the great West
especially.
â¢The textile trades, which among the first
hand dealers have suffered a partial depres
sion, have at least reached a healthier rela
tb n "l-nween supply and demand.
"Th? exports of cereals, although beginning
to show the decline usual to this stage of the
season, are yet relatively upon an extraordi
nary scale.
"The railroads have all the freight they can
carry, and as evidence that their earnings are
not on a starving scale they have given out
orders within the last few days for 500,000 tons
of steel rails, valued at $9.(100,000.
"Our exports of manufactures continue to
expand rapidly. The surplus of goods beyond
what the home markets can absorb is finding
Its way to foreign countries at a still rapidly
increasing rate, with the result of relieving
the pressure of overproduction that has been
f"it in some of our most important branches
of industry.
"We have concluded a settlement with Spain
â without involving ourselves In any of the in
ternational complications which many have
feared, and, what Is still more gratifying, the
European powers show a marked desire to
maintain friondly relations with this country.
"The diplomatic ability shown by our nego
tiators at Paris and the remarÃlible financial
vigor exhibited by our Government under the
pressure of war finance can only tend to be
speak confidence abroad in the wisdom and
strength of the United States and to establish
foreign confidence In our investments.
"An engagement for the importation of $1,000,
000 of gold during the weekâ though outside
the ordinary range of exchange operationsâ ls
puggwtlvc that we are on the verge of a re
newal of the influx of the yellow metal.
"We are singularly exempt from the unset
tled feeling that ordinarily attends the as
sembling of Congress, for there are no im
pending measures of legislation of disturbing
Interest that are likely to come up for treat
ment.
"And. above all, the country Ib now ani
mated by a confidence and hopefulness such
as we have not witnessed for many years.
"So soon as Germany gets over her present
financial pinch and London becomes easier In
sympathy we may expect to see a nearer
equalization in money rates as between New
York and London, in which case gold will in
all probability flow hither in large volume
Tins legitimate flow of the yellow metal from
turope so soon after the close of our war with
fipaln. with the conditions which it represents
will show the position of this country to be
Bimply unique among nations. The war may
finally cost about $300,000,000. We have no"t
only met its requirements from our own re
eources, but at the same time have brought
other nations largely in our debt as a result
or the difference between our exports and im
ports.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Dec. Wheat opened â¢at un
changed prices for May. and a shade higher
for December. Liverpool at the time of trad
ing; here had lost a slight opening advance, but
Northwest receipts j were j considerably smaller
than last week's, although still running over
those of last. year. This for the " time being
held up the' liquidation! which became so promi
nent, especially in December, later in' the ses
sion and gave an appearance ; of firmness to
the market. Later , longs got > discouraged and
soon there was plenty of wheat i for sale from
every direction, December, suffering the most.
The selling of December was very heavy. At
lantic port exports of wheat" and flour were
large, 1,270,000 â  bushels, and this fact steadied
the market. I But there were plenty of bear in
fluences, not the least being the weakness
shown in coarser grains, and after the noon
hour the market turned weak again. - Foreign
crop reports were all favorable . and winter
wheat in this country was reported in promis
ing condition. Foreign markets were generally
weak at the close. In the last hour of trad
ing a good deal of wheat .was sold on stop
loss orders and buying was very . scattered to
ward the close.; May declined to'64%c and
closed at that price. December declined to 63c
and closed at t3'.Â»p.
Corn showed a little strength lat the start,
continued light receipts during favorable ship
ping weather having a bullish effect. But the
market very soon turned weak and remained
bo to the close. Country advices stated that
new corn would soon move more : freely. May
closed %{?*4c lower. .
Oats were weak in sympathy with corn, May
closing %c lower. . . ' -
. Provisions had another heavy run of hogs
to contend â  with, but held I remarkably | steady
notwithstanding. The market was strong dur
ing the morning, there being good local . sup
port, while outside buying orders were numer
ous. Realizing and more liberal - selling by
packers caused prices to decline later, but the
market at no . time â¢ showed . weakness. VAt the
close May pork â  and ribs were 2'4c lower and
May lard 5c lower, r . . ; - Â â  â  fr-.v;Â»

CALIFORNIA RAISINS IN NEW YORK.
NEW YORK, Deo. 8. -The Journal of Com
merce says: Whether the Raisin Growers'
Association carried out its avowed purpose of
eliminating packers and middlemen as factors
in their business at the meeting which was
called for December 5 or whether the meeting
was held or not does not seem to be known to
Eastern handlers of the California product.
In the absence of definite information it has
been assumed by some here that the associa
tion has concluded not to make un experiment
which would mean a radical departure from
the accepted methods of distributing the Cali
fornia raisin crop, and which, possibly, would
result in the adoption of retaliatory measures
on the part of packers and commission mer
chants that would undermine the position at
tained by growers through their assm-lat inn.
It has been hinted that one reason why grnwcis
may have concluded not to push their opera
tions in the direction contemplated is that they
feel that they cannot afford at present to an
tagonize their friends in the Bast in view
ut the prospect of the withdrawal of the pro*
tection accorded to California raisin producers
in the high duty on Grecian currant.". This
is indicated by telegrams received to-day from
the coast from prominent groweri urging tln-lr
representatives here to uee their Influent-.- with
Congress to prevent the abrogation of tin- Inly
on currants, on the ground that It Is virtually
necessary for a perpetuation of tho California
raisin industry that this duty BQOttld be iv
tained. Among handlers of dried fruits ht>re,
however, there appears to be a sentltm*nt In
favcr of restoring currants to the free list or
at least for a modification of the duty.
Whatever action, if any, be tnkon by grow
ers on the proposition of President K> arnry
will, it is stated, have no Influence upon tho
market until next season.

THE Botkln jury is completed, and
the trial will begin on Monday
morning at 10 o'clock. Both sides
consented to a recess from yester
day, as it is now certain the case will not
last a week, and it was thought, desirable
not to have an interruption in the testi
mony. Mrs Botkin will be the only wit
ness placed on the stand by the de
fense.
After the opening statement by the
prosecution yesterday Attorney Knight
declared that even with the extra latitude
grained Mr. Hosmer. who mentioned
many things which will not be admitted
as evidence, no case could be made
against the defendant.
Only one session of court was held yes
terday, ami the proceedings were un
broken by any startling incident. The
Assistant District Attorney Hosmer Opens the People's Case Against Mrs. Botkin.
spectators listened attentively to the
opening statement by District Attorney
Hnsmer, and were deeply disappointed at
the lack of a sensation. Mrs. Botkin sat
in her usual pi" "c calm, cheerful and at
tentive. Occasionally the lines about her
mouth would tighten, but only for an in
stant. During the portion of the state
ment dealing with her relations ! th
Dunning she sat defiantly erect, and ap
peared angered rather than ashamed.
Dunning was also an unperturbed 1 stener
to the story outlined by 3Ut. Hosmer, in
which he is to fill the details. During Mr.
Hosmer's speech George Knight shifted
his chair several times, and finally located
at the entrance to the jury box, where
he had a good view of the speaker. He
paid strict attention to every word, and
was ready to junrn in with an objection if
m-' 1 ' -sary.
The twelfth juror needed to complete
the panel was secured in fifteen minutes
yesterday morning. H. J. Burns, a capi
talist, living at 3335 Seventeenth street,
was the third talesman examined and,
proving acceptable to the people and the
defense, he was sworn in. A murmur of
relief from the spectators followed the
completion of the jury and the attorneys
shifted their seats and prepared for the
actual beginning of the trial.
Juror Marcuse desired to be excused
from serving and he attempted to secure
a dismissal by Imitating Colonel J. S.
Young, whose conscience would not per
mit him to try the case. Marcuse ad
dressed the Judge, saying his mind was
in such a condition that be did not feel
fjualified to act. His Honor would not
listen to him, and the unwilling juror dis
gustedly resumed his seat.
Clerk Tolle then read the indictment
charging Mrs. Botkin with the murder of
Mrs. John P. Dunning. At 10:20 Assist
ant District Attorney Hosmer began the
opening statement for the prosecution,
lie spoke for fifty minutes without an at
tempt at oratory and was only inter
rupted once by Mr. Knight. Mr. Hosmer
was indicating what the prosecution ex
pected to prove by the handwriting and
he said John B. Bennlngton was satis
fied that the anonymous letter sent from
this city and thp writing on the box of
candy were by the same hand. Knight's
objection that this was an improper state
ment was sustained and Mr. Hosmer re-
sumed.
In the opening statement Mr. Hosmer
reviewed all the evidence which was con
tained In the affidavits presented to Gov
ternor Budd when the defendant's extra
dition was requested by the State of Dela
ware. The prosecution did not foreshadow
an* new evidence. Mr. Hosmer said:
"May it please the court and you, gen
tlemen of the jury: In support of the in
dictment you- have Just heard read the
people expect to show a state of facts as
follows:
"The evening mail which arrived at
Dover, Del., on the 9th of August last con
tained a package, which will be identified,
addressed to Mrs. John P. Dunning. This
package was taken from the mailbag by
the Postmaster and placed in the box of
Abe jacobs,
w. b. harrington,
jacob heyman.
John f. myers,
edward a. keil.
h. j: burns.
J. B. Pennington, father of the deceased.
j A few moments later the grandson of J.
i B. Pennington got the package and took it
home. The Pennington family at that
time consisted of himself, his wife, his
! two daughters and his two grandchildren,
i the young daughter of Mrs. Dunning and
i Mrs. Deane, and Joshua D. Deane. The
; members of the family ate their supper, |
! and none were sick thereafter. Then Mrs. i
i Dunning and her daughter went out on |
the veranda and the package was handed
;to the mother. She looked at the wrap
per, but did not recognize the handwrit- I
ing thereon. She then opened it, and j
found a pink box, oblong in shape, across i
the top of which was inscribed the word, I
'bonbons.' Opening the box. she found
a note reading, 'With love to yourself and
babyâ Mrs. C; a handkerchief with a 25- i
cent price mark thereon and a quantity of !
| mixed chocolate candy, consisting of cara
j mels and hard and soft pieces of different
| shapes and sizes.
"Mrs. Dunning endeavored to ascertain
the sender's name, but could not. About
the time the box was opened Mrs. Deane
and her daughter, Leila, Miss Ethel Mil
lington. Miss Josephine Bateman and Mr.
and Mrs. Pennington came out on
the porch. The canay was passed around
and all partook of it. Mrs. Pennington
found the candy ill tasting and spat it
out, and Mrs. Dunning's child ate only
the small hard pieces with white drops on
them. That night Mrs. Deane and Mrs.
Dunning were taken ill with vomiting,
retclitng and abdominal pains. The fol
lowing morning a physician was called
to administer to them and to Leila Deane
and Harry Pennington, who had also be
come sick later at night. Mrs. Deane
lived from the 9th to the evening of the
nth of August, and Mrs. Dunning died on
the 12th. Leila Deane was sick three days
and recovered. Harry Pennington and
Ethel Mlllington were sick all the day of
the 10th. Miss Bateman, after leaving
the Pennington home, found a foreign
substance imbedded in her gums and the
following day she was also sick. During
the sickness of those who partook of the
candy Mr. Pennington went to Mrs. Dun
ning and asked her where the remainder
of the candy had been placed. She told
him 'on top of the secretary.' He found
it there with the note, handkerchief and
wrapper. He looked at the superscrip
tion on the wrapper and was struck by
the resemblance it bore to certain letters
he had at his office, of which I shall
speak later.
"A little later he gave the box and con
tents to the physician who attended his
daughters, and the latter gave three
pieces of the candy to Dr. Wolf, a chem
ist, who made an analysis and found 11 to
12 grains of arsenic in the three pieces.
After this had been done the Coroner's
jury at Dover found that Mrs. Deane
and Mrs. Dunning had come to their
death by arsenical poisoning. Then the
box candy, handkerchief and writing
were passed to the Attorney General of
Delaware, and by him to Bernard J. Mc-
Vey who brought the articles to this city
and delivered them to Chief of Police
Lees. These exhibits are now in the
same condition as they were when
brought here.
"We expect to show by Mr. Penning
ton that in the spring of 1897 he obtained
a letter addressed to Mrs. Dunning which
had been sent from San Francisco. She
read the letter, which was anonymous,
and called her father's attention to it.
The letter contained charges against her
husband, and on the advice of her father
she sent a copy to Mr. Dunning, who was
then in Salt Lake. Shortly afterward an
other anonymous letter reached Dover,
and she again consulted her father, re
questing him, if any more letters of that
nature came, to keep them and not show
them to her. During the summer a third
letter came, which he kept in his office.
When he compared these writings with
the address on the wrapper around the
candy box he was satisfiedâ"
"I object," interrupted Mr. Knight.
"That is an improper statement to a
jury." The objection was sustained and
Mr. Hosmer resumed:
"We expect to show that John P. Dun
ning was living in San Francisco in 1895,
and he then became acquainted with Mrs.
Cordelia Botkin, the defendant. An inti
macy sprang up between them and they
were frequently in each other's society. In
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, FBIDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1898.
1596 Mrs. Dunning returned to her father's
home and the intimacy between J. P.
Dunning and the defendant continued. He
went to 927 Geary street, where she lived,
and secured a room there, and they often
occupied the same apartment. This ex
isted till the spring of 1897. when Dunning
went to Bait Lake. While there he re
ceived a copy of the anonymous letter
sent to his wife, and he forwarded it to
Mrs. Botkln. In the summer Dunning
returned to San Francisco and resumed
his relations with Mrs. Botkin, who was
then living at the Victoria Hotel. She
informed him she had been divorced from
her husband, who lived in Stockton.
About the time of the opening of the
Spanish war Dunning received a telegram
calling him to New York. Mrs. Botkln ac
companied him across the bay to Oak
land, where they separated. Dunning met
his wife at Philadelphia and thence pro
ceeded to Florida and to the war.
"We expect to show that Dunning wrote
to Mrs. Botkin from New York that he
Intended to rejoin his family and reside in
that city. About June 1. 1898, the defend
ant went from the Victoria Hotel to the
Owl drug store in this city and bought
two ounces of arsenic, telling the drug
clerk she wished to clean some straw
hats. The clerk informed her there were
other chemicals better to use for that
purpose, but she persisted and was given
arsenic. About the same time a person
answering the description of Mrs. Botkin
purchased arsenic at the Star drug store.
"On the 27th of July last the defendant
went to Stockton, where* her husband re
sided. She was under the weather and
while there talked with Mrs. Bauof, a
nurse, about poison, and made inquiries
as to the quantities of strychnine and ar
senic necessary to kill a person. She also
asked the nurse about rates of postage
on packages and said she intended
sending a package north and inquired if
a person sending a registered parcel had
to sign his name. Then she asked if one
had to tell a doctor or a lawyer the truth
when engaged professionally. We ex
pect to show by the testimony of Mrs.
Rauof that Mrs. Botkin at that time re
marked that she and Dunning were to
become closer than ever before and we
also expect to show by Mrs. Rauof the in
timacy which existed between the de
fendant and the husband of the woman
she is alleged to have poisoned.
"The defendant returned from Stockton
to this city July 30 and went to the Vic
toria Hotel. On the morning of the 31st
she professed to be ill and had breakfast
served In her room. That afternoon a
woman answering her description went
into the candy store of George Haas, on
Market street, near the terminus of the
car line which passes the Victoria Hotel,
and asked the young lady clerk to hurry
and get her a box of chocolate. She
wanted a fancy box and the clerk went
across the store and got a box which was
satisfactory. This party asked the clerk
not to completely fill the box, as she
wished to put something else in it. In
stead of charging the usual price the
clerk only charged 40 cents, because the
box was not full. The clerk wrapped the
box in tissue paper and placed a seal on
it and then wrapped it in a piece of paper
identical with that which inclosed the
poisoned candy sent to Delaware.
"We expect to show that the candy sent
to Delaware was made by Haas, who with
his employes will identify it. On the aft
ernoon of July 31 Mrs. Botkin was seen
going to her room by the landlady of the
Victoria Hotel, who was surprised to see
her lodger about, as she was supposed to
be sick.
"We purpose to show that Mrs. Bot
kin was in the City of Paris dry goods
store and bought a handkerchief identical
in texture with the one sent to Delaware
and similarly marked. We will show that
in the room occupied by Mrs. Botkin at
the Victoria was found a portion of. a seal
which came from Haas' store.
"On August 4 Mrs. Botkin left the hotel
to go to St. Helena, and wrote a letter
to Mrs. Price to forward her mail. We
expect to show that in the early part of
August there was mailed at the ferry a
package addressed to Mrs. John P. Dun
ning, which arrived at Dover bearing a
San Francisco postmark dated August 4.
John Dunnigan, a postal clerk of this
city, handled the package and was struck
by the similarity of names.
"We will show that Mrs. Botkin went
to St. Helena and from there crossed
over to Healdsburg and at the latter place
received the news of Mrs. Dunning's
death. She was interviewed by Miss Liv
ernash, a newspaper woman, who will
swear to conversation which took place
between them, in which the defendant
spoke of her love for Dunning, and of an
admission that she would probably be
suspected of the murder of his wife. Mrs.
BotKin then went to Stockton accompa
nied by Miss Livernash. and there a
stormy scene took place between husband
and wife. Mr. Botkin's son told Miss Liv
ernash that 'Jack Dunning loves my
mother.'i
"We expect to show by handwriting ex
perts that the anonymous letters, the ad
dress on the package and the note within
the candy box are all in the handwriting
of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin.
"Gentlemen," said Mr. Hosmer, in con
clusion, "if we prove these facts we shall
expect a verdict of murder in the first de
gree against the defendant."
When Mr. Hosmer finished Attorney
Knight arose, and after a short consulta
tion with the prosecution moved for an
adjournment until Monday. Judge Cook
acquiesced and after the jury received the
usual instructions court was adjourned
and Mrs. Botkin went back to the County
Jail.
D. G. McClure, Mrs. Botkin's brother
in-law, sat with her yesterday. Her hus
band and son have not, so far, appeared
at the trialâ ln fact, she has not seen her
son since she was arrested.

The Deadly Technicality.
The Superior Court of Modoc County
made an error in admitting certain evi
dence in the case of James Cuff, accused
of having attempted to murder a man
named Miller by strychnine poison. The
two persons were the suitors for the hand
or favors of a girl named Miss Lush, and
Miller was the more favored. One day
he bÂ»iame very sick and an investiga
tlon showed that he had been poisoned,
the deadly crystals having been placed in
his sugar. All of the evidence connecting
Cuff with the crime was of a most cir
cumstantial nature and the court seemed
to allow the prosecution unusual latitude
in introducing evidence showing a motive.
In so doing it committed an error that
caused the higher court to reverse the
Judgment and order and direct that the
case be retried.
MORE SHORTAGES IN
M'GLADE'S ACCOUNTS
HE FORGED NINE WARRANTS
DURING JULY.
Realized $832 by His Last Theft.
Derham Says He Never Signed
the Claims.
Pete McGlade must face more of his
own wrongdoing. The comparison of the
Auditor's books with the warrants of tue
Street Department was finished yesterday
and at the last moment it developed an
other shortage in the defaulting deputy's
accounts â this time of $832.
The methods pursued by McGlade were
the same as in the first cases charged
against himâ wholesale forgery, perjury
and fraudâ and, as in the first instances,
evidences of the participation In his
crimes by others whose names the police
have not yet been able to discover. The
$832 secured was taken from the treasury
on nine fraudulent names during the
month of August. The warrants were all
made out to fictitious names, and signed
by McGlade himself. They also bore the
signature of Charles Derham, another of
the deputies in the Street Department:
but when seen yesterday Derham declared
that in each case the signature had been
forged.
The fictitious names to which McGlade
issued his latest bunch of warrants are:
J. Kelley $80 60; T. Dwyer $92. O. Gould
$92: William Magee $92: C. Murphy $92,
J. Sullivan $92, H. Swords $92, W. Hanra
han $100, J. Tierney $100.
Mayor Phelan has laid the case of Mc-
Glade before the Grand Jury.
BALDWIN FIRE DISCUSSED.
Complaints Against Obstructions Re
ferred to Chief Sullivan and
the Fire Wardens.
The Fire Commissioners at their meet
ing yesterday afternoon appointed John
J. Kenny hoseman of engine 8, and John
Flynn truckman of truck 5.
A communication was read from the
Merchants' Association intimating that it
would award a gold medal yearly for pre
sentation to a member of the department
for bravery in saving life, and a vote of
thanks was passed to the association.
A communication was also read from
the association complaining against the
obstruction on the sidewalk caused by
the Baldwin Hotel fire, and it was refer
red to the Chief and Fire Wardens to take
action.

DUAL LIFE
OF BRANDES
DISCLOSED
Testimony Showing
Him a Bigamist.
FIRST WIFE ON THE STAND
MRS. M. ARELLANES BRANDES
WAS NEVER DIVORCED.
JRamon Arana Tells of Murderous
Threats Made by the Accused
Against Lillian About
a Year Ago.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 8.
Just one week njxo to-day the hearing
of William A. Brandes, charged with the
murder of his 13-year-old daughter, was
commenced before Justice Fred C. ("lift,
and the end of that period is marked by
another startling disclosure concerning
the dual life of the accused. A climax. in
fact, was reached at to-day's hearing
When Mrs. M. Arellanes Brandos gave
testimony which brands the prisoner a
bigamist.
.Mrs. M. A. Brandes was supposed to be
the first wife of the accused man: she was
the mother of the murdered Lillian. On
the witness stand to-day she made the
startling statement that she was never
divorced from her husband.
In the face of this the accused has here
tofore maintained all along that the
â¢woman with whom he lived at Berkeley,
who is also charged with murder, is his
wife. He has always introduced her as
such.
When Mrs. M. Arellanes Brandes was
put on the stand to-day she said: "I live
In San Francisco. I have known the ac
cused Bince 1882, when 1 became his wife.
Th.- ceremony was performed by Father
Mcl&enomy in Santa Cruz on March ID
of that year. The witnesses were Mrs.
Gamble, formerly Mrs. Chappel, and
Manuel Sarrairu-ntos. I lived with
Brandes four years and then separated
from him."
"Have you been divorced?" asked Dep
uty District Attorney Allen.
The witness answered -No."
"You are stili bis witY. then?" continued
tin questioner, and the witness answered
"Yes."
Attorney Sawyer, on behalf of the de
fens4 , here moved that the witness' testi
mony be stricken out because he deemed
it Irrelevant, incompetent and immaterial.
Prosecutor Allen, however, objected to
Bucb course, stating that he had discon
tinued the examination as soon as he dis
covered that the witness was still
Brandes wife. Justice Cllft thereupon
admitted, the testimony, but the witness
was not questioned further.
This morning Ramon Arana, a cousin of
the murdered girl, was put on the stand.
He had known Brandes about sixteen
years and had met him at Santa Cruz
about the time of his marriage to his first
wife. He had met him again in June or
July of last year, during the military en
campment at Santa Cruz.
"I had a conversation at that time with
Brand, s concerning his daughter Lillian, '
continued witness. "He said he was go
ing to call upon the girl and see how she
was getting along; that he would leave
her where she was at present, but when
Bhe got older he was going to take her
away and educate her. He would not
nave her do as the rest had done, but
would have her do as he wished. If she
did not he said he would kill her. I do
not kniiw whom he meant by "the rest,'
but I suppose he meant his wife and oth
er members of his famiiy. He did not
Btate to me whom he meant.
"I have known Mrs. M. A. Brandes
since her marriage to W. A. Brandes in
Banta Cruz. Lillian, their daughter, at
tended the same school as my daughter
and they used to play together. Lillian
Was a timid little girl, with a sweet dis
position. She was the very picture of
her father 1 used to think. 1 saw her
last about a year ago when she was re-
Hiding with Mrs. Chappel, an aunt of
Mrs. Brandes."
John E. Streightif. Deputy Coroner at
Berkeley, way also called this afternoon.
3l> . too, proved an important witness. He
testified that hi- was notified by Dr.
Whitwojth on November 19 at about 3
o'clock that Lillian Hrandes had taken
j'Oison ami had hanged herself. At the
house he found the body lying upon the
bed; (here were two apron string
in a knot -hanging from one of the tx l
)Â»>sis; there was an abrasion on the left
< heck and two smaller ones beneath it.
â¢'The neck," said the witness, "was also
badly marked. The outer skin on either
side had been broken; the hands were
covered with marks. Brandes told me,"
Bald the witness, "that the marks u.-r.
made by the girl herself in bumping
against the bedpost."
Witness next testified to having discov
ert 'I black and blue marks'upon the body
and the lower limbs, which Brandes had
told him were the result of a whipping
administered by his wife. The w.
next gave a brief account of the post
mortem examination, the fa< ts < or.
ing which were brought out at the In
quest.
The next witness of the day was Robert
J. Wright, a Berkeley baker, who testi
fied that the murdered girl had opened a
door and called to him by name on the
Thursday prior to her death. She wished
to borrow a dollar. She was in her night
gown and appeared badly scared. The
Witness noticed abrasions on her cheeks
und left temple at the time.
At this stage the hearing was continued
until to-morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock.
Brandes has taken time by the forelock,
for to-night, at the County Jail, he stated
that h<- was never married to the woman
who is also charged with murder. Aside
from this simple statement he refused to
talk. It will be remembered, perhaps,
that during the past few years he has
introduced Etta Brandes as his wife, and
when Deputy Sheriff White arrested him
at his home in Berkeley he expressed the
greatest anxiety and fear lest his "poor
vjt'e would commit suicide."
"When the reporter was ushered into
the women's corridor at the County Jail
to-night Mrs, Etta Brandes. who had been
seated around a table with other female
prisoners reading papers, ran into her
cell, pulled the door shut and wished to
have it understood that she had retired.
She was finally induced to step out. but
declined to ansWH r any <piestlons bearing
or her relations with Brandes.
"1 refuse to say one word." said the
prisoner, "because nearly every time my
attorneys have called on me they have
found me talking to reporters. I have
*,*â¢ '-. Limed too much, and my attor
neys have instructed me not to say any
thing more. "What's the use of having
Counsel when you don't follow their in
structions?"
She absolutely refused to say even
whether she and Brandes were ever mar
ried or not. It is now intimated that the
prosecution will put her on the stand.
Should it then be proved that a ceremony
whs performed, her testimony would be
barred and Brandes' status as a bigamist
will be established. Should it develop
that she is not Brandes' wife, her testi
mony may be of more importance at this
stage of the proceedings than it was ever
expected it could be.
No Clew to Hammer.
ALAMEIjA. JJ(-c. ,s. â The disappearance
of Louis Rammer is still involved in mys
tery. The impression that the man did
not commit suicide is gaining ground. The
Bpot where he is supposed to have jumped
from Bay Farm Island into the bay is
surrounded by shoals, and it would have
been almost impossible for the body to
have floated into the bay. At low tide the
place is a vast expanse of mud flats.
Boatmen made a thorough searth to-day
of the shores and sloughs of Bay Farm
Island, but discovered nothing. The chan
nel leading into San Leandro Bay was
also dragged, but Kammer's remains were
not found.
MRS, YATES
NOT ANXIOUS
FOR DIVORCE
Her Suit Develops a
Sensation.
SECRETS TOLD TO FRIENDS
WAS INDUCED TO BELIEVE SHE
SHOULD BE FREE.
Has Sent a TelegTam From Montreal
Promising to Explain All to
the Oakland Psychic
Society.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec 8.
To-days developments in the divorce
proceedings of Madame Montague, the
psychic lecturer, otherwise Mrs. Yates,
. are of a very sensational nature. Mrs.
j Yates, it now appears, was induced by
; strong influences to revive the proceed
: ings in the court and to give her testi
mony, although she confided to all her
friends the fact that she did not wish adi
j vorce, and that not long ago her husband
[ wrote to her from Canada and paved the
way for a reconciliation. Alas, some ot
! the letters written by Mme. Montague
have been intercepted and the informa
1 tion they contain has been made known
- to the members of the Oakland Psychic
( Society for whom it was not intended.
Yesterday a telegram was received by
I the society from Mrs. Montague Yates
; stating that a letter would follow setting
; forth all the details of this interesting
' case. The testimony given by Mrs. Yates
two days before her departure has not
yet been handed to the court, and it is
understood that the plaintiff has ordered
all the proceedings to be dropped.
The strange part of the case is that
Mrs. Yates told her most intimate friends
: that she was opposed to being legally
'â  separated from her husband. Some
months ago Mrs. Yates received informa
tion that Captain Montague Yates was
endeavoring to secure an appointment
that would enable him to provide for his
wife* This information was conveyed by
Mme. Montague Yates to some friends
both by letter and telegraph, but neither
reached their destination, and a little
later the information was known to all
1 the societies. Mme. Montague is posl
; tive that the letters were intercepted,
and that she has been subjected to es
pionage for several months. On one occa
i sion she rebuked a prominent member of
the society for watching hor movements.
He admitted that he had been spying up
on her.
I After it became known that Mme. lion
1 tague was likely to be reconciled to her
< husband, from whom she had been lieving
apart for a couple of years, extraordinary
â¢ pressure was brought to bear on her by
! prominent members of the society. It was
1 represented to her that she was inspired;
: that her position was far superior to that
(if any other spiritualistic lecturer in the
: country, and that it was not advisable for
. her to be hampered with a husband with
j whose thoughts she was not in commu
; nion and who did nothing to support her.
! Finally Mme. Montague's health was so
j broken down that she was ordered to a
| complete change of scenery, and she de
| cided to go and be near her husband.
This decision on her part was confided

in the mean time Mrs. Montague agreed
i to give her testimony in the divorce case.
I She was assured that the whole matter
! would be conducted with secrecy and
' that there would be nothing on record to
: show what she was doing. The madame's
; acquaintance on both sides of the bay is
| so large, however, that secrecy was im
possible, and her romantic life from the
time of her first marriage became a mat
ter of general interest.
Mme. Montague said very recently that
the mistakes of her husband had been
those of the head and not of the heart,
! and that she was quite willing to give
I him another chance. The idea of ever ap
pearing in public as a divorcee was very
repugnant to her, and after giving her
! testimony she expressed regret that she
I had done so, and told her friends that she
I would wire instructions at once to have
: the suit quashed.
Mme. Montague is now in Montreal.
: Her husband is also said to be in Mon
treal, and although there is no positive
knowledge among members of the so
i ciety, It is generally believed that they
have arrived at some understanding.

M. A. Kennedy, a brother of the de
ceased, Just escaped meeflpg .he fate of
the superintendent. He had accepted the
offer of foreman of the gelatine house,
and was to have assumed his duties on
the morning after the explosion. He is
a chemist, and after a few days' tuition
with hi? brother, the superintendent, M.
A. Kennedy would have been in charge
of the fated house. He has now aban
doned all idea of accepting the position.
The inquest on the remains of the vic
tims was held at San Pablo to-day.
BLACK-BORDERED LETTER
WRECKED HIS MIND
OAKLAND, Dec. B.â News of the death of his brother in Chicago, con
veyed in a black-bordered envelope, has wrecked the mind of John
Keefe, and he now labors under the hallucination that he, too, is
dead. This afternoon Superior Judge Ogden committed the man to the
Ukiah Insane Asylum.
Keefe Is a stevedore, and resided at a boarding-house on Howard street,
San Francisco. He left there yesterday afternoon, and at 9 o'clock in the
rvening engaged a room in the Girard House, this city. During the night
he became violent, and Officer Curtis was summoned. A lively tussle in
the hallway ensued, and Keefe managed to pour out upon the officer ten
gallons of milk contained in two five-gallon cans that stood in the hall,
thereby ruining the officer's uniform. When Officer Curtis first ap
proached the man the latter was pouring water upon himself, declaring
that thereby he might learn whether or not he was dead. Keefe was im
mediately taken to the Receiving Hospital, where the Commissioners of
Lunacy examined him. ,
"The black letter upset Mr. Keefe's mind," said Mrs. McManus, who
came across the bay this afternoon to see the lunatic. "You see, his
brother had not been very well, and was on his way out here for his
health, and when John received the black letter announcing the death
recently, he began acting queerly. First he tried hard not to believe the
sad news. Yesterday he gave up, and said: 'Well, it's all over; brother's
dead, and it's all up with John, too.' Then he started in destroying his
belongings, saying he would never have further use for them, 'because,'
he would say, 'I am dead. What's the use? John is gone. I knew death
was after me, and I have danced to keep it away until I had to give it i
up. Yes. John is dead,' meaning himself, of course. The next thing T knew
he was out of the house and off, and to-day I heard of his being arrested i
over here." ,
THE SAN THAIS CISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1898.
COCKERS AND
COLLIES ON
EXHIBITION
First Specialty Show
in Oakland.
THE JUDGING OF COCKERS
COLLIES WILL BE PUT TO THE
SCORE-CARD TEST.
Results of the Judging in the Poul
try Department â An Unusual
Number of Good
Entries.
OAKLAND, Dec. B.â The first spe
cialty show ever held in California
opened in Oakland to day and was
unqualifiedly a howling success in
every respect. Thanks to Secretary
Stewart's timely recovery from an attack
of ague, the show was at the last moment
responsive to the touch of a master hand.
Able assistance was rendered in the ring
by Messrs. Harker and Berret. The show
is benched by Spratfs patent, and the
dogs fed by the same firm, which attends
also to the disinfection. It goes without
saying that the building Is devoid of ill
odors and that the kennels are clean and
sweet smelling. Thomas Banks repre
sents the firm with his usual efficiency,
and is prodigal both with the food and
disinfectants.
To bench show veterans the greatest
surprise lay in the judging. Mr. Tyler of
Pasadena has surpassed the fondest hopes
of those who expected the most from
him. He has long enjoyed the renown
of being the most capable poultry judge
of the coast, but his discriminating fac
ulties in canines were a revelation. In
the cocker class, with twenty-two entries,
there was not one that could be fairly
criticized. Trilby, Mr. Carlton's cocker
bitch, was defeated in the winners' class
by Tootsie W, an Inferior dog, but the
judgment was a fair one, as Trilby was
show far too fat to be properly benched.
To-morrow will see the great test ap
plied to Judge Tyler's power of discrim
ination, when for the first time in the
history of the Pacific Coast the score card
will be used to place the all-aged collies
in their order of merit. This is an inno
vation well worth witnessing, as many
forebodings have been expressed by ex
perts as to its practicability. The show is
noteworthy as being the first held under
the Pacific Kennel League's classification.

FACTIONS ARE AT
WORK IN POLITICS
EVIDENT THAT PARTY LINES
WILL NOT PREVAIL.
The Last Experiment With Ap
pointed Delegates Was Not
an Example Worth Fol
lowing.
Oakland Office San Francisco Cail,
908 Broadway, Dec. 8.
The Seventh Ward Republican Club has
taken the initiative in the matter of call
ing a municipal convention to name a
city ticket. At last night's meeting the
club passed the following resolution:
Whereas, there is no law in .this State gov
erning primary elections, thus rendering It
practically impossible to prevent persons from
voting mere than once, or to prevent persons
of other political affiliations from voting at
our Republican primaries, and in this manner
defeating the will of a majority of our Re
publican voters: it is therefore
RMOlved, That the Seventh Ward Republican
Club hereby d*>cl?res itself in favor of the
iippcintmer.t of delegates n the Republican
city ennventinn. and that the Republican Cen
tral Commlttwman from the Seventh Ward.
llcin George R. Williams, be requested to use
his best efforts to secure the selection of dele
gate? to said fity convention in the manner
heretnabove indicated.
It is now evident that there will be a
hot campaign. The Municipal League is
at work, many of the leading Republicans
favor the holding of primaries, and now
the strong Seventh Ward Club has come
out in favor of an appointed relegation.
There is not. however, unanimity in the
Seventh Ward over this matter, for J. AY .
Eyans ox-president of the School Board,
refers to the present city administration
as an example of the result of an ap
pointed convention, and declares it to be,
if anything, inferior to the city govern
ments nominated at conventions called by
primaries.
Mr Evans believes there should be a
Republican primary. He says that there
have been honest primaries in the past,
and there is no reason why th^ should
not be honest primaries In the future.
From the present outlook it can now
be safely predicted that the city cam
paign will be a scramble for office along
lines based on personal ambition and lo
ral "influences, rather than on party
lines.
ALAMEDA'S MURDERESS.
Mrs. Mentel Will Be Defended by W.
"W. Foote.
OAKLAND, Dec. 8.-Mrs. Anna Mentel
has engaged Attorney W. W. Foote to
make her defense. Mr. Foote called on
his fair client to-day at the County Jail
and announced that he would represent
the prisoner in the criminal proceedings.
The arraignment and preliminary exam
ination have been set for next Monday
afternoon before Justice- Morris of Ala
meda Owing to Mrs. Mentel's condition
it has been decided to have the arraign

to prevent unnecessary trips between the
County Jail and the Alameda court
Mrs. Mentel expresses no desire to dis
cuss the relations that existed between
her and her late husband. She still re
mains in bed. although she has greatly
improved since being taken to the nail, and
there is now no danger of anything seri
ous resulting from the bullet wound on
her head.

W. F. HERRIN'S HONOR
AND COL. BURNS' RECORD
An Effort to Drag the Name of a
Philanthropic and Kindly Lady
Into the Mire.
A YOLO COUNTY GHOST REFUSES TO BE LAID.
Interesting Excerpts From a Report of the State *Con=
troller â The Examiner's Latest Move in
Behalf of Its Senatorial
Candidate.
Colonel Dan Burns has not yet taken
the public into his confidence with ref
erence to his wishes in the matter of
the Senatorial plum. He is so busy di
recting the efforts of his satellites who
are engaged in the work of trying to
whip legislators into line for their
boss that he cannot find time to make
up his mind as to what course he shall
pursue with the public at large. To be
sure, the general public cannot vote for
Senator, and legislators can, but this
fact probably has no particular weight
with Colonel Burns.
It will be remembered that some
days ago W. F. Herrin, in a burst of
confidence Inspired by circumstances
that were to him somewhat embarrass
ing, declared that Burns is the rail
road's candidate for Senator. About
the same time Colonel Burns was inter
viewed on the subject and declared that
he is not yet a candidate, though he
confessed, with a certain show of in
genuousness, that the only reason for
his hesitancy in accepting the position
and starting for Washington was his
inability to decide off-hand whether or
not he wanted the Job. This astonish
ing declaration was taken with proper
seriousness, for, as every one knows,
the colonel Is fond of his little joke,
even when the victims of his rare hu
mor happen to be the electors of so
great a State as California.
While Colonel Burns has been toying
with fate and striving to forget the
past his friend Herrin has not been idle.
The political Pooh Bah of the Southern
Pacific Company has sent his agents
and emissaries to every quarter of the
State and used all of the available
power of the great corporation that em
ploys him in an endeavor to pledge leg
islators to vote for Burns for Senator.
With the fine sense of honor that led
him to lie publicly in order to cover up
a blunder into which he had been led,
he has sought to strengthen his forces
and those of Colonel Burns by dragging
before the public the name of a lady
who is known and loved from one end
of the State to the other.
It is needless to say that Mrs. Stan
ford has not taken, and does intend to
take any interest in the selection of a
United States Senator, other than that
of an onloker who has the welfare of
the State and its people at heart. Yet
Mr. Herrin, with a display of honor
and chivalry that would put a Sioux j
Indian to the blush, has dragged this
lady's name into the controversy, hop
ing, no doubt, to gain a temporary ad
vantage by distracting attention for the
moment from the despicable and crimi
nal methods by which he is seeking to
throw dust in the eyes of the public
and gain for a man 'with an unspeak
able record a seat in the Senate of the
United States.
The Indian brave, who beats his
squaw to prove his prowess as a war
rior, appears as an honorable gentle
man when compared with a man who,
in order to hid his own methods as a
giver of bribes and a purchaser of
power, drags before the public the
name of a kindly and charitable gentle
woman, that he may hide behind her
skirts and thus expose her to criticisms
which he alone has earned and de
serves. Such a man is William F.
Herrin, head of Collis P. Huntington's
political bureau, and chief promoter of
the Senatorial candidacy of the aro
matic Colonel Daniel M. Burns, ex-
Clerk of Yolo County, ex-Secretary of
State, present horseman and mine
owner, one-time occupant of a prison
cell in Mexico and would-be arbiter of
the destiny and fortunes of the good
people of the State of California.
Colonel Burns is not a talkative man

and therefore it is not strange that a
great many people are not aware that
he once held the high office of County
Clerk of Yolo County, nor the circum
stances surrounding the relinquish
ment by him of that office. A brief
reference was made to it about four
years ago on the occasion of a mass
meeting at Metropolitan Temple. Cap-
tain E. Blennerhassett was the speaker
of the evening, and it was he that made
public reference to this particular por
tion of the record of the man who is
now trying to slip up on the blind side
of the Senatorial situation. This is
what he had to say, and it will serve
for the present to indicate to the reader
the occasion of Colonel Burns' leave
taking of the tax-payers of Tolo
County:
In the iFTenticit Burns dropped
into Yolo County, a plausible fellow
who would pat yon on the Hhoalder
mid tell you that it was "all rife-lit."
They elected him County Clerk. I
Trill tell you what occurred. Dur-
ing; liis adrainlNtration of the office
of County Clerk, Burn* of Yolo be
came a defaulter to the amount of, I
think. !)Â«arÂ»OO, and he wan arrested
and put in the Juu and kept there
ii in II his bondsmen took him out. I
can prove i 1..Â» assertion, and if Mr.
Mum* desires to arrest me for libel
he can do no. I am not afraid of
him.
To those members of the Legislature
who desire to know something of the
merits of the men wh" will be presented
to them as candidates for the office of
United States Senator xrticular at
tention is directed to the following por
tions of the printed report of the State
Controller, dated Sacramento, October
3, 1884:
Hon. E. C. Marshall, Attorney Gen
eral â Sir: I have the honor here
with to transmit to you the result of
an investigation of the office of Sec
retary of State daring the incum
bency of D. M. Burns, from January
5, 1880, to January 8, IHHH. The ex
amination Khona Mr. Burns to be a
defaulter to the State in the sum of
931.739 50.
â¢ â¢ â¢
As trill be seen from the annexed
appendix, this -work involved long,
arduous and perplexing labor, ren
dered necessary by the large num
ber of books examined, and doubly
so from the systematically fraudu
lent manner in which they were
kept.
That the law was intentionally
violated and that a belief won en
tertained that the violation would
escape attention Is most cleurly
evidenced by the fact that not one
of the books in which were entered
the daily transactions of the office
can be found, and the fee and cash
book which were left behind con
tained so many false and mystifying
entries as to show that the deter
mination nun to make detection all
the more difficult. Hut through an
inconceivable oversight on the part
of Burns' office, yet most fortunately
for the State, some thousands of let
ters were left on file from parties
In this and other States, ordering
work to be done, inclosing currency
and money orders In some cases for
the payment of the work, and in
others requesting: that it be sent
C. O. I>.
These letters furnished a clew
"lilcli. when followed, developed a
systematic embezzlement of the
State's money.
â¢ * â¢
Subsequent developmen tÂ« ha ye sat
isfied me that Mr. Burn*' denials
were not true and that he himself
participated directly In tue embez
xlenient.

TliiH system of patent, nnblnsh-
Ing frand, brKon almost at the hour
of hit incumbency, reaches In nn

The slinmeless mendacity of these
i-mhrizlem outstrips in onnning the
harbor and other public robbers
discovered by this office, lint wane
the -Til of condemnation and pub
lic contempt should be stamped on
thin ikmt edition of "stealing: made

and sympathy for its originators an
onsl* of admiration Intuitively
arises from the fact that they per
mitted the people to believe that
the law requiring: the collection of

not a dead letter, by mag-nan I mous

of the money collected.

The D. M. Burns mentioned In the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1898.
Controller's report as being a defaulter
to the State Is Colonel Daniel M. Burns,
the Southern Pacific Company's can
didate for United States Senator. He
is also the Dan Burns whose Senatorial
candidacy has been espoused by the
Examiner, the erstwhile champion of
the rights of the people and the enemy
of the great corporation of which Col
lis P. Huntington is the head and "Wil
liam F. Herrln the tail. "Not only
hoisted, but nailed."
State Senator-elect Sig M. Bettman
and the political writer of the Exam
iner left for Los Angeles Wednesday to
promote Burns' candidacy in the South
land. It is confidently expected that
there will "be something doing" in the
"bridges and building account"' of the
railroad company, to which was to be
charged the funds expended in pur
chasing the favor of timid legislators.
MR, COLNON
IS NOW SORRY
THAT HE SPOKE
His Harbor Front
Roast Inspired.
HE WOULD SHIFT THE BURDEN
MANY OF HIS RELATIVES HAVE
FAT PLACES.
The Attempt to Besmirch His Fel
low Commissioners Falls Flat
in the Face of
Facts.
The latent sensation among State offi
cials in this city is the remarkable ut
terances of Harbor Commissioner Col
non before the Senate commission now
investigating affairs on the water front.
It is the general opinion that Mr. Col
non, knowing that the work of the com
mission will result in bringing to light
much of the stealing and rascality that
has marked the conduct of affairs dur
ing his term of office, is seeking to draw
his fellow-commissioners into dises
teem in order to make a more equal
distribution of the burden of guilt. To
do this he is willing to conVict himself,
being satisfied if by so doing he can
lead the general public into the belief
that he alone is not to blame.
As a matter of fact Commissioner
Harney has held office considerably less
than a year and Commissioner Herold
was appointed to his present position
less than six months ago. Neither gen
tleman was a member of the board of
which Mr. Colnon is the president dur
ing the period when the State suffered
from stealings and mismanagement, as
is shown by the revelations that have
been made from time to time before the
Senate commission.
The purchasing bureau about which
Mr. Colnon had so much to say and
which he declares should be "taken out
of politics" â now that his own term of
office is about to expire in a fog of dis
grace â is one of his pet schemes. It
was established at his earnest solici
tation and under his direction and has
from Its inception been a ready and
convenient funnel through which the
funds of the State were allowed to flow
into the pockets of dishonest contract
ors and interested, though equally dis
honest, officials. Now that iur. Colnon
is about to retire in disgrace, leaving
seven of his relatives in the enjoyment
of fat salaries on the water front, he
wishes to have a system of civil service
established for the purpose, possibly, of
enabling the aforesaid relatives to con
tinue in the enjoyment of their present,
sinecures indefinitely.
Mr. Colnon also declared that the
number of men employed on the water
front was far in excess of the needs of
the State. He even went so far as to
declare that the greater number of
those who have been given positions are
irresponsible and incompetent, a fact
which he sincerely deplored, but which
was out of his power to remedy as he
wag only entitled to. name one-third of
the appointees of the board. This was,
of course, a direct slap at his fellow
commissioners, and was delivered, ap
parently, without regard to the well
known fact that some of the men for
whose appointment he is responsible
are notoric sly incompetent. One of
his appointees .vas, before he was pro
moted by grace of Mr. Colnon's favor
to an easy berth on the State's water
front pay roll a banjo player in the
saloons and low dives of Stockton. It
is for such as he that Commissioner
Colnon would have established civil
service rules that they may be retained
in office.
It is. generally conceded that Mr. Col
non's left-handed "roast" of his fellow-
Commissioners was partly inspired by
the fact that they have refused to
"stand in" and appoint Harry Scott,
Colnon's nephew, to the position of
Chief Wharfinger now held by Supreme
Court Clerk-elect George Root. By the
grace of Mr. Colnon Scott now holds
the position of Mr. Root's assistant,
and it was the dream of his uncle's
heart to advance him to the position
that will be left vacant by the retire
ment of Mr. Root. The other members
of the board, however, decline to pro
mote the success of the family affair
that Mr. Colnon is running in connec
tion with the State's pay roll, hence the
voluntary confession of unworth to
which Colnon gave voice before the
Senate commission on Wednesday. The
confession and accompanying denun
ciation had no place in the inquiry that
was being conducted at the time It
would not have been listened to had
it not been for the fact that the mem
bers of the commission are inclined to
be amiable and were therefore induced
to give the Commissioner an opportu
nity to relieve a conscience somewhat
overburdened by shady acts covering
almost the entire period of his term of
office. The result has been that he is
now coming in for a "roasting" at the
hands of every official who is awar,e of
the facts as they really exist and' not
as Mr. Colncm represents them.

WINE PRICES GOING UP.
Have Recently Advanced Six Cents
Per Gallon.
The shortage in the wine crop of IS9B
and the fairly good demand that 'has
existed during the past year have re
sulted In advancing the prices of the
vinous product during the past few
weeks. In speaking of the sit
uation yesterday Secretary Hotchkiss of
the Wine Makers' Corporation said:
"Prices of wines have been advancing
steadily for some time, and since October
1 the increase has amounted to 6 cents per
gallon. Of course, this is good luck to
the winemen who now have wine for
sale, and we feel, confident that prices
will go higher. Our opinion is based on
the facts of the long continued dry
weather, which will weaken the vines,
and the ravages of the phylloxera.
"Whether the condition of higher prices
and reduced product will balance re
mains to be seen, but the producers are
not much pleased with the prospect.
"The story that one of the big wine cor
porations had cornered the cooperage
market is not correct. It is true that
the price of cooperage has advanced one
quarter of a cent per gallon, but that is
due to the floods in the Southern States,
where the staves come from, and to the
enormous demands of the Standard Oil
Company and the sugar trust. The con
sumption of the oil company alone is 30,
000 barrels daily. While there is some
scarcity there need be no fear that there
will be insufficient cooperage to handle
the wine for Eastern and foreign ship
ment Owing to special rates made by
the railroad the winemen of the State are
now buying Eastern cooperage 'set ur>'
cheaper than it could be bought in this
Successful Church Bazaar.
The bazaar now in progress at the
Howard Presbyterian Church, under the
auspices of the members of the Howard
congregation, is meeting with encourage
ment and a liberal patronage. The attend
ance since the fair was formally opened
last Tuesday evening has been unusually
large. One of the most attractive feat
ures is the evening dinner, given from 5
o'clock until 8 o'clock. This meal will be
given every evening until the close of the
bazaar. The decorations of the interior
of the hall, where the different booths are
located, are both elaborate and unique
A large variety of useful and fancy arti
cles are offered for sale and are receiving
a far greater demand than expected
Every evening an enjoyable musical and
literary programme is rendered under the
direction of the talented members of the
congregation. The bazaar will be con
cluded to-morrow evening.

GOLD NUGGET
FOR THE HERO
OF THE OREGON
Captain Clarke Re
membered.
THE CALL WILL SEND IT
THOMAS R. MOORE BACK FROM
A GOLD HUNT.
He Went Into British Columbia Last
Spring and in Six Months
Found Much Precious
Ore.
Thomas R. Moore arrived at the Palace
yesterday from Omenica. British Colum
bia, where for the past six months he has
been prospecting for gold in the interests
of the St. Anthony's Exploration Com
pany of California, of which he is a mem
ber. Mr. Moore does not talk extrava
gantly about his search for gold, in fact
he is inclined to say nothing ' all that
will throw any light on the extent of his
success. He went In last spring on a two
years' prospecting trip and in six months
was so successful that he deemed it
worthless to waste any more time looking
for more claims, but decided to return to
prepare for working those that he has lo
cated.
The St. Anthony's Exploration Company
is well known in the State. Last May Mr.
Moore, with twenty-two pack horses and
twelve men, started up the old Telegraph
trail for the Germansen and Mansen
Creek claims, which are now operated by
his company. Since their discovery these
claims have paid several millions of dol
lars. It was the purpose of Mr. Moore and
his party to proceed farther toward
Northeast British Columbia, in that por
tion of the country that is practically
unknown, and attempt to ascertain if gold
was to be found there. The party followed
the old Telegraph trail to Stuarts Lake
and thence took the trail to Germansen
Creek, a distance of 315 miles. In and
around the Germansen, Mansen and Ev
ans creeks Mr. Moore says that he found
the richest kind of ground. He
admits that it is far more profitable than
Alaska. It has also other auvantages.
The gold Is of a much purer quality and
the ground is sufficiently thawed out by
May to admit of its being mined. So far
nearly all the mining has been done on the
crudest and simplest lines, and yet the
yields have been far more profitable than
similar claims in Alaska.
Arrangements have been made with the
Hudson Bay Company to carry in from
Victoria all the necessary material for the

proper working- of these claims. It will
be largely by the hydraulic system that
the claims will be mined. Mr. Moore has
brought back with him many specimens
of gold that he claims are of the
finest quality, some of the ore assaying
$20 an ounce. Large deposits of copper
were also found by the party. Mr. Moora
asserts that there are miles of the coun
try that have never known the presence
of the white man that are rich In the
precious ore.
C. A. Thompson of Sierra, Cal., a well
known mining man, and C. E. Perry a
civil engineer of British Columbia were
in the party.
Mr. Moore states that on the 26th of
August the party received a copy of The
Call containing the account of the de
struction of Cervera's fleet, and that then
and there they determined that the next
nugget of suitable size found should be
sent to Captain Clarke of the Oregon, in
token of the party's admiration. By a
unanimous vote it was decided that this
golden trophy should be sent to Captain
Clarke through The Call. Only a few days
later Mr. Moore picked up from the dry
earth on the Dr. Thorpe claim a nugget
weighing about eight ounces. This will
be sent by The Call to Captain Clarke.
Mr. Moore has it among his other nug
gets. It is a very beautiful specimen.
Mr. Moore leaves to-day for his home
in Santa Barbara for a brief visit.
AN ABUSED CHILD.
A Little Girl Compelled to Stay Out
in the Cold All Night.
It was a pitiful case of cruelty and neg
lect that Mrs. Prescott of the Society for A
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children In-^
vestigated yesterday. During all of
Wednesday night a little girl had been
compelled to stay out in a damp yard, at
tired only in a thin white dress.
Joseph Bini, a baker, going to work
early in the morning, heard the sob of a
child, and looking around found little Jen
nie Briceno sitting on a small mound in
a yard at 1620 V* Stockton street. The
child was stiff and numb with cold. The
kindhearted baker took the little one to
his home, where he and his wife worked
for over an hour to restore the outcast
to her normal condition. Mrs. Prescott
was sent for and she found that it was a
case of cruelty on the part of Jennie Bri
ceno's mistress, Pauline Fernandez. The
couple live at 1825 Stockton street.
There are two other children living with
the couple, the man having been divorced
from his wife. All complain of being
abused, but the little one found out in
the cold yard has suffered the most. Mrs,
Prescott found that the little one's arms
and body bear the marks of many a beat
ing and pinches. The father returned
home at 8 o'clock on Wednesday evening
and was told that the child had run away.
He notified the grandmother, who is the
guardian, and in time the mother learned
of what had happened. The children were
returned to their guardian.
