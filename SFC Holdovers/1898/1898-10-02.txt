VOLUME LXXXIT.-NO. 124.
VAST ASSEMBLAGE OF VOTERS GREETS
THE REPUBLICAN STANDARD BEARERS.
HENRY T. GAGE AND JACOB
NEFF CHEERED BY THOUSANDS
AT WOODWARD'S PAVILION.
The Plan of the Fusion Gubernatorial Candidate to
Evade the Real Issues of the Campaign
Was Exposed in Masterly
Way.
Henry T Gage, who is destined to
lead the Republican party to a glorious
victory in this State, made his first
s=peeoh in San Francisco last night be
fore a large and enthusiastic au
dience at Woodward's Pavilion. He
was frequently interrupted by ap
plause.
proved in a masterly manner that
his Democratic-Populist-Silver Repub
lican opponent was vainly endeavor
ing to avoid the real issues of the cam
paign.
Jacob H. NtfT, Republican nominee
for Lieutenant Governor, and United
States Senator George C. Perkins ably
assisted Mr. Gage in exposing the sub
terfuges resorted to by James G. Ma
fruire and his associate stump Sitters
In their attempt to win votes for the
fusion ticket. The meeting was one of
the most enthusiastic ever held here,
and If the audience had its way the
speakers would have had an ail-night
session, They plainly but so interest
ingly explained the tactics of the fusion
managers that their auditors would
have been pleased if th-^y continued
talking for hours 'origer.
The kindly reception given the speak
ers was not entirely unexpected by
them, for earlier in the evening they
given an evidence of the good will
born* 1 them. The Union League Club
Drill Corps assembled at the Palace
Hotel at 7. o'clock and serenaded the
candidates. The crowd in the court
yard of the hotel was somewhat disap
â¢^d, however, at not having the
speakers of the evening meeting ad
dress them. They would have willingly
done so i were it not for the fact that
they wished to save their voices for
thr- mass meeting. After the serenade
the drill corpig, with flambeaus lighted,
marched to Wi^odward's Pavilion, where
seats had been: reserved for the mem
bers on the main floor, close to the
platform. The drill mrps was given a
generous reception when it appeared in |
the meeting hall, headed by a band
playing patriotic and inspiring airs.
Seated on the platform were Henry
T. Gage, Jacob H. Xeff, Senator George
C. Perkins. Irving M. Scott, Major
Frank McLaughlin, Charles L. Patton,
Julius Kahn, E. C. Ha-t, C. S. Lau
mc-ister, Paris Kilburn. Tirey L. Ford,
Colonel George Stone, Dr. C. Hennessey
and Colonel J. S. Young.
"Three cheers for Henry T. Gage, the
next Governor of the State of Califor
nia:" shouted one of the members of
the drill corps.
The audience arose and gave the
cheers, with a "tiger."
Major McLaughlin, chairman of the
Republican State Central Committee,
called the meeting to order and intro
duced Irving M. Scott, "the builder of
the Oregon," as the president of the
evening. When Scott stepped to the
front of the platform he was warmly
applauded. His speech, through brief,
was to the point, and when he an
nounced that the contract for building
a monitor had been awarded at noon to
the Union Iron Works, the audience
yelled until their voices were husky and
their hands were sore from clapping.
At the conclusion of Chairman Scott's
remarks, the band struck up "Hail to
the Chief" and the crowd again cheer
ed. As the last notes of the inspiring
air died away. Chairman Scott intro
duced Henry T. Gage, as "the next
Governor of California."
Again the audience sneered and ap
plauded and it was several minutes be
fore the standard bearer of the Repub
lican party could make himself heard.
"When he announced that his voice was
Btrained from campaigni*- throughout
the southern part of the State, and that
he hoped if he did not speak loud

AND CANDIDATES.
enough to be heard by every one in the
pavilion that some one would inform
him of that fact, he won the audience.
He started off in a well modulated
voice and his every word could be dis
tinctly heard.
As he proceeded, he seemed to gain
vocal strength, and when he concluded
the rafters of the building rang with
the echoes of the applause given him
He lucidly pointed out the dangers of
the doctrine of fusion and a fusion
policy that stands for dishonest money
and financial ruin. He told how Ma
guire stood in Congress when it was
necessary to legislate to raise funds to
protect the American nation and the
American flag. The fallacies and in
justice of the prop jsed single tax sys
tem, advocated by the fusion guberna
torial candidates were next dealt with
to the satisfaction of the vast audience.
When the speaker denied the silly sto
ries told by Congressman Maguire ac
cusing him of being a railroad man,
and explained that the only occasion
in which he ever appeared in a railroad
case was to recover damages for the rel
atives of some one killed or for some
one injured, his auditors rose in their
seats and cheered for severad minutes.
After campaign songs by the Water
man sisters, Jacob H. Neff, nominee for
Lieutenant Governor, was introduced
by Chairman Scott. His appearance
was the signal for another spontaneous
outburst of applause. He said that he
felt highly honored by being placed on
the ticket, and promised that ir. the
event of his election he would work
earnestly for the benefit of all the peo
ple of the State.
Sam Uooth and a quartet next ren
dered a campaign song, and then Sena
..tor George C. Perkins, "the working
Senator from California," as Chairman
Scott styled him, was introduced as the
last speaker. Senator Perkins was
cheered for several minutes, and fre
quently during the delivery of his ad
dress he was Interrupted by applause.
He succinctly told of the good work
accomplished by the Republican admin
istration under President McKinley,
and his references to the war just end
ed with Spain brought tears to many
eyes. At the conclusion of his address
the audience sang 'America," and then
dispersed to the music of that ever dear
melody, "Home, Sweet Home."
Upon being introduced as the chair
man of the evening Irving M. Scott
said:
Mr. Chairman of the State Central
Committee, ladies and gentlemen of the
State of California: It does me good to
get back to my old home and find the
Republican party united from north to
south, from e;ist to west, in behalf of
progressive, American, McKinley politics.
(Applause.)
I visited lately the great capitals of the
old countries, wearing a simple bow In
my buttonhole that represented the old
flag of our country, and in May, when I
went out, people asked me what it was.
When I came back through those cities
in the month of August every man,
woman and chjld, from Russia and Ger
many and England and the north coun
tries, said: "I see you are wearing the
American flag in your buttonhole " (Ap
plause.) If I could convey to you the
difference of feeling that existed in Eu

tive State and saw that this grand old
State erf California had not only fur
nished the first regiment in the war and
filled her quota in every call, but had
risen to the emergencies of this occasion
and nominated a stalwart son of the
south for a standard bearer and brought

HENRY T. GAGE ADDRESSES REPUBLICAN VOTERS.
! that dear old miner from the north, I 1
| knew and felt that In this campaign vie- :
; tory would rest again upon our banner, j
and the whole world would see that the
cvestern slope of America was awake to
a consciousness of the power that lies
beyond her dominion in the struggle for I
commercial supremacy which must now
take place upon the Pacific. l
I thank you for this generous welcome
on behalf of the mechanics of San Fran- |
Cisco, and their great work, known wher-
ever a navy is owned by any Govern-
ment; for the reputation of California's;

length and breadth of the whole world,
ana is held In honor, in glory and in re-
spect. (Great applause.)
Henry T. Gage was then introduced
and spoke as follows:
Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen;
friends and fellow citizens: It Is with
great delight and appreciation that I wit-
ness this magnificent assemblage. Let
me say here, fellow citizens, I have been
talking now for ome days, and neces-
sarily I must proitot my voice as far as
possible, and therefore I may speak in
lower tones than I otherwise would do;
but if at any time during my brief ad-
dress you fail to hear me in the rear of
the audience I shall esteem it no incon-
siderable kindness if some gentleman will
arise and say louder!
I thank you for this magnificent demon-
stration to the Republican party. It to
my mind presages a magnificent victory
to the State, to the Congressional, to the
legislative and to the county ticket. (Ap.
plause.).
Vlctory Assured.
. I have come recently from the south,
having traveled with a distinguished fel-'
low citizen of your community t'hrpugh
ten counties, and -we are assured there
by Democrat's and by Republicans that
the people in tfiat end of the State will
roll up the grandest Republican major-
lty ever known there. (Great applause.)
And from what we hear from all parts
of the State, it is with great pleasure I
say we have the same report. I have
no doubt that on the Bth day of- Novem-
ber we'will ha.ye the grandest people's
triumph that California has ever seen,
(Applause.) The reasons- are ..obvious,
The people âthe loyal .Democrat, the pa-
triotif Populist, who went out, as he
thought, from the ranks of other parties'
for the well are; of his Stateâthe generr
ous Republican, though misguided, who
went from our ranks thinking he could
serve his. country and his State in the
silver ranksâall these have seen the de
luslon that has been practiced upon them
and they are returning to the fold,
All these combinations guarantee be
yond question the victory that I have just
referred to and predicted,
The people feel that there Is danger to
American institutions from this doctrine
of fusion. On the one hand is the Re
publican party .which has battled for the
right, battled for the people, a party
which represents that which is highest,
bravest and noblest in American states
manship (applause;; on the other hand
Is the fusion party, which stands for dis
honest money' and .financial ruin. This
party which stands for the men who rt-
fuse to issue bonds to protect' the honor

triumphant will deny the right of the
miner to. own his own mine and to ex
tract ore from it; stands for a sentiment
which if triumphant would paralyze busi
ness and .block the progress of the State,
and stands for single tax, that horrible
doctrine which denies the right of a
father to devise his estate to his child,

'
But tnev tell us that single tax is not
invoi Ved In this controversy; they tell us,
becausethev are horrified at the doctrine,
th tit ls not an lÃSue i n thls campaign.
T charge, to borrow the language of the
Democratic United States Senator who
spoke recently from a'platform in this
cf tyi that single tax is an issue in this
campaign. I charge that the Democratic!
party, which assembled in solemn conven
{$". '"That^hey" naorsed an^enmmended
the acts and conduct of every Democratic
representative in Congress. Now, in that
Congress was-the standard-bearer of the
fusioniats, or as they are pleased to. style
It the â¢ Union party, improperly so
styled. In that' Congress that gen
tleman declared â¢â¢ in favor of the
single tax.' He introduced bills in Con-.
gress in favor of the. single tax. Tie
made speeches denying the right of the
miner to take ore from his own- mine, or
dig the gold from the gravel. Now, when'
the Democratic party commends his acts,
commends whatever he .has done there,
does it not fo!]ow as a logical result that
single tax is an. issue? Of.-course it <}oe3.
There is no escape .from the proposition,
Presently it Is my purpose to call your
attention to the Congressional record

actly what was done, in-that behalf. But

ADDRESS THE GREAT THRONG.
.Cisco for the generous support which their
[ delegates gave me in the last Repub-
I lican convention (applause), and I take
â this opportunity to denounce the calumny
nightly urged upon various platforms in
this State that the men who assembled
in that convention were dominated by
railroad and corrupt influence.
Wlaguii-eÂ» Denounced.,
Suppose I were to select that body of
handsome ladles and gentlemen there (in
dicating a part of the audience), and say
that whole body of people are railroad
hirelings, what would you think of me?
! What do you think of a man who de
i nouhces as railroad hirelings men wno
[ have come- from every walk of life â from
fifty-seven great counties of this Stateâ
and assembled in solemn convention? If
I should assert such a thing of the Demo
cratic partyâ that is, of its convention â I
should feel that I had committed a dis
honorable act against my fellow-men. I
think it is none the less reprehensible in
the gentleman who nightly does It. I
think it is- beneath a man who aspires to
the -high office of Governor of this State.
(Applause.) I believe In the virtue of
women and the honesty qf men, and I
will never brand a multitude of my fel
low-citizens or fellow-men in that wsy.
I have just said that fhe Democratic
? artyâ not the Democratic party, the old
effersonian, honest, upright, patriotic
party, but the fusion party (laughter and
I applause)â had indorsed every act of every
Congressman from this State. Now, i de
sire to call your attention to what one
of their Congressmen did and what he
said. In the course of a single-tax speech,
in an attempt by somebody as a standard
bearer'of. some or many parties to de
feat the Wilson bill, a gentleman said
this, and I now read from page 334, part
1 c-f appendix 2 of the Congressional Rec
ord, second session of the.t ifty-third Con
fress, being a speech, made Wednesday,
anuary 31, 1594, and the following is Mr.
Magulr.e's language:
â¢ "The margin of production, which is
now the share of the non-producer, would
go to the entire community for the gen
eral, benefit of all. This would be Just,
because the margin of production re
sults in all cases from the presence and
enterprise and efforts of tlv whole com
munity, except in so. far as it represents
the value of the great natural deposits"â
â¢mark, the Democratic convention is in fa
vor of mines and miningâ "such as coal,
iron, gold, sliver, copper, lead, petroleum,
quicksilver and the like under the earth,
and forests overthe earth. And these de
posits and forests were prepared and

stored by the Creator for the general com
mon use of all mankind."
The 7V\lnersÂ» Friend.
Oh. there is vastly worse sentiment
than that; and when you remember what
a brave miner undergoes; when you re
member that he travels with parched lips
the terrible deserts and climbs the moun
tains with a pack; when he staggers un
der it, and can hardly bear his load;
when you remember that brain and mus
cle enables him to discover his mine
shall you deny him the right to the re
sult of his toil? Never! (Applause.)
Now mark the glorious and patriotic
sentiment indorsed by the Democratic
convention at Sacramento. Mark this,
tell it to the miners of our State. This
is quoted from my iriend Maguire s
speechâ he says he is my friend, you
know; and on every rostrum he either
says I am a fool or how foolish Gage is.
(Laughter.) He says that he won't an
swer Gage's speeches because he is not
sure he made them. (Renewed laughter.)
Now, mark, and let us remember this for
ever- don't misconstrue this, don't imag
ine I indorse it in any way: "it is right
âspeaking of the mines and the oresâ
"It is right that their value should be
given to the whole people whenever pri
vate individuals extract them from the
earth?" What do you think of that kind
of doctrine? , . '
A voice-It's all right (Laughter.)
Mr Gageâ You think it is? Well, that
is just about the ratio in which the votes
will be cast in the coming contest, one
out of 8000. (Great applause and laugh
t.6r )
The voiceâ He will get my vote.
Another voiceâ You have no vote.
Mr. Gage-Well. I don't look at inter
ruptions like some people do. I tmnK
when the American people get together to
discuss political questions if there is any
body in the audience who has a griev
ance or a thought that he believes ought
to be considered, he has a perfect right to
suggest it, if he does so In a respectful
way. (Renewed applause.)
Now there is another matter that I in
tend to call your attention to. and that
is the attitude of the gentlemen who as
sembled in Sacramento a short time ago.
They declared in favor of a policy that
fends to cripple and does In fact cripple
thfcUimon PP ss P chool fund. Upon that sub
ject I have this to say:
Defends the Schools.
I never had any other educationâ and
unfortunately, not enough of that-except
that gained in the common schools: and
1 have the profoundest reverence and re
sDect for the common schools, and for the
common school teachers (applause), and
whenever I see an assaultâ a direct or an
indirect attack upon that institut on. It
makes my blood boil. (Great applause.)
For I say that upon the Intelligence of
the masses depends the perpetuity of our
institutions and the liberty of American
citizens. (Great applause.) They have
declared, thinking that they would reach
the prejudices of the communityâ but they
have to reach other things than preju
dices in this campaign; they have to
reach the reason, the judgment of men
and women, tooâ they have declared that
the poll tax should be abolished. I do
not assent to that doctrine. I say with
the constitution of our State that that
tax since every dollar of it goes into the
nubile school fund, forever ought to be
maintained. (Applause.) They profess to
be the friends of the laboring man, and
make an assault upon the laboring man's
best friend, the common school! More
than that, they would liberate the Chi
nese from contributing to the fund to
support the grandest institution of our
Government. (Renewed applause.) And
right in the line of that policy comes the
vote which is indorsed by the Democratic
partyâ the fusion party; don't let me use
improper terms (laughter)â the vote of a
man indorsed by that party, who has
declared in Congress by his solemn vote,
against the right of the American peo
ple in one of the States of this nation to
have the English language taught in the
common schools: and that vote was the
vote of my distinguished opponent who
thinks I am a common fool (laughter and
applause).
/Wagulre's Record.
They claim, you knowâ my Democratic
friendsâ that is my fusion friendsâ who
intend to vote against me and howl
against me all the time, and ridicule me
in every shape, manner and form possi
ble, that I do not stick to the record.
But here is the record on the subject
that I have just referred to. For proof
of the proposition that I have just stated
I refer to the Congressional Record of
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
date of June 27, 1894, showing Mr. Ma
guire's vote against the amendment of
fered to House bill No. 353, entitled, "A
bill to enable the people of New Mexico
to form a constitution and State govern
ment."
Now, my friends, the Democratic press
â and of course I recognize that the Ex
aminer is a great journal, especially as
it contains in advance the creed of U)e
Democratic party. (Laughter.) That
paper announces that there is no issua
in this campaign except the railroad is
sue; no issue in this campaign except thi
issue relative to the disposition of the
question between the railroads and the
people of the United States as to what
amount of money is due from the South
ern Pacify â¢ Company and row it shall ba
paid; that is the only issue. Now remem
ber that. And if that is a pretended is
sue, then it would seem that the party,
like the Republican party, which pre
sents other issues beyond that, should be
entitled to the approval of the people of
the State. Now, mark you. there was a
bill framed to provide for all these con
tingencies, and it is designated by thu
distinguished, learned, able and eloquent
gentleman who is my opponent as the re
funding amendment. He asserts that
that bill is a Republican measure, and
he asserts it with great bitterness. The
terms of that bill â I could read it to you,
but I have not the time and would not
tax your attention with itâ provides
for the payment by the railroad
company to the United States of some
fifty-nine millions of dollars; provides
that it shall be paid within ten years, in
twenty equal semi-annual payments, with
interest.
The Funding Bill.
That bill we claim, or I did at one time
and claim it now, was a just bill, ac
cording to the views of gentlemen whom
I shall refer to in future; but whether it
was or was not a just bill it could not
have been passed in the condition it now
is in if the gentleman who is now com
plaining about it had simply said "I ob
ject" at the time that it came up in Con
gress.
That bill passed from the United States
Senate to the House of Representatives.
When it reached there an amendment
was proposed to it by your distinguished
citizen of California who represented you
in Congress, Mr. Barham. It was con
ceded that that amendment was a good
one and is a good one; conceded that but
for that amendment it could not hava
passed the House of Representatives.
Now what right has the gentleman t<Â»
travel this State and brand that bill, a
Republican bill, as a bad principle, when
he himself could by simply standing up
in his seat in Congress, making the point
and saying "I object," prevented ita
passage? If that is the true status, then
I say he has no right of complaint. So
we will see from the Congressional Record
what the true conditions are. I know it
is disagreeable to quote from a docu
ment when addressing an assemblage of
this character, but some people have
questioned the accuracy of the state
ments that I have heretofore made, and,
considering the importance of the sub
ject, I trust you will consider no moment
ill-spent when I read from this record.
I read from Congressional Record, voluma
15, page 7514. Now, here is the bill as
it comes down to the House of Represen
tatives from the Senate:
From the* Record.
"Mr. Cannonâ He was the gentleman in
charge of the bill. Mr. Speaker, the time
is about here when this vote is to be ta
ken. As I understand the pÂ«nding mo
tion, it is to recede from the disagree
ment to the Senate amendment and con
cur in the same.
"The Speaker pro temporeâ That is tha
pending motion; yes, sir.
"Mr. Barhamâ Now. in that connection,
Mr. Speaker, a parliamentary inquiry.
"The Speaker pro tempore â The gentle
man will state it.
"Mr. Barham â la a motion in order to
concur with an amendment?
"The Speaker pro tempore â The motion
to recede and concur would take prece
dence of a motion to concur with an
amendment, for the reason that the mo
tion to recede and concur, if agreed to.
would bring the two houses together and
at once dispose of the bill
"Mr. Barham â I hope that the gentle
man in charge of the bill" and there ha
was interrupted.
"Mr. Cannon (interrupting him)â lf the
gentleman will send the anrendment to
the clerk's desk and have it read we will
see whether any arrangement can be
made about it.
"The Speaker pro temporeâ The clerk
will report the amendment."
And the clerk read as follows: And2
this is Mr. Barham's amendment:
"ProvidPd, further, that unless the set
tlement herein authorized be perfected
within one year after the passage of this
act the President of the United States
shall at once proceed to foreclose all liens
now held by the United States against
said railroad companies, and to collect
the indebtedness herein sought to be set
tled, and nothing in the act contained
shall be held to be a waiver or release
of any rights, lien or cause of action al
ready held by the United States."
"Mr. Cannonâ Now. Mr. Speaker, in my
Judgment that amendment enlarges the
Senate provision instead of limiting it.
but the gentleman from California thinks
it would be a valuable amendment. We
cannot vote upon it at this stage unless
there is consent. Now, I have no objec
tion if such is the unanimous wish of the
House to modify my motion, and move
that the House recede from its disagree
ment to the Senate amendment and con
cur with the amendment which has Just
befn read.
"Mr. Barhamâ l hope the House will do
that.
"xur. Speaker pro temporeâ The gentle
man from Illinois asks unanimous con-
Bent to withdraw his motion to recede
and concur and to make the motion to
concur with the amendment which has
Just been read from the Clerk's desk. Is
there any objection?"
Did INot Object.
And In that House sat my distinguished
opponent, James G. Magulre. There was
no objection. There came not from his
mouth at that time an objection to the
document which he travels this State and
brands as infamous. Ib that fair? Aye,
that he contends that the record ooea
not report him fairly and that I do not
comment fairly upon the report as made.
Eliminate what I have said if you please
upon that subject and let us meet it upon
another ground. He says that was a
Democratic measure, and assails the Re
publican party for some of the perr.dy
of that party. Let me tell you who the
man was that proposed that amendment,
that entire bill. It was none other than
John T. Morgan of Alabama, the Demo
cratic champion of the people, lhat bill
originated not with any Republican, but
with a Democrat. Then why brand it as
a Republican measure, teH me? Not only
that, but that bill, as I have already stat
ed provided for the payment to the Gov
ernment of every dollar that the South
ern Pacific Company owed the country
and interest upon interest. And if you or
1 should pay our debts In that way every
body would say they were liquidated,
would they not? Is there any other rule
of common justice and common honesty
that you can apply to the meanest cor
poration on earth? No. Everybody has
riKhts Every corporation has rights.
The 'man who kneels on your street and
takes a pick and knocks the stones out of
the walks and places them back, wearing
his knees, if you please, to the blood, has
rights, and so has the richest man who
Inhabits a palace in this city.
Now. how did that bill pass the United
States Senate? The record shows that it
was introduced by that distinguished
champion of the peopleâ Morgan of Ala
bama. Then it was scrutinized and re
modeledâit is a Republican bill, you
knowâ to suit the judgment of that rail
road hireling, that stalwart Democrat.
Stephen M. White, (Applause.) Intro
duced by a Democrat, corrected by as
honest, as honorable, as brave, as true
a man as ever traveled this earth, Steve
White- and after having thus been criti
cized, having thus been remodeled, it
went through, the United States Senate,
voted for by every Populist in that body,
by every Silver-Republican in that body
and by every Republican in that body
and every Democrat in that body.
(Applause). __
\A/ho AA/as Honest?
Now tell, me, fellow citizens, when was
It that my friend Maguire, who loves me
60 much, became possessed of more In
tegrity, more honesty, more ability than
every man in the United States Senate?
If that bill met the approval of the wis
dom and the judgment of every man in
the United States Senate do. you think
that it can be very onerous in its char
acter? I do not. And that was the rea
son why Mr. Maguin.\ when his optics
rested upon it, made no objection there
to. (Applause).
Now, fellow citizens, I think I am en
croaching upon the time of others. (Cries
of "Go on, go on"). You are very kind;
If you knew the feelings that pass
through my hcirt as I stand here perhaps
you would tell me to go on.
They say that I am a railroad man.
(Laughter.) They say the "old Abe" of
California, Jake Neff. is a railroad hire
ling. (daughter and applause.) You
can't make people believe such nonsense
as that. I am less known, and somebody
might be deluded by assaults of that kind
upon me. O. course it Is extremely dis
agreeableâextremely distastefulâ to a
man to spe?K of himself and for himself,
and I assu" c you but for the attitude of
the gpntle.nan upon the other side of this
question I never should have made a
speech Juring this campaign. It was my
purpose originally not to engage in any
discussion at all. Hut the position taken
by the gentleman on the other side has
not forced me, but my committee, whom
I have considerable affection for, has de
manded that I say something to the peo
ple, otherwise I should not be violating
the ideas which make it distasteful to me
as a man to say these things. That is my
apology for appearing before you and
paying this. They say all sorts of things
about me. Among other things they com
plain because occasionally I put mv hands
in my pockets, daughter.)
A voiceâ How about Otis and the Times
at Ixjs Angeles?
Mr. Gageâ How about Otis and the
Times?
The voiceâ Yes.
Mr. Gageâ Why, Maguire quotes Otis,
and Otis has stated in his paper that Ma
guire is an anarchist and a dangerous
man to the community. I wouldn t say
anything half as bad as that about him.
(Great laughter and applause.)
A Voiceâ Maeruir. 1 - is all rierht. (Cries of
"Go on. Gage." "Throw him out.")
Mr. Gageâ Oh. give every man a show
for his whin- alley or his black alley
either. (Laughter.)
INot on S. F*. Hireling.
But, as I remarked, and of course you
do not know me personally, some of you
might be impressed with these circulated
statements, one among which is that I
am related to a gentleman by the: name
of Gage who Is connected with the South
ern Pacific Railroad Company.
I tell you I landed on these far-off Pa
cific shores when I was a mere child,
friendless and broke (laughter), but I
have always been true to an injunction
that my dear oid mother asked me to fol
low. She said when I kissed her the
last farewell: "Henry, be true to your
convictions, work hard, be honest and you
Will triumph." (Great applause.) I have
âand this is no reflection upon any gen
tieman referred to â no adult male rela
tive, but I have children hero west of
the Rocky Mountains. That answers the
first proposition.
Now as to my railroad record. How I
studied law, and 1 have followed that
profession up to this hour from the time
i was old enough to embark In it, will
not be interesting to you, but it was an
awful struggle to me. And when I ar
rived at the age of manhood the first
spot eh that 1 ever made In my life was
in denunciation of the claim of the rail
roads to a right to Interfere in Califor
nia politics. (Great applause.) That
speech
A voiceâ l heard that speech, and I can
4uarantee every word you say as true.
Mr. Gageâ Thank you. Well, you may
guarantee it, my dear old friend.
Another voiceâ l" will guarantee that
Gage will be Governor.
Mr. Gageâ Thank you. Your hair Is
white and mine is gray, and I thank you
from the bottom or my heart for your
kindly expression, because it is the truth.
From that day to this hour I have been
consistent to the sentiments expressed on
that occasion. And if my Democratic
friendsâ no. not Democratic but Unionist
friends, with a policy ITRe a Tldlron
â truck by lightningâ have any controversy
over it, they will find that speech reported
In the Los Angeles Star of date November
t, 1876.
The People's FViend.
When the great controversy came on
between the people and this corporation
Relative to their right in their land grant,
was upon the side of the people. I do
not claim that I did much, but like the
widow and the mite, I gave all I had for
the common people in that controversy.
And I have never receivedâ although they
have sought to employ t*e, but I pre
ferred to stand for the peopleâ l have
never received a dollar from that com
pany, except money which -I have made
[hem pay for injuring my fellow man or
killing him. (Great appla-use.)
Senator Whiteâ and I love himâ stood
upon a rostrum in this city and stated
that the Republican ticket was railroad
from top to bottom. That included my
#e!f. you will remember, and -my opponent
Immediately seized it and went for that
(ike a trout after a fly. He said, "Didn't
you hear what Senator White said, that
that ticket was nominated by the rail
road company?" White never said any
such thing. Mark the jingle of my
friends words. He said that ticket from
top to bottom was the ticket of the rail
road company, not that they wanted it as
it was, not that they had anything to do
with its nomination, but It was thflr
tickei; that is to say, they would vote
that'icket. Well. I am glad that for once
in tthe history of that corporation it In
tends to do the right thing. (Laughter
and applause.) I feel that every man
ought to vote that ticket who appreciates
the rights of property, the rights of lib
erty and who is opposed to the horrible
revolutionary doctrine of the single tax.
(Applause.)
Now my friend Whiteâ l told you I
loved him. I do, individually; as a man
he is a superb creature, but when It
comes to politics, heavens! Let him
alone. (Laughter.) He got on his old
refrain, the same refraia that he had in
IS9G. He said that that ticket, McKinley
and all. was railroad, and advised you to
vote for Bryan. (Laughter.) But no
body was deceived by his wordsâ l won't
say nobody, but the majority of the peo
ple were not deceived by his words, and
nis party met what it will meet this time,
a merited defeat.
As Illustrative of the partisanship of
my friend White, I remember in the his
tory of this State when that distinguished
gentleman refused to advocate the can
didacy of a noble man who aspired to the
same* place I aspire to. and it was none
less that his good old father. Need you
wonder, if he would not advocate the
election of his father that he would not
howl very loudly for me?
I have trenched upon your time al
ready too much. (Cries of "Go on; go
on.") Oh, no. you see it is now fifteen
minutes past 9, and there are others who
will entertain you. I thank you. I appre
ciate the compliment, but let others en
tertain you for the balance of the even
ing.
JACOB NEFF TELLS OF
THE CONVENTION
Following the close of Mr. Gage's ad
dress Chairman Scott introduced Jacob
H. Neff in the following words:
"In every community in this country
there exists a man of sterling honesty,
purity of life and whose great heart
beats for all the people, the rich and
the poor alike. Such a man is Jacob
H. Neff, whom I now have the great
honor of introducing to you."
Mr. Neff said: Mr. Chairman, ladies
and fellow citizens of San Franciscoâ lt
affords me great pleasure to meet this
magnificent audience. I see that I am
down upon this card for a few remarks.
Those remarks will be very brief indeed.
We have here, this evening, our distin
guished United States Senator, Honorable
George C. Perkins. (Applause.) He will
discuss the political issues of the day in
an able mannerâ far more able than I am
capable of doing. Our distinguished fel
low-citizen, our nominee for Governor,
has passed upon the principal questions
of the day, the attacks that have been
made upon him and upon the ticket re
cently nominated in the city of Sacramen
to by the Republican State Convention.
I fully concur with him that no influence,
no corporate power, dominated that con
vention. It was a convention of the peo
ple, a convention of delegates elected by
the people and not appointed by a com
mittee of one hundred. I had the pleasure
of presiding over that distinguished
body, and no one could look upon the
faces upturned there and say that a hire
ling of the railroad company was among
that great body. They were all men, free
born, of lawful age. and permitted to act
entirely for themselves.
Now, I have said that I would be very
brief in my remarks. When I accepted
the honor of the nomination for Lieuten
ant Governor upon the Republican State
ticket I indorsed the platform, and to
that platform . l propose to adhere, I be
lieve in an efficient and honest State gov
ernment. 1 believe that every branch of
the government should be conducted with
the greatest degree of efficiency, purity
and economy. If you, fellow-citizens, be
lieve that I am the proper person to be
elected to the position of Lieutenant Gov
ernor I shall faithfully, honestly and to
the best of my ability discharge theduties
that may be incumbent upon me. With
this I conclude and bid you all good
night.
SENATOR PERKINS
ON LIVE ISSUES
Senator George C. Perkins was intro
duced by Chairman Scott, and spoke as
foilovvs:
This splendid assemblage of representa
tive men and women indicates far more
potently than mere words could do that
the great heart of the people of San Fran
cisco is in complete accord with the Re
publican party. It indicates that Califor
nia will in the coining election bestow a
well-earned and well-deserved vote of
confidence on President McKinley and in
dorse with a Republican majority his ad
ministration of the affairs of the nation.
The coming election, following hard
upon the heels of war, while the terms of
peace are unsettled and in "process of ne
gotiation, is of vital importance, not only
to the people of this State, but it rises
to the dignity of national importance.
Aside from the election of a Governor,
two Justices of the Supreme Court ana
other State officers, we are to elect seven
members of Congres and the members of
our State Legislature, who, in turn, will
elect a United States Senator to represent
this State for the ensuing six years; and
I ask you, gentlemen, with the construc
tion of the Nicaragua-canal, the Hawaiian
cable, the readjustment of the commerce
of the Pacific, if it is not important to see
to it that our next Senator is onÂ« who will
be In accord with the administration,
which will have so much to do with the
uetermining of these great questions.
Republican Record.
The Republican party comes with con
fidence bclore the people and submits its
record of the past as a guarantee of its
future good faith. Every promise made,
every assurance given to the people in Itff
national platform, has been sacredly kept
and carried out in spirit as well asm letter.
Our Democratic friends complain that we
are always talking- about our record.
Why should we not talk about our record
when it will bear the searching light of
investigation and criticism? They uo not
discuss or refer to their own record, and
1 don't blame them for not doing so. in
speaking of the Democratic, Populist and
Silver Republican parties 1 speak of them
as different political parties, and of toe
members as i wouid of the stockholders
of a corporation. For instance, I know
many persons who are stockholders In the
Peoples Savings Bank of this city, Iney
are honorable, high-minded gentlemen,
but the corporation in which they are
stockholders swindled every man, woman
and child who hau any business dealings
with it. And so it is with many Demo
crats, Populists and Silver Republicans.
As individuals they are honorable, high
minded gentlemen; but i am afraid of
their corporation. It needs some kind of
overhauling. They have Just solemnized
a triple marriage at Sacramento, and have
spawned a new political partyâ a sort of
political rag baby; but it cannot save them
from suspicion.
I honor a m*n or a woman who stands
up and fiirhts bravely for a well-defined
principle, although I may differ with their
views. It was so with the good old-fash
ioned Democrats. I respected them for
the honest zeal with which they advocat
ed State rights, free trade andmany other
public policies on which I held diametri
cally opposite views. I also respected
the Populists for their proposed socialis
tic administration of public affairs, and
believed then and believe now that they
were honest at that time in advocating
the Government ownership of railroads
and the general paternal form of govern
ment. Even our Silver Republican friends
I believed honest in their advocacy of the
free coinage of silver. But when all of
the followers of all these "isms" hayÂ»
combined and centered upon one candi
date, when they come together with
their incongruous and contradictory plat
forms and center uÂ£on one man who
shall represent them all. then I begin to
bo'ifvr tbat their vaunted principles have
been abandoned in a mad and undignified
chase for public office and emoluments.
Grave* Contradictions.
When a man runs on three separate
platforms, made by three political parties
differing so widely in their principles that
they refuse to become and cannot become
one party, a suspicion is at once raised
that that man wants office very badly
or that he enjoys riding; three odd-sized
horses at once, with each .going in a dif
ferent direction. The French statesman
Gambetta once said qt an opponent that
he was not to be trusted by either of two
political parties, because he had a leg in
each camp; and I think Gambetta was
right. Now let us consider these plat
forms.
The Democratic platform demands the
free and unlimited coinage of silver at
16 to 1. It commends the Democrats In
THE SAN FKAJN CISCO CALL, SUNDAY, UUIuBER 2, 18iÂ»Â».
Congress for favoring "all measures" for
the support of our arms in the war with
Spain, and also commends the same Dem
ocrats in Congress for opposing the war
revenue bill, without which our .. arms
could not have been supported at all.
They appear to favor the war, but are
against its prosecution. '" . - â¢â '_
Then the platform reiterates the posi
tion of the party on the railroad issue. -It
has been reiterating that for many years.
It has elected Governors, Legislatures ana
Railroad Commissions by that reiteration,
and when in power has forgotten its re
iteration, and has not reiterated any more
until it wanted office again. ? <--
That platform wants the poll tax abol
ished and is silent about other taxes. The
Democratic platform commends the con
dition of State affairs under Governor
Budd, and lauds him for the high condi
tion of things, while the Populist plat
affairs under form begins by saying there
form begins by saying there is urgent ne
cessity of reform in the State government,
which Is pretty rough on the Governor.
The Populist. platform also calls for the
initiative and the referendum; for direct
legislation >by the people, for the abolish
ing of representative government, for
the denying of the right of review by the
courts or of veto by the Governor. â¢>.:-
Cheap Paper Money..
It demands the immediate Issue of Irre
deemable paper currency by the Govern
ment and the free coinage of stiver. Why
in the name of reason should we coin
silver or gold, if we are to immediately
issue irredeemable paper currency? Run
ning a printing press is cheaper than run
ning the mint. The Populist platform
further demands that the Government bid
in the Central Pacific road and operate
the same for the benefit of the people.
The Democratic platform demands that it
be held by the Government as a public
highway, on which the Democratic can
didate for Governor says that every man
shall have the right to run his own loco
motives and cars. All of us who keep
our own cars and locomotives can then
hitch up and take a spin on the rail. But
the Populists want the Government to
run the cars. As the Democratic Popu
list candidate for Governor indorses both
platforms, he indorses these two opposite
plans. Believing him an honest man, it
is not clear to me how he can believe in
both propositions.
The Populist platform wants the war
with Spain prosecuted with overwhelm
ing vigor. It is probable Spain found that
this was done. At any rate she has not
SENATOR GEORGE C. PERKINS ADDRESSING THE THRONG AT WOODWARD'S PAVILION.
complained of any lack of vigor in the
promises.
It also demands the repeal of the poll
tax and exemption of small homesteads
and persona] property from taxation, but
demands a graduated income and inheri
tance tax. As an income is personal prop
erty, and such property passes by inheri
tance, it is 'somewhat difficult to see how
such taxes can be levied when personal
property is exempt from taxation.
The platform views with alarm the
number of unemployed people. A good
way to Flop that would be for the Popu
list to go home, vote the Republican
ticket and stop forever hammering politi
cal tomtoms that frighten men from em
barking in enterprise. Let him insure us
an undisturbed Republican administra
tion and I will insure him that no one
with a pair of hands and a willingness to
work will remain unemployed.
The Dissenting Pops.
The Populist platform, being for paper
money, Government operation of rail
roads, Government ownership of all pub
lic utilities, for the abolition of represen
tative government, for the exemption
from taxation of personal property, for
immediate reform of the State govern
ment, which the Democratic platform
says Governor Budd has reformed to per
fection, one sees the strain it must be
upon a candidate to have one leg on this
platform and one on the Democratic plat
form, which sets up doctrines diametri
cally opposite to these.
The Silver Republican platform com
mends the administration of President
M< Kinky, mid the Demo- ratic-Populist
candidate for Governor has indorsed it,
while he has also indorsed the condemna
tion of the President by the Populist and
Democratic platforms.
Talk about Jefferson! "Why, if he were
alive to-day he would be a member of
the Republican party, and wi-'.ild say as
the Savior of mankind said to the money
changers who had established themselves
In the Temple of the Lord. They preach
the principles of Jefferson to uphold and
perpetuate modern agrarianisms. Did you
ever know of a Populist or a Silver Re
publican that had been a washed-out Re
publican who was not always boasting
that he had once been a Republican?
Like an old toper, he had seen better
days, and was sorry old friends had
drifted away from him.
Railroad Issues.
Now what are the real issues before
the people in this political campaign?
Certainly It is not the railroad question
or national politics, nor is It State poli
tics. The question of freight and fares
is being settled, not by Democrats, Popu
lists or Board of Railroad Commissioners,
but by competition. California is not op
posed to railroads as railroads. Its atti
tude toward them is hostile only when
they are oppressive or when they step
aside from their legitimate business to
influence legislation or to secure the de
feat or success of political candidates.
In verification of that statement I have
but to call attention to the railroad re
cently constructed down the great San
Joaquin Valley, the stock of which was
subscribed and paid for by the merchants
of this city.
The collection of the amount due the
Government from the Central Pacific
Railroad Company is not an issv in this
campaign. That question has been set
tled. When President McKlnley assumed
the duties of his * -h office he discovered
that his predecessor had arranged for a
compromise of the Union Pacific indebt
edness; that he had accepted a guarantee
of $45,000,000 for a debt of about $66,000,000
due the Government, or but litue =more
than 60 cents on the dollar. President
McKinley believed a larger sum could be
realized, and he directed notice to be
served upon the corporation that the
Government must have a positive guar
antee of a larger sum, or fie would pro
ceeed to foreclose the lien upon the road
and offer it for sale to the highest bid
der. To make a long story short, after
several months the company came to his
terms and the Government received every
dollar, principal and interest, amounting
to over $66,000,000, which was put into the
treasury of the United States.
Effect of the Tariff.
When President McKinley assumed the
duties of his high office he found, upon a
review of the ousiness history of the
country, that the four preceding years
had been a period of general depression
throughout the land, although there had
been no drought, no epidemic of disease,
no tornado or earthquake which mignt
have produced these results. Yet the fact
remained that men were idle, that rolling
mills, machine shops, factories, coal and
Iron mines were closed down, the arm of
industry was paralyzed and employes
were marching in squads and armies from
one State to another in search of em
ployment and knocking at the halls of
Congress for Governmental relief. Re
publicans claimed that all of this misery
and idleness was caused by national legis
lation, which had thrown our ports and
warehouses open to the products of other
lands, bringing our people into competi
tion with the cheap labor of Europe and
the servile peon of Asia. President Mc-
Kinley therefore believed It his patriotic
duty not to wait until Congress should
convene â eight months laterâ but he im
mediately caled that body together in
special session, and by message recom
mended them to so revise our present
tariff laws as to protect American indus
tries and stimulate manufacturing, so
that work might be given to the unem
ployed. Congress immediately commenced
its labors, and not three months
passed before a general revival of busi
ness ensued. Confidence was restored
throughout the land and an air of general
prosperity prevailed. I will not weary
you by reciting, as I could, the number
of factories, machine shops and rolling
mills that commenced to operate in New
England, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Alabama
and other States in immediate response
to this magical touch. I will content my
self with the simple statement that the
wheels of industry began to hum; the
very atmosphere seemed changed, and the
people looked forward with hope and con
fidence in the future.
Imports of Gold.
During the fiscal year ending June 30
last, there has been received In the
United States $09,849,059 in gold net from
foreign countries, which I am told by one
of our leading local bankers represents
the balance of trade In favor of this coun
try. Ho als.u assured me that this mar
velous increase was the result of Con
gressional adiustation and the restora
tion of confidence in business circles by
reason of the election of a Republican
administration. Thus a greater amount
of money in good gold has been added to
the sum already in circulation than could
have been added in silver by the mints
to Hoe coinage in three years, running the
three mints to their full capacity. Three
months have elapsed since the beginning
of the present fiscal year and there has
been no cessation of the flow of gold to
the United States. There ha? been re
ceived at San Francisco in three months
$15.U00,000 and there is now on th^ way
from Australia to this port over $3,000,000.
The Friend of Labor.
The Republican party, recognizing the
fact that labor is the source- of all power
and wealth, has ever been the friend of
labor; not by jingling and meaningless
declarations in its platforms, but by vigo
rous action and by uuch wise legislative
policy as will elevate and advance the dig
nity of labor. During the previous admin
istration Congress passed a bill, known
as the "non-partisan labor- commission."
It went to President Cleveland during the
closing days of Congress, buc he neglected
to sign it and it failed to become a law.
The present Congress took it up again
and it passed the Senate and House of
Representatives and was signed by Presi
dently AlcKinley the day it was presented
for his signature. It provides that there
shall be nineteen commissioners; rive se
lected by the Senate, five appointed by the
Speaker of the House of Representatives
juid nine appointed by the President. It
is further provided that these commis
sioners shall be selected from different
fiolitical parties and represent respective
y the different branches of labor; from
the coal miner and the mechanic; from
the farmer and the agriculturist; from the
professional man and the merchant. They
are to meet from time to time and care
fully weigh and consider the various
phases of the labor question as presented
by the different labor organizations of the
several States and Territories of the
Union, and from the knowledge so ac
quired devise and recommend such legis
lation as will best protect and dignify
labor. The commission has already beei.
appointed and it consists of representa
tive men from the different States of the
Union, and I doubt not that their work
will be productive of great good to the
people.
The last Congress also passed a law
making the application of the eight hour
6ystem of labor upon public buildings ap
ply to subcontractors as well as original
contractors of the Government. That Is,
the contractor who has been awarded the
excavation and construction of our new
postofflce building in this city cannot sub
let it to contractors who will work their
men twelve or fifteen hours per day. Do
you want any stronger evidence that the
Republican party is the friend of labor?
American Seamen.
The present Congress also passed a bill
for the protection of American seamen
and the fostering of commerce: it passed
the House of Representatives and
the Senate, but having received
many amendments, all of which met the
approval of the owners of ves
sels as well as those who ihan them.
Is now mutually satisfactory to both par
ties at Interest r and in the early days of
Congress, when it assembles in Decem
ber, these amendments will undoubtedly
be concurred in by the House of Repre
sentatives and the bill become a law,
thus giving further evidence of our par
ty's interest in our seamen upon the seas,
as well as our workingrmen who live at
home with us.
I believe in the. dignity of .labor. I be
lieve in good wages for manVand woman.
I believe that the best interests of this
country are subserved when the laboring:
man, the mechanic, the artisan aiid the
farmer earns wages that enable him to
support himself and family, clothe and
educate his children, thus preparing them
for the great duties of American citizen
ship. And that is one of the reasons why
I had rather see the sugar beet cultivated
on our farms In California by free Amer
ican labor than encourage the raising or
sugar by peon and servile labor In the
far away possessions. I believe in pay
ing our labor in the best money in the
worldâ ana for that reason I want to see
our silver dollar as it is â as good as a
gold dollar In any other land on God s
footstool.
Single-Tax Theory.
The single tax advocates find encour
agement for the adoption of their pet
theory in the fact that several of â¢*â¢ most
zealous champions have been nominated
on the Democratic-Populist ticket for"
high positions of honor and influence.
There is a difference of opinion among
the friends of this new economic meas
ure as to its practical application. All, I
think, however, will agree that it is pro
posed to collect all of the revenue for the
support of the State, county and munici
pal government, public schools and other
institutions by a direct tax upon land
regardless of the improvements. It is
not clear to my mind why the owner of
property situated upon Market, Mont
gomery and other streets in this city
should be exempt from paving taxes
upon improvements that bring an income
of $20,000 per month, while his neighbor,
who owns a similar lot, but- is only able
to construct a cheap building, capable of
yielding an income barely sufficient to
pay insurance and Interest, should be
taxed equally heavy. Why should railroad
cars and locomotives, banks, merchandise,
money, jewelry and all other personal
property be exempt from taxation? Why
should the burden fall upon the farmer
who tills the soil early and late to make
a living? Why shouiu the poor man who
has a small lot upon which he has built
a home cottage be compelled to pay all
of the taxes for the supoort of the Gov
ernment, while the rich personal prop
erty holder is exegnpt? The reason is not
clear, unless it be based upon the prin
ciple that they are always willing to let
others bear the burden and heat of the
day while they recline in the shadow.
Duty of the Voter.
Let us for the moment dismiss all parti
san pride and put behind us every con
sideration of political preference or preju
dice.
t*t us. as American citizens, look the
truth squar<!y in the face, for it can do
no harm. As between man and man, I
want to ask of every Democrat, of every
Fopulist and of every free silver Repub
lican within sound of my voice if ever
within their recollection the prospects of
this nation soemen brighter or more cer
tain than they <i'> to-day?
I want to ask them how and where
they would or could improve past con
ditions any more rapidly or effectually
than is now being done. And, finallyâ and
1 want to put this question squarely to
themâ ls not the Republican party fairly
and honestly entitled to all of the honor
and all of the credit for this beneficent
change that has taken place in the condi
tion of our nation within the past two
years?
Jn times of depression and of public
misfortune I do not question the right of
a I'tmocrat or a Populist to fish some
strange theory of government from out
the waPtebiiskot of political economy; but
I am inclined to question the motives and
strongly doubt the loyalty and the wis
dom of the American citizen who, stub
bornly turning his face against the truth,
refuses to acknowledge this nation's un
questioned prosperity simyly because it
has been brought about against his
prophecies by the wisdom of a rival poli
tical party. There never was a better time
for straying Republicans to come back
into the familiar fold; there never was a
better time for Populists to concede that
the groat principles of Republicanism are
framed for the nation's best interests;
and there never was a better time for
Democrats to purify their own party by
abandoning it until it has settled back
to some hontvt principles that do not
threaten the integrity and very existence
of our nation.

tlon that has now in hand the settlement
of the terms of peace, which are quite as
important as the war itself. We must
buckle on our armor and stand by the
man at the helm. We have demonstrated
to the world that as soldiers there are no
Democrats, no Populists, no Republicans
âand w<> must also show them that as
citizens we stand by the chief executive
and great commander of our army and
navy, no matter what nis politics may be.
This Is the doctrine that will govern the
conduct of the noblest type of American
citizens on next election day.
We will vote as Americans, not as par
tisans, and we s^all demonstrate to all
the world that, despite the promptings of
party pride or prejudice, we are above all
things in the world Americans; that we
are true to our country and its flag, and
willing, nay, more than willing eager
to sustain our administration and justify
this war in the eyes of all the world.

The United Labor Party.
The following 1 communication has been
received at this office:
San Francisco Sept. 30, 1898.
Editor Call: In your issue of to-day are
many allegations of a malicious charac
ter, emanating from some society calling
themselves a "Building Trades' Council,
tending to injure the reputation of the
executive committee of "The United La
bor Party."
I will state as one of the members of
that committee and also as an independ
ent candidate for Supervisor from the
Second Ward, that all the statements con
tained in your paper are utterly false, and
show the great fear that exists in the
minds of certain corrupt and unscrupu
lous politicians, who seem to find in the
Building Trades' Council a medium
through which to propagate their calumny
and slander, the origin of which is well
known to all who have followed the course
of tho body referred to. The United La
bor party is still in the ring and is try
ing to exercise its influence for the good
of the working masses.
As a contractor and builder of twenty
years' standing in this community, I will
stake my reputation as to the character
of this party. I am. sir, yours truly.
JOHN HATES.NEWS OF THE DEATH OF CHINA'S
EMPEROR HAS BEEN CONFIRMED
Poison, Strangulation, Torture
With a Redhot Iron and Sui
cide Stated as the Cause.
Conflicting Stories Regarding the Death
of the Ruler of the Flowery King
dom Which Leave His Fate
in Doubt.
LONDON,- Oct. 2.â A spe
cial dispatch from Shang
hai says: The announce
ment of the death of the Emperor
is confirmed. The reports as to
the means employed in his taking
off differ. One story has it that
he died of poison and another
that death was caused by stran
gulation, while a third states that
he was subjected to frightful tor
ture, a red-hot iron I eing thrust
through his bowels.
LONDON, < vt. Iâ A spe
cial dispatch from Shanghai, pub
lished to-day, says telegrams fur
nished by the Tao Tai, or local
Govern* 'f. to a Chinese paper
allege lliat the Emperor of China
tted suicide on September
21, after signing the decrees
which placed the Dowager Em
- at the head of affairs in
China.
This, it is added, is understood
to mean that the Emperor was
assassinated.
All the English-speaking- sec
retaries and the principal mem
of the Chinese Foreign
Office, it is said, have been seized
and banished. The British For
eign Office to-day received a dis
patch from her Majesty's Min
ister at Peking saying that Mr.
Mortinem. a member of the
British legation, while returning
home yesterday with a lady, was
insulted and attacked by a mob,
which stoned him and covered
him with mud.
Later in the day, the dispatch
added, some American mission
aries were similarly attacked, as
was the Chinese secretary of the
United States legation. The
latter's ribs were broken.
Sir Claude M. Macdonald,
British Minister at Peking, re
ports that there is a dangerous
feeling abroad.
Steps have been taken to call
che attention of the Chinese Gov
ernment to these outrages.
A later dispatch from Shang

No wonder so many sales

fer from indigestion and constipation and
bilious troubles. No wonder they are sub-
ject to the diseases of the delicate special
organism of their sex. The wonder is
rather that they can stand it as well as

But "a poor weak woman," as she is

troubles.

MADRID, Oct. i. â The Imparcial to-day says: Anything
which suggests of a continuation of the war should be re
jected by Spain. This is relative to the Philippines, which
the leading papers of the country openly discuss the wisdom
of relinquishing.
NEW YORK Oct. I.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Satisfactory progress in the
peace negotiations with the Spanish
commissioners is being made by the
American commissioners, according to
a dispatch received to-day from Judge
Day. From the tone of Day's mes
sage the authorities are satisfied that
there is no truth in the press reports
emanating from Paris that the work
of the commission is likely to be pro
longed and that there will be great dif
ficulty in bringing about an agreement.
It is the belief of officials that the
French press in making these gloomy
utterances is inspired, and that it is
hoped by these means the American
representatives will ameliorate their
demands, which are believed to be se
vere. â 
Day said in his dispatch that the
commissioners are being treated with
the utmost courtesy by the French au
thorities and they have been accorded
every facility to secure the prompt ac
complishment of their work. It was
stated at the State Department to-day
that the commissioners will probably
be the only ones to consider the Span
ish request for permission to reinforce
the Spanish garrison in the Vizcayas
Inlands. No protest has been made to
this Government concerning the mat
ter, but it is learned that it is true that
through the French Embassy the Span
ish Government some time ago made
certain representations to the United
States regarding the failure- of the in
surgents to observe the suspension of
hostilities, and this Government prom
ised and has exerted its good offices to
prevent a continuance of the strife.
Rear Admiral Dewey has made no re
port of any operations against Uoilol,
and I was told to-day by an official
that he doubted if the United States
could object to Spain reinforcing her
troops in the islands outside of Luzon
unless on the ground that such action
was aimed against this Government.
PARIS, Oct. I.â The American and
Spanish peace commissions assembled
for their first business session at 2
o'clock this afternoon in the rooms as
signed them for their deliberations in
the French Foreign Office on the Quai
d'Orsay. A special entrance is set apart
for the use of the commissioners in
order to furnish them with every pri
vacy and convenience possible.
The morning sun entered the apart
ment cheerily by day and was made
brilliant by night by two huge crystal
chandeliers fitted with electric lights.
The Foreign Office authorities have
wholly turned over the suite of rooms
devoted to the Peace Commissioners.
No persons, even French officials, are to
be allowed to enter the rooms while
the commission is using them.
France, as the Minister of Foreign
Affairs, M. del Casse, remarked at the
breakfast which he gave in honor of the
two commissions on Wednesday last,
has thus effaced herself, after bringing
the two commissions in touch and sup
plying them with quarters for their
conference.
The session of the Peace Commissions
lasted ninety minutes. The next ses
sion will take place Monday at 2 in
the afternoon. Both commissions main
tained secrecy as to their proceedings.

MILLION DOLLAR
CONFLAGRATION AT
COLORADO SPRINGS
Section Four Blocks Long and
Two Wide Denuded of
Buildings.
Antlers Hotel, One of the Largest Hostelries in
the West, Included in the Burned
Structures.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Oct.
1. â This city had a visitation of fire this
afternoon which threatened for four
hours to destroy the entire business
district. The wind was blowing at the
rate of forty-five miles an hour from
the southwest when the fire started at
the Denver and Rio Grande freight de
pot at the foot of Cucharas street at
2:10 p. m., and the flames spread with
great rapidity.
A strip four blocks long from north
to south and two blocks wide from
east to west has been burned over, but
at 8 p. m. the conflagration was believ
ed to be under control. The flames are
still leaping high into the air all over
the burning district, but the wind has
died down and there is no doubt that
the fire engines which have come from
Denver and Pueblo In response to ap
peals for aid will be able to confine
the flames within the present limits.
The Antlers Hotel, one of the largest
in the West, three lumber yards and
two blocks of business houses have
been destroyed. In round numbers the
loss is estimated at $1,000,000; insured
for one-half of that amount. The losses
estimated are as follows:
Antlers Hotel, $350,000.
Nf-wton Lumber Company, $GO,OOO.
Crissey & Fowler Lumber Company,
$30,000.
El Paso Lumber Company, $35,000.
Irvine & Sons, blacksmiths. $2000.
Denver and Rio Grande Railroad, $30,000. !
Gulf depot, $5000.
Home Hotel, $3500.
General losses of business firms and in
dividuals not enumerated above, $460,000.
The fire started in a pile of rubbish |
underneath the pFatform at the Den
ver and Rio Grande freight depot, j
Within five minutes it had communi- i
cated to freight cars standing at the j
depot, and it spread so rapidly that it
was impossible to move any of the cars, j
A half-car of powder consigned to G. ]
S. Barnes & Sons exploded.
The cans were thrown hundreds of j
feet, and the wonder is that nobody was j
injured.
Then came the terrible danger to the
city. Great chunks of fire were scat
tered about and in a few moments the
Crissey & Fowler lumber yards, 500
feet away, were burning. The wind was !
sweeping a perfect hurricane. The i.
flames rushed through the lumber yards |
and burned all the light frame build- j
ings in the block. Then they leaped j
across the street and burned the El j
Paso Lumber Company's yard and the
paint establishment of Sperry & Tuclc
erman. A few minutes afterward the
Newton lumber yards caught. For a'â 
time after this it looked as if the Ant- ;
lers .might be saved, but the heat was j
too great. There was not water enough
to send a stream half way up the build- i
ing. At 4 o'clock it was burning on the !
south end and the famous hotel was
doomed. / :
The colored employes of the hostelry
showed great intrepidity in climbing
out of the upper windows in the face of I
an infernal heat and pouring water !
upon the fire through a small hose, i
They left their posts only after they I

i became positively untenable. Down
below the firemen were also directing
I streams upon the buildings, but the
water pressure had become so reduced
that the streams were of little effect.
The Antlers Annex was quickly in
j flames and went up rapidly. Two or
j three explosions were heard while the
] Antlers was burning and they are pup-
I posed to have come from the boilers.
j All of the Antlers people, from the en
gineers to the bell boys, stayed at their
posts until they could stay no longer.
At 6 o'clock all that was left of the
j once beautiful Antlers was a mass of
i blazing debris. Thousands gazed upon
I it with sorrow and regret, as it was
I universally conceded to be the chief
j ornament of the town.
The Antlers was a beautiful six-story
' building, owned by the Colorado
j Springs Hotel Company, in which Gen
i eral Palmer was heavily interested.
! The lessee proper was E. Burnett. ThÂ±
building was insured for $200,000 and
the furniture, valued at $57,500, was in
sured for $31,500. The building and
contents are almost a total loss. The
hotel will be rebuilt.
There were several guests in the
hotel, including a number of invalids,
but all were got out in safety and taken
to comfortable quarters.
The Union Pacific, Denver and Gulf
railroads passenger depot on Huerfano
street was burned, but the other rail
road passenger stations were un
harmed.
While the big fires were burning sev
eral small ones broke out in the city,
destroying several residences and
throwing people into consternation.
The limits of the burned district are
the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad
on the Cascade avenue on thQj
east, Pikes Peak avenue on the north
and Cucharas street on the south.
Among the business houses burned
out were the following: MacFarland &
Hills, blacksmiths; Irving & Sons,
blacksmiths; Silver Moon Restaurant;
Kelly Coal Company, Felix Americano;
Bloom, tailor; Dletz, blacksmith; John
Kline, painter: Bartlett, blacksmfth;
Creamer & Jordan, blacksmiths; Mask
owitz, clothing; A. Shapiro, clothing;
J. M. Holliwan, shoemaker; S. K. Kline,
jewelry; Marlow Bros., confectionery;
Campbell, feed store; second-hand
store, restaurant and grocery next to
the Gulf depot. Salvation Army Hall,
Columbia Clothing Company, Seldom
ridge warehouse.
Their losses range from $500 to $5000
each.
Ten partly loaded freight cars on the
Denver and Rio Grande tracks were
burned. Several arrests have been
made to-night of persons suspected of
starting or attempting to start fresh
fires, but there is no question that the
first fire at the Denver and Rio Grande
freight house was entirely accidental,
possibly caused by a spark from a loco
motive. ___________

Special Dispatch to The Can.
DENVER, Oct. I.â The forest fires
which are devastating the western por
tion of the State are burning with un
abated fury, only subsiding where fuel
is exhausted. A special to the Rocky
Mountain News from Red Cliff says:
Nothing is heard in Eagle County but
talk of fire from all sections. From
reports of new territory in the grasp
of the demon, when a providential
storm comes and the summing up is
made, there will be little timber left to
tell the tale. A new country now send
ing volumes of fire and smoke heaven
ward is Bear Willow and Lake creeks,
a magnificent stretch of forest. This
fire from its direction will sweep on
to Camp Fulford, which has already
been scorched from another direction.
Ranchmen on Gore Creek are having
a desperate time saving their homes,
as the Gore range foothills here send
a continuous run of flame for miles.
Along the side hills near Minturn even
the ground is burning: Cattlemen are
getting their cattle into unburnt dis
tricts as rapidly as possible, and even
then are compelled to keep a. close
â¢watch on them and keep them moving.
A regular gale is blowing throughout
the county, which means thÂ« fast trav
eling fire will be driven forward in a
hurricane of flame. The deserted vil
lage of Gold Park was reduced to ashes
yesterday; dwellings, barns and store
houses and the stamp mill of the Gold
Park Mining and Milling Company
were licked up in a few hours. This
town is three miles from the mouth of
the Holy Cross, and the miners of that
district fought nobly to save the place.
The Holy Cross country suffered ter
ribly. ;â â â  â ;â¢.â â ; â / '':,â  :' . - :
The mines have closed down and the
miners are utterly exhausted from their
night and day battle with the fiend.
Many narrow escapes are reported
from different parts of the country.
Strong men have succumbed to the
smoke and heat and must be carrk-d
off by their comrades. As yet no loss
of life has occurred, but manjj head
of cattle and horses have been burned
up. Notch Mountain, opposite Gilman,
Is a blackened ruin on the Holy Cross
slope. Every bridge, oh Horhestake
Creek is destroyed: the corduroy sec
tion of the road is burned out and in
numerable fallen giant pines -interlaced
all along the line of travel. Thousands
of acres of the finest timber are a thing
of the past. In several places there is
no doubt that the fires are of incendiary
origin. Especially is this so in the vi
cinity of Hooper Mountain. Cotton
wood and Cattle Creek ranches are Be
ing deserted. Shaft houses in the
mountains have been swept away.
There seems no hope of staying the fire'
anywhere. The only hope is in lain or
snow.
The forest fires on the west slope of
the Rockies continue to rage and only
a heavy rain can stop them. In the
vicinity of Steamboat Springs there has
been a rainfall which checked the fires
there, but they are still smoldering a.nd
â will start into life again unless there
shall soon be more rain or snow. Lo
cal Forecaster Bradenburg says he has
observed no change in weather condi
tions that points to rain, though the
welcome prediction of the Weather Bu
reau at Washington for Colorado is
"showers."
Governor Adams said to-day:
"I think the only thing that will put
a stop to the fires is a pood heavy rain.
There is but little use in trying to put
out the fires by the usual means, as the
fire is not continuous. From what I
can hear, it must be in probably flfty
different places. In my opinion the
fires are due wholly to accident. Camp
ers build p. fire, a spark blows into the
underbrush, which is very dry, and a
fire Is the result. It is so easy to start
a fire just now that it is almost impos
sible to ascertain the origin of it.
Sparks from railroad engines may have
caused some fires."
Within a day or two fires have ap
peared on the west slope of the Pike's
Peak Range, and large sections of tim
ber are being destroyed. Great vol
umes of smoke can be seen rolling
over the crest of the range. The fires
seem to be burning fiercely along the
west side of Mount Baldy, which rises
to an altitude of 1300 feet four miles
south of Pike's Peak. At sundown thp
volume of smoke had decreased per
ceptibly.
The people of Pltkln County are be
coming terrified over the havoc
wrought by the fire that is now rae-
Ing near there. The County Commis
sioners are advising with the city au
thorities as to the best method to
check the fire, but as yet no plan has
been outlined.
The fire on White River has burned
over an area of a hundred square miles
and is still sweepinr eastward in a
stretch tep. miles wide.
The people of Upper White River
have fought fire for three weeks, day
and night. They have been aided by
Forest Rangors Dunn and Giblet.
Parties from that section say they have
seen nothing of the other Government
rangers.
The towns of Kokomo and Hahn's
Peak are reported to be in danger from
the fires surrounding them.
Glenwood Si-rings is enveloped in a
cloud of smokp, and the situation in
that vicinity is rapidly becoming
worse.
A special to the Republican from
Breckenridge says: Forest fires are
destroying a great deal of fine timber
in the vicinity of this town and the air
is heavy with smoke. The strong winds
are causing the flres to spread.
A special from Crested Butte to the
NewÃ says: This city is surrounded
by a wall of leaping flames and a ter
rible destruction of property is immi
nent. A veritable hurricane is blowing
and flames are jumping five hundred
feet and traveling five miles an hour.
Many people are fighting fire by means
of back fires. The city is not in great
danger at present, but fire is within a
quarter of a mile of the city limits.

name of Nelson were found this morn

had gone to escape the fire. At another
place a woman and two children were
found in a well. The woman was Md
badly burned that she will die. In one
instance a man had been plowing in a
field and his charred remains and the
carcasses of his horses were found to
gether. All the cattle, horses and other
stock in a large district have been
burned to death. Even the wild animals
could not escape the tlames.

CHIPPEWA FALLS, Wis., Oct. I.â
August Mason of this city, one erf the
most extensive loggers in Wisconsin,
returned to-day from a trip to his
camps at Cedar Lake, Barron County.
He had an exciting experience with for
est fires and reports the entire loss of
all his camps and outfits at Cedar Lake.
He also beiieves that fc-ur of. his n.< n
have lust their lives in the names. Mr.
Mason left the camps with his crew
Thursday morning for the railway sta
tion and they narrowly escaped death.
When they started the fire was eight
miles away, but the wind was blowing
a gale and the flames were rapidly
gaining on them. All rushed for a lake
a mile away, and when the edge of the
water was reached the fire was upon
them. .Men and horses plunged into the
lake and remained there; until the
flames had passed over. The heat and
smoke were almost unbearable. ;
Four of the men of the crew, who
were in the rear of the larger party,
are missing, and Mr. Mason says there
is bo hope that they are safe. They
were Sam Popple, William Brown and
the two McGill brothers, all residents
of Chippewa County. y
The scene, Mr. Mason says, was ter
ribte. i>p every side there was a sea of
fire rapidly growing: and destroying
everything. Knapp, Stout & Co.'s out-,
fits In that locality are all burned, also
nvrr r,OQ oxen. The moans of the ani
mals could be heard- in all directions.
Dozens of farm houses which Mason
passed in the mornmg were nshes in the
afternoon. Many buildings that were at
least a quarter of a mile from the
(roods were destroyed, the flames run
ning along the meadows and fences.
Hundreds are homeless, many even
losing all their household goods. Fred
erick Weishauser has just returned
from a trip through the fire regions. He
ran give no estimate of the amount of
his pine losses.
The following estimate of losses were
made by a prominent lumberman here:
Northwestern Lumber Company, $22,
000; August Mason. $3000: Mississippi
River Lumber Company. $80 000: Chip
pewa Logging Company, $50,000; Knapp,
Stout & Co., $225,000.
The losses include standing timber,
logs, camps and camp outfits. The loss
of farm property In Clark, Barron anrl
Chippewa counties is estimated at $300,
000. .
Latest reports say that all hopes of
checking the flames have been aban
doned. Nothing but rain will save the
enormous amount of property that is
now burning or threatened.
TAMER OF LIONS
FATALLY INJURED
BY HIS CHARGES
Circus Attache flttacKed by Mad
Beasts Wfyle oq Parade iq a
Montana City.
BUTTE, Mont., Oct. 1. â When Lehman Brothers' circus parade
started, this morning: the regular lion tamer was absent and Walter
Blanchard, known as "Zeke Walters," the animal man, took his place
In the h. cage. The lions, three in number, appeared to be in bad
humor on account of the weather. Upon entering South Butte two
of the lions jostled each other in passing and a conflict between
the beasts seemed imminent. Walters cracked his whip, the lash
falling on one of the lions.
With a roar that could be heard for blocks the savage animal
sprang at the keeper and an instant later both brutes had attacked
him. Walters was thrown to the bottom of the cage and the next
instant the three brut<;s were upon him, raining blow after blow i
upon the prostrate man with their great paws. With a superhuman
effort Walters grabbed one of the bars at the side of the cage and
drew himself to his fret, at the same time attemr'ing to fight off
the brutes.
Almost blinded by the torrent of blood from the wounds in his
head Walters made one last desperate effort and painfully dragged â 
himself to the door at the rear of the cage. Unfastening it he leaped
to the street and fell unconscious to the ground. The door slammed
shut after his exit, thus preventing the wcape of the animals. His â 
back is terribly lacerated. The doctors say he cannot Jiv.e.

MANILA, Oct. Lâ No change has

All parties are still awaiting the re
sult of the Paris conference to deter
mine the future of the islands.
Even if a delegation f pom the dicta

offer him a protectorate over the new
"republic," it is not likely the veteran
will commit himself. Aguinaldo has
been forced into action by hotheads
desirous rif securing from Americans
some indication Of the probable policy
of the United States. The dictator
president does not occupy a very firm
seat, and unless some definite result
as to his actions can be shown soon
he realizes that his own life will be en
dangered.
The Americans are settling down for
a long occupation of the city of Manila.

HUMBOLDT BAR
Narrow Escape of the
Chilkat.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
EUREKA, Oct. I.â The Chilkat, the
smallest sea-going passenger boat on
this coast, had the narrowest escape
I from being wrecked that any vessel
ever had on Humboldt Bar. Her size
and the fortunate state of tide and
wind saved her from total destruction
and her passengers from death.
The bar was very rough, the larger
steamers Hueneme and Brunswick be
ing bar-bound, the former on the in
aide and the latter on the outside.
Nevertheless. Captain Anderson at
tempted to cross. The steamer passed
the jetties safely. When she reached
the bar a huge roller struck her,
heading her around. Then another
struck her on the starboard side,
smashing in her side for a distance of
twenty-five feet and five feet above her
guard. Through this opening water
rushed, carrying away the coal bunk
ers, distributing the coal among the
machinery and putting out the fires,
leaving the steamer at the mercy of the
elements.
Fortunately there was a strong flood
tide running at the time, and as thr;
waves had driven her well back toward
the bay she was enabled, with the aid
of a jlbsafl, to make the lighthouse
wharf, where she bow lies. She had
sixteen passengers aboard, including
two women and two children. None
were injured.
To-morrow the steamer will be taken
to Bendixen's shipyard and repaired.
The cargo of butter and household fur
niture was damaged considerably by
water. This was the # first trip on which
she had not carried livestock. She is
owned by C. P. Doe Â«c Co of San Fran
cisco, and has been making regular
five-day trips for a year past.
The passengers were: G. A. Agard,
J. D. McCarthy, J. S. Gill, Rev. G.
Sehletchter, F. A. Coxhead, T. L.. Ber

AGUINALDO'S IDEA OF
THE MONROE DOCTRINE
MANILA, Oct. I.â There is consider
able comment here upon Aguinaldo's
speech at Malolos on Thursday. The
keynote was the indepedence of the
Philippine insurgents. During the
course of his remarks, Aguinaldo said:
"Our friends, the Americans, came for
the purpose of demonstrating the KÂ«n
erosity and grandeur of their Govern
ment and assist in releasing the peo
ple from slavery without annexing the
islands, thus setting a good example.
We now understand and appreciate the
famous Monroe doctrine of 'America
for Americans,' and Justice demands
that they add 'the Philippines for the
Filipinos.' "
The insurgent officials express dis
appointment at the non-attendance of
Americans at the festival at Malolos.
The Provincial Governor has declined
to allow an American officer to inspect
the Dagupan prisons and secure their
plans without Aguinaldo's sanction.
The half caste interpreter used threats,
and consequently Aguinaldo instructed
his troops at the railroad stations be
yond Malolos not to allow any Ameri
can to pass.
The British cruiser Powerful, which
left here a few days ago. has returned.
She only went on a. cruise for target
practice.
Admiral Montijo went to Hongkong

GREAT STAMPEDE
TO RELOCATE RICH
KLONDIKE CLAIMS
Dishonest Methods in Dawson's
Gold Commissiooer's Office
Cause Trouble.
Bribery Seeri)s to Run Raropant and Rights of
Poor Miners Usurped by Powerful
Corporations.
BY SAM W. WALL.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
DAWSOX, N. W. T., Aug. 31.âTo
morrow will witness another of the big
Etampedes, such as have characterized
the history of this camp. And out of
It will no doubt come another of the
outrageous scandals that have gone
hand in hand with them. Under a rul
ing of the Gold Commissioner all claims
upon which the proper representation
work â three months' continuous labor
â had not been done within the pre
scribed time-limit of one year, were to
revert to the crown upon September 1.
It v is given out that these claims were
to b* sold to the highest bidder, but
whether publicly or not was not stated.
A great many claims have not been
properly represented and among them
are some of great value. The reasons
for the r.jn-representation are many.
The scarcity of food at this point last
winter drove many of the owners away
to where they became entangled in
other matters, or to where, for a multi
tude of other reasons, they could not
return within the time. Many of the
claims were sent out for sale and pend
ing negotiations the work was neglect
ed here. As September 1 drew near
Gold Commissioner Fawcett changed
his mind. The reason is not known.
There was a good deal of complaint
concerning and criticism of the ruling
which took so many mure claims out
-of the reacft of the miner and prospec
tor, following that other law that ap
propriated to the crown every alter
nate ten claims on every newly located
creek. At any rate a new order was
promulgated under which the unrepre
sented claims should be throvn open to
all who held miners' certificates for re
location. This was at first hailed with
some joy, which, however, very soon
became tempered with suspicion. It
began to appear that certain persons
were ser-uring information as to the lo
cation of valuable claims where repre
sentation work had not been reported.
Individuals closely in touch with the
Gold Commissioner's office were known
to be canvassing the creeks and takinr
note of all claims where there was even
the slightest technical failure to fulfill
the requirements. Men are posted on
or near the unrepresented claims and
to-morrow will see the driving of a
forest of stakes all through the mining
district and a tremendous rush upon
the Gold Commissioner's office, which
will probably be congested for weeks
to come with applicants for recording.
So great has become the general dis
gust at the mismanagement and evi
dent corruption in the Gold Commis
sioner's office that I hear of a move
ment being talked of looking to the pre
ferment of charges of bribery against
every one connected with it. The men
active in revolt are all of them Eng
lishmen, Canadians and Australians,
the latter being the leaders and by far
the most outspoken in denunciation of
the methods and mismanagement of
the office at this time. Gold Commis
sioner Fawcett is almost universally
acquitted of being a party to fraud or
corruption, but there is little charity
for him on that account inasmuch as it
is allowed such license under his eyes.
Fawcett acts the part of a clerk in his
own oflice and when not engaged in
hearing contests of claims is found
standing at a desk and issuing miners'
certificates or making record of claims
at $10 and $15 a head. He certainly
earns his salary if merely putting in
the full time in his office day by day
does that. Many charge the irregulari
ties of his office to this fact, declaring
that he is so busy with small affairs
that he is unable to see What is so clear
to everybody else.
Prosecuting Attorney Wade .hasÂ». per
haps, of all the high officials of the out
going administration, been most direct
ly and personally criticized as having
fathered or been interested in many of
the monopolies and rings that have
worked to the great harm of the free
(?) miner. The day before he took the
steamer for the outside he attacked a
young newspaper man, Leroy Pelatier,
a Canadian, for having written too
freely concernlrig him to his home
paper. Pelatier was called upon to
withdraw his statements, refused and
was knocked d.own and badly beaten.
Wade is as bigÂ£a fellow as Pelatier is
slight. The took place in the
warehouse of the N. A. T. Company,
and was evidently prearranged by
Wade, the editor of a friendly paper
being present by invitation.
Among the many petty annoyances
to which the people at large are sub
jected is the lack of sufficient clerical

force in the Gold Commissioner's office
and the postoffice. It was thought that
this had been corrected in the post
office, but the long line of impatient
men takes its daily place in front, of the
door now as before. There has been no
interruption in the nuisance at the Gold
Commissioner's. The habit of feeing the
policeman on guard at the side d<>or
by way of gaining admittance has
grown until it is next to impossible to
get in any other way. This is the com
monest and pettiest of the briberies
that make a part of nearly every
transaction with: the Government of
fices, insomuch that Canadians confess
to a sense of shame in being Cana
dians. Within the past few days no
tices have been posted about town to
the effect that exclusive facilities and
privileges have been granted to a
company for securing mail from the
postoffice, and that this company will
deliver mail to individuals promptly
at $6 per quarter and to business firms
at $10 per quarter. It would seem to
one who had grown accustomed to the
methods here that this was only a re
adjustment of the old plan, a transfer
of the required fee from the plain,
yellow-striped policeman to the favored
corporation. A corporation has the
right to place booms at the mouth of
the Klondike, and so no individual has
the right to so much as a stick of drift
wood in that river. A corporation has,
or several corporations have, the right
to the timber on almost all the islands,
and for miles and miles along the
shores of the Yukon, so that individuals
are warned against cutting cabin logs,
and any who do so take great chances
of having them confiscated upon
reaching Dawson. Arrived in Dawson
the individual is confronted with the
I big townsite corporation holding its
building lots at figures impossible to
the average prcspector. He is warned
off the wide stretch of level lands that
is the townsite and compelled to build
his cabin on the distant hills, where it
will be almost a day's job to get water
during the winter.
American doctors and American law
yers are forbidden to practice here.
The lawyers in many cases effected a
compromise by associating themselves
with Canadians, the Americans doing
the office work and the Canadians go
ing into court and appearing solely as
the counsel of record. This worked
very well for both parties, to the ar
rangement, for the great majority of
the population are Americans, and the
American lawyer is thus readier at se
curing clients. With the doctors it was
different, there being no necessity; for
relying upon the Americans, and an
edict absolute was written against
them. One prominent doctor, continu
ing to attend a patient after notice
was served, was thrown into jail. The
patient died and that was another
scandal. No American doctor is per
mitted to put out a sign that he is
SUCh. â¢"";-!
In the meantime the hospitals are
crowded with patients, and typhoid
fever has become epidemic. The grave
yard, now almost in the heart of the
rapidly grown town, gives almost con
i stant occupation to the grave digger.
i There are eighty-three patients in the
Catholic hospital and forty in the re
cently opened Good Samaritan, more
than either has proper provision for.
The capacity- of the Catholic hospital
is being doubled as fast as men can
construct the addition, private hospi
tals are bejng opened and sickness- is
to be found in cabins and tents in ev.ry
part of the town. There is no public
records of the deaths or burials. Since
it opened a short .time ago there have
been two deaths at the Good Samaritan
Hospital â Albert-Smith, a German, and
Duncan Bertram, a Frenchman. There
have died at the Catholic hospital since

and became so popular â with: those go
ing out that she has already returned
the purchase; money. Captain Barring
ton came from the Puget Sound and
was for years in command of a speedy
boat plying between Tacoma and Se
attle.
Robbery and assault, that had be
come notable for its absence, has re~
cently broken out with considerable
violence. The ferryman on the Klon
dike has twice been held up within the
week; a man on the El Dorado trail
was shot at, beaten and robbed a few
days ago; a hole was cut in a window
on Front street and a thief made away
with a handful of nuggets. A number
of thefts are reported of caches. Few
arrests are made. The disgust and
disappointment of thousands who are
camped here, and who know of no other
way to recoup themselves, are In this
finding some expression. On the whole,
however, this is a marvelously orderly
town, considering the composition of it.
The building of the town keeps up its
tremendous pace.
Almost every day sees the foundation
laid for some big warehouse or business
house as well as a score of cabins. The
little city takes on a new complexion
with each week as it passes. The two
big companies, the Alaska Commercial
and North American Trading and
Transportation, are still at the front as
the two largest commercial houses here,
but they are by no means the only ones,
as was the case. last fall/ Immense
warehouses of a full dozen other com
panies have ranged themselves along i
the water front beside them. Tons and
tons and tons of provisions have been
landed here, together with boat loads
of other freight in which is included al
most every article that by any possi
bility might be desired. Prominent in
this varied freight are silk dresses.
There was cv a high silk hat came
to town and a man wore it down
through the main street against a
wager that he dare not. It returned to
to the starting point intact, but ap
peared upon the streets not again.
Thirty boats have landed their freight
and passengers here thus far this sum
mer and many more are on the way.
Many of these brought barges. The
Louise alone, with two barges, brought
nine hundred tons. The Seattle Nos. 1
and 2 have just landed 300 tons of flour.
No, there will be no scarcity of pro
visions this wl.iter, but It is quite evi
dent that a high average price will bo
maintained. Flour Is held at $H> a
hundred and it is likely that will be the .
prtce of it for the Winter; bacon cannot
be bought in' the big stores under 25
cents, while butter is still $1 50 a pound.
Butter is either really scarce or is be
ing withheld from the market. No.ne
of it has a. peared in the auctions for
some time. The cry of the auctioneer is
heard everywhere about the streets In
the evening. He has an infinite varierty
Of wares to sell and they still go off at 'â¢
very low prices, save the provisions >
which run as an average a little below '.
the store prices. The tendency of the
crowd is to get rid of its outfit and get j
out. Rates have been quoted lately as
low as ?60 to St. Michael by regular ;
steamers. Since my Jast dispatch the j
steamers Seattle No. 3 and Seattle No. I

short in his accounts, not more than

DELMAS CLOSES A MOST
POWERFUL ARGUMENT
Possible Evils Should the Demurrer
in the Jarman-Bea Case Be
. ; â¢'. Sustained. :
SAN JOSE. Oct. I.â Attorney Delmas ar
gued all day Friday in the Jarman-Rea
slander case. He finished shortly before
adjournment, after talking for one and a
half ' days. Attorney Morehou.se then
opened his argument in favor of sustain
ing the defendant's demurrer. A few
minutes after he commenced the court
adjourned until- Tuesday morning, at
â which time he will proceed.
Delmas' argument was strong and con
vincing. He said that if the cemurrer
were sustained and Jarman had no cause
of action it would let bars down for every
gang slanderer to make a house to house
canvass at the forthcoming election and
maliciously attack the reputation, of re
spectable candidate.
The outcome of: the argument on the
demurrer is watched with interest. If
the demurrer is- sustained it means a dis
missal of the case.

TO RUIN MARKET STREET.
THE CALL of yesterday published the outlines
of a proposed scheme for providing the lighting
of Market street without expense to the city. In
bru â¢;". the plan involves letting the Market Street
Company erect poles in the center of the thorough
fare for the operation of an overhead trolley line; in
return, the company to surmount the poles with lights,
these to be maintained at its expense.
In other words, San Francisco is to permit and
perpetuate the overhead trolley where it should not
be allowed for an instant, is to rum the great street
in which it is beginning to take renewed pride. Hav
ing made a sacrifice so vast that it could not be com
puted in money, having fixed a blot and menace of
live wire overhead, having marred the aspect of the
street above and below, destroyed its beauty and cur
tailed its usefulness by a row of hideous iron poles,
each one a separate peril, citizens are to be asked
to- think they have paid no price for the illumination
such as is to be shed over a mutilated Market street!
It is a cunning scheme, but it won't work. .
â¢. There must never be an overhead trolley line on
â¢ Market. street. The best system is one which operates
by underground wires, and on a crowded thorough
. fare the overhead style, since a better one is known
and is in successful use, should be regarded as but
of date. There is no reason for allowing the Market
Street Company to spoil the property along which
â¢ it has a double line of cable tracks. When the time
shall come for a change to electricity, let it use the
conduits, it already has to place the wires where they
cannot impede, maim, slay nor spoil the outlook.
The poles, constitute as grave an objection.. The
proposition to despoil Market street of its stately
width by dividing it. into two strips with a row of
poles between is ridiculous from an â  artistic stand
point, and dangerous from a practical one. With,
such obstacles in the road, accidents to horses and
.vehicles would be continuous, while many a passenger
hastily leaving a car would be dazed by sudden con
tact with a castiron monument to the castiron nerve
of the Southern Pacific. .
We advise Mr. Hewitt, who waxes ; enthusiastic
over the foolish notion, to take counsel of his better
judgment. People are not improving Market street
for the purpose of ruining it later for the benefit of
any corporation. There will never be there an over
head trolley line. The privilege could not be pur
' chased, and the city is not to be cajoled out of it by
plausible talk. ;'
JUSTICE BARRY'S DECISION.
JUSTICE BARRY'S decision in the case of
' Costley versus the Wells- Fargo Express Com
pany is published in another column this morn
ing and will be found profitable reading for all who'
have been compelled by the company to pay the war
revenue tax upon merchandise shipped through their
express. Justice Barry decides that the .company it
self must pay the tax, and thereby sustains the posi
tion taken by. Mr. Costley and gives judgment in his.
favor. 'â¢ â¢ .â  . . â¢ . '." . .- ; . â¢â ' .-â â¢'.' '.'.
The victory thus gained by. Mr. Costley is a vic
tory for the community at large.. It is :a complete
vindication of the course of The Call .in the fight it
has made against the unjust demands of the express,
company, upon the public. Every contention of The
Call in. the contest has been sustained. The company
has never had any right to shirk the burden of taxa
tion from itself to .the general public, and. in doing
so has been violating the law as well as' imposing
upon its patrons-: â¢ ; :.-.â¢'. â¢.-
The decision of Justice- Barry is. in line ' : with all
precedents in the case. When the question was first
raised by' the attempt of the express, companies of the
East to shirk their .taxes", the- Attorney-General.ren
dered an opinion adverse to the claims of the corpor-'
ations. Since then Judge Tuley of. Chicago has also
construed the law against them. In fact the express
companies have ne.ither precedent nor.- authority to
sustain them in. their practice of extortion upon the
public, and all the money they have gained in this.
way has been acquired by what.is but little better in
practice and no better in morals than petty' larceny. â 
It is one thing for the people to know their rights
and another to maintain them. Many persons submit
to petty impositions and extortions on the part of
powerful corporations rather than to take the risks of
â¢fighting them. Every citizen, therefore, who makes
a contest for the right deserves the most cordial com :
mendation from his fellow citizens. Mr, Costley has
.merited something more than words of congratula
tion this morning. He has made a good fight for the
public, and. thanks to the unswerving judicial hon
esty of Justice Barry, which was not to be shaken by
the fear of a powerful corporation, he has won a vic
tory that will be of benefit to the whole community.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER g, 1893,
WILL MAGUIRE EXPLAIN?
WHEN called to meet the charge that land con
fiscation by single tax is put in issue by his
candidacy, Judge Maguire said that only 12V2
per cent of the land in this State now belongs to
farmers and that they pay 50 per cent of the taxes,
while under the single tax they would pay only 10
per cent of the taxes, because the exemption of their
' improvements would amount to vastly more than the
increased tax on their land.
The State Board of Equalization from time to
time issues a report of the assessment of the various
kinds of property. The last of these reports at hand
is that for 1894. which we use jtn considering Judge
Maguire's defense of land confiscation by single tax. j
By that report the value of country real estate was
$394,902,357. and of city and town real estate
$320,48 1,523-
The value of improvements on country real estate
was $62,922,145; on city and town real estate $181,
891,926. The values of country real estate and im
provements and city real estate and improvements,
then, compare as follows:
City real estate â¢â¢ $320,481,523
Oity real estate improvements. 181,891, &2t>
Total $502,373,449
Country real estate $394,902,357
Country real estate Improvements .... '62,922,146
Total ....$457,824,502
It will be seen, then, that city real estate and its
improvements pay on an assessment exceeding that
of country real estate and improvements by $44,548,
947, and it will be seen, too, that Maguire's statement
that 12J2 per cent of country land pays 50 per cent of
all the taxes is obviously false, since country realty
and its improvements together is assessed $44,548,947
less than city real estate and its improvements, and
the State tax borne by each is levied equally, the same
number of cents to the dollar on their valuation.
When it comes to the taxation of towns and cities,
their real estate and its improvements have to bear
the State and county tax the same as country prop
erty, -but must carry on top of that also the city or
town tax, which frequently amounts to more than
both the others. This fact adds more to the falsity
of Maguire's statement that i2 l / 2 per cent of the land
belonging to farmers pays 50 per cent of all the tax,
since the farm land does not participate in city and
town taxation at all.
Now let us see how the farmer will stand when
Maguire's land confiscation is accomplished and all
improvements on real estate and all personal property
are exempted from taxation. The improvements and
personal property assessment was as follows:
Improvements of country real estate $ 62,922,145
Improvements of city real estate 181,891,926
Personal property . . . ..... .â¢".; ..... . . . . > . . 163,104,050
Total Â.......>.;.. ....,.................$407,917,111
Hence the tax formerly borne by $407,917,111 of
property will be lifted from it and dropped upon the
land. When this is done, the farmers will have es
caped tax on their $62,922,145 of improvements/ but:

With the improvements. and personal, property ex

70 cents on the hundred to raise, the required sum of
$5511,634,. so that the country real estate would have
paid over three millions in State taxes and city real
estate only about two millions. It will be seen, then,,
that Judge Maguire's statement that when land, is
confiscated by the single tax the former, willpay only
10 per cent of the taxes is just as false as that he pays
50 per cent now, for at the existing assessment coun
try, land will pay more State tax than it pays now.
It will now be in order for Judge Maguire to make
a lightning change by showing the farmers how he
is going to stick the city land-owners for 90 per cent
of all the taxes.
AN ULTIMATUM NEEDED.
SPAIN, according to the reports that come from
Europe, is not yet aware that she has been
thoroughly beaten in war. She does not recog
nize that the United States has the power to dictate
the terms on which peace shall be established. Her
Commissioners at the peace conference have been in-
structed to make claims of such a nature it is
clear the American Commissioners cannot agree to
them, and the inevitable inference is that her officials
hope to prolong the negotiations indefinitely for some
j. purpose not fully understood.
i According to' the reports the Spanish Commis
sioners will maintain that the United States have not
conquered, the Philippines and can rightly demand
there nothing beyond a port and a coaling station;
that if Spain, has to. withdraw her .sovereignty from
the islands she will insist on her right to sell all ex
cept the- territory now in our military possession; that
in all territory surrendered by Spain tjbere shall be
; granted special tariff privileges to Spanish textiles;
that the power whose sovereignty prevails at Manila
! shall assume .the entire Philippine debt, and that the
I entire Cuban debt prior to the last revolt shall be
'imposed upon Cuba. â¢ .
While there arc - grave reasons why the United
\ States should avoid the annexation of the Philippines,
the! Spanish Government cannot be permitted to de
termine-the issues for us. Nor if we should decide to
retain Manila and the district around the bay of that
1 port, can we agree to pay for it by relieving Spain of
: the' whole Philippine debt and taking it upon our
] selves. Neither can we consent to impose upon the
: Cubans the debts the Spaniards have contracted in
I bygone wars- to defray the cost of their attempts to
conquer the people.
. With such reports coming from Europe of the na-
I tur'e of the Spanish claims and thÂ« attitude of the
Spanish Government, it is not surprising the Presi
dent continues to hold the army and the^fcnavy in
readiness for the resumption of hostilities. We can
not consent to negotiate on the basis of claims so
unreasonable, nor can we engage in a long and pro
' tracted discussion of them. There will be needed at
I the Paris conference an ultimatum. The business
ought to be settled in time for peace to be declared
before Thanksgiving day,^ and from the firmness
| which has thus far been displayed by the President
there is every reason to believe it will be.
One bad feature of the forest fires now raging in
various States is that most of them were started as the
direct result of criminal negligence.
SUPERVISOR LACKMANN.
JOHN LACKMANN, Republican candidate for
Supervisor from the Sixth Ward, occupies an
enviable position in the politics of this city.
Not only has he been renominated by his. own party
Svith a unanimity that is remarkable, but even Boss
Phelan's job-chasers have been coaipelled to recog
nize his public services and indorse him. This latter
action was taken by the Mayor's men for self
laudatory purposes; that is te say. Phelan thinks
his indorsement of Lackmann will prove conclusively
that in bossing the Committee of One Hundred he
is governed by one motive only â the public weal. In
order to make this point he gives away a place on
his Supervisorial ticket which he could not have won
for a personal friend under any circumstances.
We know of no case iv the history of San Fran
cisco exactly parallel to that of Supervisor Lack
mann. He will have no opposition in his ward, and
will be practically unanimously elected. Sometimes
we hear of the politicians in Eastern States indorsing
candidates for Judges who do not belong to their
party, and often in this State weak men have been
nominated against popular men on opposing tickets:
but Mr. Lackmann is the first public official who has
in city or State received the compliment of a nomina
tion by all parties for a desirable office.
This fact is important in view of the circumstance
that Supervisor Lackmann is a Republican and the
creation of the Republican party. His record in the
Board of Supervisors shows that in political matters
he is a partisan and believes that Republican prin
ciples ought to control in government. He has not
supported Mayor Phelan's administration in every
thing, though in most matters he has acted with that
official.
The statement of Phelan's committee on Super
visors, therefore, that they have indorsed him because
he has supported the Mayor's job-chasing band of
patriots during the past two years, is untenable. The
real motive of Lackmann's indorsement was to steal
from the Republican party a good official, one whose
record shows that if a Republican Board of Super
visors is elected this year there will be an end of the
boodling and chicanery which has made a majority
of the present board â every one of whom was named
by Mayor Phelan â odious to the public.
But this theft must not be allowed. John Lackmnnn
is a Republican, and the credit for the record which
assured his re-election under any and all circum
stances belongs to him and his party. Phelan can
not steal* a scrip of it. His job-chasers must stand
upon their own records. Last year when the Mayor
ousted the Shifty Eight he hesitated to appoint Lack
mann to the new board. At that time he was averse
to rewarding a faithful Republican and making politi
cal capital for a man who might some time beat a
Democrat for office. It was only after much pressure
had been exerted that Lackmann's appointment was
assured. Now, however, when his own fortunes are
at stake, the little boss is ready to steal the Supervisor
from the Republican party. But he cannot do it.
GETTING TO WORK AT ONCE.
UNLESS something unforeseen intervenes, Chief
Engineer Story of the San Francisco; and San
Joaquin Valley Railroad will set out during the
coming week to inspect the territory through which
the projected line from Bakersfield to Los Angeles
will pass. It is expected this preliminary work wiH be
completed in about two weeks,, and immediately
thereafter a corps of surveyors will take the field to
survey the route. - : â¢.. . y- .' .'â¢â  : . j â¢
It will be seen from this there is to be no delay in
pushing forward the line that is to connect the Val
ley Road: with the railroad system of the. southern
part of the State, thus providing a transcontinental
road to break the Southern Pacific monopoly and
give to the industries and the. trade of. the State the
advantages that accrue from competitive transporta
tion facilities. It may. be regarded as assured that the
rapid work done in constructing the road through
the San Joaquin; will be. duplicated in the new enter
prise as far as the conditions of the country -will per
mit, and that the day of California's emancipation
from railroad domination is at hand.. â  â¢ |
Maguire and. his allied demagogues of the stump
and the press are wise in making as much as they can
out of the anti-railroad sentiment of the people at this
juncture. With the completion of the connecting line
from Bakersfield the Southern Pacific monopoly will
be a thing of the past, and will no longer be an issue
in politics any more thaa an oppression in business.
What the politicians failed to achieve after yenrs of
talking and speech-making will have been accom
plished by a company of business men, and the long
wished-for new era will foe at hand.
In the meantime, while preparations for the sur
vey of the line to Los Angeles are being made, the
work of constructing the extension of the Valley
Road itself from Stockton to Point Richmond is
going briskly forward. Energy is the order of the
day and is rapidly working out the salvation of the
State.

WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
By HENRY JAMES
Because a student of Madison, v\ is.,
has committed suicide, a boon com
panion not long ago having don-e the
same thing, the conclusion is jumped
to by some observers that the young
men belonged to a suicide club. To
asperse the dead is neither fair nor
profitable. Nobody but a fool ever be
longed to such an organization, and
these young men seem to have been
sensible up to the time they grew tired
of living. I am not prepared to say
they were not sensible even then. But
for a man to agree that on a certain
date he will kill himself is for him to
confess to a pernicious brand of idiocy.
Not that 1 would discourage him or in
any manner interfere with his plans,
save perhaps to urge him to make the
date less remote.

Unhappily I am not a critic of the
drama. When I have essayed to be
candid friends have advised me to try
something- else. But 1 can appreciate
any writer who is capable of being one
and therefore my hat is off to the star
of the Bulletin. The most an ordinary
journalist can do in this connection is
to quote. Far be it from me to as
sume to comment adversely, and I am
conscious that words of praise must be
all too faint. In setting forth the suc
cess of "An Enemy to the King" this
star says: "The sun dial scene, with
the faint, half dreary song of the fal
sity of woman's love lulling it into
poetry, is indescribably pretty." I cer
tainly should think so; more than
pretty, unique. A sun dial scene lulled
into poetry is nothing less than a daisy.
The haif dreary song of the falsity of
woman's love would naturally be ef
fective, and if a sun dial scene hap
pened to be in the way it could not
hope to escape. Of course the Bulletin
star noted the effect, but few could
have so fortuitously expressed it. There
is nothing left to be desired except
some more of the same kind. A little
farther down in the criticism It may be
noted that Blanche Bates has been
"capitalized." The amount is not stat
ed, nor the size and frequency of the
dividends, but these are mere details. I
refrain from reproducing other of the
gems. This is an unappreciative world.
If I knew how I would write a faint,
half dreary song on the subject.

The papers state that Rev. J. Q. A.

There has never yet been made pub
lie any reason for believing that the
death of Gregoire in Oakland was the
result of suicide. To be sure, the man
was oddly constituted, both mentally
and physically, but the human being
never lived who could fire five large
and impulsive bullets into his own
breast. The murderer, however, was
thoughtless enough to go away from
there without leaving his autograph,
address and a latch key to his apart
ments. Therefore the suicide theory
is easy and comfortable. I do not
blame the Oakland police. They nat
urally pattern after the superior va
riety controlled by Lees, and these find
relief in suicide every time an assassin
neglects to call around and become con
fidential.

It is far from my purpose to get into
a religious controversy. My belief Is
that each should be permitted to wor
ship God in his own way, provided this
way does not interfere with the pat
tern of worship pleasing to the con
science of another. Yet I venture, in
humility, a remark concerning a com
munication appearing in a recent num.
ber of the Pacific Churchman. The
writer advocates the changing of the
name of the sect to which he adheres
to "The Church of the United States."
I cannot help but entertain admira
tion for hie presumption. It approaches
sublimity. The idea of any one body
of sectarians dubbing themselves "the
church" of a country which, among its
most beneficent regulations, has one
placing a gulf between church and
state, but none supplying a bridge, is
the climax of cheek. Even the supe
rior nerve of the gentleman from whom
I quote would fail to span the ehasm.
Perhaps there is no law which could
prevent the members of a church call
ing themselves anything which strikes
their fancy, but it is to be hoped that
common sense will check the implied
impulse to become ridiculous.
It is time for rigid enforcement of
the law against suicide. Of course
when a successful attempt is made
there is nothing of human avail. The
person who kills himself is beyond re
buke. It is the one who tries it and
fails for whom I cherish a warm dis
regard. He should be sent to prison
for as long a term as though he had
made murderous assault on another. Or
perhaps an asylum is the place for him.
Surely the community is entitled to re
lief from his presence, for a man who
wants to commit suicide and can't do
it is too big a fool to be at large.
There should never be an overhead
trolley line on Market street. The
scheme to permit the building of one
deserves killing. It is enough when
the cable cars are given the privilege
of a double track. The overhead wire
is an abomination. There Is no excuse
for it. It is a blot, unsightly and dan
gerous. It mars the view, creates
fires, interferes with firemen. The
necessary poles are hideous. There
should not be an electric wire of any
sort above ground In San Francisco.
Telegraph, telephone and trolley, bury
them all. If, in the future, there shall
be some proposition for an electric line
on Market to take the place of the
present cable, and the proposition in
clude underground wires, it may per
haps be reasonably entertained.
There is seldom recorded an incident
more pitiful than the death of Mrs. Da
vose of Alameda. A young and happy
wife, she had Just left the home her
presence made beautiful to her hus
band, when she became entangled in a
dangling electric wire and died there
miserably, her agony prolonged. There
was no possibility of aiding her. Even
had she not been alone at the fatal
moment, to have essayed to save her
would but have deepened the tragedy.
Overcome by the horror, the reason of
the husband is in the balance, and per
haps he may never rully realize the
awfulness of the bereavement which
for him swept the sunlight forever from
the skies. I d6 not call the death of
this poor woiian an accident. It was
murder. That wire had been dangling
long where it constituted a trap.
Doubtless there are employes of an
electric concern who understand that
under certain conditions electricity is
a dangerous thing. Nevertheless, the
wire, was permitted to dangle. At last
it caught a victim. That it would do
so sooner or later was a certainty. Why
was the trap maintained? Nobody
with deliberate malice sought to slay.
Somebody with a criminal carelessness,
for which there should be condign -^un
ishment, brought about the slaughter.
People' who live precariously in cities
fairly roofed by wires laden with the
agent of death cannot aftord to regard
this affair as a visitation of Providence,
shudder sympathetically and consider

With difficulty . I have generally,
checked the impulse to put politics
into this column. The election of a
Mayor, however, is something ' which
concerns us all. It seems to me that
as a candidate Patton is in every way
superior to Phelan. I do. not mean to
intimate that the present Mayor is not
a, gentleman, for. he Is, but his career
has been full of mistakes. One of these,
broadly expressed; Is that he has con
stituted himself a political boss. He
has to the smallest detail dictated the
ticket of which he is the head. He has
clamored for purity and laid out the
programme. He has bidden his per
sonal friends to the feast. He has ac
cepted two nominations ahead of the
formulation of either platform. But
worse . than all he has apparently
chosen as chief adviser a man than
whom there is not in public or private
life in San Francisco a more corrupt,
and I cannot think the official who
leans upon him can be inspired by lofty
motives. On the other hand is Patton.
No word has been said against him. A
big man intellectually as physically, he
is one about whom friends gather in
multitudes, and to whom people nat
urally look to lead them. ." He is' a citi
zen of broad culture, of honorable at
tainment, upright, progressive. He
pulled no wires. The nomination came
to him against his protest, but having
been persuaded to accept it he is in the
fight to fight fast and fairly. He would
not become the nominee -ntil he knew
the character of the platform. He has
not made th.e error of seeking counsel
of degenerate boodlers. I notice that
every day he gains strength, and am
glad of it. I have much respect for the
present Mayor. He might be described
as a nice man. He is not of the caliber
to be the executive of a great city. It'
seems to me he has proved this.
Perhaps to discuss fashions is out of
my province, but here goes just the
same. I have noticed with pain that
certain expensively dressed women
have acquired this season the faculty
of making guys of themselves. In a
respectable way I had wondered why
they do it. My mind goes back to the
days of the monstrous and hideous Gre
cian bend. Then a stylish woman waa
a freak. She is tryine: to be again. I
saw a woman on Market street this
week who was so ridiculous a figure
that the cable cars ought to have shied
at her. Her waist was pinched until it
left no room for more than a badly
squeezed spine. The manner in which
she had shifted her internal mechanism
around was a marvel. Probably it had
been forced into her chest, for the bust
she carried loomei like the prow of a
bay scow. It was not such a bust as
God ever gave to mortal. It would,
have been regarded as an affliction, if
real. Yet the woman was proud of it.
although a similar hump on her back
would have been as winsome. Below
the waist her hips swelled after the
manner of a balloon. In fact, this
creature, who had good looks, had done
all in her power to destroy them. I
have asked several ladies of my ac
quaintance why he did this. The mat
ter is no puzzle to them. "Oh, because,"
they answer. I am glad to be enlight
ened.

â  DUBLIN, Sept. 17.--The assassination
â of the Empress of Austria, has caused
an -. : especially.'; !keen sense of ;â  indigna
tion and horror in Ireland, to which
she paid, in years gone by, three sep
arate and; somewhat prolonged visits.
She came here first in;lS79 for the pur
pose of hunting In the counties of
' Meath; Dublin arid Kildare, where some
. â Eome famous packs of hounds have al
ways been kept and which is the great
est.home-breeding district of the whole
country. On each occasion she stayed
at Summerhill House, in the county of
Meath, the residence of Lord Longford,
which she rented for the use of herself,
her numerous suite and a large stud of
horses, and where she made herself
thoroughly at home with people of all
ranks and classes, including the very
poorest, among- whom she distributed
her largesses with a lavish hand. There
were gay times then in MeathV: ."â : All .
the "smart" people living in or near.
Dublin, who were given in any degree
to hunting, went down regularly, by.'
rail very morning . of a ''meet!', to the â 
trysting spot, carrying with them in
the same train as many as; thirty: or
forty horses; but the most daring/rider
of them all was the Empress-Qtieeji :
who was always; dressed iii. a blue ri'l
lng habit, black hat and white water
proof, and who absolutely tired out ha
bitually all her a: :< -:;.iants. In : fact,,
her first hunt in Meath was on the day
after she had. arjived.-.at'.Summ.erhill,'
after a continuous:,; journey. from Co
logne via r Pfusseis, ) .Osterid/'.'JDove'ri
Hulyhead and the north wall of Dub

persons, \vhether. men or women, would

In which the Empress followed the |
"Kjldares," and through this gap thÂ«
stag made its way right into the
shrubbery, where it was brought to

being among the first. When the party

. ; sion to pray the Empress to. name for
' ; him a promising colt; and filly. She
- i consented and said in excellent. Eng
' i lish, for she was an accomplished lin
guist: "1 ;â¢ shall call the filly Valeric,"

â¢ was prophetic in this instance, for the
f colt turned out one of the best racers
t which even Linde ever turned out of
[ I his stables. ;. Her last act in leaving
. J was to order of a Dublin manufacturer
i a suit of vestments, embroidered in
'.â¢; shamrock on green and gold, for the
church of St. Stephanie, in Vienna, and
. she was most' particular in directing
the manner in which the order was to:
â be executed, so . that the vestments
, might bear internal, evidence of the
country of their origin. One of the
! places which . she visited : specially, it
may :be added, â  was the battlefield of
! the Boyne,:as to the fight on which arid
i its momentous . . consequences she
j seemed to know everything. .. : :' / :'â¢'â 'â .:â â 
; Some time ago I ventured to predict
that a Unionist or Tory Lord: Ma...
would not : : be elected for Dublin, while.
home rule was: denied. To-day Sir Rob-.
! crt Sexton, the Unionist candidate for
; the mayoralty lor next year, announces
his withdrawal : from the contest. '.He
! : does so; :. he says, .for the. purpose of
! promoting 'â¢; harmony among the : people
of Dublin; and no doubt the old gen
; tleman who :is ; a very . respectable \ arid
axniable. man â is sincere in his profes
sions. . .. But he had nothing else to do
- except to run : the risk of having no
ynibnist at .all returned to the Dublin
â Corporation. next January. â¢The. fact
is, Dublin, which has, politically speak
â¢ ing,' been.-rather asleep for some time;
; back, â¢ has been gradually getting into"
; ; :a; condition of unwonted .excitement
â ;. â over this matter., ft. has stirred the
Nationalist majority of the citizens al
most to the pitch of feeling w-hich pre
;â  vailed â  .in;.; the; days. after, the split . In â 
the â National ranks and Parneir.S; death,
which occurred soon afterward. > The
.finishing; blow to Sir. R. Sexton's; can
j didature was given on Tuesday last by i
Mr. John ; Redmond, M. ; P?, the leader
of the. Parrieillte. party, who, at a meet
ing of the : Independent League, de
;clared that such a thing could not, un
der present circumstances, be' tolerated.
This : declaration was promptly followed
, by a recommendation in one ..of" the
I Dublin Unionist journalsâ the Daily
Expressâ that ; Sir : R. Sexton, for the
| sake of the peace of the city, should
! retire. ' '.' It was doubtful whether:, the.,
'â  local supporters of the local :; Unionist ;
j leader would consent to his acting oh
this, advice..; â  But he has. done so, and '
, thus the prospect of a Unionist candi
dature for the mayoralty has been
! quickly and effectively killed. : The in
cident proves i two things conclusively
âfirst, the overwhelming sentiment of :
Nationalism which prevails among the j
masses in Dublin, and which, is not to j
be bought off by such â¢â  concessions as.
the local government act; and, second,
' the influence of the Parnellite leader
! and the Parnellite press in Dublin.
I What will .happen now is not quits
clear as yet. The feeling against the
Nationalist. : members of the corpora
tion who supported Sir R. Sexton's can
didature, and : whose support alone
made it possible. is so strong that I
i doubt if we shall soon see. an end of
the prevailing agitation in the city. A
proposal has been made to hold a mon
ster meeting in the Phoenix Park in.
connection with it, and it is more than
questionable whether it will be aban
doned, though the original cause for it
has been removed. The whole Incident
is a lesson to the Government' and Par
; liament which, probably, they will not
soon forget, -â . , . â¢ .â¢ '.'
A ghastly disco/very, which has sent.,
something of a shock through the
masses of the working people. of Dub-,
lin, was made the other day in the yard
of the Wellington Barracks', on the
southern side of the city. In 1883; when'
so many political executions .took, placti
here, a young workingrnan named Joe
Poole was hanged for the murder of a
man named Kenny in Seville Place. Ha
emphatically proclaimed . that .he was
innocent, and among the populace it
was universally believed that .he was
and that he was. hanged because he
was known to be an advanced Ration
alist. : He was buried "in the yard of
Richmond Prisonâ the .same' prison "in
which Daniel . O'Connell was confined
for some time in 1844. ' Some years ago
Richmond Prison was converted into
military barracks., Vyhich have, since â 
been known, as th&. Wellington Bar
racks; and, a few days ago, .in the
course of some reconstruction work in
the place, some workmen tore up the
ground of what" had been the prison
yard, and came" upon a slab bearing
the 1 'following., .inscription: ' "J. P.
Hanged 1883." â¢ Beneath the slab was
a' -coffin and inside the coffin were the
bones of a man who had evidently been
buried with his clothes arid, boots. . On
attempting to. remove the contents of
the coffin the bones ' and the. clothes
came asunder and were then placed in
charge of the police.- The. story, as re
counted in the papers,, aroused popular
feeling as I have mentioned, a good
deal and brought back to many minds
the 'terrible " days of â¢ 1882-83,- .and sug
gestions were at once. made that a pub
lic burial in Glasnevin should be- ac
corded to the remains, of Poole. Ap
plication, has been m^de to the author
ities by Poole's relatives for the trans
fer of- the remains to their custody;
but it has not yet been granted. If it
is. granted, a. public funeral will fol-.
low- which -will certainly not be to the
taste- of Dublin Castle. If It is not,
there -will 'probably .be -angry demon
strations'- It would be the wise.thing
on the part of the Dublin Castle folk
to yield to the popular, wish} but. then,

from Tower Hill,, after .their exciting
experiences .-in forcing back the Indiana
.negroes imported by the mine opera
tors to break. the : coal strikehere. . The
miners' guns were boxed' -up. and smug
gled into town in- wagons' filled .with
hay. : Large crowds congregated on the j
streets of Paha, but they Were orderly.
Not a negro appeared in the" city, and
the- quietness was only broken by the
cheers accorded the soldiers as they
marched through the streets. Last
night Sheriff Cpburn" requested the
military commander, Captain. Craig,
to go. to Tower Hill and arrest the
union miners who had captured the I
negroes and release the latter. Craig j
flatly refused to do so, saying he was j
only here to protect the lives of clti
zen-s and their property.
He was not here for the purpose of |
obeying the Sheriff's Instructions or or- }
ders, his orders being from Governor j
Tanner. The militia are patronizing
only the union butchers, bakers' and
merchants.
Owing to the heavy rain, which has
been incessant since the State troops !'
came here, the troops left the camp this j
afternoon and are now quartered in the
Haywood Opera House, where they will
remain during their stay.
Captain Craig has given" orders for
the closing of all saloons until further
notice. Lieutenant Hendy of Battery
B said to-day: "
"We will put on a provost guard of
fifty men this evening, which will be
continued indefinitely. I will have
charge of the guard. We will make a
searching investigation as to the loca
tion of the State's guns, which are said
to be in the hands of blacks, placed
there by the Sheriff, and we will take
them in charge." :

SHERIFF ON A NEW TRAIL
BELIEVES DECKHAND NELSON
IS INNOCENT.
Evidence Implicating the Present
Navigator of the Chispa and
the Keeper of Another
Bay Craft.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. I.â "For some
time I have doubted whether or not
Peter Nelson were guilty of the mur
der of Captain Brooks, and several
clews obtained in the last few days
have thoroughly convinced me that he
is entirely innocent of the crime."
This was the answer given by Sheriff
Harrison to-day when questioned as to
the progress made in the investigation
of the Chispa tragedy. Taken in con
nection with this declaration the fact
that for three days the county authori
ties have been pursuing a different line
of research shows clearly that sus
picion has fallen upon other parties,
and this despite the accumulating evi
dence encircling the deckhand. The
strangest part of it all is that this
opinion obtains in spite of the strong
circumstantial link furnished by Ed
win Atwater, the night watchman on
the ferry-boat San Rafael, who saw
Nelson picked up on the night of the
tragedy and yet is certain that no boat
left the Chispa.
If the authorities believe Nelson in
nocent of the crime his story of the as
sassination is given credence. Sheriff
Harrison frankly admits this to be j
true, and is even willing to name the*
persons suspected. They are "Ike"
Elk, the present navigator: of the j
Chispa, and "Nick" Burge, keeper of j
another- yacht at. Sausalito. If suffl- i
cient evidence can be obtained (and de
tectfyes are industriously followine vp â ;
clews on both: sides of the bay), both j
will be .placed, under arrest. j
What the officials have in reserve
cannot, be ascertained, and they abso-.
iutely refuse to give their hand away.
The: only known reasons why Elk and j
Burge rest under suspicion are the re- j
latioris they sustain toward each other,
the strained relations between Elk and !
the murdered man, the fact that Elk
wished the position of navigator of the
Chispa, the knowledge that Burge
wished to obtain it for an entirely dif- i
ferent reason,; the conflicting stories '
told by the two men and the peculiar ,
letter written to Commodore Gutte by i
Burge without the knowledge Of Elk
I himself; â ;:â¢'.â¢. -.'.'. '..-'â :â 'â ':' 'â  : ' â 
The officials assert that during the
time Elk worked for Captain Brooks
they had a bitter quarrel, which re
sulted in Elk breaking two of the cap
tain's ribs with a kick. In addition to
th> desire of Elk for Brooks' position
this is taken to show also that he. might
have been, actuated to commit the
crimeby personal animosity.
The tale about Burge being on Oak
land Creek has, according to Sheriff
Harrison, been proved to be false. The
letier written to Commodore Gutte Is
repriirded as. a most important bit of
evidence. It was written on Saturday
morning, so Burge claims, by Mrs. Elk
in San. Francisco. The postmark on the
letter shows that it was mailed in
Sausalito. Why a letter written in San.
Francisco should have been carried all
the way to Sausalito for mailing is
something that puzzles the investi
gators. It is. not. believed that. Burge
could have, known of the murder at
the time he did and had. Mrs. Elk write
the letter unless he had.' knowledge of
the murder before he claims he did.
I . It is' believed that In the evidence the
authorities' refuÃ.e to disclose, is a, letter
in Mrs. Elk's handwriting which will be
upc'd to show that the letter to' Comm
odore Gutte was written be,fore the mur
der, or that Mrs. Eik did not write it
at- all. ' â  : ' â  ' :
A lawyer â  namqd Steven B. Howard
came to San Rafael to-day and had a
conference with Nelson, in. the latter's
cell. At the conclusion Nelson request
ed to see the Sheriff and asked >vhen he
â¢ was to be released. He said he was
tired of being incarcerated without any
charge being preferred Against him,
and if not given his freedom he would
take legal steps to obtain it. It is
thought Nelson viill he- released soon,
as, in view of the change of opinion as
to who committed the murder, -and the
character of the evidence against him,'
there seems to be.no reason for holding
him In confinement longer. . â -. '

STOCKTON, Oct. I.â The Republi
cans of Stockton and San Joaquin
County pledged their allegiance to
Gage and Neff in a monster demonstra
tion to-night. The large number of for
mer Democrats and citizens of indepen
dent proclivities who joined in the rally
indicated that San Joaquin would place
the stamp of disapproval on Maguire
iÃm by an overwhelming majority in
November. It had been intended to
hold the meeting on Hunter square,
but the cool weather caused the com
mittee to change the place of the gath
ering to the Masonic Music Hall.
- This was the opening meeting of the
State campaign in this section. Bon
ilres and martial music drew out great
throngs, which were not slow in getting
into the commodious and comfortable
auditorium. A band and a delegation
.-â¢of Republicans escorted Colonel E. F.
Preston and Oregon Sanders to the
hall. Alex Chalmers acted as chairman
of the meeting, and introduced Colonel
Preston, after a lively song for Gage
and Xeff "by the Glee Club. .
Colonel Preston said: .
It is said that the results of elections
for State officer* do not affect ..national
issues. This is a grievous, error. 1 remind j
you that, the Congressmen whom- you- are
to elect at the coming, election will assist
in molding the destinies. of the nation at ;
this important epoch of our national his

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
; LOS ANGELES, Oct. 1,â Senator
Stephen M. White made his first-real
speech of the campaign : at the Wig
wam this evening: The occasion was a
general ratification, meeting of union
forces, of the county to indicate their
approval of the fusion .ticket. Senator
White had cot been announced as one
of the speakers or the crowd would
have been larger. As it was the Wig
wain was about half niled, only about
1000 people being present. ;
After various candidates had been
presented and made . brief speeches
Senator White was presented and made
one of his characteristic defenses of
Democracy and the fusion movement.
He indulged in no abuse of any candi
date on the Republican ticket and did
not mention one of them by name.
The Senator resented the change that
to elect Judge Maguire would result in
any laws being proposed which wcruld
in any way disturb property rifthts.
Speaking sarcastically, Senator White
said. 'â '.."" â  â¢â 
"Yet General Barnes speaks of revo
lution and sheds tears. The truth oi
the matter is that our friends are
afraid Judge : Maguire will win. and
that as a result they will lose the loaves
and fishes." â¢ â ' â  .
The Senator paid a high compliment
to Secretary of State Brown, but said
I there was one blot upon his official ca
reer and that was when .he gave the
i Shanahan Populists the nlace on the
i ballots which properly beloneed to the
fusion pulists. . . . â . -" - '
The speaker said the Republicans
were making a great cry about the
single tax. The real fact : was . that in
his judgment they were. in. favor of
double, triple or even quadruple tax as
long as that tax fell not upon. the. trusts
and corporations, but upon the great
I body Of â¢ the American people. : . . â : . â¢.
f : jii- closing he made a. plea along lines

of people called on him, shook his
hand and went away, evidently very
much pleased.
His speech was delivered in the
evening at the Barton Opera-house.
The audience was not so large as
usually attends a first-class attraction.
Maguire's speech lasted two and a half
hours, and the people showed signs of
fatigue some time before it came to an
end. The greater part of it was de
voted to the railroad issue,- and he
made the same arguments that have
been made elsewhere by him and which
long ago lost the charm of novelty.
He ajso paid some attention to Gen
eral Barnes' speech, attempting to an
swer it, but he did not make much of
a success of it. Upon the single tax
he touched but briefly, claiming that it
was not aji issue.
It cannot be denied that\his speech
wa;s disappointing. The people ex
pected a brilliant oration, and they
were treated to a. tedious tirade.
MaÂ£iiire was followed by Hutchi-

CRIMNAL LIBEL

with criminal libel. W. A. Beddoe, editor of the Juneau (Alaska)
Miner, has just arrived from the north and states that action has been
taken because of a published statement recently made by Ivey. In it
serious allegation's are made against Judge C. S. Johnson, District

and others, asserting that these men constituted a gigantic whisky
ring and were guilty of numerous frauds. Ivey is now en route from

COURTMARTIAL TRIAL OF
CHAPLAIN M'INTYRE
Witnesses Testify as to the Lan
guage Used at the Now
Celebrated Lecture.
DENVER, Colo., Oct. I.â At the resump
tion to-day of the court-martial trial of
Rev. Joseph P. Mclntyre, chaplain of the
battleship Oregon, Mr. Otto R. Reinhardt.
a merchant, was calledvby the defense.
He testified that Chaplain Mclntyre, in
his lecture on August 8, stated that tho
Oregon was one of the finest vessels In
the navy and that she was as honestly
built as any Eastern built vessel. Noth
ing was said about Eastern shipbuilder*
cheating the Government. tor. Keui
hardttestified that the chaplain said thut
; yhen the Oregon "tore toward the en
emy she passed the lowa going the other
way." Witness heard no statement to
the effect that Captain Evans took the
lowa to the rear and kept her there dur
ing the battle. Witness remembered
that the chaplain said that when the
Cristobal Colon hauled down her flag the
ships of the American fleet, aside from
the Oregon, were at some distance, and
that Captain Clark of the Oregon waited
for the New York to come within sig
naling distance so as to receive orders
. before going to the Spanish ship. The
chaplain, witness declared, did not say
that Admiral Sampson reported himself
within four miles so as to participate in
the distribution of prize money. Mr.
Reinhardt remembered that the chaplain,
Stated that Admiral Sampson would re
ceive $10,000, Captain Clark JSOO and him
self $75.
On cross-examination, witness testified
that Chaplain Mclntyre said substantial
ly to the audience in connection with the
distribution of prize money, "and you,
who had as much to do with the battlo
as the admiral, will not get a cent." Tha
chaplain called Captain Evans 'â¢Fighting
Bob," but not in a sneering and con
temptuous manner.
Peter Winne, an insurance agent, cor
roborated previous witnesses as to what
Chaplain Mclntyre had said.
At the conclusion of Mr. Winne's tes
timony the court adjourned till Monday.

Good Thing Goes Wrong
at Sacramento.
LAST DAY OF THE MEETING
BOOKMAKERS MAKE A BIG
CLEAN-TJP.
Roadwarmer Outfoots Trappean and
the Heavily Backed Dolore Fin
ishes Behind Two Other
Sprinters.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. I.â The closing
day of the California Jockey Club's
race meeting at Agricultural Park was
attended by only a fair crowd. A
paucity of horses prevented a higher
class card being offered race-eroers. But
two favoritesâ Tiburon and Miss Divi
dend â were successful. Roadwarmer, P
F and Ko Ko scampered past the
judges first, none of them neglected by
the aristocratic set.
The biggest plunge of the afternoon
and the most disastrous one on the
bettors was the play on Toribio, one
of a trio of starters in the six furlong
selling spin, second on the rogramme.
With Etta H scratched a contingent of
wise ones backed Toribio from 4 to 1
down to even money. The odds against
Zarro receded to 4. Ames, on P F,
having received a warning from the
stand, his mount won all the way,
reeling off the distance in 1:144.
Frawley, on Toribio, took the worst of
the break at the start, and was beaten
for the place.
The talent was down "good and thick"
on Trappean to win the opening scram
ble at five furlongs, but Roadwarmer
was sent away in the lead, and at the
j wire won somewhat easily from the
i favorite by a couple of lengths in l:02V 2 .
! Lady Ashley, at present several pounds
below her best form, was a fair third.
Barney Schreiber had speed, but bled
i from the nose.
Tiburon, which had in former races
shown to good advantage with inferior
riders on his back, had Thorpe up to
day, and was the whole thing in the
two-year-old dash at four and a half
furlongs. The younster's odds were
pounded down from 8 to 5 to even
money, and he was out in front all the
way. winning easily from Crossmolina.
The latter opened favorite, receding to
3 to 2. Correct took- the show from Rear
Admiral In a drive.
George Snyder, with the leg up on the
even money choice, Miss Dividend,
landed the fourth purse.' The distance
was six furlong?, and the filly was in
the lead the entire route, wi-nning all
out by less than two lengths. In a
driving finish Roulette Wheel was
downed three parts of a length for the
place by Saucy Eyes, the second choice.
The Pueblo stable's mare Dolore has
apparently not recovered from her se
vere Montana campaign.. She was in
stalled a 3 to 5 choice for the seven
furlong .selling run, last on the card,
but was in no demand, drifting back to
8 to 5. Phe Finished a fair third under
weak riding. Ockturuek, played down
to 3 to 5 from 6 to 5, looked a winner up
to within a few yards of the 1 wire,
where Thorpe, on Ko Ko, collared him
and yon by- two lengths.- .

OLYMPIC LIGHTWEIGHTS
DEFEAT THE FRESHMEN
STANFORD, Oct. I.â To-day the fresh
men lined up before the Olympic light
weights, and went down before them to
a score of 11 to 0. The lightweights played
a quick snappy game throughout.
On the very kiekoff the bali was re
turned by the Olympics, and Keller, their
quarter, scooping it on a fluke, carried
it through for a touchdown. Later Mc-
Neven repeated the act. Then the fresh
men began to hold and gain ground. They
fought nard for a goal, but were uha.blo
to score.
' With two minutes to play the ball lay
on the Olympic's three-yard line . and it
seemed at last the "babies" were to have
their wa>\ "
Then came a play that brought th.j
gTand stand down on to the gridiron and
in many games would have caused a fr.ee
fight. On the third down with nothing but
scoring to save them the freshmen
reached the goal line. Immediately' th<*
Olympics claimed the ball on dpwnÃ, while
the' others held that the ball was over
for a touch down. After a hot discussion
the ball was given to the Olympics, and
they held it till the whistle blew.
The line-up was as follows: . . â

JEALOUS OF HIS SUCCESS
TWO OF THEM SUSPENDED FOB,

Sympathies of the British Sporting
Men All on the Side of the
Premier Jockey From the
""nited States.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Oct. I.â The talk of the
sporting world is the incident of Thurs
day, when, at Newmarket, two English
rivals of Tod Sloan, "Sammy" Loates
and "Nat" Robinson, tried to hustle the
American jockey out of the running in
the welter handicap. Mttadorla finished
first in that race, which was for 100
sovereigns at seven furlongs, being a
neck ahead of Kirschwasser, ridden by
Sloan. But an objection was lodged
against Mandorla for boring. This was
sustained and the race was awarded to
the horse ridden by the American
Jockey. 4
There is no doubt that bitter jeal
ousy has been aroused by Sloan among
the English jockeys, who are aghast
at his phenomenal series of wins. He
started on Thursday with eight wins
out of sixteen mounts to his credit, and
he finished the day with eleven wins
out of twenty mounts as his record.
There is no exaggeration in Baying
that this caused a genuine tompest of
surprise and admiration in sporting
circles. The mere fact that Sloan rides
a horse, however mediocre the animal
may be, gives it short odds in the bet
ting.
In the selling plate yesterday Sloan
set the pace from the beginning, and
though Eau Gallic seemed an easy win
ner, he beat The Wake, ridden by the
American jockey, only a head. The
fates seemed against Sloan in the Eous
Memorial stakes yesterday. Landrail
bolted and got away badly and it look
ed like a sure win for Quassiel. ridden
by Canlon in a confident manner, but
the American jockey on Landrail man
aged to accomplish another sensational
finish and won the race. . â 
The attempt to oust Sloan on Thurs
day was made when he was descending
the bushes hill. Robinson, who was rid
ing the favorite, Loggan Hall, can
toned on KirschwaSser. Sloan- kept his
seat, but Kirschwasser lost his balance
and was passed by Mandorla, ridden by
Loates, who immediately after, on the
run home swerved to the right, taking
Kirschwasser, who was close behind,
the result being that Kirschwasser lost
by a neck. But Sloan waÃ not yet
beaten, arid his first words on returning
to the weighing room were:
"Say, where's the. objection room?"
The upshot of the. matter was that
Loates. and . Ribi'nson were summoned
before the stewards of the Jockey Club,
who disqualified ..Mandorla and sus
pended Loates. from riding until the
Hqughton meeting and cautioned Rpb
lnson. .â "â â â¢'....â â  â¢".â 'â â¢
The sympathies- of the British sport
ing-men are all on the side of Tod
Sloan and the English newspapers
warmly applaud the prompt action of
the Jockey 'Club. One paper says:
"We invite foreigners to enter their
horses in English, races, wei welcome
t'heni on pur. different courses, and the
same generous hand should, be extended
to the jockeys; 'no. -matter whence they
come. It is gratifying: t6; see that the
stewards will not wince at shady con
duct upon the part : of even a fashion
able jockey like Loates.. It would be
far better for some' of our riders to
imitate to a certain. extent Sloan's style
than to attempt by unfair means to
jockey him out of a win." ;. :
The "suggestion that the English jock
eys imitate Sloan's riding has already
been anticipated by a leading English
jockey. Madden who won the Triennial,
stakes on Thursday in Sloan's style,
with the saddle placed well forward
and finishing on his horse's neck. The
successful North -County jockey, Wel
don, is also adopting the American's
style of riding.
An important meeting of the Jockey
Club this week considered the question
of short distance races, the increasing
number of which, it was contended, was
causing degeneration of the stamina of
thoroughbreds and converting the horse
into a mere instrument for gaming..
The Jockey Club decided that half the
total amount of the added money at
every meeting shall be apportioned for
races of a mile or over for three-year
old and upward and that half of this
money shall be devoted to races of over
a mile and a half. It was also agreed
that prior to June 1 of each year there
shall be no two-year-old race oÂ£ great
er value than 200 sovereigns.

vorites; he is kind to those who are
kind to themselves. The younger look-
ing woman will tell you she does not
know how it is that she keeps her
.youth and fairness, she uses no cos-
metic, no powder, no paint. The woman
who looks so much older will say, "I'm
obliged to use paint and powder, I have
to coyer up my yellow skin and hide
thSe wrinkles." If you probe a little
deeper into the secrets of these women
you. will find that the youthful one has
learned that the best cosmetic is
health, arid that there can be no gen-
erai health for the body which is hour-
ly undermined by the local ill-health
of the delicate female organs. Know-
Ing this she has taken prompt means
to cure the disagreeable drains, the
bearing-down pains and the inflamma-
tions and ulcerations which to a greater
or less extent affect most women -who
experience the tremendous change
which by marriage and motherhood is
wrought on the distinctively feminine
organs.
The older appearing woman will tell
you the common story of constant and
useless doctoring for backache, for fe-
male weakness, for debilitating drains.
Inflammation like a fire burns up her
strength. Ulceration like a leech saps
her vitality. Nature cannot make a
bright eye and a pure complexion with-
out rich, pure blood. This woman's
blood flows sluggishly along the canals
of the body, like some oozy, slimy cur-
rent, whose motion barely keeps it from
utter stagnation.
leauty is every woman's birthright.
A healthy woman is always beautiful.
This secret of health and beauty for
every woman lies in the recognition of
the plain truth that where there are
local diseases of the organs distinctively
feminine, there can be no health and
beauty white these debilitating, life-
sapping ailments continue.
"But," comes the natural question,
''can these diseases be cured?" It is
no wonder women ask the question in
view of the failures of ordinary practi-
tioners. Hundreds of thousands of such
cases have in the past thirty years been
referred to Dr. R. V. Pierce, chief con-
sulting physician to the Invalids' Hotel
and Surgical Institute, Buffalo, N. Y.,
and although the majority are chronic
cases aggravated by injudicious and
ignorant treatment, yet the gpeat re-
cord stands that of thousands of such
' suffering women ninety-eight out of
I every hundred have been entirely
cured. The two in every hundred,
whose cases could not be cured, have
received alleviation and help which
made them lastingly grateful. These
cures have in the main been effected
I by the use of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Pre-
scription. This great medicine is the
specific of a specialist who has given
over thirty years of his life to the
study and cure of female diseases. Its
effect upon the delicate female organs
is most marked. It puts out the fire
of inflammation as heaven's rain
quenches the fearful forest fire. It
heals ulcerations as gently and as sure-
ly. as., time heals the wounded spirit-
healing every day and all day and
every night and all night. It dries up
disagreeable drains. It imparts vital-
ity and elasticity to the organs of
motherhood, so that baby enters the
World easily, and gently <is the sun-
beam he resembles. It establishes the
general health, and restores to woman
her birthright; the lithesome, form, the
laughing face, the loving heart, the
lustrous eye of healthy, happy woman-
hood. ' â¢â '.'â  â  ' â  :.
I VI feel }t a duty to Inform, you that
I had been a : sufferer far many years
from nervousness with, all its symp-
torns and complications." writes Mrs.
â O. N.- Fisher. . 1S61 Lexington avenue.
New York, N. Y.- "I was constantly
going to see a .physician or purchasing
medicine .for this .or that complaint as
rny troubles became unbearable. In . .
the Hpring'of 1897 my husband induced
me to try Dr. Pierce's Favorite Pre-
scription. After takincr onebottle and
following -your. advice I was so encour--
aged that I took five more .bottles of
'Favorite Prescription' ami then I did
not take any more for several weeks,
as- 1. felt so much better, but still I-
was. not . completely cured! I : com-
menced taking .it again and felt that I
was improving faster than at first,
am; not now cross ana irritable, and" I
have a -good color in my face: have
also gained about ten pounda In weight
and one thousand pounds of .comfort,
for I am a new woman once more and
your advice and- your 'Favorite Pre-
scription' are the causes of it. coupled
-with your 'Pleasant Pellets." Which are
not to be dispensed with. I took eight
bottles' of the 'Prescription' the last
time, making fourteen in all, and will
not take any more unless you so ad-
vise, for I do not see as I need it. I
have often told my friends how I was
cured, and have been no little sur-
prised to learn how many of theni have
also used Dr. Pierce's Favorite Pre-
scription with great benefit. I havo
induced several to try it â  and have
heard that they were much pleased
with tho results."
The record of such cures is unlm-
p achable, as is the fact that they have
been enjoyed by ninety-eight, per cent
of the women who have tried Dr.
Pierce's Favorite Prescription. Any
sick or ailing woman can consult Dr.
Pierce by letter without charge. By
this method there Is no subjecting of

the patient to the embarrassing ques-
tions, offensive examinations, and ob-
n ixious local treatments which frighten
so manj' modest women away from the
door of help. You can write freely,
frankly, fully, keeping nothing in re-
serve, because your letter Avill be read
in private and all its confidences will
be held sacred. You can write without
fee as without fear.
There is no alcohol, whisky or other
stimulant in Dr. Pierces Favorite Pre-
scription. It is equally free from opium
and all narcotic drugs and preserves its
virtues in any climate without the aid
of syrup or sugar.
The cure of Mrs. Fisher was accom-
plished by the use of Dr. Pierces Fa-
vorite Prescription. Her cure is but thÂ©
type of hundreds of thousands. If you
want a like cure you'll find it in "Fa-
vorite Prescription" only and not in a
substitute. If you want a cure you
don't want a substitute. You should
I make any substituting dealer see that
as you see it.
\ keen observer of human nature re-
cently said: "I mistrust the druggist
who endeavors to dissuade me from
buying the medicine I had in mind on
entering his store. My fear is that he
may change my doctor's prescription to
make it better suit his convenience and
se..:sh interests." The moral is, patron-
ize the dealer who respects your judg-
ment and gives you exactly what you
call for. â 
Those who use Dr. Pierce's Pleasant
Pellets find them superior to all other
pills in their action upon the stomach,
liver and bowels. They should always
be taken, when indicated, with the "Fa-
vorite Prescription" as they harmonize
with it and promote its operation.

t>r. Redwell relafes an Interesting ac-
count of what he considers a remarkable
cure of acute stomach trouble arid chronic
dyspepsia by the Use of the new discov-
ery, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
He- says: The patient was a man- who
had suffered to my knowledge for years
â with dyspepsia. Everything he ate
seemed to sour and create acid and gases
in the stomach: he had pains hkc- rheu-
matism in the back, shoulder blades and
limbs, fullness and distress after eating,
poor appetite and loss of flesh; the heart
became affected, causing palpitation and
. sleeplessness at night.
.1 gave him powerful nerve tonics ami
blood remedies, but to no purpose. As an
experiment I finally bought a fifty-tent
package of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets at
a drug store and gave them to him. Al-
-most immediate relief was given and after
he had used four boxes he was to all ap-
pearances fully cured.
There was no more acidity or sour wat-
ery risings, no bloating after meals, the
appetite was vigorous and he has gained
between 10 and 12 pounds in weight of
solid-, healthy flesh.
Although Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
are advertised and sold In drug stores, yet
I consider them a most valuable addition
to any physician's line of remedies, as
they are perfectly harmless and can be
given to children or invalids or in any
condition of the stomach with perfect
safety, being harmless and containing
nothing but vegetable and fruit essences,
pure pepsin and Golden Seal.
Without any question they are the saf-
est, most effective cure for Indigestion,
biliousness, constipation and all derange-
ments of the stomach, however slight or
severe.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are made by
the Stuart Co. of Marshall. Mich., and
6old by druggists everywhere at fifty
cents per package.

Bravery of American
Troops at Manila.
TOLD BY TWO GENERALS
ANDERSON AND MACABTEUB
MAKE REPORTS.
During the Fighting Before the Phil
ippine Capital There Were
Many Acts of Individual
Heroism.
SpÂ«rlal Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. I.â The reports
of General Thomas M. Anderson, com
manding the Second Division of the
Eighth Army Corps, and General Mac-
Arthur, commanding the First Brigade
of that division, as to operations about
Manila were made public at the War
Department to-day. General Anderson
had command of the first expedition.
The following extracts are taken from
his report:
On the ftrst day of July I had an in
terview with the insurgent chief, Agui
naldo and learned from him that the.
Spanish forces had withdrawn, driven
back by his army, as he. claimed, to the
line of" defense immediately around the
city and its suburbs. H* estimated the
Spanish forces at about H .'XW men,, and
his own at about the -vr n. number. He
did not seemed pleased at the. incoming of
our land troops-, hoping, -a,s 1 belie. ye, that
he could take the city with his own army,
with the co-operation of the American
fleet: :â¢" â¢ . ' . â¢ _â¢ _
Believing that, however successful, the
insurgents may hove been in guerril'n
warfare against the Spanish, they could
not carry their Lines by assault or .reduce
the city'by siege, and expecting, further,
that a hearty and effective co-operation
could not be executed. 1 at once had
made a number of reconnolssances to ex
actly locate the enemy's lines of defense
and to ascertain Its strength.
General Anderson thus describes the
attack on: Manila, which was .under his
â¢ immediate command, subject to orders
from General Merritt, whose headquar
ters were on a dispatch-boat:
The fleet opened fire at 9:30 a. m. The
first show fell short, but the range was
soon found, and then the fire became evi
dentlj effective. ] at once telegraphed
General Mac Arthur to open on blockhouse
No. 14, and begin his attack. At the same
time several of the guns of the Utah
Battery opened fire on the enemy's works
in front of the Second Brigade and two
guns on the right of this brigade opened
ah oblique fire toward blockhouse No. 14.
Riding down to the beach I saw two
of our lighter draft vessels approach and
open on the Polverin with rapid-fire guns,
and observed, at the same time, some men
of The Second Brigade start up the beach.
I ordered the First California, which was
the leading regiment of the service, to go
forward and report to General Greene.
Going to the reserve telegraph T received
a message from Mac Arthur that his tire
on the blockhouse was effective, but that
he was enfiladed from the right. 1 knew
from this that he wished to push the in
surgents aside and put in the Astor Bat
tery. 1 then authorized him to attack,
which he did, and soon after the Twenty
third Infantry and the Thirteenth Minne
sota carried the advance line of the ene
my In a most gallant manner, one
gun of the Utah Battery lending most
effective assistance.
In the meantime the Colorado regiment
had charged and carried the right of the
enemy's line, and the Eighteenth Infan
try and the Third Heavy ' (regular) Ar
tillery, acting as infantry, had advanced
and passed over the enemy's works in.
their front without opposition. The re
serve was ordered forward to follow the
Second Brigade, and a battery of Hotch
kiss guns was directed to follow the'
Eighteenth Infantry. Going to the tele
graph station on the left of our line on
the beach, 1 found the operator starting
â forward in the rear of the First Cali
fornia and I moved forward until the in
strument was" established in the first
house in Malate. The first ticking of
the sounder Informed us that General
Mac Arthur was heavily engaged at a sec
ond line of defense near Singalong.
It was evident that the best way to as
sist him was to press our success on the
left. 1 therefore directed General Grc-ene
to connect, if possible, with General Mac-
Arthur by sending a regiment to the
right. But the army seemed determined
for a time to give us a street fight, and
the Colorado and California regiments
were the only ones available. At this
juncture the Eighteenth Infantry and the
Hotchkiss battery appeared to be stopped
by a broken pier of. a bridge, but the
engineer company brought forward a
portable bridge and in a few minutes
these organizations pressed through for
the Malato Ermlta redoubts. Soon the
men from Nebraska and Wyoming came
â¢on shouting, for the white flag could be
seen on the sea front, yet the. firing did
not cease, and the Spanish soldiers at the
front did not seem to be notified of the
surrender.. In the meantime the reserve
had been ordered forward, except one
regiment, which was ordered to remarh
in the Second Brigade trenches.- The Sev
enth Utah were also ordered to the front
one infantry battalion being directed to
assist the men of the batteries in hauling
the guns by hand.
The field telegraph wires, extending in
a wide circuit to the extreme right, for a
time gave discouraging reports. The
front was covered and the enemy In
trenched, and the timber heavy on both
Bides of the road. Only two regiments
It is believed, were put on the firing line
The Fourteenth Infantry was brought
forward, but could pot fire a shot. Under

the Rev. Plus Murphy, the provincial of
the Dominican order on this coast.
As a glorious accompaniment to the
new organ the total strength of the pres
these circumstances I telegraphed Mac
Arthur to countermarch and CQrae to Ma
late by way of Greene's intrenehments
anil the beach. This was at 1:25 p. m.,
but soon after I learned that Mac Arthur
was too far committed to retire. The
guns of tlie Astor Battery hart been
dragged to the front only after the ut
most exertions, arid wi>r^ about l>Â»'ing.put
into battery. At the Banue time 1 receiv
ed a telegram .stating that the insurgents
were threatening to cross the bamboo
bridge on our right: and, U> pjreVept this
and guard our. ammunition at Pasay, 1
ordered an Idaho battalion to the point.
It was evidently injudicious, under these
circumstances, to . withdraw the first
brigade, so the order was countermanded
and a dispatch sent announcing, our suc
cess oTi the left. â ' ' " â¢ .
In answer the report came that Sing
' along had been carried and that the
brigade was advancing on Paco. At this
point it was subsequently met by one of
my aids and marched down to the Cuar
tel de Malate by the Calzado de Paco.
1 had gone in the meantime to the south
bridge of the walled city, and, learning
that the Second Oregon was within the
walls and that Colonel Whittter was In
conference' with the Spanish command
ant, I directed General dreene to proceed
at once with his brigade to the north
side of the Pasig, retaining only the
"Wyoming battalion to rerrr-iin with me to
keep up the connection between the two
brigades.
A remarkable incident of the day
was the experience of Captain Stephen
O'Connor of the Twenty-third Infan
try. With a. detachment of fifteen skir
mishers he separated from his regiment
and brigade at blockhouse No. 14, arid,
striking a road, probably in the rear of
the enemy, marched into the city without
opposition until he came to the Calif-
Real in Malate. Along this street he na<t
some unimportant street fighting until he
came to the Paseo de la Calzada, where,
learning that negotiations were going on
for a surrender, hv took post at the
bridge of the north saHy-port. and the.
whole outlying. Spanish force south uf thp
Pasig passed by this small detachment
hurrying in. intramuros.. Captain O'Con
nor deserves recognition for the coolness,
and bravery displayed In this remarkable
adventure. â¢ â¢â  ' . â 
Our loss in the First Brigade was three
officers wounded, four enlisted men
killed and thirty-five wounded. The loss
in the Second Brigade was one enlisted
man killed and live wounded, making a
total of five killed : and forty-three
wounded: â¢ ' ' . ' â¢
Tne antecedent, loss in the trenches was
fourteen killed and sixty wounded, mak
ing a total' of VZ2 casualties in the taking
of Manila. This is only part of the price
we have paid' and are paying for thi.s
success, for men. are dying daily, in our
hospitals .from., disease .contracted from
exno-sure iri. camp and trenches.
. All hardships and privations have been,
borne by .our soldiers with remarkable
patience and; cheerfulness. . The opposi
tion we met in battle was not sufficient
to' test the bravery of our soldi, rs, but
all showed bravery and dash. The losses
show that the leading regiments of the
First Brigadeâ Thirteenth Minnesota,
Twenty-third Infantry and the Astor lot
teryâmet the most serious opposition,
and deserve credit for their success. The
Colorado, California and Oregon regi
ments, the regulars and the batteries of
the Second Brigade showed such zeal that
it seems a pity that they did not meet
men worthy of their steel.
My staff officers were active, zealous
and intelligent in the performance of their
duties, and the men and officers of the
entire division show-ed the best qualities
of American soldiers.

more into detail concerning the opera
tions of his brigade, and commends the
bravery of a number of officers and
organizations, mentioning Colonel

FEARFUL ABUSES
AT CAMP WIKOFF
Specifications Submit
ted to Investigators.
CHARGES OF THF WORLD
ARRAY OF FACTS THE COMMIS
SION WILL CONSIDER.
According to the Information Sub
mitted Sick Soldiers Were
Neglected in a Crimi
nal Manner.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. I.â The War
Investigation Commission devoted its
time to-day largely to the statement
flied by Nelson Hersch, on behalf of the
New "i'ork World, giving what he styles
a "record of facts concerning the es
tablishment of Camp Wikoff and man
agement, together with specific de
scriptions of abuses charged to have
existed, dates, number of sick in hos-
pitals, deaths, etc."
This statement was made in response
I to the general invitation from the com
mission. The specifications cover
twenty-one pages of typewritten mat
ter, taking up the movement of the
Santiago troops after the surrender of
j the Spanish; at that place and before
: the breaking but of yellow fever there
|in July. It is asserted that at the time
Montauk Point was selected as the site
j for the camp.it was "a barren, waste."
! The details of the selection, of the camp
! site are given, as are also those of the
transportation of troops, and it is as
serted when the lirst detachment of 275
troops arrived on the Sth of August,
"the camp was not ready to receive
them, and that they slept under their
blankets, and in the open air, as no
tents had arrived."
'"This," it is added, "was eleven days
after it had been decided to establish
the camp."
Continuing, the assertion is made that
by the 10th of August the sick were re
ported suffering from want of proper
accommodations and food; that their
tents were without floors, and with only
their blankets between the sick men
and the ground; and that a glass of
sour milk apiece was the only nourish
ment they received in twenty-four
hoars.
The War Department is charged with
frequent changes of plans, and it is as
serted that General Young was given
only six days for the preparation of the
camp before the arrival of troops, when
two weeks' time was necessary, which
caused "great confusion." On the 14th
of August Dr. Edson visited the camp
and found that the 1400 troops there
were almost wholly dependent upon a
body of water without inlet or outlet
and known as Fort Pond for their
drinking water. This pond received the
drainage from the camp, and the doctor
found the water to contain 90 grains of
salt to the gallon. This- condition, he
said, caused disease and- rendered the
pond a constant menace to the men.
By August 20th there were 20,000 men
In camp and 1300. in the hospital, with
many unable to secure admission from
the transports. The- regulars were re
ported to be suffering for the neces
saries of Ijfe and had received no pay
for three months. Contract surgeons
were reported living at the expense of
patients.
"After the doctors had lunched," says
the account, "twenty-five empty apol
linaris bottles were ccunted on the
table, said to have been diverted from
hospital stores."
Particulars are given of the death in
his tent of Private Hugh Parrett on
August 28, and it is asserted that Dr.
Tabor refused him permission to enter
the hospital, on the ground that he was
not sick.
â  The assertion is made when, on the
sth of September, Dr. Lee went to
Camp Wikoff with a special train to
take sick soldiers to Brooklyn hospi
tals, he as unable to get more than
fifteen men to the train on account of
the la.ck of ambulances, which were
being used to carry sightseers around
the camp. While hundreds of sick sol
diers were waiting to be transferred to
boats and trains- .a dozen ambulances
stood at the depot filled with laughing
men and women who were seeing the
camp with officers' friends.
After this .incident General Young
gave orders that the ambulances were
to be used only for. the transportation
of the sick.
A list of witnesses is as follows: Gen
eral Joseph Wheeler, General" Young,
Colonel Forwood, Major Brown-, Sur
geon Senn from the Red Cross, Miss
Helen Gould, Mrs. Walworth, Dr. Cy

The meeting of the Harbor Commis

by the presence of T: Alexander Wright,
the expert who acted for. the Grand Jury
in the disclosures regarding the frauds

gineer, which are at variance: with that
of Mr. Wright, were explained to him.

o/ tRED CROSS WORK
WILL CONTINUE
THE LOCAL SOCIETY PERMA
NENTLY ORGANIZED.
Officers Elected at the Annual Meet
ing Held Yesterday at Sorosis
Clvb â Finances in Good
Condition.
>t its annual meeting, held yesterday
afternoon at Sorosis Club, 1620 California
street, the Red Cross Society of San
Francisco effected permanent organization
and elected officers for the ensuing year.
Though the original Idea was to minis
ter solely to. the needs of war, the ex
perience of five months of active work
has pointed out that the piping times of
peuee have also their necessities and that
the future work of he society is to be
done in no half-hearted way is assured
in the selection of officers. Those who
are chosen to administer the affairs of tae
society through the coaling year are:
President. Mrs. John F. Merrill; ilrst
vice-president. Miss Heaver; second vice
president, Mrs.' S. O. Sanborn; third vice
president, Mrs. Henry Gibbons Jr.; fourth
vice-president", Mrs. l. Lowenberg; record
ing secretary, Mrs. W. H. Eckart: cor
responding secretary, Mrs. Josephine de
Greayer; treasurer, Mips Anne Bryce; as
sistant treasurer. \V. B. Harrington.
The report of Assistant Treasure Wil
liam K. Harrington showed that the so
ciety is at present in splendid financial
condition, Since April 28. $62,522 37 has
rolled into the society's coffers from dif
ferent sources and $43,364 M has been ex
pended along the lines laid down, leaving
a cash balance lÂ« the treasury of $19,157 S3.
With an unlimited supply of California
dollars and workers to draw from there
seems little .doubt that the society will
maintain its present linancial and moral
ability for good through the year to come.
Tuesday afternoon David Starr Jordan
will lecture before the society at Metro
politan Temple. â  He will take for his
theme the injunction, "Search for Un
happiness," and it is probable that the
attendance from among the members of
the society will be large.

MUST PAY ITS WAR TAX.
Judge Barry Decides Against Wells, Fargo &
Company.
JUSTICE OF THE PEACE J. E. BARRY.
THE Wells-Pargo Express Company must pay its war tax and no
longer pursue it's unpatriotic course of shifting it on to the shoul
ders of its patrons. Justice of the Peace Barry rendered a decision
on the point yesterday, giving judgment in favor of William E.
Costley against the company for $5 damages, Incurred by reason of
the refusal of Wells-FargQ to" carry a parcel of books frym San
Francisco to Sacramento for an ordinary rate without an additional
penny for a war stamp.
The decision of Judge Barry is ably written and clearly brings out the
culpability of the express company hi unmistakable language.
It is in full as follows: .
In the Justices' Court of ihe City arid County of Ban Francisco, State of
California.
William E. Costley, plaintiff, vs. : Wells, Fargo & Co., a corporation, de
fendant. Opinion. ;
This is an action by William E. Costley against Wells. Fargo & Co., com
mon carriers, engaged in the business of '.carrying freight, goods and mer
chandise to and fram different parts -of the State of California, both at- marine
and inland carrier of goods. The action is for damages under section 1216J of
the Civil Code, which provides as follows:
"Sec. 2169. A common carrier must, it able to do so, accept and carry
whatever is offered to. him at a reasonable time and place, of a kind that he
undertakes or is accustomed to carry." . ' .
The plaintiff offered and tendert-d to defendant a package of books,
for which the charge of said defendant was ordinarily forty cents for the
transportation thereof from the said city ard county of San Francisco to
the city of Sacramento, to. which place th<- book? were destined. It is ad
mitted that the books- were offered, ut a reasonable time and place and thajt
they were of a kind that the defendant held itself out to carry, and was ac
customed to carry. â¢ â¢
The only question involved, outside of the question of damages, is as to
the construction of that paragraph of Schedule A of the war revenue law
of the United States of IS9S, entitled "An act to provide ways and means
to meet war expenditures and far other purposes," approved June 13, 1898,
which reuds as follows: . .'â¢ â  " â¢.
"Express and freight: It shall .be the duty of every, railroad or steamboat
company, carrier, express company, or corporation or "person, whose occupa
tion i 8; to act aa such, to issue to' the shipper or consignor, or his agent, or
person, from whom any goods are accepted for transportation, a bill of lad
ing, manifest, or other evidence of receipt and forwarding for each shipment
received for carriage and- transportation, whether in bulk or in boxes, bales,
packages, bundles, or not so inclosed or included; and there shall be duly
attached and canceled, as is in this act' provid-ed. to each of said bills of
-lading, â  manifest, or other â  memorandum- and to each duplicate thereof, a
Stamp Qf .the value of on.c cent.
"ProK-ided,That but one- bill of lading shall be required on bundles or pack
ages of newspapt-rs when in-Closed in one general- bundle at the time of ship
ment. Any failure to'issue such bill of lading, manifest, or' other memoran
dum, as herein provided, shall subject such railroad or steamboat company
carrier, express company, .of -corporation or person- to a penalty of fifty dol
lars for each offense, and no such bill of lading, manifest, or other memo
randum shall be uaed/.in evidence unless ft shall be duly stamped as afore
said."- ... â¢ . .
The question. specifically is. Must the carrier or the person who offers the
goods for carriage pay the. cost of the stamp? It Is contended by the carrier
: there should.' be duly attached to the evidence of receipt a Ignited States
Tevenue stamp of the-, value of one cent. That under the provision of the act
Just quoted, it was the duty of the plaintiff to pay for said revenue stamp
as a condition precedent to- the receipt of said package by the defendant in
order that the defendant might com'ly with the law, by giving a receipt
having attached thereto and canceled (he stamp required by the act.
It is to be noted in the beginning that this Is an action under a State
statute and not under any provision of the revenue law before quoted A
receipt given by an express company Is in all essential particulars the
same as a bill or lading. Section 21.10 of the Civil Code provides: "A carrier
must subscribe, and deliver to the . consignor, on demand, any reasonable
number of bills of lading of the same tenor, expressing truly the original
contract for carriage,- and if he refuses to do so, the consignor may take the
freight from him and recover from him, besides all damages thereby oc
casioned.'-'
The action, however, is not for damages for failing to subscribe and de
liver to the consignor such a receipt under the State statute, but for damages
for failure to take and carry the freight.' It is evident that under section
21G9, C. C, above cited, the common carrier must accept and carry the goods.
Under section 2130. C. C, it is evident that it must "subscribe ami deliver,"
.or. in other words, "issue," a receipt. This is the law independently of any
act of Congress.
But the provision of the 'revenue act under discussion says that It Is the
â duty of such express company to "issue to the shipper or consignor, or his
agent, or person from whom any goods are accepted for transportation, a
bill of lading, manifest, or other evidence of receipt." It is evident, there
fore, that as the express company must accept the goods, it Is its duty
equally under this statute to issue, the receipt. The receipt, It may be ar
gued, might be a valjd receipt in the State courts, even if It were not so in
the Federal courts, as evidence of the transaction. Some authorities deny
the power of Congress' to prescribe to State courts a rule of evidence regu
lating the admtsnoility of unstampo-d documents. (See Bumpas v. Barker
26 Ark. ?,%: 1 Am. Rep. G23; Pargouf V. Richardson, 30 La. Ann. 1256; Moore v
Moore, 47 N. Y. 467; 7 Am. Rep. 466;. Spore v. Elfier, 1 Heisk., Term., C -
3 v. Farmers' Bank. 31 Gratt., Va 348).
The same view is Intimated in Carpenter v. Snelllnfr. 97 Mass. 452.
On the. other hand there are decisions upholding the power of Congress
in this respect. The leading case is Chartlers v. Cnartiers, etc.; Turnpike
Company v. McNamara. 72 Pa. St. 278. 39 Am. Rep. 673.
That the provisions of the act of 1562 rendering .unstamped Instruments in
admissible "in evidence were not intended to apply to the State courts Is
maintained in a- large number. of otiier cases. For Instance: Duffy v. Hob
son, 40 Cal. 240'; McElvane V Mudd. 44 Ala. 4S; Griffin v. Granney". 35 Conn.
239; Forcheimer v. Holly, 14 Fla. 239; and many other rases might be cited to
the same effect. And in the rase of Duffy V. Hobson 40 Cal. 2-10. It was held:
Wallace. Judge*, delivering' the opinion of the court, that Congress has no
constitutional authority to legislate concerning the rules of evidence admin
istered in th.c. courts, of the- State, nor to affix conditions or limitations upon
which-those rul'rp are to be' applied and enforced; and that the act of Con-
BTess "to provide internal revenue passed June SO. 1564, which, provided that
certain instruments, unstamped in the manner therein required, shall not be
'/recorded or admitted -or used as. evidence in. any court," etc.. embraces only
proceedings had and acts done in public office's and courts established under
the constitution of the United States, and by authority of acts of Congress
framed in pursuance thereof: -but I deem it unnecessary to this decision to
determine whether or not' this question 1b of any importance here.
It Is .contended In the first part of defendant's argument that the purpose
of the law is to tax the consumer, and in the latter part It is argued that
the Government Is- concerned only with Its revenue, and that it cares not â 
Which- of the parties pays the tax. It appears to me,- however, from the
language of the statute that It was clearly thr intent- that the person who
"issues the receipt should pay the- tax. The contention of the express com
pany that.lt would have a right to raise Its rates so as to Include the cost of
the stamp -Is of no moment here,' for several reason*: First, because even if
we admit that the srntute does riot expressly provide that the carrier shall
pay for, affix a.nd cancel the stamp, "yet the "carrier must "Issup" a receipt,
having- attached thereto such stamp, and it is a matter of indifference from
what source he obtains that ptamu; and. secondly., it is admitted and It is
conclusive, so far ns this action is concerned, that the charge of 40 cents
demanded by the carrier was tendered by the plaintiff, and it Is conceded by
t)ie pleadings, that such charge was the "regular and usual charge" for such
fiervlre. The carrier hr-re is attempting to obtain over and above th<Â» charge.
It seemT? to me that the provision of schedule A of section 2,"Â» quoted
herein even goes further than the. provisions of section 2130, C. C. The latter
does not expressly require the carrier to give such a receipt "unless de
manded"; the former requires Bueh receipt to be "issued." whether demand
on not. The language- is: "It shall Jx- the duty of every â¢ â¢ â¢ express
company. * * * to issue to the shipper â¢ â¢ â¢ a bill of lading, manifest or
other evidence, of receipt," otc.
What, is meant by the word "issue"? It seems to be contended by the
defendant that this signifies nothing more than "to prepare" and ''have
ready." Such is rertninly not its ordinary m< lining. .To ''issue." within the
meaning of the statute, is to "send forth" or "to deliver." or "place within
the control of another person," and not simply to "create a- document capable
of being stamped."
While the issuance of such a receipt by the express company without the
stamp -might I>e a compliance with the State law. yet at the same time It
would be a violation .of the revenue act. subjecting the express eompanv to
th.- penalty provided therein. In this connection, It Is said In a brief re*port
nf th^ case of Western V heel Works vh. United States Express Company
aecided.by Judere Tuley of the Circuit Court of Cook County, 111., contained
!n the .Albany Law Journal, volume 58. pnge 181. which is the only report of
the case to "wh|ch I have been able to obtain any access, the court is said to
have used the following language, which seems" to me to be vljcoroua and
conclusive of the proper construction of the war revenue act of IS9S The
:-ourt says: "It would -be an absurd conclusion to say'that the company la
â equired to Issue to the shipper an unstamped bill of lading or receipt the
Fsur of which Is made a penal offense by section 7 of- the act. Tt was not
:hc intent of the statute to place ttoe express companies under an obligation
:o do an Illegal art. The "bill of lading or receipt which the express com
mny is to Issue, must be a complete bill of lading, a legal instrument, and this
â¢an only be a stamped instrument."
For the reasons sriven In the foregoing opinion, It is ordered that judg
ment be entered for five ($5) dollars damageÃ in favor of nlafntlff and against
he defendant corporation. j. c. BARRY, Judge

THE SA"ST FBAtf CISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 2, 189 S.
READY FOR HIS ASHES.
Joaquin Miller Builds a Fu=
neral Pyre on His Ranch in
the Fruitvaje Hills.
JOAQUIN MILLER'S latest freak is to build his tomb. It is also a
crematory, and so arranged that after the incineration the ashes of
the Poet of the Sierras will b^e blown. all over the Fruitvale hills.
When he returned from the Klondike, where he had been nearly
frozen to death in his capacity as "special commissioner," his mind nat
urally reverted to warmer things. He desired to have something in sight
that would remind him of the time when he would not be forced to live
in a world of sane men and women, so he confided to the little Spanish
maiden that lives on his ranch that he would build a tombâ a real stone
pyre on which his lifeless body would be destroyed or rather transformed
into the dust from which it came. â  â¢
Several weeks ago the building commenced, and it is now finished. It is
erected on the. back of a little hill near his home, and covers a space of
exactly 100 superficial feet. It is solidly built of 62Q huge bowlders, c.ement
*ed together by skilled hands and wondrously durable.
A f<-w. feet frem the tomb is a big brown bowlder weighing over a ton.
On its smooth face is > painted in large letters the words "To the un
known," and Miller declares he wants tÂ« be forgottenâ as his poems
will be.
In the top of the pyre is a coffin-shaped hole, in which the poet
wants to be cremated. There is a draught hole through the structure
that will insure the reduction of his remains to ashes,- and having done .
this will then scatter the ashes over his beloved hills. The- poet will not
discuss, the matic-r, but merely says "It is my wish."
And the Hi tie Spanish girl who lives near-by says: ' â¢
"Why, he talked of building this tomb for a long time, and we .paid no
attention to him. Finally he got money enough to carry out the idea
and upon returning from the north sent for workmen and commenced the
task. â  â¢ . â 
"The work was expensive, but he kept It up. He said he would have
his body carried up the hill as' sbon as he was dead and laid upon the
wood and coal to burn. I know he will do It. He always keeps his .
word.
"He says he doesn't want any one asking who he Is or his name ever
mentioned again, once he is gone., so the great rock, with 'To the un
known' painted on it will be all the headstone he will have. . . â 
"We have treated it as a joke a3 much as we dared, but now there Is .
no joke' about it. He seems to think he won't .live long. ' I know that if
he should die to-morrow there would be a burning on that hill the next
day, and in plain sight of all the valley."
A SHQRTER WORKDAY. .
Employers and Employes Will Meet
in Syracuse to Arbitrate
the Question
Charles E. Hawkes, formerly president
of San Francisco Typographical Union,
leaves this morning for Syracuse, N. V.. j
where he will meet with other members of i
the shorter workday committee of the In- j
ternational Typographical Union to arbi- i
trate the shorter workday question with j
a" committee from the National Typothe
tae, or employers' association.
At the last convention of the Interna
tional Typographical Union, held in Colo
rado Springs, a resolution was adopted j
fixing nine hours per day or fifty-four !
per week. The resolution, after being i
submitted to an initiative and referendum
vote, was carried in the convention, al- j
though no day was set. â  Many of the sub
ordinate unions started an active agita
tion on the subject and as a result 153
unions are 'now working on a shorter I
workday basis. In this city an attempt
was made to reduce the hours, but. after
a strike of several wet-ks, the union was
forced to give up the struggle. It is prob
able, however, that an agreement will be
made with the Typothetae committee and
the shorter workday become an accom- j
plished.fact without further strikes. The I
committee from the International Typo- j
graphical Union consists of James J.
Murphy. New York, chairman; C. E. |
Hawkes. San Francisco, secretary; G. H.
Russel. Chattanooga; R. B. Prendergast, i
Chicago; David Hastings, Hamilton, On
tario.
John R. Winders, John Mehanny and J.
K. Phillips have also left as delegates to
the International Convention, which
meets in Syracuse on the 10th inst.
ALICE E. JOHNSON'S TALENT.
Orpheum Employes of the Opinion
That It Was a Minus Quantity.
The question as to the talent of Miss
! Alice E. Johnson, who is suing the Gus
! tav Walter Orpheum Company to recover
$750, an account alleged to bj due for five
weeks' salary she alleges she was entitled
to, again occupied the attention of Judge
Cook yesterday. The testimony of a num
ber of employes of the Orpheum, upon the 'â 
question of the quality of Miss Johnson's
performance, was heard yesterday. All
agreed that it was bad, very bad. Musi
cal Director Rosener even stated that the
plaintiff could neither sing nor act, and

EDGAB SUTBO SUES HIS WIFE.
Demands Enforcement of a Mortgage
on Property Held in Trust.
Edgar E. Sutro, contestant of the will
of Adolph Sutro, filed suit yesterday
against his wife, Henrietta L. B. Sutro,
nnd William Crane Spencer, to compel
the enforcement of a mortgage for
$B."iTl SO, which, it is alleged, the plaintiff
executed to Spencer on June 3. 1896. The
plaintiff states that his father. Adolph
Sutro, deeded some valuable property to
trustees for tho benefit of his wife and
ADVERTISEMENTS.

children. Edgar Su.tro, as one o.f the'
beneflctari-es, mortgaged his share of the
property, held in trust, to Spencer. Sub
sequently the plaintiff deeded his rever
sionary rights in the trust property to
his wile for- her benefit and- their minor
son, A. G. Sutro. . Mrs. 'Sutro- now refuses
to recognize the validity of the mortgage,
and Spencer "declines to press-his claim
for payment. Sutro prays the court to
declare 'the mortgage valid and'to compef
his wife to recognize it. He'javers that
the interest is accumulating at the rate'
of 8 per cent p.er year, . compounded
monthly, and that in the event the debt
is not liquidated it- will soon consume the
entire property. â¢ â¢
It 'is understood that the suit is a
friendly, one, and filed for the purpose
of obtaining authority from the court to
pay off the mortgage. That in the event
the claim is an illegal one, Mrs. Sutro
may not be held for the funds paid out
as guardian of her child.

He has now la his charge one of the largest stationary engines in the mannfaeturfng
district of Kensington, "and for. more than fifteen years was one of the most trusted
engineers in the employ of the Reading; Railroad Company. Speaking of -, RIPANS
TABULES, he. said:Â«-' " The lives of thousands of people often depend upon tht
tingle hand of an engineer. â â¢The man at the throttle is; responsible'for the safety of '
every soul aboard the train. He must have a steady hand and a clear eye. But en*
(jineÂ«rs, like all other human beings, are subject to ills and more than once RIPAN9 â¢>
TABULES have helped me along ,when, without them, I must 'hare failed In my duty.
"As an engineer I have been on duty.at all hours of ; the day and night." said this
man, who, by the way, is named John Gilliece and lives at No. 2054 East ; Somerset
Street in Philadelphia, "and sometimes hare had to snatch my meals with scarcely â¢-
moment's interval of rest. Consequently I hare at times; suffered intensely from.
â¢ nervous dyspepsia and poor digestion. The only thing I ever; found .that would
relievo ma. thoroughly andâ¢ quickly was a RIPANS TABULE and I still ' take onÂ« '

THE STEAMER
ZEALANDIA IN
A HURRICANE
Escaped Destruction
by an Ace.
SAVED BY SEAWORTHINESS
ACCIDENT TO THE CITY OF
PEKING.
ShÂ« Sailed Yesterday, but Broke
Down at Lime Point and
Was Towed Back to
Port.
The transport Zealandta had a terrible
time of it in the typhoon that drove her
Into Nagasaki for repairs. It was known
that she had' been damaged and was put
on the dry.dock In Japan for an overhaul-
Ing, but it was not known that nothing
but the vessel's seaworthiness saved her.
From a letter written by one of the Zea
landia'a crew to a relative in this city
the following extract was taken: "We
were pretty badly shaken up. The ty
phoon carried away boats, ventilators
railings, deckhouses, and, in fact, every
thing movable on deck. Even the an
chors broke loose and took charge for a
while. 1 tell you it was risky work se
curing them.
"The quartermaster's arm was broken
and the butcher had his shoulder broken,
while five of the firemen were scalded by
a bursting steam pipe. Everything was
wrecked in the steerage; and the stew
ard's room and storerooms were Hooded.
In consequence we had neither sugar nor
salt for two days.
"But all's well that ends well, and say
what they may the Zealandia is as stout
a seaboat as I ever set foot on. The peo
ple here on the other ships are surprised
that we escaped as easily as we did as a
typhoon generally plays havoc with what
ever it catches. \\'e have been on the
drydock three days and it will be three
more before we get off. The pintle of
the rudder are sprung and the men are
working on them now. It will take some
time to make the necessary repairs, but

. The Mall Company's steamer City of
Peking sailed . for the Orient yesterday.
She carried about one hundred piles on
her deck which are to be used in the re
pairing of the company's wharf at Yoko
uhama. Among the cabin passengers was
Captain George F. F. Wilde, who is on his
way to Manila to relieve Captain Frank
\\ ildes of the cruiser Boston. Just before
the war broke out Captain Wildes' time of
service on the Asiatic station expired and
an officer was sent out to relieve him.
When the latter arrived orders had
Â»? en Vim ? or th e feet to proceed to
Manila .so Wildes refused to give up his
ship. He appealed to Admiral Dewey and
Ins appeal was granted. How the Bos
ton fought in the battle of Manila has
already been told.
Since the annexation of Hawaii the
Chinese Government baa decided to estab
lish a consulate at Honolulu. The first
Consul General will be Yang Wei Pul.
who sailed on the Peking yesterday with
his wife and children. He was accom
panied by Yuen Chang, who will be sec
retary, and Liang, who will be clerk of
the consulate.
Th i?, machinery of the Peking became
disabled when off r'ort Point yesterday
afternoon and she ->ut back and anchored
off Lime Point, from where she was towed
by the Millen Griffith to an anchorage
near the Mail dock. A number of. the pas
sengers came ashore on the tug to await
the repairs necessary before another
start can be made.
The bark Alden Besse will sail next
\\ ednesday for Honolulu with a load of
merchandise tor the United States troops
at Honolulu. She will also take away a
considerable quantity of feed for "the
horses that left here on the ship Taco
ma for Manila. The horses are still nt
Honolulu, and the Tacoma is on her way
back to San Francisco.
The steamer Humboldt is at Washing
ton street wharf, being cleaned and paint
ed. She will probably be T., a ced on the
Eureka route when her overhauling is
completed. When on Puget Sound a few
days ago the Humboldt showed the
steamboat men up there what she could
do when called upon. The City of Kings
ton is acknowledged to be the fastest
steamer on the Sound. She was on her
way from Victoria, B. C. to Tacoma. and
the Humboldt was on her way irom St.
Michael to Seattle. When off Port Town
send the City of Kingston was two miles
and a half ahead of the Humboldt. but at
that time it never entered the head of
* antaln Bonnifield to try to catch her.
When he saw the black smoke come
pouring out of the Kingston's funnel in
her effort to run away from him he sent
for Chief Engineer Ford. The latter
watched the Sound filer for about five
minutes and then with the remark, "I'll
catch her," went clow. The Humboldt
was at once opened out and inch by Inch
she crept up on her rival. Both vessels
did their best, but in an hour and a half
the Humbolfit's nose was ahead, and from
that on she had the race all her own way.
W. A. Boole, the well known ship car
penter and rigerer, was treatr.l at the
Harbor Receiving Hospital yesterday for
a lacerated wound over tho right eye and
a number of abrasions of th 6 head and
hands. Boole was driving from Mill Val
ley to Sauzalito. and was leading a horse
behind the buggy. The animal took a.
sudden desire to get Into the vehicle, and
during its efforts Its two fore feet got
around Boole's neck. The wounds were
dressed by Drs. Hill and Zanala.
The bark Edward May. whilp being
towed to sea yesterday, collided with the
pilot boat Grade S. The bark lost her
martingale and headgear and the pilot
boat had her fiyir" lib torn and her Jib
boom damaged. The Edwarrl May came
to an anchor to repair damages.

BUFFETED BY WIND AND WAVES.
THE transport Zealandia was caught in a typhoon soon after leaving: Manila for San Francisco and had a terrible
time. Everything' movable on deck was washed away and seven of the crew were injured. The vessel finally
reached Nagasaki, where she is now being repaired. The crew expect to get home in time for Thanksgiving.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOREB 2, lÂ»t>8.
CALIFORNIA AN EASY WINNER
Tlje Olympics Suffer a Blighting Defeat in tfce Initial Same of tfte Season.
VICTORY which has hitherto shunned
the football banners of the Berkeley
legions dropped out of a clear sky
yesterday and perched upon the col
or bearers. The first football game of the
season with the Olympics on one side and
the blue and gold on the other resulted in
an overwhelming defeat for the athletic
clubmen, and now the young collegians
from across the bay are reveling in the
recollections of a score which reads 17â0.
There was little of that exuberant en?
thuslasm and the hoarse shoutings that
generally keep steady company with a
football contest when college men are
concerned. Occasionally^ the spectators
would perform throat gymnastics in their
invocations to somebody not present to
inform them what was the matter with
every player on their team taken individ
ually. It was a most orderly football
crowd that occupied the grandstand, and
It was not a big crowd at that. The same
faces lined the fence and the same cranks
were in the bleachers. With ripened years
they now watch the game with critical
interest and shout not. That Is why
there was little of the ecstatic about tho
gridiron battle In which the Olympics
were rubbed in the dust and the Califor
nians surprised themselves by winning an
easy victory.
The game opened with a kick-off by Cali
fornia. This carried the ball well Into
the Olympic territory, from which the
athletic club players did not seem to be
able to separate. Three separate times
the ball changed hands, the play being
in the neighborhood of the Olympic thirty
yard line. Once Roy Weldon tried to save
his team by punting, but the ball sailed
to the side and fell Into the hands of tho
enemy. With the pigskin on the Olympic
twenty-five yard line Thane of California
advanced it a few yards and then the
next play brought Percy Hall, the scarred
veteran of the- gridiron, into sudden view
freeing himself from the pack and shak
ing off his pursuers until he landed the
ball back of the goal line and on a spot
mathematically equidistant from the
poles. Score sâo. Kaarsberg kicked a
goal: score 6âo. The first half was over
after the following play.
. Even the people who were satisfied to
chants' Exchange yesterday says It is an
chored three miles northwest of Pigeon
Point, directly in the course of coasting
steamers.
John Allen was treated at the Harbor
Receiving Hospital yesterday by Drs. Hill
and Zabala for a lacerated wound of the
scalp. He was turning from East street
into Market with a load of hay, when the
right hind wheel of his wagon broKe. The
shock threw him from his seat to the
pavement, where he struck on his head.
The American snip Florence, which ar
rived here from Philadelphia on August
13, has been purchased by W. E. Mighell
of this city for. it is said. $3f..u00. Mr.

SONS OF EXEMPTS.
The Society Elects New Officers â A
Circular Setting Forth the Ob
jects of the Organization.
The Sons of Exempt Firemen of San
Francisco at their last held meeting elect
ed the following named as officers for
the current term: L. S. Graves, presi
dent; F. E. Edwards, vice president; A.
McFarland, secretary; Joseph Mii-hales,
treasurer; C. J. Donahue, marshal; W.
P. Humphries, \V. J. Guilfoyle, F. E. Ed
wards, J. R. Kentzel, G. M. Grief, Wil
liiim G. McKibbin and G. W. Smith, di
rectors. The association also adopted a
revist-d constitution and by-laws.
JVt this time the association has quite
a membership, and has the names of
nearly a hundred sons of exempts who
will be asked to join for the purpose of
perpetuating the old exempt company. In
a circular letter calling attention to the
association the officers say:
There Is no society west of the Rocky Moun
tains (you might Hay In the United States) de
servlnÃ <>f more credit ami praise from the
sltlsena and community at large than the Kx
empt Fire Company of Han Francisco, Cal..
who not only helped to build up this great
city of the extreme West, but many times in
the early hlÃtory of our great State saved the
said city of San FranclFco from total deHtruc
tlon by fire, and In more than one Instance
Imperiled their lives to accomplish the same.
Does not thin glorious organization deserve
Ff.mo recognition at the hands and hearts of
the community, especially their sonn?
We are KMT? to slate that the members of
the Exempt Fin- Company are faHt being called
to their final home and naturally are becom
ing fewer in numbers. Why should they be
forgotten and their many relics fall into the
hands of those who will never appreciate them?
A few of the sons of the old firemen have
started a society known as the Sons of Ex
empt Firemen of San Francisco. Its objects
take any kind of football for their money
hoped for better things in the second half,
and the gods heard their prayers. Roy
Weldon kicked off for the Olympics, and
the ball dropped in Pringle'B hands, and
he advanced it to the California 25-yard
line. The next signal called Percy Hall
to the trenches, which he immediately
left for the outposts of the enemy. He
did not stop running until he reached
the Olympic 35-yard line, having covered
about fifty yards of territory on the fly
ing jump. Then came another hammer
ing at the Olympic center, and. Hall found
himself under the goal posts for the sec
ond time. A goal was kicked and the
score read 12 â 0.
Another Olympic kick off and a slight
fumble by Thane, who caught the rolling
are to perpetuate the memories of the ex
empt Bremen Ot San Francisco and also to
preserve all relics and records of said asso
ciation.

and passed the ball to Kaarsberg, whose
flying leaps through the center were the
sensation of the day. Kaarsberg just
ran. In and out of the scattered field he
picked his way, clearing sixty yards be
fore he was bagged. Then Hall sought
the earth under the goal posts and the
score read 17â0, with no goal.
The second half redeemed the game,
which on the whole was of a fine order
for an initial contest. Both the Califor
nit and Stanford coaches expressed them
selves in terms very favorable to the blue
and gold eleven. The Olympics were o.ut

at the Big Coursing
Green Yesterday
Afternoon. . . .
It was about a standoff between the
bookies and the bettors at Union Co.ursi'ng
Park yesterday. The bowling over- of
Gallagher, who was favorite and -ran.
against Left Bower, caused the â  bookies
to howl when they saw him .do . some
clever acrobatic work on the field, but the
hoisting of the pad and white flays gave
them a chance to breathe easy, as it
saved them considerable money, though'
the oddsâ 2 against' 2 J ,-iâ left but a alight
pull-down. In consequence of the race
being a "go-by," a second dash pretty,
much on the same bet resulted in' 'the
defeat of Gallagher, who on the second
run rolled over himself once more, giving
the hare and bets to Left Bower.

AT INGLESIDE.
Johnny R, Scores a Large Number of
Points Against Tullamore in
a Grilling Course.
Lively betting and long and exciting
courses warmed the blood of 500 visitors
to the Ingleside Park yesterday. . Two
stakes, the annual California Produce and
the All-Aged, brought out the cracka
jacks. A consolation stake added Interest
to the day's sport, which proved the finest
seen at Ingleside for many months. â  â¢
The large crowd not only Witnessed the.
downfall of Mayflower and Billy Glad-,
stone, but they saw Johnny R, the hero
of many twisting courses, score 30 points
to Tullamore's nothing in a chase of 4
minutes and 3 seconds. The latter course
proved the star feature of the day. A
lively jack was let loose, and the black
and white dog in a few bounds. passed his
rival and began scoring. The hare' led the
veteran hither and thither until -901110
fear was folt that Johnny R might' o.iit^
run himself. Tullamore lagged at his
heels, however, and the former with a re
newed burst of speed caught the prey,
gaining a victory. Johnny R was taken
in charge by his trainer, and after a good
rubdown was wrapped in cloths to pre
vent stiffening. At a late hour the dbg
was doing well, but It is feared that the
long run has affected his chance of win
ning the stake.
Two fall-downs were recorded in the
Produce Stake. Mayflower was favorite
over Rocket at 5 to 1, but the latter dog
won the flag. Despite the fact that Billy
Gladstone was afflicted with a. lame leg
and was sadly out of condition, the talent
bunked their faith on his ability to. down
Reflna, a practically unknown performer.

ESCAPES TIL
FOR MURDER
A Jury Decides That
He Is Crazy.
LONG RECORD OF LUNACY
HIS FATHERS TALE DOES NOT
LEAVii ANY DOUBT.
The Expert Believes That the Mur
derer Should Be Confined for .
Life to Prevent More
Tragedies.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
.908 Broadway. S.ept. 30.
Frank L. Cheesemaii will not be tried
for the murder of Henry Brooks two j
months ago. He is declared to.be insane j
and wiis to-day ordered to an asylum.
This morning a jury was impaneled in
Judge Ocden's court room to Inquire, into'
the mental standing of the murderer. The
chief witness wag: the prisoner's father,
and his testimony left rip doubt In the
mind of the courl or thÂ£ jury that Cheese
man is a lunatic.
The father's story commenced with an
accident that happenexl to Frank Cheese
man when he was 7 years of agi . He waa
run over and sustained injuries to his
head. From that time his conduct has]
always been unreliable. For nearly twen
ty years he has made periodical attempts
to end his life, and his father related in
detail ail the- circumstances connected.!
with his son's ghastly record.
He has attempted hanging, cutting his
throat, shooting himself and jumping
from the ferry boatâ all as a means to
end hjs life, and v few'menths a.;,'" his
faictdal mania turned into a homicidal
craving. .
Dr. Robertson, an export on insanity,
listened to the- father.'.- story and K-tve it
as his unqualiriv that Cheesem&n
was insane at the time of the murder and i .
still insane, although in the interval he
may have had brief lucid periods. Dr.
Robertson discusses! the case at length,
and said that the record as told by the
father was ne of- the most .remarkable
he has ever heard. He stated that if
such testimony were'-giyen in many other
where insanity is alleged on vari
- It would greatly facilitate
the work of the courts. He declared that
while at the present time Cheesemaii ia
Insane, it 13 quite possible that he might
be so rational at some future time that
pome State hospital, actuated by a desjire
to prevent the terrible overcrowding to
which such institutions are now sub
ject, might discharge . the murderer as
cured, and in a short time- his mania
might be as rabid as ever. Under this
condition Dr. Robertson said that Creese
man should be ordered to be confined for
life, or else under such restraint that,
should his reason return, he should
be again subject to the jurisdiction of
the court. Only by such caution, said the
expert, could it .. be guaranteed that
â  man would not again commit mur
der.
Judge Ogden after hearing- the testi
mony committed" the murderer to Stock
ton.

BALLOTS WILL TELL
OF DR. BRIGGS' FATE
HIS TRIAL FOB IMMORALITY
CONCLUDED.
The Jury Has Voted but the Ballots
Are Sealedâ Will Be Opened
To-Morrow.
OAKLAND, Oct. I.â The ecclesiastical
trial of Rev. Dr. R. J. Briggs on charges
of immorality was concluded early this
evening, and the thirteen jurors have cast
their secret ballot as to his guilt or vindi
cation; but the result will not- be offi
cially announced to the - Pacific Coast
Conference of .the M. .E. Church South
until next Monday morning's session. The
case was argued before the jury this af
ternoon. The discussions were limited to
forty-five minutes each,- that on behalf of
the defense being divided between Rev.
.Mr. Carpenter and. Rev. Dr. Briggs, who
pleaded in his own behalf.
It was reported to-night that the pre
ponderance of evidence -against Dr.
Brian* had proved so strong that the ver
dict might be to the effect that the
charges had been sustained.
Rev. Mr. Carpenter, completely worn
out from his labors of last night, this i
morning and this afternoon/retired early j
at the Juanita, and refused absolutely to I
be seen by any one. He stated to Dr. '
.Emory and others, 'however, that he had ,
no knowledge of what the verdict was. ;
"Why the jurors themselves do not know
what their verdict was," said one of the
presumably knowing ones.
Dr. Emory's brother-in-law was one of i
the jurors, and even he could not tell
what the result was. He even declined
to tell Dr. Emory how he had voted, and i
said that the truth would not be di- :
vulged till Monday. "I believe and i
would almost wager that Dr. Briggs will
come out entirely cleared of the charges.
Should he be found guilty, however, the
penalty of course would be expulsion ;
from membership and from the church."
If the South Methodists have felt any
great Interest in the trial they have care- |
fully concealed it, but there is evidently '
an undercurrent of feeling among the j
many delegates that the conference, |
which contains some 8000 communicants,
has been very seriously injured by the j
scandal.
At this morning's session of the confer
ence the committee on district records
and the Board of Education read reports,
which were adopted; and Colonel Austin,
president of the Pacific Methodist Col
i lege, spoke at length on the college work
and the necessity of raising funds to con
i tinue the same. A recommendation that
| $1500 be appropriated, to ward the support
of the college, the sum to be raised in
the different charges on the fourth Sun
day in February, was adopted. The Revs, i
! J. Gruwell, L. D. Hargis, A. F. Lee, A. L. <
Hunsaker and W. J. Mahon were placed i
: on the superannuated list; and memorial I
' services were held for Revs. B. C. How
; ard, O. H. Newton, B. P. Burris and D.
1 M. Rice, all of whom have died during
I the year.

THE SAX FBAJSCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, . OCTOBER 2, 1898.
ESTABLISHES
A NEW RECORD
FOR HIGH JUMP
Ukiah High School
Boy Clears Six Feet. â¢
ARTHUR HENLEY'S GREAT LEAP
ACADEMIC ATHLETIC LEAGUE'S
FIELD DAY.
Youthful Sprinters, Hurdlers and
Weight-Throwers Meet in Friend
ly Competition on the
Olympic Club Oval.
Arthur S. Henley, a mere slip of a boy,
competing at the semi-annual field day
of the. Academic Athletic League yester
day, leaped gracefully over the bar in the
competition among high jumpers, and es
tablished a new Californian record. He
cleared the light bamboo obstacle at six
feet one inch. The former record of five
feet eleven and three-quarter inches Is
one of long standing, having withstood
repeated assaults from college men and
others.
The youthful jumper, representing
Ukiah High School, lacked but an Inch
to equal the Pacific Coast record. This
is held Jointly in the Northwest by Ker
rigan of Oregon and Patterson of this
city at six feet two inches.
Henley's grand performance was but an
incident of an afternoon of brillant sport.
The times in the various sprint races did
not border on the sensational, but the
completion throughout was keen. The air
was sharp and crisp as befitted the Ist
of October, but the high school boys
braved it all in the most abbreviated of
garments.
Abodie and Cadogan carried off the
honors in the sprint races. The former
reserved himself for the classic "hun
dred,"' which he won all the way. Cado-'
gan won both the "220" and "440," running
clean away from his fields in both events.
This was most noticeable in the quarter
mile, when he won by the length of a
street, his field being strung out behind
him like the tail of a vagrant kite.
Estes of San Jose was the pick of the
bunch in the hammer throw. He was
pressed closely by Nuckalls of Ukiah, a
youth of aldermanic proportions. Both
have great strength, and with coaching
will develop into masters of the game.
Tom Carroll, the professional, aided in
conducting the field events. When the
amateurs retired he tried the "hammer."
He wasn't feeling very strong, but in his
first attempt he threw the Implement
over the fence. The second time he sent
it trough- the fence, while at the third
attempt he placed it far up In the tennis
court. _, , ,
The various events were run of? in quick
succession, there being no delays what
ever, thanks to John Elliott, who made
an excellent referee and starter.
The size of the track interfered with the
bicycle race. Two riders fell in one heat,
but were uninjured.
The championship banner was won by
Oakland High School with 46 points; Poly
technic second, 27 points; Ukiah, 17: Lo

SUEY'ESCAPE
FROM JUSTICE
WAS A PICNIC
No Obstacle in Way of
the Procuress.
MEREDITH WAS FOREWARNED
WAS URGED TO MAKE A COM
PLAINT TO HOLD HER.
jÃut He Left All the Doors Open
Between the Notorious
Chinese Woman
â¢ and Liberty.
The prominent topic of conversation yes
terday in the Appraisers' building was
the escape of the notorious slave import
er, Mrs. Fong Suey, right under the nose
of .the -Chinese' bureau.
The woman- was arrested in last Tues
.â  day's i.raid and was Identified at the Pres
byterian "Mission on the same evening by
several of -.her victims. The testimony
was .in the hands of the Chinese bureau
on Wednesday, but the Chief neglected to
have a complaint made against her in
â¢conformity with the testimony, and as
.she â¢was. held only on a complaint for be
ing iii this country without a certificate
there Was no difficulty in procuring her
.-discharge' when she produced her certiil
cal-e in Judge He-aeock's chambers en Fri
day. â  â¢ â  â¢
Nejther United States Attorney Foote
nor his deputies wore informed by the
bureau as to the intention to proseciite the
woman for the graver offense; the United
States Marshal had not been warned
against allowing her to be released with
out notifying the Chief of the bureau of
such an attempt, and Judge Heacock had
n-ot been notified that she was to be prose
' cuted upon another charge than the one
which had been originally preferred
against her.
Chief Meredith knew that the woman
would be likely to escape, for last Thurs
day his attention was personally called
by a newspaper reporter to the fact that
tne woman could not be held on the origi
nal charge because she had already pro
duced her certificate and that unless a
new complaint were made against her
her attorneys would secure her release.
Meredith said that no new complaint had
been made because he was not ready to
make one at that time, but that he was
getting up "a great case" against her.
â¢. There was considerable friction between
Chief Meredith and Major Moore, the
special agent of the Treasury, who had
secured the information upon which the
raid pi Tuesday was based and which
made, it so successful. There seemeed to
be a disposition on the part of Mr. Mere
dith to convey the impression that Major
Moore should share the responsibility lor
the escape of Fong Suey and the scandal
which it has caused. Major Moore, how
ever, denies that he had anything to do
w4th the prosecution of the woman, that
being, the exclusive duty of the bureau.
Th-e major, however, of his own motion,
fn order to prevent any further escapes of
the women whom he had been at so much
labor to capture, yesterday detailed Colo
nel Vernon on duty in Commissioner Hea
cock's courtroom from the time of its
opening until Its cl
When Major Moore heard of the escape
last Friday afternoon he requested Dep
uty United States Attorney Schlesinger
to. draw up a complaint against Fong
Suey for importing slaves into the United
States. This was done, and a warrant
was Issued In accordance therewith.
Mr. Meredith said yesterday that if the
woman's attorneys did not surrender their
client he would put the screws on them,
whatever that vague threat might mean.
The attorneys had done nothing wrong.
They had made no false representations.
They, had brought their client into court
upon thei orily charge that had been pre
ferred against her, had proved that she
was entitled to be in this country, and
Bhe was discharged by Judge de Haven
Upon the recommendation of Commis
sioner Heacock.
The woman's attorneys promised to sur
render her yesterday, but they were un
able to find her. They hold that the
charge against her is outlawed by the
statute of limitations; but Major Moore is
of the opinion that the Government has
yet a month's grace.
As an instance of the manner in wheih
the Bureau has been managed, it may be
Btated here that for many months Com
missioner Heacock has insisted that the
statements of Chinese immigrants made
to the Bureau on board the steamer
should be read over to the immigrant
and signed by him- but his request was
persistently ignored until about a week
nr two ago. The Commissioner was
obliged to refuse to admit these tran
scripts of testimony as evidence that the
immigrant had made in court a different
and contradictory statement to the ona
he had made on board ship.
B. E. Meredith, chief of the bureau re
ferred to, takes exception to any infer
ence that the entire responsibility for the
escape of Fong Suey rests with him. He
â¢xplains that he and Special Agent Moore
were both "caught nodding" bv the per
sons who secured the woman s release.
He s.ays:
"In an unfortunate moment the case
was suddenly called in tho Commission
er's court, without the knowledge of my
i<-If. any member of the bureau or of any
ADVERTISEMENTS.
SORE HANDS

. About eight years ago I got sore hands, it
commenced with a kind of a burning sensa-
tion on' my fingers and on top of the hand. â¢
"When I commenced to rub them, you could
Bee little white pimples on the skin. I rubbed
more and more, until I felt like twisting my
fingers out of their sockets. I had high
fever, and cold chills ran over me, and so I
kept it going until I was tired out. Nights, I
had to walk the floor until I fell asleep.
My hands peeled like an onion, the finger
. nails got loose in the roots, and the water ran
out, and wherever there was a little pimple,
there the burning fire was, and I tell you and
can prove to you, that happened at least ten
times. During the day, I had to attend to my
business, for I am running a blacksmith shop,
horseshoeing, and 1 would not shut up tho
Shop for anybody, but it was hard. My hands
puffed up worse than a toad. "When I drove
horse nails, the water from my hands ran
through the bandage, on to the floor. My
customers refused to look at my hands. I had
a friend to take me to the doctor; he gave a
solution of something to bathe my bands
with. I was working every day, and did not
know what to do so I went to another doctor,
I think for a year. I found your advertise-
' ment in a Utica newspaper, and I got the Co-

nails hardened up and peeled off and I don't
t believe there is one of the first nails left on
my hands. What I have told you is true. I
- do this for your benefit and humanity's sake.
I would not suffer any more as I did, for the

ARE THEY PURSUED
BY A SIOUX CITY NEMESIS?
Wife of J. M. Nead, a Methodist Exhorter, Is Found Guilty of Vagrancy
and Serious Charges Are Brought Against the Divine.
Troubles in the Past.
SERIOUS charges are pending
against J. M. Nead. a regularly
certificated Methodist exhorter,
and his wife. On Wednesday
evening last Mrs. Nead was arrested
by Officer Joy and charged with
vagrancy. The case came up for trial
yesterday morning before Judge Low.
Much damaging testimony was ou.ered
and the woman was adjudged guilty.
Sentence was,' however, suspended at
the request of Prosecuting Attorney
Reynolds, and the charges went over
until Monday, when It is proposed to
reopen the case. Mr. Nead was also
arrested yesterday and charged with
vagrancy, and will be tried with his
wife.
The Nead case offers many extra
ordinary and mystifying features. The
trial of the woman was the occasion
of a most affecting scene, and when
the verdict of guilty was pronounced
both the exhorter and his wife gave
way to uncontrollable emotion and
sobbed piteously.
Neither the preacher nor his wife
had any testimony to submit in their
behalf, nor any explanation to offer
of the horrible and revolting charges
made out against them. Both protested
their innocence and seemed at a loss to
explain the accusations that were so
strongly brought against them.
Officers Joy, McLean, Sylvester and
Gillen offered much damaging testi
mony, as did also Mrs. Ralph, the
landlady of a rooming-house at 32
Turk street, where it was alleged Mrs.
Xead had hired a room for immoral
purposes.
Joy, the arresting officer, claimed
that the prisoner, Mrs. Nead, has been
upon the streets at all hours and that
last Saturday evening while out in
the drenching rain plying her nefarious
trade she accosted him. The officer
was dressed in civilian garb, and, con
sequently, tho woman did not know
that she was "up against" a repre
sentative of the law.
According to the women who con
duct the houses at which it is claimed
one connected with the special agent's
office. I immediately telephoned Special
Agent Moore of what had occurred and
jointly we set to work to undo the un
fortunate occurrence.
"If either the special agent or myself or
any member of our respective staffs had
had an idea that a case of such notoriety
could have slipped us in an unguarded
moment we would have remained in the
court continually.
"I protest against the singling out of
myself as to blame entirely and say fur
ther that a conscientious effort was made
upon my part to carry the case to a suc
cessful issue and such efforts continue.
The woman will be apprehended and that
shortly." .^___________
ASSOCIATED CYCLERS.
Will Not Govern Racing Outside of
the Pacific Coast, but Will Af
filiate With Any New
Eastern Body.
The California Associated Cycling
Clubs will not attempt to govern cycle
racing outside of its own territory, the
Pacific Coast. This action was decided
upon at the regular monthly meeting last
evening.
The question was brought up by several
telegrams from prominent Eastern riders,
who are tired of the arbitrary control of
the League of American Wheelmen, ask
ing if the California Association would
take charge, issue sanctions and govern
tracks and racing men.
The delegates discussed the matter at
length and decided that the Eastern men
should organize a controlling body of
their own, which could then affiliate with
the California Association, the Southern
Cyclists' Union of New Orleans, and the
"Western Association of Denver. Com
plete independence of the league would
then be had.
The president was instructed to tele
graph this decision back to the Eastern
riders, with assurances of the hearty sup
port of the Callfornlans in any matter
within its scope.
President Charles Albert Adams was in
the chair, and Stanley G. Scovern acted
as secretary. Delegates were present
from the Acme Club Wheelmen of Oak
land, Ariel Bicycle Club of Vailejo, Capi
tal City Wheelmen of Sacramento. Enci
nal Bicycle Club of Alameda and the Bay
City Wheelmen, California Cycling Club,
Imperial Cycling Club and Olympic Club
Wheelmen of this city.
The chairman was authorized to appoint
a committee from the clubs to confer with
the Merchants' Association and the Team
sters' Union regarding rÂ« proposed parade
on Saturday evening. October 22, to cele
brate the repaying of Market street.
President Adams was also authorized
to appoint a committee of five to arrange
for the association's annual theater party.
No School Holiday To-Morrow.
At the office of the Board of Education
THE SAN FtfANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY,. OCTOBER 2, 1898.
Mrs. Nead had rented rooms, tho
prisoner made no attempt to conceal
her purpose, nor the fact that she
was a married woman. To Mrs.
Ralph explained that her husband
was running a cigar and confectionery
establishment on Market street, and
.that it was her purpose to assist him
financially. Previous to taking rooms
of the Ralph woman it is stated that
Mrs. Nead secured a lodging at 280
O'Farrell street. Miss Frost, the land
lady of the O'Farrell street house,
is authority for the statement that
Nead accompanied his wife when
she paid her week's rental on the day
she took possession, and that he plain
ly explained the purpose of his wife,
and dilated upon the fact that they
were strangers here and had some lit
tle capital which they did not propose
to draw upon. Mrs. Nead remained
at the O'Farrell street house but one
night. Miss Frost met her upon the
street and informed her that she per
mitted no such conduct in her lodgers.
Mrs. Nead then went to the Ralph
house.
Both Nead and his wife were al
lowed by Judge Low to go upon their
yesterday it was stated that a number
of inquiries had been received asking if
the schools would be closed on Monday,
October 3. This was formerly a . holi
day, it being the one set apart as a State
labor day. Under recent legislation thÂ«
State and national days were merged
into one â the national day. Hence the
schools will not close to-morrow.

The wife of the exhorter is a mod
est looking little woman, gentle as to
manner and refined in appearances. Her
dreadful experiences have left her ap
parently cool and calm. She seeks to
offer no explanation of the strange
case, save to assert that she is inno
cent.
Rev. Mr. Nead has studied over the
case and believes it one of mistaken
identity, or else the work of his for
mer wife, a wealthy woman of Sioux
City, lowa.
"This lady, the 'vagrant,' " said Mr.
Nead, "is my second wife. I divorced
my first wife several years ago, and

BEAD SMUGGLER'S BICHES.
SALINAS, Sept. 30.â When James Har
kins, who was confined for one year in
the San Jose jail several years ago for
opium smuggling, died in April, 1597, ha
left a fortune estimated at $112,000, con
sisting of 1764 acres of land in Santa Cruz
County known as the San Andreas ranch,
a house and lot on the northwest corner
of Twenty-fifth and Howard streets, San
Francisco, and an immense quantity of
grain, stock and other personal property
in Monterey County. This he devised to
his sister, Annie Welsh, the real estate
for her use during her life, and the bal
ance for her use and benefit absolutely.
On hor death the real estate was to be
divided, share and share alike, between
one daughter and three sons of a dead
sister of Harkins, named Margaret Ford.
The will was filed and probated on May
21. 1597.
This afternoon Attorney F. J. Murphy
of Watsonville, on behalf of Mrs. Welsh,
executrix, asked to be substituted for
Holbrook & Maher as counsel. He stated
that the property had increased in value
and was worth now over $30,000, and that
owing to ambiguity* in the wording of
the last will of Harkins it had been de
cided to have the court pass upon the
document and determine exactly what
was meant. Suit will be commenced next
week by one of the Ford heirs, and there
is great curiosity as to the outcome of
the question of the distribution of the
old smuggler's wealth.
Struck by a Car.
.Alfred Madeson, residing at 48 Sacra
mento street, was struck by Valencia
street car No. 19 shortly after 5 o'clock
last evening while crossing Market street
at the corner of East. The car knocked
him down and he was dragged for a
short distance. He was taken to the Har
bor Hospital by Officer Flemming, and a
broken ankle was dressed by Drs. Thomp
son and ilorrlson.
GRAND JURORS
HEATING IRONS
SIZZLING HOT
They Want to Blister
Certain Officials.
WILL BE READY THIS WEEK
REGISTRATION AND SCHOOL
BOARD FRAUDS PROBED.
A Little Claptrap Charge Against
Registrar Biggy Investi
gated and Dis
missed.
The Grand Jury has several irons in the
flre at the present time, all of which are
being heated sizzling hot. It is very anx
ious to blister half a dozen precinct regis
tration officials, and to that end is busily
fanning the flame of an investigation into
a bright light of considerable calorific
power. Yesterday certain documents from
the office of Registrar Biggy were ob
tained and taken to the juryroom. A
curious story was afloat in the corridors
during the afternoon that a disappointed
seeker for the Registrar's order to fur
nish small supplies for election day, such
as pens,, ink, paper, etc, had complained
to the Grand Jury that Piggy did not give
everybody a fair show to furnish the ma
terial on competitive bids. Although the
total cost of the supplies was only about
$200, the Grand Jury saw fit to look into
the matter for a few minutes, and found
that Biggy had sent around to several
stationery firms and asked for prices be
fore awarding the order. It was asserted
by several persons about the County At
torney's office that this little diversion
against the Registrar was a bit of spite
work, induced by the official's supposed
connection with the investigation of pre
cinct registration officials now in progress.
It is known that the preliminary steps
have been taken by the jury to fix the
responsibility for the registration frauds
in two precincts. Quite a number of wit
nesses will probably be summoned unis
At the same time, while looking for the
fuilty registration officials, the Grand
ury will inspect the books of the School
Board to ascertain certain facts about the :
methods of that body in conducting finan
cial matters. Yesterday subpenas were
issued for a number of the members of
the board and Secretary Welsh to appear
at once. Subsequently Messrs. Gallagher
and Waller came to the city buildings,
the latter stating that he had heard a
summons was out for him, and he had
arrived to make connections with it. Gal
lagher had his notice in his pocket. Later,,
word was sent around that the members
of the board, especially the members of
the finance committee, would be wanted
some day this week, but that a mistake
had been made in issuing all of the sum
monses for Saturday. Only Secretary
Welsh was wanted at the outset, to ex
plain the methods of giving out contracts
in vogue, etc. Mr. W<l*h furnished this
information to the jurors, and the investi
gation went over for the time being. The
special subject for inquiry is said to be
the lumber contracts let by the board, a
shortage in delivery being alleged. The
last Grand Jury opened up the subject,
but did not reach conclusions.
The jury returned two indictments late

Death of W. H. Watson.
W. H. Watson, a man long identified
with the interests of California and Ne
vada, died at his home, 151 Octavia street,
last Tuesday. In the latter pan of the
fifties he organized the firm or Watson &
Bean hardware dealers in Sacramento,
and in 1863 went to Virginia City, Nevada,
where he engaged in the mining business.
Later he became Secretary of the Alta,
Benton. Lady Washington and other
lower Gold Hill mines. Deceased leaves
two sons, William H. Watson Jr. and
Gixirge P. J. Watson, both residing in this
city. Death was the result of apoplexy.

WARDS INSPECTION TRIP.
The Assistant Plumbing Inspector
Learned Some Things.
Assistant Plumbing Inspector P. F.
Ward returned to San Francisco yester
day after a month's absence in Eastern
cities.
He states that he visited all the large
cities east of the Mississippi and found
nowhere such excellent plumbing as is
to be found in San Francisco. In most
places, however, he discovered that ordi
nances were enforced which prevented
the indiscriminate tearing up of paved
streets to lay pipes.
"In Boston I found the best arrange
ment," remarked Mr. Ward. "The city,
when it prepares to paVe a. street, first
sewers it and then lays all necessary
wires and pipes, including gas and water,
extending connections of each from the
street to the curb in front of each lot.
It does not matter whether gas or water
is wanted at the time. The property
owner is obliged to pay for the connec
tions Just the same, as a part of the tax
against his real estate. Later the pave
ment is laid, and then there is no excuse
for tearing up afterward. Everybody has
connections.
"San Francisco is almost the only city
that permits everybody to tear up the
streets to lay pipes according to whim."
The Paris Exposition.
The officers of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association are taking a great
Interest in the coming- exposition to be
held in Paris in 1900. There is a particular
desire to awaken the wine and dried fruit
men to the importance of making exhib
its, and to begin to prepare for it at once.VIOLA DALLINGFORD
AND HER DEMON
"T 'Tjf ' T HEX Viola Dallingsford developed a demon
â V J\ I V her.inother was pleased lather than other
\ / 1/ .wise. Mrs.- Dallingsford was recently con
"V: .y.' - verted to Spiritualism and she called Vi
" V 'â 'â '. ola's . demon a Manifestation. The neigh
.bor's,'. rudely material, called' it fits.. But then every
thing in; this \yor.ld depends on, the point of view. Mrs.
DaHirigsford' clung: enthusiastically to hers and the
neighbors did not change theirs. â¢
Viola's derhon is young. Viola is young, tooâ a little
girl or ten. J;ut the demon is even youngerâ a mat
t-r of only four, or five months. He came Into the
f rnily 3at the invitation, so to speak, of a spirit me
dium" who rented a room from Mrs. Dalllngsford ana
llngly left the door of it open while, she tipped
tables and wrote out messages from the spirit world.
It is not- .in the nature of little girls of ten to pass
doors of this kind without looking In. Sometimes it
is not even in the nature of their mothers. Mrs.
DalilngVford and Viola peeked. And one fine day the
.lady Tin â ;Uiiii caught them at it.
â¢ Arid did she order them off about their business,
and close her door forever after on her own?
Nay. not: shi in the" most polite and persuasive
.manner "she askÂ«d- them in and - Beated them beside
her at the tipping table and called, in Mrs. Dallings
ford's dead brdth.-râ who .was also Viola's uncle â
their enrertaiinn. : and When they went, aw'ay mar
vfiHtiK and on the. whole mightily pleased. Invited them
to. come-again, >vhi'. they did very frequently and, to
make a short story ihorter, in two weeks had made
eohyerts .of them both. V; '

The creed of .childh.,/>d Is faith in all thingsâ In
.mothers '.especially. .
. : . Mrs. Palllnjrsford beeii,.e an ardent believer In
â¢ spirkualigm. -Viola remained a believer in her mother.
;.Th'e- idy medium said the child had a great gift and
VpfterecT to develop it. Nervous, sensitive, imaginative,
Credulous, precocious childhood Is material which may

And Viola was only ten â a chUd-medium, a wonder,

out in her sleep that there was a great white light
about her bed, and that s-iie heard the spirits calling
h.r ami felt the touch of their hands.
And Mrs. Dallingsford, who, with all her faith, saw
ami heard and felt none of these things, looked on her
child with awe and felt no feat â for the mother was
asleep in the spiritualist. Even when the spirits which
Viola had seemed to control took their turn at con
trolling her and one evil spirit in particular seized on
the child whenever she set about the ceremonies of
table-tipping and message-writing, threw the pencil
from her fingers, filing her arms about, twisted hei
little head on its slender neck and even lifted her
small body from the chair and flung it to the floor,
Mrs. Dallingsford contentedly received the lady me
dium's explanation that the spiritual farce in Viola
was too great for her physical strength and that with
years would come the power to control and direct it.
Meantime, said the lady medium, Mrs. Dallingsfora
and Viola must be patient, there was nothing to
be done.
And since there was nothing to be done the lady
medium gave up her room at Mrs. Dallingsford'c
house on Sixth street and went her proselyting ways
and left the mother alone with the child and the
spiritual force that was too strong for them both.
It was about this time that the neighbors began
saying that the Dallingsford child had fits and, as
the spiritual force in Viola took the form of biting,
scratching, kicking and hair-pulling. Mrs. Dallings
ford, still respectful and believing, decided to remove
the Manifestation from her Immediate neighborhood
and sent Viola for a change on a visit to her country
cousins who live in the hills beyond San Rafael.
I went there to see her with the man who dls.
covered her. He told mo this story on the warm ana
quiet way over dusty roads which lead out of San
Rafael to the dip of the hills where Viola lives now
with her demon and her country cousins. He finished
it neatly just as we goi to the door.
It was a screen door, locked on the inside against
another door. The blinds were closed and fastened.
Tfee shadow of great trees lay heavily on the porch.
Creeping, flowerles* things sagged from the walls. The
place looked dead and buried.
"Br-r-r-r!" said I. "I would have demons here
myself. Blue devils, blaak butterflies! Where's the
sun?"
"Viâ oâ la!"
So sweet, so faint, so fairâ trickling: through the
silence like a little silver stream.
"Vi-o-la! Open the door!"
"Who is it?" I asked. "Is she as sweet as the
sounds?"
But Just then Viola opened the door. She opened
It into a. black little hall and stood In the angle of Itâ
a small, dark figure, gathering all the light into her
white, white little face. She looked at us curiously
and smilelessly.
â¢ â¢ â¢
"I'll write first," she said, and a pencil and some
copy paper being furnished by her visitors she sits
down, pencil in hand, and waits' quietly. There is no
paraphernalia, no screen of darkness, no singing of
hymns, no gasps and weird passing of hands. Her
seat is her mother's lap, a book answers for a table,
and the sunlight sifting through the vines falls on
her smooth hair and smiling childish face.
A minute drags slowly by in silence so deep that
the dog, stretched on, the carpet at his ; playmate's
feet, wakes and cocks an interrogative eye at the spell
bound group, then expresses his opinion of us by a
contemptuous yawn, stretches himself out an inch or
so longer and goes to sleep again.
The artist gives me a covert glance expressive: of
amused skepticism â it is all so bald and bare and
above-board, such a clumsy attempt at imitation of
rnediumistic methods, that even my faith in the little
one's honesty of purpose begins to waver. She will
probably scrawl some non-committal messages of her
own volition andâ A sudden tremor runs down the
thin little arm and strikes the supine fingers like ' an
electric shock. The hand, with the. pencil held in a
vise-like grip, begins to beat a fierce tattoo . upon the
paper â¢ and dart to and â  fro above it so swiftly ana
erratically that the eye can scarcely follow its move
ments. ;.-â¢;_ ;!/'/->
Viola looks up and laughs. "They have come!"
she says, delightedly, and then the mother asks the
artist, who stands nearest, to steady the convulsively
jerking arm by placing his hand upon it. His touch
produces, instant cessation of motion and : for a few
seconds rigidity takes the place of excited muscular
' action; then the restraining grasp is shaken ' off aÂ»
easily as though it were a bit of dust upon her sleeve,
and with a strong, firm stroke the little hand draws
half a dozen lines straight across the paper. "They
are used to ruled paper," explains Viola, and she be
gins to write.
The "spirits(?)" who have come to us are the two,
presumably Viola's brother and uncle, â¢ who have
"written through her(?)" since she first came under
"the Influence (?)". and they prove well-mannered and
amiable. They give us their names and a polite greet
ing, and then as I am beginning to feel doubtful again,
since it is easy for even a child to write 'things like
these, Viola turns her face upon me suddenly. '..'
"This next is for you," she says, "no one else must
look." She has passed all the other messages rapidly'
into the hand nearest â this she folds carefully and
gives to me.
X take it to the window and oj}en It and heart ".
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, UUiUbtK 2, lays.
strikes me a sudden sharp blow that makes my nerves
quiver strangely for a space. Before I crossed the bay
I had made a compact with the air in far-off San
Francisco that if this little girl, whom I never saw
and who never saw or heard of me or mine, would
write me certain words and sign them with a certain
name, I would at least believe that something beyond
herself made such a thing possible.
The words and name are there!
"They don't want to write much to-day," says
Viola, "they have got out of practice, but this," scrib
bling hastily and indicating the artist with a nod, "is
for you, though the others must see it."
We do see it and it says: "You had mutton chops,
baked potatoes and two big glasses of beer."
The mother laughs outright. "Viola has told," she
says, and the artist's face is a confession, grotesquely
blended with surprised mystification*
No one present but the artist himself knew what
he had eaten for dinner.
"My other control is coming now," declared the
child, "and you folks must look out or you'll get hurt."
She rose to her feet and started to put the pencil
and paper on the table. Half-way across the room
she dropped to the floor as if her legs were shot from
under her. The men sprang to her assistance and
found that they have entered into conflict with some
thing which seemed like nothing so much as a sen
tient "live wire." Viola is, as I have said, a slender
child even for her years, small-boned and thin, with
absolutely no perceptible muscular development what
ever, but one of her little sticks of arms proves too
much for a man to control though he exerted all his
strength in the effort. Gripped at wrist and above the
elbow by hands whose owner prides himself upon his
athletic prowess, the puny arm was twisted backward
and forward, and up and down, and around and around
as if it were a writhing snake, instead of a part of a
human body subservient to restrictions of joint and
bone and cartilage.
"Look out," she said again. "I shall hurt you if
you don't hold me tight. I can't help itâ it is too
strong for me, you see." And "it" is "strong" surely,
and she does "hurt" most decidedly, for she strikes
with her fists, and butts with her head, and kicks with
her feet, arid hammers with her knees, and bites with
her white little teeth, and pinches with her pretty
little fingers, anything and everywhere strikable, bStt
able, klckable, hammerable, bitable and pinchable
with which she is allowed to come in contact during
the next two hours.
"They throw me," she had explained previously,
and, strangely enough, all her movements seemed to
be actuated not from within but without. She struck
out with apparently no personal intention, but as if
some unseen and irresistibly strong person stood be-
Bide her and flung her hands at the person or thing
to be hit. She kicked in all directions in the same way
â as If her legs were thrown about by some external
force. She ran at us as if pus-hed violently, from be
hind. She beat herself, or, rather, was beaten, against
persons and floor and wall as if she were a rag doll
in the hands of a naughty child.
Prone on the floor, held down firmly by head
and shoulders and arms, with her mother sitting
solidly on her knees, she "trotted" that mother, baby
fashion, for a time and then shaking off her human
entanglements as easily as Samson of old broke the
withes, raised herself straight up to a sitting posture
as if pulled up by hands reaching down to her from
above.
Through it all her face had the expression of that
of a pleasantly interested spectator. She was per
fectly conscious of all that occurred and laughed when
some particularly hard experience brought words of
sympathy from the neophytes whom she was drag
ging merrily at>out as they endeavored to keep her
from doing them and herself bodily harm. She was
kept, too bu?y, however, to talk much, for Satan, or
something very much like him, found unbounded mis
chief for not only her hands but every member anfl
joint of her body to do. From a gentle, polite and
rather diffident child she seemed to have been meta
morphosed into a veritable imp as far as physical
manifestations were concerned.
Rolled in a comforter with her arms straight down
by her sides, made a pappoose bundle of by encircling
ropes, and laid to- the middle of a double bed, she
flung herself, or. rather, was flung, bodily from that
safe spot out upon the floor again. Tied in this way
she for the first time complained.
"Undo me, quick!" she said, "I am choking! It
gets me by the throat if you don't let. it work," and
we untied her hastily and let "it work(?)" as it would
subject as before to our united efforts .to keep the
child and ourselves from serious personal damage.
An hour of such occupation fo-und us all tired, dis
heveled and nearly deliquesced^ for the day was torrid
and utterly unsuited for a continuous series of muscur
lar exercise more severe and complicated than the
most enthusiastic Delsartian ever dreamed of.
Viola on the other hand was cool as- to her writhtng
little body, calm as to her pulse, and collected as to
her mind. Neither pulse nor temperature had- risen
in the least since we sat together on the doorstep and
petted Cuba between us.
We three strangers took her out into the open air,
out under God's sunshine among the trees, and vines
and away from all .other influences- physical and men
tal, and vainly tried to control the force that' possessed
her. She smiled up in our faces, but he-r body defied
our efforts to master it and did as- it would still in.
spite of us.
For an hour more the struggle" went on. It seemed
to us novices as if we had evolved an unseen Frank
enstein. ...
We were beaten and bruised and flung about, and
were forced to "spell" each other in order to get breath
and strength enough to act as. buffers between the girl
and her surroundings.
A little more than two hours after the "other con
trol" arrived on the scene Viola, stood straight and
quietly on her feet once more. .
"Good-by," she said gruffly, with an odd. ducking
motion of her head, and we realized in an instant that
she possessed herself once again and seemed' to be no
longer "possessed."
"Mamma," she said, going over to the pale little
woman who is no longer pale but rosy red," "let me .go
down to the station with you folks. It's only- a mile
and a half, and get tired staying up here- on the- hill
with nothing to do all day long."
And when we dragged ourselves wearily car-ward
that child danced along beside us every step of the
long, dusty way.

three score and ten, and though' bent' with tire weight
of his years is quite active, and told 'pome, interesting â¢

that bright record to his exceeding carefulness and
at not running his car at a high rate of speed. The
usual sign, "Do not jump off the car. while in motion, '
is displayed, a seemingly unnecessary caution, con
sidering the slowness of the motion.
The Utmost license prevails on this car. smoking ..

road is the mecca of small boys, who are allowed to
ride free by the generous proprietor, a condition of
this privilege being that when the car is going up

pushes, a condition faithfully carried out.
Mr. Prime is not of a grasping disposition, as most
monopolists are. He is satisfied with little, as the fol
lowing will show. Being asked one evening how busi

three passengers this morning and five this after
noon." These, at 20 cents each for the round trip,
would make his receipts just $1 60 for that day.18
SCHOONER SWALLOWED BY A MENDOCINO CAVE AND NO TRACE EVER FOUND OF IT
IN.! December, 1855, a vessel was
wrecked during one of the severe
storms which are common along
thi .'-.coast. The little ship broke
from. "her- moorings and drifted into
ah immense cave which leads from the
harbor, of -Mendocino in an easterly di
rection and ends â no man knoweth
â wlvre; : at any rate no vestige of the
.craft; was ever seen or hoard of from
. that day to this. Only three lives were
4tost,. but the story as told by an eye
â¢ witness is most intensely interesting.
. The- only person living who seems able
.to give 'iinytliing- like definite evidence
. is John Dougherty, a man of 80 years,
still a' resident of the little town. Ac
cording to his estimate â and he is one
..of' the few who were bold enough to
try anything in the way of an investi
gation as to the limit of this mysterious
'leaveâ it is on a line directly under the
course of the great earthquake and he
firmly believes that the cause of all this
disturbance is a. smoldering volcano
which has been trying to escape from
its prison for a- short vacation.
. It certainly is a fact that the vessel
was lost in the manner described below
and that no man returned to tell the
: tale. It is also true that the greatest
â¢damage done was in a line correspond
ing with the direction in which the cave
is supposed to run. Aside from its
earthquake connection the narrative is
Well' worth reading; one of those bits
of truth that seem almost strange
'.enough to rank with fiction.
Mr. Dougherty gives the following
â graphic description of the wreck: '

ing- straight for the bay. It was a
sight that would charm the eye of any
old sailor man, but we had no idea that
h.er master intended to make the port
and presumed he was only on a long
reach, with the intention of standing
off shore again on the next tack.
"We were soon undeceived on this
point, for the captain put up his helm
and sailed slap into the harbor. We
stood aghast at his effrontery and re
alized in a moment that he must be
a stranger to the roefcbound coast of
Mendocino or he would never have ta
ken such fearful chances. We soon
found that she was the schooner Har
riet, Captain Harris, a good old-fash
ioned New England skipper, who had
been taught in his youth to <">bey or
ders and break owners and his orders
were to carry a cargo of lumber for
the Mendocino Lumber Company to the
port of San Francisco, which he fully
intended to accomplish. The skipper,
as poon as he had moored his ship,
came ashore in his own boat and re
ported for orders to Mr. J. B. Ford, at
The Captain Stood Bravely at the b]e\rr\ With hjis Little Son, a Boy

that time superintendent for the lumber
company. Mr. Ford's advice to Har
ris was to get up his anchor with all
possible speed and put to sea without
delay.
" 'Oh, I don't know,' was the cap
tain's confident reply. 'I think I can
weather this all right.'
" 'But, my dear man,' said Mr. Ford,
'you have no idea of what in in store
for you. We are on the eve of one of
the heavy winter stotms and the vessel
was never yet built that can live
through a genuine sou'easter in this
port, especially with the insecure moor
ing facilities which are the very best
we have to offer. You 'git.' Don't
stand <m the ceremony of going, but
go just as quick as the Lord will let
you.'
"Captain Harris seemed to realize
now that the matter was somewhat se
rious and pulled off to his ship at once
to make preparations for sea. During
the- interval the wind had risen and
things were becoming lively; the
schooner was tugging vigorously at her
Singufar Occurrences in the County Wfiere There have
Lately Been 60 Many Earthquakes.
hawser and the mate had placed chaf
ing gear along the rail and through the
hawse pine in order to save the lines
from cutting if possible. In the mean
time the sea was becoming more ugly
every minute; the wind assumed the
proportion of a real live gale; every
thing was snapping and cracking
aboard the brave little craft, and from
where we stood ashore, with the wind
in our favor, we could plainly hear the
voice of the mate, as he ripped and
swore about his orders not being exe
cuted rapidly enough.
"With considerable difficulty Captain
Harris at last reached his ship. He
was as cool as a cucumber, but with
the aid of our glasses we could see
that his face was ashen, and his mouth
firmly set with the determination of a
man who meets danger and death when
duty calls without flinching.
"The moorings of the little bay are
very good as far as they go. There
is a heavy wrought cable, one of the
largest ever made in England â it is still
in useâ and is firmly ring-bolted to the
rocks on either side of the harbor, but
its weakness lies in the leg-chains, to
which the puo s are made fast. They
are of ordinary anchor chain, and un
der a heavy tug are very apt to give
â way.
"Well, as we stood breathlessly wait
ing and watching to see what might
happen next a huge comber came surg
ing over the south reef and struck the
Harriet full astern. Snap went the
leg-chain, to which her bow line was
fastened, and she spun around like a
teetotum. Now things were lively and
every able bodied man ashore grabbed
for a life line and made for the oppo
site side of the bay to lend a hand at
rescue to the brave men who had bat
tled so tenaciously to preserve their
ship.
"We all realized that nothing could
possibly save the Vessel, and devoted
our entire energies to the human be
ings, whose lives were hanging by a
thread, as it were. Each moment In
creased the peril of those poor fellow*
â and I tell you it was a trying thing
to stand helplessly by and feel that
you were powerless to do anything to
save the poor souls almost within
stone's throw from the shore. The
next big wave parted the leg-chain to
which the stern line was fast, and this
left the poor ship at the mercy of the
cruel sea.
"She soon began to drift toward the
south shore in the direction of the
great cave, which Is known by the not
very euphoneous title of the 'blow
hole.' Many a helpless craft has drift
ed about the bay before, and many
have done so since, but this is the first
and last instance where anything
afloat took this course. In fact, it
seems very strange that such a thing
could happen, for you must know that
the wind and waves during the winter
storms all come from the southeast,
and there seems no good reason why
everything should not drift toward the
north, but for some cause which no
man can explain this vessel took a
southerly course and made direct for
the fatal 'blowhole.'
"We hurried to the bluff over the cave
and arrived just in time to witness the
first crash of the foremast against the
ceiling of the cavern. It sounded like
the report of a cannon, and the re
bound carried the Harriet back fifty
fathoms into the open bay. The mast
was broken off just below the cross
piece. The topmast and a splintered
portion of the mast itself were left
dangling in the shrouds. ! After a few
moments spent in breathless anxiety
by ub of the rescuing party, another
smashing big swell struck the vessel
astern and once more she was driven
back into the yawning mouth of the
hungry cavern.
"With our life lines hanging over, the
bluff we waited patiently for some sig
nal from below to hoist away. The
spray was flying so thick we could only
get an occasional sight of the ship.
Soon there was a heavy tug at one of
the lines and a hail from tbe deck of
the ill-fated ship told us to hoist away,
which we did with a will. The head of
the mate soon appeared above the bank
with a rope fast just beneath his arm
pits. We landed him on the bank with
out comment and renewed our atten
tion to those below.
"In a similar manner we rescued all
but three of the ship's company. The
three that were lost were the captain,
his little son and the cook â whatever
became of that cook we were never able
to ascertain.
"The captain stood bravely at the
helm with hi little son, a boy only
twelve years old, and lifte Casablanca
in the poem, that little chap refused
to desert his father's ship, but stood
there like a hero and went to his mys
terious death without a whimper.
"As the wind blew the spray in an
other direction, making it possible for
us to see the deck below, we called in
vain to Captain Harris to make him
self and his little boy fast to one of the
lines that we might drag him up as we
FROM April 1 almost up to the present time earth
quake shocks have been almost daily occurrences all
along the coast of Mendocino County, but more par
ticularly severe in the immediate vicinity of Mendo
cino City and on a line running east from that town
toward Ukiah.
Through the months of April, May and June from one
to ten shocks were felt daily, some of them very severe.
Trees were hurled to the ground, windows broken and
scarcely a brick chimney was left standing in the many
small towns along the coast. The good people of these
places became so much alarmed that many of them carried
their children into the open streets, where they remained
about camp flies, wrapped in blankets, for nights, awaiting
the final crack of doom. The road which leads from Men
docino to Ukiah was impassable for weeks at a time, m lic
ing the carrying and delivery of mails an impossibility,
even when the pony express was resorted to. The ground
opened and the huge fissures in some instances were not
closed for days. Great redwood trees, six and eight feet
in diameter, filled the canyons to such an extent that
travel was practically suspended.
Miss Olive Fry of Ukiah says the death rate would have
been much greater than at Charleston during the great
earthquake there had the country been more densely popu
lated. Crockery and glassware were destroyed in most of
the houses from one end of the country to the other.
Along the course of the Navarro River the disturbance
is very noticeable. At one point the whole side of a moun
tain slid into the gulch below like an Alpine avalanche. The
little watercourse was dammed up to such an extent that
large lake has been formed, which from all appearance
is to remain a permanent fixture. In many places min
eral sorings have made their appearance, some hot, some
cold with sulphur and iron predominating. Each heavy
shock was preceded by deafening reports like heavy ar
tillery or thunder during one of the summer storms in New

did his companions, but he refused
point blank to leave his ship as long
as she held together.
"The last we saw of that brave man
he stood with one hand on a spoke of
the wheel and with his other arm fond
ly embracing his son's waist, disap
peared forever from our view- We
waited all night with the hope that on
the turn of the tide the vessel might
possibly drift into the bay, but we never
saw so much as a bit of her planking
again. She had gone into the blow hole
and her destination will ever remain
a mystery.

mustered up courage and took a surf

California Will Supply Over One-Quarter of the New Powder Used
by th>e Government.
t N all probability our navy has fought its last war with black pow-

supplying the alcohol, for $800,000. and to begin delivery on October

California offers to supply one-quarter of the whole amount, the Gov

could obtain a sufficient number
of old white shirts and other gar
ments they would prefer to
make every ounce of the order from
them!
It has been found during the experi
ments of the past few months that old
cotton goods, commonly called "linert,"
make the most perfect quality
of smokeless powder, and the. powder
companies are busily searching
through ev-ry known channel to pro
cure the needed quantities of this kind
of material. . . .
At the works at Pinole there are
sacks of old cotton which has been torn
into strips and cleansed for the pur
pose of making the very latest kind
of smokeless powder. Sacks by the
hundred, sacks by the thousand, sacks
by the tens of thousandâ old shirts by

we had nothing but ordinary lanterns

so laborious that we were obliged to

"All that now remains of the wreck
of the Harriet is a little headboard

of the brave shipmaster who met his
death while in the discharge of his

a warship is neither intricate nor com
paratively expensive and yet but sixty
years have elapsed since the discov
ery was made that rendered such a
transition possible. It was in 1838 that
Pelouse observed that when cotton
fabric or paper was immersed in cold
concentrated nitric acid for a short
time, the free acid being subsequently
removed by washing, these materials
became without important alter
ation of structure converted into
substances possessed of high ex
plosive properties. A little later
Knop introduced the more ad
vantageous method of treating the
cotton woo] with a mixture of .nitric
and sulphuric acid, and from that date
on various chemical experiments and
discoveries have been made until it is
now believed that the point has been
reached where this dangerous material
is of the highest explosive power possi

While these researches were being
conducted it was almost as important
to learn how to handle for the pur

substances as to develop their power.

OLD "Reel Foot," the big grizzly,

Reel Foot was the most noted
bear that ever made foot prints
across the trails of Northern California.

For twenty years Reel Foot tended
strictly to warfare, and was the terror
of stockmen, hunters and small child
ren. That he is dead is due to the nerve
of John CopÃejr, the tallest man in Lake
County and. the. best shot. But death
came only after one of the toughest
fights that Reel. Foot ever gave in his
protracted life as a marauder and out

thought nothing of going into a raneh

that he 'killed a man's horse and ate
him while the man hung in the tree

beat Herniann catching rifle balls and
afterward devouring his assailant, the
fact that Copsey, after years of watch

back many years ago, to the time when

he was on-- one of his marauding ex

There was no alternative but for
Craddock to jump and run for his life.
Lack of more good hounds and the
formidable -isk of going after the brute
without them deterred the Chllds \ al
ley settlers from following up the ad
vantage gained by Craddock. Bruin,
therefore, had time to get well of his
wound and to inaugurate a campaign
of revenge. Bear though he was, he
seems to have had a little Machiavelli
in him. At least the death list of the
sheep cotes of the district during the
next few months tells %uch a story.
About three months after the fight
with Craddock bruin turned loose on a
Pope Valley hogpen. The size and
strength of the pen made no difference
to him. The pickets of the lnclosure
were from four to six inches thick and
were nailed on with bridge-timber
spikes. Bruin swept these away as if
they were the flesh on a man's shoulder
and sat him down in the midst of the
squealing porkers until his belly was
made full and his lust of retaliation for
the Childs Valley outrage on his foot
was fully satisfied.
It so happened that the owner of this
pen, Jurd Walters, was a veteran
"bar" hunter. He took the depredator's
trail quickly and with a gang of men
followed bruin north for three daya
until he dropped out of sight in the
neighborhood of Bartlett Springs in
Lake County, probably hiding in an old
cave. A cave which apparently had
been the bear's headquarters for many
years was subsequently located in that
vicinity by a man named Thorp, the
discoverer of Bartlett Springs.
Tracking bruin was easy on this oc
casion. The wound from Craddock's
gun had not only lamed him, but had
given a peculiar outward twist to his
right foot so that the toes turned al
most at a right angle to those of the
left foot. This unusual mark gave the
big brute the name of "Reel Foot,"
and by that name he was known
throughout the balance of his extra
ordinary career.
During the chase Reel Foot took his
course directly across the Guenoc
ranch, which has since become famous
as the stock farm of Fred Gebhard.
Lily Langtry owns the next ranch.
Here the bear seized oneof the papooses
of the tribe of the Lake County In
dian chief. Chappo, which had been
left <>n the bank of Putah Creek while
the mother was washing clothes in the
stream.
Chappo's tribe was in a state of wild
excitement by the time Walters' gang
arrived, and the aged and grizzled
chief (who still lives at the advanced
.â¢leje of 120 years) offered six of his
ch"irpst squaws and two ponies to any
white man who would kill the bear.
ChappÂ° and his tribe, of course, joined
in the chase.
Hut Reel Foot evidently had been in
that part of the country before. He
disappeared in the brush back of the
Copsey ranch, brush which nothing but
a snake or a bear could penetrate.
Nevertheless Walters pressed the es

SOUTH of the port of Kiaochau, in China, lies the broad valley of the
Yangtse-Klang. It is in the heart of this valley, at Han Kow, that
Mr. Brice's company will begin the construction of a railway to run al
most directly south to Canton and thence to the sea coast opposite
Hongkong. There will be 900 miles of road with such branches as trade
seems to demand and there will be tributary to it a country having a pop
ulation of 200,000,000. Two of the provinces through which it runs contain
80,000,000 peopleâ more than the population of the United States.
The chief engineer of the new company will be an American. It la
probable most of the capital for the road will be furnished by Americans
and that American locomotives will haul American cars over American
rails through the heart of China in the near future. The road will be ope
rated by the American syndicate in conjunction with the Imperial Depart
ment of Railroads for four or five years. Its future is then uncertain. It
may pass wholly into the hands of the Chinese Government, or it may
become the property of a foreign company. Whatever the ownership or
control, it will serve to open up a trade in American food products and
manufactured goods among 200,000,000 people.

English interests are combined with

Chinese labor is the cheapest to be had;
and, second, because the employment
of natives will dispose the Chinese peo

been greater than they could meet.
The Government of China wants rail
roads. It wants both railroads and
telegraphs, because it knows that by
their aid revolution can be prevented
or subdued. President Diaz has main
tained himself as President of Mexico
all these years because the country is
covered with railroads and telegraph
lines. It used to be that if a revo
lution started In a remote part of the
country it was two or three weeks per
haps before the Government heard of
It, and as much longer before troops
could be sent to put down the upris
ing. Now if revolution is planned, the
Government knows it within an hour t
and in a day it can have troops on hand
to suppress it. The Chinese have fre
quent uprising's in different parts of
the great empire. They realize that
by the aid of the railroad and the tele
graph they can uphold their authority.
The proposed railroad from Canton to
Han Kow, combined with the railroad
which the Belgians are to build from
Han Kow to Peking, will give the Gov
ernment a means of Inland communi
cation, bringing the principal points In
the empire in close touch with each
other, but so remote from the sea as to
be protected from attack by any of
China's enemies.
Han Kow, which will be one terminus
of the road. Is 700 miles from the coast
on the Yangtse-Kiang River. That
stream is navigable practically all the
year round for vessels drawing forty

steam vessels navigate the upper
waters and the branch streams and
reach a vast territory. The valley is
not only populous, but fertile, and it
will furnish an Immense business for
the new road.
I do not believe there is any danger
in the partition of China, and that we
may lose our concession through that
means. No country wants to pick a
quarrel with the United States.
As the railroad work advances and
the people of the country see what our
people eat and wear they are going to
want it. They use a great deal of our
oil in China. They are going to use
more, and so the Standard Oil Company
is with us in this enterprise. They are
groing to want sugar, and so the Amer
ican Sugar Refining Company is with
us. They are going to want coffee, and
so the Arbuckle Coffee Company is
with us.
The way to build up trade is to create
a desire for the things you have to sell.
How many years has it been since no
man in the United States thought of
spending $100,000 a year? Less than
twenty years ago that condition ex
ited. To-day there are so many men
spending that sum that you cannot
keep track of them. They have no so
cial standing and their names you have
probably never heard. We have got to
go to China and show the people what
they should want to eat and wear.

membering the experience of Craddock,
were a little shy of going too deep into
the brush after the bear, but Church
and young Copsey had Lake County's
reputation to maintain, and plunged
straight ahead.
Church never came back.
Copsey was o"nly a boy at that time,
but he understood the nature of an
oath, as do most Lake County boys to
this day. When finally the mangled
remains of Church were drawn out,
which was after Reel Foot had finished
his meal and had abandoned the body,
Copsey swore that if he had to nve
twenty years to do it he would make
an end of Reel Foot as Reel Foot had
made an end of Church.
Thereafter Reel Foot's history was
written in the blood of Lake, Sonoma,
Mendocino and lower Trinity counties.
He had fights, he ate sheep, pork, dogs
andÂ»men and children in all these coun
ties, and usually got away from the
Sheriff as adroitly as Chris Evans or
the notorious sneak thief of Middle
town, George Coburn. The hunting an â¢
nals of all these four counties are. full
of the pursuit of Reel Foot. His pe
culiar footprint gave him distinction,
and his reputation as a man-eater
made him a good subject for barroom
stories.
In Round Valley, where White's no
torious band of vaqueros held out for
many years, Reel Foot made a great
record in absorbing bullets fired at him
and fighting back all the while.
He killed a foreman on White's
ranch in an encounter in a cabin,
where the latter had gone to seek a
supply of bacon. It was in the winter
season and foraging was poor. Reel
Foot broke open the door at night, and
while the foreman was asleep on the
floor began pillaging the place. The
foreman awoke startled, and reached
for his gun. What else he did is not
known. Reel Foot never gave him a
chance to tell. The poor fellow's torn
carcass was found by some of White's
men several days later.
From Round Valley, Reel Foot seems
to have wandered back and forth to his
old hunting grounds in Pope Valley.
It was only a few years ago that he
made an assault on a sheep herder em
ployed by John Adams of Pope Valley,
who happened to be out in the field
with his young son. The son climbed

own father killed and partly devoured
by the ferocious beast.
Much of this history reads like the
yellow-back literature that starts the
youth of New York westward to grow
up with the country, but there are
plenty of people in the four or five
counties herein mentioned to verify it.
For example, there is Charlie Sapp,
who, unmindful of the Craddock inci
dent in Reel Foot's early biography,
still lingers among the woods of Lake
County and hunts bears with a breech
loading rifle. He has probably killed
ship steel rails to England and sell
them in competition with English steel
makers we no longer need protection.
Whether the protective system was ever
a good one will always be a disputed
point. That the law was unjust there
is no doubt. Every tax law is. You
cannot please every one.
What we need now is not a tariff
which will keep out foreign goods; we
have filled our home markets. We need
a market for our surplus production.
The place to find it is on the Pacific,
where 400,000,000 people are awaiting
civilization. Our trade future lies to
the west. With our seven or eight
great transcontinental lines, we can
reach the Western seaboard quickly;
and along the Pacific Coast is going to
develop a sfci- building interest which
will eclipse TOat of New England in the
brightest days of the industry. We are
going to ship our products to China and
find a distributing agent for them in
that vast empire over an American
railroad.
Less than a year ago capitalists in
this country would not have considered
an investment in China. One conces
sion was granted to an American, but
it was revoked because he had not the
capital to carry out its terms. Dewey's

perhaps on account of age. Being dis

However that may t>e, it is a fact

in Lake County, discovered the. famil

on hi.s ranch. It was the. 'work of an

seemed to be mutual; at least, so says
Copsey. John dropped his rifle to his
shoulder and fired. But that Sort of

had been through it before and he
didn't mind lead in the least. The bul

UNITED STATESREADY TO BUILD THE GREAT NICARAGUA CANAL.
Hew Plans Just Reported by tfye
Commission T^at .Has Been
Overhauling tl?e Work,.
NEW YORK, Oct. Lâ Eight Government engineers who have been en
gaged on the preliminary survey of the Nicaragua canal have arrived
in this city on the steamer Altai of the Atlas Line. The preliminary
â¢ Work was iir.ished before the party left the field and a vast amount of data,
the results of surveyings, boring's and surroundings, has been brought back
and will i in the official reports, which will bo placed before Con
ssion. The surveys show that the proposed canal is
. ' entirely fi asible and that the cost will be considerably less than the esti
mates made by the Ludlow commission or the sum named by Admiral
V year ag<> as likely to be needed. The reduction in cost is due to
â¢ a change in the location of the Ochoa dam and to other modifications of
.the old route.
The Ludlow commission estimated the cost of the canal at $133,000,000.
.'â  Adn:: r named $125,000,000 as the aggregate cost. The report of the
'engineers will place the estimate at less than $100,000,000.
By changing the location of the dam from Ochoa to a point fourteen
" , miles wn the building of the San Juan basin and its costly em
bankment can be avoided and a saving of $10,000,000 made.
Chief Engineer Bben Wheeler and other members of the return
ing party say their reports will show that the canal is a project contain
ing no serious difficulty and that it can be quickly and cheaply built. It is
.. " two years now since any actual work has been done on the canal by the
â  company of which Warner Miller is the head. The concession obtained
by the company from the Nicaragua Government is said to still hold good.
The attempt to build the canal by private means has been abandoned by
." Mr. Miller and his associates and all rights in the premises have been of
â¢ fered to the Government.
A syndicate of Chicago capitalists, headed by E. F. Cragln, has looked
over the ground and it Is now said to be endeavoring to obtain a con
â¢ cession from Nicaragua. Mr. Cragin and a party of civil engineers and
â contractors from Chicago have recently returned from the isthmus and are
sa!d to be interesting members of Congress in their plans. The statisti
cians have placed the volume of the commerce that is likely to pass
through the canal much higher than the estimates of the Government, and
â¢ their opinion is that the revenue to be derived will warrant them in spend
ing considerably more than $100,000,000 in building the canal.
THE speedy building of the
Nicaragua canal, which now
seems assured, will signalize a
new commercial epoch in the his
tory of the world.
It is a somewhat remarkable
coincidence that, just at this time,
when the Spaniards are removing the
' bones of Christopher Columbus from
. Havana to Madrid, thus formally
. marking the close of their long career
of bloody conquests, merciless control
and final decadence in the Western
Hemisphere, the Americans, who 'are
now enjoying the fruits of Colum
...bus' discoveries, should so suddenly
develop an irresistible expansive
energy*, prompting them to prepare a
mighty armada of modern ships, to be
â sent forth through a new waterway, to
make sweeping conquests in the world

SIR WILLIAM CROOKES, presi

annual address by setting forth
that the civilized nations of the

Sir William Crookes stands in the
forefront of modern scientists. He is
the inventor of the famous Crookes

The details of the impending catastro

direction is obvious enough. Should all
the wheat-growing countries add to their
area to the iitni<>.-;i capacity, on the most
careful calculation the yield would give
us only an addition of some 100.00u.000
acres, supplying at the average world
yield of 12.7 bushels to the acre 1,270,000.-
DOO bushels, just enough to Buppy the in
crease of population among bread eaters
till the year' 1931. At the present time
there exists a deficit in the wneat urea
of 31,000 square milesâ a deficit masked
by the fact that the ten world crops of
wheat harvested in the ten years ending
1896 were more than 5 per cent above the
average of the previous twenty-six years.
When provision shall have been made, if
possible, to feed 230,000,000 units likely to
be added to the bread-eating populations
by 1931â by the complete occupancy of fhe
arable areas of the temperate zone now
partially occupiedâ where can be grown

not to be compared to the giant ridge
which obstructs the route across Pana

My investigations of the Nicaragua
canal route clearly convinced me that
it was destined to be the chosen one for
an Inter-oceanic canal. It does not re

the comparative merits of the Nicara

trip over the ground at both places is
sufficient to settle all doubts.

The Crime of the Municipalities.
It is now recognized that all crops re
quire what Is called a "dominant" ma
nure. Some need nitrogen, some potash,
others phosphates. Wheat pre-eminently
demands nitrogen, fixed In the form of
ammonia or nitric acid. All other neces
sary constituents exist in the soil; but
nitrogen is mainly of atmospheric origin,
and is rendered "fixed" by a slow and
precarious process which requires a com
bination of rare meteorological and geo
graphical conditions to enable it to ad
vance at a sufficiently rapid rate to be
come of commercial importance. There
are sevoral sources of available nitrogen.
The distillation of coal in the process of
pas-making- yields a certain amount of
nitrogen in the form of ammonia â¢ â¢ â¢
but all Europe does not yield more than
400,000 annual tons. For a long time guano
has been one of the most important
sources of nitrogenous manures, but
guano deposits are so near exhaustion
that they may be dismissed from consid
eration. * * â¢ There is still another and
invaluable source of fixed nitrogen â I
mean the treasure locked up in the sew
age and drainage of our towns. Individ
ually the amount so lost is trifling, but
multiply the loss by the number of in
habitants, and we have the startling fact
that in the United Kingdom we art- inn
tent to hurry down our drains and water
courses, into the Bea, tixed nitrogen to
the value of no less than Â£10.000,000 per

Into corn. Of this barbaric waste of ma
nurtal constituents Liebig nearly half a
cntury ago, wrote in these prophetic
words: "Nothing will more certainly con
summate the ruin of England than a
scarcity of fertilizers â it means a scarcity
of food. It is impossible that such a sin
ful violation of the divine laws of nature
should forever remain unpunished; and
the time will probably come for England
eooner than any other country when, with
river San Juan, where considerable
dredging will be necessary. The re

being deep enough for all purposes.

So much for the outline of construc
tion. The story of the trials and vi
cissitudes which have overtaken the
various combinations which have
sought to construct the "canal would
fill several large volumes. The moot
recent and notable attempt to con
struct the great waterway was made
by the Maritime Canal Company of
New York, presided over by Hiram
Hitchcock and operating through the
Nicaragua Canal Construction Com
pany, managed by ex-Senator Warner
Miller of New York. This company of
capitalists began active operations In
April, 1887, when the Nicaragua Canal
Association secured from the Nlcara
guan Government a concession to build
a waterway.
Surveys for It began in December of
the same year. In February, 1889, Con-

more surely and quickly will the finite
stocks of nitrogen locked up in the soils
of the world become exhausted.
The Exhaustion of the Stock of Fixed
Nitrogen.
The store of nitrogen in the atmosphere
is practically unlimited but it is fixed and
rendered assimilable by plants only by
cosmic processes of extreme slowness.
The nitrogen which, with a light heart,
we liberate in a battleship broadside has
taken millions of minute organisms pa
tiently working for centuries to win from
the atmosphere. The only available com
pound containing sufficient fixed nitrogen
to be used on a world-wide scale as a
nitrogenous manure is nitrate of soda, or
Chile saltpeter. The nitrate fields of Chile
have bertme of vast commercial impor
tance, and promise to be of inestimably
greater value in the future. * â¢ â¢ The
exhaustion of the world's stock of fixed
nitrogen means not only a catastrophe
little short of starvation for the wheat
eaters, but directly, scarcity for those
who exist on inferior grains, together
with a lower standard of living for meat
eaters, scarcity of mutton and beef, and
even the extinction of gunpowder!
Nitrate Needs and Expenditure.
Experiments have proved that 22.86
pounds of nitrate of soda produced an in
crease of one bushel of wheat. At this
rate, to Increase the world's crop of wheat
by 7.3 bushels, about !*& cwt. of nitrate of
soda must annually be applied to each
acre. The amount required to raise the
world's crop on 163,000,000 acres from the
present supply of 2,070,000.000 bushels to
the required 3,260,000,000 bushels will be
12,000,000 tons distributed In varying
amounts over the wheat-growing coun
tries of the world. It is difficult to get
trustworthy estimates of the amount of
nitrate surviving in the niter beds. Com
mon rumor declares the supply to be in
exhaustible, but cautious local authorities
state that at the present rato of export,
â¢of over one million tons per annum, the
raw material "caliche," contiiining from
25 to 50 per cent nitrate, will be exhausted
in from twenty to thirty years. If we
assume a liberal estimate for nitrate ob
tnined from the lower grade deposit, and
say that it will equal in quantity that
from the richer quality, the supply may
last, possibly, fifty years, at the rate of a
million tons a year; bur at ihe rate re
quired to augment the world's supply of
wheat to the point demanded thirty years

gress granted a charter to the Mari
time Canal Company to construct this
canal, with $100,000,000 capital and the
right to Increase the same to $200,000,
000. In May, ISS9, the incorporation or
ganized. The Construction Company
was an immediate outgrowth, under
taking to do the necessary work for the
Maritime Company.
Active operations on the canal began
in 1890, following preliminary surveys.
Harbor improvements of a costly char
acter were made at Greytown, a rail
road was built for ten miles back from
the Atlantic sea coast through a
swamp, preparatory to conveying ma
chinery and supplies to Interior points
along the line of the canal. Large and
costly dredges were purchased at a
fancy price from the representatives of
the "defunct Panama Canal Company,
and the digging of the great inter
oceanic ditch was fairly begun by the
middle of 1892. The dredges easily
scooped out the loose deposits of sand
and loam near Greytown and the canal
began to slowly lengthen out like a
gigantic serpent toward the far distant
Pacific.
But just at this period a financial
crisis overtook the Construction Com
pany, and it was compelled to virtually
suspend operations. In vain did the
eloquent ex-Senator Miller go from city
to city, calling public meetings and en
deavoring with all of the arts at his
command to interest capitalists and se-
years. For years past we have been
spending fixed nitrogen at a culpably ex
travagant rate, heedless of the fact that
it is tixed with extreme slowness and dif
ficulty, while its liberation in the frea
state takes place alwuys with rapidity
end sometimes with explosive violence.
One of the "Great Discoveries
Awaiting Chemists."
There Is a gleam of light amid this
darkness of despondency. In Its free
state nitrogen is one of the most abun
dant and pervading bodies on the face of
the earth. Every square yard of the
earth's surface has nitrogen gas press
ing down on it to the extent of about
seven tons; but this is in the free state,
and wheat demands it fixed. To convey
this idea in an object lesson I may tell
you that, previous to its destruction by
fire Colston Hall, measuring 146 feet by 80
feet, contained twenty-seven tons weight
of nitrogen in its atmosphere. It also
contained one-third of a ton of argon. In
the free gaseous state this nitrogen is
worthless; combined in the form of ni
trate of soda it would be worth about
Â£2000. For years past attempts have been
made to effect the fixation of atmospheric
nitrogen, and some of the processes have
met with sufficient partial success to
warrant experimentalists in pushing their
trials still further; but I think I am right
in saying that no process has yet been
brought to the notice of scientific or com
mercial men which can be considered suc
cessful either as regards cost or yield
of product. The fixation of atmospheric
nitrogen, therefore, is one of the great
discoveries awaiting the ingenuity of
chemists.
Nitrate From Niagara.
The fixation of nitrogen is vital to the
progress of civilized humanity, and is a
question of the not far distant future.

became somewhat responsive. What
would have happened no man knows,
but just at this juncture the war with

famous trip around the Horn and the
building of the canal became a cer

In 'the protection of the coast line, but

situation. The ship building firms of
the country are to-day overwhelmed
with orders for sea-going craft.
It is -tinent to consider the espe
cial advantages which will accrue to
San Francisco and California from the
construction of the canal.
These advantages will be more far
reaching than is generally supposed.
Not only will thÂ« coast cities of the
Atlantic be brought some ten thousand
miles closer by water, with a corre
sponding cheapening In the costs of
freights, amounting to more than one
half on grains and other products in
bulk but San Francisco will become a
natural port of entry for thousands of
ships of all nations using the canal to
carry on American, Asiatic and British
Columbian trade. The facts werewell
put by William L. Merry of San Fran
cisco, In a communication to the C ali
fornia Bankers' Magazine. He said:
When the canal subject was first In
troduced to the people of this coast 1*
1880 the growing interest of the agrlcul
nitric acids. This inconsiderable experi
ment may not unlikely lead to the de
velopment of a mighty industry destined
to solve the great food problem. Nitrate
can be produced artificially by the com
bustion of the atmosphere. Here .we
come to finality in â¢ one direction"; our
stores are inexhaustible. But how about
electricity? Can we generate enough
energy to produce 12,000,000 tons of nitrate
of soda annually? A preliminary calcu
lation shows that there need be no fear
on that score; Niagara alone is capable
of supplying the required electric energy
without much lessening its mighty flow..
The future can take care of itself. The
artificial production of nitrate is clearly
within view, and by its aid the land de
voted to wheat can be brought up to the
thirty bushels per acre standard. In days
to come, when the demand may again
overtake supply, we may safely leave our
successors to grapple with the stupendous
food problem. .

world to telegraph to the railroad au

can be made at a profit. This plan is
In force with regard to all California
fruits, and since its adoption the trade
has been steadier and more satisfac
tory all around than ever it was be
fore. '
New York is by all odds the best
city in the United States so far as the
orange trade is concerned. It con
sumes nearly twice as many in a year
;i s Boston, the next heaviest consumer,
and double the number that are dis
posed of in Chicago. After Chicago
comes Philadelphia, then Baltimore
and then St. Louis, with the other cit
ies trailing after almost exactly in the
order of their population. New York
also furnishes the steadiest orange
market. The reception of a few extra
carloads will demoralize prices fear
fully in any other city, but the demand
in New York is so heavy and steady
that prices in its auction rooms have
rarely been depressed below a fairly
satisfactory level, no matter how large
the supply of the fruit.
It may seem strange to the reader
that Chicago and Philadelphia each
consume fewer oranges than Boston, a
smaller city than either, but the reason
is simple, as explained by W. K. Miller
of New York, an expert in the trade.
Both Chicaeo and Philadelphia are un
usually partial to bananas, and both I
enjoy exceptional facilities for getting
themâ Chicago through New Orleaus, !
the country's trr. at entrepot for that j
fruit, and Philadelphia direct from the
Wesi Indian Islands, whence most ba
- eaten In the United States are
obtained. When oranges are high
bananas go as well in either Chicago >
or Philadelphia, but this i<= not so in
New York.
It may be said in passing that the
ff-ars expressed before the beginning of
the Spanish war that hostilities would
dÂ« moralize the banana trade have not
been borne out by the facts. It is in
a thoroughly flourishing condition, and
has been all summer long. Cargoes i
of bananas are being received with :
great regularity at all the chief sea- I
ports.
The number of oranges in a box va
ries from 176 to 296. Two hundred is
probably a fair average, and the total
output of California oranges may
therefore not be far from 1,100,000,000
this year. That is almost an unthink
able number, yet If all the California
oranges offered for sale were distrib
uted impartially among men, women.
children and babies in the United
States th^y would receive only fourteen

boxes they are shipped in, though, 1,
100,000.000 oranges would make a pile
two and a quarter times as high and
of rather more than twice the diameter
of the monument to Washington at the
national capital.
The importation of foreign oranges,
once a big item of commerce between
the United States and the Mediterra
nean ports, has virtually been wiped
out by the combined influence of the
present tariff and the enormous Cali

GOOD STORIES OF ENGLISHMEN
OF FIFTY YEARS AGO
Here is a story of the fifth Duke of
Bedford:
â¢'One night at Newmarket he lost a
colossal sum at hazard, and, Jumping
up in his passion, he swore that the
dice were loaded, put them in his
pocket and went to bed. Next morning
he examined the dice in the presence
of his boon companions, found that
they were not loaded, and had to apolo
gize and pay. Some years afterward
one of the party was lying on his
deathbed, and he sent for the Duke.
'I have sent for you to tell you that you
were right. The dice were loaded. We
waited until you were asleep, went to
your bedroom, took them out of your
waistcoat pocket, replaced them with
unloaded ones, and retired.'
" 'But suppose I had woke and
caught you doing it?"
" "Well, we were desperate men â and
we had pistols.' "
Such were the manners of high so
ciety. As for the morals, such things
as morals were not for the great.

"Well, sing it for mother, then," and,

"We'll hang Jeff Davis to a sour

When she was told that "Jeff Davis"
was her own papa, for whom she pray

i and sobbed till she was ill.
The newspapers were full of accounts

Shortly after this Mrs. Dorsey, an ard

his famous triumphal tour through the

by his daughter. It has been said that
he was received somewhat coldly at
first, but that the Ineffable charm of
Winnie's personality captivated the
country. She was the sweet attraction
of all his journeyings, and everywhere
there were outpourings, ovations and
welcomes.

people called for Mr. Davis to appear

At this juncture General Gordon,

scene. It has become history. From

Cranks Who Haunt the Courts
In Search of Big Fortunes
The Insanity Commission Gathers Them In, but the Supply Seems
Inexhaustible.
FRANCISZKA SUCHORZYNS
KA, who tried to kill Judge Cof
fey of the Probate Court the
other day, is not the only crank
that ever haunted the gloomy
corridors of the City Hall bent on ob
taining wealth >hat existed only in the
recesses of disordered minds. There
were many others. A majority are now
in the madhouse and in their waking
hours count imaginary piles of gold or
rave that the *.iercenary world without
has appropriated their wealth and
locked them in a living tomb. A few
are left and unmolested pursue phan
tom fortunes, but they, too, may worry
patience until the law steps in and
adjudges that henceforth they must be
deprived of freedom.
Mrs. Suchorzynska, through her as
sault on Judge Coffey, is the last to
come into pror-inenee. Judge Coffey is
unfortunate in that he is considered
by this unique person gifted with ab
solute power to adjust the wrongs of
the universe. That he has failed to do
so is due solely to indifference is the
opinion of -.rs. Suchorzynska and he
is thus unpopular with the woman of
largely developed eccentricities.
Mrs. Suchorzynska and her husband,
Frank, have both occupied cells in the
Agnews asylu* and It was after their
release that they began to add to the
woes of Probate Judge Coffey. The
court ap^ointe 1 guardians for the es
tates of the insane people during their
confinement and signed the document
restoring them to capacity. When the
couple learned this they looked upon
the Judge as Infallible and made many
unwelcome calls at his courtroom. A
disturbance generally followed the ap
pearance of the couple and especially
if the worr.an managed to elude her
husband ar 1 call without an escort or
chaperon. Then she would invariably
fall into the clutches of the police and
go to jail or suffer immediate ejection
from "the hall of courts. Repeated
warnings to keep away made but little
impression on her and again a prison
door has been bolted behind her.
Another of the mentally wealthy who
created an exciting scene in the hall
last April is ' 'own by the name of
Wynkonp. Early in the month he
wandered into the County Clerk's of
fice and after a casual survey of his
surroundings approached the probate
department desk and addressed the
clerk:
"Wynkoop is my name," he said,
"James D. Wynkoop, and in me you see
a descendant of revolutionary stock.
My name wasn't always Wynkoop, but
that is my business, none of yours, sir.
My forefathers were revolutionary sol
diers and for their gallantry had land
s rip issued to them. Some of it was
floated in California. My share is right
here in this city and I tell you I will
find it if I have to search for it until
lam a dea one."
This statement made little im
pression on the clerk. He had
listened to such tales before and he
failed to enthuse. The old man finally
became violent and as he was led away
he was heard to mutter: "Born of
revolutionary stock, but now cast
among thieves. Forefathers avenge
me."
Mrs. Christina Harrington Is another
from whom a next visit Is awaited with
trepidation by the . officers of the
"cranks' mecca," Judge Coffey'B depart
ment of the Superior Court. . In her
opinion she is the legatee of some $30,
000 bequeathed her, she believes, by her
uncle, the late Rev. Father J. F. Har
rington, although the records, show
that the property of the deceased is
only valued at $5200 all told. and among
the assets are some timber lands that
it is thought are greatly overvalued.
Miss Harrington made her last ap
pearance in court about three months
ago. At that time she stated that she
intended to create a disturbance unless
that $30,000 was promptly forthcoming:,
which she was of the opinion- had been
spirited away. She,, like others with
similar delusions, was led away and
confined in a nearby cell. . Afterward
she made her way to the ;offlices of At
torney Thomas E. Curr-an, where her
demands were made k,nowri. .The.at
torney expostulated with. her arid In
formed her that he was powerless to
get his hands on that $3.0,000. > â¢-.:â¢â¢â¢â¢
Here the attorney made a mistake as '
Miss Harrington promptly wrecked his
offices. Desks were toppled, cuspidors
penetrated glass paneled dbprs and â 
chaos in general prevailed: .A' police-""
man or two extracted Misfs Harrington
from the wreck., and the. Insanity Com
missioners busied themselves with her
case, but found that at t;he time, they
could not send her to the. asylum. ; .
One of the troublesome- court fre
quenters of old, who has hot material

time, is John Nevin. ! Nevin has .sev

he is entitled to shares in; the;distribu-T

hands would labor in his bejialf and
secure him a position on the police
force. The reason Nevin fails to fur?- \
ther press his claims is that He Is in
the asylum for the. insane' at Ukiah.
His last appearance in court occurred .
last April. He sought Judge Cofrey's
department, as usual, and informed the
bailiff that Chief of Police- Le.es had
hired five policemen to shoot through
the side of his house and render .him
hors de combat. This settled it, and
he was bundled off to an asylum! '
James Dolan, a dishwasher, is' .under
the impression that he is the: heir to
a 1600,000 estate. He is- a great an- -
nnynnce around the courts, as well as

J. Heggerty, of Knight' & Heggerty.
He visits the attorney's office at inter*
vals, and Mr. Heggerty never gets in
a hurry to catch a car or a last boat
but Dolan looms up and begs to learn
the last developments regarding "his
$500,000 estate. â¢ '
Dolan civated a scene in the County
Clerk's office not long ago. He raved
about that estate until the police had
to be called and the "opulent dish
washer" arrested.- He was found guilty
of disturbing the peace and In conse
quence passed a week behind prison
bars. He was released after being ad-
monished by the Police Judge to re
main away from the "cranks' mecca."
After a few days he returned, however,
and he had a hearing before the "In
sanity Commissioners. Judge Belcher
thought that the evidence was insuffi
cient to prove that he was a danger
ous character, and ordered his dis
charge. ___^^_________

EVANGELIST
AND
HIGHWAYMAN
Singular Career of Rev. Myror
Hilgard, Who Acted the Part
v of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
ROBERT LOUIS" 1 STEVENSON'S
conception of the strange case
of Dr. Jekyll and. Mr. Hyde has
its counterpart in a remarkable
case in South Dakota that fur
nishes the theme for a thrilling
Btory to the New YonS Herald from
â¢Fairfax. It is a story of the career of
â¢"Rev. Myron Hilgard, evangelist, cattle
thief, highwayman and jail breaker.
The most vivid flights of the imagina
tion of the lurid border iiction writer
could scarcely conceive an-.vthing more
.â¢ picturesque than Rev. Mr. lÂ£ ; lgard, while
â¢his adventures are full of daring and
â¢ audacity equally striking.
... . A preacher by day and a masked
highwayman by night, he managed to
..deceive his trusting flock for four
â¢ years. The climax finally ctune when
:â¢ he was caught red handed, narrowly
escaped lynching, was jailed and es
caped after a murderous asauit on his
â â 'keeper that landed him a free man
â crrice more. This is the Fairfax corre
spondent's story:
: . Rev. Myron Hilgard came to these
â¢. parts in 1894. He just dropped down
â  in Bonesteel. one autumn day and an
â¢.. nounced that he had come to settle and
' " grow up with the country. He had his
wife and three little children with him,
and they wrfe all a pretty likely lot for
these parts: In 1594 Gregory County,
which looks on the map like a big shoe,
â¢ .made by the curves of the Missouri
River at the extreme southern border
of the State, wasÂ»in its infancy. Grub
was scarce and rrops were a delusion
and a snare. _
"I am the Rev. Myron Hilgard, he
announced to the curious, "and these,"
with a wave of his hand which includ
â  ed the balance uf the Hilgard family,
"thesÂ» are my pearls. A man may
have pearls in this life, but he should
lay up his gifts in heaven, and strive
to' gain the pearl without nrice. I
have come to preach the- gospel among
you." ,
."One-eyed Ike," whose other name is
â¢Perkins, one of Nicholas Hammil's cow,
punchers, happened to be in the post
office when the stranger delivered him
self of his introductory speech. Ike
h<>ver -minces his word?, and on this ocl>
cas lon he chimed right in.
â 'Well, parson." he remarked, "I recÂ»
. kon you've just about struck the right
spot. Everything around these parts
â¢ seems goln' right plumb ter hell, an' 1
reckon the only thing that can be saved
is souls. So pitch right in, an" we'll
' ante In' every Sunday ter help ye
along."
. The clerical stranger grasped the
hard hand of the cowboy in "his own
- soft one. "God bleps you, my noble
â¢ brother," he exclaimed, "God bless
you."
.Rather abashed at this unexpected
outburst,- Ike blushed to the roots of
his sandy hair and slunk off into the
' crowd. This was four years aero. One
day last week 1 met him ju?t ir. from
Hammil's ranch. He had been drink
. ing heavily. I was amazed, for ha
' hadn't touched a drop in a long time.
â  in fact, he was popularly supposed to
have gotten religion. He, In common
with others, had come under the spell
of. the Rev. Myron Hilgard.
He was undeniably drunk, and as I
approached him I noticed that he was
engaged in the remarkable pastime of
spitting on his own hand. When I
asked what he was doing he looked at
me In a most maudlin manner and re
marked:
"An' ter think I was the first man in
this county ter shake him by the hand.
The viper"! The four flush, double
tongued hypocrite!"
He held his hand off at arm's length,
gazed reproachfully at that offending
member and again deliberately spat in
his palm. I knew without asking that
he referred to the Rev. Myron Hilgard.
But Ike was not alone in the feeling
of resentment against the man who
had deceived an entire county. He
was a most plausible scoundrel. He
â was a striking figure, tall, smooth
shaven and with a mass of long blark
hair brushed back from a high, well
developed forehead. His features were
clear, cut and denoted no httle intel
lectuality.
But at that time Bonesteel pave a
great deal more attention to getting
three square meals by day and keeping
an eye on the Ponca Indians just over
the border in Nebraska by night than
to the soul's prospects in the region be
yond the Styx. So Key. Mr. rfilgard 8
exhortations tn the Pouth Dakotans to
forsako their evil ways were not at first
productive of much fruit.
The hour had struck for him to bosrin
to dig for a living, so early in December
he got possession of a one-story farm
house three miles north of Bonestee),
together with a quarter section of land.
It was a hard winter and Hilfrard had
to borrow supplies from his neighbors
for a time, promising that he would re
imburse them from his crop the follow
ing year. In a school house hard My he
held Sunday services, never forgettii:*
to take up a collection and occasionally
through the week he held meetings
which he styled revivals. He was re
garded by his neighbors as such a good
man that they called him into their
conferences, both spiritual and tem
poral. One thing, however, they had
great difficulty in understandingâ he
was nearly always absent from home
at night. It was finally explained to
them that Rev. Mr. Hilgard had two or
three other charges, one of them on
the east side of the Missouri River, and
on that account he was not able to
spend many of his evenings at home.
It is no easy 'matter to kill time In a
sparsely settled region of South Dako
ta, especially during the winter months,
so the Rev.' Myron's Sunday services
and weekly revivals became very popu
lar. He was a persuasive talker,- with
a certain amount of rough eloquence
that appealed to the farmers and cat
tlemen, who, with their familiesâ those
who had families â seldom missed a
service. In tir ? a gradual change be
came noticeable in the dally lives of
the natives which finally developed Into
a great wave of religious fervor.
The little school house was scarcely
large enough to hold the crowds gath
ered there to hear the teachings of the
Rev. Myron and to ponder upon the
straight and narrow way that leadeth
to eternal life. The revival services
developed into good old camp meeting
times. As an exhorter the new parson
was a tremendous success. The mourn
ers' bench was continually crowded with
repentant sinners. For, as the preacher
often remarked, no man knoweth the
day or the hour when his soul may be
required of him. And yet it was often
noticed that he felt nervously in the
region of the hip pocket beneath his
long black coat-
Then came numerous? mysterious dep
redations. In January, 189Â»; a ranch
man living in the neighborhood of Fair
fax iottt-iwtenty-eight head uf fat cattle
whioh he was about to drive to a sta
tion for shipment to Chicago.- They
disappeared in the night, and.. no trace
whatever could be found of them then
or afterward. Five or six days later a
farmer, west of Bonesteel, lost peven
horses, four of them Percherons, which
he had brought in to do his spring
work with.
S.-arch was made for them all over
the eastern part of the county, but they
were a? completely lost as if they had
been swallowed up- by the earth. About
February 1 another ranchman was
robbed of eighteen cows, calves and
beeves. Th^s*. depredations were fol
lowed by others. Four or five farmers,
living in isolated .parts 'of the county,
were held up at the point of the rifle,
robbed of their money and their houses
were ransacked of their valuables.
During the next two months several
travelers were held up and robbed.
The community was thoroughly
aroused, the Rev. Mr. Hilgard be-
ing one of the most enthusiastic
in the search for the scoundrel.
a person the ranchmen spoke of
as "Ponca Jim," who got his name
from the river of that name running
southeastward through the county.
Nobody could pay definitely that he had
seen this awful person, but everybody

believed him to exist. The common
notion was that he was a big 200-pound
half breed, who spent his nights rob
bing farmers and ranchmen, killing
those who resisted him and fleeing
adross the Nebraska border in the early
dawn to the friendly Ponca Indian
reservation.
There he was safe until the shades of
another night should afford him the op
portunity to go forth for another sea
eon of rapine and murder. Plans with
out number were laid to catch him. He
was several times chased at a furious
paceâ so the natives saidâ to the bor-^
der of the reservation!, but they had
to turn back in rage and disappoint
ment because they dared not rush in
among the tepees of the red men.
Thus matters ran on, "Ponea Jim"
in the meantime increasing his string
of crimes to more than a score of great
robberies, until the ranchmen conclud
ed to send a committee to the Ponca
reservation with the view of getting
the Indians, by bribery or otherwise, to
give up the terror of Gregory County.
The chief of the tribe and his big and
little chiefs expressed surprise and in
dignation at the insinuation that they
were harboring a thief and murderer,
and by implication getting a portion of
the plunder. They felt sure, they said,
that the mysterious plunderer did not
live on the reservation and that, at
least, there was nobody on the reserva
tion who went by the name of "Ponca
Jim."
The . delegation did not believe the
story of the Indians, although there
was no positive evidence that the guilty
person was one of them, but t â >-
went thoughtfully back to their homes
around Hum-steel and Fairfax, and re
solved to catch the prince of rascals if
it took all of several summers. Rev.
Mr. Hilgard threw his caster into the
ring by praying that the arch fiend of
Gregory County mi^ht be delivered
into the hands of the righteous citizens
of that community, and gained fresh
popularity by promising to help pull
the rope which should send him into
eternity. They like muscular Christian
ity out here.
Time wore on into weeks, into
months, into years. The robberies and
murders continued, but the rascal was
as elusive as a Tennessee flea. After

THE CHURCHLESS DISTRICT
OF SAN FRANCISCO
Section of the City Where Over 70,000 People Liveâ The Churches Have All Moved From
the Territory and Turned it Over to a pew Missions.
LIKE most other large cities in
the United States and many, too,
in Europe, San Francisco has its
"churchless section"; that is a
section of the city, generally
the most densely populated, too, which
has been deserted by the regularly or
ganized church congregations as a site
for a place of worship.
In this city this churchless section
not more than three decades ago con
tained nearly all if not all of the regu
lar places of worship for the various
congregational bodies. One after an
other they have abandoned their older
church homes and, following the better
classes of . permanent residents, have
sought new locations in the less crowd
ed outer districts. A few general causes
have operated in all these changes of
location.
Sometimes the majority of the mem
bers of the congregation have moved
their homes far from the old church,
and not caring to come down town to
worship the church has been obliged to
follow them to distant quarters in or
der to retain them on its membership
rolls. Then again the down-town
building is usually old-fashioned, dark
and uncomfortable generally, while the
ground on which it stands has large
value for business purposes. By sell
ing enough money can be realized to
purchase a much larger lot in a suitable
and more convenient quarter and to
erect thereon a large and more modern
church edifice that will be an attrac
tion to good paying pew renters.
The churchless section of San Fran
cisco would be nearly if not quite
doubled in area and population were it
not for three or four churches that for
one reason or another still stand their
ground, far out from the general
gathering of the church buildings, and
thus, like grlra forts against evil, they
militia, and talk, talk, talk, all of which
ended in more talk.
All this timj "One-eyed Ike," al
though a convert to Christianity and
V one of the leading pillars in the Rev.
Myron Hilgard's congregation, with
prospects of becoming a deacon, had
been most zealous in pursuit of "Ponca
Jim" and his imaginary successor,
"Montana Jake." Prayers were offered
up In the little improvised pulpit in the
school house for the capture of the
marauder, and "One-eyed Ike's"
"amens" were of the loudest and most
approved Methodist type.
Late in July Nicholas Hammll, "One
eyed Ike's" employer, who owns a ranch
fourteen miles north of Bonesteel, had
a bunch of steers, numbering sixty
three, which he intended to ship to
Chicago the first week in August. Mr.
Hammil got up one morning to find
that all but four of this splendid bunch
of cattle had vanished without his con
nivance. Mr. Hammil is a man of few
words. Action is his strong specialty.
Calling together six cowboys a few
minutes after sunrise, he armed them,
tooth and heel and told them to go
forth and bring back the cattle if pos
sible, but under no circumstances to
return without "Montana Jake," dead
or alive. 'One-eyed Ike,'' much to his
delight, was put in command of the
outfit.
The pursuers started to the west
ward, following the trail of the cattle,
provisioned for several days of hard
riding. About noon they found the
cattle, exhausted from a hard drive and
lying down in the water of a swamp.
They pushed on, and half an hour later
caught sight of the "rustler" riding at
full speed to the northwest. The cow
boys got in range of him and fired sev
eral shots with a view to forcing him
to surrender, but he only rode the
harder.
For three hours the chase continued,
the horses of both pursuers and pur
sued laboring painfully from the ef
fects of the hard riding. The cow
boys were satisfied to keep their man
prevent the extension of the lines of
the "churchless" area.
Along Powell and Stockton, from
Geary north, the churches seem to have
made a more decided stand, six or more
holding their ground on a line that
promises at least for long time to come
to be more or less permanent.
Within this churchless section are to
be found nearly all the regular hotels,
high grade as well as low, and the
great majority of lodging and rooming
houses, especially those of the cheaper
grades, besides the vast number of
separate abodes occupied by one or
more families. On a reasonable esti
mate the population, permanent and
transient, will reach 00,000, more than
one-fourth of the whole population in
cluded within the limits of the city.
In this churchless section, too, are
to be found far more than one-half of
all the saloons of the city and nearly
all the low dives and dancehalls and
other places of degrading vice, besides
Chinatown and its immediate sur-
roundings.
Though the churches have gone this
vast field has not been entirely left un
tilled by Gospel messengers. Some pro
vision is being made for the spiritual
needs of these people, and in ways, too,
probably more fruitful of visible re
sults than those followed ,by the regu
lar church methods. In Chinatown sev
eral of these latter have their Chinese
and Japanese missions, which are
manfully battling against heathen
prejudice and vice.
On the very edge of the Barbary
Coast the Salvation Army has three
active posts, besides a woman's shelter.
Three other posts and another shelter
are stationed elsewhere in the shaded
section of the city. Two Peniel mis
sions are located on Kearny street at
either end of the Barbary Coast, while
another is on Third and Stevenson
Btreets. All these, as well aa the "vol
unteers" and other bands, are to be

Suddenly the exhausted horse ridden

the oldest mission stations in the city

The fallowing is an amusing story of
young Prince Alexander of Batten
berg, now at Eton:
"Like many other little boys he ran
short of pocket money and wrote an
ingenious letter to his august grand
mother. Queen Victoria, asking for
some slight pecuniary assistance. He
received in return a just rebuke, tell
ing him that little boys should keep
within their limits and that he must
wait until his allowance next became
due. Shortly afterward the undefeated
little Prince resumed the correspond
ence in something like the following
form: 'My dear grandmamma â I am
sure you will be glad to know that I
need not trouble you for any money
Just now, for I sold your last letter to
another boy here for 30 shillings.' "

LIKE A VETERAN COWBOY.
He's a Trained Steer and Helps the Vaqueros at
Their Work in the Corrals.
THE greatest "cowboy steer" in
the world has his home on the
San Marcos ranch near Santa
Barbara.
' By some people he;,iÂ§*glinply
called a. trained steer; by : otters a
"cavresto." But as he does the hardest
kind of cowboy work and. a good deal
of a nature the cowboys cannot/do, it
would seem as if the Texas name "cow
boy steer" is the most appropriate. /
On every well-regulated -cattle; ranch
in the West there is at least one steer
trained to help the cowboys in their
work- But there is none as proficient
in his business as the # one on the San
Marcos ranch. . ?
The -cowboys have named this fellow
"El Rey" (the king).' and he is cer
tainly deserving .of the title.
â¢ He" holds' his title and his throne by
the Dower of brain and. muscle. The
many manifestations of extraordinary
intellect exhibited by dogs and trained
horses are surprising enough in them
selves, 'but they dwindle into com
monplace when one considers the pe
culiar accomplishments of the cavresto
"El : Rev." The fierceness of wild cattle
is simply appalling.
The credit for the cjnquering and
education of "El Rey" is due entirely to
th< pluck and patience of a vaquero
named Louis Ruiz. And when his la
bors were finished a wonderful work
had been accomplished. From the wild
est : and ' most vicious of them all "El
Rey" had become as docile and obed
ient, as a dog.
As : we all know, the ordinary cavresto
Is trained, when the riata. has captured
one of the bellowing, "plunging, mad
dened animals, to range himself along
side the captive arid permit the va
quero to. secure him firmly to the horns
of the captive by means of the riata.
When the rodeo takes place these
trained animals are sent into the dense
undergrowth and forests to rout out the
hiding and terrified cattle. Even the
cowboys, strong and skilled as they
are, would never be able to drive them
into the open country. But with the
best of the cavrestos a great deal of
prodding, pushing and swearing is con
sidered necessary to make them per
form their duties.
With "El Rey" all is different. At
the word of command he is off through
the thickets, driving from their hid
ing places the stubborn cattle. He
waits for "no riata. Locking his own
big. strong and crooked horns into the
horns of his indignant brother he hauls
and tugs and pulls until victory is his.
Many and fierce are his fights. Wild
Is his rage when, after a terrific strug
gle, with victory almost in reach, the
captive succeeds in slipping from the
terrible crook of "El Reey's" horns and
dashes off. once more to the chaparral
and freedom. . But the wild steer's lib
erty is short lived. "El Rey" never
falters in -his pursuit and never returns
?xeept in company with his struggling
prisoner. â¢
Having -brought in his captive "El
Rey'.'* resolutely stands by and holds
him with his horns till he is identified,
branded, marked.' killed, or whatever
the cattlemen elect to do with the cap
tive. All the while the captive is
held , steadily and stoutly til! the cat
tlemen -have .finished and "El Rey" is
ordered to. "let go."
Perhaps the most remarkable thing
Is ."the coolness with which "El Rev"
stands' quietly holding down the head
5f the .captured animal while the va
luero deftly: touches a knife to the cap
:ive's throat. ! The sight of blood does
3ot seem to affect him in the least.
When one of. the refractory cattle is
brought in by a cavresto he is imme
diately thrown to the ground and his
hind legs securely tied together by the
strong riata. His head is held down

by the trained steer, and it is then the
executioner operates.
The ordinary cavresto does not like
the operation of hojding another Bteer
to be killed. He would willingly get
away if he could, but he is usually too
tightly bound and must play his part to
the end. But "El Rey" ne<-ds no
riata to compel him to do his duty.
With his terrible horns locked of his
own accord into the horns of his cap
tive, he stands a sturdy and interested
participant until the gleaming knife of
the vaquero lets the life-blood spurt
forth.
With his master, the Vaquero Ruiz,
"El Rey" ia as gentle as- a favorite
horse could be. To the home vaqueros
he is calmly indifferent, but with stran
gers all his native fierceness and
vioiousness comes into life again. King
of his kind is "El Rey," and gold can
not buy him.

SKETCH SHOWING RAPIDITY WITH WHICH THE DISEASE MOVES
DOTTED FIGURE, NORMAL CONDITION OF THE COW.
HEAVY FIGURE, ONE WEEK AFTER INFECTION.
IN my opinion the outbreak of Texas fever in the Southern Cali
'ornia herds is the most serious blow to cattle interests in this
State since I have been in the practice. The appearance of the
liseasf is due to the importation of infected stocky from other sec
tions of the country. This State, unlike most of the other
States, has no State veterinarian, and therefore absolutely no pro
tection is afforded against the importation of dangerous diseases.
California should by all means establish a veterinary department
of the State Board of Health, with a representative in each county
of the State. *
Absolute and instant quarantine from infested districts so far re
ported, together with prompt isolation of all suspected cases, is the
only means of preventing the propagation of this plague. It will be
extr.-mely hard work even then, as^the disease may even now be
found in districts as yet not reported and where the disease has not
been identified. The action of The Call is to be heartily commended
fur thus giving aid to stockmen in recognizing this disease.
In the post-mortem examinations that I have made of cattle
which have died from Texas fever 1 have found a general set of
post-^nrt-m lesions, which are as follows: The water is of a dark
reddish-brown color, perfectly clear and transparent; the liver is
greatly enlarged and friable, the spleen also greatly augmented in
volume containing a very dark grumous liquid, and the intestines,
both small ar.d large, present a large number of ulcerated patches
The general appearance of the muscular tissues is that of an animal
that has been bled to death. It being pale and the blood vessels be
ing partially emptied of the life fluid. The large blood vessels, in
stead of containing blood, as generally found in post-mortems of
other diseases, are filled chiefly with the liquid portion of that fluid,
namely, serum.
In anthrax proper, for Texas fever is a species of the same, we
find in the vessels instead of a yellow colored fluid a dark, tarry,
sticky substance. This is one of the most prominent differences in
the two diseases. -*>
The stockmen of Marin County are sparing no pains to prevent
the introduction of the disease into their herds and are most care
ful in the selection of the stock used in replenishing their herds.
A meeting should be called in the near future of scientific men
for the purpose of discussing the disease and its mode of prevention.

CURIOUS QROw'lj^Q STO^E.
THE most interesting thing I saw
down in Maine was a growing
stone that belongs to H. H. Ham
mond of Smiths Cove, near Winter
Harbor, and lies upon a granite post
beside the steps that lead to his front
door. It is egg shaped and of perfect
symmetry, with the exception rfhat it
is somewhat flattened upon the side
which rested upon the ground.
Thirty years ago or more William
Hammond, a brother of H. H., who now
lives in San Francisco picked up this
remarkable stone upon the edge of the
cove. He was then a boy 10 years old,
and was attracted by its regular shape
and smooth surface, which contains a
good deal of mica schist and sparkles
in the sun as if it had been sprinkled
with diamond dust.
The boy took the stone home in his
pocket, for it was very small in com
parison with its present size, and could
have been easily slipped into a quart
cup. He played with it in the yard
for several years, ant! it lay upon the
mantelpiece in the house during the
winter months, but as he grew older
he lost interest in the plaything and it
rolled under a lilac bush beside the
front door. There it remained for fif
teen years or*so. When young Ham
mond returned from San Francisco he
recognized it, but was much astonished
to find that it had increased in size and
weight to a most remarkable degree.
When he was a child, as I said, he
carried the stone in his pocket. When
he recovered it. as a man, it was larger
than the crown of a "*ovepipe hat and
weighed at least twelve or fifteen
pounds more than when he saw it last.
H. H. Hammond became so much in
terested in the phenomenon that he re
moved it from the ground beneath the
lilac bush and placed it upon the gran
ite step at the right of the front door,
where the sun rests upon it the greater
part of the day.
Shortly after it was placed there,
about six years ago, Mr. Hammond got
the meat peddler to put it on the
scales, and its weight was forty-one
pounds, which was marked with* a pen
cil upon the stone itself with the date.
Three years later it had grown to fifty
pounds*. On the 12th day of May last
the stone was weighed again by the
same scales and tipped the beam at
sixty-five pounds. Mr. Hammond then
made a series of measurements and
will preserve them for future compari
son. The circumference of the stone by
tape measure, the longest way, is 3
feet 2 inches, while at the widest part
the narrow way it is 2 feet 4 inches.
Mr. Hammond is a respectable farm
er, is a deacon in the Baptist Church,
and was born in the house where he
lives. _

THE TICK THAT SPREADS
THE DEADLY TEXAS FEVER.
Reasons why it threatens to prove sucb a scourge in this State and the precautions that
are being tak.en to check it.
SAX BERNARDINO. Sept. 29.â After a thorough investigation County
Ve*erinary Surgeon Wise declares that Texas fever is raging among cattle
along the Mojave River. The numerous deaths among stock in that re
ion which have been noticed for some time, Vere supposed to have been
for 'lack of feed, resulting from the drought. At last J. J. Cuddeback, a
prominent stockman. o%vning herds about Soda and Rock Springs, appeared
before the Board of Supervisors and asked for an investigation.
Wise was Â«ent out and found hundreds of head dying, their condition
being appalling. The infected cattle have been driven up from Foster's
ranch near Capistrano. San Diego County, owing to the lack of feed in that
district In stock known as immunes the disease is not detected. The
fever is caused by a tick, about the size of the two first Joints of the
finger, burrowing into the animal's flesh.
THE discovery of Texas or South
ern fever in the herds of South
ern California in a malignant
form is a serious menace to the
cattle industry of the State. Un
less prompt sanitary precautions
are adopted and an effort made to
Isolate the diseased herds, much dam
age will be done, declare the author
ities.
This disease is most commonly com
municated by cattle recently removed
from an infected locality. Without
doubt the disease among the
California cattle can be directly traced
to the importation of cattle from some
of the Southern States.
The disease has this striking pecu
liarity among animals; animals which
disseminate the infection are apparent
ly in good health, while those which
sicken and die from it do not as a rule
infect others.
The sickness is accompanied by high
fever, greatly enlarged spleen, destruc
tion of the red blood corpuscles, rapid
loss of strength and by fatal results in
a large proportion of cases.
It is commonly found in all of the
Southern States, but the earliest ac
counts of it date back to 1814, where
It was found in South Carolina. The
driving of cattle from the infected dis
tricts in large numbers through Texas
probably gave it the name of Texas
fevtr.
In regard to the manner in which the
disease is communicated: Experience
shows that this does not occur by ani
mals coming in contact with others. It
is an indirect infection. The cattle from
an infected district first infect the pas
tures, roads, pens, cars, etc., and the
susceptible cattle obtain the virus sec
oiiu hand from them.
Dr. Theobald Smith of the Bureau of
Animal Industry, an eminent authority
on this disease, says: "The animals
do not contract the disease even when
separated by a fence except where
there be drainage from the infected
pasture."
Although the fever can be dissemin
ated in various ways, the chief means

Most of the men employed have their

of conveying the infection is through
the ticks which adhere to the cattle
from the infected district. So far as
known the disease is not spread by the
saliva or manure of cattle.
In any measure looking to the pre
vention of the disease attention must
therefore be given almost entirely to
the ticks, and from recent investigation
it appears that should the cattle from
an infected district be freed from these
parasites before leaving they wouid
vt ' be able to spread the disease.
Texas fever is caused by an organ
lsn which lives within the red blood
orpuscles and breaks them up. It is
therefore simply a blood disease.
The symptoms of the disease, which
usually appear anywhere from 20 to
90 days after exposure to infected soil,
re In their first stage, dullness, loss
of appetite and a tendency to leave the
herd and stand or lie down alone. A
f( w days after these first symptoms ap
pear the temperature rises from a nor
mal of 101-103 degrees Farenhelt to 106
107 degrees Farenheit, and there is lit
tle or no change until death or recov
ery ensues. The higher tlie tempera
ture.the more fatal the end. Toward
the end of the disease emaciation be
comes more pronounced and signs of
dehrium are observed in some cases.
Death occurs most frequently in the
night.
The tick, which causes most of the
attacks, is a parasite of cattle in the
southern part of the United States, at
taching itself to the skin of animals
and drawing the blood.
The eggs, laid on the ground after the
female falls from an animal, begin to
develop at once, and at the end of six

army in general, I will not speak here.
Yet despite this host of watchdogs, the
Kaiser feels secure nowhere but in
Potsdam, where the castle is guarded
by 500 picked men in barracks con
nected with the palace, and where the
royal park is patrolled by numerous
sentinels, who have orders to shoot at

Jred little ticks ready to attach them
selves to healthy, uninoculated cattle,
[n a week or more after, the disease
makes its appearance.
Although it is probable that the dis
sase was brought to this State by in
fected cattle, still, according to the
t-iews of the Bureau of Animal Indus
try, it could have been brought in
cattle-cars. The tick is often found
In the sweepings from these cars.
The bureau further says: "How to
a;et rid of the ticks in pasture without
destroying vegetation we do not know
it present. Every spot once infected is
dangerous during the entire season."
Freezing weather destroys the tick,
[n sunny California this is not likely to
occur, so this check cannot be count
ed on.
So in California different measures
must be adopted. All cattle with the
disease or of suspicious appearance
should be isolated immediately after
the appearance of the disease. The
herds should be carefully examined for
ticks, if practicable, especially upon
the thighs and udder, where they pre
fer to locate. The ticks do not mature
until after the disease has made its ap
pearance, when they swell up and are
plainly visible.
It is of prime importance that all
ticks be removed from sick animals, as
they abstrnct a considerable amount of
blood and strength, and thereby retard
a possible recovery.
Dr. Smith recommends as a remedy
sulphate of quinia, in doses of fifteen
to thirty grains, according to the size
of the animal. Tincture of aconite root
and Epsom salts have been combined
with it with good results.
Sanitary regulations should be
adopted and rigidly followed. They
should define the boundary of the in
fected are^. and no cattle should be
shipped from it except by boat or rail
plainly marked with the name of the
district. The cars or boats used for
such transportation should be care
fully cleansed and disinfected before
uninfected stock is carried.
In certain portions of the South
these simple regulations have been fol
lowed, and as a. result the disease has
been reduced to a riinimum.

all armed to the teeth. These men.
usually a full dozen, are yet separated
from his Majesty by two more cham
bers, all of them opening into one an
other, and having no entrance from the
corridor. These messengers belong to
various branches of the service, and,
according t > ieir arms, are provided
with horses or bicycles, waiting outside.

for argument's sake that it is done.
In the next room sit the Kaiser's' valet,
his body chasseur and two flunkies, all

RISKING LIFE AND LIMBS
TO FIND GOLD IN ALASKA.

: vation and Death While Chasing Mere Rumors That Gold Had Been Located in Certain Districts.
. â¢â 
PROSPECTING in Alaska during
, the winter is a succession of
. hardships and horrors.
. For verification of this state
â¢ ;.. rnent it is only necessary to con
sult :the diary or logbook of Captain
W.'-M. Ciiff ee that his wife recently re
ceived from him. Jt is a closely written
.book of nearly 200 pages and covers the
daily doings of eight months in Alaska.
Large' portions of the diary relate to
unimportant happenings, but that
which, refers to the prospecting trips
is tliie most thrilling kind of reading.
Captain Coffee, with a party of ten,
left San Francisco on August 23 of last
year. ..The party had chartered the
gasoline schooner Bessie 'X to take
them- ' and a steam launch to St.
Micfeael, at the Yukon. It had been
represented -that the gasoline schooner
was. a fast vessel and would reach. St.
Michael in time for the voyage up the
Yukon to.Dawson City to be made in
the. steam launch before the river froze
for .this winter.
â¢. - "The/ schooner, however, proved a dis
;i-p'j.i ointment. ' The engine worked bad
ly.'iiioit of the time so that St Michael
is^as. not reached until near the end of
October. The harbor was full of ice,
arid' it .was. only by the greatest good
luck that the gasoline schooner escaped
"be.fore.the winter blockade. Of course
progress up the Yukon at this time of
.the year was out of the question. So
Captain Coffee's party went into winter
â¢quarters and Bettled down to several
.months of monotony to await the
spring break up and free water on the
river. .
â¢ "jt so happened, though, that at
that time the air was full of rumors of
wondrous gold finds. Each day
brought in some Indian who told a tale
of bright yellow nuggets the size of
hen Vggs. All knew the exact spot
where the gold had been found and
could guide a party th-re for a consid
eration.
. As might be expected, men out hunt

exfcept the Indian guides, suffered ir
reparable dan .;â¢
As a resuit of these trips there was
nothing to show exr.-pt a few location
rri'inuments on spots where only the
Indian guide's word was an indication
that gcrld might be found by digging.
The. expense of these trip? considerably
cut into the finances of the prospectors,
and when spring came and the trip up
the Yukon was begun it had to be un
dertaken on short rations and under un
- propitious circumstances. I?t-ttÂ»-r far
would it have been for every member
of the party if they had remained
quietly at St. Michael until the warm
â¢ weather came.
The three prospecting trips taken by
â¢Captain Coffee and his party were
somewhat Bimilar as far as the routine
of travel was concerned and general
â¢ results, but the first trip was the most
dangerous and disastrous. Under ordi-
nary circumstances it would have de
terred them from a second trip, but
they reasoned with the superstition of
the gold-hunter that they had had their
chare of bad luck and now things would
come their way. Instead of warning
them the horrors of the first trip merely
served as a stimulus to further efforts,
because they felt that fortune was
about to shine on them.
The start for the first trip was made
shortly after daybreak on December 3,
1897. This was about 10 o'clock in the
forenoon. The weather had been quite
cold for some time and it was thought
perfectly safe to cross any of the rivers
on the ice.
Unalakleek was the destination of the
party. From this point the Indian
guide was to, show the way to the gold
pile. The distance was only about
tixty miles, and with gc-od dog teams
there seemed to be no reason why the
trip should not be made in two days.
But trouble came quickly. Although
the air was cairn when the start was
made it soon began to blow and a fine
snow flew through the air. The cold
gradually became intense.
As is usual in traveling through wild
' countries the party gets pretty well
separated. The best and strongest get
to the front and the others follow as
they may. It so happened that Captain
Coffee was bringing up the rear, as his
dog team was not as strong as the one
in the lead.
The party was crossing the mouth of
the Yukon River and had almost
reached the shore, when Captain Cof
fee, to his horror, suddenly came to an
enormous crack, with the icy water
raging through it. Beneath his feet
the ice was cracking and heaving. He
turned to make a crossing further to
his left, but was violently thrown down
by the trembling ice.
When he jumped to his feet he saw
that he was alone on a cake of ice not
more than ten feet square. Water wÂ«s
all around him and the wind was rising
to a hurricane. Out toward the sea he
could see huge ice blocks tossing about
and grinding in a swell that was grow
ing wilder and wilder.
It was an awful situation, and the
captain confesses, in his diary, that nes
wished himself safely out of it and back
in the rude shelter at St. Michael.
There was nothing the captain could
do to help himself, although he knew
that if he drifted out to sea it meant
instant death. At the same time he
knew that to Jump from the ice cake
and attempt to swim to -the main body
of ice that was only a few feet distant
would only hasten the end. He could
only wait and hope.
Meanwhile the other members of the
party who had reached the land at once
formed plans for rescuing the captain.
They ran ahead of the ice pack until
near enough to throw him a rope. All
the men who engaged in the rescue
were tied together by a rope that was
fastened to a tree on shore.
After a number of futile efforts Cap
tain Coffee managed to catch a rope
that was thrown to him. This he made
fast to a corner of his ice cake and was
pulled to a place of comparative safety.
By this time the whole pack was break
ins up and it was only by the barest
chance that the party safely reached
shore.
An hour afterward it was pitch dark
and only five miles had been covered
since the start In the morning-. Camp
was made for the night, but there was
little comfort. The cold was intense and
the fine snow was biown through the
cracks in the tents and into the beds
of the sleeping men. The snow melted
â  n the beds and in an hour or so all
the men were wringing wet and shiver
ing.
By 3 o'clock next morning, another
etart was made. It was pitch dark ex
cept for the faint light of the aurora
borealls. Good time was made for
some distance and then Captain Coffee
stepped on a thin sheet of ice on a
river over which the trail lay and sank
into the Icy water. Fortunately the
others were not far behind him at this
time and soon caught up and pulled
him out. This accident, however, ne
cessitated a stop and the building of a
big fire to prevent the captain from
fri f-zing to death.
The next day the party was caught in
a blizzard and after an hour's aimless
traveling were compelled to halt. For
hours the band huddled together in the
vain effort to keep warm. When the
storm died down a little a fire was built
and attempts were madp to resuscitate
two of the party who had succumbed
to the cold. One man was restored to
consciousness, but the other was buried
in an unmarked grave.
Next day it was noticed that John
son, the man who had been resuscitated
on the previous day, was lagging be
hind. . Soon the others yvere half a
mile ahead, and when somebody looked
back Johnson was seen half buried in
the snow.
His comrades hastened back and
found that both of Johnson's feet were
frozen. He was dragged over the
snow for the whole half-mile, when he
was put on to a sled and so carried the
rest of the way.
It took ten days from the time the
party left St. Michael to reach Un
alaska, an average of about six miles a
day.
For a few days the party rested and
the mission priest amputated John
son's frozen leg. All the men were
made comfortable in the Indian huts,
and after the hardships he had been
through Captain Coffee said the rude
habitation was a veritable palace.
When the much talked of gold pros
pect was reached it proved to be only
a small ledge of very refractory ore
and the most doubtful value. Nuggets,
even of the smallest size, were not to
be found.
Eight days wer;e consumed in re
turning to St. Michael. The party was
reduced to two, Johnson being left, with
the Indians at Unalaska until the
stumps of his amputated legs should
heal. All the other men were com
pletely worn out and suffering from in
juries or frostbites.
But as soon as they recovered they
ail promptly and anxiously started out
on another prospecting trip, lost an
other man, who froze to death, and
came back half-frozen, spiritless and
without any gold.
ARE BLONDES
ON THE DECREASE?
Hairdressers, School-Teachers and Others Who Have Good
Reasons to Know Say They Are, and That the Dark-Haired Girl Is
the Coming Girl of California.
ARE blondes diminishing in num
ber In California?
Interested observers say yes,
decidedly.
Hairdressers who of all people
have the most excellent opportunities
of judging are unanimous in the decla
ration that blondes are becomine ex
tremely rare.
America never was a fair-haired na
tion. Peopled from every quarter of
the globe, there was naturally a diver
sity of coloring that made it impossible
to picture either b'onde or brunette as
typical of this broad land. Mention
Germany or any of the lands where
shines the cold midnight sun, and a
fair, flaxen-haired Gretchen fits nat
urally into the panorama that rises in
the mind. For Italy, Spain and all the
sun-kissed south there are alwayÃ the
black-eyed, olive-tinted sen6ritas. But
what traveler ever left America with
any one distinctive type safely pigeon
holed in his memory? The American
girls run the entire gamut of shade
and coloring. Neither the dark girl,
fair girl nor she of auburn hair may
claim priority for her type. Artists
who would picture the "American Girl"
draw a delicious cross between all
three of these. Time was when Amer
ica was noted for the striking effect
produced by every type thriving side by
side. But now travelers are comment
ing on the striking absence of the
blonde type.
There are scientists who say the
blonde type is doomed the wide world
over. They insist that it is only a
question of time when golden-haired
peQple will be regarded as the mythi
cal creatures of an imaginative people.
The decrease of blondes will naturally
first be noted in a country where Hfc-re
is primarily not a preponderance of the
blonde type. The followers of this
theory have compiled statistics show
ing that slowly but surely the ratio of
blondes in America has decreased with
a proportionate Increase for the other
types.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 2, 1898.
The third trip was much like the
preceding ones. One man got lost
from the party, and his dead body was
found some weeks later by an Indian.
The party found no signs of gold, and
returned to St. Michael.
By this time the river was beginning
to break, and preparations were made
for the trip to Dawson. Not a man of
the party but was sorry that he had
attempted to prospect in Alaska during
the winter season, and all had hopes of
eventually finding color.
fin English Witch Doctor.
A STORY that comes from Somer
setshire, England, probably the
most superstitious county in Eng
land, shows what sort of rivals
medical men have to contend with. One
Chambers, alias Elliot, enjoyed a large
and lucrative practice among the coun
try people as a witch doctor. Hundreds i
of peasants used to visit him from all
around for the purpose of having
"devils cast out" of either their sick
children or their cattle. Chambers used
to charge a fee of half a guinea. The
simple rustics used almost to worship
him, addressing him as "sir" and fol
lowing his directions without question.
The man was arrested through the in
strumentality of a Mr. Blackburn of
Mortlake,., who makes a specialty of
hunting down this class of impostors.
During the hearing a number of let
ters were produced from patients. One
was from a farmer thanking the witch j
doctor for having cured his cows and
mare of some mysterious disease. An
other asked how to make love, and an
other if the writer would shortly be a
widow. Still another was from a clergy-
man who had been seeking for Informa
tion concerning the black art. The pris
oner pretended to consult strange In
struments and boo-ks of cipher and to
effect his cures by burning drugs at
midnight and so on.
< "hambers was condemned to two
months' imprisonment for obtaining
money by "subtle craft."
hopeful view of the case. They claim
blondes will never disappear entirely
from the world nor yet from any one
country: but that there will be Infinite
ly fewer blondes than there are even
at the present day.
All sides, however, are agreed on one
pomt â that is, that particularly in
America the blondes are decreasing.
They go still further and assert that
in California more than any other State
is this change apparent.
Whether they reach this conclusion
by reasoning logical or otherwise the
f,aet remains that local opinion bears
out their assertions.
Hairdressers who have been plying
the brush and comb for a quarter of a
century in San Francisco declare posi
tively that natural blonde hair is be
coming a novelty. Moreover they claim
that almost all the children of their
fair-haired customers are dark. While
the children may not be strictly of the
brunette type they can rarely be classed
as even demi-blonde.
School teachers are another class of
people who can observe the decreasing
number of blondes.
A teacher who has grown gray in the
service said: "Each year I notice that
the number of blonde children in the
classroom decreases. Years ago as I sat
at my desk and looked over the heads
of the children fully one-quarter were
blondes or demi-biondes. Now there are
seldom more than three really blonde
children in a class of forty. There will
be a dozen, perhaps, of that uncertain
blonde order that never ou"tlast3 child
hood, sometimes changing into brown
hair, once in a while even to black. I
have visited the schools in the East
and in Germany and especially in the
latter place I was struck with the
monotonous sameness in the coloring
of the children.
"In the East there is a far greater
variety, but nowhere can one see more
types than in the schools of California.
Artificial Diamonds.
In order to produce true diamonds by
artificial means, iron is melted in an
electric furnance, with a large quantity
of carbon powder, and when the mixt
ure has attained a high temperature â
over 6000 degrees Fahrenheit â it is sud
denly plunged into cold water or a bath
of molten lead. The lead, being a bet
ter conductor of heat than cold water,
more suddenly deprives the mixture of
its heat. On examining the slag small
colorless crystals of carbon are found,
which are identical in their properties
with natural diamonds.
BEAUTIFUL TAPESTRY
Made Here
IN THREE YEARS.
IT seems difficult to associate the
woman of this nineteenth century
with tapestry making; neverthe
less, Mrs. C. H. Webb of this city
can show as the result of industry
and talent, which, by the way, is of no
mean order, a piece of tapestry that
has been pronounced a perfect work
of Its kind by no less an artist than
the late Marsden Brooks, who spoke
from the knowledge of one. familiar
with tapestries of the Old World.
The subject which this piece of Cali
fornia manufacture shows is the
"Morning of the Chase," and a print
from Sir Edwin Landseer's famous
painting, bought by the Marquis of
Hastings, served as a copy for details
and figures.
The coloring is entirely the selection
of this artist in wools, and her skill as
a colorist is attested by the mellowed
tints and deepened shadows shown in
the front wall of Haddon Hall, which
for a thousand years has been the
show place of Leeds.
Stone itself could not look more cold
ly gray than the reproduction of that
lower step upon which so firmly rests
the russet buskin of the lord of the
castle, and which the tourist at our
side mentions is at the present day
worn down to a thickness â or thin
ness â of three inches by the feet of the
curious who have crossed it for cen
turies; for the main entrance is depict
ed, and above the lintel the escutch
eon shows as clearly cut as though
fresh from the stone mason's hands.
Unlike an oil painting, there could be
no retouching, no covering up of mis
takes, and the linen canvas foundation
of the tapestry bears very little tam
pering with, so far as "picking out"
stitches is concerned; yet in spite of the
extreme difficulty with which this work
was performed, the expressions, atti
tudes and dress material of the seven
personages interested in the contem
plated sport could not more nearly ap
proach our conception of the original
subjects.
The placid look of the golden-haired
mistress of the castle, who stands upon
the broad step beside her dark lord,
and the leer of the jester Just doffing
his hat, and doubtless indulging in
some pleasantry, attract and hold the
attention; while one reads In the coy
and downcast glance of the maiden
seated upon the gray hunter that th*
handsome cavalier at her left, whose
eyes dwell admiringly upon her face,
has been murmuring some compliment,
or possibly reminding her of a newly
plighted troth, and the assiduous at
tention of the footman, in plush livery,
given to the stirrup of the lady on the
bay mount, assures us that under the
eyes of his master there will be no
neglect of duty.
The longer one gazes at the scene the
deeper grows the wonder that deftness
of flngdrs and an adjustment of col
ored wools could Instantly Impart to
the mind of the beholder the fact that
the lady's green gown, as well as her
lord's purple doublet, was of velvet, and
that the material of her red bodice and
petticoat is satin, or show the flesh
tints of the maiden's plump right arm
through the lace frill of her sleeve.
In the hand showing beneath this
frill she gracefully holds a slender
whip, which throws a tiny shadow
upon her horse's gray side, while the
left wrist sustains her falcon â a sulky
bird â whose three hooded companions
are still chained to their bench.
A more accurate expression of pro
testation than that which the red and
white retriever shows, at being com
pelled to submit to the adjustment of
his collar by the falconer, could not
well be portrayed; and one fancies the
head of the little bay, In whose eyea is
a look of wild surprise, dropping lower
and lower as it Intently watches the
rebellious creature, which has cast it
self, with paws outstretched, upon *he
flags of the court.
"I found the greatest difficulty In
giving the desired effect to the hollow
of the falconer's horn," snid Mrs. "Webb,
when the perfect details of that instru
ment for recalling the servitor's
charges was remarked, "for It is one of
the objects In the picture which claims
attention as it lies â the great flare out
ward â encircled by its scarlet cord, be

'BAUBLE. SALUTE!" CRIED SHE, AND
FLUNG THE ROSES AT ME.
FR. BENOIT and I were In the middle of our game
of chessâ he is good enough to say that I, the Â£001,
play the best game of all the chateau's companyâ
When came the page of the Demoiselle Alys to say
that his mistress followed upon him, and bade us
attend to speak with her.
"Co tell thy mistress, my butterfly, that when
sage and holy men are In councilâ" I began.
bravely enough, when the arras parted again behind trie
stripling, and a rose, flung smartly, struck me on the
a "great nosegay of her weapons, it being June and her
birth month. She bore the Peal of it on her cheeks, and
in her eyes, which were blue as pansies, and, clad In her
green silk frock, she seemed but anotfter rose.
For the Demoiselle Alys was the merriest of ladies.
When she was no longer than my bauble I held her upon
my knee, and I remember that she laughed long before
she learned to speakâ though she learned that early too.
She burst out laughing now, because we stared at her.
"Bauble, salute!" cried she, and flung all her roses at
me I went down on my knees to pick them up, and Ft.
Benoit. chancing to smile at me. she turned on him.
"Thou too' Tonsure an<l Cockscomb together! And
down he had to plump and helped me remake the bunch.
When it was complete the Demoiselle Alys made us
pit an.l stood before us, leaning against the chess table.
Seeing Fr. Benoit peering behind her to see that she did
not disarrange the pieces, -she swept them all into a heap
with her little handâ all except the red king, which she
held, and turned round and round under the thougnttul
"Was it thou. Fool, who wast playing with the red?"
"No " quoth I, " 'twas the holy man yonder; the inno
cent whit- s were mine everâ" She turned to Fr. Benoit.
"Didst ever think upon the red king, father?
"Only when I castle." replied the priest, wondering at
the seriousness of her tone.
"Or when he is sore pressed." she went on slowly.
"But 'tis strange how we choose our color and our king,
not knowing if he be ot Btern stuff, to fight well-or of
the kind that cowers In a corner. Was the red king win
ning, father?" .. , Â ,
"No he was losing confoundedly." I broke in. and
hadst thou not come chattering hither I would soon have
hung another bell in my cap.'
She sighed and tucked the red king in the bosom_ or
her frock. Then h*>r fair little forehead cleared. "Isow
attend, both of you." phe commanded. "I come on an
affair ofâ of Btate. lie serious at once."
"Dost wish me to shrive thee?" Fr. Benoit asked
kindly, bur she shook her little drooping head again.
"Perhaps," l suggested, "it is the advice of worldly wis
dom thou needest. Come, I will teach thee retorts to take
all the wind out of thy Cousin Isabel's Balls '
"I can make them for myself," she answered, then
looked uj. with brightened cheeks and eyes. "Dost know
my bower-woman, Rosalind?" she asked of Fr. Benoit.
He bowed assent. "She is in love, the foolish wench.
This time it was I who nodded. "And she wishes to be
married." concluded the Demoiselle Alys gravely.
"Well, it IB right to speak to me of it," said Fr.
Benoit. "I will read the banns on Sunday. Whom doth
she wish to marry?" _^
Our demoiselle looked at us with steady eyes. The
Sieur d'Audilly."
Now this Sieur d'Audilly was newly become the cap
tpin of Monseigneur's arquebusieurs, and was as wild,
evil-named, handsome a good-for-nothing as ever one
could find in a year's Journey. Tales of his doings had
come before him to the castle, for ho was indeed but a
stranger among us, and though I took note that they more
concerned his conquests among the petticoats than victo
ries over nun with good weapons in their hands, yet Mon
soigne.ur, who thinks all that iB in any degree a part of
his family (and so he counted this young blood) have
virtues In their very vices, had said that here was the
man to make a valiant lighter. An untried captain In
truth he was. Monseigneur would not wish his captain
arvl kinsman to stoop to hl.s daughter's bower-woman for
A.nd yet, being penniless, and as I say penniless, it
would Beem that even poor Rosalind was too good for him.
"Truly bower-women arc become ambitious since my
day. and Striplings more modest," said I. Father Benoit
puffed out his lower lip and said nothing.
"I suppose it is not a matter of the rack to marry
above one's station," snapped the Demoiselle Alys.
"No," I returned, "it is good to see an arquebusier
with a line aim." For, as I said, Rosalind was a good
girl.
Our demoiselle flushed scarlet, and her blue eyes
shone like angry stars. "Who dares say ill of the Sieur
d'Audilly?"
"All France and the maidens' cheeks, said I. "But
I like to sec- thee defend thy kinsman."
"He is not my kinsman!" she cried. "His father's sis
ter married the brother of my uncle's wire. That Is not
kindred!"
"No? It is well, perhaps, since he Is to marry thy
bower-woman!"
She looked angrily at me, and drew in her breath hard,
but did not answer me. "Fnther."' said she to the priest,
"thou wilt marry them, wilt thou not? That is what I
camo to ask."
"What! What!" cried Fr. Benoit, "thou art the mad
dest maiden! I marry thy father's captain to thy bower
woman? Get three back to thy roses and let me talk with
In a minute she was on her knees by his side, his
hand In both of hers, and her blue eyes and cooing voice
hard at work.
"O. if I must, I must!" groaned the poor priest.
"O, thou art an angel and a dear," she cried. "I al
ways said thou wert indeed a saint! O, I will pray every
night for thee to be made a bishop!â andâ and promise me
thou wilt marry them this night!"
We both started. "Of a truth," said X, "thy Rosalind
is not more hasty than a cat over the dairy sill."
"To-night." said Fr. Benoit, to show how vain It was
to try to corrupt him, "Is an utterly unsuitable, impossi
"O father! Dost wish me to think thee no better than
a beast? And thou so good. I think my heart will
break'" And a tear fell upon the good priest's hand, a
tear dried directly by a pair of soft lips.
"O, there, there! cried he, blushing very red. "I
promise â I promise to marry the dauphin to the kitchen
maid and thee to the stable boyâ only get thee gone out
of this quiet place! Thou art the wilfullest, most shame
less maid! Get thee gone! I will make thee a discipline
mv next leisure!"
"I will go straightway!" said the Demoiselle Alys,
springing up, with dancing eyes, shaking back her brown
hair with a ripple of laughter. "O, but thou art a very
dear! I wili Bend thee a token to-night, and thou wilt
find Rosalind waiting."
"Am I to give away the bride? I asked. "It will go
hard if I may not attend the weddfcw of my very child?"
She drew" her brows together, btti did not answer me.
"Thou needst not fear, father; there will be horses wait
ing, and the next day who will know if they have been
married or not?"
"Truly, a fine plan!" I could not help saying.
â¢'.Andâ nnd she wiir be very grateful to thee, father, all
her life â andâ andâ that is all I came to say." The
Demoiselle Alys left us without another word,
"Shall we finish the game, father?"
"I have forgot how the pieces stood."
"Rppides. she hath taken the red king." '
"Very true," and he began to fumble his book of hours
for the office of Tierce.
"Rosalind." quoth I, "Is a comely maid to look upon."
"I am not a fool to hear such things." replied tr.
Benoit, very quickly for one intent upon Tierce.
"But it can do thee no harm to hear that she is well
conducted maid, but quiet." He made no answer.
"Well, fatherâ a man can die but onee â but he can be
often whipped."
"I do not see how that concerns me," returned Fr.
Benoit. his eyes on his book.
"Father," I replied, "it is a pleasure to me to en
lighten so apt a scholar. God send thee a life as long as
thy sermons, and somewhat more cheerful. And I went
singing down the stairs to rally monslgneur, and get him
In good trim for his next week's visit from the King.
Beside his chair stood the Sieur d'Audilly, teasing a
great hound. As I came up the hair was beginning to rise
along the creature's bark, and the low thunder to rum
ble in his threat, and the gallant captain pushed him away
with a look of relief that he had me to turn on. "Well,
Cockscomb, where has been crowing now?"
"Over a strange nest, Peacock!"
He drew his brows together, "True, it is midsummer!"
he sneered.
"In midsummer, gossip." said I to monsigneur, "pea
cocks mate wth doves didst know that?"
"Eh? How?" asked he, smiling. But I saw by the
captain's angry eye that I was too careless.
THE RED KING.
A Story of a Fool in Motley.
"The reason of that riddle we will lay before the King Â«
next week," I answered, lamely enough. But he was .<
silent, while the Sieur d'Audilly. talked of a new project^ (
he had for lightening his men's gear. .:â  . "â¢ - â¢ - ~~. aa * â 
It was with a beating heart that, as foon^as the great ,
hall was dark and quiet that night,. up Fr. Benoit s stair (
I sped to find him pacing to and fro like a bear in a pit.
He looked up sharply as I entered, but spoke no word.: <
and I flung mysfTf into his great chair, stretched out my ,
legs and sighed. "Heigho! with such a. chair as this to (
wait in, no wonder thy soul is stored with patience. ::.
"Fool:" said he sharply, "is it quiet below? . . <
"As quiet as thy conscience." â¢â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ ;\- . .-Â«
He ceased walking, and came to me and stood before
me, opening and closing his lips as If he wished to speak; <
his fat face was pale, his lips dry. â  â¢ â  â¢V ' . â¢â¢* <
Before he could find a word, there was a light rap at
the door. I sprang to fling it open, but no one was to be
seen. A small object lay upon the threshold,, and. I <
brought it to the taper's flame and held it for Fr. Benoit i
to see. It was the chessman's fed. king. He put it away .
from him so hastily that it fell and bounded on the floor ..<
and rolled away into a corner. â  â  'â '.â 'â¢ .. \j .--<
"We had best go. down now." said he. I took the i
taper and went before, winding my bauble's head in my :â¢
mantle that the bells might not sound. "..- ' â  . â¢ â â .'â â  :
At the chapel door a woman's figure stood peering for <
. our light. She was wrapped in a long cloak, but the hood
was pushed back, and the taper's flame, lit up, clear ana .
full the comely features of Rosalind. â¢ . â  : <
My heart leaped up, ; and Fr. Benoit drew a long <
breath. ' â  â  â  ; - ' "â  â¢'â¢â¢â¢â¢
*Â» "Let me light thee, good Fool," said Rosalind,: taking <
the taper from my hand. I began a smart speech, put of <
my new learning, about a fair Psyche lighting a sorry
pair of antique Cupidsâ all confused because my heart
was so light. â¢ . . 'â  â  'â¢ â  <
Just as our hands met some one jostled me from be- ,<
hind, and I stumbled against Rosalind, so. awkwardly
that my bauble Jingled sulkily under my cloak, and the
girl, to save herself from falling, dropped the. taper and <
started back. A foot was set on the light and it w(#it- <
out; we were all in the dark till I groped for the chapel â¢
door and flung it open. Even then the light .was dim, and <
I could barely distinguish Rosalind's figure; she had ,
meekly covered her head with her hood on entering the -
chapel, and she did not fling it back, although the Sieur
d'Audilly stepped forth to meet us. So straight .and tall <
and line a gallant he showed, even in the faint light of the ,
chapel, that I could not but wonder again, though 1..'
loved him not. why ho should have stooped for wife to
Rosalind. But then I. being but a fool, had no business .
with that, or "aught else that concerns other men. For a (
fool, look you, is but a caged fox, who pays for his scanty â¢
share of the kennel's leavings by yelping strange praises <
of his trap. â¢â .â 'â¢<
The two went up to the altar rail and. knelt, and Fr.
Benoit came out in surplice and stoke, and motioned me '
forward. Never was bo strange a wedding. No feasting, -...<
no flowers, no gay company, no witness but. one, and- -that--.-;
a fool; the groom a soldier of fortune, and the brideâ o,
may God forgive us for that night's work: ; . -. â â¢;.-. â â 'â¢ '
They were soon married, and we four were again out- -i
side the chapel door, and stealing through the passages of
the chateau that led to the courtyard. For neither Fr.
Benoit nor I were minded to let the young couple, however <
lllmated, go forth into the great world without a word A,
of godspeed nor a hand to wave adieu. â¢ ; - Â«-.-..â¢;.
The great door was guarded by a drowsy man-rat-' '

Lovs: Break tryst and let me out!". . â¢ 'â¢ â  :â . .

dynasty, a period â  . 2500 yearsâ
from 5000. to ZSOO years B. C. The old
est of the pyramids is the so-called
Â£tcp Pyramid of Sakkara, and was
probably built by Zosir, the third King
. I the third dynasty, about 4000 years
li. C.
It is claimed by some authorities to
have been built by Unefes, the fourth
King of the first dynasty. This is shown
to have been quite impossible by the
discovery, a little more than a year

Jacques de Morgau, tomb of

The age of pyramid building did not

time.
The largest of the Egyptian pyramids
Is that of Cheops of the Gizeh group,
and was built by Cheops, the second
King o-f the fourth, dynasty, about 3950
years B. C. It is. the noblest monument
of Egypt, and from its lofty summit
many of the world's greatest rulers,
from its builder to Napoleon, have
looked down upon the most historic
plain of the universe. The pyramid

Mokattarn and granite from Syene. It
and several others were covered with
casing etones, as was the pyramid next
to itâ Oh-efren â built by the king who
succeeded him, some of which still re

removed to â¢ build Cairo, was 482 feet.
Its present height is 451 feet. It covers

where the pyramids and
mounds reach up into the thousands,
they were erected for various uses, and
have been divided into temple mounds,
mounds of sacrifice, mounds of sepul

Bides <>f the sanctuary donr and one
against the back wall of the sanctuary,
contain only hieroglyphics. These are
the largest and most important mural
inscriptions found in America, and are
in the usual style of characters and in
low relief.
In the great ruined cities of Mitla,
Ohichen-Itza, ['xmal, Copan, Tlarolula,
Quiche, Papianpla, Miaantia, Lacqua
mada, Tepotzlan, Xochicalco and Teo
tihuacan, the pyramidal ruins,
crowned with crumbling temples, are
very numerous. It is at Teotihuacan
the most imposing structure on the
continent is to bo found, viz: Pyramid
of the Sun. The photographic views of
it and from it showing in the distance
the Temple of the Moon were made by
Professor Marshall H. Saville, of the
American Museum of Natural History,
one of the eminent authorities on Mexi
can antiquities, as well as explorers.
This is one of the most historic places
in the conquest of Mexico by the Span
lards. It is the opinion of Professor
Saville and others that the city was
destroyed by volcanic eruption, as the
valley and the two great pyramids are
covered with volcanic debris. M. De
sire Charnay, who has given much of
his life to American exploration, thus
describes the Pyramid of the Sun:
"The famous edifices at Teotihuacan,
twenty-five miles from the City of Mex
ico, are still in existence. The two prin
cipal pyramids were dedicated to the
sun and the moon and were taken for
models for building later temples in
this region. That of the sun is the most
considerable, measuring 6SO feet at the
base by ÃBO feet high. Like all greal
pyramids, they were divided Into four
itories, three ol which are still visible,
l.ut the intermediate gradations are al
most effaced.
"A temple stood on the summit of the
larger mound, having a colossal statue
of the sun, made of one single block of
stone. Its bnast had a hollow in which
was placed a planet of fine sold. This
statue was destroyed by Zumarraga,
first Bishop of Mexico, and the gold
!-â¢ -iz. -<1 by the insatiable Spaniards. The
interior of the pyramid is composed of
day ; i ii <l volcanic pebbles, incruste.i on
the surface with light, porous stone,
telzontli; over this was a thick coating
of white stucco, such as was used for
dwelling's.
""Where the pyramid is much defaced,
its incline is from thirty-one to thirty
six degrees, and where the coatings of
cement still adhere forty-seven degrees.
The ascent waÂ« arduous, especially
with a burning sun beating down upon
us, but when we reached the top we
were amply repaid by the glorious view
which unfolded before our enraptured
gaze.
"To the north of the Pyramid of the
Moon is the great 'Path of Death,' with
its tombs and tumuli covering a space
of nine square miles; to the south and
southwest the hills of Tiascala, the
villages of St. Martin and St. Juan, the
snowy top of Iztacclhuatl towering
above the Matlaclnga range, and in the
west the Valley of Mexico, with its
lakes, while far, far away the faint out
line of the Cordilleras was perceptible
in this clear atmosphere. If by an effort
of the imagination we were to recon
struct this dead city, restore its dwell
ings, temples and pyramids, coated
with pink and white outer coatings,
surrounded by verdant gardens, inter
sected by beautiful roads paved with
red cement, the whole bathed in a flood
of sunshine, we should realize the vivid
descriptions of Torquemada.
" 'All the temples and palaces were
perfectly built, whitewashed and pol
ished outside, so that it gave one a real
pleasure to view them from a little dis
tance. All the streets and squares were
beautifully paved, and tfiey looked so
daintily clean as to make you almost
doubt their being the work of human
hands, destined for human feet. Nor
am I drawing an imaginary picture,
for besides what I have been told, I
myself have seen ruins of temples with
noble trees and beautiful gardens full
of fragrant flowers, which were grown
for the service of the temples.' "
This quotation goes far to prove that
the ruins are not so ancient as some
writers have maintained, but that tem
pleÃ and palaces were extant at the
time of the conquest, and that pyra
mids were repaired by the successive oc
cupants of the soil, even during the wars
which a displacement of races natural
ly entailed. The outline of pyramids is
everywhere visible and serves as a bea
con to guide the traveler to the ruins
of Teotihuacan. Besides these there are
some smaller mounds to the south, In
dicating that the ancient city extended
as far as Matlacinga Hill, which
bounds the valley on this side, while
It stretched six miles to the north.
No excavations have been made in
the Pyramid of the Sun, but Max
milian caused extensive excavations to
be made in the Pyramid of the Moon
with the hope of finding treasures and
was disappointed. But little work on
the pyramids has been done. Professor
Saville has found in the pyramids of
Monte Alban tombs, and Mr. Thompson
in Yucatan a few months since exca
vated a pyramid in the center of which
he found an opening below twenty-five
feet deep with human bones, and still
below it another fifty fee* deep with
human bones.

WHEN THE POISON MANIA
HELD SWAY.
famous Instances Suggested by the Dunning Case.
Q
SINCE the Dunning poisoning case
the name of Lucrezia Borgia has
frequently cropped up as being
the arch fiend in that line, but.
modern historians declare that
Lucrezia Borgia has been a very
much maligned woman.
Historical evidence does not support,
the charges of poisoning made against
her, but on the contrary shows that
her life was free from blame. After
her marriage to the Duke of Ferrara's
son her career was prosperous, but un
eventful. She died in 1520, universally
respected and admired for her piety
and prudence and her patronage of men
of letters. Lucrezia Borgia suffered vi
cariously for her father and brothers.
Even if it were true that Lucrezia"
Borgia was guilty of all the crimes she
is generally credited with her record
as a poisoner would pale into insignifi
cance when compared with that of the
Marquise de Brlnvilliers. Yet In the
popular belief the Borgia overshadows
all other masters In the art of secret
poisoning. ââ,,,
It was during the time of Louis XIV
that a reign of terror was inaugurated
in Paris through the instrumentality of
two Italians. A short time prior to
their advent, however, had occurred the
sudden and mysterious death of the
Princess Henrietta, sister of King
Charles II of England and wife of
Monsieur the Duke of Orleans, brother
of the King of France.
On Sunday, June 29, 1669, while at St.
Cloud and in good spirits and In her
usual health, she asked for a cup of
succory water, which she drank, and
after taking dinner she lay down upon
a pile of cushions, soon falling asleep.
Mme. de la Fayette, happening to look
at her. was struck by the livid and
ghastly appearance of her face and
was at a loss to account for the sud
den change In her beautiful counte
nance. At that moment the Princess
Henrietta awoke in great distress and
exclaimed that she was dying. She de
clared that- she had been poisoned, and
at once summoned her confessor. Mean
time she embraced her husband, assur
ing him that although she knew he had
TEMPLE CROWNED PYRAMIDS OF PALENQUE, MEXICO.
long since ceased to love her she was
not in any degree guilty toward him.
Having confessed herself and paj-taken
of the sacrament she retracted the ac
cusation of poisoning, as ?he feared to
cast suspicion upon innocent persons.
She died a few hours afterward. Every
one around her seemed inactive and in
different, with the exception of the
King, wrto insisted that something
should be done for her.
Among those at whom the finger of
suspicion was pointed was her hus
band, with whom she had had a long
conversation just before her fatal ill
ness, and in the course of which some
bitter things were said. The Duke be
came somewhat embittered against her
because she had kept from him the
secret of her mission to England, she
having negotiated with her brother,
the King, that treaty which made him
a dependent and pensioner of France.
King Louis charged him with the mur
der of Henrietta. The Duke de
clared with the most solemn oath that
he was Innocent. The King, still In
doubt, made a strict investigation of
all the circumstances. He discovered
that the succory water, the favorite
drink of the Princess Henrietta, was
kept In a china jug, alongside an
other of pure water, used for diluting
the former. Both vessels stood in a
closet. It was learned also that on the
very day of Henrietta's death the
Marquis d'Effiat, one of the favorites of
the Duke of Orleans, was found in this
closet by a footman, who demanded
his business there. The Marquis, not
losing his presence of mind for an in
stant, calmly replied that his Intrusion
was excusable by reason of his thirst.
Knowing that water was always kept
in the closet, he said, he could not re
sist a drink. The Marquis then passed
into the salon of the Princess, where
he remained for an hour In conversa
tion with his fellow courtiers.
Convinced that Purnon, comptroller
of the Princess' household, must know
something about the mysterious affair,
the King had him brought into his
presence. Under promise of full par
don â so the story has been told â Pur
non confessed that Henrietta was a
victim of poison, sent from Rome by
the Chevalier de Lorraine, with a gen-
Ri named Morel, who
nocent of the nature
of his commission, and by- â¢
whom it was delivered to
the Marquis de Beuvron.
"While Henrietta was dy
ing her husband suggested
that the succory water be
tried on a dog to ascertain
its effect, but Mme. Des
bordes, her first femme de
chambre, said that she had
prepared the drink; she
would prove by swallow
ing a glassful herself that
the water contained no poi
sonous ingredient. She did so, and the
water had no unpleasant effect upon
her. This fact now puzzled the King,
who asked Purnon how he accounted
for this. Purnon replied that the
Marquis d'Effiat, having foreseen the
possibility of just such an occurrence,
had not poisoned the water, but the
Princess' cup by rubbing the poison on
the inside.
Following close upon the tragical
death of Henerietta there came many
others, all in rapid succession, and all
sudden, mysterious and inexplicable.
All attempts to detect foul play failed,
but no one doubted that the instru
ment of death was some subtle poison.
Everybody was terrorized, and no one
felt safe.
At length, under the seal of confes
sion, the Grand Penitentiary of Parts
learned that the mysterious deaths
were due to poison, and he informed
the authorities, who upon investigation
discovered that two Italians, named
Exili and Destinelli, who had bank
rupted themselves in tne vain pursuit
of the philosopher's stone, were en
deavoring to recuperate their fortunes
by compounding and secretly selling
fatal poisons, which left no outward
visible trace. These Italians were im
prisoned in the Bastile, where Desti
nelli soon afterward died. Exilt re
mained in prison, having been convict
ed of nothing more than selling em
pirical drugs for the cure of various â 
diseases and practicing astrology and
divination. HÂ© was given consider
able liberty, and from his prison he
continued to trade in his murderous, se
crets.
It was at this juncture that the Mar
quise de Brinvilliers came Into promi
nence as a poisoner. Her maiden name
was Marie Marguerite d'Aubray,
daughter of Dreux d'Aubray, munici
pal lieutenant of Parts. She was a gay
and beautiful girl when she attracted
the attention of the Marquis de Brin
villiers, who married her in 1651. Some
years later her husband introduced her
to an officer named St. Croix, for whom
she soon conceived an uncontrollable
passion, the result being an intrigue
that was carried on between them for
a long period. It was interrupted tern-

TWO SUCCESSFUL AMERICAN GIRLS IN LONDON
LEONORA JACKSON.
THE war has not furnished the
only example of the triumphal
march of America's children, for
the so-called "American invasion
of England" by our forces dramatic
and musical has been rivaled in en
thusiastic' welcome only by the recep
tion accorded our army In Porto Rico.
In the theater, the concert and the
opera the most appreciated and ap
plauded artists have been Americans
and this is the more remarkable be
cause the conservative English public,
either from excessive patriotism or a
lack of artistic feeling, prefer to honor
their own mediocre talent rather than
acknowledge the genius of unknown
foreign artists. There is no nation so
cold and lacking in knowledge and feel
ing for the arts as the English and
neither Is there a nation that works so
hard to educate itself in these several
branches. That they have improved
Is shown by the appreciation accorded
our representatives which is in direct
contradiction to the reception Delna
received a few years ago. She came
from Paris with a reputation worthy
of her superb voice and a dramatic
ability only equaled but not excelled
by Calve yet London had no praise for
her and she returned to France greatly
disappointed.
The most appreciated of our artists
this year have been for the stage
Annie Russell and for the concert Leo
nora Jackson. These two have suc
ceeded In pleasing not only their audi
ences, but that formidable person, the
London critic.
The London press has called trie at
tention of the English actors to the life
and Â°-o of the American school and ad
vises them to take a few lessons from
their American cousins. Miss Russell
has won for h;nself the name of the
"English Duse," and one of the leading
papers declares that "since Ada Re
han's appearance in London America
has not sent ovÂ«T a more competent
representative ' her dramatic art."
One London paper amusingly criti
cised Miss Russell for pronouncing
miniature "minnyature," and medicine
as a trisyllabic Instead of "medcine,"
which is the lateU English corruption,
and wound up with the remark that
"this probably forms a part of Ameri
ca's system for the improvement and
correction of grandmother's English."
Miss Russell expressed herself as de
lighted with London audiences and the
artistic circle in which she has found
herself. She thinks the audiences quick
In appreciation of detail and is sure of
sympathetic response to any little
touch she may give a character. At the
same time she prefers the 'American
audie -cc that she knows so well and
whose applause has encouraged her in
her work. In spite of the fact that she
has had many tempting offers to re
main permanently in London she has
refused them because she does not wish
to leave America, but she will probably

LEONORA JACKSON, the violinist
whose London success has added
to the laurels already won on the
Continent, was born in Boston
February 20, 1878. Her musi
cal studies were begun In Chi
cago, where the family settled,
and after a veritable triumphal
tour under the patronage of such peo
ple as the Pullmans, the Higalnsons,
of Boston Symphony Orchestra fame;
the Vanderbilts and Mrs. Cleveland, the
talented child went to Paris in 1891, and
was admitted to the Conservatoire, tak
ing second rank In a list of 165 candi
dates.
Dnring a stay of two years In Paris
Bhe appeared before the Grand Duke
Alexis of Russia, besides taking part
in concerts with such artis*ts as Eames
and Plancon. Then she went to Ber
lin to study with Joachim, who received
her at once into his own class at the
Hochschule. where she remained four
years.
Not only was her talent so remarka
ble, but her progress so rapid that in
the autumn of 1896 she made her debut
with the Philharmonic Orchestra of
Berlin, Herr Joachim doing her the
honor to conduct. Her success was in
stantaneous, and shortly afterward she
was asked to play at a special court
entertainment held at the Royal Opera
house, before the Empress ano court.
This was follcnved by a tour through
Germany and last October Miss Jack
son won the Mendelssohn state prize of
1500 marks, which is open to competi
tors of all nationalities, and to singers
as well as instrumentalists. She played
at the Symphonic Society of Cologne
last January, which is such an honor
that artists like Sarasate are glad to
appear without a fee. Not only was
Miss Jackson offered a good fee, but
at the end of the concert, which had
been another triumph for the young
violinist, the president of the society

originally offered.
Not content with this, the society

FRANKS UNGER'S
ENGAGEMENT
ACCORDING to Honolulu opinion
Frank Unger is going to be a
radiant benedict after all. The
blissful depths contained in the
words, "What's mine is yours,
and what is yours is mine," is
after all to be fathomed by the gay and
dashing Frank, who is perfectly filling,
nay even eager, to live up to the first
clause with all the sincerity incidental
to that attendant upon the second.
Yes in spite of all contradictions, it
is said that Frank Unger is going to
be married. There is no change of base,
only a change of lady. And it's all in
the family, for Frank Unger's affec-
Uons are 'said to be concentrated on
his former fiancee's mother. At least

famous Gewandhaus Orchestra at
Leipzig, which Nlkisch ronducts.
She appeared just before her London
debut at a musicale given by Madame
Marehesl in Paris. There she met
Monsieur Lamoureux, in one of whose
concerts she played later on in Lon
don. The London debut was made at
Queen's Hall in February and the en
thusiasm of her reception has only been
augmented at each successive appear
ance.
She assisted Paderewskl tn opening
the Salle Erard, besides performing
with him and Melba at Mr. Astor's
soiree.
It is certainly marvelous to see this
young girl, who does not even look her
20 years, playing with the ease and
skill that many well-known violinists
have worked years to acquire. Her bow
arm Is not less remarkable than her
breadth of tone or the depth of her ex
pression. It is to be regretted she will
not be heard in America for some time,
but her engagements in Germany and
England will prevent.
Miss Jackson says California holds a
particular interest for her, as her father
was a forty-niner and lived there
twenty years. He met his wife in San
Francisco and they were married by
Thomas Starr King.
Miss Jackson was recently asked If
she had any watchword to help her in
her work.

porarily by her father, who sent *St.
Croix to the Bastile by means of a
lettre de cachet.
It so happened that St. Croix was
placed in the same chamber with Exili,
from whom he learned the art of mix
ing poisons. After his lrberation St.
Croix taught the art to the Marquise
de Brinvilliers, with whom secret mur
der soon became a mania. The mem
bers of her own family became her vic
tims. Her motive, if she had any out
side of merely gratifying a strange
passion, was said to be vengeance for
the imprisonment of her lover, or to
obtain possession of the esta4es of her
family. She first practiced, the fatal
art upon her father, permitting him to
die by inches, as it were, as she fed him
the poison during a period of eight
months. Perhaps so much time was
occupied in disposing of her father to
avoid the suspicion that might attach
to a more sudden death. She then put
an end to her two brothers, and next
attempted the life of her husband, who,
however, was saved by antidotes given
him by St. Croix.
Although St. Croix did not scruple to
waste in extravagance the paternal In
heritance of his mistress, he was not
willing to become her husband, and
and Aunt Lizzie knows it full well; and
this lends zest to her pastime of get
ting off good stories. When Aunt Lizzie
likes, she loves indeed, and when she
hates she's a three-volume-novel ene
my. Aunt Lizzie likes Frank Unger,
so" they say. "His company Just suits
me; we get along perfectly Jolly to
gether," she has asserted many times,
but until lately nobody thought to qup.s
tfon in what capacity. When Frank
Unger laden with floral leis stood
upon the deck of the steamer and
waved good by to Hawaii nei. on his
last visit to the islands in 1897, he felt
that the girl he left behind him was the
only girl deserving of a training that
would give her the proud distinction of: â 
rivaling the <>wl in all night wake- ;
fulness, preliminary to his welcome
home from a Bohemian Club jinks.
And as the steamer slowly sailed out of
the sunny harbor of Honolulu, he un
twined a lei from around his hat and
threw it at the feet of Helen Wilder
with an aloha which rang with all the
intensity of a poetic temperament.
After a few months' correspondence
Frank Unger announced his engage
ment to this belle of Hawaii. He bade; :
farewell to the Bohemian Club and to.
all the comoanions of the red room,
and the owl room and to all the ad
juncts of gay Bohemia, and he gave
his last bachelor dinner and he set sail
for the coral reefed shores of Hawaii,
for the waving cocoanut tr^es and the
palm lined avenues of his future home. â 
And the wedding day was set for June
10, 1898. The Bohemian Club sent their
congratulations and a handsome pres
ent, and the happy couple were too far
away to realize the accompanying sigh
for a weak and straying comrade.
The courtship waxed apace.. Frank
Unger declared that in the originality
of his lady lovo lay the charm which
placed her at the head of all the girls
in all the lands he had visited in his
various trips around the world as pri
vate secretary to Harry Gillig.
An heiress can afford to be original
and Hc-len Wilder has $500 a month in
her own name. She is boyish in man
ner, boyish in appearance "and boyish
in action. Her hair is cropped close,
she walks with a stride and often an
accompanying whistle, and she wears
a man's hat, without a quill. Besides
she is abrupt and she calls, a spade a
spade with a frankness almost alarm
ing. â¢;; â¢â /,â . .
A lovely cottage at Waikikl was built
for the young couple-, the Invitations
were out and then Helen Wilder, took
a professional nurse and sailed for San
Francisco. ' â¢ â ; : ;.'â¢ : ;
The months passed and Helen wflder
did not return.
Then one day Frank Unger dis
covered'a mine in Mexico, He told
"Aunt Lizzie " that he would go and
work the mine. And when he married
he would not have to. feel that his wife
was supporting him; And "Aunt Liz
zie" smiled and sighed; the .smile was
for his ambition and the sigh was for
his loss. . ';'.'" : "â â 'â  ---.' â 'â¢'â 
Once more Frank Unger stood upon
the deck of the steamer and waved
adieu to Hawaii nei, and at the feet of .
"Aunt Lizzie" he threw a lei of the
sweet-scented maili. "Aunt Lizzie"
picked it up and she carried it home
and sprinkled it until it was hopelessly
faded and then she dried it in the sun
and treasured the faded souvenir.
Frank Unger is, with the mine in
Mexico and San Francisco, from where,
it is said, he carries on as lively a cor
respondence with "Aunt Lizzie " as the
steamers to Hawaii will permit.
Helen Wilder explains, that she does
not love Frank Unger any; the less, but
only she likes independence the more.
"Aunt Lizzie" says that Helen is too
delicate to go to Mexico; that she her
self needs a trip; that .she will not
persuade her daughter to .marry : any
man., no matter how congenial he may
be to her. Everybody knows that
Frank Unger is a prince of good fal
lows, and Honolulu winks the other
eye. â  â¢ â¢ . : . \ â¢ . :.'â 
hence, to prevent her from demanding
such a thing, he kept the Marquis de
Brinvilliers alive. . :
The Marquise added her sisters to the
list of her murders, and is credited also
with having administered- poison to a
number of other persons in no way
connected with her family; She is said
to have reveled in a, sort of insane
pleasure in thus destroying' her fellow
creatures. She carried poisoned cakes
and food to the sick In Hospitals, and
also distributed them among the poor,
her object seeming to nave been to as
certain the exact effect of the poisons
upon persons whose sudden death was
not likely to create suspicion.
St. Croix became the victim of his
own criminality,, dying suddenly in 1672
from the effects of accidentally breath
ing the effluvia of a poison which he
was preparing. Among his papers were
found some that pointed to the guilt of
his mistress, who fled to England and
afterward resided for: some time in
Liege, where she was captured. In
searching her a general: confession was
found on her person, which, though
not received as actual proof against
her by the judges, furnished the means
of discovering sufficient evidence of her
crimes to convict her beyond all doubt.
She was sentenced to. be beheaded and
to have her body burned, and this sen
tence was carried out in Paris July 16,
1676. The poison used by her is thought
to have been common arsenic.
The execution Of the Marquise de
Brinvilliers did not check these terrible
crimes. The mania .seemed to spread
more rapidly than, ever.. : â  â .-'."â 
The police, who were kepi busy in in
vestigating the .mysteries, found that
the madness, which had originally de
veloped among the. higher classes,, had
infected the kwyef ranks, even the peas
antry. Death was everywhere. No
â one knew whope-tiirn would come next.
Friends became 'â  suspicious of each
other; fathers mistrusted their sons;
wives had no confidence in their hus
bands; rivals in love were never at
ease; a state of dreadful unrest pre
vailed throughout Paris. The police
finally secured evidence that the traf- -
fie in these poisonous drugs was car
ried on principally, by a. woman named
La Voisin,. in company with two priests,
Le Sage and D'Avaux, an^l another wo
man called La Vlgorisaux.
La Voisin #as' a popular fortuna
teller who had among her clients the
nobiljty of Paris. She had conceived
the idea of predicting to the expectant
heirs the exact date- of the death of
their wealthy relatives, . arid having her
predictions fulfilled by means of poison.
She was so successful in this occupa
tion that she" was- compelled to "take
into her confidence and partnership the
two priests " and La', Vigoreaux. who
was also a fortune teller! The poisons
that they sold were called "succession
powders," truly a most significant
name. â  : .: " â  . : . â  : : ;-./ '.

MEW YORK., Oct. Lâ Is the time

â¢ It may be said that where a separate
waist is worn the waist will be plaid.
. â¢ This is an almost universal rule. It is
â  a. common eight to see a plain black,
brown, green or blue skirt trimmed only
:by regulation trimmings, worn with a
. glaring waist of most brilliant plaid de

These waists are now and then made
of plaid silk, but more often of cloth,
for it must be acknowledged that the
cloth holds Its color better than silk
. and can be worn to better advantage.

men much prefer it to silk.
The colors in these plaids are red

Bay the colors of the spectrum, violet,

was made in polonaise shape with the

of cuirassier blue Bilk trimmed at the

flowers, golden rod and chrysanthemums.
The chrysantnemums are very small, al
most like asters.
The collars of the new street dresses
are very tall and rolling; they are de
cided Medicis, many of them standing
higher than the- ears. They set out a
little from the neck, and are not secured
at the throat. This gives a decidedly ma
jestic appearance to the wearer, and is
a beautiful addition to the costume.
The man who walks with the autumn
woman must not be forgotten; he, too,
has his fashions. This year they are pret
tier than usual. In the morning he is
very English in a pair of light trousers
and a double breasted frock coat of navy
blue. These double breasted frock coats
are also made of gray cloth and recently
one appeared on Fifth avenue made of
dark green. U *Â».
The very same day, as though the
wearer had been previously informed of
coming paragraphs, there appeared an
article in one of the men's fashion papers
statin* that the Prince of "Wales had
worn a double-breasted sack coat on the
occasion of his recent drive. The Prince.
in his convalescence, had decided to take a
short ride on land and his costume was a
pair of light trousers, a short double
breasted sack coat of dark green cloth
and a derby.
One of the witty writers, perhaps it Is
Jerome K. Jerome, says that a sack coat
with a silk hat are common in America,
but in England they are events. It is al
most unnecessary to say that silk hats
should never be Worn with any but the
long coat, and only the dignified Prince
Albert is permissible with the Bilk hat,
unless, indeed, it be worn with an over
coat or other long garment.
There is a new coat for men called the
raglan. This Is long, in fact, It is an over
coat, rather full in the skirt; but it is an
Informal coat. It is worn for coaching
and for the promenade; the suitable hat
with it is the derby.
The raglan is made of dark cloth and it
is single-breasted. It can only be cut out
by the best tailors, but it is the fashion
able coat of autumn. Men who have sev
eral coats are .ordering the raglan, the
single-breasted light cloth overcoat, the
long double-breasted black cloth overcoat
of light weight and the short black over
coat. But men who are content with one
coat arc buying overcoats of medium
length, double-breasted and of very light
weight. "Men's coat sleeves are somewhat
padded to make them very square shoul
dered. As women's shoulders' grow
smaller men's seem to grow larger..
A woman's sleeves are so modified this
year that you scarcely notice them except
for their trimmings, whereas a man's
shoulders arc so square that you wonder
if he has been in training.

MY correspondence has assum
ed such alarming proportions
that I have decided to say
just a word or two about
beauty in general to-day, and
to devote most of my space to answer
ing letters.
I hope that no one has gathered the
idea from these beauty talks that I am
an advocate of beauty culture to the
exclusion of all else. There is no doubt
at all about it that a pretty woman
1b 'quite the most winsome thing that
ever was created, and yet a beautiful
woman, whose only thought is the en
hancement and preservation of her phy
sical charms to the utter neglect of those
qualities of mind and disposition which
at once attract even when unaccompa
nied by beautiful features, is like a rose
without perfume â whose charm is gone
when its petals are faded. I really have
no use whatever for the girl who puts
in half her time fussing and fretting over
her complexion and bemqanlng the fate
that gave to her stiff, straight hair which
positively refuses to stay In curl these
damp, foggy nights, while her brother
has naturally curly hair that he Is hav
ing perfect spasms over, trying to get
the kink out of.
One can be beautiful without wasting
one's life in the effort. Half an hour each
morning is quite sufficient time in whfch
to take the sponge bath, cleanse the
teeth, dress the hair and manicure the
nails. At night in fifteen minutes the
hair can be brushed and plaited, the face
and hands well washed and massaged
with a little cold cream, and the teeth
again cleaned.
Of course if the hair is to be shampooed
or some particular portion of the body to
be massaged, then a little more time is
necessary. This much time spent upon
the daily toilet is worth While and will
repay one, but in the effort to acquire
beauty do not forget that the most im
portant thing of all is a bright, active
mind.
I have in my mind the picture of a
woman I once knew. I can see her now
as she stepped briskly along upon her
little journey in the world. She belonged
to what is known as the smart set, and
yet she had a keen and active sympathy
in all matters touching the lives of those
wh.> toiled and spun. Whether her foot
.stt-ps.tended to the haunts of thoae who
made pk-asure their watchword, or to the
byways of life, where privation, suffering
and need raised their feeble heads, to
them all she gave generously of her
store. To the one she gave the thoughts
of an Intelligent mind, to the others a
kindly word, a, nod of encouragement or
out. but they are for the moment sub
sidiary to the painted ones.

A quaint situation was provided at a
recent dinner party in London. The menu
bore the announcement "Pommes a l'lr
lande, 168j," and the dish resolved itself
into potatoes in their jackets, put on the
table In a silver dish, surrounded by a
pierced silver circle evidently of great
antiquity. The host had bought a potato
ring at a sale of Irish antiques, and wish
ed to show how potatoes were eaten at
the date engraved on the ring. Each
guest was invited to choose his own po
tato, which was gravely eaten. Then
the tableful went back to larks in aspic
and other latter-day dainties, and thank

the contents of a not too lavishly filled
purse. Her gown was spotless always,
her hair glossy and well cared for. Her
brows were not penciled nor her cheeks
rouged. She "was merely a healthy, ac
tive, well-built woman, whose face, al
though possessing no particular regular
ity of feature, was so resplendant with
sweet womanliness, kindness and unsel
fishness that to me she was the most
beautiful woman I have ever seen.
So while you are correcting facial de
fects at the same time correct those of
the disposition and character. Clear out
the dark corners of the heart and let in
the sunshine of cheerfulness, thus chasing
all shadows and incidentally wrinkles
from the face.
Read tho thoughts of superior minds,
and your face will unconsciously reflect
the beauty of these thoughts, ami an in
tellectual graeiousness will take the
place of that apathetic expression born of
unawakened interest in aught save per
sonal adornment, which mars the other
wise perfect faces of so many women.
Think of others oftener than of yourself,
cultivate a gracious manner, a low, well
modulated voice, a mind well informed
upon all the topics of the day. and live a
correct and hygienic life, and, although
the classic features of the Grecian statues
may not be yours, the mantle of beauty
will surely descend and adorn your
shoulders. And yours will be a beauty
more substantial and less evanescent than
that which mere beauty of feature alone
can give.

FROCKS OF

<jn& REVIVAL, of an old fashion was
//.AN seen in, a smart gown made of
ll bright bandana handkerchiefs of
red and yellow, notes a New York
chronicler; of fashions. The skirt, cut
wKh the shaped front and wide flounce,
was . effective, as the handkerchiefs
showed the style to great advantage.
The waist was tight-fitting at the back,
but in front had a blouse. There was a
square yoke and V-shaped front of tucked
white mousseline de aoie, and belt and
collar of black satin, with a turned-down
collar, of white embroidery and lace. The
hat- worn with this gown was a black
fancy straw, trimmed with a big bow
across the front of black satin ribbon and
a long buckLe-of rhinestones. The entire

it is far better without any trimming or
color; but blue, pink or yellow looks very
well with it. It Is becoming more and
more the mode to veil one tone with an
other, and we are certain to have more
and more demand for neutral shades,
which is all very well for the pretty
woman but not so acceptable to the mass
of the community.'

but if faithfully persevered in there

ELIIINIAâ In answer to your first ques
tion I must refer you to the foregoing re
ply to Millie Brown. If you will follow
the directions given in Sunday's Call of
September 18 you will surely be
able to rid yourself of ' the.
bothersome blackheads. After using
"everything you. ever heard of" upon
your face, I do not wonder that your com
plexion is in such a state/ . Never un
der any circumstances use anything upon
the face the ingredients of which you do
not know. Â«,â¢' - ...'-â  .. :

dipped in olive oil. The only certain
treatment for "hang nails" Is to cut them
off close with sharp scissors, and then let
the wound heal under a tiny piece of
court plaster. Never pull these little
pieces of skin off, for intense pain will
be the result, and the evil worse than it
was before.
BIRDIE T. Z.â The following cold
cream I think you will find satisfactory:
Spermaceti, % ounce; white wax, *4
ounce; oil of sweet almonds, 2Yz ounces;
rosewater, four-fifths ounce; powdered
borax, 10 grains; essence of clover, 3
drops. Try the sage tea for your hair.
Take a handful of the leaves and boil
them into a tea. Add two tabiespoonfuls
of alcohol to the quart and use this as
you would any tonic, applying it to the
roots of the hair just before going to
bed at night. Then every two or three
weeks shampoo the head with the yolk
of one egg we!l beaten up In one ounce
of rosemary spirits and one pint dis
tilied water. Rinse well in several yrS.
ters after using. To obtain the develop
ment you desire I would advise you to
go to work and fatten the entire body.
This can he dtme by strict attention to
the diet and abstaining from all worry.
Eat all the starchy, fattening foods, such
as rice, butter, cereals, eggs, milk and
game. Hot chocolate and preserved figs
are good to increase flesh. Get all the
sleep you can, and the last thing at
night and the first thing in the morning
take a cup of hot milk. Take tepid baths
and exercise moderately. A teaspoonful
of olive oil taken several times a day
and frequent rubbings of the body with
olive oil will help. The only way to
bring a natural color into the cheeks and
lips is to get some of the roses of health.
Wines and beer have an especial tendency
toward producing pimples and black
heads, and should therefore be rigidly
excluded from the dietary.
M. T. HENRYâ It Is an exceedingly
risky matter to experiment with so deli
cate an organ as the eye, and I should
advise you to consult a first-class oculist.
CLARAâ- The skin food should be nrm
and smooth. Of course it is better to vse
the exact proportions given, still the mis
take that you made will not detract from
its virtue unless you used too much of the
benzoin. I should not advise more than a
teaspoonful. If the pores are clogged I
would not advise you to use the lotion yet:

grams; oil of mace, 1 gram. Anoint
the scalp every night, rubbing it well
into the roots and taking care not to get
it on the hair shafts, as it will make the
hair very oily.
G. A. M.â l do not happen to have, in
my very large collection of formulas, one
for the hair tonic you ask for. It -Is 'â¢
nearly always Jamaica rum that is used
for these things. Why not ask your
druggist for the proportions? There is
not the slightest danger of benzoin used,
as I have directed making hair grow on
the face.
T. M. P. S.â As the cocoanut oil has
not been efficacious suppose you try tha
following, which is very fattening: One
ounce each of lanoline, cocoanut oil arid
cocoa butter. Warm the palms of . . the â¢
bands slightly be-fore beginning the-ihas<
sage, and rub around and arohnd and
up. Keep it up for ten or fifteen minutes.
In the morning dash cold water on the
breast. If you wear pads or tight cloth
ing the massage will be of no use. It
must be accompanied by a diet of fatten-*
ing foods.
AVELYX- The ointment for the eye
lashes must be applied very carefully,' â¢
for it will inflame the eyes if it gets into'
them, as any oil will. Barely dampen
your brush in it and apply from the
outer side. Ir you cannot use it wlthont â 
its getting into your eyes discontinue it. : â¢
BIRDIE GOODâ The electric needle, is
the only thing that will permanently re
move superfluous hair, and this is' not
practicable save where the hairs are
coarse or scattered. Peroxide' of hydro
gen, if applied to .the hairs, will lighten
tnem so that they will be scarcely" per- â 
ceptible.
LEONIE W.â For the red hands use
lemon juice, but be sure to rub well with
a good cold cream as soon as the juice is
dry. Otherwise the skin will become
harsh and rough and in a condition to

B] oil them as specimens to take off the
many layers of wrapping; and it is not

animal mummies, and we know that
the Egyptians embalmed more cats
than any other animal, for the reason
that cats were more plentiful than any
other animal, so I thought one was prob

Judged from its size and shape to be a
young crocodile.
"They were given to the museum by
a Mr. E. Hartman some time last year,
and where he obtained them, or where
they came from, in Egypt, I have no
idea."
So much for all the information ob
tainable as to the mummies. But I
am a curious person, and I wanted to
know what animals were really in
clost-d in the wrappings, put on so
many years ago by the devout priests
of old Egypt. For many animate were
held sacred in those days of the build
ing of the pyramids. The cat was sup
posed to be the embodiment of the sun
god, or Ra, as well as the representa
tive of the goddess Diana, and they
held to the poetic fancy that the cat's
eyes changed in color with the change
in place of the sun during its passage
through the sky. But the adoration
of animals was not confined to the cat.
We find evidence that as many as
twenty-eight species of mammals, not
to speak of various varieties of birds,
fishes, reptiles, beetles, visionary ani
mals and plants, were held sacred. To
be sure, the same animal was not al
ways regarded as sacred throughout
the whole land, and that was largely
the cause of Egypt's undoing: for the
different cities waged war among them
selves on account of the fact that the
sacred animal of one city was served
on the table of the citizen of another
city., Three or four kinds of monkeys
were given divine honors and their
place of greatest worship was at
Thebes.
The Egyptians believed most thor
oughly in a future life and a future life
of the body as well as of the soul, so
they endeavored to preserve the bodies
of their dead and in their efforts dis
covered the art of embalming. Thfs

tion. She was loudly applauded and en
cored, and when she made an allusion to
the Tennessee boys she -brought down me
house. There was a programme of dances
after the show, and the expression on the
faces of those who participated seemed to
say, "It may rain, but we are out of the
wet and are going to enjoy ourselves."
And they did.
The same night Templar
Lodge had a social in the same building,
and the attendance was good. Mesdames
Warford, Edwards and Dowele and
Messrs. Brower, Ferretti and Jeffries Jr.
(the committee on social hour) presented
a programme of dances, and by way of
divertisement had recitations by Mrs.
Dowele and K. McLeod and a humorous
speech by Mr. Jeffries Jr. The member
snip and friends spent a very pleasant
evening, for it was a homelike gathering.
The home for ornhans at Gilroy now has
twenty-seven inmates. There are now in
the library of the home more than 2000
books, contributed by the several lodges
of the State. The spare ground around
has been planted with vegetables, and.
very high degree, the result being so
perfect that the bodies of men who
have been dead for five or six thousand
years are still perfectly preserved.
They first cleaned out the contents of
the abdomen and chest, filled these
cavities with spices and raisins and
sometimes with bitumen, and then
soaked the body for seventy days in a
solution of "natrum," or subcarbonate
of soda; this pickled it most effectually,
in fact it really tanned the tissues al
most as thoroughly as we tan leather.
Naturally if they were so careful to
preserve the bodies of dead mortals
they would be no less anxious to save
from decay the bodies of the animals
they had, in life, worshiped as gods.
So they embalmed the bodies of the
dead animals, and held over them most
elaborate funerals â funerals that were
sometimes so gorgeous and expensive
as to bankrupt the person whose duty
it was to take care of these sacred ones.
And indeed we read in Herodotus, who
visited Egypt about 450 years before
the Christian era, that when the armies
were on the march they would embalm
and bring home to Egypt to be buried
the bodies of the sacred animals, even
when the bodies of the men had to be
left behind.
The same author tells us that the
best kind of embalming cost a talent
of silver, or about $1250. There were
cheaper sorts, but this was the most
expensive and the most desirable.
Bearing all this in mind and stin
doubting the identity of the animals
in the Park Museum I was anxious to
know what they were. I asked Mr.
Wilcomb If I might make an X-ray
picture of these mummies and thus
settle the matter.
He was very kindly disposed to the
idea and indeed said that he, too, would
be glad to know what they really were.
So I obtained the loan of the sacred
mummies for a day or two and made
the picture which accompanies this
article.
It was with a pleasantly nervous sen
sation of excitement that I developed
the photographic plate and looked to
see what I had found. The fact of
finding out what was inside these
wrappings, put on so many thousand
years ago, without disturbing them in
the least and in a way that would fill
the soul of an Egyptian (could he come
to life and see it) with terror, whs
enough to develop in me somewhat of
a thrill of excitement.
The hand was of course very plain,
â¦hope have In a measure supplied the
wants of the inmates.
Recently there were received at the
home from Solano County eight children
of one family, the father and mother hav
ing died within a short time of each other.
The oldest child is 11 years old and the
youngest 6 months. Only for the home
the little ones would have been thrown
on the cold charities of the world.
The entertainment that was given
by Mission Rebekah Lodge on the
evening of Saturday, September 24.
in Excelsior Hall, was, despite the
rain, attended by a large number of
members and friends, who wen- treated
to an enjoyable programme. There was
a piano solo by Frank Norman, vocal solo
by Miss Jennie. Wimmer, violin solo by
Howard Green, vocal solo by Miss Ro
sina Rocine, whose singing wos highly
appreciated, as demonstrated by the vo
ciferous applause with which It was re
ceived. The closing number was a recita
tion by Mr. Herzog. Then followed danc
ing which was kept up until midnight,
when "Home, Sweet Home" gave notice
that It was time to separate.
ANCIENT ORDER OF WORKMEN.
San Leandro Lodge No. 12 was the re
cipient of a fraternal visit from Oakland
brethren on the 24th ultimo. The feeling
of fraternity was well exemplified. A
worthy example was set by the brothers
of the various lodges of Oakland that
should be followed by all the lodges of the
State.
A public meeting will be held October
27 by Folsom Lodge, on which occasion
the master workman, H. L. Luttrell, will
deliver a lecture setting forth the advant
ages of the order. The screen work will
also be given for the entertainment of the
friends of the lodge.
To-morrow a new lodge of the order will
be organized by Special Deputy C. Z. Sut
ton at Whittler, near Los Angeles.
Special Deputy D. E. Saunders is es
tablishing a new lodge at Rio Msta.
Deputy Saunders met with a painful ac
cident, being thrown from a buggy and
dislocating his collarbone.
Special Deputy R. F. Wells has returned
to Los Angeles and proposes to canvass
that city thoroughly for membership.
Plumas Lodge was instituted at Cres
cent Mills. Piumas County, on the 24th
inst. by Special Deputy R. D. Maplesden,
making the seventh lodge instituted by
this zealous deputy.
A class of fifty applicants for the de
grees of the order in the lodges of Sacra
mento Is almost completed by Special
Deputy William A. Imes.
Arrangements are being made for the
organization of a new lodge at the coal
mining town of Tesla, Alameda County.
A large force of men are employed in the
coal mines, a large portion of whom are
anxious to become members of the A. O.

other entertainment in the near future
and have invited Past Grand Master
Workman William Vinter and Grand Re
ceiver Sam Booth to be present.
Valley Lodge of this city conferred the
degrees on a class of five candidates on
Wednesday evening last, making an in

ises to be a very Interesting one. It will
be fiven in Excelsior Hall.
The proceedings of the Superior Lodge,
bound in purple and gold, have been re
ceived at the office of the grand recorder.
The charter list for the new lodge to be
established in this city has received a
number of signatures.
The drill team of Ivy Lodge has been
reorganized and Grand Recorder Mrs. K.
S. Poland has been retained as captain.
Quite a number of applications have
lately been received for the beneficiary
feature of the order.
THE NATIVE SONS.
H. H. Briggs of San Jose has extended
an invitation to California Camp of the
Degree of the Argonauts to visit the Gar
den City during the current month for
the purpose of conferring the popular de
gree on a number of the Native Sons of
that place.
THE NATIVE DAUGHTERS.
The Native Daughters' Board of Relief,
composed of fifteen past grand presidents
and leading members of the order, has
been organized to supplement the work of
the subordinate parlors in caring for the
sick and destitute who are members of
the order. It has now on hand a small
fund with which to inaugurate the work
it is to engage in, the result of donations
from nubile spirited friends of the Native
Daughters and from contributions from
subordinate parlors. It is the ardent de
sire of the board to establish a Native
Daughters' Home in San Francisco, where
the sick can be taken care of in the best
possible manner and at the least possible
cost. Fifteen of the leading physicians
of this city, representing both schools,
have already volunteered their services
free to the home. This home will be
opened by the board as soon as it is as
sured of sufficient funds to maintain it In
running order for one year. The board
has invited Past President Clara K. Wit
tenmeyer, secretary of Mills College,
to co-operate with the board in its efforts
to raise the necessary fund. There is
some talk of giving an entertainment for
the purpose. Alta Parlor, at a recent
meeting, at the suggestion of Grand Trus
tee Miss Eliza D. Keith, voted $100 from
its treasury to the board. This may stim
ulate other parlors to make donations.
At the last held meeting of Golden
State Parlor there was an exemplification
of the work for the benefit of District
Deputy Grand President Mrs. Q. Baker,
who commended the officers for the man
ner in which the work was done. Presi
dent Mrs. C. Day has returned after a
but that was known without the X
rays; the small crocodile proved to be
part of a human mummy; one of the
animals, the lower one, showed that it
was evidently a cat, though it had been
so badly handled that all its bones are
broken; still it is recognizable as a cat.
But what is the other animal? It
seems to have no tail, and the shape of
the skull, of the arms and of the bones
of the backbone and pelvis show that
it probably is not a cat. Then what is
it? That is not so easy to tell, for it
has some resemblances to a number of
animals. The arm, from shoulder to
hand, is longer than is generally the
case in cats, and the upper bone, or the
one called the humerus, is straighter
than in the cat; there seem to be thirty
three bones in the spine, whereas the
cat has but twenty-seven; the skull is
more arched, not so flat and lacks the
sharp projecting ridge at the back
which is a noted characteristic of the
cat's skull; there is but little difference
in the length of the arm and the fore
arm, while in the cat the arm is much
shorter than the forearm; the hand,
too, seems to have longer fingers than
are to be found in the forepaw of the
cat.
I have carefully examined both the
photographic plate and the prints made
from it, and I can find nothing that
would look at all like tail bones. The
ends of the bones of the arm are seen
to be not united to the shaft of the
bone â what is technically called an un
united epiphysis, which would show
that the animal, whatever it is, had
not reached its full growth. Now it
would have measured not less than
seventeen inches, from head to the root
of the tail if tail there had been, in life,
and this is a good length for a cat that
is not full grown.
In many ways it would seem to bÂ«*
more like a young monkey than a cat,
though the particular features that
would stamp it a monkey are uncer
tain. We know that the Egyptians had
at leapt three kinds of sacred monkeys,
and that at least one of these was a
tailless monkey. And the monkey, at
Thebes, was regarded as more sacred
than the cat, so the greater care in the
wrapping would be explained if it were
a monkey; it is certainly more carefully
wrapped than the other animal, which
is evidently a cat. I am rather in
clind to think the animal was a monkey
of some sort and not a cat. But if it
is a cat it is evident that there existed
cats at that time which differed some
what from the cats we have to-day.
DR. PHILLIP MILLS JONES.
Destroying One of the Oldest Buildings in the State.
MONTEREY, October I, IS9B.â Vandalism has sprung
up afresh in this quaint town and this time it is
the old Spanish jail that is to go. A gulch on
California street needs filling' up and the curious
old adobe structure, one of the most picturesque
of all Monterey's old-time bu.ldings, is to supply the
necessary dirt.
Already the work of demolition has begun, busy hands
having been for two days ruthlessly tearing the heavy red
Mexican tiles from the roof and palling down the great
pine beams and joists fastened together with rawhide
thongs, substantial enough yet to stand another hundred
years, and so firmly set that nothing but the greatest ex
ertion can separate them from their sun-baked masonry.
The historical building stands at the back of the old
Abrego store, almost surrounded by buildings of various
kinds, and can only be seen from the alleyway by â which
it Is entered. On this account it has rarely been seen by
tourists who were looking up the queer places of this an
cient capital. Until the committee in charge of arrange
four -weeks' visit In Santa Clara County,
and Past President Miss 1,. Fahrenkrug
has returned after having spent a vaca
tion of five weeks in Sonoma County and
vicinity.
Or<> Finn Parlor has arranged to give
a grand ball in Native Sons' Hall on next
Thursday night in aid of the new board
of relief." The object is a most deserving
one, and it should receive the financial
encouragement not only of the members
of the order but of every one who would
like to see the home for Native
Daughters Â« stablished at an early day.
The committee from Las Lomas Parlor
has completed its arrangements for the
military german to be given on the night
of the*2lst of October in celebration <>f
the sixth anniversary of the institution of

AMERICAN GUILD'S PARTY.
The entertainment and hop that was
given in Native Sons' Hall by San Fran
cisco Chapter of the American Guild last
Friday night was attended by a very
large number of people, the majority of
whom were not members of the order.
The hall was most tastefully decorated,
and, taken as a whole, the affair was one
of the finest that has been given in this
hall in many a month. The very choice
programme that was presented included
an overture by Mearn's orchestra; Chi
nese impersonation and musical bottles,
E. J. Brown, each a fine performance;
vocal selections by the Arcadian quartet.
Miss May Cullen. Miss Edith Hanks, .Miss

ter which Dr. E. W. Pratt recited "The

AMERICA.
On Thursday night, October 6, Palo Alto
Circle will have an entertainment In
Union-square Hall, on which occasion
THE RAINBOW'S END.
Interesting Book on Alaska and
Tales for Travelers and
Stay-at- Homes.
As a list of clever, carefully studied de
scriptive writing "The Rainbow's End" is
a good book. Mrs. Henderson knows how
to express herself and has a keen insight
for the unusual. She feels that which
would appeal to most of us on our first
visit to a strange land and puts it into
such language as can be readily grasped
by the average mind. Her book is read
able and interesting.
Mrs. Henderson discovered, among
other things, that KlondiKe cooking waÂ»
not all that it might have been, and also
that manners in Dawson City lack re
pose. Gum-boot Annie, Muk-luk Lizzie, -
Cannibal Ike and Calamity Bill and other
aristocrats of Dawson wore free and fa
miliar in their manifestations rather than
reserved; and their conduct in what Mrs.
Henderson calls the mazy dance was
scarcely up to that standard lixed by po
lite writers. In the Dawson dance halls.
Mrs. Henderson tells us, "every waltz
costs a dollar, and is short, so that as
many as possible may be crowded in be
fore the (lancers shall be too drunk to es
say further participation."
As for Klondike cookingâ it is a thing
to make the angels weep. Even Boston
beans are beyond the Klondike's ken,
and it is really pathetic to see the clum
sy, helpless miners trying to prepare
their food and yearning for the flesh pots
of Egypt, while the provision market is
liable to sudden and unavoidable "cor
nerings," as in the case of "Swiftwater
Bill." who took his name from his cheer
ful habit of making money flow like wa
ter, and who bought up every egg of the
first invoice last spring for $900 to spite
a woman and prevent her having some
for breakfast. "I tell you." says the au
thor, "there's going to be an army of
contented men back in these States in
two or three years who will eat any
thing put before tthem, even to crow,
with an appetite, an absence of grum
bling, and a sense of deep gratitude
which will be touching to behold. No need
of killing the fatted calf for them. 'Any
old thing will do for me. and thank you.'
And when the men realize that they do
ments for the semi-centennial anniversary of the Ameri
can occupation of California in July, 1896, discovered the
old place and put a signboard upon it telling its name and
age many of the Monterey residents did not know it as a
relic of the Spanish rule. Th? structure is a genuine
adobe, its walls being made of the huge sun-baked blocks
of clay after the primitive style without the chalk rock
that later experience taught ?'ontereyans to use for the
first six or eight feet of their adobe houses, and is a com
modious, strongly built and comparatively comfortable
prison.
It was built in 1806, when Monterey was the govern
mental residence and chief military post of the province of
Alta California. It was first a sort of military prison,
but afterward degenerated into a common jail, as such
being used until a comparatively recent date.
Some of the most noted prisoners of California's early
troublous times have been incarcerated between its sub
stantial walls, and with its demolition passes another of
the few remaining reminders of Monterey's old position as
the leading town in Alta California.
there will be presented a farce, the char
actors being- assumed by members of the
circle. That will be followed by a pro
gramme of dances.
Mizpah Circle will give nn entertain
ment in its hall on the night of the 11th
of October. The circle meets in the Po
trero Opera-house, and the committee
that has charge of the affair promises a
programme that will be worth the time
spent in going the long distance to wit
ness it.
Inter Nos Circle had a very pleasant
social hour Wednesday night after the
close of the meeting, a number of home
games being inaugurated. After that cof
fee and cakes were served.
SEVEN PINES CIRCLE.
The open meeting of Seven Pines Cir

Miss Shuck and Miss Schaffer, vocal so
los by Mr. Mahor.ty, Mrs. Ida Leroi,
Corporal Christy and Sergeant Morris,
recitations by Miss Bessie Harvey and
Sergeant Bailey, and vocal selections by
a quartet composed of Messrs. Mahoney,

Though the author devotes perhaps a
disproportionate amount of space to the
backslidings of Gum-boot Annie and her
frail sisterhood, she writes at all times
entertainingly. In speaking of St. Paul as

shows a commendable familiarity with
current literature, and in waxing senti

baby on whose face a struggling sunbeam
fell, and telling her readers that she felt
as if she must "shield the dead face from

ratio's big nose. Roderigo rises to his
mettle and forthwith purchases rich
and sonorous garments as would be
come his station and develops into a
fashionable and poetic lover. The love j
passages are delicately capricious and
beautiful. Roderigo is Faith itself;
Beatrix, while she loves for all there
is in her, is ever haunted by her "in
dependence" and her tragic doubt and
curiosity. This bit of the dialogue gives
the idea:
Beatrixâ lf a woman , Âââ_,,
Loved one with all her soul and found
him false, , Â__
Saw This betrayal, heard his ready lies
And knew them lies; saw he was doubly

brain? .â  .
Beatrixâ it mad thought?
Roderigoâ There are no such men.
Beatrixâ Oh, but there are â¦>Ââ..
Roderigo-Then she should face him thus.
"You lie! I know. the truth. Now go your

And thundered truth, she'd say, "I'll not

Thus God-forsaken, loveless and alone,
The faith within her blasted by the lie.
The mother in her turned to sterile hate,
A pillar of salt set in a thirsty land.
The â .man stands! What of the man? .
rifc-oâ He dies!
Beatrix is in turn eager for Rod
erigo's love and repelled by its inten
sity. She is first suspicious, jealous,
abusive, then all tenderness and sub
mission. The part sounds every note
I of the feminine temperament, so it is
I no surprise that the criticisms of Miss '
Nethersole's acting of it have not been
all sweet bouquets. The story concludes
with the killing of Roderigo by an un
scrupulous rival. There is an immense
scene where his body is carried to her
feet. "Link me to him!" she cries, and
wounds herself with a poisoned ring.
And then this exalted speech:
I ne'er shall know the taste of tears, or
sigh
Except for bliss. Never know aught but
rapture â
Not you shall wed us, Father-r
God himself,
Before His Throne!â Before His
"The Termagant" is written in high
language and in the eld elaborate mode,
but there Is strong stuff in it. and mix
ed with its pageantry and heroics is
a certain modern philosophy that is
very poignant. The popular fate of the
production is not yet definitely settled.
Even if it fail other poetic pieces will
be produced in London just the same.
And if it succeed who knows where the
boom for verse drama will stop? It
may even go so far as to include Wil
liam Shakespeare, and make him a real
quantity in the pleasures of his play
going countrymen.
* â¢ â¢
It seems to me that the variety busi
ness is getting to have more variety
about it and is generally looking up.
At the Orpheum, for instance, every
show doesn't look alike and the gal
lery is no longer the high and mighty
critic whose hiss is law. They still take
care of their gallery at the Orpheum,
giving it plenty of its own kind of fun,
but the humble patrons of the 50 cent
plush down stairs are also reckoned
with in the catering, and the "sawed
off" comedy has come ta stay. They
started the local vogue for these little
comedy acts with very bad ones. I re
member the first was so rank and so

successful with the crowd that I trem
bled for the fate of one that should
be really sane and legitimate. But the
gallery was not offended, and since
then the tapering process has gone se
renely on until now you can see Felix
Morris or Lillian Berkart, or Mr. and
Mrs. Dunstan do a fairly refined and
coherent playette without the least
personal risk. I am a sturdy believer
in the "sawed-off" play. It ought to
be just as important in the drama as
the short story is in fiction. Kipling
can say it all in twenty minutes â why
not the play writer? I was pleased
with "The Man Upstairs," the Gus
Thomas piece that Mr. and Mrs. Dun
stan and their condensed company have
been doing all week at the Orpheum.
Not that it is better than other short
pieces of Mr. Thomas', but because, In
such compact time, it seems to get out
all the vital essence and action of a
farce. Farces, with their first act of
Introduction and last of explanation,
have always been too long. It is the
short joke that captures the long
laugh. "The Man Upstairs" exploits
the good old motive of the wrong room,
and it has the tenderloin twist that
seems always to mark Mr. Thomas in
his lighter vein; but it Is quick, witty
and after all quite innocuous, and suc
cessfully given by the Dunstans and
their company.
I dislike always to be caviling at the
traditions of the "purfesh," but Isn't it
queer that the minute a "legitimate"
actor gets on the vaudeville stage he
thinks he has to make his work just
twice as large and noisy in order to
have it a go? I can understand that
the surroundingaâ acrobats, animals
The Olifams at the Alhambra
and quartets â of vaudeville must In
fluence the legitimate genius, but I
honestly believe that half the present
effort would gr-t twice the effect. One
part in this pieceâ a noisy one, it so
happens â is perfectly written and per
fectly played. Between Mr. Thomas

haired Sheriff, the production is, on the
whole, most creditaole. Maybelle Bow
man does a clever bit of character as
Lizbeth, and George Osbourne, Wallace
Shaw, Clarence Montaine and Howard
Scott do their usual best. David Be
lasco's famous old lyceum money-maker,
"The Wife," is to follow.
JYlorosco's.
Manager Morosco will inaugurate the
second week of Mr. Brophy's engagement
with a reproduction of the comedy drama
"The Runaway Wife," which was writ
ten by Fred G. and McKee Ran
kin. The story opens with a scene of
Arthur Eastman's studio In New York in
1572. Arthur, who has achieved fame as
an artist, is married to Lady Alice, the
daughter of a penniless peer. To sur
round her with the luxuries he thinks
necessary, he goes beyond his means. In
the struggle with financial difficulties he
strains his eyes and becomes suddenly
blind and helpless. Act 2 shows Eastman,
with his wife and child, on the Pennsyl
vania farm of his sister-in-law, who is a
cold, suspicious woman, who resents the
helpless charge she considers has been
thrust upon her. Talbot Vane, a former
rival for the hand of- Lady Alice, hears
of their impoverishment, and calls to offer
assistance. Arthur has been unreason
ably jealous of Vane. In his misery he
unjustly upbraids his wife, who leaves
him to make a home for herself and child.
Arthur, after her departure, still miscon
struing her actions, goes forth with the
boy to battle in his blindness with the
world. Fifteen years later the characters
meet in England under most dramatic cir
cumstances.
|leW Gomedvj JKeater.
Beginning to-morrow evening the new
military drama, "The Signal of Liberty,"
by M. Jossey, will be given at the New
Comedy. Among the people which the
war with Spain has brought into promi
nence none is more cordially hated than
"Butcher" Weyler and perhaps none more
respected and admired than "Fighting
Bob" Evans. In seeking for characters
for his play, the author has selected these
two menâ one to stir up patriotism and
the other hatred.
The /\lhambra.
The star card for the new bill at the
Alhambra is Robert Downing in a com
pressed version of "The Gladiator." Mr.
Downing is said to have made a big suc
cess of his vaudeville work. His short
sword combat is said to be very realistic.
Another "legitimate" act will be the ren
dition of parts of Oppenbach's sparkling
operetta "The Rose of Auvergne," by
Will S. Rising, supported by Lillian Kim
ble and Elmer Ellsworth. And still an
other is offered in George C. Boniface and
Nonna Ferner, who present a little com
edy of Washington life called, "A Game
of Lobby."
Jhe Golumbia.
At the Columbia Theater Nance O'Nell
will present "True to Life," her first New
York success, the first four nights and
complete the week with "Camille." In
"True to I^ife," a convict, released after
twenty-four years, finds, by means of a
photograph of himself In her possession,
his daughter, who was born after his im
prisonment. A gentleman of humanita
rian principles offers the jailbird aid tÂ»
start in business and. not knowing the re- â¢
lationship between the two. falls in love
with the daughter. She refuses him, not
willing to bunion him with her convict
relative. Th father comes to see her at
the gentleman's home secretly at mid
night to say farewell, is found under sus
picious circumstances and again arrested.
He refuses to give an account of himself .
for fear of dragging down his daughter's
name and is about to be resentenced when
she compels him to acknowledge their re
lationship and be saved.
Jhe TiVoli.
The Tivoll Opera House will revive for
seven nights only and a special Saturday
matinee, Balfe's ever popular ballad
opera. "The Bohemian Girl." with a cast
including Elvia Croxas Arline.Mary Linck
as the Queen of the gypsies. Rhys Thomas
as Thaddeua and William Pruette as
Count Arnheim. Edwin Stevens will make
his first appearance in nearly three
months as Devilshoof. Phil Branson will
be the Florestine. On Monday evening,
October 10, the regular comic opera sea
son will begin with a production of the
merry operatic fantasie, "The Circug
Queen. ' Many of the favorites of last
season will appear.
Jhe Orpheum.
With four new acts and a number of
changes by the hold-overs the Orpheum '
promises one of its strongest bills for this
week. Among the new comers are Caw
thorne and Forrester, who will appear in
a little sketch entitled, "A Damage Suit."
in which Mr. Cawthorne plays his favor
ite part of an Irishman. One of the real
old time turns is looked for from Mulvev
and Inman, who are credited with being
a pair of the cleverest dancers now on the
vaudeville sta^e.
Jhe Olvjmpia.
The Olympia Music Hall this week has
Irene Franklin in her clever songs and
character impersonations. The bill also
includes Lillian Monterey In descriptive
songs, Nadine Allen, the soubrette, and
Kelly and Vtolette.
Ghutes and Zoo.
At the Chutes Free Theater Pietro Ma
rino, the renowned young- violinist, will
play compositions of his own. The San
key Brothers, acrobats, who have made
a hit at the Orpheum, will be transferred
to Haight street. Agnes Castor a so
prano, said to be good, will sing- for the
first time here, and the "Young Sandow"
will indulge in a tug of war with twenty
soldiers.
Wismer Recital.

Mrs. Alfred Abbey, soprano; Mrs. Ma
thilde Wismer, mezzo-soprano, and S. G.

companied by Mile, d' Alton and a large
number of clever people. Hertz is a

THE HAY MARKET.
The circular of Scott & Magner says of Hay: ';
"The arrivals of Hay on the San Francisco
market during the past six days have amounted ,
to 2SOO tons. This shows a very heavy falling j
off in the amount we have been receiving of
late. On account of these lessened arrivals the
market has had a more buoyant tone, and has
raused a more confident feeling. Prices have,
Improved some, and particularly for the better
grades. There is hardly any offerings of late i
of what we term 'choice' Wheat Hay in rope
bound bales. Such Kay is in demand. is in
quired for daily and would command a figure i
above topmost quotations. Receipts of Alfalfa I
Hay have been very active lately, as the desire
to get the Hay to market before the rains are
heavy has pretty well filled the market. The
feeling generally for this article is not as
strong as it has been and sales are not as
readily made, although we cannot quote prices
as being definitely lower. .
" 'Foreign' Hayâ There has not been much
Hay coming in of late from our surrounding '
States. Prices have discouraged shipments, as
they were below the rates at which these out
side points could afford to ship their Hay un
der the heavy freight tariff carried. With the
present firmer market shipments can be ex
pected to be resumed:
"The demand for Straw has been fully equal
to the supply of late. On account of the late
rain, which will probably prevent same Straw
from being baled, the market has shown a cer
tain firmness."

EASTERN MARKET&
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Oct. I.â The stock market dur
ing to-day's short session gave striking evi
dence that the power of the bear faction had
not diminished In effecting lower prices. The
break in Tobacco was the more sensational, In J
view of the half holiday. No new develop
ments concerning the speculation in this stock
wore announced and the bears pursued the
same diligent tactics that have been responsible
for the tremendous drop this week. New spots |
of weakness have appeared every day and to- '
day's development was Consolidated Gas. Com- j
petition of the electric lighting companies and
a rival gas plant furnished the basis for a
l>re;.k of 6%.
The railway list had some strength, but the
lnliuence of the specialties was overpower
ing and losses resulted. The bank statement
exceeded the favorable expectations and its ;
publication checked the break. In a discussion !
of the llnancial developments of the week the j
Industrial group must have first consideration. '
Pyrotechnical movements of these stocks dls- I
turbed general confidence, and this condition i
Sound expression in an enormous liquidation in :
SI classes of securities. Rumors regarding the :
"utus of industrial properties were circulate. l
rreely and the operations by the. bear faction
were conducted with marked brilliancy. Influ- j
emial speculative Interests were apparently I
banded together to create demoralization among i
the holders an>l bad faith between interested i
cliques was assigned as cause for the spas- I
rdodlc attacks in various quarters. Liquidation :
In the group was uninterrupted throughout and !
the voiume of stop orders reached exceeded
previous outpouring of weeks. Margin ac
counts were swept away, and banking In
stitutions in some cases took exception to the
industrials as collateral for loans. Difficulty
in protecting holdings necessarily caused sacri- I
flees of the standard railway stocks, and> the
advantage secured by the bears in this con
nection was responsible for the curtailment of
the outside demand. Monetary conditions also
exerted an Important beurinfi on the course of
the market, and although apprehension as to
the stringency was considerably allayed the
occasional flurries that occurred unsettled spec
ulation.
Tobacco was the dominant feature and the
deluge of stocks which accompanied the break
colored reports that inside interests were un
loading It. Gossip had It that the recent Jump
above 150 was for the purpose of squeezing a
powerful short Interest, and now that the in
cident was closed the downward course received
acquiescence from the manipulative Interest* in
control. The numerous coups that have been
effected In this specialty since Its Introduction j
to the stock market have chilled public dealings i
and n-duced trading to the more daring pro
fessionals. The magnitude of the trading In â 
the specialties naturally served to promote a'
sympathetic tendency In the railroad list and
Included many favorable factors which stem
med the reaction. In fact, standard issues, on
the whole, exhibited remarkable resisting pow
ers and moved independently at Intervals, but
the jierris-tant raid elsewhere robbed the list
of monetary advantages. The bears followed a
eystematlc course and devoted their efforts
from one stock to another until the entire in
dustrial group was hammere.l.
Domestic conditions reflected a continuance
of the business expansion, which Is particularly
marked in some lines. Activity In the iron and
Ftof-1 trade, which is considered a fair barome
ter of the general situation, confirmed conn
dent predictions as to the general outlook, and
the steady increase in west-bound traffic learn
ings offset the light grain movement. The lat
ter must eventually be remedied by increased
movement on higher wheat prices or forced
shipments. Belated borrowers of call money
had to pay as high as 6 per cent for accommo
dations, but this rate was only temporary.
Average rates were 3%Â®4 per cent and time and
discount rates were decidedly easier. Ship
ments of currency to the Interior ehowed a
notable decrease and the available funds in the
market were Increased by the gold arrivals and
anticipatory interest payments by the Govern
ment. The bond market moved In sympathy
with stock fluctuations and showed more
activity on the eaMer money conditions.
Government bonjls wore remarkably well held
throughout the week, concessions being confined
i to % per cent In the 2's and 4 In the 3 s and 4 s
Total sales of stocks to-day were 226.400
shares. Including: Manhattnn. 244; Northern

V>* YORK, Oct. 1 â The Financier says:
New York bank statement for the current
is an argument in favor of lower money
. The excess reserve is now practically :
same as reported for the corresponding
during two previous years. The opera
tions with the treasury on bond account are
nearlng an end, the demand from the Interior
1b very light, and as the bank reserves are
being replenished by Imported gold now arriv
ing there seems to b<Â» no reason for further
fear as to the future. The contraction of j
$6 563.500 in loans reported for the week is j
due in part to the efforts of banks to Increase 1
reserves, but aside from that the liquidation
due to stock exchange operations has been
considerable. The Increase of $6,667,800 In
specie was brought about principally by re
ceipts of imported gold. It is stated that some 1
gold arrived late in the week from California, |
probably representing or anticipating Aus
tralian imports. The gold receipts, of course,
swelled the deposits and the increase of $1,374.
900 In that Item is the first reported in five
weeks. The bonds to secure United States
deposits foot up $44,250,000 specie, and legals
have decreased since July 14 about $42,000,000;
loans have fallen off $10,750,000; bank deposits
show a decrease of $19,000,000, and other de
posits $38,750,000. This will serve to show what
effects payments Into the treasury on bond ac
count have had in the last nine or ten weeks,
for very little of the total of decreased bank
balances has gone to interior banks. Since
July 14 and counting to the end of the week
lust elapsed, the circulation of New York na
tional banks has Increased at least $1,500,000,
principally on new 3 per cent bonds. Payments
of current Interest and principal by the treas
ury from this time on will release large sums
of money The outlook favors a decline in
interest rates to a level reported before the
bond payments began to disturb the markets.
LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Oct. I.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock

ing in working expenses.
Americans were dull on the New York lead.
Investment stocks were better on cheaper
money There are faint indications -of a re
vival of public Interest In Americans. Whether
It will develop depends entirely on politics.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 2, 1893.
CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
I CHICAGO, Oct. The opening in wheat was
at a slight advance over yesterday's closing
price, December starting: at 62% c. The Improve
ment was apparently due to Bradstreet's fig
ures on this week's exports, which were put at
5,307,000 bushels, compared with 5,025,000 bushels
the previous week. This had caused a strong
curb market yesterday and the strength was
still noticeable at to-day's opening. Shorts
were moderate buyers for a short time alter
! the start, buying being heavy enough to cause
: a further slight advance, December getting to
I 62% c and holding for a time at that "S^L*;
I Then the market slowly began to weaken and
I for the rest of the short session the trend lof

U
THE MICROBE IN AGRICULTURE.
Two years ago Professor Nobbe of
Tharand, a distinguished authority on
plant physiology, as the result of length
ened researches on the subject, took out
a patent for the preparation of pure cul
tures of the different nitrogen-fixing bac
teria of leguminous crops; and such pure
cultures, known under the name of nitra
gin, have been during that period manu
factured on a commercial scale by a large
German chemical firm. These pure cul
tures are sent out in little vials, each vial
containing sufficient of the pure culture
for the inoculation of an acre of soil. Evi
dence is yet wanting to show how far
such inoculation on a practical scale has
been accompanied with success. Many
small experiments, however, have demon
strated its value in a striking manner.
uithin the last month or two a further
development has been witnessed in the in
troduction by Herr Caron of Ellenbach. a
German landed proprietor, of another bac
terial culture in similar form and prepar
ed by the same German firm. This new
preparation is known as alinite. and is
designed for inoculating the soil with an
other class of Pitrogen-nxmg bacteria,
and is recommended for \jse in connec
tion with the other great class of agricul
tural crops, viz., grain crops; so that we
have now pure culture suitable for use in
tfie ease of all the common agricultural
crops. From researches carried out by
Dr. Stocklasa of Prague, it would appear
that alinite consists of a pure culture of
the bacillus megatherium.
The mode in which these pure cultures
are applied to the soil is simplicity itself.
It consists cither in inoculating the seed
of the crop which is to be sown with
the culture oy immersing it in a watery
solution of the culture; or in inoculating
the soil which may be most conveniently
done by mixing a quantity of sifted dry
soil with the pure culture and spreading
this over the fields. When we reflect that
in a vial barely a couple of inches in
length and less than a quarter of an inch
in diameter there may be contained the
means of enriching an acre of ground in
its most valuable of all fertilizing con
stituents we -ealize the grer.t advantage
such a process possesses over the more
costly and troublesome mode of strewing
large quantities of artificial manure.
A PET FLORIDA CRANE.
He stands at one side by the hour, Just
pluming himself, then gently picking at
shoe buttons and finger rings. Occasion
ally he is indulged in a favorite pastimeâ
that of taking the hairpins out of his mis
tress' hair.
In nature he Is as gentle and affection
ate as a kitten, and as he has never been
teased he has no enmity for anything ex
cept a dog. One night he was attacked
by a strange dog, find since then his
hatred for any canine other than the
home dog is intense, and as soon as his
eagle eye detects a strange dog he gives
a cry of alarm, and in the most quiet, se
date, but stately way walks out of range
into some retired corner. He is more
valuable than a watch dog, for at night
should any strange object intrude the
premises, he quickly gives a warning in a
voice fo loud and clangorous as to wake
even the "seven sleepers" themselves.
Dick has always been inordinately fond
of his master, whom he makes every ef
fort to please. It is at his command that
he will dance, bowing and twirling In the
most graceful manner; then circling with
wings distended around the yard and back
again to bow and courtesy as before. An
other very pleasing recognition of his in
telligence is the manner in which he
always welcomes his owner. He recog
nizes the horse and carriage as far as his
eye can reac.i, and long before the bird
is In view his voice is heard trumpeting
a greeting, which Is continued until the
master reaches the gate, when at the sin
gle command, "Louder, Dick," he throws
his head back and gives forth a long,
gurgling note, indicating joy and pleasure.
To no one else will he give this welcome.
It is unique and peculiarâ for his owner
alone.â From Forc-st and Stream.

joy to live; a lay when youth and in
, â¢ nocence, may well be happy.
A bugle is sounded and at the sound
- a strange procession moves upward
from the camp of General Garcia and
' begins to climb the trail that leads
â¢. to a high and bare hill top, from which
eminence : a wide land panorama of
/ beautiful Cuban scenery is unrolled to

Bound the opening notes of a dirge â
â¢ sternly and solemnly, and the forests
take up the strain and prolong the

which sound so sad that even the wild
birds listen and cease to sing.
The court of Cuban officers assembled
by General Garcia to try Binnie and
Julia upon the infamous charges made
by Ramirez, the spy, found that both
were guilty and sentenced them both
.to death. They were to be executed
by the Cuban soldiers. They heard
the sentence pronounced and did not
falter. Binnie said nothing. Julia rose
in her place before the assembled of
â  ficers and drew from her bosom a Cu
ban flag and held it proudly aloft.
. "Long I have endangered my life for
dear Cuba." she said, in a voice which
did not tremble, "and I have deserved
better of Cuba and of Cubans than
. that I should be found guilty of trea
son. By the hope of a blessed hereafter
I swear that Binnie and myself are
â¢ both innocent."
â¢ . A murmur of dissent ran around
'â¢: among the officers, and General Garcia
â¢ emphatically shook his head. Clearly
there was nothing but vengeance to be
" expected from the Cubans. Tear drops
â¢. rolled down the cheeks of the young
girl, to whom life was sweet. It was
hard to die so, Innocent, a victim to- the
t â¢ wiles of the wicked Ramirez, who sat
"'â ln. his place as a witness seemingly un
moved.
fI&F "I call finally upon Ramirez," con
tinued Julia, "to do an act* of justice.
-.Stand . forth, Ramirez, and say that
..what you have testified to 'Is false or"
forever be accursed as a shedder of in
ne.cent blood."
Still Ramirez did not move or make
any sign. His face paled a little per
haps and his eyes sought to evade the
burning glance of Julia. "What a con
trast they were! Upon every line of
Ramirez' face was. written deceit and
. guile. Julia was the personification of
! sincerity and high heroism. ..,.:..
"It is of no use, Julia," said Binnie
hoarsely, for his thoughts were of^his
â  far off San Francisco home, and h,e was
thinking of the grief which the- news
â¢of his ignominious death would bring
to his mother and father. ; "Speak no
more, but prepare yourself to die
bravely. Let It not be said that we
â  lacked courage. Be assured that the
.truth will yet become known and our

; lives and he can 'â 'ear up the record and
. Bend Ramirez to his well-deserved fate.
Ah: if only he and Harry Ostend, brave
, . and wise Harry Ostend, were here,
how."
' " â¢ An officer came forward to take from
â¢ ; Julia the Cuban flag which she held
aloft. ..
When the officer was only a few paces
off Julia called aloud three times,
clearly:
"Cuba llbre, Cuba libre forever!" .
. Then it was that Ramirez lost his
calmness/ That was the voice that
he had heard as it pursued him when
.he was a fugitive after he had killed
the Spanish captain in the canyon. At
. â¢ the sound then he had become sick at
â  heart. Now it commanded the dread
fill vision to arise once more â the can
yon, the dead Cubans and Spaniards
. who went down to the depths at the
battle pf the bridgeâ the captain who
: was struggling to reach the top of the
. canyon-^the perfidious Ramirez, who
there committed murderâ the flight
' from the scene of the tragedyâ and ever
pursuing voice â saying "Cuba libre"â
as he hastened away.
Julia's quick glance saw the change
on the face of Ramirez. "Look, look," j
â  she said eagerly; "he Is going to con
fess." ... ' ... /,;
'â  Indeed the sudden terror of that mo
. ment may have put into the mind
â  of- the spy to tell the truth; but what
â¢ ever the Impulse he had no opportun
. ity to speak. His face became livid.
; I.le fell forward in the dust and could
â .not rise. Stricken' down by a sudden
attack of terror his cowardly heart

murmur* Indicated that the Cuban sol
diers were displeased at the clemency
manifested toward Binnie and Julia by
General Garcia. Were not this boy
and girl traitors to the Cuban cause?
Then why were they not executed, even
as the court of " officers had directed.
The murmur? reached General Garcia
and he finally fixed the day for the ex
ecution.
So It was that upon the morning al
luded to in the opening of this chapter,
Binnie and Julia were going forth to
be executedâ to be shot down like
dogs. At the head of the line were
the trumpeters. Then came the two
prisoners, with their hands tied be
hind them and closely guarded by sol
diers who had orders to fire if either
prisoner made an attempt to scape.
Behind them walked a priest, reciting
prayers and speaking words of faith
and consolation, to fit them for their
end. The rear was brought up by a
full company of Cuban soldiers.
Behind the soldiers there were, omi
nously, carried two coffins. Julia saw
these* and shuddered, but Binnie spoke
bravely to her and she controlled her
self. The hilltop had been selected for
the place of execution at the request
of Binnie. â 'â '' -â '
"I want to see the Stars and Stripes
floating over Santiago de Cuba at the
last," he said.
General Garcia, aware that Binnie
was an American who had powerful
friends, and wishing to show all the
mercy he could, had granted this re
quest.
And now the hilltop was reached and
the preparations were speedily made.
Binnie and Julia were made ta^kneel
side by side. They were facing the
ocpan view and Binnie could not help
sighing as he thought of all his old-time
free life when he was on the cruise of
the California to far-off Guinea. He
sav^-vesseis slowly nr-rtTTg to--and fro
at a distance. Did the peril he was
in quicken and strengthen his vision?
He cried out aloud: "The California!
I see the California!"
"Poor boy," answered Julia. "You
do but dream, -and this is not the time
for dreams." V â 
"Have you anything that you would
like to say, American?" asked the oi
lier in -command of the soldiers. "I
was instructed . by General Garcia to
grant you every privilege possible."
"Unbind my arms a moment that I
may give my comrade a final embrace.
It will' be for only an instant."
The, officer looked at the priest, who
nodded encouragingly.
"It is not regular," he said, "but my
orders seem to permit you to have your
final wish â anything except freedom "
"And life," interrupted Binnie.
"And life," responded the officer
gravely.
Freed for the time from their bonds
the two prisoners forgot everything
except each other. Their arms were
fondly entwined. Their voices were
blended fondly in words of loving fare
well. The tears coursed ado' % n their
faces freely, and there were Cuban sol
diers who were quite unmanned by the
' sight, â  .
Warned by this the officer brought
the scene abruptly to a close. Once
more they are kneeling and- now the
death-dealing rifles of the Cubans are
brought to the dreadful level position
which indicates the fatal volley to be
fired. One instant and all is over.
"I believe in the resurrection and the
life," laurmered Binnie and somewhat
faintly as he glanced directly at the
rifles, for both he and Julia had re
quested that they might not be blinded.
One instant more of. earth and thenâ
What is this- din that breaks in upon
the solemn silence of that deadly in
stant? Not the sound "of the Cuban
rifles.. No, the officer has heard the
trampling of a horse driven furious!}
up the trail and he has paused. â¢-. The
; trampling comes nearer. . Now a rider,
urging on his horse recklessly, comes
into sight. What does this rider want?
He has ridden down the Cuban soldiers
in his haste to place himself between
them and the kneeling Binnie and
Julia. â 
"Thank God," ejaculates the rider, "I
am here -iust in time!"
', "Back, young man," thunders the of
ficer. "Who are you who dares to
break through our lines and place your
self In front of our rifles?"
"Ned; it is Ned, dear old Ned," says
Binnie. to Julia,
"I have the honor," goes on Ned.for
it Is he, "to present this document for
your consideration, captain."
"Advance, stranger,- and present the
document." ..'.'-
Ned leisurely comes forward and
hands to the officer a paper, at th?
bottom of which is the signature of.
General Garcia. It is a reprieve, issued
that "some newly discovered evidence
may be considered. So the' execution
does not come off.
At the word of command the deadly
rifles are lowered and the prisoners are
ordered to arise, which order they glad

command of the firing squad to wait a
few minutes for developments, for Gen
eral Garcia, Harry Ostend and another
are coming in company to the place.
Indeed, their approaching horses are
soon heard and the curiosity of all the
soldiers is on keen edge at the very
unusual situation.
"Here they come," said Ned.
General Garcia and Harry Ostend
were there truly. The third person
was â Ramirez, the spy. His face was
ashy white, by reason of fear, and it
was clear to all that he was to tell the
story that would favor Binnie and Ju
lia. He who had contrived their ruin
must free them and at awful cost to
himself. Perhaps he would take the
position of one sentenced to death.
Before Ramirez was called upon to
speak, Harry Ostend took from a pock
etbook a photograph and asked Gen
eral Garcia to inspect it. The invi
tation being accepted. General Garcia
started back with horror.
Ned could not repress his sense of
triumph at this manifestation.
"Would it not be well to permit Ra
mirez tn see the picture?" he asked.
THE BUMPKINS AND THE GRANGER GIVE THE FILIPINOS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THEIR IDEA OF THE U. S. CONGRESS DOING POLITICS.
"Very well," said General Garcia.
"Look, Ramirez, here is something that
will interest you; a scientific marvel in
its way."
Awed, but still curious, Ramirez took
the picture in his hand, but dropped it
with a shriek that thrilled all who
heard.
"I confess, I confess that the guilt
was mine," he said, his voice broken
and trembling.
"You hear, gentlemen," said Harry
Ostend gravely, "Ramirez says that he
recognizes the picture and that he is
guilty."
General Garcia whispers to the cap
tain of the guard and is heard to say
in a low tone of voice, "As goon as the
Americans shall have gone away."
What is the wonderful picture that
has confounded the hard-hearted spy
and has forced him to confess that he
Is guilty of crime? When Binnie, Ned
and Harry Ostend arrived in Cuba,
performing secret service for the
United States Government, they were
provided with every convenience that
the foresight of Harry Ostend and the
heads of the Secret Service Bureau
could suggest. Included in the equip
ment were several detective cameras,
so small that they could be readily
concealed, and so perfect that, in ad
DAVID H.
WALKER
dition to being always focused, they
proved often to be of the greatest
value. Binnie and Ned both had tiny
cameras when they started upon the
rid-> with the Cuban mountaineers that
terminated so tragically at the bottom
of the canyon.
Down fell horses and men, mixed in
one great catastrophe. There lay
horses and men, when Ramirez stealth
ily descended into the canyon. With
his still smoking pistol in his hand, the
spy passed hurriedly 'by Ned in his
flight, after the murder of the Spanish
captain. Did Ned move? The spy
fancied so and bent over him. An in
stant was enough to fix" a picture of
the spy's features. When Ned recov
ered consciousness, he covered the ex
posed camera, and so preserved a tiny
but accurate picture. This was de
veloped by Harry Ostend while he and
Xed were sailing towad Key West af
ter the surrender of Santiago de Cuba.
This picture so perfectly fitted into the
story that Julia told concerning what
she had seen after the battle of the
bridge, that Harry Ostend saw that the
case against Ramirez was complete. He
hastened to return to Cuba, that jus
tice might be done. Arriving there he
was astounded to hear of the danger
of Binnie and Julia. He acted prompt
ly, and Xed, as we have sepn, was just
in time to save the lives of Binnie and
Julia.
When the picture had been inspected
by all, General Garcia ordered that
Binnie and his brave comrade should
be set free at once. Hardly had this
happened when the Cuban soldiers hur
ried Ramirez to the spot where Binnie
had so lately knelt.
"Mercy, oh, mercy!" beseeched the
spy.
"Officer, do your duty," said General
Garcia sternly.
Harry Ostend and Binnie turned
aside. Ned looked with pity toward
the cowering wretch who was trem
bling before the guns which Binnie and
Julia had faced so courageously only a
few minutes before.
"One moment." said Julia; "I beg for
the life of the prisoner as a reward in
full for the service I may have ren
dered Cuba in her time of need."
"His life is yours. Julia," answered
General Garcia, after some thought.
"But why do you wish him to live?"
"There are other lands where he may
do better. Let us be merciful to him
as a token of our gratitude for release
from the Spanish yoke."
"Rise, dog," said General Garcia,
"and thank this magnanimous girl for
saving your wretched existence as a re
turn for your attempt to destroy hers."
Ramirez groveled in the dust at tho
feet of the happy girl, hardly daring
to believe that she had rescued him
when he was about to. pay the penalty
for his many crimes.
As the readers know, it was indeed
the yacht California that Binnie had
seen from the top of the mountain. And
now the hour for the departure of the
brave craft for the Philippines hascome.
Harry Ostend is aboard and so is Ned.
There, too, is Ramirez, who will have
a new chance in life. Binnie lingers
on Bhore, talking to Julia, until a gun
on the yacht is fired to call him to hir=
duty.
"Time is up, my dear Julia," he says,
"and I must go."
"Oh, Binnie, promise me that you will
never forget me."
"Never, never."
They have shaken hands and have
parted. Julia stands on the beach and
with dim eyes waves her handkerchief
in mute adieu. Binnie stands in the
stern of the small boat that is carry
ing him rapidly to the California, and
responsively waves the small Cuban
flag which Julia has given him as a
keepsake â her flag whlÂ«'h she has car
ried through so many perils, her dear
est treasure.
Blue are the waves. Merrily spar
kle the foam as the cleaving bow of
the California speeds through it. And
now she is farther and farther from
shore; and at last a mere speck. Still
Julia lingers on the beach until the
vessel that carries brave Binnie can
be s>'i?n no more. Spends the story of
Binnie and Ned in Cuba. D. H. W.

LITTLE LESTER,
THE ARTIST
IN February, 1897, the Children's
Hospital opened its doors to a little
waif, Lester Kamp by name, for
exactly the second time in its hia~
tory of the past two years. It now
shelters a prodigy of art, whose con
ceptions, though crude, indicate genius.
The opinions of Keith, Jorgensen,
Brewer, Cadenasso, Partlngton, Lati
mer and Sculptor Le Jeune are summed
up by the following expressionsâwon
derfully endowed, marvelously gifted,
a genius, incredible talent, astonishing
cleverness, remarkable ability and
amazing skill.
Lester Kamp's home, properly speak
ing, has been a transitory one, and his
conveyance frequently a police van.
He. has arranged his existence in the
Pope ward, partly through the kind
ness of the lady managers, partly be
cause his brain was of a measure too
full for a home at the Glen Ellen Fee
ble Minded Asylum, and wholly be
cause he was abandoned by a father
âwho was too busy to think of him, and
deserted by a mother. Often she left
him alone throughout the day, without
food or drink.
Year by year the child grew and so
did his wretchedness, and with it his
desire to study, to go to scuool and
last and greatest was his yearning to ;
become an artist.
Little Lester, after his mother s de- ,
Bertlon, began a rapid succession of
lodging-house experiences. His trunk
consisted of a little pine box, contain
ing only a scanty amount of clothing
and a few toys. That which deprived
him of his strength could not rob him
of his desire to achieve something in
the world of ideals.
His landlady, whose name is legion,
supplied him with economic implements
at art. Despite these crude materials
âfragments of paper for his canvas
and the shears for his pencil, tittle Les
ter gave a life of form and beauty to
his creations, denied to himself.-, No
books taught him of his art, nor
cheered him In his' loneliness, for he can
neither read nor write. Nature planted
this genius where he did not belong,
opened her page, gave him a startling
memory and left the rest to destiny.
And she placed this little estray in the
asylum for the sick and homeless
The door opened for me upon the
playroom of the Children's Hospital,
disclosing a group t)f boys on crutches,
who completely surrounded a figure by
the western window. One does not re
quire a nurse to point out the boy -won
der; the children do that. His figure
is one of misery and it takes some
time for the feeling of commiseration
to lose itself in wonder at his work.
Closely cropped hair, of golden brown,
edges a face so pale, so suggestive of
physical pain and resigned endurance,
that it looks prematurely old. The eyes
are large and of that hopeful blue,
which, when seen In a child who has
never known anything but despair, are
most affecting. A ragged and rusty
coat slouches over a back curved in and
squeezes the raised shoulders and ele
vated chest. A gray shawl wraps the
limp and paralyzed legs and his feet
hang sioeless to the floor.. .
The hands, such capable hands, are
small for his body and his years, and
his delicate fingers seem -as If gifted
with intelligence.' Hands of symmetry,
energy and power, that cut pictures
all day long for the sick children, who
regard him with awe. A smile that
is rare and does not animate the face
discloses a row of neglected teeth. His
movements denote that sort of apathy
which, if not accompanied by genius,
resembles imbecility. He has a whole
souled-abstraction in his work, without
which, like "Blind Tom," he is merely
an instrument. These qualities along
with his infirmities have been his fate
since his birth twelve years ago. Sen
sitive to neglect and loyal to memory,

he hopes with the intensity of a child
ish heart that his father will come to
see him.
Once or tv:ice, while out in the hos
pital yard, Lester saw his father driv
ing a team on Sacramento street, and
waved at him with his handkerchief.
The father answered the mute token
of recognition, and since then the more
than orphaned boy watches for the
passing teams with a wistfulness that
is touching, and says: "I would rather.
see him that far away than not at all."
His father has married again and
has children by his second wife to
claim his attention; but the hapless
child does not know this, and defends
him with these words: "I guess my
father is too tired when he gets through .
work or he would come."
If Lester lies back to rest during: tlv>
day it is to wish and at night to dream
that his father will come to see him
soon.
This poor little stray was never Â»Â»
comfortable anywhere as in the Chil
dren's Home. Wearing the rags cf : .
charily, ill fifting as tbev are, he shows
his gratitude by devoting his hours to
study while the other children play.
He site in his chair and dreams of the
time when he will have bright colored
paints and brushes for his material, ln
; stead of the. colored paper and scissors
now supplied him by the nurses. He
dreams of the future which will bring
him health, tools for his art and the.
return of his father's love.
Uniike the childish trebje, his. voice
is low and pathetic, ar.d he tells hi-s '
story in a tone so plaintive, yet ten
der, that it goes straight to. the heart
of the listener. "My mother," he be
gan and was passively silent for so.
long that I thought v- had forgotten
my question, "my mother only abused
me once, but she neglected me. Some
times -she left me all day with only
dry bread to eat and no water, and
sometimes I didn't always have dry
bread."
His speech Is slow and hesitating as
if trying to recall in detail the mem
ory of some unpleasant dream. â  â â¢
"She liked my brother best because
he wasn't a cripple like me. He had a '
nice straight back and could walk so
far without getting tired, and I" '
couldn't. Nobody likes crippled boys
as well as strong ones. I guess that
was why she didn't take me along. One
time when my mother left me, I got
dry and tried to get a drink. I fell
and hurt myself and so hard that,
a policeman came in and took me away
in a van."
Suddenly he quit talking and I looked
out of the window quite a while after
that, until I heard a dry little sob and
turned to see the tears splashed from
those great blue eye*. He bent his
head that I might not see his emotion,
while Ms little hand fumbled in his.
spacious pocket for a rag of a hand
kerchief to dry his wet cheeks- His
voice trembled and his lips quivered;
then he said, "I've ffot a very bad
cold."
Brave, little heart, yours is the kind,
that beats in the breast of the hero..
Casting about him for lcrve and find
ing his affections thrown back upon
himself, this elf-child like a true ge
nius, has created a world of his own,,
and has peopled it with beings who
care for him and he calls this world
"the world of make-believe."
"The kind people of make-believe .
land only come when the night is
dark," so Lester says, "or when I put
my head under the bed clothes, then,
they come and talk to me and tell me
to be brave when I am discouraged and
to be a good little boy. and that I wtlt.
be a great artist some day. ,'hen my.
back hurts so hard sometimes I have â¢
to cry, and then they come and put
their hands on me and make me feel
so strong and jus.t like I could walk if
I tried. I make believe I go with' them
to Berkeley some times and to San Jose,
where I used to live, and to the toy
shops and to ever so many places that
I have seen, and once I went to see my.
father with these people. He was
asleep and when I said 'Hello' to him
he didn't wa^e up, but he smiled at
me.
"These make-believe people are so
kind and never scold me. Their voices
haven't any sound, but I hear them tell
me how to cut my pictures and what I
shall make. They say that I can model
in clay after awhile, but not here, be
cause it would make too much dirt for
the nurses to clean up and that
wouldn't be right. They say I am go-
Ing away from here. Some one is go
ing to give me a home just as soon as
they see my pictures in the paper, and
I'll have all the paints I want to use.
nice warm clothes to wear and good
things to eat.
"I don't know where my new home
will be yet and I don't know where my
father is â and I wonder how I'll let.
him know where to come to see me.'-'
Something of Lester's uncanny
knowledge has taken possession of ine
âsomething of his faith in these in
visible friends, and I wonder who will
give him this home and what his future
will be?
IN STORYLAND.
BY MARGARET WIDDEMER.
In Storyland, In Storyland, I would that
I were there,
Where all rhe men are handsome, and ail
the maids are fair.
Where castles loom on every hand, where
all the days are bright, .
Where every lovelorn maiden has a gal
lant errant knight. â¢â¢ â¢
In a castle I sit spinning, looking out .
with eyes of blue,
Alwavs, ever, I am watching for one gal
lant knight and true;
But though many kneel before me, I dia
dain and spurn them all.
And sing softly, looking outward through
the loophole in the wall:
"He who comes to woo me
Must be dark ana grand"
(For my own long rippling hair It gleam
eth golden in my dream).
"When he comes to sue me
For my lily hand"
(And I'm looking pensively out to the
sunset-glowing stream).
List! Was that a horse's hoof-beat on
the drawbridge o'er the moat?
And my song it breaketh quickly and
adown the hall I float.
As a gallant knight he strideth up to
where I stand apart.
And he kneels before me proudly as he
asketh for my heart?
As I an.swer softly, softly, oh. It beateth
fast and loud;
I should know him and should love him
were I lying in my shroud.
For 'tis he, the knight I've dreamed of,
and I gladly clasp his hand
As he leads me from my castle to a wider
Storyland !
Little Nellie was sent to the corner
grocery for a pound of butter. "Well,
little girl, what can I do for you?"
asked the grocer. "Be quick, for I'm
awful busy." "P-please, sir," stam
mered Nellie, ": -v m-muzzer sendee! me
for a p-pountl of b-butter, but if you
is b-busy dive me a h-half p-pound."

WHO WILL BE KING
OF BEAUTIFUL SAMOA?
MATAAFA.
From a Photograph.
SAMOA just now Is a hotbed of
political intrigue, both the white
and the native population striv
ing their hardest to influence the
choice in the selection of a suc
cessor to the late King Malietoa.
Meanwhile ex-Chief Mataafa, who may
cut a big figure in solving the problem,
is carefully guarded on one of the Mar
shall Islands, for from his Samoan
home Great Britain, Germany and the
United States are watching him.
The causes which led to his deporta
tion are briefly as follows: In 1888 a
squadron of five German men-of-war
arrived in Apia Harbor and presented
a demand for Malietoa Laupepa to pay
within twenty-four hours the sum of
$13,000. this amount being a claim by
a German firm for alleged damage and
robbery of their plantations done by
the Samoana.
Before the twenty-four hours expired ;
800 men and two field pieces were \
landed. Malietoa fled to the bush, but, i
acting under the advice of Consul Gen- j
eral Sewall, gave himself up. Tama- â¢
Ft-pe, father of the present chief of that
name, was brought up from the district I
of Aona, where he had been in a state j
of rebellion for pome time, and installed
as King of Samoa at Mulinuu.
Malietoa was taken by the Germans
first to Jaluit and afterward to the ;
Cameroons. Tamasese. under the direc- !
tion of an ex-German officer named i
Brandeis, established a reign of terror.
Brandeia received all his instructions j
from the German Consul and the man- 'â â 
ager of the Deutsche Handels. At the
end of a year the natives, tired of
â working in chains on the roads, where 1

they were often put for most trifling
offenses, took to the bush and started
a war of rebellion.
]>-Ving for a leader they selected
Mataafa. The Germans at once sup
plied the Tamaseae Government with
arms and ammunition, being well paid
; with money which had been extorted
! from the natives under the guise of poll
tax. The majority of the foreigners,
American and English, having been
! treated harshly also, assisted the Ma
i taafa party with ammunition and food,
and the war started.
The U. S. S. Adams arrived under
Captain I.eary. followed by H. B. M.
ship Lizard and threw in their support
as far as they dared with Mataafa. On
two occasions Captain Leary cleared
deck for action; once against the
Tamasese Government on account of
some of their number having burned
the Stars and Stripes, and again
against a German man-of-war whose
captain was going to search American
goods for contraband of war. The
Tamasese people were driven into an
almost Impregnable fort by Mataafa
and he was slowly but surely gaining
ground in S"'*" of the assistance given
Tamasese by the Germans when the
famous hurricane of March 16, 1889, de
stroyed all the vessels ln the harbor.
As soon as it was seen that the Amer
ican and other ships were in danger
Mataafa stationed over 1000 men
round the beach with orders to remain
on guard day and night and to save all,
Irrespective of nationality (although
the Germans had just previously de
clared war against him), even at the
risk of their own lives.
How Mataafa and his men acted is
a matter of history, and when Admiral
Kimberley requested him to stay hos
tilities until the three powers could de
liberate on the whole question he at
once consented, although on the point
of reaping tho reward of his hard
fought engagements.
Shortly after the result of the Ber
lin conference was sent to Samoa in the
shape of a treaty. It decreed that Lau
pepa was to be the King, and no
provision whatever was made for Ma
taafa. The new Government was ac
cordingly started and Mataafa rele
gated to private life. Being naturally
of a proud disposition it was not lonK
before he allowed the counsels of his
followers to sway him, and he moved
down the coast a few miles and de
clared himself as "King of the Samo
ans." He established a model govern
ment, his power extending nearly all
over the group, in fact the foreigners
when they had any trouble with the
natives always sou-' 1 * redress at his
hands, which ts invariably given.
This state of affairs lasted for two
years when Germany and Great Britain
listened to the repeated petitions of
Laupepa, and consented to assist him
in breaking up the Mataafa party. This
news was freely disseminated through
out the group, the result being that
many chiefs who had promised their
assistance to Mataafa hel<l aloof when
the Government party attacked him.
He was driven to the island of Manono,
where the English and German men-of
war demanded his surrender. Mataafa
in company with twenty of his leading
chiefs was deported to the Marsha!!
group, which is a German possession.
